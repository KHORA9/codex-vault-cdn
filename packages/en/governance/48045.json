CHASE, of Ohio, and CHARLES\r\n        SUMNER, of Massachusetts. They are all capable, reliable,\r\n        and deserving, and either of them would worthily fill the\r\n        highest office in the Republic. We will not weigh their\r\n        respective claims, but we shall support to the utmost\r\n        of our ability whichever (if either) of them shall be\r\n        nominated.”\r\n\r\n    The Republican National Convention assembled at Philadelphia,\r\n    June 17, 1856, and chose Henry S. Lane, of Indiana, as\r\n    presiding officer. At an informal ballot for President there\r\n    were 359 votes for John C. Fremont and 196 for John McLean; New\r\n    York also gave two votes for Mr. Sumner and one for Mr. Seward.\r\n    Mr. Fremont was thereupon nominated unanimously. At an informal\r\n    ballot for Vice-President there were 259 votes for William L.\r\n    Dayton, 110 for Abraham Lincoln, 46 for N. P. Banks, 43 for\r\n    David Wilmot, 35 for Charles Sumner, 15 for Jacob Collamer, 9\r\n    for John A. King, 8 for S. C. Pomeroy, 7 for Thomas Ford, 5\r\n    for Henry Wilson, 4 for Cassius M. Clay, 3 for Henry C. Carey,\r\n    2 for J. R. Giddings, 2 for W. F. Johnston, and 1 for A. C.\r\n    M. Pennington. On a formal ballot, Mr. Dayton was nominated\r\n    unanimously.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner, who was at the time a guest of Francis P. Blair, at\r\n    his place near Washington, addressed the following letter to a\r\n    meeting at Faneuil Hall, in Boston, for the ratification of the\r\n    nominations.\r\n\r\n                  SILVER SPRING (near WASHINGTON), June 21, 1856.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--I am not strong enough for public speaking, even if\r\n  I were strong enough for a journey to Boston. Besides, my duties\r\n  in the Senate have the first claim upon me, and to them I must\r\n  give my first returning strength. Therefore am I constrained to\r\n  decline the invitation with which you have honored me.\r\n\r\n  But I am strong enough to send from my present retreat a brief\r\n  expression of cordial concurrence in the nominations made by the\r\n  People’s Convention at Philadelphia, and also of the gladness\r\n  with which I shall support them, by voice and vote, with mind and\r\n  heart.\r\n\r\n  I have long honored Colonel Fremont for his genius in\r\n  geographical enterprise, his eminent intelligence, his manly\r\n  fortitude, his perfect integrity, and his easy command of\r\n  men,--swaying to his own beneficent purpose even the savages of\r\n  the forest, while Nature herself, in her winter fastnesses, bowed\r\n  before his march. It is well, at this moment, when a Great Crime\r\n  is instigated and sustained by the National Government, that\r\n  such a man, with courage which will not be questioned, and with\r\n  sensitiveness to right which will not rest, should be summoned to\r\n  grapple with the wrong-doers. And permit me to say that I find no\r\n  force in the objection that he has never been a _politician_.\r\n\r\n  Your candidate for Vice-President is worthy to enjoy the same\r\n  enthusiastic support. As lawyer, as judge, and as Senator, Mr.\r\n  Dayton has been conspicuous for character and ability; and I\r\n  rejoice to believe that he will soon have a larger field of\r\n  activity, where these can be employed for the good of our common\r\n  country, while the Senate, which is the stronghold of Human\r\n  Slavery, will be compelled to receive as its presiding officer a\r\n  representative of Human Freedom.\r\n\r\n  But better even than the candidates is the Declaration of\r\n  Principles, under which we now go forth to conquer. Such a\r\n  Declaration, promulgated by such a Convention, is in itself the\r\n  beginning of victory. Strong in simplicity and truthfulness, it\r\n  must prevail just so soon as it is comprehended. It expresses\r\n  objects which should enlist the Conservative, while they enlist\r\n  the Reformer,--which should rally all who turn with respect to\r\n  the example of the Fathers, while they rally all who are filled\r\n  with aspirations for a brighter future on earth. It proposes to\r\n  save Kansas from the revolting usurpation established in that\r\n  fair Territory, and in this good work it joins issue with the\r\n  Slave Oligarchy, now swaying our whole country; so that, in\r\n  saving Kansas, we shall necessarily overthrow this Despotism,\r\n  and save ourselves. For support, it appeals to all, without\r\n  distinction of party, who love their country. It appeals to the\r\n  true Democrat, whose democracy is founded on the recognition of\r\n  Human Rights; it appeals to the true Whig, who is animated by\r\n  that hatred of despotic power which inspired those who earliest\r\n  wore the name; it appeals to the true American, who is ready to\r\n  forget all other questions for the sake of union to save Liberty\r\n  endangered; and it appeals to the foreign-born, who, rejoicing in\r\n  the privileges of American citizens, will not hesitate to join in\r\n  this holy endeavor to vindicate them against the aggressions of\r\n  an Oligarchy worse than any tyranny from which they have fled. In\r\n  this appeal all former differences are forgotten, while men,\r\n\r\n      “Erewhile that stood aloof, as shy to meet,\r\n      Familiar mingle here, like sister streams\r\n      That some rude interposing rock has split.”\r\n\r\n  In this contest there is every motive to union, and also every\r\n  motive to exertion. _Now or never! now and forever!_--such was\r\n  the ancient war-cry, which, embroidered on the Irish flag,\r\n  streamed from the Castle of Dublin, and resounded through the\r\n  whole island, arousing a generous people to new struggle for\r\n  ancient rights; and this war-cry may be fitly inscribed on our\r\n  standard now. _Arise now, or an inexorable slave-driving Tyranny\r\n  will be fastened upon you. Arise now, and Liberty will be secured\r\n  forever._\r\n\r\n  Present my regards to your associates in the good cause, and\r\n  believe me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Always faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  SETH WEBB, JR., Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGING FOR RESTORATION TO ACTIVE DUTIES,\r\n\r\nWITH APPEAL TO THE YOUNG MEN OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE COMMITTEE OF A YOUNG MEN’S CONVENTION AT FITCHBURG,\r\nAUGUST 5, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CRESSON, ALLEGHANY MOUNTAINS, PA.,\r\n                                                August 5, 1856.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--I wish that I could be with the young men of\r\n  Massachusetts at their proposed Convention, but I am so feeble\r\n  still that I am constrained to turn away from all temptations and\r\n  opportunities of labor. In writing this letter I infringe a rule\r\n  prescribed by my physician.\r\n\r\n  We have been told that “the duties of life are more than life”;\r\n  and I assure you that the hardest part of my present lot is the\r\n  enforced absence from public duties, and especially from that\r\n  seat where, as a Senator from Massachusetts, it is my right,\r\n  and also my strong desire at this moment, to be heard. But in\r\n  the coolness of the mountain retreat where I now am, I begin\r\n  to gather hope of returning strength,--if too tardily for the\r\n  performance of any public duties during the session of Congress\r\n  now about to close, yet in season to take part in the rally of\r\n  the people for the protection of Liberty in Kansas, and for the\r\n  overthrow of the oligarchical Tyranny which now degrades our\r\n  Republic.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile I commit the cause which we have at heart to the\r\n  generous sympathies of the people, who will surely rise to\r\n  smite the oppressor. Especially do I invoke the young. They are\r\n  the natural guardians of Liberty. Thus has it been throughout\r\n  all history; and never before in history did Liberty stand in\r\n  greater need of their irresistible aid. It is the young who\r\n  give spontaneous welcome to Truth, when she first appears an\r\n  unattended stranger. It is the young who open the soul with\r\n  instinctive hospitality to the noble cause. The young men of\r\n  Massachusetts act under natural impulses, when they step forward\r\n  as body-guard of the Republican party.\r\n\r\n  The great discoverer Harvey, on announcing the circulation of the\r\n  blood, was astonished to find that no person _upward of forty_\r\n  received this important truth. The young only embraced it. More\r\n  fortunate than this discovery, our cause rallies in its support\r\n  alike the experience of age and the ardor of youth; but it is\r\n  in the glowing embrace of the young that it finds assurance of\r\n  victory.\r\n\r\n  Were I able to make myself heard throughout the land, I would\r\n  say to the young men everywhere who truly love Liberty: “Your\r\n  candidate has been the renowned pioneer of civilization in\r\n  unsettled wastes: associate yourselves with him now as pioneers\r\n  of Liberty in the National Government; help him unfurl at\r\n  Washington the flag which he first unfurled on the peaks of the\r\n  Rocky Mountains; and be copartners with him in the glory of\r\n  redeeming our beloved country.”\r\n\r\n  Present to the young men of Massachusetts, whom you represent,\r\n  the assurance of my sincere interest in their happiness and\r\n  welfare, and believe me, my dear Sir, with much regard,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE H.

Most reluctantly, at this\r\n  period of our country’s trial, do I submit.\r\n\r\n  Accept for the Convention which will assemble at Providence my\r\n  best wishes. Let it apply itself with earnestness, diligence,\r\n  and singleness of purpose to the rescue of our fair land from\r\n  the tyranny which now degrades it. Here is room for all,--the\r\n  aged and the young, the Conservative and the Reformer. Surely,\r\n  Rhode Island, if not utterly disloyal to herself, if not utterly\r\n  disloyal to New England civilization, if not utterly disloyal to\r\n  the Republic of which she constitutes a part, will rise up as one\r\n  man and insist that Kansas shall be secured to Liberty, and that\r\n  the Slave Oligarchy shall be driven from its usurped foothold in\r\n  the National Government. At all events, this State, first planted\r\n  by the Author of Religious Freedom, will see that Human Rights do\r\n  not suffer through the votes of her children.\r\n\r\n      Believe me, my dear Sir, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTION FOR KANSAS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MESSRS. GREELEY AND MCELRATH, OF THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE,\r\nSEPTEMBER 23, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MESSRS. GREELEY AND MCELRATH:--\r\n\r\n  I have watched with interest your generous fund for the relief\r\n  and liberation of Kansas, now insulted, trodden down, torn, and\r\n  enslaved by the President of the United States, acting as the\r\n  tool of the tyrannical Slave Oligarchy. To other funds for this\r\n  important charity I have already given according to my small\r\n  means; but, as a constant reader of the “Tribune,” I cannot miss\r\n  the opportunity which you afford to protest anew against an\r\n  unparalleled Crime, and to contribute anew to its mitigation.\r\n  Please to accept the check which I enclose for one hundred\r\n  dollars. I wish it were more, when so much is needed.\r\n\r\n      Believe me, Gentlemen, your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  PHILADELPHIA, September 23, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGRET FOR CONTINUED DISABILITY.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO HON. LEWIS D. CAMPBELL, OF OHIO, SEPTEMBER 24, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HAMILTON, Monday, September 29, 1856.\r\n\r\n  EDITORS OF THE CINCINNATI GAZETTE:--\r\n\r\n  Tens of thousands of the Friends of Freedom were anxious to meet\r\n  Senator Sumner at this place on Friday last. Many went away\r\n  disappointed. I had assured the Committee of Arrangements, that,\r\n  if the state of his health permitted, he would attend the meeting.\r\n\r\n  I have just received the enclosed private letter, which I venture\r\n  to hand for publication, that those who were disappointed may\r\n  understand and appreciate the cause of his non-attendance. It\r\n  is in answer to a letter in which I urged Mr. Sumner to spend a\r\n  fortnight in the Miami Valley for recreation, and to appear at\r\n  the Hamilton meeting, even if his health should not permit him to\r\n  speak.\r\n\r\n      Very truly yours, &c.\r\n\r\n          LEWIS D. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      PHILADELPHIA, Wednesday, September 24, 1856.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 9th of September, after\r\n  travelling to Boston, at last found me here, where I am still\r\n  detained under medical treatment, away from my home, which I have\r\n  not visited since I left it at the beginning of the late session\r\n  of Congress, now ten months ago.\r\n\r\n  With sorrow inexpressible, I am still constrained to all the\r\n  care and reserve of an invalid. More than four months have\r\n  passed since you clasped my hand as I lay bleeding at the Senate\r\n  Chamber, and my system is even now so far from the firmness of\r\n  health that any departure from the prescribed rule is sure to\r\n  occasion a relapse. I could not reach Ohio except by slow stages;\r\n  and were I there, I should not have the sanction of my physician\r\n  in exposing myself to the excitements of a public meeting, even\r\n  if I said nothing. This is hard, very hard, for me to bear; for I\r\n  long to do something at this critical moment for the cause. What\r\n  is life without action?\r\n\r\n  For a while, at least, I must leave to others the precious\r\n  satisfaction of laboring for Liberty and the redemption of our\r\n  country. But I have the comfort of knowing that never before was\r\n  I so little needed.\r\n\r\n  God bless Ohio for her glorious testimony already, and her more\r\n  glorious promises!\r\n\r\n      Believe me, my dear Sir, very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  HON. LEWIS D. CAMPBELL, Hamilton, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF A VOTE FOR BUCHANAN:\r\n\r\nAPPEAL TO THE REPUBLICANS OF ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A COMMITTEE OF REPUBLICANS AT JOLIET, OCTOBER 2, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The local paper reports that this letter “was received with\r\n    tremendous applause.”\r\n\r\n                                  PHILADELPHIA, October 2, 1856.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--I am sorry that I cannot be with the Republicans\r\n  of Illinois at Joliet on the 8th of October, according to the\r\n  invitation with which they have honored me; but inexorable,\r\n  long-continued disability and the admonitions of medical skill\r\n  keep me back still from all public effort, and even from return\r\n  to my home, which I have not visited for more than ten months.\r\n\r\n  It is hard to renounce the opportunity which you offer me; for\r\n  I have constantly hoped to visit Illinois during the present\r\n  contest, and in plain language put to her people the questions\r\n  which they are to decide by their votes. These are all involved\r\n  in the Freedom of Kansas, but they are manifold in form.\r\n\r\n  Are you _against_ the extension of Slavery? If _yea_, then vote\r\n  for Fremont.\r\n\r\n  Are you especially _against_ the extension of Slavery BY FORCE?\r\n  If _yea_, then vote for Fremont.\r\n\r\n  Are you _against_ the erection of the Slave Oligarchy as the\r\n  dominant power in our Republic? If _yea_, then vote for Fremont.\r\n\r\n  Are you _against_ the violation of the constitutional rights of\r\n  American citizens? If _yea_, then vote for Fremont.\r\n\r\n  Audacious sophistry, often exposed, but still flaunting abroad,\r\n  may seek to deceive you. It may foam with abuse and bristle with\r\n  perversion of fact; but it cannot obscure the unquestionable\r\n  truth, which now stares everybody in the face, that a vote for\r\n  Buchanan is a vote for all these bad things. _It is a vote not\r\n  simply for the extension of Slavery, but also for the extension\r\n  of Slavery_ BY FORCE, involving, besides, the erection of the\r\n  Slave Oligarchy as the dominant power in our Republic, and the\r\n  violation of the constitutional rights of American citizens.\r\n  Surely, Illinois will not be led to sanction such enormities.\r\n  Hers will be the path of Liberty, which is, of course, the path\r\n  of true patriotism. Through her agency incalculable harm has\r\n  already come to the Republic; but I cannot forget that she has\r\n  begun a glorious reparation, by introducing to the National\r\n  Councils a Senator of rare skill in debate, of sweetest purity of\r\n  character, and of perfect loyalty to those principles by which\r\n  Liberty will be secured, and our good name extended in history.\r\n  I refer to Mr. Trumbull, who now belongs to the whole country,\r\n  which is justly grateful for his eminent services. With his\r\n  example before her, Illinois cannot wander again into the support\r\n  of Slavery.\r\n\r\n  Give to the Republicans of Illinois my hearty God-speed, and let\r\n  my absence speak to them.\r\n\r\n      Ever faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  TO HON. J. O. NORTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEAL FOR THE REPUBLICAN CAUSE.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A COMMITTEE OF HUDSON RIVER COUNTIES, POUGHKEEPSIE, NEW YORK,\r\nOCTOBER 3, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PHILADELPHIA, October 3, 1856.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--Among valued opportunities, which, by the dictation of\r\n  my physician and the admonitions of continued ill-health, I am\r\n  constrained to forego, is that afforded by the invitation, with\r\n  which I have been honored, to meet the Republicans of the Hudson\r\n  River Counties at Poughkeepsie. They will, I trust, believe me\r\n  not indifferent to their kindness, or to the cause in whose name\r\n  they are to assemble.\r\n\r\n  Nothing but necessity could keep me thus aloof, a mere looker-on,\r\n  while the great battle of Freedom is waged. The pleasure of the\r\n  sight to a spectator secure in the distance has been declared\r\n  by an ancient poet in a much admired passage, reproduced by a\r\n  greater modern:--\r\n\r\n      “’Tis pleasant also to behold from far\r\n      The moving legions mingled in the war.”\r\n\r\n  Yet the impulse and ardor of my convictions do not allow me to\r\n  be content in any such retirement. I wish to enter the strife,\r\n  and give such powers as I can to the righteous cause. But I am\r\n  forbidden.\r\n\r\n  It only remains that from my retreat I should send all that for\r\n  the present I can give, the prayers and benedictions of one yet\r\n  too feeble for any exertion.\r\n\r\n  While thus sitting apart, I am permitted to survey the field and\r\n  to recognize the ensigns of triumph now streaming in the fresh\r\n  northern breeze. Everywhere the people are aroused, at least\r\n  away from the pavement of great cities, where, too often, human\r\n  perversity is such as to suggest that “God made the country and\r\n  man made the town.”\r\n\r\n  Iowa, at the extreme West, and Maine, at the extreme East,\r\n  testify to a sentiment which must prevail also in the\r\n  intermediate States. In proper season New York and Pennsylvania\r\n  will confess it. And this is natural; for the whole broad country\r\n  has been shocked by the enormities of which Mr. Buchanan, in\r\n  the pending contest, is the unflinching representative, and Mr.\r\n  Fillmore the cautious, but effective, partisan.\r\n\r\n  In this contest I discern the masses of the people, under the\r\n  name of the Republican party, together with good men regardless\r\n  of ancient party ties, arrayed on the one side, while on the\r\n  other side is the oligarchical combination of slave-masters, with\r\n  the few Northern retainers they are yet able to keep, composed\r\n  chiefly of sophists whose lives are involved in a spider’s web of\r\n  fine-spun excuses, hirelings whose personal convictions are all\r\n  lost in salary, present or prospective, and trimmers whose eyes\r\n  fail to discern present changes of opinion only because they are\r\n  fastened too greedily upon ancient chances of preferment. Such\r\n  are the parties.\r\n\r\n  And I discern clearly the precise question on which these parties\r\n  are divided. In stating it I answer it.\r\n\r\n  The Territory of Kansas has been made the victim of countless\r\n  atrocities, in order to force Slavery upon its beautiful,\r\n  uncontaminated soil. By lawless violence a Government has been\r\n  established there, which, after despoiling the citizen of all\r\n  his dearest rights, has surrounded Slavery with the protection\r\n  of pretended statutes. And the question is distinctly submitted\r\n  to the American people, “Are you ready to sanction these\r\n  enormities?” This is the simple question. The orators of Slavery,\r\n  freely visiting Poughkeepsie, could not answer it, and therefore\r\n  they have kept it out of sight. But there the question stands.\r\n\r\n  Refusing to become partakers of such wrong, you will contribute\r\n  not only to the freedom of Kansas, but also to the overthrow\r\n  of the brutal and domineering Oligarchy which seeks to enslave\r\n  Kansas, simply as a stepping-stone to the enslavement of the\r\n  whole country. Surely, no man can hesitate, when Freedom requires\r\n  his vote. Nay, more, is not this cause worth living for? is not\r\n  this cause worth dying for?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks for the special kindness of your communication,\r\n  and my regrets that I can answer it only by this imperfect letter.\r\n\r\n      Believe me, dear Sir, ever faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN BAKER, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF FOR KANSAS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A COMMITTEE OF THE KANSAS AID SOCIETY AT BOSTON, OCTOBER 3,\r\n1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PHILADELPHIA, October 3, 1856.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--There is inspiration in a good cause, which is\r\n  shown at once in the improved character of all who embrace it.\r\n  Especially is this apparent in the young. Never is youth so\r\n  radiant as under its influence. The young men of Boston have done\r\n  wisely for themselves in associating together for the relief of\r\n  Kansas. All that they can do will be twice blessed,--blessing\r\n  them in their lives, and blessing distant despoiled\r\n  fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n  With pleasure I learn that the Governor will preside at your\r\n  earliest public meeting. But this is only according to the just\r\n  rule of life. Kindred to honors are duties; and the head of a\r\n  Christian Commonwealth should be the head of this Christian\r\n  charity, while every citizen should range in place, and our\r\n  beloved Massachusetts, by the contributions, voices, and votes\r\n  of her unanimous children, should become one united, compact,\r\n  all-embracing _Kansas Relief Society_, at once an overflowing\r\n  fountain of beneficence and an irresistible example to the\r\n  country. For myself, I would rather a thousand times serve\r\n  this cause, even in the humblest capacity, than be a Governor\r\n  indifferent to its appeals.\r\n\r\n  All that can be given is needed; and whoso gives bestows upon\r\n  a missionary enterprise, which, in the footsteps of Liberty,\r\n  will carry peace, civilization, Christianity, the Bible, and all\r\n  blessings of earth and heaven. To such a charity every person\r\n  must give; if in no other way, the man who has two coats must\r\n  sell one, and let Kansas have the other. But, while encouraging\r\n  this effort, candor compels the confession that all your\r\n  contributions will be of small account, unless a President and\r\n  Congress are chosen who shall give their sympathies to Freedom\r\n  rather than to Slavery. Only in this way can the rod of the\r\n  oppressor be broken. A vote for such men will be a contribution\r\n  to Kansas.\r\n\r\n  Present my thanks to your associates, and accept for yourself the\r\n  assurance of my special gratitude for that constant devotion to\r\n  human freedom by which you have been distinguished.\r\n\r\n      Ever faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  DR. W. F. CHANNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY TO VOTE FOR KANSAS AND FOR BURLINGAME.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A MEETING AT FANEUIL HALL, OCTOBER 29, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PHILADELPHIA, October 29, 1856.\r\n\r\n  SIR,--I cannot be at Faneuil Hall on Saturday evening, according\r\n  to the invitation with which I have been honored. But, though\r\n  feeble still, I hope to be in Boston on the succeeding Tuesday,\r\n  to vote. If not strong enough to speak, I trust at least to be\r\n  able to perform this duty of the citizen.\r\n\r\n  My vote will not be needed; but I am unwilling that the\r\n  opportunity should pass of uttering my determined NO against\r\n  the efforts now making to subjugate Kansas and to install the\r\n  Slave Oligarchy in permanent control of the National Government.\r\n  Against this dreadful conspiracy I protest, with all the ardor\r\n  of my soul; and I know no way in which I can hope to make\r\n  this protest immediately effective, except by casting my vote\r\n  for those candidates openly and unequivocally hostile to the\r\n  consummation of the crime.\r\n\r\n  Especially shall I vote for Burlingame; and I shall do this, not\r\n  only because I think him worthy of honor, and admire his generous\r\n  nature, intrepidity, and eloquence, but because I have at heart\r\n  the good name of Boston, and the welfare of my country. Boston\r\n  should sustain Burlingame, not merely for his sake, but for her\r\n  own sake,--not merely to do him honor, but to save herself from\r\n  dishonor,--not merely from local pride, but to strengthen Liberty\r\n  and to serve the whole Republic, now endangered alike from\r\n  criminal audacity and from subservient timidity.\r\n\r\n      I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n\r\n         Your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n              CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MEETING AT FANEUIL HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECEPTION OF MR. SUMNER, ON HIS RETURN TO BOSTON:\r\n\r\nWITH THE SPEECHES:\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 3, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n    As it became known that Mr. Sumner would return home to vote,\r\n    a Boston committee visited Philadelphia to urge his acceptance\r\n    of a banquet, with the understanding that he should simply show\r\n    himself there without speaking. Acting under medical advice, he\r\n    declined this invitation. The sympathy of the community found\r\n    vent in a public reception.\r\n\r\n    The reception of Senator Sumner, on his return to Boston, was\r\n    an imposing popular demonstration.[1] It was purely a peaceful\r\n    and spontaneous celebration. There was no organization of\r\n    enthusiasm; there were no military, no fire companies, no\r\n    associated bodies, to swell the ranks of the procession or\r\n    attract attention. Those of his fellow-citizens, simply, who\r\n    wished to testify respect and sympathy, went forth to meet\r\n    him; through the mouth of one, the most venerable and honored\r\n    of their number, they welcomed him on his entrance within the\r\n    limits of the city, and the chief executive magistrate of the\r\n    Commonwealth greeted him on his arrival beneath the shadow of\r\n    the State capitol. In both places, and also before Mr. Sumner’s\r\n    residence in Hancock Street, there were vast concourses of\r\n    citizens, assembled to do honor to their Senator.\r\n\r\n    The weather was favorable; the atmosphere was clear and warm\r\n    for the season; and although the appearance of the sky at times\r\n    boded rain, none fell until late in the evening, long after the\r\n    exercises of the day were concluded.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner arrived in this vicinity on Sunday morning,\r\n    November 2d. On Monday he drove from Professor Longfellow’s,\r\n    in Cambridge, where he had been staying, to the house of Amos\r\n    A. Lawrence, Esq., at Longwood, in Brookline. Soon after one\r\n    o’clock, the invited guests, who had assembled at the State\r\n    House, proceeded in open carriages to Longwood, where they were\r\n    joined by Mr. Sumner, who passed along the line of carriages,\r\n    and was silently greeted by the gentlemen rising and removing\r\n    their hats. The carriages then proceeded across to Roxbury, and\r\n    thence along Washington Street to the Boston line, which was\r\n    reached at three o’clock. Here the cavalcade was assembled,\r\n    together with a vast concourse of citizens.\r\n\r\n    The chief marshal was General John S. Tyler, assisted by the\r\n    following gentlemen as aids: Major John C. Park, Colonel\r\n    R. I. Burbank, Major Moses G. Cobb, E. Webster Pike, Esq.,\r\n    Adjutant-General E. W. Stone, Colonel A. J. Wright, Colonel W.\r\n    W. Bullock, and Carlos Pierce, Esq.\r\n\r\n    The following were the assistant marshals: Captain I. F.\r\n    Shepard, Charles H. Hawes, W. E. Webster, F. L. Chapin, O.\r\n    H. Dutton, Major F. A. Heath, F. B. Fay, Julian O. Mason, A.\r\n    A. Dunnels, Stephen Rhoades, H. D. Child, Leister M. Clark,\r\n    Charles W. Pierce, R. F. Martin, Rufus Frost, F. A. Fuller,\r\n    J. W. Wolcott, William B. Spooner, Henry D. Williams, Colonel\r\n    Robert Cowdin, of Boston, and Eugene Batchelder, Charles D.\r\n    Hills, D. P. Ripley, of Cambridge.\r\n\r\n    As it went up Washington Street, the cavalcade numbered, by\r\n    actual count, about eight hundred horsemen; but its numbers\r\n    were subsequently increased by fresh arrivals, in couples and\r\n    in groups, to over a thousand.\r\n\r\n    On the head of the cavalcade reaching the borders of Roxbury,\r\n    it halted, and the whole was drawn up in a long line at the\r\n    upper side of Washington Street, facing the centre. For over\r\n    half an hour it waited for the cortege from Brookline which was\r\n    to escort Mr. Sumner, and when at last the latter appeared,\r\n    it was received with hearty cheers and music from the Brigade\r\n    Band. It consisted of some sixteen or eighteen barouches or\r\n    carriages, containing the Committee of Arrangements and other\r\n    gentlemen.\r\n\r\n    The barouche which contained Mr. Sumner was drawn by\r\n    magnificent horses. With Mr. Sumner was the Rev. Professor F.\r\n    D. Huntington, of Harvard University, and Dr. Perry, of this\r\n    city, Mr. Sumner’s physician. Among those in the succeeding\r\n    barouches were Messrs. Abbott and James Lawrence, George and\r\n    Isaac Livermore, Edwin P. Whipple, George R. Russell, Charles\r\n    G. Loring, J. Huntington Wolcott, Hon. E. C. Baker, President\r\n    of the Senate, Dr. Beck and Rev. Dr. Francis, of Cambridge,\r\n    Professor Lovering, and James Russell Lowell, the poet,--that\r\n    which followed Mr. Sumner’s barouche containing Professor\r\n    Longfellow, and George Sumner, the brother of the Senator.\r\n\r\n    As the carriage with Mr. Sumner touched the line between\r\n    Roxbury and Boston, there was a general cheer, which was\r\n    continued along far into the distance,--the Brigade Band\r\n    playing “Hail Columbia.” The first division of the cavalcade\r\n    wheeled to the left, and formed into an escort. The carriages\r\n    of Mr. Sumner and the Committee came next in succession, and\r\n    then the two remaining divisions fell into column.\r\n\r\n    A few rods north of the Roxbury line the cavalcade came to a\r\n    halt, when Mr. Sumner’s carriage was driven alongside of that\r\n    containing Hon. Josiah Quincy, and Hon. Alexander H. Rice,\r\n    mayor of Boston. After greetings between the parties, Professor\r\n    Huntington introduced Mr. Sumner to Mr. Quincy in the following\r\n    brief address.\r\n\r\n        “MR. QUINCY,--The Committee of Arrangements for welcoming\r\n        the Hon. Charles Sumner to his home present him here to\r\n        you, Sir, a venerated representative of the city of his\r\n        birth. He comes back from his public post, where he has\r\n        bravely advocated the cause of all freemen, to enjoy a\r\n        freeman’s privilege and discharge a freeman’s duty. He\r\n        comes, a cheerful and victorious sufferer, out of great\r\n        conflicts of humanity with oppression, of ideas with\r\n        ignorance, of scholarship and refinement with barbarian\r\n        vulgarity, of intellectual power with desperate and brutal\r\n        violence, of conscience with selfish expediency, of right\r\n        with wrong. Boston does well in coming out to greet him.\r\n        For that ample and lofty manhood, trained under her\r\n        education and consolidated in her climate, has added new\r\n        dignity to her old renown. It has joined her name more\r\n        inseparably than ever with the aspirations of Christian\r\n        liberty, and the honors of disinterested patriotism,\r\n        throughout the earth, and through all time.”\r\n\r\n    MR. QUINCY then addressed Mr. Sumner as follows.\r\n\r\n        “MR. SUMNER,--It is with inexpressible pleasure that I\r\n        address you this day as the voice of the great multitude\r\n        of your fellow-citizens. In their name, and by their\r\n        authority, I welcome you to your home in Massachusetts,\r\n        expressing their honor and thanks for the power and\r\n        fidelity with which you have fulfilled your duties as\r\n        their representative in the Senate of the United States,\r\n        where, ‘unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,’ you kept your\r\n        love, your zeal, your loyalty to Liberty,--where neither\r\n        number nor example, threat nor sneer, ‘within you wrought\r\n        to swerve from truth, or change your constant mind.’\r\n        [_Applause._]\r\n\r\n        “You return to your country, Sir, after having given\r\n        glorious evidences of intellectual power, which touched,\r\n        as with the spear of Ithuriel, the evil spirit of our\r\n        Union, causing it at once to develop in full proportions\r\n        its gigantic deformity, compelling it to unveil to the Free\r\n        States its malign design to make this land of the free a\r\n        land of slaves. [_Voices, ‘Never! never!’_]\r\n\r\n        “You have suffered, and are still suffering, for your\r\n        intrepid faithfulness. But suffering in the cause of Truth\r\n        and Liberty is the heaven-laid path to win ‘the crown\r\n        which Virtue gives after this mortal change to her true\r\n        servants.’ [_Hearty cheers._]\r\n\r\n        “I rejoice that my life has been prolonged to this\r\n        day,--that I am permitted to behold the dawnings of\r\n        ancient Liberty through the broken openings of the clouds,\r\n        which for more than fifty years the spirit of Slavery has\r\n        extended over this Union. I thank Heaven that now, at\r\n        last, the Free States are beginning to awaken to a sense\r\n        of their dangers and their duties,--that, at length, they\r\n        begin to realize that the Slave States have overleaped\r\n        the bounds of the Constitution. The apathy of half a\r\n        century may delay for a time the triumphs of Freedom, but\r\n        come they will. Final success is certain. Never again\r\n        will the Free States in silence acquiesce in the farther\r\n        extension of slave domain. [_Loud applause, and cries of\r\n        ‘Never! never!’_] Henceforth they will hear and attend to\r\n        the warning voice of Washington, solemnly uttered in his\r\n        Farewell Address,--‘SUBMIT NOT TO USURPATION,’--‘RESIST,\r\n        WITH CARE, THE SPIRIT OF INNOVATION UPON THE PRINCIPLES OF\r\n        THE CONSTITUTION.’ [_Cheers._]\r\n\r\n        “We welcome you, Sir, as the champion of Freedom [_loud\r\n        cheers_], and as one to whom the deliverance which we hope\r\n        may yet be destined for our country will be greatly due.”\r\n\r\n    MR. SUMNER, who had been standing in his carriage, uncovered,\r\n    then spoke, in a subdued voice, and evidently under the\r\n    influence of deep feeling, as follows.\r\n\r\nMR. QUINCY,--A year has nearly run since I left Boston in the discharge\r\nof public duties. During this period, amidst important events, I have\r\nbeen able to do something which my fellow-citizens and neighbors,\r\nspeaking by your authoritative voice, are pleased to approve. I am\r\nhappy in this approbation. Especially am I happy that it is conveyed\r\nby the eloquent words of one who from my childhood has been with me an\r\nobject of unaffected reverence, who was the municipal head of my native\r\ncity while I was a pupil at its public schools, and who was the head of\r\nthe University while I was a pupil in that ancient seat.\r\n\r\nBoston, early in her history, set her face against Slavery. By a vote,\r\nentered upon her Town Records, as long ago as 1701, she called upon her\r\nRepresentatives “to put a period to negroes being slaves.” If I have\r\ndone anything to deserve the greeting you now lavish, it is because I\r\nhave striven to maintain those principles here declared, and to extend\r\nthem to other places,--stretching the venerable shelter of Faneuil Hall\r\neven over distant Kansas. [_Loud applause._]\r\n\r\nYou have made allusion to the suffering which I have undergone. This\r\nis not small. But it has been incurred in the performance of duty; and\r\nhow little is it, Sir, compared with the suffering of fellow-citizens\r\nin Kansas! How small is it, compared with that tale of woe which is\r\nperpetually coming to us from the house of bondage!\r\n\r\nWith you I hail the omens of final triumph. I ask no prophet to confirm\r\nthis assurance. The future is not less secure than the past.\r\n\r\nYou are pleased to quote injunctions of Washington. If ever there was\r\noccasion to bear these, not only in memory, but in heart, the time is\r\nnow, when Usurpation is the order of the day, and the Constitution\r\nis set at defiance. Beyond these precepts is also his great example,\r\nwhich, from first to last, teaches the constant lesson of fidelity, in\r\nstanding up for the liberties of our country, in undoubting faith that\r\nthe good cause cannot fail.\r\n\r\nThe rule of duty is the same for the lowly and the great; and, in the\r\ncommunication which I addressed to the Legislature of Massachusetts,\r\naccepting the trust which I now hold, I ventured to adopt the\r\ndetermination of Washington, and to avow his confidence. In both I hope\r\nto hold fast unto the end. [_Loud cheers._]\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner then passed from the carriage in which he had been\r\n    riding into that of Mr. Quincy and Mayor Rice. Professor\r\n    Huntington also took a seat in the same carriage, which was\r\n    drawn by six splendid gray horses. A body-guard of marshals\r\n    mounted, and of police, formed on each side of the barouche, in\r\n    order to keep the multitudes in the streets from pressing up to\r\n    shake hands with Mr. Sumner.\r\n\r\n    The cavalcade then proceeded onwards, amid repeated cheers of\r\n    the multitudes lining the streets on both sides. In accordance\r\n    with directions from his physician, Mr. Sumner acknowledged\r\n    these demonstrations only by a wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n    On reaching Newton Street, on Blackstone Square, a long line\r\n    of beautiful young ladies was ranged upon the pavement on the\r\n    south side, each holding a bouquet, to present to Senator\r\n    Sumner. Previously, however, a very interesting scene took\r\n    place. Mrs. C. W. Pierce, Mrs. G. L. Goodwin, Mrs. Henry Keyes,\r\n    and Miss Mary Pierce--each dressed in white, with wreaths on\r\n    their heads, and wearing elegant sashes--came forward, and\r\n    presented Mr. Sumner splendid bouquets, which action seemed\r\n    to give him much gratification. But the receipt of another\r\n    from the hands of a lovely child, carried up to the Senator in\r\n    the arms of a gentleman, and a similar act in Shawmut Avenue,\r\n    were peculiarly grateful to him. No previous or subsequent\r\n    circumstances during the day seemed to give Mr. Sumner such\r\n    true delight as these kindnesses. On proceeding forward, the\r\n    ladies showered their bouquets upon him from sidewalks and\r\n    windows along the street, until the carriage was pretty nigh\r\n    full. As the floral burden accumulated, he laughed the more\r\n    heartily, and spoke his gratitude to every one of the fair\r\n    donors his voice could reach. All along Newton Street, and the\r\n    west side of Blackstone Square, the procession was cheered\r\n    in the most enthusiastic manner. Ladies crowded almost every\r\n    window, and the scene was the most brilliant along the route.\r\n\r\n    As the procession reached the Boston Female Orphan Asylum on\r\n    Washington Street, the inmates of that institution were seen\r\n    ranged in front of the building, waving their handkerchiefs,\r\n    and displaying on a white banner a beautiful wreath of\r\n    evergreen intermingled with flowers, with the motto,--\r\n\r\n        “We weave a wreath for Charles Sumner.”\r\n\r\n    This was the only point on the route of the procession where\r\n    Mr. Sumner rose to his feet. Here the kindness of these\r\n    orphaned ones so touched his feelings, that he could not help\r\n    acknowledging it in this way.\r\n\r\n    Attached to several of the bouquets thrown to Mr. Sumner were\r\n    appropriate and expressive mottoes. The principal of them were\r\n    as follows.\r\n\r\n        “No bludgeon can dim the lustre of our champion of Freedom.”\r\n\r\n        “Massachusetts’s most honored son. If the ladies could\r\n        vote, he would be the next President.”\r\n\r\n        “A warm welcome from warm hearts to the noblest man America\r\n        has ever borne in her bosom! 78 Shawmut Avenue, Nov. 3,\r\n        1856.”\r\n\r\n        “Welcome home! The sons and daughters of Massachusetts\r\n        greet her noblest defender.”\r\n\r\n        “Infants welcome him whose name lives immortal in the\r\n        hearts of his countrymen.”\r\n\r\n        “Welcome, dear friend of justice!”\r\n\r\n    All along the line of procession, namely, down Washington\r\n    Street, Newton Street, Shawmut Avenue, Dover Street, Washington\r\n    Street, West Street, Tremont Street, Boylston Street, Charles\r\n    Street, and Beacon Street to the State House, the crowds which\r\n    greeted the honored Senator at every point were great.\r\n\r\n    At the corner of Washington and Newton Streets, over\r\n    Washington, there was a fine display of flags and streamers.\r\n    From the house of Mr. Nickerson, fronting on Franklin Square,\r\n    was a splendid triumphal arch, between two elm-trees, flags and\r\n    streamers surrounding the word--\r\n\r\n        “Welcome!”\r\n\r\n    Newton Street had a large number of flags, the union jack\r\n    displayed alternately with the national ensign on staffs\r\n    projecting from Franklin Square. The entire street was strewed\r\n    with evergreens. It was a beautiful display.\r\n\r\n    At the junction of Newton Street and Shawmut Avenue, the\r\n    houses of Benjamin Smith and Alfred A. Andrews were splendidly\r\n    decorated with festoons and flags. Between them, floating above\r\n    Newton Street, was the following:--\r\n\r\n        “Massachusetts loves, honors, will sustain and defend her\r\n        noble Sumner!”\r\n\r\n    The house of E. G. Dudley, at the corner of Shawmut Avenue\r\n    and Waltham Street, made a fine appearance. Besides flags and\r\n    festoons, was the following, wreathed in black:--\r\n\r\n        “May 22, 1856.”\r\n\r\n    Beneath this was the following:--\r\n\r\n        “Welcome, thrice welcome!”\r\n\r\n    At the corner of Shawmut Avenue and Dover Street, on the house\r\n    of Rev. Mr. Sargent, was the following significant motto:--\r\n\r\n        “To the _Right_!”\r\n\r\n    pointing the route of the procession.\r\n\r\n    The house of Dr. Parks, No. 88 Dover Street, was beautifully\r\n    decorated,--an eagle above the upper-story windows, holding a\r\n    number of streamers, which were gathered below. The following\r\n    was inscribed upon the building:--\r\n\r\n        “Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.”\r\n\r\n    The piano-rooms of T. Gilbert were decorated, with the words in\r\n    front,--\r\n\r\n        “Welcome, Freedom’s Defender!”\r\n\r\n    There were many other similar decorations. If longer time had\r\n    been given, the demonstration would have been other than it\r\n    was.[2] But it was not in decorations that the citizens of\r\n    Boston welcomed home the beloved son of Massachusetts; it was\r\n    rather with emotion too deep for utterance that they received\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    The scene at the State House was beyond description. The area\r\n    in front, the long range of steps leading to the Capitol, the\r\n    Capitol itself, the streets in the vicinity, the houses even\r\n    to the roofs, were packed with human beings. The assembled\r\n    thousands greeted him with long continued cheering.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner arrived in front of the Capitol, where a platform\r\n    had been erected. His Excellency Governor Gardner, the\r\n    Executive Council, and the Governor’s Staff were escorted by\r\n    the Sergeant-at-Arms, Benjamin Stevens, Esq. Mr. Sumner was\r\n    then introduced by Professor Huntington in an eloquent speech,\r\n    as follows.\r\n\r\n         “MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,--In behalf of the\r\n        Committee of Reception, I present to your Excellency the\r\n        Hon. Charles Sumner, Senator of Massachusetts in the\r\n        Congress of the United States. It is needless to recount\r\n        here his services to our Commonwealth, to the whole\r\n        Republic, to the principles of a pure and just nationality,\r\n        to elegant learning, to Christian statesmanship, to the\r\n        liberties and the rights of man. These are all safely\r\n        recorded in the imperishable history of the country and\r\n        the race. How deeply they are written in the hearts\r\n        of his fellow-citizens let this vast and enthusiastic\r\n        concourse bear witness. He returns to his friends; but\r\n        his friends are wherever justice is revered. He returns\r\n        to his neighbors; but he has a neighbor in every victim\r\n        of wrong throughout the world. He returns to the State\r\n        that entrusted her interests to his charge, having\r\n        proclaimed--according to the spirit of her own institutions\r\n        and her people--the doctrine of the Brotherhood of all\r\n        States, in the bonds of universal Peace. He stands at the\r\n        door of her Capitol, and in the presence of her Chief\r\n        Magistrate,--stands here her faithful steward, her eloquent\r\n        and fearless advocate, her honored guest, her beloved son!”\r\n\r\n    His Excellency replied briefly as follows.\r\n\r\n        “SIR,--I am admonished by the Committee of Arrangements\r\n        that my words must be few and brief.\r\n\r\n        “This is no political ovation. The Chief Marshal of the\r\n        procession announces that no political mottoes will be\r\n        admitted into the ranks. By the same sense of propriety I\r\n        am admonished that no political phrases are appropriate\r\n        here.\r\n\r\n        “This is the spontaneous outpouring of your friends and\r\n        neighbors and fellow-citizens to welcome you from your\r\n        field of intellectual victory,--and to welcome you also\r\n        from your bed of pain and suffering. I cordially add my\r\n        tribute, humble, save what my official station imparts to\r\n        it, to crown the just and welcome offering.\r\n\r\n        “We hail you with warm hearts, not only as the eloquent\r\n        orator, the accomplished scholar, and the acknowledged\r\n        statesman,--not only as the earnest friend of suffering\r\n        humanity and of every good cause,--not only as one\r\n        who, educated in the institutions and by the altars\r\n        and firesides of Massachusetts, has won for himself\r\n        imperishable laurels on the arena of the nation’s\r\n        conflicts,--but especially now do we welcome you as the\r\n        successful defender of her integrity and her honor.\r\n        [_Cheers._]\r\n\r\n        “In her name I declare that the base and cowardly blows\r\n        which fell on you struck through you into her. Within the\r\n        circuit of the sun’s flight after I heard of that assault,\r\n        before such an assemblage as rarely gathers in Faneuil\r\n        Hall, I pledged Massachusetts to stand by you. [_Loud\r\n        applause._]\r\n\r\n        “And she does stand by you to-day. She will stand by you\r\n        to-morrow [_enthusiastic cheers_]; and she will stand by\r\n        you in her defence forever. [_Loud cheering._]\r\n\r\n        “I welcome you, then, most cordially and warmly, in her\r\n        name, again to her borders. Every thrilling breast and\r\n        kindling countenance around you in this immense throng\r\n        welcomes you,--Boston welcomes you,--Massachusetts welcomes\r\n        you.\r\n\r\n        “In her name I trust that the quiet of your home may\r\n        speedily restore you to perfect health, so you can again go\r\n        forward to your sphere of duty, to new achievements, and\r\n        new victories.\r\n\r\n        “And now, Gentlemen, fellow-citizens, one word to you.\r\n        The duty of the day over, let us, one and all, leave our\r\n        distinguished friend to the undisturbed quiet of his own\r\n        home, to the fond caress of one whose ear is at this moment\r\n        bent in anxious watching for the earliest warning of his\r\n        approach, that he may there recover, not only from his past\r\n        illness, but from the present excitement and the fatigues\r\n        of travel. At present our kindest attentions will consist\r\n        in scrupulously avoiding exacting intrusions.\r\n\r\n        “To you, Sir, again, in the name of our glorious old\r\n        Commonwealth, I extend a cordial welcome. [_Loud cheers._]”\r\n\r\n    Three times three cheers were then given for Mr. Sumner, who\r\n    attempted to reply; but his voice was more feeble than in\r\n    replying to Mr. Quincy. He spoke, with great difficulty, as\r\n    follows.\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,--\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to be once more among the scenes of home; to look upon\r\nfamiliar objects,--the State House, the Common, and well-known streets.\r\nIt is more pleasant still to behold the countenances of friends. And\r\nall this pleasure, Sir, is enhanced by the welcome which you now give\r\nme, in behalf of the beloved Commonwealth which for five years I have\r\nserved, honestly, earnestly, and constantly, in an important field of\r\nduty, to which I was introduced by an unsought suffrage.\r\n\r\nSir, I thank you for this welcome. I thank, also, the distinguished\r\ngentlemen who have honored this occasion by their presence. I thank,\r\ntoo, these swelling multitudes who contribute to me the strength\r\nand succor of their sympathies; and my soul overflows especially to\r\nthe young men of Boston, out of whose hearts, as from an exuberant\r\nfountain, this broad-spreading hospitality took its rise.\r\n\r\nMy earnest desire, often expressed, has been, that I might be allowed\r\nto return home quietly, without show or demonstration of any kind.\r\nAnd this longing was enforced by my physical condition, which, though\r\nvastly improved at this time, and advancing surely towards complete\r\nhealth, is still exposed to the peril of relapse, or at least to the\r\narrest of those kindly processes of Nature essential to the restoration\r\nof a shattered system. But the spontaneous kindness of this reception\r\nmakes me forget my weakness, makes me forget my desire for repose.\r\n\r\nI thank you, Sir, for the suggestion of seclusion, and the security\r\nwhich that suggestion promises to afford.\r\n\r\nSomething more, Sir, I would say, but I am admonished that voice and\r\nstrength will not permit. With your permission, therefore, I will hand\r\nthe reporters what I should be glad to say, that it may be printed.\r\n\r\n    [The remainder of the speech is printed from Mr. Sumner’s\r\n    manuscript.]\r\n\r\nMore than five months have passed since I was disabled from the\r\nperformance of my public duties. During this weary period I have been\r\nconstrained to repeat daily the lesson of renunciation,--confined at\r\nfirst to my bed, and then only slowly regaining the power even to walk.\r\nBut, beyond the constant, irrepressible grief which must well up in the\r\nbreast of every patriot, as he discerns the present condition of his\r\ncountry, my chief sorrow has been caused by the necessity, to which I\r\nwas doomed, of renouncing all part in the contest for human rights,\r\nwhich, beginning in Congress, has since enveloped the whole land. The\r\nGrecian chief, grievously ill of a wound from the stealthy bite of\r\na snake, and left behind while his companions sailed to the siege of\r\nTroy, did not repine more at his enforced seclusion. From day to day\r\nand week to week I vainly sought that health which we value most when\r\nlost, and which perpetually eluded my pursuit. For health I strove, for\r\nhealth I prayed. With uncertain steps I sought it at the seashore and I\r\nsought it on the mountain-top.\r\n\r\n    “Two voices are there: one is of the sea,\r\n    One of the mountains; each a mighty voice:\r\n    In both from age to age thou didst rejoice,\r\n    They were thy chosen music, Liberty!”[3]\r\n\r\nI listened to the admonitions of medical skill, and I courted all the\r\nbracing influences of Nature, while time passed without the accustomed\r\nhealing on its wings. I had confidently hoped to be restored so as\r\nto take my seat in the Senate, and to be heard there again, long\r\nbefore the session closed. But Congress adjourned, leaving me still an\r\ninvalid. My next hope was, that I might be permitted to appear before\r\nthe people during the present canvass, and with heart and voice plead\r\nthe great cause now in issue. Here again I have been disappointed,\r\nand the thread of my disability is not yet spun to the end. Even now,\r\nthough happily lifted from long prostration, and beginning to assume\r\nmany of the conditions of health, I am constrained to confess that I am\r\nan invalid,--cheered, however, by the assurance that I shall soon be\r\npermitted, with unimpaired vigor, to resume all the responsibilities of\r\nmy position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToo much have I said about myself; but you will pardon it to the\r\noccasion, which, being personal in character, invites these personal\r\nconfessions. With more pleasure I turn to other things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI should feel that I failed in one of those duties which the heart\r\nprompts and the judgment confirms, if I allowed this first opportunity\r\nto pass without sincerest acknowledgment to my able, generous, and\r\nfaithful colleague, Mr. Wilson. Together we labored in mutual trust,\r\nhonorably leaning upon each other. By my disability he was left sole\r\nrepresentative of Massachusetts on the floor of the Senate, throughout\r\nmonths of heated contest, involving her good name and most cherished\r\nsentiments. All who watched the currents of debate, even as imperfectly\r\nas I did in my retirement, know with what readiness, courage, and power\r\nhe acted,--showing himself, by extraordinary energies, equal to the\r\nextraordinary occasion. But it is my especial happiness to recognize\r\nhis unfailing sympathies for myself, and his manly assumption of all\r\nthe responsibilities of the hour.\r\n\r\nI am not here to indulge in eulogy, nor to open any merit-roll of\r\nservice; but the same feeling which prompts these acknowledgments\r\nto my colleague embraces also the Commonwealth from whom we have\r\nreceived our trust. To Massachusetts, mother of us all,--great in\r\nresources, great in children,--I now pledge anew my devotion. Never\r\nbefore did she inspire equal pride and affection; for never before was\r\nshe so completely possessed by those sentiments which, when manifest\r\nin Commonwealth or citizen, invest the character with its highest\r\ncharm, so that what is sown a natural body is raised a spiritual\r\nbody. My filial love does not claim too much, when it exhibits her\r\nas approaching the pattern of a Christian Commonwealth, which,\r\naccording to the great English Republican, John Milton, “ought to be\r\nbut as one huge Christian personage, one mighty growth and stature\r\nof an honest man, as big and compact in virtue as in body.”[4] Not\r\nthrough any worldly triumphs, not through the vaults of State Street,\r\nthe spindles of Lowell, or even the learned endowments of Cambridge,\r\nis Massachusetts thus,--but because, seeking to extend everywhere\r\nwithin the sphere of her influence the benign civilization which she\r\ncultivates at home, she stands forth the faithful, unseduced supporter\r\nof Human Nature. Wealth has its splendor, and the intellect has its\r\nglory; but there is a grandeur in such service which is above all that\r\nthese can supply. For this she has already the regard of good men,\r\nand will have the immortal life of history. For this she has also the\r\nreproach and contumely always throughout the ages poured upon those\r\nwho have striven for justice on earth. Not now for the first time in\r\nhuman struggles has Truth, when most dishonored, seemed most radiant,\r\ngathering glory even out of obloquy. When Sir Harry Vane, courageous\r\nchampion of the English Commonwealth, was dragged on a hurdle up the\r\nTower Hill to suffer death by the axe, one of the multitude cried\r\nout to him, “That is the most glorious seat you ever sat on!”[5]\r\nAnd again, when Russell was exposed in the streets, on his way to a\r\nsimilar scaffold, the people, according to the simple narrative of his\r\nbiographer, imagined they saw Liberty and Virtue sitting by his side.\r\nMassachusetts is not without encouragement in her own history. She has\r\nseen her ports closed by arbitrary power,--has seen her name made a\r\nbyword of reproach,--has seen her cherished leaders, Hancock and Adams,\r\nexcepted from all pardon by the crown; but then, when most dishonored,\r\ndid Massachusetts deserve most, for then was she doing most for the\r\ncause of all. And now, when Massachusetts is engaged in a greater cause\r\nthan that of our fathers, how serenely can she turn from the scoff and\r\njeer of heartless men! Her only disgrace will be in disloyalty to the\r\ntruth which is to make her free.\r\n\r\nWorse to bear--oh, far worse!--than the evil speaking of others\r\nis the conduct of some of her own children. It is hard to see the\r\nscholarship which has been drawn from her cisterns, and the riches\r\naccumulated under her hospitable shelter, now employed to weaken and\r\ndiscredit that cause which is above riches or scholarship. It is hard,\r\nwhile fellow-citizens in Kansas plead for deliverance from a cruel\r\nUsurpation, and while the whole country, including our own soil, is\r\ntrodden down by a domineering and brutal Despotism, to behold sons of\r\nMassachusetts in sympathy, open or disguised, with the vulgar enemy,\r\nquickening everywhere the lash of the taskmaster, and helping forward\r\nthe Satanic carnival, when Slavery shall be fastened not only upon\r\nprostrate Kansas, but upon all the Territories of the Republic,--when\r\nCuba shall be torn from a friendly power by dishonest force,--and when\r\nthe slave-trade itself, with all its crime, its woe, and its shame,\r\nshall be opened anew under the American flag. Alas, that any child of\r\nMassachusetts, in wickedness of heart, or in weakness of principle, or\r\nunder the delusion of partisan prejudice, should join in these things!\r\nWith such I have no word of controversy at this hour. But, leaving\r\nthem now, in my weakness, I trust not to seem too severe, if I covet\r\nfor the occasion something of the divine power\r\n\r\n    “To bend the silver bow with tender skill,\r\n    While, void of pain, the silent arrows kill.”[6]\r\n\r\nGladly from these do I turn to another character, yet happily spared\r\nto Massachusetts, whose heart beats strong with the best blood of\r\nthe Revolution, and with the best sentiments by which that blood was\r\nenriched. The only child of one of the authors of American Liberty,\r\nfor many years the able and courageous Representative of Boston on the\r\nfloor of Congress, where his speeches were the masterpieces of the\r\ntime, distinguished throughout a long career by the grateful trust of\r\nhis fellow-citizens, happy in all the possessions of a well-spent life,\r\nand surrounded by “honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,” with an\r\nold age which is second youth, JOSIAH QUINCY, still erect under the\r\nburden of eighty-four winters, puts himself at the head of our great\r\nbattle,--and never before, in the ardor of youth, or the maturity of\r\nmanhood, did he show himself so grandly conspicuous, and add so much to\r\nthe heroic wealth of our history. His undaunted soul, lifted already\r\nto glimpses of another life, may shame the feebler spirits of a later\r\ngeneration. There is one other personage, at a distant period, who,\r\nwith precisely the same burden of winters, asserted the same supremacy\r\nof powers. It is the celebrated Dandolo, Doge of Venice, at the age of\r\neighty-four, of whom the historian Gibbon has said, in words strictly\r\napplicable to our own Quincy: “He shone, in the last period of human\r\nlife, as one of the most illustrious characters of the times: under the\r\nweight of years he retained a sound understanding and a manly courage,\r\nthe spirit of an hero and the wisdom of a patriot.”[7] This old man\r\ncarried the Venetian Republic over to the Crusaders, and exposed his\r\nperson freely to all the perils of war, so that the historian describes\r\nhim, in words again applicable to our day, saying: “In the midst of the\r\nconflict, the Doge, a venerable and conspicuous form, stood aloft, in\r\ncomplete armor, on the prow of his galley,” while “the great standard\r\nof St. Mark was displayed before him.”[8] Before the form of our\r\nvenerable head is displayed the standard of a greater republic than\r\nVenice, thrilling with its sight greater multitudes than ever gazed on\r\nthe standard of St. Mark, while a sublimer cause is ours than the cause\r\nof the Crusaders; for our task is not to ransom an empty sepulchre,\r\nbut to rescue the Saviour himself, in the bodies of his innumerable\r\nchildren,--not to dislodge the Infidel from a distant foreign soil, but\r\nto displace him from the very Jerusalem of our Liberties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay it please your Excellency, I forbear to proceed further. With\r\nthanks for this welcome, accept also my new vows of duty. In all\r\nsimplicity let me say that I seek nothing but the triumph of Truth.\r\nTo this I offer my best efforts, careless of office or honor. Show me\r\nthat I am wrong, and I stop at once; but in the complete conviction\r\nof right I shall persevere against all temptations, against all odds,\r\nagainst all perils, against all threats,--knowing well, that, whatever\r\nmay be my fate, the Right will surely prevail. Terrestrial place is\r\ndetermined by celestial observation. Only by watching the stars can\r\nthe mariner safely pursue his course; and it is only by obeying those\r\nlofty principles which are above men and human passion that we can make\r\nour way safely through the duties of life. In such obedience I hope to\r\nlive, while, as a servant of Massachusetts, I avoid no labor, shrink\r\nfrom no exposure, and complain of no hardship.\r\n\r\n    The cavalcade then moved rapidly away, escorting Mr. Sumner to\r\n    his home in Hancock Street.\r\n\r\n    On arriving there, he was again welcomed with unbounded\r\n    enthusiasm by a large crowd assembled in the street and on the\r\n    sidewalks, the windows being filled on both sides up and down\r\n    the street. The crowd cheered vociferously for Mr. Sumner, his\r\n    mother, the Governor, Hon. Josiah Quincy, Hon. N. P. Banks, and\r\n    Hon. Anson Burlingame. Mr. Sumner and his mother appeared at\r\n    the window and bowed their acknowledgments, which called forth\r\n    general and enthusiastic plaudits. The multitude then, giving\r\n    three parting cheers for the distinguished Senator, separated,\r\n    and the ceremonies of reception terminated.\r\n\r\n    Many of the business firms closed their stores during the\r\n    afternoon. The paper agreeing to do so was headed by A. & A.\r\n    Lawrence & Co., Gardner Brewer & Co., Parker, Wilder, & Co.,\r\n    Denny, Rice, & Gardner, Wilkinson, Stetson, & Co., Blake,\r\n    Bigelow, & Co., Pierce Brothers & Flanders, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAID FOR KANSAS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO HON. M. F. CONWAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HON. M. F. CONWAY, afterwards Representative in Congress from\r\n    Kansas, in communicating this letter to the public, reported\r\n    that it “was of great value in securing the appropriation of\r\n    twenty thousand dollars by the Legislature of Vermont in aid of\r\n    Kansas.”\r\n\r\n                                        BOSTON, November 17, 1856.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--I wish that I could aid your efforts to interest the\r\n  State Legislatures for Kansas. To these Legislatures I look at\r\n  this exigency for something worthy of the cause which is now in\r\n  jeopardy. They have the power, and this is the very moment to\r\n  exert it. God bless the State which begins!\r\n\r\n  Surely liberty in Kansas, involving our own liberty also, is\r\n  worthy of every effort. To its security every citizen should\r\n  contribute according to his means; and I know no better rule for\r\n  the State Legislatures than for the citizen. These Legislatures\r\n  should all contribute according to their means,--the more, the\r\n  better. And such contributions, like every other charity, will be\r\n  twice blessed.\r\n\r\n  Accept my best wishes for Kansas, and believe me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  JUDGE CONWAY, of Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGRATULATION ON REËLECTION OF ANSON BURLINGAME AS REPRESENTATIVE IN\r\nCONGRESS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A BANQUET AT FANEUIL HALL, NOVEMBER 24, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                HANCOCK STREET,\r\n                             Monday Evening, November 24, 1856.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--I am sorry to renounce any opportunity of doing honor\r\n  to Mr. Burlingame; but my careful physician does not allow me yet\r\n  to take part in the excitement of a public meeting, and I yield\r\n  to his prescription.\r\n\r\n  My best wishes attend your distinguished guest to-night and\r\n  always. His recent triumph is the occasion of special joy, not\r\n  only in Massachusetts, but everywhere throughout the free North.\r\n  Many who voted against him must, in their better moments, condemn\r\n  themselves,--as much as they have been condemned by others. If\r\n  not entirely dead to generous impulses, they must be glad that\r\n  they failed. If not entirely insensible to appearances, they\r\n  must look with regret at the means employed to accomplish the\r\n  end proposed. If not entirely indifferent to principles, they\r\n  must look with amazement at the unprecedented, incongruous, and\r\n  eccentric political conglomerate of which they constituted a part.\r\n\r\n  It was natural that the propagandists of Slavery, acting under\r\n  dictation from Washington, should vote against Mr. Burlingame. It\r\n  was natural that others, who allow themselves to be controlled\r\n  by the rancors and jealousies of party, should do likewise.\r\n  But it was hard that this blow at Freedom should be attempted\r\n  in the name of Trade, and that merchants of Boston should\r\n  be rallied against a candidate who had done so much to make\r\n  Boston respectable. And yet this extraordinary conduct is not\r\n  without parallel in history. The earliest antislavery effort of\r\n  England was against the Barbary corsairs, and this, it is well\r\n  known, was opposed by “the mercantile interest.” And this same\r\n  “mercantile interest,” as you also know, set itself against the\r\n  great antislavery enterprise of Clarkson and Wilberforce, when\r\n  they demanded the suppression of the slave-trade. Such examples\r\n  teach us not to be disappointed, when this interest is invoked\r\n  against our efforts. But I rejoice to know that in Boston there\r\n  are honorable exceptions, and, if anything be expected from me\r\n  to-night, let it be a tribute to one of these. I propose the\r\n  following toast.\r\n\r\n      _The Merchants of Boston._--May they all appreciate the\r\n      spirit of him among their number, who, when pressed to vote\r\n      against Mr. Burlingame on mercantile grounds, nobly replied\r\n      at once, “I am a merchant, but at the polls I mean to be a\r\n      patriot.”\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks for the honor of your invitation, and believe\r\n  me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n         CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  JOSEPH STORY, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OUR BUNKER HILL.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A COMMITTEE AT WORCESTER, NOVEMBER 24, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      BOSTON, November 24, 1856.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--Not willingly do I give up the opportunity of\r\n  uniting with the gallant Republicans of Worcester in celebrating\r\n  our recent victories; but my health, though vastly improved,\r\n  has limitations which I cannot with prudence neglect, and these\r\n  forbid the indulgence to which you kindly invite me. Please\r\n  tender to the Republicans my cordial congratulations. Clearly\r\n  do I see the beginning of the end. All New England, with New\r\n  York, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa, constitute an\r\n  irresistible phalanx for Freedom, while our seeming reverse in\r\n  the Presidential election is only another Bunker Hill. If toasts\r\n  are in order at your festival, let me propose the following.\r\n\r\n      _The late Presidential Election._--Like Bunker Hill, it\r\n      teaches us our strength, and gives assurance of speedy\r\n      triumph.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, my dear Sir, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n      CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET MASSACHUSETTS HELP KANSAS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO JAMES REDPATH, ESQ., JANUARY 10, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HANCOCK STREET, January 10, 1857.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--I am happy that you are still active for Kansas.\r\n  Much remains to be done. Indeed, I think that no effort can be\r\n  safely relaxed, until the Territory is admitted into the Union as\r\n  a Free State.\r\n\r\n  The Slave Oligarchy has not yet abandoned its darling idea of a\r\n  new Slave State, and this can be defeated only by vigilance. The\r\n  lull which seems now to prevail does not persuade me to repose.\r\n  Too much is at stake. Besides, I have read the fable of the cat\r\n  in the meal.\r\n\r\n  Of course, emigrants who love Freedom, and, if need be, are\r\n  willing to die in her cause, must be encouraged to plant\r\n  themselves in the Territory. But we who stay at home must\r\n  contribute to their comfort and protection, and, since this can\r\n  be done most effectively through State Legislatures, these must\r\n  be enlisted. The name of a State Legislature will be a tower of\r\n  strength.\r\n\r\n  Massachusetts, which, throughout our history, has led in every\r\n  liberal movement, must lead now by a generous appropriation,\r\n  which, if not needed, may not be used, but which, in any\r\n  alternative, will be an irresistible token of her sincerity, an\r\n  example to other States, and a fountain of encouragement to\r\n  distant fellow-citizens. I cannot believe that Massachusetts will\r\n  hesitate. Her people have already opened their hearts to Kansas,\r\n  and the public treasury should be opened as wide as their hearts.\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks for the good you have done and the good you are\r\n  still doing, and believe me, my dear Sir, with much regard,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  JAMES REDPATH, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCEPTANCE OF SENATORSHIP, ON REËLECTION.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS, JANUARY 22, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the winter of 1856, the American party having the control of\r\n    the Legislature of Massachusetts, members of this party were\r\n    reported as entering into a plan to choose a Senator in place\r\n    of Mr. Sumner at the expiration of his term, March 4, 1857,\r\n    thus anticipating the action of the Legislature to be chosen in\r\n    the autumn following. The plan was discussed in newspapers and\r\n    in contemporary letters. It excited the anxiety of Mr. Sumner’s\r\n    political friends so far, that, at their request, he was\r\n    induced to obtain from the Secretary of the Senate the adverse\r\n    precedents, which were published at the time in the newspapers.\r\n    The discussion of the question was arrested by the event which\r\n    soon followed, turning all eyes to him, and making him more\r\n    than ever the representative of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n    The new Legislature seemed to have been constituted for the\r\n    reëlection of Mr. Sumner. It came together January 7, 1857,\r\n    when, even before the message of the Governor, it was insisted\r\n    that the election should be proceeded with, and January 9th was\r\n    fixed upon for this purpose. On that day, in pursuance of an\r\n    order of the House, the Clerk called the roll of members, when\r\n    each responded _viva voce_ with the name of the person for whom\r\n    he voted, as follows.\r\n\r\n    Charles Sumner, of Boston,                 333\r\n    Robert C. Winthrop, of Boston,               3\r\n    Nathaniel J. Lord, of Salem,                 2\r\n    George W. Gordon, of Boston,                 1\r\n    Erasmus D. Beach, of Springfield,            1\r\n    Charles B. Goodrich, of Boston,              1\r\n    Otis P. Lord, of Salem,                      1\r\n    Edward Everett, of Boston,                   1\r\n    William Appleton, of Boston,                 1\r\n    Rufus Choate, of Boston,                     1\r\n                                              ----\r\n      Total vote,                              345\r\n      Members absent or not voting,             10\r\n                                              ----\r\n      Whole number of members,                 355\r\n\r\n    The announcement of the vote was received with applause.\r\n\r\n    In the Senate the vote was taken in the same way, January 13th,\r\n    and every member responded with the name of “Charles Sumner, of\r\n    Boston,” the vote being unanimous, when the President announced\r\n    that “Hon. CHARLES SUMNER, of Boston, having received the\r\n    entire vote of the Senate, in concurrence with the House, is\r\n    elected United States Senator from this State for the term of\r\n    six years from the fourth of March next.”\r\n\r\n    The _Boston Daily Advertiser_ noticed this event as follows.\r\n\r\n        “It is impossible to refrain from comparing the election\r\n        of yesterday with Mr. Sumner’s previous election in the\r\n        same place six years ago. _Now_ he receives nearly all the\r\n        votes, on the first ballot, taken on the third day of the\r\n        session, every member speaking aloud his vote. _Then_ he\r\n        received only the exact number necessary for a choice,--one\r\n        more than half the whole number; and the election was not\r\n        effected until the twenty-sixth ballot, taken on the one\r\n        hundred and fourteenth day of the session (April 24, 1851),\r\n        and the votes were thrown in sealed envelopes. _Then_ he\r\n        was the candidate of a party which threw 27,636 votes in\r\n        the State, at the preceding popular election, or about one\r\n        fifth of the whole number. _Now_ he is the candidate of a\r\n        party which threw 108,190 votes in the State, at the last\r\n        popular election, or about two thirds of the whole number.\r\n        _Then_ he was chosen to a body where he could expect to\r\n        find but two or three associates sympathizing with his\r\n        sentiments. _Now_ he is a member of a party which has a\r\n        majority in the lower House of Congress, and numbers a\r\n        quarter of the members even of the Senate of the United\r\n        States. Truly, _tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis_.”\r\n\r\n    The _New York Tribune_ had the following comment.\r\n\r\n        “We need not, in view of recent events, point out the\r\n        change which has taken place in the public sentiment of\r\n        Massachusetts. It is not too much to say that Mr. Sumner\r\n        is at this moment the most popular man in the State, the\r\n        opinions of which he so truly represents. Nor will it\r\n        do to attribute this general love, honor, and sympathy\r\n        entirely to the felonious assault made upon Mr. Sumner. Had\r\n        he been less true to the cause committed to his keeping,\r\n        had he trimmed and temporized, and spoken softly when he\r\n        should have spoken sharply, he would have been safe from\r\n        the bludgeon of the bully, and might have won the smiles\r\n        instead of the expectorations of a certain servile Senator.\r\n        The people of Massachusetts have estimated Mr. Sumner’s\r\n        service in all its length and breadth; they have duly\r\n        weighed all its incidents and indignities,--what he has\r\n        suffered, what he has accomplished, and what he has failed\r\n        to accomplish; and their verdict, expressed in yesterday’s\r\n        almost unanimous vote in the House of Representatives,\r\n        bestows upon him a crown of honor which may well assuage\r\n        the hope deferred of a tardy convalescence. Few public men\r\n        have had such large opportunities, few public men have so\r\n        nobly improved them.”\r\n\r\n    On the 23d of January, 1857, Hon. Charles A. Phelps, Speaker\r\n    of the House of Representatives, laid before the House the\r\n    following letter, which was read, and, on motion of Hon.\r\n    Charles Hale, of Boston, entered at large upon the Journal.\r\n\r\n        FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,--\r\n\r\n        I have been officially notified that the people of\r\n        Massachusetts, by concurrent votes of both branches of the\r\n        Legislature, have charged me with the duty of representing\r\n        them in the Senate of the United States for another term of\r\n        six years, on the expiration of that which I now have the\r\n        honor to hold. This renewed trust I accept with gratitude\r\n        enhanced by the peculiar circumstances under which it is\r\n        bestowed. But far beyond every personal gratification is\r\n        the delight of knowing, by this sign, that the people of\r\n        Massachusetts, forgetting ancient party hates, have at\r\n        last come together in fraternal support of a sacred cause,\r\n        compared with which the fate of any public servant is of\r\n        small account.\r\n\r\n        When first selected for this eminent trust, I was a\r\n        stranger to all official life. Untried in public affairs,\r\n        I was taken up, and placed, without effort of my own, and\r\n        even without antecedent aspiration, in the station where,\r\n        after an experience of nearly six years, you now, with\r\n        spontaneous unanimity, bid me remain. About to commence a\r\n        fresh term of service, I turn with honest pride to that\r\n        which is about to close, while I greet anew the duties\r\n        and responsibilities of my position,--hoping, that, by\r\n        conscientious endeavor, I may do something in the future\r\n        better than in the past, and mindful that “he that girdeth\r\n        on his harness should not boast himself as he that putteth\r\n        it off.”\r\n\r\n        The duties of a public servant are not always conspicuous.\r\n        Much of his time is absorbed in cares which, if not\r\n        obscure, are little calculated to attract public attention.\r\n        Massachusetts justly expects that no such interests\r\n        shall be neglected. But, by solemn resolutions of her\r\n        Legislature, by the votes of her people, and by the voice\r\n        of her history, Massachusetts especially enjoins upon her\r\n        representatives to see, that, at all hazards, and whatever\r\n        else may suffer, Freedom shall prevail. I cannot neglect\r\n        this injunction.\r\n\r\n        Alike by sympathy with the slave and by determination to\r\n        save ourselves from wretched thraldom, we are all summoned\r\n        to the effort now organized for _the emancipation of the\r\n        National Government_ from a degrading influence, hostile\r\n        to civilization, which, wherever it shows itself, even\r\n        at a distance, is brutal, vulgar, and mean, constituting\r\n        an unnatural tyranny, calculated to arouse the generous\r\n        indignation of good men. Of course, no person, unless\r\n        ready to say in his heart that there is no God, can doubt\r\n        the certain result. But this result, like every great\r\n        good, can be accomplished only by well-directed effort. I\r\n        know something of the labor and trial which such service\r\n        imposes; I also know something of the satisfaction it\r\n        affords, giving to all who truly espouse it a better joy\r\n        than anything in office or honor. In the weary prostration\r\n        of months, from which I have now happily risen, the\r\n        sharpest pang came out of my enforced separation from\r\n        the cause which was so dear to me; and now my content is\r\n        in the assurance that to this service I may dedicate the\r\n        vigorous health which, through medical care and the kindly\r\n        ministrations of Nature, I am permitted to expect. In this\r\n        well-founded assurance, I welcome the trust which has been\r\n        again conferred upon me, while I once more bespeak the\r\n        candid judgment of my fellow-citizens, and once more invoke\r\n        the guardianship of a benignant Providence.\r\n\r\n        I have the honor to be, fellow-citizens, with grateful\r\n        regard,\r\n\r\n            Your faithful servant and Senator,\r\n\r\n                CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n        BOSTON, January 22, 1857.\r\n\r\n    The following tribute, taken from contemporary newspapers,\r\n    attests a feeling much above that of ordinary politics, and\r\n    therefore illustrates this record.\r\n\r\n        “‘CHARLES SUMNER, OF BOSTON.’\r\n\r\n        “‘Three hundred and thirty-three members answered to their\r\n        names, with the words, “CHARLES SUMNER, of Boston”; and\r\n        as the Clerk responded with the same words to each vote,\r\n        they rang upon the ears of the large assembly more than six\r\n        hundred times during the hour occupied with calling the\r\n        roll.’\r\n\r\n        “‘It is said, no sound is ever lost,--that every word\r\n        uttered upon earth is echoed and reëchoed through space\r\n        forever.’\r\n\r\n        “Old Massachusetts! nobly thou\r\n          This day thy work hast done;\r\n        Proudly thou speakest for the Right,\r\n          And for thy honored son:\r\n\r\n        “Three hundred voices on the air,\r\n          Ringing the loved name forth;\r\n        Three hundred voices echoing back,\r\n          ‘CHARLES SUMNER, of the North!’\r\n\r\n        “Throughout the land, beyond the sea,\r\n          The voices will be heard;\r\n        His name shall stand for Liberty,\r\n          The freeman’s rallying word.\r\n\r\n        “Throughout the land, beyond the sea,\r\n          Above, in arches high,\r\n        Voices are ever echoing\r\n          A name that ne’er will die.\r\n\r\n        “Unfurl the banners! even now\r\n          The stars more brightly shine:\r\n        Is one more glorious than the rest?\r\n          Old Bay State, it is thine!\r\n\r\n        “Gather fresh laurels, twine two wreaths,\r\n          Wreaths for a victory won,--\r\n        Loved Massachusetts, one for thee,\r\n          One for thy chosen son!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRATITUDE FOR SYMPATHY OF THE PEOPLE OF VERMONT.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO HON. RYLAND FLETCHER, GOVERNOR OF VERMONT, MARCH 7, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Legislature of Vermont, at its recent session, passed\r\n    a series of joint resolutions, highly complimentary, and\r\n    indorsing Mr. Sumner’s last speech in the Senate. On receiving\r\n    a copy, Mr. Sumner wrote the following reply.\r\n\r\n                              NEW YORK, Saturday, March 7, 1857.\r\n\r\n  TO HIS EXCELLENCY, RYLAND FLETCHER, GOVERNOR OF VERMONT.\r\n\r\n  SIR,--At the last moment before leaving for foreign lands in\r\n  quest of that vigorous health which for nearly ten months has\r\n  been taken from me, I have received notice of the resolutions\r\n  adopted by the Legislature of Vermont, and approved by your\r\n  Excellency, which give the official sanction of a generous,\r\n  virtuous, and intelligent State to my speech in the Senate on the\r\n  19th and 20th of May last, exposing the Crime against Kansas.\r\n  Such a token is precious to me in every respect,--not only\r\n  because it assures me of the personal sympathy of the people of\r\n  Vermont, declared through their representatives, but because it\r\n  attests their interest in that cause which is more important than\r\n  any person.\r\n\r\n  I cannot accept this public approval of my speech without seizing\r\n  the occasion to express a heartfelt joy that I was permitted\r\n  to make it, and also my humble determination, with returning\r\n  strength, to do something that shall still further unmask the\r\n  portentous _Barbarism_ which has fastened on our Republic, and\r\n  installed itself in all the high places of power.\r\n\r\n  I have the honor to be, Sir, with much respect,\r\n\r\n      Your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LAST WORD FOR KANSAS, ON SAILING FOR EUROPE.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO JAMES REDPATH, ESQ., MARCH 7, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ON BOARD STEAMSHIP FULTON, March 7, 1857.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--I trust that you and our friends will not be\r\n  disheartened in efforts for Kansas. Much must still be done, or\r\n  the night of Slavery will settle down on that beautiful Territory.\r\n\r\n  Surely the Legislature of Massachusetts will feel the inspiration\r\n  of a great cause, and pledge itself by a generous appropriation\r\n  to its support. I hear of constitutional impediments, but I\r\n  believe that all such will be found to have bottom in the\r\n  lukewarm hearts of objectors rather than in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n  There are some who think that anything for Slavery is\r\n  constitutional, but nothing for Freedom. With me the opposite\r\n  rule prevails, and I venture to say that any other rule must\r\n  bring discredit upon a country calling itself a Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n  I trust, also, that the people of Kansas will stand firm, and\r\n  that, if need be, they will know how to die for Freedom. Do any\r\n  sigh for a Thermopylæ? They have it in Kansas, for there is to\r\n  be fought the great battle between Freedom and Slavery,--by the\r\n  _ballot-box_, I trust; but I do not forget that all who destroy\r\n  the ballot-box madly invoke the _cartridge-box_.\r\n\r\n  With a farewell to my country, as I seek a foreign land, hoping\r\n  for health long deferred, I give my last thoughts to suffering\r\n  Kansas, with devout prayers that the ruffian Usurpation which now\r\n  treads her down may be peaceably overthrown, and that she may be\r\n  lifted into the enjoyment of freedom and repose.\r\n\r\n      Ever faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  P. S. I entrust this to the pilot, and hope it may reach you.\r\n\r\n  JAMES REDPATH, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVITATION TO DINNER BY AMERICAN MERCHANTS IN PARIS.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE AMERICAN MERCHANTS AT PARIS, APRIL 20, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following correspondence, with its brief introduction, is\r\n    copied from _Galignani’s Messenger_ at Paris.\r\n\r\n        “SENATOR SUMNER, OF MASSACHUSETTS.--This distinguished\r\n        American statesman and orator has been tendered a public\r\n        dinner by the American merchants residing at Paris, in the\r\n        following complimentary terms.\r\n\r\n                                            “PARIS, April 28, 1857.\r\n\r\n        “DEAR SIR,--The American merchants residing in Paris,\r\n        desirous of expressing their high regard and admiration\r\n        for your noble independence and distinguished services as\r\n        a Senator of the United States, respectfully invite you to\r\n        meet them at a public dinner, to be given at such a time\r\n        during your sojourn in Paris as may be most convenient to\r\n        yourself.\r\n\r\n        “Though well aware that you are habitually accustomed to\r\n        decline all similar requests, we earnestly hope you will\r\n        yield to our wishes.\r\n\r\n        “As citizens of the great Republic, representing many\r\n        States, and all actively engaged in commercial life, we\r\n        tender you this tribute, as an evidence of our appreciation\r\n        of your elevated patriotism, unbending integrity, and\r\n        spotless honor.\r\n\r\n        “With the highest esteem, we have the honor to be your\r\n        friends and fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n        “JOHN MUNROE,\r\n        B.

CURTIS.”\r\n\r\n    To this invitation Mr. Sumner returned the following reply.\r\n\r\n                                HÔTEL DE LA PAIX, RUE DE LA PAIX,\r\n                                                  April 30, 1857.\r\n\r\n        GENTLEMEN,--I have been honored by your communication of\r\n        the 28th April, where, after referring to my services\r\n        as Senator of the United States, in language generous\r\n        beyond the ordinary experience of political life, you are\r\n        pleased to invite me, in the name of the American merchants\r\n        residing in Paris, to a public dinner, at such time as may\r\n        be most convenient to myself.\r\n\r\n        The voice of hospitality is pleasant in a strange land.\r\n        But the hospitality which you offer is enhanced by the\r\n        character and number of those who unite in it, among whom\r\n        I recognize well-known names, intimately associated with\r\n        the commerce of my country in one of its most important\r\n        outposts.\r\n\r\n        There is one aspect in which your invitation is especially\r\n        grateful. It is this. If I have been able to do anything\r\n        not unworthy of your approbation, it is because I never\r\n        failed, whether in majorities or minorities, against all\r\n        obloquy, and at every hazard, to uphold those principles of\r\n        Liberty which, just in proportion as they prevail under our\r\n        Constitution, make us an example to the nations. And since\r\n        my public course cannot be unknown to you, I am permitted\r\n        to infer that the public testimony with which you now honor\r\n        me is offered in some measure to those principles,--dearer\r\n        to me than any personal distinction,--with which I am proud\r\n        to know that my name is associated.\r\n\r\n        The invitation you send me, coming from such a source,\r\n        couched in terms so flattering, and possessing such an\r\n        import, presents a temptation difficult to resist. But\r\n        I am admonished by the state of my health, which is yet\r\n        far from its natural vigor, that I must not listen to it,\r\n        except to express my gratitude. In making this excuse,\r\n        let me fortify myself by the confession that I left home\r\n        mainly to withdraw from the excitements of public life, and\r\n        particularly from all public speaking, in the assurance\r\n        that by such withdrawal, accompanied by that relaxation\r\n        which is found in change of pursuit, my convalescence would\r\n        be completed. The good physician under whose advice I have\r\n        acted would not admit that by crossing the sea I had been\r\n        able at once to alter all the conditions under which his\r\n        advice was given.\r\n\r\n        I cannot turn coldly from the opportunity you offer\r\n        me. My heart overflows with best wishes for yourselves\r\n        individually, and also for the commerce which you conduct,\r\n        mingled with aspirations that your influence may always add\r\n        to the welfare and just renown of our country. As American\r\n        merchants at Paris, you are representatives of the United\r\n        States on a foreign mission, without diplomatic salary or\r\n        diplomatic privilege. But it belongs to the felicity of\r\n        your position that what you do well for yourselves will be\r\n        well for your country, and, more than any diplomacy, will\r\n        contribute to strengthen the friendly ties of two powerful\r\n        nations. Pardon the allusion, when I add that you are\r\n        the daily industrious workmen in that mighty loom whose\r\n        frame stands on the coasts of opposite continents, whose\r\n        threads are Atlantic voyages, whose colors are the various\r\n        enterprises and activities of a beneficent commerce,\r\n        and whose well-wrought product is a radiant, speaking\r\n        tissue,--more beautiful to the mind’s eye than any fabric\r\n        of rarest French skill, more marvellous than any tapestry\r\n        woven for kings,--where every color mingles with every\r\n        thread in completest harmony and on the grandest scale, to\r\n        display the triumphs and the blessings of Peace.\r\n\r\n        Accept the assurance of the sincere regard with which I\r\n        have the honor to be, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n            Your faithful servant and fellow-citizen,\r\n\r\n                CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n        To JOHN MUNROE, B. G. WAINWRIGHT, ELLIOT C. COWDIN, Esqrs.,\r\n        and others, American merchants at Paris.\r\n\r\n    The vigilant spirit of Slavery did not fail to note this\r\n    correspondence. Immediately upon its appearance, a well-known\r\n    Virginian, the reputed owner of large plantations in right of\r\n    his wife, and long resident in Paris, addressed a letter to\r\n    _Galignani’s Messenger_, in which he undertook to set forth\r\n    what he called Mr. Sumner’s mission in Europe. Here is a\r\n    specimen.\r\n\r\n        “That mission, certainly ‘without any diplomatic\r\n        privilege,’ but peradventure not without perquisites, is\r\n        to initiate, and, if the exigencies of the cotton market\r\n        and manufacture do not forbid it, to organize, a systematic\r\n        agitation in this and the British capital against the\r\n        Southern States of the Confederacy, and that ‘peculiar\r\n        institution’ of theirs, so tenderly nursed of yore, and\r\n        transmitted to them by dear Old Mother England, and which\r\n        in very modern times has been not less cherished and\r\n        sustained by the ‘enterprise and activity’ on the coast\r\n        of Africa of some of her Puritanical progeny in the New\r\n        World. Under these circumstances can any such subdolous\r\n        plea as that put forward excuse these ‘American merchants’\r\n        from lending themselves to such agencies and influences? If\r\n        they were sordid and self-seeking adventurers, in pursuit\r\n        of _political_ capital, rather than the honorable rewards\r\n        of a liberal and enlightened trade, one could understand,\r\n        or rather would not marvel at, this pseudo-patriotic\r\n        partisanship, this unfraternal display of their _sectional_\r\n        colors in a foreign land.”\r\n\r\n    Thus was the invalid in search of health pursued by the same\r\n    malign spirit from which he had originally suffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR POLITICS SEEN FROM A DISTANCE.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A FRIEND, DATED HEIDELBERG, SEPTEMBER 11, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following letter found its way into the papers of the time.\r\n\r\n                                  HEIDELBERG, September 11, 1857.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR ----,--Weeks have now passed since I have seen a letter\r\n  or newspaper from home. During this time I have been travelling\r\n  away from news, and am now famished. On arrival at Antwerp, I\r\n  trust to find letters at last.\r\n\r\n  I have been ransacking Switzerland; I have visited most of its\r\n  lakes, and crossed several of its mountains, mule-back. My\r\n  strength has not allowed me to venture upon any of those foot\r\n  expeditions, the charm of Swiss travel, by which you reach places\r\n  out of the way; but I have seen much, and have gained health\r\n  constantly.\r\n\r\n  I have crossed the Alps by the St. Gothard, and then recrossed by\r\n  the Grand St. Bernard, passing a night with the monks and dogs.\r\n  I have spent a day at the foot of Mont Blanc, and another on the\r\n  wonderful Lake Leman. I have been in the Pyrenees, in the Alps,\r\n  in the Channel Isles. You will next hear of me in the Highlands\r\n  of Scotland.\r\n\r\n  I see our politics now in distant perspective, and I am more\r\n  than ever satisfied that our course is right. It is Slavery\r\n  which degrades our country, and prevents its example from being\r\n  all-conquering. In fighting our battle at home we fight the\r\n  battle of Freedom everywhere. Be assured, I shall return, not\r\n  only with renewed strength, but with renewed determination to\r\n  give myself to our great cause.\r\n\r\n      Ever sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAREWELL ON SAILING FOR EUROPE A SECOND TIME IN QUEST OF HEALTH.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS, ON BOARD STEAMER VANDERBILT, NEW\r\nYORK HARBOR, MAY 22, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS:--\r\n\r\n  Two years have now passed, since, when in the enjoyment of\r\n  perfect health, I was suddenly made an invalid. Throughout this\r\n  protracted period, amidst various vicissitudes of convalescence,\r\n  I seemed to be slowly regaining the health that had been taken\r\n  from me, until I was encouraged to believe myself on the verge of\r\n  perfect recovery.\r\n\r\n  But injuries so grave as those originally received are not\r\n  readily repaired; and a recent relapse painfully admonishes me,\r\n  that, although enjoying many of the conditions of prosperous\r\n  convalescence, I am not yet beyond the necessity of caution. This\r\n  has been confirmed by the physicians in Boston and Philadelphia\r\n  most familiar with my case, who, in concurrence with counsels\r\n  previously given by medical authorities in Europe, have enjoined\r\n  travel as best calculated to promote restoration. Anxious to\r\n  spare no effort for this end, so long deferred, I to-day sail for\r\n  France.\r\n\r\n  To the generous people of Massachusetts, who have honored me with\r\n  an important trust, and cheered me by so much sympathy, I wish to\r\n  express the thanks which now palpitate in my bosom, while I say\r\n  to them all collectively, as I would say to a friend, Farewell!\r\n\r\n  These valedictory words would be imperfect, if I did not seize\r\n  this occasion to declare, what I have often said less publicly,\r\n  that, had I foreseen originally the duration of my disability,\r\n  I should at once have resigned my seat in the Senate, making\r\n  way for a servant more fortunate in the precious advantages of\r\n  health. I did not do so, because, like other invalids, I lived\r\n  in the belief that I was soon to be well, and was reluctant to\r\n  renounce the opportunity of again exposing the hideous Barbarism\r\n  of Slavery, now more than ever transfused into the National\r\n  Government, infecting its whole policy and degrading its whole\r\n  character. Besides, I was often assured, and encouraged to feel,\r\n  that to every sincere lover of civilization my vacant chair was a\r\n  perpetual speech.\r\n\r\n      CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  ON BOARD STEAMER VANDERBILT, NEW YORK HARBOR, May 22, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONOR TO THE INVENTOR OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO PROFESSOR MORSE, IN EXCUSING HIMSELF FROM A DINNER AT PARIS,\r\nAUGUST 17, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HÔTEL AND RUE DE LA PAIX, PARIS,\r\n                                       Tuesday, August 17, 1858.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--I have fresh occasion to be unhappy that I am\r\n  still an invalid, because it prevents me from joining in the\r\n  well-deserved honors which our countrymen here are about to offer\r\n  you.\r\n\r\n  As I would not be thought indifferent to the occasion, I seize\r\n  the moment to express in this informal manner my humble gratitude\r\n  for the great discovery with which your name will be forever\r\n  associated. Through you Civilization has made one of her surest\r\n  and grandest triumphs, beyond any ever won on a field of battle;\r\n  nor do I go beyond the line of most cautious truth, when I add,\r\n  that, if mankind had yet arrived at a just appreciation of its\r\n  benefactors, it would welcome such a conqueror with more than a\r\n  marshal’s baton.\r\n\r\n  I write to you frankly, and with a still cordial memory of that\r\n  distant day, when, in the company of a friend who is no longer on\r\n  earth, I first had the happiness of taking you by the hand.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, my dear Sir, with much regard,\r\n\r\n      Ever sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  PROFESSOR MORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGING FOR DUTIES OF POSITION.\r\n\r\nFROM A LETTER TO A FRIEND, DATED AT AIX, SAVOY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This extract is taken from the public papers of the time.\r\n\r\n                                  AIX, SAVOY, September 11, 1858.\r\n\r\n  …\r\n\r\n  Look at the map of Europe, and you will find, nestling in the\r\n  mountains of Savoy, between Switzerland and France, the little\r\n  village of Aix, generally known as Aix-les-Bains, from the baths\r\n  which give it fame. There I am now. The country about is most\r\n  beautiful, the people simple and kind.\r\n\r\n  My life is devoted to health. I wish that I could say that I am\r\n  not still an invalid; yet, except when attacked by the pain on my\r\n  chest, I am now comfortable, and enjoy my baths, my walks, and\r\n  the repose and incognito which I find here.\r\n\r\n  I begin the day with _douches_, hot and cold,--and when\r\n  thoroughly exhausted, am wrapped in sheet and blanket, and\r\n  conveyed to my hotel, and laid on my bed. After my walk, I find\r\n  myself obliged again to take to my bed for two hours before\r\n  dinner. But this whole treatment is in pleasant contrast with the\r\n  protracted suffering from fire which made the summer a torment.\r\n  And yet I fear that I must return to that treatment.\r\n\r\n  It is with a pang unspeakable that I find myself thus arrested\r\n  in the labors of life and in the duties of my position. This is\r\n  harder to bear than the fire. I do not hear of friends engaged in\r\n  active service--like Trumbull in Illinois--without a feeling of\r\n  envy.\r\n\r\n  …\r\n\r\n      CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE AND UNITY OF ITALY.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A PUBLIC MEETING AT NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 17, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This meeting was at the City Assembly Rooms, and was addressed\r\n    by Rev.

According to the _New York Tribune_,\r\n    the letter of Mr. Sumner “was received with much enthusiasm.”\r\n\r\n                              SENATE CHAMBER, February 16, 1860.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN,--You do me no more than justice, when you suppose\r\n  that my sympathies are with Italy in her present noble struggle.\r\n  If I do not attend the meeting at New York, according to the\r\n  invitation with which I am honored, it is because other duties\r\n  here keep me away.\r\n\r\n  To the cause of Human Freedom everywhere I am bound by all ties,\r\n  whether of feeling or principle. To Italy also--venerable, yet\r\n  ever young, with that fatal gift of beauty which from all time\r\n  she has worn--I confess a sentiment of love and reverence; I am\r\n  sorrowful in her sorrow, and happy in her happiness.\r\n\r\n  Surely, by her past history, and all that she has done for human\r\n  improvement, we are her debtors. Without Italian genius what\r\n  now were modern civilization? There is no art, or science, or\r\n  activity, or grace, in which she has not excelled or led the\r\n  way. If I went into detail, I must mention not only sculpture,\r\n  painting, engraving, and music, but also astronomy, navigation,\r\n  bookkeeping, and jurisprudence; and I must present an array of\r\n  great names, such as no other country can boast. And to all these\r\n  I must add the practical discoveries of the mariner’s compass,\r\n  the barometer, the telescope applied to astronomy, and the\r\n  pendulum as a measure of time.\r\n\r\n  To the political skeptics and infidels who affect to doubt the\r\n  capacity for freedom of this illustrious people I would say,\r\n  that Italy, in modern times, was the earliest home of political\r\n  science, and the earliest author of some of those political\r\n  truths which have since passed into principles. Besides, divided\r\n  into separate, sovereign States, with separate systems of\r\n  legislation, her condition is coincident with our own, to the\r\n  extent of possessing those local facilities for self-government\r\n  which are our boast. And then there is the spirit of her sons, as\r\n  shown in recent efforts, giving assurance of courage, and of that\r\n  rarer wisdom which knows how to guide and temper courage, both of\r\n  which shone so conspicuous in the Venetian Manin, worthy compeer\r\n  of our own Washington.\r\n\r\n  Allow me to add, that I confidently look to the day when we\r\n  may welcome into the fellowship of nations a community new in\r\n  external form, but old in constituent parts,--separate in local\r\n  governments, but bound in perfect union, with one national flag,\r\n  one national coin, and one national principle, giving to all the\r\n  strength of unity,--_E Pluribus Unum_,--and constituting the\r\n  United States of Italy. And may God speed this good time!\r\n\r\n  Accept the assurance of the respect with which I have the honor\r\n  to be, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO LESSONS FROM THE LIFE OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT ASSOCIATION OF THE FIRST SCHOOL\r\nDISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA, FEBRUARY 21, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SENATE CHAMBER, February 21, 1860.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--It would be a pleasure to be with you at your\r\n  celebration of the Birthday of Washington, according to the\r\n  invitation with which you have honored me. But other duties will\r\n  keep me away.\r\n\r\n  It is always a delight to listen to the praise of Washington,\r\n  particularly when his full life is set forth, and he is shown\r\n  in his real character, ever wise, firm, and true, teaching two\r\n  commanding lessons: first, by the achievements and trials of\r\n  a seven years’ war, that his fellow-countrymen should not be\r\n  willing to be slaves; and, secondly, by the repeated declarations\r\n  of his life, and especially by his great example in his last will\r\n  and testament, that his fellow-countrymen should not be willing\r\n  to be slave-masters. I do not know for which he is to be most\r\n  honored.\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks for the personal kindness of your letter, and\r\n  believe me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE F. GORDON, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACAULAY ON SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION TO THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE, MARCH 3, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same paper contained the article of Macaulay entitled “The West\r\nIndies,” from the _Edinburgh Review_, January, 1825, Vol. XLI. pp.\r\n464-488. The day after its appearance, the New York Herald, in a\r\nleader with the caption, “_Macaulay, Sumner, and Slavery,_” sought to\r\ndisparage the testimony, saying, among other things:--\r\n\r\n    “What Mr. Sumner now introduces is a proof how badly off the\r\n    party must be for weapons, when they rake them up from the\r\n    dead magazines of another generation, and written by a youth\r\n    a little over twenty years of age; or Mr. Sumner has not yet\r\n    recovered his usual strength of mind, since the injury he\r\n    received a few years ago at the Capitol. And what does his\r\n    article amount to? That the British planters in the West Indies\r\n    treated their slaves very badly, which may or may not be true.\r\n    But from the abuse of the institution in one place he argues\r\n    against the policy of its continued existence in any other\r\n    part of the world. He might as well conclude, that, because\r\n    many of the English are cruel to their horses, and that it was\r\n    necessary to pass an Act of Parliament for their protection,\r\n    therefore horses ought to be emancipated in the United States,\r\n    and let loose through the country. An argument from the abuse\r\n    to the disuse of anything is the poorest kind of logic.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the tone of discussion on the eve of the Presidential election\r\ndestined to decide the fate of American Slavery.\r\n\r\n    TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE:--\r\n\r\n    SIR,--I ask attention to an eloquent and characteristic article\r\n    on Slavery, by Macaulay, never yet printed in our country with\r\n    his name. It is in an old number of the “Edinburgh Review,”\r\n    while Jeffrey was its editor, and in point of time preceded\r\n    the famous article on Milton. It is, indeed, the earliest\r\n    contribution of the illustrious writer to that Review, of\r\n    which he became a chief support and ornament. As such, it\r\n    belongs to the curiosities of literature, even if it did not\r\n    possess intrinsic interest from subject and style.\r\n\r\n    Here are seen, no longer in germ, but almost in perfect\r\n    development, those same great elements of style which appear\r\n    in the maturer essays and the History,--mastery of language,\r\n    clearness of statement, force, splendor of illustration, an\r\n    irrepressible sequence of thought and argument, and that same\r\n    whip of scorpions which he afterward flourished over Barère:\r\n    all these are conspicuous in this first effort, where he utters\r\n    the honest, gushing indignation of his soul. Never has Slavery\r\n    inspired speaker or writer to more complete and scornful\r\n    condemnation.\r\n\r\n    The article was called forth by British Slavery in the West\r\n    Indies; but it is just as applicable to American Slavery.\r\n    _Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur._ Every line bears upon\r\n    the slave-drivers of our country, with greater force even than\r\n    upon the slave-drivers of the West Indies; for audacity here\r\n    goes further than it was ever pushed in the British dominions.\r\n    It is interesting to find how exact the parallel becomes. In\r\n    the picture of illiberal men conspiring to support Slavery\r\n    Macaulay seems to delineate us.\r\n\r\n        “The slave-drivers may boast, that, if our cause has\r\n        received support from honest men of all religious and\r\n        political parties, theirs has tended in as great a\r\n        degree to combine and conciliate every form of violence\r\n        and illiberality. Tories and Radicals, prebendaries and\r\n        field-preachers, are to be found in their ranks. The only\r\n        requisites for one who aspires to enlist are a front of\r\n        brass and a tongue of venom.”[9]\r\n\r\n    Aiming to exhibit Slavery in its laws, without dwelling on\r\n    the accumulated instances of cruelty, he puts the case on the\r\n    strongest ground; and here his unimpeachable witness is the\r\n    statute-book itself. But this same argument bears with equal\r\n    force upon _our_ Slavery; so that, in reading his indignant\r\n    exposure of the West India jurisprudence, we see rising\r\n    before us the kindred enormities of our own Slave States, and\r\n    acknowledge the truth of his generous words.\r\n\r\n    He seems also to have anticipated that flagrant sophism, which,\r\n    under the guise of Popular Sovereignty, insists that men shall\r\n    be at liberty--“perfectly free” is the phrase of the Nebraska\r\n    Bill--to buy and sell fellow-men.\r\n\r\n        “If you will adopt the principles of Liberty, adopt them\r\n        altogether. Every argument which you can urge in support\r\n        of your own claims might be employed, with far greater\r\n        justice, in favor of the emancipation of your bondsmen.\r\n        When that event shall have taken place, your demand will\r\n        deserve consideration. At present, what you require under\r\n        the name of Freedom is nothing but unlimited power to\r\n        oppress. It is the freedom of Nero.”[10]\r\n\r\n    The threats of disunion, coming from slave-drivers, are also\r\n    foreshown, and treated with the scorn they merit.\r\n\r\n        “Who can refrain from thinking of Captain Lemuel Gulliver,\r\n        who, while raised sixty feet from the ground on the hand\r\n        of the King of Brobdignag, claps his hand on his sword and\r\n        tells his Majesty that he knows how to defend himself?\r\n        You will rebel!… But this is mere trifling. Are you, in\r\n        point of fact, at this moment able to protect yourselves\r\n        against your slaves without our assistance? If you can\r\n        still rise up and lie down in security,--if you can still\r\n        eat the bread of the fatherless and grind the faces of the\r\n        poor,--if you can still hold your petty Parliaments, and\r\n        say your little speeches, and move your little motions,--if\r\n        you can still outrage and insult the Parliament and people\r\n        of England,--to what do you owe it?”[11]\r\n\r\n    The sensitiveness of slave property--the same in our Slave\r\n    States as in the British West Indies--is aptly described in\r\n    the remark, that a pamphlet of Mr. Stephen or a speech of Mr.\r\n    Brougham is sufficient to excite all the slaves in the colonies\r\n    to rebel. And it is shown that in a servile war the master\r\n    _must_ be loser; for his enemies are his chattels. Whether\r\n    the slave conquer or fall, he is alike lost to the owner. In\r\n    the mean time, the soil lies uncultivated, the machinery is\r\n    destroyed. And when the possessions of the planter are restored\r\n    to him, they have been changed into a desert.[12]\r\n\r\n    Here also is an exhibition of the incompatibility between\r\n    Slavery and Christianity, which ought to be read in every\r\n    Southern pulpit:--\r\n\r\n        “The immorality and irreligion of the slaves are the\r\n        necessary consequences of their political and personal\r\n        degradation. They are not considered by the law as human\r\n        beings.… _They must become men before they can become\r\n        Christians_.… Can a preacher prevail on his hearers\r\n        strictly to fulfil their conjugal duties in a country where\r\n        no protection is given to their conjugal rights,--in a\r\n        country where the husband and wife may, at the pleasure of\r\n        the master or by process of law, be in an instant separated\r\n        forever?… The great body of the colonists have resolutely\r\n        opposed religious instruction; and they are in the right.\r\n        They know, though their misinformed friends in England do\r\n        not know, that Christianity and Slavery cannot long exist\r\n        together.”[13]\r\n\r\n    Such is the philippic against Slavery by the first writer of\r\n    the English language in our day, and one of the first in all\r\n    times. As testimony to a sacred cause, it is priceless; as a\r\n    contribution to literature, it cannot be forgotten. Why it was\r\n    suppressed by American publishers, who gave us the earliest\r\n    collection of Macaulay’s Essays ever printed in England or\r\n    America, I know not. Unhappily, this suppression was too\r\n    much in harmony with the received American system from that\r\n    day to this, whether in publishing Humboldt’s work on Cuba,\r\n    the Bishop of Oxford’s work on the American Church, or the\r\n    engraving of Ary Scheffer’s “Christus Consolator,” from all of\r\n    which the slave is shut out. That this blame may not fall upon\r\n    the author himself, it is important to know that the American\r\n    collection was made without any list supplied by him. In the\r\n    modesty of his nature, he regarded his contributions to Reviews\r\n    as fugitive pieces, which he abandoned to the world, without\r\n    caring to gather them together. It will be for posterity to\r\n    rejudge this judgment.\r\n\r\n    In this statement, I rely upon personal recollection of\r\n    conversations with him. More than twenty years ago--as also\r\n    more recently--I was in the habit of meeting the great writer\r\n    in the society of London; and I remember well how, on one of\r\n    these occasions, when told that an American bookseller proposed\r\n    to publish a collection of his articles, he very positively\r\n    protested against it, and refused to furnish a list. Nor\r\n    is it out of place to add here, that, while his wonderful\r\n    conversation left on the mind an ineffaceable impression of\r\n    eloquence and fulness, perhaps without parallel, it also showed\r\n    a character of singular integrity.\r\n\r\n    This article is not alone in attesting his sympathy with the\r\n    Antislavery cause. The first public appearance of Macaulay,\r\n    while yet a very young man, was at an Antislavery meeting;\r\n    and one of his most stinging speeches, at the maturity of his\r\n    powers, in the House of Commons, bore testimony to the depth\r\n    and constancy of this sentiment.[14] This was natural; for he\r\n    was son of Zachary Macaulay, one of the devoted Abolitionists\r\n    who helped to carry, first, the abolition of the slave-trade,\r\n    and then, at a later day, the abolition of Slavery itself, in\r\n    the British dominions.\r\n\r\n    The services of the father, as friend of the slave, have been\r\n    aptly commemorated by a cenotaph in Westminster Abbey, situated\r\n    in the nave, on the left side of the great door as you enter,\r\n    and close to the imposing monument of Fox. The son now lies\r\n    in the same historic burial-place and beneath the same mighty\r\n    roof,[15] but in Poets’ Corner, distant by more than the whole\r\n    length of the nave from the tablet erected in honor of his\r\n    father. In all that multitude of monuments to the illustrious\r\n    dead, if we except the line of kings, there is but one other\r\n    instance of father and son enshrined in the Abbey, and that is\r\n    Lord Chatham and William Pitt, whose monuments are also distant\r\n    from each other by more than the whole length of the nave.\r\n\r\n    Such is the conspicuous fellowship of the two Pitts and\r\n    the Macaulays, father and son, although most unlike in\r\n    circumstances of life and the services which have secured this\r\n    common foothold of immortality. In each case, the father, even\r\n    with the fame of Lord Chatham, has new glory from the son. The\r\n    resting-places of the two Pitts are known at once on entering\r\n    the Abbey. Hereafter, the stranger, who has stood with grateful\r\n    admiration before the grave of the younger Macaulay, will\r\n    seek with reverent step the simple tribute to his father, the\r\n    Abolitionist,--mindful that the love of Human Freedom in which\r\n    the son was cradled and schooled gave to his character some of\r\n    its best features, and to his career of authorship its earliest\r\n    triumph.\r\n\r\n    My purpose is simply to introduce this new-found testimony\r\n    against Slavery, and not to dwell on the life or character of\r\n    the author. If I followed a hint from him, the way would be\r\n    open. Nobody can forget that in one of his most magnificent\r\n    essays he has availed himself of the interest, transient it may\r\n    have been, created by a newly discovered prose work of Milton,\r\n    and has reminded his readers that the dexterous Capuchins never\r\n    choose to preach on the life and miracles of a Saint till they\r\n    have awakened the devotional feelings of their auditors by\r\n    exhibiting some relic of him,--a thread of his garment, a lock\r\n    of his hair, or a drop of his blood. Here, indeed, is a relic\r\n    of Macaulay; but I venture no further.\r\n\r\n            CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUE OF HORACE MANN.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO DR. SAMUEL G. HOWE, MARCH 5, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the public papers of the time.\r\n\r\n                                  SENATE CHAMBER, March 5, 1860.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR HOWE,--I am glad to know that you are moving in earnest\r\n  for a public statue to Horace Mann.\r\n\r\n  Absence, and not indifference, is my excuse for not associating\r\n  myself at first with this purpose. Though tardily, I do it\r\n  now most sincerely, and with my whole heart. I send you for\r\n  it one hundred dollars; but you will please not to measure my\r\n  interest in this tribute to a public benefactor by the sum which\r\n  I contribute. Were I able, it would be ten times as large. If\r\n  each person in Massachusetts who has been benefited by the vast\r\n  and generous labors of Horace Mann,--each person who hates\r\n  Intemperance, and who hates Slavery,--each person who loves\r\n  Education, and who loves humane efforts for the prisoner, the\r\n  poor, and the insane,--should contribute a mite only, then his\r\n  statue would be of gold. Why not at once appeal to good men, and\r\n  insist upon organization throughout the Commonwealth, reaching\r\n  into every School District, so that all may have an opportunity\r\n  to contribute? Pray do this, and if I can serve you any way\r\n  about it, command me, and believe me,\r\n\r\n      Always yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  P. S.--Mr. Seward, who is not a Massachusetts man, asks me to put\r\n  his name down for fifty dollars.

Though\r\n    warned to enter slowly into the full responsibilities of his\r\n    position, he was constantly moved by incidents arising from\r\n    this agitation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    On the first day of the session, Mr. Mason, of Virginia, moved\r\n    the appointment of a committee “to inquire into the facts\r\n    attending the late invasion and seizure of the armory and\r\n    arsenal of the United States at Harper’s Ferry, in Virginia,\r\n    by a band of armed men,” and the long resolution concluded\r\n    with “power to send for persons and papers.” The Committee\r\n    was appointed, with Mr. Mason as chairman, and, in the course\r\n    of its duties, summoned John Brown, Jr., of Kansas, and F. B.\r\n    Sanborn and James Redpath, of Massachusetts, who severally\r\n    failed to appear. Thaddeus Hyatt, of New York, appeared, but\r\n    refused to testify. Thereupon Mr. Mason reported from his\r\n    committee the following resolution.\r\n\r\n        “Whereas Thaddeus Hyatt, appearing at the bar of the\r\n        Senate, in custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms, pursuant to\r\n        the resolution of the Senate of the 6th of March, instant,\r\n        was required, by order of the Senate then made, to answer\r\n        the following questions, under oath and in writing: ‘1st,\r\n        What excuse have you for not appearing before the select\r\n        committee of the Senate, in pursuance of the summons\r\n        served on you on the 24th day of January, 1860? 2d, Are\r\n        you now ready to appear before said committee, and answer\r\n        such proper questions as shall be put to you by said\r\n        committee?’--time to answer the same being given until\r\n        the 9th day of March following: And whereas, on the said\r\n        last-named day, the said Thaddeus Hyatt, again appearing,\r\n        in like custody, at the bar of the Senate, presented a\r\n        paper, accompanied by an affidavit, which he stated was\r\n        his answer to said questions; and it appearing, upon\r\n        examination thereof, that said Thaddeus Hyatt has assigned\r\n        no sufficient excuse in answer to the question first\r\n        aforesaid, and in answer to said second question has not\r\n        declared himself ready to appear and answer before said\r\n        committee of the Senate, as set forth in said question, and\r\n        has not purged himself of the contempt with which he stands\r\n        charged: Therefore,\r\n\r\n        “_Be it resolved_, That the said Thaddeus Hyatt be\r\n        committed by the Sergeant-at-Arms to the common jail of the\r\n        District of Columbia, to be kept in close custody until\r\n        he shall signify his willingness to answer the questions\r\n        propounded to him by the Senate; and for the commitment and\r\n        detention of the said Thaddeus Hyatt this resolution shall\r\n        be a sufficient warrant.\r\n\r\n        “_Resolved_, That, whenever the officer having the said\r\n        Thaddeus Hyatt in custody shall be informed by said Hyatt\r\n        that he is ready and willing to answer the questions\r\n        aforesaid, it shall be the duty of such officer to deliver\r\n        the said Thaddeus Hyatt over to the Sergeant-at-Arms of the\r\n        Senate, whose duty it shall be again to bring him before\r\n        the bar of the Senate, when so directed by the Senate.”\r\n\r\n    On the question upon its passage, March 12, 1860, Mr. Sumner\r\n    spoke as follows.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--It is related in English parliamentary history, that,\r\non a certain occasion, when the House of Commons was about ordering\r\nthe commitment of a somewhat too famous witness to the custody of the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, the Speaker interfered by volunteering to say, that\r\n“the House ought to pause before they came to a decision upon a point\r\nin which the liberty of the subject was so materially concerned.”[16]\r\nThat same question is now before us. We are to pass on the liberty of a\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nPardon me, if I say that such a question cannot at any time be trivial.\r\nBut it has an unaccustomed magnitude on this occasion, because the\r\ncase is novel in this body; so that what you now do, besides involving\r\nthe liberty of the gentleman at the bar, will establish a precedent,\r\nwhich, in itself, will be a law for other cases hereafter.\r\n\r\nNow, if it be conceded that the Senate is invested with all the\r\nlarge powers claimed by the Houses of Parliament, then I cannot\r\ndoubt its power in the present case, although I might well question\r\nthe expediency of exercising it. But this is notoriously untrue. It\r\nis well known that Parliament is above the constraint of a written\r\nConstitution; and it has been more than once declared--much to the\r\nindignation of our Revolutionary fathers--that it is “omnipotent” to\r\nsuch extent that it can do anything it pleases, except make a man of a\r\nwoman, or a woman of a man. The Senate has no such large powers; it is\r\nnot “omnipotent,” but under the constraint of a written Constitution.\r\nInstead of authority in all possible cases, it has authority only in\r\ncertain specific cases.\r\n\r\nIf the Senate can summon witnesses to its bar, and compel them to\r\ntestify, under pains and penalties, it must be by virtue of powers\r\ndelegated in the Constitution,--I do not say by express grant, but at\r\nleast by positive intendment. I say positive intendment; for nothing is\r\nto be presumed against liberty.\r\n\r\nThere are certain cases in which the power is clear: first, and most\r\nconspicuously, in the trial of impeachments; secondly, in determining\r\nthe elections, returns, and qualifications of its members; and,\r\nthirdly, in punishing its members for disorderly behavior. All these\r\nproceedings are judicial, as well as political, in character, and carry\r\nwith them, as a natural incident, the power to compel witnesses to\r\ntestify.\r\n\r\nBeyond these three cases, which stand on the express words of the\r\nConstitution, there are two other cases, quasi-judicial in character,\r\nwhich, though not supported by express words of the Constitution, have\r\ngrown out of necessity and reason, amounting to positive intendment,\r\nand are sanctioned by precedents. I refer, first, to the inquiry into\r\nan alleged violation of the privileges of this body, as where a copy\r\nof a treaty was furtively obtained and published; and, secondly, to\r\nthe inquiry into conduct of servants of the Senate, like that now\r\nproceeding with regard to the Printer, on the motion of the Senator\r\nfrom New York [Mr. KING]. If I were asked to indicate the principle\r\non which these two cases stood, I should say it was that just and\r\nuniversal right of _self-defence_ inherent in every parliamentary body,\r\nas in every court, and also in every individual, but which is limited\r\nclosely by the simple necessities of the case.\r\n\r\nSuch are the five cases in which this extraordinary power has been\r\nheretofore exercised: the first three standing on the text of\r\nthe Constitution, and the other two on the right of self-defence\r\nnecessarily inherent in the Senate; all five sanctioned by precedents\r\nof this body; all five judicial in character; all five judicial also\r\nin purpose and intent; and all five agreeing in this final particular,\r\nthat they have no legislative purpose or intent. Beyond these cases\r\nthere is no precedent for the exercise by the Senate of the power in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIt is now proposed to add a new case, most clearly without any support\r\nin the Constitution, without any support in the right of _self-defence_\r\ninherent in the Senate, and without any support in the precedents of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nA committee has been appointed to inquire into the facts attending\r\nthe late invasion and seizure of the armory and arsenal at Harper’s\r\nFerry by a band of armed men, and report whether the same was attended\r\nby armed resistance to the authorities and public force of the United\r\nStates, and by the murder of any citizens of Virginia, or of any troops\r\nsent there to protect public property; whether such invasion was made\r\nunder color of any organization intended to subvert the government\r\nof any of the States of the Union; the character and extent of such\r\norganization; _whether any citizens of the United States, not present,\r\nwere implicated therein or accessory thereto, by contributions of\r\nmoney, arms, munitions, or otherwise_; the character and extent of the\r\nmilitary equipment in the hands or under the control of such armed\r\nband; where, how, and when the same was obtained and transported to the\r\nplace invaded; also, to report what legislation, if any, is necessary\r\nby the Government for the future preservation of the peace of the\r\ncountry and the safety of public property; with power to send for\r\npersons and papers.\r\n\r\nAnd this committee, after several weeks of session, now invokes the\r\npower of the Senate to compel the witness to testify. The chairman of\r\nthe committee, the Senator from Virginia [Mr. MASON], who calls for the\r\nimprisonment of an American citizen, has shown no authority for such\r\nan exercise of power in the Constitution, or in the admitted right of\r\nself-defence, or in the precedents of the Senate. He cannot show any\r\nsuch authority. It does not exist.\r\n\r\nSurely, where the Constitution, and reason, and precedent, all three,\r\nare silent, we might well hesitate to exercise a power so transcendent.\r\nBut I shall not stop here. I go further, and point out two specific\r\ndefects in the resolution of the Senate.\r\n\r\n_First._ The inquiry which it institutes is clearly judicial in\r\ncharacter,--without, however, any judicial purpose, or looking to any\r\njudicial end. The committee is essentially a Tribunal, with power of\r\ndenunciation, but without power of punishment,--sitting with closed\r\ndoors, having the secrecy of the Inquisition or the Star Chamber,\r\nor, if you please, the Grand Jury,--with power to investigate facts\r\ninvolving the guilt of absent persons, and to denounce fellow-citizens\r\nas felons and traitors. If such a power is lodged anywhere outside of\r\njudicial tribunals, it must be in the House of Representatives, as\r\nthe Grand Inquest of the Nation, with its power to impeach all civil\r\nofficers, from the President down; but it cannot be in the Senate.\r\nLet me cite an illustration. The Constitution of Maryland provides\r\nexpressly that “the House of Delegates may inquire, on the oath of\r\nwitnesses, into all complaints, grievances, and offences, as the Grand\r\nInquest of the State, and may commit any person for any crime to the\r\npublic jail, there to remain until discharged by due course of law.”\r\nBut I deny that the Senate of that neighbor State can erect itself into\r\na Grand Inquest.\r\n\r\nIf the Senate of the United States have power to make the present\r\ninquiry, then, on any occasion of alleged crime, of whatever nature,\r\nwhether of treason or murder or riot, it may rush to the assistance of\r\nthe grand juries of the District, or, still further, it may rush to the\r\nassistance of the grand juries of Virginia; in short, it will be an\r\ninquest of commanding character, and with far-reaching, all-pervading\r\nprocess, supplementary and ancillary to the local inquest,--or, rather,\r\nso transcendent in powers, that by its side the local inquest will be\r\ndwarfed into insignificance. This cannot be proper or constitutional.\r\nBut perhaps I am especially sensitive on this point; for, as a citizen\r\nof Massachusetts, I cannot forget that her Bill of Rights, originally\r\nthe work of John Adams, provides expressly that the legislative\r\ndepartment shall never exercise judicial powers, and the judicial\r\ndepartment shall never exercise legislative powers,--“to the end,” as\r\nis solemnly declared, “it may be a government of laws, and not of men.”\r\n\r\nBut, assuming that the resolution is defective so far as it constitutes\r\nan inquest into crime, it may be said that the witness should be\r\ncompelled to answer the other parts. Surely, the Senate will not resort\r\nto any such refinement in order to imprison a citizen.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ But there is a broader objection still: that, whatever may\r\nbe the power of the Senate in judicial cases, it cannot compel the\r\ntestimony of a witness in a proceeding of which the declared purpose\r\nis merely legislative. Officers of the Government communicate with\r\nCongress and its committees simply by letter. They are not summoned\r\nfrom distant posts, or even from their offices here. And I know not\r\nwhy a distant citizen, charged with no offence, and in every right the\r\npeer of any office-holder, should be treated with less consideration.\r\nIf information be desired from him for any legislative purpose, let\r\nhim communicate it in the way most convenient to himself, and most\r\nconsistent with those rights of the citizen which all are bound to\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nAt all events, if this power is to be exercised, let it not be under a\r\nsimple resolution of the Senate, but by virtue of a general law, passed\r\nby both Houses, and approved by the President, so that the citizen\r\nshall be surrounded with certain safeguards.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I confidently submit that a power so entirely without\r\nsupport, and also so obnoxious to criticism, at the same time that it\r\nis so vast, is not to be carelessly exercised. You cannot send the\r\nwitness to prison without establishing a new precedent and commencing a\r\nnew class of cases. You will declare that the Senate, at any time,--not\r\nmerely in the performance of admitted judicial duties, but also in\r\nthe performance of mere legislative duties,--may drag a citizen from\r\nthe most distant village of the most distant State, and compel his\r\ntestimony, involving the guilt or innocence of absent persons, or, it\r\nmay be, of the witness himself. This is a fearful prerogative, and\r\npermit me to say, that, in assuming it, you liken yourselves to the\r\nJesuits, at the period of their most hateful supremacy, when it was\r\nsaid that their power was a sword whose handle was at Rome and whose\r\npoint was in the most distant places. You take into your hands a sword\r\nwhose handle will be in this Chamber, to be clutched by a mere partisan\r\nmajority, and whose point will be in every corner of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIf the present case were doubtful, which I do not admit, I feel that\r\nI cannot go wrong, when I lean to the side of Liberty. But, even\r\nadmitting that you have the power, is this the occasion to use it?\r\nIs it, upon the whole, expedient? Is the object to be accomplished\r\nworth the sacrifice? It is well to have a giant’s strength, but it is\r\ntyrannous to use it like a giant.\r\n\r\nFor myself, Sir, I confess a feeling of gratitude to the witness, who,\r\nknowing nothing which he desires to conceal, and chiefly anxious that\r\nthe liberties of all may not suffer through him, feeble in body and\r\nbroken in health, hardly able to endure the fatigue of appearing at\r\nyour bar, now braves the prison which you menace, and thrusts his arm\r\nas a bolt to arrest an unauthorized and arbitrary proceeding.\r\n\r\n    The resolutions were adopted March 12, 1860, and on the same\r\n    day Mr. Hyatt was committed to the common jail of Washington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    On the 15th of June, 1860, Mr. Mason, of Virginia, Chairman of\r\n    the Harper’s Ferry Investigating Committee, in submitting his\r\n    final report, further submitted the following order.\r\n\r\n        “_Ordered_, That Thaddeus Hyatt, a witness confined in\r\n        the jail of this city for refusal to appear and testify\r\n        before said committee, be discharged from custody, and\r\n        that a copy of this order be delivered to the jailer by\r\n        the Sergeant-at-Arms, as his warrant for discharging said\r\n        prisoner.”\r\n\r\n    On the question upon its passage, Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--I welcome with pleasure the proposition for the\r\ndischarge of Mr. Hyatt from his long incarceration in the filthy\r\njail where he has been detained by the order of the Senate. But I am\r\nunwilling that this act of justice should be done to a much injured\r\ncitizen, without for one moment exposing the injustice which he has\r\nreceived at your hands.\r\n\r\nThe case, it seems to me, can be made as plain as a diagram.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget a fundamental difference between the powers of the\r\nHouse of Representatives and the powers of the Senate. It is from the\r\nformer that the Senator from Virginia has drawn his precedents, and\r\nhere is his mistake.\r\n\r\nTo the House of Representatives expressly are given by the Constitution\r\n_inquisitorial_ powers, while no such powers are given to the Senate.\r\nThis is contained in the words, “The House of Representatives\r\nshall have the _sole_ power of impeachment.” Here, then, obviously,\r\nis something delegated to the House, and not delegated to the\r\nSenate,--namely, those inquiries in their nature preliminary to\r\nimpeachment, which may or may not end in impeachment; and since, by\r\nthe Constitution, every “civil officer” of the national government may\r\nbe impeached, the _inquisitorial_ powers of the House may be directed\r\nagainst every “civil officer,” from the President down to the lowest on\r\nthe list.\r\n\r\nThis is an extensive power, but it is confined solely to the House.\r\nStrictly speaking, the Senate has no general _inquisitorial_ powers. It\r\nhas, we know, _judicial powers_ in three cases under the Constitution:--\r\n\r\n1. To try impeachments;\r\n\r\n2. To judge the elections, returns, and qualifications of its members;\r\n\r\n3. To punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the\r\nconcurrence of two thirds, to expel a member.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of these powers, the Senate has the attributes of\r\na court, and, according to established precedents, it may summon\r\nwitnesses and compel their testimony, although it may well be doubted\r\nif a law be not necessary even to the execution of this power.\r\n\r\nBesides these three cases, expressly named in the Constitution, there\r\nare two others, where it has already undertaken to exercise _judicial\r\npowers_, not by virtue of express words, but in _self-defence_:--\r\n\r\n1. With regard to the conduct of its servants, as of its Printer;\r\n\r\n2. When its privileges have been violated, as in the case of William\r\nDuane,[17] by a libel, or in the case of Nugent,[18] by obtaining and\r\ndivulging a treaty while still under seal of secrecy.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that these two classes of cases are not sustained\r\nby any text of the Constitution. If sustained at all, it must be by\r\nthat principle of universal jurisprudence, and also of natural law,\r\nwhich gives to every body, whether natural or artificial, the right\r\nto protect its own existence,--in other words, the great right of\r\nself-defence. And I submit that no principle less solid can sustain\r\nthis exercise of power. It is not enough to say that such a power\r\nwould be _convenient_, highly convenient, or important. _It must be\r\nabsolutely essential to the self-preservation of the body_; and even\r\nthen, in the absence of any law, it must be open in our country to the\r\ngravest doubts.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” says Blackstone, “all arbitrary powers, well executed,\r\nare _the most convenient_.”[19] But _mere convenience_ is not a proper\r\nreason, under a free government, for the assumption of powers not\r\ngranted; and this is especially the case where the powers are arbitrary\r\nand despotic, and touch the liberty of the citizen.\r\n\r\nNow, if the present inquiry were in the House of Representatives, and\r\nwere directed against the President or the Secretary of War, on the\r\nground of negligence or malfeasance at an important moment, it would\r\nbe clearly within the jurisdiction of that body, which has the _sole_\r\npower of impeachment; but it would not come within the jurisdiction\r\nof the Senate, until it became the duty of the latter body to try the\r\nimpeachment instituted by the House.\r\n\r\nBut the present inquiry is neither preliminary to impeachment nor on\r\nthe trial of an impeachment. It has no such element. It is precisely\r\nthe same as if an inquiry should be instituted into the murder of Dr.\r\nBurdell in New York, or into the burning of slaves in Alabama, or into\r\nthe banks of New York, or into the conduct of the Supreme Court of\r\nWisconsin in alleged obstructions of the Fugitive Slave Bill,--with\r\nregard to all which the Senate has no judicial powers. And yet it has\r\njudicial powers in all these cases, precisely to the same extent that\r\nit has in the case of John Brown at Harper’s Ferry.\r\n\r\nI know it is said that this power is necessary _in aid of legislation_.\r\nI deny the necessity. _Convenient_, at times, it may be; but\r\n_necessary_, never. We do not drag members of the Cabinet or the\r\nPresident to testify before a committee, _in aid of legislation_; but\r\nI say, without hesitation, they can claim no immunity which does not\r\nbelong equally to the humblest citizen. Mr. Hyatt and Mr. Sanborn\r\nhave rights as ample as if they were office-holders. Such a power as\r\nthis--which, without the sanction of law, and merely at the will of a\r\npartisan majority, may be employed to ransack the most distant States,\r\nand to drag citizens before the Senate all the way from Wisconsin or\r\nfrom South Carolina--may be convenient, and to certain persons may seem\r\nto be necessary. Throughout all time alleged necessity has been the\r\napology for wrong.\r\n\r\n    “So spake the Fiend, and with _necessity_,\r\n    The tyrant’s plea, excused his devilish deeds.”\r\n\r\nSuch, according to Milton, was the practice among the fallen angels.\r\n\r\nLet me be understood as admitting the power of the Senate, where it is\r\nessential to its own protection or the protection of its privileges,\r\nbut not where it is required merely in aid of legislation. The\r\ndifference is world-wide between what is required for _protection_ and\r\nwhat is required merely for _aid_; and here I part from Senators with\r\nwhom I am proud on other matters to act. They hold that this great\r\npower may be exercised, not merely for the _protection_ of the Senate,\r\nbut also for its _aid_ in framing a bill or in maturing any piece of\r\nlegislation. To aid a committee of this body merely in a legislative\r\npurpose, a citizen, guilty of no crime, charged with no offence,\r\npresumed to be innocent, honored and beloved in his neighborhood, may\r\nbe seized, handcuffed, kidnapped, and dragged away from home, hurried\r\nacross State lines, brought here as criminal, and then thrust into\r\njail. The mere statement of the case shows the dangerous absurdity\r\nof such a claim. “Nephew,” said Algernon Sidney in prison, on the\r\nnight before his execution, “I value not my own life a chip; but what\r\nconcerns me is, that the _law_ which takes away my life may hang every\r\none of you, whenever it is thought convenient.” It was a dangerous\r\n_law_ that aroused the indignation of the English patriot. But in the\r\npresent case there is not even a law,--nothing but an order made by a\r\nfractional part of Congress.\r\n\r\nThere are Senators here who pretend to find in the Constitution\r\nthe right to carry slaves into the National Territories. That such\r\nSenators should also find in the same Constitution the right to make a\r\nslave of Mr. Hyatt or Mr. Sanborn, or of anybody else, merely to aid\r\nlegislation, is not astonishing; but I am at a loss how Senators who\r\nlove Freedom can find any such right in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI say nothing now of precedents from the British Parliament, for\r\nthey are all more or less inapplicable. We live under a written\r\nConstitution, with certain specified powers; and all these are\r\nrestricted by the Tenth Amendment, declaring that “the powers not\r\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by\r\nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the\r\npeople.” But even British precedents have found a critic at home, in\r\nthe late Chief Justice of England, Lord Denman, pronouncing judgment\r\nin the great case of _Stockdale_ v. _Hansard_,[20]--and also in the\r\nwords of an elegant and authoritative historian, whose life has been\r\npassed in one or the other of the two Houses of Parliament: I refer to\r\nLord Mahon, now Earl Stanhope, who, in his History of England, thus\r\nremarks:--\r\n\r\n    “I may observe, in passing, that throughout the reign of George\r\n    the Second the privileges of the House of Commons flourished\r\n    in the rankest luxuriance.… So long as men in authority are\r\n    enabled to go beyond the law, on the plea of their own dignity\r\n    and power, _the_ ONLY _limit to their encroachments will be\r\n    that of the public endurance_.”[21]\r\n\r\nNothing can be more true than this warning. But Lord Brougham has\r\nexpressed himself in words yet stronger, and, if possible, still more\r\napplicable to the present case.\r\n\r\n    “All rights,” says this consummate orator, “are now utterly\r\n    disregarded by the advocates of Privilege, excepting that of\r\n    exposing their own short-sighted impolicy and thoughtless\r\n    inconsistency. Nor would there be any safety for the people\r\n    under their guidance, if unhappily their powers of doing\r\n    mischief bore any proportion to their disregard of what is\r\n    politic and just.”[22]\r\n\r\nWith these observations I quit this question, anxious only that the\r\nrecent Usurpation of the Senate may not be drawn into a precedent\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n    During Mr. Hyatt’s protracted imprisonment, Mr. Sumner visited\r\n    him constantly, and thus became familiar with the condition\r\n    of the jail. This led to the introduction of the following\r\n    resolution, March 13, 1860.\r\n\r\n    “_Resolved_, That the Committee on the District of Columbia\r\n    be directed to consider the expediency of doing something\r\n    to improve the condition of the common jail of the city of\r\n    Washington.”\r\n\r\nBefore the vote on the resolution was taken, Mr. Sumner remarked\r\nthat he had visited the jail, and found it neither more nor less\r\nthan a mere human sty; and since the Senate had undertaken to send a\r\nfellow-creature there, he thought that the least it could do was to see\r\nthat something was done to improve its condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF CUSTOM-HOUSE OATHS.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION IN THE SENATE, MARCH 15, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner submitted the following resolution, which was\r\n    considered by unanimous consent, and agreed to.\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, That the Committee on Finance be instructed to consider\r\nwhether the numerous custom-house oaths, now administered under Acts of\r\nCongress, may not with propriety be abolished, and a simple declaration\r\nbe substituted therefor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON COMMON, AND ITS EXTENSION.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO GEORGE H. SNELLING, ESQ., OF BOSTON, MARCH 26, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Snelling interested himself much with regard to the\r\n    disposition of the lands west of Boston Common, known as\r\n    the “Back Bay Lands,” and owned by the Commonwealth of\r\n    Massachusetts. Beyond a general desire to keep them open, his\r\n    special aim was to have a tidal lake, bordered by avenues\r\n    with trees. In this effort he was aided particularly by John\r\n    A. Andrew, afterwards Governor. Other citizens, including the\r\n    venerable Josiah Quincy, Professor Agassiz, and Dr. Edward\r\n    Jarvis, wrote letters, published at the time, and used before\r\n    the Committee of the Legislature to whom the matter was\r\n    referred. Among these was the following.\r\n\r\n                                 SENATE CHAMBER, March 26, 1860.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--I am grateful for your timely intervention to save\r\n  our Boston Common, by keeping it open to the western breezes\r\n  and the setting sun. It is not pleasant, I know, to separate in\r\n  opinion from those about us; but your object is so disinterested,\r\n  so pure, so benevolent, so truly in the nature of a charity, that\r\n  all, even though differing in details, must be glad that you have\r\n  come forward.\r\n\r\n  I know well the value of water in scenery. Perhaps nothing\r\n  else adds so much to the effect of a landscape, which, indeed,\r\n  without water often seems lifeless, or, as was once said by\r\n  a valued friend of mine, “like a face without eyes.” Boston,\r\n  from its peninsular situation, cannot be entirely deprived of\r\n  this picturesque feature. It seems to me, however, that, in\r\n  a region like that now in question, we should hesitate long\r\n  before renouncing the opportunity of adding to its attractions\r\n  by a piece of water, which, from perennial supply, would always\r\n  prove an ornament of unsurpassed beauty, as well as a place of\r\n  recreation, and a source of health.\r\n\r\n  On this it is useless to enlarge. All who have ever stood on\r\n  Boston Common will easily see how much this pleasant retreat\r\n  must lose in charm, when its great western vista is closed;\r\n  and all who have ever speculated on the probable growth of our\r\n  metropolis, and the longing of a crowded population for fresh\r\n  air, will recognize the necessity for open spaces, which will be\r\n  _outdoor ventilators_.\r\n\r\n  Boston is already growing in every direction. A wise forecast,\r\n  if not able at once to provide all the means needful for its\r\n  salubrity and adornment, will at least avoid embarrassing the\r\n  future, when half a million of souls have built their homes about\r\n  the ancient Trimountain.\r\n\r\n  Our Common has been ample enough for the past; but the metropolis\r\n  has already outgrown it in every respect. Besides being too\r\n  narrow in proportions, it is wanting in those accessories of\r\n  beauty and of knowledge especially illustrative of Natural\r\n  History, which, according to the experience of other countries,\r\n  are proper for public grounds. I wish much to see there, among\r\n  other things, an arboretum, where every tree that can bear our\r\n  climate shall find its classified place,--pleasing the eye by its\r\n  beauty, protecting the body by its shade, and speaking to all by\r\n  the voice of Science.\r\n\r\n  Accept the thanks of an absent citizen, who never thinks of his\r\n  native Boston without a yearning to see it foremost in all that\r\n  contributes to a true civilization; and believe me to be, my dear\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\n      Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  To GEORGE H. SNELLING, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTEMPT TO KIDNAP A CITIZEN UNDER ORDER OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF FRANK B. SANBORN, OF CONCORD, MASSACHUSETTS, WITH SPEECHES\r\nIN THE SENATE, APRIL 10, 13, AND 16, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The case of Mr. Sanborn illustrates the reach of the Slave\r\n    Power, and the extent to which the Senate did its bidding, at\r\n    the instance of the author of the Fugitive Slave Bill. It is\r\n    one of the skirmishes in the warfare with Slavery.\r\n\r\n    April 10, 1860, Mr. Sumner presented the memorial of Mr.\r\n    Sanborn, which he explained as follows.\r\n\r\nI have a memorial, Mr. President, from Frank B. Sanborn, of Concord,\r\nMassachusetts, setting forth a gross attempt to kidnap, by men\r\npretending to act in the name of the Senate of the United States. The\r\nmemorial is authenticated by his affidavit before a notary public. It\r\nsets forth, that, on the evening of the 3d of April, certain persons,\r\nwho had been prowling about his neighborhood, under shelter of night,\r\nwith fraudulent pretence drew him to his door, seized him, handcuffed\r\nhim, and then by force undertook to convey him to a carriage. By the\r\ncourageous interposition of a refined lady, his sister, neighbors were\r\naroused; the village was next summoned by the ringing of bells, and at\r\nlength that great friend of the oppressed in our country, the writ of\r\n_Habeas Corpus_, arrived on the ground. By intervention of that writ he\r\nwas taken from the custody of the kidnappers. The next day a hearing\r\nwas had before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts; and Chief Justice\r\nShaw, for thirty years the honored Chief Justice of Massachusetts,\r\nwhose opinions are respected in every part of the country, representing\r\nthe full bench, without undertaking to pass upon the question of\r\njurisdiction in the Senate, went on to declare that the power delegated\r\nto its Sergeant-at-Arms could not be delegated to another, and that\r\ntherefore all these proceedings were void, and the prisoner was\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, this act, it seems to me, is conspicuous, both from\r\nthe person against whom it was directed and the place where it was\r\nattempted. It was directed against Mr. Sanborn, a quiet citizen engaged\r\nin the instruction of youth, a scholar of excellent attainments, of\r\nperfect purity, and much beloved by friends and neighbors. It was\r\nattempted at Concord, where another seizure was once attempted, which\r\nbegan that revolutionary contest that ended in Independence. I affirm,\r\nMr. President, that a person like Mr. Sanborn, having suffered this\r\noutrage at the hands of persons claiming to act in the name of the\r\nSenate, has a right to redress in this body: and I assert, still\r\nfurther, that this body owes something to its own character; it ought\r\nto wash its hands of such an outrage. I offer his memorial, and ask its\r\nreference to the Committee on the Judiciary, and, that the Senate may\r\nbetter understand it, I think it ought to be printed. I move also its\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Mason, of Virginia, Chairman of the Harper’s Ferry\r\n    Committee, made an explanation of the attempt to arrest Mr.\r\n    Sanborn, in the course of which he said: “This man Sanborn was\r\n    in correspondence either with the man who was not long since\r\n    hung in Virginia for his conduct as a traitor and murderer\r\n    at Harper’s Ferry, or with some of his associates, I do not\r\n    recollect which.” At the call of Mr. Fessenden the memorial was\r\n    read, when Mr. Sumner said, in reply to Mr. Mason:--\r\n\r\nI merely wish to correct one error into which the Senator has fallen.\r\nHe states that Mr. Sanborn was taken from the custody of those\r\npretended officers by a mob. Now nothing is within my knowledge except\r\nwhat is authenticated by that memorial under oath, and there the\r\nstatement is express that he was not taken from the custody of these\r\npretended officers except by the intervention of the writ of _Habeas\r\nCorpus_, sustained by the _posse comitatus_ of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Mason having stated that he expected a return of the\r\n    officer, at his suggestion the memorial was laid on the table\r\n    to await that return. To this Mr. Sumner consented, as he\r\n    declared, with great reluctance, and with the understanding\r\n    that then it should be referred.\r\n\r\n    April 13, 1860, Mr. Sumner presented additional papers in the\r\n    case. After reading these, he said:--\r\n\r\nThere, Sir, is the official response to the assertion of the Senator\r\nfrom Virginia. The Senator says that Mr. Sanborn was rescued by a mob.\r\nIt is true there was a mob in Concord. It was a mob of kidnappers, who\r\nwent there in the name of the Senate of the United States to seize a\r\ncitizen of Massachusetts. I have here a letter which I have received\r\nfrom a prominent citizen of Concord, present at the time. This is his\r\nstatement:--\r\n\r\n     “No rescue by the crowd was made or attempted, till the writ\r\n    of _Habeas Corpus_ was served; and this, even, Carleton and his\r\n    fellows resisted, till the deputy sheriff was obliged to use\r\n    force to take Mr. Sanborn from him.… The arrest was as brutal,\r\n    cowardly, and outrageous a proceeding as I ever knew in seven\r\n    years’ experience as sheriff of that county.”\r\n\r\nSir, it is not unnatural that an arrest made under such circumstances\r\nshould have attracted attention in that town and throughout\r\nMassachusetts. It did so. It has excited a feeling of indignation\r\nagainst this attempt, increased, perhaps, when people put the question,\r\n“Why all this effort to seize Mr. Sanborn? Why this overthrow of law to\r\naccomplish such a purpose?”\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that there is a citizen of Virginia, formerly chief\r\nmagistrate of that State, who has openly avowed that he knew much in\r\nregard to the very matters in inquiry before that committee, and that\r\nrubies could not bribe him to disclose it. He has thrown the challenge\r\ndown to that committee and this Senate, before the whole country,\r\nrefusing openly to testify; and yet that committee make no motion to\r\nbring Ex-Governor Wise before the Senate, and compel him to testify.\r\nInstead, the committee seeks a Northern man, Mr. Hyatt, now in jail,\r\nand another Northern man, Mr. Sanborn, who it is well understood know\r\nnothing of the matter; and it follows up Mr. Sanborn by an attempt\r\nwhich I characterize here as simply an act of kidnapping.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Mason, in reply, insisted, at some length, that Mr. Sumner\r\n    could have no information on the action of the committee, which\r\n    had not yet reported. To this Mr. Sumner rejoined:--\r\n\r\nMr. President, I profess to have no information except what is open to\r\nall the world; and there are two things open to all the world, through\r\nthe public press: first, that the Ex-Governor of Virginia has more\r\nthan once declared that he had important information in reference to\r\nthe matter before the committee, and that rubies would not tempt him\r\nto disclose it; and, secondly, it is known that the Ex-Governor of\r\nVirginia has not been brought to Washington, as Mr. Hyatt has been, and\r\nas an attempt has been made to bring Mr. Sanborn. No kidnappers have\r\nbeen sent into Virginia, nor handcuffs put upon Ex-Governor Wise.\r\n\r\n    April 16, 1860, Mr. Mason presented to the Senate the warrant\r\n    for the arrest of Mr. Sanborn, with the return of the Deputy\r\n    Marshal of Massachusetts to whom it was addressed, and\r\n    moved its reference to the Committee on the Judiciary, with\r\n    instructions to inquire and report whether any, and what,\r\n    further proceedings were necessary to vindicate the authority\r\n    of the Senate and to effect the arrest of the witnesses. This\r\n    motion was agreed to. Mr. Sumner then moved that the memorial\r\n    of Mr. Sanborn, with the additional papers, be taken from\r\n    the table and referred to the same committee. Here Mr. Mason\r\n    promptly interposed the very unusual motion _that the memorial\r\n    be rejected_. The Chair decided that the motion “to reject”\r\n    could not take precedence, and therefore the motion to refer\r\n    was first in order. Then it was that Mr. Sumner spoke as\r\n    follows.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I think that I ought not to listen to such a proposition\r\nas has been made by the Senator from Virginia with reference to\r\nthis memorial, without one word in reply. Here is a memorial from a\r\ngentleman of perfect respectability, charged with no crime, presumed\r\nto be innocent, complaining of gross outrage at the hands of certain\r\npersons pretending to act in the name of the Senate. The facts are duly\r\nset forth. They are authenticated also by documents now of record. The\r\nSenator moves--without any reference to a committee, without giving\r\nthe petition the decency of a hearing, according to the ordinary forms\r\nof this body--that the memorial be “rejected”; and he makes this\r\nunaccustomed motion with a view to establish a precedent in such a\r\ncase. I feel it my duty to establish a precedent also in this case,\r\nby entering an open, unequivocal protest against such attempt. Sir,\r\nan ancient poet said of a judge in hell, that he punished first and\r\nheard afterwards,--“_castigatque auditque_”; and, permit me to say, the\r\nSenator from Virginia, on this occasion, takes a precedent from that\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n    To this protest Mr. Mason replied: “The Senator from\r\n    Massachusetts, it seems to me, makes an opportunity to use\r\n    language in the Senate Chamber which, so far as my intercourse\r\n    with the world goes, is not usual out of the Senate Chamber.\r\n    There is nothing in it that I have a right to take as\r\n    personally offensive to myself. The Senate is the proper judge\r\n    and arbiter of the decorum of its own proceedings.”\r\n\r\n    Then ensued a debate on the return, in which Mr. Bayard, of\r\n    Delaware, and Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, took part, when Mr.\r\n    Sumner, at last obtaining the floor, remarked as follows.\r\n\r\nOnly one word. I presented a memorial to this body, setting forth\r\nan outrage. The Senator from Virginia moved its rejection, while he\r\nproposed that the case should be proceeded with. I characterized that\r\nmotion as I thought I was authorized to do, referring to a precedent\r\nof antiquity, and that was all; and this is the occasion for a lecture\r\nfrom the Senator on the manner in which one should conduct on this\r\nfloor. From the heights of his self-confidence he addresses me. Sir, I\r\nwish to say simply, in reply, that, when an outrage comes before this\r\nbody, I shall denounce it in plain terms; and if a precedent from a\r\nvery bad place seems to be in point, I shall not hesitate to quote it.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Mason rejoined: “I did not undertake to lecture the\r\n    Senator, of all others, upon the subject of manners or\r\n    propriety. I do not mean it offensively, but, for my own\r\n    convenience, I should consider it time thrown away. All that I\r\n    said was, that I was not accustomed, in my intercourse with the\r\n    world outside of this Chamber, to hear language of that sort in\r\n    the circles in which I move.”\r\n\r\n    April 17, 1860, the memorial of Mr. Sanborn was referred to the\r\n    Judiciary Committee, according to the motion of Mr. Sumner.\r\n\r\n    June 7, Mr. Bayard, of Delaware, from the Committee on\r\n    the Judiciary, to whom was referred the return of the\r\n    Deputy-Marshal and the other papers, reported a “Bill\r\n    concerning the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate and the\r\n    Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives,” authorizing\r\n    the appointment of deputies. This was intended to meet the\r\n    decision of Chief Justice Shaw, of Massachusetts.[23]\r\n\r\n    June 15, Mr. Bayard moved to proceed with the consideration\r\n    of his bill. The motion was not agreed to,--there being, on a\r\n    division, ayes 22, noes 25. This was the end of that bill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    This incident was much noticed by the Northern press,\r\n    especially in Massachusetts. The Boston _Atlas and Bee_\r\n    expressed itself thus:--\r\n\r\n        “In our opinion the people of the Free States are never\r\n        better satisfied with their representatives than when they\r\n        see them repelling indignantly and manfully the arrogant\r\n        insults of the slave-driving aristocracy. It will not\r\n        diminish their attachment to Mr. Sumner, when they take\r\n        notice that his rebuke of Mr. Mason was not in reply to\r\n        any insult upon himself, but upon one of his outraged and\r\n        abused constituents.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETITIONS AGAINST SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE SENATE, APRIL 18, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The treatment of these petitions illustrates the tyranny of the\r\n    Slave Power to the very eve of its fall. Such an incident is\r\n    not without historic significance.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--I present the petition of Henry Elwell, Jr., and\r\nfour hundred and fifty-five others, of Manchester, in Massachusetts,\r\nearnestly petitioning Congress to repeal the Fugitive Slave Act\r\nof 1850,--to abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia, and\r\nin the United States Territories,--to prohibit the inter-State\r\nslave-trade,--and to pass a resolution pledging Congress against\r\nthe admission of any Slave State into the Union, the acquisition of\r\nany Slave Territory, and the employment of any slaves by any agent,\r\ncontractor, officer, or department of the National Government; also,\r\na like petition of Alvan Howes and fifty-five others, of Barnstable,\r\nMassachusetts; also, a like petition of John Clement and one hundred\r\nand nineteen others, of Townsend, Massachusetts; also, a like\r\npetition of Samuel L. Rockwood and seventy-three others, of Weymouth,\r\nMassachusetts; also, a like petition of J. H. Browne and sixty-four\r\nothers, of Sudbury, Massachusetts; also, a like petition of Daniel\r\nHosmer and ninety-eight others, of Sterling, Massachusetts; also, a\r\nlike petition of Albert Gould and one hundred and thirty-one others\r\nof Leicester, Massachusetts; also, a like petition of James M. Evelett\r\nand two hundred others, of Princeton, Massachusetts; also, a like\r\npetition of Daniel Otis and seventy-nine others, of South Scituate,\r\nMassachusetts; also, a like petition of Calvin Cutter and eighty-four\r\nothers, of Warren, Massachusetts; also, a like petition of R. W. French\r\nand thirty others, of Lawrence, Massachusetts; also, a like petition\r\nof Edmund H. Sears and two hundred and forty-five others, of Wayland,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThese several petitions I now present. On a former occasion, during\r\nthis session, a similar petition presented by me was laid upon the\r\ntable. A similar petition presented by another Senator was referred to\r\nthe Committee on the Judiciary. An authoritative precedent, established\r\nafter debate, since I have been in the Senate, seems to be the best\r\nguide on this occasion. That was on a memorial from four thousand\r\ncitizens of Boston, praying the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act.\r\nAfter ample consideration, during which much was said against the\r\nmemorialists, no proposition was made to lay their prayer on the table.\r\nFollowing that precedent, and another established during the present\r\nsession, I move that all these petitions be referred to the Committee\r\non the Judiciary.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Mason, of Virginia, at once moved that the petitions lie on\r\n    the table, thus precluding debate and stifling action. The yeas\r\n    and nays were ordered on motion of Mr. Sumner, and resulted as\r\n    follows, 25 yeas and 19 nays:--\r\n\r\n    YEAS,--Messrs. Bayard, Bragg, Chesnut, Clay, Clingman,\r\n    Crittenden, Davis, Fitch, Fitzpatrick, Gwin, Hemphill, Hunter,\r\n    Iverson, Johnson of Arkansas, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy,\r\n    Lane, Latham, Mason, Nicholson, Polk, Rice, Sebastian,\r\n    Slidell, and Thomson,--25.\r\n\r\n    NAYS,--Messrs. Bingham, Cameron, Chandler, Clark, Collamer,\r\n    Dixon, Doolittle, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Hale, Hamlin, King,\r\n    Seward, Sumner, Trumbull, Wade, Wilkinson, and Wilson,--19.\r\n\r\n    So the petitions were ordered to lie on the table. The\r\n    Democrats all voted yea; the Republicans all voted nay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFETY OF PASSENGERS IN STEAMSHIPS FOR CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION AND REMARKS IN THE SENATE, MAY 21, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    May 21, 1860, Mr. Sumner introduced the following resolution.\r\n\r\n    “_Resolved_, That the Committee on Commerce be instructed to\r\n    consider the expediency of further action, in order to secure\r\n    proper accommodations and proper safety for passengers on\r\n    board the steamers between New York and San Francisco, and to\r\n    increase the efficacy of the existing passenger laws of the\r\n    United States in their application to California passengers;\r\n    with liberty to report by bill or otherwise.”\r\n\r\n    The Senate, by unanimous consent, proceeded to consider the\r\n    resolution.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--I see the Senator from California [Mr. LATHAM] in his\r\nplace, and I very gladly take the opportunity of calling his attention\r\nparticularly to the resolution which I now have the honor to offer.\r\nBy a communication in the newspapers, from a distinguished source,--a\r\nclergyman, who, during the last two months, sailed from Boston to\r\nSan Francisco,[24]--it appears that the steamers are overloaded with\r\npassengers, and without adequate accommodations of other kinds for\r\nsafety. His statement on the subject is explicit, and has been made\r\nin the newspapers, as also in private letters to his friends. I do\r\nnot know that the evil can be reached by any additional legislation;\r\nperhaps no additional legislation is needed; but it is an evil which\r\nshould be remedied in some way, or else we shall be startled some\r\nmorning by the news of a great calamity,--the loss of one of these\r\nsteamers, with, it may be, a thousand passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDIDATES WHO ARE A PLATFORM.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A RATIFICATION MEETING AT BUFFALO, NEW YORK, MAY 30, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This was addressed to a meeting at Buffalo for the ratification\r\n    of the nomination of Abraham Lincoln as President and Hannibal\r\n    Hamlin as Vice-President.\r\n\r\n                                  SENATE CHAMBER, May 30, 1860.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--My duties here will not allow me to be with you at\r\n  Buffalo; but I shall unite with you in every generous word\r\n  uttered for Freedom, and in every pledge of enthusiastic support\r\n  to the Republican candidates.\r\n\r\n  We have a Platform of noble principles, and candidates, each\r\n  of whom, through his well-known principles and integrity of\r\n  character, is a Platform in himself.\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks for the honor of your invitation, and believe\r\n  me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  A.

On their being silent, I\r\n    asked, What had induced them to mutiny? They answered, _I was\r\n    a great rogue to buy them_ in order to carry them away from\r\n    their own country, and that they were resolved to regain their\r\n    liberty, if possible.--SNELGRAVE, _New Account of some Parts of\r\n    Guinea and the Slave-Trade_, p. 170.\r\n\r\n    A system of concubinage was practised among them worse than the\r\n    loose polygamy of the savages: the savage had as many women as\r\n    consented to become his wives; the colonist as many as he could\r\n    enslave. There is an ineffaceable stigma upon the Europeans in\r\n    their intercourse with those whom they treat as inferior races;\r\n    there is a perpetual contradiction between their lust and\r\n    their avarice. The planter will one day take a slave for his\r\n    harlot, and sell her the next as a being of some lower species,\r\n    a beast of labor. If she be indeed an inferior animal, what\r\n    shall be said of the one action? If she be equally with himself\r\n    a human being and an immortal soul, what shall be said of the\r\n    other? Either way there is a crime committed against human\r\n    nature.--SOUTHEY, _History of Brazil_, Chap. VIII., Vol. I. p.\r\n    258.\r\n\r\n    Negro slavery exists in no part of the world without\r\n    producing indolence, licentiousness, and inhumanity in\r\n    the whites; and these vices draw after them their earthly\r\n    punishment,--to look no farther into their fearful, but assured\r\n    consequences.--IBID., Chap. XLIV., Vol. III. p. 816.\r\n\r\n    I had observed much, and heard more, of the cruelty of masters\r\n    towards their negroes; but now I received an authentic account\r\n    of some horrid instances thereof. The giving a child a slave of\r\n    its own age to tyrannize over, to beat and abuse out of sport,\r\n    was, I myself saw, a common practice. Nor is it strange, being\r\n    thus trained up in cruelty, they should afterwards arrive at\r\n    so great perfection in it; that Mr. Star, a gentleman I often\r\n    met at Mr. Lasserre’s, should, as he himself informed L., first\r\n    nail up a negro by the ears, then order him to be whipped in\r\n    the severest manner, and then to have scalding water thrown\r\n    over him, so that the poor creature could not stir for four\r\n    months after. Another much applauded punishment is drawing\r\n    their slaves’ teeth. One Colonel LYNCH is universally known to\r\n    have cut off a poor negro’s legs, and to kill several of them\r\n    every year by his barbarities.--REV.

You are only to consider what\r\n    subsistence to allow them and what labor to exact of them\r\n    will subserve my interest. According to the most accurate\r\n    calculation I can make, the proportion of subsistence and\r\n    labor which will work them up in six years upon an average\r\n    is the most profitable to the planter. And this allowance,\r\n    surely, is very humane; for we estimate here the lives of our\r\n    coal-heavers, upon an average, at only two years, … and our\r\n    soldiers and seamen no matter what.--_A West-India Planter’s\r\n    Instructions for his Overseers_: JOHN ADAMS, _Works_, Vol. X.\r\n    pp. 339, 340.\r\n\r\n    The unfortunate man would have been tried upon five other\r\n    indictments, some of them still more atrocious than the one\r\n    upon which he was found guilty; and his general character for\r\n    barbarity was so notorious that no room was left for me even to\r\n    deliberate. His victims have been numerous; some of them were\r\n    even buried in their chains, and there have been found upon\r\n    the bones taken from the grave chains and iron rings of near\r\n    forty pounds’ weight.… He had been three times married, has\r\n    left several children; he had been in the Army, had a liberal\r\n    education, and lived in what is called the great world. His\r\n    manners and address were those of a gentleman.

I entreat your attention, while I plead the general\r\n    cause of humanity. In such a cause it is right to appeal to\r\n    your sensibility as well as your reason. It is now no longer\r\n    time to flatter petty tyrants by acknowledging that color\r\n    constitutes a legitimate title for holding men in abject and\r\n    perpetual bondage.

XVIII. sec. 2, Vol. I.\r\n    p. 457.\r\n\r\n    The Kentuckian delights in violent bodily exertion; he is\r\n    familiar with the use of arms, and is accustomed from a very\r\n    early age to expose his life in single combat.… Were I inclined\r\n    to continue this parallel, I could easily prove that almost all\r\n    the differences which may be remarked between the characters of\r\n    the Americans in the Southern and in the Northern States have\r\n    originated in Slavery.--IBID., pp. 467, 468.\r\n\r\n    I visited our State Penitentiary a short time since, and\r\n    from my own personal observation I am led to the inevitable\r\n    conclusion that the plan of sending our slaves to the\r\n    Penitentiary, as a _punishment_ for crime, is exactly the\r\n    reverse: it is rather a reward than punishment. “Let sober\r\n    reason judge.”\r\n\r\n    We punish offenders to prevent crime. I would ask any\r\n    reasonable man, Is the sending a slave of any of our farms\r\n    to the Penitentiary a punishment? The white man is punished\r\n    by being deprived of his liberty for that length of time:\r\n    what liberty is the slave deprived of? He has as much, and\r\n    oftentimes _more_, liberty within the walls of the Penitentiary\r\n    than on any of those large sugar or cotton plantations. Then\r\n    where is the punishment? We send white men there, and the dread\r\n    of going is a _stain_ on his character: what character has\r\n    the negro to lose? Hence we must come to the conclusion that\r\n    sending negro slaves to the Penitentiary is not a punishment.\r\n\r\n    A moment’s reflection will convince any man who has ever had\r\n    the management of negroes on a plantation, that the well-being\r\n    and safety of societies demand that any offence committed by\r\n    a negro, for which the _lash_ is not a sufficient punishment,\r\n    _death_ should be the penalty.\r\n\r\n    Taking these things into consideration, would it not be just\r\n    and laudable to sell all negroes now in the Penitentiary to\r\n    the highest bidder, on or about the first of November next,\r\n    by the Sheriff of the Parish of East Baton Rouge, on the same\r\n    terms and conditions that negroes are sold at present, under\r\n    an ordinary _fi. fa._, and, as near as can be, two thirds of\r\n    the net proceeds of each negro be paid to the former owners or\r\n    their legal representatives, the balance be and remain in the\r\n    State Treasury for ordinary purposes?--_Weekly Advocate_, Baton\r\n    Rouge, La., Jan. 17, 1858.\r\n\r\n    A very large edition of this speech was printed at Washington,\r\n    immediately after its delivery. Another appeared at Boston,\r\n    with a portrait; and another at San Francisco, with the\r\n    Republican Platform. While the Rebellion was still warring on\r\n    the National Government, an edition was brought out in New York\r\n    by the “Young Men’s Republican Union,” to which Mr. Sumner\r\n    prefixed a Dedication to the Young Men of the United States,\r\n    which will be found in its proper place, according to date, in\r\n    this collection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A letter from that devoted friend of the Slave, the late George\r\n    L. Stearns, of Boston, under date of March 1st, 1860, shows\r\n    something of the outside prompting under which Mr. Sumner spoke.\r\n\r\n        “I have just read ----’s speech. He stands up to the mark\r\n        _well_, for a politician; but we want one who believes a\r\n        Man is greater than a President, and who would not lift\r\n        his finger to obtain the best office in the gift of our\r\n        nation, to raise this question above the political slough\r\n        into its true position. Charles O’Conor, in his late speech\r\n        in New York, affirmed, that, ‘if Slavery were not a wise\r\n        and beneficent institution for the black as well as the\r\n        white, it could not be defended.’ We want you to take up\r\n        the gauntlet that he has thrown down so defiantly.”\r\n\r\n    A letter from William H. Brooks, of Cambridgeport,\r\n    unconsciously harmonized with Mr. Stearns.\r\n\r\n        “Feeling that our nation is now in the very throes of her\r\n        deliverance, and I trust her prompt deliverance, from\r\n        bondage to her, not Thirty, but Three Hundred Thousand\r\n        Tyrants, may I frankly say, that, if not inconsistent with\r\n        your health and safety, which are on no consideration to\r\n        be perilled, you could aid more than any single person,\r\n        or score of them, in effectually accomplishing the\r\n        great triumph.… The unseen forces of public opinion are\r\n        gathering and forming for the great November conflict. Your\r\n        long, enforced, and martyr silence will give a depth of\r\n        impression and moving power and ten thousand echoes to your\r\n        words beyond their accustomed might.”\r\n\r\n    Something about the menace of violence after this speech, with\r\n    illustrations of its reception at the time, is postponed to an\r\n    Appendix.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Kansas was not admitted as a State into the Union until January\r\n    29, 1861, after the slaveholding Senators had withdrawn to\r\n    organize the Rebellion, when the bill on which the present\r\n    speech was made became a law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH.\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--Undertaking now, after a silence of more than four\r\nyears, to address the Senate on this important subject, I should\r\nsuppress the emotions natural to such an occasion, if I did not\r\ndeclare on the threshold my gratitude to that Supreme Being through\r\nwhose benign care I am enabled, after much suffering and many changes,\r\nonce again to resume my duties here, and to speak for the cause so\r\nnear my heart. To the honored Commonwealth whose representative I\r\nam, and also to my immediate associates in this body, with whom I\r\nenjoy the fellowship which is found _in thinking alike concerning the\r\nRepublic_,[25] I owe thanks which I seize the moment to express for\r\nindulgence extended to me throughout the protracted seclusion enjoined\r\nby medical skill; and I trust that it will not be thought unbecoming\r\nin me to put on record here, as an apology for leaving my seat so long\r\nvacant, without making way, by resignation, for a successor, that I\r\nacted under the illusion of an invalid, whose hopes for restoration to\r\nnatural health continued against oft-recurring disappointment.\r\n\r\nWhen last I entered into this debate, it became my duty to expose the\r\nCrime against Kansas, and to insist upon the immediate admission of\r\nthat Territory as a State of this Union, with a Constitution forbidding\r\nSlavery. Time has passed, but the question remains. Resuming the\r\ndiscussion precisely where I left it, I am happy to avow that rule\r\nof moderation which, it is said, may venture to fix the boundaries\r\nof wisdom itself. I have no personal griefs to utter: only a vulgar\r\negotism could intrude such into this Chamber. I have no personal wrongs\r\nto avenge: only a brutish nature could attempt to wield that vengeance\r\nwhich belongs to the Lord. The years that have intervened and the\r\ntombs that have opened[26] since I spoke have their voices, too, which\r\nI cannot fail to hear. Besides, what am I, what is any man among the\r\nliving or among the dead, compared with the question before us? It is\r\nthis alone which I shall discuss, and I begin the argument with that\r\neasy victory which is found in charity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Crime against Kansas stands forth in painful light. Search history,\r\nand you cannot find its parallel. The slave-trade is bad; but even this\r\nenormity is petty, compared with that elaborate contrivance by which,\r\nin a Christian age and within the limits of a Republic, all forms of\r\nconstitutional liberty were perverted, all the rights of human nature\r\nviolated, and the whole country held trembling on the edge of civil\r\nwar,--while all this large exuberance of wickedness, detestable in\r\nitself, becomes tenfold more detestable, when its origin is traced\r\nto the madness for Slavery. The fatal partition between Freedom and\r\nSlavery, known as the Missouri Compromise,--the subsequent overthrow\r\nof this partition, and the seizure of all by Slavery,--the violation\r\nof plighted faith,--the conspiracy to force Slavery at all hazards\r\ninto Kansas,--the successive invasions by which all security there was\r\ndestroyed, and the electoral franchise itself was trodden down,--the\r\nsacrilegious seizure of the very polls, and, through pretended forms of\r\nlaw, the imposition of a foreign legislature upon this Territory,--the\r\nacts of this legislature, fortifying the Usurpation, and, among other\r\nthings, establishing test-oaths, calculated to disfranchise actual\r\nsettlers friendly to Freedom, and securing the privileges of the\r\ncitizen to actual strangers friendly to Slavery,--the whole crowned\r\nby a statute, “the be-all and the end-all” of the whole Usurpation,\r\nthrough which Slavery was not only recognized on this beautiful soil,\r\nbut made to bristle with a Code of Death such as the world has rarely\r\nseen,--all these I fully exposed on a former occasion. And yet the most\r\nimportant part of the argument was at that time left untouched: I mean\r\nthat found in the Character of Slavery. This natural sequel, with the\r\npermission of the Senate, I now propose to supply.\r\n\r\nMotive is to Crime as soul to body; and it is only when we comprehend\r\nthe motive that we can truly comprehend the Crime. Here the motive is\r\nfound in Slavery and the rage for its extension. Therefore, by logical\r\nnecessity, must Slavery be discussed,--not indirectly, timidly, and\r\nsparingly, but directly, openly, and thoroughly. It must be exhibited\r\nas it is, alike in its influence and its animating character, so that\r\nnot only outside, but inside, may be seen.\r\n\r\nThis is no time for soft words or excuses. All such are out of place.\r\nThey may turn away wrath; but what is the wrath of man? This is no time\r\nto abandon any advantage in the argument. Senators sometimes announce\r\nthat they resist Slavery on political grounds only, and remind us that\r\nthey say nothing of the moral question. This is wrong. Slavery must\r\nbe resisted not only on political grounds, but on all other grounds,\r\nwhether social, economical, or moral. Ours is no holiday contest; nor\r\nis it any strife of rival factions, of White and Red Roses, of theatric\r\nNeri and Bianchi; but it is a solemn battle between Right and Wrong,\r\nbetween Good and Evil. Such a battle cannot be fought with rosewater.\r\nThere is austere work to be done, and Freedom cannot consent to fling\r\naway any of her weapons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf I were disposed to shrink from this discussion, the boundless\r\nassumptions made by Senators on the other side would not allow me.\r\nThe whole character of Slavery, as a pretended form of Civilization,\r\nis put directly in issue, with a pertinacity and a hardihood which\r\nbanish all reserve on this side. In these assumptions Senators from\r\nSouth Carolina naturally take the lead. Following Mr. Calhoun, who\r\npronounced Slavery “the most solid and durable foundation on which to\r\nrear free and stable political institutions,”[27] and Mr. McDuffie,\r\nwho did not shrink from calling it “the corner-stone of our republican\r\nedifice,”[28] the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. HAMMOND] insists\r\nthat its “frame of society is the best in the world”[29]; and his\r\ncolleague [Mr. CHESNUT] takes up the strain. One Senator from\r\nMississippi [Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS], adds, that Slavery “is but a form\r\nof civil government for those who by their nature are not fit to govern\r\nthemselves”;[30] and his colleague [Mr. BROWN] openly vaunts that it\r\n“is a great moral, social, and political blessing,--a blessing to the\r\nslave, and a blessing to the master.”[31] One Senator from Virginia\r\n[Mr. HUNTER], in a studied vindication of what he is pleased to call\r\n“the social system of the South,” exalts Slavery as “the normal\r\ncondition of human society,” “beneficial to the non-slave-owner as it\r\nis to the slave-owner,” “best for the happiness of both races,”--and,\r\nin enthusiastic advocacy, declares, “that the very keystone of the\r\nmighty arch, which, by its concentrated strength, and by the mutual\r\nsupport of its parts, is able to sustain our social superstructure,\r\nconsists in the black marble block of African Slavery: knock that out,\r\nand the mighty fabric, with all that it upholds, topples and tumbles\r\nto its fall.”[32] These are his very words, uttered in debate here.\r\nAnd his colleague [Mr. MASON], who never hesitates where Slavery is in\r\nquestion, proclaims that it is “_ennobling_ to both races, the white\r\nand the black,”--a word which, so far as the slave is concerned, he\r\nchanges, on a subsequent day, to “elevating,” assuming still that it\r\nis “ennobling” to the whites,[33]--which is simply a new version of\r\nthe old assumption, by Mr. McDuffie, of South Carolina, that “the\r\ninstitution of Domestic Slavery supersedes the necessity of an order of\r\nnobility.”[34]\r\n\r\nThus, by various voices, is Slavery defiantly proclaimed a form of\r\nCivilization,--not seeing that its existence is plainly inconsistent\r\nwith the first principles of anything that can be called Civilization,\r\nexcept by that figure of speech in classical literature where a thing\r\ntakes its name from something which it has not, as the dreadful\r\nFates were called merciful because they were without mercy. Pardon\r\nthe allusion, if I add, that, listening to these sounding words for\r\nSlavery, I am reminded of the kindred extravagance related by that\r\nremarkable traveller in China, the late Abbé Huc, where a gloomy hole\r\nin which he was lodged, infested by mosquitoes and exhaling noisome\r\nvapors, with light and air entering by a single narrow aperture only,\r\nwas styled by Chinese pride “The Hotel of the Beatitudes.” According to\r\na Hindoo proverb, the snail sees nothing but its own shell, and thinks\r\nit the grandest palace in the universe. This is another illustration of\r\nthe delusion which we are called to witness.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that Senators thus insensible to the true character of\r\nSlavery should evince an equal insensibility to the true character of\r\nthe Constitution. This is shown in the claim now made, and pressed\r\nwith unprecedented energy, degrading the work of our fathers, that by\r\nvirtue of the Constitution the pretended property in man is placed\r\nbeyond the reach of Congressional prohibition even within Congressional\r\njurisdiction, so that the slave-master may at all times enter the broad\r\noutlying territories of the Union with the victims of his oppression,\r\nand there continue to hold them by lash and chain.\r\n\r\nSuch are two assumptions, the first of fact, and the second of\r\nConstitutional Law, now vaunted without apology or hesitation. I meet\r\nthem both. To the first I oppose the essential Barbarism of Slavery,\r\nin all its influences, whether high or low,--as Satan is Satan still,\r\nwhether towering in the sky or squatting in the toad. To the second\r\nI oppose the unanswerable, irresistible truth, that the Constitution\r\nof the United States nowhere recognizes property in man. These two\r\nassumptions naturally go together. They are “twins” suckled by the same\r\nwolf. They are the “couple” in the present slave-hunt. And the latter\r\ncannot be answered without exposing the former. It is only when Slavery\r\nis exhibited in its truly hateful character that we fully appreciate\r\nthe absurdity of the assumption, which, in defiance of express letter\r\nin the Constitution, and without a single sentence, phrase, or word\r\nupholding human bondage, yet foists into this blameless text the\r\nbarbarous idea that man can hold property in man.\r\n\r\nOn former occasions I have discussed Slavery only incidentally: as, in\r\nunfolding the principle that Slavery is Sectional and Freedom National;\r\nin exposing the unconstitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Bill; in\r\nvindicating the Prohibition of Slavery in the Missouri Territory; in\r\nexhibiting the imbecility, throughout the Revolution, of the Slave\r\nStates, and especially of South Carolina; and, lastly, in unmasking the\r\nCrime against Kansas. On all these occasions, where I spoke at length,\r\nI said too little of the character of Slavery,--partly because other\r\ntopics were presented, and partly from a prevailing disinclination\r\nto press the argument against those whom I knew to have all the\r\nsensitiveness of a sick man. But, God be praised, this time has passed,\r\nand the debate is now lifted from details to principles. Grander debate\r\nhas not occurred in our history,--rarely in any history; nor can it\r\nclose or subside, except with the triumph of Freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ASSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nOf course I begin with the assumption of fact, which must be treated at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nIt was the often-quoted remark of John Wesley, who knew well how to use\r\nwords, as also how to touch hearts, that Slavery is “the sum of all\r\nvillanies.” The phrase is pungent; but it were rash in any of us to\r\ncriticise the testimony of that illustrious founder of Methodism, whose\r\nample experience of Slavery in Georgia and the Carolinas seems to have\r\nbeen all condensed in this sententious judgment. Language is feeble to\r\nexpress all the enormity of an institution which is now exalted as in\r\nitself a form of civilization, “ennobling” at least to the master, if\r\nnot to the slave. Look at it as you will, and it is always the scab,\r\nthe canker, the “barebones,” and the shame of the country,--wrong, not\r\nmerely in the abstract, as is often admitted by its apologist, but\r\nwrong in the concrete also, and possessing no single element of right.\r\nLook at it in the light of principle, and it is nothing less than a\r\nhuge insurrection against the eternal law of God, involving in its\r\npretensions the denial of all human rights, and also the denial of that\r\nDivine Law in which God himself is manifest, thus being practically the\r\ngrossest lie and the grossest atheism. Founded in violence, sustained\r\nonly by violence, such a wrong must by sure law of compensation blast\r\nmaster as well as slave,--blast the lands on which they live, blast the\r\ncommunity of which they are part, blast the government which does not\r\nforbid the outrage; and the longer it exists and the more completely\r\nit prevails, must its vengeful influences penetrate the whole social\r\nsystem. Barbarous in origin, barbarous in law, barbarous in all its\r\npretensions, barbarous in the instruments it employs, barbarous in\r\nconsequences, barbarous in spirit, barbarous wherever it shows itself,\r\nSlavery must breed Barbarians, while it develops everywhere, alike\r\nin the individual and the society to which he belongs, the essential\r\nelements of Barbarism. In this character it is conspicuous before the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nUndertaking now to expose the BARBARISM OF SLAVERY, the whole broad\r\nfield is open before me. There is nothing in its character, its\r\nmanifold wrong, its wretched results, and especially in its influence\r\non the class claiming to be “ennobled” by it, that will not fall\r\nnaturally under consideration.\r\n\r\nI know well the difficulty of this discussion, involved in the\r\nhumiliating truth with which I begin. Senators, on former occasions,\r\nrevealing their sensitiveness, have even protested against comparison\r\nbetween what were called “two civilizations,”--meaning the two\r\nsocial systems produced respectively by Freedom and Slavery. The\r\nsensibility and the protest are not unnatural, though mistaken. “Two\r\ncivilizations!” Sir, in this nineteenth century of Christian light\r\nthere can be but one Civilization, and this is where Freedom prevails.\r\nBetween Slavery and Civilization there is essential incompatibility.\r\nIf you are for the one, you cannot be for the other; and just in\r\nproportion to the embrace of Slavery is the divorce from Civilization.\r\nAs cold is but the absence of heat, and darkness but the absence\r\nof light, so is Slavery but the absence of justice and humanity,\r\nwithout which Civilization is impossible. That slave-masters should be\r\ndisturbed, when this is exposed, might be expected. But the assumptions\r\nso boastfully made, while they may not prevent the sensibility, yet\r\nsurely exclude all ground of protest, when these assumptions are\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nNor is this the only difficulty. Slavery is a bloody Touch-Me-Not, and\r\neverywhere in sight now blooms the bloody flower. It is on the wayside\r\nas we approach the National Capitol; it is on the marble steps which\r\nwe mount; it flaunts on this floor. I stand now in the house of its\r\nfriends. About me, while I speak, are its most jealous guardians, who\r\nhave shown in the past how much they are ready to do or not to do,\r\nwhere Slavery is in question. Menaces to deter me have not been spared.\r\nBut I should ill deserve the high post of duty here, with which I am\r\nhonored by a generous and enlightened people, if I could hesitate.\r\nIdolatry has been exposed in the presence of idolaters, and hypocrisy\r\nchastised in the presence of Scribes and Pharisees. Such examples may\r\nimpart encouragement to a Senator undertaking in this presence to\r\nexpose Slavery; nor can any language, directly responsive to Senatorial\r\nassumptions made for this Barbarism, be open to question. Slavery can\r\nbe painted only in sternest colors; nor can I forget that Nature’s\r\nsternest painter has been called the best.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE BARBARISM OF SLAVERY appears, _first_, in the _character of\r\nSlavery_, and, _secondly_, in the _character of Slave-Masters_.\r\n\r\nUnder the first head we shall properly consider (1) the Law of Slavery\r\nwith its Origin, and (2) the practical results of Slavery, as shown in\r\ncomparison between the Free States and the Slave States.\r\n\r\nUnder the _second_ head we shall naturally consider (1) Slave-Masters\r\nas shown in the Law of Slavery; (2) Slave-Masters in their relations\r\nwith slaves, here glancing at their three brutal instruments; (3)\r\nSlave-Masters in their relations with each other, with society, and\r\nwith Government; and (4) Slave-Masters in their unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe way will then be prepared for the consideration of the assumption\r\nof Constitutional Law.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the CHARACTER OF SLAVERY, there is little for me, except\r\nto make Slavery paint itself. When this is done, the picture will need\r\nno explanatory words.\r\n\r\n(1.) I begin with the _Law of Slavery and its Origin_; and here this\r\nBarbarism sketches itself in its own chosen definition. It is simply\r\nthis: Man, created in the image of God, is divested of the human\r\ncharacter, and declared to be a “chattel,”--that is, a beast, a thing,\r\nor article of property. That this statement may not seem made without\r\nprecise authority, I quote the statutes of three different States,\r\nbeginning with South Carolina, whose voice for Slavery has always\r\nunerring distinctiveness. According to the definition supplied by this\r\nState, slaves\r\n\r\n    “shall be deemed, held, taken, reputed, and adjudged in law\r\n    to be _chattels personal_ in the hands of their owners and\r\n    possessors, and their executors, administrators, and assigns,\r\n    to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever.”[35]\r\n\r\nAnd here is the definition supplied by the Civil Code of Louisiana:--\r\n\r\n    “A slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he\r\n    belongs. The master may sell him, dispose of his person, his\r\n    industry, and his labor. He can do nothing, possess nothing,\r\n    nor acquire anything, but what must belong to his master.”[36]\r\n\r\nIn similar spirit the law of Maryland thus indirectly defines a slave\r\nas an _article_:--\r\n\r\n    “In case the personal property of a ward shall consist of\r\n    specific _articles, such as slaves_, working beasts, animals of\r\n    any kind, … the court, if it shall deem it advantageous for the\r\n    ward, may at any time pass an order for the sale thereof.”[37]\r\n\r\nNot to occupy time unnecessarily, I present a summary of the pretended\r\nlaw defining Slavery in all the Slave States, as made by a careful\r\nwriter, Judge Stroud, in a work of juridical as well as philanthropic\r\nmerit:--\r\n\r\n    “The cardinal principle of Slavery--that the slave is not to\r\n    be ranked among _sentient_ beings, but among _things_, is an\r\n    article of property, a chattel personal--obtains as undoubted\r\n    law in all of these [Slave] States.”[38]\r\n\r\nOut of this definition, as from a solitary germ, which in its pettiness\r\nmight be crushed by the hand, towers our Upas Tree and all its gigantic\r\npoison. Study it, and you will comprehend the whole monstrous growth.\r\n\r\nSir, look at its plain import, and see the relation which it\r\nestablishes. The slave is held simply _for the use of his master_,\r\nto whose behests his life, liberty, and happiness are devoted, and\r\nby whom he may be bartered, leased, mortgaged, bequeathed, invoiced,\r\nshipped as cargo, stored as goods, sold on execution, knocked off at\r\npublic auction, and even staked at the gaming-table on the hazard of\r\na card or a die,--all according to law. Nor is there anything, within\r\nthe limit of life, inflicted on a beast, which may not be inflicted on\r\nthe slave. He may be marked like a hog, branded like a mule, yoked like\r\nan ox, hobbled like a horse, driven like an ass, sheared like a sheep,\r\nmaimed like a cur, and constantly beaten like a brute,--all according\r\nto law. And should life itself be taken, what is the remedy? The Law of\r\nSlavery, imitating that rule of evidence which in barbarous days and\r\nbarbarous countries prevented the Christian from testifying against\r\nthe Mahometan, openly pronounces the incompetency of the whole African\r\nrace, whether bond or free, to testify against a white man in any case,\r\nand thus, after surrendering the slave to all possible outrage, crowns\r\nits tyranny by excluding the very testimony through which the bloody\r\ncruelty of the Slave-Master might be exposed.\r\n\r\nThus in its Law does Slavery paint itself; but it is only when we look\r\nat details, and detect its essential elements, _five in number_, all\r\ninspired by _a single motive_, that its character becomes completely\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\n_Foremost_, of course, in these elements, is the impossible pretension,\r\nwhere Barbarism is lost in impiety, by which man claims _property\r\nin man_. Against such blasphemy the argument is brief. According to\r\nthe Law of Nature, written by the same hand that placed the planets\r\nin their orbits, and, like them, constituting part of the eternal\r\nsystem of the Universe, every human being has complete title\r\nto himself direct from the Almighty. Naked he is born; but this\r\nbirthright is inseparable from the human form. A man may be poor in\r\nthis world’s goods; but he owns himself. No war or robbery, ancient\r\nor recent,--no capture--no middle passage,--no change of clime,--no\r\npurchase-money,--no transmission from hand to hand, no matter how many\r\ntimes, and no matter at what price, can defeat this indefeasible,\r\nGod-given franchise. And a divine mandate, strong as that which guards\r\nLife, guards Liberty also. Even at the very morning of Creation, when\r\nGod said, “Let there be Light,”--earlier than the malediction against\r\nmurder,--he set the everlasting difference between man and chattel,\r\ngiving to man “dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of\r\nthe air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”\r\n\r\n              “That right we hold\r\n    By his donation; but man over men\r\n    He made not lord: such title to himself\r\n    Reserving, human left from human free.”[39]\r\n\r\nSlavery tyrannically assumes power which Heaven denied,--while, under\r\nits barbarous necromancy, borrowed from the Source of Evil, a man is\r\nchanged into a chattel, a person is withered into a thing, a soul is\r\nshrunk into merchandise. Say, Sir, in lofty madness, that you own the\r\nsun, the stars, the moon; but do not say that you own a man, endowed\r\nwith soul to live immortal, when sun and moon and stars have passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ Slavery paints itself again in its complete _abrogation of\r\nmarriage_, recognized as a sacrament by the Church, and as a contract\r\nby the civil power, wherever civilization prevails. Under the Law\r\nof Slavery no such sacrament is respected, and no such contract can\r\nexist. The ties formed between slaves are all subject to the selfish\r\ninterests or more selfish lust of the master, whose license knows no\r\ncheck. Natural affections which have come together are rudely torn\r\nasunder: nor is this all. Stripped of every defence, the chastity of\r\na whole race is exposed to violence, while the result is recorded in\r\ntell-tale faces of children, glowing with a master’s blood, but doomed\r\nfor their mother’s skin to Slavery through descending generations.\r\nThe Senator from Mississippi [Mr. BROWN], galled by the comparison\r\nbetween Slavery and Polygamy, winces. I hail this sensibility as the\r\nsign of virtue. Let him reflect, and he will confess that there are\r\nmany disgusting elements in Slavery, not present in Polygamy, while\r\nthe single disgusting element of Polygamy is more than present in\r\nSlavery. By license of Polygamy, one man may have many wives, all bound\r\nto him by marriage-tie, and in other respects protected by law. By\r\nlicense of Slavery, a whole race is delivered over to prostitution and\r\nconcubinage, without the protection of any law. Surely, Sir, is not\r\nSlavery barbarous?\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ Slavery paints itself again in its complete _abrogation\r\nof the parental relation_, provided by God in his benevolence for\r\nthe nurture and education of the human family, and constituting\r\nan essential part of Civilization itself. And yet by the Law of\r\nSlavery--happily beginning to be modified in some places--this relation\r\nis set at nought, and in its place is substituted the arbitrary control\r\nof the master, at whose mere command little children, such as the\r\nSaviour called unto him, though clasped by a mother’s arms, are swept\r\nunder the hammer of the auctioneer. I do not dwell on this exhibition.\r\nSir, is not Slavery barbarous?\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._ Slavery paints itself again _in closing the gates of\r\nknowledge_, which are also the shining gates of Civilization. Under\r\nits plain, unequivocal law, the bondman, at the unrestrained will\r\nof his master, is shut out from all instruction; while in many\r\nplaces--incredible to relate--the law itself, by cumulative provisions,\r\npositively forbids that he shall be taught to read! Of course the slave\r\ncannot be allowed to read: for his soul would then expand in larger\r\nair, while he saw the glory of the North Star, and also the helping\r\ntruth, that God, who made iron, never made a slave; for he would then\r\nbecome familiar with the Scriptures, with the Decalogue still speaking\r\nin the thunders of Sinai,--with that ancient text, “He that stealeth\r\na man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely\r\nbe put to death”[40]--with that other text, “Masters, give unto your\r\nservants that which is just and equal,”[41]--with that great story of\r\nRedemption, when the Lord raised the slave-born Moses to deliver his\r\nchosen people from the house of bondage,--and with that sublimer story,\r\nwhere the Saviour died a cruel death, that all men, without distinction\r\nof race, might be saved, leaving to mankind a commandment which, even\r\nwithout his example, makes Slavery impossible. Thus, in order to fasten\r\nyour manacles upon the slave, you fasten other manacles upon his soul.\r\nThe ancients maintained Slavery by chains and death: you maintain it by\r\nthat infinite despotism and monopoly through which human nature itself\r\nis degraded. Sir, is not Slavery barbarous?\r\n\r\n_Fifthly._ Slavery paints itself again _in the appropriation of all\r\nthe toil_ of its victims, excluding them from that property in their\r\nown earnings which the Law of Nature allows and Civilization secures.\r\nThe painful injustice of this pretension is lost in its meanness. It is\r\nrobbery and petty larceny under garb of law. And even the meanness is\r\nlost in the absurdity of its associate pretension, that the African,\r\nthus despoiled of all earnings, is saved from poverty, and that for his\r\nown good he must work for his master, and not for himself. Alas, by\r\nsuch fallacy is a whole race pauperized! And yet this transaction is\r\nnot without illustrative example. A sombre poet, whose verse has found\r\nwide favor, pictures a creature who\r\n\r\n              “with one hand put\r\n    A penny in the urn of poverty,\r\n    And with the other took a shilling out.”[42]\r\n\r\nAnd a celebrated traveller through Russia, more than a generation\r\nago, describes a kindred spirit, who, while devoutly crossing himself\r\nat church with his right hand, with the left deliberately picked\r\nthe pocket of a fellow-sinner by his side.[43] Not admiring these\r\ninstances, I cannot cease to deplore a system which has much of both,\r\nwhile, under affectation of charity, it sordidly takes from the slave\r\nall the fruits of his bitter sweat, and thus takes from him the main\r\nspring to exertion. Tell me, Sir, is not Slavery barbarous?\r\n\r\nSuch is Slavery in its five special elements of Barbarism, as\r\nrecognized by law: first, assuming that man can hold property in man;\r\nsecondly, abrogating the relation of husband and wife; thirdly,\r\nabrogating the parental tie; fourthly, closing the gates of knowledge;\r\nand, fifthly, appropriating the unpaid labor of another. Take away\r\nthese elements, sometimes called “abuses,” and Slavery will cease to\r\nexist; for it is these very “abuses” which constitute Slavery. Take\r\naway any one of them, and the abolition of Slavery begins. And when I\r\npresent Slavery for judgment, I mean no slight evil, with regard to\r\nwhich there may be reasonable difference of opinion, but I mean this\r\nfivefold embodiment of “abuse,” this ghastly quincunx of Barbarism,\r\neach particular of which, if considered separately, must be denounced\r\nat once with all the ardor of an honest soul, while the whole fivefold\r\ncombination must awake a fivefold denunciation. The historic pirates,\r\nonce the plague of the Gulf whose waters they plundered, have been\r\npraised for the equity with which they adjusted the ratable shares of\r\nspoil, and also for generous benefactions to the poor, and even to\r\nchurches, so that Sir Walter Scott could say,--\r\n\r\n              “Do thou revere\r\n    The statutes of the Buccaneer.”[44]\r\n\r\nIn our Law of Slavery what is there to revere? what is there at which\r\nthe soul does not rise in abhorrence?\r\n\r\nBut this fivefold combination becomes yet more hateful when its\r\n_single motive_ is considered; and here Slavery paints itself finally.\r\nThe Senator from Mississippi [Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS] says that it is\r\n“but a form of civil government for those who by their nature are\r\nnot fit to govern themselves.” The Senator is mistaken. It is an\r\noutrage, where five different pretensions all concur in one single\r\nobject, looking only to the profit of the master, and constituting\r\nits ever-present motive power, which is simply _to compel the labor\r\nof fellow-men without wages_. If I pronounce this object not only\r\nbarbarous, but brutal, I follow the judgment of Luther’s Bible, in the\r\nbook “Jesus Sirach,” known in our translation as Ecclesiasticus, where\r\nit is said: “He that giveth not his wages to the laborer, _he is a\r\nbloodhound_.”[45]\r\n\r\nSlavery is often exposed as degrading Humanity. On this fruitful theme\r\nnobody has expressed himself with the force and beautiful eloquence\r\nof our own Channing. His generous soul glowed with indignation at the\r\nthought of man, supremest creature of earth, and first of God’s works,\r\ndespoiled of manhood and changed to a thing. But earlier than Channing\r\nwas Jean Jacques Rousseau, who, with similar eloquence and the same\r\nglowing indignation, vindicated Humanity. How grandly he insists that\r\nnobody can consent to be a slave, or can be born a slave! Believing\r\nLiberty the most noble of human attributes, this wonderful writer will\r\nnot stop to consider if descent to the condition of beasts be not to\r\ndegrade human nature, if renunciation of the most precious of all God’s\r\ngifts be not to offend the Author of our being; but he demands only by\r\nwhat right those who degrade themselves to this depth can subject their\r\nposterity to this same ignominy, renouncing for them goods which do not\r\ndepend upon any ancestors, and without which life itself is to all\r\nworthy of it a burden; and he justly concludes, that, as, to establish\r\nSlavery, it is necessary to violate Nature, so, to perpetuate this\r\nclaim, it is necessary to change Nature. His final judgment, being the\r\npractical conclusion of this outburst, holds up jurisconsults, gravely\r\npronouncing that the child of a slave is born a slave, as deciding,\r\nin other terms, that a man is not born a man,[46]--thus exposing the\r\npeculiar absurdity of that pretension by which Slavery is transmitted\r\nfrom the mother to her offspring, as expressed in the Latin scrap on\r\nwhich the Senator from Virginia [Mr. MASON] relies: _Partus sequitur\r\nventrem_.\r\n\r\nIf the offence of Slavery were less extended, if it were confined to\r\nsome narrow region, if it had less of grandeur in its proportions, if\r\nits victims were counted by tens and hundreds instead of millions,\r\nthe five-headed enormity would find little indulgence; all would rise\r\nagainst it, while Religion and Civilization would lavish choicest\r\nefforts in the general warfare. But what is wrong when done to one\r\nman cannot be right when done to many. If it is wrong thus to degrade\r\na single soul, if it is wrong thus to degrade you, Mr. President, it\r\ncannot be right to degrade a whole race. And yet this is denied by the\r\nbarbarous logic of Slavery, which, taking advantage of its own wrong,\r\nclaims immunity because its usurpation has assumed a front of audacity\r\nthat cannot be safely attacked. Unhappily, there is Barbarism elsewhere\r\nin the world; but American Slavery, as defined by existing law, stands\r\nforth as the greatest organized Barbarism on which the sun now looks.\r\nIt is without a single peer. Its author, after making it, broke the\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nIf curiosity carries us to the origin of this law,--and here I\r\napproach a topic often considered in this Chamber,--we shall again\r\nconfess its Barbarism. It is not derived from the Common Law, that\r\nfountain of Liberty; for this law, while unhappily recognizing a\r\nsystem of servitude known as villeinage, secured to the bondman\r\nprivileges unknown to the American slave,--guarded his person against\r\nmayhem,--protected his wife against rape,--gave to his marriage equal\r\nvalidity with the marriage of his master,--and surrounded his offspring\r\nwith generous presumptions of Freedom, unlike that rule of yours by\r\nwhich the servitude of the mother is necessarily stamped upon the\r\nchild. It is not derived from the Roman Law, that fountain of Tyranny,\r\nfor two reasons: first, because this law, in its better days, when its\r\nearly rigors were spent, like the Common Law itself, secured to the\r\nbondman privileges unknown to the American slave,--in certain cases of\r\ncruelty rescued him from his master, prevented separation of parents\r\nand children, also of brothers and sisters, and even protected him in\r\nthe marriage relation; and, secondly, because the Thirteen Colonies\r\nwere not derived from any of those countries which recognized the Roman\r\nLaw, while this law, even before the discovery of this continent, had\r\nlost all living efficacy. It is not derived from the Mohammedan Law;\r\nfor, under the mild injunctions of the Koran, a benignant servitude,\r\nunlike yours, has prevailed,--where the lash is not allowed to lacerate\r\nthe back of a female,--where no knife or branding-iron is employed upon\r\nany human being, to mark him as the property of his fellow-man,--where\r\nthe master is expressly enjoined to favor the desires of his slave for\r\nemancipation,--and where the blood of the master, mingling with that\r\nof his bondwoman, takes from her the transferable character of chattel,\r\nand confers complete freedom upon their offspring. It is not derived\r\nfrom the Spanish Law; for this law contains humane elements unknown\r\nto your system, borrowed, perhaps, from Mohammedan Moors who so long\r\noccupied Spain; and, besides, our Thirteen Colonies had no umbilical\r\nconnection with Spain. Nor is it derived from English statutes or\r\nAmerican statutes; for we have the positive and repeated averment of\r\nthe Senator from Virginia [Mr. MASON], and also of other Senators, that\r\nin not a single State of the Union can any such statutes establishing\r\nSlavery be found. From none of these does it come.\r\n\r\nNo, Sir, not from any land of Civilization is this Barbarism derived.\r\nIt comes from Africa, ancient nurse of monsters,--from Guinea, Dahomey,\r\nand Congo. There is its origin and fountain. This benighted region, we\r\nare told by Chief-Justice Marshall in a memorable judgment,[47] still\r\nasserts a right, discarded by Christendom, to enslave captives taken in\r\nwar; and this African Barbarism is the beginning of American Slavery.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia, a Slave State, has not shrunk from this\r\nconclusion. “Licensed to hold slave property,” says the Court, “the\r\nGeorgia planter held the slave as a chattel, either directly from\r\nthe slave-trader or from those who held under him, and he from the\r\nslave-captor in Africa. The property of the planter in the slave became\r\nthus the property of the original captor.”[48] It is natural that a\r\nright thus derived in defiance of Christendom, and openly founded on\r\nthe most vulgar Paganism, should be exercised without mitigating\r\ninfluence from Christianity,--that the master’s authority over the\r\nperson of his slave, over his conjugal relations, over his parental\r\nrelations, over the employment of his time, over all his acquisitions,\r\nshould be recognized, while no generous presumption inclines to\r\nFreedom, and the womb of the bondwoman can deliver only a slave.\r\n\r\nFrom its home in Africa, where it is sustained by immemorial usage,\r\nthis Barbarism, thus derived and thus developed, traversed the ocean to\r\nAmerican soil. It entered on board that fatal slave-ship,\r\n\r\n    “Built in the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,”\r\n\r\nwhich in 1620 landed its cruel cargo at Jamestown, in Virginia; and it\r\nhas boldly taken its place in every succeeding slave-ship, from that\r\nearly day till now,--helping to pack the human freight, regardless of\r\nhuman agony,--surviving the torments of the middle passage,--surviving\r\nits countless victims plunged beneath the waves; and it has left the\r\nslave-ship only to travel inseparable from the slave in his various\r\ndoom, sanctioning by its barbarous code every outrage, whether of\r\nmayhem or robbery, lash or lust, and fastening itself upon his\r\noffspring to the remotest generation. Thus are barbarous prerogatives\r\nof barbarous half-naked African chiefs perpetuated in American\r\nSlave-Masters, while the Senator from Virginia [Mr. MASON], perhaps\r\nunconscious of their origin, perhaps desirous to secure for them the\r\nappearance of a less barbarous pedigree, tricks them out with a phrase\r\nof the Roman Law, discarded by the Common Law, which simply renders\r\ninto ancient Latin an existing rule of African Barbarism, recognized as\r\nan existing rule of American Slavery.\r\n\r\nSuch is the plain juridical origin of the American slave code, now\r\nvaunted as a badge of Civilization. But all law, whatever its juridical\r\norigin, whether Christian or Mohammedan, Roman or African, may be\r\ntraced to other and ampler influences in Nature, sometimes of Right\r\nand sometimes of Wrong. Surely the law which stamped the slave-trade\r\nas piracy punishable with death had a different inspiration from that\r\nother law which secured immunity for the slave-trade throughout an\r\nimmense territory, and invested its supporters with political power. As\r\nthere is a nobler law above, so there is a meaner law below, and each\r\nis felt in human affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus far we have seen Slavery only in pretended law, and in the origin\r\nof that law. Here I might stop, without proceeding in the argument; for\r\non the letter of the law alone must Slavery be condemned. But the tree\r\nis known by its fruits, which I shall now exhibit: and this brings me\r\nto the second stage of the argument.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2.) In considering _the practical results of Slavery_, the materials\r\nare so obvious and diversified that my chief care will be to abridge\r\nand reject: and here I put the Slave States and Free States face to\r\nface, showing at each point the blasting influence of Slavery.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with these details, I would for one moment expose\r\nthat degradation of free labor, which is one of the general results.\r\nWhere there are slaves, whose office is work, it is held disreputable\r\nfor a white man to soil his skin or harden his hands with honest toil.\r\nThe Slave-Master of course declines work, and his pernicious example\r\ninfects all others. With impious resolve, they would reverse the\r\nAlmighty decree appointing labor as the duty of man, and declaring that\r\nin the sweat of his face shall he eat his bread. The Slave-Master says,\r\n“No! this is true of the slave, of the black man, but not of the white\r\nman: he shall not eat his bread in the sweat of his face.” Thus is the\r\nbrand of degradation stamped upon that daily toil which contributes\r\nso much to a true Civilization. It is a constant boast in the Slave\r\nStates, that white men there will not perform work performed in the\r\nFree States. Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Waddy Thompson made this boast. Let\r\nit be borne in mind, then, that, where Slavery prevails, there is not\r\nonly despair for the black man, but inequality and ignominy for the\r\nwhite laborer. By necessary consequence, the latter, whether emigrating\r\nfrom our Free States or fleeing from oppression and wretchedness in his\r\nEuropean home, avoids a region disabled by such a social law. Hence\r\na twofold injustice: practically he is excluded from the land, while\r\nthe land itself becomes a prey to that paralysis which is caused by a\r\nviolation of the laws of God. And now for the testimony.\r\n\r\nThe States where this Barbarism exists excel the Free States in all\r\nnatural advantages. Their territory is more extensive, stretching over\r\n851,448 square miles, while the Free States, including California,\r\nembrace only 612,597 square miles. Here is a difference of more than\r\n238,000 square miles in favor of the Slave States, showing that Freedom\r\nstarts in this great rivalry with a field more than a quarter less\r\nthan that of Slavery. In happiness of climate, adapted to productions\r\nof special value,--in exhaustless motive power distributed throughout\r\nits space,--in natural highways, by more than fifty navigable rivers,\r\nnever closed by the rigors of winter,--and in a stretch of coast, along\r\nOcean and Gulf, indented by hospitable harbors,--the whole presenting\r\nincomparable advantages for that true Civilization, where agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, and commerce, both domestic and foreign, blend,--in all\r\nthese respects the Slave States excel the Free States, whose climate\r\nis often churlish, whose motive power is less various, whose navigable\r\nrivers are fewer and often sealed by ice, and whose coast, while less\r\nin extent and with fewer harbors, is often perilous from storm and cold.\r\n\r\nBut Slavery plays the part of a Harpy, and defiles the choicest\r\nbanquet. See what it does with this territory, thus spacious and fair.\r\n\r\nAn important indication of prosperity is in the growth of _population_.\r\nIn this respect the two regions started equal. In 1790, at the first\r\ncensus under the Constitution, the population of the present Slave\r\nStates was 1,961,372, of the present Free States 1,968,455, showing a\r\ndifference of only 7,083 in favor of the Free States. This difference,\r\nat first merely nominal, has been constantly increasing since, showing\r\nitself more strongly in each decennial census, until, in 1850, the\r\npopulation of the Slave States, swollen by the annexation of three\r\nforeign Territories, Louisiana, Florida, and Texas, was only 9,612,969,\r\nwhile that of the Free States, without such large annexations, reached\r\n13,434,922, showing a difference of 3,821,953 in favor of Freedom.\r\nBut this difference becomes still more remarkable, if we confine our\r\ninquiries to the white population, which at this period was only\r\n6,184,477 in the Slave States, while it was 13,238,670 in the Free\r\nStates, showing a difference of 7,054,193, in favor of Freedom, and\r\nshowing also that the white population of the Free States had not\r\nonly doubled, but, while occupying a smaller territory, commenced to\r\ntriple, that of the Slave States. The comparative sparseness of the two\r\npopulations furnishes another illustration. In the Slave States the\r\naverage number of inhabitants to a square mile was 11.29, while in the\r\nFree States it was 21.93, or almost two to one in favor of Freedom.\r\n\r\nThese results are general; but if we take any particular Slave State,\r\nand compare it with a Free State, we shall find the same marked\r\nevidence for Freedom. Take Virginia, with a territory of 61,352 miles,\r\nand New York, with a territory of 47,000, or over 14,000 square miles\r\nless than her sister State. New York has one seaport, Virginia some\r\nthree or four; New York has one noble river, Virginia has several;\r\nNew York for 400 miles runs along the frozen line of Canada, Virginia\r\nbasks in a climate of constant felicity. But Freedom is better than\r\nclimate, river, or seaport. In 1790 the population of Virginia was\r\n748,308, and in 1850 it was 1,421,661. In 1790 the population of New\r\nYork was 340,120, and in 1850 it was 3,097,394. That of Virginia had\r\nnot doubled in sixty years, while that of New York had multiplied more\r\nthan nine-fold. A similar comparison may be made between Kentucky, with\r\n37,680 square miles, admitted into the Union as long ago as 1792, and\r\nOhio, with 39,964 square miles, admitted into the Union in 1802. In\r\n1850, the Slave State had a population of only 982,405, while Ohio had\r\na population of 1,980,329, showing a difference of nearly a million in\r\nfavor of Freedom.\r\n\r\nAs in population, so also in _the value of property, real and\r\npersonal_, do the Free States excel the Slave States. According to\r\nthe census of 1850, the value of property in the Free States was\r\n$4,102,162,098, while in the Slave States it was $2,936,090,737;\r\nor, if we deduct the asserted property in human flesh, only\r\n$1,655,945,137,--showing an enormous difference of billions in favor of\r\nFreedom. In the Free States the valuation per acre was $10.46, in the\r\nSlave States only $3.04. This disproportion was still greater in 1855,\r\nwhen, according to the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, the\r\nvaluation of the Free States was $5,770,197,679, or $14.71 per acre;\r\nand of the Slave States, $3,977,354,046, or, if we deduct the asserted\r\nproperty in human flesh, $2,505,186,446, or $4.59 per acre. Thus in\r\nfive years from 1850 the valuation of property in the Free States\r\nreceived an increase of more than the whole accumulated valuation of\r\nthe Slave States in 1850.\r\n\r\nLooking at details, we find the same disproportions. Arkansas and\r\nMichigan, nearly equal in territory, were organized as States by\r\nsimultaneous Acts of Congress; and yet in 1855 the whole valuation\r\nof Arkansas, including its asserted property in human flesh, was\r\nonly $64,240,726, while that of Michigan, without a single slave,\r\nwas $116,593,580. The whole accumulated valuation of all the Slave\r\nStates, deducting the asserted property in human flesh, in 1850, was\r\nonly $1,655,945,137; but the valuation of New York alone, in 1855,\r\nreached the nearly equal sum of $1,401,285,279. The valuation of\r\nVirginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Texas, all together,\r\nin 1850, deducting human flesh, was $559,224,920, or simply $1.96\r\nper acre,--being less than that of Massachusetts alone, which was\r\n$573,342,286, or $114.85 per acre.\r\n\r\nThe Slave States boast of _agriculture_; but here again,\r\nnotwithstanding superior natural advantages, they must yield to the\r\nFree States at every point,--in the number of farms and plantations,\r\nin the number of acres improved, in the cash value of farms, in the\r\naverage value per acre, and in the value of farming implements and\r\nmachinery. Here is a short table.\r\n\r\n                                  Free States.    Slave States.\r\n\r\n    Number of farms,                    873,608         569,201\r\n    Acres of improved land,          57,720,494      54,970,327\r\n    Cash value of farms,         $2,147,218,478  $1,117,649,649\r\n    Average value per acre,              $19.17           $6.18\r\n    Value of farming implements     $85,840,141     $65,345,625\r\n\r\nSuch is the mighty contrast. But it does not stop here. Careful tables\r\nplace the agricultural products of the Free States, for the year ending\r\nJune, 1850, at $888,634,334, while those of the Slave States were\r\n$631,277,417; the product per acre in the Free States at $7.94, and the\r\nproduct per acre in the Slave States at $3.49; the average product of\r\neach agriculturist in the Free States at $342, and in the Slave States\r\nat $171. Thus the Free States, with a smaller population engaged in\r\nagriculture than the Slave States, and with smaller territory, show an\r\nannual sum total of agricultural products surpassing those of the Slave\r\nStates by two hundred and twenty-seven millions of dollars, while twice\r\nas much is produced by each agriculturist, and more than twice as much\r\nis produced on an acre. The monopoly of cotton, rice, and cane-sugar,\r\nwith a climate granting two and sometimes three crops in the year, is\r\nthus impotent in competition with Freedom.\r\n\r\nIn _manufactures, mining, and the mechanic arts_ the failure of the\r\nSlave States is greater still. It appears at all points,--in the\r\ncapital employed, in the value of the raw material, in the annual\r\nwages, and in the annual product. A short table will show the contrast.\r\n\r\n                            Free States.    Slave States.\r\n\r\n    Capital,                $430,240,051     $95,029,877\r\n    Value of raw material,   465,844,092      86,190,639\r\n    Annual wages,            195,436,453      33,247,560\r\n    Annual product,          842,586,058     165,423,027\r\n\r\nThis might be illustrated by details with regard to different\r\nmanufactures,--as shoes, cotton, woollens, pig iron, wrought iron, and\r\niron castings,--all showing the contrast. It might also be illustrated\r\nby comparison between different States,--showing, for instance, that\r\nthe manufactures of Massachusetts, during the last year, exceeded those\r\nof all the Slave States combined.\r\n\r\nIn _commerce_ the failure of the Slave States is on a yet larger\r\nscale. Under this head the census does not supply proper statistics,\r\nand we are left to approximations from other sources; but these are\r\nenough for our purpose. It appears, that, of products which enter into\r\ncommerce, the Free States had an amount valued at $1,377,199,968, the\r\nSlave States an amount valued only at $410,754,992; that, of persons\r\nengaged in trade, the Free States had 136,856, and the Slave States\r\n52,622; and that, of tonnage employed, the Free States had 2,791,096\r\ntons, and the Slave States only 726,284. This was in 1850. But in 1855\r\nthe disproportion was still greater, the Free States having 4,320,768\r\ntons, and the Slave States 855,510 tons, being a difference of five to\r\none,--and the tonnage of Massachusetts alone being 979,210 tons, an\r\namount larger than that of all the Slave States together. The tonnage\r\nbuilt during this year by the Free States was 528,844 tons, by the\r\nSlave States 52,938 tons. Maine alone built 215,905 tons, or more than\r\nfour times the whole built in the Slave States.\r\n\r\nThe foreign commerce of the Free States, in 1855, as indicated\r\nby exports and imports, was $404,365,503; of the Slave States,\r\n$132,062,196. The exports of the Free States were $167,520,693; of the\r\nSlave States, including the vaunted cotton crop, $107,475,668. The\r\nimports of the Free States were $236,844,810; of the Slave States,\r\n$24,586,528. The foreign commerce of New York alone was more than twice\r\nas large as that of all the Slave States; her imports were larger,\r\nand her exports were larger also. Add to this evidence of figures the\r\ntestimony of a Virginian, Mr. Loudon, in a letter written just before\r\nthe sitting of a Southern Commercial Convention. Thus he complains and\r\ntestifies:--\r\n\r\n    “There are not half a dozen vessels engaged in our own trade\r\n    that are owned in Virginia; and I have been unable to find a\r\n    vessel at Liverpool loading for Virginia within three years,\r\n    during the height of our busy season.”\r\n\r\n_Railroads and canals_ are the avenues of commerce; and here again the\r\nFree States excel. Of railroads in operation in 1854, there were 13,105\r\nmiles in the Free States, and 4,212 in the Slave States. Of canals\r\nthere were 3,682 miles in the Free States, and 1,116 in the Slave\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe _Post-Office_, which is the agent not only of commerce, but of\r\ncivilization, joins in the uniform testimony. According to the tables\r\nfor 1859, the postage collected in the Free States was $5,581,749,\r\nand the expense of carrying the mails $6,945,545, leaving a deficit\r\nof $1,363,796. In the Slave States the amount collected was only\r\n$1,936,167, and the expense of carrying the mails $5,947,076, leaving\r\nthe enormous deficit of $4,010,909,--the difference between the two\r\ndeficits being $2,647,113. The Slave States did not pay one third of\r\nthe expense in transporting their own mails; and not a single Slave\r\nState paid for transporting its own mails, not even the small State of\r\nDelaware. Massachusetts, besides paying for hers, had a surplus larger\r\nby one half than the whole amount collected in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1850, the value of _churches_ in the Free\r\nStates was $66,177,586; in the Slave States, $20,683,265.\r\n\r\nThe _voluntary charity_ contributed in 1855, for certain leading\r\npurposes of Christian benevolence, was, in the Free States, $955,511;\r\nfor the same purposes in the Slave States, $193,885. For the Bible\r\ncause the Free States contributed $321,365; the Slave States, $67,226.\r\nFor the Missionary cause the former contributed $502,174; and the\r\nlatter, $101,934. For the Tract Society the former contributed\r\n$131,972; and the latter, $24,725. The amount contributed for Missions\r\nby Massachusetts was greater than that contributed by all the Slave\r\nStates, and more than eight times that contributed by South Carolina.\r\n\r\nNor have the Free States been backward in charity for the benefit of\r\nthe Slave States. The records of Massachusetts show that as long ago\r\nas 1781, at the beginning of the Government, there was a contribution\r\nthroughout the Commonwealth, under the particular direction of that\r\neminent patriot, Samuel Adams, for the relief of inhabitants of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia.[49] In 1855 we were saddened by the prevalence\r\nof yellow fever in Portsmouth, Virginia; and now, from a report of the\r\nRelief Committee of that place, we learn that the amount of charity\r\ncontributed by the Slave States, exclusive of Virginia, the afflicted\r\nState, was $12,182; and including Virginia, it was $33,398; while\r\n$42,547 was contributed by the Free States.\r\n\r\nIn all this array we see the fatal influence of Slavery. But its\r\nBarbarism is yet more conspicuous, when we consider its _Educational\r\nEstablishments_, and the unhappy results naturally ensuing from their\r\nimperfect character.\r\n\r\nOf _colleges_, in 1856, the Free States had 61, and the Slave States\r\n59; but the comparative efficacy of the institutions assuming this\r\nname may be measured by certain facts. The number of graduates in the\r\nFree States was 47,752, in the Slave States 19,648; the number of\r\nministers educated in Slave colleges was 747, in Free colleges 10,702;\r\nand the number of volumes in the libraries of Slave colleges 308,011,\r\nin the libraries of Free colleges 668,497. If materials were at hand\r\nfor comparison between these colleges, in buildings, cabinets, and\r\nscientific apparatus, or in standard of scholarship, the difference\r\nwould be still more apparent.\r\n\r\nOf _professional schools_, teaching law, medicine, and theology,\r\nthe Free States had 65, with 269 professors, 4,417 students, and\r\n175,951 volumes in their libraries; while the Slave States had only\r\n32 professional schools, with 122 professors, 1,816 students, and\r\n30,796 volumes in their libraries. The whole number educated at these\r\ninstitutions in the Free States was 23,513, in the Slave States 3,812.\r\nOf these, the largest number in the Slave States study medicine, next\r\ntheology, and lastly law. According to the census, there are only 808\r\nstudents in the Slave theological schools, and 747 studying for the\r\nministry in Slave colleges; and this is the education of the Slave\r\nclergy. In the law schools of the Slave States the number of students\r\nis only 240, this being the sum-total of public students in the land of\r\nSlavery devoted to that profession which is the favorite stepping-stone\r\nto political life, where Slave-Masters claim such a disproportion of\r\noffice and honor.\r\n\r\nOf _academies and private schools_, in 1850, the Free States,\r\nnotwithstanding multitudinous public schools, had 3,197, with 7,175\r\nteachers, 154,893 pupils, and an annual income of $2,457,372; the Slave\r\nStates had 2,797 academies and private schools, with 4,913 teachers,\r\n104,976 pupils, and an annual income of $2,079,724. In the absence of\r\npublic schools, to a large extent, where Slavery exists, the dependence\r\nmust be upon private schools; and yet even here the Slave States fall\r\nbelow the Free States, whether we consider the number of schools, the\r\nnumber of pupils, the number of teachers, or the amount paid for their\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIn _public schools_, open to all, poor and rich alike, the preëminence\r\nof the Free States is complete. Here the figures show a difference as\r\nwide as that between Freedom and Slavery. Their number in the Free\r\nStates is 62,433, with 72,621 teachers, and with 2,769,901 pupils,\r\nsupported at an annual expense of $6,780,337. Their number in the\r\nSlave States is 18,507, with 19,307 teachers, and with 581,861 pupils,\r\nsupported at an annual expense of $2,719,534. This difference may\r\nbe illustrated by details. Virginia, an old State, and more than a\r\nthird larger than Ohio, has 67,353 pupils in her public schools,\r\nwhile the latter State has 484,153. Arkansas, equal in age and size\r\nwith Michigan, has only 8,493 pupils at her public schools, while the\r\nlatter State has 110,455. South Carolina, nearly four times as large as\r\nMassachusetts, has 17,838 pupils at public schools, while the latter\r\nState has 176,475. South Carolina spends for this purpose, annually,\r\n$200,600; Massachusetts, $1,006,795. Baltimore, with a population of\r\n169,054, on the northern verge of Slavery, has school buildings valued\r\nat $105,729; Boston, with a population of 136,881, has school buildings\r\nvalued at $729,502. Baltimore has only 37 public schools, with 138\r\nteachers, and 8,011 pupils, supported at an annual expense of $32,423;\r\nBoston has 203 public schools, with 353 teachers, and 20,369 pupils,\r\nsupported at an annual expense of $237,100. Even these figures do not\r\ndisclose the whole difference; for there exist in the Free States\r\nteachers’ institutes, normal schools, lyceums, and public courses\r\nof lectures, unknown in the region of Slavery. These advantages are\r\nenjoyed by the children of colored persons; and here is a comparison\r\nwhich shows the degradation of the Slave States. It is their habit\r\nparticularly to deride free colored persons. See, now, with what\r\ncause. The number of colored persons in the Free States is 196,016, of\r\nwhom 22,043, or more than one ninth, attend school, which is a larger\r\nproportion than is supplied by the whites of the Slave States. In\r\nMassachusetts there are 9,064 colored persons, of whom 1,439, or nearly\r\none sixth, attend school, which is a much larger proportion than is\r\nsupplied by the whites of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAmong educational establishments are _public libraries_; and here,\r\nagain, the Free States have their customary eminence, whether we\r\nconsider libraries strictly called public, or libraries of the common\r\nschool, Sunday school, college, and church. The disclosures are\r\nstartling. The number of libraries in the Free States is 14,893, and\r\nthe sum-total of volumes is 3,883,617; the number of libraries in the\r\nSlave States is 713, and the sum-total of volumes is 654,194: showing\r\nan excess for Freedom of more than fourteen thousand libraries,\r\nand more than three millions of volumes. In the Free States the\r\ncommon-school libraries are 11,881, and contain 1,589,683 volumes;\r\nin the Slave States they are 186, and contain 57,721 volumes. In the\r\nFree States the Sunday-school libraries are 1,713, and contain 474,241\r\nvolumes; in the Slave States they are 275, and contain 68,080 volumes.\r\nIn the Free States the college libraries are 132, and contain 660,573\r\nvolumes; in the Slave States they are 79, and contain 249,248 volumes.\r\nIn the Free States the church libraries are 109, and contain 52,723\r\nvolumes; in the Slave States they are 21, and contain 5,627 volumes. In\r\nthe Free States the libraries strictly called public, and not included\r\nunder heads already enumerated, are 1,058, and contain 1,106,397\r\nvolumes; those of the Slave States are 152, and contain 273,518 volumes.\r\n\r\nTurn these figures over, look at them in any light, and the conclusion\r\nis irresistible for Freedom. The college libraries alone of the Free\r\nStates are greater than all the libraries of Slavery; so, also, are\r\nthe libraries of Massachusetts alone greater than all the libraries of\r\nSlavery; and the common-school libraries alone of New York are more\r\nthan twice as large as all the libraries of Slavery. Michigan has\r\n107,943 volumes in her libraries; Arkansas has 420; and yet the Acts\r\nfor the admission of these two States into the Union were passed on\r\nthe same day.\r\n\r\nAmong educational establishments, one of the most efficient is the\r\n_press_; and here again all things testify for Freedom. The Free States\r\nexcel in the number of newspapers and periodicals published, whether\r\ndaily, semi-weekly, weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, or quarterly,--and\r\nwhatever their character, whether literary, neutral, political,\r\nreligious, or scientific. The whole aggregate circulation in the Free\r\nStates is 334,146,281, in the Slave States 81,038,693; in Free Michigan\r\n3,247,736, in Slave Arkansas 377,000; in Free Ohio 30,473,407, in\r\nSlave Kentucky 6,582,838; in Slave South Carolina 7,145,930, in Free\r\nMassachusetts 64,820,564,--a larger number than in the twelve Slave\r\nStates, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, and\r\nTexas, combined. This enormous disproportion in the aggregate is also\r\npreserved in the details. In the Slave States political newspapers find\r\nmore favor than all others together; but even of these they publish\r\nonly 47,243,209 copies, while the Free States publish 163,583,668.\r\nNumerous as are political newspapers in the Free States, they form\r\nconsiderably less than one half the aggregate circulation of the Press,\r\nwhile in the Slave States they constitute nearly three fifths. Of\r\nneutral newspapers the Slave States publish 8,812,620, the Free States\r\n79,156,733. Of religious newspapers the Slave States publish 4,364,832,\r\nthe Free States 29,280,652. Of literary journals the Slave States\r\npublish 20,245,360, the Free States 57,478,768. And of scientific\r\njournals the Slave States publish 372,672, the Free States 4,521,260.\r\nOf these last the number of copies published in Massachusetts alone\r\nis 2,033,260,--more than five times the number in the whole land of\r\nSlavery. Thus, in contributions to science, literature, religion,\r\nand even politics, as attested by the activity of the periodical\r\npress, do the Slave States miserably fail,--while darkness gathers\r\nover them, increasing with time. According to the census of 1810, the\r\ndisproportion in this respect between the two regions was only as two\r\nto one; it is now more than four to one, and is still darkening.\r\n\r\nThe same disproportion appears with regard to persons connected with\r\nthe Press. In the Free States the number of _printers_ was 11,812, of\r\nwhom 1,229 were in Massachusetts; in the Slave States there were 2,625,\r\nof whom South Carolina had only 141. In the Free States the number of\r\n_publishers_ was 331; in the Slave States, 24. Of these, Massachusetts\r\nhad 51, or more than twice as many as all the Slave States; while\r\nSouth Carolina had but one. In the Free States the _authors_ were 73;\r\nin the Slave States, 6,--Massachusetts having 17, and South Carolina\r\nnone. These suggestive illustrations are all derived from the last\r\nofficial census. If we go to other sources, the contrast is still the\r\nsame. Of the authors mentioned in Duyckinck’s “Cyclopædia of American\r\nLiterature,” 434 are of the Free States, and only 90 of the Slave\r\nStates. Of the poets mentioned in Griswold’s “Poets and Poetry of\r\nAmerica,” 122 are of the Free States, and only 16 of the Slave States.\r\nOf the poets whose place of birth appears in Read’s “Female Poets of\r\nAmerica,” 71 are of the Free States, and only 11 of the Slave States.\r\nIf we try authors by weight or quality, it is the same as when we\r\ntry them by numbers. Out of the Free States come all whose works\r\nhave a place in the permanent literature of the country,--Irving,\r\nPrescott, Sparks, Bancroft, Emerson, Motley, Hildreth, Hawthorne; also,\r\nBryant, Longfellow, Dana, Halleck, Whittier, Lowell,--and I might add\r\nindefinitely to the list. But what name from the Slave States can find\r\nentrance there?\r\n\r\nA similar disproportion appears in the number of _Patents_, during\r\nthe last three years, 1857, 1858, and 1859, attesting the inventive\r\nindustry of the contrasted regions. In the Free States there were\r\n9,557; in the Slave States, 1,306: making a difference of 8,251 in\r\nfavor of Freedom. The number in Free Massachusetts was 1,351; in Slave\r\nSouth Carolina, 39. The number in Free Connecticut, small in territory\r\nand population, was 628; in Slave Virginia, large in territory and\r\npopulation, 184.\r\n\r\nFrom these things we might infer the _ignorance_ prevalent in the Slave\r\nStates; but this shows itself in specific results of a deplorable\r\ncharacter, authenticated by the official census. In the Slave States\r\nthere were 493,026 native white adults, persons over twenty years of\r\nage, unable to read and write; while in the Free States, with double\r\nthe native white population, there were but 248,725 persons of this\r\nclass in this unhappy predicament: in the Slave States the proportion\r\nbeing 1 in 5 of the adult native whites; in the Free States 1 in 22.\r\nThe number in Free Massachusetts, in an adult native white population\r\nof 470,375, was 1,055, or 1 in 446; the number in Slave South Carolina,\r\nin a like population of only 120,136, was 15,580, or 1 in 8. The number\r\nin Free Connecticut was 1 in 256, in Slave Virginia 1 in 5; in Free New\r\nHampshire 1 in 192, and in Slave North Carolina 1 in 3.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this picture, where the dismal colors all come from\r\nofficial sources, there are two other aspects in which Slavery may be\r\nregarded.\r\n\r\n1. The first is its influence on _emigration_. The official compendium\r\nof the census (page 115) tells us that inhabitants of Slave States\r\nwho are natives of Free States are more numerous than inhabitants of\r\nFree States who are natives of Slave States. This is an egregious\r\nerror. Just the contrary is true. The census of 1850 found 606,139 in\r\nthe Free States who were born in the Slave States, while only 206,624\r\nborn in the Free States were in the Slave States. And since the white\r\npopulation of the Free States is double that of the Slave States, it\r\nappears that the proportion of whites moving from Slavery is six times\r\ngreater than that of whites moving into Slavery. This simple fact\r\ndiscloses something of the aversion to Slavery which is aroused even in\r\nthe Slave States.\r\n\r\n2. The second is furnished by the character of the region on the\r\nborder-line between Freedom and Slavery. In general, the value of\r\nlands in Slave States adjoining Freedom is advanced, while the value\r\nof corresponding lands in Free States is diminished. The effects of\r\nFreedom and Slavery are reciprocal. Slavery is a bad neighbor; Freedom\r\nis a good neighbor. In Virginia, lands naturally poor are, by nearness\r\nto Freedom, worth $12.98 an acre, while richer lands in other parts of\r\nthe State are worth only $8.42. In Illinois, lands bordering on Slavery\r\nare worth only $4.54 an acre, while other lands in Illinois are worth\r\n$8.05. As in the value of lands, so in all other influences is Slavery\r\nfelt for evil, and Freedom felt for good; and thus is it clearly shown\r\nto be for the interest of the Slave States to be surrounded by a circle\r\nof Free States.\r\n\r\nAt every point is the character of Slavery more and more manifest,\r\nrising and dilating into an overshadowing Barbarism, darkening the\r\nwhole land. Through its influence, population, values of all kinds,\r\nmanufactures, commerce, railroads, canals, charities, the post-office,\r\ncolleges, professional schools, academies, public schools, newspapers,\r\nperiodicals, books, authorship, inventions, are all stunted, and, under\r\na Government which professes to be founded on the intelligence of the\r\npeople, one in five of native white adults in the region of Slavery\r\nis officially reported as unable to read and write. Never was the\r\nsaying of Montesquieu more triumphantly verified, that countries are\r\nnot cultivated by reason of their fertility, but by reason of their\r\nliberty. To this truth the Slave States testify perpetually by every\r\npossible voice. Liberty is the powerful agent which drives the plough,\r\nthe spindle, and the keel,--opens avenues of all kinds,--inspires\r\ncharity,--awakens love of knowledge, and supplies the means of\r\ngratifying it. Liberty is the first of schoolmasters: nay, more; it is\r\nthe Baconian philosophy of Civilization, through which the powers and\r\nactivities of man are enlarged beyond measure or imagination.\r\n\r\nUnerring and passionless figures thus far are our witnesses. But their\r\ntestimony will be enhanced by a final glance at the _geographical\r\ncharacter_ of the Slave States; and here there is a singular and\r\ninstructive parallel.\r\n\r\nJefferson described Virginia as “fast sinking” to be “the Barbary of\r\nthe Union,”[50]--meaning, of course, the Barbary of his day, which\r\nhad not yet turned against Slavery. And Franklin also wrote, that he\r\ndid “not wish to see a new Barbary rising in America, and our long\r\nextended coast occupied by piratical States.”[51] In this each spoke\r\nwith prophetic voice. Though on different sides of the Atlantic and on\r\ndifferent continents, our Slave States and the original Barbary States\r\noccupy nearly the same parallels of latitude, occupy nearly the same\r\nextent of longitude, embrace nearly the same number of square miles,\r\nenjoy kindred advantages of climate, being equally removed from the\r\ncold of the North and the burning heat of the tropics, and also have\r\nsimilar boundaries of land and water, affording kindred advantages of\r\nocean and sea, with this difference, that the boundaries of the two\r\nregions are precisely reversed, so that where is land in one is water\r\nin the other, while in both there is the same extent of ocean and the\r\nsame extent of sea. Nor is this all. Algiers, for a long time the\r\nmost obnoxious place in the Barbary States of Africa, once branded by\r\nan indignant chronicler as “the wall of the Barbarian world,”[52] is\r\nsituated near the parallel of 36° 30´ north latitude, being the line of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise, which once marked the wall of Slavery in our\r\ncountry west of the Mississippi, while Morocco, the chief present seat\r\nof Slavery in the African Barbary, is near the parallel of Charleston.\r\nThere are no two spaces on the surface of the globe, equal in extent,\r\n(and careful examination will verify what I am about to state,) which\r\npresent so many distinctive features of resemblance, whether we\r\nconsider the common regions of latitude in which they lie, the common\r\nnature of their boundaries, their common productions, their common\r\nclimate, or the common Barbarism which sought shelter in both. I do\r\nnot stop to inquire why Slavery--banished at last from Europe, banished\r\nalso from that part of this hemisphere which corresponds in latitude to\r\nEurope--should have intrenched itself, in both hemispheres, in similar\r\nregions of latitude, so that Virginia, Carolina, Mississippi, and\r\nMissouri are the American complement to Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, and\r\nTunis. But there is one important point in the parallel which remains\r\nto be fulfilled. The barbarous Emperor of Morocco, in the words of a\r\ntreaty, so long ago as the last century, declared his desire that “the\r\nodious name of Slavery might be effaced from the memory of men”;[53]\r\nwhile Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis, whose tenacity for the Barbarism\r\nwas equalled only by that of South Carolina, have renounced it one\r\nafter another, and delivered it over to the indignation of mankind.\r\nFollowing this example, the parallel will be complete, and our Barbary\r\nwill become the complement in Freedom to the African Barbary, as it\r\nhas already been its complement in Slavery, and is unquestionably its\r\ncomplement in geographical character.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFrom the consideration of Slavery in its practical results, illustrated\r\nby contrast between the Free States and Slave States, I pass to another\r\nstage of the argument, where Slavery appears in its influence on the\r\nCHARACTER OF SLAVE-MASTERS. Nothing could I undertake more painful,\r\nand yet there is nothing more essential to the discussion, especially\r\nin response to pretensions of Senators on this floor, nor is there any\r\npoint on which the evidence is more ample.\r\n\r\nIt is in the Character of Slavery itself that we are to find the\r\nCharacter of Slave-Masters. I need not go back to the golden mouth\r\nof Chrysostom to learn that “Slavery is the fruit of covetousness,\r\nof extravagance, of insatiable greediness”;[54] for we have already\r\nseen that this fivefold enormity is inspired by the single idea of\r\n_compelling men to work without wages_. This spirit must naturally\r\nappear in the Slave-Master. But the eloquent Saint did not disclose the\r\nwhole truth. Slavery is founded on violence, as we have already too\r\nclearly seen; of course it can be sustained only by kindred violence,\r\nsometimes against the defenceless slave, sometimes against the freeman\r\nwhose indignation is aroused at the outrage. It is founded on brutal\r\nand vulgar pretensions, as is unhappily too apparent; of course it can\r\nbe sustained only by kindred brutality and vulgarity. The denial of\r\nall rights in the slave can be sustained only by disregard of other\r\nrights, common to the whole community, whether of the person, the\r\npress, or speech. Where this exists there can be but one supreme law,\r\nto which all other laws, statute or social, are subordinate,--and this\r\nis the pretended law of Slavery. All these things must be manifest in\r\nSlave-Masters; and yet, unconscious of their true condition, they make\r\nboasts which reveal still further the unhappy influence. Barbarous\r\nstandards of conduct are unblushingly avowed. The swagger of a bully\r\nis called chivalry; a swiftness to quarrel is called courage; the\r\nbludgeon is adopted as substitute for argument; and assassination is\r\nlifted to be one of the Fine Arts. Long ago it was fixed certain that\r\nthe day which makes man a slave “takes half his worth away,”--words\r\nfrom the ancient harp of Homer, sounding through long generations.\r\nNothing here is said of the human being at the other end of the chain.\r\nTo aver that on this same day all his worth is taken away might seem\r\ninconsistent with exceptions which we gladly recognize; but, alas! it\r\nis too clear, both from reason and from facts, that, bad as Slavery is\r\nfor the Slave, it is worse for the Master.\r\n\r\nIn making this exposure I am fortified at the outset by two classes of\r\nauthority, whose testimony it will be difficult to question: the first\r\npersonal, and founded on actual experience; the second philosophical,\r\nand founded on everlasting truth.\r\n\r\nFirst, _Personal Authority_. And here I adduce words, often quoted,\r\nwhich dropped from the lips of Slave-Masters in those better days,\r\nwhen, seeing the wrong of Slavery, they escaped from its injurious\r\ninfluence. Of these, none expressed themselves with more vigor than\r\nGeorge Mason, a Slave-Master from Virginia, in debate on the adoption\r\nof the National Constitution. This is his language:--\r\n\r\n    “Slavery discourages arts and manufactures. The poor despise\r\n    labor, when performed by slaves. They prevent the emigration\r\n    of whites, who really enrich and strengthen a country. _They\r\n    produce the most pernicious effect on manners._ EVERY MASTER\r\n    OF SLAVES IS BORN A PETTY TYRANT. They bring the judgment of\r\n    Heaven on a country.”[55]\r\n\r\nThus, with a few touches, does this Slave-Master portray his class,\r\nputting them in that hateful list which, according to every principle\r\nof liberty, must be resisted so long as we obey God. And this clear\r\ntestimony received kindred support from the fiery soul of Jefferson.\r\nHere are his words:--\r\n\r\n    “There must doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of\r\n    our people produced by the existence of Slavery among us. The\r\n    whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise\r\n    of the most boisterous passions, THE MOST UNREMITTING DESPOTISM\r\n    on the one part, and degrading submissions on the other. Our\r\n    children see this, and learn to imitate it.… _The man must be\r\n    a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved\r\n    by such circumstances._ And with what execration should the\r\n    statesman be loaded, who, permitting one half the citizens thus\r\n    to trample on the rights of the other, _transforms those into\r\n    despots_ and these into enemies, destroys the morals of the one\r\n    part and the _amor patriæ_ of the other!… With the morals of\r\n    the people, their industry also is destroyed.”[56]\r\n\r\nNext comes the _Philosophic Authority_. Here, while the language which\r\nI quote may be less familiar, it is hardly less commanding. Among names\r\nof such weight I shall not discriminate, but simply follow the order\r\nof time. First is John Locke, the great author of the English system\r\nof Intellectual Philosophy, who, though once unhappily indulgent to\r\nAmerican Slavery, in another place describes it, in words which every\r\nSlave-Master should know, as--\r\n\r\n    “The state of war continued between a lawful conqueror and a\r\n    captive.” “So directly opposite to the generous temper and\r\n    courage of our nation, that _’tis hardly to be conceived that\r\n    an Englishman_, MUCH LESS A GENTLEMAN, _should plead for\r\n    ’t_.”[57]\r\n\r\nThen comes Adam Smith, the founder of the science of Political Economy,\r\nwho, in his work on Morals, thus utters himself:--\r\n\r\n    “There is not a negro from the coast of Africa who does not\r\n    possess a degree of magnanimity which the soul of his sordid\r\n    master is too often scarce capable of conceiving. Fortune never\r\n    exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind than when she\r\n    subjected those nations of heroes to the refuse of the jails\r\n    of Europe, to wretches who possess the virtues neither of the\r\n    countries which they come from nor of those which they go to,\r\n    _and whose levity, brutality, and baseness so justly expose\r\n    them to the contempt of the vanquished_.”[58]\r\n\r\nThis judgment, pronounced just a century ago, was repelled by the\r\nSlave-Masters of Virginia in a feeble publication, which attests at\r\nleast their own consciousness that they were the criminals arraigned by\r\nthe distinguished philosopher. This was soon followed by the testimony\r\nof the great English moralist, Dr. Johnson, who, in a letter to a\r\nfriend, thus shows his opinion of Slave-Masters:--\r\n\r\n    “To omit for a year, or for a day, the most efficacious method\r\n    of advancing Christianity, in compliance with any purposes that\r\n    terminate on this side of the grave, is a crime of which I\r\n    know not that the world has yet had an example, except in the\r\n    practice of _the planters of America, a race of mortals whom, I\r\n    suppose, no other man wishes to resemble_.”[59]\r\n\r\nThese are British voices. There are French also of equal character,\r\nwhose is the same implacable judgment. First I name Condorcet, who did\r\nso much to develop the idea of Human Progress. Constantly he testifies\r\nagainst Slavery. His brand of it as Barbarism is sententiously\r\nexpressed in a letter to Voltaire, describing a successful\r\nSlave-Master:--\r\n\r\n    “L’Éprémesnil is a little American, who, by dint of plying his\r\n    negroes with the lash, has succeeded in getting enough sugar\r\n    and indigo to buy an office of King’s Councillor in the revenue\r\n    service.”[60]\r\n\r\nVoltaire adds to this expression other words kindred in scorn:--\r\n\r\n    “The American savage of whom you speak does not astonish me;\r\n    but he frightens me, for I know beyond doubt that he is of the\r\n    horde of other French savages who have sworn immortal hate to\r\n    reason.”[61]\r\n\r\nIn harmony with these is that famous irony of Montesquieu, where,\r\nspeaking of the Africans, he says:--\r\n\r\n    “It is impossible that we should suppose these people men;\r\n    because, if we supposed them men, the world would begin to\r\n    think that we ourselves were not Christians.”[62]\r\n\r\nOther countries might testify; but this is enough.\r\n\r\nWith such authorities, Personal and Philosophic, American and Foreign,\r\nI need not hesitate in this ungracious task; but Truth, which is\r\nmightier than Mason and Jefferson, than John Locke, Adam Smith, and\r\nSamuel Johnson, than Condorcet, Voltaire, and Montesquieu, marshals\r\nthe evidence in unbroken succession.\r\n\r\nProceeding with the argument, broadening as we advance, we shall see\r\nSlave-Masters (1) in the Law of Slavery, (2) in relations with Slaves,\r\n(3) in relations with each other and with Society, and (4) in that\r\nunconsciousness which renders them insensible to their true character.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1.) As in considering the Character of Slavery, so in considering the\r\nCharacter of Slave-Masters, we must begin with the _Law of Slavery_,\r\nwhich, as their work, testifies against them. In the face of this\r\nunutterable abomination, where impiety, cruelty, brutality, and robbery\r\nall strive for mastery, it is vain to assert humanity or refinement\r\nin its authors. Full well I know that the conscience, which speaks\r\nso powerfully to the solitary soul, is often silent in the corporate\r\nbody, and that, in all ages and countries, numbers, when gathered in\r\ncommunities and States, have sanctioned acts from which the individual\r\nrevolts. And yet I know no surer way of judging a people than by its\r\nlaws, especially where those laws have been long continued and openly\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the eminence of individual virtue,--and I would not\r\nso far disparage humanity as to suppose that offences so general\r\nwhere Slavery exists are universal,--it is not reasonable or logical\r\nto infer that the body of Slave-Masters are better than the Law of\r\nSlavery. And since the Law itself degrades the slave to be a chattel,\r\nand submits him to irresponsible control,--with power to bind and to\r\nscourge, to usurp the fruits of another’s labor, to pollute the body,\r\nand to outrage all ties of family, making marriage impossible,--we\r\nmust conclude that such enormities are sanctioned by Slave-Masters;\r\nwhile the refusal of testimony, and the denial of instruction, by\r\nsupplementary law, complete the evidence of complicity. And this\r\nconclusion must stand unquestioned, just so long as the Law of Slavery\r\nexists unrepealed. So mild and philosophical a judge as Tocqueville\r\nsays, in his authoritative work: “The legislation of the Southern\r\nStates with regard to slaves at the present day exhibits such\r\nunparalleled atrocities as suffice to show that the laws of humanity\r\nhave been totally perverted, and to betray the desperate position of\r\nthe community in which that legislation has been promulgated.”[63]\r\nAll of which is too true. Cease, then, to blazon the humanity of\r\nSlave-Masters. Tell me not of the lenity with which this cruel Code is\r\ntempered to its unhappy subjects. Tell me not of the sympathy which\r\noverflows from the mansion of the master to the cabin of the slave. In\r\nvain you assert such “happy accidents.” In vain you show individuals\r\nwho do not exert the wickedness of the law. The Barbarism still\r\nendures, solemnly, legislatively, judicially attested in the very SLAVE\r\nCODE, and proclaiming constantly the character of its authors. And this\r\nis the first article in the evidence against Slave-Masters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2.) I am next brought to _Slave-Masters in their relations with\r\nSlaves_; and here the argument is founded on facts, and on presumptions\r\nirresistible as facts. Only lately has inquiry burst into that gloomy\r\nworld of bondage, and disclosed its secrets. But enough is already\r\nknown to arouse the indignant condemnation of mankind. For instance,\r\nhere is a simple advertisement--one of thousands--from the _Georgia\r\nMessenger_:--\r\n\r\n    “RUN AWAY.--My man Fountain; has holes in his ears, a scar on\r\n    the right side of his forehead; has been shot in the hind parts\r\n    of his legs; is marked on his back with the whip. Apply to\r\n    Robert Beasley, Macon, Ga.”\r\n\r\nHoles in the ears; scar on the forehead; shot in the legs; and marks\r\nof the lash on the back! Such are tokens by which the Slave-Master\r\nidentifies his slave.\r\n\r\nHere is another advertisement, revealing Slave-Masters in a different\r\nlight. It is from the _National Intelligencer_, published at the\r\ncapital; and I confess the pain with which I cite such an indecency\r\nin a journal of much respectability. Of course it appeared without\r\nthe knowledge of the editors; but it is none the less an illustrative\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n    “FOR SALE.--An accomplished and handsome lady’s-maid. She is\r\n    just sixteen years of age; was raised in a genteel family in\r\n    Maryland; and is now proposed to be sold, not for any fault,\r\n    but simply because the owner has no further use for her. A\r\n    note directed to C. D., Gadsby’s Hotel, will receive prompt\r\n    attention.”\r\n\r\nA sated libertine, in a land where vice is legalized, could not expose\r\nhis victim with apter words.\r\n\r\nThese two instances illustrate a class.\r\n\r\nIn the recent work of Mr. Olmsted, a close observer and traveller in\r\nthe Slave States, which abounds in pictures of Slavery, drawn with\r\ncaution and evident regard to truth, is another, where a Slave-Master\r\nthus frankly confesses his experience:--\r\n\r\n    “‘I can tell you how you can break a nigger of running away,\r\n    certain,’ said the Slave-Master. ‘There was an old fellow I\r\n    used to know in Georgia, that always cured his so. If a nigger\r\n    ran away, when he caught him, he would bind his knee over a\r\n    log, and fasten him so he couldn’t stir; then he’d take a pair\r\n    of pincers, and pull one of his toe-nails out by the roots, and\r\n    tell him, that, if he ever run away again, he would pull out\r\n    two of them, and if he run away again after that, he told him\r\n    he’d pull out four of them, and so on, doubling each time. He\r\n    never had to do it more than twice; it always cured them.’”[64]\r\n\r\nLike this story, from the lips of a Slave-Master, is another, where the\r\nmaster, angry because his slave sought to regain his God-given liberty,\r\ndeliberately cut the tendons of his heel, thus horribly maiming him for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn vain these instances are denied. Their accumulating number,\r\nauthenticated in every possible manner, by the press, by a cloud of\r\nwitnesses, and by the confession of Slave-Masters, stares us constantly\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\nHere we are brought again to the Slave Code, under the shelter of which\r\nthese things, and worse, are done with complete impunity. Listen to\r\nthe remarkable words of Mr. Justice Ruffin, of North Carolina, who, in\r\na solemn decision, thus portrays, affirms, and deplores this terrible\r\nlatitude. The obedience of the slave, he says,--\r\n\r\n    “is the consequence only of _uncontrolled authority over the\r\n    body.… The power of the master must be absolute, to render\r\n    the submission of the slave perfect._ I most freely confess\r\n    my sense of the harshness of this proposition. I feel it as\r\n    deeply as any man can. And, as a principle of moral right,\r\n    every person in his retirement must repudiate it. But in the\r\n    actual condition of things it must be so. There is no remedy.\r\n    _This discipline belongs to the state of Slavery.…_ It is\r\n    inherent in the relation of master and slave.”[65]\r\n\r\nThis same license is thus expounded in a recent judicial decision of\r\nVirginia:--\r\n\r\n    “It is the policy of the law in respect to the relation\r\n    of master and slave, and for the sake of securing proper\r\n    subordination and obedience on the part of the slave, _to\r\n    protect the master from prosecution, even if the whipping and\r\n    punishment be malicious, cruel, and excessive_.”[66]\r\n\r\nCan Barbarism further go? Here is irresponsible power, rendered more\r\nirresponsible still by the seclusion of the plantation, and absolutely\r\nfortified by supplementary law excluding the testimony of slaves. That\r\nunder its shelter enormities should occur, stranger than fiction, too\r\nterrible for imagination, and surpassing any attested experience, is\r\nsimply according to the course of Nature and the course of history.\r\nAntiquity has illustrations which are most painful. From Ovid we learn\r\nhow the porter was chained at his master’s gate;[67] by Plautus we\r\nare introduced to the various instruments of punishment, in fearful\r\ncatalogue;[68] and in the pages of the philosopher Seneca we are\r\nsaddened by the cruelties of which the slave was victim.[69] A later\r\nwriter, the great teacher of medicine, Galen, describes men knocking\r\nout the teeth of slaves with the fist, falling upon them not only with\r\nfist, but with the heels, and gouging the eyes with a pen, if at hand,\r\nas did the Emperor Adrian on one occasion;[70] while Tacitus shows\r\nhow four hundred slaves in the house of an assassinated master were\r\nhanded over to vindictive death.[71] St. Chrysostom portrays a mistress\r\ndragging a slave-girl by the hair, and herself applying the whip, until\r\nthe cries of her bruised victim filled the whole house and penetrated\r\nthe street.[72]\r\n\r\nAll this is ancient Barbarism, according to the evidence; but the\r\nanalogies of life show that such things must be, where Slavery\r\nprevails. The visitation of the abbeys in England disclosed vice and\r\ndisorder in startling forms, cloaked by the irresponsible privacy of\r\nmonastic life. A similar visitation of plantations would disclose more\r\nfearful results, cloaked by the irresponsible privacy of Slavery. Every\r\nSlave-Master on his plantation is a Bashaw, with all the prerogatives\r\nof a Turk. According to Hobbes, he is a “petty king.” This is true;\r\nand every plantation is of itself a petty kingdom, with more than the\r\nimmunities of an abbey. Six thousand skulls of infants are reported\r\nto have been taken from a single fish-pond near a nunnery, to the\r\ndismay of Pope Gregory.[73] Under the Law of Slavery, infants, the\r\noffspring of masters “who dream of Freedom in a slave’s embrace,” are\r\nnot thrown into a fish-pond, but something worse is done. They are\r\nsold. This is a single glimpse only. Slavery, in its recesses, is\r\nanother Bastile, whose horrors will never be known until it shall be\r\nrazed to the ground; it is the dismal castle of Giant Despair, which,\r\nwhen captured by the Pilgrims, excited their wonder, as they saw “the\r\ndead bodies that lay here and there in the castle-yard, and how full\r\nof dead men’s bones the dungeon was.” The recorded horrors of Slavery\r\nare infinite, and each day, by the escape of its victims, they are\r\nstill further attested, while the door of the vast prison-house is\r\nleft ajar. But, alas! unless examples of history and lessons of\r\npolitical wisdom are alike delusive, its unrecorded horrors must\r\nassume a form of more fearful dimensions. Baffling all attempts at\r\ndescription, they sink into that chapter of Sir Thomas Browne entitled\r\n“Of some Relations whose Truth we fear,” and among kindred things\r\nwhereof, according to this eloquent philosopher, “there remains no\r\nregister but that of Hell.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this picture of the relations of Slave-Masters with their slaves\r\ncould receive any darker coloring, it would be by introducing\r\nfigures of the congenial agents through which the Barbarism is\r\nmaintained,--_the Slave-Overseer, the Slave-Breeder, and the\r\nSlave-Hunter_, each without a peer except in the brothers, and the\r\nwhole constituting a triumvirate of Slavery, in whom its essential\r\nbrutality, vulgarity, and crime are all embodied. There is the\r\nSlave-Overseer, with bloody lash,--fitly described, in his Life of\r\nPatrick Henry, by Mr. Wirt, who, born in a Slave State, knew the class,\r\nas “last and lowest, most abject, degraded, unprincipled,”[74]--and\r\nhis hands wield at will the irresponsible power, being proper successor\r\nto “the devil,” described by the English dramatist, who appeared\r\n\r\n              “_in Virginia_, and commanded\r\n    With many stripes; for that’s his cruel custom.”[75]\r\n\r\nThere is next the Slave-Breeder, who assumes a higher character, even\r\nentering legislative halls, where, in unconscious insensibility, he\r\nshocks civilization by denying, like Mr. Gholson, of Virginia, any\r\nalleged distinction between the “female slave” and the “brood mare,” by\r\nopenly asserting the necessary respite from work during the gestation\r\nof the female slave as the ground of property in her offspring, and by\r\nproclaiming that in this “vigintial” crop of human flesh consists much\r\nof the wealth of his State,--while another Virginian, not yet hardened\r\nto this debasing trade, whose annual sacrifice reaches twenty-five\r\nthousand human souls, confesses the indignation and shame with which\r\nhe beholds his State “converted into _one grand menagerie_, where men\r\nare reared for the market, like oxen for the shambles.” Verily the\r\nquestion may be asked, Have we a Guinea among us? And, lastly, there is\r\nthe Slave-Hunter, with the bloodhound as his brutal symbol, who pursues\r\nslaves as the hunter pursues game, and does not hesitate in the public\r\nprints to advertise his Barbarism thus:--\r\n\r\n    “BLOODHOUNDS.--I have TWO of the FINEST DOGS for CATCHING\r\n    NEGROES in the Southwest. They can take the trail TWELVE\r\n    HOURS after the NEGRO HAS PASSED, and catch him with ease. I\r\n    live four miles southwest of Bolivar, on the road leading\r\n    from Bolivar to Whitesville. I am ready at all times to catch\r\n    runaway negroes.\r\n\r\n    “DAVID TURNER.\r\n\r\n    “March 2, 1853.”[76]\r\n\r\nThe bloodhound was known in early Scottish history; it was once\r\nvindictively put upon the trail of Robert Bruce, and in barbarous\r\ndays, by cruel license of war, was directed against the marauders of\r\nthe Scottish border. Walter Scott makes one of his heroes “cheer the\r\ndark blood-hound on his way”; but more than a century has passed since\r\nthe last survivor of the race was seen in Ettrick Forest.[77] The\r\nbloodhound was employed by Spain against the natives of this continent,\r\nand the eloquence of Chatham never touched a truer chord than when,\r\ngathering force from the condemnation of this brutality, he poured\r\nhis thunder upon the kindred brutality of the scalping-knife, adopted\r\nas an instrument of war by a nation professing civilization. Tardily\r\nintroduced into this Republic some time after the Missouri Compromise,\r\nwhen Slavery became a political passion and Slave-Masters began to\r\nthrow aside all disguise, the bloodhound has become the representative\r\nof our Barbarism, when engaged in the pursuit of a fellow-man\r\nasserting his inborn title to himself; and this brute becomes typical\r\nof the whole brutal leash of Slave-Hunters, who, whether at home on\r\nSlave Soil, under the name of Slave-Catchers and Kidnappers, or at a\r\ndistance, under politer names, insult Human Nature by the enforcement\r\nof this Barbarism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(3.) From this dreary picture of Slave-Masters with their slaves and\r\ntheir triumvirate of vulgar instruments, I pass to another more dreary\r\nstill, and more completely exposing the influence of Slavery: I mean\r\nthe _relations of Slave-Masters with each other_, also _with Society_\r\nand _Government_,--or, in other words, the Character of Slave-Masters,\r\nas displayed in the general relations of life. Here again I need your\r\nindulgence. Not in triumph or in taunt do I approach this branch of the\r\nsubject. Yielding only to the irresistible exigency of the discussion,\r\nand in direct reply to the assumptions on this floor, especially by the\r\nSenator from Virginia [Mr. MASON], I proceed. If I touch Slavery to\r\nthe quick, and make Slave-Masters see themselves as others see them, I\r\nshall do nothing beyond the strictest line of duty in this debate.\r\n\r\nOne of the choicest passages of the master Italian poet, Dante, is\r\nwhere we are permitted to behold a passage of transcendent virtue\r\nsculptured in “visible speech” on the long gallery leading to the\r\nHeavenly Gate. The poet felt the inspiration of the scene, and placed\r\nit on the wayside, where it could charm and encourage. This was\r\nnatural. Nobody can look upon virtue and justice, if only in images and\r\npictures, without feeling a kindred sentiment. Nobody can be surrounded\r\nby vice and wrong, by violence and brutality, if only in images and\r\npictures, without coming under their degrading influence. Nobody can\r\nlive with the one without advantage; nobody can live with the other\r\nwithout loss. Who could pass life in the secret chamber where are\r\ngathered the impure relics of Pompeii, without becoming indifferent\r\nto loathsome things? But if these loathsome things are not merely\r\nsculptured and painted,--if they exist in living reality,--if they\r\nenact their hideous, open indecencies, as in the criminal pretensions\r\nof Slavery,--while the lash plays and the blood spurts,--while women\r\nare whipped and children are sold,--while marriage is polluted and\r\nannulled,--while the parental tie is rudely torn,--while honest gains\r\nare filched or robbed,--while the soul itself is shut down in all the\r\ndarkness of ignorance, and God himself is defied in the pretension\r\nthat man can have property in his fellow-man,--if all these things\r\nare “visible,” not merely in images and pictures, but in reality, the\r\ninfluence on character must be incalculably deplorable.\r\n\r\nAccording to irresistible law men are fashioned by what is about them,\r\nwhether climate, scenery, life, or institutions. Like produces like,\r\nand this ancient proverb is verified always. Look at the miner, delving\r\nlow down in darkness, and the mountaineer, ranging on airy heights, and\r\nyou will see a contrast in character, and even in personal form. The\r\ndifference between a coward and a hero may be traced in the atmosphere\r\nwhich each has breathed,--and how much more in the institutions under\r\nwhich each is reared! If institutions generous and just ripen souls\r\nalso generous and just, then other institutions must exhibit their\r\ninfluence also. Violence, brutality, injustice, barbarism, must be\r\nreproduced in the lives of all living within their fatal sphere. The\r\nmeat eaten by man enters into and becomes part of his body; the madder\r\neaten by the dog changes his bones to red; and the Slavery on which men\r\nlive, in all its fivefold foulness, must become part of themselves,\r\ndiscoloring the very soul, blotting the character, and breaking\r\nforth in moral leprosy. This language is strong, but the evidence\r\nis even stronger. Some there may be of happy natures--like honorable\r\nSenators--who can thus feed and not be harmed. Mithridates fed on\r\npoison, and lived. It may be that there is a moral Mithridates, who can\r\nswallow without bane the poison of Slavery.\r\n\r\nInstead of “ennobling” the master, nothing is clearer than that the\r\nslave drags his master down; and this process, beginning in childhood,\r\nis continued through life. Living much in association with his slave,\r\nthe master finds nothing to remind him of his own deficiencies, to\r\nprompt his ambition or excite his shame. He is only a little better\r\nthan his predecessor in ancient Germany, as described by Tacitus,\r\nwho was distinguishable from his slave by none of the charms of\r\neducation, while the two burrowed among the same flocks and in the same\r\nground.[78] Without provocation to virtue, or elevating example, he\r\nnaturally shares the Barbarism of the society he keeps. Thus the very\r\ninferiority which the Slave-Master attributes to the African explains\r\nthe melancholy condition of the communities in which his degradation is\r\ndeclared by law.\r\n\r\nA single false principle or vicious thought may debase a character\r\notherwise blameless; and this is practically true of the Slave-Master.\r\nAccustomed to regard men as property, the sensibilities are blunted\r\nand the moral sense is obscured. He consents to acts from which\r\nCivilization recoils. The early Church sacrificed its property, and\r\neven its sacred vessels, for the redemption of captives. On a memorable\r\noccasion this was done by St. Ambrose,[79] and successive canons\r\nconfirmed the example. But in the Slave States all is reversed.\r\nSlaves there are hawked as property of the Church[80]; and an instance\r\nis related of a slave sold in South Carolina to buy plate for the\r\ncommunion-table. Who can estimate the effect of such an example?\r\n\r\nSurrounded by pernicious influences of all kinds, positive and\r\nnegative, the first making him do that which he ought not to do,\r\nand the second making him leave undone that which he ought to have\r\ndone,--through childhood, youth, and manhood, even unto age,--unable,\r\nwhile at home, to escape these influences, overshadowed constantly by\r\nthe portentous Barbarism about him, the Slave-Master naturally adopts\r\nthe bludgeon, the revolver, and the bowie-knife. Through these he\r\ngoverns his plantation, and secretly armed with these enters the world.\r\nThese are his congenial companions. To wear these is his pride; to use\r\nthem becomes a passion, almost a necessity. Nothing contributes to\r\nviolence so much as wearing the instruments of violence, thus having\r\nthem always at hand to obey a lawless instinct. A barbarous standard\r\nis established; the duel is not dishonorable; a contest peculiar to\r\nour Slave-Masters, known as a “street fight,” is not shameful; and\r\nmodern imitators of Cain have a mark set upon them, not for reproach\r\nand condemnation, but for compliment and approval. In kindred spirit,\r\nthe Count of Eisenburg, presenting to Erasmus a handsome dagger, called\r\nit “the pen with which he used to combat saucy fellows.”[81] How weak\r\nthat dagger against the pen of Erasmus! I wish to keep within bounds;\r\nbut unanswerable facts, accumulating in fearful quantities, attest that\r\nthe social system so much vaunted by honorable Senators, which we are\r\nnow asked to sanction and extend, takes its character from this spirit,\r\nand, with professions of Christianity on the lips, becomes Cain-like.\r\nAnd this is aggravated by the prevailing ignorance in the Slave States,\r\nwhere one in five of the adult white population of native birth is\r\nunable to read and write.\r\n\r\n    “The boldest they who least partake the light,\r\n    As game-cocks in the dark are trained to fight.”\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions, which we all gladly recognize; but it is this\r\nspirit which predominates and gives the social law. Again we see the\r\nlordlings of France, as pictured by Camille Desmoulins, “ordinarily\r\nvery feeble in arguments, since from the cradle they are accustomed to\r\nuse their _will_ as right hand and their _reason_ as left hand.”[82]\r\nViolence ensues. And here mark an important difference. Elsewhere\r\nviolence shows itself in _spite_ of law, whether social or statute;\r\nin the Slave States it is _because_ of law, both social and statute.\r\nElsewhere it is pursued and condemned; in the Slave States it is\r\nadopted and honored. Elsewhere it is hunted as a crime; in the Slave\r\nStates it takes its place among the honorable graces of society.\r\n\r\nLet not these harsh statements stand on my authority. Listen to the\r\ntestimony of two Governors of Slave States in messages to their\r\nrespective Legislatures.\r\n\r\nSaid the Governor of Kentucky, in 1837:--\r\n\r\n    “We long to see the day when the law will assert its majesty,\r\n    and stop the wanton destruction of life which almost _daily_\r\n    occurs within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. _Men\r\n    slaughter each other with almost perfect impunity._ A species\r\n    of Common Law has grown up in Kentucky, which, were it written\r\n    down, would, in all civilized countries, cause it to be\r\n    re-christened, in derision, _the Land of Blood_.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the official confession of a Slave-Master, Governor of\r\nKentucky. And here is the official confession made the same year by the\r\nSlave-Master Governor of Alabama:--\r\n\r\n    “We hear of homicides in different parts of the State\r\n    continually, and yet have few convictions, and still fewer\r\n    executions. Why do we hear of _stabbings and shootings almost\r\n    daily_ in some part or other of our State?”\r\n\r\nA land of blood! Stabbings and shootings almost daily! Such is official\r\nlanguage. It was natural that contemporary newspapers should repeat\r\nwhat found utterance in high places. Here is the confession of a\r\nnewspaper in Mississippi:--\r\n\r\n    “The moral atmosphere in our State appears to be in a\r\n    _deleterious and sanguinary condition_. Almost every exchange\r\n    paper which reaches us contains _some inhuman and revolting\r\n    case of murder or death by violence_.”[83]\r\n\r\nHere is another confession, by a newspaper in New Orleans:--\r\n\r\n    “In view of the crimes which are daily committed, we are led to\r\n    inquire whether it is owing to the inefficiency of our laws, or\r\n    to the manner in which these laws are administered, _that this\r\n    frightful deluge of human blood flows through our streets and\r\n    our places of public resort_.”[84]\r\n\r\nAnd here is testimony of a different character:--\r\n\r\n    “As I left my native State on account of Slavery, and deserted\r\n    the home of my fathers to escape the sound of the lash and the\r\n    shrieks of tortured victims, I would gladly bury in oblivion\r\n    the recollection of those scenes with which I have been\r\n    familiar; but this may not, cannot be.”[85]\r\n\r\nThese are the words of a Southern lady, daughter of the accomplished\r\nJudge Grimké, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of affrays between politicians, commonly known as “street\r\nfights,”--I use the phrase furnished by the land of Slavery,--would\r\nshow that these authorities are not mistaken. That famous Dutch\r\npicture, admired particularly from successful engraving, and called\r\n_The Knife-Fighters_,[86] presents a scene less revolting than one\r\nof these. Two or more men, armed to the teeth, meet in the streets,\r\nat a court-house, or a tavern, shoot at each other with revolvers,\r\nthen gash each other with knives, close, and roll upon the ground,\r\ncovered with dirt and blood, struggling and stabbing, till death,\r\nprostration, or surrender puts an end to the conflict. Each instance\r\ntells its shameful story, and cries out against the social system\r\ntolerating such Barbarism. A catalogue of duels would testify again to\r\nthe reckless disregard of life where Slavery exists, while it exhibited\r\nViolence flaunting in the garb of Honor, and prating of a barbarous\r\ncode disowned equally by reason and religion. But you have already\r\nsurfeited with horrors, and I hasten on.\r\n\r\nAncient Civilization did not condemn assassination. Statues were raised\r\nto Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who slew Hipparchus. Brutus and Cassius\r\nwere glorified. Modern Civilization judges otherwise; but Slavery, not\r\ncontent with the Duel, which was unknown to Antiquity, rejoices in\r\nassassinations also,--rejoices in both.\r\n\r\nPardon me, if I stop for one moment to expose and denounce the Duel.\r\nI do it only because it belongs to the brood of Slavery. Long ago an\r\nenlightened Civilization rejected this relic of Barbarism, and never\r\nwas one part of the argument against it put more sententiously than\r\nby Franklin. “A duel decides nothing,” said this patriot philosopher;\r\nand the person appealing to it “makes himself judge in his own cause,\r\ncondemns the offender without a jury, and undertakes himself to be the\r\nexecutioner.”[87] To these emphatic words I add two brief propositions,\r\nwhich, if practically adopted, make the Duel impossible: first, that\r\nthe acknowledgment of wrong, with apology or explanation, can never\r\nbe otherwise than honorable; and, secondly, that, in the absence of\r\nsuch acknowledgment, no wrong can be repaired by gladiatorial contest,\r\nwhere brute force, or skill, or chance must decide the day. Iron and\r\nadamant are not stronger than these arguments; nor can any one attempt\r\nan answer without exposing his feebleness. And yet Slave-Masters,\r\ndisregarding its irrational character, insensible to its folly,\r\nheedless of its impiety, and unconscious of its Barbarism, openly\r\nadopt the Duel as regulator of manners and conduct. Two voices from\r\nSouth Carolina have been raised against it, and I mention them with\r\ngladness as testimony from that land of Slavery. The first was Charles\r\nCotesworth Pinckney, who, in the early days of the Republic, after\r\nasking if there were “no way of abolishing throughout the Union this\r\nabsurd and _barbarous_ custom,” invoked the clergy of his State, “as\r\na particular favor, at some convenient early day, to preach a sermon\r\non the sin and folly of duelling.”[88] The other was Mr. Rhett, who,\r\non this floor, openly declared, as his reason for declining the Duel,\r\n“that he feared God more than man.”[89] Generous words, for which many\r\nerrors will be pardoned. But these voices condemn the social system of\r\nwhich the Duel is a natural product.\r\n\r\nLooking at the broad surface of society where Slavery exists, we find\r\nits spirit actively manifest against all freedom of speech and the\r\npress, especially with regard to this wrong. Nobody in the Slave States\r\ncan speak or print plainly about Slavery, except at peril of life or\r\nliberty; and a curious instance shows how this same spirit is carried\r\nby our Slave-Masters into foreign lands. As early as 1789, and in\r\nParis, a poor play,[90] where Slavery was painted truthfully, excited\r\nthe hostility of what Baron Grimm, who reports the incident, calls\r\n“an American cabal,” so that its failure was attributed by some to\r\nthis influence, being the early prototype of that so strong among us.\r\nSt. Paul could call upon the people of Athens to give up the worship\r\nof unknown gods; he could live in his own hired house at Rome, and\r\npreach Christianity in this Heathen metropolis; but no man can be heard\r\nagainst Slavery in Charleston or Mobile. We condemn the Inquisition,\r\nwhich subjects all within its influence to censorship and secret\r\njudgment; but this tyranny is repeated in American Slave-Masters.\r\nTruths as simple as the great discovery of Galileo are openly denied,\r\nand all who declare them are driven to recant. We condemn the “Index\r\nExpurgatorius” of the Roman Church; but American Slave-Masters have\r\nan Index where are inscribed all the generous books of the age. One\r\nbook, the marvel of recent literature, “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” is treated\r\nthus by the Church as by Slave-Masters, being honored by the same\r\nsuppression at the Vatican as at Charleston.\r\n\r\nNot to dwell on these instances, there is one which has a most\r\ninstructive ridiculousness. A religious discourse of the late Dr.\r\nChanning on West India Emancipation--the last effort of his beautiful\r\nlife--was offered for sale by a book agent at Charleston. A prosecution\r\nby the South Carolina Association ensued, and the agent was held\r\nto bail in the sum of one thousand dollars. Shortly afterward, the\r\nsame agent received for sale a work by Dickens, “American Notes,”\r\nfreshly published; but, determined not to expose himself again to the\r\ntyrannical Inquisition, he gave notice through the newspapers that the\r\nbook would “be submitted to highly intelligent members of the South\r\nCarolina Association for _inspection_, and _if_ the sale is approved by\r\nthem, it will be for sale,--if not, not.”[91]\r\n\r\nListen also to another recent instance, as recounted in the “Montgomery\r\nMail,” a newspaper of Alabama.\r\n\r\n    “Last Saturday we devoted to the flames a large number of\r\n    copies of Spurgeon’s Sermons, and the pile was graced at the\r\n    top with a copy of ‘Graves’s Great Iron Wheel,’ which a Baptist\r\n    friend presented for the purpose. We trust that the works of\r\n    the greasy cockney vociferator may receive the same treatment\r\n    throughout the South. And if the Pharisaical author should ever\r\n    show himself in these parts, we trust that a stout cord may\r\n    speedily find its way around his eloquent throat. He has proved\r\n    himself a dirty, low-bred slanderer, and ought to be treated\r\n    accordingly.”\r\n\r\nVery recently we had the opportunity of reading in the journals, that\r\nthe trustees of a college in Alabama resolved against Dr. Wayland’s\r\nadmirable work on Moral Science, as containing “Abolition doctrine of\r\nthe deepest dye,” and proceeded to denounce “the said book, and forbid\r\nits further use in the Institute.”\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Wilberforce in the British Parliament, and especially\r\nthose magnificent efforts of Brougham, where he exposed “the wild\r\nand guilty fantasy that man can hold property in man,” were insanely\r\ndenounced by the British planters in the West Indies; but our\r\nSlave-Masters go further. Speeches delivered in the Senate are stopped\r\nat the Post-Office; booksellers receiving them have been mobbed; and on\r\nat least one occasion the speeches were solemnly proceeded against by a\r\nGrand Jury.[92]\r\n\r\nAll this is natural, for tyranny is condemned to be consistent with\r\nitself. Proclaim Slavery a permanent institution, instead of a\r\ntemporary Barbarism, soon to pass away, and then, by the unhesitating\r\nlogic of self-preservation, all things must yield to its support.\r\nThe safety of Slavery becomes the supreme law. And since Slavery\r\nis endangered by Liberty in any form, therefore all Liberty must\r\nbe restrained. Such is the philosophy of this seeming paradox in\r\na Republic. And our Slave-Masters show themselves apt. Violence\r\nand brutality are their ready instruments, quickened always by the\r\nwakefulness of suspicion, and perhaps often by the restlessness of\r\nuneasy conscience. The Lion’s Mouth of Venice is open everywhere in the\r\nSlave States; nor are wanting the gloomy cells and the Bridge of Sighs.\r\n\r\nThis spirit has recently shown itself with such intensity and activity\r\nas to constitute what is properly termed a Reign of Terror. Northern\r\nmen, unless recognized as delegates to a Democratic Convention, are\r\nexposed in their travels, whether for business or health. They are\r\nwatched and dogged, as in a land of Despotism,--are treated with the\r\nmeanness of disgusting tyranny,--and live in peril always of personal\r\nindignity, often of life and limb. Complaint is sometimes made of\r\nwrongs to American citizens in Mexico; but the last year witnessed\r\noutrages on American citizens perpetrated in the Slave States exceeding\r\nthose in Mexico. Here, again, I have no time for details, already\r\npresented in other quarters. Instances are from all conditions of life\r\nand in various quarters. In Missouri, a Methodist clergyman, suspected\r\nof being an Abolitionist, was taken to prison, amidst threats of tar\r\nand feathers. In Arkansas, a schoolmaster was driven from the State.\r\nIn Kentucky, a plain citizen from Indiana, on a visit to his friends,\r\nwas threatened with death by the rope. In Alabama, a simple person from\r\nConnecticut, peddling books, was thrust into prison, amidst cries of\r\n“Shoot him! Hang him!” In Virginia, a Shaker, from New York, peddling\r\ngarden-seeds, was forcibly expelled from the State. In Georgia, a\r\nmerchant’s clerk, Irish by birth, who simply asked the settlement of a\r\njust debt, was cast into prison, robbed of his pocket-book containing\r\nnearly one hundred dollars, and barely escaped with life. In South\r\nCarolina, a stone-cutter, also an Irishman, was stripped naked, and\r\nthen, amidst cries of “Brand him!” “Burn him!” “Spike him to death!”\r\nscourged so that blood came at every stroke, while tar was poured upon\r\nthe lacerated flesh. These atrocities, calculated, according to the\r\nwords of a great poet, to “make a holiday in Hell,” were all ordained\r\nby Vigilance Committees, or that swiftest magistrate, Judge Lynch,\r\ninspired by the demon of Slavery.\r\n\r\n    “He let them loose, and cried, Halloo!\r\n    How shall we yield him honor due?”[93]\r\n\r\nIn perfect shamelessness, and as if to blazon this fiendish spirit, we\r\nhave this winter had an article in a leading newspaper of Virginia,\r\noffering twenty-five dollars each for the heads of citizens, mostly\r\nMembers of Congress, known to be against Slavery, with fifty thousand\r\ndollars for the head of William H. Seward. In still another paper\r\nof Virginia we find a proposition to raise ten thousand dollars for\r\nthe kidnapping, and delivery at Richmond, of a venerable citizen,\r\nJoshua R. Giddings, “or five thousand dollars for the production of\r\nhis head.” These are fresh instances, but not alone. At a meeting of\r\nSlave-Masters in Georgia, in 1836, the Governor was recommended to\r\nissue a proclamation offering five thousand dollars as a reward for\r\nthe apprehension of _either_ of ten persons named in the resolution,\r\ncitizens of New York and Massachusetts, and one a subject of Great\r\nBritain,--neither of whom was it pretended had ever set foot on the\r\nsoil of Georgia. The Milledgeville “Federal Union,” a newspaper of\r\nGeorgia, in 1836, contained an offer of ten thousand dollars for\r\nkidnapping a clergyman residing in the city of New York. A Committee of\r\nVigilance in Louisiana, in 1835, offered, in the “Louisiana Journal,”\r\nfifty thousand dollars to any person who would deliver into their\r\nhands Arthur Tappan, a liberty-loving merchant of New York; and during\r\nthe same year a public meeting in Alabama, with a person entitled\r\n“Honorable” in the chair, offered a similar reward of fifty thousand\r\ndollars for the apprehension of the same Arthur Tappan, and of La Roy\r\nSunderland, a clergyman of the Methodist Church in New York.\r\n\r\nThese manifestations are not without example in the history of the\r\nAntislavery cause elsewhere. From the beginning, Slave-Masters have\r\nencountered argument by brutality and violence. St. Jerome had before\r\nhim their type, when he described certain persons “whose words are in\r\ntheir fists and syllogisms in their heels.”[94] If we go back to the\r\nearliest of Abolitionists, the wonderful Portuguese preacher, Vieyra,\r\nwe find that his matchless eloquence and unquestioned piety did not\r\nsave him from indignity. The good man was seized and imprisoned, while\r\none of the principal Slave-Masters asked him, in mockery, “where were\r\nall his learning and all his genius now, if they could not deliver him\r\nin this extremity?”[95] He was of the Catholic Church. But the spirit\r\nof Slavery is the same in all churches. A renowned Quaker minister\r\nof the last century, Thomas Chalkley, while on a visit at Barbadoes,\r\nhaving simply recommended charity to the slaves, without presuming to\r\nbreathe a word against Slavery itself, was first met by disturbance\r\nin the meeting, and afterward, on the highway, in open day, was shot\r\nat by one of the exasperated planters, with a fowling-piece “loaded\r\nwith small shot, ten of which made marks, and several drew blood.”[96]\r\nIn England, while the Slave-Trade was under discussion, the same\r\nspirit raged. Wilberforce, who represented the cause of Abolition\r\nin Parliament, was threatened with personal violence; Clarkson, who\r\nrepresented the same cause before the people, was assaulted by the\r\ninfuriate Slave-Traders, and narrowly escaped being hustled into the\r\ndock; and Roscoe, the accomplished historian, on return to Liverpool\r\nfrom his seat in Parliament, where he had signalized himself as an\r\nopponent of the Slave-Trade, was met at the entrance of the town by a\r\nsavage mob, composed of persons interested in the traffic, armed with\r\n_knives and bludgeons_, the distinctive arguments and companions of the\r\npartisans of Slavery.\r\n\r\nEven in the Free States, these same partisans from the beginning acted\r\nunder the inspiration of violence. The demon of Slavery entered into\r\nthem, and through its influence they have behaved like Slave-Masters.\r\nPublic meetings for the discussion of Slavery have been interrupted;\r\npublic halls, dedicated to its discussion, have been destroyed or\r\nburned to the ground. In all our populous cities the great rights of\r\nspeech and of the press have been assailed precisely as in the Slave\r\nStates. In Boston, an early and most devoted Abolitionist was dragged\r\nthrough the streets with a halter about his neck; and in Illinois,\r\nanother, while defending his press, was ferociously murdered. The\r\nformer yet lives to speak for himself, while the latter lives in\r\nhis eloquent brother, a Representative from Illinois in the other\r\nHouse.[97] Thus does Slavery show its natural character even at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nNor in the Slave States is this spirit confined to outbreaks of\r\nmere lawlessness. Too strong for restraint, it finds no limitations\r\nexcept in its own barbarous will. The Government becomes its tool,\r\nand in _official acts_ does its bidding. Here again the instances\r\nare numerous. I might dwell on the degradation of the Post-Office,\r\nwhen its official head consented that for the sake of Slavery the\r\nmails themselves should be rifled. I might dwell also on the cruel\r\npersecution of free persons of color, who, in the Slave States\r\ngenerally, and even here in the District of Columbia, are not allowed\r\nto testify where a white man is in question, and now in several States\r\nare menaced by legislative act with the alternative of expulsion from\r\ntheir homes or of reduction to Slavery. But I pass to two illustrative\r\ntransactions, which a son of Massachusetts can never forget.\r\n\r\n1. The first relates to a citizen of purest life and perfect integrity,\r\nwhose name is destined to fill a conspicuous place in the history\r\nof Freedom, William Lloyd Garrison. Born in Massachusetts, bred to\r\nthe same profession with Benjamin Franklin, and, like his great\r\npredecessor, becoming an editor, he saw with instinctive clearness the\r\nwrong of Slavery, and, at a period when the ardors of the Missouri\r\nQuestion had given way to indifference throughout the North, he stepped\r\nforward to denounce it. The jail at Baltimore, where he then resided,\r\nwas the earliest reward. Afterward, January 1st, 1831, he published the\r\nfirst number of “The Liberator,” inscribing for his motto an utterance\r\nof Christian philanthropy, “Our country is the world, our countrymen\r\nare mankind,” and declaring, in the face of surrounding apathy: “I am\r\nin earnest,--I will not equivocate,--I will not excuse,--I will not\r\nretreat a single inch,--AND I WILL BE HEARD.” In this sublime spirit\r\nhe commenced his labors for the Slave, proposing no intervention by\r\nCongress in the States, and on well-considered principle avoiding\r\nall appeals to the bond-men themselves. Such was his simple and\r\nthoroughly constitutional position, when, before the expiration of\r\nthe first year, the Legislature of Georgia, by solemn act, a copy\r\nof which I have before me, “approved” by Wilson Lumpkin, Governor,\r\nappropriated five thousand dollars “to be paid to any person or persons\r\nwho shall arrest, bring to trial, and prosecute to conviction under\r\nthe laws of this State, the editor or publisher of a certain paper\r\ncalled _The Liberator_, published in the town of Boston and State\r\nof Massachusetts.”[98] This infamous statute, touching a citizen\r\nabsolutely beyond the jurisdiction of Georgia and in no way amenable\r\nto its laws, constituted a plain bribe to the gangs of kidnappers\r\nengendered by Slavery. With this barefaced defiance of justice and\r\ndecency Slave-Masters inaugurated the system of violence by which they\r\nhave sought to crush every voice raised against Slavery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. Here is another illustration, of a different character. Free\r\npersons of color, citizens of Massachusetts, and, according to the\r\ninstitutions of this Commonwealth, entitled to equal privileges with\r\nother citizens, being in service as mariners, and touching at the\r\nport of Charleston, in South Carolina, have been seized, and, with no\r\nallegation against them, except of entering this port in the discharge\r\nof their rightful business, have been cast into prison, and there\r\ndetained during the stay of the vessel. This is by virtue of a statute\r\nof South Carolina, passed in 1822, which further declares, that, in\r\nthe failure of the captain to pay the expenses, these freemen “shall\r\nbe deemed and taken as absolute slaves,” one moiety of the proceeds of\r\ntheir sale to belong to the sheriff. Against all remonstrance,--against\r\nthe official opinion of Mr. Wirt, as Attorney-General of the United\r\nStates, declaring it unconstitutional,--against the solemn judgment\r\nof Mr. Justice Johnson, of the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nhimself a Slave-Master and citizen of South Carolina, also pronouncing\r\nit unconstitutional,[99]--this statute, which is an obvious injury\r\nto Northern ship-owners, as it is an outrage to the mariners whom it\r\nseizes, has been upheld to this day by South Carolina.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, anxious to obtain for her people that protection which\r\nwas denied, and especially to save them from the dread penalty of being\r\nsold into Slavery, appointed a citizen of South Carolina as her agent\r\nfor this purpose, and in her behalf to bring suits in the Circuit Court\r\nof the United States to try the constitutionality of this pretension.\r\nOwing to the sensitiveness of the people in that State, the agent\r\ndeclined to render this simple service. Massachusetts next selected\r\none of her own sons, a venerable citizen, who had already served with\r\nhonor in the other House of Congress, and was of admitted eminence\r\nas a lawyer, the Hon. Samuel Hoar, of Concord, to visit Charleston,\r\nand there do what the agent first appointed shrank from doing. This\r\nexcellent gentleman, beloved by all who knew him, gentle in manners\r\nas he was firm in character, with a countenance that was in itself a\r\nletter of recommendation, arrived at Charleston, accompanied only by\r\nhis daughter. Straightway all South Carolina was convulsed. According\r\nto a story in Boswell’s Johnson, all the inhabitants at St. Kilda, a\r\nremote island of the Hebrides, on the approach of a stranger, “catch\r\ncold”[100]; but in South Carolina it is fever that they catch. The\r\nGovernor at the time, who was none other than one of her present\r\nSenators [Mr. HAMMOND], made his arrival the subject of special message\r\nto the Legislature, which I have before me; the Legislature all caught\r\nthe fever, and swiftly adopted resolutions calling upon his Excellency\r\nthe Governor “to expel from our territory the said agent, after due\r\nnotice to depart,” and promising to “sustain the Executive authority\r\nin any measures it may adopt for the purpose aforesaid.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fever raged in Charleston. The agent of Massachusetts\r\nwas first accosted in the streets by a person unknown to him, who,\r\nflourishing a bludgeon in his hand,--the bludgeon always shows\r\nitself where Slavery is in question,--cried out: “You had better be\r\ntravelling, and the sooner the better for you, I can tell you; if\r\nyou stay here until to-morrow morning, you will feel something you\r\nwill not like, I’m thinking.” Next came threats of attack during the\r\nfollowing night on the hotel where he was lodged; then a request from\r\nthe landlord that he should quit, in order to preserve the hotel\r\nfrom the impending danger of an infuriate mob; then a committee of\r\nSlave-Masters, who politely proposed to conduct him to the boat. Thus\r\narrested in his simple errand of good-will, this venerable public\r\nservant, whose appearance alone, like that of the “grave and pious\r\nman” mentioned by Virgil, would have softened any mob not inspired by\r\nSlavery, yielded to the ejectment proposed, precisely as the prisoner\r\nyields to the officers of the law, and left Charleston, while a person\r\nin the crowd was heard to declare that he “had offered himself as a\r\nleader of a tar-and-feather gang, to have been called into the service\r\nof the city on the occasion.” Nor is this all. The Legislature a\r\nsecond time caught the fever, and, yielding to its influence, passed\r\na statute, forbidding, under severe penalties, any person within the\r\nState from accepting a commission to befriend these colored mariners,\r\nand, under penalties severer still, extending even to unlimited\r\nimprisonment, prohibiting any person, “on his own behalf, or under\r\ncolor or in virtue of any commission or authority from any State or\r\npublic authority of any State in this Union, or of any foreign power,”\r\nto come into South Carolina for this purpose; and then, to complete its\r\nwork, by still another statute took away the writ of _Habeas Corpus_\r\nfrom all such mariners.[101]\r\n\r\nSuch is a simple narrative, founded on authentic documents. I do not\r\nadduce it for present criticism, but simply to enroll it in all its\r\nstages--beginning with the earliest pretension of South Carolina,\r\ncontinuing in violence, and ending in yet other pretensions--among\r\nthe special instances where the Barbarism of Slavery stands confessed\r\neven in official conduct. And yet this transaction, which may well\r\ngive to South Carolina the character of a shore “where shipwrecked\r\nmariners dread to land,” was openly vindicated in all its details, from\r\nbeginning to end, by both the Senators from that State, while one of\r\nthem [Mr. HAMMOND], in the same breath, bore testimony from personal\r\nknowledge to the character of the public agent thus maltreated, saying,\r\n“He was a pleasant, kind old gentleman, well informed, and I had a sort\r\nof friendship for him during the short time that I sat near him in\r\nCongress.”[102]\r\n\r\nThus, Sir, whether we look at individuals or at the community\r\nwhere Slavery exists, at lawless outbreaks or at official conduct,\r\nSlave-Masters are always the same. Enough, you will say, has been\r\ntold. Yes, enough to expose Slavery, but not enough for Truth. The\r\nmost instructive and most grievous part still remains. It is the\r\nexhibition of Slave-Masters in Congressional history. Of course, the\r\nrepresentative reflects the character as well as the political opinions\r\nof the constituents whose will it is his boast to obey. It follows that\r\nthe passions and habits of Slave-Masters are naturally represented in\r\nCongress,--chastened to a certain extent, perhaps, by the requirements\r\nof Parliamentary Law, but breaking out in fearful examples. And here,\r\nagain, facts speak as nothing else can.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding with this duty, to which, as you will perceive, I\r\nam impelled by the positive requirements of this debate, I crave\r\nindulgence of the Senate, while, avoiding all allusions to private\r\nlife or private character, and touching simply what is of record,\r\nand already “enrolled in the Capitol,” I present a few only of many\r\ninstances, which, especially during these latter days, since Slavery\r\nbecame paramount, have taken their place in our national history.\r\nClarendon has mildly pictured successive Congresses, when, recounting\r\nwhat preceded the Civil War in England, he says: “It is not to be\r\ndenied that there were in all those Parliaments … several passages and\r\ndistempered speeches of particular persons, not fit for the dignity and\r\nhonor of those places.”[103] But Congress, under the rule of Slavery,\r\nhas been worse than any Parliament.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance. On the 13th of February, 1837, R. M. Whitney\r\nwas arraigned before the House of Representatives for contempt, in\r\nrefusing to attend, when required, before a committee investigating the\r\nadministration of the Executive office. His excuse was, that “he could\r\nnot attend without exposing himself thereby to outrage and violence”\r\nin the committee-room; and on examination at the bar of the House,\r\nMr. Fairfield, a member of the Committee, afterward a member of this\r\nbody, and Governor of Maine, testified to the actual facts. It appeared\r\nthat Mr. Peyton, a Slave-Master from Tennessee, and a member of the\r\nCommittee, regarding a certain answer in writing by Mr. Whitney to\r\nan interrogatory propounded by him as offensive, broke out in these\r\nwords: “Mr. Chairman, I wish you to inform this witness that he is not\r\nto insult me in his answers; if he does, God damn him, I will take his\r\nlife upon the spot!” Mr. Wise, another Slave-Master, from Virginia,\r\nChairman of the Committee, and latterly Governor of Virginia, then\r\nintervened, saying, “Yes, this damned insolence is insufferable.” The\r\nwitness, thereupon rising, claimed the protection of the Committee;\r\non which Mr. Peyton exclaimed: “God damn you, you shan’t speak; you\r\nshan’t say a word while you are in this room; if you do, I will put\r\nyou to death!” Soon after, Mr. Peyton, observing that the witness was\r\nlooking at him, cried out: “Damn him, his eyes are on me; God damn him,\r\nhe is looking at me; he shan’t do it; damn him, he shan’t look at me!”\r\nThese things, and much more, disclosed by Mr. Fairfield, in reply to\r\ninterrogatories in the House, were confirmed by other witnesses; and\r\nMr. Wise himself, in a speech, made the admission that he was armed\r\nwith deadly weapons, saying: “I watched the motion of that right arm\r\n[of the witness], the elbow of which could be seen by me; and had it\r\nmoved one inch, he had died on the spot. That was my determination.”\r\n\r\nAll this will be found in the thirteenth volume of the “Congressional\r\nDebates,” with the evidence in detail, and the discussion thereupon.\r\n\r\nHere is another instance, of similar character, which did not occur\r\nin a committee-room, but during debate in the Senate Chamber. While\r\nthe Compromise Measures were under discussion, on the 17th of April,\r\n1850, Mr. Foote, a Slave-Master from Mississippi, in the course of\r\nremarks, commenced personal allusion to Mr. Benton. This was aggravated\r\nby the circumstance that only a few days previously he had made this\r\ndistinguished gentleman the mark for most bitter and vindictive\r\npersonalities. Mr. Benton rose at once from his seat, and, with\r\nangry countenance, but without weapon of any kind in his hand, or,\r\nas appeared afterward before the Committee, on his person, advanced\r\nin the direction of Mr. Foote, when the latter, gliding backward,\r\ndrew from his pocket a five-chambered revolver, full-loaded, which he\r\ncocked. Meanwhile Mr. Benton, at the suggestion of friends, was already\r\nreturning to his seat, when he perceived the pistol. Excited greatly by\r\nthis deadly menace, he exclaimed: “I am not armed. I have no pistols.\r\nI disdain to carry arms. Stand out of the way, and let the assassin\r\nfire.” Mr. Foote remained standing in the position he had taken, with\r\npistol in hand, cocked. “Soon after,” says the Report of the Committee\r\nappointed to investigate this occurrence, “both Senators resumed their\r\nseats, and order was restored.”\r\n\r\nThis will be found at length in the twenty-first volume of the\r\n“Congressional Globe.”[104]\r\n\r\nI cite yet another instance from the same authentic record. Mr. Arnold,\r\nof Tennessee, had proclaimed himself as “belonging to the Peace party,”\r\nwhen Mr. Dawson, of Louisiana, coming to his seat, called him “a damned\r\ncoward,” “a damned blackguard,” and then said, that, if Mr. Arnold did\r\nnot behave better, “he would cut his throat from ear to ear.”[105]\r\n\r\nThe Duel, which at home in the Slave States is “twin” with the “street\r\nfight,” is also “twin” with these instances. It is constantly adopted\r\nor attempted by Slave-Masters in Congress. But I shall not enter upon\r\nthis catalogue. I content myself with showing the openness with which\r\nit has been menaced in debate, and without any call to order.\r\n\r\nMr. Foote, the same Slave-Master already mentioned, in debate in the\r\nSenate, the 26th of March, 1850, thus sought to provoke Mr. Benton. I\r\ntake his words from the “Congressional Globe,” Vol. XXI. p. 603.\r\n\r\n    “There are incidents in his [Mr. Benton’s] history, of somewhat\r\n    recent occurrence, which might well relieve any man of honor\r\n    from the obligation to recognize him as a fitting antagonist;\r\n    yet is it, notwithstanding, true, that, if the Senator from\r\n    Missouri will deign to acknowledge himself _responsible to\r\n    the laws of honor_, he shall have a very early opportunity\r\n    of proving his prowess in contest with one over whom I hold\r\n    perfect control; or, if he feels in the least degree aggrieved\r\n    at anything which has fallen from me, now or formerly, he\r\n    shall, on demanding it, _have full redress accorded him_,\r\n    according to the said laws of honor. I do not denounce him as\r\n    a coward; such language is unfitted for this audience; but, if\r\n    he wishes to patch up his reputation for courage, now greatly\r\n    on the wane, he will certainly _have an opportunity of doing\r\n    so, whenever he makes known his desire in the premises_. At\r\n    present he is shielded by his age, _his open disavowal of the\r\n    obligatory force of the laws of honor_, and his Senatorial\r\n    privileges.”\r\n\r\nWith such bitter taunts and reiterated provocations to the Duel was Mr.\r\nBenton pursued; but there was no call to order, nor any action of the\r\nSenate on this outrage.\r\n\r\nI give another instance. In debate in the Senate on the 27th February,\r\n1852, Mr. Clemens, a Slave-Master of Alabama, thus directly attacked\r\nMr. Rhett for undertaking to settle their differences by argument in\r\nthe Senate rather than by the Duel. “No man,” said he, “with the\r\nfeeling of a man in his bosom, would have sought redress here. He would\r\nhave looked for it _elsewhere_. He now comes here, not to ask redress\r\nin the only way he should have sought it.”[106] There was no call to\r\norder.\r\n\r\nHere is still another. In the debate on the Bill for the Improvement\r\nof Rivers and Harbors, 29th July, 1854, the Senator from Louisiana\r\n[Mr. BENJAMIN], who is still a member of this body, ardent for\r\nSlavery, while professing to avoid personal altercation in the\r\nSenate, especially “with a gentleman who professes the principles of\r\nnon-resistance, as he understood the Senator from New York does,”\r\nproceeded most earnestly to repel an imagined imputation on him by Mr.\r\nSeward, and wound up by saying, “If it came from another quarter, _it\r\nwould not be upon this floor that I should answer it_.”[107]\r\n\r\nDuring the present session, the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. JEFFERSON\r\nDAVIS], who speaks so often for Slavery, in a colloquy on this floor\r\nwith the Senator from Vermont [Mr. COLLAMER], maintained the Duel\r\nas a mode of settling personal differences, and vindicating what is\r\ncalled personal honor,--as if personal honor did not depend absolutely\r\nupon what a man does, and not on what is done to him. After certain\r\nrefinements on the imagined relations between an insult and the\r\nobligation to answer for it, the Senator declared, in reply to the\r\nSenator from Vermont, that, in case of insult, taking another out and\r\nshooting him might be “satisfaction.”[108]\r\n\r\nI do not dwell on this instance, nor on any of these instances, except\r\nto make a single comment. These declarations have all been made in\r\nopen Senate, without any check from the Chair. Of course, they are\r\nclear violations of the first principles of Parliamentary Law, and\r\ntend directly to provoke a violation of the law of the land. Here, in\r\nthe District of Columbia, all duels are prohibited by solemn Act of\r\nCongress.[109] In case of death, the surviving parties are declared\r\nguilty of felony, to be punished by hard labor in the penitentiary; and\r\neven where nothing has occurred beyond the challenge, all the parties\r\nto it, whether givers, receivers, or bearers, are declared guilty of\r\nhigh crime and misdemeanor, also to be punished by hard labor in the\r\npenitentiary. Of course, every menace of duel in Congress sets this\r\nlaw at defiance. And yet Senators, who thus openly disregard a law\r\nsanctioned by the Constitution and commended by morality, presume to\r\ncomplain on this floor because other Senators disregard the Fugitive\r\nSlave Bill, a statute which, according to the profound convictions of\r\nlarge numbers, is as unconstitutional as it is offensive to the moral\r\nsense. Let Senators, whose watchword is “the enforcement of laws,”\r\nbegin by enforcing the statute which declares the Duel to be felony. At\r\nleast, let the statute cease to be a dead letter in this Chamber, where\r\nthe watchword is so often heard. But this is too much to expect while\r\nSlavery prevails here; for the Duel is part of that System of Violence\r\nwhich has its origin in Slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is when aroused by the Slave Question in Congress that Slave-Masters\r\nhave most truly shown themselves; and here again I shall speak only\r\nof what has already passed into history. Slavery is a perpetual\r\nfever-and-ague, under which Congress has shaken with alternate heats\r\nand chills. Even in that earliest debate, in the first Congress after\r\nthe Constitution, on the memorial of Dr. Franklin, simply calling upon\r\nCongress to “step to the verge of its power to discourage every species\r\nof traffic in the persons of our fellow-men,”[110] the Slave-Masters\r\nbecame angry, indulged in sneers at “the men in the gallery” being\r\nQuakers and Abolitionists, and, according to the faithful historian,\r\nHildreth,[111] poured out “torrents of abuse,” while one of them began\r\nthe charge so often since directed against all Antislavery men, by\r\ndeclaring his astonishment that Dr. Franklin had “given countenance”\r\nto “an application which called upon Congress, in explicit terms, to\r\nbreak a solemn compact to which he had himself been a party,” when it\r\nwas obvious that Dr. Franklin had done no such thing. The great man\r\nwas soon summoned away by death, but not until he had fastened upon\r\nthis debate an undying condemnation, by portraying, with matchless\r\npen, a scene in the Divan at Algiers, where a Corsair Slave-Dealer,\r\ninsisting upon the enslavement of White Christians, is made to repeat\r\nthe Congressional speech of an American Slave-Master.[112]\r\n\r\nThese displays of Violence naturally increase with the intensity of\r\nthe discussion. Impelled to be severe, but with little appreciation of\r\ndebate in its finer forms, they cannot be severe except by violating\r\nthe rules of debate,--not knowing that there is a serener power than\r\nany found in personalities, and that all severity transcending the\r\nrules of debate becomes disgusting as the utterance of a Yahoo, and\r\nharms him only who degrades himself to be its mouthpiece. Of course,\r\non such occasions, amidst all seeming triumphs, the cause of Slavery\r\nloses, and Truth gains. If men cannot afford to be decent, they ought\r\nto suspect the justice of their cause, or at least the motives with\r\nwhich they sustain it; but our Slave-Masters, not seeing the indecency\r\nof their conduct, know not their losses. There is waste as well as\r\neconomy of character; but the latter is found only in the cultivation\r\nof those principles which make Slavery impossible.\r\n\r\nAgainst John Quincy Adams this violence was first directed in full\r\nforce. To a character spotless as snow, and to universal attainments\r\nas a scholar, this illustrious citizen added experience in all the\r\neminent posts of the Republic, which he had filled with an ability and\r\nintegrity now admitted even by enemies, and which impartial history can\r\nnever forget. Having been President of the United States, he entered\r\nthe House of Representatives at the period when the Slave Question,\r\nin its revival, first began to occupy public attention. In all the\r\ncompleteness of his nature, he became the representative of Human\r\nFreedom. The first struggle occurred on the Right of Petition, which\r\nSlave-Masters, with characteristic tyranny, sought to suppress. This\r\nwas resisted by the venerable patriot, and what he did was always\r\ndone with his whole heart. Then was poured upon him abuse “as from a\r\ncart,” according to a famous phrase of Demosthenes. Slave-Masters,\r\n“foaming out their shame,” became conspicuous, not less for the avowal\r\nof sentiments at which Civilization blushed than for an effrontery\r\nof manner where the accidental legislator was lost in the natural\r\noverseer, and the lash of the plantation resounded in the voice.\r\n\r\nIn an address to his constituents, September 17, 1842, Mr. Adams thus\r\nfrankly describes the treatment he experienced:--\r\n\r\n    “I never can take part in any debate upon an important subject,\r\n    be it only upon a mere abstraction, but a pack opens upon me of\r\n    personal invective in return. Language has no word of reproach\r\n    and railing that is not hurled at me.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the same speech he shows us Slave-Masters:--\r\n\r\n    “Where the South cannot effect her object by browbeating, she\r\n    wheedles.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, he announced, with accustomed power:--\r\n\r\n    “Insult, bullying, and threat characterize the Slaveholders in\r\n    Congress; talk, timidity, and submission, the Representatives\r\n    from the Free States.”\r\n\r\nNor were the Slave-Masters content with violence of words, or with\r\nejaculation of personalities by which debate became a perpetual syringe\r\nof liquid foulness, and every one seemed to vie with Squirt the\r\napothecary, according to the verse admired by Pope,--\r\n\r\n    “Such zeal he had for that vile utensil.”[113]\r\n\r\nTrue to the instincts of Slavery, they threatened personal indignity of\r\nevery kind, and even assassination. And here South Carolina naturally\r\ntook the lead.\r\n\r\nThe “Charleston Mercury,” which always speaks the true voice of\r\nSlavery, said in 1837:--\r\n\r\n     “Public opinion in the South would now, we are sure, justify\r\n    an immediate resort to force by the Southern delegation, _even\r\n    on the floor of Congress_, were they forthwith to seize and\r\n    drag from the Hall any man who dared to insult them, as that\r\n    eccentric old showman, John Quincy Adams, has dared to do.”\r\n\r\nAnd at a public dinner at Walterborough, in South Carolina, on the 4th\r\nof July, 1842, the following toast, afterwards preserved by Mr. Adams\r\nin one of his speeches, was drunk with unbounded applause:--\r\n\r\n    “May we never want a Democrat to trip up the heels of a\r\n    Federalist, or a hangman to prepare a halter for John Quincy\r\n    Adams! [_Nine cheers._]”\r\n\r\nA Slave-Master from South Carolina, Mr. Waddy Thompson, in debate\r\nin the House of Representatives, threatened the venerable patriot\r\nwith the “penitentiary”; and another Slave-Master, Mr. Marshall, of\r\nKentucky, insisted that he should be “_silenced_.” Ominous word!\r\nfull of incentive to the bludgeon-bearers of Slavery. But the great\r\nrepresentative of Freedom stood firm. Meanwhile Slavery assumed more\r\nand more the port of Giant Maul in “Pilgrim’s Progress,” who continued\r\nwith his club breaking skulls, until he was slain by Mr. Great-Heart,\r\nsoon to join the congenial pilgrims, Mr. Honest, Mr. Valiant-for-Truth,\r\nand Mr. Standfast.\r\n\r\nNext to John Quincy Adams, no person in Congress has been more\r\nconspicuous for long-continued and patriotic services against Slavery\r\nthan Joshua R. Giddings, of Ohio; nor have any such services received\r\nin higher degree that homage found in the personal and most vindictive\r\nassaults of Slave-Masters. For more than twenty years he sat in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, bearing his testimony austerely, and never\r\nshrinking, though exposed to the grossest brutality. In a recent\r\naddress at New York he has recounted some of these instances.\r\n\r\nOn his presentation of resolutions affirming that Slavery was a local\r\ninstitution and could not exist outside of the Slave States, and\r\napplying this principle to the case of the “Creole,” the House caught\r\nthe South Carolina fever. A proposition of censure was introduced by\r\nSlave-Masters, and under the previous question pressed to a vote,\r\nwithout giving him a moment for explanation or reply. This glaring\r\noutrage upon freedom of debate was redressed by the constituency of Mr.\r\nGiddings, who without delay returned him to his seat. From that time\r\nthe rage of the Slave-Masters against him was constant. Here is his own\r\nbrief account.\r\n\r\n    “I will not speak of the time when Dawson, of Louisiana, drew a\r\n    bowie-knife for my assassination. I was afterward speaking with\r\n    regard to a certain transaction in which negroes were concerned\r\n    in Georgia, when Mr. Black, of Georgia, raising his bludgeon,\r\n    and standing in front of my seat, said to me, ‘If you repeat\r\n    that language again, I will knock you down.’ It was a solemn\r\n    moment for me. I had never been knocked down, and, having some\r\n    curiosity upon that subject, I repeated the language. Then Mr.\r\n    Dawson, of Louisiana, the same who had drawn the bowie-knife,\r\n    placed his hand in his pocket and said, with an oath which\r\n    I will not repeat, that he would shoot me, at the same time\r\n    cocking the pistol, so that all around me could hear it click.”\r\n\r\nListening to these horrors, ancient stories of Barbarism are all\r\noutdone; and the “viper broth,” which was a favorite decoction in a\r\nbarbarous age, seems to be the daily drink of American Slave-Masters.\r\nThe blaspheming madness of the witches in “Macbeth” is renewed, and\r\nthey dance again round the caldron, dropping into it “sweltered venom\r\nsleeping got,” with every other “charm of powerful trouble.” Men are\r\ntransformed into wolves, as according to early Greek superstition,\r\nand a new lycanthropy has its day. But Mr. Giddings, strong in\r\nconsciousness of right, knew the dignity of his position. He knew that\r\nit is always honorable to serve the cause of Liberty, and that it is a\r\nprivilege to suffer for this cause. Reproach, contumely, violence even\r\nunto death, are rewards, not punishments; and clearly the indignities\r\nyou offer can excite no shame except for their authors.\r\n\r\nBesides these eminent instances, others may be mentioned, showing the\r\npersonalities to which Senators and Representatives are exposed, when\r\nundertaking to speak for Freedom. And truth compels me to add, that\r\nit would be easy to show how these are grossly aggravated towards\r\nindividuals who notoriously reject the Duel; for then they can be\r\noffered with personal impunity.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance. In 1848, Mr. Hale, the Senator from New Hampshire,\r\nwho still continues an honor to this body, introduced into the Senate\r\na bill for the protection of property in the District of Columbia,\r\nespecially against mob-violence, when, in the debate that ensued, Mr.\r\nFoote, a Slave-Master from Mississippi, thus menaced him:--\r\n\r\n    “I invite the Senator to the good State of Mississippi, and\r\n    will tell him beforehand, in all honesty, that he could not\r\n    go ten miles into the interior before he would grace one of\r\n    the tallest trees of the forest with a rope around his neck,\r\n    with the approbation of every virtuous and patriotic citizen,\r\n    and that, if necessary, _I should myself assist in the\r\n    operation_.”[114]\r\n\r\nThat this bloody threat may not seem to stand alone, I add two others.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Mr. Hammond, of South Carolina, now a Senator, is reported as\r\nsaying in the House of Representatives:--\r\n\r\n    “I warn the Abolitionists, ignorant, infatuated barbarians as\r\n    they are, that, if chance shall throw any of them into our\r\n    hands, he may expect _a felon’s death_!”[115]\r\n\r\nIn 1841, Mr. Payne, a Slave-Master from Alabama, in the course of\r\ndebate in the House of Representatives, alluding to the Abolitionists,\r\namong whom he insisted the Postmaster-General ought to be included,\r\ndeclared that\r\n\r\n    “He would put the brand of Cain upon them,--yes, the mark of\r\n    Hell; and if they came to the South, he would _hang them like\r\n    dogs_.”[116]\r\n\r\nAnd these words were applied to men who simply expressed the recorded\r\nsentiments of Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin.\r\n\r\nEven during the present session of Congress, I find in the\r\n“Congressional Globe” the following interruptions of the eloquent and\r\nfaithful Representative from Illinois, Mr. Lovejoy, when speaking on\r\nSlavery. I do not characterize them, but simply cite the language.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Barksdale, of Mississippi:--\r\n\r\n    “Order that black-hearted scoundrel and nigger-stealing thief\r\n    to take his seat.”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Boyce, of South Carolina, addressing Mr. Lovejoy:--\r\n\r\n    “Then behave yourself.”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Gartrell, of Georgia (in his seat):--\r\n\r\n    “The man is crazy.”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Barksdale, of Mississippi, again:--\r\n\r\n    “No, Sir, you stand there to-day an infamous, perjured villain.”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Ashmore, of South Carolina:--\r\n\r\n    “Yes, he is a perjured villain; and he perjures himself every\r\n    hour he occupies a seat on this floor.”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Singleton, of Mississippi:--\r\n\r\n    “And a negro-thief into the bargain.”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Barksdale, of Mississippi, again:--\r\n\r\n    “I hope my colleague will hold no parley with that perjured\r\n    negro-thief.”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Singleton, of Mississippi, again:--\r\n\r\n    “No, Sir! any gentleman shall have time, but not such a mean,\r\n    despicable wretch as that!”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Martin, of Virginia:--\r\n\r\n    “And if you come among us, we will do with you as we did with\r\n    John Brown,--hang you up as high as Haman. I say that as a\r\n    Virginian.”[117]\r\n\r\nBut enough,--enough; and I now turn from this branch of the great\r\nsubject with a single remark. While exhibiting the Character of\r\nSlave-Masters, these numerous instances--and they might be multiplied\r\nindefinitely--attest the weakness of their cause. It requires no\r\nspecial talent to estimate the insignificance of an argument that can\r\nbe supported only by violence. The scholar will not forget the ancient\r\nstory of the colloquy between Jupiter and a simple countryman. They\r\ntalked with ease and freedom until they differed, when the angry god\r\nat once menaced his honest opponent with a thunderbolt. “Ah! ah!” said\r\nthe clown, with perfect composure, “now, Jupiter, I know you are wrong.\r\nYou are always wrong, when you appeal to your thunder.” And permit\r\nme to say, that every appeal, whether to the Duel, the revolver, or\r\nthe bludgeon, every menace of personal violence and every outrage of\r\nlanguage, besides disclosing a hideous Barbarism, also discloses the\r\nfevered nervousness of a cause already humbled in debate. And then how\r\nimpotent! Truth, like the sunbeam, cannot be soiled by outward touch,\r\nwhile the best testimony to its might is found in the active passions\r\nit provokes. There are occasions when enmity is a panegyric.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(4.) Much as has been said to exhibit the Character of Slave-Masters,\r\nthe work would be incomplete, if I failed to point out that\r\n_unconsciousness_ of its fatal influence which completes the evidence\r\nof the Barbarism under which they live. Nor am I at liberty to decline\r\nthis topic; but I shall be brief.\r\n\r\nThat Senators should seriously declare Slavery “ennobling,” at least\r\nto the master, and “the black marble keystone of our national arch,”\r\nwould excite wonder, if it were not explained by examples of history.\r\nThere are men who, in the spirit of paradox, make themselves partisans\r\nof a bad cause, as Jerome Cardan wrote an Encomium on Nero. But where\r\nthere is no disposition to paradox, it is natural that a cherished\r\npractice should blind those under its influence; nor is there any\r\nend to these exaggerations. According to Thucydides, piracy in the\r\nearly ages of Greece was alike wide-spread and honorable; and so much\r\nwas this the case, that Telemachus and Mentor, on landing at Pylos,\r\nwere asked by Nestor if they were “pirates,”[118]--precisely as in\r\nSouth Carolina the stranger might be asked if he were a Slave-Master.\r\nKidnapping, too, a kindred indulgence, was openly avowed, and I doubt\r\nnot held to be “ennobling.” Next to the unconsciousness of childhood is\r\nthe unconsciousness of Barbarism. The real Barbarian is unconscious as\r\nan infant; and the Slave-Master shows much of the same character. No\r\nNew-Zealander exults in his tattoo, no savage of the Northwest Coast\r\nexults in his flat head, more than the Slave-Master of these latter\r\ndays--always, of course, with honorable exceptions--exults in his\r\nunfortunate condition. The Slave-Master hugs his disgusting practice\r\nas the Carib of the Gulf hugged Cannibalism, and as Brigham Young now\r\nhugs Polygamy. The delusion of the Goitre is repeated. This prodigious\r\nswelling of the neck, nothing less than a loathsome wallet of flesh\r\npendulous upon the breast, and sometimes so enormous, that the victim,\r\nunable to support the burden, crawls along the ground, is common\r\nto the population on the slopes of the Alps;[119] but, accustomed\r\nto this deformity, the sufferer comes to regard it with pride,--as\r\nSlave-Masters with us, unable to support their burden, and crawling\r\nalong the ground, regard Slavery,--and it is said that those who have\r\nno swelling are laughed at and called “goose-necked.”[120]\r\n\r\nWith knowledge comes distrust and the modest consciousness of\r\nimperfection; but the pride of Barbarism has no such limitation. It\r\ndilates in the thin air of ignorance, and makes boasts. Surely, if\r\nthe illustrations which I have presented to-day are not entirely\r\ninapplicable, then must we find in the boasts of Slave-Masters new\r\noccasion to regret that baleful influence under which even love of\r\ncountry is lost in love of Slavery, and the great motto of Franklin is\r\nreversed, so as to read, _Ubi Servitudo, ibi Patria_.\r\n\r\nIt is this same influence which renders Slave-Masters insensible\r\nto those characters which are among the true glories of the\r\nRepublic,--which makes them forget that Jefferson, who wrote the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and Washington, who commanded our armies,\r\nwere Abolitionists,--which renders them indifferent to the inspiring\r\nwords of the one and the commanding example of the other. Of these\r\ngreat men it is the praise, well deserving perpetual mention, and\r\ngrudged only by malign influence, that, reared amidst Slavery, they did\r\nnot hesitate to condemn it. Jefferson, in repeated utterances, alive\r\nwith the fire of genius and truth, has contributed the most important\r\ntestimony to Freedom ever pronounced in this hemisphere, in words equal\r\nto the cause; and Washington, often quoted as a Slave-Master, in the\r\nsolemn dispositions of his last will and testament, has contributed\r\nan example which is beyond even the words of Jefferson. Do not, Sir,\r\ncall him Slave-Master, who entered into the presence of his Maker only\r\nas Emancipator of his slaves. The difference between such men and the\r\nSlave-Masters whom I expose to-day is so precise that it cannot be\r\nmistaken. The first _looked down_ upon Slavery; the second _look up_\r\nto Slavery. The first, recognizing its wrong, were at once liberated\r\nfrom its insidious influence; while the latter, upholding it as right\r\nand “ennobling,” must naturally draw from it motives of conduct. The\r\nfirst, conscious of the character of Slavery, were not misled by\r\nit; the second, dwelling in unconsciousness of its true character,\r\nsurrender blindly to its barbarous tendencies, and, verifying the words\r\nof the poet,--\r\n\r\n              “So perfect is their misery,\r\n    Not once perceive their foul disfigurement,\r\n    But boast themselves more comely than before.”[121]\r\n\r\nMr. President, it is time to close this branch of the argument. The\r\nBarbarism of Slavery has been exposed, first, in the Law of Slavery,\r\nwith its five pretensions, founded on the assertion of property in man,\r\nthe denial of the conjugal relation, the infraction of the parental\r\ntie, the exclusion from knowledge, and the robbery of the fruits of\r\nanother’s labor, all these having the single object of _compelling men\r\nto work without wages_, while its Barbarism was still further attested\r\nby tracing the law in its origin to barbarous Africa; and, secondly,\r\nit has been exposed in a careful examination of economical results,\r\nillustrated by contrast between the Free States and the Slave States,\r\nsustained by official figures. From this exposure I proceeded to\r\nconsider the influence on Slave-Masters, whose true character stands\r\nconfessed,--first, in the Law of Slavery, which is their work,--next,\r\nin the relations between them and their slaves, maintained by three\r\ninhuman instruments,--then, in their intercourse with each other and\r\nwith society: and here we have seen them at home, under the immediate\r\ninfluence of Slavery, also in the communities of which they are a\r\npart, practising violence, and pushing it everywhere, in street-fight\r\nand duel; especially raging against all who question the pretensions\r\nof Slavery, entering even into the Free States,--but not in lawless\r\noutbreaks only, also in official acts, as of Georgia and of South\r\nCarolina regarding two Massachusetts citizens,--and then, ascending\r\nin audacity, entering the Halls of Congress, where they have turned,\r\nas at home, against all who oppose their assumptions; while the whole\r\ngloomy array of unquestionable facts is closed by the melancholy\r\nunconsciousness which constitutes one of the distinctive features of\r\nthis Barbarism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is my answer to the assumption of fact in behalf of Slavery\r\nby Senators on the other side. But before passing to that other\r\nassumption of Constitutional Law, which forms the second branch\r\nof this discussion, I add testimony to the influence of Slavery\r\non Slave-Masters in other countries, which is too important to be\r\nneglected, and may properly find place here.\r\n\r\nAmong those who have done most to press forward in Russia that sublime\r\nact of emancipation by which the present Emperor is winning lustre,\r\nnot only for his own country, but for our age, is M. Tourgueneff.\r\nOriginally a Slave-Master himself, with numerous slaves, and\r\nresiding where Slavery prevailed, he saw, with the instincts of a\r\nnoble character, the essential Barbarism of this relation, and in\r\nan elaborate work on Russia, which is now before me, exposed it\r\nwith rare ability and courage. Thus he speaks of its influence on\r\nSlave-Masters:--\r\n\r\n    “But if Slavery degrades the slave, it degrades the master\r\n    more. This is an old adage, and long observation has proved to\r\n    me that this adage is not a paradox. In fact, how can that man\r\n    respect his own dignity, his own rights, who has not learned\r\n    to respect either the rights or the dignity of his fellow-man?\r\n    What control can the moral and religious sentiments have over\r\n    a person who sees himself invested with a power so eminently\r\n    contrary to morality and religion? The continual exercise\r\n    of an unjust claim, even when moderated, ends in corrupting\r\n    the character of the man, and perverting his judgment.… The\r\n    possession of a slave being the result of injustice, the\r\n    relations of the master with the slave cannot be otherwise than\r\n    a succession of wrongs. Among good masters (and it is agreed\r\n    so to call those who do not abuse their power as much as they\r\n    might) these relations are invested with forms less repugnant\r\n    than among other masters; but here the difference ends. Who can\r\n    remain always pure, when, induced by disposition, excited by\r\n    temper, influenced by caprice, he may with impunity oppress,\r\n    insult, humiliate his fellow-men? And be it remarked, that\r\n    enlightenment, civilization, do not avail here. The enlightened\r\n    man, the civilized man, is nevertheless a man; that he may not\r\n    oppress, it is necessary that it should be impossible for him\r\n    to oppress. All men cannot, like Louis the Fourteenth, throw\r\n    the cane out of the window, when they feel an inclination to\r\n    strike.”[122]\r\n\r\nAnother authority, unimpeachable at all points, whose fortune it has\r\nbeen, from extensive travels, to see Slavery in the most various forms,\r\nand Slave-Masters under the most various conditions,--I refer to the\r\ngreat African traveller, Dr. Livingstone,--thus touches the character\r\nof Slave-Masters:--\r\n\r\n    “I can never cease to be most unfeignedly thankful that I was\r\n    not born in a land of slaves. No one can understand the effect\r\n    of the unutterable meanness of the slave system on the minds\r\n    of those who, _but for the strange obliquity which prevents\r\n    them from feeling the degradation of not being gentlemen enough\r\n    to pay for services rendered_, would be equal in virtue to\r\n    ourselves. Fraud becomes as natural to them as ‘paying one’s\r\n    way’ is to the rest of mankind.”[123]\r\n\r\nAnd so does the experience of Slavery in other countries confirm the\r\nsad experience among us.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ASSUMPTION OF SLAVE-MASTERS.\r\n\r\nDiscarding now all presumptuous boasts for Slavery, and bearing in mind\r\nits essential Barbarism, I come to consider that second assumption of\r\nSenators on the other side, which is, of course, inspired by the first,\r\neven if not its immediate consequence, that, under the Constitution,\r\nSlave-Masters may take their slaves into the National Territories, and\r\nthere continue to hold them, as at home in the Slave States,--and that\r\nthis would be the case in any territory newly acquired, by purchase or\r\nby war, as of Mexico on the South or Canada on the North.\r\n\r\nHere I begin with the remark, that, as the assumption of Constitutional\r\nLaw is inspired by the assumption of fact with regard to the\r\n“ennobling” character of Slavery, so it must lose much, if not all of\r\nits force, when the latter assumption is shown to be false, as has been\r\ndone to-day.\r\n\r\nWhen Slavery is seen to be the Barbarism which it is, there are few\r\nwho would not cover it from sight, rather than insist upon sending it\r\nabroad with the flag of the Republic. Only because people have been\r\ninsensible to its true character have they tolerated for a moment\r\nits exorbitant pretensions. Therefore this long exposition, where\r\nSlavery stands forth in fivefold Barbarism, with the single object of\r\ncompelling men to work without wages, naturally prepares the way to\r\nconsider the assumption of Constitutional Law.\r\n\r\nThis assumption may be described as an attempt to _Africanize_ the\r\nConstitution, by introducing into it the barbarous Law of Slavery,\r\noriginally derived, as we have seen, from barbarous Africa,--and then,\r\nthrough such _Africanization_ of the Constitution, to _Africanize_ the\r\nTerritories, and _Africanize_ the National Government. In using this\r\nlanguage to express the obvious effect of this assumption, I borrow a\r\nsuggestive term, first employed by a Portuguese writer at the beginning\r\nof this century, when protesting against the spread of Slavery in\r\nBrazil.[124] Analyze the assumption, and it is found to stand on two\r\npretensions, either of which failing, the assumption fails also.\r\nThese two are, first, the peculiar African pretension of property in\r\nman,--and, secondly, the pretension that such property is recognized in\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first of these pretensions, I might simply refer to\r\nwhat has been said at an earlier stage of this argument. But I should\r\ndo injustice to the part it plays in this controversy, if I did not\r\nagain notice it. Then I sought particularly to show its Barbarism; now\r\nI shall show something more.\r\n\r\nProperty implies an owner and a thing owned. On the one side is a human\r\nbeing, and on the other side a thing. But the very idea of a human\r\nbeing necessarily excludes the idea of property in that being, just\r\nas the very idea of a thing necessarily excludes the idea of a human\r\nbeing. It is clear that a thing cannot be a human being, and it is\r\nequally clear that a human being cannot be a thing. And the law itself,\r\nwhen it adopts the phrase, “relation of master and slave,” confesses\r\nits reluctance to sanction the claim of property. It shrinks from the\r\npretension of Senators, and satisfies itself with a formula which does\r\nnot openly degrade human nature.\r\n\r\nIf this property does exist, out of what title is it derived? Under\r\nwhat ordinance of Nature or of Nature’s God is one human being stamped\r\nan owner and another stamped a thing? God is no respecter of persons.\r\nWhere is the sanction for this respect of certain persons to a degree\r\nwhich becomes outrage to other persons? God is the Father of the Human\r\nFamily, and we all are his children. Where, then, is the sanction of\r\nthis pretension by which a brother lays violent hands upon a brother?\r\nTo ask these questions is humiliating; but it is clear there can be but\r\none response. There is no sanction for such pretension, no ordinance\r\nfor it, no title. On all grounds of reason, and waiving all questions\r\nof “positive” statute, the Vermont Judge was nobly right, when,\r\nrejecting the claim of a Slave-Master, he said, “No, not until you show\r\na Bill of Sale from the Almighty.” Nothing short of this impossible\r\nlink in the chain of title would do. I know something of the great\r\njudgments by which the jurisprudence of our country is illustrated; but\r\nI doubt if there is anything in the wisdom of Marshall, the learning of\r\nStory, or the completeness of Kent, which will brighten with time like\r\nthis honest decree.\r\n\r\nThe intrinsic feebleness of this pretension is apparent in the\r\nintrinsic feebleness of the arguments by which it is maintained. These\r\nare twofold, and both were put forth in recent debate by the Senator\r\nfrom Mississippi [Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first is the alleged inferiority of the African race,--an argument\r\ninstructive to the Slave-Master. The law of life is labor. Slavery\r\nis a perpetual effort to evade this law by compelling the labor of\r\nothers; and such an attempt at evasion is naturally supported by the\r\npretension, that, because the African is inferior, therefore he may be\r\nenslaved. But this pretension, while surrendering to Slavery a whole\r\nrace, leaves it uncertain whether the same principle may not be applied\r\nto other races, as to the polished Japanese who are now the guests of\r\nthe nation,[125] and even to persons of obvious inferiority among the\r\nwhite race. Indeed, the latter pretension is openly set up in other\r\nquarters. The “Richmond Enquirer,” a leading journal of Slave-Masters,\r\ndeclares, “The principle of Slavery is in itself right, and _does\r\nnot depend on difference of complexion_.” And a leading writer among\r\nSlave-Masters, George Fitzhugh, of Virginia, in his “Sociology for the\r\nSouth,” declares, “Slavery, _black or white_, is right and necessary.\r\nNature has made the weak in mind or body for slaves.” In the same vein,\r\na Democratic paper of South Carolina has said, “Slavery is the natural\r\nand normal condition of the laboring man, _black or white_.”\r\n\r\nThese more extravagant pretensions reveal still further the feebleness\r\nof the pretension put forth by the Senator, while instances,\r\naccumulating constantly, attest the difficulty of discriminating\r\nbetween the two races. Mr. Paxton, of Virginia, tells us that “the best\r\nblood in Virginia flows in the veins of the slaves”; and more than one\r\nfugitive has been advertised latterly as possessing “a round face,”\r\n“blue eyes,” “flaxen hair,” and as “escaping under the pretence of\r\nbeing a white man.”\r\n\r\nThis is not the time to enter upon the great question of race, in\r\nthe various lights of religion, history, and science. Sure I am that\r\nthey who understand it best will be least disposed to the pretension\r\nwhich, on an assumed ground of inferiority, would condemn one race to\r\nbe the property of another. If the African race be inferior, as is\r\nalleged, then unquestionably a Christian Civilization must lift it\r\nfrom degradation, not by the lash and the chain, not by this barbarous\r\npretension of ownership, but by a generous charity, which shall be\r\nmeasured precisely by the extent of inferiority.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second argument put forward for this pretension, and twice repeated\r\nby the Senator from Mississippi, is, that the Africans are the\r\nposterity of Ham, the son of Noah, through Canaan, who was cursed by\r\nNoah, to be the “servant”--that is the word employed--of his brethren,\r\nand that this malediction has fallen upon all his descendants, who\r\nare accordingly devoted by God to perpetual bondage, not only in the\r\nthird and fourth generations, but throughout all succeeding time.\r\nSurely, when the Senator quoted Scripture to enforce the claim of\r\nSlave-Masters, he did not intend a jest. And yet it is hard to suppose\r\nhim in earnest. The Senator is Chairman of the Committee on Military\r\nAffairs, where he is doubtless experienced. He may, perhaps, set a\r\nsquadron in the field; but, evidently, he has considered very little\r\nthe text of Scripture on which he relies. The Senator assumes that it\r\nhas fixed the doom of the colored race, leaving untouched the white\r\nrace. Perhaps he does not know, that, in the worst days of the Polish\r\naristocracy, this same argument was adopted as excuse for holding white\r\nserfs in bondage, precisely as it is now put forward by the Senator,\r\nand that even to this day the angry Polish noble addresses his white\r\npeasant as “Son of Ham.”\r\n\r\nIt hardly comports with the gravity of this debate to dwell on\r\nsuch an argument; and yet I cannot go wrong, if, for the sake of\r\na much injured race, I brush it away. To justify the Senator in\r\nhis application of this ancient curse, he must maintain at least\r\nfive different propositions, as essential links in the chain of\r\nthe Afric-American slave: _first_, that by this malediction Canaan\r\nhimself was actually changed into a “chattel,”--whereas he is simply\r\nmade the “servant” of his brethren; _secondly_, that not merely\r\nCanaan, but all his posterity, to the remotest generation, was so\r\nchanged,--whereas the language has no such extent; _thirdly_, that\r\nthe Afric-American actually belongs to the posterity of Canaan,--an\r\nethnological assumption absurdly difficult to establish; _fourthly_,\r\nthat each of the descendants of Shem and Japheth has a right to hold an\r\nAfric-American fellow-man as a “chattel,”--a proposition which finds\r\nno semblance of support; and, _fifthly_, that every Slave-Master is\r\ntruly descended from Shem or Japheth,--a pedigree which no anxiety can\r\nestablish. This plain analysis, which may fitly excite a smile, shows\r\nthe fivefold absurdity of an attempt to found this pretension on any\r\n\r\n            “successive title, long and dark,\r\n    Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah’s ark.”[126]\r\n\r\nFrom the character of these two arguments for property in man, I am\r\nbrought to its denial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is natural that Senators who pretend, that, by the Law of Nature,\r\nman may hold property in man, should find this pretension in the\r\nConstitution. But the pretension is as much without foundation in the\r\nConstitution as it is without foundation in Nature. It is not too\r\nmuch to say that there is not one sentence, phrase, or word, not a\r\nsingle suggestion, hint, or equivocation, even, out of which any such\r\npretension can be implied,--while great national acts and important\r\ncontemporaneous declarations in the Convention which framed the\r\nConstitution, in different forms of language, and also controlling\r\nrules of interpretation, render this pretension impossible. Partisans,\r\ntaking counsel of their desires, find in the Constitution, as in the\r\nScriptures, what they incline to find; and never was this more apparent\r\nthan when Slave-Masters deceive themselves so far as to find in the\r\nConstitution a pretension which exists only in their own minds.\r\n\r\nLooking for one moment juridically at this question, we are brought\r\nto the conclusion, according to the admission of courts and jurists,\r\nfirst in Europe, and then in our own country, that Slavery can be\r\nderived from no doubtful word or mere pretension, but only from clear\r\nand special recognition. “The state of Slavery,” said Lord Mansfield,\r\npronouncing judgment in the great case of Somerset, “is of such a\r\nnature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral\r\nor political, but only by _positive law_. It is so odious that nothing\r\ncan be suffered to support it but POSITIVE LAW,”--that is, express\r\nwords of a written text; and this principle, which commends itself\r\nto the enlightened reason, is adopted by several courts in the Slave\r\nStates. Of course every leaning must be against Slavery. A pretension\r\nso peculiar and offensive, so hostile to reason, so repugnant to the\r\nLaws of Nature and the inborn Rights of Man, which, in all its fivefold\r\nwrong, has no other object than to compel fellow-men to work without\r\nwages,--such a pretension, so tyrannical, so unjust, so mean, so\r\nbarbarous, can find no place in any system of Government, unless by\r\nvirtue of _positive sanction_. It can spring from no doubtful phrase.\r\nIt must be declared by unambiguous words, incapable of a double sense.\r\n\r\nAt the adoption of the Constitution, this rule, promulgated in the\r\nCourt of King’s Bench by the voice of the most finished magistrate in\r\nEnglish history, was as well known in our country as any principle\r\nof the Common Law; especially was it known to the eminent lawyers in\r\nthe Convention; nor is it too much to say that the Constitution was\r\nframed with this rule on Slavery as a guide. And the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, at a later day, by the lips of Chief-Justice\r\nMarshall, promulgated this same rule, in words stronger even than\r\nthose of Lord Mansfield, saying: “Where rights are infringed, where\r\nfundamental principles are overthrown, where the general system of the\r\nlaws is departed from, the legislative intention must be expressed with\r\n_irresistible clearness_, to induce a court of justice to suppose a\r\ndesign to effect such objects.”[127] It is well known, however, that\r\nthese two declarations are little more than new forms for the ancient\r\nrule of the Common Law, as expressed by Fortescue: _Impius et crudelis\r\njudicandus est qui Libertati non favet_: “He is to be adjudged impious\r\nand cruel who does not favor Liberty,”[128]--and as expressed by\r\nBlackstone, “The law is always ready to catch at anything in favor of\r\nLiberty.”[129]\r\n\r\nBut, as no prescription runs against the King, so no prescription\r\nis allowed to run against Slavery, while all the early victories of\r\nFreedom are set aside by the Slave-Masters of to-day. The prohibition\r\nof Slavery in the Missouri Territory, and all the precedents,\r\nlegislative and judicial, for the exercise of this power, admitted\r\nfrom the beginning until now, are overturned. At last, bolder grown,\r\nSlave-Masters do not hesitate to assail that principle of jurisprudence\r\nwhich makes Slavery the creature of “positive law” alone, to be upheld\r\nonly by words of “irresistible clearness.” The case of Somerset, in\r\nwhich this great rule was declared, is impeached on this floor, as the\r\nDeclaration of Independence is also impeached. And here the Senator\r\nfrom Louisiana [Mr. BENJAMIN] takes the lead, with the assertion,\r\nthat in the history of English law there are earlier cases, where a\r\ncontrary principle was declared. Permit me to say that no such cases,\r\neven if hunted up in authentic reports, can impair the influence of\r\nthis well-considered authority. The Senator knows well that an old and\r\nbarbarous case is a poor answer to a principle brought into activity\r\nby the demands of advancing Civilization, and which, once recognized,\r\ncan never be denied. Pardon me, if I remind him that Jurisprudence is\r\nnot a dark-lantern, shining in a narrow circle, and never changing,\r\nbut a gladsome light, which, slowly emerging from original darkness,\r\ngrows and spreads with human improvement, until at last it becomes\r\nas broad and general as the Light of Day. When the Senator, in this\r\nage, leaguing all his forces, undertakes to drag down that immortal\r\nprinciple which made Slavery impossible in England, as, thank God! it\r\nmakes Slavery impossible under the Constitution, he vainly tugs to drag\r\ndown a luminary from the sky.\r\n\r\nThe enormity of the pretension that Slavery is sanctioned by the\r\nConstitution becomes still more flagrant, when we read the Constitution\r\nin the light of great national acts and of contemporaneous authorities.\r\nFirst comes the Declaration of Independence, the illuminated initial\r\nletter of our history, which in familiar words announces “that all\r\nmen are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\ncertain unalienable rights; that among these are Life, _Liberty_, and\r\nthe Pursuit of Happiness; that to secure these rights governments are\r\ninstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of\r\nthe governed.” Nor does this Declaration, binding the consciences of\r\nall who enjoy the privileges it secured, stand alone. There is another\r\nnational act, less known, but in itself a key to the first, when, at\r\nthe successful close of the Revolution, the Continental Congress, in a\r\nsolemn Address to the States, grandly announced: “Let it be remembered\r\nthat it has ever been the pride and boast of America, _that the\r\nrights for which she contended were the Rights of Human Nature_. By\r\nthe blessing of the Author of _these rights_ on the means exerted for\r\ntheir defence, they have prevailed against all opposition, and form\r\nTHE BASIS of thirteen independent States.”[130] Now, whatever may be\r\nthe privileges of States in their individual capacities, within their\r\nseveral local jurisdictions, no power can be attributed to the nation,\r\nin the absence of positive, unequivocal grant, inconsistent with these\r\ntwo national declarations. Here is the national heart, the national\r\nsoul, the national will, the national voice, which must inspire our\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution, and enter into and diffuse itself\r\nthrough all the national legislation. Such are commanding authorities\r\nwhich make “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness,” and, in\r\nmore general words, “the Rights of Human Nature,” as the basis of\r\nour national institutions, without distinction of race, or absurd\r\nrecognition of the curse of Ham.\r\n\r\nIn strict harmony with these are the many utterances in the Convention\r\nwhich framed the Constitution: of Gouverneur Morris, of Pennsylvania,\r\nwho announced that “_he never would concur in upholding Domestic\r\nSlavery_; it was a nefarious institution”;[131] of Elbridge Gerry, of\r\nMassachusetts, who said that “we had nothing to do with the conduct\r\nof the States as to slaves, _but ought to be careful not to give any\r\nsanction to it_”;[132] of Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, of\r\nConnecticut, and Mr. Gorham, of Massachusetts, who all concurred with\r\nMr. Gerry;[133] and especially of Mr. Madison, of Virginia, who, in a\r\nphrase which cannot be quoted too often, “THOUGHT IT WRONG TO ADMIT IN\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION THE IDEA THAT THERE COULD BE PROPERTY IN MEN.”[134]\r\nAnd, lastly, as if to complete the elaborate work of Freedom, and to\r\nembody all these utterances, the word “servitude,” which had been\r\nallowed in the clause on the apportionment of Representatives, was\r\nstruck out, and the word “service” substituted. This final and total\r\nexclusion from the Constitution of the idea of property in man was on\r\nthe motion of Mr. Randolph, of Virginia; and the reason assigned for\r\nthe substitution, according to Mr. Madison, in his authentic report of\r\nthe debate, was, that “the former was thought to express the condition\r\nof slaves, and the latter _the obligations of free persons_.”[135]\r\nThus, at every point, by great national declarations, by frank\r\nutterances in the Convention, and by positive act in adjusting the text\r\nof the Constitution, was the idea of property in man unequivocally\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nThis pretension, which may be dismissed as utterly baseless,\r\nbecomes absurd, when it is considered to what result it necessarily\r\nconducts. If the Barbarism of Slavery, in all its fivefold wrong,\r\nis really embodied in the Constitution, so as to be beyond reach of\r\nprohibition, either Congressional or local, in the Territories, then,\r\nfor the same reason, it must be beyond reach of prohibition, even by\r\nlocal authority, in the States themselves, and, just so long as the\r\nConstitution continues unchanged, Territories and States alike must be\r\nexposed to all its blasting influences. Do we not witness this result\r\nin open attempts now made by Slave-Masters to travel with their slaves\r\nin the Free States? Calling the slave-roll in the shadow of Bunker\r\nHill, according to well-known menace, will be the triumph of this\r\nconsummation. And yet this pretension, which in natural consequences\r\noverturns State Rights, is announced by Senators who profess to be\r\nspecial guardians of State Rights.\r\n\r\nNor does this pretension derive any support from the much debated\r\nclause in the Constitution for the rendition of fugitives from “service\r\nor labor,” on which so much stress is constantly put. I do not occupy\r\nyour time now on this head for two reasons: first, because, having on\r\na former occasion exhibited with great fulness the character of that\r\nclause, I am unwilling now thus incidentally to open the question upon\r\nit; and, secondly, because, whatever may be its character,--admitting\r\nthat it confers power upon Congress,--and admitting, also, what is\r\noften denied, that, in defiance of commanding rules of interpretation,\r\nthe equivocal words there employed have that “irresistible clearness”\r\nwhich is necessary in taking away Human Rights,--yet nothing can be\r\nclearer than that the fugitives, whosoever they be, are regarded under\r\nthe Constitution as _persons_, and not as _property_.\r\n\r\nI disdain to dwell on that other argument, brought forward by Senators,\r\nwho, denying the Equality of Men, speciously assert the Equality of the\r\nStates, and from this principle, true in many respects, jump to the\r\nconclusion, that Slave-Masters are entitled, in the name of Equality,\r\nto take slaves into the National Territories, under solemn safeguard\r\nof the Constitution. This argument comes back to the first pretension,\r\nthat slaves are recognized as “property” in the Constitution. To that\r\npretension, already amply exposed, we are always brought, nor can any\r\nsounding allegation of State Equality avoid it. And yet this very\r\nargument betrays the inconsistency of its authors. If persons held\r\nto service in the Slave States are “property” under the Constitution,\r\nthen under the provision known as “the three-fifths rule,” which\r\nfounds representation in the other House on such persons, there is a\r\n_property representation_ from the Slave States, with voice and vote,\r\nwhile there is no such _property representation_ from the Free States.\r\nWith glaring inequality, the representation of Slave States is founded,\r\nfirst, on “persons,” and, secondly, on a large part of their pretended\r\nproperty, while the representation of the Free States is founded\r\nsimply on “persons,” leaving all their boundless millions of property\r\nunrepresented. Thus, whichever way we approach it, the absurdity of\r\nthis pretension becomes manifest. Assuming the pretension of property\r\nin man under the Constitution, you upset the whole theory of State\r\nEquality, for you disclose a gigantic inequality between the Slave\r\nStates and the Free States; and assuming the Equality of States, in the\r\nHouse of Representatives as elsewhere, you upset the whole pretension\r\nof property in man under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nNor will I deign to dwell on one other argument, which, in the name\r\nof Popular Sovereignty, undertakes to secure for the people in the\r\nTerritories the wicked power--sometimes, by confusion of terms,\r\ncalled “right”--to enslave their fellow-men: as if this pretension\r\nwas not crushed at once by the Declaration of Independence, when it\r\nannounced that all governments “derive their just powers from the\r\nconsent of the governed”; and as if anywhere within the jurisdiction\r\nof the Constitution, which contains no sentence, phrase, or word\r\nsanctioning this outrage, and which carefully excludes the idea of\r\nproperty in man, while it surrounds all persons with the highest\r\nsafeguards of a citizen, such pretension could exist. Whatever it may\r\nbe elsewhere, Popular Sovereignty within the sphere of the Constitution\r\nhas its limitations. Claiming for all the largest liberty of a true\r\nCivilization, it compresses all within the constraints of Justice; nor\r\ndoes it allow any man to assert a right to do what he pleases, except\r\nwhen he pleases to do right. As well within the Territories attempt to\r\nmake a king as attempt to make a slave. Beyond all doubt, no majority\r\ncan be permitted to pass on the question, whether fellow-men shall be\r\nbought and sold like cattle. There are rights which cannot be “voted\r\nup” or “voted down,” according to phrases of the Senator from Illinois\r\n[Mr. DOUGLAS], for they are above all votes. The very act of voting\r\nupon the question of reducing men to bondage is a heinous wrong, for it\r\nassumes that we may do unto others what we would not have them do unto\r\nus. But this pretension,--rejected alike by every Slave-Master and by\r\nevery lover of Freedom,--\r\n\r\n    “Where I behold a factious band agree\r\n    To call it Freedom, when themselves are free,”[136]--\r\n\r\nproceeding originally from vain effort to avoid the impending question\r\nbetween Freedom and Slavery,--assuming a delusive phrase of Freedom\r\nas a cloak for Slavery,--speaking with the voice of Jacob, while its\r\nhands are the hands of Esau,--and, by plausible nickname, enabling\r\npoliticians sometimes to deceive the public, and sometimes even to\r\ndeceive themselves,--may be dismissed with other kindred pretensions\r\nfor Slavery; while the Senator from Illinois [Mr. DOUGLAS], who, if not\r\ninventor, has been its boldest defender, will learn that Slave-Masters,\r\nfor whom he has done so much, cannot afford to be generous,--that\r\ntheir gratitude is founded on what they expect, and not on what they\r\nreceive,--and that, having its root in desire rather than in fruition,\r\nit necessarily withers and dies with the power to serve them. The\r\nSenator, revolving these things, may confess the difficulty of his\r\nposition, and perhaps\r\n\r\n                      “remember Milo’s end,\r\n    Wedged in that timber which he strove to rend.”[137]\r\n\r\nThe pretension that in the Territories Slavery may be “voted up”\r\nor “voted down,” as the few people there see fit, is a novelty,\r\nand its partisans, besides a general oblivion of great principles,\r\nmost strangely forget the power of Congress “to regulate commerce\r\nwith foreign nations and among the several States,” limited only by\r\ntemporary exception in favor of “the migration or importation of such\r\npersons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit”\r\nuntil 1808. These express words, solemnly accepted as part of the\r\nConstitution, attest the power of Congress to prevent “the migration”\r\nof slaves into the Territories. The migration or importation of slaves\r\ninto any State existing at the adoption of the Constitution was\r\ntolerated until 1808; but from that date the power of Congress became\r\nplenary to prohibit their “importation” from abroad or “migration”\r\namong existing States, while from the beginning this power was plenary\r\nto prevent their “migration” into the Territories. And as early as 1804\r\nCongress exercised this power, by providing that no slave should be\r\nintroduced into the Territory of Orleans, except by a citizen of the\r\nUnited States removing thither for actual settlement, and at the time\r\n_bonâ fide_ owner of such slave; and every slave imported or brought\r\ninto the Territory, contrary to this provision, is declared free.[138]\r\nIn this unquestioned exercise of a beneficent power, at a time when\r\nthe authors of the Constitution were still on the stage, and the\r\ntemporary exception in favor of existing States was in force, we have a\r\nprecedent of unanswerable authority, establishing the power of Congress\r\nto exclude Slavery from the Territories, even if it be assumed, that,\r\nunder the Constitution, this five-headed Barbarism can find place\r\nanywhere within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere I close this branch of the argument, which I have treated less\r\nfully than the first, partly because time and strength fail me, but\r\nchiefly because the Barbarism of Slavery, when fully established,\r\nsupersedes all other inquiry. Enough is done on this head. At the\r\nrisk of repetition, I gather it together. The assumption, that\r\nSlave-Masters, under the Constitution, may take their slaves into\r\nTerritories and continue to hold them as in States, stands on two\r\npretensions,--first, that man may hold property in man, and, secondly,\r\nthat this property is recognized in the Constitution. But we have\r\nseen that the pretended property in man stands on no reason, while\r\nthe two special arguments by which it is asserted--first, an alleged\r\ninferiority of race, and, secondly, the ancient curse of Ham--are\r\ngrossly insufficient to uphold such pretension. And we have next seen\r\nthat this pretension has as little support in the Constitution as in\r\nreason; that Slavery is of such an offensive character, that it can\r\nfind support only in “positive” sanction, and words of “irresistible\r\nclearness”; that this benign rule, questioned in the Senate, is\r\nconsistent with the principles of an advanced Civilization; that no\r\nsuch “positive” sanction, in words of “irresistible clearness,” can\r\nbe found in the Constitution, while, in harmony with the Declaration\r\nof Independence, and the Address of the Continental Congress, the\r\ncontemporaneous declarations in the Convention, and especially the\r\nact of the Convention substituting “service” for “servitude,” on the\r\nground that the latter expressed “the condition of slaves,” all attest\r\nthat the pretension that man can hold property in man was carefully,\r\nscrupulously, and completely excluded from the Constitution, so that\r\nit has no semblance of support in that sacred text; nor is this\r\npretension, which is unsupported in the Constitution, helped by the two\r\narguments, one in the name of State Equality, and the other in the name\r\nof Popular Sovereignty, both of which are properly put aside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir, the true principle, which, reversing all assumptions of\r\nSlave-Masters, makes Freedom _national_ and Slavery _sectional_,\r\nwhile every just claim of the Slave States is harmonized with the\r\nirresistible predominance of Freedom under the Constitution, was\r\ndeclared at Chicago.[139] Not questioning the right of each State,\r\nwhether South Carolina or Turkey, Virginia or Russia, to order and\r\ncontrol its domestic institutions according to its own judgment\r\nexclusively, the Convention there assembled has explicitly announced\r\nFreedom to be “the normal condition of all the territory of the\r\nUnited States,” and has explicitly denied “the authority of Congress,\r\nof a Territorial Legislature, or of any individuals, to give legal\r\nexistence to Slavery in any Territory of the United States.” Such\r\nis the triumphant response by the aroused millions of the North to\r\nthe assumption of Slave-Masters, that the Constitution, of its own\r\nforce, carries Slavery into the Territories, and also to the device\r\nof politicians, that the people of the Territories, in the exercise\r\nof a dishonest Popular Sovereignty, may plant Slavery there. This\r\nresponse is complete at all points, whether the Constitution acts upon\r\nthe Territories before their organization, or only afterward; for, in\r\nthe absence of a Territorial Government, there can be no “positive”\r\nlaw in words of “irresistible clearness” for Slavery, as there can be\r\nno such law, when a Territorial Government is organized, under the\r\nConstitution. Thus the normal condition of the Territories is confirmed\r\nby the Constitution, which, when extended over them, renders Slavery\r\nimpossible, while it writes upon the soil and engraves upon the rock\r\neverywhere the law of impartial Freedom, without distinction of color\r\nor race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, this argument is now closed. Pardon me for the time\r\nI have occupied. It is long since I made any such claim upon your\r\nattention. Pardon me, also, if I have said anything I ought not to\r\nhave said. I have spoken frankly and from the heart,--if severely,\r\nyet only with the severity of a sorrowful candor, calling things by\r\ntheir right names, and letting historic facts tell their unimpeachable\r\nstory. I have spoken in patriotic hope of contributing to the welfare\r\nof my country, and also in assured conviction that this utterance\r\nto-day will find response in generous souls. I believe that I have said\r\nnothing which is not sustained by well-founded argument or well-founded\r\ntestimony, nothing which can be controverted without direct assault\r\nupon reason or upon truth.\r\n\r\nThe two assumptions of Slave-Masters are answered. But this is not\r\nenough. Let the answer become a legislative act, by the admission of\r\nKansas as a Free State. Then will the Barbarism of Slavery be repelled,\r\nand the pretension of property in man be rebuked. Such an act, closing\r\nthis long struggle by assurance of peace to the Territory, if not of\r\ntranquillity to the whole country, will be more grateful still as\r\nherald of that better day, near at hand, when Freedom will find a home\r\neverywhere under the National Government, when the National Flag,\r\nwherever it floats, on sea or land, within the national jurisdiction,\r\nwill cover none but freemen, and the Declaration of Independence, now\r\nreviled in the name of Slavery, will be reverenced as the American\r\nMagna Charta of Human Rights. Nor is this all. Such an act will be\r\nthe first stage in those triumphs by which the Republic, lifted in\r\ncharacter so as to become an example to mankind, will enter at last\r\nupon its noble “prerogative of teaching the nations how to live.”\r\n\r\nThus, Sir, speaking for Freedom in Kansas, I have spoken for Freedom\r\neverywhere, and for Civilization; and as the less is contained in the\r\ngreater, so are all arts, all sciences, all economies, all refinements,\r\nall charities, all delights of life, embodied in this cause. You may\r\nreject it, but it will be only for to-day. The sacred animosity of\r\nFreedom and Slavery can end only with the triumph of Freedom. The same\r\nquestion will be carried soon before that high tribunal, supreme over\r\nSenate and Court, where the judges are counted by millions, and the\r\njudgment rendered will be the solemn charge of an awakened people,\r\ninstructing a new President, in the name of Freedom, to see that\r\nCivilization receives no detriment.\r\n\r\n    When Mr. Sumner resumed his seat, Mr. Chesnut, of South\r\n    Carolina, spoke as follows.\r\n\r\n        “Mr. President, after the extraordinary, though\r\n        characteristic, speech just uttered in the Senate, it is\r\n        proper that I assign the reason for the position we are now\r\n        inclined to assume. After ranging over Europe, crawling\r\n        through the back doors to whine at the feet of British\r\n        aristocracy, craving pity, and reaping a rich harvest of\r\n        contempt, the slanderer of States and men reappears in the\r\n        Senate. We had hoped to be relieved from the outpourings\r\n        of such vulgar malice. We had hoped that one who had felt,\r\n        though ignominiously he failed to meet, the consequences of\r\n        a former insolence would have become wiser, if not better,\r\n        by experience. In this I am disappointed, and I regret\r\n        it. Mr. President, in the heroic ages of the world men\r\n        were deified for the possession and the exercise of some\r\n        virtues,--wisdom, truth, justice, magnanimity, courage. In\r\n        Egypt, also, we know they deified beasts and reptiles; but\r\n        even that bestial people worshipped their idols on account\r\n        of some supposed virtue. It has been left for this day, for\r\n        this country, for the Abolitionists of Massachusetts, _to\r\n        deify the incarnation of malice, mendacity, and cowardice_.\r\n        Sir, we do not intend to be guilty of aiding in the\r\n        apotheosis of pusillanimity and meanness. We do not intend\r\n        to contribute, by any conduct on our part, to increase the\r\n        devotees at the shrine of this new idol. We know what is\r\n        expected and what is desired. _We are not inclined again to\r\n        send forth the recipient of_ PUNISHMENT _howling through\r\n        the world, yelping fresh cries of slander and malice. These\r\n        are the reasons_, which I feel it due to myself and others\r\n        to give to the Senate and the country, why we have quietly\r\n        listened to what has been said, and why we can take no\r\n        other notice of the matter.”\r\n\r\n    In these words Mr. Chesnut refers to the assault upon Mr.\r\n    Sumner, with a bludgeon, on the floor of the Senate, by a\r\n    Representative from South Carolina, since dead, aided by\r\n    another Representative from that same State, and also a\r\n    Representative from Virginia, on account of which Mr. Sumner\r\n    had been compelled to leave his seat vacant, and seek the\r\n    restoration of his health by travel. As Mr. Chesnut spoke,\r\n    he was surrounded by the Slave-Masters of the Senate, who\r\n    seemed to approve what he said. There was no call to order by\r\n    the Chair, which was occupied at the time by Mr. Bigler, of\r\n    Pennsylvania. Mr. Sumner obtained the floor with difficulty,\r\n    while a motion was pending for the postponement of the\r\n    question, and said:--\r\n\r\nMr. President, before this question passes away, I think I ought to\r\nmake answer to the Senator from South Carolina,--though perhaps there\r\nis no occasion for it. [_“No!” from several Senators._] Only one word.\r\nI exposed to-day the _Barbarism of Slavery_. What the Senator has said\r\nin reply I may well print as an additional illustration. That is all.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hammond, of South Carolina, said:--\r\n\r\n    “I hope he will do it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first pamphlet edition of this speech contained a note which is\r\npreserved here.\r\n\r\n    “The following letter, from a venerable citizen, an ornament\r\n    of our legislative halls at the beginning of the century, and\r\n    now the oldest survivor of all who have ever been members\r\n    of Congress, is too valuable in testimony and counsel to be\r\n    omitted in this place.\r\n\r\n                                            “‘BOSTON, June 5, 1860.\r\n\r\n        “‘Dear Sir,--I have read a few abstracts from your noble\r\n        speech, but must wait for it in a pamphlet form, that I may\r\n        read it in such type as eyes in the eighty-ninth year of\r\n        their age will permit. But I have read enough to approve,\r\n        and rejoice that you have been permitted thus truly, fully,\r\n        and faithfully to expose the ‘Barbarism’ of Slavery on\r\n        that very floor on which you were so cruelly and brutally\r\n        stricken down by the spirit of that Barbarism.\r\n\r\n        “‘I only hope that in an Appendix you will preserve the\r\n        _vera effigies_ of that insect that attempted to sting you.\r\n        Remember that the value of amber is increased by the insect\r\n        it preserves.\r\n\r\n            “‘Yours, very truly,\r\n\r\n                “‘JOSIAH QUINCY.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nThe speech on the Barbarism of Slavery was followed by outbursts of\r\nopinion which exhibit the state of the public mind at the time. There\r\nwas approval and opposition, and there was also menace of violence. As\r\nthis was promptly encountered, it could never be known to what extent\r\nthe plot had proceeded.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner was at his lodgings, alone, on the fourth day after the\r\nspeech, when, about six o’clock, P. M., he received a visit from a\r\nstranger, who opened conversation by saying that he was one of the\r\nclass recently slandered, being a Southern man and a slaveholder, and\r\nthat he had called for an explanation of the speech, and to hold its\r\nauthor responsible. A few words ensued, in which the visitor became\r\nstill more offensive, when Mr. Sumner ordered him out of the room.\r\nAfter some delay, he left, saying, in violent tone, that he was one\r\nof four who had come from Virginia for the express purpose of holding\r\nMr. Sumner responsible, and that he would call upon him again with his\r\nfriends. Mr. Sumner sent at once to his colleague, Mr. Wilson, who\r\nquickly joined him. While they were together, a person came to the door\r\nwho asked particularly to see Mr. Sumner alone, and when told that he\r\nwas not alone, declined to enter. About nine o’clock in the evening\r\nthree other persons came to the door, who asked to see Mr. Sumner\r\nalone, and receiving the same answer, they sent word by the domestic\r\nwho opened the door, that Mr. ---- and two friends had called, but,\r\nnot finding him alone, they would call again in the morning, for a\r\nprivate interview, and if they could not have it, they would cut his\r\nd----d throat before the next night. Such a message, with the attendant\r\ncircumstances, put the friends of Mr. Sumner on their guard, and it\r\nwas determined, contrary to his desire, that one or more should sleep\r\nin the house that night. Accordingly Hon. Anson Burlingame and Hon.\r\nJohn Sherman, both Representatives, slept in the room opening into his\r\nbedroom. In the morning other circumstances increased the suspicion\r\nthat personal injury was intended.\r\n\r\nIt was the desire of Mr. Sumner that this incident should be kept out\r\nof the newspapers; but it became known, and caused no small excitement\r\nat Washington, and through the country. It was the subject of\r\ntelegrams and of letters. The anxiety in Boston was shown in a letter,\r\nunder date of June 9, from his friend Hon. Edward L. Pierce, saying:--\r\n\r\n    “We have just heard of the threat of violence made to you last\r\n    evening. Dr. Howe and others meditate leaving for Washington\r\n    forthwith. I wish I could be there; but I feel assured that\r\n    there are enough to protect you, if you will only let them. Do\r\n    be careful, very careful. You will not be safe, until you have\r\n    arrived in the Free States on your way home.”\r\n\r\nMessrs. Thayer and Eldridge, booksellers, wrote at once from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “If you need assistance in defending yourself against the\r\n    ruffians of the Slave Power, please telegraph us _at once_, or\r\n    to some of your friends here who will notify us. There is a\r\n    strong feeling here, and we can raise a small body of men, who\r\n    will join with your Washington friends, or will alone defend\r\n    you.”\r\n\r\nHon. Gershom B. Weston, a veteran, wrote from Duxbury, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I am ready to shoulder my musket and march to the Capitol,\r\n    and there sacrifice my life in defence of Free Speech and the\r\n    Right.”\r\n\r\nHon. M. F. Conway, then in Washington, and afterwards Representative in\r\nCongress from Kansas, sent in to Mr. Sumner, while in his seat, this\r\nwarning and tender of service:--\r\n\r\n    “You are not safe to be alone at any time. I will be glad to\r\n    be with you all the time, if practicable. I ask the privilege\r\n    especially of being one of your companions at night. I will\r\n    accompany you from the Senate Chamber, when you leave this\r\n    evening.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to an inquiry from home, Hon. James Buffinton, of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “The Massachusetts delegation in Congress will stand by Mr.\r\n    Sumner and his late speech. There will be no backing down by\r\n    us, and I am in hopes our people at home will pursue the same\r\n    course.”\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of Washington invited Mr. Sumner to make affidavit of the\r\nfacts, or to lodge a complaint, which the latter declined to do,\r\nsaying that he and his friends had no inducement from the past to rely\r\nupon Washington magistrates. At last the Mayor brought the original\r\noffender, being a well-known Washington office-holder of Virginia, to\r\nMr. Sumner’s room, when he apologized for his conduct, and denied all\r\nknowledge of the visitors later in the evening who left the brutal\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Mr. Sumner did not feel entirely relieved. Among these\r\nwas his private secretary, A. B. Johnson, Esq., afterwards chief clerk\r\nof the Lighthouse Board, who, untiring in friendship and fidelity,\r\nwithout consulting him, arranged protection for the night, and a\r\nbody-guard between his lodgings and the Senate. The latter service was\r\ngenerously assumed by citizens of Kansas, who, under the captaincy of\r\nAugustus Wattles, insisted upon testifying in this way their sense of\r\nhis efforts for them. Apprised of Mr. Sumner’s habit of walking to\r\nand from the Capitol, they watched his door, and, as he came out, put\r\nthemselves at covering distance behind, with revolvers in hand, and\r\nthen, unknown to him, followed to the door of the Senate. In the same\r\nway they followed him home. This body-guard, especially in connection\r\nwith the previous menace, illustrates the era of Slavery.\r\n\r\nThe personal incident just described was lost in the larger discussion\r\ncaused by the speech itself, in the press and in correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Senate at the delivery of the speech was\r\ndescribed by the correspondent of the _New York Herald_ in his letter\r\nof the same date.\r\n\r\n    “During the delivery of this exasperating bill of charges,\r\n    specifications, and denunciation of that ‘sum of all\r\n    villanies,’ Slavery, a profound and most ominous silence\r\n    prevailed on the floor of the Senate and in the galleries.\r\n    We have no recollection in our experience here, running\r\n    through a period of twenty years, of anything like this\r\n    ominous silence during the delivery of a speech for Buncombe,\r\n    on Slavery, by a Northern fanatic or a Southern fire-eater.\r\n    We say ominous silence, because we can only recognize it as\r\n    something fearfully ominous,--ominous of mischief,--ominous of\r\n    the revival in this capital and throughout the country of the\r\n    Slavery agitation, with a tenfold bitterness compared with any\r\n    previous stirring up of the fountains of bitter waters.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the _New York Tribune_ of the same date wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sumner’s speech attracted a large audience to the Senate\r\n    galleries, which continued well filled during the four hours\r\n    of his scourging review of Slavery in all its relations,\r\n    political, social, moral, and economical. There appeared to be\r\n    a studied effort at indifference on the Democratic side; for\r\n    only a dozen Senators were in their seats during the first hour\r\n    or two. Afterward they gradually appeared, and leading Southern\r\n    members from the House contributed to the general interest by\r\n    their presence and attention.\r\n\r\n    “As a whole, this speech was regarded as being more offensive\r\n    by the South than the one which created such a sensation\r\n    before, and there is reason to believe, that, but for\r\n    prudential considerations, it might have been attended with\r\n    similar results. It was found quite difficult to restrain some\r\n    decided exhibition of resentment in certain quarters. The\r\n    only expression of indignation which found vent was in Mr.\r\n    Chesnut’s brief and angry reply, from which the general temper\r\n    of the South may be inferred, as he is regarded among the most\r\n    discreet and considerate in his tone and bearing.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the _Chicago Press and Tribune_, under date of\r\nJune 5, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “The speech of Charles Sumner yesterday was probably the most\r\n    masterly and exhaustive argument against human bondage that has\r\n    ever been made in this or any other country, since man first\r\n    commenced to oppress his fellow-man. He took the floor at ten\r\n    minutes past twelve, and spoke until a little after four. The\r\n    tone of the speech was not vindictive, and yet there was a\r\n    terrible severity running through it that literally awed the\r\n    Southern side. There will, of course, be various opinions as to\r\n    the _policy_ of this awful arraignment of the Slave Power, yet\r\n    there can be but one opinion as to its extraordinary logical\r\n    completeness, and, however it may affect public opinion to-day,\r\n    it is an effort that will live in history long after the\r\n    ephemeral contest of this age shall have passed away. Indeed,\r\n    while listening to it, I could not but feel--and the same\r\n    feeling was, I know, experienced by others--that the eloquent\r\n    and brave orator was speaking rather to future generations, and\r\n    to the impartial audience of the whole civilized world, than\r\n    to the men of to-day, with a view of effecting any result upon\r\n    elements with which he was immediately surrounded.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the _New York Evening Post_ wrote, under date of\r\nJune 5:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sumner’s speech was a tremendous attack upon Slavery,\r\n    and was utterly devoid of personalities. He attacked _the\r\n    institution_, and not individuals, but his language was very\r\n    severe. There was no let-up in the severity from beginning\r\n    to end. Facts were quoted, and _they_ were allowed to bear\r\n    against States as well as individuals; but Mr. Sumner made no\r\n    comment upon that class of facts. While he was exhibiting the\r\n    barbarous character of Slave-Masters, there was a good deal of\r\n    restlessness on the slaveholding side of the Senate Hall, as if\r\n    it required great self-control to keep silence.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the _Boston Traveller_ wrote at length on the\r\ndelivery, and the impression produced. Here is an extract:--\r\n\r\n    “So far as personal violence was to be apprehended, we think he\r\n    was as unconcerned as a man could be. Anxiety on that account\r\n    might have been felt by his friends, but not by him. He seemed\r\n    to be all forgetful of himself, and to have his mind dwelling\r\n    on the cause to which he was devoted, the race for which he was\r\n    to plead, and on the responsibility under which he stood to his\r\n    country and to generations to come.…\r\n\r\n    “There was something sublime in the ardor and boldness and\r\n    majesty with which he spoke. At times we could not but forget\r\n    the speech, and think only of the speaker,--the honorable\r\n    emulation of his youth, the illustrious services of his\r\n    manhood, the purity of his aims, the sufferings he had endured,\r\n    and the merciful Providence which had preserved him. Nothing\r\n    could surpass the effect of the concluding paragraphs, in which\r\n    he predicted a Republican triumph in November next.\r\n\r\n    “The four hours during which we listened to him can never pass\r\n    from our memory. It would be superfluous here even to enumerate\r\n    the points of the speech, or to suggest its most powerful\r\n    passages, for it will be universally read. An arraignment\r\n    of Slavery so exhaustive has never before been made in our\r\n    history, and it will supersede the necessity of another.\r\n    Hereafter, when one desires to prove Slavery irrational and\r\n    unconstitutional, he will go to that speech as to an arsenal.\r\n    During a part of its delivery, the Southern Senators, as Toombs\r\n    and Wigfall, were very uneasy, walking about the Senate, and\r\n    conversing aloud. Keitt and other members of the House from\r\n    South Carolina were also in the Senate Chamber, and were rather\r\n    unquiet. Near Mr. Sumner, throughout his speech, sat his\r\n    colleague, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Burlingame, and Owen Lovejoy; and\r\n    had any Southern member attempted a repetition of the Brooks\r\n    assault, he would have found in either of them a foeman worthy\r\n    of his steel.\r\n\r\n    “The Republican Senators gave excellent attention to the\r\n    speech. Some of them, who are understood to hold very moderate\r\n    and conservative opinions, expressed a strong admiration of the\r\n    speech. One of them called it ‘a mighty effort’; another said\r\n    it was ‘the greatest speech of the age’; another said ‘it was\r\n    an unanswerable refutation of the doctrines which Senators from\r\n    Slave States had repeatedly advanced and debated in favor of\r\n    the justice and policy of Slavery, and It was a good work.’ …\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sumner was called upon last evening by some of the leading\r\n    citizens of Kansas, some of whom are to hold official positions\r\n    upon its admission, who thanked him for his speech, and assured\r\n    him that their cause would rather be advanced than injured by\r\n    it. Their course puts to shame the timidity of some persons\r\n    who were opposed to its delivery, fearing lest it would defeat\r\n    the admission of Kansas,--just as if the Proslavery Democracy,\r\n    in their treatment of that question, are to be governed by any\r\n    consideration except their own party interests and the demands\r\n    of Slavery. It is time that the Republican party pursued its\r\n    own course, without asking the counsel or permission of its\r\n    adversaries.”\r\n\r\nAn occasional correspondent of the _Chatauque Democrat_, New York, gave\r\na familiar sketch of the scene.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Breckinridge remained all the time, and sat with an open\r\n    book in his hands, pretending to read; but his eyes wandered\r\n    from the page, and, with a frown upon his brow, he finally\r\n    gazed at the speaker till he closed. Jeff Davis pretended to\r\n    be reading the _Globe_, but it was plain to be seen by the\r\n    heading of the paper that it was upside down. Wigfall seemed\r\n    in torment. He listened respectfully awhile, and then glided\r\n    silently around from one Senator to another, and conferred in\r\n    whispers. He seemed to be hatching mischief; but the grave\r\n    shake of the head of the older Senators doubtless kept this\r\n    uneasy, restless desperado quiet. Hunter sat like a rock,\r\n    immovable, and listened respectfully to the whole. Not a muscle\r\n    moved upon his placid face to denote what was going on in his\r\n    mind. Toombs heard the most of it quietly, and with as much\r\n    of a don’t-care look as his evil passions would permit. Near\r\n    the close, ‘Sheep’s-Gray’ Mason came in and took his seat, and\r\n    commenced writing a letter. He evidently intended to show the\r\n    galleries that Sumner was too small for him to notice. But he\r\n    soon found a seat in a distant part of the Hall, and an easy\r\n    position, where he sat gloomily scowling upon the orator till\r\n    he sat down. When the speech was about half through, Keitt,\r\n    the accomplice of Brooks in his attempted assassination of\r\n    Mr. Sumner, came in and took a seat near Senator Hammond.\r\n    For a while he sat gazing about the galleries, evidently to\r\n    notice the dramatic effect of his presence upon the audience\r\n    there. But few seemed to notice him. By degrees he began to\r\n    pay attention to the speech.… Curry, of Alabama, and Lamar, of\r\n    Mississippi, members of the other House, though Southerners\r\n    of the straitest sect, could not conceal their delight at the\r\n    oratory and classic and scholarly feast before them. They\r\n    are scholars and orators themselves, and could appreciate\r\n    an intellectual treat, though the sentiments were ever so\r\n    obnoxious.\r\n\r\n    “On the Republican side breathless attention prevailed. Those\r\n    who immediately surrounded the Senator were Mr. Wilson, Senator\r\n    Bingham, John Hickman, Preston King, and Solomon Foot. Mr.\r\n    Seward sat in his usual seat, and scarcely moved during the\r\n    delivery of the great speech.”\r\n\r\nAs the speech was read, the conflict of opinion began to show itself.\r\nDemocrats were all against it; Republicans were divided.\r\n\r\nThe _New York Tribune_, in an editorial notice, said:--\r\n\r\n    “We have said that Mr. Sumner’s was doubtless a strong and\r\n    forcible speech; and yet we wish he had made it on some other\r\n    bill than that providing for the admission of Kansas.”\r\n\r\nA Boston paper, in a letter from Washington, contained the following\r\nreply to the _New York Tribune_.\r\n\r\n    “And speaking of Kansas, I may here say that a number of\r\n    leading Kansas men have called on Mr. Sumner to assure him that\r\n    the _Tribune’s_ idea, that his speech injured the prospect of\r\n    the admission of their State, never found lodgement in their\r\n    minds. They thank him for it, and assure him, that, of their\r\n    own knowledge, the fate of the bill was decided before he took\r\n    the floor.”\r\n\r\nThe _New York Evening Post_, after observing that the speech was\r\n“elaborate, learned, eloquent, and exhaustive of every topic on which\r\nit touched,” said:--\r\n\r\n    “Though nominally relating to the bill for the admission of\r\n    Kansas, his remarks took a wider range, and were a general\r\n    arraignment of the system of Slavery, as it exists in the\r\n    Southern States of this Union, in all its moral, political, and\r\n    social aspects.…\r\n\r\n    “No one, we presume, can fail to admire the ability and cogency\r\n    of this address; but whether the peculiar line of argument was\r\n    called for at this time, or whether it will aid in the passage\r\n    of the Kansas Admission Bill, may admit of doubt.”\r\n\r\nThe _New York Times_ was as little sympathetic as the _Tribune_.\r\n\r\n    “From beginning to end it was a vehement denunciation of\r\n    Slavery. The labor of four leisure years seems to have been\r\n    devoted by Mr. Sumner to collecting every instance of cruelty,\r\n    violence, passion, coarseness, and vulgarity recorded as having\r\n    happened within the Slave States, or as having been committed\r\n    by a slaveholder.… But, aside from its utter irrelevancy to the\r\n    Kansas Question, what general good can be hoped for from such\r\n    envenomed attacks upon the Slave States? Do they tend in any\r\n    way to promote the public welfare? Do they aid in the least the\r\n    solution of what every sensible man acknowledges to be the most\r\n    delicate and difficult problem of this age?”\r\n\r\nThen, in another number, the _Times_ said:--\r\n\r\n    “Fortunately, it has commanded less attention than was\r\n    anticipated, and has encountered silence in some quarters,\r\n    and positive disapproval in others, usually disposed to judge\r\n    speeches of this class with the utmost forbearance. Even the\r\n    _Tribune_, while it has published the speech in its editions\r\n    intended mainly for the country, has not deemed it judicious\r\n    or wise to give it circulation among its city readers; and\r\n    some of the most decided Republican papers in the country\r\n    have protested against the injustice of holding the party\r\n    responsible for its sentiments.”\r\n\r\nThe _New York Herald_ took advantage of the speech to hold up the\r\nconsequences of “Black Republicanism.” On the day after the delivery,\r\nit wrote thus:--\r\n\r\n    “_Important from Washington.--The Great Republican\r\n    Manifesto.--Opening of the Campaign in Earnest.--Charles\r\n    Sumner’s Inflammatory Harangue in the Senate.--Appeal to\r\n    the North against the South.--The Fivefold Wrong of Human\r\n    Slavery.--Its Total Abolition in the United States the\r\n    Sacred Duty of the Republican Party.--The Helper and Spooner\r\n    Programmes fully and emphatically indorsed.--Mr. Sumner the\r\n    Leading Light of the Black Republicans._\r\n\r\n    “We give elsewhere, to-day, in full, the speech of Senator\r\n    Sumner, of Massachusetts, on the great question that is\r\n    presented to the whole country for judgment in November next.\r\n\r\n    “Not only the argument it contains, but the place where it was\r\n    uttered, and the position and character of the man who uttered\r\n    it, should be taken into consideration, in measuring its\r\n    bearing upon, and relation to, what may truthfully be called\r\n    the greatest question of the present age.…\r\n\r\n    “In that Senate which has so often resounded with the sublimest\r\n    utterances of human lips and human hopes, Mr. Sumner stands\r\n    forth the personification of a great and a free State, and the\r\n    representative man of a great and powerful political party in\r\n    fifteen of the sovereign States of this Union. He possesses\r\n    the philosophical acumen of Mr. Seward, without his cautious\r\n    reserve as a politician,--the honesty of Lincoln, without the\r\n    craft of a candidate in nomination,--and literary culture,\r\n    political zeal, and the gift of eloquence, which place him in\r\n    the very foremost rank as a leader and an exponent of the Black\r\n    Republican ideas. All of these circumstances combine to give a\r\n    more deep solemnity to his words, in this grave moment of their\r\n    utterance.…\r\n\r\n    “Every man admits that our fraternal relations with the\r\n    Southern States are productive of unmixed benefit to us and\r\n    to ours; and yet Lincoln and Seward incite the North to an\r\n    ‘irrepressible conflict’ with the South; and now comes another\r\n    mighty leader among the Black Republicans, and proclaims it to\r\n    be a ‘sacred animosity.’\r\n\r\n    “This is the burden of Mr. Sumner’s eloquence, and we need not\r\n    enter upon its details. But there is one characteristic of\r\n    this speech which is in perfect accordance with the policy of\r\n    the Black Republican party in the present campaign. The bloody\r\n    and terrible results which must ensue, if that party succeeds\r\n    in getting possession of the Federal Government, are kept\r\n    carefully out of view. John Brown’s practice is taught, but\r\n    there is no word of John Brown. The social condition of fifteen\r\n    populous, rich, and powerful States is to be revolutionized;\r\n    but not a hint of the possibility of resistance on their\r\n    part, or of the reactive effect of such resistance upon the\r\n    aggressive North, is dropped.”\r\n\r\nOn the next day the _Herald_ said:--\r\n\r\n    “_Sumner’s Truthful Exposition of the Aims of Black\r\n    Republicanism.--Its Teachings in the coming Conventions._\r\n\r\n    “The perfect platform of the Black Republican party has been\r\n    laid down by Senator Sumner in his recent speech in the Senate,\r\n    and it is now before the country for approval or rejection.”\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit, the _Richmond Despatch_ recognized the speech as an\r\nauthentic manifestation of Northern sentiment.\r\n\r\n     “The fact is, Sumner has spoken but too truly. His is the\r\n    spirit in which the South is regarded by the party to which\r\n    he belongs. He is its mouthpiece. His is the tongue to the\r\n    Abolition lyre, giving it utterance, bringing out its genuine\r\n    tones. Greeley and Raymond are afraid, just at this moment,\r\n    to speak the whole truth. They dare not let the conservative\r\n    portion of the people at the North know that it is the\r\n    design of the party with which they are associated to make\r\n    uncompromising war upon the South,--to destroy its institutions\r\n    at any cost of blood, to hunt down its people even to the\r\n    extremity of death, if it be necessary. The South ought to feel\r\n    obliged to Sumner for betraying the designs of the party. His\r\n    speech is a godsend.”\r\n\r\nThe _Indianapolis Daily Journal_ wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “We have read as much of Senator Sumner’s speech on the\r\n    Barbarism of Slavery as we have had time to read, and must\r\n    bear witness that it is one of the ablest, most exasperating,\r\n    and most useless speeches we ever read. It shows all through\r\n    the genius, the learning, and the hate of its gifted and\r\n    abused author. It is manifestly the revenge of the orator on\r\n    the institution that through Brooks’s arm struck him down so\r\n    brutally. It is intended less to check the growth of Slavery\r\n    than to gall Slaveholders. It is a scalding, excoriating\r\n    invective, almost without parallel in the annals of oratory.…\r\n    As a vengeance for the orator’s own wrongs, it is ample and\r\n    admirable. As an implement to aid the great work of repressing\r\n    Slavery extension, it is simply worthless, or worse. Slavery is\r\n    all that he charges. But slaveholders are not as barbarous as\r\n    their system.”\r\n\r\nThe _Boston Daily Advertiser_ begins by saying of the speech, that “its\r\ndenunciation, although strong, is not hot; its profuse learning and\r\nreference to history show elaboration and study; and the whole mass\r\nof reasoning, of rhetoric, and of authority is brought together and\r\nwielded with such skill and power as the greatest masters of oratory\r\nmight well envy”; and then the journal proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    “We confess that in our judgment the argument upon Slavery\r\n    itself need be neither long nor elaborate. The Golden Rule\r\n    has exhausted the subject, both upon principle and authority.\r\n    The testimony of one enlightened slaveholder like Jefferson,\r\n    who ‘trembled for his country, when he remembered that God\r\n    was just,’ tells us as much of the actual workings of the\r\n    institution as all the hideous narratives which its opponents\r\n    have culled in such appalling profusion from its current\r\n    history. The subject is one which is governed by principles\r\n    which are essentially and peculiarly elementary, and we confess\r\n    that we see not how any powers of eloquence or reasoning could\r\n    turn him who is not convinced by the simple statement of these\r\n    few original principles.…\r\n\r\n    “If the majority of the people are already right upon the main\r\n    subject,--and we should otherwise despair of the Republic,--we\r\n    must conclude that our efforts will be much more efficacious,\r\n    if directed at those constitutional heresies by means of which\r\n    this giant evil is at present carrying on its attack. It is in\r\n    this way, chiefly, that, within those limits of duty which the\r\n    Republican party is ever careful to affirm and observe, we can\r\n    hope to act efficiently upon this great question.”\r\n\r\nThe tone of the Democratic papers appears in the _Albany Atlas and\r\nArgus_.\r\n\r\n    “No one can rise from a perusal of this speech without a\r\n    contempt for the author, and a conviction of his unfitness for\r\n    the place.”\r\n\r\nAlso in the _Boston Post_.\r\n\r\n    “Charles Sumner’s recent speech is a curiosity that has no\r\n    parallel, at least in our Senatorial record. Pedantry, egotism,\r\n    fortuitous hypothesis, malice, rhapsody, and verbosity stripe\r\n    and emblazon it with disgusting conspicuousness.”\r\n\r\nOther papers were grateful and enthusiastic, generally in proportion to\r\ntheir Antislavery character.\r\n\r\nThe _Boston Traveller_ said:--\r\n\r\n    “No nobler specimen of American eloquence can be found than\r\n    this logical, bold, spirited, clear, and learned exposition\r\n    of the ‘Barbarism of Slavery.’ In it we have the views of the\r\n    chivalrous antagonist of Wrong, expressed in the pointed and\r\n    elegant language of the accomplished scholar, and guided by the\r\n    intellect of the sagacious and benevolent statesman. We are the\r\n    more pleased with the plain speaking of Mr. Sumner, because\r\n    there has apparently been a falling off in the language of some\r\n    leading Republicans since the beginning of the Presidential\r\n    contest, as if they were fearful of offending the Oligarchy.\r\n    Mr. Sumner, who has no idea of sacrificing the Right to the\r\n    Expedient, has given utterance to vital truths in language full\r\n    of vital energy,--‘Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.’”\r\n\r\nThe _Boston Transcript_ said:--\r\n\r\n    “Many persons, who read this speech without having previously\r\n    read a number of speeches made on the other side, may be likely\r\n    to consider it too abstract in its character. But, as many\r\n    Southern Senators, who assume to be the representative men\r\n    of their section, have gravely lectured the Senate at great\r\n    length in defence of the principles and practice of Slavery,\r\n    have taken the bold ground that it is in accordance with the\r\n    commands of God and the teachings of experience, have attempted\r\n    to show that it elevates the white man and blesses the black,\r\n    have even gone so far as to assert that labor, whether white\r\n    or black, is happier when owned than when hired, and on the\r\n    strength of these assumptions have eagerly argued for the\r\n    extension of such a beneficent institution into territory now\r\n    free, it is certainly proper that some man from the Northern\r\n    States should make an attempt to save religion, conscience,\r\n    reason, common sense, common sensibility, from being pressed\r\n    into the service of the wickedest and most nonsensical\r\n    paradoxes that ever entered the brain or came out of the mouth\r\n    of educated men.”\r\n\r\nThe _Boston Atlas and Bee_ said:--\r\n\r\n    “It is not too much to say that it is the boldest, most\r\n    thorough, and most uncompromising speech that Mr. Sumner has\r\n    ever delivered; and it is easy to see that it must prove the\r\n    most offensive to the slaveholders of any of his speeches. It\r\n    is a complete hand-book of their offences, and will excite in\r\n    them great and perhaps irrepressible rage.…\r\n\r\n    “In vigor of thought and style, this speech will rank among\r\n    the greatest, if not at the head, of Mr. Sumner’s productions.\r\n    It is straightforward, direct, logical, proceeding directly to\r\n    its mark and by the shortest line, striking the swiftest and\r\n    hardest blows, and never for a moment leaving the reader in\r\n    doubt as to its meaning, while it is enlivened by even more\r\n    than the orator’s usual wealth of classical and historical\r\n    lore. It is in every respect a remarkable speech, and will\r\n    arrest the attention of the whole country.”\r\n\r\nThe _Boston Journal_ said:--\r\n\r\n    “We trust that the length of Mr. Sumner’s speech will deter\r\n    none from its perusal. It is what it professes to be, an\r\n    examination of the institution of Slavery itself,--and we\r\n    venture to say a more acute, comprehensive, exhaustive, and\r\n    powerful exposition of the whole subject never was made.\r\n    Whoever wants to understand what American Slavery is must\r\n    read this speech; whoever wants to make headway against the\r\n    ripening public feeling by defending Slavery must first try to\r\n    answer the arguments of this speech. If he does not, he will\r\n    be in danger of imitating the folly of Senator Chesnut, and,\r\n    through an exhibition of passion and scurrility, of becoming a\r\n    living illustration of its truths.… The nation has certainly\r\n    been drifting into a too general acquiescence in the doctrine,\r\n    upheld openly or insidiously by both factions of the Democratic\r\n    party, that slaves are property, precisely like any other\r\n    property known to the Common Law. Any utterance like this of\r\n    Mr. Sumner’s, which shall call the American people from this\r\n    disgraceful and dangerous conclusion, may well be generously\r\n    criticised in other respects.”\r\n\r\nThe _New Bedford Mercury_ had the following, in a letter from Boston.\r\n\r\n    “The chief event of interest, certainly to Bostonians, lately,\r\n    is the astonishing speech delivered by Charles Sumner, in his\r\n    place in the Senate, in which he takes up the Slavery Question\r\n    precisely where he left it off, when stricken down by the cane\r\n    of the deceased bully Brooks. Offensive as that speech proved\r\n    to the Slave-Masters, this one is ten times worse. This speech,\r\n    for the first time in the history of Congressional speeches,\r\n    sets forth, without the slightest veil or mincing of the\r\n    matter, the deformities, obliquities, and immoralities of the\r\n    Slavery system.”\r\n\r\nThe _Albany Evening Journal_ said:--\r\n\r\n     “On the 22d of May, four years ago, we were startled with the\r\n    news that Charles Sumner had been struck down in the Senate\r\n    Chamber and nearly killed. Yesterday, for the first time since\r\n    that event, his eloquence again enchained the attention of the\r\n    Senate. The speech which provoked the assault in 1856 has been\r\n    more than matched in the one just delivered. The former speech\r\n    was read by millions, and the last is undoubtedly destined to\r\n    receive a still wider attention. The glowing eloquence and\r\n    surpassing erudition of Mr. Sumner give to all his speeches an\r\n    attraction difficult to resist, even by those who dislike the\r\n    doctrines he proclaims. His last speech is characterized not\r\n    only by his usual brilliancy of style, but contains a striking\r\n    array of facts and statistics which must have cost much patient\r\n    toil in collecting.”\r\n\r\nThe _Hartford Evening Press_ said:--\r\n\r\n    “It is said in certain quarters that it would have been more\r\n    politic to have left the speech unspoken. It is even urged by a\r\n    leading journal that the admission of Kansas is endangered by\r\n    it. The fact is, that the journal knows--none know better--that\r\n    the Kansas Bill stands just as good a chance at the hands of\r\n    Southern Senators to-day as if Charles Sumner had bent low\r\n    and with bated breath begged the admission of that Territory\r\n    as a favor, instead of demanding it as a right.… The speech\r\n    is demanded by the progress of the assumptions of Slavery.\r\n    It boldly sets itself up as divine in origin, Christian in\r\n    practice, the best form of civilized society, and challenges\r\n    our scrutiny and approbation. This, taken in connection with\r\n    its extraordinary interpretation of the Constitution as a\r\n    charter of Slavery, and not of Freedom, as we have all along\r\n    supposed it to be, forces the discussion upon us. Let us thank\r\n    Heaven that we have men bold enough to take up the gauntlet.\r\n    Charles Sumner deserves well of the country and well of the\r\n    age, for his calm and masterly exposition of the true character\r\n    of that system we are urged to accept and extend, as divine in\r\n    appointment, and adapted to the wants of our time.”\r\n\r\nThe _New Yorker Abendzeitung_, a German paper at New York, published an\r\nelaborate leader, translated by the _Evening Post_, of which this is an\r\nextract:--\r\n\r\n    “The oration made by Mr. Sumner is not a mere speech in the\r\n    common meaning of the term, but rather a thoroughly digested\r\n    treatise, carefully prepared, on the basis of a great number\r\n    of facts and quotations. It unites the most thorough-going\r\n    philosophical research, regardless of the conflict of its\r\n    results with the nearest practical aims, to that variegated\r\n    poetical coloring, which, appealing to the power of\r\n    imagination, is an indispensable element of an efficient\r\n    speech. Even to the best speeches of Senator Seward Sumner’s\r\n    speech stands in proportion as an oil painting of richest\r\n    coloring and most dramatic grouping of figures to a mere black\r\n    crayon etching. If Mr. Sumner’s speech had been uttered before\r\n    the meeting of the Chicago Convention, he would undoubtedly\r\n    have occupied a prominent rank among the candidates of the\r\n    radical portion of the Republican party.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sunday Transcript_, of Philadelphia, said:--\r\n\r\n    “The greatest speech of the season is certainly Charles\r\n    Sumner’s magnificent philippic against ‘The Great Barbarism.’\r\n    The learning and research, the array of facts, the apt and\r\n    eloquent quotations, the striking illustrations, and the\r\n    vivid imagery of the oration are its least merits. The style\r\n    and diction are as clear as crystal, as pure as water, and\r\n    sonorously musical. The entire tone of the speech is dignified\r\n    and lofty.…\r\n\r\n    “Indeed, we admire his courage, his unequalled moral _pluck_.\r\n    In this day of compromise and timidity, of bated breath and\r\n    base concession, when it is the loathsome fashion to say that\r\n    the Slavery Question should be discussed only as a matter of\r\n    profit and loss, it is refreshing to hear a Senator speak in\r\n    the spirit of Jefferson and the Fathers. Besides, does not\r\n    the South challenge us to discuss the abstract question? Do\r\n    not Benjamin, Toombs, Stephens, Curry, Keitt, Lamar, Hunter,\r\n    Slidell, Brown, Hammond, Chesnut, Mason, Pryor, Clingman,\r\n    Fitzhugh, and _all_ the Southern politicians, discuss the\r\n    question of Slavery in the abstract? Do they not deliver\r\n    long arguments to prove that Slavery is right, just, benign,\r\n    civilizing, and necessary,--that it is the proper condition of\r\n    the negro and the working-man? And is any free Northern man so\r\n    poor a poltroon as to say that these men shall not be _replied\r\n    to_? What! shall all the South be privileged to praise and\r\n    applaud Human Slavery, and not even Charles Sumner be allowed\r\n    to _describe it as it really is_?”\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Democrat,_ of Chicago, said:--\r\n\r\n    “This is the great speech of the day. It paints American\r\n    Slavery as it is, and as it has never been painted before.\r\n    No Republican can look upon the picture which Charles Sumner\r\n    draws of this Barbarism without feeling his heart swell with\r\n    hatred against it, and without recording a new vow to labor\r\n    unceasingly for its extinction.”\r\n\r\nEarly in the controversy _Frederick Douglass’s Paper_ bore testimony as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n     “At last the right word has been spoken in the Chamber of\r\n    the American Senate. Long and sadly have we waited for an\r\n    utterance like this, and were beginning at last to despair of\r\n    getting anything of the sort from the present generation of\r\n    Republican statesmen; but Senator Sumner has now exceeded all\r\n    our hopes, and filled up the full measure of all that we have\r\n    long desired in the Senatorial discussions of Slavery. He has\r\n    dared to grapple directly with the Hell-born monster itself.\r\n    It is not the unreasonableness of the demands of Slavery, not\r\n    the aggressions nor the mere arrogance of the Slave Power,\r\n    insufferable and unconstitutional as these have been, that have\r\n    now so thoroughly aroused the soul and fired the tongue of the\r\n    learned and eloquent Senator of Massachusetts, but the inherent\r\n    and brutal barbarism of Slavery itself.… His manner of assault\r\n    is, we think, faultless. It was calm, self-poised, earnest,\r\n    brave, and yet completely guarded. The network of his argument,\r\n    though wonderfully elaborate and various, is everywhere, and\r\n    in all its parts, strong as iron. The whole slaveholding\r\n    Propaganda of the Senate might dash themselves against it in a\r\n    compact body, without breaking the smallest fibre of any of its\r\n    various parts.”\r\n\r\nThe _Liberator_, in an editorial article by William Lloyd Garrison,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    “Throughout, its spirit was lofty, dignified, and bold,\r\n    indicative of high moral intrepidity and a noble purpose. No\r\n    attempts were made to interrupt him, though the smothered wrath\r\n    of the Southern members must have been excessive.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of an Antislavery paper, with the initials W. P., in\r\nan article entitled “Mr. Sumner’s Last and Greatest Speech,” said:--\r\n\r\n    “The Massachusetts Senator has led a column into this fortress,\r\n    which, in the name of God and Humanity, must eventually silence\r\n    all its guns and level its last stone to the ground. Neither\r\n    statesman nor philanthropist has ever, in like manner, rent\r\n    asunder the veil and exposed to the view of an outraged people\r\n    the Barbarism of Slavery. This Mr. Sumner has done, _and no man\r\n    can undo it_. ‘What is written is written.’ Slaveholders may\r\n    rave, Americans may ignore, Republicans may deplore, but the\r\n    speech and the name of Charles Sumner will live and be praised\r\n    when the death-pall of oblivion shall cover the last vestige of\r\n    these unhappy men.”\r\n\r\nThe _Independent_, of New York, said:--\r\n\r\n    “The world will one day acknowledge the debt of gratitude it\r\n    owes to the author of this masterly analysis. For four hours he\r\n    held a crowded audience in attention, including large numbers\r\n    of Southern people, members of Congress, and others.”\r\n\r\nThe _Antislavery Standard_, of New York, said:--\r\n\r\n    “Nothing like it, in elevation of tone and width of scope,\r\n    had ever before been heard in that Chamber. It was worth, to\r\n    the author, to the cause, and to the country, all that it\r\n    cost to produce it. For Mr. Sumner it was a great triumph and\r\n    a revenge. And yet there was nothing vindictive in its tone\r\n    or spirit. The ‘bitterness’ which is ascribed to it was in\r\n    its truth. No doubt it stirred the malignant passions of the\r\n    Slave-Masters to the deepest depths; but the fault was theirs,\r\n    not his. His facts were unquestionable, his logic beyond\r\n    the reach of cavil, and his rhetoric eminently becoming and\r\n    self-respectful.”\r\n\r\nWhile newspapers were discussing the speech, and Republicans were\r\ndiffering, the Legislature of Massachusetts threw its weight into the\r\nscales by the adoption of resolutions, entitled “Resolves relating to\r\nFreedom of Speech,” containing the following support of Mr. Sumner.\r\n\r\n    “_Resolved_, That the thanks of the people of this Commonwealth\r\n    are due and are hereby tendered to the Honorable Charles Sumner\r\n    for his recent manly and earnest assertion of the right of free\r\n    discussion on the floor of the United States Senate, and we\r\n    repeat the well-considered words of our predecessors in these\r\n    seats in approval of ‘Mr. Sumner’s manliness and courage in\r\n    his fearless declaration of free principles and his defence of\r\n    human rights and free institutions.’\r\n\r\n    “_Resolved_, That we approve the thorough, truthful, and\r\n    comprehensive examination of the institution of Slavery\r\n    embraced in Mr. Sumner’s recent speech; that the stern morality\r\n    of that speech, its logic, and its power command our entire\r\n    admiration; and that it expresses with fidelity the sentiments\r\n    of Massachusetts upon the question therein discussed.”\r\n\r\nThe meaning of these resolutions was not left doubtful by the mover, J.\r\nQ. A. Griffin, who, after alluding to “certain Conservative Republican\r\nnewspapers, such as the _New York Times_ and the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_, declaring that Mr. Sumner does not represent the Republican\r\nparty in any degree,” said, “It is necessary that Massachusetts should\r\nuphold her Senator.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conflict of opinion in the American press showed itself abroad. The\r\nLondon _Times_ took the lead in opposition. Its New York correspondent,\r\nentitled “Our own Correspondent,” in a letter dated June 6, said of\r\nthe speech: “A more studied insult to Southern slaveholding members,\r\nwho compose nearly one half of the body in which the speech was\r\ndelivered, a more vituperative attack upon the institution, a more\r\nbitter, galling, personal assault, or one more calculated to excite the\r\nworst feelings, can hardly be imagined.” Then quoting certain passages\r\nwithout explanation or context, and asking the reader to “bear in mind\r\nthat one half of the gentlemen who listened to him were slaveholders,”\r\nthe New York correspondent adds, “These extracts are sample bricks of\r\nthe whole structure.”\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ itself followed in a leader of June, 18, where the tone of\r\nits New York correspondent was reproduced; and here is the beginning\r\nof those attacks on the Antislavery cause in our country for which\r\nthis journal became so famous during the war. An extract will show its\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n     “We must, in the name of English Abolitionism at least,\r\n    protest against these foolish and vindictive harangues.\r\n    Scarcely has the frenzy caused by John Brown’s outrage begun\r\n    to die away than out comes Mr. Sumner with a speech which will\r\n    set the whole South in a flame. We can well believe that the\r\n    prospects of the Republican party have been already damaged\r\n    by it. Mr. Sumner is one of that class of politicians who\r\n    should be muzzled by their friends. The man who can in personal\r\n    irritability so forget the interests of a great cause is its\r\n    worst enemy. Slavery existed on the American Continent long\r\n    before the assembly of which Mr. Sumner is a member. On it\r\n    depends, or is supposed to depend, the prosperity of half the\r\n    Union; the looms of Lancashire and Normandy, as well as those\r\n    of Mr. Sumner’s own State, are supplied by slave-grown cotton,\r\n    and hundreds of millions of Northern dollars are invested in\r\n    slave-worked plantations. Slavery, with its roots thus deep\r\n    in the soil, is not to be rooted up by any peevish effort of\r\n    rhetoric; and we may predict that the man who first gains a\r\n    victory for the cause of Abolition will be of very different\r\n    temper to the Senator from Massachusetts.”\r\n\r\nThe London _Morning Star_, of June 20, replied at length, and with much\r\nfeeling. Here is an extract:--\r\n\r\n    “Who invested the _Times_ with the functions of the organ of\r\n    English Abolitionists? Who authorized the hoary charlatan of\r\n    Printing-House Square to speak authoritatively in the name of\r\n    the advocates of negro emancipation, and, as their assumed\r\n    representative, to bespatter with its venom one of the noblest\r\n    champions of that holy cause? Assuredly not the men of whom,\r\n    with the mendacious arrogance which has become to it a second\r\n    nature, it now pretends to be the appointed spokesman. Let it\r\n    canvass, if it will, the whole legion of British sympathizers\r\n    with the groaning slaves in the Southern States of America; it\r\n    will be puzzled to find one whom its coarse and unprincipled\r\n    attack upon Mr. Sumner has not inspired with sentiments of\r\n    mingled indignation and disgust.…\r\n\r\n    “We are convinced, that, throughout the length and breadth of\r\n    the United Kingdom, the noble speech of Mr. Sumner will awaken\r\n    reverence for his valor, admiration for his eloquence, and\r\n    sympathetic esteem for his genial sympathy for the down-trodden\r\n    slave; at any rate, we believe that there is but one journal\r\n    whose inveterate malignity would inspire it to heap censure\r\n    upon conduct which cannot be rewarded by too abundant homage.”\r\n\r\nThe London _Morning Advertiser_ also replied at length. Here is a\r\nspecimen:--\r\n\r\n    “We are not satisfied with a contemporary who chooses to\r\n    describe the noble oration of Senator Sumner as ‘a vituperative\r\n    attack,’ as ‘a bitter, galling, personal assault.’ It is full\r\n    of noble and manly thoughts, expressed in terms of becoming\r\n    strength, but not too strongly, considering the magnitude of\r\n    the evil against which it is directed, and the determination of\r\n    the party by whom it is maintained.”\r\n\r\nThe London _Daily News_, of June 22, followed.\r\n\r\n     “The barbaric character of Slavery, and of its supporters,\r\n    has been abundantly exhibited through the press of some\r\n    Northern States, but it has never before been displayed in the\r\n    Senate; and all criticism of it is excluded from the Southern\r\n    press, and from most of the Northern. In the progress of the\r\n    revolutionary conflict, the moment has arrived for the truth to\r\n    be told in the Senate; and Mr. Sumner, as the representative\r\n    of the most venerable State of the Union, was the man to utter\r\n    it. He described the character of Slavery; he proved its\r\n    operation upon the liberties of communities and the character\r\n    of individuals; and he declared the resolution of the Free\r\n    States to get rid of the evil of being implicated in such a\r\n    barbarism, and to save every new community from being cursed\r\n    with it against its will.”\r\n\r\nThen came _Punch_, July 21st, which said:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Summer’s speech was chiefly characterized by its closeness\r\n    of argument and lucidity of diction; but he occasionally\r\n    introduced a passage of highly wrought eloquence, or an\r\n    image of singular vividness; and in England, however the\r\n    orator’s sentiments might have been objected to by a political\r\n    antagonist, Mr. Sumner would have received the compliments of\r\n    gentlemen of both sides upon so remarkable an exhibition of\r\n    sustained power and intellectual skill.…\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Punch begs leave to offer his respectful congratulations\r\n    to Mr. Sumner upon his magnificent speech, and even more\r\n    earnestly upon the ample and perfect testimony that was\r\n    instantly given by the besotted slave-owners to the truth of\r\n    his assertion of the Barbarism of Slavery. It is not often that\r\n    an orator’s enemies are in such a desperate hurry to prove his\r\n    case for him. But here he was scarcely down, when the Slave\r\n    party rushed together to proclaim themselves the ruffians he\r\n    had painted them, and in the published copy of the oration Mr.\r\n    Sumner has given at once the calmest and the deadliest blow to\r\n    the system he denounces,--for he prints Mr. Chesnut’s speech.\r\n    All the bludgeons in the hands of all the ‘chivalry of the\r\n    South’ cannot beat that demonstration of Mr. Sumner’s case out\r\n    of the heads of the public in and out of the States. The speech\r\n    should be reprinted in England, and circulated in thousands.\r\n    What is the Antislavery Society about?”\r\n\r\nTo these London articles may be added passages from Miss Martineau’s\r\ncorrespondence with the _Antislavery Standard_, of New York. In a\r\nletter under date of July 2, the eminent writer said:--\r\n\r\n     “I may just say that Senator Chesnut’s commentary on Mr.\r\n    Sumner’s speech is very amusing here. He cannot know much of\r\n    the English aristocracy, if he supposes that strangers can get\r\n    at them by their back doors. Their back doors are well looked\r\n    to; but in Mr. Sumner’s case there was no question of back door\r\n    or front. Our aristocracy went out to seek him,--not he them. I\r\n    need not say that we heartily rejoice in the full truth having\r\n    been spoken in Congress. The occasion brings back vividly to my\r\n    memory Mr. Calhoun’s countenance and voice, when he insisted\r\n    to me, peremptorily putting down all argument, that that day\r\n    would never come: there would be silence about Slavery in\r\n    Congress world without end. This was in 1835. It must be also\r\n    needless for me to say that no unprejudiced man or woman here\r\n    really supposes that any terms can be kept with Slavery and\r\n    Slaveholders. The crisis of your revolution may be precipitated\r\n    by such open defiance in the Federal Legislature; but we see\r\n    that it was the South which brought on the revolution and\r\n    uttered the defiance, and that the only course for the Senator\r\n    from Massachusetts is to take care that the revolution is\r\n    steered straight by compass while there is such a fearful\r\n    tampering with the helm. To speak gingerly of Barbarism, when\r\n    his business was to set before his country the choice between\r\n    Barbarism and Civilization, was, of course, impossible; and\r\n    there could be no fidelity short of such a thorough exposure\r\n    and denunciation as he has offered.”\r\n\r\nThen, under date of July 16, Miss Martineau wrote again:--\r\n\r\n    “Since I wrote last, we have had the opportunity of reading\r\n    Mr. Sumner’s speech entire. I know no instance in which it was\r\n    so necessary to have read the whole in order to understand any\r\n    part; and certainly I can recall no case in which careless\r\n    and conceited critics have cut a more wretched figure in\r\n    condemning a production before they understood it. They\r\n    supposed themselves on safe ground, when they cited passages\r\n    of denunciation, leaving (as such isolated passages must)\r\n    an impression that the speaker had outraged the principles\r\n    and spirit of legislative debate by personal imputation and\r\n    provocation to passion. Mr. Sumner’s own friends here regretted\r\n    what they saw, simply because personal accusation and insult\r\n    can never do any good, and must, in a crisis like that of your\r\n    polity, render a complete rupture inevitable. As soon as we got\r\n    the whole speech, however, the aspect of the quoted paragraphs\r\n    was entirely changed. Instead of a piece of stimulating\r\n    invective, we find the speech to be a chapter of history,\r\n    and an exposition, calm and rational, of the workings of a\r\n    social institution which is brought forward for discussion,\r\n    and so placed on its trial, by Mr. Sumner’s opponents. To me\r\n    it appears a production of altogether incalculable importance,\r\n    apart from its merits in detail. Till now, if we could have\r\n    met with such a phenomenon in England as a person who was not\r\n    convinced of the wickedness and folly of Slavery, we should not\r\n    have known where to turn for a compact, reliable, serviceable\r\n    statement of the modern case of slave and free labor.”\r\n\r\nAnother testimony, purporting to be “by a distinguished writer of\r\nEngland,” appeared in the American papers at the time.\r\n\r\n    “Thanks, many thanks, for Sumner’s noble speech. It has been\r\n    read with swelling throats and tearful eyes. It is a mighty\r\n    effort towards wiping out the monstrous blot that disfigures\r\n    your fair country. I like well the way in which he takes head\r\n    after head of the foul Hydra, and severs each as completely\r\n    as ever Hercules did; yet his labor was child’s play in\r\n    comparison.”\r\n\r\nTo this English list may be joined a poem prompted by this speech.\r\nThe New York _Independent_, where it first appeared in our country,\r\nannounced that the initials subscribed to it were those of Mrs. L. W.\r\nFellowes, a daughter of Rowland Hill, originator of the cheap postage\r\nsystem in England.\r\n\r\n    “TO CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n    “As one who wandering lone is sudden stirred\r\n      With a wild gush of hidden woodland singing,\r\n    Doth picture to himself the beauteous bird\r\n      That with sweet concord sets the greenwood ringing,\r\n    And gazes eager round, and is full fain\r\n    To mark the warbler fair, yet gazes still in vain,--\r\n\r\n    “So I, being melted to my inmost soul\r\n      By this thy noble plaint for Freedom’s sake,\r\n    Do grieve that ocean-tides between us roll,\r\n      And that I ne’er can see thee strive to break\r\n    The shackles, e’en more harsh than those that bind\r\n    The slave-born limbs,--the shackles of the mind.\r\n\r\n    “Go on, brave heart! and faint not, though thy way\r\n      Be rough and rude, and torn with many a thorn:\r\n    All England would thee hail, if some white day\r\n      Thou, harassed by thy country’s bitter scorn,\r\n    Shouldst seek our friendly shore, and rest awhile\r\n    Thy wearied soul in this our happy Isle.\r\n\r\n            “L. W. F.\r\n\r\n    “WOLVERHAMPTON, ENGLAND.”\r\n\r\nThis speech took its place in foreign bibliography. French writers who\r\ndiscussed American Slavery cited it, among whom was that excellent\r\nally of our country, M. Édouard Laboulaye, who wrote always with equal\r\nknowledge and friendship. After quoting the famous words by which\r\nWesley describes and blasts Slavery, he gives a definition from this\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n    “The Americans of the North, who calculate even to the\r\n    beatings of the heart, have summed up this multifold crime\r\n    in five axioms. It is, say they, man become the property of\r\n    his fellow-man, marriage abolished, paternity destroyed,\r\n    intelligence systematically stifled, labor forced and\r\n    unpaid,--in other terms, tyranny, confiscation, and robbery.\r\n    Such are the essential vices of Slavery, vices independent\r\n    of the goodness or the wickedness of the master, vices\r\n    irremediable,--for to correct them is to acknowledge that the\r\n    Slave has some rights, it is to make a man of him, it is to\r\n    commence emancipation. Such, without exaggeration and without\r\n    declamation, is the ‘Barbarism of Slavery,’ as the eloquent\r\n    Senator of Massachusetts has justly called it.”\r\n\r\nThe able Frenchman then adds in a note:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sumner is the Senator who was struck down in the Senate\r\n    Chamber by a colleague from the South, for which the assailant\r\n    received a cane of honor, awarded by his admirers at the South.\r\n    The welcome which Mr. Sumner in turn received in England and\r\n    France, where he came to reëstablish his health, must have\r\n    proved to him how much on the Old Continent are still esteemed\r\n    courage and talent put forth in the service of humanity.”[140]\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of correspondents was in harmony with the Antislavery\r\npress. Both in character and number, their letters were of singular\r\nauthority. They show the sentiments of good men, and the extent to\r\nwhich the country was absorbed by the question of Slavery, although\r\npoliticians sought to put it out of sight. And since this discussion,\r\nculminated in war, they throw light on the origin of that terrible\r\nconflict, and therefore belong to history. Brief extracts are given\r\nfrom a portion of the letters within reach.\r\n\r\nThere can be no better name for the beginning than John G. Whittier,\r\nthe poet, who wrote from his home at Amesbury, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I have just finished reading _the_ speech. It is all that\r\n    I could wish for. It takes the dreadful question out of the\r\n    region of party and expediency, and holds it up in the clear\r\n    sun-blaze of truth and reason, in all its deformity, and with\r\n    the blackness of the pit clinging about it. In the light of\r\n    that speech the civilized world will now see American Slavery\r\n    as it is. There is something really awful in its Rhadamanthine\r\n    severity of justice; but it was needed.\r\n\r\n    “It especially rejoices thy personal friends to see in the\r\n    speech such confirmation of thy complete restoration to health\r\n    and strength of body and mind. It was the task of a giant.”\r\n\r\nFrederick Douglass, once a slave, wrote from Rochester, New York:--\r\n\r\n    “I wish I could tell you how deeply grateful I am to you, and\r\n    to God, for the speech you have now been able to make in the\r\n    United States Senate. You spoke to the Senate and the nation,\r\n    but you have a nobler and a mightier audience. The civilized\r\n    world will hear you, and rejoice at the tremendous exposure of\r\n    the meanness, brutality, blood-guiltiness, hell-black iniquity,\r\n    and barbarism of American Slavery. As one who has felt the\r\n    horrors of this stupendous violation of all human rights, I\r\n    venture thus far to trespass upon your time and attention. My\r\n    heart is full, Sir, and I could pour out my feelings at length,\r\n    but I know how precious is your time. I shall print every word\r\n    of your speech.”\r\n\r\nHon. S. P. Chase, afterwards Chief Justice of the United States, wrote\r\nfrom Columbus, Ohio:--\r\n\r\n    “Your great speech came to me, under your frank, this morning.\r\n    I had read it all--in the _Bulletin_ of Philadelphia, in the\r\n    _Times_ of New York, and in the _Globe_--before I received the\r\n    pamphlet copy. It is gratifying to know that the _New York\r\n    Herald_ also prints it, and that, through various channels of\r\n    publication, it will reach every corner of the land, ‘_cogens\r\n    omnes ante thronum_.’ ‘_C’est presqu’un discours antique_,’\r\n    said a French gentleman to me last Saturday. I say, ‘_C’est\r\n    bien plus._’”\r\n\r\nHon. Francis Gillette, an Abolitionist, and formerly Senator of the\r\nUnited States from Connecticut, wrote from Hartford:--\r\n\r\n    “I cannot tell you how pleased I am with your late speech on\r\n    the ‘Barbarism of Slavery.’ It makes a lustrum in the Senate,\r\n    and an era in the history of the Antislavery cause. But I am\r\n    afraid the bloodthirsty barbarians are intent on assassinating\r\n    you. Look out for them, and when they apologize to you with the\r\n    pretension of drunkenness, understand them to mean they are\r\n    drunk with rage. Do not believe them.”\r\n\r\nHon. Carl Schurz, the German orator, afterwards Senator of the United\r\nStates from Missouri, wrote from Milwaukee, Wisconsin:--\r\n\r\n    “Allow me to congratulate you on the success of your great\r\n    speech. It did me good to hear again the true ring of the moral\r\n    Antislavery sentiment. If we want to demolish the Slave Power,\r\n    we must educate the hearts of the people no less than their\r\n    heads.”\r\n\r\nHon. Joshua R. Giddings, so long a champion of Freedom in Congress,\r\nwrote from his home at Jefferson, Ohio:--\r\n\r\n    “Permit me to congratulate you. My heart swells with gratitude\r\n    to God that you are again permitted to stand in the Senate and\r\n    maintain the honor of a nation and of mankind. I dared not say\r\n    to you how much I feared the effect of that excitement which\r\n    I knew must attend you while speaking in the Senate. But now\r\n    you have passed the most trying point, I hope no evil effects\r\n    will result to your health; but, however health or life may be\r\n    affected, you have again spoken.”\r\n\r\nThen again the veteran champion wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “Of all the subjects before you, no one was so well adapted\r\n    to the occasion as the ‘Barbarism of Slavery.’ And no man was\r\n    so well adapted to the subject as yourself. I was profoundly\r\n    grateful that you succeeded in pronouncing the speech,--and\r\n    still more so, when I read it. It is worthy of yourself. Thus\r\n    far my desires and prayers in regard to you have been fully\r\n    met. May your services to your country and mankind continue so\r\n    long as life continues!”\r\n\r\nHon. George W. Julian, another champion in Congress, wrote from his\r\nhome at Centreville, Indiana:--\r\n\r\n    “I am exceedingly rejoiced that you have made your great\r\n    speech, and said just what I understand you have said about\r\n    the whole question of Slavery. But I grow sick, indignant, and\r\n    nervous, on reading the cowardly notices of the speech by windy\r\n    Republican journals.”\r\n\r\nHon. John Jay, afterwards Minister to Austria, wrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n    “I wrote you hastily my congratulations and thanks on your last\r\n    powerful effort, the effect of which I think will be stupendous\r\n    and permanent, giving a vigor to the cause, and a definiteness\r\n    to the opinion of the North, and an example of pluck more\r\n    powerful in its persuasive influence than a thousand essays.”\r\n\r\nHon. Gerrit Smith, always champion of the slave, wrote from his home at\r\nPeterborough, New York:--\r\n\r\n    “I have this day read your speech as it appeared in the _New\r\n    York Times_ of the 5th. God be praised for the proof it affords\r\n    that you are yourself again,--ay, more than yourself! I say\r\n    more,--for, though the ‘Crime against Kansas’ _was_ the speech\r\n    of your life, this _is_ the speech of your life. This eclipses\r\n    that. It is far more instructive, and will be far more useful,\r\n    and it is not at all inferior to the other in vigor or rhetoric.\r\n\r\n    “The slaveholders will all read this speech, and will all be\r\n    profited by its clear, certain, and convincing truths. The\r\n    candid among them will not dislike you for it; not a few of\r\n    them will, at least in their hearts, thank and honor you for\r\n    it. Would that they all might see that there is no wrong, no\r\n    malice whatever, in your heart! Would that they all might see\r\n    that you do not hate the slaveholder, but pity him as the\r\n    victim of a false education!…\r\n\r\n    “I have read the editorial of the _Times_ on your speech. It is\r\n    more than unjust, it is wicked. Nor has the _Tribune_, so far\r\n    as I have seen, any praises for you. But this is their way, or\r\n    rather one of their ways, for promoting the interests of your\r\n    Republican party.”\r\n\r\nMr. Smith added in a subsequent letter:--\r\n\r\n    “I am scattering through my county the great speech of your\r\n    life: I mean your speech on the Barbarism of Slavery. It is\r\n    just to the taste of Republicans here,--for the Republicans\r\n    here are nearly all Abolitionists.”\r\n\r\nRev. John Pierpont, lifelong Abolitionist, and poet, wrote from the\r\nhome of Gerrit Smith, whose guest he was:--\r\n\r\n     “I finished the reading of your great speech in the car on\r\n    my way hither, and, permit me to say, thank you for it with my\r\n    whole soul,--notwithstanding the qualified commendations of\r\n    it that may have found their way into some of the Republican\r\n    papers.”\r\n\r\nHon. Samuel E. Sewall, another lifelong Abolitionist, and able lawyer,\r\nwrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “I rejoice that you have had the courage to exhibit in a\r\n    systematic manner the essential barbarism of the institution.\r\n    Everywhere I hear your speech spoken of in the highest terms of\r\n    admiration. Even the most desperate conservatives are compelled\r\n    to acknowledge your eloquence and ability. Nor do they deny\r\n    the justice of your attack on the system of Slavery. But they\r\n    say the time you chose for making this assault was inopportune\r\n    and ill-judged, that it could only retard the admission of\r\n    Kansas, that it is likely to have a bad effect on slaveholders,\r\n    etc., etc., etc. It seems to me, however, that no occasion for\r\n    denouncing an institution which is the ruin and disgrace of our\r\n    nation can be inopportune.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, who gave his name to a school of Abolitionists,\r\nand was himself a host in constancy and lofty principle, wrote from\r\nBoston:--\r\n\r\n    “Allow me warmly to congratulate you upon your complete\r\n    restoration to health, and upon the successful delivery\r\n    of your great speech in Congress, the potency of which is\r\n    seen in the writhings and denunciations of the slaveholding\r\n    oligarchy and their base Northern allies, quite as much as in\r\n    the commendations and rejoicings of your numerous friends and\r\n    admirers.”\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips, the orator of Freedom, and early friend, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “I rejoice with a full heart, not only, not so much perhaps, in\r\n    your glorious speech, as in what we so longed for and hoped,\r\n    that you are again on your feet, again in harness,--it is so\r\n    heart-stirring and cheering to hear your voice once more along\r\n    the lines, and just now, too, when you and a very few others\r\n    seem to embody all the real Antislavery there is in politics.\r\n    Those were ‘four’ nobly used hours. ’Twas a blast of the old\r\n    well-known bugle, and fell on welcoming ears, and thankful\r\n    ones.”\r\n\r\nEdmund Quincy, the accomplished writer and determined Abolitionist,\r\nwrote from Dedham:--\r\n\r\n     “The spirit moveth me to tell you how much I admired your\r\n    speech of last Monday, the rather that I see that the dishes\r\n    of skim-milk that you are trying to stir to an honorable\r\n    action are turning sour to your word. The fact is, the leading\r\n    Republicans not only don’t know enough to go in when it rains,\r\n    but they quarrel with the man that offers them an umbrella.…\r\n    I beg you to believe that the editors do not express the real\r\n    feeling of the Republicans about your speech, as far as I have\r\n    talked with them. The common people received it gladly; and its\r\n    great power, eloquence, and exhaustive and unanswerable quality\r\n    everybody acknowledges, even the enemy. You have done a good\r\n    service to the country, and a great one to your party, if they\r\n    have the sense to make use of it.”\r\n\r\nLewis Tappan, the ancient and leading Abolitionist, wrote from New\r\nYork:--\r\n\r\n    “The speech is timely and valuable. Everywhere I have heard it\r\n    highly commended. Still some Republicans dislike it, at this\r\n    crisis. But the party needs having their attention directed to\r\n    the moral aspects of the question. May the good Lord protect\r\n    and bless you, and enable you to feel a consciousness of his\r\n    presence and inspiration!”\r\n\r\nJ. Miller M’Kim, an active Abolitionist, who did much for the cause,\r\nwrote from Philadelphia:--\r\n\r\n    “The speech is in great demand here. Twenty-five cents a copy\r\n    have been offered for the _Herald_ or _Bulletin_ containing\r\n    it. I am disgusted with the notices of it which have appeared\r\n    in some of the leading Republican prints. Maugre them all, I\r\n    say, and all right-minded men will say, it was _judicious_,\r\n    _well-timed_, and _german to the question before the country_.”\r\n\r\nRev. Parker Pillsbury, the Garrisonian Abolitionist, who thought the\r\nRepublican party too feeble, wrote from Cumington, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “Amid the profusion of epistolary plaudits you will doubtless\r\n    receive for your late powerful protest against Slavery, a voice\r\n    humble as mine can be to you only of slight account. And yet\r\n    I cannot forbear my congratulations at your so far recovered\r\n    vigor and health, and the cause of Freedom and Humanity, that\r\n    it still receives the powerful aid and advocacy of your voice\r\n    and influence. I only regret that a speech of such power as\r\n    your last must be laid on the altar of Republicanism, while to\r\n    the leaders of the party your utterances are distasteful, if\r\n    not absolutely terrific.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria Weston Chapman, the courageous Abolitionist, always faithful\r\nand intelligent, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “Will you accept my hearty thanks for your speech? Exciting, as\r\n    it must, a rage of hatred in some, proportionate to the love\r\n    and gratitude it secures from others, I am sure your life is in\r\n    danger; but with you, the greater the danger, the greater the\r\n    courage,--and courage is preservative. No need to bid you be of\r\n    good cheer: one in your place cannot help being so.”\r\n\r\nRev. George B. Cheever, whose soul was in the Antislavery cause, wrote\r\nfrom New York:--\r\n\r\n     “I bless you from the bottom of my heart, and praise God for\r\n    his goodness in sparing you and returning you to your place in\r\n    the Senate for that great work. It is a mighty blow, struck\r\n    just at the right time, with a severity, pungency, and hearty\r\n    earnestness that it does one’s very soul good to witness. God\r\n    bless you, and keep you, my dear friend and brother!--for you\r\n    must allow me to use this language, since you have endeared\r\n    yourself to every lover of freedom and justice, of truth and\r\n    righteousness, and to every friend of the slave, more than\r\n    ever; and your noble course might justify even a personal\r\n    stranger in addressing you thus. You are very dear to us all.”\r\n\r\nRev. William H. Furness, the Unitarian preacher, whose gentle nature\r\nwas always aroused by Slavery, wrote from Philadelphia:--\r\n\r\n    “I have just read the telegram of your speech, and I must tell\r\n    you that I have no words to express my admiration, gratitude,\r\n    love. It is a grand justification of your non-resignation of\r\n    your seat. The grace of God is on you,--his special favor, in\r\n    that you have had the will and the opportunity for so faithful,\r\n    so noble an utterance. It is a planetary space beyond and above\r\n    the Republican party.”\r\n\r\nIn another letter he wrote further:\r\n\r\n    “I have no words to describe the blessed work you have done.\r\n    Never for one instant mind the ‘cold-shoulderism’ of the\r\n    _Tribune_, or the heartlessness around you; but rest assured\r\n    that you have sent the truth into the inmost being of the\r\n    Southern men who heard you. They may affect contempt by their\r\n    silence, or they may rail and foam like Chesnut, but they\r\n    know that you have spoken the bitter and biting truth without\r\n    bitterness and without fear, as became a Christian gentleman.\r\n    I declare to you that I consider that you are paid for the\r\n    inaction and suffering of the last four years, and so are we.\r\n    You cannot, no one can, begin to estimate the substantial work\r\n    that you have done, both in regard to the essential truth,\r\n    which you have demonstrated, and more to the perfect spirit and\r\n    manner of the work.”\r\n\r\nRev. O. B. Frothingham, the courageous clergyman and reformer, wrote\r\nfrom New York:--\r\n\r\n    “Expressing my satisfaction and delight with your recent\r\n    speech in the Senate, I do not know which most to be thankful\r\n    for,--the complete restoration of your physical and mental\r\n    power indicated by it, or the unabated courage it manifests,\r\n    or the undazzled moral vision it displays in every sentence.\r\n    To read it is like inhaling a draught of air in midsummer from\r\n    the cliffs of Nahant or the hills of New Hampshire. It gives\r\n    a conscience to legislation, and sets us all back upon the\r\n    everlasting truth and rectitude.”\r\n\r\nRev. Nathaniel Hall, an excellent clergyman, beloved by all who knew\r\nhim, wrote from Dorchester, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n     “Nobly you have dared to speak the truth, where to speak the\r\n    truth, as you well knew, was to imperil life: I do not know\r\n    in our day a nobler instance of moral bravery. And the speech\r\n    itself, so clear, so strong, so impregnable in its arguments,\r\n    so unanswerable in its facts, so unexceptionable in its tone,\r\n    so free from personalities (save where for truth’s sake and the\r\n    cause they must have been), so comprehensive, so conclusive,\r\n    so great, so good, so Christian, so worthy,--yes, of a\r\n    Christian statesman,--so lifted in tone and character above the\r\n    utterances of that place,--my soul thanks you for it,--thanks\r\n    God with added fervor, that he spared your life, and brought\r\n    you back to your honored seat, and enabled you to such\r\n    fidelity. It richly pays for these years of waiting.… Whatever\r\n    a partisan press may say, whatever political opponents and\r\n    political _friends_ may say, whatever of coolness and mistrust\r\n    may be expressed, where you had a right to expect sympathy and\r\n    support, be assured that deep in the hearts of multitudes of\r\n    all parties you are honored, and will be by increasing numbers.\r\n    I know it from what I know of human nature in myself. I know\r\n    that my feelings _must_ be shared. I know that the secret\r\n    reverence not only of the true-hearted, but of all who have\r\n    not sunk below the mark where appreciation of true-heartedness\r\n    is impossible, must be given to him who has stood forth in the\r\n    intrepidity of a Christian manliness, to declare, in the face\r\n    and beneath the power of its violators, strong in power and\r\n    reckless in deed, the eternal law of rectitude and mercy.”\r\n\r\nRev. Convers Francis, the learned professor and stanch Abolitionist,\r\nwrote from Harvard University:--\r\n\r\n    “Thanks, many and most hearty thanks, for that great, very\r\n    great speech, and for your kindness in sending it to me. What a\r\n    portraiture of the Barbarism of Slavery! And what a master hand\r\n    to draw it! Such a picture none but an artist of the highest\r\n    order could paint. I must tell you, Mr. Sumner, that nothing on\r\n    this great and fearful subject has ever so filled and satisfied\r\n    my whole soul. ‘Too severe,’ say some; ‘not good policy to\r\n    irritate the South.’ I tell them, Not an iota too strong.\r\n    I would not have a single sentence or word less pungent or\r\n    forcible, if I could; because every sentence and every word are\r\n    loaded deep with truth, such truth as I rejoice that somebody\r\n    is found in our Congress to give utterance to.… You have done\r\n    great and excellent things before, Mr. Sumner, but this, I must\r\n    say, seems to me the greatest and most excellent of all. The\r\n    abundance of facts from the most unquestionable sources, the\r\n    admirable arrangement, the keen and searching application of\r\n    the argument, the masterly logic, and the manly eloquence of\r\n    the speech will make it a document of truth and righteousness\r\n    for all coming time.”[141]\r\n\r\nRev. John T. Sargent, Abolitionist and faithful reformer, wrote from\r\nBoston:--\r\n\r\n     “Every column of the paper, as I took it up, seemed to gleam\r\n    on me like the golden lamps of the Apocalypse. How irresistible\r\n    are your arguments! How pungent, and yet how Christian, your\r\n    rebuke of this sore iniquity of our time! How sharp and clear\r\n    goes the sword of your spirit through all the sophistry of your\r\n    opponents! My soul has been in a glow all through the reading,\r\n    and over the pathos of parts I have cried as if my heart would\r\n    break.”\r\n\r\nRev. Frederick Hinckley, Free-Soiler from the start, wrote from\r\nLowell:--\r\n\r\n    “I write this hasty note to tell you how much I thank you (and\r\n    I think the heart of New England thanks you, too) for your\r\n    recent speech on the ‘Barbarism of Slavery,’ in its moral tone\r\n    and outspoken truthfulness so far above all other Republican\r\n    speeches in Congress or Convention, carrying us back to the\r\n    remembrance of the old Free-Soil times, when the party had more\r\n    moral than political power, and, not expecting success, could\r\n    speak right out.”\r\n\r\nRev. Beriah Green, one of the most devoted among Abolitionists, wrote\r\nfrom Whitesborough, New York:--\r\n\r\n    “Such massive, enduring truth! uttered so clearly, definitely,\r\n    fully! The argument so perspicuous, compact, conclusive! The\r\n    illustrations so apt, so fresh, so sparkling! The conclusions\r\n    so weighty, grand, impressive! Every paragraph pervaded,\r\n    radiant, with scholarly beauty. When did literature, our own or\r\n    other, ever more willingly, more generously, come, all vigorous\r\n    and graceful, to the aid of any of her sons?\r\n\r\n    “I bless God, and thank you, for the deep-toned, comprehensive\r\n    humanity which pervades, which consecrates and hallows your\r\n    paragraphs. I found myself, as I moved on step by step through\r\n    your trains of thought, quickened and encouraged, inspired and\r\n    refreshed. The impression which the speech as a whole made upon\r\n    my innermost spirit it is my privilege to cherish and retain.\r\n    I shall, I trust, be more fraternal in my regards for all my\r\n    fellows forever, for your brave, manly utterances. Blessings on\r\n    your head, heart, and estate!”\r\n\r\nRev. Thomas C. Upham, author, professor, and devoted friend of Peace,\r\nwrote from Bowdoin College, in Maine:--\r\n\r\n    “Your history in Congress has been a providential one. I do\r\n    most fully believe that the hand of God has been in it from the\r\n    beginning. I thought that the blow which struck you down in the\r\n    Senate was destined, through the overrulings of Providence, to\r\n    break the chains of the slave, and I think so still. Allow me\r\n    to congratulate you, in connection with multitudes of others,\r\n    on your return to the country and the Senate, and on the\r\n    utterance of great and true and kind words which will have an\r\n    influence on the hearts of thinking men throughout the nation.”\r\n\r\nRev. Henry M. Dexter, religious editor, and zealous historian of the\r\nPlymouth Pilgrims, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “I cannot help feeling, my dear Sir, that you have made the\r\n    most effective argument which the country has yet listened to\r\n    on the general subject of the evils of that horrible system\r\n    under which our nation is reeling like a giant poisoned by\r\n    an adder. God bless you for your faithfulness, so calm, so\r\n    dignified, so just, so overwhelming in its logical results,\r\n    and grant that in ‘the good time coming’ your voice may often\r\n    be lifted in that Senate House to more appreciative and\r\n    coöperative auditors!”\r\n\r\nRev. Joseph P. Thompson, the eminent divine and eloquent preacher,\r\nwrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n    “My first duty as a Christian is to thank God that he has\r\n    restored you to the Senate with physical and mental vigor equal\r\n    to the great debate in which you have just borne so noble a\r\n    part. My first duty as a patriot is to thank you for a speech\r\n    which meets fully, squarely, ably, eloquently, conclusively,\r\n    the one issue upon which our national welfare now depends. My\r\n    first duty as a friend is to express the high satisfaction\r\n    with which I have read the speech throughout, every line and\r\n    letter of it, and the peculiar pleasure with which I have\r\n    observed your self-control and avoidance of personalities\r\n    under provocation, and your fearless and searching exposure of\r\n    the barbarism and criminality of Slavery under the very eye\r\n    of its bullying champions and in the very place where you had\r\n    suffered its deadly malice. I am ashamed of the timid comments,\r\n    almost deprecating indeed, of the _Tribune_ and _Post_ upon\r\n    the only speech in the Senate which has reached the core of\r\n    the question. If the Republican party is to seek success by\r\n    blinking the real issue of the right or wrong of Slavery, I am\r\n    prepared to witness its defeat without regret.”\r\n\r\nRev. Thomas T. Stone, the persuasive preacher, and student of Plato,\r\nwrote from Bolton, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “It is scarcely necessary that I should tell you how much I\r\n    thank you for your public deeds. I was one who wished your\r\n    seat in the Senate empty, till either you filled it, or the\r\n    inevitable doom removed you from the possibility of doing it.\r\n    May the words which have ennobled it go forth as thunders,\r\n    arousing souls now deadened by the barbarisms of our country\r\n    and our age!\r\n\r\n        “‘Quo bruta tellus et vaga flumina,\r\n        Quo Styx et invisi horrida Tænari\r\n        Sedes, Atlanteusque finis\r\n        Concutitur.’”[142]\r\n\r\nRev. Caleb Stetson, the Liberal clergyman, and early foe of Slavery,\r\nwrote from Lexington, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “It is the best and completest word that has yet gone forth\r\n    on the subject. If another as good can be made, it must be by\r\n    yourself.”\r\n\r\nRev. Rufus P. Stebbins, the Unitarian divine, wrote from Woburn,\r\nMassachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I have read your last speech in the Senate on ‘The Barbarism\r\n    of Slavery’ with admiration and gratitude. As a citizen,\r\n    a constituent, I thank you from my heart’s core. It was a\r\n    glorious triumph, such as no Roman consul or general ever won,\r\n    to stand in your place, after such a long absence, for such a\r\n    cause, and through four long hours proclaim such holy truth in\r\n    such distinct language as was never before heard on that floor.\r\n    It is glory enough for one life.”\r\n\r\nRev. William C. Whitcomb, an earnest clergyman and Abolitionist, wrote\r\nfrom Lynnfield Centre, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “A thousand thanks to you for your speech in Congress this\r\n    week. ’Tis the most thorough, satisfactory, and powerful speech\r\n    I have ever read on the subject of Slavery, or any subject.\r\n    ’Twill secure millions of readers, and I trust open the eyes of\r\n    the nation to the ‘Barbarism of Slavery.’ Ever think of me, and\r\n    the people to whom I preach, as among your warmest admirers,\r\n    lovers, and sympathizers.”\r\n\r\nRev. David Root, retired clergyman and Abolitionist, wrote from\r\nCheshire, Connecticut:--\r\n\r\n    “Though approaching seventy, such is my heartfelt interest\r\n    in the cause you advocate, that I could cry with joy over\r\n    the thought that there is at least one member in Congress\r\n    who is able, and who has the moral courage, to do justice to\r\n    that great enormity, that atrocious wickedness, that deep\r\n    and damning crime of Slaveholding. You seem to have embraced\r\n    in your speech the whole subject, in all its important\r\n    departments, and with a plainness, directness, pith, force,\r\n    and pungency worthy of the highest commendation. It should\r\n    be a permanent and standard document on that subject, and be\r\n    perpetuated through all coming time, that other generations may\r\n    look at it and learn to hate Slavery and love Liberty.… Mind\r\n    not what some timid croakers may say about being ill-timed or\r\n    calculated to injure our Republican campaign. It is not so. You\r\n    have given us just the document we needed, going down to the\r\n    foundation.”\r\n\r\nRev. Edgar Buckingham, an early schoolmate of Mr. Sumner, wrote from\r\nhis parish at Troy, New York:--\r\n\r\n    “I congratulate you upon the fidelity and the courage which you\r\n    have manifested; and though I do not rejoice in all severity, I\r\n    rejoice always in the severity of truth, and I trust that the\r\n    leaders of the Republican party will unanimously decide, that,\r\n    not their expediencies, but God’s opportunity, is always the\r\n    test of the time in which truth is to be spoken.”\r\n\r\nRev. J. S. Berry wrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n     “Allow me, though a stranger, to thank you in the name of\r\n    Humanity for the noble speech on the ‘Barbarism of Slavery’\r\n    just delivered by you in the Senate, so just, so truthful,\r\n    and so _timely_. I bless God that he has so far restored you,\r\n    and brought you to ‘this hour.’ Thousands of hearts thrill\r\n    with intense hatred of Slavery, as they read your startling\r\n    disclosures of its workings; and the prayers of these same\r\n    thousands, nay, millions, ascend to the Father of us all, that\r\n    you may be long spared to show up the wickedness and inhumanity\r\n    of the institution. I rejoice that not alone on political\r\n    grounds do you attack the system.”\r\n\r\nRev. Daniel Foster, pastor, Abolitionist, and pioneer in Kansas, wrote\r\nfrom the town of Sumner there:--\r\n\r\n    “I rise from the perusal of your speech on the ‘Barbarism of\r\n    Slavery’ with such feelings of affection and reverence for you\r\n    that I must give my feelings and emotion vent by a word of\r\n    thanks to you. I was grievously disappointed in ----’s speech.\r\n    Yours fully satisfies me, it is so thorough, exhaustive,\r\n    forcible, and withal so lofty and noble and patriotic in its\r\n    spirit.”\r\n\r\nT. Dwight Thacher, journalist, and Kansas pioneer, wrote from\r\nLawrence:--\r\n\r\n    “Allow me, though an entire stranger, to express my thanks for\r\n    the delivery of your recent great speech in the Senate of the\r\n    United States. You may rest assured that the true, radical,\r\n    Free State men of Kansas have no kind of sympathy with those\r\n    who are so solicitous lest that speech should have injured our\r\n    prospects for admission. We have learned the Slave Power well\r\n    enough to know that its schemes of injustice toward us are not\r\n    the offspring of sudden and transient excitements, but are the\r\n    deep and well-settled purpose of years. And for one I would\r\n    rather that we should remain out of the Union forever than that\r\n    a single utterance in favor of Freedom should be suppressed in\r\n    the Senate.”\r\n\r\nH. R. Helper, of North Carolina, afterwards Consul at Buenos Ayres,\r\nauthor of the work entitled “The Impending Crisis,” wrote from New\r\nYork:--\r\n\r\n    “I am in ecstasies with your speech of yesterday. Every word is\r\n    put just where it was most needed. One such speech at intervals\r\n    of even four years is worth incomparably more than a _Globe_ of\r\n    ordinary debate every day.”\r\n\r\nTheodore Tilton, the eloquent lecturer and journalist, sent this good\r\nword from New York:--\r\n\r\n     “I hasten to offer you my congratulations, not merely as a\r\n    personal friend, but as a citizen, for your vindication of\r\n    Liberty. Since the Senate began its sessions, no speech has\r\n    been made on the floor which has satisfied me except this. I\r\n    am glad that you have been neither intimidated to silence nor\r\n    hallucinated by ‘expediency’ into speaking only half the truth.”\r\n\r\nFrancis H. Upton, lawyer, and author of the work on “The Law of Nations\r\naffecting Commerce during War,” wrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n    “Thank God that you are yet stanch and strong, and in all\r\n    things fit for the fight that is before us. I have no sympathy\r\n    with those who prate of the _impolicy_ of your present\r\n    utterance, and also suggest the possibility of its influencing\r\n    Senators to obstruct or postpone the admission of Kansas. It\r\n    seems to me that he is but an ill observer of the signs of the\r\n    times, and has not his finger upon the nation’s pulse, who\r\n    fails to perceive that the day of soft words and bated breath\r\n    and candy-tongued conciliation is gone, and gone forever.\r\n    Slavery has seen its last triumph, and henceforth should\r\n    receive no quarter.”\r\n\r\nHon. William Curtis Noyes, the eminent lawyer and exemplary citizen,\r\nwrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n    “I thank you cordially for your speech on the ‘Barbarism of\r\n    Slavery’; and I thank you still more for having delivered it\r\n    in the Senate, where you had a right to speak, and were bound\r\n    to speak upon that subject first of all upon your restoration\r\n    to health. Allow me also to congratulate you on that event, so\r\n    auspicious to yourself and your country.”\r\n\r\nHon. John Bigelow, the able journalist, and afterwards Minister to\r\nFrance, wrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n    “I have not found an opportunity until to-day of reading your\r\n    speech about the Barbarism of Slavery. It is the best arranged\r\n    and by far the most complete exposure of the horrid rite of\r\n    Slavery to be found within the same compass in any language, so\r\n    far as known.”\r\n\r\nHon. Hiram Barney, for many years an Abolitionist, Collector of the\r\nPort of New York under President Lincoln, wrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n    “I was mortified to see in some of our Republican papers unkind\r\n    criticisms on the expediency of such a speech at this time. In\r\n    my judgment it is the best speech you have ever made. It was\r\n    made at the best moment practicable to make it, and it would\r\n    have been a wrong to the country and the cause to have withheld\r\n    it. Moreover, it was made by the right man in the right place.\r\n    It is the most valuable Antislavery document that I have ever\r\n    seen.”\r\n\r\nThomas Hicks, the artist, wrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n    “I have just read your speech. It is solid with fact,\r\n    eloquence, and courage,--right in matter, place, and time.”\r\n\r\nAlfred Willard, a strong Republican, wrote from New York:--\r\n\r\n    “The South Carolina Senator spoke truly, in saying your speech\r\n    was ‘characteristic.’ It was so indeed, not only of yourself,\r\n    but glorious old Massachusetts, whose happy fortune it is\r\n    that her Senators dare speak boldly for Truth and Freedom.\r\n    Sir, you spoke yesterday not for yourself alone; thousands,\r\n    ay, millions, of American citizens will sympathize to their\r\n    hearts’ core with every word so fearlessly spoken. As your\r\n    speech was ‘characteristic,’ so also was the brief South\r\n    Carolina response.… Your speech will serve admirably, not only\r\n    as a powerful and able argument for Freedom, but as a campaign\r\n    document in the coming contest.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Charles D. Cleveland, the accomplished teacher and early\r\nAbolitionist, wrote from Philadelphia:--\r\n\r\n    “Many, many heartfelt thanks to you, my dear friend, for your\r\n    noble speech. It takes the only true ground,--the essential\r\n    barbarism and sinfulness of Slavery. The few lines in reply to\r\n    the infamous remarks of Chesnut were admirable, just the thing,\r\n    and I hope his remarks and yours will go with the speech in its\r\n    pamphlet form. What would I have given to hear it!”\r\n\r\nE. M. Davis, merchant and constant Abolitionist, wrote from\r\nPhiladelphia:--\r\n\r\n    “So many people will thank you for your timely, noble, and\r\n    courageous speech that my thanks will hardly reach your ear;\r\n    yet I must thank you for my own sake. Our family here spent the\r\n    last three evenings in reading it out aloud, my son Henry being\r\n    the reader, and you ought to know how sure we are now that you\r\n    _are_ well, and how thankful we are for it, and how much good\r\n    this greatest of all your efforts will do.”\r\n\r\nDaniel L. Eaton, journalist, wrote from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania:--\r\n\r\n    “You must permit me, a perfect stranger, to express my cordial\r\n    thanks to you for the noble, scathing speech on the ‘sum of\r\n    villanies’ with which you enriched our literature on Monday\r\n    last in the Senate. This contest is no holiday battle, but the\r\n    irrepressible conflict between Right and Wrong. I thank my\r\n    God that he has spared your life to tell the world that the\r\n    bludgeon of Barbarism did not silence your tongue nor subdue\r\n    your spirit. ‘Let the Heathen rage.’ Behind you stand a million\r\n    of your fellow-citizens in whose hearts your speech finds an\r\n    echo. After reading it through with scrupulous care, I could\r\n    not resist the impulse to tell you what I have.”\r\n\r\nThomas MacConnell, lawyer, wrote from Pittsburg:--\r\n\r\n    “I hold Slavery to be a curse and a disgrace to our country and\r\n    to mankind; and I rejoice to know that we have one man who is\r\n    not afraid to denounce it as such, in plain Anglo-Saxon, on the\r\n    floor of the Senate, and in the face of the Slaveholders.”\r\n\r\nC. B. M. Smith, another lawyer, wrote from Pittsburg:--\r\n\r\n    “Will you permit a private in the Republican ranks to thank you\r\n    for your great speech on the Barbarism of Slavery? I do not\r\n    believe that it was ill-timed, or too severe. It was just what\r\n    the occasion and the times called for.”\r\n\r\nRev. N. Warren Everett wrote from Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania:--\r\n\r\n    “I have just been reading your masterly and unanswerable speech\r\n    of the fourth instant with thrills of delight. Massachusetts\r\n    can afford to let one of her Senatorial chairs remain vacant,\r\n    if we can have such a speech as that once in four years. I feel\r\n    like thanking God from the bottom of my heart that you have\r\n    been restored to health, and have the nerve, or, as you once\r\n    expressed yourself, the ‘backbone,’ to stand as one of God’s\r\n    noblemen and give utterance to truth.”\r\n\r\nEdward Corner wrote from Columbus, Ohio:--\r\n\r\n    “It is worth its bulk in gold. I honor the heart and give large\r\n    credit to the head that combined to send forth such a document.\r\n    If it could but reach the eyes and ears of the South generally,\r\n    it would tell upon even that dark and ignorant people; but it\r\n    cannot; a few may see it. There is not brass enough, nor yet\r\n    iron, nor steel, in the Southern Senators to ward off such a\r\n    blow. They will never forget it. There are some weak-kneed\r\n    Republicans who wish the speech had been less severe. I believe\r\n    in the entire speech. As you undertook to give the truth, why\r\n    not tell the whole truth? It is time they were exposed; it is\r\n    time to hold up Slavery’s mirror, not only to the South, but\r\n    before the world.”\r\n\r\nAlanson St. Clair wrote from Muskegon, Michigan:--\r\n\r\n    “And if my memory is not greatly at fault, you are the first\r\n    Member of Congress who has entered the penetralia of the\r\n    Pandemonium, and fully exposed the diabolical character of the\r\n    system, and the true character of its supporters. Such efforts\r\n    are telling.\r\n\r\n    “The efforts of many noble patriots have been manly,\r\n    self-denying, and praiseworthy, and should not be disparaged;\r\n    and yet I know of no one who has taken the high moral ground\r\n    on this subject which you have from the first. This, during\r\n    your whole Senatorial career, has made you the hope of the\r\n    reliable Antislavery men in America; and your last effort will\r\n    increase not a little their reliance on and their affection for\r\n    you. It is a godlike effort, a stunning blow, a blow in the\r\n    right direction and upon the right spot, which has inflicted a\r\n    fearful, if not a deadly wound.… I pray God that you may live,\r\n    and retain your place, to pronounce the funeral oration of\r\n    Slavery, and to receive the exultant blessings of the millions\r\n    to be set free.”\r\n\r\nNathan C. Meeker wrote from Dongola, Illinois:--\r\n\r\n    “Notwithstanding what Mr. Greeley said as to its not being\r\n    proper at this time, I think it timely, and that Mr. Greeley\r\n    is not aware of the great prevalence of Antislavery sentiment,\r\n    although he as much as any one has contributed to create it. I\r\n    thank you for the bold words, and also for the pleasure I have\r\n    received in reading a correct performance, since there are so\r\n    many which are hard for me to read. I think your speech will\r\n    long be referred to, as embracing all that has been and well\r\n    can be said on this question, and forever cause men to wonder\r\n    why it was listened to in silence.”\r\n\r\nHorace White, the able journalist, afterwards editor of the _Chicago\r\nTribune_, wrote from Chicago:--\r\n\r\n    “I take pleasure in saying that in my opinion your recent\r\n    effort ranks with Demosthenes on the Crown, and with Burke on\r\n    Warren Hastings.”\r\n\r\nJohn H. Rolfe wrote from Chicago:--\r\n\r\n    “Nobly and well have you met the expectations of those who,\r\n    like myself, have waited through four years of silence for your\r\n    next utterance on the great sin of our times. Highly as I prize\r\n    the speech, I think your brief and pointed reply to Senator\r\n    Chesnut fully doubles its value, for all practical purposes.”\r\n\r\nW. H. Herndon, the able lawyer, associated in business with Abraham\r\nLincoln, wrote from Springfield, Illinois:--\r\n\r\n    “I have received and read your most philosophic, logical, and\r\n    classical speech, made in the Senate of the United States. The\r\n    speech is a withering one to Slavery. It is worthy of you, and\r\n    you of it. I thank you very, _very_ much for it.… We feel well\r\n    out here; are confident of success. We hope the East will do as\r\n    well as the West.”\r\n\r\nS. M. Booth, journalist, who, spurning the Fugitive Slave Act, helped\r\nfugitive slaves, and was sentenced to imprisonment, wrote from “U. S.\r\nCustom-House Prison” at Milwaukee:--\r\n\r\n    “I bless God for the utterance. It is timely and needed at this\r\n    juncture. I have no sympathy with that craven policy which\r\n    would suppress such a speech, lest it might prejudice the\r\n    rights of Kansas or endanger the election of Lincoln.… Your\r\n    portrait of Slavery is true; its character and effects are all\r\n    you describe it; and the nation needs to have its own sin and\r\n    shame mirrored as you have done it. I see, too, the assassins\r\n    have since sought your life.… You have struck a mighty blow\r\n    at the very _existence_ of Slavery. You have laid the axe at\r\n    the root of the tree. We never can reach the evil as long as\r\n    we fight on the defensive. But if the doctrines of your speech\r\n    are true, it is no longer a question _where_ or _how far_\r\n    Slavery shall go, but whether it shall be allowed to go or to\r\n    be _anywhere_.… In God’s name let it perish, and the sooner the\r\n    better.”\r\n\r\nHon. A. A. Sargent, delegate from California to the Chicago Convention\r\nwhich nominated Abraham Lincoln as President, and afterwards\r\nRepresentative in Congress from California, wrote from Newburyport,\r\nMassachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “You go back of mere political distinctions to lay bare the sin\r\n    and barbarousness of a hoary iniquity, falsely assuming to be a\r\n    form of Civilization. You have taken up a train of thought, and\r\n    pursued it well, which I have long wished to have developed,\r\n    and filled a void in the system of declared truths upon which\r\n    Republicanism is based, too long neglected. Your speech stirred\r\n    my heart with feelings of pride for the representative of my\r\n    native State.”\r\n\r\nHon. Neal Dow, eminent in the cause of Temperance, and afterwards a\r\ngeneral in the War, wrote from Portland, Maine:--\r\n\r\n    “You will be glad to know that among all thoughtful men of our\r\n    side your speech is commended without a qualification. There\r\n    is no sympathy with the cowardice of the mere politicians, in\r\n    the fear that it may excite the bad passions of the South, and\r\n    provoke them to do some dreadful thing. I think the general\r\n    wish is that _the whole truth_ should be boldly spoken, and\r\n    that the crisis, whatever it may be, may come soon. The\r\n    indications now are that the South will have an opportunity to\r\n    make up its mind what it will do about it.”\r\n\r\nJohn Neal, the veteran of American literature, wrote from the same\r\ncity:--\r\n\r\n    “I have just finished the reading of your great and conclusive\r\n    speech upon the ‘Barbarism of Slavery,’ and I have only to say\r\n    that I go with you heart and soul, and that I concur entirely\r\n    in the opinion expressed by the venerable Josiah Quincy of your\r\n    argument.\r\n\r\n    “Your manliness, your Christian forbearance, your plainness\r\n    of speech, and your unexaggerating truthfulness are all of a\r\n    piece, and I desire to thank you in the name of this whole\r\n    generation for what you have done and suffered and said.”\r\n\r\nHon. James S. Pike, also of Maine, for many years a journalist,\r\nafterwards Minister of the United States at The Hague, wrote from Cape\r\nMay:--\r\n\r\n    “I think you have got hold of a heavy sledge, and hit between\r\n    the horns at every lick. The style of treatment will do as much\r\n    towards bringing the beast upon his knees as any other, and the\r\n    duty is peculiarly appropriate at your hands. I am very sure\r\n    you are right, and feel prompted to say so.”\r\n\r\nHon. John Appleton, the learned jurist, and Chief Justice of Maine,\r\nwrote from Bangor:--\r\n\r\n    “I owe you thanks for your able and unanswerable speech, which\r\n    came in my absence. More truth was never condensed in one\r\n    speech. But woe to those by whom it so becomes the truth!”\r\n\r\nHon. Moses Emery, an eminent citizen, wrote from Saco, Maine:--\r\n\r\n    “Permit me to say I have read it through twice, and parts of\r\n    it many times, and that I consider it the most glorious and\r\n    most needed speech ever made in the United States. I rejoice\r\n    that you have been spared to make it. But be on your guard. The\r\n    Demon of Slavery will be revenged, if possible.”\r\n\r\nThomas H. Talbot, a lawyer, who argued well against the Fugitive Slave\r\nAct, wrote from Portland, Maine:--\r\n\r\n    “I rejoice at your determination to tell the whole truth,\r\n    so much needed now, when many acting with you either do not\r\n    perceive it or are willing to withhold it, for reasons of\r\n    false, fleeting policy. So far you seem not seriously to have\r\n    been molested; and yet that you have really achieved freedom of\r\n    speech in Washington upon that subject, and to the extent of\r\n    your speech, seems almost too much to hope for at present.”\r\n\r\nHon. Woodbury Davis, an earnest Republican, afterwards Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of Maine, wrote from Portland:--\r\n\r\n    “Your friends here were alarmed on Sunday evening by a rumor\r\n    that you had been attacked again by Southern ruffians. I felt\r\n    thankful yesterday morning, when the despatches were published,\r\n    to learn that it was no worse. I do not believe there is\r\n    another man in the world for whose personal safety so much real\r\n    prayer ascends to Heaven.…\r\n\r\n    “Allow me, as one of the people, though not one of your\r\n    immediate constituents, to thank you for your great speech. In\r\n    these times, when there is a tendency to _let down_ the great\r\n    principles of Universal Liberty in order to gain a temporary\r\n    triumph, it was so refreshing to have them so nobly and\r\n    faithfully advocated in the great forum of the nation, that\r\n    I felt truly grateful to you, and to Him who has preserved\r\n    you for such a service. If Slavery is to be restricted, it\r\n    is because of its own inherent wrong, _wheresoever_ and upon\r\n    _whomsoever_ it rests. And if wrong, we are bound not only to\r\n    resist its extension, but by whatever powers we have to seek\r\n    its extinction.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Benjamin Silliman, distinguished in science and venerable in\r\nyears, wrote from Yale College:--\r\n\r\n    “It is a terrible indictment, and supported by such an array\r\n    of facts, that, having now gone to the jury, there can be no\r\n    doubt as to the verdict, and a verdict without appeal, except\r\n    to violence,--against which, as regards yourself personally,\r\n    I trust you will exercise a ceaseless, although not a timid\r\n    vigilance.”\r\n\r\nCyrus R. Sanborn wrote from Rochester, New Hampshire:--\r\n\r\n    “After the many anxious inquiries during your long absence in a\r\n    foreign land, your return to the Senate has been a topic of not\r\n    much less interest. Upon the question often being asked, ‘Shall\r\n    we again hear from Mr. Sumner on the question of Slavery?’\r\n    as often it would be answered either in the affirmative or\r\n    negative. Not too late, just at _the_ time, you have answered\r\n    the whole question in your recent elaborate speech. Happy and\r\n    delighted are freemen that the bludgeon and threats have not\r\n    daunted your courage and freedom of speech upon the great\r\n    question of Slavery.”\r\n\r\nJohn A. Andrew, afterwards the great Governor of Massachusetts, wrote\r\nfrom Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “Among the numerous congratulatory letters which your recent\r\n    brilliant Senatorial effort is doubtless bringing to you, I\r\n    doubt not you will derive some pleasure in being remembered at\r\n    No. 4, Court Street.\r\n\r\n    “‘The Philosopher’[143] and myself, as you know, always read\r\n    you promptly and carefully. In this recent triumphant success\r\n    I recognize the ‘wonted fires’ which have now these dozen\r\n    years illumined our heavens. And I rejoice at the evidence of\r\n    confirmed physical vigor which is assured by your encounter of\r\n    the fatigues and excitement of such an intellectual exercise.\r\n    May you live a thousand years!”\r\n\r\nHon. Francis W. Bird, one of the ablest and honestest politicians\r\nin Massachusetts, for many years an Abolitionist, and of peculiar\r\ninfluence, wrote from East Walpole:--\r\n\r\n    “You do not need that I should thank you for your speech. I\r\n    confess I considered the risk to your health and life so great\r\n    that I hoped you would keep silent. But I thank God you have\r\n    gone through it, for now we may rest assured your health is\r\n    established. But how I dreaded the test! I rejoice especially\r\n    that you have placed yourself where the next step logically is,\r\n    Slavery has no rights, no recognition (except as an existing\r\n    fact), and no political existence under the Constitution. Then\r\n    comes the end. And you are to be the leader in that final\r\n    fight.”\r\n\r\nGeorge L. Stearns, so faithful as Abolitionist, who did so much for the\r\norganization of colored troops during the War, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “I cannot wait until I have finished your speech to tell you\r\n    how perfectly it meets my most sanguine expectations. It is\r\n    the morning star that heralds the coming day when the vile\r\n    institution shall only live in the history of the Past. Your\r\n    word will become the battle-cry in the coming conflict, showing\r\n    that it is indeed irrepressible, and will not be put down, even\r\n    when the leaders in the fight fall back in terror.”\r\n\r\nHon. James M. Stone, afterwards Speaker of the Massachusetts House of\r\nRepresentatives, and a reformer, wrote from Charlestown:--\r\n\r\n    “I am delighted with your admirable speech on the ‘Barbarism\r\n    of Slavery,’ and I desire to unite with the millions of the\r\n    freemen of the country in tendering you thanks for this effort\r\n    to arouse the attention of the people to the terrible evils of\r\n    Slavery. The power of your facts and logic is unanswerable and\r\n    irresistible. The speech comes just at the right time, too;\r\n    for there was great danger of too much forgetfulness of the\r\n    great fundamental principle of Human Freedom, without which the\r\n    Republican party would never have obtained its present power\r\n    and prospects for the future, and without which it will surely\r\n    and speedily go to destruction.”\r\n\r\nWilliam I. Bowditch, the well-known conveyancer, and among the\r\nstrictest of Abolitionists, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “As to the speech, the more I think of it, the heavier I think\r\n    the blow was which you have given. And I am glad to find you\r\n    yourself again.”\r\n\r\nNathaniel I. Bowditch, author, as well as eminent conveyancer,\r\nremarkable also for goodness and moral principle, wrote from\r\nBrookline:--\r\n\r\n    “I had not the least conception of the immense differences\r\n    effected by Freedom and Slavery. Your statistics were truly\r\n    astonishing. Some of my visitors, friendly in the main to\r\n    the Republican cause, have expressed their doubts as to the\r\n    expediency of your speech,--considering that its effect must\r\n    be to exasperate the slaveholders; but when I find that Bell,\r\n    nominated by the Union party, actually eulogized Slavery as\r\n    the corner-stone of the material prosperity of the country,\r\n    I think that it is well that the true picture should be held\r\n    up to their inspection, however repulsive it may be. As in\r\n    some homely picture of the Dutch school, such as that of _The\r\n    Dentist pulling out a Tooth_, the subject may be distasteful,\r\n    but all must acknowledge the skill of the artist, so I think\r\n    no one can deny the thoroughness of your researches or the\r\n    ability with which you have presented their results. Even your\r\n    opponents cannot fail to acknowledge the manly and fearless\r\n    tone of your remarks.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Livermore, a Boston merchant, who loved books, and was always\r\ntrue to his convictions, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n     “I have waited almost a fortnight since the first reading\r\n    of your speech, and have read it again and again, before\r\n    saying anything about it. I have heard the various remarks of\r\n    many persons whom I have met, and have read the contradictory\r\n    criticisms of politicians, philanthropists, and religionists.\r\n    But the first thoughts and the first impressions on reading the\r\n    speech have been strengthened by reflection. I could then find\r\n    no words of my own so suitable to express my views respecting\r\n    it as the words of the wise man of Israel, and I said more\r\n    than once to my nearest friends, ‘Here are _apples of gold in\r\n    pictures of silver_.’ For if ever words were _fitly spoken_, it\r\n    was when you so bravely, truly, and eloquently lifted up your\r\n    voice in the Senate, and shamed the ‘Barbarism of Slavery.’ I\r\n    thank you for it.”\r\n\r\nCharles W. Slack, able editor, and ever earnest against Slavery, wrote\r\nfrom Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “If the truth must be suppressed, if every honest aspiration\r\n    must be crushed, if everything manly and heroic is to be tamed\r\n    down, to win a Presidential contest, better be without the\r\n    success, I say, than purchase it at such a sacrifice. Again I\r\n    thank you, over and over again.\r\n\r\n    “Let me say that I know the newspapers don’t represent the\r\n    current tone of the Republicans in this community, even where\r\n    bold and brave utterances heretofore have not been popular.”\r\n\r\nWilliam S. Robinson, for many years Clerk of the Massachusetts House\r\nof Representatives, and able journalist, who uttered what he thought,\r\nwrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “I suppose that you are not disappointed that timid\r\n    Republicanism in some quarters objects to the time and occasion\r\n    of your speech. Of course its real objection is to the speech\r\n    itself. But I assure you that the Antislavery men gladly\r\n    welcome it. I regard it as your best speech, and as calculated\r\n    to do immense good.”\r\n\r\nJ. P. Blanchard, clear-headed, and vowed against Slavery and War, wrote\r\nfrom Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “I need hardly say that I share in the high admiration and\r\n    satisfaction with which it is received by all intelligent\r\n    persons here, except those few who have sold their souls for\r\n    office, or who have not yet awoke from the political sleep of\r\n    half a century. I esteem it especially, not so much for its\r\n    great research and ability, which were expected, as because it\r\n    discusses the true fundamental question of the wrong as well as\r\n    evil of holding property in man, which, though the real issue\r\n    between the parties, has hitherto been too much slurred over on\r\n    both sides.”\r\n\r\nSeth Webb, Jr., appointed by President Lincoln Consul at\r\nPort-au-Prince, Hayti, a Republican of the best quality, and always\r\nAntislavery, wrote from his home in Scituate, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I have read it with care. It is magnificent, and I am glad on\r\n    every account that it was made. It was all needed,--needed now\r\n    and from you. It not only expresses my own opinions fully, but\r\n    in it you have written on the walls of Eternity the adamantine\r\n    convictions of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n    “That there are some timeserving and tremulous men and presses\r\n    in our ranks who treat the speech coolly only shows that\r\n    Republican leaders do not understand Republicanism, and that it\r\n    is a mighty work to regenerate a nation.\r\n\r\n    “The strength of the Republican party lies in the fearless\r\n    utterance of its opinions; its weakness, in the suppression of\r\n    them. A timid policy will be our ruin; a bold one wins friends\r\n    and awes enemies.”\r\n\r\nHon. Amasa Walker, afterwards Representative in Congress, writer on\r\nCurrency and Political Economy, and enlisted against Slavery and War,\r\nwrote from his home at North Brookfield, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I do think it excellent and well-timed, just what you ought to\r\n    say, and no more,--but what no other man in the Senate would\r\n    have dared to say.”\r\n\r\nHon. Willard Phillips, for many years Judge of Probate in Boston,\r\nand author of the excellent work on the Law of Insurance, wrote from\r\nBoston:--\r\n\r\n    “I was not a little chagrined and mortified by ----’s notice\r\n    of it, as I expressed to him in a note the moment I had read\r\n    his leader respecting it. Brutality, no less than vice, is a\r\n    monster, and whoever paints it fair, or wishes others to, by\r\n    the false character he gives betrays his own true character.\r\n    I have great faith in plain-spoken truth; and the railing and\r\n    gnashing of teeth in anger by the Southern preservers of the\r\n    Union, and what John Randolph denominated as the white slaves\r\n    of the North, who second them, is a plain confession of the\r\n    truth as you have spoken it.”\r\n\r\nHon. Albert G. Browne, prominent in the politics of Massachusetts, and\r\never foe to Slavery, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “No poor words of mine can convey to you my admiration and\r\n    hearty approbation of your speech. I greatly err in judgment,\r\n    if it is not by universal consent considered your best effort\r\n    in this direction. To my mind it is exhaustive of the subject.”\r\n\r\nDaniel Henshaw, a venerable citizen, once a journalist and always a\r\nreformer, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “I have read your speech on the Barbarism of Slavery\r\n    attentively, having devoted seven hours thereto yesterday, and\r\n    I cannot refrain from offering you my humble thanks, although\r\n    words cannot express my feelings on the subject. You know\r\n    something of my views on Slavery. For thirty years I have\r\n    considered it the leading and most important subject before the\r\n    nation.”\r\n\r\nCharles M. Ellis, the lawyer, and always against Slavery, wrote from\r\nBoston:--\r\n\r\n    “Especially allow me to thank you for the discourse of the\r\n    Barbarism of Slavery; for it shows you _well_ again, and\r\n    leading on the good fight. It is needed now, when men at the\r\n    South seek to justify the thing,--needed, I think, more than\r\n    anything,--and leaves little to be done in that direction.”\r\n\r\nWarren Sawyer, a merchant and active Republican, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “I have looked over the newspaper reports, and have thanked God\r\n    your life was spared to prepare such a masterly production, so\r\n    full of facts, so happily arranged, so glowingly knit together,\r\n    and that you were able in strength to stand up in the Senate\r\n    and deliver it.\r\n\r\n    “To my mind, the speech will do much good; it was needed. The\r\n    great mass of the people have become, or are becoming, what is\r\n    now called conservative on the Slavery Question; they forget,\r\n    amid their business and their many calls, the horrors, the\r\n    crime, and the Barbarism of Slavery.”\r\n\r\nC. J. Higginson, a merchant, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “Notwithstanding all that has been said and written on\r\n    Slavery, I think you have first perceived and expressed this\r\n    ‘unconsciousness’ of slaveholders; and the additional fact of\r\n    this unconsciousness being nearly as general at the North as\r\n    South explains the necessity of proving at this late day, even\r\n    to us of the North, the Barbarism of Slavery. We thought their\r\n    wealth and leisure led them to be generous; nobody has ever so\r\n    plainly shown their accepted necessity of meanness. We have\r\n    been unconscious of their influence in lowering our standing.…\r\n    I only wish to express my satisfaction at finding Massachusetts\r\n    again represented by a man with a constitution, so valuable in\r\n    the latitude of Washington, capable of standing the burning\r\n    heat of the South and the chilliness of the North.”\r\n\r\nHon. J. Q. A. Griffin, the lawyer and earnest Republican, too early\r\nremoved from life, wrote from Charlestown:--\r\n\r\n    “I must thank you for the great gratification I felt in the\r\n    perusal of your great speech. Twice I have read the whole of\r\n    it, and many times more various parts. It is small praise to\r\n    say, what is here on all lips, that it evinces marvellous\r\n    scholarship, and embraces a sternly logical statement of the\r\n    whole question between Freedom and Slavery. Its amazing courage\r\n    and justice will commend it yet more to the thinking men of\r\n    this and all other countries.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Baty Blake, the banker, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “Its unanswerable arguments will stand forever as monuments\r\n    of manly effort in behalf of an oppressed race,--defending\r\n    principles, too, which ought to be approved by every Christian\r\n    man.”\r\n\r\nA practical Republican, very active in the party, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n     “I have read your splendid speech, and find that I cannot\r\n    express in words or with pen my admiration of it. It is one of\r\n    _your_ efforts, the results of which will undoubtedly place our\r\n    great party one more pace onward, as in every case of the past\r\n    you have done. In my opinion it was needed at this time; and\r\n    as I have been something of a prophet in days past, perhaps my\r\n    sanction may give you courage.”\r\n\r\nA considerable number of constituents at Boston, among whom were James\r\nRedpath, Richard J. Hinton, and Loring Moody, friends of Kansas, and\r\nAbolitionists, forwarded the following address, signed by them:--\r\n\r\n    “Jointly and severally, as men and as citizens, we say, God\r\n    bless you, Charles Sumner! Thank God for one man whom no\r\n    Barbarism frightens, whom no pusillanimous policy deters from\r\n    uttering the truth! Thank Heaven that in our modern Sodom one\r\n    just man and fearless was found, who, in the face of despots,\r\n    has dared to plead the cause of their victims, and to brand\r\n    their tyranny with the titles it has won!\r\n\r\n    “Go on,--with God, and the slave, and all good men applauding\r\n    you. Victory is inevitable, and near at hand.\r\n\r\n    “With gratitude and love and admiration, your friends,\r\n    constituents, and fellow-citizens.”\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Sargent, the eminent surgeon and strong Republican, wrote\r\nfrom Worcester, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “When I first read your speech, as I did immediately after\r\n    its delivery, my blood boiled anew, as after the outrage\r\n    which our country’s Barbarism inflicted on you four years\r\n    ago. God has punished that crime, in the persons of its more\r\n    immediate perpetrators, in his own way. Your speech is the apt\r\n    and condign punishment of that portion of the community who\r\n    supported them. In its learning, its truth, and its eloquence,\r\n    it is worthy of you; while in its comprehensiveness, its\r\n    compactness, and its completeness, it has exhausted the whole\r\n    subject. If you never say a word more, your record will be\r\n    right, and may God bless you!”\r\n\r\nHon. James H. Morton, holding a judicial situation, wrote from\r\nSpringfield, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I have long been expecting to hear from you in your regaining\r\n    health, and my expectation has been fully realized in the\r\n    noble, scorching, withering expression of the true sentiment\r\n    of Massachusetts on this subject. Would to God that every\r\n    man who entertains the sentiments contained in your speech,\r\n    whether of the North or South, had the moral courage boldly to\r\n    express them! We should soon see an end of that accursed thing,\r\n    Slavery.”\r\n\r\nHon. D. W. Alvord, lawyer and warm Republican, wrote from Greenfield,\r\nMassachusetts:--\r\n\r\n     “I write to thank you for your recent speech. There is not\r\n    elsewhere in the English language so powerful an argument on\r\n    the Barbarism of Slavery. In my opinion it is just such a\r\n    speech as you were bound to make,--just such a speech as the\r\n    honor of Massachusetts required from you. It is such a speech\r\n    as few men living but you could make. Hurt the Republican\r\n    party, will it? If it will, then the party does not deserve\r\n    success.”\r\n\r\nHumphrey Stevens, Register of Deeds for Franklin County, Massachusetts,\r\nwrote from Greenfield:--\r\n\r\n    “I have just read your speech on the Barbarism of Slavery. God\r\n    be praised that you did not compromise, and that the prayers\r\n    of the good have been answered! Some Republicans may condemn,\r\n    but hosts will rejoice that you regard the cause more than\r\n    Republicanism.”\r\n\r\nRev. William S. Tyler, the learned Greek Professor, wrote from\r\nAmherst:--\r\n\r\n    “I cannot refrain from expressing to you the deep, though in\r\n    some respects painful, interest with which I have read your\r\n    late speech in the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n    “That your life has been spared, your health in such a measure\r\n    restored, and that you were able to begin ‘where you left\r\n    off,’ and finish such a faithful and complete exposition\r\n    of the monstrous Barbarism--that is the word--of American\r\n    Slavery, is just matter of congratulation to the country, and\r\n    of thanksgiving to God. The enemies of Freedom and Humanity\r\n    will of course gnash their teeth upon you, and timid friends\r\n    will question the expediency of such a speech; but when the\r\n    passions and prejudices of the hour have passed away, it will\r\n    be remembered and honored as one of the truest, greatest, best\r\n    utterances of our age.”\r\n\r\nHon. Henry Hubbard, the agent of Massachusetts to visit New Orleans in\r\nbehalf of colored seamen imprisoned there, wrote from Pittsfield:--\r\n\r\n    “I cannot, even at the hazard of offending you, refrain from\r\n    expressing the sense of honor and gratitude I feel for your\r\n    sending me your immortal and all-conquering speech on the\r\n    Kansas Question, showing and proving the unmitigated atrocity\r\n    and monstrous deformity of Slavery, maintained in many States\r\n    of this confederacy, and threatening all the rest. Boldly,\r\n    manfully, faithfully you have ‘done the austere work,’ not\r\n    letting, by your laches, ‘Freedom fling away any of her\r\n    weapons.’ Oh, no! Freedom stood in all her majesty, and used\r\n    all her weapons.”\r\n\r\nHenry D. Thoreau, author and man of genius, wrote from Concord,\r\nMassachusetts:--\r\n\r\n     “Especially I wish to thank you for your speech on the\r\n    Barbarism of Slavery, which I hope and suspect commences a new\r\n    era in the history of our Congress, when questions of national\r\n    importance have come to be considered from a broadly ethical,\r\n    and not from a narrowly political point of view alone. It\r\n    is refreshing to hear some naked truth, moral or otherwise,\r\n    uttered there, which can always take care of itself, when\r\n    uttered, and of course belongs to no party. (That was the\r\n    whole value of Gerrit Smith’s presence there, methinks, though\r\n    he did go to bed early.) Whereas this has only been employed\r\n    occasionally to perfume the wheel-grease of party or national\r\n    politics.”\r\n\r\nFrank B. Sanborn, teacher and earnest man, afterwards an able\r\njournalist, wrote from Concord:--\r\n\r\n    “Whatever politicians and editors may say, or even think, you\r\n    have more endeared yourself to the popular heart by your labors\r\n    in the last Session than by all that you have previously done.\r\n    Neither the North nor the South can soon forget the faithful\r\n    picture held up before us in your speeches.”\r\n\r\nMiles Pratt, a business man and active Republican, of Watertown,\r\nMassachusetts, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “I am sure I express the sentiments of nine tenths of the\r\n    Republicans of this town, when I say that your speech is\r\n    received with joy by us all. Strange that such papers as the\r\n    _Tribune_ can wish that it had been made at some other time!\r\n    We don’t want victory, if at such sacrifice as the _Tribune_\r\n    proposes. Let me assure you that such sentiments as you have\r\n    uttered are what keep very many men in the Republican ranks.”\r\n\r\nE. P. Hill, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “Allow me to congratulate you upon the delivery of one of the\r\n    most effective speeches upon the great question of the age that\r\n    have ever been given to the American people. I rejoice most\r\n    heartily that the facts and sentiments it contains have found\r\n    a timely utterance, and it is safe to predict for it a decided\r\n    effect upon the moral sense of the whole world.”\r\n\r\nP. L. Page wrote from Pittsfield, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I have just read your speech, ‘The Barbarism of Slavery,’ and,\r\n    notwithstanding the opinions of some politicians, am glad you\r\n    have delivered it just as it is. It is terrible, but truthful.\r\n    I think it will do good. While there is immense sympathy\r\n    for the Republican party, as a party, there is too little\r\n    sympathy for the Slave, and too little indignation against that\r\n    abominable system by which he is held in bondage. The tendency\r\n    of that speech is to show that it is not this or that measure\r\n    merely we have to contend with, but the monster Slavery.”\r\n\r\nAndrew L. Russell, an excellent citizen, of Pilgrim stock, and an early\r\nAbolitionist, wrote from Plymouth, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I have just read your speech with great interest, and thank\r\n    you for it. It is just the thing, manly and conclusive. I\r\n    hope in all the copies of your speech Mr. Chesnut’s beautiful\r\n    specimen of Southern Chivalry manners will be printed, with\r\n    your rejoinder.\r\n\r\n    “We must be bold and determined now, and the victory is sure.\r\n    The ravings of the Oligarchy show that they are wounded.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Lydia Maria Child, of beautiful genius, and equal devotion to the\r\ncause, wrote from Wayland, Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n    “I presume you were not disappointed that so many Republican\r\n    editors pronounced your speech injudicious, ill-timed, etc.\r\n    I was not surprised, though I confess I did expect something\r\n    better from the _New York Evening Post_. Honest utterance\r\n    generally frightens or offends the wise and prudent; but it\r\n    gains the popular heart, and thus renders political parties\r\n    the greatest service, though it is one they least know how to\r\n    appreciate. They themselves are also carried onward by such\r\n    agencies, as certainly as cars follow the engine.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom representative colored men similar testimony proceeded. That of\r\nFrederick Douglass has been given already. Robert Morris, the colored\r\nlawyer, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “In behalf of the colored young men of Boston, and following\r\n    the dictates of my own heart, I write to thank you for the\r\n    speech you have just made in exposition of the Barbarism of\r\n    Slavery.…\r\n\r\n    “In battle, when a bombshell is thrown into the camp of the\r\n    enemy, if it creates consternation and surprise, rest assured\r\n    it has been thrown successfully, and done good service. So your\r\n    speech, every word of which is truthful, fearlessly spoken\r\n    to the guilty parties in the iniquitous system of Slavery,\r\n    was properly directed, and has done good service, as is fully\r\n    demonstrated by the renewed attempts on the part of the\r\n    Southerners to assault you again and silence your voice.”\r\n\r\nJohn S. Rock, also a colored lawyer, afterwards, on motion of Mr.\r\nSumner, admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nwrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “Your immortal speech has sent a thrill of joy to all the\r\n    lovers of Freedom everywhere, and especially so to the\r\n    down-trodden. We feel the value of it the more since the\r\n    Republican party appears determined to treat us in the spirit\r\n    of the Dred Scott decision.”\r\n\r\nJ. B. Smith, colored, of New Bedford, wrote from Boston:--\r\n\r\n    “Permit me, as a citizen of your native State, and especially\r\n    as a colored man, who has faithfully devoted more than twenty\r\n    years of his brief life to the elevation of his race, most\r\n    sincerely and heartily to thank you for your very masterly\r\n    speech in exposition of the monstrous iniquity of American\r\n    Slavery. I can assure you that the gratitude of the colored\r\n    people of this country towards you, who so eminently deserve\r\n    it, is incalculable.”\r\n\r\nEbenezer D. Bassett, a colored professor, afterwards Minister at Hayti,\r\nwrote from Philadelphia:--\r\n\r\n    “The speech, which I read in the _Herald_, is, it seems to\r\n    me, unequalled by anything in the oratory of modern times,\r\n    and I venture to predict that future ages will place it, as a\r\n    work of art, side by side with the matchless _De Corona_ of\r\n    Demosthenes. It is certainly beyond all praise.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Still, colored, and with the natural sentiments of his race,\r\nwrote from Philadelphia:--\r\n\r\n    “In my humble opinion, you have so effectually laid the axe at\r\n    the root of the tree that thousands and tens of thousands who\r\n    have been indifferent or Proslavery will henceforth work for\r\n    the deliverance of the bondman,--will labor to help cut the\r\n    tree down. Thus I am greatly encouraged, and devoutly hope and\r\n    pray for a better day for my race soon.”\r\n\r\nRobert Purvis, an accomplished gentleman, connected by blood with the\r\ncolored race, wrote from his home at Byberry, near Philadelphia:--\r\n\r\n    “Permit me, out of the fulness of my heart, to make to you my\r\n    grateful acknowledgments for the most powerfully effective\r\n    speech, in my humble opinion, against the ‘Barbarism of\r\n    Slavery,’ ever made in this or any other country. Its\r\n    _timeliness_, as well as its vital power, stirs within me\r\n    the deepest emotions, which, indeed, are poorly expressed in\r\n    subscribing myself as being your grateful and admiring friend\r\n    and obedient servant.”\r\n\r\nH. O. Wagoner testifies to the sentiments of the colored people of\r\nIllinois, in a letter from Chicago:--\r\n\r\n    “For the great words you have spoken, and the ever-memorable\r\n    services which you have just rendered in the Senate of the\r\n    United States to the cause of my enslaved and down-trodden\r\n    fellow-countrymen, I return you not only my own individual\r\n    heartfelt thanks, but I venture to speak in the name and in the\r\n    behalf of the seven or eight thousand colored people of the\r\n    State of Illinois.… Could the poor slave but know the substance\r\n    of that speech, the circumstances under which it was given, in\r\n    the very face of the Slave Power,--I say could the slaves be\r\n    made to comprehend fully all this, it would thrill their very\r\n    souls with emotions of joy unspeakable.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis collection, which might be extended, is concluded with a voice\r\nfrom the Land of Slavery. J. R. S. Van Vleet wrote from Richmond:--\r\n\r\n    “As a citizen of the ‘Old Dominion,’ and a hater of Slavery, I\r\n    hereby send to you my unqualified approbation of your manly,\r\n    bold, eloquent, and truthful exposition of the great crime\r\n    of our common country; and let this come to you as from the\r\n    slave-pens of Richmond, in the midst of which these lines are\r\n    secretly written, and within which hundreds of human hearts\r\n    this moment feel the crushing weight of the ‘Barbarism’ you\r\n    have so faithfully illustrated. If these poor slaves were\r\n    permitted to give you thanks, their dark and gloomy prisons\r\n    for once would be made vocal with praise, and their tears of\r\n    sorrowing and bitterness be changed to tears of joy.\r\n\r\n    “If you knew the deep and secret interest which these people\r\n    take in the great battle now waging, you would be stimulated in\r\n    your efforts to hasten the day when we white men of Virginia\r\n    could unite with the colored slave to celebrate our common\r\n    emancipation.…\r\n\r\n    “Some of the Northern Republicans affect to think that your\r\n    speech was ill-timed; but I think it was just in time, and not\r\n    a moment too soon. The Southern party demand that the area of\r\n    Slavery shall be extended,--that the system shall be protected\r\n    by Congressional legislation backed by the whole power of the\r\n    Government; is it not, therefore, right and proper that the\r\n    people of the Free States should know what that system is which\r\n    they are required to perpetuate and protect? You have torn off\r\n    its mask and exhibited to them its hideous features, and now\r\n    let them say whether they will crush it beneath their feet, or\r\n    foster, caress, and protect it.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Rabé, Secretary of the Republican Central Committee of\r\nCalifornia, wrote from San Francisco:--\r\n\r\n    “We have republished your speech.… I have the honor to hail\r\n    from Mr. Chesnut’s State, but am extremely sorry to be obliged\r\n    to disagree with him, and to be obliged to indorse the\r\n    reasoning of your speech, notwithstanding, or, in fact, in\r\n    consequence of, my having been a planter in South Carolina for\r\n    years.… It may not be for me to eulogize you and your speeches;\r\n    but that you have created an enthusiasm and opened the door for\r\n    free talk on the subject of Slavery no one will deny, and the\r\n    effect has already been electric.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the press, and from correspondence, it is plain, that, whatever\r\nthe efforts or desires of politicians, the question of Slavery had\r\nreached a crisis. Nothing touched the universal heart so strongly, and\r\nthe interest extended abroad. For years the South had been growing\r\npassionate for this Barbarism, and determined on its extension. It\r\nnow appeared that in the North there was a passion the other way. The\r\nPresidential election turned on Slavery, and nothing else. The precise\r\npoint in issue was its limitation by preventing its spread into the\r\nTerritories; but this issue, even in its moderate form, involved the\r\nwhole character of Slavery, and the supremacy of the Slave Power in the\r\nNational Government.\r\n\r\nThe speeches during the canvass were on this issue. Politicians were\r\nswept into the irresistible current. This appeared in the pressure\r\nupon Mr. Sumner to speak. At the close of the session of Congress,\r\nonly a brief period after his exposure of the Barbarism of Slavery,\r\non the invitation of the Young Men’s Republican Union of New York, he\r\ndelivered an address at Cooper Institute, on “The Origin, Necessity,\r\nand Permanence of the Republican Party,” where he presented anew the\r\nargument against Slavery. This was followed by urgent requests to\r\nspeak in other places. Hon. Hannibal Hamlin, the Republican candidate\r\nfor Vice-President, wrote from Maine: “We want you much, very much.…\r\nWill you come? Don’t say, No.” Hon. William P. Fessenden, learning\r\nthat he was coming, wrote: “The news has rejoiced all our hearts.”\r\nHon. Neal Dow urged: “You may say _all_ that is in your heart, relying\r\n_fully_ upon the entire sympathy of the people.” And John A. Andrew,\r\nwho was visiting there, reported: “Your name will draw like a thousand\r\nelephants.” There were other States where there was similar urgency.\r\nA private letter from Thurlow Weed, at Albany, hoping it would be in\r\nMr. Sumner’s power to visit New York, was followed by a formal letter\r\nfrom the New York State Republican Central Committee, pressing him to\r\naddress the electors of this State, and saying: “The Committee are\r\nvery urgent in this request, and hope you will consent to speak for\r\nus as much as possible”; and this was followed by a special appeal\r\nfrom Simeon Draper, Chairman of the State Committee. A similar call,\r\nwith the same urgency, came from Illinois,--and here the agents were\r\nHon. Elihu B. Washburne, of the Republican Congressional Committee at\r\nWashington, and Hon. N. B. Judd, Chairman of the Illinois Republican\r\nState Committee. In pressing the invitation, the latter said: “We can\r\npromise you such welcome as Western Republicans can give to laborers in\r\nthe cause of Freedom”; and then again, in another letter: “The people\r\nexpect you, and know that no personal motive or interest induces you\r\nto come,--only a deep conviction of the necessity for the election\r\nof Mr. Lincoln, and the triumph of the principles of which he is the\r\nrepresentative.” Another ardent Republican wrote from Chicago: “A\r\nglorious reception is awaiting you.”\r\n\r\nDuring the canvass, Mr. Sumner spoke several times in Massachusetts,\r\ntreating different heads of the Great Question, as will appear in the\r\ncourse of this volume; but after his address at New York, he did not\r\nspeak out of his own State. The appeals from other States attest that\r\nhis method was not discarded by the people. As the Rebellion began to\r\nshow itself, the Barbarism of Slavery was more and more recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VICTORY OF PRINCIPLE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A PUBLIC MEETING AT MIDDLEBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS, JUNE 11,\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  SENATE CHAMBER, June 11, 1860.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--It would give me pleasure to mingle with my\r\n  fellow-citizens at Middleborough in pledges of earnest support\r\n  to our candidates recently nominated at Chicago, but duties here\r\n  will keep me away.\r\n\r\n  Be assured, however, of the sympathy, which I offer more freely\r\n  because I find in the Platform declarations full of glorious\r\n  promise. Our victory will be worth having, only as it is a\r\n  victory of principle; but such a victory I expect.\r\n\r\n  Because I believe that our candidates hate the _five-headed_\r\n  Barbarism of Slavery, and will set their faces against all its\r\n  irrational and unconstitutional pretensions, I am earnest for\r\n  their success.\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks for the honor of your invitation, and believe\r\n  me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  F. M. VAUGHAN, Esq., Secretary, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFUSAL TO COLORED PERSONS OF RIGHT OF PETITION.\r\n\r\nNOTES OF UNDELIVERED SPEECH IN THE SENATE, ON RESOLUTION REFUSING TO\r\nRECEIVE PETITION FROM CITIZENS OF MASSACHUSETTS OF AFRICAN DESCENT,\r\nJUNE 15, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    June 5, 1860, Mr. Sumner presented a petition of citizens\r\n    of Massachusetts, of African descent, praying the Senate\r\n    to suspend the labors of the Select Committee appointed to\r\n    investigate the facts of the late invasion and seizure of\r\n    public property at Harper’s Ferry, and that all persons now in\r\n    custody under the proceedings of such Committee be discharged,\r\n    which was duly referred to the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    June 15, Mr. Mason submitted a report from the Committee,\r\n    accompanied by the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n        “_Resolved_, That the paper purporting to be a petition\r\n        from ‘citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, of\r\n        African descent,’ presented to the Senate by Charles\r\n        Sumner, a Senator of Massachusetts, on the 5th of June,\r\n        instant, and on his motion referred to a Select Committee\r\n        of the Senate, be returned by the Secretary to the Senator\r\n        who presented it.”\r\n\r\n    This resolution was never called up for consideration, but it\r\n    stands on the Journal of the Senate in perpetual testimony of\r\n    the assumption of the Slave Power and its tyrannical hardihood.\r\n    Anticipating its discussion, Mr. Sumner prepared the notes of a\r\n    speech upon it, which are here preserved precisely as sketched\r\n    at the time.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to treat this proposition, proceeding from a Committee\r\nof the Senate, except as you would treat a direct proposition of\r\nAtheism. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God”; but it was\r\nonly in his heart; the fool in Scripture did not openly declare it.\r\nHad he openly declared it, he would have been in a position hardly more\r\noffensive than your Committee.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying of antiquity, which has the confirming voice of\r\nall intervening time, that “whom the gods would destroy they first\r\nmake mad.” And now, Sir, while humbled for my country that such a\r\nproposition should be introduced into the Senate, I accept it as the\r\nomen of that madness which precedes the fall of its authors.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the number of free persons, African by descent, in the\r\nUnited States, is almost half a million,--being a population two thirds\r\nlarger than the white population in South Carolina, more than one third\r\nlarger than the white population in Mississippi, and six times larger\r\nthan the white population in Florida. I mention these facts in order to\r\nshow at the outset the number of persons whose rights are now assailed.\r\n\r\nAlready, in several States, free negroes are threatened with expulsion,\r\nunder the terrible penalty of being sold into Slavery. The Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States has stepped forward, and by cruel decree\r\ndeclared that they are not citizens, and therefore are not entitled\r\nto sue in the courts of the United States. And now, to complete their\r\ndegradation and exclusion from all rights, it is proposed to declare\r\nthat their petitions cannot be received by the Senate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe right of petition is not _political_, but _personal_,--born with\r\nHumanity, and confirmed by Christianity,--belonging to all, but\r\npeculiar to the humble, the weak, and the oppressed. It belongs even to\r\nthe criminal; for it is simply the right to pray.\r\n\r\nThere is no country, professing civilization, where this right is not\r\nsacred. In Mahometan countries it is revered. One of the most touching\r\nstories of the East is where a petitioner in affliction came before the\r\nSultan, crying out,--\r\n\r\n              “‘My sorrow is my right,\r\n    And I _will_ see the Sultan, and to-night.’\r\n    ‘Sorrow,’ said Mahmoud, ‘is a reverend thing;\r\n    I recognize its right, as king with king:\r\n    Speak on.’”[144]\r\n\r\nTo take this right away from any portion of our _fellow-subjects_--even\r\nif you say they are not _fellow-citizens_--will be barbarous. And when\r\nI consider under what influence this proposition is brought forward, I\r\npresent it as a fresh illustration of the Barbarism of Slavery,--most\r\nbarbarous in the unconsciousness of its Barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe outrage is apparent from a simple statement.\r\n\r\nIn all the States--even in the Slave States--a free colored man may\r\nhold property of all kinds, personal or real,--even land, in which\r\ncitizenship strikes its strongest root; but you will not allow him the\r\npoor right of petition.\r\n\r\nHe may own stocks of the United States, Treasury notes, and in other\r\nways be the creditor of the Government; but you will not allow him the\r\npoor right of petition.\r\n\r\nHe is strictly bound by every enactment upon our statute-book; and yet\r\nyou will not allow him to appear before you with a prayer to modify or\r\nsoften this statute-book.\r\n\r\nHe is rigidly held to pay his quota of taxes; but you will not allow\r\nhim to ask for their reduction.\r\n\r\nAnd still further, under all your pension laws for Revolutionary\r\nservices, and for services in other wars, whether on land or sea, he is\r\nentitled to a pension precisely as if he were white; but you will not\r\nallow him to solicit aid under these laws.\r\n\r\nSuch is a simple statement of the injustice you are about to do. On\r\nthis statement alone, without one word of argument or illustration, you\r\nwill surely recoil.\r\n\r\nBut this proposition proceeds on two assumptions, each of which is\r\nradically false: _first_, that a free person of African descent is not\r\na citizen of the United States; and, _secondly_, that none other than a\r\ncitizen is entitled to petition Congress.\r\n\r\nIn support of the first assumption is the recent decision of the\r\nSupreme Court in the case of Dred Scott. But against that decision--so\r\nunfortunate for the character of the tribunal from which it\r\nproceeded,--which has degraded that tribunal hardly less than it sought\r\nto degrade the African race--I oppose the actual fact in at least _six_\r\nof the original thirteen States at the adoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n_First_, in Massachusetts, where the present petitioners reside, all\r\npersons, without distinction of color, are treated as citizens by its\r\nConstitution adopted in 1780.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, in Virginia, the State represented by the Senator [Mr.\r\nMASON] who brings forward this decree of disfranchisement, the same\r\nprinciple prevailed at the same time. And here I call attention to the\r\n11th volume of Hening’s Virginia Statutes, where, on page 322, may be\r\nfound the law of October, 1783, which repeals that of 1779, limiting\r\ncitizenship to whites, and enacts, “that _all free persons_ born\r\nwithin the territory of this Commonwealth … shall be deemed citizens of\r\nthis Commonwealth,” without one word referring to descent or color.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, in New Hampshire, whose Constitution conferred the elective\r\nfranchise upon “every inhabitant of the State having the proper\r\nqualifications,”--of which descent or color was not one.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, in New York, where the Constitution conferred the elective\r\nfranchise upon “every male inhabitant of full age who shall have\r\npersonally resided,” &c., “if during the time aforesaid he shall have\r\nbeen a freeholder,” &c.,--without any discrimination of descent or\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly_, in New Jersey, by whose Constitution the elective franchise\r\nwas conferred upon “_all inhabitants_ of this colony, of full age,\r\nwho are worth fifty pounds, proclamation money, clear estate,”--also\r\nwithout any discrimination of descent or color.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly_, in North Carolina, where Mr. Justice Gaston, in delivering\r\nthe opinion of the Supreme Court of the State in the case of _The\r\nState_ v. _Manuel_, declared that “the Constitution extended the\r\nelective franchise to _every freeman_ who had arrived at the age of\r\ntwenty-one and paid a public tax; and it is a matter of universal\r\nnotoriety, that, under it, _free persons_, without regard to color,\r\nclaimed and exercised the franchise, until it was taken from free men\r\nof color a few years since by our amended Constitution.”[145]\r\n\r\nTo these authoritative precedents, drawn from the very epoch of the\r\nNational Constitution, I might add other illustrations. I content\r\nmyself with referring to the Constitution of Missouri, which, in\r\nspeaking of “every free _white_ male citizen,”[146] admits by\r\nimplication that colored persons may be _citizens_, and to the Code\r\nof Alabama, which declares that certain sections “do not apply to or\r\naffect any free person of color who by the Treaty between the United\r\nStates and Spain became _a citizen of the United States, or the\r\ndescendants of such_.”[147]\r\n\r\nBut not only in six of the old thirteen States _all freemen_ without\r\ndistinction of color were _citizens_, but also under the Articles\r\nof Confederation they were _citizens_. By the fourth article it was\r\nexpressly declared that “the _free inhabitants_ of each of these\r\nStates (paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice excepted)\r\nshall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of _free citizens_\r\nin the several States.” The meaning of this clause, which is clear\r\non its face, becomes clearer still, when it is known, that, while\r\nit was under discussion, on the 25th of June, 1778, the delegates\r\nfrom South Carolina moved to amend it by inserting between the\r\nwords “free inhabitants” the word “white,” so that the character of\r\na citizen should be restricted to white persons. This proposition\r\nwas rejected,--two States only voting for it, eight States against\r\nit, and the vote of one State being divided; so that the term “free\r\ninhabitants” was left in its full significance, without any distinction\r\nof descent or color.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States next followed. And it contains\r\nnot a sentence, phrase, or word of disfranchisement on account of\r\ndescent or color, any more than on account of religion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the present question depended upon citizenship, you could not refuse\r\nto receive the petition. But it does not depend upon citizenship.\r\nThe right to petition Congress is not an incident of the elective\r\nfranchise. It exists where the elective franchise does not exist.\r\nThe Constitution expressly secures it, not simply to _citizens_, but\r\nbroadly and completely to THE PEOPLE, declaring, in the first article\r\nof its Amendments, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\r\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\r\nor abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, _or the right of\r\nthe people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a\r\nredress of grievances_.”\r\n\r\nThe term _people_ here naturally means all, without distinction of\r\nclass, who owe allegiance to the Government. It is the American\r\nequivalent for _subjects_. If there were any doubt on this point, it\r\nwould be removed by the clear and irresistible meaning of the term in\r\nother parts of the Constitution. Thus, in the clause constituting the\r\nHouse of Representatives, it is declared that it “shall be composed\r\nof members chosen every second year by the _people_ of the several\r\nStates, and the _electors_ in each State shall have the qualifications\r\nrequisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State\r\nLegislature.” Here is an obvious difference between the “people” and\r\n“electors.” The former is broader than the latter. It is the former\r\nthat constitutes the _basis of representation_, and the Constitution\r\nthen proceeds to declare that this basis “shall be determined by adding\r\n_to the whole number of free persons_, including those bound to service\r\nfor a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of\r\nall other persons.” Whatever may be the position of the _fractional_\r\nclass, nothing can be clearer than that all _free persons_, without\r\ndistinction of color or descent, belong to the _people_, and,\r\nso belonging, they are solemnly and expressly protected by the\r\nConstitution in the right of petition.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution next provides for the “enumeration” of the _people_,\r\nand under this provision there is a decennial census of the whole\r\n_people_, without distinction of color or descent; and yet, while\r\nincluding all of African descent in your population, you refuse to\r\nreceive their petitions.\r\n\r\nThe present proposition is aggravated by well-attested facts in our\r\nhistory. A colored man, Crispus Attucks, was the first martyr of our\r\nRevolutionary struggle. Throughout the long war of seven years, while\r\nnational independence was still doubtful, colored men fought sometimes\r\nin the same ranks with the whites, and sometimes in separate companies,\r\nbut always with patriotic courage, and often under the eye of\r\nWashington. The blood of the two races mingled, and, dying on the same\r\nfield, they were buried beneath the same sod. And this same association\r\nwas continued throughout the War of 1812, in all our naval contests,\r\nand especially in the Battle of Lake Erie under Perry, and of Lake\r\nChamplain under Macdonough, where colored men performed a conspicuous\r\npart. But no better testimony can be presented than the eloquent\r\nproclamation of General Jackson, before the Battle of New Orleans,\r\nwhere he calls upon the “free colored inhabitants of Louisiana” to\r\ntake part in the contest as _American soldiers_, and speaks of them\r\nby implication as “fellow-citizens.”[148] “American soldiers” and\r\n“fellow-citizens”: such is the language of Andrew Jackson, when\r\nspeaking of those whom you would despoil of a venerable right.\r\n\r\nThus, Sir, throughout our history, you have used these men for defence\r\nof the country, you have coined their blood into your own liberties;\r\nbut you deny them now the smallest liberty of all,--the last which\r\nis left to the miserable,--_the liberty to pray_. In the history of\r\nmisfortune or of tyranny nothing can surpass this final act of robbery.\r\nThe words of the classic poet are fulfilled:--\r\n\r\n    “‘The wretch, in short, had nothing.’ You say true:\r\n    And yet the wretch _must lose that nothing too_.”[149]\r\n\r\nThere is a story of General Washington which illustrates by contrast\r\nthe wrong of the present proposition. On a certain occasion, being\r\nengaged late at the quarters of his aid, Colonel Pickering, of\r\nMassachusetts, he proposed to pass the night, if the colored servant,\r\nPrimus Hall, whom I remember at Boston in my childhood, could find\r\nstraw and a blanket. Of course they were found; but it was by the\r\nsurrender of the servant’s own blanket. In the course of the night, the\r\nGeneral, becoming aware of the sacrifice, most authoritatively required\r\nthe servant to share the blanket, saying, “There is room for both, and\r\nI insist upon it”; and on the same straw, beneath the same blanket, the\r\nGeneral and the faithful African slept till morning sun.[150] You not\r\nonly refuse to share your liberties with the colored man, but you now\r\npropose to take from him his last blanket.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is not the time to dwell on the character of the colored race;\r\nfor the right of petition can never depend on the character of the\r\npetitioner, while in criminal cases liberty and life even may. But I\r\nmention two facts which speak for this much injured people. The first,\r\nSir, is the official census, by which it appears that throughout the\r\nFree States among the colored population a much larger proportion\r\nattend school than among the whites of the Slave States, and this\r\ncontrast becomes still more apparent when we consider the small\r\nattendance upon school by the whites in South Carolina. The other fact\r\nappears in the last will and testament of Mr. Upshur, of Virginia,\r\nSecretary of State under President Tyler, where he thus speaks:--\r\n\r\n    “I emancipate and set free my servant, David Rich, and direct\r\n    my executors to give him one hundred dollars. I recommend him\r\n    in the strongest manner to the respect, esteem, and confidence\r\n    of any community in which he may happen to live. He has been\r\n    my slave for twenty-four years, during which time he has been\r\n    trusted to every extent and in every respect. My confidence\r\n    in him has been unbounded; his relation to myself and family\r\n    has always been such as to afford him daily opportunities to\r\n    deceive and injure us, and yet he has never been detected in\r\n    a serious fault, nor even in an intentional breach of the\r\n    decorums of his station. His intelligence is of a high order,\r\n    his integrity above all suspicion, and his sense of right and\r\n    propriety always correct and even delicate and refined. I feel\r\n    that he is justly entitled to carry this certificate from me\r\n    into the new relations which he now must form. It is due to\r\n    his long and most faithful services, and to the sincere and\r\n    steady friendship which I bear him. In the uninterrupted and\r\n    confidential intercourse of twenty-four years, I have never\r\n    given nor had occasion to give him an unpleasant word. I know\r\n    no man who has fewer faults or more excellencies than he.\r\n\r\n            A. P. UPSHUR.”[151]\r\n\r\nI do not dwell on precedents; for Senators willing to entertain this\r\nproposition can have little regard for any precedents in favor of\r\nHuman Rights. I content myself with saying, that never before has this\r\nassault on Human Rights been made,--that petitions from colored persons\r\nhave been often presented and refused, precisely as other petitions.\r\nHere, for example, is an instance on the Journals of the Senate:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Seward presented a petition of citizens of Ontario County,\r\n    New York, praying that the army may be disbanded, and its\r\n    services hereafter dispensed with; _a petition of male and\r\n    female colored inhabitants of Boston, Massachusetts_, praying\r\n    that colored men may be employed in transporting the mails, and\r\n    enrolled in the militia; _and a petition of male and female\r\n    colored inhabitants of Boston, Massachusetts_, protesting\r\n    against the enactment of a law for the recovery of fugitive\r\n    slaves.”[152]\r\n\r\nBut I have said enough. Most earnestly and sincerely do I protest\r\nagainst this attempt, on three grounds: _first_, because, being\r\nessentially barbarous in character, it must be utterly shameful to\r\na government boasting Christianity and professing Civilization;\r\n_secondly_, because it is a flagrant violation of the constitutional\r\nrights of more than half a million of American people; and, _thirdly_,\r\nbecause, in the present case, it is an insult to the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts, where these petitioners reside in the free enjoyment\r\nof all the rights of citizens,--among others, of voting for Members\r\nof Congress. I am unwilling to weaken this argument for Human Rights\r\nby any appeal to State Rights; but I cannot fail to observe that this\r\nproposition, which tramples down State Rights in order to assail Human\r\nRights, proceeds from a Senator [Mr. MASON] who always avows himself\r\nthe defender of State Rights.\r\n\r\nFor myself, Sir, my course is plain. Whatever may be the action of the\r\nSenate, I shall continue to present such petitions. And permit me to\r\nsay, that I should be little worthy of the place I now hold, if, at any\r\ntime hereafter, receiving such petitions, I hesitate in the discharge\r\nof this sacred duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATE HONORABLE JOHN SCHWARTZ, OF PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE SENATE, ON THE RESOLUTIONS IN TRIBUTE TO HIM, JUNE 21,\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--Some men make themselves felt at once by their simple\r\npresence, and Mr. Schwartz was of this number. No person could set eyes\r\non him without being moved to inquire who he was, or, if the occasion\r\npresented, to form his acquaintance. His look was that of goodness,\r\nand he acted in a way to confirm the charm of his appearance. Entering\r\ntardily into public life, he followed the prompting of duty, and not of\r\nambition. At this call he severed friendships, personal and political,\r\nbelieving that principle was of higher worth than party or politician\r\nor President. Thus, when already reverend with age, he became a\r\nRepresentative in Congress.\r\n\r\nHis presence in the other House was a protest. All who saw him there\r\nknew that he came from a constituency which had always been represented\r\nby an unhesitating member of the Democratic party, while he openly\r\ndenounced that party,[153] and associated himself cordially and\r\ncompletely with those who, founding themselves on the Declaration\r\nof Independence and the Constitution, sought to bring the National\r\nGovernment to the ancient ways. I mention this circumstance, because it\r\nis an essential part of his too brief public life, while it illustrates\r\nhis character, and proclaims his title to honor. The powerful party\r\nleader, “with a Senate at his heels,” is less worthy of love and\r\nconsideration than the simple citizen, who, scorning party ties, dares\r\nto be true and just.\r\n\r\nBut never did man, who had broken down a party at home, and taken his\r\nseat as representative of Opposition, wear his signal success more\r\ngently. Though decided and firm in conduct, he was winning and sweet\r\nin manner, and by beautiful example showed how to unite two qualities\r\nwhich are not always found together. Winter was not sterner, summer was\r\nnot softer.\r\n\r\nIn character he did honor to the brave and pure German stock, which,\r\neven from that early day when first revealed to history in the\r\nsharp and clean-cut style of Tacitus, has preserved its original\r\npeculiarities untouched by change, showing, that, though the individual\r\nis mortal, the race is immortal. American by birth, and American in\r\na generous patriotism, he was German in his clear blue eye, in his\r\nphysical frame, in the warmth of his affections, and in the simplicity\r\nof his life. To him alone our tribute is now due; but, in pronouncing\r\nthe name of JOHN SCHWARTZ, we cannot forget the “fatherland” of his\r\nancestors, which out of its abundance has given to our Republic so\r\nmany good heads, so many strong arms, with so much of virtue and\r\nintelligence, rejoicing in freedom, and calling no man master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNHESITATING ASSERTION OF OUR PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE REPUBLICANS OF NEW YORK CITY, JUNE 27, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    An enthusiastic meeting of the Old Men’s and Young Men’s\r\n    Republican Central Committees of the City of New York was held\r\n    on the evening of June 28, for the purpose of extending a\r\n    welcome to the Republican Senators of the Eastern States, on\r\n    their return from Congress. D. D. Conover, of the Old Men’s\r\n    Committee, presided, assisted by Charles S. Spencer, of the\r\n    Young Men’s Committee. The following letter from Mr. Sumner, in\r\n    answer to an invitation, was read by Edgar Ketchum.\r\n\r\n                              SENATE CHAMBER, June 27, 1860.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--I must renounce the opportunity of meeting the\r\n  Republicans of New York to-morrow evening, asking them to accept\r\n  my thanks for the invitation with which they have honored me.\r\n\r\n  Let me congratulate them on the good omens which cheer us on\r\n  every side.\r\n\r\n  It only remains, that, by _unhesitating assertion of our\r\n  principles_, we continue to deserve victory.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  EDGAR KETCHUM, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY: ITS ORIGIN, NECESSITY, AND PERMANENCE.\r\n\r\nSPEECH BEFORE THE YOUNG MEN’S REPUBLICAN UNION OF NEW YORK, AT COOPER\r\nINSTITUTE, JULY 11, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This early speech in the Presidential campaign which ended in\r\n    the election of Abraham Lincoln was made by Mr. Sumner while on\r\n    his way home from Washington. It was reported and noticed by\r\n    the New York press. A journal having little sympathy with it\r\n    describes the magnificence and enthusiasm of the auditory, and\r\n    thus abridges the speech in flaming capitals: “The Presidential\r\n    Contest; Great Convulsion in the Republican Camp; Charles\r\n    Sumner on the Stump; A Strong Plea for Old Abe; Another Attack\r\n    upon Slaveholders; The Fivefold Wrong of Human Slavery.”\r\n\r\n    The meeting is mentioned in all the journals as one of the\r\n    largest ever assembled within the walls of Cooper Institute,\r\n    and also remarkable for respectability of appearance. One of\r\n    them says it seemed more like an audience of some great concert\r\n    or festival than a political meeting. As soon as the doors were\r\n    opened every available position was occupied, and in half an\r\n    hour afterwards it was impossible to find accommodation. More\r\n    than one third of the vast hall had been reserved for ladies,\r\n    and it was completely filled. The windows of the upper floor\r\n    opening upon the basement were crammed with people. On the\r\n    stage were many distinguished persons, judges and ex-judges.\r\n    The welcome of the speaker is thus noticed by another:--\r\n\r\n        “Mr. Sumner appeared on the rostrum precisely at eight\r\n        o’clock, and was received with an outburst of excited\r\n        enthusiasm which defies all description. The applause was\r\n        unanimous and intense. Cheer after cheer arose, loud and\r\n        vociferous; men stood up and waved their handkerchiefs and\r\n        their hats till scarcely anything else could be seen.”\r\n\r\n    The scene at this time was chronicled by the _Independent_.\r\n\r\n         “The orator’s return to the people, after his long and\r\n        enforced retirement from the platform, was celebrated at\r\n        Cooper Institute with such a welcome as we have rarely seen\r\n        given to any man. On coming forward, he was greeted with\r\n        cheer after cheer, the audience rising and prolonging their\r\n        salutations through many minutes, with continuous shouting\r\n        and waving of handkerchiefs.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Rogers, the President of the Young Men’s Republican Union,\r\n    nominated for chairman of the meeting Hon. Abijah Mann, Jr.,\r\n    which nomination was unanimously accepted. Mr. Mann, on taking\r\n    the chair, said that they had now to listen to the voice of\r\n    one who had stood up manfully for freedom of speech, not only\r\n    against open foes, but even against the opposition of some of\r\n    his colleagues. [_Applause._] He was here to-night to maintain\r\n    this same right to free speech, and to express his views of the\r\n    political condition of the country. It gave him pleasure to\r\n    introduce to the audience Hon. Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sumner, on taking the stand, was again greeted with loud\r\n    and prolonged cheers. After tendering acknowledgments for the\r\n    generous and cordial reception, and regretting his inability to\r\n    express all he felt, he proceeded with his speech, which was\r\n    thus described by the _Evening Post_:--\r\n\r\n        “Mr. Sumner was as happy in the manner as he was forcible\r\n        in the matter of his speech. His commanding person, his\r\n        distinct utterance, and his graceful elocution combined\r\n        with the eloquence of his words in keeping the immense\r\n        auditory to their seats for two hours, without a movement,\r\n        and almost without a breath, save when the applause broke\r\n        forth. It is the first time that Mr. Sumner has spoken in\r\n        public since he was laid low in the Senate House, and New\r\n        York, by this grand demonstration, has shown its eagerness\r\n        to welcome him to the field of so many former triumphs.”\r\n\r\n    In this speech Mr. Sumner sought to popularize his argument in\r\n    the Senate on the Barbarism of Slavery, with an application to\r\n    the Presidential election, and at the same time to reassert\r\n    the positions he had there taken. Its influence was increased\r\n    by the circulation it enjoyed. Besides the _Tribune_, _Times_,\r\n    _Herald_, and _World_, which printed it in full, there was a\r\n    pamphlet edition of more than fifty thousand copies circulated\r\n    by the Young Men’s Republican Union. The Secretary of the\r\n    Republican Central Committee of California wrote, that this\r\n    Committee, after publishing a large edition of the “Barbarism\r\n    of Slavery,” published ten thousand copies of the New York\r\n    speech, which was “read with that attention which the subject\r\n    elucidated by you readily commands.” Among letters with regard\r\n    to it, two are preserved as friendly voices.\r\n\r\n    Hon. W. H. Seward wrote from Auburn:--\r\n\r\n        “Your speech, in every part, is noble and great. Even you\r\n        never spoke so well.”\r\n\r\n    Another friend, who had not agreed with Mr. Sumner at an\r\n    earlier period, George Livermore, the intelligent merchant of\r\n    Boston, devoted to books as well as business, being in New York\r\n    at the time, heard the speech, and, in a letter dated at the\r\n    Fifth Avenue Hotel, wrote:--\r\n\r\n        “I can say in all sincerity, that, of all the political\r\n        addresses I have ever heard,--and for thirty years past I\r\n        have heard a great many, and from the most distinguished\r\n        men in the country,--I have never listened to one that\r\n        would begin to compare with this as a whole. The high and\r\n        broad ground on which you based your views, the clearness\r\n        and force with which you presented the subject, the dignity\r\n        and grace of your manner, and the honest and hearty tone\r\n        in which you uttered your thoughts, all together make your\r\n        speech _the best one that was ever delivered_, as far as my\r\n        knowledge and experience go.”\r\n\r\n    These testimonies will at least explain the effect of this\r\n    speech at the time.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW YORK:--\r\n\r\nOf all men in our history, there are two whose influence at this moment\r\nis peculiar. Though dead, they yet live, speak, and act in the conflict\r\nof principle which divides the country,--standing face to face, like\r\ntwo well-matched champions. When I add that one was from South Carolina\r\nand the other from Massachusetts, you cannot fail to see that I mean\r\nJohn C. Calhoun and John Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\nStatesmen, both, of long career, marked ability, and unblemished\r\nintegrity,--acting together at first,--sitting in the same Cabinet,\r\nfrom which they passed, one to become Vice-President, and the other\r\nPresident,--then, for the remainder of their days, battling in\r\nCongress, and dying there,--each was a leader in life, but each is now\r\nin death a greater leader still.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun possessed an intellect of much originality and boldness,\r\nand, though wanting the culture of a scholar, made himself felt in\r\ncouncil and in debate. To native powers unlike, but not inferior, Mr.\r\nAdams added the well-ripened fruits of long experience in foreign\r\nlands and of studies more various and complete than those of any other\r\npublic man in our history, besides an indomitable will, and that\r\nspirit of freedom which inspired his father, when, in the Continental\r\nCongress, he so eloquently maintained the Declaration of Independence,\r\nmaking himself its Colossus on that floor.\r\n\r\nSitting together in the Cabinet of Mr. Monroe, they concurred in\r\nsanctioning the Missouri Prohibition of Slavery as constitutional,\r\nand so advised the President. But here divergence probably began,\r\nthough for a long time not made manifest. The diary of Mr. Adams\r\nshows that at that early day, when Slavery had been little discussed,\r\nhe saw its enormity with instinctive quickness, and described it\r\nwith corresponding force. The record is less full with regard to Mr.\r\nCalhoun; but when they reappeared, one in the Senate, and the other in\r\nthe House of Representatives, each openly assumed the position by which\r\nhe will be known in history,--one as chief in all the pretensions of\r\nSlavery and Slave-Masters, the other as champion of Freedom.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun regarded Slavery as a permanent institution; Mr. Adams\r\nregarded it as something transitory. Mr. Calhoun vaunted it as a form\r\nof civilization; Mr. Adams scorned it as an unquestionable barbarism.\r\nMr. Calhoun did not hesitate to call it the most stable basis of free\r\ngovernment; Mr. Adams vehemently denounced it as a curse, full of\r\nweakness and mockery, doubly offensive in a boastful Republic. Mr.\r\nCalhoun, not content with exalting Slavery, proceeded to condemn the\r\nearly opinions of Washington and Jefferson as “folly and delusion,”\r\nto assail the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence\r\nas “absurd,” and then to proclaim that human beings are “property”\r\nunder the Constitution, and, as such, may be transported into the\r\nTerritories and there held in Slavery; while Mr. Adams added to the\r\nglory of his long and diversified career by persistent efforts which\r\nare better for his fame than having been President,--upholding the\r\ngreat rights of petition and of speech,--vindicating the early opinions\r\nof the Fathers, and the self-evident truths of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence,--exposing the odious character of Slavery,--insisting\r\nupon its prohibition in the Territories,--denying the asserted property\r\nin man,--and especially, and often, exhibiting the unjust power in the\r\nNational Government usurped by what he called “the little cluster” of\r\nSlave-Masters, whose yoke was to him intolerable.\r\n\r\nSuch, most briefly told, were antagonist opinions of these two\r\nchiefs. Never was great conflict destined to involve a great country\r\nmore distinctly foreshadowed. All that the Republican party now\r\nopposes may be found in John C. Calhoun; all that the Republican\r\nparty now maintains may be found in John Quincy Adams. Choose ye,\r\nfellow-citizens, between the two.\r\n\r\nThe rule of “Principles and not Men” is hardly applicable to a man\r\nwhose name, bearing the sacred seal of death, has become the synonym\r\nof Principle; yet I do not hesitate to say that our cause is best\r\nappreciated in its precise objects and aims. Proud as we are to\r\ntread where John Quincy Adams leads the way, there is a guide of\r\nmore commanding authority--found in the eternal law of Right, and\r\nthe concurring mandate of the Constitution itself, when properly\r\ninterpreted--that teaches the duties of a good citizen. Such is the\r\nguide of the Republican party, which, I say fearlessly, where most\r\nknown, will be most trusted, and, when understood in its origin, will\r\nbe seen to be no accidental or fugitive organization, merely for an\r\nelection, but an irresistible necessity, which in the nature of things\r\nmust be permanent as the pretensions, moral and political, which it\r\nseeks to constrain and counteract.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll must admit, too, that, if no Republican party existed now,--even\r\nif that halcyon day had come, so often promised by cajoling\r\npoliticians, when the Slavery Question was settled,--still there\r\nwould be a political necessity for a great party of Opposition to\r\nact as check on the Administration. A kindred necessity was once\r\nexpressed by an eminent British statesman, who gave as a toast, “A\r\nstrong Administration and a strong Opposition.” Parties are unknown in\r\ndespotic countries. They belong to the machinery of free governments.\r\nThrough parties public opinion is concentrated and directed; through\r\nparties principles are maintained above men; and through parties men in\r\npower are held to a just responsibility. If ever there was occasion for\r\nsuch a party, it is now, when the corruptions of the Administration are\r\ndragged to light by Committees of Congress. On this ground alone good\r\nmen might be summoned to rescue the government of our country.\r\n\r\nIt is an attested fact that Mr. Buchanan became President through\r\ncorruption. Money, familiarly known as a “corruption fund,” first\r\ndistilled in small drippings from clerks and petty officials, was\r\nswollen by larger contributions of merchants and contractors, and with\r\nthis accumulation votes were purchased in Philadelphia, enough to turn\r\nthe election in that great metropolis, and in the chain of cause and\r\neffect to assure the triumph of the Democratic candidate. I speak\r\nnow only what is proved. Fraudulent naturalization papers in blank,\r\nby which this was perpetrated, were produced before a Committee of\r\nCongress. It was natural that an Administration thus corrupt in origin\r\nshould continue to exercise power through the same corruption by which\r\npower was gained; but nothing else than that insensibility to acts of\r\nshame produced by familiarity can explain how all this has been done\r\nwith such absolute indecency of exposure, so as to recall the words of\r\nthe poet,--\r\n\r\n    “How use doth breed a habit in a man!”\r\n\r\nA letter from a local politician, addressed to the President himself,\r\nurging without disguise the giving of a large contract for machinery\r\nto a particular house in Philadelphia, employing four hundred and\r\nfifty mechanics, with a view to the approaching election, was sent\r\nto the Secretary of the Navy, with this indorsement, in a well-known\r\nhandwriting, signed by well-known initials: “Sept. 15, 1858. The\r\nenclosed letter from Colonel Patterson, of Philadelphia, is submitted\r\nto the attention of the Secretary of the Navy. J. B.” Thus did the\r\nPresident of the United States, in formal written words, now of record\r\nin the history of the country, recommend the employment of the public\r\nmoney, set apart for the public service, to influence an election. Here\r\nwas criminality as positive as when his supporters purchased votes\r\nin the streets. From one learn all; and from such a characteristic\r\ninstance learn the character of the Administration. But there are\r\nother well-known instances; and the testimony before the Congressional\r\nCommittees discloses the President on Sundays in secret conclave with\r\none of his corrupt agents, piously occupied discussing the chances of\r\nan election, and how its expenses were to be met, while, at the same\r\ntime, like another Joseph Surface, he was uttering in public “fine\r\nsentiments” of political morality, and lamenting the prevalence of the\r\nvery indecencies in which he was engaged.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that a President, who, with professions of purity on\r\nthe lips, made himself the pander of such vulgar corruption, should\r\nstick at nothing needful to carry his purposes. I shall not dwell on\r\nthe Lecompton Constitution; but it belongs to this chapter. You all\r\nknow its wickedness. Concocted originally at Washington, with the\r\nsingle purpose of fastening Slavery upon the people of Kansas, it\r\nwas by execrable contrivance so arranged as to prevent the people,\r\nwhen about to become a State, from voting on that question. Next\r\nsanctioned by a convention of usurpers, who in no respect represented\r\nthe people of Kansas, then fraudulently submitted to the people for\r\ntheir votes, it was fraudulently adopted by stuffing ballot-boxes on\r\na scale never before known. Thus, at the Delaware Crossing, where\r\nthere were but forty-three legal voters, four hundred were returned;\r\nat Oxford, where there were but forty-two legal voters, a thousand\r\nwere returned; and at Shawnee, where there were but forty legal\r\nvoters, twelve hundred were returned. And yet this Constitution,\r\ndisowned by the very Governor who had gone to Kansas as agent of the\r\nPresident,--rotten with corruption, gaping with falsehood, and steaming\r\nwith iniquity,--was at once recognized by the President, urged upon\r\nCongress in a special message, and pressed for adoption by all the\r\nappliances of unprincipled power. If the words of Jugurtha, turning his\r\nback upon Rome, cannot be repeated, that the Republic is for sale,\r\nand soon to perish, if it shall find a purchaser,[154] nor the sharper\r\nsaying of Walpole, that every man has his price, it was not from any\r\nforbearance in the President. A single editor was offered the printing\r\nof Post-Office blanks worth at least eighty thousand dollars, if by an\r\narticle no larger than a man’s hand he would show submission to the\r\nAdministration. Bribes of office were added to bribes of money. As the\r\nvotes of electors had been purchased to make Mr. Buchanan President,\r\nthe votes of Representatives were now solicited to carry out his scheme\r\nof corruption, and the Halls of Congress were changed into a political\r\nmarket-house, where men were bought by the head. Is not all this enough\r\nto arouse the indignation of the people?\r\n\r\nIt is true that the President, whose power began in corruption, and who\r\nis responsible author of the corruption by which his administration has\r\nbeen debased, is no longer a candidate for office. Already judgment\r\nbegins. His own political party discards him. The first avenging\r\nblow is struck. Incorruptible history will do the rest. The tablet\r\nconspicuously erected in Genoa to expose the crimes of certain Doges,\r\nbranding one as _Fur Magnus_ and another as _Maximus Latronum_, will\r\nnot be needed here. The exposed corrupter, the tyrant enslaver, and the\r\nrobber of Human Freedom cannot be forgotten. Unhappy President! after a\r\nlong career of public service, not only tossed aside, but tossed over\r\nto perpetual memory as an example to be shunned! Better for him the\r\noblivion of common life than the bad fame he has won!\r\n\r\nBut, though not himself a candidate for office, his peculiar\r\nsupporters, animated by his spirit, linked with him in misrule,\r\nare embodied as a party, and ask your votes. Simply to resist this\r\ncombination, and to save the Republic from its degrading influence,\r\nwould justify the formation of the Republican party; and I doubt not\r\nthat there are many who will be content to unite with us on this ground\r\nalone, anxious to put the National Government once again in pure hands.\r\nTo all such, welcome!\r\n\r\nWhile this consummation necessarily enters into the present purposes\r\nof the Republican party, while we naturally begin by insisting upon\r\npurity in the Government, and make this one of our urgent demands, it\r\nis obvious that the quickening impulse of the party is to be found\r\nin other purposes, which cannot pass away in a single election. The\r\nRepublican party seeks to overthrow the Slave Oligarchy in the National\r\nGovernment, and especially at this moment to stay its aggressions\r\nin the Territories, which, through a corrupt interpretation of the\r\nConstitution, it threatens to barbarize with Slavery. But all who seek\r\npurity in the National Government must unite in this purpose; for only\r\nby the overthrow of this base Oligarchy, which, beginning in the denial\r\nof all human rights, necessarily shows itself in barbarism and villany\r\nof all kinds, can a better order prevail. It is out of Slavery that all\r\nour griefs proceed; nor can the offences of the present Administration\r\nbe fully comprehended without considering the nature of this Evil,\r\nand its chronic influence over our Government, reaching everywhere\r\nby subtle agencies, or more subtle, far-reaching example, but still\r\nin itself the original and all-sufficient activity. As well attempt\r\nto explain the Gulf Stream without the Gulf of Mexico, or the Origin\r\nof Evil without the human heart, as attempt to explain the present\r\ndegraded character of the National Government without Slavery. As well\r\nattempt the play of “Othello” without the Moor. And permit me to say\r\nthat our warfare with these iniquities will be feeble, unless we attack\r\nthem in their origin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of our history Slavery was universally admitted\r\nto be an Evil. Nobody then so hardy as to vindicate it. In the\r\nConvention which framed the Constitution it was branded as “a nefarious\r\ninstitution,” or more mildly called “wrong”; and these generous voices\r\ncame from the South as well as from the North. Out of the Convention\r\nthere was a similar accord. I shall not quote the words of Washington,\r\nJefferson, Franklin, or Jay, for they are familiar to all. Even as\r\nthey spoke others spoke, and I might occupy the whole evening simply\r\nreciting this testimony. Nor were these declarations confined to public\r\nlife. The Colleges all, by definite action, arrayed themselves against\r\nSlavery, especially the University of William and Mary, in Virginia,\r\nwhich conferred upon Granville Sharp, the acknowledged chief of British\r\nAbolitionists, the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. The Literature\r\nof the land, such as it was, agreed with the Colleges. The Church,\r\ntoo, added its powerful voice; and here, amid diversities of religious\r\nfaith, we hail that unity of spirit which animated all. Quakers,\r\nMethodists, Presbyterians, and Congregationalists seemed to vie with\r\neach other in this pious testimony.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was adopted, but the word Slave was not allowed to\r\npollute its text; and this was in declared deference to the prevailing\r\nopinion, which regarded Slavery as temporary, destined soon to pass\r\naway. All looked to the glad day as almost at hand. In harmony with\r\nthis expectation, Slavery was prohibited in all existing territories of\r\nthe Union, so that, when Washington, as first President of the United\r\nStates, at his inauguration here in New York took his first oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution, the flag of the Republic nowhere on the land\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of Congress covered a single slave. Little then\r\ndid the Fathers dream that the Evil which they regarded with shame and\r\nexerted themselves to prohibit would elevate its obscene crest as it\r\nnow does, and flaunt its monstrous pretensions before the world. Little\r\ndid they dream that the Constitution, from which they had carefully\r\nexcluded the very _word_, would be held, in defiance of reason and\r\ncommon sense, to protect the _thing_, so exceptionally that it could\r\nnot be reached by Congressional prohibition, even within Congressional\r\njurisdiction. Little did they dream that the text, which they left so\r\npure and healthful, would, through corrupt interpretation, be swollen\r\ninto such an offensive Elephantiasis.\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances, civilizing in themselves, exercised an unexpected\r\ninfluence for American Slavery: first, the abolition of the\r\nslave-trade, which by taking away the supply increased the value\r\nof slaves; and, secondly, the increased cultivation of cotton,\r\nstimulated by the invention of new machinery. The latter has been\r\nof especial moment. Indeed, it is hardly too much to say that out\r\nof this slender cotton fibre are formed the manacles of the slave.\r\nThus, through sinister activity, and the wickedness of men, is good\r\nmade the minister of wrong. Next after Christopher Columbus, who by\r\nsublime enterprise opened a pathway to the New World, Eli Whitney, who\r\ndiscovered the cotton gin, has been indirectly and unconsciously a\r\nchief agent in the bondage of the African race on the North American\r\ncontinent; and surely proper gratitude for the advantages we enjoy in\r\nsuch large store from these two discoveries must prompt us to increased\r\nactivity for the welfare of those who, alas! have been such losers,\r\nwhere we have been such gainers.\r\n\r\nThe change of opinion, so disastrous in result, was gradual. Though in\r\nits successive stages easily detected by the careful inquirer, it did\r\nnot become manifest to the whole country till 1820, when it burst forth\r\nin the Missouri Question. Then, for the first time, Slavery showed\r\nitself openly violent, insolent, belligerent. Freedom was checked,\r\nbut saved something by a compromise,--announced, at the moment of its\r\nadoption, by Charles Pinckney, of South Carolina, as a triumph of the\r\nSouth,--where, in consideration of the admission of Missouri as a Slave\r\nState, thus securing additional preponderance to the Slave Power, it\r\nwas stipulated that Slavery should be prohibited in certain outlying\r\nterritory, at that time trodden only by savages. Then came a lull,\r\nduring which the change was still at work, until, contemporaneously\r\nwith the abolition of Slavery in the British West Indies, the\r\ndiscussion was lighted anew. Meanwhile slaves augmented in price, and\r\nslave-masters became more decided. In timid deference to the world,\r\nthey at first ventured no defence of Slavery in the abstract; but at\r\nlast, bolder grown under the lead of Mr. Calhoun, they threw aside all\r\nreserve, openly assailed the opinions of the Fathers, audaciously\r\ndenied the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence,\r\nand by formal resolution asserted the new dogma of Slavery in the\r\nTerritories. This was as late as 1847. A letter of that day, from Mr.\r\nCalhoun, addressed to a member of the Alabama Legislature, shows that\r\nthere was an element of policy in this exaggeration. His desire was\r\n“to force the Slavery issue” on the North, believing that delay was\r\ndangerous, as the Slave-Masters were then relatively stronger, both\r\nmorally and politically, than they would ever be again.\r\n\r\nAt last the end has come. Slavery is openly pronounced, at one time,\r\nthe black marble keystone of our National Arch,--at another time, the\r\ncorner-stone of our Republican edifice; then it is vaunted as the\r\nhighest type of civilization,--then as a blessing to the master as well\r\nas the slave,--and then again as ennobling to the master, if not to the\r\nslave. It is only the first step which costs, and therefore the authors\r\nof these opinions, so shocking to the moral sense, do not hesitate at\r\nother opinions equally shocking to the reason, even to the extent of\r\nfinding impossible sanctions for Slavery in the Constitution. Listening\r\nto these extravagances, who would not exclaim, with Ben Jonson in the\r\nplay?--\r\n\r\n    “Grave fathers, he’s possessed; again I say,\r\n    Possessed: nay, if there be possession and\r\n    Obsession, he has both.”[155]\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, what is Slavery? This is no question of\r\ncuriosity or philanthropy merely; for when the National Government,\r\nwhich you and I at the North help to constitute, is degraded to be its\r\ninstrument, and all the National Territories are proclaimed open to\r\nits Barbarism, and the Constitution itself is perverted to its support,\r\nthe whole subject naturally, logically, and necessarily enters into our\r\ndiscussion. It cannot be avoided; it cannot be blinked out of sight.\r\nNay, you must pass upon it by your votes at the coming election. Futile\r\nis the plea that we at the North have nothing to do with Slavery.\r\nGranted that we have nothing to do with it in the States, we have much\r\nto do with all its irrational assumptions under the Constitution, and\r\njust so long as these are urged must Slavery be discussed. It must be\r\nlaid bare in its enormity, precisely as though it were proposed to\r\nplant it here in the streets of New York. Nor can such a wrong--foul in\r\nitself, and fouler still in pretensions--be dealt with tamely. Tameness\r\nis surrender. And charity, too, may be misapplied. Forgiving those who\r\ntrespass against us, I know not if we are called to forgive those who\r\ntrespass against others,--to forgive those who trespass against the\r\nRepublic,--to forgive those who trespass against Civilization,--to\r\nforgive those who trespass against a whole race,--to forgive those who\r\ntrespass against the universal Human Family,--finally, to forgive those\r\nwho trespass against God. Such trespassers exist among us, possessing\r\nthe organization of party, holding the control of the National\r\nGovernment, constituting a colossal Power, and\r\n\r\n              “what seems its head\r\n    The likeness of a _President_ has on.”\r\n\r\nSurely, if ever there was a moment when every faculty should be bent\r\nto the service, and all invigorated by an inspiring zeal, it is now,\r\nwhile the battle between Civilization and Barbarism is still undecided,\r\nand you are summoned to resist the last desperate shock. To this work\r\nI am not equal; but I do not shrink from the duties of my post. Alas!\r\nhuman language is gentle, and the human voice is weak. Words only are\r\nmine, when I ought to command thunderbolts. Voice only is mine, when,\r\nlike the ancient Athenian, I ought to carry the weapons of Zeus on the\r\ntongue. Nor would I transcend any just rule of moderation, or urge this\r\nwarfare too far among persons. Humbly do I recognize the authority of\r\nHim, who, when reviled, reviled not again; but this divine example\r\nteaches me to expose crime, and not to hesitate, though the Scribes\r\nand Pharisees, chief-priests and money-changers, cry out. And it shows\r\nhow words of invective may come from lips of peace. “Woe unto you,\r\nScribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make\r\none proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child\r\nof hell than yourselves.” Thus spake the Saviour in Jerusalem; and he\r\nstill speaks, not in Jerusalem only, but wherever men are won from\r\ntruth, wherever crime exists to be exposed and denounced.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, I repeat, is Slavery? The occasion forbids detail; but\r\nenough must be presented to place this outrage in its true light,--as\r\nsomething worse even than a constant state of war, where the master\r\nis constant aggressor. Here I put aside for the moment all the tales\r\nwhich reach us from the house of bondage,--all the cumulative, crushing\r\ntestimony, from slaves and masters alike,--all the barbarous incidents\r\nwhich help to arouse a yet too feeble indignation,--in short, all the\r\nglimpses which come to us from this mighty Bluebeard’s chamber. All\r\nthese I put aside, not because they are of little moment in exhibiting\r\nthe true character of Slavery, but because I desire to arraign Slavery\r\non grounds above all controversy, impeachment, or suspicion, even from\r\nSlave-Masters themselves. Not on wonderful story, where the genius of\r\nwoman has prevailed, not even on indisputable facts, do I now accuse\r\nSlavery, but on its character as revealed in its own simple definition\r\nof itself. Out of its own mouth do I condemn it.\r\n\r\nBy the _Law of Slavery_, man, created in the image of God, fearfully\r\nand wonderfully made, with sensibilities of pleasure and pain, with\r\nsentiments of love, with aspirations for improvement, with a sense of\r\nproperty, and with a soul like ourselves, is despoiled of his human\r\ncharacter, and declared to be a mere _chattel_, “to all intents,\r\nconstructions, and purposes whatsoever.” I do not stop to give at\r\nlength all its odious words; you are doubtless familiar with them. The\r\nheathen idea of Aristotle is repeated,--“a tool with a soul.”[156] But\r\nin this simple definition is contained the whole incalculable wrong of\r\nSlavery; for out of it, as from an inexhaustible fountain, are derived\r\nall the unrighteous prerogatives of the master. These are five in\r\nnumber, and I know not which is most revolting.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the pretension that _man can hold property in\r\nman_,--forgetful, that, by a law older than all human law, foremost\r\nstands the indefeasible right of every man to himself.\r\n\r\nSecondly, _the absolute nullification of the relation of husband\r\nand wife_, so that all who are called slaves are delivered over to\r\nconcubinage or prostitution, it may be with each other, or it may be\r\nwith their masters; but with whomsoever it may be, it is the same, for\r\nwith slaves marriage is impossible, as they are merely “coupled,”\r\nnever married.\r\n\r\nThirdly, _the utter rejection of the relation of parent and child_; for\r\nthe infant legally belongs, not to the mother who bore it, but to the\r\nmaster who bought it.\r\n\r\nFourthly, _the complete, denial of instruction_; for the master may\r\nalways, at his own rude discretion, prevent his victim from learning\r\nto read, and thus shut against him those gates of knowledge which open\r\nsuch vistas on earth and in heaven.\r\n\r\nFifthly, _the wholesale robbery of the labor of another, and of all its\r\nfruits_,--forgetful, that, by the same original law under which every\r\nman has a title to himself, he has also a title to the fruits of his\r\nown labor, amounting in itself to a sacred property, which no person,\r\nhowsoever called, whether despot or master, can righteously appropriate.\r\n\r\nSuch are the five essential elements of Slavery. Look at them, and you\r\nwill confess that this institution stands forth as a hateful assemblage\r\nof unquestionable wrongs under sanction of existing law. Take away any\r\none of these, and just to that extent Slavery ceases to exist. Take\r\naway all, and the Slavery Question will be settled. But this assemblage\r\nbecomes more hateful still, when its unmistakable _single motive_ is\r\ndetected, which is simply _to compel labor without wages_. Incredible\r\nas it may be, it cannot be denied that the right of a man to himself,\r\nthe right of a husband to his wife, the right of a parent to his child,\r\nthe right of a man to instruction, the right of a man to the fruits\r\nof his own labor, all these supreme rights, by the side of which\r\nother rights seem petty, are trampled down in order to organize that\r\n_five-headed_ selfishness, practically maintained by the lash, which,\r\nlook at it as you will, has for its single object COMPULSORY LABOR\r\nWITHOUT WAGES.\r\n\r\nObviously and unquestionably the good of all is against such a\r\nsystem; nor, except for the pretended property of the master, and his\r\nselfish interest, could there be any color for it. That Slavery thus\r\nconstituted can be good for the master is one of the hallucinations\r\nof the system,--something like the hallucination of the opium-eater.\r\nFascinating, possibly, it may be for a time, but debasing and\r\ndestructive it must be in the end. “I agree with Mr. Boswell,” said Dr.\r\nJohnson, “that there must be high satisfaction in being a feudal lord”;\r\nbut the moralist did not consider this a good reason for such a power\r\nat the expense of others.[157] That Slave-Masters should be violent and\r\ntyrannical, that they should be regardless of all rights, especially\r\nwhere Slavery is concerned, and that the higher virtues of character\r\nshould fail in them,--all this might be inferred, even in the absence\r\nof evidence, according to irresistible law of cause and effect. No man\r\ncan do injustice with impunity. He may not suffer in worldly condition,\r\nbut he must suffer in his own nature. And the very unconsciousness in\r\nwhich he lives aggravates the unhappy influence. Nor can familiarity\r\nwith Slavery fail to harden the heart.\r\n\r\nPersons become accustomed to scenes of brutality, till they witness\r\nthem with indifference. Hogarth, that master of human nature,\r\nportrayed this tendency in his picture of a dissection at a medical\r\ncollege, where the president maintains the dignity of insensibility\r\nover a corpse, which he regards simply as the subject of a lecture.\r\nAnd Horace Walpole, who admired the satire of this picture, finds\r\nin it illustration of the idea, that “the legal habitude of viewing\r\nshocking scenes hardens the human mind, and renders it unfeeling.”[158]\r\nThis simple truth, in its most general application, exhibits the\r\ncondition of the Slave-Master. How can he show sensibility for the\r\ncommon rights of fellow-citizens who sacrifices daily the most sacred\r\nrights of others merely to secure _labor without wages_? With him a\r\nfalse standard is necessarily established, bringing with it a blunted\r\nmoral sense and clouded perceptions, so that, when he does something\r\nintrinsically barbarous or mean, he does not blush at the recital.\r\n\r\nHere, again, I forbear all detail. The reason of the intellect blending\r\nwith the reason of the heart, the testimony of history fortified by\r\nthe testimony of good men, an array of unerring figures linked with an\r\narray of unerring facts,--these all I might employ. And I might proceed\r\nto show how this barbarous influence, beginning on the plantation,\r\ndiffuses itself throughout society, enters into official conduct, and\r\neven mounts into Congress, where for a long time it has exercised a\r\nvulgar domination, trampling not only on all the amenities of debate,\r\nbut absolutely on Parliamentary Law. I shall not open this chapter.\r\n\r\nThere is one frightful circumstance, unhappily of frequent occurrence,\r\nwhich proclaims so clearly the character of the social system bred\r\nby Slavery, that I shall be pardoned for adducing it. I refer to\r\nthe roasting of slaves alive at the stake. One was roasted very\r\nrecently,--not after public trial, according to the forms of law, as\r\nat the fires of Smithfield, but by a lawless crowd, suddenly assembled,\r\nwho in this way made themselves ministers of a cruel vengeance. This\r\nBarbarism, which seems to have become part of the customary Law of\r\nSlavery, may well cover us all with humiliation, when we reflect that\r\nit is already renounced by the copper-colored savages of our continent,\r\nwhile during the present century more instances of it have occurred\r\namong our Slave-Masters than we know among the former since that early\r\nday when Captain Smith was saved from sacrifice by the tenderness\r\nof Pocahontas. Perhaps no other usage reveals with such fearful\r\ndistinctness the deep-seated, pervading influence of Slavery, offensive\r\nto Civilization, hostile to Law itself, by virtue of which it pretends\r\nto live, insulting to humanity, shocking to decency, and utterly\r\nheedless of all rights, forms, or observances, in the maintenance of\r\nits wicked power. Here I add, that the proportion of slave to free is\r\nnot without influence in determining treatment. Fear is a constant\r\ntyrant, with an inhumanity which does not tire or sleep, and nothing\r\ncan quicken its cruelty more than the dread of vengeance for the\r\nmultitudinous wrong done to the slave.\r\n\r\nI would not be unjust to Slave-Masters. Some there are, I doubt not,\r\nof happy natures, uncorrupted by the possession of tyrannical power,\r\nwho render the condition of their slaves endurable, and in private\r\nvirtues emulate the graces of Civilization; but the good in these cases\r\ncomes from the masters, _notwithstanding_ Slavery. And, besides, there\r\nare the great examples of the Fathers, who, looking down upon Slavery\r\nand regarding it as an Evil, were saved from its contamination. To\r\nall these I render heartfelt homage. But their exceptional virtues\r\ncannot save the essential wrong which I expose. Nor am I blinded by\r\nthe blandishments of that wealth which is the fruit of Slavery. With\r\nabhorrence we read of the scandalous man-traffic by which a Hessian\r\nprince of Germany sold his subjects to be used by George the Third\r\nagainst our fathers; and we share the contempt expressed by Frederick,\r\nsurnamed the Great, when he levied on these victims, passing through\r\nhis dominions, the customary toll for so many head of cattle, since,\r\nas he said, they had been sold as such; and even now the traveller\r\nturns with disgust from the pleasant slopes of the ducal garden which\r\nwas adorned by these unholy gains.[159] But all this, and more, must\r\nbe renewed in our minds, when we think of American Slavery, with the\r\nhouses and gardens decorated by its sweat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, fellow-citizens, is Slavery, as manifest in its law, and also in\r\nits influence on society. Bad as it is, if it modestly kept at home,\r\nif it did not stalk into the National jurisdiction and enter into the\r\nNational Government, _within reach of our votes_, I should not summon\r\nyou on this occasion to unite against it; for, whatever the promptings\r\nof sympathy and of godlike philanthropy, nothing is clearer than that\r\nour political duties depend simply upon our political responsibilities;\r\nand since we are not politically responsible for Slavery in Charleston,\r\nor in Constantinople, so in neither place have we any political duties\r\nin regard to it. Lament it, wherever it exists, we must, and surround\r\nits victims with our prayers; but our action, while inspired by these\r\nsentiments, must rest within the bounds of Law and Constitution.\r\n\r\nHere the field is ample. Indeed, if Slavery existed nowhere within\r\nthe national jurisdiction, our duty would still be urgent to grapple\r\nwith that pernicious influence, which, through an _Oligarchical\r\nCombination_ of Slave-Masters, unknown to the Constitution, never\r\nanticipated by its founders, and in defiance of their example, has\r\nentered into and possessed the National Government, like an Evil\r\nSpirit. This influence, which, wielding at will all the powers of the\r\nNational Government, even those of the Judiciary, has become formidable\r\nto Freedom everywhere, clutching violently at the Territories, and\r\nmenacing the Free States,--as witness the claim, still undecided in\r\nthe court of the last resort, so audaciously presented by a citizen\r\nof Virginia, to hold slaves in New York on the way to Texas; this\r\ninfluence, now so vaulting, was for a long time unobserved, even\r\nwhile exercising a controlling power. At first timid and shy, from\r\nundoubted sense of guilt, it avoided discussion, yet was determined\r\nin its policy. The Southern Senator who boasted that for sixty years\r\nthe Slave States had governed the country knew well their constant\r\ninferiority to the Free States in population, wealth, manufactures,\r\ncommerce, schools, churches, libraries, and all the activities of\r\na true Civilization,--knew well that they had contributed nothing\r\nto the literature of the country, even in Political Economy and the\r\nscience of Government, which they have so vehemently professed, except\r\nthe now forgotten “forty bale theory,”[160]--knew well that by no\r\nprinciple of justice could this long predominance be explained; but\r\nhe forgot to confess the secret agency. Though unseen, Slavery was\r\npresent always with decisive influence. No matter what the question,\r\nit was the same. Once the Free States inclined to Free Trade, but the\r\nSlave States went the other way; but when the former inclined towards\r\nProtection, the Slave Power in the dark behind dictated Free Trade, and\r\nso it has been till now. Here is the subtle ruling influence, against\r\nwhich population, wealth, manufactures, commerce, schools, churches,\r\nlibraries, and all the activities of a true Civilization are impotent.\r\nThe Slave Power is always master, and it is this Power which for sixty\r\nyears, according to the boast of the Senator, has governed this broad\r\nand growing country, doing what it pleases, and penetrating far-away\r\nplaces, while it sacrifices all who will not do its bidding.\r\n\r\nThe actual number of slaveholders was for a long time unknown, and\r\non this account was naturally exaggerated. It was often represented\r\nvery great. On one occasion, a distinguished representative from\r\nMassachusetts, whose name will be ever cherished for devotion to\r\nHuman Rights,--I mean the late Horace Mann,--was rudely interrupted\r\non the floor of Congress by a member from Alabama, who averred that\r\nthe number of slaveholders was as many as three millions.[161] At\r\nthat time there was no official document by which this extravagance\r\ncould be corrected. But at last we have it. The late census, taken\r\nin 1850, shows that the whole number of this peculiar class, all\r\ntold, so unfortunate as to hold slaves, was only 347,525;[162] and\r\nof this number the larger part are small slaveholders, leaving only\r\n92,000 persons as owners of the great mass of slaves, and substantial\r\nrepresentatives of this class. And yet this small Oligarchy, odious in\r\norigin, without any foundation in that justice which is the essential\r\nbase of every civilized association, stuck together only by confederacy\r\nin all the _five-headed_ wrong of Slavery, and constituting in itself\r\nwhat in other days was called _Magnum Latrocinium_, has, by confession\r\nof one of its own leaders, for sixty years governed the Republic. To\r\nthis end two things have concurred: first, its associated wealth,\r\nbeing the asserted value of its human flesh, constituting a flagitious\r\ncapital of near two thousand millions of dollars; and, secondly, its\r\npeculiar representation in the House of Representatives, where, under\r\nthe three-fifths rule of the Constitution, ninety members actually\r\nhold their seats by virtue in part of this indefensible property.\r\nThus are our Slave-Masters an enormous Corporation, or Joint-Stock\r\nCompany, by the side of which the United States Bank, with its petty\r\nthirty millions of capital, and without any peculiar representation, is\r\ndwarfed into insignificance.\r\n\r\nAll tyranny, like murder, is foul at the best; but this is most foul,\r\nstrange, and unnatural, especially when it is considered that the\r\nStates occupied by the Slave Oligarchy are far below the Free States\r\nin resources of all kinds. By the last census there was in the Free\r\nStates a solid population of freemen amounting to upwards of thirteen\r\nmillions, while in the Slave States there was a like population of\r\nonly six millions. In other respects, important to Civilization, the\r\ndisparity was as great,--all of which I have amply shown elsewhere.\r\nAnd yet from the beginning this Oligarchy has taken the lion’s share\r\namong the honors and trusts of the Republic, while it entered into\r\nand possessed both the old political parties, Whig and Democrat,--as\r\nwitness their servile resolutions always,--making them one in\r\nsubserviency, though double in form, and renewing in them the mystery\r\nof the Siamese twins, which, though separate in body and different\r\nin name, are constrained by an unnatural ligament to a community of\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nI feel humbled, when I dwell on the amazing disproportion of offices\r\nusurped by this Oligarchy. From the beginning, all the great posts of\r\nthe Republic--Presidency, Vice-Presidency, seats in the Cabinet, seats\r\nin the Supreme Court, Presidency of the Senate, Speakership--seem to\r\nbe almost perpetually in their hands. At this moment, the Free States,\r\nwith double the population of the Slave States, have only four out\r\nof nine Justices of the Supreme Court; and of these four, it must\r\nbe said, three are Northern men with Southern principles. And in the\r\nhumbler places at the Departments the same extraordinary disproportion\r\nprevails. Out of the whole number there employed, 787 are from the\r\nSlave States and District of Columbia, and 441 from the Free States,\r\nbut mostly with Southern principles. These instances are typical.\r\nThere is nothing in the National Government which the Oligarchy does\r\nnot appropriate. Down to our day it has held the keys of every office,\r\nfrom President to the humblest postmaster, compelling all to do its\r\nbidding. It makes Cabinets,--organizes Courts,--directs the Army and\r\nNavy,--manages every department of public business,--presides over the\r\nCensus,--conducts the Smithsonian Institution, founded by the generous\r\ncharity of a foreigner to promote the interests of mankind,--and\r\nsubsidizes the national press, alike in the national capital and in the\r\nremotest village of the North.\r\n\r\nMounting the marble steps of the Capitol, it takes the chair of the\r\nPresident of the Senate, also the chair of the Speaker of the House,\r\nthen arranges the Committees of both bodies, placing at their head only\r\nservitors of Slavery, and excluding friends of Freedom, though entitled\r\nto such places by personal character and the States they represent; and\r\nthus it controls the national legislation. From the Capitol to the most\r\ndistant confines, the whole country is enslaved. The Mahometan priest\r\nturns in prayer towards Mecca, his pulpit is on the side which fronts\r\ntowards Mecca, his auditors face towards Mecca. But Slavery is our\r\nMecca, towards which everything turns, everything fronts, everything\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nIn maintaining its power the Slave Oligarchy applies a test for\r\noffice very different from that of Jefferson: “Is he honest? Is he\r\ncapable? Is he faithful to the Constitution?” These things are all\r\nforgotten now in the single question, signalizing the great change\r\nwhich has taken place, “Is he faithful to Slavery?” With arrogant\r\nostracism, it excludes from every national office all who cannot\r\nrespond to this test, thus surrounding and blockading every avenue\r\nof power. So complete and offensive has this tyranny become, that at\r\nthis moment, while I am speaking, could Washington, or Jefferson, or\r\nFranklin, or John Jay, once more descend from his sphere above, to\r\nmingle in our affairs, and bless us with his wisdom, not one of them,\r\nwith his recorded, _unretracted_ opinions on Slavery, could receive\r\na nomination for the Presidency from either fraction of the divided\r\nDemocratic party, or from that other political combination known as\r\nthe Union party,--nor, stranger still, could either of these sainted\r\npatriots, whose names alone open a perpetual fountain of gratitude\r\nin all your hearts, be confirmed by the Senate of the United States\r\nfor any political function whatever, not even for the local office of\r\nPostmaster. What I now say, amid your natural astonishment, I have said\r\noften in addressing the people, and more than once from my seat in the\r\nSenate, and no man there has made answer, for no man who has sat in\r\nits secret sessions, and observed the test practically applied, could\r\nmake answer; and I ask you to accept this statement as my testimony,\r\nderived from the experience which is my lot. Yes, fellow-citizens, had\r\nthis test prevailed in the earlier days, Washington, “first in war,\r\nfirst in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen,” could not have\r\nbeen created Generalissimo of the American forces, Jefferson could\r\nnot have taken his place on the Committee to draft the Declaration\r\nof Independence, and Franklin could not have gone forth to France,\r\nwith the commission of the infant Republic, to secure the invaluable\r\nalliance of that ancient kingdom,--nor could John Jay, as first Chief\r\nJustice, have lent to our judiciary the benignant grace of his name and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nStanding on the bent necks of an enslaved race, with four millions\r\nof human beings as the black marble Caryatides to support its power,\r\nthe Slave Oligarchy erects itself into a lordly caste which brooks no\r\nopposition. But when I speak of Caste, I mean nothing truly polite;\r\nand when I speak of Oligarchy, I mean nothing truly aristocratic.\r\nAs despotism is simply an abuse of monarchy, so Oligarchy is simply\r\nan abuse of aristocracy, unless it be that most vulgar of all,\r\n“aristocracy of the skin.” Derived from Slavery, and having the\r\ninterests of Slavery always in mind, our Oligarchy must naturally take\r\nits character from this _five-headed_ wrong.\r\n\r\n    “Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.”\r\n\r\nAll that is bad in Slavery, its audacity, its immorality, its cruelty,\r\nits robbery, its meanness, its ignorance, its barbarous disregard of\r\nhuman rights, and its barbarous disregard of every obligation, must\r\nall be reproduced in its representative. If the Oligarchy hesitates\r\nat nothing to serve its selfish ends, it simply acts in harmony with\r\nSlavery, from which it draws its life-blood. If in grasp of power it is\r\nlike the hunchback Richard, if in falsehood it copies Iago, and if in\r\ncharacter it is low as the brutish Caliban,\r\n\r\n    “Which any print of goodness will not take,\r\n    Being capable of all ill,”--\r\n\r\nay, if in all these respects it surpasses its various prototypes,--if\r\nin steady baseness, in uniform brutality, and consummate wickedness\r\nit is without a peer, be not astonished, fellow-citizens, for it acts\r\nsimply according to the original law of its birth and the inborn\r\nnecessities of its being. With all these unprecedented qualities and\r\naptitudes combined into one intense activity, it goes where it will and\r\ndoes what it pleases. The Pterodactyl of an early geological period,\r\nformed for all service and every element, with neck of bird, mouth of\r\nreptile, wing of bat, body of mammifer, and with hugest eye, so that\r\nit could seek its prey in the night,--such was the ancient and extinct\r\nkindred of this Oligarchy, which, like Milton’s fiend,\r\n\r\n    “O’er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\r\n    With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,\r\n    And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.”\r\n\r\nThe soul sickens in contemplating the acts of dishonest tyranny\r\nperpetrated by this lordly power. I cannot give their prolonged history\r\nnow. But looking at the old Missouri Compromise, founded on the\r\nadmission of Missouri as a Slave State, and in consideration thereof\r\nthe Prohibition of Slavery in other outlying territory, and seeing\r\nhow, after an acquiescence of thirty-four years, and the irreclaimable\r\npossession by Slavery of its especial share in the provisions of this\r\nCompromise, in violation of every obligation of honor, compact, and\r\ngood neighborhood, and in contemptuous disregard of the outgushing\r\nsentiments of an aroused North, this time-honored Prohibition was\r\noverturned, and the vast region now known as Kansas and Nebraska\r\nopened to Slavery,--looking next at the juggling bill by which this\r\nwas accomplished, declaring that its object was to leave the people\r\n“perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in\r\ntheir own way,” and seeing how, in spite of these express words, the\r\ncourageous settlers there were left a prey to invading hordes from\r\nMissouri, who, entering the Territory, organized a Usurpation which\r\nby positive law proceeded to fasten Slavery upon that beautiful soil,\r\nand to surround it with a code of death, so strict, that the famous\r\nbell which once swung in the steeple over the Hall of Independence\r\nat Philadelphia would be nothing but a nuisance in Kansas, while its\r\nimmortal inscription, “Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land, unto\r\nall the inhabitants thereof,” would be an offence, and the sexton who\r\nrang the bell a criminal,--looking at the Lecompton Constitution,\r\nthat masterpiece of wicked contrivance, by which this same people,\r\nin organizing a State, were fraudulently prevented from passing upon\r\nthe question of Slavery, and seeing how the infamous counterfeit,\r\nthough repudiated by the people, was openly adopted by the President,\r\nand by him corruptly urged upon Congress, with all the power of his\r\nAdministration,--looking at these things, so recent and menacing,\r\nI feel how vain it is to expect truce or compromise with the Slave\r\nOligarchy. Punic in faith, as in fear, no compact can bind it,\r\nwhile all interpretations of the Constitution friendly to Freedom,\r\nthough sanctioned by Court and Congress in continuous precedent, are\r\nunceremoniously rejected. Faust, in the profound poem of Goethe, on\r\nbeing told that in Hell itself the laws prevail, says:--\r\n\r\n    “Now that I like: so, then, one may, in fact,\r\n    Conclude a binding compact with you, gentry!”\r\n\r\nTo which Mephistopheles replies:--\r\n\r\n    “Whatever promise in our books finds entry\r\n    We strictly carry into act.”\r\n\r\nBut no compact or promise binds our gentry, although entered again and\r\nagain in their books.\r\n\r\nAccording to a famous saying, Russia is a “despotism tempered by\r\nassassination”; but even the steel of Brutus, refulgent in the Capitol,\r\nwithout the supplementary fulfilment of the wish of Caligula, that all\r\nshould have a single life, must fail to reach our despotism, which\r\nin numbers enjoys an immunity beyond any solitary tyrant. Surely, if\r\nthe Oligarchy is to live yet longer, its badges should symbolize its\r\npeculiar despotism born of Slavery. The coin, seal, and flag must be\r\nchanged. Let the eagle be removed, giving place to the foul vulture\r\nwith vulgar beak and filthy claw,--how unlike that bird of Jove, with\r\nample pinion, and those mighty pounces, holding the dread thunderbolt\r\nand better olive of peace!--and instead of these, let there be fetter\r\nand lash, borrowed from the plantation, which is the miniature of the\r\nbroader plantation to which the Republic is reduced. That appearance\r\nmay be according to reality, and that we may not seem what we are not,\r\nthis at least must be done. Abandon, too, the stars and stripes,--the\r\nstars numbering the present Union, the stripes numbering that Union\r\nwhich gave to mankind the Declaration of Independence with immortal\r\ntruth; and let these also be replaced by the universal fetter and lash,\r\nfor here is typified our Oligarchy, in all present power, as in all\r\nvital principle. Fetter and lash! The schoolboy shall grow up honoring\r\nthe chosen emblems; the citizen shall hail them with sympathetic pride;\r\nthe Republic shall be known by them on coin, seal, and flag; while\r\nthe ruler of the subjugated land, no longer President, shall be called\r\nOverseer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course, fellow-citizens, you are now ready to see that the\r\ncorruptions by which the present Administration is degraded are the\r\nnatural offspring of slaveholding immorality. They have all concurred\r\nin sustaining the policy of the Oligarchy, and in the case of the\r\nLecompton Constitution in direct effort to fasten Slavery upon a\r\ndistant Territory, and they are all marked by the effrontery of\r\nSlavery. There is also its vulgarity; but this is natural; for is not\r\npretension a fruitful source of vulgarity? and, pray, what is Slavery,\r\nbut an enormous Pretension? Smollett attributes the peculiar profligacy\r\nof England at a particular period to the demoralization of the South\r\nSea Bubble; but what is such a fugitive influence, compared with\r\nSlavery, which, indeed, if it were not a crime, might well be called a\r\nBubble? A Government which vindicates the sale of human beings need not\r\nhesitate to purchase votes, whether at the polls or in Congress. The\r\ntwo transactions belong to the same family, though unquestionably the\r\nlast is the least reprehensible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens,--And now we are brought to the practical bearing of\r\nthis statement. Beyond all doubt your souls rise in judgment against\r\nthese things. Beyond all doubt you are saddened at the shadow which\r\nthey cast over the land. Beyond all doubt you are unwilling to bear any\r\nresponsibility for their longer continuance. But this is not enough.\r\nThere must be opposition, active, constant, perpetual; and this is the\r\nforemost duty of patriotism. From the virtuous Reformer, Wycliffe,\r\nwhose name illumines the earlier period of English history, we learn\r\nthat men are sharers in evil deeds who from “coward dumbness” fail\r\nto oppose them. There can be no such coward dumbness now. Happily, a\r\npolitical party is at hand whose purpose is to combine and direct all\r\ngenerous energies for the salvation of the country.\r\n\r\nWould you arrest these terrible corruptions, and the disastrous\r\ninfluence from which they spring, involving nothing less than\r\ncivilization on this continent, the Republican party tells you how,\r\nand, in telling you how, vindicates at once its Origin and its\r\nNecessity. The work must be done, and there is no other organization by\r\nwhich it can be done. A party with such an origin and such a necessity\r\ncannot be for a day, or for this election only. It cannot be less\r\npermanent than the hostile influence which it is formed to counteract.\r\nTherefore, just so long as the present false theories of Slavery\r\nprevail, whether concerning its character, morally, economically,\r\nand socially, or concerning its prerogatives under the Constitution,\r\nand just so long as the Slave Oligarchy, which is the sleepless and\r\nunhesitating agent of Slavery in all its pretensions, continues to\r\nexist as a political power, the Republican party must endure. If bad\r\nmen conspire for Slavery, good men must combine for Freedom; nor can\r\nthe Holy War be ended, until the Barbarism now dominant in the Republic\r\nis overthrown, and the Pagan power is driven from our Jerusalem.\r\nAnd when this triumph is won, securing the immediate object of our\r\norganization, the Republican party will not die, but, purified by long\r\ncontest with Slavery, and filled with higher life, it will be lifted\r\nto yet other efforts for the good of man.\r\n\r\nAt present the work is plain before us. It is simply to elect\r\nour candidates: Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, whose ability, so\r\nconspicuously shown in his own State, attracted at once the admiration\r\nof the whole country, whose character no breath has touched, and\r\nwhose heart is large enough to embrace the broad Republic and all its\r\npeople,--him you will elect President; and Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine,\r\nwhose clear head, firm principles, and ample experience none who\r\nsit with him in the Senate Chamber can contest,--him you will elect\r\nVice-President. Electing these, we shall put the National Government,\r\nat least in its Executive department, openly and actively on the side\r\nof Freedom; and this alone will be of incalculable influence, not only\r\nin itself, but as harbinger of the Future.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we shall save the Territories from the five-headed\r\nBarbarism of Slavery, keeping them in their normal condition, as they\r\ncame from the hand of God, free,--with Freedom written on the soil\r\nand engraved on the rock, while the winds whisper it in the trees,\r\nthe rivers murmur it in their flow, and all Nature echoes it in joy\r\nunspeakable.\r\n\r\nNext, we shall save the country and the age from that crying infamy,\r\nthe Slave-Trade, whose opening anew, as now menaced, is but a logical\r\nconsequence of the new theories of Slavery. If Slavery be the\r\n“blessing” it is vaunted, then must the Slave-Trade be beneficent,\r\nwhile they who ply it with fiercest activity take place among the\r\nmissionaries and saints of humanity.\r\n\r\nNext, we shall save the Constitution, at least within the sphere\r\nof Executive influence, from outrage and perversion; so that the\r\nPresident will no longer lend himself to that wildest pretension of\r\nthe Slave Oligarchy, as Mr. Buchanan has done, declaring that Slavery\r\nis carried under the Constitution into all the Territories, and that\r\nit now exists in Kansas as firmly as in South Carolina. As out of\r\nnothing can come nothing, so out of the nothing in the Constitution on\r\nthis subject can be derived no support for this inordinate pretension,\r\nwhich may be best dismissed in that classical similitude by which the\r\nancients rebuked a groundless folly, when they called it _ass’s wool_,\r\nor something that does not exist, and plainly said to its author,\r\n_Asini lanas quæris_,--“You are in quest of ass’s wool!”[163]\r\n\r\nNext, we shall help save the Declaration of Independence, now\r\ndishonored and disowned in its essential, life-giving truth,--_the\r\nEquality of Men_. This transcendent principle, which appears twice\r\nat the Creation, first, when God said, “Let us make man in our\r\nimage,” and, secondly, in the Unity of the Race, then divinely\r\nestablished,--which appears again in the New Testament, when it was\r\nsaid, “God, that made the world and all things therein, hath made of\r\none blood all nations of men,”--which appears again in the primal\r\nreason of the world, anterior to all institutions and laws,--belongs\r\nto those self-evident truths, sometimes called axioms, which no man\r\ncan question without exposing to question his own intelligence or\r\nhonesty. As well deny arithmetically that two and two make four, or\r\ndeny geometrically that a straight line is the shortest distance\r\nbetween two points, as deny the axiomatic, self-evident, beaming\r\ntruth, that all men are equal. As of the sun in the heavens, blind\r\nis he who cannot perceive it. Of course, this principle, uttered in\r\na Declaration of Rights, is applicable simply to rights; and it is\r\na childish sophism to allege against it the obvious inequalities of\r\nform, character, and faculties. As axiom, it admits no exception; for\r\nit is the essence of an axiom, whether in geometry or in morals, to be\r\nuniversal. As abstract truth, it is also without exception, according\r\nto the essence of such truth. And, finally, as self-evident truth,\r\nso announced in the Declaration, it is without exception; for only\r\nsuch truth can be self-evident. Thus, whether axiom, abstract truth,\r\nor self-evident truth, it is always universal. In vindicating this\r\nprinciple, the Republican party have a grateful duty, to which they are\r\nmoved by justice to a much-injured race, excluded from its protection,\r\nand by justice also to the Fathers, whose well-chosen words, fit\r\nfoundation for empire, are turned into mockery. Nor can the madness\r\nof the Propagandists be better illustrated than in this assault on\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, stultifying the Fathers for no other\r\npurpose than to clear the way for their five-headed abomination of\r\n_Compulsory Labor without Wages_.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, we shall help expel the Slave Oligarchy from all its\r\nseats of National power, driving it back within the States. This alone\r\nis worthy of every effort; for, until this is done, nothing else can\r\nbe completely done. In vain you seek economy or purity in the National\r\nGovernment, in vain you seek improvement of rivers and harbors, in\r\nvain you seek homesteads on the public lands for actual settlers, in\r\nvain you seek reform in administration, in vain you seek dignity and\r\npeace in our foreign relations, with just sympathy for struggling\r\nFreedom everywhere, while this selfish and corrupt power holds the\r\nNational purse and the National sword. Prostrate the Slave Oligarchy,\r\nand the door will be open to all generous principles. Prostrate the\r\nSlave Oligarchy, and the wickedness of the Fugitive Slave Bill will\r\nbe expelled from the statute-book. Prostrate the Slave Oligarchy,\r\nand Slavery will cease at once in the National Capital. Prostrate\r\nthe Slave Oligarchy, and the Slave-Trade will no longer skulk along\r\nour coasts beneath the National flag. Prostrate the Slave Oligarchy,\r\nand Liberty will become, in fact, as in law, the normal condition of\r\nall the National Territories. Prostrate the Slave Oligarchy, and the\r\nNational Government will be at length divorced from Slavery. Prostrate\r\nthe Slave Oligarchy, and the National star will be changed from Slavery\r\nto Freedom. Prostrate the Slave Oligarchy, and the North will be no\r\nlonger the vassal of the South. Prostrate the Slave Oligarchy, and the\r\nNorth will be admitted to its just share in the trusts and honors of\r\nthe Republic. Prostrate the Slave Oligarchy, and a mighty victory of\r\nPeace will be won, whose influence on the Future of our country and of\r\nmankind no imagination can paint.\r\n\r\nProstrated, exposed, and permanently expelled from ill-gotten power,\r\nthe Oligarchy will cease to exist as a political combination. Its final\r\ndoom may be postponed, but it is certain. Languishing, it may live yet\r\nlonger; but it will surely die. Yes, fellow-citizens, surely it will\r\ndie, when, disappointed in purpose, driven back within the States, and\r\nconstrained within these limits, it can no longer rule the Republic as\r\na plantation of slaves at home, can no longer menace the Territories\r\nwith five-headed device to compel _Labor without Wages_, can no longer\r\nfasten upon the Constitution an interpretation which makes merchandise\r\nof men and gives disgraceful immunity to brokers of human souls and\r\nbutchers of human hearts, and can no longer grind flesh and blood, with\r\ngroans and sighs, tears of mothers and cries of children, into the\r\ncement of a barbarous political power. Surely, then, in its retreat,\r\nsmarting under the indignation of an aroused people and the concurring\r\njudgment of the civilized world, it must die,--it may be as a poisoned\r\nrat dies of rage in its hole.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all good omens are ours. The work cannot stop. Quickened\r\nby the triumph now so near, with a Republican President in power,\r\nState after State, quitting the condition of a Territory and spurning\r\nSlavery, will be welcomed into our Plural Unit, and, joining hands\r\ntogether, will become a belt of fire girt about the Slave States,\r\nwithin which Slavery must die,--or, happier still, joining hands\r\ntogether, they will become to the Slave States a zone of Freedom,\r\nradiant, like the ancient cestus of Beauty, with transforming power.\r\n\r\nIt only remains that we speed these good influences. Others may dwell\r\non the Past as secure; but to my mind, under the laws of a beneficent\r\nGod, _the Future also is secure_,--on the single condition that we\r\npress forward in the work with heart and soul, forgetting self, turning\r\nfrom all temptations of the hour, and, intent only on the cause,\r\n\r\n    “With mean complacence ne’er betray our trust,\r\n    Nor be so civil as to prove unjust.”[164]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR CANDIDATES WILL BE ELECTED.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE LINCOLN AND HAMLIN CLUB OF OWEGO, NEW YORK, JULY 30, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          BOSTON, July 30, 1860.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,--It is still uncertain whether my engagements here and\r\n  elsewhere will allow me to visit Tioga County during the present\r\n  season. But I beg to assure the Republicans there of my sympathy\r\n  in their generous labors.\r\n\r\n  There is ample reward simply in working for a good cause; but we\r\n  have before us, also, the assurance that our candidates will be\r\n  elected.\r\n\r\n  Accept my thanks for the honor of your invitation, and believe\r\n  me, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      With much respect,\r\n\r\n          Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n              CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  ISAAC S. CATLIN, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMANCIPATION IN THE BRITISH WEST INDIES A BLESSING, AND NOT A FAILURE.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A PUBLIC MEETING AT FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS, JULY 30, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          BOSTON, July 30, 1860.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--If I forego the opportunity which you offer me\r\n  of uniting with the earnest Abolitionists of Massachusetts in\r\n  celebrating the anniversary of Emancipation in the British\r\n  Islands of the West Indies, I pray you not to believe me\r\n  insensible to the magnanimous teachings of that day,--destined, I\r\n  doubt not, as men advance in virtue, to take its place yet more\r\n  and more among the great days of History.\r\n\r\n  Nothing shows the desperate mendacity of the partisans of Slavery\r\n  more than the unfounded persistence with which they call this act\r\n  “a failure.” If it be a failure, then is virtue a failure, then\r\n  is justice a failure, then is humanity a failure, then is God\r\n  himself a failure; for virtue, justice, humanity, and God himself\r\n  are all represented in this act.\r\n\r\n  Well-proved facts vindicate completely the policy of\r\n  Emancipation, even if it were not commanded by the simplest rules\r\n  of morality. All testimony, whether from official documents or\r\n  from travellers, shows, beyond question, that in these islands\r\n  the condition of the negro is improved by emancipation; but this\r\n  testimony is especially instructive, when we learn that the\r\n  improvement is most strongly manifest in those who have been\r\n  born in Freedom. Ask any person familiar with these islands,--as\r\n  I have often done,--or consult any unprejudiced authority, and\r\n  such will be the answer. This alone is enough to vindicate the\r\n  act. Moreover, it is enough, if _men_ are raised in the scale of\r\n  being, even though sugar perishes from the earth.\r\n\r\n  But careful statistics attest that the material interests of\r\n  these possessions share the improvement of the population. In\r\n  some of the islands, as in Barbadoes and Antigua, the advance is\r\n  conspicuous, while in Jamaica itself, which is the instance most\r\n  constantly cited of “failure,” the evidence is unanswerable, that\r\n  the derangement of affairs cannot be charged upon Emancipation,\r\n  but is a natural incident to the anomalous condition of that\r\n  island throughout its history, aggravated by insane pretensions\r\n  of the Slave-Masters. Two different Governors of this island[165]\r\n  have assured me, that, with all their experience there, they\r\n  looked upon Emancipation as a “blessing.” Thus is it shown that\r\n  the true policy of this world is found in justice. Nothing is\r\n  truer than that injustice, beside its essential wickedness, is\r\n  folly also. The unjust man is a fool.\r\n\r\n  Only recently important testimony on this subject has found\r\n  place, where it would be hardly expected, in the columns of the\r\n  “New York Times”; and similar testimony occurs in other quarters,\r\n  both in England and America. And yet, with the truth flashing\r\n  in their faces, our Slave-Masters misrepresent the sublime and\r\n  beautiful act as a “failure”! This, however, is of a piece with\r\n  their whole conduct.\r\n\r\n  Let me thank you for the invitation with which you have honored\r\n  me, and for the good wishes with which you cheer me; and believe\r\n  me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n          CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY A BARBAROUS DISEASE TO BE STAYED.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A REPUBLICAN MEETING AT THE DEDICATION OF THE REPUBLICAN\r\nWIGWAM IN NEW YORK, AUGUST 6, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          BOSTON, August 6, 1860.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN,--Accept my thanks for the invitation with which you\r\n  have honored me. Knowing by recent experience something of the\r\n  generous Republicans of New York, it is with reluctance that I\r\n  renounce the opportunity you give me of mingling with them on an\r\n  interesting occasion.\r\n\r\n  As citizens of a great metropolis, they have duties of peculiar\r\n  difficulty. It is in these centres that the Proslavery sentiment\r\n  of the North shows itself with violence often kindred to\r\n  that of the plantation, so as almost to justify the language\r\n  of Jefferson, who called great cities “sores” of the body\r\n  politic.[166] Even this expression does not seem too strong, when\r\n  we recognize the infection of Slavery breaking out sometimes in\r\n  the violence of mobs, and constantly manifest in the press, in\r\n  public speech, and in a corrupt public sentiment. It belongs to\r\n  the Republican party, by gentle, healing influences, guided by a\r\n  firm hand, to inaugurate the work of _cure_, that health may be\r\n  substituted for disease.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile the wretched disease must be understood, and I venture\r\n  to call attention to a work just published in New York, where\r\n  it is exposed with consummate ability: I refer to “Slavery in\r\n  History,” by Adam Gurowski. The learned author, who vindicates\r\n  his new title as American citizen by noble effort for the good\r\n  of his adopted country, exhibits Slavery, from the beginning of\r\n  time, in all nations and places, as nothing more nor less than a\r\n  monstrosity, disturbing, corrupting, and debasing the government\r\n  under which it exists, and all the individuals who are parties to\r\n  it, directly or indirectly: for no man can sustain Slavery, or in\r\n  any way apologize for it, without suffering in moral, if not also\r\n  in intellectual nature. Such a work, founded on careful studies,\r\n  and executed in the spirit of science, will naturally take a\r\n  place in libraries; but I am sure that all inquirers into the\r\n  character of Slavery, and especially all practical Republicans,\r\n  engaged in efforts to stay the spread of this barbarous disease,\r\n  ought to welcome it as an ally. No good citizen who makes himself\r\n  acquainted with Slavery can hesitate to join against it.\r\n\r\n  Accept my best wishes for the success of your festival, and also\r\n  the assurance of the respect with which\r\n\r\n      I have the honor to be, Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n          Your obliged Servant,\r\n\r\n              CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\n  HOMER FRANKLIN, ABRAHAM W. KENNEDY, W. K. SCHENCK, Esqrs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIBUTE TO A COLLEGE CLASSMATE.\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THE LATE JOHN W. BROWNE, AUGUST 20, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Browne died suddenly, May 1st, 1860. A little volume was\r\n    printed in the summer, entitled “In Memoriam J. W. B.,” to\r\n    which Mr. Sumner contributed the following notice. Prefixed\r\n    were the words of Fénelon:--\r\n\r\n        “Il n’y a que les grands cœurs qui sachent combien il y a\r\n        de gloire à être bon.”\r\n\r\nI should feel unhappy, if this little book of tribute to my\r\nearly friend were allowed to appear without a word from me. We\r\nwere classmates in college, and for two out of the four years of\r\nundergraduate life were chums. We were also together in the Law School.\r\nPerhaps no person now alive knew him better, during all this period.\r\nSeparated afterwards by the occupations of the world, I saw him only\r\nat intervals, though our friendship continued unbroken to the end,\r\nand when we met, it was always with the warmth and confidence of our\r\nyouthful relations.\r\n\r\nOf all my classmates, I think that he gave, in college, the largest\r\npromise of future eminence, mingled, however, with uncertainty whether\r\nthe waywardness of genius might not betray him. None then imagined that\r\nthe fiery nature, nursed upon the study of Byron, and delighting always\r\nto talk of his poetry and life, would be tamed to the modest ways\r\nwhich he afterwards adopted. The danger seemed to be, that, like his\r\nprototype, he would break loose from social life, and follow the bent\r\nof lawless ambition, or at least plunge with passion into the strifes\r\nof the world. His earnestness at this time bordered on violence, and in\r\nall his opinions he was a partisan. But he was already thinker as well\r\nas reader, and expressed himself with accuracy and sententious force.\r\nVoice harmonizes with character, and his was too apt to be ungentle and\r\nloud.\r\n\r\nThey who have known him only latterly will be surprised at this glimpse\r\nof him in early life. A change so complete in sentiment, manner, and\r\nvoice, as took place in him, I have never known. It seemed like one\r\nof those instances in Christian story, where the man of violence is\r\nsoftened suddenly into a saintly character. I do not exaggerate in\r\nthe least. So much have I been impressed by it at times, that I could\r\nhardly believe in his personal identity, and I have recalled the good\r\nFra Cristoforo, in the exquisite romance of Manzoni, to prove that the\r\nsimplest life of unostentatious goodness may succeed a youth hot with\r\npassion of all kinds.\r\n\r\nTo me, who knew him so well in his other moods, it was touching in the\r\nextreme to note this change. Listening to his voice, now so gentle\r\nand low, while he conversed on the duties of life, and with perfect\r\nsimplicity revealed his own abnegation of worldly aims, I have been\r\nfilled with reverence. At these times his conversation was peculiar and\r\ninstructive. He had thought for himself, and expressed what he said\r\nwith all his native force refined by new-born sweetness of soul, which\r\nwould have commended sentiments even of less intrinsic interest. I saw\r\nhow, in the purity of his nature, he turned aside from riches and from\r\nambition of all kinds, content with a tranquil existence, undisturbed\r\nby any of those temptations which promised once to exercise such sway\r\nover him. But his opinions, while uttered with modesty, were marked by\r\nthe hardihood of an original thinker, showing that in him\r\n\r\n                      “the Gods had joined\r\n    The mildest manners and the bravest mind.”\r\n\r\nHis firm renunciation of office, opening the way to a tempting\r\npolitical career, when formally tendered to him, is almost unique. He\r\nhad been Representative from Lynn, in the Legislature of Massachusetts,\r\nand was nominated as Senator for Essex. This was long ago, in 1838,\r\nwhile he was yet a young man; and here his sagacity seemed to be\r\nremarkable as his principles. At that early day, when the two old\r\npolitical parties had been little criticised, he announced that their\r\nstrife was “occasional and temporary, and that both had forgotten or\r\noverlooked the great principle of equal liberty for all, upon which a\r\nfree government must rest as its only true and safe basis.” He then\r\nproceeded to dissolve his connection with parties, in words worthy of\r\nperpetual memory. “I disconnect myself from party,” he said, “whose\r\niron grasp holds hard even upon the least of us, and mean in my little\r\nsphere, as a private individual, to serve what seems to me the cause\r\nof the country and humanity. I cannot place currency above liberty. I\r\ncannot place money above man. I cannot fight heartily for the Whigs\r\nand against their opponents, when I feel, that, whichever shall be\r\nthe victorious party, the claims of humanity will be forgotten in\r\nthe triumph, and that the rights of the slave may be crushed beneath\r\nthe advancing hosts of the victors.”[167] No better words have\r\nbeen uttered in our political history. In this spirit, and with his\r\nunquestionable abilities, he might well have acted an important part in\r\nthe growing conflict with Slavery. But his love of retreat grew also,\r\nand he shrank completely from all the activities of political life.\r\nThere was nothing that was not within his reach; but he could not be\r\ntempted.\r\n\r\nI cannot disguise that at times I was disposed to criticise this\r\nwithdrawal, as suggesting too closely the questionable philosophy\r\nconcentrated in the saying, _Bene vixit qui bene latuit_. But as often\r\nas I came within the sphere of his influence, and felt the simple\r\nbeauty of his life, while I saw how his soul, like the sensitive leaf,\r\nclosed at the touch of the world, I was willing to believe that he had\r\nchosen wisely for himself, or at all events that his course was founded\r\non a system deliberately adopted, upon which even an old friend must\r\nnot intrude. Having always the greatest confidence in his resources,\r\nintellectual as well as moral, I was never without hope that in some\r\nway he would make his mark upon his country and his age. If he has not\r\ndone this, he has at least left an example precious to all who knew\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND THE ISSUES.\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT THE STATE CONVENTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT WORCESTER,\r\nAUGUST 29, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This Convention was organized by the choice of the following\r\n    officers:--\r\n\r\n    President,--George S.

Andrew was for the first time\r\n    nominated as Governor.\r\n\r\n    The Convention had more than its annual importance, as it was\r\n    on the eve of a Presidential election. Abraham Lincoln, of\r\n    Illinois, and Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine, were the Republican\r\n    candidates for President and Vice-President; John C.\r\n    Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and Joseph Lane, of Oregon, the\r\n    Democratic candidates; Stephen H. Douglas, of Illinois, and\r\n    Herschell V. Johnson, of Georgia, the candidates of a seceding\r\n    body of Democrats, known as the Douglas party; John Bell, of\r\n    Tennessee, and Edward Everett, of Massachusetts, candidates of\r\n    old Whigs, called at the time the Bell-Everett party.\r\n\r\n    On motion of J. D. Baldwin, of Worcester, afterwards\r\n    Representative in Congress, Mr. Sumner was invited to address\r\n    the Convention. The report says:--\r\n\r\n        “Mr. Sumner then came forward, and his appearance upon\r\n        the platform was hailed with enthusiastic shouts,\r\n        which testified the esteem and admiration in which the\r\n        distinguished Senator is held by his fellow-Republicans of\r\n        the Commonwealth. The cheering was continued some minutes,\r\n        and when it had subsided, Mr. Sumner proceeded to address\r\n        the crowded assembly,--the vast hall being filled to\r\n        overflowing.”\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--It is now six years since I had the honor of meeting my\r\nRepublican fellow-citizens of Massachusetts in State Convention, drawn\r\ntogether from all parts of our beloved Commonwealth,--and then also,\r\nI remember well, it was at this good city of Worcester. Returning, at\r\nlast, with restored health, to the activities of public life, I am\r\nhappy again in this opportunity. It is pleasant to look into the faces\r\nof friends, and to feel the sympathy of kindred hearts.\r\n\r\nNor can I disguise the satisfaction which I find at being here in\r\nWorcester,--early and constant home of the Republican cause. When other\r\nplaces, even in Massachusetts, were indifferent for Freedom, Worcester\r\nwas earnest; and when the cause was defeated in other counties,\r\nhere, under the lead of an eminent citizen, now the ornament of the\r\nbench,[168] it triumphed by brilliant majorities; so that Worcester\r\nbecame known, not only throughout Massachusetts, but everywhere,\r\nthroughout the country, as our impregnable stronghold. Long since,\r\nwhile America was yet an unsettled wilderness, an English poet depicted\r\na county of our motherland as\r\n\r\n    “That shire which we _the heart of England_ well may call”;[169]\r\n\r\nand this ancient verse furnishes a descriptive phrase which has been\r\naptly applied to our Worcester, “the heart,” as it is the central\r\ncounty, of the Commonwealth. But though truly belonging to Worcester\r\non this account, I have always been glad to believe that it only\r\njustly depicted her as the “heart” of our cause,--here at least in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this cause were of common political interest, if it turned only\r\non some question of mere policy, or if it involved simply the honors\r\nand emoluments of office, I should willingly leave the contest to\r\nothers. It would have little attraction for me. But it is far above\r\nthese things. It concerns the permanent well-being, primarily, of all\r\nthe outlying territories of the Republic, broad enough for empires,\r\nnow menaced by Slavery; and since one part of the body cannot suffer\r\nwithout all being affected, it concerns the permanent well-being\r\nand also the good name of the whole country, clouded by the growing\r\ninfluence of Slavery. Nor is this all. The special motive for the\r\nproposed extension of Slavery is to fortify the Slave Power in the\r\nSenate of the United States, and, through the assured preponderance of\r\nthis Power there, to control the National Government in legislation,\r\ndiplomacy, and the distribution of office, so that, in short, no\r\nlaw can be passed, no treaty can be ratified, and no individual,\r\nthough possessing all possible fitness for public service, can be\r\nconfirmed for office of any kind, without the consent of the Slave\r\nPower,--thus, through the Senate, controlling the Judiciary itself.\r\nSeeking, therefore, by active measures,--I say active and immediate\r\nmeasures,--to save the Territories, you seek also to save the whole\r\ncountry, not only from a deadly influence, but also from a degrading\r\nrule, which ostracizes from office all who avow the early opinions of\r\nthe Fathers.\r\n\r\nSuch is our cause, nakedly stated, without illustration or argument.\r\nStrange that it is not recognized at once by every patriot heart!\r\nStrange that we should be compelled to vindicate it, sometimes against\r\nopen foes, and sometimes--harder still--against others who betray it\r\nwith a kiss!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the coming election this cause has its representative in Abraham\r\nLincoln. And why has he been selected? Not solely because he is a\r\npopular favorite in the great Northwest,--of blameless life, of\r\nunimpeachable integrity, of acknowledged abilities, and of practical\r\ntalent, all of which are unquestionable recommendations, shared,\r\nhowever, by many others,--but because he had made himself the\r\ndetermined champion of the Prohibition of Slavery in the Territories,\r\nstating the case with knowledge, with moderation, and yet with\r\nfirmness,--avowing openly his hatred of Slavery,--likening its\r\nintroduction in the Territories now to the Canada thistle, which a few\r\nmay plant to the detriment of succeeding generations, and then again to\r\nsnakes deposited in the cradle of an infant,--and especially exposing\r\nthe dishonest invention of “Squatter Sovereignty,” which would despoil\r\nCongress of all power over this subject, and transfer it to the distant\r\nhandful of first settlers.\r\n\r\nOn two different occasions his views have been put forth and\r\ndeveloped,--first, in elaborate controversy with Mr. Douglas in\r\nIllinois, and, secondly, in his well-known speech at the Cooper\r\nInstitute, New York. He does not need my praise; nor would I step aside\r\nfrom my argument to praise anybody; but I may fitly call attention\r\nto this masterly address, which, in careful research, clearness of\r\nstatement, and directness of purpose, may well compare with any one of\r\nthe innumerable speeches ever made concerning the power of Congress\r\nover the Territories. On the topic it professes to treat it is a\r\nmonograph. Perhaps it is not too much to say that the effort was needed\r\nin establishing his title to that public confidence which made him our\r\ncandidate. It is for the Prohibition of Slavery in the Territories that\r\nhe has labored, and, excepting his brief, but honorable, experience in\r\nCongress, his public life may be summed up in this single service,--nor\r\nmore nor less. The magnitude of the service may be measured by his\r\npresent position as representative of our cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArrayed in opposition are three other candidates for the\r\nPresidency,--Bell, Breckinridge, and Douglas,--I mention them in\r\nalphabetical order,--differing superficially among themselves, but\r\nall concurring in friendship for Slavery and in withstanding its\r\nprohibition anywhere, with followers ready, in warfare against the\r\nRepublican party, to coalesce or fuse with each other. In this\r\nreadiness you see the common antagonism. No person in the Republican\r\nparty can think of coalition or fusion with either of these three\r\nparties; for they each and all represent in some form resistance to the\r\nProhibition of Slavery, and therefore must be opposed, each and all.\r\nThe whole trio are no better than Mrs. Malaprop’s idea of Cerberus,\r\n“three gentlemen at once,” and must be encountered together.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking at them separately, there is, first, the Bell party. Pardon\r\nme, if I use names familiarly: it is but for the sake of convenience.\r\nThis party, known among us only by its boasts, draws its practical\r\nsupport from the Slave States. It is a Proslavery party,--essentially\r\nhostile to the Prohibition of Slavery in the Territories, and dealing\r\nalways in treacherous generalities, which, if they have any meaning,\r\nmean Slavery,--exalting the Constitution, as Slave-Masters understand\r\nit,--also exalting the Union, in order to gain credit for “saving”\r\nit,--and calling for the enforcement of the laws, meaning the\r\nenforcement of the only Act of Congress which Slave-Masters specially\r\nrecognize, that for the surrender of fugitive slaves. Your indulgence\r\nwould hardly excuse me, if I occupied time in argument against this\r\ncombination, which, without declaring a single principle, without any\r\nchance of a majority in the electoral colleges, and without any hope\r\nof a single electoral vote in the Free States, runs for luck,--which,\r\nwith only a single possible vote in the House of Representatives, where\r\nit seeks, for a revolutionary purpose, to transfer the election, again\r\nproposes to run for luck.\r\n\r\nIts plan, so far as known, is this. You will remember, that, by the\r\nConstitution of the United States, in the event of failure to elect\r\nby the people, the House of Representatives is empowered to choose\r\na President out of the three highest candidates for that office,\r\nand the Senate to choose a Vice-President out of the two highest\r\ncandidates for that office. Now, assuming, first, that the Republican\r\ncandidate will not be elected by the people, which you know to be a\r\nvery wild assumption,--and, secondly, assuming that there will be no\r\nelection of President by the House,--this party, turning next to the\r\nVice-Presidency, assumes, thirdly, that Mr. Everett will be one of\r\nthe two highest candidates for the Vice-Presidency, and, fourthly,\r\nthat Mr. Everett will be elected by the Senate Vice-President, and\r\nthen will become President, like John Tyler and Millard Fillmore,--not\r\nthrough the death of a President, but through a double failure by the\r\npeople and by the House. Such is the calculation by which this band of\r\nprofessed Conservatives seek repose for the country. Permit me to say\r\nthat it is equalled only by the extravagance of Mrs. Toodles, in the\r\nfarce. Her passion was auctions, where she purchased ancient articles\r\nof furniture under the idea that they might some day be useful. Once,\r\nto the amazement of her husband, she brought home a brass door-plate\r\nwith the name of Thompson spelled with a p. “But what is this for?”\r\nhe demanded. “Why,” said Mrs. Toodles, with logic worthy of the Bell\r\nparty, “though we have been married many years without children, it\r\nis possible, my dear, that we may have a child, that child may be a\r\ndaughter, and may live to the age of maturity, and she _may_ marry\r\na man of the name of Thompson spelled with a p. Then how handy it\r\nwill be to have this door-plate in the house!” I doubt if any person\r\nreally familiar with affairs can consider this nomination for the\r\nVice-Presidency of more practical value than Mrs. Toodles’s brass\r\ndoor-plate, with the name of Thompson spelled with a p, picked up at an\r\nauction. But then, in a certain most difficult contingency at the end\r\nof a long line of contingencies, how handy it must be to have it in the\r\nhouse!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Breckinridge party, I confess myself at the\r\noutset perplexed between abhorrence of its dogma and respect for its\r\nfrankness. No plausible generality is put forward, as by the Bell\r\nparty, under which good and evil may alike find shelter; nor is any\r\nplausible invention announced, as in the case of yet another party,\r\nunder which the real issue is avoided. But the insufferable claim,\r\nfirst made by Mr. Calhoun, is unequivocally promulgated, that under\r\nthe Constitution the master may at all times carry his slaves into\r\nthe Territories, and neither Congress nor Territorial Legislature can\r\nprohibit the outrage. This at least is plain. There is something even\r\nin criminal boldness which we are disposed to admire. We like an open\r\nfoe, who scorns to hide in deceit, and meets us in daylight. But we do\r\nnot like a foe who dodges and hides so that we cannot find him. Nor\r\ndo we like a man who gives us only something counterfeit in exchange\r\nfor our votes. We do not like the double-faced prevaricator, who\r\ncozens both sides, and deals in words “that palter in a double sense.”\r\nIt is praise to be frank, even on a bad side; and I have no reason\r\nto question this merit of the Breckinridge party. And yet this very\r\nfrankness reveals an insensibility to reason and humanity, which, when\r\nrecognized, must add to our abhorrence. That men calling themselves\r\nChristians, calling themselves Americans, in this nineteenth century,\r\nshould without a blush assert such a dogma may well excite our wonder.\r\n\r\nFully to appreciate this dogma, you must know and feel what Slavery\r\nis. And here I content myself simply with reminding you of what\r\nelsewhere I have demonstrated, that Slavery, as defined by existing\r\nlaw, is a _five-headed_ Barbarism, composed of five different wrongs,\r\neach of which you must indignantly reject: first, the impudent claim\r\nof property in man; secondly, the gross mockery of the marriage-tie;\r\nthirdly, the absolute nullification of the parental relation; fourthly,\r\nthe denial of instruction; and, fifthly, the robbery of another’s\r\nlabor, and of all its fruits: that this whole five-headed Barbarism,\r\nsustained by existing law, and enforced by the lash, is simply _to\r\ncompel labor without wages_; and that to this end all great rights of\r\nfreedom, marriage, family, instruction, and property are trampled down.\r\nThis is Slavery. Turn it over, look at it as you will, such it is, and\r\nsuch it must be seen to be by every honest mind.\r\n\r\n    “To those who know thee not no words can paint,\r\n    And those who know thee know all words are faint.”\r\n\r\nBelieve me, fellow-citizens, I do not present this outline willingly.\r\nGladly would I drop a veil over the revolting features. But when\r\naudacious claims are made for Slavery, and you are told by one\r\ncandidate that it travels with the Constitution into new Territories,\r\nand then by another candidate that the handful of first settlers can\r\nalone deal with it in the Territories, while Congress sits powerless,\r\nit becomes your duty to consider precisely what Slavery is, to study\r\nit in the law from which it derives its character, and to follow it\r\nalso in all its effects. Here is the essential and vital part of the\r\nargument, even on the question of Constitutional Law. It is only when\r\nthis is done that we can see how irrational is every effort to give it\r\nconstitutional force, or to save it from the action of Congress within\r\nthe national jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAccording to the claim now made, Slavery exists under the Constitution\r\neverywhere outside the States,--in other words, Slavery is National;\r\nwhereas just the contrary is true. Everywhere outside the States\r\nFreedom must prevail; in other words, Freedom is National. Yes,\r\nFreedom is National, and Slavery Sectional. Read the Constitution,\r\nand tell me if it be not so. Surely, if a pretension so peculiar as\r\nthat now set up could be found there, it would be plain to all, so\r\nthat no man could question it. Like the Decalogue, it would be in\r\npositive language: “Thou shalt enslave thy brother man.” It would be\r\nleft to no doubtful phrase or ambiguous words, but would stand forth\r\nin appalling certainty, a “darkness visible.” It would be stuck up,\r\nlike Gessler’s hat in the marketplace, so that all could see it. But\r\nnothing is clearer than that in this well-considered instrument there\r\nis not one clause or word which maintains property in man, not one\r\nclause or word on which any such pretension can be founded. Wherever\r\nthere is any imagined reference to slaves, it is at most only to their\r\npossible existence in States, “under the laws thereof”; and then their\r\ndesignation as “persons” shows, that, whatever may be their condition\r\nin the States, the Constitution does not regard them as “property.”\r\nThank God, the Constitution does not contain the idea that man can be\r\nthe property of man. It was the declared purpose of Mr. Madison to\r\nexclude this idea. So completely has this been done, that it is among\r\nboasts often made, that a stranger in a distant country or a future\r\nage, reading our Constitution, and having no other record of our\r\nhistory, would not know that any human being had ever been claimed as\r\n“property” within the limits of the Republic. The text, at least, of\r\nthe Constitution is blameless. If men find Slavery there, it is only\r\nbecause they make the Constitution reflect their own souls.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this pretension is now the shibboleth of a great political\r\nparty; this is its single inspiration; this is its only principle;\r\nthis is all its stock in trade; this is its very “breath of life.” To\r\nthis base use has Democracy come. In voting for Mr. Breckinridge, you\r\ndeclare, first, that man can have property in his fellow-man, and,\r\nsecondly, that such property is recognized by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. The soul recoils from both. But even if the first be\r\ntrue,--which I utterly deny,--it does not follow that such property is\r\nsanctioned in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLast in order of alphabet is the Douglas party, whose single cry\r\nis “Popular Sovereignty”; last also in character,--for who can\r\nrespect what we know to be a deceit? The statesman founds himself on\r\nprinciples; sometimes it is his office to frame expedients; but Popular\r\nSovereignty, as now put forward, is not a principle,--oh, no! not\r\neven an expedient; it is nothing but a device, a pretext, an evasion,\r\na dodge, a trick, in order to avoid the commanding question, whether\r\nSlavery shall be prohibited in the Territories. That is all.\r\n\r\nAll hail to Popular Sovereignty in its true glory! This is the grand\r\nprinciple, first announced in the Declaration of Independence, which\r\nis destined to regenerate the world. It is embodied in those famous\r\nwords, adopted by the Republican Convention at Chicago, that among\r\nthe unalienable rights of all men are “life, liberty, and the pursuit\r\nof happiness,” and that “to secure these rights governments are\r\ninstituted among men, _deriving their just powers from the consent\r\nof the governed_.” These are sacred words, full of life-giving\r\nenergy. Not simply national independence was here proclaimed, but\r\nalso the primal rights of all mankind. Then and there appeared\r\nthe Angel of Human Liberation, speaking and acting at once with\r\nheaven-born strength,--breaking bolts, unloosing bonds, and opening\r\nprison-doors,--always ranging on its mighty errand, wherever there\r\nare any, no matter of what country or race, who struggle for rights\r\ndenied,--now cheering Garibaldi at Naples, as it had cheered Washington\r\nin the snows of Valley Forge,--and especially visiting all who are\r\ndown-trodden, whispering that there is none so poor as to be without\r\nrights which every man is bound to respect.\r\n\r\n    “The affrighted gods confessed their awful lord;\r\n    _They dropped the fetters_, trembled, and adored.”[170]\r\n\r\nNone so degraded as to be beneath its beneficent reach, none so lofty\r\nas to be above its restraining power; while before it Despotism and\r\nOligarchy fall on their faces, like the image of Dagon, and the people\r\neverywhere begin to govern themselves. Such is the Popular Sovereignty\r\nproclaimed by the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nBut the Great Declaration, not content with announcing certain rights\r\nas unalienable, and therefore beyond the control of any government,\r\nstill further, restrains the sovereignty, which it asserts, by\r\nsimply declaring that the United States have “full power to do all\r\nacts and things which independent states may OF RIGHT do.” Here is\r\na well-defined limitation upon Popular Sovereignty. The dogma of\r\nTory lawyers and pamphleteers--put forward to sustain the claim of\r\nParliamentary omnipotence, and vehemently espoused by Dr. Johnson in\r\nhis “Taxation no Tyranny”--was, openly, that _sovereignty_ is in its\r\nnature _illimitable_, precisely as is now loosely professed by Mr.\r\nDouglas for his handful of squatters. But this dogma is distinctly\r\ndiscarded in the Declaration, and it is frankly proclaimed that all\r\n_sovereignty_ is subordinate to the rule of _Right_. Mark, now, the\r\ndifference. All existing governments at that time, even the local\r\ngovernments of the Colonies, stood on _Power_, without limitation.\r\nHere was a new government, which, taking its place among the nations,\r\nannounced that it stood only on _Right_, and claimed no sovereignty\r\ninconsistent with _Right_. Such, again, is the Popular Sovereignty of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this transcendent principle is now degraded into a “dodge,”\r\nand the sacred name of Popular Sovereignty is prostituted to cover\r\nthe claim of a master over his slave. It is urged that a handful of\r\nsquatters may rightfully decide this claim, and the time-honored\r\ntraditional power of Congress over Slavery in the Territories is denied\r\nor voted down. To protect this “villany,” as John Wesley would call it,\r\nthe right of the people to govern themselves is invoked,--forgetful\r\nthat this divine right can give no authority to enslave others, that\r\neven the people are not omnipotent, and that never do they rise so high\r\nas when, recognizing the everlasting laws of Right, they bend to the\r\nbehests of Justice.\r\n\r\nThough bearing the name of Mr. Douglas, and now peddled through the\r\ncountry by him, this contrivance is not of his invention. It comes from\r\nan older head. It first showed itself in the Nicholson Letter of 1847,\r\nby which General Cass, as Presidential candidate, sought to avoid the\r\nWilmot Proviso. Laborious, studious, exemplary in private life, and\r\nfertile in pretexts, this venerable character has afforded the formula\r\nby which men have voted for Slavery, while making professions for\r\nFreedom. He is author of the artifice--rejected by every Slave-Master,\r\nand rejected by every lover of Freedom, whose eyes are open--which,\r\nunder the nickname of Squatter Sovereignty, has been the device of\r\ndoughfaces, enabling them sometimes to deceive the public and sometimes\r\neven to deceive themselves. Owing to the peculiar condition of opinion\r\nat that time, not yet stiffened against the compromise of Human Rights,\r\nhis very vacillation put him in harmony with the public, and gave him\r\na commanding position. Once for the Wilmot Proviso, which asserted\r\nthe power of Congress over the Territories, and then for a pretended\r\nPopular Sovereignty, which denied this power, he became the pendulum\r\nbetween Freedom and Slavery, and, thus swinging, imparted motion to a\r\nsham Democracy.\r\n\r\nThe device next showed itself on the passage of the Kansas and Nebraska\r\nBill; and here it became a trick, as appears by open confession of one\r\nof the parties to it,--and a trick it has continued ever since. It\r\nwas proposed to repeal the old Prohibition of Slavery in the Missouri\r\nTerritory, established as part of the Missouri Compromise. But instead\r\nof doing this openly and precisely, by simple words of repeal, language\r\nwas invented to mystify the whole question. Then appeared that “little\r\nstump speech injected in the belly of the bill,” according to Colonel\r\nBenton, declaring that the intent was to leave the people “perfectly\r\nfree to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way,\r\nsubject only to the Constitution of the United States.” As in the gray\r\nof the morning the fatal bill containing these words passed, General\r\nCass, rising from his seat,--I remember well the scene,--exclaimed,\r\n“This is the triumph of Squatter Sovereignty!” The old Prohibition of\r\nSlavery was overthrown, and his Nicholson Letter was vindicated.\r\n\r\nAnd now note well the trick. The Slave-Masters who voted for these\r\nwords rejected with scorn the idea that the handful of squatters could\r\nexclude Slavery. According to them, Slavery went with the Constitution,\r\nand was beyond the control of squatters. But formal assertion of this\r\ndogma would have caused trouble, and it was accordingly disguised in\r\nthese familiar words,--“subject only to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.” Mr. Benjamin, of Louisiana, in a recent speech, lets us behind\r\nthe scenes. He tells, that, at a caucus of Senators, “both wings of the\r\nDemocracy agreed that each should maintain its particular theory before\r\nthe public,--one side sustaining Squatter Sovereignty, and the other\r\nProtection to Slavery in the Territories, but pledging themselves to\r\nabide by the decision of the Supreme Court, whatever it might be.” Such\r\nwas the secret conspiracy, concealed for a long time from the public,\r\nand only recently revealed. And Mr. Douglas was a party to it.\r\n\r\nHad the Popular Sovereignty of Mr. Douglas been a reality and not a\r\nsham, had it been a sincere recognition of popular rights instead of a\r\ntrick to avoid their recognition, he could not have been party to such\r\ndeception. But how was the fact? While professing Popular Sovereignty,\r\nwhat did his bill really confer upon the people? Not the right to\r\norganize their own government, determining for themselves its form and\r\ncharacter; for all this was done by Act of Congress. Not the right to\r\nchoose the Executive; for the Governor and all other officers in this\r\ndepartment were sent from Washington, nominated by the President. Not\r\nthe right to nominate the Judiciary; for the judges were also sent from\r\nWashington, nominated by the President. Not even the right completely\r\nto constitute the Legislature; for even this body was placed in many\r\nimportant respects beyond the popular control. Thus in each of the\r\nthree great departments of State, Executive, Judicial, and Legislative,\r\nis Popular Sovereignty disowned.\r\n\r\nSearch the “Congressional Globe” during the Nebraska debate, and you\r\nwill see with what sincerity Mr. Douglas guarded the much vaunted\r\nrights of the people. Mr. Chase moved to allow the people to elect\r\ntheir Governor and other officers. On the vote by ayes and noes, the\r\nchampion of Popular Sovereignty voted _No_. Mr. Chase, whose effort to\r\nunmask this hypocrisy was indefatigable, made another motion, which\r\nput Mr. Douglas still more to the test. After the words of alleged\r\nPopular Sovereignty in the bill, he moved to add, “under which the\r\npeople of the Territory, through their appropriate representatives,\r\nmay, if they see fit, prohibit the existence of Slavery therein.” Here\r\nwas a plain proposition. On the vote by ayes and noes, Mr. Douglas and\r\nhis associates again voted _No_. His recent excuse, put forth in his\r\nsingle peripatetic speech, is, that the proposition was not in the\r\nalternate,--that is, that it gave power only to exclude, and not to\r\nadmit. But if he really favored it in that form, why not move to amend\r\nit by adding the power to admit, instead of voting against the whole\r\nproposition? It is clear that such an open and unequivocal declaration\r\nwas not congenial with the game to be played.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed, and then came other opportunities to test the\r\nsincerity of the present knight-errant of Popular Sovereignty. Under\r\nits provisions commenced at once a race of emigration into the new\r\nTerritories, and there Free Labor and Slave Labor grappled. Lovers of\r\nFreedom from the North were encountered by partisans of Slavery from\r\nthe South, organized by Blue Lodges in Missouri, and incited from every\r\npart of the Land of Slavery. The officials of a government established\r\nunder pretended safeguards of Popular Sovereignty all ranged themselves\r\non the side of Slavery; or, if their allegiance became doubtful,--as in\r\nthe case of Governor Reeder,--they were dismissed, and more available\r\ntools sent instead. I spare details. You cannot forget that winter\r\nand spring preceding the Presidential election of 1856, when we were\r\nalternately startled and stunned at tidings from Kansas, as a body of\r\nstrangers from Missouri, entering in hundreds, forcibly seized the\r\npolls, and, under pretended forms of law, set up a Usurpation, which\r\nby positive legislation proceeded to establish Slavery there, and to\r\nsurround it with a Code of Death. The atrocity of Philip the Second,\r\nwhen, by violence and through a “Council of Blood,” he sought to fasten\r\nthe Inquisition upon Holland, was renewed. Invasion, rapine, outrage,\r\narson, rape, murder, the scalping-knife, were the agents now employed;\r\nand to crown this prostration of popular rights, Lawrence, home of New\r\nEngland settlers, and microcosm of New England life, was burned to the\r\nground by a company of profane and drunken ruffians stimulated from\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nWhat then was the course of the champion of Popular Sovereignty? Did he\r\nthunder and lighten? Did he come forward to defend those settlers, who\r\nhad gone to Kansas under pretended safeguards of his bill? Oh, no! In\r\nthe Senate he openly ranged himself on the side of their oppressors,\r\nmocked at their calamities, denounced them as “insurgents,” insulted\r\ntheir agents, and told them they must submit,--while the distant\r\nEmigrant Aid Society in Massachusetts was made the butt of his most\r\nopprobrious assaults. All this I myself witnessed.\r\n\r\nThen came another scene, with which, owing to my enforced absence from\r\nthe Senate, as an invalid, I have less personal familiarity; but it\r\nis known to all of you. The Senatorial election in Illinois was at\r\nhand, when Mr. Douglas suddenly discovered that Popular Sovereignty\r\nwas something more than a name. He opposed the Lecompton Constitution;\r\nbut my distinguished colleague [Mr. WILSON] will tell you that even\r\nthere he was kept from barefaced apostasy only by the stern will and\r\nindomitable principle of the lamented Broderick, the murdered Senator\r\nfrom California.\r\n\r\nThen came stump speeches and Senate speeches without number, and a\r\nmagazine article, all to explain Popular Sovereignty. But this simple\r\nprinciple, which, in the light of the Declaration of Independence, and\r\nalso in the light of reason, is plain enough, has been so twisted,\r\nturned, and befogged, now explained away and then explained back, now\r\nenlarged and then limited, now acknowledged and then denied, that I\r\nchallenge any person to say with certainty in what, according to Mr.\r\nDouglas, it really consists.\r\n\r\nAt one time we find him declaring that “Slavery is the creature of\r\nlocal law, and not of the Constitution of the United States.” Good! Let\r\nhim follow this to its natural conclusion, and no Republican asks more.\r\n\r\nThen, at New Orleans, after his election to the Senate was secured,\r\nhe says: “The Democracy of Illinois accept the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States in the case of Dred Scott as an\r\nauthoritative interpretation of the Constitution. In accordance with\r\nthat decision, we hold that slaves are property, and hence on an\r\nequality with all other kinds of property, and that the owner of a\r\nslave has the same right to move into a Territory and carry his slave\r\nproperty with him as the owner of any other property has to go there\r\nand carry his property.” Here is the extreme dogma of Slavery in\r\nfull feather. Let him follow this to its natural conclusion, and no\r\nBreckinridge man could ask more.\r\n\r\nAt another time we find him declaring that “sovereign States have\r\nthe right to make their own constitutions and establish their own\r\ngovernments, but that he has never claimed these powers for the\r\nTerritories, nor has he ever failed to resist such claims, when set\r\nup by others.” How, then, under this theory, can Popular Sovereignty\r\nhave any foothold in the Territories? It is clear that all Territorial\r\nlegislation against Slavery must be invalid.\r\n\r\nAnd then again, in another place, by roundabout language, he admits,\r\nthat, according to the Dred Scott decision, which he declares that\r\nhe “approves,” the people of a Territory cannot, by any legislation,\r\nconfiscate slave property, or impair the “Constitutional right” of the\r\nmaster to this property in the Territory. With this limitation, pray,\r\nwhere, again, is Popular Sovereignty?\r\n\r\nBut elsewhere, as if to furnish something for the other side, he\r\nintimates a policy of inaction by the Territorial Legislature with\r\nregard to Slavery, and asks, “Would not the _inaction_ of the local\r\nLegislature, its refusal to provide a _Slave Code_, or to punish\r\noffences against that species of property, exclude Slavery just as\r\neffectually as a Constitutional prohibition?” And here is an end of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nChanging forms as often as Proteus, we yet find him admitting, first,\r\nthat Slavery goes into the Territories under the Constitution;\r\nsecondly, that the right of property in a slave cannot be destroyed\r\nby the Territorial Legislature; and all that this Legislature can do,\r\nby way of opposition, is to fold its hands and to seal its tongue in\r\ninaction. What, then, is this wonderful doctrine? So far as it means\r\nanything, it is simply this: that the people of a Territory have a\r\nright to _introduce_ Slavery, but not to _prohibit_ it. And such is\r\nPopular Sovereignty! Verily, between this and the Breckinridge dogma\r\nthere is about the same difference as between the much-vexed doctrines\r\nof Transubstantiation and Consubstantiation, where there was only the\r\ndifference of a single syllable, and both involved the same thing.\r\n\r\nNor is even this all. The Convention at Baltimore which nominated\r\nMr. Douglas has declared by formal resolution, that “the measure of\r\nrestriction, whatever it may be, imposed by the Federal Constitution\r\non the power of the Territorial Legislature over the subject of\r\nthe domestic relations, as the same has been or shall hereafter be\r\nfinally determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, should\r\nbe respected by all good citizens, and _enforced with promptness and\r\nfidelity by every branch of the General Government_.” And Mr. Douglas,\r\nin accepting his nomination, has expressly recognized this doctrine,\r\nthus in advance delivering over his bantling Popular Sovereignty to the\r\ntender mercies of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nFar different is the position of Mr. Lincoln, who has openly said, in\r\nhis debate with Mr. Douglas, “If I were in Congress, and a vote should\r\ncome up on a question whether Slavery should be prohibited in a new\r\nTerritory, in spite of the Dred Scott decision, I would vote that it\r\nshould. That is what I would do.”[171] And allow me to add, that this\r\ndoctrine of Mr. Lincoln is the doctrine of the Republican party. Any\r\ndoctrine short of this betrays the trick of Mr. Douglas.\r\n\r\nThe tree is known by its fruits, and if anything further were needed\r\nto expose this cheat of Popular Sovereignty, it might be found in\r\nits fruits as boasted by Mr. Douglas. A slave code most revolting\r\nin character had been adopted by the Territorial Legislature of New\r\nMexico, not only establishing Slavery there, including the serfdom of\r\nwhites, but prohibiting Emancipation. Through the generous activity\r\nof the Republicans, and in the exercise of a just Congressional\r\nintervention, a bill passed the House of Representatives annulling this\r\nslave code. While the bill was on the table of the Senate, attesting\r\nat once the disposition of the House of Representatives to interfere\r\nagainst Slavery, and also the signal necessity of such interference,\r\nMr. Douglas took occasion to make his boasts. Surrounded by the chiefs\r\nof Proslavery Democracy, the juggler of Popular Sovereignty thus showed\r\nwhat the trick had done for Slavery. Here are his words:--\r\n\r\n    “It is part of the history of the country, that, under this\r\n    doctrine of Non-Intervention, this doctrine that you delight\r\n    to call Squatter Sovereignty, the people of New Mexico\r\n    have introduced and protected Slavery in the whole of that\r\n    Territory. _Under this doctrine, they have converted a tract\r\n    of Free Territory into Slave Territory more than five times\r\n    the size of the State of New York._ Under this doctrine,\r\n    _Slavery has been extended from the Rio Grande to the Gulf of\r\n    California_, and from the line of the Republic of Mexico, not\r\n    only up to 36° 30´, but up to 38°, _giving you a degree and a\r\n    half more Slave Territory than you ever claimed_.”[172]\r\n\r\nAs the tree is known by its fruits, so also is the man known by the\r\ncompany he keeps. At first associated with Mr. Douglas on the same\r\nticket, as candidate for the Vice-Presidency, was Mr. Fitzpatrick, of\r\nAlabama, belonging to the school of Slave Propagandists, and fresh\r\nfrom voting in the Senate against Popular Sovereignty; and when he\r\ndeclined, his place was supplied by Mr. Johnson, of Georgia, also\r\nbelonging to the school of Slave Propagandists, who from the beginning\r\nhas denounced Popular Sovereignty, and insisted that “it is the right\r\nof the South to demand, and the duty of Congress to extend, protection\r\nto Slavery in the Territories during the Territorial state,” and who,\r\nat Philadelphia, in a public speech, did not hesitate to insult the\r\nmechanics and working-men of the country by the insolent declaration\r\nthat “Capital should own Labor.” Such is the associate of Mr. Douglas,\r\nwith whom he is so united as candidate that you cannot vote for\r\none without voting for the other. One of his earnest supporters in\r\nthe Convention at Baltimore, Mr. Gaulden, of Georgia, pressed the\r\nopening of the slave-trade with Africa on the very grounds of Popular\r\nSovereignty and Non-Intervention. After declaring, that, “if it be\r\nright to go to Virginia and buy a negro and pay two thousand dollars\r\nfor him, it is equally right to go to Africa, where we can get them\r\nfor fifty dollars,” he said, that, “if the Southern men had the\r\nspunk and spirit to come right up and face the North, he believed\r\nthe Northern Democracy, at least, would come to the true doctrine of\r\nPopular Sovereignty and Non-Intervention.” This barbarous utterance was\r\nreceived by the Douglas Convention with “applause and laughter.” Such\r\nare the men with whom this candidate is associated.\r\n\r\nIf you follow Mr. Douglas in his various speeches, you cannot fail\r\nto be shocked by the heartlessness of his language. Never in history\r\nhas any public man insulted human nature so boldly. At the North he\r\nannounces himself as “always for the white man against the nigger,”\r\nbut at the South he is “for the nigger against the alligator.” It\r\nwas natural that such a man, who thus mocked at a portion of God’s\r\ncreation made in the Divine image, should say, “Vote Slavery up or vote\r\nit down,”--as if the idea of voting it up were not impious and never\r\nto be endured. Beyond all doubt, no majority can be permitted to vote\r\nthat fellow-men shall be bought and sold like cattle. The pretension\r\nis preposterous, aggravated by knowledge on his part that under his\r\ndevice the settlers could only vote Slavery up, and that they were not\r\nallowed to vote it down. But this speech attests a brazen insensibility\r\nto Human Rights. Not so spoke the Fathers of the Republic, who would\r\nnot let us miss an opportunity to vote Slavery down. Not so spoke\r\nWashington, who declared that to the abolition of Slavery “his suffrage\r\nshould never be wanting.” Such is the whole political philosophy of\r\nthis Presidential candidate. A man thus indifferent to the rights of\r\na whole race is naturally indifferent to other things which make for\r\njustice and peace.\r\n\r\nAgain he cries out, that the Slavery agitation is in the way of public\r\nbusiness, and that it must be removed from Congress. But who has thrust\r\nit there so incessantly as himself? Nay, who so largely as himself\r\nhas been the occasion of its appearance? His complaint illustrates\r\nanew the old fable. It was the wolf above that troubled the waters,\r\nand not the lamb below. It is the Slave Propagandists--among whom\r\nthe champion of Popular Sovereignty must find a place--who, from the\r\nMissouri Compromise in 1820, through all the different stages of\r\ndiscussion, down to the shutting out of Kansas as a Free State at the\r\nrecent session, have rendered it impossible to avoid the exciting\r\nsubject. By dishonest, audacious theories of Slavery, both morally and\r\nconstitutionally, they have aroused a natural opposition, and put all\r\nwho truly love their country on the defensive. Yes, it is in defence\r\nof the Constitution perverted, of reason insulted, and of humanity\r\ndisowned, that we are obliged to speak out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrue, the country needs repose;--but it is the repose of Liberty,\r\nand not the repose of Despotism. And, believe me, that glad day can\r\nnever come, until the mad assumptions for Slavery are all rejected,\r\nand the Government is once more brought back to the spirit of the\r\nfounders. It was clearly understood at the beginning that Congress\r\ncould not touch Slavery in the States; and this is the doctrine of\r\nthe Republican party now. But it was also clearly understood at the\r\nbeginning that Slavery everywhere else was within the jurisdiction of\r\nCongress; and this also is the doctrine of the Republican party now.\r\nWith the practical acceptance of these two correlative principles the\r\nSlavery Question will cease to agitate Congress and to divide political\r\nparties. Transferred to the more tranquil domain of morals, religion,\r\neconomy, and philanthropy, it must continue to occupy the attention of\r\nthe good and the humane; but it will cease to be the stumbling-block of\r\npoliticians. Not until then is it permitted us to expect that Sabbath\r\nof repose so much longed for.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first stage in securing for our country the repose which all\r\ncovet will be the election of Abraham Lincoln as President, and the\r\nelection of that well-tried, faithful, and able Senator,--whom I know\r\nwell,--Hannibal Hamlin, as Vice-President. I do not dwell on all that\r\nwill then follow,--homesteads for actual settlers, improvement of\r\nrivers and harbors, economy and purity in the National Administration,\r\nincreased means of communication, postal and commercial, with the\r\nestablishment of a Pacific Railroad; nor do I dwell on the extirpation\r\nof the direful African slave-trade, now thriving anew under our\r\nnational flag,--nor on our relations with foreign countries, destined\r\nto assume that character of moderation and firmness which becomes\r\na great republic, neither menacing the weak nor stooping to the\r\nproud, and, while sympathizing with generous endeavors for Freedom\r\neverywhere, avoiding all complicity with schemes of lawless violence.\r\nAsk the eminent Boston merchant, Mr. Clark, whose avocation makes\r\nhim know so well the conduct of our Government with Hayti, if there\r\nis not need of change in our course toward a humble people, in order\r\nto save ourselves from the charge of national meanness, if not of\r\nnational injustice? But it is by this election that you will especially\r\nvindicate the Prohibition of Slavery in the Territories, even in the\r\nface of the Dred Scott decision, and fling your indignant answer at\r\nonce at the Proslavery non-committalism of Bell, the Proslavery dogma\r\nof Breckinridge, and the Proslavery dodge of Douglas.\r\n\r\nAll this can be done, nay, will be done. But let me not beguile you.\r\nThe ancient price of Liberty was vigilance; and this price has not\r\ndiminished of late years, especially when surrounded by men accustomed\r\nto power and stimulated by rage. Already the news has reached us of\r\ncombinations to consolidate the Opposition,--as we read that of old\r\ntwo inveterate parties among the Jews were reconciled. “The same day,”\r\nwrites the sacred historian, “Pilate and Herod were made friends\r\ntogether; for before they were at enmity between themselves.” This\r\nexample is too kindred not to be adopted. Already, also, we hear of\r\ndevices at a distance, and even near at home, to distract our friends,\r\nby producing distrust either of our principles or of our candidate.\r\nAt one time it is said that the principle of Prohibition is a\r\nmistake,--and then again, by natural consequence, that our candidate is\r\nnot sufficiently moderate.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, hearken not to any of these things. Keep the\r\nProhibition of Slavery in the Territories as the fixed and irreversible\r\npurpose of your hearts, and insist that it shall be established by\r\nCongress; for without Congress it may not be established. Old Cato\r\nprocured a decree of the Roman Senate that no king should ever enter\r\nRome, saying that “a king is a carnivorous animal.” A similar decree\r\nmust be adopted by Congress against an animal more carnivorous than\r\nking. In upholding this paramount necessity, I utter nothing new.\r\nDuring the debate on the Nebraska Bill, my eminent colleague at that\r\ntime in the Senate, Mr. Everett, now candidate for the Vice-Presidency,\r\nwhile approving the Prohibition, allowed himself to disparage its\r\nimportance. With the convictions which are mine, I felt it my duty to\r\nreply, kindly, but most strenuously. After exhibiting the efficacy of\r\nthe Prohibition, I said:--\r\n\r\n    “Surely this cannot be treated lightly. But I am unwilling\r\n    to measure the exigency of the Prohibition by the number of\r\n    persons, whether many or few, whom it may protect. Human\r\n    rights, whether in a multitude or the solitary individual, are\r\n    entitled to equal and unhesitating support. In this spirit,\r\n    the flag of our country only recently became the impenetrable\r\n    panoply of a homeless wanderer who claimed its protection in a\r\n    distant sea; and, in this spirit, I am constrained to declare\r\n    that there is no place accessible to human avarice or human\r\n    lust or human force, whether the lowest valley or the loftiest\r\n    mountain-top, whether the broad flower-spangled prairies or\r\n    the snowy caps of the Rocky Mountains, where the Prohibition\r\n    of Slavery, like the Commandments of the Decalogue, should not\r\n    go.”[173]\r\n\r\nAnd these words, uttered more than six years ago, are still of vital,\r\npractical force. The example of Delaware shows how little Slavery it\r\ntakes to make a Slave State, giving two votes to the ascendency of\r\nthe Slave Power in the Senate. Be wakeful, then, and do not disparage\r\nthat enemy which for sixty years has ruled the Republic. “That man is\r\ndangerous,” exclaimed the Athenian orator, “who does not see danger in\r\nPhilip.” And I now say, that man is dangerous who does not see danger\r\nin the Slave Power.\r\n\r\nWhen God created man in his own image, and saw that his work was good,\r\nhe did not destine his creature for endless ages to labor without\r\nwages, compelled by the lash. Such degradation we seek to arrest by\r\ncareful measures under the Constitution. And this is the cause of\r\nwhich your candidate is the generous and noble representative. Stand\r\nby him. Let not fidelity to those principles which give dignity and\r\nglory to Massachusetts, and to our common country, be an argument\r\nagainst him. From the malignity of enemies, from the vacillation of\r\ntimeservers, and from the weakness of friends shield him by your votes.\r\nMake him strong to commence the great work by which the Declaration of\r\nIndependence shall become a living letter, and the ways of Providence\r\nshall be justified to men.\r\n\r\n    “If yet ye are not lost to common sense,\r\n    Assist your patriot in your own defence;\r\n    That stupid cant, ‘He went too far,’ despise,\r\n    And know that to be brave is to be wise.”[174]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] This account is compiled from the Boston newspapers of the day.\r\n\r\n[2] On the balcony of his house in Beacon Street, as the procession\r\npassed, was William H. Prescott, the historian, with his family, waving\r\ntheir handkerchiefs. The next day Mr. Prescott called on Mr. Sumner,\r\nand said, that, had he known there would have been decorations and\r\ninscriptions on houses, he should have placed on his these words:--\r\n\r\n    “May 22, 1856.\r\n\r\n    “Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,\r\n    Whilst bloody Treason flourished over us.”\r\n\r\n[3] Wordsworth, Thought of a Briton on the Subjugation of Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[4] Of Reformation in England, Book II.: Prose Works, ed.
