I believe with all my heart in the\r\npeople of Iowa, for I think that you are good, typical Americans, and\r\nthat among you there has been developed to a very high degree that\r\nbody of characteristics which we like to regard as distinctively\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years we of the United States have been forced\r\nto consider very seriously certain economic problems. We have\r\nmade a beginning in the attempt to deal with the relations of the\r\nNational Government――that is, with the relations of the people of the\r\ncountry――to the huge and wealthy corporations, controlled for the\r\nmost part by a few very rich men, which are engaged in interstate\r\nbusiness――especially the great railway corporations. You know my views\r\non this matter. You know that I believe that the National Government,\r\nin the interests of the people, should assume much the same supervision\r\nand control over the management of the interstate common carriers that\r\nit now exercises over the national banks. You know furthermore that\r\nI believe that this supervision and control should be exercised in a\r\nspirit of rigid fairness toward the corporations, exacting justice\r\nfrom them on behalf of the people but giving them justice in return.\r\n\r\nRecently I have been reading the work of the eminent Italian scholar\r\nFerrero on the history of the Roman Republic, when the life of the\r\nRoman state had become that of a complex and luxurious industrial\r\ncivilization. I am happy to say that the differences between that\r\ncivilization and our own are more striking than the resemblances;\r\nand there is no warrant for our being drawn into any pessimistic\r\ncomparison between the two civilizations. But there is every reason\r\nwhy we should study carefully the past in order to draw from it lessons\r\nfor use in the present. One of the most striking features of the years\r\nwhich saw the downfall of the Roman Republic was the fact that the\r\npolitical life of Rome became split between two camps, one containing\r\nthe rich who wished to exploit the poor, and the other the poor who\r\nwished to plunder the rich. Naturally, under such circumstances, the\r\npublic man who was for the moment successful tended to be either a\r\nviolent reactionary or a violent demagogue. Any such condition of\r\npolitical life is as hopelessly unhealthy now as it was then. I believe\r\nso implicitly in the future of our people, because I believe that the\r\naverage American citizen will no more tolerate government by a mob than\r\nhe will tolerate government by a plutocracy; that he desires to see\r\njustice done to and justice exacted from rich man and poor man alike.\r\nWe are not trying to favor any man at the expense of his fellows. We\r\nare trying to shape things so that as far as possible each man shall\r\nhave a fair chance in life; so that he shall have, so far as by law\r\nthis can be accomplished, the chance to show the stuff that there is\r\nin him. We have no intention of trying to work for the impossible and\r\nundesirable end of giving to the lazy, the thriftless, the weak, and\r\nthe vicious, the reward that belongs to, and in the long run can only\r\ncome to, the hard working, the thrifty, the resolute, and the honest.\r\nBut we do wish to see that the necessary struggle in life shall be\r\ncarried on under genuinely democratic conditions; that, so far as human\r\naction can safely provide it, there shall be an approximately fair\r\nstart; that there shall be no oppression of the weak, and that no man\r\nshall be permitted to acquire or to use a vast fortune by methods or in\r\nways that are tortuous and dishonest.\r\n\r\nTherefore we need wise laws, and we need to have them resolutely\r\nadministered. We can get such laws and such administration only if\r\nthe people are alive to their interests. The other day I listened to\r\nan admirable sermon by Bishop Johnston, of western Texas. His theme\r\nwas that the vital element in judging any man should be his conduct,\r\nand neither his position nor his pretensions; and, furthermore,\r\nthat freedom could only stay with a people which has the habit of\r\nself-mastery. As he said, the price of liberty is not only eternal\r\nvigilance, but eternal virtue; and I may add, eternal common sense.\r\nEach man here knows that he himself has been able to use his freedom\r\nto advantage only provided that he could master himself, that he could\r\ncontrol his own passions and direct his own faculties. Each of you\r\nfathers and mothers here knows that if your sons are to do well in the\r\nworld they must know how to master themselves. Every man must have a\r\nmaster; if he is not his own master, then somebody else will be. This\r\nis just as true of public life as of private life. If we can not\r\nmaster ourselves, control ourselves, then sooner or later we shall have\r\nto submit to outside control; for there must be control somewhere.\r\n\r\nOne way of exercising such control is through the laws of the land.\r\nOurs is a government of liberty, but it is a government of that\r\norderly liberty which comes by and through the honest enforcement of\r\nand obedience to the law. At intervals during the last few months the\r\nappeal has been made to me not to enforce the law against certain\r\nwrongdoers of great wealth because to do so would interfere with the\r\nbusiness prosperity of the country. Under the effects of that kind of\r\nfright which when sufficiently acute we call panic, this appeal has\r\nbeen made to me even by men who ordinarily behave as decent citizens.\r\nOne newspaper which has itself strongly advanced this view gave\r\nprominence to the statement of a certain man of great wealth to the\r\neffect that the so-called financial weakness “was due entirely to the\r\nadmitted intention of President Roosevelt to punish the large moneyed\r\ninterests which had transgressed the laws.” I do not admit that this\r\nhas been the main cause of any business troubles we have had; but it is\r\npossible that it has been a contributory cause. If so, friends, as far\r\nas I am concerned it must be accepted as a disagreeable but unavoidable\r\nfeature in a course of policy which as long as I am President will\r\nnot be changed. In any great movement for righteousness, where the\r\nforces of evil are strongly intrenched, it is unfortunately inevitable\r\nthat some unoffending people should suffer in company with the real\r\noffenders. This is not our fault. It is the fault of those to whose\r\ndeceptive action these innocent people owe their false position. A year\r\nor two ago certain representatives of labor called upon me and in the\r\ncourse of a very pleasant conversation told me that they regarded me\r\nas “the friend of labor.” I answered that I certainly was, and that I\r\nwould do everything in my power for the laboring man _except anything\r\nthat was wrong_. I have the same answer to make to the business man.\r\nI will do everything I can do to help business conditions, except\r\nanything that is wrong. And it would be not merely wrong but infamous\r\nto fail to do all that can be done to secure the punishment of those\r\nwrongdoers whose deeds are peculiarly reprehensible because they are\r\nnot committed under the stress of want. Whenever a serious effort\r\nis made to cut out what is evil in our political life, whether the\r\neffort takes the shape of warring against the gross and sordid forms\r\nof evil in some municipality, or whether it takes the shape of trying\r\nto secure the honest enforcement of the law as against very powerful\r\nand wealthy people, there are sure to be certain individuals who\r\ndemand that the movement stop because it may hurt business. In each\r\ncase the answer must be that we earnestly hope and believe that there\r\nwill be no permanent damage to business from the movement, but that\r\nif righteousness conflicts with the fancied needs of business, then\r\nthe latter must go to the wall. We can not afford to substitute any\r\nother test for that of guilt or innocence, of wrongdoing or welldoing,\r\nin judging any man. If a man does well, if he acts honestly, he has\r\nnothing to fear from this Administration. But so far as in me lies\r\nthe corrupt politician, great or small, the private citizen who\r\ntransgresses the law――be he rich or poor――shall be brought before\r\nthe impartial justice of a court. Perhaps I am most anxious to get at\r\nthe politician who is corrupt, because he betrays a great trust; but\r\nassuredly I shall not spare his brother corruptionist who shows himself\r\na swindler in business life; and, according to our power, crimes of\r\nfraud and cunning shall be prosecuted as relentlessly as crimes of\r\nbrutality and physical violence.\r\n\r\nWe need good laws and we need above all things the hearty aid of good\r\ncitizens in supporting and enforcing the laws. Nevertheless, men and\r\nwomen of this great State, men and women of the Middle West, never\r\nforget that law and the administration of law, important though they\r\nare, must always occupy a wholly secondary place as compared with the\r\ncharacter of the average citizen himself. On this trip I shall speak\r\nto audiences in each of which there will be many men who fought in\r\nthe civil war. You who wore the blue and your brothers of the South\r\nwho wore the gray know that in war no general no matter how good, no\r\norganization no matter how perfect, can avail if the average man in\r\nthe ranks has not got the fighting edge. We need the organization, the\r\npreparation; we need the good general; but we need most the fighting\r\nedge in the individual soldier. So it is in private life. We live in a\r\nrough, workaday world, and we are yet a long way from the millennium.\r\nWe can not as a nation and we can not as individuals afford to\r\ncultivate only the gentler, softer qualities. There must be gentleness\r\nand tenderness――the strongest men are gentle and tender――but there must\r\nalso be courage and strength. I have a hearty sympathy with those who\r\nbelieve in doing all that can be done for peace; but I have no sympathy\r\nat all with those who believe that in the world as it now is we can\r\nafford to see the average American citizen lose the qualities that in\r\ntheir sum make up a good fighting man. You men must be workers who\r\nwork with all your heart and strength and mind at your several tasks\r\nin life; and you must also be able to fight at need. You women have\r\neven higher and more difficult duties; for I honor no man, not even\r\nthe soldier who fights for righteousness, quite as much as I honor the\r\ngood woman who does her full duty as wife and mother. But if she shirks\r\nher duty as wife and mother then she stands on a par with the man who\r\nrefuses to work for himself and his family, for those dependent upon\r\nhim, and who in time of the nation’s need refuses to fight. The man\r\nor woman who shirks his or her duty occupies a contemptible position.\r\nYou here are the sons and daughters of the pioneers. I preach to you no\r\nlife of ease. I preach to you the life of effort, the life that finds\r\nits highest satisfaction in doing well some work that is well worth\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nSo much for what concerns every man and every woman in this country.\r\nNow, a word or two as to matters which are of peculiar interest to\r\nthis region of our country.\r\n\r\nSince I have been President I have traveled in every State of this\r\nUnion, but my traveling has been almost entirely on railroads, save\r\nnow and then by wagon or on horseback. Now I have the chance to try\r\ntraveling by river; to go down the greatest of our rivers, the Father\r\nof Waters. A good many years ago when I lived in the Northwest I\r\ntraveled occasionally on the Upper Missouri and its tributaries; but\r\nthen we went in a flatboat and did our own rowing and paddling and\r\npoling. Now I am to try a steamboat. I am a great believer in our\r\nrailway system; and the fact that I am very firm in my belief as to\r\nthe necessity of the Government exercising a proper supervision and\r\ncontrol over the railroads does not in the least interfere with the\r\nother fact that I greatly admire the large majority of the men in all\r\npositions, from the top to the bottom, who build and run them. Yet,\r\nwhile of course I am anxious to see these men, and therefore the\r\ncorporations they represent or serve, achieve the fullest measure of\r\nlegitimate prosperity, nevertheless as this country grows I feel that\r\nwe can not have too many highroads, and that in addition to the iron\r\nhighroads of our railway system we should also utilize the great river\r\nhighways which have been given us by nature. From a variety of causes\r\nthese highways have in many parts of the country been almost abandoned.\r\nThis is not healthy. Our people, and especially the representatives\r\nof the people in the National Congress, should give their most careful\r\nattention to this subject. We should be prepared to put the nation\r\ncollectively back of the movement to improve them for the nation’s\r\nuse. Our knowledge at this time is not such as to permit me to go into\r\ndetails, or to say definitely just what the nation should do; but most\r\nassuredly our great navigable rivers are national assets just as much\r\nas our great seacoast harbors. Exactly as it is for the interest of\r\nall the country that our great harbors should be fitted to receive in\r\nsafety the largest vessels of the merchant fleets of the world, so\r\nby deepening and otherwise our rivers should be fitted to bear their\r\npart in the movement of our merchandise; and this is especially true\r\nof the Mississippi and its tributaries, which drain the immense and\r\nprosperous region which makes in very fact the heart of our nation;\r\nthe basin of the Great Lakes being already united with the basin of\r\nthe Mississippi, and both regions being identical in their products\r\nand interests. Waterways are peculiarly fitted for the transportation\r\nof the bulky commodities which come from the soil or under the soil;\r\nand no other part of our country is as fruitful as is this in such\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\nYou in Iowa have many manufacturing centers, but you remain, and I\r\nhope you will always remain, a great agricultural State. I hope that\r\nthe means of transporting your commodities to market will be steadily\r\nimproved; but this will be of no use unless you keep producing the\r\ncommodities, and in the long run this will largely depend upon your\r\nbeing able to keep on the farm a high type of citizenship. The effort\r\nmust be to make farm life not only remunerative but attractive, so that\r\nthe best young men and girls will feel inclined to stay on the farm and\r\nnot to go to the city. Nothing is more important to this country than\r\nthe perpetuation of our system of medium-sized farms worked by their\r\nowners. We do not want to see our farmers sink to the condition of the\r\npeasants of the Old World, barely able to live on their small holdings,\r\nnor do we want to see their places taken by wealthy men owning enormous\r\nestates which they work purely by tenants and hired servants.\r\n\r\nAt present the ordinary farmer holds his own in the land as against\r\nany possible representative of the landlord class of farmer――that is,\r\nof the men who would own vast estates――because the ordinary farmer\r\nunites his capital, his labor, and his brains with the making of a\r\npermanent family home, and thus can afford to hold his land at a value\r\nat which it can not be held by the capitalist, who would have to run\r\nit by leasing it or by cultivating it at arm’s length with hired\r\nlabor. In other words, the typical American farmer of to-day gets\r\nhis remuneration in part in the shape of an independent home for his\r\nfamily, and this gives him an advantage over an absentee landlord.\r\nNow, from the standpoint of the nation as a whole it is preeminently\r\ndesirable to keep as one of our chief American types the farmer, the\r\nfarm home maker, of the medium-sized farm. This type of farm home is\r\none of our strongest political and social bulwarks. Such a farm worked\r\nby the owner has proved by experience the best place in which to breed\r\nvigorous leaders alike for country and city. It is a matter of prime\r\neconomic and civic importance to encourage this type of home-owning\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should strive in every way to aid in the education of\r\nthe farmer for the farm, and should shape our school system with this\r\nend in view; and so vitally important is this that, in my opinion,\r\nthe Federal Government should cooperate with the State governments\r\nto secure the needed change and improvement in our schools. It is\r\nsignificant that both from Minnesota and Georgia there have come\r\nproposals in this direction in the appearance of bills introduced\r\ninto the National Congress. The Congressional land grant act of 1852\r\naccomplished much in establishing the agricultural colleges in the\r\nseveral States, and therefore in preparing to turn the system of\r\neducational training for the young into channels at once broader and\r\nmore practicable――and what I am saying about agricultural training\r\nreally applies to all industrial training. But the colleges can not\r\nreach the masses, and it is essential that the masses should be\r\nreached. Such agricultural high schools as those in Minnesota and\r\nNebraska for farm boys and girls, such technical high schools as are\r\nto be found, for instance, in both St. Louis and Washington, have by\r\ntheir success shown that it is entirely feasible to carry in practical\r\nfashion the fundamentals of industrial training into the realms of\r\nour secondary schools. At present there is a gap between our primary\r\nschools in country and city and the industrial collegiate courses,\r\nwhich must be closed, and if necessary the Nation must help the State\r\nto close it. Too often our present schools tend to put altogether too\r\ngreat a premium upon mere literary education, and therefore to train\r\naway from the farm and the shop.\r\n\r\nWe should reverse this process. Specific training of a practical kind\r\nshould be given to the boys and girls who when men and women are to\r\nmake up the backbone of this nation by working in agriculture, in\r\nthe mechanical industries, in arts and trades; in short, who are to\r\ndo the duty that should always come first with all of us, the duty of\r\nhome-making and home-keeping. Too narrow a literary education is, for\r\nmost men and women, not a real education at all; for a real education\r\nshould fit people primarily for the industrial and home-making\r\nemployments in which they must employ the bulk of their activities.\r\nOur country offers unparalleled opportunities for domestic and social\r\nadvancement, for social and economic leadership in the world. Our\r\ngreatest national asset is to be found in the children. They need to\r\nbe trained to high ideals of everyday living, and to high efficiency\r\nin their respective vocations; we can not afford to have them trained\r\notherwise, and the nation should help the States to achieve this end.\r\n\r\nNow, men of Iowa, I want to say just a word on a matter that concerns\r\nnot the States of the Mississippi Valley itself, but the States west\r\nof them, the States of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains.\r\nUnfortunately, I am not able on this present trip to visit those States,\r\nor I should speak to their own people on the point to which I now intend\r\nto allude; but after all anything that affects a considerable number of\r\nAmericans who live under one set of conditions, must be of moment to all\r\nother Americans, for never forget, friends, that in the long run we\r\nshall all go up or go down together.\r\n\r\nThe States of the high plains and of the mountains have a peculiar\r\nclaim upon me, because for a number of years I lived and worked in\r\nthem, and I have that intimate knowledge of their people that comes\r\nunder such conditions. In those States there is need of a modification\r\nof the land laws that have worked so well in the well-watered fertile\r\nregions to the eastward, such as those in which you here dwell.\r\nThe one object in all our land laws should always be to favor the\r\nactual settler, the actual home maker, who comes to dwell on the\r\nland and there to bring up his children to inherit it after him. The\r\nGovernment should part with its title to the land only to the actual\r\nhome-maker――not to the profit-maker, who does not care to make a home.\r\nThe land should be sold outright only in quantities sufficient for\r\ndecent homes――not in huge areas to be held for speculative purposes or\r\nused as ranches, where those who do the actual work are merely tenants\r\nor hired hands. No temporary prosperity of any class of men could in\r\nthe slightest degree atone for failure on our part to shape the laws so\r\nthat they may work for the permanent good of the home-maker. This is\r\nfundamental, gentlemen, and is simply carrying out the idea upon which\r\nI dwell in speaking to you of your own farms here in Iowa. Now in many\r\nStates where the rainfall is light it is a simple absurdity to expect\r\nany man to live, still less to bring up a family, on one hundred and\r\nsixty acres. Where we are able to introduce irrigation, the homestead\r\ncan be very much less in size――can, for instance, be forty acres; and\r\nthere is nothing that Congress has done during the past six years more\r\nimportant than the enactment of the national irrigation law. But where\r\nirrigation is not applicable and the land can only be used for grazing,\r\nit may be that you can not run more than one steer to ten acres, and\r\nit is not necessary to be much of a mathematician in order to see that\r\nwhere such is the case a homestead of one hundred and sixty acres will\r\nnot go far toward the support of a family. In consequence of this fact,\r\nhomesteaders do not take up the lands in the tracts in question. They\r\nare left open for anybody to graze upon that wishes to. The result is\r\nthat the men who use them moderately and not with a view to exhausting\r\ntheir resources are at the mercy of those who care nothing for the\r\nfuture and simply intend to skin the land in the present. For instance,\r\nthe small sheep farmer who has a home and who wishes that home to pass\r\non to his children improved in value will naturally run his flock so\r\nthat the land will support it, not only to-day, but ten years hence;\r\nbut a big absentee sheep owner, who has no home on the land at all,\r\nbut simply owns huge migratory flocks of sheep, may well find it to\r\nhis profit to drive them over the small sheep farmer’s range and eat\r\nit all out. He can then drive his flocks on, whereas the small man can\r\nnot. Of course, to permit such a state of things is not only evil for\r\nthe small man, but is destructive of the best interests of the country.\r\nSubstantially the same conditions obtain as regards cattle. The custom\r\nhas therefore grown up of fencing great tracts of Government land\r\nwithout warrant of law. The men who fenced this land were sometimes\r\nrich men, who, by fencing it, kept out actual settlers and thereby\r\nworked evil to the country. But in many cases, whether they were large\r\nmen or small men, their object was not to keep out actual settlers,\r\nbut to protect themselves and their own industry by preventing\r\novergrazing of the range on the part of reckless stock owners who had\r\nno place in the permanent development of the country and who were\r\nindifferent to everything except the profits of the moment. To permit\r\nthe continuance of this illegal fencing inevitably tended to very grave\r\nabuses, and the Government has therefore forced the fencers to take\r\ndown their fences. In doing this we have not only obeyed and enforced\r\nthe law, but we have corrected many flagrant abuses. Nevertheless, we\r\nhave also caused hardship, which, though unavoidable, I was exceedingly\r\nunwilling to cause. In some way or other we must provide for the use of\r\nthe public range under conditions which shall inure primarily to the\r\nbenefit of the actual settlers on or near it, and which shall prevent\r\nits being wasted. This means that in some shape or way the fencing of\r\npasture land must be permitted under restrictions which will safeguard\r\nthe rights of the actual settlers. I desire to act as these actual\r\nsettlers wish to have me in this matter. I wish to find out their needs\r\nand desires and then to try to put them into effect. But they must\r\ntake trouble, must look ahead to their own ultimate and real good,\r\nmust insist upon being really represented by their public men, if we\r\nare to have a good result. A little while ago I received a very manly\r\nand sensible letter from one of the prominent members of the Laramie\r\nCounty, Wyo., Cattle and Horse Growers’ Association. My correspondent\r\nremarked incidentally in his letter, “I am a small ranchman, and have\r\nto plow and pitch hay myself,” and then went on to say that the great\r\nmajority of their people had complied with the governmental order, had\r\nremoved their fences and sold their cattle, but that they must get some\r\nkind of a lease law which would permit them to graze their stock under\r\nproper conditions or else it would be ruinous to them to continue in\r\nthe business. The thing I have most at heart as regards this subject is\r\nto do whatever will be of permanent benefit to just exactly the people\r\nfor whom this correspondent of mine spoke――the small ranchmen who have\r\nto plow and pitch hay themselves. All I want to do is to find out\r\nwhat will be to their real benefit, for that is certain to be to the\r\nbenefit of the country as a whole. It may be that we can secure their\r\ninterests best by permitting all homesteaders in the dry country to\r\ninclose, individually or a certain number of them together, big tracts\r\nof range for summer use, the tracts being proportioned to the number\r\nof neighboring homesteaders who wish to run their cattle upon it. It\r\nmay be that parts of the range will only be valuable for companies that\r\ncan lease it and put large herds on it; for the way properly to develop\r\na region is to put it to those uses to which it is best adapted. The\r\namount to be paid for the leasing privilege is to me a matter of\r\ncomparative indifference. The Government does not wish to make money\r\nout of the range, but simply to provide for the necessary supervision\r\nthat will prevent its being eaten out or exhausted; that is, that\r\nwill secure it undamaged as an asset for the next generation, for the\r\nchildren of the present home makers. Of course we must also provide\r\nenough to pay the proper share of the county taxes. I am not wedded to\r\nany one plan, and I am willing to combine several plans if necessary.\r\nBut the present system is wrong, and I hope to see, in all the States\r\nof the Great Plains and the Rockies, the men like my correspondent of\r\nthe Laramie County Cattle and Horse Growers’ Association, the small\r\nranchmen “who plow and pitch hay themselves,” seriously take up this\r\nmatter and make their representatives in Congress understand that there\r\nmust be some solution, and that this solution shall be one which will\r\nsecure the greatest permanent well-being to the actual settlers, the\r\nactual home makers. I promise with all the strength I have to cooperate\r\ntoward this end.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n ――Text in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\r\n\r\n ――Punctuation and spelling inaccuracies were silently corrected.\r\n\r\n ――Archaic and variable spelling has been preserved.\r\n\r\n ――Variations in hyphenation and compound words have been preserved.",
