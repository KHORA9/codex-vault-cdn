III.--JUNE, 1863.--No. VI.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF THE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a hasty survey, in our first number, of the value and\r\nprogress of the Union, let us now, turning our gaze to the opposite\r\nquarter, consider the pro-slavery rebellion and its tendencies, and mark\r\nthe contrast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in glancing along the past, that while a benevolent\r\nProvidence has evidently been in the constant endeavor to lead mankind\r\nonward and upward to a higher, more united, and happier life, even on\r\nthis earth--this divine effort has always encountered great opposition\r\nfrom human selfishness and ignorance.\r\n\r\nWe have also observed, that nevertheless, through the ages-long\r\n_external_ discipline of incessant political revolutions and changes,\r\nand also by the _internal_ influences of such religious ideas as men\r\ncould, from time to time, receive, appreciate, and profit by, that\r\nthrough all this they have at length been brought to that religious,\r\npolitical, intellectual, social, and industrial condition which\r\nconstituted the civilization of Europe some two and a half centuries\r\nsince; and which was, taken all in all, far in advance of any previous\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the period was ripe for the germs of a\r\nreligious and political liberty to start into being or to be quickened\r\ninto fresh life, with a far better prospect of final development than\r\nthey could have had at an earlier epoch. Born thus anew in Europe, they\r\nwere transplanted to the shores of the new world. The results of their\r\ncomparatively unrestricted growth are seen in the establishment and\r\nmarvellous expansion of the republic.\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as these results have been, the fact is so plain that he\r\nwho runs may read, that they would have been vastly greater but for a\r\nmalignant influence which has met the elements of progress, even on\r\nthese shores. Disengaged from the opposing influences which surrounded\r\nthem in Europe--from the spirit of absolutism, of hereditary\r\naristocracy, of ecclesiastical despotism, from the habits, the customs,\r\nthe institutions of earlier times, more or less rigid, unyielding on\r\nthat account, and hard to change by the new forces, disengaged from\r\nthese hampering influences, and planted on the shores of America--these\r\nelements of progress, so retarded even up to the present moment in\r\nEurope, found themselves most unexpectedly side by side with an\r\noutbirth of human selfishness in its pure and most undisguised form.\r\nThis was not the spirit of absolutism, or of hereditary aristocracy, nor\r\nof ecclesiastical and priestly domination. All of these, which have so\r\nconspicuously figured in Europe, have perhaps done more at certain\r\nperiods for the advancement of civilization, by their restraining,\r\neducating influence, than they have done harm at others, when less\r\nneeded. All of these institutions arose naturally out of the\r\ncircumstances, the character, and wants of men, at the time, and have\r\nbeen of essential service in their day. But the great antagonist which\r\nfree principles encountered on American soil; which was planted\r\nalongside of the tree of liberty; which grew with its growth, and\r\nstrengthened with its strength; which, like a noxious parasitic vine,\r\nwound its insidious coils around the trunk that supported it--binding\r\nits expanding branches, rooted in its tissues, and living on its vital\r\nfluids;--this insidious enemy was slavery--a thoroughly undisguised\r\nmanifestation of human selfishness and greed; without a single redeeming\r\ntrait--simply an unmitigated evil: a two-edged weapon, cutting and\r\nmaiming both ways, up and down--the master perhaps even more than the\r\nslave; a huge evil committed, reacting in evil, in the exact degree of\r\nits hugeness and momentum. Yes! this great antagonist was slavery--an\r\ninstitution long thrown out of European life; a relic of the lowest\r\nbarbarism and savagism, the very antipodes of freedom, and flourishing\r\nbest only in the rudest forms of society; but now rearing its hideous\r\nvisage in the midst of principles, forms, and institutions the most free\r\nand advanced of any that the world has ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of this great fact, one is led to exclaim: 'How\r\nstrange!' How monstrous an anomaly! What singular fatality has brought\r\ntwo such irreconcilable opposites together? It is as if two individuals,\r\ndeadly foes, should by a mysterious chance, encounter each other\r\nunexpectedly on some wide, dreary waste of the Arctic solitudes. Whither\r\nno other souls of the earth's teeming millions come, thither these two\r\nalone, of all the world beside, are, as if helplessly impelled, to\r\nsettle their quarrel by the death of one or the other. Thus singular and\r\ninexplicable does it at first sight seem--this juxtaposition of freedom\r\nand slavery on the shores of the new world.\r\n\r\nOn second thoughts, however, we shall find this apparent singularity and\r\nmystery to disappear. We are surprised only because we see a familiar\r\nfact under a new aspect, and do not at once recognize it. What we see\r\nbefore us in this great event is only an underlying fact of every\r\nindividual's _personal_ experience, expanded into the gigantic\r\nproportions of a _nation's_ experience. In every child of Adam are the\r\nseeds of good and of evil. Side by side they lie together in the same\r\nsoil; they are nourished and developed together; they become more and\r\nmore marked and individualized with advancing years, swaying the child\r\nand the youth, hither and thither, according as one or the other\r\nprevails; until at some period in the full rationality of riper age\r\ncomes the deadly contest between the power of darkness and the power of\r\nlight--one or the other conquers; the man's character is fixed; and he\r\ntravels along the path he has chosen, upward or downward.\r\n\r\nSo it is now with the great collective individual, the American\r\nrepublic. So it is and has been with every other nation. The powers of\r\ngood and evil contend no less in communities and nations than in the\r\nindividuals who compose them; and, according as one or the other\r\ninfluence prevails in rulers or in ruled, have human civilization and\r\nhuman welfare been advanced or retarded.\r\n\r\nIn the American Union, the contrast has been more marked, more vivid,\r\nand of greater extent than the world has ever seen, because of the\r\nhigher, freer, more humane character of our institutions, and the extent\r\nof region which they cover. The brighter the sunshine, the darker the\r\nshadow; the higher the good to be enjoyed, the darker, more deplorable\r\nis the evil which is the inverse and opposite of that good. Hence, with\r\na knowledge of this prevalent fact of fallen human nature, and also of\r\nthe fact that nations are but individuals repeated--one might almost\r\nhave foreseen that if institutions, more free and enlightened than had\r\never before blessed a people, were to arise upon any region of the\r\nglobe--something proportionately hideous and repulsive in the other\r\ndirection would be seen to start up alongside of them, and seek their\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nIs this so strange then? It is only in agreement with the great truth,\r\nthat the best men endure the strongest temptations. He who was sinless\r\nendured and overcame what no mere mortal could have borne for an\r\ninstant. So the highest truths have ever encountered the most violent\r\nopposition. The most salutary reforms have had to struggle the hardest\r\nto obtain a footing; in a word, the higher and holier the heaven from\r\nwhence blessings descend to earth, the deeper and more malignant is the\r\nhell that rises in opposition. With the truly-sought aid of Him,\r\nhowever, who alone has all power in heaven, earth, and hell, victory is\r\ncertain to be achieved in national no less than in individual trials.\r\n\r\nBut in both national and individual difficulties it is indispensable, in\r\norder that courage may not waver, that hope may not falter--it is\r\nindispensable that there should be, as already urged, a clear\r\nintellectual comprehension of the full nature of the good thing for\r\nwhich battle is waged. The brilliant vision of attainable good must be\r\npreserved undimmed--ever present in sharp and radiant outline to the\r\nmental eye; and so its lustre may also fall in a flood of searching\r\nlight on the evil which is battled against, clearly revealing all its\r\nhideousness.\r\n\r\nA clear understanding by the people at large, of what that is in which\r\nthe value of the Union consists, is only next in importance to the Union\r\nitself; since the preservation of the Union hangs upon the nation's\r\nappreciation of its value. Then only can we be intensely, ardently\r\nzealous; full of courage and motive force; full of hope and\r\ndetermination that it shall be preserved at whatever cost of life or\r\ntreasure. But without the deep conviction of the untold blessings that\r\nlie yet undeveloped in the Union and its Constitution, without the\r\nhearty belief that this Union is a gift of God, to be ours only while we\r\ncontinue fit to hold it, and to be fought for as for life itself (for a\r\nlarge, free individual life for each one of us is involved in the great\r\nlife of the Union), without this deep, rock-rooted conviction in the\r\nheart of the nation, we shall tend to lukewarmness--to an awful\r\nindifference as to how this contest shall end; and begin to seek for\r\npresent peace at any price. We say _present_ peace, for a permanent\r\npeace, short of a thorough crushing of the rebellion, is simply a sheer\r\nimpossibility--a wild hallucination. Nor is it a less mad fantasy to\r\nsuppose that the rebellion can be effectually crushed without\r\nannihilating slavery, the sole and supreme cause of the rebellion. Such\r\nlukewarmness and untimely peace sentiments, widely diffused through the\r\nloyal States, would be truly alarming. Those who feel and talk thus, are\r\nlike blind men on the verge of a fathomless abyss; and should a majority\r\never be animated by such ideas, we are gone--hopelessly fallen under the\r\ndark power, never perhaps to rise again in our day or generation. But we\r\nhave no fears of such a dismal result; the nation is in the divine\r\nhands, and we feel confident that all will be right in the end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have presented two reasons why the Union is priceless. Still further\r\nmay this be seen by a glance at the opposite features and tendencies of\r\nthe rebellion; and by the consideration of three or four points of\r\nradical divergence and antagonism between slavery and republicanism.\r\n\r\nWe set out with the following general statements:\r\n\r\nThe less selfish a man becomes--the more that he rises out of\r\nhimself--in that degree (other conditions being equal) does he seek the\r\nsociety of others from disinterested motives, and the wider becomes the\r\ncircle of his sympathies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the more selfish he is--the lower the range of\r\nfaculties which motive him--in that degree, the more exclusive is\r\nhe--the more does he tend to isolate himself from others, or to\r\nassociate only with those whose character or pursuits minister to his\r\nown gratification. Beasts of prey are solitary in their habits--the\r\ngentle and useful domestic animals are gregarious and social.\r\n\r\nNow the same is true of communities. The more elevated their\r\ncharacter--the more that the moral and intellectual faculties\r\npredominate in a community; or the more virtuous, intelligent, and\r\nindustrious--in short, the more civilized it is--the closer are the\r\nindividuals of that community drawn together among themselves, and the\r\ngreater also is its tendency to unite with other communities into a\r\nlarger society, while it preserves, at the same time, all necessary\r\nfreedom and individuality. The more civilized and humanized a nation is,\r\nthe greater are the tendency and ease with which it organizes a\r\n_diversified_, as distinguished from a homogeneous unity; or, the\r\ngreater the ease with which it establishes and maintains the integrity\r\nand freedom of the component parts, of the individuals and communities\r\nof individuals, as indispensable to the freedom and welfare of the whole\r\nnational body.\r\n\r\nThus advancing civilization will multiply the relations of men with each\r\nother, of communities with communities, of states with states, of\r\nnations with nations; and will also organize these relations with a\r\nperfection proportioned to their multiplicity; and thus draw men ever\r\ncloser in the fraternal bonds of a common humanity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the more a community becomes immoral, ignorant, and\r\nindolent--the lower its aims and motive, the less it cultivates the\r\nmental powers, the fewer industries it prosecutes, and the less\r\ndiversified are its productions--in proportion as it declines in all\r\nthese modes, in that degree does it tend to disintegration, to\r\nseparation and isolation of all its parts, and toward the establishment\r\nof many petty and independent communities; in other words, it tends to\r\nlapse into barbarism.\r\n\r\nSuch a movement is, however, against the order of Providence, and thus\r\nis an evil that corrects itself. Men are happier (other conditions being\r\nequal) in large communities than in small; and when selfishness and\r\nambition have broken up a large state into many small and independent\r\nones, the same principle of selfishness, still operating, keeps them in\r\nperpetual mutual jealousy and collision, until, whether they will or\r\nnot, they are forced into a mass again by some strong military despot,\r\nor conquered by a superior foreign power, and quiet is for a time again\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations we conclude that civilization, as it advances,\r\nis but the index of the capacity of human beings to form themselves into\r\nlarger and larger nationalities (perhaps ultimately to result in a\r\nfederal union of all nations), each consisting of numerous parts,\r\nperforming distinct functions; yet so organized harmoniously that each\r\npart shall preserve all the freedom that it requires for its utmost\r\ndevelopment and happiness, and yet depend for its own life upon the life\r\nof the entire national body.\r\n\r\nIt may also be concluded that this capacity of men so to organize is\r\njust in proportion to the development of the higher elements and\r\nfaculties of the mind, the religious, moral, social, and intellectual,\r\nand the diminished influence of the lower, animal, and selfish nature.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when in such a large and harmoniously organized\r\nnationality as the American Union, there arises a movement which,\r\nwithout the slightest rational or high moral cause, aims to break away\r\nfrom this advanced, this free and humanizing political organization; and\r\nnot only to break away from the main body, but also maintains the right\r\nof the seceding portion itself to break up into independent\r\nsovereignties; then, the conclusion is forced upon every impartial mind\r\nthat the spirit which animates such a disruptive movement is a spirit\r\nopposed to civilization, since it runs in precisely the opposite\r\ndirection; as, instead of tending to unity, to accord, to a large\r\norganization with individual freedom, it tends to disunity, separation,\r\nthe splitting up of society into many independent sovereign states, or\r\nfractions of states, certain, absolutely certain to clash and war with\r\neach other, especially with slavery as their woof and warp; and thus\r\nbring back the reign of barbarism, and the ultimate subjection of these\r\nwarring little sovereignties to one or more iron despotisms.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable tendency of the rebellion, if successful, and its\r\ndoctrine of secession _ad libitum_, is (even without slavery--how much\r\nmore with it!) to hurl society to the bottom of the steep and rugged\r\ndeclivity up which, through the long ages, divine Providence, the guide\r\nof man, has been in the ceaseless and finally successful endeavor to\r\nraise it. The American republic is the highest level, the loftiest table\r\nland yet reached by man in his political ascent; and the forces that\r\nwould drag him from thence are forces from beneath, the animal, selfish,\r\ndevilish element of depraved human nature, which so long have held the\r\nrace in bondage; and which, now that they see their victim slipping from\r\ntheir grasp, and rising beyond reach into the high region of unity,\r\npeace, and progress, are moving all the powers of darkness for one final\r\nand successful assault. Will it be successful? We cannot believe it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of this wicked, heaven-defying, insane movement on the\r\npart of the South? The answer is written in flames of light along the\r\nsky, and in letters of blood upon the breadth of the land. Slavery\r\nfirst, slavery middle, and slavery last. Accursed slavery! firstborn of\r\nthe evil one--the lust of dominion over others for one's own selfish\r\npurposes, in its naked, most shameless, and undisguised form. Dominion\r\nof man over man in other modes, such as absolute monarchy, aristocracy,\r\nfeudalism, ecclesiastical rule--all these justify their exactions under\r\nthe plea of the welfare of the subject, or the salvation of souls.\r\nSlavery has nothing of the kind behind which to hide its monstrosity;\r\nnor does it care to do so, except when hard pushed, and then it feebly\r\npleads the christianization of the negro! A plea at which the common\r\nsense of mankind and of Christendom simply laughs.\r\n\r\nNow slavery, we know, is just the reverse of freedom, and hence it is\r\nonly natural to expect that the fruits, the results of slavery, wherever\r\nits influence extends, would closely partake of the nature of their\r\nparent and cause. Slavery, then, as the antipodes of freedom, must\r\nengender in the community that harbors and fosters it, habits,\r\nsentiments, and modes of life continually diverging from, and ever more\r\nand more antagonistic to, whatever proceeds from free institutions.\r\n\r\nLet us look at some of these. There are four points of antagonism\r\nbetween free and slave institutions that seem to stand out more\r\nprominently than others; at any rate, we shall not now extend our\r\ninquiry beyond them.\r\n\r\nSlavery, then, begets in the ruling class:\r\n\r\n     1. An excessive spirit of domineering and command;\r\n\r\n     2. A contempt of labor;\r\n\r\n     3. A want of diversified industry;\r\n\r\n     4. These three results produce a fourth, viz., a division of slave\r\n     society into a wealthy, all-powerful slaveholding aristocracy on\r\n     the one hand; and an ignorant, impoverished, and more or less\r\n     degraded non-slaveholding class on the other.\r\n\r\nIt is at once seen how slavery develops to the utmost, in the master and\r\ndominant race, a habit of command, of self-will, of determination to\r\nhave one's own way at all hazards, of intolerance of any contradiction\r\nor opposition; of quickness to take offence, and to avenge and right\r\none's self. The possession and exercise of almost irresponsible power\r\nover others tend to destroy in the master all power of self-control;\r\nfoster intolerance of any legal restraint, of any law but one's own\r\nwill, that must either rule or ruin. It is a spirit that is cultivated\r\nassiduously from childhood to youth, and from youth to full age, by\r\nconstant and ubiquitous subjection of the negro, young and old, to the\r\npetty tyranny, the whims and caprices of little master and miss, and by\r\nthe exercise of authority at all times and in all places by the white\r\nover the black race. It is a spirit that is essential to the slave\r\ndriver; and when the habit of dictation and command to inferiors has\r\ngrown into every fibre of his nature, he cannot dismiss it when he deals\r\nwith his equals, whenever his wishes are opposed. Hence the violence,\r\nthe lawlessness, the carrying and free use of deadly weapons, the duels\r\nand murders that are so rife in the South, and the haughty manners of so\r\nmany Southern Congressmen. The rebellion is simply the culmination and\r\nbreaking forth of this arrogant, domineering, slavery-fostered spirit on\r\na vast scale. Failing to hold the reins of the National Government, it\r\nmust needs destroy it.\r\n\r\nSuch a temper and disposition is evidently incompatible with human\r\nequality and equal rights; and in it we have one of the roots of\r\nSouthern ill-concealed antagonism to free republican government.\r\n\r\n2d. The second Southern, or slavery-engendered element that is\r\nantagonistic to free institutions, is contempt of labor.\r\n\r\nCould anything else be expected? Because slaves work, and are compelled\r\nto it by the overseer's lash, _all_ labor necessarily partakes of the\r\ndisgrace which is thus attached to it. It is surprising how perverted\r\nthe Southern mind is upon this point. Because slavery degrades labor,\r\nthey maintain that the converse must also be true, viz., that all who\r\nlabor must unavoidably possess the spirit of slaves; and hence they\r\nsupposed that the North would not make a vigorous opposition, because\r\nall Northerners are addicted to labor.\r\n\r\nThe truth however is this: Where labor is despised no community can\r\nflourish as it is capable of doing; much less one with free\r\ninstitutions. We might just as well talk of a body without flesh and\r\nbones; of a house without walls or timbers; of a country without land\r\nand water, as of free institutions without skilled and honorable labor.\r\nIt is the very ground on which they stand.\r\n\r\nThis then is another source of antagonism between slave and free\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n3d. A third point, not only of difference, but also of antagonism\r\nbetween slave society and free, consists in the permanent contraction or\r\nlimitation of the field of labor in the former, and its perpetual\r\nexpansion and multiplication of the branches of industry in the latter.\r\nNot only does the slave perform as little work as he can with safety,\r\nbut besides this, the sphere in which slave labor can be profitably\r\nemployed is a limited one. Agriculture on an extensive scale, on large\r\nplantations, is the only one that the slaveholder finds to repay him.\r\nAll articles, or the vast majority of them, used by the South, that\r\nrequire for their production a great number of different and subdivided\r\nbranches of labor, come from the North.\r\n\r\nWe have said that labor, skilled, honored, educated labor, is the\r\nmaterial foundation, the solid ground upon which free institutions rest.\r\nWe now further add this undeniable and important truth, viz., that as\r\nbranches of labor are multiplied; as each branch itself is subdivided\r\nand diversified; as new branches and new details are established by the\r\naid of the ever-increasing light of scientific discovery, and the\r\nexhaustless fertility of human inventive genius; as all these numerous\r\nindustries are more or less connected and interlocked; as this great\r\nnetwork of ever-multiplying and diversified human labors expands its\r\ncircumference, while also filling up its interior meshes, in the degree\r\nthat all this takes place, the broader and firmer becomes this\r\nindustrial foundation for free institutions.\r\n\r\nIt is on this broad platform of diversified and interlocked labors that\r\nman meets his brother man and equal. The variety and diversity of labors\r\nadapts itself to a like and analogous diversity of human characters,\r\ntastes, and industrial aptitudes and capacities. And the mutual\r\ndependence and interlocking of these multiplied branches of industry\r\nbring the laborers themselves into more numerous, more close, and\r\nindependent relations. Men are first drawn together by their mutual\r\nwants and their social impulses; but when thus brought together, they\r\ntend to remain united, not merely by affinity of character, but also,\r\nand often mainly by their having something to _do_ in common--by their\r\ncommon labors and pursuits. Advancing civilization, since it ever brings\r\nout and develops more and more of man's nature, must, as a natural\r\nresult, ever also multiply his wants. These multiplying wants can be\r\nsatisfied for each individual only by the diversified activities of\r\nmultitudes of his fellows; the results of whose united labors, brought\r\nto his door, are seen in the countless articles that go to make up a\r\nwell-built and well-furnished modern dwelling. Labor is thus the great\r\n_social cement_; and can any one fail to see that it is upon the basis\r\nof such a diversified and interwoven industry that a corresponding\r\nmultiplicity, intermingling, and union of human relations are\r\nestablished; and also that it is only under free institutions in the\r\nenjoyment of equal rights, where all are equal before the law, and where\r\npolitical authority and order emanate from the people themselves, that\r\nlabor itself can be free; and not only free, but ennobled, and at full\r\nliberty to expand itself broadly and widely in all departments, without\r\nany conceivable limits? While at the same time, by the interlacing of\r\nits countless details, it cements the laborers, the respective\r\ncommunities, the entire nation into a noble brotherhood of useful\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to learn the elevating, refining power of labor, when\r\norganized as it can, and assuredly will be. At present we have no\r\nadequate conception of this influence. It is solely for the sake of\r\nlabor, for the sake of human activity, that it may fill as many and as\r\nwide and deep channels as possible, and thus permit man's varied life\r\nand capacities to flow freely forth, and expand to the utmost; it is\r\nsolely for this end that all government is instituted; and under a free,\r\npopular government, under the guidance of religion and science, labor is\r\ndestined to reach a degree of development and a perfection of\r\norganization, and to exert a reactive influence in ennobling human\r\ncharacter that shall surpass the farthest stretch of our present\r\nimaginings. Our rare political organization is but the coarse, bold\r\noutlines--the rugged trunk and branches of the great tree of liberty.\r\nOut of this will grow the delicate and luxuriant foliage of a varied,\r\nbeautiful, scientific, and dignified industry and social life.\r\n\r\nThis is the glorious, towering, expanding structure, which the insane\r\nrebellion, the dark slave power, is raging to destroy! to tear it,\r\nbranch by branch, to pieces, and scatter the ruins to the four winds, in\r\norder to set up, what? in its place. A foul, decaying object--a slave\r\noligarchy, which, do what it will, is, at each decennial census, seen to\r\nfall steadily farther and farther into the rear even of the most laggard\r\nof the Free States, in all that goes to make up our American\r\ncivilization.[1] And all this because it sees that the life of the\r\nrepublic is the death of slavery, and free labor the eternal enemy of\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nThis difference in the conditions of labor, then, forms the third point\r\nof antagonism between free and slave institutions.\r\n\r\nIt is an antagonism that is ever on the increase--ever intensifying, and\r\nutterly irremediable in any conceivable way or mode. Much as the nation\r\nlongs for peace, this is utterly hopeless, let it do what it\r\nwill--compromise, try arbitration, mediation--nothing can bring lasting\r\npeace but the death of slavery. Freedom may be crushed for a season, but\r\nas it is the breath of God himself, it will live and struggle on from\r\nyear to year, and from age to age, and give the world no rest until it\r\nhas vanquished all opposition, and asserted its divine right to be\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nIf slave society, therefore, thus necessarily diverges ever farther and\r\nfarther from the conditions which characterize, and those which result\r\nfrom the operations of free institutions, such society must of course be\r\nfast on its way to a monarchical, or even an absolute and despotic\r\ngovernment. The whites of the South even now may be considered as\r\nseparated into two distinct classes--the governing and the governed. The\r\nslaveholders are virtually the governing class, through their superior\r\nwealth, education, and influence; and the non-slaveholders are as\r\nvirtually the subject class, since slavery, being the great, paramount,\r\nleading interest, overtopping and overshadowing all things else, tinging\r\nevery other social element with its own sombre hue, is fatal to any\r\nmovement adverse to it on the part of the non-slaveholder. Everything\r\nmust drift in the whirl of its powerful eddy, a terrible maelstrom, into\r\nwhich the North was fast floating, when the thunder of the Fort Sumter\r\nbombardment awoke it just in time to see its awful peril and strike out,\r\nwith God's help, into the free waters once more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations, can we be surprised at the rumors that now\r\nand then come from the South, of incipient movements toward a\r\nmonarchical government? Not at all. Should the rebellion succeed--a\r\nsupposition which is, of course, not to be harbored for a moment--but in\r\nsuch an improbable contingency there can be hardly a reasonable doubt\r\nthat a monarchy would be the result. Not probably at first. The\r\nindividual States would like to amuse themselves awhile with the game of\r\nsecession, and the joys of independent sovereignty, State rights, etc.,\r\nas Georgia has already begun to do, in nullifying the conscription law\r\non their bogus congress. But eventually their mutual jealousies, their\r\n'quick sense of honor,' their contentious and intestine wars (and\r\nnothing else can reasonably be looked for) will bring them under an\r\nabsolute monarchy, more or less arbitrary, or under the yoke of some\r\nforeign power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe antagonism between free and slave institutions, which we have\r\ninferred, from a glance at the peculiar workings of each, finds its\r\ncomplete confirmation in certain statements made by Mr. Calhoun, some\r\ntwenty years ago, which were to this effect, viz.:\r\n\r\n     'Democracy in the North is engendering social anarchy; it is\r\n     tending to the loosening of the bonds of society. Society is not\r\n     governed by the will of a mob, but by education and talent.\r\n     Therefore the South, resting on slavery as a stable foundation, is\r\n     a principle of authority: it must restrain the North; must resist\r\n     the anarchical influence of the North; must counterbalance the\r\n     dissolving influence of the North. He upheld slavery because it was\r\n     a bulwark to counterbalance the dissolving democracy of the North;\r\n     that the dissolving doctrines of democracy took their rise in\r\n     England, passed into France, and caused the French Revolution; that\r\n     they have been carried out in the democracy of the North, and will\r\n     there ultimate in revolution, anarchy, and dissolution.' (Taken\r\n     from Horace Greeley, in _Independent_ of December 25th, 1862.)\r\n\r\nThese are Mr. Calhoun's own words, and he will probably be allowed to be\r\na fair exponent of Southern sentiment: we may gather from these\r\nutterances how the free republicanism of the North is regarded by the\r\nslave oligarchy.\r\n\r\nWe cannot forbear adding another statement of Mr. Calhoun, made to\r\nCommodore Stuart, as far back as 1812, in a private conversation at\r\nWashington, which was in substance as follows, viz.: That the South, on\r\naccount of slavery, found it necessary to ally herself with one of the\r\npolitical parties; but that if ever events should so turn out as to\r\nbreak this alliance, or cause that the South could not control the\r\nGovernment, that then it would break it up.\r\n\r\nComment upon this is unnecessary. Let no loyal man forget these\r\nexpressions; they reveal the egg from whence, after fifty years'\r\nincubation, this rebellion has been hatched.\r\n\r\nBut our theme, 'The Value of the Union,' continually expands before us;\r\nnevertheless we must bring our article to a close. We do so with the\r\nfollowing remarks:\r\n\r\nAn individual is truly free, not in the degree only in which he governs\r\nhimself, but in the degree that he governs himself according to the\r\ncentral truth and right of things, or according to the loftiness of the\r\nstandard by which he regulates his conduct.\r\n\r\nIt is by the possession of truth, and by obedience to what that truth\r\nteaches, that a man rises out of evil and error, and out of bondage\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nThe possession of truth constitutes intelligence.\r\n\r\nBut intelligence is worse than useless without obedience to its highest\r\nrequirements, which is virtue.\r\n\r\nVirtue, or morality, in its turn (or decent exterior conduct), is\r\nnothing without that which constitutes the soul's topmost and central\r\nfaculty, viz., the religious sentiment, or that which links the soul to\r\nGod, the centre of all things. As the parts of any organism, as we have\r\nseen, fall into confusion and discord when the central bond is wanting;\r\nso do the powers of the soul, when it closes itself by evil doing\r\nagainst the entrance of the beams of life and light that unceasingly\r\nflow upon it from God, the spiritual sun and centre of the universe.\r\n\r\nNow, as individuals make up the nation, this will be free, and the Union\r\nvalued and preserved, in the degree that each individual is intelligent,\r\nvirtuous, and religious.\r\n\r\nUpon those, then, who educate the individual, those to whom the infant,\r\nthe child, the youth, is entrusted, to mould and imbue at the most\r\npliant and receptive period of life--on those, whose office it is to\r\nform the young mind into the love and practice of all things good and\r\ntrue, and an abhorrence of their opposites; upon these, the parents, the\r\nteachers, and the pastors of the land; upon these, when this hurricane\r\nof civil war shall have passed away, do the preservation of this Union\r\nand the hopes of mankind more than ever depend. Upon home education and\r\ninfluence; on the schools and on the churches on these three forces\r\ncentred upon, interwoven, and vitalized by true Christian doctrine, as\r\nrevealed in the Sacred Scriptures or inspired Word of God, rest the\r\ndestinies of the American republic. May those who wield them live and\r\nact with an ever more vivid and growing consciousness of their great\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY.\r\n\r\n'All of which I saw, and part of which I was.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nJoe led Slema away, and, springing from the block, I pressed through the\r\ncrowd to where Larkin was standing.\r\n\r\n'Larkin,' I said, placing my hand on his arm, 'come with me.'\r\n\r\n'Who in h---- ar ye?' he asked, turning on me rather roughly.\r\n\r\n'My name is Kirke. You ought to know me.'\r\n\r\n'Kirke! Why ye ar! I'm right down glad ter see ye, Mr. Kirke,' he\r\nexclaimed, seizing me warmly by the hand.\r\n\r\n'Come with me; I want to talk with you.'\r\n\r\nHe sprang from the bench, and followed me into the mansion.\r\n\r\nEntering the library, I locked the door. When he was seated, I said:\r\n\r\n'Now, Larkin, who do you want this girl for?'\r\n\r\n'Wall, I swar! Mr. Kirke, ye fire right at th' bull's eye!' Then,\r\nhesitating a moment, he added:\r\n\r\n'Fur myself.'\r\n\r\n'No, you don't; you know that isn't true.'\r\n\r\n'Ha!--ha! This ar th' second time ye've told me I lied. Nary other man\r\never done it twice, Mr. Kirke; but I karn't take no 'fence with ye,\r\nnohow--ha! ha!'\r\n\r\n'Come, Larkin, don't waste time. Tell me squarely--_who_ do you want\r\nthis girl for?'\r\n\r\n'Wall, Mr. Kirke, I can't answer thet--not in honor.'\r\n\r\n'Shall _I_ tell _you_?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, ef ye kin!'\r\n\r\n'John Hallet.'\r\n\r\n'Wall, I'm d----d ef ye doan't take th' papers. Who in creashun told ye\r\nthet?'\r\n\r\n'No one; I _know_ it, Hallet's only son is engaged to this girl. He\r\nwants her, to balk him.'\r\n\r\n'Ye're wrong thar. He wants har fur _himself_.'\r\n\r\n'For himself!'\r\n\r\n'Yas; he's got a couple now. He's a sly old fox; but he's one on 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Is he willing to pay eighty-two hundred dollars for a mistress?'\r\n\r\n'Wall, Preston owes him a debt, an' he reckons 'tain't wuth a hill o'\r\nbeans. Thet's th' amount uv it.'\r\n\r\nThus the wrong of the father was to be atoned for by the dishonor of the\r\nchild! Preston was right: the curse which followed his sin had fallen on\r\nall he loved--on his wife, his mistress, the octoroon girl, his manly,\r\nnoble son; and now, the cloud which held the thunderbolt was hovering\r\nover the head of his best-loved child! And so He visiteth 'the sins of\r\nthe fathers upon the children!'\r\n\r\n'But he is wrong! Preston's estate will pay its debts. If it does not,\r\nJoe will make good the deficiency, I will guarantee Hallet's claim. See\r\nhim, and tell him so.'\r\n\r\n'He hain't yere, an' woan't be yere. He allers fights shy. An'\r\n'twouldn't be uv no use. He's made up his mind to hev th' gal, an' hev\r\nhar he will. He's come all th' way from Orleans ter make sure uv it.'\r\n\r\n'But, Larkin, you've a heart under your waistcoat; _you_ won't lend\r\nyourself to the designs of such a consummate scoundrel as Hallet!'\r\n\r\n'Scoundrel's a hard word, Mr. Kirke. 'Tain't used much round yere; when\r\nit ar, it draws blood like a lancet.'\r\n\r\n'I mean no offence to you, Larkin; but it's true--I will prove it;' and\r\nI went on to detail my early acquaintance with Hallet; his vast\r\nprofession and small performance of piety; his betrayal of Frank's\r\nmother; his treatment of his son, and all the damning record I have\r\nspread before the reader.\r\n\r\nAs I talked, Larkin rose, and walked the room, evidently affected; but,\r\nwhen I concluded, he said:\r\n\r\n''Tain't no use, Mr. Kirke; I'd ruther ye wouldn't say no more. It makes\r\nme feel like the cholera. An' 'tain't no use! I've _got_ ter buy th'\r\ngal.'\r\n\r\n'You have _not_ got to buy her! You need only go away. I will give you a\r\nthousand dollars, if you will go at once.'\r\n\r\n'No, no, Mr. Kirke; I karn't do it. I'd like ter 'blige ye, and I need\r\nmoney like th' devil; but I karn't leave Hallet in th' lurch. 'Twouldn't\r\nbe far dealin' 'tween man an' man. He trusts me ter do it, an' I'm in\r\nwith him. I _must_ act honest.'\r\n\r\n'How _in_ with him?'\r\n\r\n'Why, he an' ole Roye ar tergether. The' find th' money fur my\r\nbis'ness--done it fur fifteen yar. The' git th' biggest sheer, but I\r\nkarn't help myself, I went inter cotton, like a d--d fool, 'bout a yar\r\nago, an' lost all I hed--every red cent; an' now I shud be on my beam\r\nends ef it warn't fur them.'\r\n\r\n'Then Hallet has made his money dealing in negroes!'\r\n\r\n'Yas, a right smart pile, in thet, an' cotton. He got me inter th' d--d\r\nstaple. I hed nigh on ter sixty thousan' then--hard rocks; but I lost it\r\nall--every dollar--at one slap; though I reckon _he_ managed, somehow,\r\nter get out.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, of course, _he_ got out, and saddled the loss upon you. Were you\r\nsuch a fool as not to see that?'\r\n\r\n'P'raps he did; but he covered his trail. He's smart; ye karn't track\r\n_him_. But it makes no odds; I _hev_ ter keep in with him. I couldn't do\r\na thing, ef I didn't.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you could. Come North. I'll give you honest work to do.'\r\n\r\n'You're a gentleman, Mr. Kirke, an' I'm 'bliged ter ye; but I karn't\r\nleave yere. I've got a wife an' chil'ren, an' the' wouldn't live 'mong\r\nye abolitionists, nohow.'\r\n\r\n'You have a wife and children?'\r\n\r\n'Yas'; a wife, an' two as likely young 'uns as ye ever seed--boy 'bout\r\nseven, an' gal 'bout twelve.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Larkin, suppose _your_ little girl was upon that auction block;\r\nsuppose some villain had hired _me_ to aid in debauching her; suppose\r\nyou, her father, should come to me and plead with me not to do it;\r\nsuppose I should tell you what you have told me, and then--should go out\r\nand buy _your_ child; what would you do? Would you not curse me with\r\nyour very last breath?'\r\n\r\nHe seated himself, and hung down his head, but made no reply.\r\n\r\n'Answer me, like the honest man you are.'\r\n\r\n'Wall, I reckon I shud.'\r\n\r\n'Selma is to marry my adopted son. She is as dear to me as your child is\r\nto you. Can you do to her, what you would curse me for doing to _your_\r\nchild? Look me in the face. Don't flinch--answer me!'\r\n\r\nI rose, and stood before him. In a few moments he also rose, and,\r\nlooking me squarely in the eye--there was a tear in his--he brought his\r\nhand down upon mine with a concussion that might have been heard a mile\r\noff, and said:\r\n\r\n'No, I'm d--d ter h--ef I kin.'\r\n\r\n'You are a splendid, noble fellow, Larkin.'\r\n\r\n'Ye're 'bout th' fust man thet ever said so, Mr. Kirke. Ye told me\r\nsuthin' like thet nigh on ter twelve yar ago. I hain't forgot it yit,\r\nan' I never shill.'\r\n\r\n'You're rough on the outside, Larkin, but sound at the core--sound as a\r\nnut. I wish the world had more like you. Leave this wretched work!'\r\n\r\n'I'd like ter, but I karn't. What kin a feller do, with neither money\r\nnor friends?'\r\n\r\n'Get into some honest business. I know you can. I'll help you--Joe will\r\nhelp you. We'll talk things over to-night, and I know Joe will rig out\r\nsomething for you.'\r\n\r\nHe remained seated for a while, saying nothing; then he rose, and, the\r\nmoisture dimming his eyes, said:\r\n\r\n'I reckon ye're not over pious, Mr. Kirke, an' I _know_ ye'd stand a\r\nhand at a rough an' tumble; but d--d ef thet ain't th' sort o' religion\r\nI like. Come, sir; ef I stay yere, ye'll make a 'ooman on me.'\r\n\r\nAs we passed into the parlor, I said to Joe, who was seated there with\r\nSelma:\r\n\r\n'Give Larkin your hand, Joe; he's a glorious fellow.'\r\n\r\n'My _heart_ is in it, Larkin,' said the young man, very cordially. 'It\r\nwould have come hard to draw a bead on _you_.'\r\n\r\n'I knows it would, Joe, an' I wus ter blame; but I never could stand a\r\nbluff.'\r\n\r\nWe passed out together to the auction stand. Selma and her brother\r\nascended the block, while Larkin and I mingled with the buyers, who had\r\ncollected in even larger numbers than before. The auctioneer brought\r\ndown his hammer:\r\n\r\n'Attention, gentlemen! The sale has begun. I offer you again the girl,\r\nLucy Selma. You've h'ard the description, and (glancing at Joe, and\r\nsmiling) you know the _conditions_ of the sale. A thousand dollars is\r\nbid for the girl, Lucy Selma; do I hear any more? Talk quick, gentlemen;\r\nI shan't dwell on this lot; so speak up, if you've anything to say. One\r\nthousand once--one thousand twice--one thousand third and last call. Do\r\nI hear any more?' A pause of a moment. 'Last call, gentlemen.\r\nGoing--g-o-i-n-g--go--'\r\n\r\nThe word was unfinished; the hammer was descending, when a voice called\r\nout:\r\n\r\n'Two thousand!'\r\n\r\n'Whose bid is that?' cried Joe, striding across the bench, the glare of\r\na hyena in his eyes.\r\n\r\n'Mine, sir!' said the man, with a look of sudden surprise. His face was\r\nshaded by a broad-brimmed Panama hat, and his hair and whiskers were\r\ndyed, but there was no mistaking his large, eagle nose, his sharp,\r\npointed chin, and his rat-trap of a mouth. It was Hallet! Springing upon\r\na bench near by, I cried out:\r\n\r\n'John Hallet, withdraw that bid, or your time has come! I warn you. You\r\ncannot leave this place alive!'\r\n\r\nHe gave me a quick, startled look--the look of a thief caught in the\r\nact--but said nothing.\r\n\r\n'Who is he?' cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n'A Yankee nigger-trader! A man that seduced and murdered the woman who\r\nshould have been his wife; that cast out and starved his own child, and\r\nnow would debauch this poor girl, who is to marry his only son!'\r\n\r\n'Wall, he _ar_ a han'some critter.' ''Bout like th' Yankees gin'rally.'\r\n'Clar him out!' cried several voices.\r\n\r\n'If you allow him to bid here, you are as bad as he,' I continued,\r\nunintentionally fanning the growing excitement.\r\n\r\n'Wall, we woan't.' 'Pitch inter him!' 'Douse him in th' pond!' 'Ride him\r\non a rail!' 'Give him a coat uv tar!' and a hundred similar exclamations\r\nrose from the crowd, which swayed toward the obnoxious man with a quick,\r\ntumultuous motion.\r\n\r\n'He'm in de darky trade; leff de darkies handle him!' cried Ally,\r\nseizing Hallet by the collar, and dragging him toward the pond.\r\n\r\nThe face of the great merchant turned ghastly pale. Paralyzed with fear,\r\nhe made no resistance.\r\n\r\nPressing rapidly through the crowd, and tossing Ally aside as if he had\r\nbeen a bundle of feathers, Larkin was at Hallet's side in an instant.\r\nPlanting himself before him, and drawing his revolver, he cried out:\r\n\r\n'Far play, gentlemen, far play. He's a cowardly scoundrel, but he shill\r\nhev far play, or my name ain't Jake Larkin!'\r\n\r\nInstinctively the crowd fell back a few paces, and Larkin, with more\r\ncoolness, continued:\r\n\r\n'Th' only man yere thet's got anything ter say in this bis'ness ar Joe\r\nPreston; an' _he'll_ guv even a Yankee far play. Woan't ye, Joe?' he\r\ncried. Then, turning quickly to his partner, he added: 'Ye didn't know\r\nth' kunditions, Mr. Hallet, did ye? Speak quick.'\r\n\r\n'No--I--didn't know I was--giving offence,' stammered Hallet, looking in\r\nthe direction in which Larkin's eyes were turned.\r\n\r\nSelma had taken the auctioneer's chair, and Joe stood, with folded arms,\r\nglaring on Hallet.\r\n\r\n'Come, Joe,' continued Larkin, 'I've done ye a good turn ter-day. Let\r\nhim off, an' put it ter my 'count.'\r\n\r\n'As you say, Larkin; but he must withdraw his bid, and leave the ground\r\nat once.'\r\n\r\n'I withdraw it, sir,' said Hallet, in a cringing tone, clinging fast to\r\nthe negro trader.\r\n\r\n'Doan't hold on so tight, Mr. Hallet. Lord bless ye! nary one yere'll\r\nhurt ye; they'm gentler'n lambs--ha! ha! But when ye want anuther gal,\r\ndoan't ye come _yere_ fur yer darter-in-law--ha! ha!'\r\n\r\nPutting his arm within Hallet's, he then attempted to press through the\r\ncrowd; but the blood of the chivalry had risen, and, spite of Joe's\r\nremarks, they showed no inclination to let the Yankee off so cheaply.\r\nForming a solid wall around him, they blocked Larkin's way at every\r\nturn, and cries of 'Let him alone, Larkin!' 'Cool him off, boys!'\r\n'Doan't ye spile th' fun, Larkin!' 'Guv th' feller a little\r\nhosspitality!' echoed from all directions.\r\n\r\nPutting up his revolver, Larkin turned to them, and said, in the mildest\r\nand blandest tone conceivable:\r\n\r\n'Thet's right, boys--ye _orter_ hev some fun; but this gintleman's sick.\r\nDoan't ye see how pale he ar? He couldn't stand it, nohow. But thar's a\r\nfeller thet kin,' pointing to Mulock, who stood looking on, at the outer\r\nedge of the crowd. 'Ef ye're spilin' fur sport, ye moight try yer hand\r\non him!'\r\n\r\n'Yas, he'm de man!' cried Ally. 'He holped whip de young missus. He\r\ntelled on har fur twenty dollar. He'm de man!'\r\n\r\nMulock did not seem to realize, at once, that he was the subject of\r\nthese remarks. The moment he did, he sprang out of the crowd, and darted\r\noff for the woods at the top of his speed. A hundred men followed him,\r\nwith cries of 'Mount, head him off!' 'Five dollars ter th' man thet\r\nkotches him!' 'Take him, dead or alive!'\r\n\r\nAmid the universal excitement and confusion that followed, Larkin walked\r\nrapidly away with Hallet.\r\n\r\n'You can heat the kettle, boys; Mulock can't run,' cried Joe, from the\r\nplatform. 'But you must give him a fair trial.\r\n\r\n'We'll do thet, never ye fear!' echoed a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n'I nominate his friend, Mr. Gaston, for judge,' said Joe.\r\n\r\n'Gaston it is!' Gaston it is!' 'Mount the bench, Mr. Gaston!' shouted a\r\nhundred 'natives.'\r\n\r\nGaston got upon the auction stand, and said:\r\n\r\n'I'll serve, gentlemen; but, before we select jurors, the sale must go\r\non. Miss Preston is not sold yet.'\r\n\r\n'All right! all right! Hurry up, Mr. Hammerman!' shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer took his place:\r\n\r\n'A thousand dollars is bid for this young lady. Going--gone--_gone_, to\r\nMr. Joseph Preston.'\r\n\r\nSelma put her arms about Joe's neck, and, in broken tones, said: 'My\r\nbrother! my dear brother!' Then she laid her head on his shoulder, and\r\nwept--wept unrestrainedly.\r\n\r\nWho can fathom the untold misery she had endured within those two hours?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe impromptu judge took his seat on the bench, and the excited\r\nmultitude once more subsided into quiet. In about fifteen minutes a\r\ntumult arose in a remote quarter of the ground, and Mulock and his\r\npursuers appeared in sight, shouting, screaming, and swearing in a\r\ndecidedly boisterous manner. The most of the profanity--to the credit of\r\nthe self-appointed _posse comitatus_ be it said--was indulged in by the\r\nex-overseer, who, with his clothes torn in shreds, and his face covered\r\nwith blood, looked like the battered relic of a forty years' war. A red\r\nbandanna pinioned his arms to his sides, and a strong man at each elbow\r\nspurred his flagging footsteps by an occasional poke with a pine branch.\r\nAlly followed at a few paces, looking about as dilapidated as the\r\nculprit himself. To him evidently belonged the glory of the capture.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the stand. Gaston rose, and called out:\r\n\r\n'Do not insult justice, by bringing the prisoner into court in this\r\ncondition. Let his face be washed, his garments changed, and his wounds\r\nbound up, before he appears for trial. Dr. Rawson, I commission you\r\nspecial officer for the duty.'\r\n\r\n'I'm at your service, Major Gaston,' said the doctor, stepping out from\r\nthe crowd into the open semicircle in front of the bench. 'Will some one\r\nprocure the loan of a coat, hat, and trousers at the mansion?'\r\n\r\nAlly started for the needed clothing, and the physician led the way to\r\nthe small lake. In about twenty minutes the volunteer officials returned\r\nwith the criminal, clothed in a more respectable manner, and Gaston said\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n'Prisoner, take your place.'\r\n\r\nResistance was useless, and Mulock, with a slow step, and a sullen,\r\ndogged air, ascended the platform, and seated himself in the chair\r\nprovided for him at its further extremity. Gaston sat at the other end,\r\nfacing him; and four brawny 'natives,' with revolvers in their hands,\r\ntook positions by his side.\r\n\r\n'Silence in the court!' cried Gaston.\r\n\r\nThe noisy multitude became quiet, and the extempore official\r\nproceeded--with greater solemnity than many another judge of more\r\nregular appointment exhibits on similar occasions--to say:\r\n\r\n'Prisoner, you are charged with two of the highest offences known to our\r\nlaws; namely, with aiding and abetting an illegal and cruel assault on a\r\nwhite woman, and with procuring and inciting the murder of your own\r\nwife. You are about to be tried for these crimes by a jury of your\r\ncountrymen and I am appointed judge, that full and impartial justice may\r\nbe done you. It shall be done. Counsel will be awarded you; and, that\r\nyou may not be condemned by prejudiced men, you will be given the\r\nprivilege of peremptory challenge against four out of every five of the\r\njurors I shall nominate, I shall now proceed to name the jury, and you\r\nwill signify your objection to those you do not approve. Thomas\r\nMurchison.'\r\n\r\nThat gentleman came forward, and Mulock said:\r\n\r\n'I take him.'\r\n\r\n'Godfrey Banks.'\r\n\r\n'He's inimy ter me.'\r\n\r\nThe man stepped aside; and thus they proceeded, the prisoner taking full\r\nadvantage of the liberty of choice allowed him, until, out of a panel of\r\nnearly sixty, twelve respectable, yeomanly-looking men had been\r\nselected. As each juror was approved of by the crowd (who had the final\r\ndecision), he took a seat on a row of benches facing the 'judge' and the\r\nprisoner. When the last one had taken his place, Gaston said:\r\n\r\n'Prisoner, you have heard the charges against you; are you guilty, or\r\nnot guilty? If you think proper to acknowledge your guilt of either or\r\nboth the crimes with which you are charged, I shall feel it my duty to\r\naward you a lighter punishment.'\r\n\r\n'I hain't guilty uv 'ary one on 'em,' said Mulock, without looking up.\r\n\r\n'What legal gentleman will appear for the people?' cried Gaston, turning\r\nto the audience. Several sprigs of the law shot out from the multitude,\r\n'I accept _you_, Mr. Flanders. Who will act for the prisoner?'\r\n\r\nEach one of the volunteers fell back, and no response came from any part\r\nof the ground. Mulock evidently was neither blessed nor cursed with many\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n'Does no one appear for the prisoner? Gentlemen of the legal profession,\r\nI am sorry to see this reluctance to aid a defenceless man. Will not\r\nsome one oblige _me_, by volunteering? I shall consider it a personal\r\nservice,' said Gaston.\r\n\r\nStill no response was heard. At least five minutes passed, and the\r\n'judge's' face was assuming a look of painful concern, when Larkin\r\napproached the bench.\r\n\r\n'Gintlemen,' he said, 'th' man hain't no friends, an' it's a d--d shame\r\nnot ter come out fur a feller as stands alone. Ef I knowed lor, I'd go\r\nin fur him, ef he wus th' devil himself.'\r\n\r\nNo one came forward in answer to even this appeal; and, turning on the\r\ncrowd, while warm, manly scorn glowed on his every feature, the\r\nnegro-trader cried out:\r\n\r\n'Ye're a set uv d--d sneakin' hounds, every one on ye. Ye're wuss than\r\nth' parsons, an' the' hain't fit ter tote vittles ter a bar.' Turning to\r\nthe 'judge,' he added, in a more respectful tone: 'I doan't know th'\r\nfust thing 'bout lor, Major Gaston, an' this man's nigh as mean a cuss\r\nas th' Lord ever made; but ef ye'll 'cept me, I'll go in fur him!'\r\n\r\n'I will accept you with pleasure. You're doing a gentlemanly thing, Mr.\r\nLarkin.'\r\n\r\nA murmur of applause went round the assemblage, as Larkin and the other\r\ncounsel took seats near the jury.\r\n\r\nThe 'judge' then rose, and said:\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen of the jury: You have engaged in a solemn office. You are\r\nabout to try a fellow being for his life. It is a painful duty, but it\r\nis an obligation you owe to the community, and to yourselves, and you\r\nwill not shrink from it. Society is held together by laws made to\r\nprotect the innocent and punish the guilty. But, as _our_ society is\r\norganized, there are some offences which our tribunals cannot reach. In\r\nsuch cases the people, from whom all laws proceed, have a right to take\r\nthe law into their own hands.\r\n\r\n'The prisoner is charged with crimes which, from the circumstances\r\nsurrounding their commission, cannot be reached by regular courts of\r\njustice. They were witnessed by none but blacks, whose testimony, by our\r\nstatutes, is not admissible. We, the people, therefore, are to try him;\r\nand, to get at the facts, we shall receive the evidence of negroes. You\r\nwill judge for yourselves as to its credibility. If any doubt of the\r\nprisoner's guilt rests in your minds, you will give him the benefit of\r\nit, and acquit him; but if, on the other hand, you are fully persuaded\r\nthat he committed either or both the crimes of which he is accused, you\r\nwill convict him. _You_ will patiently hear the testimony that may be\r\npresented; _I_ will honestly and impartially give sentence, according to\r\nthe decision at which you may arrive. The trial will now proceed.'\r\n\r\nThe witnesses were then examined. Ally was the first one sworn. He\r\ndeposed to the circumstances attending the whipping of Phyllis, and the\r\nassault on Selma; but, as his evidence was altogether hearsay--he not\r\nbeing present on either occasion--it was ruled out, as was also his\r\naccount of the bribing of Mulock by the mistress.\r\n\r\nThree other negroes were then called, and they proved that Mulock aided\r\nin dragging Selma to the whipping rack, and witnessed the beating; but\r\nthey failed to show that he was privy to or participated in the assault\r\non his wife. Others were examined, who saw parts of the two\r\ntransactions, and then the testimony closed.\r\n\r\nAs the last witness left the stand, Gaston said:\r\n\r\n'I shall allow the prisoner the benefit of the final appeal. The\r\nattorney for the people will now address the jury.'\r\n\r\nThe lawyer, a young man of no especial brilliancy or ability, rose, and,\r\ngoing rapidly over the testimony, drew the conclusion from it that\r\nMulock had instigated the beating of both mother and daughter, and was\r\ntherefore guilty of the assault and the murder, and should accordingly\r\nbe punished with death.\r\n\r\nThe motive actuating him he held to be revenge on Preston, for having,\r\nlong previously, debauched his wife Phyllis. This passion, held in check\r\nduring Preston's lifetime by fear of the consequences which might follow\r\nits indulgence, had broken out after his death, and wreaked itself on\r\nthe two defenceless women.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman's reasoning was not very cogent, but, what he lacked in\r\nlogic, he made up in bitter denunciation of Mulock, who, according to\r\nhis showing, was a little blacker than the prime minister of the lower\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nAs he took his seat, Larkin rose, and, addressing himself to both the\r\njury and the multitude, spoke, as near as I can recollect, as follows:\r\n\r\n'Gintlemen, this yere sort o' bis'ness is out uv my line. I'm not used\r\nter speechifyin', an' I may murder whot's called good English; but I'd a\r\ndurned sight ruther murder _thet_, then ter joodiciously, or ary other\r\nhow, murder a human bein'; an' it's my private 'pinion _ye'll_ murder\r\nMulock, ef ye bring him in guilty uv death.\r\n\r\n'A man hain't no right ter take human life, 'cept in self-defence. Even\r\nef Mulock was so bad as this loryer feller tries ter make him out--but\r\nhe hain't, 'cause 'tain't in natur for a man ter be wuss than th' devil\r\nhimself--ye'd hev no right to stop his breath. Ye didn't guv it ter him;\r\nit doan't b'long ter ye, an' th' lor doan't 'low ye ter take what hain't\r\nyour'n. Ef ye does, it's stealin', an' I knows thet none on the\r\ngintlemen uv the jury ar so allfired mean as ter steal--'ticularly ter\r\nsteal whot woan't be uv no sort o' use ter 'em, nohow.\r\n\r\n'The loryer yere, hes spread hisself on Mulock's motive fur doin' this\r\nthing; 'sistin' thet fur seventeen yar he's ben a nussin'\r\nsuthin--nussin' it as keerfully as a mother nusses her chil'ren. Now,\r\nyoung 'uns gin'rally walks when they's 'bout a yar old; but this one\r\nthet Mulock's ben a nussin' didn't git 'round till it wus seventeen; an'\r\nI reckon a bantlin' thet karn't gwo alone afore it's thet age, woan't\r\nnever do much hurt ter nobody.\r\n\r\n'But these hain't th' raal p'ints uv th' case. I'm loryer 'nuff ter tell\r\nye, ye must gwo on th' evidence; an' thar hain't no evidence ter show\r\nthet Mulock hed anything ter do with th' whippin' uv his wife; an' th'\r\n_murder_ wus in thet. He _did_--so th' nigs say, an' I reckon the' tells\r\nth' truth; an' thet's whot nary loryer kin do ef he try; so ye sees, a\r\n_nig_ is smarter nor a loryer. Wall, the nigs say he holped in whippin'\r\nth' white 'ooman; an', as 'torney fur th' _truth_, gintlemen, which I'm\r\ngwine in fur yere, I've got ter 'low it. He did aid an' 'bet, as the\r\nloryers call it, in thet, an' thet proves him 'bout as mean as a white\r\nman ever gits ter be; an', 'sides thet, he did _sell_ har fur twenty\r\ndollars--a 'ooman thet even th' 'judge'--an' he _ar_ a _judge_ uv sech\r\nthings--was willin' ter pay twenty-five hun'red fur; he _did_ sell har\r\nfur _twenty dollars_; an' thet proves him a fool! Now, fur bein' both\r\nmean an' a fool, I 'low he orter be punished. But doan't ye kill him,\r\ngintlemen! Guv it ter him 'cordin' ter his natur an' his merits.' Just\r\nluk at him. Hev ye ever seed sech a face, an' sech an eye as thet, in\r\nary human bein'? Why, his eye ar jest like a snake's; an' its natural,\r\nye knows, fur snakes ter crawl; the' karn't do nuthin' else, an' the'\r\nhain't ter blame fur it. No more ye karn't blame Mulock for bein' whot\r\nhe ar. So guv him a coat uv tar--a ride on a rail--a duckin' in th'\r\npond--arything thet's 'cordin' ter his natur an' his merits; but doan't\r\nye take 'way his _life_! Ef ye does thet, he's _lost_--LOST\r\nfurever; fur, I swar ter ye, his soul ar so small, thet ef it was once\r\nout uv his body, th' LORD himself couldn't find it, an' th'\r\npore feller'd hev ter gwo wand'rin' 'round with nary whar ter stay, an'\r\nnary friends, aither in heaven or t'other place! So be easy with him,\r\ngintlemen! Guv him one more chance. Let him stay yere a spell longer,\r\nfur yere his soul may grow. An' it _kin_ grow! Everything in natur\r\ngrows--even skunks; an' who knows but Mulock may sprout out yit, an'\r\ngrow ter be a MAN!\r\n\r\n'I'se nuthin' more ter say, gintlemen, only this: Afore ye make up yer\r\nminds ter bring Mulock in guilty uv death, jest put yerselfs inter his\r\nplace, an' ax yerselfs ef _ye'd_ like ter hev a rope put 'round yer\r\nwindpipe, as ye'd put it 'round his'n! Ef ye wudn't, jest remember,\r\n'tain't manly ter use ary 'nother man in a how ye wudn't like ter be\r\nused yerselfs. I'm done.'\r\n\r\nLarkin was frequently interrupted, during the delivery of this address,\r\nby the loud shouts and laughter of the crowd; but, at its close, a\r\nperfect tornado of applause swept over the multitude, and a hundred\r\nvoices called out:\r\n\r\n'No; doan't ye hang him.' 'Give him one more chance.' 'Doan't gwo more'n\r\nthe tar.' 'Larkin's a loryer, shore.'\r\n\r\nAmid these and similar exclamations, the jury retired to the little\r\ngrove of liveoaks. In about fifteen minutes they returned to their\r\nseats.\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen of the jury,' said Gaston, 'have you agreed on your verdict?'\r\n\r\n''Greed on one thing, Major Gaston,' said the foreman, rising; 'hain't\r\non t'other.'\r\n\r\n'On what have you agreed?'\r\n\r\n'On whippin' th' young 'ooman.'\r\n\r\n'What say you on that--guilty, or not guilty?'\r\n\r\n'Guilty.'\r\n\r\n'And so say you all?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, Major.'\r\n\r\n'How do you stand on the other charge?'\r\n\r\n'Four gwo in fur guilty; th' rest on us think Jake Larkin 'bout right as\r\nter hangin' on him.'\r\n\r\n'It is not for Mr. Larkin, or you, to say what shall be done with the\r\nprisoner. You are to decide whether he is or is not guilty of\r\ninstigating the murder of his wife. You must retire again, until you\r\nagree upon that.'\r\n\r\n''Twouldn't be uv no use; Major. We reckon he's mean 'nuff ter hev done\r\nit; but whether he done it, or no, we gwo fur givin' him a chance ter\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n'Ye're white men, I swar!' cried Larkin, springing from his seat, and\r\ngrasping the hands of several of the jurors in turn.\r\n\r\n'Take your seat, and observe order, Mr. Larkin,' said the judge, smiling\r\nin spite of himself.\r\n\r\n'All right,' said Larkin; 'ye're _some_ as a judge, Major--'bout up ter\r\nme as a loryer, an' thet's saying a heap; so jest be easy on th' pore\r\ndevil. _Do_, yer _Honor!_'\r\n\r\n'Silence, sir!' said Gaston, laughing.\r\n\r\nLarkin took his seat, and the 'judge' continued:\r\n\r\n'Prisoner, you have heard the verdict. Have you anything to say why\r\nsentence for aiding in the assault on the white lady should not now be\r\npassed upon you?'\r\n\r\n'No, Major Gaston; I've nothin' ter say,' said Mulock, dejectedly.\r\n\r\nGaston continued: 'You have been tried by a jury of your own selection.\r\nThey are unanimous in pronouncing you guilty of a cowardly and\r\nunwarrantable assault on a white woman. They evidently deem you guilty\r\nof the worse crime of abetting the murder of your own wife, and humane\r\nfeelings only deter them from saying so. In these circumstances, I feel\r\nit my duty to award you a more severe punishment than I should have done\r\nhad you been fully acquitted of the last charge. I shall therefore\r\nsentence you to be coated with warm tar, ducked, in that condition,\r\nthree times in the pond, and then ridden on a rail to your shop at\r\nTrenton; and may this example of public indignation lead you to a better\r\nlife in future. Mr. Larkin, I commission you to superintend the\r\nexecution of the sentence.'\r\n\r\n'No, ye don't, Major--yer _Honor_, I mean! I'll stand by, an' see Mulock\r\nhes far play; but I woan't do nary one's dirty work, I swar.'\r\n\r\n'Well, who will volunteer for the duty?' said Gaston, appealing to the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nAbout a score of 'natives' offered themselves; but, fixing his eye on a\r\nstout, goodnatured-looking man, who had not volunteered, Gaston said:\r\n\r\n'Won't _you_ do it, Mr. Moore?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, ter 'blige ye, Major, I will,' replied the man.\r\n\r\nThe 'judge' then pronounced the court adjourned, and the crowd escorted\r\nMulock and the impromptu executioners to the site of the old\r\ndistilleries. There an iron kettle filled with tar was already simmering\r\nover a light-wood fire, and, being divested of his borrowed plumage,\r\nMulock was soon clad in a close-fitting suit of black. He was about to\r\nbe led to the pond, when Ally appeared on the ground. Making his way\r\nthrough the crowd, he called out:\r\n\r\n'De young missus doan't want dis ting to gwo no fudder. She'll 'sider it\r\na 'ticular favor ef de gemmen'll leff Mulock gwo.'\r\n\r\n'We karn't let him off without consent uv the judge,' said Mr. Moore.\r\n\r\nA messenger was sent for Gaston, who soon appeared, and consented that\r\nfurther proceedings should be stopped. Mulock was at once released, and,\r\ncoatless, hatless, and all but trouserless, he made his way through the\r\nhooting multitude, and left the plantation, a blacker, if not a wiser\r\nand a better man.\r\n\r\nAs we walked away from the 'scene of execution,' I said to the\r\nnegro-trader:\r\n\r\n'Larkin, you should have been a lawyer; you managed that thing\r\nadmirably.'\r\n\r\n'Th' boys hed got thar blood up, an' I know'd I couldn't clar him. A man\r\nstands a sorry chance in sech a crowd, ef they's raally bent on\r\nmischief.'\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the remainder of the negroes were purchased by\r\nJoe; and in the afternoon I was on my way home.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nAs I was sitting in my library, late one evening, rather more than a\r\nmonth after the events recorded in the last chapter, a hasty ring came\r\nat the street door.\r\n\r\n'Who can be calling so late?' said Kate. 'Had _you_ not better go?'\r\n\r\nDrawing on my boots, I went to the door. As I opened it, my hand was\r\nsuddenly seized, and a familiar voice exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'What about Selly? How is she?'\r\n\r\n'Lord bless you, Frank! is this you? How did you get here?'\r\n\r\n'How is Selma! Tell me!'\r\n\r\n'Safe and well--in Mobile with Joe.'\r\n\r\n'Thank GOD! thank GOD for _that!_'\r\n\r\n'How did you get here?'\r\n\r\n'By the Africa; she's below. I managed to get up by a small boat. I\r\n_couldn't_ wait.'\r\n\r\n'Well, go up stairs. Your mother is in the library.'\r\n\r\nAfter the first greeting had passed between Kate and the newcomer, he\r\nplied me with questions in regard to Selma, I told him all, keeping\r\nnothing back. Meanwhile, he walked the room, struggling with contending\r\nemotions--now joy, now rage, now grief. He said nothing till I mentioned\r\nHallet's connection with the affair; then he spoke, and his words came\r\nlike the rushing of the tornado when it mows down the trees.\r\n\r\n'That is the _one_ thing too much. I have held back till now. Now he\r\n_dies_!'\r\n\r\n'Don't say that, my son!' exclaimed Kate. 'Leave him to his conscience,\r\nand to GOD. 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the\r\nLORD!''\r\n\r\n'Vengeance is MINE! Don't talk to me mother! I want no sermons\r\nnow!'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him sadly through her tears, and said:\r\n\r\n'Have I deserved this of _you_, Frank?'\r\n\r\n'Forgive me! forgive me, my mother!' and he buried his face in her\r\ndress, and wept--wept as he never did when a child.\r\n\r\nA half hour passed, and no one spoke. Then he rose, and said to me:\r\n\r\n'When did you hear from her last?'\r\n\r\n'_I_ had a letter yesterday; here it is,' said Kate. 'You see, she is\r\nexpecting you.'\r\n\r\nHe took it, and read it over slowly. All trace of his recent emotion had\r\ngone, and on his face was an expression I had never seen there before.\r\nFor the first time I noticed his resemblance to his father!\r\n\r\n'When will you go!' continued Kate.\r\n\r\n'I don't know. I cannot _now_.'\r\n\r\n'Why not _now_? What is there to prevent?'\r\n\r\n'I must go home first. I must see Cragin.'\r\n\r\n'Cragin does not expect you for a fortnight,' I said; 'you can be back\r\nby that time.'\r\n\r\n'But I _cannot_ go now!' and again he rose, and walked the room. 'I'm\r\nnot ready yet. My mind isn't made up.' After a pause, he added: 'Would\r\nyou have me marry a slave--a woman of negro blood?'\r\n\r\n'I would have you do as your feelings and your conscience dictate.'\r\n\r\n'You cannot love her, if you ask that question,' said Kate, kindly, but\r\nsorrowfully.\r\n\r\n'I _do_ love her. I love her better than man ever loved woman; but can I\r\nmake her my _wife_? A negro wife! negro children!--ha! ha!' and he\r\nclasped his hands above his head, and laughed that bitter, hollow laugh,\r\nwhich is the sure echo of fearful misery within.\r\n\r\n'I cannot advise you, my son. You must act, _now_, on your own judgment.\r\nI will only say, that through it all--when put at slave work--when bound\r\nto the whipping stake--when she stood on the auction block for two long\r\nhours--she was sustained _only_ by trust in _you_. It is true--she told\r\nme so; and if you forsake her now, it will'----\r\n\r\n'Kill her! I know it! I know it, O my GOD! my GOD!'\r\nand he groaned in agony--such agony as I never before saw rend the\r\nspirit of mortal man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning he started for Mobile. Ten days afterward, the\r\nfollowing telegram was handed me:\r\n\r\n     'Selma is dead. Frank is here, raving crazy. Come on at once.\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH PRESTON.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night I was on my way, and that day week I reached Mobile. The\r\nfirst person I met, as I entered Joe's warehouse, was Larkin.\r\n\r\n'Where is Joe?'\r\n\r\n'Ter th' plantation. He's lookin' fur ye. I'll tote ye thar ter onst.'\r\n\r\nIn half an hour we were on the road. We arrived just before dark, and\r\nat once I entered the mansion. Joe's hand was in mine in a moment.\r\n\r\n'What caused this terrible thing?' I asked, hastily, eagerly.\r\n\r\n'I don't know. When he arrived, Frank was low-spirited and moody, but\r\nvery glad to see me. I brought him up here at once. He seemed overjoyed\r\nat meeting Selma, and would not let her go out of his sight for a\r\nmoment. Still he appeared excited and uneasy, till I met him at the\r\nsupper table. Then he was more like himself. I went with them into the\r\nparlor, and there conversed with Frank on business matters for fully two\r\nhours. We planned some shipments to Europe, and talked over sending\r\nLarkin to Texas to buy cattle for the New Orleans market. We agreed on\r\nit. I was to provide means, by keeping ninety-day drafts afloat on them\r\n(I'm short, just now, having paid out so much for the negroes), and they\r\nand I were to divide the profits with Larkin. Frank's head was as clear\r\nas a bell. I had no idea he was so good a business man. Well, about\r\neight o'clock I left them together, and, a little after nine, went to\r\nbed. Selma's room is next to mine, and it couldn't have been later than\r\neleven when I heard her go to it.\r\n\r\n'The next morning she didn't come down as usual. I had a servant call\r\nher. She made no reply; but I thought nothing of it, till half an hour\r\nafterward. Then I went up myself. I rapped repeatedly, but got no\r\nanswer. Becoming alarmed, I sent a servant for an axe. Frank brought it\r\nup, and I battered down the door, and found her lying on the bed,\r\ndressed as usual, a half-empty bottle of laudanum beside\r\nher--DEAD!'\r\n\r\n'My GOD! And Frank made her do it!'\r\n\r\n'Don't say that. If he _did_, he is fearfully punished; he has suffered\r\nterribly.'\r\n\r\n'Where is he?'\r\n\r\n'In the front room. He has raved incessantly. At first four men couldn't\r\nhold him. Somehow, he got a knife, and cut himself badly. I got it away,\r\nbut he threw me in the struggle, and nearly throttled me. He's calmer\r\nnow, and I've had him untied; but old Joe has to stay with him night and\r\nday. Nobody else can manage him.'\r\n\r\nWe went into the room. Frank sat in one corner, pale, haggard, only the\r\nshadow of what he was but ten days before. His head was leaning against\r\nthe wall, and he was gazing out of the window.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, 'Boss Joe' came forward and greeted me, but neither of us\r\nspoke. Approaching Frank, I laid my hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n'My boy, I have come for you.'\r\n\r\nHe rose, and looked at me, a wild glare in his eyes.\r\n\r\n'Well, it's high time; I've waited long enough. I'm ready. I don't deny\r\nit--I killed her. Make short work of it. I'd have saved you the trouble,\r\nbut this infernal nigger told me I'd go to hell if I did it; and I know\r\n_she_ isn't there. I want to see her again! I want her to forgive me--to\r\nforgive me! Oh! oh!' and he sank into his chair, and moaned piteously.\r\n\r\n'He tinks you'm de sheriff, massa Kirke,' whispered Joe.\r\n\r\nI leaned over him. The tears started from my eyes, and fell on his face,\r\nas I said:\r\n\r\n'You _will_ see her again. She does pity and forgive you.'\r\n\r\nHe sprang from his seat, and clutched my hands. 'Do you believe it? Joe\r\nsays so; but Joe is a nigger, and what does a _nigger_ know?' Then,\r\nputting his mouth close to my ear, he added: 'They told me _she_ was\r\none. It was false--false as hell; but'--and he threw his arms above his\r\nhead, and groaned the rest--'but it made me say it. O my GOD!\r\nmy GOD! it made me say it!' His head sank on my shoulder, and\r\nagain he gave out those piteous moans.\r\n\r\n'Have comfort, my boy. I know she loves and pities you, _now_!'\r\n\r\nHe looked up. 'Say that again! For the love of God say that again!'\r\n\r\n'It is so! As sure as there's another life, it is so!'\r\n\r\nHe gazed at me fixedly for a few moments--then again commenced pacing\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n'I wish I could believe it. But _you_ ought to know; you look like a\r\nparson. You are a parson, aren't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I'm a parson. I _know_ it is so!'\r\n\r\n'Well, tell them to hurry up. I want to go to her at once--_now_! I\r\ncan't live another week in this way. Tell them to hurry up.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I will; and you'll go with me to-morrow, won't you?'\r\n\r\nHe gave me again, a long, scrutinizing look. 'You're the sheriff, aren't\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, I'll go with you. But you must promise to make short work\r\nof it.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes; I'll promise that. But lie down now, and be quiet. I'll be\r\nready for you in the morning.'\r\n\r\n'Well, well, I'll try to be patient;' and he threw himself on the small\r\ncot in one corner of the room. 'But you'll let old Joe stay with me,\r\nwon't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; certainly.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir. Joe, bring me a cigar--that's a good fellow. You're the\r\ndecentest nigger I ever knew. It's an awful pity you're black. They told\r\nme _she_ was black. 'Twas an infernal lie! I know it, for I saw her last\r\nnight, and she was whiter than any woman you ever saw. Black! Pshaw!\r\nnobody but the devil's black; and _she_--she's an angel NOW!'\r\n\r\nAs we passed out of the room, Joe said to me:\r\n\r\n'Would you like to see Selma?'\r\n\r\n'Have you kept the body?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I knew you would want to see her.'\r\n\r\nHe led the way up stairs to her chamber. In a plain, air-tight coffin,\r\nlay all that was left of the slave girl. Her hands were crossed on her\r\nbosom; her long, glossy, brown hair fell over her neck, and on her face\r\nwas the look the angels wear. She seemed not dead, but sleeping!\r\n\r\nAs I turned away, Joe took my hand, and, while a nervous spasm passed\r\nover his face, he said:\r\n\r\n'She was all that I had; but I--I forgive him!'\r\n\r\n'And for that, GOD will forgive _you_!'\r\n\r\nThe next day we buried her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Boss Joe' accompanied us to the North. We reached home just after dark.\r\nWhen we entered the parlor, Frank gazed around with an eager, curious\r\nlook, as if some familiar scene was returning to him. In a few moments\r\nKate entered. She rushed to him, and clasped him in her arms. He took\r\nher face between his two hands, and looked long and earnestly at her.\r\nThen, dropping his head on her shoulder, and bursting into tears, he\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n'My mother! O my mother!'\r\n\r\nHe had awoke. The terrible dream was over. From that moment he was\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between him and Selma on that fatal evening, I never knew.\r\nHe has not spoken her name since that night.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dawsey lay at the mansion, under guard, for several weeks. When\r\nfinally able to be moved she was conveyed to the 'furnished apartments'\r\nbespoken for her by Joe. Her husband, after a short confinement in jail,\r\nwas set at liberty, and then made strenuous efforts to effect his wife's\r\nrelease on bail. He did not succeed. Public feeling ran very high\r\nagainst her; and that, probably more than the fact that she was charged\r\nwith an unbailable crime, operated to prolong her residence at the\r\npublic boarding house kept for runaway slaves and common felons at\r\nTrenton.\r\n\r\nAt the next session of the 'county court,' after an imprisonment of\r\nfour months, she was arraigned for trial. Owing to the death of Selma,\r\nMulock was the only white witness against her. He told a straightforward\r\nstory, the most rigid cross-examination not swerving him from it, and\r\ndeposed to Dawsey's having attempted to bribe him to go away. His\r\nevidence was conclusive as to the prisoner's guilt; but her counsel, an\r\nable man, made so damaging an assault on his personal character, that\r\nthe jury disagreed. Mrs. Dawsey was then remanded to jail to await a new\r\ntrial, at the next sitting of the court.\r\n\r\nShortly after the trial, Mulock suddenly disappeared. Hearing of it, and\r\nsuspecting he had been spirited away by Dawsey, Joseph Preston went to\r\nTrenton, and, procuring a judge's order for Mulock's arrest as an\r\nabsconding witness, caused a thorough search to be made for him in Jones\r\nand the adjoining counties. He himself visited Chalk Level, in Harnett\r\nCounty, and there found him, living again with his white wife. That lady\r\nhad previously won and lost a second spouse, but, it appeared, was then\r\nin such straits for another husband, that she was willing to take up\r\nwith her own cast-off household furniture. Whether a new marriage\r\nceremony was performed, or not, I never learned; but I have been\r\nreliably informed that Mulock complained bitterly of his wife for having\r\ndefrauded him of twenty-five of the fifty dollars she had agreed to pay\r\nas consideration for his again sharing her 'bed and board.'\r\n\r\nMulock admitted having received four hundred dollars from Dawsey for\r\nabsenting himself, and gave, as an excuse for accepting the bribe, his\r\nconviction that Mrs. Dawsey could not be found guilty on his testimony.\r\nAfter his arrest he was confined in the same jail with the 'retired'\r\nschoolmistress.\r\n\r\nThe second trial was approaching; but, late on the night preceding the\r\nsitting of the court, the jailer's house--which adjoined and\r\ncommunicated with the prison--was forcibly entered by four armed men\r\ndisguised as negroes. They bound and gagged the jailer, his wife, and\r\ntwo female servants, and, seizing the keys, entered the jail, and\r\ncarried Mulock off by force. The keeper heard a desperate struggle, and\r\nit was supposed Mulock was foully dealt by. The footprints of four men\r\nwere the next morning detected leading to a spot on the bank of the\r\nriver, where a boat appeared to have been moored; but there all traces\r\nwere lost, and the overseer's fate is still shrouded in mystery.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dawsey, whose cell adjoined Mulock's, was not disturbed, but public\r\nsuspicion connected her husband with the affair. There was, however, no\r\nevidence against him, and he went 'unwhipped of justice.'\r\n\r\nThe lady was arraigned for trial on the following day, but, no witnesses\r\nappearing against her, she was--after a tedious confinement of ten\r\nmonths--set at liberty. Thus, at last, she achieved 'a plantation and a\r\nrich planter;' but her darling object in life--to lead and shine in\r\nsociety, for which her education and character peculiarly fitted\r\nher--she missed. With the exception of her brutal husband, an ignorant\r\noverseer, and a superannuated 'schulemarm,' imported from the North, she\r\nhas no associates. Society has built up a wall about her, and, with the\r\nbrand of Cain on her forehead, she is going through the world.\r\n\r\nLarkin, after breaking off his connection with his 'respectable\r\nassociates,' descended from trading in human cattle, to trafficking in\r\nfourfooted beasts, and all manner of horned animals. Joe offered him an\r\ninterest in his business; but the negro-trader had too long led a roving\r\nlife to be content with the dull routine of regular business. Young\r\nPreston, and Cragin, Mandell & Co., stipulating for a half of his\r\nprofits, furnished him a capital of fifty thousand dollars; and with\r\nthat he embarked largely in 'cattle driving.' He bought in Texas, and\r\nsold in New Orleans, and did a profitable business until the breaking\r\nout of the rebellion. Since that event he has been an officer in the\r\nconfederate army.\r\n\r\nFrank remained at my house for a fortnight after his return from the\r\nSouth, and then, apparently restored, went to Boston. Business had grown\r\ndistasteful to him, and he sought a dissolution with Cragin; but the\r\nlatter prevailed on him to remain in the firm, and go to Europe. He\r\ncontinued there until news reached Liverpool of the fall of Fort Sumter.\r\nThen he took the first steamer for home. Arriving in Boston, he at once\r\neffected a dissolution with Cragin, and then came on to New York to make\r\nhis 'mother' a short visit prior to entering the army. He expressed the\r\nintention of enlisting as a private, and I tried to dissuade him from\r\nit, by representing how easily he could raise a company in Boston, and\r\ngo as an officer. 'No,' he replied; 'I know nothing of tactics. I am\r\nunfit to lead; I can only fire a musket. With one on my shoulder, I will\r\ngo and sell my life as dearly as I can.'\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May, 1861, he left New York, a private in Duryee's\r\nZouaves (5th Regiment N. Y. V.), and on the 10th of June following,\r\nwhile fighting bravely by the side of York, Winthrop, and Greble, at Big\r\nBethel, fell, badly wounded by a musket ball.\r\n\r\nWhen he was fit to be moved, I had him conveyed home. His recovery was\r\nslow, but, as soon as he was able to go out, and, while still suffering\r\nfrom his wound, he went on to Boston to render Cragin some assistance in\r\nhis business. General Butler's expedition was then fitting out for New\r\nOrleans. Weak as he was, Frank raised a company of Boston boys for it,\r\nand went off as their captain.\r\n\r\nHe was present at the bombardment and capture of New Orleans; but\r\ngrowing weary of the inactivity which followed those events, and hearing\r\nof the stirring times in Tennessee, he resolved to resign his\r\ncommission, and seek service in the Western army.\r\n\r\nAfter his resignation had been accepted, and on the eve of his departure\r\nfor the North, when returning, one night, to his lodgings, he was\r\naccosted by a woman of the street. Her face seemed familiar, and he\r\nasked her name. She answered, 'Rosey Preston.' He went with her to her\r\nhome--a miserable room in the third story of a tumbledown shanty in\r\nChartres street--and there found her child, a bright little fellow of\r\nabout six years. With them, on the following day, he sailed for the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nArriving here, he settled on Rosey the income of a small sum, and\r\nprocured her apartments in a modest tenement house in East Thirtieth\r\nstreet. There Rosey now works at her needle, and the little boy attends\r\na public school.\r\n\r\nWithin the week of Frank's arrival, and when he was about setting out\r\nfor the West, I was surprised one morning, by Ally's appearance in my\r\noffice. Newbern had fallen, and he had made his way, with his mother,\r\ninto the Union lines, and, after a good deal of difficulty, had secured\r\na passage on a return transport to New York. I provided employment for\r\nhis mother, but Ally insisted on going into the war with Frank. He went\r\nas his servant, but fought at his side at Lawrenceburgh, Dog Walk,\r\nChaplin Hills, and Frankfort, and in three of those engagements was\r\nwounded. His bones now whiten the plains of Tennessee. Rosey he never\r\nsaw, and never forgave.\r\n\r\nFrank was with the small body of regulars who, at Murfreesboro, on the\r\n31st of December, checked the advance of Hardee's corps after McCook's\r\ndivision had been driven from the field, and who saved the day. He was\r\nwounded in the arm, early in the morning, but kept the field, and joined\r\nin that heroic movement wherein fifteen hundred men marched through an\r\nopen field, and charged a body of ten thousand posted in a grove of\r\ncedars. Six hundred and forty-six of the brave band were left on the\r\nfield. Frank was one of them. A Belgian ball pierced his side, and came\r\nout at his back. He saw and recognized the man who gave him the wound,\r\nand, raising himself on his elbow, fired a last shot. It did its work.\r\nThe rebel lies buried where Frank fell.\r\n\r\nThe telegram which informed me of this event, said: 'He is desperately\r\nwounded, but may survive.' He is now at home, slowly recovering. What he\r\nsaw and did while serving in Kentucky and Tennessee, I may at some\r\nfuture time narrate to the reader.\r\n\r\nIn relating actual events, a writer cannot in all cases visit artistic\r\njustice on each one of his characters; for, in real life, retribution\r\ndoes not always appear to follow crime. But, whatever _appearances_ may\r\nbe, who is there that does not feel that virtue is ever its own reward,\r\nand vice its own punishment? and what one of my readers would exchange\r\n'a quiet conscience, void of offence toward God and toward man,' for the\r\nprincely fortune of John Hallet--who is still the great merchant, the\r\n'exemplary citizen,' the 'honest man'?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST WORDS.\r\n\r\nWhoever comes before the American people in a time of great _deeds_ like\r\nthis, with mere _words_, should have no idle story to tell. He should\r\nhave something to say; some fact to relate, or truth to communicate,\r\nwhich may awaken his countrymen to a true estimate of their interests,\r\nor a true sense of their duties.\r\n\r\nThe writer of these articles _has_ something to say; some facts to\r\nrelate which have not been told; some truths to communicate about\r\nSouthern life and society, which the public ought to know. Some of these\r\nfacts, gathered during sixteen years of intimate business and social\r\nintercourse with the planters and merchants of the South, he has\r\nendeavored to embody in this volume.\r\n\r\nHe has woven them into a story, but they are nevertheless facts, and\r\nall, excepting one, occurred under his own observation. That one--the\r\ndeath of old Jack--was communicated to him as a fact, by his friend, Dr.\r\nW. H. Holcombe, of Waterproof, La., now an officer in the confederate\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThe author does not mean to say that his story is true as a connected\r\nwhole. It is not. In it, persons are brought into intimate relations who\r\nnever had any connection in life; events are grouped together which\r\nhappened at widely different times; and incidents are described as\r\noccurring in the vicinity of Newbern--the slave auction, for\r\ninstance--parts of which occurred in Alabama, parts in Georgia, and\r\nparts in Louisiana. But all of the characters he has described _have_\r\nlived, and all of the events he has related _have_ transpired. He would,\r\nhowever, not have the reader believe that all he says of himself is\r\ntrue. Some of it is; some of it is not. The story needed some one to\r\nrevolve around; and, as he began by using the personal pronoun, he\r\ncontinued its use, even in parts--like the scenes with Hallet, wherein\r\nthe _I_ stands for entirely another individual.\r\n\r\nThe real name of the character whom he has called Selma (he can state\r\nthis without wounding the feelings of any one, as none of her relatives\r\nare now living), was Selma Winchester. She was educated at Cambridge,\r\nMass., was a slave, and died of a broken heart shortly after being put\r\nat menial labor in her mother-in-law's kitchen. Her character and\r\nappearance, even the costume she wore on the occasion of her visit to\r\nthe opera--a scene which many residents of Boston and vicinity will\r\nremember--are attempted to be described literally. She was not the\r\ndaughter of Preston; _her_ father was a very different sort of man. Nor\r\nwas she sold at auction. The young woman who was engaged to 'Frank\r\nMandell,' and bought at the sale by her brother, was equally as\r\naccomplished, though not so beautiful as Selma. She committed suicide,\r\nas herein related. The author has blended the two characters into one,\r\nbut in no particular has he departed from the truth.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman called Preston in the story was for many years one of the\r\nwriter's correspondents. He had two wives, such as are described, and\r\nwas the father of Joe and Rosey, whose connection was as is related. He\r\nwas _not_ the owner of 'Boss Joe.' The original of that character\r\nbelonged (and the writer trusts still belongs) to a cotton planter in\r\nAlabama. He managed two hundred hands, and in no respect is he overdrawn\r\nin the story. His sermon is repeated from memory, and is far inferior to\r\nthe original. He was a Swedenborgian, and one of the finest natural\r\norators the writer ever listened to. Old Deborah was his mother, and\r\ndied comfortably in her bed. The old woman who fell dead on the auction\r\nblock, was the nurse of the young woman who was engaged to Frank. The\r\nexcitement of the scene, and her anxiety for her 'young missus,' killed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nLarkin's real name is Jacob Larkin. He was at one time connected with\r\nthe person called Hallet. He was well known in many parts of the South,\r\nand relinquished Negro trading under circumstances similar to those\r\nrelated in the story. He is now--though a rebel in arms against his\r\ncountry--an honest man.\r\n\r\nJohn Hallet, the writer is sorry to say, is also a real character; but\r\nhe does not disgrace the good city of Boston. He operates on a wider\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat most excellent woman, Mrs. C. M. Kirkland, said to the author,\r\nshortly after the fall of Fort Sumter: 'If you cannot shoulder a musket,\r\nyou can blow a bugle.' In this, and in a previous book, he has attempted\r\nto blow that bugle. If the blasts are not as musical as they might be,\r\nhe has no apology to make for them. They have, at least, the ring of\r\n_truth;_ and whether they please the public ear, or not, the author is\r\nsatisfied; for he knows that each one of his children will say of him,\r\nwhen he is gone:\r\n\r\n'_My_ father did not stand by with folded arms, while this great nation\r\nwas threatened with ruin. Against his best friends--against the\r\nconvictions of a lifetime--he spoke the TRUTH! He _tried_ to do\r\nsomething for his country.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'MAY MORNING'\r\n\r\n\r\n  Oh! the sky is blue, and the sward is green,\r\n    And the soft winds wake from the balmy west,--\r\n  The leaves unfold in their gilded sheen,\r\n    And the bird, in the tree top, builds its nest;\r\n  The truant zephyr plumes her wings\r\n    Once more, and quitting her perfumed bed,\r\n  Soft calls on the sleeping flowers to wake,\r\n    And sportive roams o'er each dewclad head.\r\n\r\n  The bluebells nod within the wood,\r\n    The snowdrop peeps from its milky bell,\r\n  The motley Thora bends her hood,\r\n    Whilst beauteous wild flowers line the dell;\r\n  The wildbrier rose its fragrance breathes,\r\n    The violet opes her cup of blue,\r\n  The timid primrose lifts its leaves,\r\n    And kingcups wake, all bathed in dew.\r\n\r\n  From flower to flower the wild bee roams,\r\n    Then buried within the cowslip's cup,\r\n  He murmurs his low and music tones,\r\n    Till she folds the wanton intruder up;\r\n  The spring bird, wakening, soars on high,\r\n    Gushing aloft its melting lay;\r\n  Whilst painted clouds flit o'er the sky,\r\n    All ushering in the dawn of May!\r\n\r\n  Like a laughing nymph she springs to light,\r\n    And tripping along in the world of flowers,\r\n  Brushes the dew, in the morning bright,\r\n    And weaves a joy for each heart of ours!\r\n  With frolic hands, the daisy meek,\r\n    From her lap of green she playful throws;\r\n  Whilst the loveliest flowers spring round her feet,\r\n    And fragrance bursts from the wild wood rose!\r\n\r\n  Oh! glad is the heart, as through leafing trees\r\n    The soft winds roam and in music play;\r\n  Whilst the sick come forth for the healing breeze,\r\n    And rejoice in the birth of the beauteous May,\r\n  And glad is the heart of the joyous child,\r\n    As bounding away through the tangled dell,\r\n  It roams 'mid the flowers in greenwoods mild,\r\n    And hunts the caged bee in the cowslip's bell!\r\n\r\n  Oh! bright is this world--'tis a world of gems--\r\n    And loveliness lingers where'er we tread;\r\n  On the mountain top--or in lone wood glens:\r\n    A spirit of beauty o'er all is spread!\r\n  Then warmed be our hearts to that kindly Power\r\n    That scatters bright roses o'er life's rough way;\r\n  That unfolds the cup of the snowdrop's flower,\r\n    And mantles the earth with the gems of May!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no branch of our service which is more efficient at the\r\npresent time than that of the navy. Since the war of 1812, we have been\r\ncomparatively inactive, with the exception of some coast service during\r\nthe Mexican war, which was scarcely worth mentioning. In the present\r\ncivil war, however, our navy has increased in a tenfold\r\nproportion--increased in activity and efficiency--and to-day, with its\r\nsuperior force of iron-clad steamers, will favorably compare with any\r\nnavy on the globe in power, even though it may be inferior in a\r\nnumerical point.\r\n\r\nThough crippled at first at the commencement of this rebellion by the\r\ntraitors among her officers in command--crippled by the loss of vessels\r\nand property destroyed by rebels--her ranks thinned by resignations and\r\ndesertions, the navy struggled onward, slowly but surely, gaining\r\nvitality and power, until, under the present administration, it has\r\n'lengthened its cords and strengthened its stakes,' attaining its\r\npresent efficiency. Accessions have been made in vessels, new grades of\r\nofficers have been appointed, the various bureaus have been enlarged,\r\nand an immense number of volunteer officers have been appointed, mostly\r\nchosen from petty officers and seamen, or from the merchant service, to\r\ncommand armed transports and the smaller craft used for the shallow\r\nwaters of the Atlantic coast. A strong blockade has been effected, a\r\nnumber of valuable prizes taken, and the navy has rendered invaluable\r\nservice by its bombardments of the enemy's towns and fortifications, on\r\nthe coast of the United States as well as along the banks of the\r\nMississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee rivers. In fact, much is due to the\r\nnavy for its great efficiency in the present civil war in America.\r\n\r\nWe will give to the reader some statistics, taken from the September\r\nissue of the Naval Register for 1862, from which an idea can be formed\r\nof the great strength of this branch of our service. As these statistics\r\nare official, they will serve as a valuable source of information to\r\nthose who are interested in the welfare of the country. Let us then\r\nreview the organization of the United States navy.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the navy is as follows: The Navy Department, which\r\nconsists of the office of the Secretary of the Navy and its various\r\nbureaus, and the officers of the navy, consisting of officers of the\r\nnavy, officers of the marine corps, and warrant officers, besides\r\nvolunteer and acting volunteer officers, these two last being new\r\ngrades. There is no list of petty officers and seamen published in the\r\nRegister, these being simply kept on the unpublished rolls, kept in the\r\noffice of the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nIn the Navy Department proper may be found the following officers: The\r\nSecretary of the Navy; his Assistant; the chiefs of the bureaus of yards\r\nand docks, equipment, and recruiting, navigation, ordnance, construction\r\nand repair, steam engineering, provisions and clothing, and medicine and\r\nsurgery. Since the publishing of the last annual Register, one of these\r\nbureaus is a new organization--the bureau of navigation not yet\r\nperfected. It will be seen by referring to this Register that the office\r\nof the Secretary of the Navy and the bureaus attached, require, besides\r\nthe chief officers, one engineer, forty-four clerks, five draughtsmen,\r\nand eight messengers.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the navy proper are divided into the following grades:\r\nRear admirals, commodores, captains, commanders, lieutenant commanders,\r\nlieutenants, surgeons ranking with commanders, surgeons ranking with\r\nlieutenants, passed assistant surgeons ranking next after lieutenants,\r\nassistant surgeons ranking next after masters, paymasters ranking with\r\ncommanders, paymasters ranking with lieutenants, assistant paymasters,\r\nchaplains, professors of mathematics, masters in the line of promotion,\r\nmasters not in the line of promotion, passed midshipmen, midshipmen\r\ndetached from the naval academy and ordered into active service,\r\nboatswains, gunners, carpenters, sailmakers, navy agents, naval store\r\nkeepers, naval constructors, officers of the naval academy, officers on\r\nspecial service, engineers in chief, first assistants, second\r\nassistants, third assistants, and officers of the marine corps.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer officers of the navy are acting lieutenants, acting\r\nvolunteer lieutenants, acting masters, acting ensigns, acting master's\r\nmates, acting assistant surgeons, acting assistant paymasters and\r\nclerks, and acting first, second, and third engineers.\r\n\r\nThe petty officers of the navy are comprised as follows: Yeomen,\r\narmorers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, sailmakers, and armorer's\r\nmates, master-at-arms, ship's corporals, coxswains, quarter masters,\r\nquarter gunners, captains of forecastle, tops, afterguard, and hold,\r\ncoopers, painters, stewards, ship's officers, surgeons, assistant\r\nsurgeons and paymasters, stewards, nurses, cooks, masters of the band,\r\nmusicians, first and second class, seamen, ordinary seamen, landsmen,\r\nboys, first and second class firemen, and coal heavers.\r\n\r\nThe ranking of officers of the navy compared to the grades of the army\r\nmay thus be enumerated: An admiral of the navy ranks with a major\r\ngeneral in the army, a commodore as a brigadier general, a captain as a\r\ncolonel, a commander as a lieutenant colonel, a lieutenant commander as\r\na major, a lieutenant as a captain, a master as a first lieutenant, and\r\nan ensign (the new grade) as second lieutenant. The senior rear admiral\r\nof the navy, Charles Stewart of Pennsylvania, now on the retired list,\r\nranks as a major general commanding in chief, and is the highest\r\nofficial in the navy except the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the navy is quite an item in the list of Government\r\nexpenditures. A few statistics relative to the expenditures will not\r\nprove uninteresting to the reader. The pay of seven admirals in the\r\nactive list, commanding squadrons, and of fourteen rear admirals in the\r\nretired list, is $87,000; of twenty-six commanders and six on the\r\nretired list, is $117,860; of seventy captains on the active list,\r\n$239,300; thirty-two on the retired list, $85,400; one hundred and\r\nseventy commanders on active list, $554,380, and nine on the reserved\r\nlist, $18,800; two hundred and forty-four lieutenant commanders, active\r\nlist, $672,000; one hundred and eighty surgeons of various grades,\r\n$708,000; ten passed assistant surgeons, $8,700; two hundred and\r\neighteen assistant surgeons, $422,900; eighty-one paymasters, $81,000;\r\nsixty assistant paymasters, $67,850; twenty-three chaplains, $34,500;\r\ntwelve professors of mathematics, $21,600; seventeen masters, $18,320;\r\nthree passed midshipmen, and one midshipman (old list), $4,308; four\r\nhundred and eighteen midshipmen, graduates of the naval academy,\r\n$259,600; fifty-four gunners, $67,500; forty-two acting gunners,\r\n$33,600; sixty carpenters, $60,000; forty-six sailmakers, $43,650; eight\r\nnavy agents, $25,000; twelve naval store keepers, $18,000; nine naval\r\nconstructors, $16,200; engineers and assistants, $756,700; officers of\r\nthe naval academy, $759,000; officers of the marine corps, $536,000;\r\nacting volunteer officers of the navy of all grades, $2,975,300, and\r\npetty officers and seamen, $2,560,000; making a total of $10,863,118,\r\nfor pay alone.\r\n\r\nLet us add to this, other expenses to swell out the list. For clerk hire\r\nalone it is said that $600,000 is annually paid out; for navy yards and\r\ndepots, $12,583,280 64; for the different bureaus, $8,325,161; and for\r\ncontingent expenses, $2,600,000. Add to this the pay of the hospitals,\r\n$1,200,000; for magazines, $200,000; repair and equipment, $11,400,000;\r\nchartering and purchasing of vessels for naval purposes, $10,800,000;\r\nthus making a total of $47,708,441 64, which, added to the pay of the\r\nnavy, makes the annual expenditure $58,571,559 64.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to the vessels of the United States navy.\r\nIn this department has the navy greatly increased within a few years. To\r\ngive the reader an idea of our navy, we append the following statistical\r\naccount of the vessels, giving their class, tonnage, number of guns,\r\nname, and station, which cannot but be of great interest to all who are\r\ninterested in the affairs of the nation. We will give them in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\nSHIPS OF THE LINE--6.\r\n\r\n  Alabama        84 guns,   2,663 tons.\r\n  New Orleans    84 \"       2,805 \"\r\n  North Carolina 84 \"       2,633 \"\r\n  Ohio           84 \"       2,757 \"\r\n  Vermont        84 \"       2,633 \"\r\n  Virginia       84 \"       2,633 \"\r\n\r\nOf these, the Alabama is on the stocks at Kittery, Maine, the New\r\nOrleans on the stocks at Sackett's Harbor, and the Virginia on the\r\nstocks at Boston. The Vermont is store ship at Port Royal, South\r\nCarolina, while the North Carolina and Ohio are receiving ships at\r\nBoston and New York. The Pennsylvania, 120-gun ship, was destroyed by\r\nthe rebels at Gosport, Virginia, last year. This class of vessels are\r\nthe most ineffective we have in the service, the Ohio being the only one\r\nwhich has done good service.\r\n\r\nSAILING FRIGATES--6.\r\n\r\n  Brandywine      50 guns,  1,726 tons.\r\n  Potomac         50 \"      1,726 \"\r\n  Sabine          50 \"      1,726 \"\r\n  Santee          50 \"      1,726 \"\r\n  St. Lawrence    50 \"      1,726 \"\r\n  Independence[2] 50 \"      2,257 \"\r\n\r\nThe Brandywine, Independence, and Potomac are used as receiving and\r\nstore ships.

We\r\nnow give a table of the steam vessels of all descriptions in our navy,\r\nwhich are the most valuable auxiliaries we have. It is probably the\r\nmost effective steam navy in the world, and in its department of huge\r\niron-clads cannot be excelled even by the navies of the old world. The\r\nsteam vessels of our navy may thus be enumerated:\r\n\r\nSTEAM FRIGATES--9.\r\n\r\n  Colorado               48 guns, 3,435 tons.\r\n  Niagara                34  \"    4,582  \"\r\n  Powhatan               11  \"    2,415  \"\r\n  Minnesota              48  \"    3,307  \"\r\n  Mississippi[4]         12  \"    1,692  \"\r\n  Princeton               8  \"      900  \"\r\n  San Jacinto            12  \"    1,446  \"\r\n  Saranac                 9  \"    1,446  \"\r\n  Susquehanna            17  \"    2,450  \"\r\n\r\nThe Niagara, one of the finest screw frigates in the navy, and which,\r\nwith the Colorado, is now repairing, is noted for being connected with\r\nthe Atlantic cable expedition, as well as for conveying the Japanese\r\nembassy home. She is the pet of the navy, and great credit is due the\r\nlate George Steers for such a splendid specimen of naval architecture.\r\nThe Powhattan, Minnesota, and Mississippi are attached to the South\r\nAtlantic Squadron; the San Jacinto to the East Gulf Squadron; the\r\nSusquehanna to the West Gulf Squadron, and the Saranac to the Pacific\r\nSquadron. The old Princeton is the receiving ship at Philadelphia.

A number of our ocean mail steamers have\r\nbeen purchased by the Department, such as the Augusta, Florida, Alabama,\r\nQuaker City, Keystone State, and State of Georgia; while others have\r\nbeen taken from our rivers flowing into the Atlantic, on which this last\r\nclass of vessels were formerly plying. In the South Atlantic Squadron\r\nare fifteen of this class of transport steamers; fifteen in the North\r\nAtlantic; four in the Western Gulf; one in the East Gulf; one in the\r\nBrazil, and three in the West India Squadrons. There are also twelve in\r\nthe Potomac Flotilla; one in the Western Flotilla; two supply steamers;\r\nand three in ordinary; with one receiving ship. In the Potomac Flotilla\r\nis the captured rebel gunboat Teaser. The De Soto may also be added to\r\nthis class, carrying 9 guns of 1,600 tons, and at present attached to\r\nthe Western Gulf Squadron.\r\n\r\nWe now call the attention of the reader to that most formidable class of\r\nvessels in our navy,\r\n\r\nIRON-CLAD STEAMERS--15.\r\n\r\nThe iron-clads of our navy are divided into two classes--the river and\r\nocean steamers, as also steam rams. We will first notice the ocean\r\nclass:\r\n\r\n  Galena         6 guns, 738 tons.\r\n  Monitor[6]     3 \"     776 \"\r\n  New Ironsides 18 \"   3,486 \"\r\n  Roanoke        6 \"   3,435 \"\r\n\r\nThe Galena and Monitor have been well tested in the present war, but the\r\nGalena at present is considered a failure. The New Ironsides, now on\r\nspecial service, is said to be one of the most formidable iron-clad\r\nvessels in the world. Of the iron-clad river steamers, we enumerate the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  Benton          16 guns, 1,000 tons.\r\n  Baron de Kalb   13 \"       512 \"\r\n  Cairo           13 \"       512 \"\r\n  Cincinnati      13 \"       512 \"\r\n  Carondelet      13 \"       512 \"\r\n  Essex            7 \"     1,000 \"\r\n  Louisville      13 \"       468 \"\r\n  Lexington        7 \"       500 \"\r\n  Mound City      13 \"       512 \"\r\n  Pittsburgh      13 \"       512 \"\r\n  Tyler            9 \"       600 \"\r\n\r\nThe Galena is in the North Atlantic Squadron; the New Ironsides in\r\nspecial service; the Roanoke repairing in New York; and the river\r\niron-clads are attached to the Western Flotilla.\r\n\r\nIRON-CLAD RAMS--12.\r\n\r\n  General Bragg        2 guns, 700 tons.\r\n  Gen.

Of these are four of immense size, viz., the Puritan,\r\nTonawanda, Tecumseh, and Onondaga. The mammoth iron-clad of all is the\r\nenormous Dunderburg, carrying 10 guns of from fifteen to twenty inches\r\nin calibre, and having a tonnage of 5,019 tons. The Dictator is another\r\nimmense iron-clad. Of the river Gunboat Fleet, the Catawba and\r\nTippecanoe stand as first class, carrying heavy nine and eleven inch\r\nDahlgren guns.\r\n\r\nThe building of these ocean iron-clads is at the following places: Nine\r\nof them are building at New York; three at Brooklyn; one at Portsmouth;\r\ntwo at Jersey City; four at Boston; two at Chester; two at Pittsburgh;\r\none at Brownsville, Pennsylvania; and one at Wilmington, Delaware. The\r\nriver iron-clads are built at the following places: Five at Cincinnati;\r\nsix at St. Louis; and one at Mound City, Illinois. Of the first-class\r\nsteam gunboats, eleven are building at New York; four at Boston; two at\r\nPortland, Maine; two at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; one at Bordentown,\r\nNew Jersey; one at Brooklyn; two at Philadelphia; one at Chester; and\r\ntwo at Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe other vessels building in the yards are as follows: the steam\r\nfrigate Franklin, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; the steam sloops\r\nJuniata, Monongahela, and Shenandoah, at Philadelphia; the Lackawanna\r\nand Ticonderoga, at New York; and the Ossipee and Sacramento, at\r\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of contracts out for new gunboats and steamers,\r\nwhich, when completed, will make us the most formidable navy in the\r\nworld. In conclusion, we will give to the reader the following table,\r\nclassifying the vessels now in our navy, and giving statistics of their\r\ntonnage and the number of guns which they carry:\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n                        Vessels.

The Greek never solaced his leisure with\r\nthe latest tale of a gifted Charicles or Aristarchus, and the grave\r\nRoman would have been as much startled by a 'new novel' as by the\r\napparition of a steam engine. The famous Minerva press was the first\r\nmighty wellspring whence gushed the broad and rapid torrent of cheap\r\nfiction. This perennial fountain has long ceased to flow, yet has its\r\ndisappearance left no unsatisfied void. The procreation of human kind\r\nhas failed to support the elaborate theory of Malthus, but had the sage\r\nphilosopher transferred his calculations from the sons of men to works\r\nof fiction, then indeed he might stand forth the prophet of a striking\r\ntruth. The extensive plain over which this flood is spread seems even to\r\nbe extending its limits, and a spongy soil of unlimited capacity is\r\nready ever to absorb the fresh advance of waves. It is indeed striking\r\nto observe how authors and men of talent have increased, so vastly out\r\nof all proportion with other classes of men. Observing it, the political\r\neconomist may well shout 'Io triumphe!' for that even in so delicate and\r\nintangible a matter as intellectual gifts, the famous doctrine of supply\r\nand demand is so thoroughly carried out. We raise, however, no hue and\r\ncry after 'poor trash.' Neither have we the blood-thirsty wish to run to\r\nground the panting scribbler, or to adorn ourselves with the glories of\r\nhis 'brush.' Let those who countenance him by reading his works, and who\r\ncan reconcile the purchase thereof with their consciences, answer to\r\ntheir fellow men for the inevitable consequences. But it must be\r\nconfessed that there is in this department a sad want. All readers of\r\nmoderate discrimination must have felt it painfully. In the literature\r\nof fiction we need organization. How do we know a good tea from a bad?\r\nIs it by the universal consent of the good people of China--by a\r\ndemocratic 'censeatur' of the celestial nation? Not at all. Every\r\nvariety is tasted by men who rinse their mouths after each swallow, and\r\nthe comparative merits are gauged and graduated by adepts, who make it\r\nthe sole business and profession of their lives. A similar process we\r\nneed in fiction. The old system of criticism in reviews and magazines\r\nworked well in its day, but it won't do now. The era of the\r\nold-fashioned novel critic has gone by. He knows it, and his voice is\r\nseldom heard. Even a numerous body, working promiscuously and without\r\nconjunction, could not accomplish much. The only manner in which the\r\nrequisite result could be brought about would be by a regularly\r\norganized set of men, working under direction and regulated by\r\nauthority, like the body of tax assessors or national judiciaries. Such\r\na corps should be trained to their work as to a profession like that of\r\nlaw or medicine, having brotherhoods in every publishing town or city,\r\nworking together and subordinately, like the order of the Jesuits. They\r\nshould test every work before it was given to the public, and brand it\r\nwith precisely its mark of real merit. And thus might be accomplished a\r\nmost inestimable public service. In France such a system might be\r\npracticable, and not hostile to the spirit and institutions of a nation\r\naccustomed to have everything, even to the play programmes of the\r\ntheatre, regulated by the powers that be. But in America, home of\r\ndemocracy and fatherland of individual independence, such a scheme, so\r\ninvaluable though so impossible, must, we fear, ever remain a\r\ntantalizing vision. As it is, of course many a man of real ability is\r\ndrowned in the rushing waves of multitudinous authors, and his works\r\npass undistinguished to that unknown grave which gapes so mysteriously\r\nin some hidden recess of the universe, and silently swallows yearly the\r\nvast masses of printed paper which has done its brief work and been\r\nthrown by read or unread, forgotten. It is to assist in the rescue of a\r\nstruggling author from this yawning abyss that the present article is\r\nsent forth, a plank in the shipwreck.\r\n\r\nWho may be the object of our present criticism, we must confess we know\r\nnot. Whether it be a brother man, or whether our words of praise may win\r\nus the kind regards of a 'gentle ladye,' we can only conjecture. Our\r\nprocess must be _in rem_, not _in personam_. 'It'--for thus perforce we\r\nmust speak of our Unknown--weareth an iron mask of inscrutable mystery,\r\nas complete as that of the all-baffling Junius. The field, however, of\r\nspeculation is open to our wandering reflection. Herein we guide\r\nourselves by natural signs, the configurations of the stars and the\r\nmarks of the soil. We judge from the mould in which the favorite male\r\ncharacters are cast, and from the traits invariably bestowed upon the\r\nheroines, also by the general choice of scenery, by the groupings, the\r\n'properties.' Upon such authority of intrinsic evidence we have no\r\nhesitation in pronouncing the writer to be a man. Certain novel-writing\r\nladies indeed are given to depicting most royal heroes, types of the\r\nideal man, glorified beings endowed with every charm of physique and of\r\nspirit. Such find an irresistible fascination in allowing their fancy to\r\nrun wild riot and poetic revel in contemplation of a wonderful male\r\ncreature, so graceful, so beautiful, so strong, so brave, so masterly,\r\nso bad or so good as the case may be--a spirit of chivalry incarnate in\r\nthe perfection of the flesh. They cannot build a shrine too lofty, nor\r\nburn too generous store of incense before this exalted one. The man, as\r\nhe reads, smiles. Such a brother has never been born to him of\r\nwoman--never since the days of Adam in paradise, neither ever shall be.\r\nThe fair votaress standeth without the vail of the temple, nor have its\r\nmystic recesses ever disclosed to her scrutinizing vision actual 'Man.'\r\nLet us not however harshly dispel such illusions, neither drench with\r\nthe cold flood of unnecessary ingenuousness the glowing embers of myrrh\r\nand frankincense. Occasionally, perchance, some sinful human, conscious\r\nwithin himself of no demerits beyond his fellows, may repine at passing\r\ncomparison with this shadowy conception. But as a general rule, it is\r\nwise enough to tolerate such pleasant vagaries of worshipping woman. Of\r\nthis fair description are the proud statues which look out upon us in\r\nApollo-like majesty from the galleries in 'Guy Livingstone,' 'Sword and\r\nGown,' 'Barren Honors.' Guy, Royston Keene, and Alan Wyverne, are such\r\nfanciful delineations, such marvels of bodily glory and chivalrous\r\nspirit. They might be drawn by a woman. The accompaniments are in\r\nadmirable keeping; and the whole scenery is gotten up to match, and most\r\nunexceptionally. Our characters are dissipated upon a scale suited to\r\nthe heroic age and the primeval constitution of the race. They gamble\r\nquite _en prince_, and carouse most royally. They have a capacity for\r\nterrible potations, should mischance or crossed affections so incline\r\nthem; yet they can seldom plead the latter excuse, for we are given to\r\nunderstand that woman-kind are born to be their helpless slaves and\r\nvictims. They are perpetually doing deeds of terrible '_derring-do_;'\r\nupon the backs of unmanageable steeds they leap limitless chasms and the\r\ntallest of walls; they gallop to death in battle and dispel _ennui_ in\r\nmidnight conflicts with desperate poachers. Such scenes are quite within\r\nthe scope of some feminine imaginations, but scarcely such a power of\r\ndescription as that wherewith we have them here set forth. Women thrill\r\nsometimes at fierce tales of stalwart knock-down struggles, many of them\r\nwill back fearlessly the most mettlesome of thoroughbreds; but when it\r\ncomes to talk thereof, they strive in vain for adequate power of\r\nlanguage. The best words and the strongest sentences will not come.\r\nThese demand the clarion roundness and ring essentially masculine--very\r\n_virile_ indeed. The muscular gripe of a man--not the white, tapering\r\nfingers of any maiden--held the pen which wrote so gloriously of\r\nLivingstone's terrible riding, of Royston Keene's bloody sabre charges.\r\nWe know it by unerring instinct, as we could tell a morsel of the smooth\r\ncheek of the damsel from the grizzled jowl of man.\r\n\r\nBut as usual, the crowning glory of most anxious labor is to be sought\r\nin the female characters. These are nearly all of the majestic, haughty,\r\nand queen-like caste--tall, imperious beauties, empresses of society, to\r\nwhom men are slaves, and life a triumphal march of unbroken conquests.\r\nSo it is at least until they meet some one terrible subduer of woman--a\r\nGuy or a Keene--in whom they recognize masterhood, and the right and\r\npower to reign. With the last stateliness of royalty these magnificent\r\npresences glide through the proud pomp and pageantry of their\r\nsurroundings, graceful as swans, faultless in classic form, and face as\r\nwhite as Grecian marbles, domineering as sisters of Cæsars, violet eyed,\r\nstatuesque, cold upon the chiselled surface, but aglow with the white\r\nheat of feeling and forceful passion beneath. How blue are their clear\r\nveins interlacing beneath a crystalline skin!--for their blood is a more\r\nsublimed fluid than that which waters the clay of ordinary humanity.\r\nThey have with them an unutterable glory of conscious power, the\r\nmagnificence of a perfect, God-given nature, such a haughty spirit of\r\nrivalless dominion as might have swelled the soul of a Jewish queen,\r\nmonarch of Israel, ruler of God's chosen people in the day of their\r\nunbroken pride, when she felt that none greater than herself dwelt upon\r\nthe globe. But with inevitable tread approaches the universal moral\r\nwhich points the tale. The measured step of the godlike hero echoeth\r\nalong the corridors. The royal maiden, hearing the ominous tramp, is\r\ncognizant of an unwonted thrill and a sensation unfelt before. Her\r\nprophetic instinct telleth her too truly that her wild independence is\r\nconcluded, that the day of bondage and of fetters has dawned, that the\r\ninexorable One, who alone in all the millions of created men is able, is\r\neven now present with, the gyves of her slavery in his hand. But the\r\ndenouement is never at the bridal altar. Our host entertaineth us with\r\nno loves of Strephon and Phillis, nor leads beneath shady arcades to a\r\nvine-clad cottage, wherein is love and rich cream and homemade butter.\r\nThe three sisters, the dread Moiræ, in their darksome cavern, spinning\r\nthe golden thread of destiny, reel from their distaff no bright soft\r\nfilm of wedded happiness. The polished metal, many times refined, would\r\nnever show half its qualities were it not subject to unwonted tests. We\r\nsuffer according to our powers of endurance, and are tried according to\r\nour gifts. Else why are the powers and the gifts given to us by a\r\nProvidence which never wasteth, nor doeth in freakish negligence. The\r\nyoke of love is not weighty enough to bow sufficiently the curving neck.\r\nWith a love which cannot be satisfied comes the mighty temptation to sin\r\nand disgrace. Even into this black chasm our beauties look with steady\r\neye, and meditate the step. It is a part of their self-sustaining nature\r\nand towering spirit to wreak their own will. Once let them give their\r\nlove to man, and it is the passion of their lives. Of gossip and the\r\nwagging tongue of scandal, and of that vague, shadowy phantom,\r\nreputation, they reck not. These unsubstantial fleeting barriers are\r\ndissipated in an instant before the mighty breath of their omnipotent\r\npassion. Their love is the great fact of their lives. Why should it\r\nyield to less powerful sentiments, to inferior satisfactions. If the\r\nlaws and sentiments of the commonalty of mankind oppose, why gain the\r\nlesser, palling pleasure of a fair character among our fellows whom we\r\ncare not for, and lose the one joy of existence? Such, in all three of\r\nthese novels, to a greater or less extent, is the theory of action of\r\nthe female characters.\r\n\r\nThey are however rescued from the last degree of actual crime in each\r\ncase by the good taste of the author, feeling that such chapters had\r\nbetter not be written voluntarily in fiction, or perchance by his love\r\nfor his proud maidens, whom he cannot taint with degradation in act,\r\neven if the sin upon their souls be wellnigh as black in the eyes of a\r\nstrict judge, arbiter alike of the seen and the unseen. Such are hardly\r\nthe conceptions wherewith the brain of a cultivated woman would teem. It\r\nwere too glaring treason to her sex and to her own nature. Although it\r\nmust be said that there is no word of coarseness or bold suggestion of\r\nwickedness to be found upon any page. So far from it, we scarcely find\r\nrecognized the crime to which the maidens are tempted, and we\r\nhalf-ignorantly wonder at the existence of compunctions, excited at we\r\ncan scarcely say what. But the author knew probably well enough, and if\r\nshe were one of the sisterhood of women, then must she be isolated and\r\nat enmity with them all. Her hand is against every woman's and every\r\nwoman's hand against her.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a fault in the tone of these novels. This may have been\r\ninferred by some strict moralists from the preceding paragraph. But they\r\nhave indeed not the slightest trace of impropriety about them. They are\r\nnot tainted in the slightest with the insidious viciousness of French\r\nnovels. Their fault arises from rather an opposite tendency of mind and\r\na different train of feelings. They are of the world, worldly. They are\r\ncold and sarcastic; they inculcate self-sufficiency, and preach to man\r\nto be a tower of strength in himself, not always in the praiseworthy\r\nChristian way. There is no single word of scoffing or disrespect for\r\nreligion, no slur upon it whatsoever. Only we are aware, as by an\r\ninstinct, that in the circle of our characters it is wholly ignored. In\r\ntheir world it is not an agent, whether for themselves or others. It is\r\nas unrecognized a system as is Mohammedanism or Buddhism with ourselves.\r\nThe heroes have all 'seen the world' in the most thorough and terrible\r\nsense of those words. For them virtue and vice are much alike. Their\r\nwills are iron. They fix their eye upon their goal, and straight thereto\r\nthey firmly march over the obstacles of precipices, through the\r\nblackness of quagmires, crashing athwart laws, customs, and\r\nconventionalities, as elephants calmly striding through underbrush. They\r\ndisregard the prejudices of the world equally for evil and for good. And\r\na moral independence which might furnish forth the most glorious of\r\nmartyrs in invincible panoply is quite as likely to assist a hardy\r\nsinner. The sneer and sarcasm and contempt are for the conventionalities\r\nof the world, for the belief of the mass of mankind in right and wrong,\r\nand for the customs and habits which the republic of humanity has\r\nestablished for better assistance in the paths of virtue--as if,\r\nforsooth, such were vulgar because common, and to be despised by the\r\nmighty because useful to the feeble. This is not the proper spirit for\r\nthe satirist. If he wields his pen in support of such a theory he will\r\ndo more harm than good. A conventionality is not necessarily bad or\r\ncontemptible merely as such. Not a promiscuous and indiscriminate\r\nslashing, but a careful pruning is the proper method in the garden of\r\nsociety. The indiscreet hand will cut what it should leave, and leave\r\nperhaps what might have been better sacrificed. The artificial trellises\r\nwhereon we train our feeble virtues, which may hardly stand by their own\r\nstrength, must not be shattered in a general slaughter of weeds which\r\nhave taken root and nourishment in the rank soil of fashionable\r\netiquette. Let us not dash the image from the altar, nor quench the fire\r\nat the shrine, before we have another idol and another shrine to give to\r\nthe old worshippers, who must worship still. Such reckless iconoclasm is\r\ntoo dangerous. It is in this point of discretion that our author is most\r\nreprehensible. The moral tone of his works might have been improved had\r\nhis independent tendencies been rather more judiciously indulged. There\r\nis, however, one character of loveliness and purity almost sufficient to\r\nleaven the whole mass and to dash our entire reprehension. In all the\r\nscope of our novel reading, nowhere do we remember to have met a more\r\nexquisitely charming character than that of fair Constance Brandon.\r\nEvery charm of spirit and of person is lavished upon her. At the same\r\ntime she is conceived with faultless taste. No feeble extravagance\r\noffends our feelings; no tinsel or affectation thwarts our admiration.\r\nThe execution is worthy of the thought, which is simply beautiful. The\r\nportrait is like Raphael's divinest Madonna, with the changing radiance\r\nand velvety warmth of life thrown into the matchless face. Why could we\r\nnot have had more such, instead of such indifferent domesticities as La\r\nMignonne?\r\n\r\nWhen we say that none of these three novels are destined to pass into\r\nthe eternal literature of the language, we pass no very harsh or damning\r\njudgment. Men of the highest powers must bow to the same decree. Our\r\nauthor, though his thews and sinews are stalwart, is yet hardly cast in\r\nthe mould to indicate such excessive vitality. He can hardly trouble the\r\nstride of those lordly veterans of the turf, Scott or Thackeray; yet\r\nwithout exertion spurning the rearward turf, he clicks his galloping\r\nhoofs in the faces of the throng of the ordinary purveyors of fiction.\r\nHis fancy is exuberant; his imagination brilliant, florid, verging at\r\ntimes almost upon the apoplectic. But the cognate mental member,\r\ninvention, is most sadly destitute of free and sweeping action. His\r\nplots are of the simplest, and betray indubitably a numbness or\r\nimperfect development of the inventive faculties of the brain. People\r\nwho read novels for the denouement, who ride a steeple chase through\r\nthem, leaping a five-page fence here, a ditch of a chapter there, and\r\nanon clearing at a mighty bound a rasper of some score or more\r\nparagraphs, resolute simply to be in at the death in the last chapter,\r\nanxious to see the wedding torches extinguished, and the printer setting\r\nup 'Finis'--such would find little satisfaction in 'Barren Honor,'\r\nalmost none in 'Sword and Gown.' Reading these works is like passing\r\nthrough a wondrously beautiful country. But it is not the indolent\r\nbeauty of southern climes, to lounge through sleepily in a slow-rolling\r\ntravelling carriage. You must ride through it on the proud back of a\r\nblooded steed. Canter, run, if you like, when the ground is fit and the\r\nspirit moves, as often enough it may; but do not fix your eyes upon any\r\ndistant gaol, and time your arrival thereat. Enjoy what is close at\r\nhand. Admire now the blue glories of the proud hills, recumbent in\r\ncareless grace of majesty in the indolent sunlit atmosphere; gaze then\r\ninto the sombre depths of solemn retreating forest; tremble anon in the\r\nblack shadow of the fierce rock beetling over your bridle way; and fill\r\nyour rejoicing being with the fresh-distilled vigor of the springy step\r\nof your charger on the turf. It will put bounding manliness into your\r\nsluggish civilian blood. Read each page, each chapter for itself; or\r\nregard it as one handsome marble square in the tesselated pavement of a\r\nhaughty palace, not as a useful brick in the domestic sidewalk, which is\r\nto carry you straight to a homely destination. Observe the description\r\nof scenes, how powerful! the delineation of character, how fascinating!\r\nand be pleased with the luxuriance of the style and the gorgeous drapery\r\nof language wherewith so royally the thoughts are robed.\r\n\r\nOur author is not true to nature--he is extravagant, high-wrought.\r\nNobody ever met his heroes or his heroines in real life, nor lived the\r\nscenes told of in his poetry. His men and women are the men and women of\r\nan enthusiastic fancy; his scenes and incidents are the scenes and\r\nincidents of our romantic dreams. We know none so lovely as ethereal\r\nConstance Brandon; we never gazed into the violet-flashing eyes of a\r\nCecil Tresilyan; none of our friends are quite prototypes of the\r\nomnipotent 'Cool Captain;' they betray neither the athletic chivalry of\r\nLivingstone nor the winning beauty and high-souled nobility of generous\r\nAlan Wyverne. We never saw such models, for such never quitted their\r\nideal essences to become incarnate in the flesh. But why need this be an\r\ninsuperable objection? We don't find Achilles any the less interesting\r\nbecause we doubt the ability of any degenerate modern to calmly destroy\r\nsuch outnumbering hosts of his fellow beings, and send such a throng of\r\nwarrior souls to hades without scath or scar to his invulnerable self.\r\nIvanhoe got out of some very awkward scrapes by the exertion of a\r\nprowess quite exceptional in such a 'light-weight.' The extravagance is\r\nnot glaring enough to discompose us. Surely a tolerable proximate\r\napproach to possible existence ought to satisfy a not viciously captious\r\ncritic. We are reading of shadowy beings: why should not the facile\r\nmists be permeated with a somewhat subtler light, and melt into somewhat\r\nairier forms of perfection than we have been accustomed to catch\r\nimprisoned in the substantial dulness of the flesh? If we will only\r\nchoose, we may revel in the company of somewhat glorified mortals. It\r\nmay be a luxury to us, if we will not be jealously illiberal and\r\nenvious. It is pleasant to emerge from our little chintz-furnished\r\nparlor, and lounge in castles of dimly magnificent extent, where we are\r\nsure to meet the choicest society; where some order their mighty hunters\r\nfrom the capacious stables, and others go out to drop a stag, or run a\r\nfox, or bag a few pheasants in the preserves, just to get an appetite\r\nfor dinner, from which stupendous meal, tended by hosts of velvet-footed\r\nmenials and florid old-family butlers, resplendent ladies rise to retire\r\nto gorgeous drawing rooms of any draperied dimensions we may choose to\r\nfancy, leaving perhaps a score of gentlemen guests to quaff cobwebbed\r\nwines in unstinted goblets. Why isn't it pleasant to linger sometimes in\r\nthese royal abodes, and to saunter in the endless lawns and forest\r\nglades of the rich and the great, where we may encounter ladies rather\r\nhandsomer and gentlemen rather haughtier than they are generally made in\r\nour own circle? Let us not be captious, but agreeably appreciative.\r\n\r\nIn a short sentence in one of the opening chapters of 'Sword and Gown,'\r\nour author proclaims probably the intention, certainly the result of his\r\nliterary labors--to produce a string of beautiful cameos, with just\r\nthread enough of story to string them upon. This task is done, and well\r\ndone. The classical allusions are numerous, and seldom can we blame one\r\nas out of place. Generally they are wrought into beautiful little\r\npictures, complete in themselves. He manages them with wonderful\r\ndexterity, never making too much of them, nor dwelling upon them too\r\nlong; but with his masterly skill in language he handles his words as a\r\npainter his colors, and now we have a bold royal sketch, cloudy outlines\r\nof gigantic proportions, shadowy scenes of indefinite grandeur, done\r\nwith a few strong, words and magnificent adjectives; and now a little\r\nparagraph, charming in its exquisite daintiness, like a miniature rarely\r\ndone upon the face of a costly gem. It is in this word-painting that he\r\nis surpassingly admirable. Delineation, description, portraiture are his\r\nforte. The same quality of mind which gives dreams of princely men and\r\ndivine women seems to have brought also a generous endowment of warm,\r\nrich words, wherewith to do justice to the imaginings. All the beauty,\r\ndignity, and glory of English logography seem to be his: he marshals an\r\narray of adjectives and phrases which seem all of the blood royal of our\r\nmunificent mother tongue. Oftentimes his page sounds like the\r\ndeep-rolling anthem of a mighty cathedral organ. Might and music are in\r\nhis syllables; and without sifting his sentences for a noble thought or\r\na beautiful idea, we may be pleased by the stately tread of their\r\nsuccession, and their rich harmonious cadences.\r\n\r\nThe scenes are apt to be rather melodramatic. Wonderful passions work\r\nwonderfully. Eyes flash, lips are set, cheeks grow pale, quite often.\r\nGreat coolness, vast powers, are continually displayed; yet they are\r\nwell displayed, after the fashion of gentlemen, not of bravoes or\r\nvillains or highwaymen. He handles thunder and lightning, the terrific\r\nweapons of the mighty Jove himself, in a very haughty, Jove-like\r\nmanner, it must be confessed. He isn't afraid of singing his fingers\r\nwith the thunderbolts, but seizes them with the familiar gripe of\r\nunquestionable authority. In a glorified language he paints glorified\r\nvisions. Very little of the calm domestic sunlight of the working\r\nnoonday glimmers among his pages, but a perpetual, everlasting\r\ngorgeousness of deep-colored sunset radiance. For merit of style all\r\nthese novels are well worthy of commendation and of study. Education and\r\nextensive reading have preserved them from faults of gaudiness and\r\nmeretricious ornament. They are chastened by good taste and regulated by\r\ngentlemanly cultivation. They are written by a scholar, and not by a\r\nscribbler; and while reading their magnificent pages we need have no\r\nmisgiving that we are admiring the flashy ornaments of wordy or\r\nhalf-educated mediocrity. Far the best of them is also the first, 'Guy\r\nLivingstone.' The poorest is 'Sword and Gown;' this has the feeblest\r\nplot, in fact a mere apology for a story, and contains more passages\r\nwhich seem unfinished, and what on a second reading would scarce have\r\nsatisfied their own writer. 'Guy Livingstone,' though not faultless, is\r\na work of power, talent, and brilliancy. Guy himself is an Olympian\r\ncharacter, sketched upon the scale and model of a Torso, a giant in his\r\nvirtues and his vices and his frame--but exaggerated with such tact and\r\nability that even the impossible hugeness charms and fascinates. The\r\nfeats of the hero in the dance and carpeted salon, on his mighty hunter\r\nleading the breakneck chase, carry us away with all the heat and ardor\r\nof sympathy; nor do we stumble in our companionable excitement over any\r\nunwelcome snag of commonplace thought or vulgar daring. Constance\r\nBrandon, as we have above intimated, we consider a splendid\r\nmasterpiece--a woman lovely as the imagination of man fondly likes to\r\ndream, with every winning grace of manner and amiable charm of purity.\r\nShe is the finest character and the fairest face beyond all compare in\r\nthe gallery; and the scenes in which she figures are the most able, the\r\nmost moving, and the most unexceptionable in every point of view, of all\r\nthat our author has given us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILL ON LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny work from the pen of John Stuart Mill will arrest the attention of\r\nreaders and thinkers wherever the English language is spoken, and,\r\nindeed, wherever the spirit of inquiry and improvement has aroused the\r\nintellect of man. This author has proved himself a veritable instructor\r\nand benefactor of his race. His writings have been always grave and\r\nvaluable, addressed to the understanding of men, indicating arduous\r\nstudy on his own part, and eliciting reflection of the profoundest\r\ncharacter in the mind of his reader. In his well known work 'On Logic,'\r\npublished twenty years ago, he exhibited the highest capacity for\r\nabstract speculation, and placed himself by the side of Aristotle and\r\nBacon in the rank of philosophers; while that 'On the Principles of\r\nPolitical Economy,' more practical in its aims, entitles him to the\r\nreputation of an able and enlightened statesman.\r\n\r\nLast year we had published in this country, a treatise from the same\r\nfertile pen on the subject of 'Representative Government,' which,\r\nhowever, was subsequent in the order of composition to that which has\r\njust now appeared in the United States from the press of Ticknor &\r\nFields, of Boston. Both these productions, that on 'Representative\r\nGovernment,' and that 'On Liberty,' are valuable to the American people,\r\nteaching lessons important to be learned even by them. From the nature\r\nof our institutions, and especially from the vainglorious sentiments too\r\ngenerally entertained by us, we are apt to consider ourselves so well\r\nversed in the principles of civil liberty and of representative\r\ngovernment, as to be incapable of learning anything on these subjects,\r\nespecially from English writers. Unfortunately, recent events are\r\ncalculated rudely to disturb our self-satisfaction, and to arouse within\r\nus a serious distrust, not indeed of the principles embodied in our\r\ninstitutions, but of our practical ability to carry them out to their\r\nlegitimate results, and thus to enjoy, fully and permanently, the\r\nadvantages of the system of free government of which we have always been\r\nso boastful.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps natural that the mass of the American people should\r\nconceive the whole of liberty as comprised in the privilege of voting,\r\nand its substantial benefits as being fully secured by the popular form\r\nof government. This, however, would be an inconsiderate conclusion,\r\ninvolving a most pernicious error; and so far is it from constituting\r\nany important part of the discussion, that in the whole of Mr. Mill's\r\nwork, there is scarcely more than a glance at this aspect of the\r\nquestion. The liberty which the author investigates and commends by the\r\nmost unanswerable arguments, is not that which is embodied in political\r\ninstitutions, so much as that which results from the liberal and\r\nenlightened spirit pervading and controlling the social organization. It\r\nis not the power to choose representatives and to make laws, but it is\r\nrather the privilege, in all proper cases, of being a law to one's self,\r\nand of representing in one's own individuality the peculiar ideas and\r\ncapacities which each one is best fitted to unfold and develop for his\r\nown good without injury to society. Political tyranny, at this day, is\r\nby no means the chief danger to which men are anywhere exposed; and that\r\nsubject has been so thoroughly understood in modern times, that books\r\nare hardly required now to be written upon it. It is social\r\ndespotism--the tyranny of custom and opinion--which chiefly enlists the\r\nintellect of our philosophical and interesting author, though he does\r\nnot fail to lay down the true limits of the legislative authority as\r\nwell. He is thoroughly versed in the history of 'the struggle between\r\nliberty and authority,' which he says 'is the most conspicuous feature\r\nin the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar,\r\nparticularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this\r\ncontest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the\r\ngovernment. By liberty was meant protection against the tyranny of\r\npolitical rulers.' This struggle has been carried on for ages, until it\r\nhas now come to be an axiom, universally received in civilized nations,\r\nthat government is instituted solely for the good of the governed. And\r\nin the progress of amelioration and improvement, it has been supposed\r\nthat the popular principle of universal suffrage, with frequent\r\nelections, and consequent responsibility of political agents, would\r\neffectually prevent the exercise of tyranny in governments; and this\r\nespecially when governments are instituted under written constitutions,\r\nwith powers limited and clearly defined therein. The people, through\r\ntheir chosen representatives, wielding the whole power of the national\r\norganization, could not be expected to tyrannize over themselves.\r\nExperience, however, soon proved that the tyranny of the majority in\r\npopular governments is to be guarded against quite as carefully as that\r\nof despotic rulers in any other form of polity. For, says Mr. Mill,\r\n'when society is itself the tyrant--society collectively over the\r\nindividuals which compose it--its means of tyrannizing are not\r\nrestricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political\r\nfunctionaries.' The obvious truth of this statement needs no elaborate\r\nattempt at illustration. In all the departments of thought and action,\r\nof opinion and habit, the power of society over its separate members is\r\ntremendous and unlimited, sometimes penetrating 'deeply into the details\r\nof life, and enslaving the soul itself.' It would not be difficult for\r\nany man of intelligence and observation to recall instances, within his\r\nown knowledge, in which this arbitrary power of the community has been\r\nmost unjustly exerted to oppress and injure individuals. The injury and\r\noppression have been none the less, because their operation has been\r\nsilent, attended with no physical force or legal restraint, but reaching\r\nonly the mind and heart of the sufferer, crushing them with the moral\r\nweight of unjust opprobrium, and torturing them with all the ingenious\r\nappliances of social tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for this sort of despotism--the most dangerous of all, if not\r\nthe only danger to be feared in civilized communities and in liberal\r\ngovernments--is not to be found in laws or constitutions, but in the\r\nenlightened liberality and trained habits and sentiments of society\r\nitself. 'Some,' says Mr. Mill, 'whenever they see any good to be done or\r\nany evil to be remedied, would willingly instigate the government to\r\nundertake the business; while others prefer to bear almost any amount of\r\nsocial evil, rather than to add one to the departments of human\r\ninterests amenable to governmental control.' And, upon the whole, he\r\nthinks, 'the interference of government is, with about equal frequency,\r\nimproperly invoked and improperly condemned.' The only device which Mr.\r\nMill proposes, as the effectual means of counteracting this sort of\r\ntyranny, either political or social, is the establishment of a rule or\r\nprinciple, by which the limits of authority over individuals shall, in\r\nboth cases, be strictly and philosophically defined. He does not\r\nundertake to say how this rule is to be enforced--by what sanctions, or\r\nby what authority it can be made effectual for the protection of\r\nindividual rights. But as the evil to be remedied is one arising chiefly\r\nfrom the errors of public opinion, the corrective would naturally seem\r\nto be the inculcation of sound principles and just sentiments, infusing\r\nthem into the social organization, and gradually enthroning them in the\r\npublic conscience. The bare announcement of truth, in a matter of such\r\ntranscendent importance, is an immense progress toward the goal of\r\nimprovement. Principles, well founded and of real value, once\r\nunderstood, will eventually make their way. With all the errors of\r\nsociety, and the wrong-headed stubbornness and selfishness of humanity,\r\nwith the immense obstructive power of established interests, the haughty\r\ndespotism of old opinions, and the petrified rigidity of social customs,\r\nthe solvent energy of truth nevertheless will penetrate every part of\r\nthe imposing fabric, and gradually undermine its foundations. Underlying\r\nthe whole, there is a broad foundation for improvement; and there is a\r\nnatural tendency in society to seize upon and appropriate good, whenever\r\nfairly exhibited to its view and placed within its reach.\r\n\r\nAs embodying the general purpose of the author, and the principle which\r\nhe seeks to establish, we give the following passage, in his own words:\r\n\r\n     'The object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle,\r\n     as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the\r\n     individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means\r\n     used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral\r\n     coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end\r\n     for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in\r\n     interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is\r\n     self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be\r\n     rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community,\r\n     against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good,\r\n     either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot\r\n     rightfully be compelled to do or forbear, because it will be better\r\n     for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the\r\n     opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These\r\n     are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him,\r\n     or persuading him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with\r\n     any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from\r\n     which it is desired to deter him, must be calculated to produce\r\n     evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for\r\n     which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In\r\n     the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of\r\n     right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the\r\n     individual is sovereign.'\r\n\r\nThis statement has the great merit of being, at least, perfectly clear\r\nand definite. In some particular cases, the principle may be difficult\r\nof application; but in the principle itself, as defined in this passage,\r\nthere is not the slightest uncertainty or indistinctness. The author is\r\nvery careful, however, to except from its operation all persons who are\r\nnot in the maturity of their faculties, as well as all those backward\r\nnations who are not capable of being improved by free and equal\r\ndiscussion. The condition of society in which alone this liberal maxim\r\nwill be safe and appropriate, must be that of a people so far elevated\r\nand enlightened, that persuasion and conviction are the most powerful\r\nmeans of improvement. Wherever is to be found an advanced civilization,\r\nwith all the complex moral and social relations which grow out of it,\r\nthere the necessity for physical force will be found to have declined.\r\nPublic opinion will have acquired great authority, if not absolute\r\ncontrol; and the rights of individuals will require, for their\r\nprotection against the overpowering weight of the social combination,\r\nall those safeguards against possible tyranny, which can only be\r\nafforded by the general acceptance of the liberal principle just quoted.\r\nThe social authority must be educated and restrained by its own willing\r\nrecognition of individual rights. As the power most likely to be abused\r\nfor purposes of oppression is that of opinion and custom, too often\r\noperating silently and insidiously, the corrective is only to be applied\r\nby the establishment of a counteracting spiritual authority, in the\r\nbosom of society itself, at all times ready to utter its mandate and to\r\nproclaim the inviolable sanctity of individual liberty, within the\r\nlimits fixed by enlightened reason and conscience. In the earlier stages\r\nof civilization, or in societies of more simple and primitive character,\r\nindividual development has not reached the point which either requires\r\nsuch principles or admits of their application. The merely physical life\r\nof such people can hardly give rise to these questions: political power\r\nand actual force necessarily occupy the place of those subtle and\r\nall-pervading moral and social influences which prevail in the\r\nsubsequent stages of progress. As men become more enlightened, they\r\nbecome also more capable of self-control, and are consequently entitled\r\nto greater liberty of action. Sooner or later, the necessity for\r\nconceding it to the utmost limit of the principle stated, will be fully\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\nBut it is notable that the author does not attempt to maintain his dogma\r\non the ground of right or morality, but solely on that of a wise and\r\nbroad utility. He foregoes all the advantage he might obtain in the\r\nargument by resorting to the moral considerations which sustain it. It\r\nis better for the real interests of society that individual members\r\nshould enjoy the largest measure of liberty; and if this be not\r\nequivalent to the assertion that it is also their right, upon the\r\nplainest moral grounds, it is at least certain that the two principles\r\nare coincident in this case, as they will be found to be in all others,\r\nwhere the real interests of mankind are concerned. So true is it, that\r\nwhat ever, in a large sense, is best for the permanent advantage of any\r\nsociety is, at the same time, always right and consistent with sound\r\nmoral principles.\r\n\r\nIn a matter of such vital importance as that of human liberty, which, in\r\nthe language of another eminent writer, 'is the one thing most essential\r\nto the right development of individuals, and to the real grandeur of\r\nnations,' it was necessary that its foundations should be made so broad,\r\nin any correct philosophical analysis of its nature, as to comprehend\r\nthe whole field of human activity. Accordingly, Mr. Mill includes within\r\nits proper domain the three great departments: consciousness, or the\r\ninternal operations of our own minds; will, or the external\r\nmanifestation of our thoughts and feelings in acts and habits; and\r\nlastly, association, or coöperation with others, voluntarily agreed\r\nupon, and not interfering with the rights and liberties of those who may\r\nchoose to stand aloof from such combinations. In reference to the first\r\nof these, which asserts the undoubted right to enjoy our own thoughts\r\nand feelings, with absolute freedom of opinion on all subjects, Mr. Mill\r\nremarks that 'the liberty of expressing and publishing opinions may seem\r\nto fall under a different principle, since it belongs to that part of\r\nthe conduct of an individual which concerns other people; but being\r\nalmost of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself, and\r\nresting in great part on the same reasons, is practically inseparable\r\nfrom it.' But, in truth, the right of expression, which does not\r\nproperly come under the head of consciousness or thought, but under that\r\nof will or action, is the only one of the two which at this day is of\r\nany practical importance. The idea of controlling thought or belief has,\r\nin effect, been everywhere abandoned. Indeed, it may be questioned\r\nwhether any such control ever has been or could have been exercised; for\r\nthought itself could never be known except through some outward\r\nmanifestation. It was therefore the _expression_ which was punished, and\r\nnot the inward consciousness. Opinions, it is true, have too often been\r\nthe avowed ground of oppression and persecution. Men have been injured\r\nin various ways, on account of their known or suspected belief; even in\r\nmodern times and in communities claiming to be free, political\r\ndisabilities, social reprobation, and the stigma of disqualification as\r\nwitnesses have been imposed upon persons entertaining certain views on\r\ntheological questions. But these persecutions may have compelled the\r\nsuppression or disavowal of obnoxious opinions, and may have made\r\nhypocrites; they never changed belief, or produced any other conviction\r\nthan that of wrong and outrage. The soul itself is beyond the reach of\r\nany human authority, not to be conquered by any device of terror or\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nDifference of opinion is unfortunately the ground of natural aversion\r\namong men; and it requires much enlightenment and liberal training to\r\nenable society to overcome this universal prejudice and to inaugurate\r\ncomplete and absolute toleration. 'In the present state of knowledge,'\r\nsays Buckle, the historian, 'the majority of people are so ill informed,\r\nas not to be aware of the true nature of belief; they are not aware that\r\nall belief is involuntary and is entirely governed by the circumstances\r\nwhich produce it. What we call the will has no power over belief, and\r\nconsequently a man is nowise responsible for his creed, except in so far\r\nas he is responsible for the events which gave him his creed.' It may be\r\ndoubted whether the majority of people are quite so ignorant as Mr.\r\nBuckle here represents them; for the conflict between beliefs is rather\r\nthe result of feeling or passion than of judgment. Because men who\r\ndiffer in opinion hate each other, it does not follow that they must\r\ntherefore deny the right to freedom of thought, or maintain that belief\r\nmay be changed at will. The red man and the white man may cordially\r\nhate each other; but it would hardly be accurate to say that the former\r\ndenies the right of the latter to his color, or thinks him morally\r\nresponsible for it. Yet men are quite as much responsible for the color\r\nof their skin as for the character of their honest convictions, and they\r\nhave almost equal power to control the one or the other. In truth, the\r\nhatred arising from conflict of opinion is not the offspring of thought,\r\nbut of emotion. It is chiefly a derangement of the affections; not so\r\nmuch an error of the reason. The most unenlightened man has the innate\r\nconviction that he is entitled to his peculiar belief, because it is\r\nimpossible for him to admit any other; nor is it at all natural or\r\nnecessary that one individual should question the sincerity of another's\r\nopinion on any subject, because it differs from his own. Intolerance in\r\nthis particular has been the result mostly of interference and\r\nusurpation--the consequence of that theological despotism to which men\r\nhave, in some form or other, in all ages, been more or less subjected.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, the liberty of thought and belief that Mr. Mill\r\nfinds it necessary to defend, in his exposition of the first division of\r\nthe subject; but it is only that of expression and discussion--the\r\nliberty of the press--the right to make known opinions upon any subject,\r\nand to produce arguments in support of them. In this country, it may be\r\nsupposed to be wholly unnecessary to investigate this subject, inasmuch\r\nas the liberty of the press is here maintained to the most unlimited\r\nextent. So far as the mere legal right is involved, this is undoubtedly\r\ntrue; the established laws interpose no impediment to the expression and\r\npublication of opinions, except those indispensable regulations which\r\nare intended to preserve the public peace and morality, and to protect\r\nprivate character from wanton injury. We have no reason to fear any\r\ninvasion of the liberty of the press--any political interference with\r\nthe right of free discussion--unless in times of great public danger,\r\nor, as Mr. Mill says, 'during some temporary panic, when fear of\r\ninsurrection drives ministers and judges from their propriety.' But\r\nthere is a despotism of society, in this country as well as elsewhere,\r\nwhich, independent of law or authority, often imposes silence on\r\nunpopular opinions, and suppresses all discussion, by means of those ten\r\nthousand appliances and expedients adopted by communities to express\r\ndispleasure and to command obedience. Even, however, if there were not\r\nthe slightest evidence of intolerance in the country, if the rational\r\nprinciples of liberty were universally acknowledged and practised upon,\r\nit would still be most useful and interesting to follow this author in\r\nhis admirable discussion of the subject. It would be a matter of no\r\nlittle importance to understand the rational grounds on which the great\r\nand acknowledged principles of liberty are actually founded, and to see\r\nthe perfect frankness and fearlessness with which this philosophic\r\nauthor follows the doctrine to its extreme but inevitable conclusions.\r\nFor instance, Mr. Mill does not hesitate to say, 'if all mankind minus\r\none, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary\r\nopinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one\r\nperson, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing\r\nmankind.' And this position is maintained not solely or chiefly on the\r\nground of injustice to the person holding the obnoxious opinion, but\r\nbecause the forcible suppression of it would do even greater injustice\r\nto those who conscientiously reject it. For if the opinion be true, its\r\nestablishment and dissemination would benefit mankind; and even if it be\r\nfalse, it is equally important it should be freely made known, inasmuch\r\nas it would contribute to 'the clearer perception and livelier\r\nimpression of truth produced by its collision with error.' Besides, no\r\nman can certainly know that any opinion is true, so long as anything\r\nwhich can be said against it is not permitted to be presented and freely\r\ndiscussed. Liberty is the indispensable atmosphere of truth. Without it,\r\ntruth will as surely languish and die, as animals or plants will perish\r\nwithout air. All great improvements have been accomplished only through\r\nthe conflicts of adverse opinion. Progress is change, and if all\r\ndiscussion is prohibited, change and improvement are impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting also to see the unlimited scope allowed to this bold\r\ndoctrine, and the fearlessness with which it is applied to subjects\r\nusually deemed sacred and forbidden to all question or controversy. The\r\nexistence of a God, the certainty of a future state, the truth of\r\nChristianity--all these are the proper subjects of free discussion and\r\nuntrammelled opinion, quite as much as any other questions, however\r\nunimportant or indifferent. It becomes the devoutest Christian to hear\r\ndiscussions on these transcendent subjects without the least ill will or\r\nintolerance toward the adversary who may thus endeavor to shake his\r\nfaith in those sublime truths which he holds indisputable and more\r\nsacred than all others. It is doing the highest possible service to the\r\ndoctrines to attack them; for if they be sound and true, they will\r\ncertainly survive, and be all the more glorious for having passed safely\r\nthrough the ordeal. Christianity itself was more vital and effective in\r\nits earlier stages, when fighting its way into existence against all\r\nsorts of persecutions, than it has ever been since in the palmiest days\r\nof its power. When its doctrines are no longer questioned, it will cease\r\nto be a living spirit controlling the hearts of men. It will be a cold\r\nand formal thing, resting on the general acquiescence, but no longer\r\nexhibiting its all-conquering power in the active effort to overthrow\r\nopposing creeds.\r\n\r\nNo genuine liberty can exist, until the community shall have reached\r\nthat elevated condition of liberality and wisdom which will gladly\r\nsubmit its most cherished sentiments to the analysis of unsparing logic,\r\nand that without the least effort to punish, in any way, the daring\r\nattempt to undermine its faith. The champions of truth will be\r\nstrengthened by the encounter with error; weak and false arguments,\r\nwhich really injure truth, will give way, and the solid foundations of\r\nimpregnable logic will be substituted in their place. It is impossible\r\nto overestimate the service done to a good cause, by exposing it\r\nfearlessly to the worst attacks of its enemies. 'The fatal tendency of\r\nmankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer\r\ndoubtful, is the cause of half their errors. A contemporary author has\r\nwell spoken of 'the deep slumber of a decided opinion.'' And another\r\nauthor enthusiastically exclaims: 'All hail, therefore, to those who, by\r\nattacking a truth, prevent that truth from slumbering. All hail to those\r\nbold and fearless natures, the heretics and innovators of the day, who,\r\nrousing men out of their lazy sleep, sound in their ears the tocsin and\r\nthe clarion, and force them to come forth that they may do battle for\r\ntheir creed. Of all evils, torpor is the most deadly. Give us paradox,\r\ngive us error, give us what you will, so that you save us from\r\nstagnation. It is the cold spirit of routine which is the nightshade of\r\nour nature. It sits upon men like a blight, blunting their faculties,\r\nwithering their powers, and making them both unable and unwilling to\r\nstruggle for the truth, or to figure to themselves what it is they\r\nreally believe.'\r\n\r\nThe chapter which Mr. Mill devotes to this subject--the liberty of\r\ndiscussion and publication--is thoroughly exhaustive in its character.\r\nIt presents the question in almost every light in which it is desirable\r\nto see it, and successfully meets every objection which can be made to\r\nhis doctrine. For the first time, a logical and philosophical exposition\r\nof the great principles of liberty is presented to the world, and that\r\ntoo in a most readable and attractive form. The work is calculated to do\r\nimmense good. It places liberty on a rational foundation, and dispels\r\nevery doubt which might have been entertained by the timid, as to the\r\nsafety and propriety of permitting free discussion on those points of\r\nbelief which are too often held to be beyond the domain of investigation\r\nand argument. We do not pretend, here, to give anything like a synopsis\r\nof the grounds assumed, and the reasonings adopted by the author. A full\r\nand correct idea of these can only be obtained from the book itself. But\r\nbefore leaving this part of the work, we cannot forbear quoting a\r\npassage on this subject from an essay by Henry Thomas Buckle. Even at\r\nthe risk of prolonging this article beyond its proper limits, we quote\r\nat some length, on account of the vast interest of the topic and the\r\ndifferent notions which too generally prevail as to the propriety of its\r\ndiscussion:\r\n\r\n     'If they who deny the immortality of the soul, could, without the\r\n     least opprobrium, state in the boldest manner all their objections,\r\n     the advocates of the doctrine would be obliged to reconsider their\r\n     own position and to abandon its untenable points. By this means,\r\n     that which I revere, and an overwhelming majority of us revere, as\r\n     a glorious truth, would be immensely strengthened. It would be\r\n     strengthened by being deprived of those sophistical arguments which\r\n     are commonly urged in its favor, and which give to its enemies an\r\n     incalculable advantage. It would moreover be strengthened by that\r\n     feeling of security which men have in their own convictions, when\r\n     they know that everything is said against them which can be said,\r\n     and that their opponents have a fair and liberal hearing. This\r\n     begets a magnanimity and a rational confidence which cannot\r\n     otherwise be obtained. But, such results can never happen while we\r\n     are so timid, or so dishonest, as to impute improper motives to\r\n     those who assail our religious opinions. We may rely upon it that\r\n     as long as we look upon an atheistical writer as a moral offender,\r\n     or even as long as we glance at him with suspicion, atheism will\r\n     remain a standing and permanent danger, because, skulking in hidden\r\n     corners, it will use stratagems which their secrecy will prevent us\r\n     from baffling; it will practise artifices to which the persecuted\r\n     are forced to resort; it will number its concealed proselytes to an\r\n     extent of which only they who have studied this painful subject are\r\n     aware; and, above all, by enabling them to complain of the\r\n     treatment to which they are exposed, it will excite the sympathy of\r\n     many high and generous natures, who, in an open and manly warfare,\r\n     might strive against them, but who, by a noble instinct, find\r\n     themselves incapable of contending with any sect which is\r\n     oppressed, maligned, or intimidated.'\r\n\r\nThe most interesting, and perhaps the most remarkable part of Mr. Mill's\r\nbook, is that which he devotes to individuality as one of the elements\r\nof well being. Having very fully discussed the question of liberty in\r\nthought and expression--the right of controlling one's own mind, and of\r\nmaking known its conclusions--he proceeds to apply the same principle to\r\nthe conduct and whole scheme of human life, maintaining that every man\r\nought to be entirely free to act according to his own taste and judgment\r\nin all matters which concern only himself. The sole condition or\r\nlimitation which society may rightfully impose upon the eccentricities\r\nof individuals, is the equal right of all others to be unmolested and\r\nunobstructed in their occupations and enjoyments. Every man is endowed\r\nwith faculties, capacities, and dispositions peculiar to himself, there\r\nbeing quite as much diversity in the mental character of men as in their\r\nphysical appearance. It is this infinite diversity of thought and\r\nfeeling, as much perhaps as anything else, which distinguishes man from\r\nthe lower animals. It is of the utmost importance to the progress of\r\nsociety, for it is only by departing from the common path, and pursuing\r\nnew and untried modes of existence and action, that improvements are\r\ngradually made. If there were no disposition on the part of individuals\r\nto deviate from the ordinary customs which have descended from\r\ngeneration to generation, it is evident there would never be any\r\nimportant change in the modes of human life nor in the institutions of\r\nmankind, and if there could be any improvement at all, it would be\r\nextremely slow and unimportant. It is the peculiarities of individuals\r\nwhich alone can furnish the points of departure for new modes of action\r\nand new plans of life. Hence it is not less the right of individuals\r\nthan it is the interest of the race that every one should not only be\r\npermitted, but should even be encouraged to follow the dictates of his\r\nown genius, with the most perfect and unlimited freedom consistent with\r\nthe peace and security of other men. Each one of the numberless buds on\r\na full-grown tree is the germ of another individual precisely similar to\r\nthe one from which it is taken. But if new trees are propagated from\r\nthese buds, they will exhibit not the slightest diversity in character\r\nfrom that of the parent stock. It is only from the seed, original\r\ncentres of vitality and individuality that new varieties are produced\r\nand improvements obtained either in the flower or the fruit. So in human\r\nsociety: if each life is only an offshoot from the main body--a mere bud\r\nfrom the parent tree--with no diversities in character, and no salient\r\npoints of original activity, it is evident that men would remain\r\nsubstantially the same from generation to generation, and society would\r\nstand still forever. Such, it is well known, is the case in those\r\nEastern nations in which a rigid system of caste prevails, the same\r\npositions and occupations descending from father to son, without the\r\npossibility of one generation escaping from the fatal routine to which\r\nits predecessor was subjected.\r\n\r\nHence it is that Mr. Mill, with great earnestness, insists that 'there\r\nshould be different experiments in living,' and 'that the worth of\r\ndifferent modes of life should be proved practically, when any one\r\nthinks fit to try them;' for, he continues, 'where not the person's own\r\ncharacter, but the traditions and customs of other people are the rule\r\nof conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human\r\nhappiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social\r\nprogress.' Undoubtedly, that man who acts in conformity with his own\r\nnature and disposition, if they do not mislead and betray him, will have\r\ngreater satisfaction and enjoyment than he who is constrained by the\r\nopinions or authority of others to pursue courses not conformable to his\r\ntaste and judgment. That which men naturally incline to undertake and\r\nardently desire to accomplish, is usually that which they are best\r\nfitted to do, and which will give the most appropriate exercise to their\r\npeculiar faculties. It is evidently the general interest that every\r\nindividual in society should be employed in that peculiar work which he\r\ncan best perform. More will be effected, with less dissatisfaction and\r\nsuffering. And obviously, no better mode can be devised to put every man\r\nto the thing for which he is capacitated by nature, than to give full\r\nscope to his individuality, under the multiplied and powerful influences\r\nwhich liberal education and elevated society are calculated to exert in\r\nimpelling him forward. The effect will be not only to do more for\r\nsociety as a whole, but to make superior men by means of self-education.\r\n'He who does anything because it is the custom, makes no choice. He\r\ngains no practice either in discerning or desiring what is best. The\r\nmental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being\r\nused. The faculties are called into no exercise by doing a thing merely\r\nbecause others do it, no more than by believing a thing only because\r\nothers believe it. If the grounds of an opinion are not conclusive to a\r\nperson's own reason, his reason cannot be strengthened, but is likely to\r\nbe weakened by adopting it: and if the inducements to an act are not\r\nsuch as are consentaneous to his own feelings and character (where\r\naffection or the rights of others are not concerned), it is so much done\r\ntoward rendering his feelings and character inert and torpid, instead of\r\nactive and energetic.'\r\n\r\nAgainst these views, and, indeed, against the great body of valuable\r\nthoughts so admirably presented in this work, no rational objection\r\nwould seem to be fairly adducible. But there are some very striking\r\npassages liable to a very different criticism--passages which, if not\r\nfounded on actual misconception of facts, are, at least, so exaggerated\r\nin statement as to require very material modifications, both as to the\r\nexistence of the evil they allege and the remedy they propose. Mr. Mill\r\ncomplains of the despotism of society as having utterly suppressed all\r\nspontaneity or individuality, and reduced the mass of mankind to a\r\ncondition of lamentable uniformity. He thinks this evil has not only\r\ngone to a dangerous extent already, but that it threatens a still\r\nfurther invasion of individual liberty with even greater disasters in\r\nits train. It is better, however, to let Mr. Mill speak for himself in\r\nthe following passages:\r\n\r\n     'But society has now fairly got the better of individuality; and\r\n     the danger which threatens human nature is not the excess but the\r\n     deficiency of personal impulses and preferences.' * * *\r\n\r\n     'In our times, from the highest class of society down to the\r\n     lowest, every one lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded\r\n     censorship.' * * *\r\n\r\n     'I do not mean that they choose what is customary, in preference to\r\n     what suits their inclination. It does not occur to them to have any\r\n     inclination except for what is customary. Thus the mind itself is\r\n     bowed to the yoke; even in what people do for pleasure, conformity\r\n     is the first thing thought of; they like in crowds; they exercise\r\n     choice only among things commonly done; peculiarity of taste,\r\n     eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes; until by\r\n     dint of not following their own nature they have no nature to\r\n     follow; their human capacities are withered and starved; they\r\n     become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are\r\n     generally without either opinions or feelings of home growth or\r\n     properly their own.'\r\n\r\nAnd so, speaking of men of genius as being less capable than other\r\npersons 'of fitting themselves, without hurtful compression, into any of\r\n_the small number of moulds_ which society provides in order to save its\r\nmembers the trouble of forming their own character,' he continues:\r\n\r\n     'If they are of a strong character and break their fetters, they\r\n     become a mark for the society which has not succeeded in reducing\r\n     them to commonplace, to point at with solemn warning, as 'wild,'\r\n     'erratic,' and the like; much as if one should complain of the\r\n     Niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks like a\r\n     Dutch canal.'\r\n\r\nMr. Buckle also bears testimony to the same effect in the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n     'The immense mass of mankind are, in regard to their usages, in a\r\n     state of social slavery; each man being bound under heavy\r\n     penalties, to conform to the standard of life common to his own\r\n     class. How serious these penalties are, is evident from the fact\r\n     that though innumerable persons complain of prevailing customs, and\r\n     wish to shake them off, they dare not do so, but continue to\r\n     practise them, though frequently at the expense of health, comfort,\r\n     and fortune. Men not cowards in other respects, and of a fair share\r\n     of moral courage, are afraid to rebel against this grievous and\r\n     exacting tyranny.'\r\n\r\nNow, we are decidedly of opinion that the expressions used by both these\r\neminent writers are altogether too strong. We think it is true, both in\r\nEurope and America, that whenever the masses of society recognize a man\r\nof real genius, they are ever ready to welcome him with all his\r\npeculiarities--not merely to overlook his ordinary eccentricities, but\r\nto pardon grave offences against morality, and even to imitate his\r\nerrors. It may well be that the multitude are not quick to distinguish\r\nsuperiority; though with the proper information and opportunity of\r\njudging, they seldom fail instinctively to appreciate great qualities,\r\nespecially if these be such as relate to practical life, or artistic\r\ndevelopment, rather than to abstract and speculative science. Men\r\naddicted to pursuits of the latter kind, make their merits known more\r\nslowly; but when they are known, they command unbounded respect in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty, unfortunately, is, that the vast majority of men\r\nare not gifted with marked individuality, or great genius. They do not\r\nbreak through the trammels of custom, not so much because these trammels\r\nare strong, as because their impulses are weak. Whenever a man of real\r\nenergy appears, the crowd separates before him, the cobwebs of custom\r\nare brushed away as he advances, and the world receives him very\r\ngenerally for what he is worth, and too often for more. That impostors\r\nand pretenders frequently succeed in deceiving society, is owing to the\r\nfact that it is ever anxious and ready to receive and reward its\r\nbenefactors.\r\n\r\nBut even Mr. Mill himself recognizes the wisdom of paying due deference\r\nto the experience of mankind, and of considering established customs as\r\n_prima facie_ good, and proper to be followed. He admits 'that people\r\nshould be so taught and trained in youth, as to know and benefit by the\r\nascertained results of human experience,' and that 'the traditions and\r\ncustoms of other people are, to a certain extent, evidence of what their\r\nexperience has taught _them_; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a\r\nclaim to his deference.' From all which, it is plain that there is a\r\njust medium between what is recognized and established, and what is\r\nnewly proposed as a substitute for the old. The masses of mankind are\r\nincapable of judging between the value of prevailing usages and novel\r\npractices; much less are they capable themselves of striking out new\r\npaths fit to be followed by their fellow men. The true difficulty then\r\nis the want of energetic individuality and original genius, rather than\r\nthe want of a field for the exhibition of their power, or an opportunity\r\nfor their exertion. It cannot be denied, however, that there is a\r\ncertain inertia in society, requiring no little exertion to overcome it,\r\neven in the case of unquestionable improvements. But this is\r\nunavoidable, and at the same time most fortunate for the safety of\r\nmankind; for otherwise, we should be subjected to perpetual changes and\r\nsudden convulsions, which would make even progress itself a doubtful\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThere is also another important aspect in which this question may be\r\nadvantageously considered. No one doubts that coöperation in society\r\ncontributes vastly to the increase of human power, production, and\r\nhappiness. Unanimity in sentiment promotes harmony, and contributes to\r\nprosperity. Nor will it be denied that if truth could be certainly\r\nattained upon any point whatever, it would be desirable that it should\r\nbe universally recognized and accepted. Undoubtedly, if any man in the\r\ncommunity should be disposed to dispute that truth, he ought to be\r\npermitted freely to do so; but we cannot see that this opposition would\r\nbe better than his acquiescence. Now, the problem is to reconcile the\r\ndegree of unanimity and coöperation which is requisite for the full\r\nexertion of social power, with that amount of individuality which would\r\nbe useful in promoting a progressive change. Spontaneity or originality\r\nis disintegrating in its immediate tendency. It disturbs the order of\r\nsociety, though, in the end, on the whole, it is advantageous. Thus we\r\nhave the tenacity of old habits and prevailing sentiments on the one\r\nhand, tending to the harmony of society, and enabling all its members to\r\ncoöperate in the great works which make communities powerful. On the\r\nother hand, we have the sporadic and disturbing efforts of individual\r\ngenius, ever seeking to withdraw the social current into new channels,\r\nand eventually, through many trials, errors, failures, and triumphs,\r\nalluring and leading it into better paths. It is not good for society\r\nthat either of these conflicting forces should gain the decided\r\nascendency; nor do we believe with Mr. Mill, that the preponderance at\r\nthe present time belongs to the former.\r\n\r\nAs to the influence of fashion, which is evidently alluded to in the\r\npassages quoted, that plainly stands on a different and peculiar\r\nfooting. It has a double power to enforce its decrees. The one is\r\neconomical and commercial--the power of capital to control productions,\r\nand the advantages of producing largely after a few forms or patterns;\r\nthe other is the social or psychological influence--the natural sympathy\r\namong men which induces uniformity of dress and habit. Extravagant\r\nexcess often rules. Yet there is never wanting in the public of all\r\ncivilized countries, a disposition to adopt improvements when they\r\ncontribute to the general convenience, economy, and happiness; and we\r\nbelieve, on the whole, the tendency is to become more and more rational\r\nevery day. Besides, a certain degree of uniformity is desirable in this\r\nas in all other things. No little loss and inconvenience would ensue if\r\nthe fancies of every individual were permitted to run riot, and no man's\r\ntaste were modified by that of his neighbor, or controlled by the\r\ngeneral inclination. It is impossible to conceive the motley and\r\ndiscordant mass which a community of such people would present.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of these social phenomena in other directions and upon other\r\ninterests, is the subject of equal condemnation by the author. The\r\neffect upon government, and the general tendency of the democratic\r\nprinciple, are represented in such highly colored pictures as these:\r\n\r\n     'In sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid to\r\n     real or supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things\r\n     throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power\r\n     among mankind.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     'At present, individuals are lost in the crowd. In politics it is\r\n     almost a triviality to say that public opinion rules the world. The\r\n     only power deserving the name is that of masses, and of\r\n     governments, while they make themselves the organ of the tendencies\r\n     and instincts of masses. This is as true in the moral and social\r\n     relations of private life as in public transactions. Those whose\r\n     opinions go by the name of public opinions, are not always the same\r\n     sort of public; in America they are the whole white population; in\r\n     England, chiefly the middle class. But they are always a mass, that\r\n     is to say, collective mediocrity.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     'Their thinking is done for them by one mind like themselves,\r\n     addressing them or speaking in their name, on the spur of the\r\n     moment, through the newspapers. I do not assert that anything\r\n     better is compatible, as a general rule, with the present low state\r\n     of the human mind. But that does not hinder the government of\r\n     mediocrity from being mediocre government. No government by a\r\n     democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its political acts,\r\n     or in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it fosters,\r\n     ever did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the\r\n     sovereign many may have let themselves be guided (which in their\r\n     best times they have always done) by the counsels and influence of\r\n     a more highly gifted and instructed One or Few. The initiation of\r\n     all wise or noble things comes and must come from individuals;\r\n     generally at first from some one individual.'\r\n\r\nIn all this there is too much truth; but it is truth which is wholly\r\nunavoidable. Nor are the circumstances complained of peculiar to the\r\npresent age, or to the institutions which now generally prevail.\r\nDemocratic and representative forms of government have so degenerated,\r\nas to fail in the vital point of bringing the best and ablest men to the\r\ncontrol of affairs. But has any more despotic or hereditary form been\r\nequally successful, in the long run, in promoting the freedom, progress,\r\nand grandeur of nations? Is the mediocrity of a whole people more\r\ninjurious to humanity than the precarious superiority of distinguished\r\nfamilies, or the selfish power of haughty privileged classes? One\r\nimportant consideration seems to be overlooked by Mr. Mill in these\r\none-sided views of the present condition of society; and that is, the\r\ncomparatively greater elevation and improvement of the whole mass of\r\ncivilized communities; and the question is suggested, whether humanity\r\nis more interested in the mediocre power of the millions, or the\r\nexceptional greatness of a few men of extraordinary genius; whether the\r\ninfluence of individual originality is actually lost to the world,\r\nbecause it is apparently overshadowed by the moderate intelligence of\r\nthe countless masses of men. We maintain that the loss of this influence\r\nis not real, but merely apparent: like some great wave in the boundless\r\nocean, it seems to sink into the quiet surface, while in truth its\r\neffects are necessarily felt on the shores of the most distant\r\ncontinents and islands. Society, at the present time, is in a state of\r\ntransition; it is engaged in absorbing ideas and influences which seem\r\nutterly to disappear in its fathomless depths, while it is simply\r\npreparing for higher exertions and nobler conquests over ignorance and\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nOne thing at least may be said with obvious truth, and with certainty of\r\nlarge compensation for the evils supposed to exist in the present\r\ncondition of society, as represented by Mr. Mill; it is this: if public\r\nopinion is so omnipotent in the enforcement of mediocre schemes and\r\nideas, it can bring to bear a vast fund of power, whenever real genius\r\nmay be so fortunate as to make itself felt and respected. No man having\r\nany faith in humanity, not even Mr. Mill himself, will deny the power of\r\nindividual genius to make its impression even on the mediocre masses;\r\nfor that would be to deny the essential nature and efficiency of\r\noriginality, and its capacity to accomplish the work which it is\r\ndestined to do for the benefit of mankind. Actual conditions at the\r\npresent moment, may possibly place unusual obstructions in the way of\r\ngenius; though the entire freedom and accessibility of the press would\r\nseem to negative that view. At any rate, it follows from the very\r\npremises of Mr. Mill and those who think with him, that the actual\r\norganization of society, of which he complains, if it can be wielded in\r\nthe interest of great ideas, is possessed of an authority which will\r\nmake its decrees irresistible. In this fact we see ground of hope,\r\nrather than of despair, for the future of mankind. Mediocrity cannot\r\nalways hold the reins and direct the progress of human society.\r\n\r\nIn his work on representative government, Mr. Mill fully recognizes the\r\noperation of free institutions as 'an agency of national education;' and\r\nhe well says, 'a representative constitution is a means of bringing the\r\ngeneral standard of intelligence and honesty existing in the community,\r\nand the individual intellect and virtue of its wisest members more\r\ndirectly to bear upon the government, and investing them with greater\r\ninfluence in it than they would have under any other mode of\r\norganization.' It cannot be otherwise. The masses are gradually rising\r\nin intelligence, as well as in the capacity and disposition to recognize\r\nand receive real superiority wherever it may be found. Certain cumbrous\r\nmachinery heretofore used in social and political action, now stands in\r\nthe way of free and efficient efforts to reach the best results. But\r\nthese impediments will soon be swept away. They cannot remain eternally\r\nin the path of society; for, if by no other means, they will be removed\r\nby the flood of discontent and denunciation which now surges violently\r\nagainst them, and threatens them every instant with demolition and\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUD AND SUNSHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A dusky vapor veils the sky,\r\n    And darkens on the dewy slopes;\r\n  Chill airs on rustling wings flit by,\r\n    Sad as the sigh o'er buried hopes:\r\n  I tread the cloistered walk alone,\r\n    Between the shadow and the light,\r\n  While from the church tower thronging down\r\n    Pale phantoms greet the coming night.\r\n\r\n  My heart swells high with scorn and hate\r\n    At social fictions, narrow laws\r\n  By which the few maintain their state,\r\n    And build us out with golden bars:\r\n  'She wears a careless smile,' I said,\r\n    'And regal jewels on her brow;\r\n  Those queenly lips, ere now, have made\r\n    Rare mockery of her broken vow.\r\n\r\n  'And what was I,--to touch that heart?\r\n    Only a poet, made to pour\r\n  Love's silver phrase with subtle art\r\n    In tides of music at her door.\r\n  What though she bore a brightened blush,\r\n    As if the echo linger'd long?\r\n  Even so she listens to the thrush\r\n    That thrills the air with eddying song.\r\n\r\n  'How sweet, on summer-scented morns,\r\n    To hear through all our lingering walk,\r\n  As soft as dew on fragrant lawns,\r\n    The wandering music of her talk!\r\n  Ah! dreaming heart, that asked no more\r\n    When dower'd with that o'erflowing smile:\r\n  Ah! foolish heart, to linger o'er\r\n    The memories that can still beguile.'\r\n\r\n  I paused. On distant breezes borne,\r\n    A silken stir floats slowly by,\r\n  And from the clouds a silver dawn\r\n    Breaks through the vapor-shrouded sky;\r\n  The cloister'd walk is paved with light,\r\n    And bathed in crystal beams she stands:\r\n  No jewels crown her presence bright,\r\n    A single rose is in her hands.\r\n\r\n  'Oh! fair white rose,' she softly said,\r\n    'Make peace between my love and me;\r\n  Lest from my life the colors fade,\r\n    And leave me faint and pale like thee:\r\n  Tell him that dearer is the flower\r\n    Once honored by his poet hand,\r\n  Than ermined rank, and princely power,\r\n    With any noble in the land.'\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Then soft as rose-leaf on my brow\r\n    A sudden kiss comes floating down,\r\n  On wings as light as angels know,\r\n    And crowns me with a kingly crown.\r\n  And banish'd by a touch divine,\r\n    Fled all the memories of pain;\r\n  I clasped the pleading hands in mine,\r\n    And told her all my love again.\r\n\r\n  The pale mist like an incense cloud\r\n    From some great altar drifts away,\r\n  In silvery fullness o'er us flows\r\n    The glory of a pallid day.\r\n  Amid the opening buds of hope\r\n    I smile at half-forgotten fears;\r\n  For love, I said, grows holier still\r\n    And purer through baptismal tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'IS THERE ANYTHING IN IT?\r\n\r\n'A true bill.'-SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to be 'verdant' in the art of legislation. A short time since I\r\npaid my initiation fee, and learned the mystery. It is true I had heard\r\nmuch of legislative corruption, and had often seen paragraphs relating\r\nthereto in the newspapers, but I looked upon them as political squibs,\r\nput forth by the 'outs' in revenge for the defeat of their party\r\nschemes. Here let me stoutly assert that I cannot testify of my own\r\nknowledge to any instance of legislative corruption. _Mem:_ This\r\ndeclaration is intended to save me from being called before any of the\r\nnumerous investigating committees, which, like the schoolmaster, are\r\nabroad just now. At the same time I propose to relate in brief terms how\r\nI was initiated, and the reader may rest assured that it is 'an ower\r\ntrue tale.'\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 186-, not very long ago, you will perceive, the\r\ncorporation of which I was a member found it important to obtain some\r\nlegislation which would be very serviceable to those concerned. I was\r\nselected to go to Harrisburg, to see the members of the Legislature\r\nindividually, and request them, if there was nothing objectionable in\r\nthe bill, to vote for it. I had no doubt but that my reasons would prove\r\nsatisfactory, especially as our business was of a nature to essentially\r\ncontribute to the development of the mineral and agricultural resources\r\nof the State. With these honest and innocent ideas of legislation, I\r\nstarted on my mission. On arriving at the capitol, I called on our\r\nimmediate member, Mr. Jones, who, if his own professions were to be\r\ntrusted, was anxious to do all he could to promote the object of my\r\nvisit. He was an old member, and 'knew the ropes.' From him I had every\r\nreason to expect aid in procuring the passage of my bill. His room was\r\nat a hotel, where a large number of the members of both houses boarded,\r\nand he knew them all. Of course, it was a very proper place for me to\r\ntake rooms. I accompanied Jones to the gentlemen's sitting room in the\r\nevening, where he introduced me to many of his fellow legislators, at\r\nthe same time hinting to them that I might have a bill of some\r\nimportance for them to consider. In one or two instances, I noticed that\r\nknowing glances were exchanged between Jones and those to whom he\r\nintroduced me. On one occasion a member called him aside, and, after\r\nsome other conversation, in a low tone, said: _'Is there anything in\r\nit?'_ The remark was so decidedly foreign to anything that could refer\r\nto my bill, that I concluded that it related to some rumor that was\r\nfloating about without any certainty of its truth.\r\n\r\nDuring the next day, I employed myself in listening to the debates and\r\nwatching the course of business in the House. It was all new to me, and,\r\nof course, very interesting. While seated in the lobby, a middle-aged\r\nman of short stature, dark whiskers, and limping gait, whom I had heard\r\ndesignated as 'Sheriff,' and who appeared to have no visible means of\r\nsupport in Harrisburg, except his cane, carelessly dropped into a seat\r\nby my side, and engaged in commonplace conversation. He soon approached\r\na more business-like matter, and said he had understood I was interested\r\nin some local legislation which would come before the House. I told him\r\nthat I had charge of a bill which I should endeavor to have passed, 'It\r\nrequires some tact and experience,' said he, 'to engineer a bill through\r\nsuch a House as this;' and he ended this preliminary conversation by\r\nasking the same mysterious question I had heard the night previous,\r\nviz.; _'Is there anything in it?'_ I answered that I hoped there would\r\nbe something in it, if it passed, for the parties interested, as it\r\nwould enable us to develop certain matters of interest to the State, as\r\nwell as to make a profit for the stockholders. 'If,' said he, 'it is a\r\nbill of such importance, you ought to have some man of experience to\r\nassist you in putting it through.' I assured him that 'our member' was a\r\nman of experience, and would stand by me, and be ready and willing to\r\nimpart any instruction that might be necessary. The answer I received\r\nwas a sarcastic smile, and the 'Sheriff' left.\r\n\r\nI continued to watch the course of legislation for a few days, and soon\r\ndiscovered that I was the object of considerable interest to a number of\r\noutsiders. Whenever I entered the lobby, the 'Sheriff' and several\r\ngentlemen, who were always in his company, would cast their eyes in the\r\ndirection of my seat, and then confer together. They seemed to keep a\r\nstrict watch on my movements. At last, when an opportunity offered, I\r\nasked Jones what this 'Sheriff' was doing about the House. 'He seems to\r\nhave no business, and is constantly watching the proceedings of both\r\nHouses, vibrating between them like an animated pendulum,' said I. 'Oh,'\r\nsaid Jones, 'he is a member of the _Third House!_' Here was a new thing\r\nto me. I evidently had not learned all the machinery of legislating. I\r\nasked for an explanation, and soon learned that the 'Third House'\r\nconsisted of old ex-members of either House or Senate, broken-down\r\npoliticians, professional borers, and other vagrants who had made\r\nthemselves familiar with the _modus operandi_ of legislation, and who\r\nnegotiated for the votes of members on terms to be agreed upon by the\r\ncontracting parties--in short, these were the Lobby members of the\r\nLegislature--a portion of mankind which I had never heard mentioned in\r\nterms other than contempt and disgust. Was I then to become familiar\r\nwith these leeches--these genteel loafers, who, having no apparent\r\nbusiness, yet manage to live at the best hotels, drink the best of\r\nwines, and go home at the end of the session with more money than any of\r\nthe _honest_ members? The sequel will show.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a week, I became impatient at the want of interest on the\r\npart of Jones in my bill, which so materially concerned a large number\r\nof his constituents. He, better than any other member, knew how much our\r\ncompany was doing for the development of the country, the furnishing of\r\nemployment for laborers, and the increase of taxable inhabitants. He\r\nknew that not a man in the county had an objection to urge, or a\r\nremonstrance to present against our proposition. Why, then, did he not\r\ntake my ready-drawn bill and present it without any further delay?\r\n\r\nJones was a member of the committee on corporations, and was said to\r\nhave much influence in that important vestibule to the temple whence\r\ncorporate privileges issue. He might, then, if so disposed, soon have my\r\nbill through that committee, I determined to bring the matter to a point\r\nat once, and cut short my board bill by a speedy presentation of my\r\nlegislative bill, or obtain the unequivocal refusal of 'our member' to\r\nact. I had spent one Sunday in Harrisburg, and did not wish to suffer\r\nanother infliction of the kind, if any effort of mine could avoid it. On\r\nMonday the House did not meet until three o'clock, as those members who\r\nlive within a few hours' ride of the capital always wish to go home, and\r\nanother class wish to spend Saturday and Sunday in Philadelphia,\r\nenjoying the various _hospitalities_ of the city of Brotherly Love, and\r\nthe superior facilities for religious instruction, of which legislators\r\ngenerally stand in great need. These two parties combine, and have no\r\ndifficulty in adjourning over from Friday noon to Monday evening.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the House, I was promptly on hand, and at once\r\nattacked Jones. I handed him my bill, drawn in due form, saying:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Jones, I have been here a week, and have made no progress in the\r\nbusiness for which I came. I am anxious to be at home attending to other\r\nduties. I propose to leave the bill in your hands, and depend upon you\r\nto see it through. There seems to be no necessity of my being detained\r\nlonger, for I cannot hasten the matter. There cannot be the slightest\r\nobjection, I presume, to its passage, when once introduced.'\r\n\r\nJones saw that I was becoming impatient, and seemed to be entirely\r\nsatisfied that I should be quite so; and he informed me that the chief\r\ndifficulty would be in passing it through the committee on corporations.\r\nThe bills referred to that committee, he said, were always scrutinized\r\nvery closely, and it would need some engineering. He clapped his hands,\r\nand called a page to his seat, whispered a few words to him, when he,\r\nlike Puck, darted off on his errand. Jones then turned to me, and\r\nrenewed the conversation. I soon saw the veritable Third House\r\n'Sheriff,' whom I have described, approaching us. 'Our member' then\r\nhanded him the bill, saying:\r\n\r\n'My friend here is very desirous of pushing his bill through. Do you\r\nthink there will be any difficulty about it?'\r\n\r\nI could not see the propriety of consulting this Third House borer,\r\nespecially as he was a total stranger to me. The 'Sheriff' looked wise\r\na short time, and then said:\r\n\r\n'Well' (addressing his conversation to me), 'you know that we have all\r\nkinds of men to deal with here, and some of them will pay no attention\r\nto a bill, however meritorious, _if there is nothing in it_--I mean, if\r\nit brings no money to their pockets. It is very lamentable that such is\r\nthe case, but long experience has taught me that no bill of as much\r\nimportance as yours, can get through here, without the aid of money.'\r\n\r\nI was dumb with indignation! The flood of legislative light thus\r\nsuddenly shed upon my unsophisticated mental vision, was too dazzling\r\nfor me. I replied, when I could command my voice, with some very severe\r\nanimadversions on bribery and corruption, with which the 'Sheriff' and\r\nJones expressed a hearty agreement, but they said we must take men as we\r\nfind them, and deal with them accordingly, or do without what we knew to\r\nbe our just dues; and the 'Sheriff' hobbled away, and took a seat in the\r\nlobby. I left Jones with a determination to go over to the Senate and\r\nconsult with the Senator from our district, and ascertain whether he\r\nentertained the same views of necessary appliances for legislation, as\r\ndid my friends of the Second and Third Houses. Our Senator was a very\r\nsedate man, who had a reputation for honesty and piety, equalled only by\r\nthat of Jones himself. I explained my business, showed him my bill, and\r\nhe read it carefully through. On handing it back to me, he said,\r\nquietly:\r\n\r\n'If there _is anything in it,_ it will pass without much opposition. If\r\nnot, it will hardly go through the House. There is a _Ring_ formed over\r\nthere, which will prevent any legislation of this kind, unless it is\r\nwell paid for.'\r\n\r\nHere was another legislative idiom! 'The Ring.' What did that mean? I\r\nwas not long kept in ignorance, for I soon learned that it was a\r\ncombination of members who had agreed to vote for no bill unless\r\napproved by them, and not only approved, but well paid for. It was easy\r\nfor twenty or thirty individuals to control all important legislation in\r\nthis way, by casting their votes for one side or the other. This ring is\r\nalways in alliance with the Third House, and always in market, as I\r\nlearned by my brief experience.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that I must go about the business of legislation as I would\r\nany other purchase, I began to figure up the profit and loss account, to\r\nsee how much fleecing we could stand, and make the bill profitable to\r\nourselves. I returned to Jones to ascertain, if possible, if he was in\r\nthe ring, and how much money it would require to get my bill through. He\r\nat once and most emphatically disclaimed all knowledge of the ring, and\r\ncould not tell at all, how much money would be needed. He advised me to\r\ngo to my Third House friend, the 'Sheriff,' who was posted up in such\r\nmatters, and I concluded to act on his suggestion. The 'Sheriff's'\r\nadvice was of a very practical nature. He thought it might take $3,000\r\nto get it through--perhaps $5,000 for both House and Senate. It seemed a\r\nsheer piece of robbery and corruption, and I delayed further action\r\nuntil I could write to the directors of our corporation and state the\r\ncase to them. This delayed me another week. When the answer came, it\r\nenclosed a check for $5,000, with directions to 'buy the scoundrels, if\r\nthey were for sale, like dogs in the market.' On the day after I\r\nreceived the check, I went to the House, determined to make the best\r\nterms I could among those who followed legislation as a trade and made\r\nmerchandise of their votes. Jones thought $3,000 would get it through\r\nthe committee on corporations, and if I would hand him that amount he\r\nwould manage it as economically as possible. He insisted that he did not\r\nwish anything for himself. He would scorn to accept a cent for his\r\ninfluence, and would feel everlastingly disgraced to take a farthing\r\nfrom a constituent. He was only anxious to serve me and have me fleeced\r\nas little as possible. Of course, I believed him. In proof of my\r\nconfidence, I immediately handed over $2,000 to his custody, in\r\nconvenient packages for distribution. The same day my bill was read in\r\nplace and referred to the committee on corporations! This was on\r\nTuesday. On Thursday I was at the seat of Jones, when he reported the\r\nbill from his committee. As he took it from his desk, a small strip of\r\npaper was dropped upon the floor. It seemed to have been accidentally\r\nfolded in the bill. It was, beyond all question, accidentally dropped. I\r\npicked it up, not knowing but that it might be of some importance. As he\r\nwas reporting various bills, I looked at the slip of paper. The title of\r\nmy bill was at the head, or immediately following the words, 'In\r\ncommittee,' and below were eight names, foremost of which was that of\r\n'our member.' The names and figures were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Jones,   $125  McGee,     $125\r\n  Smith,    125  McMurphy,   125\r\n  Baker,    125  Grabup,     125\r\n  Van Dunk, 125  Holdum,     125\r\n                           -----\r\n  Am't received by Jones, $1,000\r\n\r\nI folded this interesting _morceau_, and placed it in my pocket. I was\r\ngreatly surprised to see the name of Jones down for $125, when he had so\r\npositively declared that he did not want a cent; but I was happy to find\r\nthat he had expended only $1,000 to get it through the committee. When\r\nhe took his seat, I asked him if he had any difficulty in passing the\r\nbill through the committee? He said he had a little. The members thought\r\n$2,000 rather a small 'divy' (the legislative commercial phrase for\r\ndividend) for such a bill; but he induced them to let it go through for\r\nthat sum. I could not but remember that little memorandum in my pocket,\r\nwhich only exhibited a distribution of half that amount, including one\r\neighth of the sum to 'Jones.' It looked very much as if his fellow\r\ncommittee men had been sold as well as bought, and that he had quietly\r\npocketed $1,125 in the operation. However, I said nothing, but concluded\r\nthat I was fast being initiated into the mysteries of _honorable_\r\nlegislation. I must now wait to see if my money would hold out to carry\r\nthe bill through, provided Jones continued to be the financial agent,\r\nand continued to make a fifty per cent. dividend for himself before\r\ndisbursing to his fellows. I thought his course did not look like 'honor\r\namong thieves.'\r\n\r\nAfter the bill was reported, my friend, the 'Sheriff,' came to\r\ncongratulate me on such prompt action by the committee, and hoped I\r\nwould be as successful with the ring on the floor of the House. I told\r\nhim that he seemed to be well posted on such matters, and I would like\r\nto retain him as my counsellor in the case. With that characteristic\r\nmodesty which adheres to a veteran member of the Third House, who has\r\nserved fifteen winters in the lobby, he protested his want of ability to\r\nmanage such matters; but concluded that, if I really desired it, he\r\nwould assist me all in his power. I insisted that he was just the man,\r\nand must stand by me. We immediately entered into negotiations, I was to\r\nplace my remaining $3,000 in his hands, and he would use such portions\r\nof it as would be necessary to secure the ring in both branches of the\r\nLegislature. He would disburse as little as possible, and return me what\r\nremained, out of which I could pay him what I thought proper for his\r\nservices. As he was well acquainted with nearly all the members, I had\r\nno doubt of his ability to carry it through, for it was just that kind\r\nof a bill that no valid objection could be raised against. Jones, who\r\nhad proved by his acts how entirely disinterested he was in all his\r\nefforts in my behalf, told me that there need be no fear of the\r\n'Sheriff,' and he (Jones) would be responsible for a fair account of the\r\ndisbursement of the money. I could have no suspicion of Jones's honesty\r\nand fair dealing after my previous experience; so, in presence of our\r\nhonest member, I handed over the $3,000. Soon after this, I saw the\r\n'Sheriff' and Jones figuring earnestly together, and then go and consult\r\nwith several members, who I supposed were in the ring. It would be\r\nungenerous to suppose that Jones would receive money for voting for a\r\nbill to improve his own county, and he was undoubtedly doing all he\r\ncould without compensation, while entirely conscious that others were\r\nbeing paid. My readers will be as ready to adopt this opinion as myself\r\nafter what I have already recorded of him. Private bill day came, and\r\nmine was on the calendar. I must confess to a little palpitation when I\r\nheard the title read. I was made anxious and indignant, when a member\r\nfrom Philadelphia started to his feet, and said:\r\n\r\n'I object to that bill.'\r\n\r\nJones trusted the member would not insist on his objection to that\r\npurely local bill. It was no use, the objection was adhered to. When\r\nbusiness proceeded again, Jones went to the objecting member, who sat\r\nnear where I stood anxiously watching the proceedings. Jones spoke to\r\nhim warmly, when the other retorted with:\r\n\r\n'Well, _if there is anything in it,_ I will withdraw my objection, but\r\nnot until I am _satisfied_.'\r\n\r\nThe objector passed into the rotunda with Jones and the 'Sheriff,' where\r\nhe _must_ have been satisfied, for when he returned to his seat, he\r\nwithdrew his objection, and it was, with the others, laid aside for a\r\nsecond reading. I never knew the arguments which were presented to\r\ninduce him to withdraw his objection, but he probably found _how much_\r\nthere was 'in it.' In the afternoon my bill passed without opposition.\r\n\r\nThe 'Sheriff' now informed me that I must hurry up the transcribing of\r\nmy bill, or it would be a long time in getting over to the Senate. I\r\ntold him that I supposed all bills must take their course according to\r\ntheir numbers. He said he would go to the clerk with me and get it\r\n'hurried up.' When we spoke to the clerk, he said it could not be\r\ntranscribed for a day or two, for it was nearly at the bottom of the\r\nlarge package that had been passed. The 'Sheriff' quietly handed a\r\nfive-dollar note to the clerk, and his mind suddenly changed, and,\r\n'seeing it is for you,' he would have it attended to immediately. The\r\nnext thing to be looked for was a transcribing clerk who would do it.\r\nAnother five-dollar note accomplished this object, and the work was\r\nfinished up that night. In the morning it went to the Senate, and there\r\nit went through smoothly.\r\n\r\nAfter my success, I called on the 'Sheriff' to see how much of the\r\n$3,000 he had used. As I anticipated, it was all used; but I strongly\r\nsuspected that the whole ring, in this case, consisted of Jones, the\r\n'Sheriff,' and the objecting member who went into the rotunda, and that\r\nthe two former made a pretty large 'divy,' and paid the others,\r\nincluding the clerks, as little as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my investigations, I learned that one of the Third\r\nHouse often receives money on his own representation that certain\r\nmembers will not vote without pay, when they (the members) are entirely\r\ninnocent and unsuspecting, while the leeches of the lobby are selling\r\ntheir votes and charging them with bribery.\r\n\r\nSuch is the little 'mystery' which I paid five thousand dollars to\r\nbecome acquainted with. As our company has no more acts of incorporation\r\nto ask for, I hope never to be obliged to learn the lesson over again.\r\n\r\nPerhaps others may manage better and cheaper from taking note of my\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATION AND THE NATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the States which are now in war against the Government, declared\r\nthemselves no longer bound by the Constitution, and no longer parts of\r\nthe nation, they rested their action, so far as they deigned to account\r\nfor it, on the ground that the United States were nothing more than a\r\nconfederation, constituted such by a mere compact, which could be broken\r\nwhen the interests or the whim of any party so dictated. The loyal\r\nStates, on the other hand, straightway took up arms in defence of the\r\nintegrity of the nation, constituted such by organic law, which is\r\nsupreme forever throughout the length and breadth of the land. Now,\r\nwhile there are in our midst men base enough to endeavor to seduce the\r\nunthinking portion of our community to the idea that the traitors are\r\nentitled to those rights, and to be treated in that way conceded only by\r\none nation to another, it may be well to consider, in the light of our\r\nown history, the argument as to the nature of our Government; for it is\r\nonly by granting the correctness of the view advanced by the rebels,\r\nthat we can for one moment entertain any proposition for compromise, or\r\nany of those vague but pernicious ideas brought forward by Peace\r\nDemocrats looking to a disgraceful settlement of this war. With this\r\npurpose in view, we propose to briefly examine the main points in the\r\nArticles of Confederation and the Constitution, and by thus comparing\r\nthe frameworks of the two governments, to show the definite and\r\nirreconcilable difference which exists between them.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation were entered on within four days after the\r\nsecond anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, by the same body\r\nwhich adopted that instrument, and about nine years before the adoption\r\nof the Constitution in convention. The three years which just elapsed\r\nhad been a season of singular and searching trial. While unity of\r\nfeeling was compelled in the face of a powerful and aggressive foe, and\r\nin the defence of liberties held and prized in common, the mutual\r\nrelations of the colonies were so indefinitely ascertained, and\r\nauthority was so loosely bestowed, that unity of action was impossible;\r\nthere was no power to do the very things which necessity and desire\r\nalike dictated. Having taken up arms against the most powerful nation of\r\nthe time, whose system enabled it to concentrate vast energies on the\r\nsubjugation of this dozen revolted colonies scattered along the Atlantic\r\ncoast, they found themselves in so helplessly disorganized a condition,\r\nthat, separated from the mother country, they could hardly, for any\r\nlength of time, have successfully pursued the quiet life of peace.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, they bound themselves together by Articles of\r\nConfederation. These were, what similar articles had always been, a\r\nspecies of treaty, having peculiar objects, seeking them in a peculiar\r\nway, and declared perpetual, but having an obligation no stronger than\r\nthat of a treaty, and practically dissoluble at the will of the parties.\r\nThus, the States issued letters of marque and reprisal; Congress\r\ndetermined on peace and war, but the States were depended on to accept\r\nthe former and carry on the latter when declared. Congress might\r\nascertain the number of ships and men to be furnished, but the States\r\nappointed the officers. Congress might fix the sums necessary to be used\r\nin defraying public expenses, but the States must raise them. Congress\r\nmight regulate the value of coin, but the States might issue it. The\r\nloose character of this tie is seen still more plainly in the fact that\r\nthere was no efficient final tribunal. The commissioners appointed by\r\nCongress might decide a controversy arising between two States, but\r\nthere was nothing by which the commissioners could be guided, no\r\nstability or force as precedents in their decisions when made, and no\r\npower to enforce them if neglected or rejected by one or both the\r\nparties. It was simply a provision for constantly recurring arbitration,\r\nobtained by reference to a changeable, and practically unauthoritative\r\nboard of judges. Moreover, this government, weak and unorganized as it\r\nwas, was withdrawn on the adjournment of Congress; for the Committee of\r\nStates, appointed to act in the recess, was useless, as well from the\r\npaucity of its powers, as from the fact that a quorum of its members\r\ncould seldom be obtained.\r\n\r\nSuch a system, or rather, lack of system, could be tolerated only while\r\nthe peril of their life and liberties compelled the people to perform\r\nthe duties the government was powerless to enforce. After the war was\r\nover, and the people were left with independence and freedom, with a\r\npowerful ally in Europe, with elements of unrivalled resource, but with\r\na heavy load of debt, with disorganized social and political relations,\r\nwith crippled commerce, and without the powerful uniting pressure from\r\noutside, this system of confederation began to develop its evils and its\r\ninsufficiency. To complete the triumph begun by the desolating struggle\r\nthrough which we had just passed, and, by building up a system under\r\nwhose operation the nation's wealth could pay the nation's debt, and the\r\nnation's power protect the nation's honor and interest, to assert at\r\nonce the claim and the right to respect, was the necessity of the time.\r\nTo answer this necessity was a very different thing from conducting the\r\nwar. Commerce was now to take the place of naval conflict; mutual\r\nintercourse in the interest of trade was to replace the performance of\r\nthose duties which the common defence had imposed. The life of the\r\npeople was now to be saved, not by armed struggles in its defence, but\r\nby nurturing its resources, opening its various channels, and freeing it\r\nfor the performance of its healthful and renewing functions.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, a system which could not make treaties of commerce\r\nwithout leaving it in the power of thirteen States to break them by\r\nretaliation, which could not prevent one or all of these States from\r\nutterly prohibiting the import or export of such commodities as they\r\nchose, and which left the people powerless to induce or compel\r\nadvantages from foreign commerce, while it was even more helpless in\r\nregard to domestic commerce--for this purpose such a system was\r\nabsolutely useless.\r\n\r\nAfter struggling for a few years under the cramping and confusing\r\neffects of this system, it was given up, and the Constitution, as framed\r\nin 1787, was adopted. The relations assumed by the States at this time\r\nwere marked. By the Articles, each State had retained its sovereignty,\r\nfreedom, and independence. By the Constitution, the people and the\r\nStates reserved such powers as were not expressly given to the United\r\nStates, or prohibited to the States. The omission of the claim to\r\nsovereignty and independence in the Constitution, is as significant as\r\nis its presence in the Articles. It appears as a definite surrender of\r\nthose attributes, as complete, as binding, as permanent as language\r\ncould make it. Nor must we forget, while the momentous questions of our\r\ntimes are yet undecided, that sovereignty once surrendered can never be\r\n'resumed.' The relations, the duties, and the attributes of the life to\r\nwhich it belongs have been completely and forever given up, while those\r\nof another have been as entirely and irrevocably assumed.\r\n\r\nThe States had thus passed from one into another sphere of existence,\r\nwhose relations were as different as their objects. The Articles were a\r\nleague of friendship for common defence, the security of liberties, and\r\nthe general and mutual welfare. No identity of interest was supposed to\r\nexist or sought to be served. Such needs as were, at the time of the\r\nadoption, felt in common, were provided for, and the States were left to\r\nprovide, as best they could, for the others. This much and no more was\r\nsought by the States. That the objects of the Constitution were\r\ndifferent, as well as that they were avowed by a far different\r\nauthority, is shown in the declaration with which it opens: 'We THE\r\nPEOPLE of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union'--not\r\nas to time, for both the old and the new union were declared perpetual;\r\nbut in kind, for which the States surrendered the former claim to\r\nsovereignty and independence. 'To establish justice'--not to insure the\r\namicable relations of allied States, but to form a tribunal which should\r\ndecide upon the common allegiance and the common privileges of the\r\npeople. 'To insure domestic tranquillity'--an object unrecognized in the\r\nArticles of Confederation, and implying, not association but identity;\r\nnot the mutual obligations of partnership, but the intimate connection\r\nof the national household. 'Do ordain and establish this Constitution.'\r\nThere is no longer the indefinite expression of half-conceived\r\nobligation, nor the imperfect pledge to imperfect union, but there is,\r\ninstead, the solemn, authoritative language of a sovereign people,\r\nself-contained, self-sufficing, conscious alike of its duties and its\r\nrights, giving form to what shall be the law of the land, fundamental as\r\nbeing based on the will of the people, supreme as higher than the will\r\nof any part of the people, whether individual or State.\r\n\r\nA difference as radical pervades all the provisions of the Constitution.\r\nBy the Articles, the vote in Congress was taken by States. By the\r\nConstitution, a majority controls in all but extraordinary business, and\r\nthe vote is always taken by members. The Congress is no longer the\r\nassembled States; it is the assembled representatives of the people--of\r\nthe nation. It is no longer charged with the management of the mutual\r\nrelations of parties to an alliance, but with the making of laws which\r\nshall be the supreme law of the land throughout its entire extent. By\r\nthe Articles, prohibitions to the States are made conditional on the\r\nconsent of Congress--but by the Constitution, the more important acts of\r\nsovereignty--forming treaties, issuing bills of credit, regulating the\r\ncirculating medium--are unconditionally forbidden to the States. The\r\nCongress now controls foreign commerce, raises the revenue, levies\r\ntaxes, and cares for the welfare of the nation. By the Articles, new\r\nmembers of the Confederation were to be admitted by the consent of\r\nnine--about two-thirds of the States. By the Constitution, the\r\napplicants are regarded rather as an organized body of men, seeking to\r\nidentify themselves with the American people. To such the national\r\nCongress extends the privilege of citizenship, and from such demands\r\nconformity to our method of national life.\r\n\r\nBut while these are instances of the radical difference existing between\r\nthe methods of treating the same subjects in the Articles of\r\nConfederation and in the Constitution, there are elements in the\r\nConstitution, peculiar to itself, which make the relations and duties of\r\nthe States under them utterly irreconcilable. These are embodied in the\r\norganization of the national Government. In assuming the functions, it\r\ntook upon itself the forms and instrumentalities of a sovereign and\r\nuniversal authority. Having founded the Government on the supremacy of\r\nthe people, and deposited all original power with the representative and\r\nlegislative body, the Constitution provided for the prompt and thorough\r\nexercise of that power by vesting the executive authority in the\r\nPresident of the United States, and such officers as Congress should\r\nappoint for him. In the Federation there was no executive, for there was\r\nvery little to execute. What few things it lay in the power of the\r\nassembled States to determine should be done, were given to the\r\nrespective States to do. When they were refractory or negligent, there\r\nwas no power in Congress, either to appoint other agents, or to compel\r\nthem to the performance of their duties. A promise voluntarily given,\r\nand deemed subject to voluntary violation, was the only pledge given for\r\nthe execution of mutual agreements.\r\n\r\nWere our national Government now as it was then--as the rebels maintain,\r\nand as their Northern friends would have us act as if we believed--the\r\nrebellion would indeed be a justifiable attempt to secure self-evident\r\nrights. But it is not so. Under the Constitution, an executive is\r\nappointed directly by the people, who is bound, by an oath too sacred\r\nfor any but a traitor to violate, to protect, defend, and preserve the\r\norganic law which binds us as a nation forever, and to apply and execute\r\nthe laws of Congress made in accordance therewith.\r\n\r\nAnd to these laws, which, made by the representatives of the people,\r\nembody their sovereign authority, there is given the further sanction of\r\njudicial supervision. In the Confederation there was no general and\r\npermanent standard by which decisions could be made and preserved.\r\nEverything was made to depend on the irresponsible and often conflicting\r\naction of the States, or on the unauthoritative determination of the\r\ncongressional commission. To remedy this defect, and make more complete\r\nthe national character of our present Government, a judicial power of\r\nthe United States was vested in the Supreme Court, and in such inferior\r\ncourts as Congress may establish. This Supreme Court, with original\r\njurisdiction in all cases affecting foreign nations, and in all cases in\r\nwhich a State shall be a party, and with appellate jurisdiction in other\r\ncases, is at once a final tribunal for inter-State disagreement, and a\r\nrepresentative to the world of an united nation, having an individual\r\nexistence, and capable of performing all the functions of an individual\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nWe have thus traced the main lines of difference between the Articles of\r\nConfederation and the Constitution, and have seen that the latter was\r\nmeant to be, and is the organic law of a developed and completed\r\nnationality. Under it, every one of us becomes an American citizen,\r\nexercising, as is right, certain local privileges, and dependent for\r\ntheir immediate protection on the State authorities, but possessing\r\nother wider and nobler rights, which inhere in him as a citizen of the\r\nUnited States, and which are asserted and supported by the power and\r\ndignity of the entire nation. No words can more fully express the lofty\r\nmajesty of that state of nationality on which we have entered, never,\r\nunder God, to fall from it, than those of the Constitution itself, to\r\nsupport which every member of every government, the local as well as the\r\nnational, is bound by solemn oath. 'This Constitution, and the laws of\r\nthe United States made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made under\r\nthe authority of the United States, shall be the SUPREME LAW OF THE\r\nLAND, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.'\r\n\r\nBefore such words as these, binding these States together as one nation,\r\nwhose integrity nothing but treason would seek to destroy or weaken, the\r\nfierce invective of the Southern, and the feeble sophistry of the\r\nNorthern traitor shrink to insignificance. They are at once the record\r\nand the prophecy of our success, declaring the foundation on which the\r\nGovernment is based, and pointing to yet greater glories to be attained\r\nin the superstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASON, RHYME, AND RHYTHM.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.--THE SOUL OF ART.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'In diligent toil thy master is the bee;\r\n  In craft mechanical, the worm that creeps\r\n  Through earth its dexterous way, may tutor thee;\r\n  In knowledge, couldst thou fathom all its depths,\r\n  All to the seraph are already known:\r\n  But thine, o Man, is Art--thine wholly and alone!'--SCHILLER.\r\n\r\n     'The _contemplation_ of the Divine Attributes is the source of the\r\n     highest enjoyment: their _manifestation_ is the enduring base and\r\n     unfailing spring of all true Art.'\r\n\r\nMany good and great men persist in refusing to teach, save through\r\nabstract dogmas and logical formulæ, always disagreeable to and rarely\r\ncomprehended by the masses, those high moral truths, which they are so\r\neager to imbibe when presented to them under the attractive form of art.\r\nIt is indeed impossible for man to grasp the essential truths of life\r\nthrough the understanding alone; because, created in the image of the\r\ntriune God, he can only make vital truths fully his own in the symbolic\r\nunity of his triune being. If considered only as body or sensuous\r\nperception, only as soul or heart, only as spirit or intellect--he\r\ncannot be said to live at all, since it is only in the perfect union of\r\nthe Three that his essential life is found. To make instruction really\r\navailable to him, he must be taught as God and nature always teach\r\nhim--as soul, spirit, and body. To sever them is to disintegrate the\r\nmystic core of his very being; to disregard the triune image in which he\r\nwas made. As art is symbolic of man himself, it addresses itself to his\r\nwhole being. Thus, man exists as:\r\n\r\n     Soul-Spirit-Body: to which the corresponding senses are--\r\n\r\n     Hearing-Seeing--Touching: the corresponding arts--\r\n\r\n     Music-Painting-Sculpture. Poetry is no fourth art; it but embraces\r\n     and embodies them all in its correspondent divisions of--\r\n\r\n     Rhythm-Description-Form.\r\n\r\nThe 'Body' draws its life from the world of matter made by God, by an\r\nassimilation of the elements suited to and prepared for its needs.\r\n\r\nThe 'Spirit' lives by an analogous process; but its proper food is the\r\nwisdom of God.\r\n\r\nIn a like manner lives the 'Soul;' its tender instincts are to be\r\npastured upon the love of God.\r\n\r\nOh, marvellous condescension! The Infinite deigns to be appropriated as\r\nthe source of all life and growth by the finite!\r\n\r\nIn close connection with the threefold being of man, stand the Fine\r\nArts.\r\n\r\n'Body.' Sculpture is the art of corporeal form, appealing to the eye as\r\nthe necessary medium for satisfying the corporeal sense of touch. It\r\ngratifies this sense that 'ideal beauty' should breathe through solid,\r\ntangible, and material forms. For the triune man longs for perfection in\r\nhis triune being. It should not astonish us that this art attained its\r\ngreatest perfection in the ages of classical antiquity; and that music\r\nand painting, the symbolic arts of soul and spirit, should have attained\r\ntheir highest excellence only after the advent of our sublime ideal\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\n'Spirit.' As seeing is the sense holding the closest relation with the\r\nspirit or intellect, and light is the most spiritual element of\r\nnature,--so painting, addressing itself to the spirit of man, must be\r\nregarded as the most spiritual of the arts. Classic art became romantic\r\nduring the Christian era; Christianity impressed it with an almost\r\npainful longing for the divine. Classic beauty was indeed there, but\r\nwith the expression of inadequacy to its internal consciousness,\r\noppressed with the grief of its fallen existence, and with the sadness\r\nof an infinite longing on its ethereal countenance.\r\n\r\n'Soul.' Music, addressing itself through the ear to the emotions, is the\r\nart of the longing, divining, loving soul. It never excites abstract or\r\nantagonistic thought; it unites humanity in concrete feeling. It\r\ncertainly cannot be denied that sounds address themselves immediately to\r\nthe feelings; that the tones of the voice are highly sympathetic; that\r\nthe sighs, groans, shrieks, cries of a sufferer affect us far more\r\nvividly than the mere sight of the same degree of suffering.\r\n\r\nBut though the arts seem to us to be thus divided, each art is also\r\nthreefold, and must appeal to the triune nature of man. As man only\r\ntruly lives, so he only truly creates, as a threefold being, yet his\r\n_life_ is ever one, so that soul, spirit, and body are constantly acting\r\nand reacting upon each other. When the divine wisdom shines into the\r\nspirit, it gives it the perception of intellectual truths, which truths\r\nthrow their light far into the dimmer soul; and when the divine love\r\npours into the soul, it gifts it with the almost limitless faculty of\r\nloving, which warms and quickens the colder spirit, until it germs and\r\nbuds in the lovely bloom of human charities and self-abnegating good\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention here to enter into any detailed speculations\r\nupon the hidden mysteries of our being; we simply call the attention of\r\nthe reader to the fact that there is a class of truths which must belong\r\nto the universal reason (such as mathematical axioms, syllogistic\r\nformulæ, logical deductions, etc., etc.), because they compel assent as\r\nsoon as recognized;--thus a ray of divine wisdom itself must exist in\r\nour spirits, which cannot be perverted, and which elevates the human\r\nmind to the immediate perception of impersonal, abstract, and\r\nconviction-compelling truths. We cannot deny them, even if we would! All\r\nsound logic has its power in the light proceeding from this divine ray.\r\n\r\nA ray of the divine love must also exist in the essence of the human\r\nsoul, to enable it to perform the marvels of self-abnegating devotion,\r\nof which the most humble among us frequently seem capable. Strange\r\nPromethean fire!\r\n\r\nAs it is the allotted task of every individual to form his soul into a\r\nnoble and powerful personality, to be an artist in the highest sense of\r\nthe word, since he must aid in chiselling a glorious statue from the\r\nliving block intrusted to his care,--is it not essentially necessary\r\nthat every human being should be taught to discern and love the\r\nbeautiful? And vast is the difference between the artist in the school\r\nof men and in the school of God; the first, working for and in time,\r\nmust be satisfied with leaving to his fellow men some brilliant yet\r\nperishing records of his thoughts; while the latter, working for\r\neternity, may labor forever to approach the infinite beauty set before\r\nhim as his glorious ideal of perfection!\r\n\r\nWe have already asserted that poetry is no fourth art on a line with the\r\nother three. It indeed embraces and resumes them all, with added powers\r\nof its own. It cannot, however, be denied that, employed in combination\r\nwith poetry, the other arts lose much of their special power and effect,\r\nfor thus associated they hold a subordinate station, are forced to\r\nappear in a colder medium, and are subjected to the laws of a harmony\r\nbut partially adapted to their individual interests. Undeniable as this\r\nmay be, poetry still maintains its high claims to our consideration.\r\nThough its tones be colder than those of music, since they must pass\r\nthrough the analytic intellect instead of appealing immediately to the\r\nsympathetic heart; if its hues are less vivid than, those of painting,\r\nas they must be transmitted through the slower medium of words in lieu\r\nof impressing themselves immediately upon the delighted eye; if less\r\npalpable to the corporeal sense of touch than sculpture, with its\r\nsolidity of form,--yet is its range wider, fuller, and far more\r\ncomprehensive than any one of the sister arts. If any one should be\r\ninclined to doubt that it is indeed a _resumé_ of them all, let him\r\nconsider that in its prosodial flow, measured pauses, metrical lines,\r\nvaried cadences, stirring or soothing rhythms, sweet or rugged\r\nrhymes,--it is music: in its metaphorical diction, descriptive imagery,\r\nsuccession of shifting pictures, diversified illustration, and vivid\r\ncoloring,--it is painting; while in its organic development and\r\narrangement of parts, its complicated structure, in the individualism of\r\ncharacters, and the sharply defined personalities of its dramatic\r\nrealm,--it struggles to attain the fixed and beautiful unity of\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nThe arts find their essential unity in the fact that their sole object\r\nis the manifestation of the beautiful. No one knows better than the\r\nartist that beauty is not the production, of his own limited\r\nunderstanding, but that, after having duly made his preliminary studies\r\nof the laws of the medium through which he is to manifest it, it shines\r\ninto, it reveals itself, as it were, intuitively to the divining soul.\r\nFar lower in its sphere than that infallible inspiration which speaks to\r\nus through the sacred pages of Holy Writ of the things immediately\r\npertaining to our relations with God, true artistic power must still be\r\nconsidered as inspiration, since it is constantly arriving at more than\r\nthe unassisted reason of man could command by the fullest exercise of\r\nits highest logical powers. The impassioned Romeo cries: 'Can philosophy\r\nmake a Juliet?' That philosophy has never made a Juliet in art is\r\npositively certain! Let us then reverentially enter upon an analysis of\r\nthe effect of beauty upon the human spirit, whether found in the perfect\r\nworks of our God, or shining through the more humble imitations and\r\nmanifestations of the fallible human artist.\r\n\r\nThe perception of beauty first excites a sensation of pleasure, then a\r\nfeeling of interest in the beautiful object, then a perception of\r\nkindness in a superior intelligence, from which it is at once seen it\r\nmust ultimately flow, then a feeling of grateful veneration toward that\r\nbeneficent Intelligence. Unless the perception of beauty be accompanied\r\nwith these emotions, we have no more correct idea of beauty than we can\r\nbe said to have an idea of a letter of which we perceive the fine\r\nhandwriting and fair lines, without understanding the contents. The\r\nemotions consequent upon the due perception of beauty are not given by\r\nthe senses, nor do they arise entirely from the intellect, but,\r\nproceeding from the entire man, must be accompanied by a right and open\r\nstate of the heart. A true perception and acknowledgment of beauty is\r\nthen certainly elevating; exalting and purifying the mind in accordance\r\nwith its degree. And it would indeed seem, from the lavish profusion\r\nwith which the Deity has seen fit to scatter it around us, that it was\r\nHis beneficent intention we should be constantly under its influence.\r\nNow the artist is one gifted by his Creator to discern that ineffable\r\nbeauty which is everywhere present, to live in the realm of the ideal,\r\nand to reveal it to men through words, forms, colors, sounds, and, would\r\nhe insure the salvation of his own soul, through good deeds. Thus it can\r\nbe proved that 'religion is the soul of art,' and essentially necessary\r\nto the artist, because it gives him, simultaneously, the ideas and\r\nfeelings of the Absolute, without which he must lose his way, falling\r\ninto sterile and ignoble copies of the real, like the Dutch painters,\r\nand thus be able to produce nothing but detailed and accurate copies of\r\nlow subjects, of factitious emotions, or of vulgar sensations. Without\r\nfaith, the artist prefers the body itself to the feelings which animate\r\nit--the polished limbs of a Venus to the brow of a Madonna! The\r\nintellect alone can never soar to the regions of eternal truth, to the\r\nAbsolute; it must be aided by the heart in its daring flight. Faith and\r\nlove are the snowy and glittering wings of true artistic excellence.\r\nWhen the soul is full of the bliss of beauty, the feeling of its\r\nhappiness urges the artist on to the necessity of imparting it,--while\r\nhis heart is wrapt in the vision of the Absolute, he would fain build\r\nfor his joyous thoughts an eternal abode with his fellow men, that they\r\ntoo might see the steppings of the All Fair, and so be cheered and\r\nstimulated in these their gloomy days of evil.\r\n\r\nThus it cannot be denied that religion alone gives depth and sublimity\r\nto the creations of art, because it alone gives faith and hope in the\r\nInfinite. If we are often astonished to see the springs of artistic\r\ninspiration so rapidly exhausted in many men of genius of our own epoch,\r\nit is because of their overwhelming egotism and limited subjectivity,\r\nbecause the worship of the finite replaces that of the infinite, because\r\nreligion has become for them a mere memory of childhood. To recover\r\ntheir blighted fertility of imagination, they must again become as\r\nlittle children, again betake themselves to the shady and lonely way\r\nleading to the temple of God.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this position, we constantly find that men gifted,\r\nsensuously, with acute perceptions of the beautiful, yet who do not\r\nreceive it with a pure heart, never comprehend it aright; but making it\r\na mere minister to their desires, a mere seasoning of sensual pleasures,\r\nsink until all their creations take the same earthly stamp, and it is\r\nseen and felt that the heavenly sense of beauty has been degraded into a\r\nservant of lust. But as the spirit of prophecy consisted with the\r\navarice of Balaam and the disobedience of Saul, so God knows all the\r\nstops of the heaven-gifted but self-corrupted artists, and, in spite of\r\nthemselves, has often made them discourse high harmonies, and give the\r\nmost eloquent and earnest enunciations of the very sentiments and\r\nprinciples in which their own condemnation could be found clearly and\r\nvividly written. The good seed, although divine, if there be no blessing\r\nupon it, may indeed bring forth wild grapes, but these grapes are well\r\ndiscerned, for there is, in the works of bad men, a taint, stain, and\r\njarring discord, blacker and louder exactly in proportion to their moral\r\ndeficiency. At best it is no part of our duty to examine into and\r\npronounce upon the frail characters of men, but rather to hold fast to\r\nthat which we can prove good, and feel to be ordained for our own\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nIt can, moreover, be fully proved that the artists, as a class, have\r\nnever been false to religion. From the poets of the dark ages sprang a\r\nliterature strange and marvellous, but full of naive faith, and bearing\r\nstriking witness to the activity of the human spirit even in those dim\r\ncenturies: I mean the literature of 'visions and legends.' And to\r\nestimate the importance of these consolatory creations aright, we must\r\nremember how precarious and miserable life then was, passed in constant\r\nprivation and poverty, menaced with increasing perils; and then consider\r\nthe fact that these legends kept constantly before the mind of the\r\noppressed people the consoling idea of a superintending Providence, who\r\nnumbers all our tears and hears our lightest sighs. The legend indeed\r\nnever confined itself wholly to this earth as the theatre of its wild\r\ndrama; immortality was always its groundwork, and its last scene always\r\nopened in the invisible world, where the saints were surrounded with\r\nundying halos of glory, and from whence they watched over men with\r\nincreasing love, while in their midst reigned a gentle figure full of\r\ngrace and majesty, uniting, in a mysterious and ineffable manner, the\r\nholy virginity and sacred maternity of woman; a gentle, humble being,\r\nthrough whose innocent meekness the two worlds, finite and infinite, had\r\nbeen forever linked in the person of the infant God, whom she forever\r\nbore upon her virgin bosom. What a tender lesson for barbaric life!\r\n\r\nWe must also remember that these legends were eminently popular, that\r\nthey passed from mouth to mouth round the winter hearth, teaching the\r\nyoung and soothing the children, like the cradle song of a mother,\r\npouring hope into the cell of the captive, teaching the virtuous\r\noppressed that a just God mercifully listened to all their secret sighs,\r\nand, leading the poor to look beyond the squalid poverty which\r\nsurrounded them, pointed to them the legions of angels, which were\r\nlovingly camped around them. It is impossible to overestimate the\r\nblessed effects of such a literature, or to count the naive hearts which\r\nit may have rescued from suicide and despair!\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the literature of the middle ages culminates in the\r\nChristian poet, Dante. History, theology, politics, paganism, sweet and\r\nmelancholy elegies, flashes of fiery indignation, all men and all\r\ngenerations, meet in his majestic epic. Yet the closest unity is\r\npreserved through this astonishing range of subjects; one sublime idea\r\nbroods over its every line,--the idea of a God of perfect justice--of\r\nundying love!\r\n\r\nWe cite, in corroboration, the following lines from this noble poet,\r\nthough a prose translation can do but little justice to the glowing\r\noriginal:\r\n\r\n     'God is One in substance; Power, Wisdom, and Love assume in Him a\r\n     triple Personality, so that in all tongues singular and plural are\r\n     alike applicable to Him. He is spirit; he is the circle which\r\n     circumscribes everything and which nothing ever circumscribes;\r\n     immense, eternal, immutable, He is the Primal out of which all is\r\n     darkness. Unlimited by time, without laws save in His own will, in\r\n     the bosom of eternity, He, who is three in One, acts;--Power\r\n     executes what Wisdom proposes, and Infinite Love is forever germing\r\n     into ever new loves. Like a triple arrow from a single bow, from\r\n     the depths of the Productive thought, spring, whether single or\r\n     united, matter, form, with the living heart of all finite\r\n     beings--their own governing laws. Created things are but the\r\n     splendor of the immutable ideas which the Father engenders, and\r\n     which He loves unceasingly. Ideas--thoughts--sacred words! Light,\r\n     which, without being detached from Him who wills it into being,\r\n     shines from creature to creature, from cause to effect,\r\n     on--on--until it produces only contingent and transitory phenomena;\r\n     Light which, repeated and reflected from mirror to mirror, pales as\r\n     its distance increases from its Holy Source.'\r\n\r\nThat would surely be an interesting work which would glean for us the\r\nmultiplied expressions of the faith of the 'laurel-crowned,' who have\r\nleft their consoling records for humanity, their tracks of light over\r\nthe dark earth-bosom in which they sleep. But this is not place for such\r\nresearches; we must confine ourselves to but few quotations, designed to\r\nshow that religion is the soul of art.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this we might quote the whole of the fine tragedy of\r\nPolyeucte; it is full of ardent religious feeling. The moral is indeed\r\ncondensed in the following lines:\r\n\r\n  'If, to die for our king is a glorious destiny,--\r\n  How sublime is death when we may die for God!'\r\n\r\nUrged by that unconquerable love of the Absolute which possesses all\r\ntrue poets, Racine seeks in God alone the source of all regal power:\r\n\r\n  'The eternal is his name, the world is his work,\r\n  He hears the sighs of the oppressed;\r\n  He judges all mortals with equal justice,\r\n  From the height of his throne he calls kings to account.'\r\n\r\nOur English poet Shakspeare, whose works are full of sublime morality,\r\nputs into the mouth of one of his matchless heroines the following\r\nexquisite passage, recalling to us the lessons of the New Testament:\r\n\r\n           'Alas! alas!\r\n  Why all the souls that are, were forfeit once,\r\n  And He that might the advantage best have took\r\n  Found out the remedy: how would you be,\r\n  If He, who is the top of judgment, should\r\n  But judge you as you are? In the strict course\r\n  Of justice none of us should see salvation:\r\n  We do pray for mercy; that same prayer\r\n  Should teach us all to render deeds of mercy.'\r\n\r\nKlopstock, the German poet, sings only of God, not in the creation\r\nalone, the last judgment, in his august and dreadful majesty, but in the\r\nwonders of His tender love:\r\n\r\n     'I trust in thee, Divine Mediator! I have chanted the canticle of\r\n     the new covenant; my race is run; Thou hast pardoned my tottering\r\n     steps! Sound! sound, quivering strings of my lyre! My heart is full\r\n     of the bliss of gratitude to my God! What recompense could I ask? I\r\n     have tasted the cup of angels in singing of my Redeemer!'\r\n\r\nNot less devout than the 'Messiah,' but far more beautiful, is Tasso's\r\nexquisite 'Jerusalem Delivered.'\r\n\r\nA complete system of theology may be found in the majestic pages of\r\nMilton's sublime 'Paradise Lost.'\r\n\r\nThat which with the heathen poets was but an episode, the religious\r\nelement of the poem, as the 'Descent into Hades,' the 'Wanderings\r\nthrough Elysium,' etc., etc., ends by absorbing the entire work after\r\nthe advent of Christianity. The 'Divine Comedy,' the 'Paradise Lost,'\r\nand the 'Messiah,' form a magnificent Christian trilogy, of which the\r\nscene is almost always in a supernatural sphere, and in which the\r\nprincipal actor is--the Providence of God.\r\n\r\nOn this subject we have no further time to dilate, and the reader may\r\neasily verify its truth for himself. If he would convince himself that\r\nthe deepest draughts of inspiration have ever been drawn by the highest\r\nartists from religious ideas, let him add to the names above given,\r\nthose of Fra Angelico, Fra Bartolomeo, Tintoret, Corregio, Murillo,\r\nRaphael, Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo, and, in our own days,\r\nOverbeck; let him gaze into that divine face of godlike sorrow given us\r\nby an untaught monk, Antonio Pesenti, in his marvellous crucifix of\r\nivory, let him listen to the pure ethereal strains of Palestrina,\r\nPergolese, Marcello, Stradella, and Cherubini, and thus be assured that\r\nreligion, the love of the Infinite, is the 'Soul of Art.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUCCANEERS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most terrible name, perhaps, in the juvenile literature of England\r\nand English America, during the last century and a half, has been that\r\nof WILLIAM KIDD, the pirate. In the nursery legend, in story,\r\nand in song, the name of Kidd has stood forth as the boldest and\r\nbloodiest of buccaneers. The terror of the ocean when abroad, he\r\nreturned from his successive voyages to line our coasts with silver and\r\ngold, and to renew with the devil a league, cemented with the blood of\r\nvictims shot down whenever fresh returns of the precious metals were to\r\nbe hidden. According to the superstitious of Connecticut and Long\r\nIsland, it was owing to these bloody charms that honest money-diggers\r\nhave ever experienced so much difficulty in removing these buried\r\ntreasures. Often, indeed, have the lids of the iron chests rung beneath\r\nthe mattock of the stealthy midnight searcher for gold; but the flashes\r\nof sulphurous fires, blue and red, and the saucer eyes and chattering\r\nteeth of legions of demons have uniformly interposed to frighten the\r\ndelvers from their posts, and preserve the treasures from their greedy\r\nclutches. But notwithstanding the harrowing sensations connected with\r\nthe name of Kidd, and his renown as a pirate, he was but one of the last\r\nand most inconsiderable of that mighty race of sea robbers who, during a\r\nlong series of years in the seventeenth century, were the admiration of\r\nthe world for their prowess, and its terror for their crimes.\r\n\r\nThe community of buccaneers was first organized upon the small island of\r\nTortuga, situated on the north side of St. Domingo, at the distance of\r\nabout two leagues from the latter. It was upon this island that the\r\nfirst European colony was planted in the New World, in the year and\r\nmonth of its discovery. But although the colony became considerable, and\r\nflourished so long as the natives remained in sufficient numbers to\r\ncultivate the plantations of the Spaniards, yet it did not take vigorous\r\nroot. The numbers of the natives were greatly reduced by the arms of\r\ntheir conquerors, and were afterward still more rapidly diminished by\r\noppression; and although an attempt was made to supply their places by a\r\nforced importation of forty thousand Indians from the Bahamas, the\r\nexperiment was of little avail. In less than half a century, the\r\naboriginal race was extinct. The country was beautiful beyond\r\ndescription: rich in its mines, and its soil of unexceeded fertility.\r\nBut the Spaniard, if not by nature indolent, is prone to luxury. The\r\nearth producing by handfuls, the colonists saw little necessity of\r\nlaborious exertion. They accordingly degenerated from the spirit and\r\nenterprise of their ancestors, and fell into habits of voluptuous\r\nidleness. Agriculture was neglected, and the mines deserted. Contenting\r\nthemselves with a bare supply of the wants of nature, they sank into\r\nsuch a state of indolence, that many of their slaves had no other\r\nemployment than to swing them in their hammocks the livelong day. No\r\ncolony could nourish composed of such a people. During the first half\r\ncentury of its existence, it had indeed become considerable; but for a\r\ncentury afterward it dwindled away, neglected and apparently forgotten\r\nby the parent country, until even the remembrance of its former\r\ngreatness was lost.\r\n\r\nAt length, about the middle of the seventeenth century, the Spaniards\r\nwere roused from their repose. So early as the year 1630, the severity\r\nof the French colonial system had driven many of the most resolute of\r\nthe colonists from the islands belonging to that nation, especially from\r\nSt. Christopher's. Numbers of these men, in order to an unrestrained\r\nenjoyment of liberty, took refuge in the western division of St.\r\nDomingo, supporting themselves with game, and by hunting wild cattle,\r\nfor which they continued to find a market, either in the Spanish\r\nsettlements, or by trading with vessels visiting the western coast for\r\nthat object. Meanwhile the exactions upon the colonists of St.\r\nChristopher's and the submission required of them to exclusive\r\nprivileges, induced a further and greater number to abandon the island,\r\nand join the adventures of their own countrymen in the forests of St.\r\nDomingo. Those adventurers--many of whom had already been roaming the\r\nSt. Domingo forest for nearly half a century, increasing in numbers by\r\naccessions from time to time--had, in 1630, established a social and\r\npolitical system of their own, peculiar to their own community. Their\r\noriginal calling was the hunting of wild boars and cattle, which\r\nabounded in the island. To this was added, to a small extent, the\r\nbusiness of planting, and to this again the more adventurous profession\r\nof sea-roving and piracy. Their vessels were at first nothing larger\r\nthan boats, or rather canoes, constructed from the trunks of\r\ntrees--excavations after the manner of the ordinary light canoes of our\r\nown aboriginals. But from the size of some descriptions of trees growing\r\nin that climate, these canoes were capable of carrying crews of from\r\nthirty to fifty and seventy-five men, with the necessary supplies for\r\nshort voyages among the Antilles. As they had no women among them, nor\r\nother consequent responsibilities, it was their custom to associate in\r\npartnerships of two, called comrades, who lived together, and assisted\r\neach other in the chase and in the domestic duties of their huts or\r\ncabins. Their goods were thrown into common stock; and when one of a\r\npartnership died, the survivor became the absolute heir of the joint\r\nstock--unless the deceased, by previous stipulation, bequeathed his\r\ngoods to his relatives, perchance a wife and children in another land.\r\nThey were frequently absent from their lodges on their hunting\r\nexcursions for twelve months and two years at a time; but their lodges\r\nwith their goods were left in perfect safety, for the crime of theft was\r\nunknown among them.\r\n\r\nDifferences seldom arose among them, and when they did occur, they were\r\nusually adjusted without much difficulty. In obstinate and aggravated\r\ncases, however, their disputes were decided by firearms, in the use of\r\nwhich the nicest principles of fairness and honor were observed. A ball\r\nentering the back or the side of a party, afforded evidence that he had\r\nfallen by treachery, and the assassin was immediately put to death. The\r\nformer laws of their own country were disregarded; and by the usual sea\r\nbaptism received in passing the tropic, they considered themselves\r\nexpatriated from their native land, and at liberty to change their\r\nfamily names, which many of them did--borrowing terms from the character\r\nof the profession which they had chosen, as suited their fancy. Their\r\ndress was a shirt and drawers dipped in the blood of the animals they\r\nkilled, shoes without stockings, a leathern girdle by which their knife\r\nand a short sabre were suspended, and a hat or cap without a brim. Their\r\ncommon food was the choicest pieces of bullock's flesh, seasoned with\r\norange juice and pimento, and cured by smoke; of bread they lost the\r\nuse, and, until the trade of piracy was adopted, water was their only\r\ndrink. The term _buccaneers_, by which the hunters were first known, was\r\nderived from a tribe of the Caribs, who were called thus from the manner\r\nin which they prepared meats for their food, whether flesh of beasts or\r\nof men. For this purpose they constructed a sort of grate or hurdle,\r\nconsisting of twenty bars of Brazil wood, laid crosswise half a foot\r\nfrom each other, upon which the flesh of prisoners of war or of game was\r\nlaid in pieces, and a thick smoke raised beneath from properly selected\r\ncombustibles, which gave to the meat the vermil color and a delightful\r\nsmell. These fixtures, thus adjusted, were called _buccans_, and the\r\nprocess of curing the meat _buccaning_. The hunters, having adopted this\r\nprocess from the savages, were like them called _buccaneers_. In process\r\nof time the name was applied to the sea robbers as well as to the\r\nhunters; and when piracy became the general profession as a substitute\r\nfor planting and the chase, all were called buccaneers indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the great and sudden augmentation of their forces, by the\r\nimmigration from St. Christopher's about the year 1660, the buccaneers\r\nhad taken possession of Tortuga, the geographical position and character\r\nof which island was well suited to their commercial and piratical\r\npurposes. This little island had been occupied by a few Spaniards as\r\nearly as 1591; but their numbers were so small as not to interfere with\r\nthe object of the buccaneers, while its rocky conformation afforded\r\npeculiar facilities for defence in the event of attack.\r\n\r\nThe greatly increasing numbers of the buccaneers at length aroused the\r\ncolonial voluptuaries of Spain to a sense of their danger. It was\r\nperceived that while the colonists were dwindling away, the outlaws were\r\nbecoming so formidable in their numbers that they soon might be enabled\r\nto contest for the mastery of the island of Hispaniola itself. They\r\ntherefore commenced a war upon them, and not being able to prosecute it\r\nwith sufficient vigor themselves, they called to their aid troops from\r\nthe other Spanish islands, and also from the continent. With these\r\nauxiliaries the barbarians were hunted with great severity, and many of\r\nthem massacred. Finding themselves pursued in this manner, the outlaws\r\nbanded together for mutual defence. Their avocations required them often\r\nto separate in the daytime; but they assembled in considerable numbers\r\nat night; and if individuals were missing, diligent search was made\r\nuntil their fate was ascertained. If he returned from an extended chase,\r\nit was well. If not--if it was discovered that he had fallen a victim to\r\nthe Spaniards, or had been taken prisoner--his loss was requited with\r\nterrible vengeance. Everything Spanish was devoted to destruction,\r\nwithout distinction of age or sex. But in this partisan warfare, the\r\nbuccaneers maintained a decided advantage. When too hotly pressed, they\r\ncould fly to their canoes or hoys, as they were called, and escape to\r\nTortuga; and if the Spaniards pursued them thither in numbers too\r\npowerful for an open combat, they would return back again to their\r\nprincipal island. Despairing at length of success in this mode of\r\nwarfare, the Spaniards resolved to conquer the ruffians by destroying\r\ntheir means of subsistence. For this purpose, by a general hunt over the\r\nwhole island, the wild bulls were killed, and the droves of cattle\r\npreviously roaming the forests were consequently reduced so rapidly that\r\nthe buccaneers found it necessary to change their employment--to form\r\nsettlements and cultivate the lands. More than two thousand of them\r\nclustered upon Tortuga, where the business of cultivating sugar and\r\ntobacco was begun; but the more general and lucrative employment became\r\nthat of piracy. They had as yet no larger craft than the boats and\r\ncanoes already mentioned, but with these they managed to navigate the\r\nWest India seas, shooting into secure places of refuge among the smaller\r\nislands, or keys, at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe community had now become so large, in 1660, that something like\r\norder and government was seen to be necessary even by the buccaneers\r\nthemselves; and they accordingly sent to the Governor of St.\r\nChristopher's for a governor. The boon was readily granted, and M. le\r\nPasseur was commissioned to that office. He repaired promptly to Tortuga\r\nwith a ship of armed men and stores; assumed the command, and\r\nimmediately commenced fortifying the island--a work to which nature had\r\nlargely contributed by the peculiar conformation of some of the rock\r\nprecipices. There was upon one high rock, inaccessible at all points\r\nsave by ladders, a cavern large enough for a garrison of a thousand men,\r\nwith an abundant spring gushing from the rocks. This post was seized and\r\nprovisioned. Twice the Spaniards invaded them from Hispaniola, but were\r\nrepulsed--the last time with terrible slaughter. The invaders were eight\r\nhundred in number. They had seized a yet higher point of rock than the\r\nnatural fortress occupied by the buccaneers, upon which they were\r\nendeavoring to plant their cannon, in order the better to dislodge the\r\nenemy. The time chosen for the invasion was when a large number of the\r\nfreebooters were at sea. These, however, returning suddenly by night,\r\nclimbed the mountain upon the heels of the Spaniards, and attacked them\r\nwith such fury as to compel them by hundreds to throw themselves from\r\nthe rocky parapets into the valley beneath, by which their bodies were\r\ndashed in pieces. Those who were not killed by the fall were put to the\r\nsword; and few or none returned to rehearse the bloody story.\r\n\r\nThis ill-starred expedition was the last sent from St. Domingo against\r\nthe buccaneers, who thenceforward became the masters and lord\r\nproprietaries of Tortuga. Nor were the buccaneers longer exclusively\r\ncomposed of adventurous Frenchmen. Visions of golden cities in the New\r\nWorld had been flitting before the eyes of the English for a century\r\nbefore, and had not even been eclipsed by the signal failures of Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. Indeed the\r\nexpeditions of the gallant knight, however bootless to himself, may have\r\nserved to stimulate the cupidity of his countrymen for a long time\r\nafterward, inasmuch as some of Sir Walter's officers testified that they\r\nactually approached within sight of the golden city. Sir Walter's great\r\ncontemporary, Sir Francis Drake, after committing many depredations upon\r\nthe Spanish American coast, had returned to England with a vast amount\r\nof treasure. The expeditions both of Sir Francis and Sir Walter were of\r\na character bordering closely upon piratical; and in that romantic age,\r\nit was not considered as greatly transcending their examples for daring\r\nspirits to seek their fortunes in the New World, even by associating\r\nthemselves with the buccaneers of Tortuga. Be this, however, as it may,\r\nEngland and Holland and other European states respectively furnished\r\nmany reckless and daring recruits to the army of freebooters; and their\r\npiracies increased with their numbers. Ostensibly they directed their\r\noperations only against the commerce of Spain, with whom they were\r\ndirectly at war, and whose galleons from the continent, freighted with\r\nthe produce of the mines, offered golden incentives to bravery. But\r\nhowever virtuous in this respect might have been the intentions of the\r\nsea robbers, it was not invariably the merchantmen of Spain which\r\nsuffered from their depredations, since from 'an imperfection, in the\r\norgans of vision,' or from some other cause 'they were not always able\r\nto distinguish the flags of different nations.' Others than the\r\nSpaniards, were consequently occasional sufferers; and a ready market\r\nwas found for their plunder in the French, and English islands,\r\nespecially in Jamaica, which England had conquered from Spain in 1655.\r\nThis latter island was in fact their principal depot; for although the\r\nBritish Government, both under the Protectorate and afterward, had\r\nendeavored to direct the attention of the Jamaica colonists to\r\nagricultural pursuits, they had entirely failed, for the reason that the\r\nbuccaneers, making it their principal resort, poured in such vast\r\ntreasures, that the inhabitants amassed considerable wealth with little\r\ndifficulty, and despised the more honest occupations of honest labor.\r\nThe population rapidly increased, and in a few years amounted to twenty\r\nthousand, whose only source of subsistence was derived from the\r\nbuccaneers.\r\n\r\nHitherto France had disclaimed as her subjects the roving cattle-hunters\r\nupon the island of Hispaniola; but after they had formed settlements and\r\nestablished themselves so firmly upon Tortuga, the French West India\r\ncompany took them under the ægis of the lilies for protection; and M.\r\nOgeron, 'a man of probity and understanding,' was sent from the parent\r\ncountry to govern them. With the arrival of the new governor the\r\ndomestic relations of the buccaneers underwent a material change, for\r\nthe former brought many women with him--fit persons, from the past\r\nprofligacy of their lives, to consort with the inhabitants of Tortuga.\r\nBut the buccaneers were not fastidious in the selection of wives, and\r\nhistory gives us no right to suppose that there was a single forlorn\r\ndamsel left without a husband. 'I ask nothing of your past life,' would\r\nthe buccaneer say to the fair one to whom he proposed himself. 'If\r\nanybody would have had you where you came from, you would not have come\r\nhere. But as you did not belong to me then, whatever you may have done\r\nwas no disgrace to me. Give me your word for the future, and I will\r\nacquit you for the past.' Then striking his gun barrel, he would add,\r\n'Shouldst thou prove false to me, this will not.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the buccaneers, becoming stronger and stronger every day,\r\nextended their designs, and pushed their operations with a degree of\r\naudacity and success that rendered them the terror of the seas. As yet\r\ntheir marine consisted only of boats and canoes, but these were, as\r\nbefore stated, of a size to carry from fifty to a hundred men each. They\r\nattacked not only merchantmen, but vessels of war, with a degree of\r\nintrepidity unexampled in the history of man. No matter for the size of\r\na ship, or for her armament. They paused not to calculate chances. Their\r\ninvariable practice was to carry their prizes by boarding. Their boats\r\nwere propelled with the swiftness of an arrow. As certain as they\r\ngrappled with a vessel, she was sure to be taken; for their onslaughts\r\nwere desperately furious and irresistible. The Spanish Government\r\ncomplained bitterly, both to England and France, of the outrages upon\r\nher commerce by the pirates, a large majority of whom were the born\r\nsubjects of those nations. The answers, however, of both were the same:\r\nthat those piratical acts were not committed by the buccaneers as their\r\nsubjects; and the Spanish ambassador was informed that his master might\r\nproceed against them as he saw fit. In consequence of the transactions\r\nof the buccaneers with the people of Jamaica, England went farther, and\r\nactually removed the governor of that colony. But, whether with the\r\nconnivance of the civil authorities or not, the intercourse between the\r\npirates and the people continued without serious interruption. Some of\r\nthe buccaneers, however, pretended to hold commissions both from the\r\nFrench and the Dutch; but it was mere pretext. Their authority was in\r\ntruth nothing more than what the sailors are wont jocosely to call 'a\r\ncommission from the Pope.' Yet they affected to consider themselves in\r\nlawful war against Spain, for the reason that the Spaniards had debarred\r\nthem from the privileges of hunting in the forests and fishing in the\r\nwaters of St. Domingo--thus depriving them of the exercise of what they\r\ncalled their lawful rights. In regard to the cruelties which they\r\nfrequently inflicted upon the prisoners who fell into their hands, they\r\npleaded in justification those enormities which the conquerors of\r\nSpanish America inflicted upon the aborigines there. The horrible\r\ncruelties of Cortez and Pizarro are familiar to every student of\r\nhistory. 'I once,' says Las Casas, speaking of the conquest of the New\r\nWorld, 'beheld four or five chief Indians roasted alive at a slow fire;\r\nand as the miserable victims poured forth their dreadful yells, it\r\ndisturbed the commandant in his siesta, and he sent an order that they\r\nshould be strangled; but the officer on duty would not do it, but,\r\ncausing their mouths to be gagged that their shrieks might not be heard,\r\nhe stirred up the fire with his own hands, and roasted them deliberately\r\nuntil they all expired.' The conquerors had resorted to these dreadful\r\nexecutions under the cloak of religious zeal, but in reality to make the\r\npoor wretches disclose the secret depositories of their treasures.\r\nInstances of the same refined cruelty, at the contemplation of which\r\nhumanity shudders, marked the history of the buccaneers. Their motives\r\nwere the same as those which had governed the conduct of Cortez; and\r\nthey, too, found a salvo for their consciences by persuading themselves\r\nthat they were commissioned as a court of vengeance--the instruments of\r\nretributive justice in the hands of Providence--to punish the Spaniards\r\nfor the remorseless cruelties practised upon the unoffending Mexicans.\r\nAnd here another extraordinary fact may be noted in the history of the\r\nbuccaneers. After their community had become consolidated and their\r\ngovernment in a manner systematized, strange as it may seem,\r\nnotwithstanding their murderous profession the observances of the\r\nChristian, religion were introduced to sanctify their atrocities. 'They\r\nnever partook of a repast without solemnly acknowledging their\r\ndependence upon the Giver of all good.' In their infatuation, whenever\r\nthey embarked upon any expedition, they were wont to invoke for its\r\nsuccess the blessing of Heaven; and they never returned from a marauding\r\nexcursion that they did not return thanks to God for their victory. 'On\r\nthe appearance of a ship which they meant to attack, they offered up a\r\nfervent prayer for success; and when the conflict had terminated in\r\ntheir favor, their first care was to express their gratitude to the God\r\nof battles for the victory which He had enabled them to gain.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first leader of the buccaneers, after their concentration upon\r\nTortuga, whose deeds of desperate valor 'damned him to everlasting\r\nfame,' was PIÉRRE LE GRANDE, a native of Dieppe, in Normandy.\r\nThe crowning act of his piratical career was his taking the ship of the\r\nvice admiral, convoying a fleet of Spanish galleons, near the Cape of\r\nTiburon, on the western side of St. Domingo--an act which was performed\r\nwith a single boat, manned by only eighteen men, and armed with no more\r\nthan four small pieces of ordnance. And even these latter were of no\r\nuse, as the admiral's ship was carried by boarding, with no other arms\r\nthan swords and pistols. Le Grande had been so long at sea, without\r\nfalling in with any craft worth capturing, that his provisions were\r\nbecoming short; and his crew, pressed with hunger and brooding over\r\ntheir ill success, were desperate. Thus situated, they espied the\r\nSpaniard bearing the vice admiral's flag, and separated from the rest of\r\nthe flotilla. Notwithstanding the immense disparity of force, Le Grande\r\ndetermined to capture her, and his crew took an oath to stand by him\r\ntill the last. The boat of the pirates was descried by the Spaniard in\r\nthe afternoon, and the admiral was admonished of what might be its\r\ncharacter; but he scorned the admonition, viewing the apparently pitiful\r\ncraft with contempt, and adopting no precautions against it. Just in the\r\ndusk of evening the pirates ran alongside of his ship. As already\r\nremarked, the crew of Le Grande had sworn to stand by their captain; but\r\nin order to cut off all means of escape in the event of defeat, and\r\ntherefore to make them fight with greater desperation, their chief, at\r\nthe moment they were climbing the sides of the ship, caused the boat to\r\nbe suddenly scuttled, and sunk. Indeed the boarding of the Spaniard was\r\nhastened by the necessity of leaping from their own vessel, already\r\nsinking beneath them. Under these circumstances, the boarding was so\r\nrapid, that the Spaniards were completely taken by surprise; so much so\r\nthat as the pirates rushed into the great cabin, they found the captain,\r\nwith several boon companions, engaged at a game of cards. Exclaiming\r\nthat his assailants must be devils, the commander, with a pistol at his\r\nbreast, was compelled to an immediate surrender. Meanwhile a portion of\r\nthe assailants took possession of the gunroom; seized the arms, and\r\nkilled all who resisted. This vigorous assault soon carried the ship by\r\na surrender at discretion. She proved to be a rich prize; and the\r\nprisoners were treated with lenity, which was not always the course\r\nadopted by the buccaneers when they were disappointed in the amount of\r\ntheir expected plunder. Many were the crews compelled to pay with their\r\nlives for the poverty of their cargoes. In the present case Le Grande\r\nretained for his own service such of the common sailors as he needed,\r\nand after setting the rest on shore, proceeded to France with his\r\nprize, where he remained, without ever returning to America.\r\n\r\nThe success of this exploit, and the rich reward by which it was\r\ncrowned, at once stimulated the cupidity of the Tortugans, and fired\r\ntheir breasts with the ambition of emulating the bravery of the Great\r\nPeter. Those who were yet engaged in planting or in other honest\r\noccupations, at once abandoned them, and betook themselves to the more\r\ninviting trade of piracy. Being unable to build larger vessels than the\r\nboats or hoys then in use, they carried on the war in these against the\r\nsmaller vessels of Spain engaged in the coasting trade and in the\r\ntraffic of hides and tobacco with the inhabitants of Jamaica. The\r\nvessels thus captured were substituted for their own smaller craft, by\r\nmeans of which they were soon enabled to make longer voyages, and\r\nstretch across to the coasts of the Spanish main. At Campeachy and other\r\npoints they found many trading vessels, and often ships of great burden.\r\nTwo of these commercial vessels they captured, and also two large armed\r\nships, all laden with plate, within the port of Campeachy, which they\r\nboldly entered for that purpose, and sailed with them in triumph to\r\nTortuga. Such rich returns greatly augmented the wealth of the island;\r\nand every additional capture enabled them to increase their marine,\r\nuntil at the end of two years from the last achievement of Piérre Le\r\nGrande, the pirates had a navy, very well manned and equipped, of more\r\nthan twenty ships of different sizes. With such a force, composed of men\r\nof the most desperate fortunes and dauntless courage, the commerce of\r\nSpain with her colonies in Central and South America was in a few years\r\nalmost entirely destroyed. The ships bound from Europe for the colonies\r\nwere rarely molested by the pirates, who chose to fall upon them when\r\nladen with the precious metals, which Spain, in her avarice, was\r\ntransporting home--not foreseeing that by that very process she was\r\ngradually working her own national ruin. Sometimes a fleet of galleons,\r\nwhen under strong convoy, succeeded in the return voyage; but a single\r\nship, of whatever strength or force, seldom escaped the vigilance of the\r\npirates. They followed such fleets as they judged it unsafe to attack,\r\nand a slow sailer or a straggler was inevitably captured. So daring were\r\nthese robbers, that even before they were enabled to obtain a smaller\r\ncraft, a crew of fifty-five of them in one of the large canoes sailed\r\ninto the Southern Ocean, and proceeded along the coast of the continent\r\nas far north as California. On their return, they entered one of the\r\nports of Peru, and captured a ship, the cargo of which was valued at\r\nseveral millions. Their canoe was then exchanged for the noble prize, in\r\nwhich they returned in triumph.\r\n\r\nPreparations for their expeditions were made with the utmost care, and\r\narticles of agreement were always carefully written out and signed; and\r\nthe dealings of the robbers among each other were usually characterized\r\nby the most scrupulous honor. In regard to their provisions, the rations\r\nwere distributed twice a day--the officers, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, faring no better than the common sailor. It was stipulated\r\nexactly what sums of money or what proportionate sums each person\r\nengaged in a voyage should receive, with the understanding, of course,\r\n_no prey_, _no pay_. The commanders of the ships were frequently the\r\nowners. Sometimes they belonged to a company of adventurers on board. In\r\nother instances they were chartered for the service of individuals or\r\ncompanies on shore. The first stipulation, therefore, on arranging for a\r\nvoyage, regarded the compensation to be received by the owner or owners\r\nof the ship, being ordinarily one third of the products of the cruise.\r\nIf the boat or vessel in which an enterprise was first undertaken was\r\nthe common property of the crew, the first vessel captured was allotted\r\nto the captain, with one share of the booty obtained. In cases where the\r\ncaptain owned and fitted out the original vessel, the first ship taken\r\nbelonged to him, with a double share of the plunder. The surgeon was\r\nallowed two hundred crowns for his medicine chest, and a single share of\r\nthe prizes; and whoever had the good fortune to descry a ship that was\r\ncaptured, received a reward of a hundred crowns. A tariff of\r\ncompensation for the wounded was also adjusted according to the greater\r\nor less severity of the wounds they might receive. For example, the\r\ncompensation for the loss of a right arm was six hundred pieces of\r\neight, or six slaves as an equivalent; for a left arm, five hundred\r\npieces of eight, or five slaves; for the loss of a right leg, five\r\nhundred pieces, or five slaves; for an eye, one hundred pieces, or one\r\nslave; for the loss of a finger, the same. Claims of this character were\r\nfirst paid at the close of a voyage, from the common stock of the prize\r\nmoney. The commander of an expedition was allotted five portions of a\r\ncommon seaman; and the subordinate officers shared in proportion to\r\ntheir rank. The residue of the booty was then divided with exact\r\nequality among the crews, from the highest to the lowest mariner, not\r\nexcepting the boys. Some of the duties of these latter were peculiar.\r\nFor instance, when the pirates had captured a vessel better than their\r\nown, they transferred themselves to it, leaving the boys to escape from\r\nthe deserted vessel last, after having set it on fire. Favor never had\r\nany influence in the distribution of the booty, which was rigidly\r\ndecided by lot--lots being drawn for the dead as well as for the living.\r\nThe portions for the dead were given to their surviving companion; or if\r\nthe companion had also been killed, the allotment was sent to the family\r\nof the deceased. If they had no families, then the money or plate or\r\nother goods that would have belonged to them was distributed to the\r\npoor, or piously bestowed on churches, which were to pray for the souls\r\nof those in whose names the benefactions were given. These allowances to\r\nthe dead and wounded were considered debts of honor--such as the brokers\r\nof Wall street would note as 'confidential.' Their intercourse with each\r\nother was marked with civility and kindness. They, of course, squandered\r\ntheir money on coming ashore, in all manner of dissipation, and with the\r\nrecklessness which has ever characterized the sailor. To those who were\r\nin want they would contribute freely; and the kind offices of humanity\r\namong each other were readily interchanged. In ordinary cases, their\r\nprisoners were liberated, save those who were needed for their own\r\nassistance; and these were generally discharged after two or three\r\nyears. Whenever they were in want of supplies, they landed upon the\r\nislands and levied exactions upon the people--planters and fishermen.\r\nThe green turtles, however, among the Florida Keys, supplied a large\r\nportion of their food; and it is presumed that they became as great\r\nadepts in the turtle line as the corporation pirates of modern times.\r\n\r\nSo extensively was the commerce of Spain in these seas, under her own\r\nflag, cut up, notwithstanding the ships of war repeatedly sent for its\r\nprotection, that foreign flags were resorted to, in hopes of deceiving\r\nthe rovers. But the _ruse_ was not successful. Two of the buccaneer\r\nchiefs, Michael de Basco and Brouage, receiving intelligence that a\r\ncargo of great value had been shipped under the Dutch flag at\r\nCarthagena, in two ships much larger than their own, boldly entered the\r\nharbor, captured both, and plundered them of their treasure. The Dutch\r\ncaptains, chagrined at being thus beaten by inferior vessels, said to\r\none of the pirate chiefs that had he been alone, he would not have dared\r\nthus to attack them. The buccaneer haughtily challenged mynheer to fight\r\nthe battle over again--stipulating that his consort should stand aloof\r\nfrom the engagement, and, that should the Dutchman conquer, both the\r\npirate vessels should be his. The challenge, however, was not accepted.\r\nAt another time, when Basco and two other chiefs, named Jonqué and\r\nLaurence Le Graff, were cruising before Carthagena with three\r\nindifferent vessels, two Spanish men-of-war put out to attack them. The\r\nresult was the capture of both the latter by the pirates, who kept the\r\nships, but magnanimously sent the crews on shore--affecting, from the\r\nease with which they had been vanquished, to look upon them with utter\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another pirate chief, whose name stands out in bold\r\nrelief, for his infamous cruelties, even among the bloody records of the\r\nbuccaneers. He was a Dutchman by birth, who had settled in Brazil during\r\nthe occupancy of that country by the United Provinces. On the\r\nrestoration of the Portuguese to their Brazilian possessions this bloody\r\nwretch retreated to Jamaica. His name not being known, he received the\r\nsoubriquet of _Rock Braziliano_, by which he was henceforward known.\r\nVery soon after his arrival at Jamaica, he joined the pirates, first as\r\nan ordinary mariner; and acquitted himself so well as to gain, in a\r\nshort time, the respect and affection of his comrades. A mutiny breaking\r\nout on board the vessel in which he was embarked, caused a separation of\r\nthe crew; a second vessel was taken possession of by a portion of them,\r\nand Braziliano chosen chief. He pursued his career with various success\r\nand the most frightful cruelty. His hatred of the Spaniards was\r\nexceedingly bitter, and when landing in Spanish settlements to procure\r\nprovisions, he frequently roasted the inhabitants alive if they were not\r\nforthcoming at his command. In one of his cruises upon the coast of\r\nSouth America, he was wrecked, and his vessel lost. Escaping to the\r\nshore with his crew of only thirty men, he was pursued by a troop of one\r\nhundred Spanish cavalry. Upon these he turned, and defeated them with\r\nterrible slaughter, and with but trifling loss to himself. Mounting the\r\nhorses of the slain, Braziliano continued his course coastwise, until,\r\nfalling in with some boats from Campeachy, which he seized, he made sail\r\nfor Jamaica--capturing another ship on the voyage laden with merchandise\r\nand a large amount of money in pieces of eight. Remaining on shore long\r\nenough to dissipate their booty in the usual round of drunkenness and\r\ndebauchery which characterized the buccaneers when not upon the wave,\r\nBraziliano and his companions put to sea again, directing their course\r\nto his old haunts about Campeachy. Shortly after his arrival, while\r\nlooking into the port, in a small boat, to espy what ships were offering\r\nfor prizes, he was captured and thrown into prison. The Spanish\r\nauthorities determined upon his execution; but in consequence of an\r\nadmonition that terrible vengeance would be inflicted upon all Spanish\r\nprisoners falling into the hands of the pirates, in the event of his\r\npunishment, this horrible villain was released upon the security of his\r\nown oath, that he would forthwith relinquish his profession. But before\r\nhe reached Jamaica on his return, he captured another prize; and after\r\nthe avails of that were spent in every species of debauch, he went to\r\nsea again, committing greater robberies and cruelties than ever.\r\n\r\nJamaica, though a British possession, having, as we have seen, long\r\nafforded a market for the pirates, had in process of time become equally\r\na rendezvous with Tortuga. Wealth, in immense quantities, had been\r\npoured into that island by the pirates, and had been diffused thence\r\namong the other West India possessions, British and French. The\r\nlicentiousness of the buccaneers was unbounded, and their blood-stained\r\nspoils were scattered with incredible prodigality. Indeed they seemed to\r\nbe at a loss how to spend their money fast enough. Their captains had\r\nbeen known to purchase pipes of wine, place them in the street, knock in\r\nthe head, and compel every passer-by to drink; and mention is made of\r\none, who, returning from an expedition with three thousand dollars in\r\nhis pocket, was sold into slavery three months afterward for a debt of\r\nforty shillings. If admonished in regard to their reckless waste of\r\nmoney, their reply was that their lives were not like those of other\r\nmen. Though alive to-day, they might be dead to-morrow, and hence it was\r\nfolly for them to hoard their treasure. 'Live to-day,' was their maxim,\r\n'to-morrow may take care of itself.' Those, therefore, who were worth\r\nmillions to-day, robbed by courtezans and stripped at the gaming table,\r\nwere often penniless in a week--destitute of clothes and even the\r\nnecessaries of life. They had therefore no recourse but to return to the\r\nsea, and levy new contributions, to be dissipated as before.\r\n\r\nBut the commerce of Spain with her colonies was ruined. Failing in her\r\nexertions to conquer the buccaneers, and finding them to be so firmly\r\nestablished as to defy any force which she could send against them, and\r\nwearied in making so many consignments, as it were, directly into their\r\nhands, Spain dismantled her commercial marine and closed her South\r\nAmerican ports, in the hope--a vain one, as it proved--that when the\r\nresources of the pirates upon the high seas were cut off, their\r\nestablishments would be necessarily broken up, and the freebooters\r\nthemselves disperse. But far different was the event. No sooner had\r\nthese rapacious and savage men ascertained that there were no more\r\ngalleons of her bullion to be taken, than they concentrated their\r\nforces, with a determination to strike nearer the mines themselves.\r\nPowerful expeditions were therefore openly organized at Jamaica and\r\nelsewhere, for the purpose of making descents upon the cities and towns\r\nof the Spanish main. The temptations to such a course were indeed\r\nstrong; and the Spaniards, by their ostentatious display, materially\r\nassisted in their own ruin. For instance, the city of Lima, in 1682, on\r\nthe occasion of the public entry of the viceroy, actually had the\r\nstreets paved with ingots of silver, to the amount of seventeen millions\r\nsterling! 'What a pretty prize,' exclaims the _London Times_, 'for a few\r\nhonest tars!' Then the splendor and magnificence of their churches,\r\nornamented with immense gold and silver images, crucifixes, and\r\ncandlesticks, and not unfrequently large altars of massive silver,\r\nbecame objects of a _devout regard_. Nor did the pirates fail to present\r\nthemselves before every accessible shrine; for in truth, they swept over\r\nthe vast central portion of the continent from Florida to Peru,\r\nplundering and laying in waste the most populous regions, and the\r\nwealthiest cities--meeting, moreover, with less resistance than attended\r\nthe march of Cortez and Alvarado in achieving the conquest. Their\r\nvisitations were sudden, and wherever they struck their blows fell like\r\nthe thunderbolt. The consequence was that the consternation of the\r\npeople upon the land became as great as their terror upon the ocean. The\r\ngreat roads were deserted; and the lands were no more ploughed than the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n(SUGGESTED BY A PAINTING BY J. McENTEE.)\r\n\r\n  'The tree has lost its blossoms,...\r\n  But the sap lasts,--and still the seed we find\r\n  Sown deep even in the bosom of the North;\r\n  So shall a bitter spring less bitter fruit bring forth.'\r\n\r\n  _Childe Harold._\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wan and weird the solemn twilight gleameth in the dreary sky,\r\n  Dusky shadows growing deeper, sad night-breezes sorrowing by,\r\n  Sighing 'mid the leafless bushes bending o'er the sullen stream,\r\n  Wailing 'mid the fire-stained ruins darkly rising 'gainst the gleam\r\n  Of the wild unearthly twilight. In the shivering evening air\r\n  Cheerless lie the gloomy meadows--blight and ruin everywhere!\r\n\r\n  Far away the wide plain stretches, dark and desolate it lies\r\n  'Neath the shuddering winds that murmur, 'neath the gleaming of\r\n    the skies;\r\n  Hark to the swollen river, how it moaneth in its flow,\r\n  'Mid the bridge's fallen arches, 'neath the bushes bending low,\r\n  Now unbroken by a ripple, flowing silently and still,\r\n  Gives again unto the heavens twilight gleaming wan and chill.\r\n\r\n  Where the corn once waved in beauty its bright wealth of shining leaves,\r\n  Glittering in the noonday's glory, rustling in the summer eves,\r\n  As the murmuring wind swept o'er it, bending low each tasselled head,\r\n  'Neath the soft and shimmering radiance by the moon of summer shed--\r\n  There no plough will make its furrow--waste the sunny field doth lie,\r\n  And no grain will wave its tresses to the breezes wailing by.\r\n\r\n  Where amid the whispering forests once the laughing sunlight fell,\r\n  Fallen tree and blackened stump now the dreary story tell\r\n  Of the woe and desolation sad Virginia shadowing o'er,\r\n  From the fatal Rappahannock to Potomac's fort-crowned shore,\r\n  Tell the tale of saddened hearthstones, desolate hearts that mourn\r\n    each day\r\n  For the dearly loved ones stricken, wounded, dying, far away.\r\n\r\n  Wake, Virginia! from thy slumber, from thy wild and traitorous dream;\r\n  Wake! and welcome loyal Northmen, sabres' ring and bayonets' gleam;\r\n  Cast aside the clanking fetters that still echo on thy soil,\r\n  Teach thy sons that no dishonor clings to manly, honest toil:\r\n  So again thy tree shall blossom, fairer, stronger than before,\r\n  And God's peace will rest upon thee, thy scourged fields will hover o'er.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF DESIGN.\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe remember many years ago passing directly from the gallery of\r\nDüsseldorf pictures, then recently opened in New York, to the hall of\r\nthe National Academy. The contrast to a lover of his country was a\r\npainful one. The foreign school possessed ripeness of design, and\r\naccurate, if in many instances somewhat mannered and artificial\r\nexecution. The native collection exhibited a poverty in conception, and\r\na harshness and crudity in performance, sadly discouraging to one who\r\nwould fain see the fine arts progress in equal measure with the more\r\nmaterial elements of civilization. Since that time, however, year by\r\nyear, the art of painting, at least, has steadily advanced, the light of\r\ngenius has been granted to spring from our midst, our artists dwelling\r\nin foreign lands have returned to find a congenial atmosphere under\r\ntheir native skies, and, in so far as landscape is concerned, we have\r\nnow no need to shun comparison with the best pictures produced abroad.\r\nOur school is an original one, for our artists have gone to the great\r\nteacher, Nature, who has shown them without stint the bright sun,\r\nluminous sky, pearly dawns, hazy middays, glowing sunsets, shimmering\r\ntwilights, golden moons, rolling mists, fantastic clouds, wooded hills,\r\nsnow-capped peaks, waving grain fields, primeval forests, tender spring\r\nfoliage, gorgeous autumnal coloring, grand cataracts, leaping brooks,\r\nnoble rivers, clear lakes, bosky dells, lichen-covered crags, and varied\r\nseacoasts of this western continent. Here is no lack of diversity, here\r\nare studies in unity, both simple and complex, and here, too, even\r\ncivilized man need not necessarily be unpicturesque; witness Launt\r\nThompson's 'Trapper,' Rogers's bits of petrified history, or Eastman\r\nJohnson's vivid delineations of scenes familiar to us all. We have no\r\nreason to follow in any beaten, hackneyed track, but, within the needful\r\nrestrictions of good sense, good taste, and the teachings of nature, may\r\nwander wherever the bent of our gifts may lead us. We may choose\r\nsensational subjects, striking contrasts, with Church, follow the\r\nexquisite traceries of shadow, of mountain top and fern-clad rock, with\r\nBierstadt, learn the secrets of the innermost souls of the brute\r\ncreation with Beard, revel in cool atmospheres and transparent waters\r\nwith Kensett, paint in light with Gifford, in poetry with McEntee, or\r\nwith Whittredge seek the tranquil regions of forest shade or quiet\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of every work of art, we find three questions to be\r\nasked: Has it something to say; is that something worth saying; is it\r\nwell said? In painting, poetry, music, sculpture, and architecture,\r\nsatisfactory replies must be given, or the mind refuses to recognize the\r\nwork under consideration as fulfilling the conditions necessary to\r\nperfection within its individual range. Too often worthlessness of\r\nmeaning is hidden under exquisite execution, the most dangerous form an\r\naberration from the true principles of art can take, especially in an\r\nage when the material receives an undue proportion of attention, and the\r\nspirit is exposed to so many risks of being replaced by a false, outside\r\nglitter. A worthy, noble, or beautiful idea, clad in a corresponding\r\nform, is then the core of every art production; and although much of\r\nwhich the fundamental idea is neither worthy, noble, nor beautiful, is\r\nsometimes admired, yet the impression on the whole is painful, as would\r\nbe exquisite diction and entrancing eloquence flowing from the lips of a\r\nman of genius arguing in a cause unholy and pernicious to the best\r\ninterests of humanity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the tasteful and judicious arrangement of the pictures\r\nin the hall of exhibition, No. 625 Broadway, a cursory survey only is\r\nrequired to enforce the conviction that the necessities of light and\r\nspace demand the erection of a building especially adapted to the\r\npurposes of an academy of design, and we hope the fellowship fund will\r\nspeedily justify the commencement of that important undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe first picture that meets the eye on entering, is one of 'Startled\r\nDeer,' by W. H. Beard, N. A. (No. 197). This is a noble\r\ndelineation--such stately forms, splendid positions, and expressive\r\neyes! This artist is not content with giving us color, shape, and every\r\nhair exact, but we look through the creatures' eyes into the depths of\r\ntheir being. His animals love, fear, wonder--in short, are capable of\r\nall the manifold feelings pertaining to the brute creation. Who can say\r\nhow much of that creation is destined to perish forever! The gesture of\r\nthe spotted fawn seems reason sufficient why the Lord of love should one\r\nday give happiness and security in return for apprehension and pain\r\nsuffered here below, especially if indeed the sin of man be the moral\r\ncause of the sorrows incident to the lower existences. At all events,\r\nBeard's animals are so endowed with individual characteristics, that we\r\nmake of them personal friends, who can never die so long as our memories\r\nendure. The herbage in the foreground is tenderly wrought, and the whole\r\npicture preaches an impressive sermon.\r\n\r\nNo. 151. 'An Autumn Evening'--Regis Gignoux, N. A. This picture does not\r\nsatisfy us nearly so fully as others we have seen by the same artist.\r\nThe general effect strikes us as somewhat artificial, the light does not\r\nseem to fall clearly from the sky, but as if through prisms or tinted\r\nglass. We have seen the inside of a shell, or the edge of a white cloud\r\nturned toward the sun, glittering with similar hues, very beautiful for\r\na small object, but wanting in dignity and repose for an entire\r\nlandscape. We remember with great pleasure Gignoux's 'Autumn in\r\nVirginia,' and his painting of 'Niagara by Moonlight' gave us a far more\r\nmajestic impression of the great cataract than the famous day\r\nrepresentation by Church. As we gazed, we called to mind a certain night\r\nwhen the moon stood full in the heavens, vivid lunar bows played about\r\nour feet, and, mounting the tower, we looked down into the apparently\r\nbottomless abyss, dark with clouds of mist, seething, foaming, and\r\nthundering. We shuddered, and hastened down the narrow stairway, feeling\r\nas if all nature must speedily be drawn into the terrible vortex, and we\r\nbecome a mere atom amid chaos. The picture caused us a shivering thrill,\r\nand we acknowledged the power of the artist.\r\n\r\nNo. 90. 'Mansfield Mountain, Sunset'--S. R. Gifford, N. A. A glorious\r\ntale, gloriously told! 'The heavens show forth the glory of God, and the\r\nfirmament declareth the work of his hands. Day to day uttereth speech,\r\nand night to night showeth knowledge. * * * He hath set his tabernacle\r\nin the sun; and he * * * hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: His\r\ngoing out is from the end of heaven, and his circuit even to the end\r\nthereof: and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.' This\r\nartist seems literally to have dipped his brush in light, pure light. We\r\nremember a juvenile book, entitled, 'A Trap to catch a Sunbeam;' such a\r\ntrap must Gifford possess; he surely keeps tubes filled with real rays\r\nwherewith to flood the canvas and transfigure the simplest subject. Here\r\nwe have a mountain, a lake, some sky, clouds, and a setting sun--but\r\nwhat an admirable combination! The picture seems fairly to illumine that\r\npart of the gallery in which it is placed. Had the artist lived in the\r\nolden time, he might have been feloniously made way with for his secret,\r\nbut the present age seems more generous, and his fellow workers delight\r\nto praise and honor his genius. We find from the same hand 'Kauterskill\r\nClove' (No. 15)--a flood of golden beams poured upon a mountain glen,\r\nwith rifted sides, autumn foliage, and a tiny stream; a coming storm\r\nobscures but does not hide the distant hills. A bold delineation--but\r\nvery beautiful, and true to the character of the scenery it represents.\r\nThere are also a reminiscence of the present war ('Baltimore,\r\n1862--Twilight,' No. 409), and one of foreign travel ('Como,' No. 385),\r\nequally suggestive of--not paint--but real, palpitating atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNo. 49. 'Mount Tahawas, Adirondacs'--J. McEntee, N. A. A picture of\r\ngreat simplicity and grandeur, and one we should never weary of looking\r\ninto, waiting for the opaline lights of dawn to deepen into the full\r\nglory of day. This, like all the works of McEntee we have had the good\r\nfortune to see, bears the impress of a poet-soul. A vague stretching\r\nforth toward the regions of the infinite, a melancholy remembrance of\r\nsome enduring sorrow, a tender reminiscence of scenes peculiar to\r\ncertain heartfelt seasons of the year, a hazy foreshadowing of coming\r\nwinter, a lingering over the last dying hour of day, a presaging of\r\nstorms to come, or a lotus-eating dream by some quiet lake, are the\r\nthemes to be evolved from many of his conceptions. Alas for 'Virginia'\r\n(No. 218), mother of presidents, and nurse of the Union! Can it indeed\r\nbe her sky that shines down so weird and strange over desolate plains,\r\nthrough broken walls and shattered beams, and darkens as it shrinks in\r\nhorror from the broken bridge once spanning the blood-stained waters of\r\nthe fatal run? No. 233 is a 'Twilight,' No. 58 an 'October on the\r\nHudson,' and No. 171 a 'Late Autumn,' by the same artist, all excellent\r\nspecimens of his tender and poetical mode of handling a subject. In\r\nlooking at one of his pictures, we think more of the matter than the\r\nmanner, and, carefully correct as is the latter, the mind is often too\r\nfilled with emotion to care to examine into the very minutiæ, whose\r\ndelicate execution has so powerfully aided to produce the general\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nNo. 123. 'Morning in the White Mountains'--J. F. Kensett, N. A.\r\nExcellent in every way, with crystal water, living rocks, and\r\nrose-tinted morning clouds.\r\n\r\nNo. 74. 'Coast Scene, Mount Desert'--F. E. Church, N. A. A puzzle. We\r\nare glad once more to welcome to a public gallery a significant work by\r\nthis widely known and much admired artist. Of late, the exhibition of\r\nsuch works (in so far as we know) invariably alone, may perhaps have\r\nsubjected him to some misconception.\r\n\r\nNo. 73. 'The Window'--W. Whittredge, N. A. This is a charming picture of\r\na home that must be dear to all the dwellers therein. A lovely landscape\r\nis seen through an open window, which admits a mellow light to fall upon\r\na Turkey rug, tasteful furniture, and that 'wellspring of joy in a\r\nhouse,' a young soul, endowed with undeveloped, perhaps wonderful\r\ncapacities, crowing in the arms of a turbaned nurse. It is altogether\r\none of the best interiors ever exhibited in New York. No. 305, 'Summer,'\r\na pleasant nook, and No. 121, 'Autumn, New Jersey,' are by the same\r\naccomplished hand. The latter is a meadow scene, with a pleasing sky,\r\nsome graceful trees in the foreground, and a most attractive bit of\r\nVirginia creeper dipping into a clear pool. The gifts of W. Whittredge\r\nare manifold, and his works conspicuous for variety in subject and\r\ntreatment. In the small room, we observed a portrait of this artist by\r\nH. A. Loop, N. A., a beautiful picture and excellent likeness. We do not\r\nwonder the fine head tempted Mr. Loop to expend upon it his best care.\r\n\r\nNo. 181. 'Portrait of Dr. O. A. Brownson'--G. P. A. Healy, H. A\r\npowerful portrait of a man who has never been ashamed openly to confess\r\nthat he could be wiser to-day than he was yesterday. We never met Dr.\r\nBrownson, and it was with a thrill of pleasure that we beheld the\r\nmassive head containing so eminent an intelligence. The learned tomes,\r\nantique chair, and entire attitude are in excellent keeping.\r\n\r\nNo. 66. 'Fagot Gatherer'--R. M. Staigg, N. A. We owe this artist much\r\nfor his beautiful inculcations of the charities of life. How many stray\r\npennies may not his little street sweeper have drawn from careless\r\npassers-by? No. 59, 'Cat's Cradle,' is another pleasing representation\r\nof an attractive subject.\r\n\r\nNo. 202. 'Anita'--George H. Hall. The sweet face, harmonious coloring,\r\nand simple pose of this little Spanish girl has made an ineffaceable\r\nimpression on our memory. We should like to have her always near us. The\r\nfruit and flower pieces of this genial artist are delightful and\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nNo. 468. 'Elaine,' Bas Relief--L. Thompson, N. A. The face of Elaine is\r\nof great sweetness, and the tender trouble on the brow, in the eyes, and\r\nquivering round the mouth, seems almost too ethereal to have been\r\nactually prisoned in marble. We think if the Elaine of the legend had\r\nlooked thus upon Launcelot, and he were truly all that poets sing him,\r\nhe could not long have preferred to her the light-minded Guenevere. The\r\nbusts of children by the same hand are also fine, so truthful and\r\ncharacteristic. A worthy pupil is Thompson of that natural school of\r\nwhich Palmer was our first distinguished representative.\r\n\r\nNo. 466. 'The Union Refugees'--John Rogers. This group tells its own sad\r\ntale. The stern defiance in the face of the young patriot, the\r\nsorrow-stricken but confiding attitude of the mother, and the child's\r\nuplifted gaze of wonder, speak of scenes doubtless often repeated in the\r\nhistory of the past two years--scenes which must sink deeply into the\r\nhearts of all beholders.\r\n\r\nNo. 467. 'Freedman'--J. Q. A. Ward, A. This picture, no doubt, has its\r\nfine points, but to our mind it is rather conventional. Neither does it\r\nbear out its allegorical relation to the freedmen of our continent. If\r\nthe chains of the negro are being broken, he does not appear in the\r\ncharacter of a Hercules, but rather as a patient and enduring martyr,\r\nawaiting the day of deliverance appointed by Heaven.\r\n\r\nNo. 10. 'Sunrise at Narragansett'--W. S. Hazeltine, N. A. A fine effect\r\nof transparent sky, faithful rocks, and rolling surf. The warmth of\r\ncoloring and vivid reality of this picture render it eminently pleasing.\r\n\r\nNo. 211. 'The Adirondacks from near Mount Mansfield'--R. W. Hubbard, N.\r\nA. A beautiful foreground of fine trees and rocks, with a far-away\r\nlookout over a hazy distance. A lake glitters in the plain beneath, and\r\nthe whole scene is harmoniously bewitching and tranquillizing.\r\n\r\nNo. 158. 'Out in the Fields'--A. D. Shattuck, N. A. A charming pastoral,\r\nwith some elms, graceful and feathery as the far-famed trees on the\r\nmeadows of North Conway.\r\n\r\nNo. 27. 'Heart's Ease'--William P. W. Dana, A. We heard a little three\r\nand a half year old reply, in answer to a question as to which picture\r\nshe would prefer taking home with her from the Academy: 'The sick\r\nchild;' and we could not wonder at her choice, for a more touching\r\ndesign has seldom been placed on canvas. The name, the accompaniments,\r\nand the child's expression betoken a rare delicacy of conception. The\r\nflowers are exquisite, and the cheerful contrast of color in the drapery\r\nseems a promise of gayer, if not happier hours.\r\n\r\nBut space--together, probably, with the patience of our readers--fails\r\nfor the enumeration of all the interesting and meritorious paintings in\r\nthe exhibition of '63; otherwise, we might discourse at length upon the\r\ntwo masterly works by Bierstadt (Nos. 6 and 35), the 'Swiss Lake,' by\r\nCasilear, W. T. Richards's carefully elaborated foregrounds,\r\nHuntington's charming figures, De Haas's spirited sea scenes, and other\r\nmeritorious productions under names well known to the lovers of art in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nAs good ofttimes springs from evil, may not perhaps the present severe\r\ntrial through which our country is passing aid in lifting the hearts of\r\nher children to more spiritual regions, that they may approach ever\r\nnearer and nearer to a more thorough comprehension and enjoyment of the\r\n'Eternal Beauty, ever ancient and ever new,' as feebly mirrored in human\r\nart?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_ it--to\r\n not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\ninteresting.'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\nintended.'--WEBSTER'S _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.--(_Continued._)\r\n\r\nDuring the long weeks of Joel Burns's illness and convalescence, he had\r\nbecome much attached to James Egerton. And when the medical student\r\nquitted Burnsville, after carrying Mr. Burns through the fever in\r\ntriumph, the latter felt more grateful than words would express. It is\r\ntrue, young Egerton remained at his bedside by direction of the\r\nphysician whose pupil he was: still the manner in which he had\r\ndischarged his duties won the heart of the patient. So, when at length\r\nhe was preparing to depart, Joel Burns endeavored to think of some way\r\nto manifest his appreciation which would be acceptable to the youth.\r\nThis was difficult. Both were of refined natures, and it was not easy to\r\nbring the matter to pass. Mr. Burns, at length, after expressing his\r\ngrateful sense of his devotion, plainly told Egerton that he would\r\ndelight to be of service to him if it were possible.\r\n\r\n'I feel obliged to you, Mr. Burns,' said the student; 'but it is not\r\njust that I should excite such emotions in your breast. Let me confess\r\nthat while I do respect and esteem you, it is love of my _profession_,\r\nand not of any individual, which has led me to use more than ordinary\r\ncare while attending to your case. I have a firm belief in the method of\r\nmy principal, and it is a labor of love with me to endeavor to\r\ndemonstrate the truth of his theory in the treatment of typhus fever.\r\nYour case was a magnificent one. My master is right, and I know it.'\r\n\r\n'Now you take just the ground I admire; you enable me to say what before\r\nI hesitated to speak of,' said Mr. Burns, warmly. 'Tell me honestly how\r\nyou are situated. Can I not aid in affording you still further\r\nadvantages for study and practical observation?'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Burns,' replied the student, 'it is my turn to feel\r\ngrateful--grateful for such genial recognition of what I am, or rather\r\nwhat I hope to make myself. Something of your own history I have learned\r\nin this place--this place of your own creation--and I may say there are\r\npoints of analogy between your own early struggles and mine. But I must\r\ndepend on myself. To accept aid from you would weaken me, and that you\r\nwould not wish to do.'\r\n\r\n'Go,' said Mr. Burns, with enthusiasm; 'go, and God go with you. But\r\npromise me this: let me hear from you regularly. Let me not lose sight\r\nof one of whom I hope so much.'\r\n\r\n'That I promise with pleasure.'\r\n\r\nThen he turned to find Sarah, to bid her good by. She was running across\r\nthe lawn, but stopped abruptly on hearing her name called.\r\n\r\n'Little maiden,' said the young man, 'I am going away. We shall have no\r\nmore races together. When I see you again, it won't do for either of us\r\nto romp and run about.'\r\n\r\n'Why? Are you not coming to see us till you are old?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know that, but I shall not come very soon. After a while I\r\nshall go across the ocean, and you will grow up to be a young woman. So\r\nI must say a long good-by now to my little patient.'\r\n\r\nSarah was twelve, Egerton scarcely twenty. For the instant, young as she\r\nwas, there was actually established between them a sentimental relation.\r\nThey stood a moment looking at each other.\r\n\r\n'Good-by,' said Egerton, taking her hand. 'I think I must have this for\r\na keepsake.' It was a straggling curl, detached from its companions,\r\nwhich the student laid hold of. Sarah said not one word, but took a neat\r\nlittle morocco 'housewife' from her pocket, produced a small pair of\r\nscissors, and clipped the curl quickly, leaving it in Egerton's hand.\r\n\r\n'You won't forget me,' he said.\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\nIn an instant more she was bounding over the green grass, while the\r\nother walked slowly into the house. In a few minutes he was off. I do\r\nnot think this scene produced any impression on Sarah Burns beyond the\r\npassing moment; but to Egerton, who was just of an age to cherish such\r\nan incident, it furnished material for a romantic idea, which he\r\nnourished until it came to be a part of his life plans. Whatever was the\r\nreason which actuated him, it is a fact that he wrote Mr. Burns, not\r\noften, to be sure, but quite regularly. After two or three years he went\r\nabroad, still keeping up his correspondence. Mr. Burns, for some reason\r\nwe will not conjecture, was not in the habit of speaking to his daughter\r\nabout Egerton. Possibly he did not wish her to remember him as a\r\ngrown-up man while she was still a little girl. Possibly, he desired,\r\nshould they ever meet, that their acquaintance might commence afresh. At\r\nany rate, Sarah was left quite to forget the existence of the young\r\nfellow who watched by her so faithfully; or if by some chance some\r\nrecollection of him, as connected with that dreadful season, came into\r\nher mind, it was purely evanescent and without consequence. Mr. Burns,\r\nhowever, always cherished certain hopes. The reader will recollect his\r\nsadness of heart when he discovered how matters stood between Sarah and\r\nHiram Meeker. This was owing principally to his honest aversion to\r\nHiram; but a disappointment lurked at the bottom. It was only the week\r\nbefore the scene at the preparatory lecture that he had received a\r\nletter from Egerton, written on American soil, advising him of his\r\nreturn from Europe in a vessel just arrived from Marseilles. Mr. Burns\r\nanswered it immediately, inviting him to come at once and make him a\r\nvisit; but he breathed not a word of this to Sarah.\r\n\r\nAffairs between her and Hiram were brought to a crisis much faster than\r\nMr. Burns could have anticipated. In short, Dr. Egerton arrived at the\r\nmost auspicious moment possible. But I shall not be precipitate. On the\r\ncontrary, I shall leave the lovers, if lovers they are to be, to pursue\r\ntheir destiny in the only true way, namely, through a tantalizing maze\r\nof hopes and fears and doubts and charming hesitations and anxieties to\r\na denouement, while I return to the proper subject of this\r\nnarrative--Hiram Meeker.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHill has opened a wholesale liquor store on his own account! Where did\r\nHill raise the money to start in business--a poor devil who could never\r\nget eighteen pence ahead in the world? It does not appear. For one, I\r\nwill say that Hiram Meeker did not furnish it. _He_ not only belongs to\r\nthe temperance society, but he believes all traffic in the 'deadly\r\npoison' to be a sin. Still where did Hill get the money or the credit to\r\nstart a wholesale liquor concern? More than this, Hill is doing a pretty\r\nlarge business. Singular to say, he drinks less and swears less than he\r\ndid. He is more respectable apparently. He has a very fine store in\r\nWater street. He does not deal in adulterated liquors. He sells his\r\narticles, if the customer desires it, 'in bond;' that is, from under the\r\nkey of the custom house, which of course insures their purity. By a\r\nsingular coincidence, Hill's store is adjoining a 'U. S. Bonded\r\nWarehouse.' Hill's goods, for convenience' sake, are sent to that\r\nparticular warehouse--frequently. The liquors are stored in the\r\nbasement. This basement is not supposed to communicate with the basement\r\nof Hill's store. Certainly not. Yet Hill, _solus_, entirely and\r\nabsolutely _solus_, spends many evenings in the basement of his store.\r\nHill is a large purchaser of pure spirits. Pure spirits are worth\r\nthirty-one cents a gallon, and brandy of right brand is worth two or\r\nthree dollars a gallon. One gallon of pure spirits mixed with two\r\ngallons of brandy cannot be detected by ninety-nine persons of a\r\nhundred. Some say it is equally difficult to detect a half-and-half\r\nmixture. Still Hill sells his brandy in bond. I repeat, Hiram Meeker\r\ndoes _not_ furnish Hill the money. It is true, their intimacy still\r\ncontinues. Further, Hill has good references--none other than H. Bennett\r\n& Co. Strange as it may seem, H. Bennett himself has been known to put\r\nhis name on Hill's paper. Yet I am told he does not even know Hill by\r\nsight! Hill is making money, though--is making it fast. Hiram is still\r\nin the house of Hendly, Layton & Gibb, but this has not prevented him\r\nfrom making, with permission of the firm, several ventures on his own\r\naccount. These ventures always turn out well. It was not long since he\r\nshipped a schooner load of potatoes to New Orleans on information\r\nderived from the master of a vessel which had made a remarkably rapid\r\npassage, and who reported to him, and to him only. He more than doubled\r\nhis money on this venture.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Chellis's church, Hiram has made respectable progress. He has\r\npermitted himself to break over the strict rule first adopted as to his\r\nsocial life. He goes a little into society--the very best society which\r\nthat congregation furnishes. Report says he is engaged to Miss Tenant.\r\nShe is the only child of Amos Tenant, of the firm of Allwise, Tenant &\r\nCo. This firm is reputed to be worth over a million of dollars. Miss\r\nTenant--Miss Emma Tenant--is the young lady who, from the first, took\r\nsuch an interest in Hiram at the Sunday school. She is an excellent\r\ngirl. She is very pretty, too, and, I am sorry to say, she seems to have\r\nfallen in love--really and positively in love with Hiram. _He_, the\r\ncalculating wretch, has canvassed the whole matter, has made careful\r\ninvestigations of the condition of the house of Allwise, Tenant & Co.,\r\nand has satisfied himself that it is firm as a rock, and that Mr. Tenant\r\nis no doubt worth the pretty sum of three hundred and fifty thousand\r\ndollars, or such a matter.\r\n\r\nEmma is an only child!\r\n\r\nOh, Hiram, how dare you utter those vows of love and constancy and\r\neverlasting regard and affection, coming, as you do, with your fingers\r\nfresh from turning the leaves at the register's office, where,\r\nforgetting your dinner, you have spent the entire afternoon in\r\nsatisfying yourself about the real estate held by 'Amos Tenant?' Had the\r\nrecord under your precious investigation not been satisfactory, you\r\nwould not have spent five minutes thereafter in the society of Emma\r\nTenant.\r\n\r\nYet your conscience does not reproach you. No, not one bit. Positively\r\nyou are not aware of anything reprehensible or even indelicate in what\r\nyou are about. Thinking of the matter, as you carefully scan the books\r\nof record, you regard it precisely as you would any other investigation.\r\nTo you it is essential that the girl you are to marry should have money.\r\nIf she has, you will love her (for it is your _duty_ to love your wife);\r\nif she has not, you cannot love her, and of course (duty again) you\r\ncannot wed her.\r\n\r\nPoor Emma Tenant! No protecting instinct warns you against the young man\r\nwho is now making such fervid protestations. You receive all he says as\r\nholy truth, sincere, earnest avowal, out of his heart into yours, for\r\ntime and for eternity!\r\n\r\nYou, Emma Tenant, are a good girl, innocent and good: why, oh, why does\r\nnot your nature shrink by this contact?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe forbear to paint the love scene in which Hiram figures. Enough to say\r\nthat Emma could not and did not disguise the state of her affections.\r\nYes, she confessed it, confessed she had been attracted by Hiram (poor\r\nthing) from the day she first saw him enter the Sunday school to take\r\nhis place as one of its teachers.\r\n\r\nHow happy she was as she sat trembling with emotion, her hand in Hiram's\r\ncalculating grasp, while she blushingly made her simple confession.\r\n\r\n'But your father,' interposed Hiram, anxiously--'he will never give his\r\nconsent.'\r\n\r\n'And why will he not?' replied Emma. 'I am sure he likes you already,\r\nand when he knows'--\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and blushed deeper than ever.\r\n\r\n'When he knows,' said Hiram, taking up the sentence, 'he will hate me: I\r\nam sure he will.'\r\n\r\n'How can you say so?' replied the confiding girl. 'I am his only child,\r\nand he will approve of anything which is for my happiness.'\r\n\r\n'But he may not think an engagement with me (you see Hiram was\r\ndetermined on the engagement) will be for your happiness. I am not known\r\nhere--am not yet in business for myself, although so far as that is\r\nconcerned'--\r\n\r\n'Don't speak so--it pains me; as if I could think of such things _now_,'\r\nshe whispered, as if really in bodily distress.\r\n\r\n'But it _must_ be mentioned, and at once; we must tell your parents. It\r\nwould be highly improper not to do so.'\r\n\r\nHe meant to make all sure.\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, I suppose you are right, but it will make no difference to\r\npapa if you had not a penny. I have heard him say so a thousand times.'\r\n\r\n'Have you,' replied Hiram, drawing a long breath, 'have you really?'\r\n\r\n'Indeed I have. He has always said he would prefer to see me marry a\r\nhigh-minded, honorable young man, of strict integrity, without a cent in\r\nthe world, to the richest man living, if he were sordid and calculating.\r\nOh, he despises such persons. Now are you satisfied?'\r\n\r\nHiram _was_ satisfied, that is, logically; but somehow he _felt_ a hit,\r\nand in spite of himself his countenance was clouded, and he was silent.\r\n\r\n'I have said something to wound you. I know I have,' exclaimed Emma.\r\n\r\n'To wound me! My angel, my'--etc., etc., etc. (the pen refuses to do its\r\noffice when I come to record Hiram's love expressions). 'How can you\r\nthink so at this moment of my greatest rapture, my most complete'--etc.,\r\netc., etc. (pen fails again). 'It was my intense joy and satisfaction to\r\nlearn how noble and disinterested your father is, that rendered me for\r\nthe moment speechless.'\r\n\r\nAfter considerable discussion, it was arranged that Emma should be the\r\none to communicate to her parents the interesting fact that Hiram sought\r\nher hand. On this occasion his courage so far failed him that he\r\npreferred not to break the subject himself, although generally so very\r\ncapable and adroit in personal interviews.\r\n\r\nMr. Tenant, as usual with papas, was a good deal surprised. He had not\r\nthought of Emma's marrying--considered her still little else than a\r\nschool girl, and so on--well--he supposed it must come sooner or later.\r\nHe knew very little about the young man, but what he did know was\r\ncertainly in his favor.\r\n\r\nTo cut the story short, the whole matter was soon pleasantly settled,\r\nand Hiram established as the accepted of Miss Tenant.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent interview with Mr. Tenant, our hero quite won his heart.\r\nThat gentleman was an old-fashioned merchant; the senior member of a\r\nhouse known as one of the most honorable in the city. I say senior\r\nmember, for the 'Allwise' whose name stood first was a son of the\r\noriginal partner through whose capacity mainly it had been built up and\r\nmade strong. Mr. Tenant, I repeat, was a merchant of the old school,\r\nhigh minded and of strict integrity, not specially remarkable for\r\nability, but possessing good sense and a single mind. The house once on\r\nthe right track, with its credit and its correspondents established, he\r\nhad only to keep the wheel revolving in the old routine, and all was\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nMr. Tenant was quite carried away by Hiram's conversation. The latter\r\nwas so shrewd and capable, yet so good and honest withal. He first\r\nrecounted to his prospective father-in-law a little history of his whole\r\nlife. He portrayed in feeling terms how God had never forsaken, but on\r\nthe contrary had always sustained and supported him--in his infancy, at\r\nschool, through various vicissitudes--had conducted him to New York, to\r\nDr. Chellis's church, into his (Mr. Tenant's) family; and now, as a\r\ncrowning mercy, was about to bestow on him the greatest treasure of the\r\nuniverse to be a partner of his joys and sorrows through life.\r\n\r\nThen he discoursed of affairs; of what he hoped with a 'common blessing'\r\nto accomplish. He informed Mr. Tenant confidentially that in the\r\napproaching month of May he should commence a general shipping and\r\ncommission business. His plans were matured, and though his capital was\r\nsmall--\r\n\r\n'Count on me, young man, count on the house of Allwise, Tenant & Co.,'\r\ninterrupted the kind-hearted old gentleman. 'I have no boy,' he\r\ncontinued, with tears in his eyes; 'my only one was snatched from me,\r\nbut now I shall look on you as my son. You will start in May. Good. And\r\nwhat the house can do for you will be done.'\r\n\r\n'Then perhaps I may be permitted to refer to you?'\r\n\r\n'Permitted? I shall insist on it. What is more, I will see two or three\r\nof our friends to make up your references myself. You must begin strong.\r\nWhere do you keep your account?'\r\n\r\nHiram told him. It was a bank where Mr. Bennett had introduced him.\r\n\r\n'That is well enough, but those are dry goods people, not at all in our\r\nline. I must introduce you at our bank, or, what is better, I will get\r\nDaniel Story to introduce you at his. There you will get a double\r\nadvantage.'\r\n\r\nNeed I add that Hiram was in ecstasies? His position would now equal his\r\nmost brilliant dreams. To be placed at once on an equality with the old\r\nSouth-street houses! To have Daniel Story introduce him to his bank! It\r\nwas even so. The future son-in-law of Amos Tenant would gain just such\r\nan entree to business life.\r\n\r\nAnd profitable use did Hiram Meeker make of these 'privileges.' He no\r\nlonger thought of depending on H. Bennett & Co. Very quietly he thanked\r\nhis cousin for his kind offer of assistance by way of reference, etc.,\r\nbut he was of opinion it would be better to have some names in his own\r\nline. Then he mentioned who were to be his 'backers,' whereat Mr.\r\nBennett was amazed, yet highly gratified, and, without seeking to\r\ninquire further, told Hiram he 'would _do_,' he always said he would,\r\nthat he must call on him, however, whenever he thought he could give him\r\na lift, and predicted that he would be very _successful_ on his own\r\naccount. All which Hiram received meekly and mildly, but he said nothing\r\nin reply.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to give in detail the particulars of Hiram's\r\ncommercial life. Having been sufficiently minute in describing his early\r\nbusiness education, the experience he acquired, the habits he formed,\r\nthe reader can readily understand that his career became from the start\r\na promising one. He was familiar with all the ramifications of commerce.\r\nHe thoroughly knew the course of trade in New York. He had studied\r\ncarefully the operation of affairs, from the largest shipping interest\r\nto the daily consumption of the most petty retail shop. He had managed\r\nto lay up quite a respectable sum of money, and all he now wanted was a\r\ngood opportunity to launch himself, and it was presented.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think Mr. Tenant would have been willing to have taken\r\nhim into his own firm, had Hiram wished, but he had no such ambition. He\r\ndesired by himself to lay broad and deep the foundation of a large\r\nbusiness, and have it expand and become great in his own hands. He did\r\nnot believe in partnerships; it is doubtful if he were willing to trust\r\nhuman nature so much as to admit anybody to such a close relation as\r\nthat of business associate.\r\n\r\nIn the management of his affairs, Hiram made it a point to acquire the\r\nreputation of fair and honorable dealing. His word was his bond. That\r\nwas his motto; and he carried it out fully and absolutely. Mistakes\r\ncould always be corrected in his establishment. No matter if the party\r\n_were_ legally concluded. He stood by his contracts. A mere verbal say\r\nso, though the market rose twenty-five per cent. on his hands the next\r\nhalf hour, could be relied on as much as his indenture under seal. And\r\nso he gained a splendid name the very first year of his mercantile\r\ncareer. Yet, I _must_ say it, behind all this fine reputation, this\r\nhappy speech of men, this common report and general character, sat Hiram\r\nalert and calculating, whispering to himself sagaciously: '_Honesty is\r\nthe best policy_.'\r\n\r\n[In affairs, he meant. Had he carried the apophthegm out into every\r\ndetail of life, through its moral and social phases, it would have\r\nrequired indeed the eye of the Omniscient to have discerned and\r\npenetrated his error.]\r\n\r\nI come to the close of Hiram's first year of business on his own\r\naccount. He had suddenly loomed into importance. But never was there an\r\neffect more directly traceable to a cause. He did not embark till he was\r\nin readiness for the venture, and results came quickly. With change of\r\nposition he had made corresponding changes in his social life. He left\r\nEastman's, and took pleasant though not expensive quarters in a more\r\nfashionable part of the city, not far indeed from Mr. Tenant's house. He\r\nvisited in company with Emma all her family friends and acquaintances.\r\nHe made such progress in the church, that the majority of the female\r\nteachers in the Sunday school were in favor of electing him\r\nsuperintendent. In short, he was becoming a very popular young man.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I come to the close of Hiram's first year. I wish I\r\ncould stop here. I go on with that reluctance which I invariably feel\r\nwhen recording what must add to the repugnance with which we all regard\r\nHiram's character.\r\n\r\nThe engagement between Hiram and Miss Tenant had been made public. The\r\ntime for the marriage was fixed at about the first of July--only six\r\nweeks distant. It was a period when Hiram felt he could leave town most\r\nconveniently for his wedding trip. The preparations on Emma's part were\r\nample as became her family and social position. She was very happy. She\r\nloved this young man, and believed he loved her. Hiram was good natured\r\nand agreeable, and did all in his power to exhibit his best qualities.\r\nThe result was that he was very much liked by both Mr. and Mrs. Tenant,\r\nand was already quite domesticated at their house.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring there was a great deal of speculation in certain\r\nleading articles of export. The house of Allwise, Tenant & Co., having\r\nfirst class correspondents abroad and enjoying large credit, advanced\r\nmore liberally than was prudent. It was the younger members who decided\r\nto go largely into the enterprise. There came a panic in the market.\r\nSeveral leading houses in London and Liverpool failed, others in New\r\nYork followed, and among them Allwise, Tenant & Co.\r\n\r\nIt proved that this firm, though eminently sound and above board, was\r\nnot as wealthy as was generally supposed. Its high character for\r\nintegrity and honor, and an existence of near forty years without a\r\nreverse gave it great reputation for wealth and stability.\r\n\r\nThe blow was sudden and effective. The capital of the concern was wiped\r\nout of existence, and the individual property of the partners followed\r\nin this wake of destruction.\r\n\r\nHiram, like others, had overestimated Mr. Tenant's property. The latter\r\nwas nevertheless a rich man for those days, and worth over one hundred\r\nthousand dollars. By this reverse he was penniless.\r\n\r\nHiram was on 'Change when he first caught the rumor of the catastrophe.\r\nHis position with regard to the family (for his relations with it were\r\nnow well understood) made it difficult for him to make many inquiries,\r\nbut he hastened to his counting room and despatched a messenger to Hill\r\nto come to him forthwith. Hill was prompt, and having been carefully\r\ncharged with his commission, at once started to execute it. He came back\r\nduly.\r\n\r\n'All gone to----. Not a grease spot left of them.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be so gross, Hill. You are constantly shocking me with your idle\r\nprofanity. Are you sure, though?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. More bills back, twice over, than they can pay. A clean sweep,\r\nby----.'\r\n\r\n'That will do, Hill--that will do; but don't swear so, don't.'\r\n\r\n'Now I am here,' continued Hill, 'what about that invoice of brandy to\r\nHenshaw? He declares the brandy ain't right. You know you thought'--\r\n\r\n'Hill,' interrupted Hiram, 'I can't talk with you now. Leave me alone,\r\nand close the door after you.'\r\n\r\nHill went out without saying a word.\r\n\r\nIf we except a slight paleness which overspread his countenance, Hiram\r\nhad exhibited no sign of emotion from the moment he heard of Mr.\r\nTenant's failure to the time he disposed so summarily of his satellite\r\nHill. When Hill left, he rose and walked two or three times quickly up\r\nand down the room, and then took his seat again. His thoughts ran\r\nsomething in this way: 'I never supposed old Tenant to have any business\r\nability, but I thought the concern so well established it could go\r\nalone. So it could if those young fellows had not made asses of\r\nthemselves. What's to be done? Tenant certainly has a large amount of\r\nindividual property. It is worth saving. Respectable old name--if he\r\nkeeps his money. (Hiram smiled grimly.) I will step round at once and\r\noffer my services, before other folks begin to tinker with him.'\r\n\r\nOn my word, reader, during all this time Hiram never once thought of\r\nEmma Tenant. She did not for a solitary instant enter in any of the\r\ncombinations which he was so rapidly forming and reforming. So entirely\r\nwas he occupied with canvassing the effect of the failure on his\r\npersonal fortunes and thinking over what was best to be done under the\r\ncircumstances, that he had no space in his brain, much less in his\r\nselfish heart, for the 'object of his affections,' to whom he was to be\r\nmarried in one little month.\r\n\r\nHow would _she_ feel? How would the blow affect her? What could he do to\r\nreassure her? How could he best comfort her? What fond promises and\r\nloving protestations could he offer that now more than ever he desired\r\nto make her happy?\r\n\r\nNothing of this, nothing of this occupied him as he sat in his private\r\noffice, rapidly surveying the situation.\r\n\r\nPoor Emma!\r\n\r\nCarrying out his decision, Hiram took his way to the establishment of\r\nAllwise, Tenant & Co.\r\n\r\nHe was immediately admitted to Mr. Tenant's private room. That gentleman\r\nsat there alone, with his eyes fixed on a long list which his bookkeeper\r\nhad just furnished him. He looked somewhat disturbed and solicitous, but\r\npresented nevertheless a manly and by no means dejected mien.\r\n\r\n'Ah, my dear boy, I knew there was no need of sending for you. I _knew_\r\nyou would be here. God bless you. Sit down, sit down. I want to use your\r\nready wit just now for a few minutes. Thank God, I have your clear head\r\nand honest heart to turn to.'\r\n\r\nAll this time Mr. Tenant was pressing Hiram's hand, which lay\r\nimpassively in his. The honest man was too much carried away by his own\r\nfeelings to notice the other's lack of sympathetic pity.\r\n\r\n'Why, my dear sir,' said Hiram, at length, 'did you not give me some\r\nhint of this? We might have'--\r\n\r\n'I had no idea of it myself till the mails were delivered this morning.\r\nPhillipson & Braines's stoppage has destroyed us. Such a strong house as\r\nwe thought it to be! When they suspended, it discredited us with our\r\nother friends, for everybody knew our relations with them, so that they\r\nwould neither accept our bills nor protect us in any way. We are struck\r\ndown without warning.'\r\n\r\n'No hope of reconstruction?' asked Hiram.\r\n\r\n'None.'\r\n\r\n'You wanted me just now, I think you said.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. There are one or two matters which I am inclined to think should\r\nbe treated as confidential. Certain collections, and so forth. We have\r\nalready discussed it somewhat. You shall examine and give me your\r\nopinion.'\r\n\r\n'Had you not better first make some arrangements to protect your\r\nindividual property?'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\nHiram repeated the question, and in a more definite shape.\r\n\r\nHe was astounded when the honorable old merchant told him that he should\r\nmake no reservations--that his property, all of it, belonged to his\r\ncreditors, and to his creditors it should go.\r\n\r\nEven in this juncture Mr. Tenant was so taken up with his own position\r\nthat he failed to discover Hiram's real object. He actually turned\r\nconsoler.\r\n\r\n'Courage, my boy,' he exclaimed. 'My wife has a little sum of her own,\r\nabout twelve thousand dollars, enough to keep us old folks from\r\nstarving; and as soon as you are married, we will club together, and\r\nlive as happy as ever--hey?'\r\n\r\n'I hope, after all, matters are not as bad as you suppose,' said Hiram,\r\nwishing to make some response, but determining not to commit himself.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but they are,' said Mr. Tenant. 'We must not deceive ourselves.\r\nHowever, let that pass. Now tell me what you think about these\r\ncollections?'\r\n\r\nHiram forced himself to listen patiently to Mr. Tenant's statement, for\r\nhe had not yet decided on the course he was presently to pursue. So he\r\ntalked over the question, pro and con, managing to fully agree with the\r\nviews of Mr. Tenant in every particular.\r\n\r\n'I knew you would think as I do about this,' exclaimed the latter,\r\njoyfully. 'It does you credit, Hiram. It shows your honorable sense. How\r\ncould I take that money and put it into the general indebtedness? How\r\ncould I? Well, well, I have already employed too much of your time. We\r\nshall do nothing to-day but examine into matters. You will be up this\r\nevening?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly.'\r\n\r\n'Good-by till then, my dear boy.\r\n\r\nEmma must spare you to me for once. To-night we will have our various\r\nstatements ready, and I shall want your help to look them over.'\r\n\r\n'The old fool,' muttered Hiram, as he left the place. 'The old jackass.\r\nI won't give it up yet, though. I will try his wife. I will try Emma.\r\nNo, I won't give it up yet. I will go there this evening, and see what\r\ncan be done. But if I find that--'\r\n\r\nThe rest of the sentence was inaudible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MR. LINCOLN BECAME AN ABOLITIONIST.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Perhaps, Messrs. Editors, you may recall\r\n  A story you published some time in the fall,--\r\n  I think 'twas October--your files will declare,--\r\n  Bearing the title of 'Tom Johnson's Bear.'\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Well, the story since that time has grown somewhat bigger,\r\n  And has something to say about holding the 'nigger;'\r\n  And something, likewise, about letting him go,\r\n  The which I've no purpose at present to show:\r\n  To wit, how a woodman, a kind-hearted neighbor,\r\n  Returning at night from his rail-splitting labor,\r\n  Found poor Mistress Johnson forlorn and distressed,\r\n  In that perilous posture still holding the beast;\r\n  And how she besought the kind gentleman's help,\r\n  And how he'd have nothing to do with the whelp;\r\n  And how he and Johnson soon got by the ears,\r\n  And fought on the question of 'freedom for bears;'\r\n  And how, _inter alia_, the beast got away\r\n  And took himself off in the midst of the fray;\r\n  And how Tommy Johnson at last came to grief:\r\n  All which I omit, as I wish to be brief.\r\n  The story's too lengthy--it must not be sent all\r\n  To cumber your pages, my dear CONTINENTAL.\r\n  At present my purpose, my object, my mission is\r\n  To show how the woodman became 'Abolitionist.'\r\n  Introductions, you know, like 'original sin,'\r\n    Hang on, while you long for some sign of repentance\r\n    In shape of the last and the welcomest sentence,\r\n  So, in short, I'll cut short, draw a line, and begin.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The woodman one night was aroused by a clatter,\r\n  Each one in the house crying, 'Ho! what's the matter?'\r\n  All jumped out of bed and ran hither and thither,\r\n  Scarce knowing amid their alarm why or whither;\r\n  But soon it was found 'mid the tumult and din\r\n  That burglars were making attempts to break in.\r\n  And now there arose o'er the turmoil and noise\r\n  The woodman's loud summons addressed to 'the boys.'\r\n  'The boys' quickly came, and on looking around,\r\n  At one of the windows a ladder was found,\r\n  And on it a burglar, who, plying his trade,\r\n  A burglarious opening already had made.\r\n\r\n  Now the woodman, though making this nocturnal sortie\r\n  All armed and equipped, at the rate of 'two-forty,'\r\n  Called a halt, and proposed, before firing a gun,\r\n  To question with care what had better be done.\r\n  Forthwith he assembled a council of war,\r\n  To gravely consider how fast and how far\r\n  In a case of this kind it was lawful to go.\r\n  Some said, 'Smash the ladder,' but others said, 'No,\r\n  There were many objections to that, and the chief\r\n  Was the constitutional rights of the thief;\r\n  That the ladder was property all men agreed,\r\n  And as such was protected, secured, guaranteed;\r\n  And if 'twas destroyed, our greatest of laws\r\n  Could not be upheld and maintained 'as it was.''\r\n  But others replied, 'That ladder's the chief\r\n  Supporter, as all men may see, of the thief;\r\n  Let's aim at the ladder, and if it should fall,\r\n  Let the burglar fall with it, or hang by the wall\r\n  As well as he can; and by the same token,\r\n  Whose fault will it be if his neck should be broken?'\r\n  To which it was answered, 'That ladder may be\r\n  The chattel of some honest man, d'ye see.'\r\n  'Well, then, we will pay for't.' 'No, never!' says V.,\r\n  'To be taxed for that ladder I'll never agree;\r\n  You have brought on this fuss,' said V., mad and still madder;\r\n  'You always intended to break the man's ladder;\r\n  You have been for a long time the people deceiving\r\n  With false and pretended objections to thieving;\r\n  You never desired to have robbing abolished;\r\n  You only have sought to have ladders demolished.'\r\n\r\n  'Pray, hold!' said another, 'perhaps while we're trifling\r\n  About this old ladder, the thief will be rifling\r\n  The house of its contents, or, venturing further,\r\n  May set it on fire--the children may murder.'\r\n  'Can't help it,' says V.; 'though he murder to-day,\r\n  Who knows but to-morrow the murderer may\r\n  Repent and reform; then who shall restore\r\n  The ladder all perfect and sound as before?\r\n  But whether or no, I can never consent\r\n  That the thief and the ladder should make a descent,\r\n  Which haply might hurt a burglarious brother,\r\n  Or totally wreck and demolish the other.'\r\n\r\n  The woodman bade 'Silence!' He cried out, 'Ho! list!'\r\n  Then called on the burglar his work to desist,\r\n  And made proclamation throughout all the town\r\n  That if in a specified time he came down\r\n  And gave a firm pledge of obeying the laws,\r\n  He might keep his old ladder all safe 'as it was;'\r\n  But if he pursued his felonious intent\r\n  Beyond the time given, he'd cause to be sent\r\n  'Mid the conflict of arms and the cannon's loud thunder,\r\n  A missile to knock his old ladder from under.\r\n  Then pausing to see the effect of his speech,\r\n  He saw nought but the thief still at work at the breach;\r\n  And, being opposed to thieves visiting attics,\r\n  Combined with those vile anti-ladder fanatics,\r\n  And sent a projectile which left the thief where\r\n  Thieves and traitors should all be, suspended in air,\r\n  Except that he lacked what was due to his calling,\r\n  A hempen attachment to keep him from falling.\r\n\r\n  Then burglars, and thieves, and traitors, and all\r\n  Their friends sympathetic forthwith 'gan to bawl,\r\n  'We're ruined! we're ruined! To what a condition\r\n  The country is brought by this man's abolition!'\r\n  And echo replied: 'Oh! dreadful condition!\r\n  Abolition--bolition--bolition--abolition!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF A TRIP TO EUROPE, AND HOW TO GO CHEAPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked of those who have been to Europe: 'What does\r\nit cost?' 'For how little can one travel abroad?' etc. For it is within\r\nthe hopes of many to go at one time or another; and many would indulge\r\nthe anticipation more freely, if they 'could see their way,' as the\r\nYorkshire man wanted to do when he thought of getting married. I propose\r\nto throw some little light on this oft-repeated question.\r\n\r\nThe expense of a journey depends greatly on the manner in which it is\r\nmade. People who go to Europe, frequently imagine that they must go in a\r\ncertain degree of style; they must expend something by way of showing\r\nthat they are somebody in their own country! To carry out this idea,\r\nthey go, on first landing, to expensive hotels; they carry considerable\r\nluggage, travel in first-class carriages, and incur various other\r\nexpenses, to show John Bull and the continentals that they belong to the\r\nsuperior class at home. These people pay largely for their whistle, or\r\ntrumpet. They will tell you you cannot go to Europe for less than three\r\nor five thousand dollars apiece. They fancy they have made a good\r\nimpression on the Europeans; whereas the Europeans never noticed their\r\nvain little attempts at showing off. Nobody cared what they paid or gave\r\naway; and the very courier who flattered, or the servants who fawned on\r\nthem for their money, laughed at them behind their backs. There is\r\nanother class, more quiet and moderate, who want to be economical, but\r\ndo not know how to be. They will tell you a short trip can be taken for\r\na thousand or fifteen hundred dollars. They go by the guide books, and\r\nthose are based always on 'first-class prices and a liberal\r\nexpenditure.' There are no guide books for those who would _study_\r\neconomy; who would submit to some privations for the sake of seeing\r\nforeign lands and acquiring the desirable knowledge which can only be\r\ngained by personal observation. For such, a guide book is very much\r\nneeded. They constitute a large class of persons. They have an ardent\r\ndesire to visit the Old World and places of renown--they would go in\r\ncrowds, but for fear of the expense, and the assurances of their friends\r\nthat it will cost so much. When we assure them that a trip to England\r\nand Scotland, and a tour through France, Germany, Prussia, Holland,\r\nSwitzerland, and part of Italy, covering four or five months, may be\r\nmade, has been made, for four hundred dollars, including first-class\r\nsteamship passages going and returning, they may be encouraged to think\r\nof starting as soon as gold is at par.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who has established hotels in England and Scotland, and\r\npublished a Guide through London, says no traveller need pay at a hotel\r\nmore than eighteen pence (thirty-seven cents of our money) a day for his\r\nroom. To this is usually added from eighteen to twenty-five cents for\r\nattendance; gas being two cents extra per night. In London, however,\r\nsuch moderate hotels are usually in the business part of the town. In\r\nthe desirable portions for a sojourn, private board and lodging can be\r\nhad from a guinea to a pound and a half a week; or two furnished rooms\r\nmay be taken at four or five dollars or more per week. This includes the\r\nservice of cooking and serving meals; the tenant furnishing the\r\nmarketing, which costs from two dollars to two dollars and a half a week\r\nfor each person. This is the cheapest way of living for a party. Such\r\nrooms may be found by looking in newspaper advertisements. Agents make\r\nthem cost more. It will be easy, by making a few inquiries, to hear of a\r\ndozen such places; and as people do not move so often in London as\r\nhere, the knowledge may be available for a year or two.\r\n\r\nIn Edinburgh, Glasgow, and other cities, the cheap hotels are found in\r\nthe very best localities. They usually advertise in Bradshaw's 'Monthly\r\nGuide,' and in the newspapers. They have clean beds and nice rooms\r\nalmost universally. If the traveller desires strictly to economize, he\r\nneed not pay for meals in the hotel, where 'a plain breakfast' (tea and\r\nbread and butter) will cost twenty-five cents, and dinner fifty cents;\r\nhe can, if he choose, go to one of the numerous restaurants in the\r\nvicinity, and dine comfortably for twelve cents: other meals in\r\nproportion. These places are numerous and good in the cities of Great\r\nBritain. On the Continent, the prices at restaurants are higher, for\r\nstrangers at least; a marked distinction being made between them and the\r\ninhabitants of the country. '_I forestieri tutti pagano_' (foreigners\r\nall pay), said a Venetian sexton; and that is the rule for universal\r\npractice throughout Europe. An order for roast beef at a restaurant will\r\nnot cover, as it does here and in England, potatoes and bread; they are\r\ncharged for extra; from three to five cents for a roll; six or eight for\r\npotatoes. Ice is too expensive a luxury everywhere across the seas to be\r\nthought of by the tourist limited in means. But if restaurants are dear,\r\nthe markets are cheap in Europe; and the people of the country usually\r\ncarry provisions with them. You may see ladies provided each with a\r\nsmall basket, from which are produced in the cars a bottle of _vin\r\nordinaire_ and water, rolls of bread, and slices of ham or tongue. These\r\nfurnish the simple but wholesome repast. Cream cheeses, delicious in\r\nquality, are to be procured in France and Italy, with cooked mutton\r\nchops, parts of roast fowl, sausage of fresh chicken and tongue, pork\r\nand mutton pies, etc., all obtainable fresh at provision stores. A bunch\r\nof grapes that will cost a franc (twenty cents) at the railway-station\r\nrefreshment room, may be had in the market for one or two cents; and\r\nother articles in proportion. The custom of the people, and the abundant\r\nprovision of such things, will suggest to the economical traveller a\r\nmethod of saving largely in his daily expenses. Those who like\r\ntea--which they cannot get well made on the Continent--had better take a\r\nspirit lamp and apparatus for making it in their rooms. But little\r\ntrouble is involved in thus providing for one's wants; the most is in\r\nmaking tea or coffee. Those in the habit of so living will save the\r\nexpensive hotel meals. In hotels, where there is a _table d'hóte_,\r\ndinner costs from three and a half francs (seventy cents) to five (a\r\ndollar). The breakfast consists merely of bread and _café au lait_,\r\nunless extras are ordered, and those are liberally charged for. Nowhere\r\nare travellers expected to pay for meals at hotels unless they choose to\r\ntake them. _Se non mangiate, non pagate_. ('If you eat nothing, you pay\r\nnothing.')\r\n\r\nThe prudent tourist will always bargain for the prices of rooms. In the\r\nfirst-class hotels on the Continent there are usually to be had upper\r\nrooms at thirty or forty cents a day. In second-class hotels in France\r\nand Italy a room may be obtained for twenty cents, the charge for\r\nservice being ten cents extra. Candles are always charged for\r\nseparately; in cheap rooms, ten cents; in higher priced, a franc each\r\nper night; the waiter being careful to remove the partially burned one.\r\nThe best plan is to carry wax candles in one's basket. Soap is never\r\nprovided, and is an expensive article when called for.\r\n\r\nIn Germany and Holland the price of a room per day is a florin or\r\nguilder--about forty-three cents. Living generally is higher than in\r\nItaly, but cooked provisions are abundant and excellent. Throughout\r\nEurope, you may be sure of clean beds and tables, no matter how\r\nuninviting the premises appear.\r\n\r\nOne half the cost of travel, and one's temper besides, may be saved by\r\ngoing in third-class carriages. On the Continent the second-class ones\r\nare as luxurious as the first, and are preferred by tourists generally.\r\nBut, except in having no cushions, the third class will prove\r\ncomfortable enough; the chance for seeing the country is rather better.\r\nHere the people of the country are met--chiefly the poorer class--very\r\ndecent in appearance, however, and invariably respectful and kind in\r\ntheir manners. A large number of monks and nuns will be found here, also\r\nwell-dressed ladies, who feel more protected than in the superior class\r\nof carriages. In the latter, indeed, one is exposed to various\r\nannoyances escaped in third-class carriages. The tourists, who abound,\r\nare often insolent and encroaching. A burly Englishman or stolid German\r\nwill not hesitate to turn a timid lady out of her seat; and if ladies\r\nhave no gentlemen with them, they may be insulted by rude staring or\r\nscornful looks from women provided with escorts or a little more finely\r\ndressed. All these causes of disturbance are escaped among the third\r\nclass, where the utmost deference is always shown to strangers.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, where Mrs. Grundy reigns with absolute sway, there is\r\na prejudice against the inferior classes of railway carriages, partially\r\novercome among the middle people of late, as far as the _second_ class\r\nis concerned; they dare not go in the third. But strangers may be more\r\nindependent, and may do as they please without reproach. There is\r\nnothing to choose in the way of comfortable accommodation between the\r\nsecond and third-class carriages in England; the latter are called\r\n'parliamentary,' on account of the governmental regulation compelling\r\nthe companies to run them, and fixing the fare at one penny (two cents)\r\na mile. Smoking is not permitted at all in England; on the Continent it\r\nis customary, even in first-class carriages and in diligences. When\r\ntravelling in the diligence or stage coach, secure, if possible, the\r\n_coupé_ or highest priced places. The front windows command a better\r\nview than the side ones of the interior; and where a better view can be\r\nhad, it is worth paying for. On the Mediterranean steamers take\r\nfirst-class places; the best are bad enough to be intolerable. The\r\nsecond cabins of the steamers crossing the British Channel are pretty\r\ngood for a short voyage.\r\n\r\nA copy which I am permitted to make from the diary of one who travelled\r\nwith some ladies last summer, from Paris to Florence in Italy and back,\r\ngives the entire cost of the trip--occupying a month--at $106.13. This\r\nestimate includes hotel fares, fees, carriage hire, etc., as well as\r\ntravelling expenses. A copy from the note book of a party who travelled\r\nover England and to Edinburgh and Glasgow--spending over two\r\nmonths--gives the sum total of that as $119.42. This includes fares to\r\nand from Paris ($5 second class), and board in Paris as well as in Great\r\nBritain. We may therefore put down the cost of a trip to Europe as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Passage (first class) on steamship\r\n    of New York, Philadelphia\r\n    and Liverpool line, from\r\n    New York to London      $80 00\r\n\r\n  Returning in same line (fifteen\r\n    guineas)      79 00\r\n\r\n  Travelling and board in Great\r\n    Britain and Paris     119 42\r\n\r\n  Tour on the Continent     106 13\r\n\r\n  Allow for stewards' fees, cabs,\r\n    omnibuses, and a few expenses\r\n    not noted     15 45\r\n\r\n  Total cost of European trip,      $400 00\r\n\r\nFees to guides, sextons, etc., on the Continent, seldom exceed a franc\r\n(twenty cents) each; half that, or a franc for a party, will often\r\nsuffice. If a church is open for service, nothing is to be paid. Gifts\r\nto guides in England average sixpence or an English shilling. The\r\ncustom of giving money to servants in private houses where one is\r\nentertained as a guest, is burdensome and unjust.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, board and lodging can be had at excellent houses, filled with\r\nfashionable guests, for a dollar a day, exclusive of a franc a week each\r\nto the maid and waiter. Arthur's celebrated family hotel, 9 Rue\r\nCastiglione, afforded accommodation to a party of three at this rate,\r\nwith a suite of rooms in the Rue St. Honoré, breakfast to order in the\r\nprivate parlor, the constant attendance of a servant, and dinner at the\r\nhotel _table d'hôte_. The party found their own candles. A party thus\r\ncan be as well accommodated as in one of the chief hotels. A single\r\ngentleman, who cares less for the elegancies of life, can have a\r\nfurnished room for seven dollars a month with attendance, or a room at a\r\ncheap hotel for a dollar a week, without meals.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the estimate of $400 for the cost of a tour\r\nabroad does not include the price of exchange at the present time, or\r\nany exchange. It is simply the amount paid out in our own currency. The\r\npurchases made by a tourist of clothing, curiosities, etc., are of\r\ncourse extra. The amount will provide for a tour extending to between\r\nfour and five months. Three or four weeks are allowed for in London, and\r\ntwo or three weeks in Paris. If the tour be extended and more time be\r\nconsumed, the additional expense may easily be calculated. Bradshaw's\r\n'Continental Guide' will give the exact cost and distance on the\r\nrailways; and for hotel expenses, lunches, and fees, a dollar a day will\r\nprovide the economical traveller. He will need no courier, nor, if he\r\nknows the language (French will do, but it is better also to understand\r\nItalian and German), a _valet de place_. Both are better dispensed with.\r\n\r\nOne word as to luggage. Let no traveller encumber himself or herself\r\nwith a trunk on the Continent. A valise or a carpet bag that can be\r\ncarried in the hand, will hold enough. Four or five changes of linen,\r\nand one dress, besides the travelling costume, are all sufficient.\r\nWashing can be done in a few hours anywhere. A lady had better wear a\r\ndress of strong dark stuff, and have a black silk for a change. She will\r\nneed no more, even if months are spent abroad. Even in England a trunk\r\nis a nuisance; for luggage cannot be checked, and continual care is\r\nnecessary. In some remote stations even labels cannot be had, and\r\nporters are scarce. I have known passengers, when no porters came to\r\ntake their trunks to the van, compelled to thrust them into the carriage\r\nat the last moment. The better plan is to have only what can be carried\r\nunder your own eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUCHING THE SOUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nReader, did it ever strike you that there are many theories touching\r\nthis soul of ours which are generally accepted as truths, without any\r\nthought whatever on the subject; so universally accepted, indeed, that\r\nit is considered a waste of time to think upon them at all; but which,\r\nupon a thorough investigation, might possibly lose some of their\r\nold-time infallibility, and the consideration of which might well repay\r\nthe trouble, by opening a field of thought at once interesting and\r\ninstructive?\r\n\r\nSuch there are, and in this province alone are we of this day and\r\ngeneration entirely controlled by the opinions of those over whose dust\r\ncenturies have rolled. We may speculate freely upon religion, and, while\r\nall must acknowledge that true religion is not progressive, new schemes\r\nof salvation spring almost daily into life from the brains of heretical\r\nthinkers, in their bold presumption stamping with error the simple faith\r\nof the primitive Christians. We may peer into the arcana of science and\r\nboldly question the theories of the learned of all ages. We may exhaust\r\nour mental powers upon points of political economy and the science of\r\ngovernment; and even the domain of ethics may be fearlessly invaded and\r\ncrowded with doubt. But into the unpretending pathway that leads to the\r\nsecret nooks of the soul, to the foundations of all spiritual\r\nexcellence, few feet may stray, and even those only to follow the beaten\r\ntrack worn by the feet of those olden thinkers whose very names have\r\nlong since passed into oblivion, lest by their deviations they should\r\noutrage some of those universal prejudices, whose only claim to\r\nconsideration is their traditionary origin.\r\n\r\nAnd this path is but little trodden in our day, for two reasons; first,\r\nbecause, to the careless eye, it possesses few attractions, and its\r\nclaims are lost in those of a more exciting and more eminently practical\r\ncourse of thought; secondly, because it seems to have been so thoroughly\r\nexplored that we have only to read the writings of those who have gone\r\nbefore, and listen to traditionary speculations, to learn all that can\r\nbe known about that which is our very existence, and, indeed, the only\r\n_true_ existence.\r\n\r\nTwo great mistakes. The dying philosopher, one of the wisest the world\r\nhas ever known, declared that all the knowledge he had gained was but as\r\na grain of sand upon the seashore. So all that is known to-day about the\r\nsoul is but a drop in the ocean of that great revealing which shall one\r\nday dawn upon man's spiritual existence. There is an infinite field yet\r\nunexplored--a very _terra incognita_ to even those who pride themselves\r\nupon being learned in the mysteries of the soul. And to him who ventures\r\nupon this seemingly lowly path, so far from proving unattractive, it\r\nbecomes a very Eden of thought. Unlooked-for beauties spring to light on\r\nevery side; the very essence of music and poesy float around him as he\r\nadvances; while above, around, and through all, sounds the magnificent\r\ndiapason of everlasting truth.\r\n\r\nTrue, there may be little of practical benefit--as the world defines\r\npracticality--in searching out the causes of the myriad emotions that\r\nsweep with lightning rapidity across the soul, now raising us to the\r\nsummit of bliss, now plunging us into the depths of despair--little of\r\npractical benefit in endeavoring to analyze the soul itself into its\r\nconstituent elements, and to bring ourselves face to face with our\r\nbetter, nobler selves, and with the Mighty Power which created us and\r\nall things. But there is, in this inner life, a pleasure higher and\r\nmore lasting than those evanescent ones which the world can afford, and\r\nwhich elevates and purifies as they do not. And aside from mere\r\npleasure, there is in such a study a practicability--taking the word in\r\na broader and nobler sense--which puts to the blush man's busy schemes\r\nfor wealth and honor. The beauties and sublimity of nature may indeed\r\nfill us with awe at the omnipotence of the mighty Architect, and with\r\nlove and gratitude for His goodness, but it is only in the presence of\r\nthe soul--His greatest work--that we realize the awful power of the\r\nCreator; it is only when threading the secret avenues of our own\r\nintellectual and spiritual being that we are brought into actual\r\ncommunion with God, and bow in adoration before Him who 'doeth all\r\nthings well.' Therefore, I maintain that he whose meditations run most\r\nin this channel is not only the happiest, but the purest man; that his\r\nviews of life are the broadest and noblest; that he it is who is most\r\nopen to the appeal of suffering or of sorrow; who is most ready to\r\nsacrifice self and work for the good of his fellow beings, and to\r\ndischarge faithfully his duty in that state of life to which it has\r\npleased God to call him.\r\n\r\nBut I am digressing into a prosy essay, which I did not intend, and\r\nneglecting that which I did intend, namely, to jot down a few theories\r\nwhich have crept into the brain of one not much given to musing.\r\n\r\nFor even I--a poor 'marching sub'--sitting here by a cheery coal grate,\r\nand watching the white smoke as it curls lazily up from the bowl of my\r\nmeerschaum, have theories touching the soul--theories born in the\r\nglowing coals and mounting in the curling smoke wreaths, but, unlike\r\nthem, growing more and more voluminous as they ascend, till I am like to\r\nbe lost in the ocean of speculations which my own musings have summoned\r\nup.\r\n\r\nI heard, to-night, a strain of weird, unearthly music, sweet and sad\r\nbeyond expression, but distant and fleeting. Yet long after it had\r\nceased, the chord that it awakened in my heart continued to vibrate as\r\nwith the echo of the strain which had departed. An unutterable,\r\nindescribable longing filled my soul--a vague yearning for something, I\r\nknew not what. My whole spiritual being seemed exalted to the clouds,\r\nyet restrained by some galling chain from the heaven it sought to enter.\r\nAnd then I asked myself, What is the secret of this mysterious power of\r\nmusic; where shall we look for the cause of those undefinable yet\r\noverwhelming emotions which it never fails to excite? A hopeless\r\nquestion it seemed, one which the philosophers of all ages have failed\r\nto solve, perhaps because they have not troubled themselves to inquire\r\nvery seriously about it; and again, perhaps it has baffled them as it\r\nhas me, and tens of thousands of others of the humbler portion of\r\nhumanity. And so I fell to dreaming after this wise:\r\n\r\nThe soul of man is created perfect, so far as regards the presence of\r\nevery faculty necessary for its development, for its happiness, or\r\nmisery, in this world or the next. Circumstances may alter it in degree,\r\nbut in its constituent elements never. The same yesterday, to-day, and\r\nto-morrow, at the moment of its creation and a thousand ages to come.\r\nNot even its passage from the body into its future and eternal home can\r\nendow it with a single new faculty, or eradicate one of the old. Yet\r\neach one of these faculties, capabilities, or sensibilities, is capable\r\nof development to an infinite degree. And in this development lies the\r\nsoul's progress to perfection; it is to go on, through all the ages of\r\nits eternal existence, constantly approaching the divine, yet never\r\nreaching the goal, like that space between two parallel lines, which\r\nmathematicians bisect to infinity. Certain of these faculties, of the\r\nvery existence of which even the soul itself is unconscious, are those\r\nwhose province lies purely in the world beyond, to which we all are\r\ntending. Never exerted in this life, with which they have nothing to do,\r\nthrough all the earthly existence they sleep quietly in their hidden\r\ncells; but when once the silver cord is loosed, and the freed spirit\r\nmounts into its native atmosphere, then these dormant powers and\r\nsusceptibilities are awakened from their slumbers, and take the lead in\r\nthe march of development, outstripping all others in the race, and soon\r\nbecoming the ruling powers of the soul. These are they which shall\r\nlisten to the music of heaven--these are the spiritual senses which\r\nshall hear and see and taste and feel those ineffable glories, of which\r\nour earthly pilgrimage has no appreciation, and which, if presented to\r\nus in the body, we could not perceive, nor, perceiving, comprehend.\r\nThese are they which shall worship and adore, comprehending the glory of\r\nOmnipotence, and drinking in and pouring out the full stream of divine\r\nand never-failing love and gratitude.\r\n\r\nReader, did you ever listen to the sympathetic vibrations of a musical\r\nstring? Place in the corner of your room a guitar--it matters not if it\r\nhave but a single string, that alone is sufficient for the\r\nexperiment--then, sitting at some distance from it, sing, shout, or play\r\nupon some loud-toned instrument, or, beginning at the foot of the\r\nchromatic scale, sound, round and full, each semitone in succession and\r\nat separate intervals. The instrument is mute to every note until you\r\nstrike the one to which the guitar string is attuned; then indeed, the\r\nspirit of melody imprisoned within the musical string recognizes its\r\nkindred sound, and springs sweetly forth to meet it. You pause, and a\r\nlow, sweet strain sighs softly through the room, as if a zephyr had\r\nswept the string, dying gently away like the faintest breathing of the\r\nevening breeze. Repeat the note, and louder than at first, and again its\r\ncounterpart replies, swelling higher than before, as if in gentle\r\nremonstrance that you should deem it necessary to call again to that\r\nwhich has already replied.\r\n\r\nEven so it is with these hidden faculties or susceptibilities of which I\r\nhave been speaking. In the notes of witching music, in the numbers of\r\npoesy, in the sight of beauty, either of nature or of art, either\r\næsthetic or moral, these silent powers recognize a faint approximation\r\nto that beauty with which they will have to do in that world where they\r\nshall be called into action: they too recognize the kindred spirit, and,\r\nspringing forward to meet it, vibrate in unison with the chord. But yet,\r\nrestrained by their prison of clay, bound down by the immutable law\r\nwhich bids them wait their time, their great deep is but troubled, and\r\nwhile, from their swaying and surging, a delicious emotion spreads over\r\nthe soul, filling the whole being with indescribable joy, it is an\r\nemotion which we cannot fathom, vague and undefined, at which we wonder\r\neven while we enjoy. To each and all of us the doors of heaven are\r\nclosed for the present; we never have heard the songs of the celestial\r\nspheres, and how should we recognize their echo here on earth, even\r\nthough that echo is swelling through our own hearts? And the sadness and\r\nyearning which such emotions invariably produce, may they not be the\r\nyearning for heaven's supernal beauty, and sadness for the chains which\r\nbar us from its full realization? Or is it the reflex of the struggles\r\nand the disappointment of that portion of the spirit which I have\r\nassigned as the mover of the emotion itself?\r\n\r\nCarry still further the parallel of the vibrating string, and we shall\r\nillustrate the different _degrees_ of emotion. It is only by sounding a\r\nnote in exact unison with that to which the string is attuned that we\r\nget the full force of the sympathetic vibration, which is more or less\r\ndistinct according as we approach or depart from the keynote, till we\r\nreach the semitone above or below, when it ceases altogether. Even so do\r\nour emotions increase in exact proportion as the exciting cause\r\napproaches perfection--according as the beauty heard or seen or felt\r\napproaches the heavenly keynote. A simple ballad awakens a quiet\r\npleasure, while the magnificent symphonies of Beethoven or Mozart fill\r\nthe soul with a rapture with which the former feeling is no more to be\r\ncompared than the brooklet with the ocean; for the latter is\r\ninexpressibly nearer to its heavenly model.\r\n\r\nCarry out the theory to its legitimate result, and we shall see that if\r\nit were possible to produce, here on earth, music equal to that which\r\nrings through the celestial arches--if it were possible here to create\r\nbeauty in any form, which should fully equal that which shall greet the\r\nfreed spirit on its entrance into that better world, then indeed would\r\nour emotions reach their highest possible climax; then indeed should we\r\nhear and see and feel, not with the bodily senses, but with the senses\r\nof the soul; then would there be no vagueness, no sadness in the feeling\r\nas now, but clear and well defined would be our knowledge, comprehending\r\nall spiritual things. Then would our heaven be here on earth, and we\r\nshould desire no other. Wisely has a great and merciful God thrown an\r\nimpenetrable veil between the soul and its future belongings, and\r\nclipped its wings lest it soar too soon.\r\n\r\nSo much for a simple strain of music. A trifling matter, perhaps you\r\nwill say, to make so much talk about. Not quite so trifling as you may\r\nthink, however; for a single musical chord is a more important and\r\ncomplex thing than to the careless ear it would seem. Who ever cares to\r\n_study_ a single chord of music? And yet how few are there who know that\r\nit is composed of not three or four but a myriad of separate and\r\ndistinct sounds, appreciable in exact proportion to the cultivation of\r\nthe ear? The uncultivated ear perceives but the three or four primitive\r\nor fundamental notes of the chord, while, to the nicer perception, the\r\nmore delicate susceptibility of the ear trained by long study and\r\npractice to analyze all musical sounds, come harmonic above harmonic,\r\nsounds of melody above, beneath, and beyond the few prime motors which\r\nact as the nucleus to the gush of tiny harmony which fills the\r\near--sounds clear and distinct, yet blending in perfect order and\r\nsymmetry with their fundamental notes, and partaking so much of their\r\ncharacter and following with such unerring certainty their direction as\r\nto become voiceless to the ear unskilled.\r\n\r\nAnd why should this not be so? Is it not reasonable to suppose that the\r\ncurrent of undulations in the atmosphere producing these united sounds\r\nshould communicate its agitation in some degree to the circumambient\r\nair, creating thousands of delicate ramifications branching off in all\r\npossible directions from the main channel, yet all partaking of its\r\npeculiar character, and becoming in themselves separate sounds, yet\r\nconsonant and harmonious?\r\n\r\nAh! could we but _see_ the vibrations of the atmosphere which a single\r\nmusical chord produces--the rolling bass, the gliding alto, the sweeping\r\nsoprano, and the soaring tenor, rolling onward in one broad channel of\r\nharmony, with its myriad tributary streams of thirds and fifths, and its\r\ncurling, twinkling, shifting, blending, soaring mists of delicate-toned\r\nharmonics, how would our enjoyment of music be enhanced! how would both\r\neye and ear be delighted, enraptured with the poetry of motion, the\r\nharmony of sound, the eternal and indestructible order and concord and\r\nconsonance of both sight and sound! But this is reserved for the\r\nexperience of pure spirit--this is reserved to enhance the beauty of the\r\ncelestial realm. Some day we shall see and hear and know it all--some\r\nday in that heavenly future, when the soul of man shall converse and\r\npraise and adore in one blended strain of æsthetic beauty, which shall\r\ncontain within itself the essence of all music and poesy and enraptured\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThinking thus earnestly about the soul, one comes naturally to speculate\r\nupon the question of the spirit's return to earth after its final\r\ndeparture from the body. It is a beautiful belief that the souls of our\r\ndeparted friends are permitted to hover around us here on earth,\r\nwatching all our outgoings and incomings, sympathizing in all our joys\r\nand sorrows, mourning over our transgressions, and rejoicing at our good\r\ndeeds--in a word, acting the parts of guardian angels. And there are\r\nmany, even in our day, who hold such a faith. Yet it is a belief founded\r\nin imagination and poetic ideas of beauty, rather than in sober truth\r\neither of reason or of revelation. The strongest argument I have ever\r\nheard against this belief is contained in the remark of a poor old\r\nEnglish peasant. 'Sir,' said he, 'I doan't believe the speerits can come\r\nback to us; for if they go to the good place, they doan't want to come\r\nback 'ere again; and if they goes to the bad place, why God woan't let\r\n'em.' There was more philosophy in the remark than he knew of, and I\r\nhave not yet found the philosopher who did not stagger under it.\r\n\r\nBut there is another view of the subject. I hold that the bodily senses\r\ncan only perceive material things; and the spirit spiritual things; and\r\nhence, that, admitting the actual presence of disembodied spirits,\r\nneither could we perceive them, nor they us, as material bodies. They\r\nmight, indeed, perceive the souls within us, but could only be cognizant\r\nof our actions as those of pure spirit; while we, blinded by the\r\nimpenetrable screen of the body, would be debarred of even this\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nFor through only three of the bodily senses--sight, hearing, and\r\nfeeling--have the boldest of so-called spiritualists dared to attempt\r\nthe proof of their doctrine. To begin with the latter, the essential\r\nquality of the sense of feeling is _resistance_, without which there can\r\nbe no perception. And what is resistance? In one class of cases it is\r\nsimply the _vis inertiæ_ of matter: in the other and only remaining one,\r\nthe opposition of some material matter to the force of gravity. Even the\r\nperception of the lightest zephyr depends upon the resistance of the\r\natmosphere. Does spirit possess this quality of resistance? The argument\r\non this head is closed the moment the distinction is made between\r\nmaterial things and spiritual.\r\n\r\nIf the wave theory of light and sound be correct--and it is so generally\r\naccepted that few writers dare risk their reputations in the defence of\r\nany other--the senses of sight and hearing come, for the purposes of\r\nthis argument, in the same category. Nothing can affect the ear which is\r\nnot capable of producing vibration in the atmosphere, which may be\r\nconsidered, in comparison with pure spirit, a material substance. Here\r\nagain the argument is clinched by the mere distinction between matter\r\nand spirit, the one being the very antipodes of and incapable of acting\r\nupon the other.\r\n\r\nNatural science tells us that the white light of the sun is composed of\r\nthe seven colors of the spectrum in combination, which colors may be\r\nreadily separated by the refraction of the prism. All objects possess,\r\nin a greater or less degree, the power of decomposing light and\r\nabsorbing colors. Now a ray of sunlight falling upon any given object is\r\nin a measure decomposed, a portion of its integral colors is absorbed,\r\nand the remainder or complementary colors thrown off--reflected upon the\r\neye, producing by their combination what we call the color of the\r\nobject. Thus, a ray thrown upon a pure white object is absorbed not at\r\nall, but wholly reflected as it came, and the consequence is the proper\r\ncombination upon the retina of all the colors, producing--a white\r\nobject. On the contrary, a ray falling upon what we call a _black_\r\nobject, is wholly absorbed, and the consequence is a total absence of\r\nlight, or blackness. So a red object absorbs all the orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, indigo, and violet of the sunlight, reflecting upon the eye\r\nonly the red, which is perceived as the color of the object. And so on\r\nthrough all the combinations of the spectrum. Only material substances\r\ncan either absorb or reflect: therefore is spirit again excluded; for\r\nhow can it act upon the eye save through those agencies with reference\r\nto which the eye itself was constructed, and which, as we have shown, it\r\ncannot possibly affect? To sum up the whole argument in a single\r\nsentence, the physical senses are dependent, for their perceptions,\r\nentirely upon the action of matter, and hence spirit, which is not\r\nmatter, can in no way affect them.\r\n\r\nBut here we are met by the record of Holy Writ, which declares that in\r\nthose former times spirits did often appear to men. Aye! and so there\r\nwere miracles in those days. But all these things are done away with.\r\nMoreover did not those spirits find it necessary in every case to clothe\r\nthemselves with the image of some _living form_ in order to make\r\nthemselves perceptible to human eyes? So that it was really the form\r\nwithin which the spirit was ensconced that was perceived, and not the\r\nspirit itself. And how shall we know what _gases_ of the physical world\r\nthese spirits were permitted, through a special interposition of the\r\nDeity and for the furtherance of His divine ends, to assemble together\r\ninto a concrete form for their temporary dwelling and as a medium\r\nthrough which to communicate with man? And who is so irreverent as to\r\nsuppose that God would now, in these days, give spirits special\r\npermission to return to earth and take upon themselves such forms for\r\nthe mere purpose of tipping tables and piano-fortes, rapping upon doors,\r\nwindows, and empty skulls, misspelling their own names, and murdering\r\nLindley Murray, and performing clownish tricks for the amusement of a\r\ngaping crowd?\r\n\r\nBut whence arises this great delusion? Simply from our total lack of\r\nknowledge of the glory of that heaven upon which we all hope to enter.\r\n'Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the\r\nimagination of man to conceive' the glory of God, the splendor, the\r\nmagnificence, the supernal beauty of the Celestial. We know indeed that\r\nwe shall enter upon a world whose immensity, whose sublimity, whose\r\nawful beauty shall far surpass the experience of man; but not even the\r\nwildest imagination, fed by all the knowledge that astronomers have\r\ngained of world beyond world, and system beyond system, of spheres to\r\nwhich our world is but a speck, and of fiery meteors and whizzing comets\r\nsweeping their way with the speed of thought for thousands of years\r\nthrough planet-teeming space--not even such an imagination, in its\r\nfarthest stretch, is able to conceive the glory of that dwelling place\r\nwhich shall be ours. If to-day we were permitted to peer but for a\r\nmoment into that heavenly abode, then should we see how impossible, to\r\nthe soul which has once entered upon that beatific state, would be a\r\nthought of return to this grovelling earth. There their aspirations are\r\never upward and onward toward the Great White Throne, with no thought\r\nfor the things left behind, even were there not a 'great gulf fixed'\r\nbetween earth and heaven.\r\n\r\nAnd how often do we hear the opinion expressed that the souls of the\r\njust do pass, 'in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,' from the things\r\nof earth to the full burst of heavenly beauty and sublimity, shooting\r\nlike the lightning's flash from its prison house of clay to the presence\r\nof its God. Reasoning from analogy, which, in this connection, where\r\nboth experience and revelation are dumb, is the only basis we can rest\r\nupon, such a passage would be to the soul instant annihilation; the\r\nshock would be too great for even its enlarged susceptibilities. It must\r\nbecome gradually accustomed to the new sights and sounds, and so pass\r\nslowly up from one stage of perception and knowledge to another in\r\nregular gradation, to the climax of its revelation.\r\n\r\nReader, did you ever come suddenly from a darkened room into the full\r\nblaze of noonday? In such a case the eye is dazzled, blinded for a\r\nmoment, and must gradually accommodate itself to the unaccustomed light\r\nbefore its gaze can be clear and steady. So, too, the ear long shut up\r\nin profound silence is deafened by an ordinary sound. Even so the soul,\r\nsuddenly entering upon the unaccustomed and stupendous sights and sounds\r\nof the spiritual world, would be blinded, dazzled, as I have said, to\r\nannihilation. It is necessary that its newly awakened faculties, which\r\nduring its long earthly life have lain in a comatose state, should not\r\nbe too suddenly called into action, lest they be overpowered by the\r\nawful revelation. Like the bodily senses, they require time and gentle\r\nthough steadily increasing action to develop them, and assimilate them\r\nto their new surroundings in their new field of action.\r\n\r\nAnd this is my theory. The soul, when freed from the body, floats gently\r\nupward, _deaf_, _dumb_, and _blind_--paralyzed, as it were, into a state\r\nof neutral existence. Splendid sights may spread around it, wave after\r\nwave of eternal sound may roll in upon it, but it sees not, hears not,\r\nfeels not, not having yet acquired the new faculties of perception.\r\nAfter a certain space of time--which may be days or weeks or months in\r\nduration--through its secret chambers steals a thrill of sentient\r\nemotion; it recognizes its own existence, and the dawn of that eternal\r\nlife for which it was created. Slowly one sight after another begins\r\nfaintly to glimmer before it, as objects emerge from the gloom of some\r\ndarkened cell to eyes that are becoming accustomed to the darkness.\r\nAnon, low, faint murmurs of sound steal in upon it, far distant at\r\nfirst, but gradually swelling as it approaches, till at last, around the\r\nfreed spirit peals the full orchestral glory of eternity. And so it goes\r\non, passing slowly from stage to stage, apprehending new sights, new\r\nsounds, and comprehending new truths. And so it shall go on, through all\r\nthe cycles of eternity, constantly approaching nearer to the Godhead,\r\nyet never to become God.\r\n\r\nDo you ask me how can these things be? Let us draw an illustration from\r\nnature. The science of acoustics tells us that an organ pipe of a\r\ncertain length gives forth the deepest, or as musicians would say, the\r\n_lowest_ sound that art can produce; that all beyond this given length\r\nis nothingness, and gives out no sound. What shall we say then? that\r\ndoubling the length of the tube destroys the vibration of the imprisoned\r\nair? Nay, verily, the air still vibrates, sound is still produced, but\r\n_the note is below the gamut of the natural ear_, which was created to\r\ncomprehend only sounds within a certain compass: its capacity goes no\r\nfarther, and any sound pitched either above or below that compass we\r\ncannot perceive. In proof of this is the simple fact that a cultivated\r\near--that is, an ear of enlarged capacity, can readily catch the\r\nfaintest harmonics of a guitar, to which others are totally deaf.\r\n\r\nAgain: I have stood by the Falls of Niagara, and listened in vain for\r\nthat deep, unearthly roar of which so much has been written and sung.\r\nThe rush and the gurgle of the waters was there, the sweeping surge of\r\nthe mighty river, but Niagara's hollow roar was absent. Again and again\r\nmy ears were stretched to catch the awful sound, till the effort became\r\nalmost painful, but in vain. And yet the sound was present, ay!\r\neternally present, but the note was just beyond the gamut of my ear.\r\nStanding thus for some moments, gazing and listening with the most\r\nearnest attention, nature, through her hidden laws, wrought a miracle\r\nin my person. The long-continued strain enlarged the capacity of the\r\near, even as the muscles of the arm are strengthened by frequent and\r\nenergetic action, or as a faculty of the mind itself is developed by\r\nexercise. Lower and lower sank the scale of my aural conceptions, till,\r\nas it approached the keynote of the cataract, a low murmur began to\r\nsteal in upon me, deeper than the deepest thunder tones, and seemingly a\r\nthousand miles distant. Louder and louder it swelled, nearer and nearer\r\nit approached as the hearing faculty sank downward, till the keynote was\r\nreached, and then--the rush and gurgle of the waters was swept away, and\r\nin its place resounded the awful tones of earth's deepest _basso\r\nprofundo_. Then for the first time I realized the terrible sublimity of\r\nNiagara--the voice of God speaking audibly through one of the mightiest\r\nworks of His creation.\r\n\r\nAnd as, musing, I moved away from the appalling scene, the thought\r\nrushed into my mind that perhaps my experience of a few moments might be\r\nthat of the soul when entering upon the sublimities of the future state.\r\nHence my theory, which may go for what it is worth, or, as the Yankees\r\nwould say, is 'good for what it will bring.'\r\n\r\nReader, do you never feel an intense longing to live over again the\r\nscenes of your youth? to begin at some certain period long gone by, and\r\ntaste again the sweets that have passed away forever? It is one of the\r\nbitterest feelings of the heart that years are slipping away from us one\r\nby one; that the delights of our youth have gone, never to return, and\r\nthat we 'shall not look upon their like again;' that the days are fast\r\ncoming on when we shall say we have no pleasure in them, and that we are\r\nrapidly verging upon the 'lean and slippered pantaloon.' Were there any\r\nfuture rejuvenation, when we might stand again upon the threshold of\r\nlife and look over its fair fields with all the joy and hope of\r\nanticipation, old age would lose all its dreariness, and become but a\r\nbrief though painful pilgrimage through which we were to pass to joy\r\nbeyond. But since this can never be, old age is the rust which dims the\r\nbrightness of every earthly joy, and is looked forward to by youth only\r\nwith a shudder.\r\n\r\nHundreds of bold and daring navigators have left their bones to whiten\r\namid the snows and ice of the arctic regions, lured thither by the\r\nthirst of fame or of knowledge, in the pursuit of science, and in search\r\nof the Northwest Passage. But suppose some more fortunate adventurer\r\nshould discover there, even at the very pole itself, a veritable\r\n'fountain of youth and beauty,' whose rejuvenating waters could restore\r\nthe elasticity of youth to the frame of age, smoothing away its\r\nwrinkles, and imprinting the bloom of childhood upon its cheeks,\r\nbringing back the long-lost freshness and buoyancy to the soul; would\r\nnot the navigators of those dangerous seas be multiplied in the ratio of\r\na million to one? Should we not all become Ponce de Leons, braving every\r\ndanger, submitting to every privation, sacrificing wealth, fame,\r\neverything, in quest of the precious boon? What a hecatomb of mouldering\r\nbones would bestrew those fields of ice! For though not one in ten\r\nthousand might reach the promised goal, the hegira would still go on\r\ntill the end of time, each deluded mortal hoping that he might be that\r\nhappy, fortunate one. As the dying millionnaire would give all that he\r\npossesses for one moment of time, so would all mankind throw every\r\npresent blessing into the scale, in the hope of drawing the prize in\r\nthat great lottery.\r\n\r\nThere is a fountain of youth and beauty open to every soul beneath the\r\nsun: there is a rejuvenation both to soul and body, which shall not only\r\nrestore all the freshness of the bygone days, but also the joys of the\r\npast, a thousandfold brighter and dearer, and that by a process which\r\nwill not need repeating, for that youth will be eternal. I am using no\r\nmetaphor now, but speaking of that which is actual and tangible. There\r\nis such a fount, but not here: it gushes in the courts of that house not\r\nmade with hands, eternal in the heavens. For the soul, at the moment of\r\nits separation from the body, enters upon a new life, whose course shall\r\nbe exactly the reverse of that of earth, for it shall constantly\r\nincrease in all the attributes of youth. There will be no dimming of the\r\nfaculties, but a continual brightening; no grieving over an\r\nirrecoverable past, but a constant rejoicing over joys present and to\r\ncome. There will be no past there, but a present more tangible than\r\nthis, which is ever slipping from us, and a future far brighter and more\r\ncertain than any that earth can afford. Strange that men should fail to\r\nlook at heaven in this light! For thoughtless youth, to whom the world\r\nis new and bright, and pleasure sparkles with a luring gleam, there is\r\nsome little palliation for neglect of the things of heaven; but what\r\nshall we say of him who has passed the golden bound, for whom all giddy\r\npleasures have lost their glow, and nought remains but the cares and\r\nanxieties of life? Of what worth is earthly pleasure to him who has\r\nalready drained its cup to the dregs? Of what worth is wealth and honor\r\nto the frame that has already begun to descend the slope of time? All\r\nthese baubles would be gladly sacrificed for the return of that youth\r\nwhich has passed away; and shall they not be given up for that eternal\r\nyouth which shall not pass away? We mourn for departed loved ones, but\r\nwhat would be our grief and despair if death were annihilation--if we\r\nknew that we should never meet them again in all eternity? But we feel\r\nthat in heaven the olden love shall be renewed; that the forms that now\r\nare mouldering in the dust shall be recognized and greeted there, and\r\nthat the friendships created here shall ripen there in close\r\ncompanionship through never-ending cycles; and thus is death robbed of\r\nhalf its terrors.\r\n\r\nBut the way to this fount is through a straight and narrow gate, and\r\n'few there be who find it.'\r\n\r\nAlas! how unsatisfactory are even the choicest blessings of life! Wealth\r\nbrings only care, and the millionnaire toils all his life for--his food\r\nand clothes and lodging; dies unregretted, and is soon forgotten. Honor\r\nbrings not content, and does but increase the thirst it seeks to\r\nassuage. The poor and the unknown are generally happier than the wealthy\r\nand famous. 'Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, all is vanity and\r\nvexation of spirit;' and what was true of human nature when 'the\r\npreacher' wrote, is true to-day. Admit that life is but a succession of\r\npleasures that can never pall, and the world one vast Elysian field, and\r\nthat the care of the soul requires the abnegation of every delight, and\r\nspreads a gloomy pall over all the brightness of earth; yet even in that\r\ncase, a life wholly devoted to spiritual interests were but a weary,\r\ntemporary pilgrimage, which we should gladly endure for a season, in the\r\nhope of the golden crown and never-ending bliss in the world beyond,\r\ncould we but look upon the future life in the light of _reality_. Ah!\r\nthere is the difficulty, for we are 'of the earth earthy,' and, although\r\nwe may fervently _believe_, cannot comprehend, cannot _realize_\r\neternity. To too many Christians of the present day eternity, heaven,\r\nGod, are not a tangible reality, but rather a poetic dream, floating in\r\nthe atmosphere of faith, but which their minds cannot grasp. Hence they\r\nworship an idea rather than a reality.\r\n\r\nThe noblest pleasures of life, in fact the only real, permanent,\r\nexalting, and, I might add, _developing_ pleasures, are divided into two\r\nclasses, those of the heart, and those of the intellect. Yet both,\r\nthough different in their action, spring from the same central truth.\r\n\r\nThe happiest man is he whose life is spent in doing good, seeking no\r\nother reward than the gratification of beholding the true happiness of\r\nhis fellow beings. His pleasures are of the heart, and he only is the\r\ntrue Christian of our day and generation. For he who so ardently loves\r\nhis fellow men cannot but love his God.\r\n\r\nThe pleasures of the intellect can never pall, but do constantly\r\nincrease and brighten, because in them the soul enters its native\r\nprovince and acts in that sphere which is its own for all eternity. Yet\r\nhow do they all lead the mind up to its great Creator! Not a single\r\ndiscovery in science, not an investigation of the simplest law of\r\nnature, not an examination of the most insignificant bud or flower or\r\nleaf; and, above and beyond all, not an inquiry in the great truths of\r\nmorals, of ethics, of religion, or of the very constitution of the mind\r\nitself, but at once, and in the most natural consequence, reveals the\r\npower and the goodness of God--brings God himself as clearly before us\r\nas he _can_ be manifested to our fettered souls. Yet if these pleasures\r\ntoo were but temporary, if they were to pass from our sight with all our\r\nother earthly surroundings, the pursuit of them would but beget disgust\r\nand discontent, and they would be classed with the fragile things which\r\nawaken no feelings of awe, nor enhance the glory of the soul. But thank\r\nGod! they will endure forever. Truth is eternal--its origin is coeval\r\nwith the Creator, and, like Him, it shall have no end.\r\n\r\nHence all real pleasure is from God himself, and leads directly back to\r\nhim again. And he who, appreciating the truest joy of existence here,\r\nmakes such themes his study, should and will seek the only prolongation\r\nof those delights which shall carry them alone of all life's blessings\r\nwith him across the dark river, in the worship and adoration of that\r\nomnipotent Being from whose hand these gifts descend, who alone can\r\nperpetuate them when time shall have passed away--that God who 'doeth\r\nall things well.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHAPLAIN FULLER: Being a Life Sketch of a New England\r\n     Clergyman and Army Chaplain. By Richard F. Fuller. Boston: Walker,\r\n     Wise & Co., 245 Washington street.\r\n\r\n  \"I must do something for my country.\"\r\n\r\nA remarkable record of a remarkable man. A distinguished member of a\r\ndistinguished family, a gentleman, scholar, patriot, hero, and\r\nChristian, bravely dying for humanity and country--such was Arthur B.\r\nFuller.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, in the few lines allotted to editorials, to give\r\nany just idea of the exceeding interest and merit of this sketch. A. B.\r\nFuller, under peculiar circumstances of emergency and danger,\r\n_volunteered_ to cross the Rappahannock, December 11, 1862. It was of\r\ngreat importance then to prove that the Federal army was composed of\r\nstrong and patriotic hearts, and he was revered and idolized by our\r\nbrave soldiers. 'It was a duty which could not be required of him. And\r\nfor one of his profession to consistently engage in this enterprise\r\nwould prove his strong conviction that it was a work so holy, so\r\nacceptable to God, that even those set apart for sanctuary service might\r\nfeel called to have a hand in it. His prowess, brave as he was, was\r\nnothing; it was not his unpractised right _arm_, but his _heart_ which\r\nhe devoted to the service, and which would tell on the result, not\r\nmerely of that special enterprise, nor of that battle only, but, by\r\naffording a powerful proof of love of country outweighing considerations\r\nof safety and life, would have the influence which a living example, and\r\nonly a living example, can have.' He knew the full amount of the danger\r\nto be encountered, and, being of a race which numbers no cowards among\r\nthem, he steadily looked it in the face. Captain Dunn says: 'We came\r\nover in boats, and were in advance of the others who had crossed. We had\r\nbeen here but a few minutes when Chaplain Fuller accosted me with his\r\nusual military salute. He had a musket in his hand, and said: 'Captain,\r\nI must do something for my country. What shall I do?' I replied that\r\nthere never was a better time than the present, and he could take his\r\nplace on my left. I thought he could render valuable aid, because he was\r\nperfectly cool and collected. Had he appeared at all excited, I should\r\nhave rejected his services, for coolness is of the first importance with\r\nskirmishers, and one excited man has an unfavorable influence upon\r\nothers. I have seldom seen a person on the field so calm and mild in his\r\ndemeanor, evidently not acting from impulse or martial rage.\r\n\r\n'His position was directly in front of a grocery store. He fell in five\r\nminutes after he took it, having fired once or twice. He was killed\r\ninstantly, and did not move after he fell. I saw the flash of the rifle\r\nwhich did the deed.'\r\n\r\n  'He died, but to a noble cause\r\n    His precious life was given!\r\n  He died, but he has left behind\r\n    A shining path to heaven!'\r\n\r\nHis labors as a pastor were devout, humane, and full of self-abnegation.\r\nNo single line of sectarianism blurs with its bitterness this fair\r\nrecord of a blameless life, devoted from its earliest days to God and\r\ncountry. 'Better still give up our heart's blood in brave battle than\r\ngive up our principles in cowardly compromise! I must do something for\r\nmy country!' Bold and brave words of Arthur B. Fuller's, which he sealed\r\nin his blood! This 'life sketch' is published in the hope that it may be\r\nof advantage to the family of the chaplain, to whose benefit its\r\npecuniary avails are devoted. And shame would it be to the heart of this\r\ngreat nation if this record of a brave, true man were not thoroughly\r\naccepted by it. May the good seed of it be sown broadcast through our\r\nland, planting the germs of patriotism, self-sacrifice, virtue, and\r\nChristian faith in every heart.\r\n\r\nWe earnestly commend the book to our readers. May the high estimation in\r\nwhich this Christian hero is held by the country of his love soothe in\r\nsome degree the anguish of his bereaved family!\r\n\r\n     A FIRST LATIN COURSE. By William Smith, LL.D. Edited by H.\r\n     Drisler, A.M. 12mo, pp. 186. Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nThis is an elementary class-book, and the name of the profound scholar\r\nstanding upon its title-page will at once commend it to all intelligent\r\nteachers. It is the first of a series intended to simplify the study of\r\nthe Latin language, in which will be combined the advantages of the\r\nolder and modern methods of instruction. The experienced author has\r\nlabored, by a philosophical series of repetitions, to enable the\r\nbeginner to fix declensions and conjugations thoroughly in his memory,\r\nto learn their usage by the constructing of simple sentences as soon as\r\nhe commences the study of the language, and to accumulate gradually a\r\nstock of useful words. This is, surely, the only method to make a dead\r\nlanguage live in the mind of a pupil.\r\n\r\n     A TEXT-BOOK OF PENMANSHIP, containing all the established\r\n     rules and principles of the art, with rules for Punctuation,\r\n     Direction, and Forms for Letter Writing: to which are added a brief\r\n     History of Writing, and Hints on Writing Materials, &c., &c., for\r\n     Teachers and Pupils. By H. W. Ellsworth, teacher of Penmanship in\r\n     the public schools of New York city, and for several years teacher\r\n     of Bookkeeping, Penmanship, and Commercial Correspondence in\r\n     Bryant, Stratton & Co.'s Chain of Mercantile Colleges. D. Appleton\r\n     & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThose accustomed to the wearisome labor of deciphering illegible\r\nhandwriting will welcome the appearance of any 'standard text-book\r\nenabling all to become tolerable writers.' What a desideratum! Let the\r\ndisappointment over manuscripts frequently rejected, simply because\r\nillegible, and the despair of printers, tell. The book before us seems\r\nwell adapted to attain the end it proposes. The writer says: 'This work\r\nis no creation of a leisure hour, but a careful elaboration of\r\n_practical_ notes, taken in the midst of active duties. The materials of\r\nwhich it is made are facts, not embodied in our school books, which it\r\nappeared important for all to know, together with conclusions drawn from\r\nthem, and answers to questions of practical interest, which have arisen\r\nin the course of my school and after experience, to which no books\r\nwithin ordinary reach could afford satisfactory explanation. These facts\r\nand observations have gradually accumulated till it has occurred to me\r\nthat a compilation of them, properly arranged, might prove as acceptable\r\nto other inquirers as such a work would have been to myself.'\r\n\r\nThis book is full of valuable information in all that relates to the\r\nabused and neglected art of penmanship, and we cordially recommend it to\r\nschools, teachers, and pupils.\r\n\r\n     ANNETTE; OR, THE LADY OF THE PEARLS. By Alexander Dumas\r\n     (the younger), author of 'La Dame aux Camelias; or, Camille, the\r\n     Camellia Lady.' Translated by Mrs. W. R. A. Johnson. Frederick A.\r\n     Brady, publisher and bookseller, 24 Ann street, New York.\r\n\r\nA novel in the Eugene Sue, Dumas, father and son, style. The plot is\r\ncomplicated, and the translation flowing and spirited. The novels of\r\nthis school are peculiar. No sense of right and wrong ever seems to dawn\r\nupon their heroes or heroines; no intimations of an outraged Decalogue\r\never add the least embarrassment to the difficulties of their position.\r\nThe events grow entirely out of human incidents, passions, and\r\ninterests--conscience has no part to play in the involved drama. After\r\npassing through seas of _naïve_ intrigue and _innocent_ vice, we are\r\nquite astonished at the close of 'The Lady of the Pearls' to be landed\r\nupon a short moral.\r\n\r\n     POLITICAL FALLACIES: An Examination of the False\r\n     Assumptions, and Refutation of the Sophistical Reasonings, which\r\n     have brought on this Civil War. By George Junkin, D.D., LL.D. New\r\n     York: Chas. Scribner, 124 Grand street. 1863.\r\n\r\nDr. Junkin is one of the noble band of patriots who have preferred\r\nleaving friends, comfortable homes, and honorable positions, to ceding\r\nself-respect, and polluting conscience by yielding to the tyrannical\r\nrequisitions of local prejudice or usurped authority. He is the\r\nfather-in-law of 'Stonewall' Jackson, and, during twelve years, was\r\nPresident of Washington College, Lexington, Va. In May, 1861, he left\r\nthat institution and came North. Rebellion had entered the fair\r\nprecincts of learning, misleading alike young and old, and prompting to\r\nacts incompatible with the president's high sense of duty and loyalty.\r\nNo course was left him but to resign. His book is a clear and upright\r\nexamination into the so-called 'right of secession, and, while there\r\nare some minor points one might feel inclined to discuss, the main\r\narguments are so ably, truthfully, and yet kindly advanced, that we\r\nheartily recommend the book to the perusal of all desirous of obtaining\r\nsound views on the much-mooted questions of the authority of legitimate\r\ngovernment, and the proper understanding of State and National rights.\r\nThe eighteenth chapter contains some home truths for those who think\r\nthat religion, consequently Christian morality, has nothing to do with\r\nthe rulers or the ruling of a great nation. Slavery has had its share in\r\nthe production of the 'great rebellion,' but the slavery question would\r\nhave been powerless to disrupt the Union had not erroneous and\r\nmischievous ideas been generally current, both South and North,\r\nregarding the source and meaning of government, its legitimate purposes,\r\npowers, and rights. While individual men have been striving to persuade\r\nthemselves that, because they formed a certain minute portion of the\r\ngoverning power, they were hence at liberty to resist the lawful\r\nexercise of that power, the people--the real people--have gradually been\r\nlosing their proper weight and authority, have been surrendering\r\nthemselves, bound hand and foot, to noisy demagogues, petty cliques, or\r\ncorrupt party organizations. How many examine facts, consider\r\nprinciples, and vote accordingly? How few are willing to step out of the\r\nnarrow circle of prejudice or mediocrity surrounding them, and bestow\r\nresponsible places on those whose integrity and ability seem best fitted\r\nto attain the nobler ends proposed by all human government? It may be\r\nthat corruption, loose notions on the duties of citizenship, love of\r\nluxury, and grovelling materialism are even now sources of greater\r\ndanger to the republic than civil war and threatened dissolution. Such\r\nworks as that of Dr. Junkin are valuable as assisting to open the eyes\r\nof the community to certain popular fallacies, and teach the broad\r\ndistinction ever subsisting between right and wrong.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC LEAGUE.--Amongst all the papers and pamphlets\r\nissued from the press during our present war, none, perhaps, have\r\nexercised a more salutary influence than those emanating from this\r\nassociation. The article entitled SLAVERY AND NOBILITY vs.\r\nDEMOCRACY was originally published in this periodical for July,\r\n1862. Pronounced by critics to be among the best magazine articles ever\r\nappearing in print, it commanded a very marked attention as an\r\nexposition of the atrocious motives that underlaid the great Southern\r\nrebellion. The public mind was startled at the developed evidence of a\r\ngreat conspiracy to subvert the fundamental principles of free\r\ngovernment in the South. The coalition between the conspirators of the\r\nSouth and their allies amongst the aristocracy of England was laid bare,\r\nwhilst a great portion of the English press and reviews was shown to be\r\nsuborned into the service of the most atrocious objects and purposes\r\nthat ever disgraced the annals of civilization. This article, whilst it\r\nelucidated to our own countrymen the secret motives of the rebellion,\r\nassisted powerfully to bring a new phase over a perverted English public\r\nopinion. The result has been that the vitiated disposition of the\r\nEnglish aristocracy to assist the rebels, through intervention, has\r\nslunk away before British morality, and is now seen only in aid of\r\npiracy on our commerce.\r\n\r\nFollowing this masterly production, the speech of Mr. Sherwood at\r\nChamplain was a renewed onslaught upon the anti-democratic coalition. In\r\nthis speech the most irrefragable evidence, drawn from the recitals in\r\nthe records of treason, is produced against the conspirators. The\r\nperusal of this speech leaves the mind in no doubt as to the purpose of\r\nthe traitors to overthrow democratic government in the South, and to\r\nestablish a new form of government, based on exclusion of the democratic\r\nprinciple, and resting on a cemented slave aristocracy. These, amongst\r\nother papers of the Democratic League, are so replete with the evidence\r\nby which their positions are fortified, and so comprehensive in the\r\nscope and magnitude of subjects of which they treat, that they must take\r\na high position in the political literature of the day. The manifold\r\nopinions of the press demonstrate how highly they are appreciated. They\r\nare now being reproduced in THE IRON PLATFORM, published by Wm.\r\nOland Bourne, 112 William street, New York, and intended for extensive\r\ncirculation in the cheapest form.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n     THE CHRISTIAN EXAMINER for May, 1863.

Yet there have been times when despondency seemed\r\nto take possession of the public mind, and when the failure of our plans\r\nor temporary disaster to our arms revealed the sad divisions which exist\r\namong ourselves, and apparently postponed the success of our cause to a\r\nperiod so indefinite as to make the heart of the patriot sick with hope\r\ndeferred. But ever and anon, through all the changeful incidents of the\r\nmomentous contest, there have been gleams of light, in which the\r\nnational strength and greatness have made themselves manifest, and have\r\nbeen so vividly felt as to place the public confidence on a sure and\r\nimpregnable basis. The present is one of those periods. Americans feel\r\nthat their Government cannot be overthrown: in spite of the sinister\r\npredictions of enemies at home and abroad, they have an instinctive\r\nassurance that our noble institutions are not destined to perish in this\r\nlamentable conflict, stricken down by ungrateful and traitorous hands in\r\nthe very outset of a great career. The clouds which have gathered around\r\nus are thick and dark; sometimes they have seemed impenetrable; but\r\nagain they separate, we see the blue sky, the stars come out in all\r\ntheir glory, and even the sun pours his intense rays through the\r\nintervals of the storm. We say to ourselves, Courage! this cannot last\r\nalways; there are the firmament, the stars, and the glorious sun still\r\nbehind the clouds, and, though long hidden from us, we know they are\r\nthere, and will reveal themselves again in all their unclouded splendor.\r\nIt is with a confidence as strong as this in the very depths of their\r\nsouls that American citizens still look for the reappearance of the\r\nstars of our destiny, the resurrection of the Union in still greater\r\nbeauty and strength, and the uninterrupted pursuit of its glorious\r\ncareer through the coming ages. Such, heretofore, have been the\r\ncherished hopes which have hung around them like a firmament, and they\r\nare not yet prepared to believe that their political universe has been,\r\nor ever can be, annihilated.\r\n\r\nNor is this confidence a mere sentiment, born of the imagination, and\r\nnurtured by vainglorious hope. It has for its support far more\r\nsubstantial grounds than any merely precarious military successes, or\r\nany of the favorable incidents which, from time to time, may be cast\r\nashore as waifs by the surging tide of civil war. Let the temporary\r\nfortunes of the war be what they will, yet the general bearing of the\r\nold Government, its evident consciousness of strength, its unshaken\r\nsolidity in the midst of the storm which assails it, the confidence\r\nthat, even with all its errors and blunders, it is still powerful enough\r\nto prevail--all these appeal irresistibly to the hearts and judgments of\r\nAmericans, and make them love and confide in their country, and believe\r\nin her destiny, in spite of her misfortunes. The tenacity and stubborn\r\npurpose of the rebels are, indeed, remarkable. Their position gives them\r\ngreat advantages for such a conflict; and it must be admitted that they\r\nhave shown the eminently bad genius to make the most of their fatal\r\nopportunities. Yet is the contest most unequal, and the ultimate result\r\nof discomfiture to them inevitable. The Federal Government, like a\r\nsluggish but powerful man scarcely yet aroused to the exertion of his\r\nfull strength, moves slowly and awkwardly, and lays about him with\r\ncareless and inefficient blows; while his active adversary, inferior in\r\nstrength and in the moral power of his cause, but more fully aroused and\r\nmore energetic, strikes with better effect, and makes every blow tell.\r\nNevertheless, the strength of the one remains unexhausted, and even\r\nincreases as he becomes awakened to the demands of the struggle; while\r\nthat of the other slowly and gradually, but inevitably and irretrievably\r\ndeclines, with every hour of intense strain of faculty which the\r\ndreadful work imposes. Partial observers, imbued with sympathy in bad\r\ndesigns, and blinded by false hopes through that fatal error, may still\r\nthink the South is certain to prevail and to establish the empire of\r\nslavery; but cooler heads, with vision made clear by love of humanity,\r\ncannot fail to see a different result as the necessary end of the\r\ncontest. The South herself, under the shadow of a dread responsibility,\r\nbegins to understand the nature of the case, and the exact position in\r\nwhich she stands; but she is playing a bold and desperate game for the\r\nactive support of foreign powers. She knows well that the sympathies of\r\nthe ruling classes abroad are naturally on her side, and she will\r\nmaintain the struggle to the last extremity, so long as a gleam of hope\r\nshines in that quarter. That hope finally extinguished, she knows\r\nperfectly well her cause is lost.\r\n\r\nThe contrast in the financial condition of the contending sections is of\r\nitself enough to settle the question of ultimate success. The Federal\r\nGovernment stands this day stronger than ever in the plenitude of her\r\nboundless resources, and proudly contemptuous of all the false\r\nprophecies of failure and bankruptcy. She is fully prepared for new\r\ncampaigns, and cannot be dismayed by any possible disaster. She has men\r\nand money in abundance sufficient for any emergency. She can stretch\r\nforth one hand to relieve the suffering people of England and Ireland,\r\nwhile with the other she fights the great battle of liberty against\r\nslavery, of humanity against wrong and oppression. Secure in the\r\nsympathies of the masses of men everywhere, she stands on the solid\r\nground, which can never be withdrawn from under her feet. She occupies\r\nthe central position of freedom and progress, around which cluster and\r\ngravitate the hopes and aspirations of all mankind. The conflicting\r\nelements may rage and storm; the solid ground may tremble, and even be\r\ntorn with earthquake convulsions and superficial ruin; but the grand\r\ncentral structure, with its organizing forces, and its inward heat of\r\nhumanity, with the great life-giving sun of liberty yet shining undimmed\r\nupon it, will still remain the refuge of all nations, and the chosen\r\nhome of all the lovers and champions of human freedom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Oh! why, sweet poet, is thy strain so sad?\r\n  Couldst thou not stamp thy joy on human life?\r\n  Yea, even the saddest life has many joys.\r\n  Couldst thou not stamp thy joy upon the page,\r\n  That they who should come after thee might feel\r\n  Their spirits gladdened by it, and their hearts\r\n  Made lighter with thy lightsomeness? For thou,\r\n  They say, wert joyous as a summer bird,\r\n  The very light and life of those who knew thee--\r\n  Oh! why, then, is thy song so sad? 'Tis wrong,\r\n  'Tis surely wrong, to spend in fond complainings\r\n  The talents given for nobler purposes;\r\n  And he who goes about this world of ours\r\n  Diffusing cheerfulness where'er he goes,\r\n  Like one who scatters fresh and fragrant flowers,\r\n  Fulfils, I can but think, a better part\r\n  Than he who mourns and murmurs life away.\r\n\r\n  ....The poet\r\n  Is the revealer of the heart's deep secrets;\r\n  The poet is the interpreter of nature;\r\n  And shall those light and joyous spirits, they\r\n  Who make bright sunshine wheresoe'er they go,\r\n  Shall they have no interpreter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See Hon.

While faithfully made, they will continue to excel\r\nall other remedies in use, by the rapidity and certainty of their cures.\r\nThat they shall not fail in this we take unwearied pains to make every\r\nbox and bottle perfect, and trust, by great care in preparing them with\r\nchemical accuracy and uniform strength, to supply remedies which shall\r\nmaintain themselves in the unfailing confidence of this whole nation,\r\nand of all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AYER'S CHERRY PECTORAL~\r\n\r\nis an anodyne expectorant, prepared to meet the urgent demand for a safe\r\nand reliable antidote for diseases of the throat and lungs. Disorders of\r\nthe pulmonary organs are so prevalent and so fatal in our ever-changing\r\nclimate, that a reliable antidote is invaluable to the whole community.\r\nThe indispensable qualities of such a remedy for popular use must be,\r\ncertainty of healthy operation, absence of danger from accidental\r\nover-doses, and adaptation to every patient of any age or either sex.\r\nThese conditions have been realized in this preparation, which, while it\r\nreaches to the foundations of disease, and acts with unfailing\r\ncertainty, is still harmless to the most delicate invalid or tender\r\ninfant. A trial of many years has proved to the world that it is\r\nefficacious in curing pulmonary complaints beyond any remedy hitherto\r\nknown to mankind. As time makes these facts wider and better known, this\r\nmedicine has gradually become a staple necessity, from the log cabin of\r\nthe American peasant to the palaces of European kings. Throughout this\r\nentire country--in every State, city, and indeed almost every hamlet it\r\ncontains--the CHERRY PECTORAL is known by its works. Each has\r\nliving evidence of its unrivalled usefulness, in some recovered victim,\r\nor victims, from the threatening symptoms of Consumption. Although this\r\nis not true to so great an extent for distempers of the respiratory\r\norgans, and in several of them it is extensively used by their most\r\nintelligent physicians. In Great Britain, France, and Germany, where the\r\nmedical sciences have reached their highest perfection, CHERRY\r\nPECTORAL is introduced and in constant use in the armies,\r\nhospitals, almshouses, public institutions, and in domestic practice, as\r\nthe surest remedy their attending physicians can employ for the more\r\ndangerous affections of the lungs. Thousands of cases of pulmonary\r\ndisease, which had baffled every expedient of human skill, have been\r\npermanently cured by the CHERRY PECTORAL, and these cures speak\r\nconvincingly to all who know them.\r\n\r\nMany of the certificates of its cures are so remarkable that cautious\r\npeople are led to feel incredulous of their truth, or to fear the\r\nstatements are overdrawn. When they consider that each of our remedies\r\nis a specific on which great labor has been expended for years to\r\nperfect it, and when they further consider how much better anything can\r\nbe done which is exclusively followed with the facilities that large\r\nmanufactories afford, then they may see not only that we do, but _how_\r\nwe make better medicines than have been produced before. Their effects\r\nneed astonish no one, when their history is considered with the fact\r\nthat each preparation has been elaborated to cure one class of diseases,\r\nor, more properly, one disease in its many varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nAYER'S CATHARTIC PILLS\r\n\r\nhave been prepared with the utmost skill which the medical profession of\r\nthis age possesses, and their effects show they have virtues which\r\nsurpass any combination of medicines hitherto known. Other preparations\r\ndo more or less good; but this cures such dangerous complaints, so\r\nquickly and so surely, as to prove an efficacy and a power to uproot\r\ndisease beyond anything which men have known before. By removing the\r\nabstractions of the internal organs and stimulating them into healthy\r\naction, they renovate the fountains of life and vigor,--health courses\r\nanew through the body, and the sick man is well again. They are adapted\r\nto disease, and disease only, for when taken by one in health they\r\nproduce but little effect. This is the perfection of medicine. It is\r\nantagonistic to disease and no more. Tender children may take them with\r\nimpunity. If they are sick they will cure them, if they are well they\r\nwill do them no harm.\r\n\r\nGive them to some patient who has been prostrated with bilious\r\ncomplaint: see his bent-up, tottering form straighten with strength\r\nagain: see his long-lost appetite return: see his clammy features\r\nblossom into health. Give them to some sufferer whose foul blood has\r\nburst out in scrofula till his skin is covered with sores; who stands,\r\nor sits, or lies in anguish. He has been drenched inside and out with\r\nevery potion which ingenuity could suggest. Give him these\r\nPILLS, and mark the effect; see the scabs fall from his body;\r\nsee the new, fair skin that has grown under them; see the late leper\r\nthat is clean. Give them to him whose angry humors have planted\r\nrheumatism in his joints and bones; move him and he screeches with pain;\r\nhe too has been soaked through every muscle of his body with liniments\r\nand salves; give him these PILLS to purify his blood; they may\r\nnot cure him, for, alas! there are cases which no mortal power can\r\nreach; but mark, he walks with crutches now, and now he walks alone;\r\nthey have cured him. Give them to the lean, sour, haggard dyspeptic,\r\nwhose gnawing stomach has long ago eaten every smile from his face and\r\nevery muscle from his body. See his appetite return, and with it his\r\nhealth; see the new man. See her that was radiant with health and\r\nloveliness blasted and too early withering away; want of exercise or\r\nmental anguish, or some lurking disease, has deranged the internal\r\norgans of digestion, assimilation or secretion, till they do their\r\noffice ill. Her blood is vitiated, her health is gone. Give her these\r\nPILLS to stimulate the vital principle into renewed vigor, to\r\ncast out the obstructions, and infuse a new vitality into the blood. Now\r\nlook again--the roses blossom on her cheek, and where lately sorrow sat\r\njoy bursts from every feature. See the sweet infant wasted with worms.\r\nIts wan, sickly features tell you without disguise, and painfully\r\ndistinct, that they are eating its life away. Its pinched-up nose and\r\nears, and restless sleepings, tell the dreadful truth in language which\r\nevery mother knows. Give it the PILLS in large doses to sweep\r\nthese vile parasites from the body. Now turn again and see the ruddy\r\nbloom of childhood. Is it nothing to do these things? Nay, are they not\r\nthe marvel of this age? And yet they are done around you every day.\r\n\r\nHave you the less serious symptoms of these distempers, they are the\r\neasier cured. Jaundice, Costiveness, Headache, Sideache, Heartburn, Foul\r\nStomach, Nausea, Pain in the Bowels, Flatulency, Loss of Appetite,\r\nKing's Evil, Neuralgia, Gout, and kindred complaints all arise from the\r\nderangements which these PILLS rapidly cure. Take them perseveringly,\r\nand under the counsel of a good physician if you can; if not, take them\r\njudiciously by such advice as we give you, and the distressing,\r\ndangerous diseases they cure, which afflict so many millions of the\r\nhuman race, are cast out like the devils of old--they must burrow in the\r\nbrutes and in the sea.\r\n\r\nPrepared by DR.

A. DANA,\r\n\r\nASSISTED BY A NUMEROUS BUT SELECT CORPS OF WRITERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of THE NEW AMERICAN CYCLOPÆDIA is to furnish the\r\ngreat body of intelligent readers in this country with a popular\r\nDictionary of General Knowledge.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW AMERICAN CYCLOPÆDIA is not founded on any European\r\nmodel; in its plan and elaboration it is strictly original, and strictly\r\nAmerican. Many of the writers employed on the work have enriched it with\r\ntheir personal researches, observations, and discoveries; and every\r\narticle has been written, or re-written, expressly for its pages.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that the work shall bear such a character of practical\r\nutility as to make it indispensable to every American library.\r\n\r\nThroughout its successive volumes, THE NEW AMERICAN CYCLOPÆDIA\r\nwill present a fund of accurate and copious information on SCIENCE,\r\nART, AGRICULTURE, COMMERCE, MANUFACTURES, LAW, MEDICINE, LITERATURE,\r\nPHILOSOPHY, MATHEMATICS, ASTRONOMY, HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, GEOGRAPHY,\r\nRELIGION, POLITICS, TRAVELS, CHEMISTRY, MECHANICS, INVENTIONS, and\r\nTRADES.\r\n\r\nAbstaining from all doctrinal discussions, from all sectional and\r\nsectarian arguments, it will maintain the position of absolute\r\nimpartiality on the great controverted questions which have divided\r\nopinions in every age.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICE.\r\n\r\nThis work is published exclusively by subscription, in sixteen large\r\noctavo volumes, each containing 750 two-column pages.\r\n\r\nPrice per volume, cloth, $3.50; library style, leather, $4; half\r\nmorocco, 4.50; half russia, extra, $5.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the London Daily News._\r\n\r\nIt is beyond all comparison the best,--indeed, we should feel quite\r\njustified in saying it is the only book of reference upon the Western\r\nContinent that has ever appeared. No statesman or politician can afford\r\nto do without it, and it will be a treasure to every student of the\r\nmoral and physical condition of America. Its information is minute,\r\nfull, and accurate upon every subject connected with the country. Beside\r\nthe constant attention of the Editors, it employs the pens of a a host\r\nof most distinguished transatlantic writers--statesmen, lawyers,\r\ndivines, soldiers, a vast array of scholarship from the professional\r\nchairs of the Universities, with numbers of private literati, and men\r\ndevoted to special pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  HOME\r\n  INSURANCE COMPANY\r\n  OF NEW YORK,\r\n  OFFICE, 112 & 114 BROADWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CASH CAPITAL,                 $1,000,000.\r\n  Assets, 1st Jan., 1860,       $1,458,396 28.\r\n  Liabilities, 1st Jan., 1860,      42,580 43.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS COMPANY INSURES AGAINST LOSS & DAMAGE BY FIRE, ON FAVORABLE TERMS.\r\n\r\nLOSSES EQUITABLY ADJUSTED & PROMPTLY PAID.\r\n\r\nDIRECTORS:\r\n\r\n  Charles J.

They have been proved to be the Soldier's never-failing-friend\r\nin the hour of need.\r\n\r\n~COUGHS AND COLDS AFFECTING TROOPS~\r\n\r\nwill be speedily relieved and effectually cured by using these admirable\r\nmedicines, and by paying proper attention to the Directions which are\r\nattached to each Pot or Box.\r\n\r\n~SICK HEADACHES AND WANT OF APPETITE, INCIDENTAL TO SOLDIERS.~\r\n\r\nThese feelings which so sadden us usually arise from trouble or\r\nannoyances, obstructed perspiration, or eating and drinking whatever is\r\nunwholesome, thus disturbing the healthful action of the liver and\r\nstomach. These organs must be relieved, if you desire to be well. The\r\nPills, taken according to the printed instructions, will quickly produce\r\na healthy action in both liver and stomach, and, as a natural\r\nconsequence, a clear head and good appetite.\r\n\r\n~WEAKNESS OR DEBILITY INDUCED BY OVER FATIGUE~\r\n\r\nwill soon disappear by the use of these invaluable Pills, and the\r\nSoldier will quickly acquire additional strength. Never let the bowels\r\nbe either confined or unduly acted upon. It may seem strange, that\r\nHOLLOWAY'S PILLS should be recommended for Dysentery and Flux,\r\nmany persons supposing that they would increase the relaxation. This is\r\na great mistake, for these Pills will correct the liver and stomach, and\r\nthus remove all the acrid humors from the system. This medicine will\r\ngive tone and vigor to the whole organic system, however deranged, while\r\nhealth and strength follow, as a matter of course. Nothing will stop the\r\nrelaxation of the bowels so sure as this famous medicine.\r\n\r\n~VOLUNTEERS, ATTENTION! THE INDISCRETIONS OF YOUTH.~\r\n\r\nSores and Ulcers, Blotches and Swellings, can with certainty be\r\nradically cured, if the Pills are taken night and morning, and the\r\nOintment be freely used as stated in the printed instructions. If\r\ntreated in any other manner, they dry up in one part to break out in\r\nanother. Whereas, this Ointment will remove the humors from the system\r\nand leave the patient a vigorous and healthy man. It will require a\r\nlittle perseverance in bad cases to insure a lasting cure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n~JOSEPH GILLOTT~\r\n\r\nrespectfully invites the attention of the public to the following\r\nNumbers of his\r\n\r\n~PATENT METALLIC PENS~,\r\n\r\nWHICH, FOR\r\n\r\n~QUALITY OF MATERIAL, EASY ACTION, AND GREAT DURABILITY,~\r\n\r\nWILL ENSURE UNIVERSAL PREFERENCE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ~FOR LADIES' USE.~--For fine neat writing, especially on thick\r\n       and highly-finished papers, Nos. 1, 173, 303, 604.

The grand piano unites in itself all the\r\nqualities which you can demand of a concert piano; in fact, I do not\r\nhesitate to say that this piano is far better than all the English\r\npianos which I have seen at the Exhibition,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe \"_Paris Constitutional_\" says: \"In the piano manufacture the palm\r\ndon't belong to the European industry this year, but to an American\r\nhouse, almost unknown until now, Messrs.

No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the\r\nlatter is abundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection\r\nof its counsels in many important public events, and in the character\r\nand power of those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the\r\nCONTINENTAL was first established, it has during that time\r\nacquired a strength and a political significance elevating it to a\r\nposition far above that previously occupied by any publication of the\r\nkind in America. In proof of which assertion we call attention to the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a\r\nsingle one has had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six\r\nthousand_ copies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among\r\nthe Pines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary\r\npopularity;_ and its conductors are determined that it shall not fall\r\nbehind. Preserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a\r\nthousand journals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its\r\ncircle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle\r\ninvolved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of the\r\ncountry, embracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the\r\ngreat questions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal:\r\nmuch the larger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore,\r\nby tales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be\r\nfound, under its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and\r\npresenting attractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,                    Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,                   Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,                  Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,                Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,            Thirty-six dollars.\r\n                           PAID IN ADVANCE\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, to be paid BY THE\r\nSUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the\r\nPublisher_.\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n  on the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $48 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           48 00\r\n     \"    in two years          48 00\r\n     \"    in three years        48 00\r\n     \"    in four years        236 00\r\n     \"    in five years        224 00\r\n     \"    in six years         212 00\r\n\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $24 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           24 00\r\n     \"    in two years          24 00\r\n     \"    in three years        24 00\r\n     \"    in four years        118 00\r\n     \"    in five years        112 00\r\n     \"    in six years         106 00",
