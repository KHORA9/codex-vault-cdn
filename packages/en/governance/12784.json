VI\r\n\r\nTHE DRAPIER'S LETTERS\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\n\r\nGEORGE BELL AND SONS\r\n\r\n1903\r\n\r\nCHISWICK PRESS CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND CO\r\nTOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIn 1714 Swift left England for Ireland, disappointed, distressed, and\r\nworn out with anxiety in the service of the Harley Ministry. On his\r\ninstallation as Dean of St. Patrick's he had been received in Dublin\r\nwith jeering and derision. He had even been mocked at in his walks\r\nabroad. In 1720, however, he entered for the second time the field of\r\nactive political polemics, and began with renewed energy the series of\r\nwritings which not only placed him at the head and front of the\r\npolitical writers of the day, but secured for him a place in the\r\naffections of the people of Ireland--a place which has been kept sacred\r\nto him even to the present time. A visitor to the city of Dublin\r\ndesirous of finding his way to St. Patrick's Cathedral need but to ask\r\nfor the Dean's Church, and he will be understood. There is only one\r\nDean, and he wrote the \"Drapier's Letters.\" The joy of the people of\r\nDublin on the withdrawal of Wood's Patent found such permanent\r\nexpression, that it has descended as oral tradition, and what was\r\nomitted from the records of Parliament and the proceedings of Clubs and\r\nAssociations founded in the Drapier's honour, has been embalmed in the\r\nhearts of the people, whose love he won, and whose homage it was ever\r\nhis pride to accept.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Swift which Grattan invoked had, even in Grattan's time,\r\npower to stir hearts to patriotic enthusiasm. That spirit has not died\r\nout yet, and the Irish people still find it seasonable and refreshing to\r\nbe awakened by it to a true sense of the dignity and majesty of\r\nIreland's place in the British Empire.\r\n\r\nA dispassionate student of the condition of Ireland between the years\r\nof Swift's birth and death--between, say, 1667 and 1745--could rise from\r\nthat study in no unprejudiced mood. It would be difficult for him to\r\navoid the conclusion that the government of Ireland by England had not\r\nonly degraded the people of the vassal nation, but had proved a disgrace\r\nand a stigma on the ruling nation. It was a government of the masses by\r\nthe classes, for no other than selfish ends. It ended, as all such\r\ngovernments must inevitably end, in impoverishing the people, in\r\nwholesale emigration, in starvation and even death, in revolt, and in\r\nfostering among those who remained, and among those whom circumstances\r\nexiled, the dangerous spirit of resentment and rebellion which is the\r\noutcome of the sense of injustice. It has also served, even to this day,\r\nto give vitality to those associations that have from time to time\r\narisen in Ireland for the object of realizing that country's\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that the people of Ireland of that time justified\r\nSwift's petition when he prayed to be removed from \"this land of slaves,\r\nwhere all are fools and all are knaves\"; but that is no justification\r\nfor the injustice. The injustice from which Ireland suffered was a fact.\r\nIts existence was resented with all the indignation with which an\r\nemotional and spiritual people will always resent material obstructions\r\nto the free play of what they feel to be their best powers.\r\n\r\nThere were no leaders at the time who could see this, and seeing it,\r\nenforce its truth on the dull English mind to move it to saner methods\r\nof dealing with this people. Nor were there any who could order the\r\nresentment into battalions of fighting men to give point to the demands\r\nfor equal rights with their English fellow-subjects.\r\n\r\nHad Swift been an Irishman by nature as he was by birth, it might have\r\nbeen otherwise; but Swift was an Irishman by accident, and only became\r\nan Irish patriot by reason of the humanity in him which found indignant\r\nand permanent expression against oppression. Swift's indignation\r\nagainst the selfish hypocrisy of his fellow-men was the cry from the\r\npain which the sight of man's inhumanity to man inflicted on his\r\nsensitive and truth-loving nature. The folly and baseness of his\r\nfellow-creatures stung him, as he once wrote to Pope, \"to perfect rage\r\nand resentment.\" Turn where he would, he found either the knave as the\r\nslave driver, or the slave as a fool, and the latter became even a\r\nwilling sacrifice. His indignation at the one was hardly greater than\r\nhis contempt for the other, and his different feelings found trenchant\r\nexpression in such writings as the \"Drapier's Letters,\" the \"Modest\r\nProposal,\" and \"Gulliver's Travels.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that the _saeva indignatio_ which lacerated his heart\r\nwas the passion of a mad man. To argue thus seems to us to misunderstand\r\nentirely the peculiar qualities of Swift's nature. It was not the mad\r\nman that made the passion; it was rather the passion that made the man\r\nmad. As we understand him, it seems to us that Swift's was an eminently\r\nmajestic spirit, moved by the tenderest of human sympathies, and capable\r\nof ennobling love--a creature born to rule and to command, but with all\r\nthe noble qualities which go to make a ruler loved. It happened that\r\ncircumstances placed him early in his career into poverty and servitude.\r\nHe extricated himself from both in time; but his liberation was due to\r\nan assertion of his best powers, and not to a dissimulation of them. Had\r\nhe been less honest, he might have risen to a position of great power,\r\nbut it would have been at the price of those very qualities which made\r\nhim the great man he was. That assertion cost him his natural vocation,\r\nand Swift lived on to rage in the narrow confines of a Dublin Deanery\r\nHouse. He might have flourished as the greatest of English statesmen--he\r\nbecame instead a monster, a master-scourger of men, pitiless to them as\r\nthey had been blind to him. But monster and master-scourger as he proved\r\nhimself, he always took the side of the oppressed as against the\r\noppressor. The impulse which sent him abroad collecting guineas for\r\n\"poor Harrison\" was the same impulse which moved him in his study at the\r\nDeanery to write as \"M.B. Drapier.\" On this latter occasion, however, he\r\nalso had an opportunity to lay bare the secret springs of oppression, an\r\nopportunity which he was not the man to let go by.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Swift was not quite disinterested in the motives which prompted\r\nhim to enter the political arena for the second time. He hated the\r\nWalpole Ministry in power; he resented his exile in a country whose\r\npeople he despised; and he scorned the men who, while they feared him,\r\nhad yet had the power to prevent his advancement. But, allowing for\r\nthese personal incentives, there was in Swift such a large sympathy for\r\nthe degraded condition of the Irish people, such a tender solicitude for\r\ntheir best welfare, and such a deep-seated zeal for their betterment,\r\nthat, in measuring to him his share in the title of patriot, we cannot\r\nbut admit that what we may call his public spirit far outweighed his\r\nprivate spleen. Above all things Swift loved liberty, integrity,\r\nsincerity and justice; and if it be that it was his love for these,\r\nrather than his love for the country, which inspired him to patriotic\r\nefforts, who shall say that he does not still deserve well of us. If a\r\npatriot be a man who nobly teaches a people to become aware of its\r\nhighest functions as a nation, then was Swift a great patriot, and he\r\nbetter deserves that title than many who have been accorded it.\r\n\r\nThe matter of Wood's Halfpence was a trivial one in itself; but it was\r\njust that kind of a matter which Swift must instantly have appreciated\r\nas the happiest for his purpose. It was a matter which appealed to the\r\ncommonest news-boy on the street, and its meaning once made plain, the\r\nprinciple which gave vitality to the meaning was ready for enunciation\r\nand was assured of intelligent acceptance. In writing the \"Drapier's\r\nLetters,\" he had, to use his own words, seasonably raised a spirit\r\namong the Irish people, and that spirit he continued to refresh, until\r\nwhen he told them in his Fourth Letter, \"by the Laws of God, of Nature,\r\nof Nations, and of your Country, you are, and ought to be, as free a\r\npeople as your brethren in England,\" the country rose as one man to the\r\nappeal. Neither the suavities of Carteret nor the intrigues of Walpole\r\nhad any chance against the set opposition which met them. The question\r\nto be settled was taken away from the consideration of ministers, and\r\nout of the seclusion of Cabinets into the hands of the People, and\r\nbefore the public eye. There was but one way in which it could be\r\nsettled--the way of the people's will--and it went that way. It does not\r\nat all matter that Walpole finally had his way--that the King's mistress\r\npocketed her _douceur_, and that Wood retired satisfied with the ample\r\ncompensation allowed him. What does matter is that, for the first time\r\nin Irish History, a spirit of national life was breathed into an almost\r\ndenationalized people. Beneath the lean and starved ribs of death Swift\r\nplanted a soul; it is for this that Irishmen will ever revere his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nIn the composition of the \"Letters\" Swift had set himself a task\r\npeculiarly fitting to his genius. Those qualities of mind which enabled\r\nhim to enter into the habits of the lives of footmen, servants, and\r\nlackeys found an even more congenial freedom of play here. His knowledge\r\nof human nature was so profound that he instinctively touched the right\r\nkeys, playing on the passions of the common people with a deftness far\r\nsurpassing in effect the acquired skill of the mere master of oratory.\r\nHe ordered his arguments and framed their language, so that his readers\r\nresponded with almost passionate enthusiasm to the call he made upon\r\nthem. Allied to his gift of intellectual sympathy with his kind was a\r\nconsummate ability in expression, into which he imparted the fullest\r\nvalue of the intended meaning. His thought lost nothing in its\r\nstatement. Writing as he did from the point of view of a tradesman, to\r\nthe shopkeepers, farmers, and common people of Ireland, his business was\r\nto speak with them as if he were one of them. He had already laid bare\r\ntheir grievances caused by the selfish legislation of the English\r\nParliament, which had ruined Irish manufactures; he had written grimly\r\nof the iniquitous laws which had destroyed the woollen trade of the\r\ncountry; he had not forgotten the condition of the people as he saw it\r\non his journeys from Dublin to Cork--a condition which he was later to\r\nreveal in the most terrible of his satirical tracts--and he realized\r\nwith almost personal anguish the degradation of the people brought about\r\nby the rapacity and selfishness of a class which governed with no\r\nthought of ultimate consequences, and with no apparent understanding of\r\nwhat justice implied. It was left for him to precipitate his private\r\nopinion and public spirit in such form as would arouse the nation to a\r\nsense of self-respect, if not to a pitch of resentment. The \"Drapier's\r\nLetters\" was the reagent that accomplished both.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe editor takes this opportunity to express his thanks and obligations\r\nto Mr. G.R.

It has been indignantly\r\ndenied by contemporary writers that this small change meant copper\r\ncoins. They asserted that there was no lack of copper money, but that\r\nthere was a great want of small silver. Be that as it may, the report\r\nthat small change was wanting was sufficiently substantiated to the\r\nEnglish government to warrant it to proceed to satisfy the want. In its\r\ndealings with Ireland, however, English governments appear to have\r\nconsistently assumed that attitude which would most likely cause\r\nfriction and arouse disturbance. In England coins for currency proceeded\r\nfrom a mint established under government supervision. In Scotland such a\r\nmint was specially provided for in the Act of Union. But in Ireland, the\r\ngovernment acted otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe Irish people had again and again begged that they should be\r\npermitted to establish a mint in which coins could be issued of the same\r\nstandard and intrinsic value as those used in England. English\r\nparliaments, however, invariably disregarded these petitions. Instead of\r\nthe mint the King gave grants or patents by which a private individual\r\nobtained the right to mint coins for the use of the inhabitants. The\r\nright was most often given for a handsome consideration, and held for a\r\nterm of years. In 1660 Charles II. granted such a patent to Sir Thomas\r\nArmstrong, permitting him to coin farthings for twenty years. It\r\nappears, however, that Armstrong never actually coined the farthings,\r\nalthough he had gone to the expense of establishing a costly plant for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nSmall copper coins becoming scarce, several individuals, without\r\npermission, issued tokens; but the practice was stopped. In 1680 Sir\r\nWilliam Armstrong, son of Sir Thomas, with Colonel George Legg\r\n(afterwards Lord Dartmouth), obtained a patent for twenty-one years,\r\ngranting them the right to issue copper halfpence. Coins were actually\r\nstruck and circulated, but the patent itself was sold to John Knox in\r\nthe very year of its issue. Knox, however, had his patent specially\r\nrenewed, but his coinage was interrupted when James II. issued his\r\ndebased money during the Revolution (see Monck Mason, p. 334, and the\r\nnotes on this matter to the Drapier's Third Letter, in present edition).\r\n\r\nKnox sold his patent to Colonel Roger Moore, who overstocked the country\r\nwith his coins to such an extent that the currency became undervalued.\r\nWhen, in 1705, Moore endeavoured to obtain a renewal of his patent, his\r\napplication was refused. By 1722, owing either to Moore's bad coinage,\r\nor to the importation of debased coins from other countries, the copper\r\nmoney had degraded considerably. In a pamphlet[1] issued by George\r\nEwing in Dublin (1724), it is stated that in that year, W. Trench\r\npresented a memorial to the Lords of the Treasury, complaining of the\r\ncondition of the copper coinage, and pointing out that the evil results\r\nhad been brought about by the system of grants to private individuals.\r\nNotwithstanding this memorial, it was attempted to overcome the\r\ndifficulty by a continuance of the old methods. A new patent was issued\r\nto an English iron merchant, William Wood by name, who, according to\r\nCoxe, submitted proposal with many others, for the amelioration of the\r\ngrievance. Wood's proposals, say this same authority, were accepted \"as\r\nbeneficial to Ireland.\" The letters patent bear the date July 12th,\r\n1722, and were prepared in accordance with the King's instructions to\r\nthe Attorney and Solicitor General sent in a letter from Kensington on\r\nJune 16th, 1722. The letter commanded \"that a bill should be prepared\r\nfor his royal signature, containing and importing an indenture, whereof\r\none part was to pass the Great Seal of Great Britain.\" This indenture,\r\nnotes Monck Mason,[2] between His Majesty of the one part, \"and William\r\nWood, of Wolverhampton, in the County of Stafford, Esq.,\" of the other,\r\nsignifies that His Majesty\r\n\r\n\"has received information that, in his kingdom of Ireland, there was a\r\ngreat want of small money for making small payments, and that retailers\r\nand others did suffer by reason of such want.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"A Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland in their\r\nunanimous refusal of Mr. Wood's Copper Money,\" pp. 22-23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" note v, pp. 326-327.]\r\n\r\nBy virtue, therefore, of his prerogative royal, and in consideration of\r\nthe rents, covenants, and agreements therein expressed, His Majesty\r\ngranted to William Wood, his executors, assigns, etc., \"full, free,\r\nsole, and absolute power, privilege, licence, and authority,\" during\r\nfourteen years, from the annunciation of the Blessed Virgin, 1722, to\r\ncoin halfpence and farthings of copper, to be uttered and disposed of in\r\nIreland, and not elsewhere. It was provided that the whole quantity\r\ncoined should not exceed 360 tons of copper, whereof 100 tons only were\r\nto be coined in the first year, and 20 tons in each of the last\r\nthirteen, said farthings and halfpence to be of good, pure, and\r\nmerchantable copper, and of such size and bigness, that one avoirdupois\r\npound weight of copper should not be converted into more farthings and\r\nhalfpence than would make thirty pence by tale; all the said farthings\r\nand halfpence to be of equal weight in themselves, or as near thereunto\r\nas might be, allowing a remedy not exceeding two farthings over or under\r\nin each pound. The same \"to pass and to be received as current money, by\r\nsuch as shall or will, voluntarily and willingly, and not otherwise,\r\nreceive the same, within the said kingdom of Ireland, and not\r\nelsewhere.\" Wood also covenanted to pay to the King's clerk or\r\ncomptroller of the coinage, £200 yearly, and £100 per annum into his\r\nMajesty's treasury.\r\n\r\nMost of the accounts of this transaction and its consequent agitation\r\nin Ireland, particularly those given by Sir W. Scott and Earl Stanhope,\r\nare taken from Coxe's \"Life of Walpole.\" Monck Mason, however, in his\r\nvarious notes appended to his life of Swift, has once and for all placed\r\nCoxe's narrative in its true light, and exposed the specious special\r\npleading on behalf of his hero, Walpole. But even Coxe cannot hide the\r\nfact that the granting of the patent and the circumstances under which\r\nit was granted, amounted to a disgraceful job, by which an opportunity\r\nwas seized to benefit a \"noble person\" in England at the expense of\r\nIreland. The patent was really granted to the King's mistress, the\r\nDuchess of Kendal, who sold it to William Wood for the sum of £10,000,\r\nand (as it was reported with, probably, much truth) for a share in the\r\nprofits of the coining. The job was alluded to by Swift when he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"When late a feminine magician,\r\nJoin'd with a brazen politician,\r\nExpos'd, to blind a nation's eyes,\r\nA parchment of prodigious size.\"\r\n\r\nCoxe endeavors to exonerate Walpole from the disgrace attached to this\r\nbusiness, by expatiating on Carteret's opposition to Walpole, an\r\nopposition which went so far as to attempt to injure the financial\r\nminister's reputation by fomenting jealousies and using the Wood patent\r\nagitation to arouse against him the popular indignation; but this does\r\nnot explain away the fact itself. He lays some blame for the agitation\r\non Wood's indiscretion in flaunting his rights and publicly boasting of\r\nwhat the great minister would do for him. At the same time he takes care\r\nto censure the government for its misconduct in not consulting with the\r\nLord Lieutenant and his Privy Council before granting the patent. His\r\ncensure, however, is founded on the consideration that this want of\r\nattention was injudicious and was the cause of the spread of exaggerated\r\nrumours of the patent's evil tendency. He has nothing to say of the\r\nrights and liberties of a people which had thereby been infringed and\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nThe English parliament had rarely shown much consideration for Irish\r\nfeelings or Irish rights. Its attitude towards the Irish Houses of\r\nLegislation had been high-handed and even dictatorial; so that\r\nconstitutional struggles were not at all infrequent towards the end of\r\nthe seventeenth and during the first quarter of the eighteenth century.\r\nThe efforts of Sir Constantine Phipps towards a non-parliamentary\r\ngovernment,[3] and the reversal by the English House of Lords of the\r\ndecision given by the Irish House of Lords in the famous Annesley case,\r\nhad prepared the Irish people for a revolt against any further attempts\r\nto dictate to its properly elected representatives assembled in\r\nparliament. Moreover, the wretched material condition of the people, as\r\nit largely had been brought about by a selfish, persecuting legislation\r\nthat practically isolated Ireland commercially in prohibiting the\r\nexportation of its industrial products, was a danger and a menace to the\r\ngoverning country. The two nations were facing each other threateningly.\r\nWhen, therefore, Wood began to import his coin, suspicion was\r\nimmediately aroused.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Lecky's \"History of Ireland,\" vol. i., p. 446, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe masses took little notice of it at first; but the commissioners of\r\nrevenue in Dublin took action in a letter they addressed to the Right\r\nHon. Edward Hopkins, secretary to the Lord Lieutenant. This letter,\r\ndated August 7th, 1722, began by expressing surprise at the patent\r\ngranted to Mr. Wood, and asked the secretary \"to lay before the Lord\r\nLieutenant a memorial, presented by their agent to the Lords of the\r\nTreasury, concerning this patent, and also a report of some former\r\nCommissioners of the revenue on the like occasion, and to acquaint his\r\nGrace, that they concurred in all the objections in those papers, and\r\nwere of opinion, that such a patent would be highly prejudicial to the\r\ntrade, and welfare of this kingdom, and more particularly to his\r\nMajesty's revenue, which they had formerly found to have suffered very\r\nmuch, by too great a quantity of such base coin.\"[4] No reply was\r\nreceived to this letter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"A Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland,\" etc.,\r\np. 6.]\r\n\r\nFears began to be generally felt, and the early murmurs of an agitation\r\nto be heard when, on September 19th, 1722, the Commissioners addressed a\r\nsecond letter, this time to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's\r\nTreasury. The letter assured their Lordships \"that they had been applied\r\nto by many persons of rank and fortune, and by the merchants and traders\r\nin Ireland, to represent the ill effects of Mr. Wood's patent, and that\r\nthey could from former experience assure their Lordships, it would be\r\nparticularly detrimental to his Majesty's revenue. They represented that\r\nthis matter had made a great noise here, and that there did not appear\r\nthe _least want of such small species of coin for change_, and hoped\r\nthat the importance of the occasion would excuse their making this\r\nrepresentation of a matter that had not been referred to them.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Ibid_, pp. 6-7.]\r\n\r\nTo this letter also no reply was vouchsafed. In the meantime, Wood kept\r\nsending in his coins, landing them at most of the ports of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"Then everyone that was not interested in the success of this coinage,\"\r\nwrites the author of the pamphlet already quoted, \"by having contracted\r\nfor a great quantity of his halfpence at a large discount, or biassed by\r\nthe hopes of immoderate gain to be made out of the ruins of their\r\ncountry, expressed their apprehensions of the pernicious consequences of\r\nthis copper money; and resolved to make use of the _right they had by\r\nlaw to refuse the same_\".[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Ibid_, p. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Grafton, had arrived in August, 1723,\r\nand parliament sat early in September. Its first attention was paid to\r\nthe Wood patent. After the early excitement had subsided, they resolved\r\nto appeal to the King. During the early stages of the discussion,\r\nhowever, the Commons addressed the Lord Lieutenant, asking that a copy\r\nof the patent and other papers relating to it, be laid before them. This\r\nwas on September 13th. On the following day Mr. Hopkins informed the\r\nHouse that the Lord Lieutenant had no such copy, nor any papers. The\r\nHouse then unanimously resolved to inquire into the matter on its own\r\naccount, and issued orders for several persons to appear before it to\r\ngive evidence, fixing the day for examination for September 16th. On\r\nthat day, however, Mr. Hopkins appeared before the members with a copy\r\nof the patent, and informed them that the Lord Lieutenant had received\r\nit since his last communication with them. This incident served but to\r\narouse further ridicule. A broadside, published at the time with the\r\ntitle \"A Creed of an Irish Commoner,\" amusingly reveals the lameness of\r\nthe excuse for this non-production of the exemplification. Coxe says\r\nthat the cause for the delay was due to the fact that the copy of the\r\npatent had been delivered to the Lord Lieutenant's servant, instead of\r\nto his private secretary; but this excuse is probably no more happily\r\nfounded than the one offered.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, September 20th, the House resolved itself into a committee\r\n\"to take into consideration the state of the nation, particularly in\r\nrelation to the importing and uttering of copper halfpence and farthings\r\nin this kingdom.\" After three days' debate, and after examining\r\ncompetent witnesses under oath, it passed resolutions to the following\r\neffect\r\n\r\n(1) That Wood's patent is highly prejudicial to his Majesty's revenue,\r\nand is destructive of trade and commerce, and most dangerous to the\r\nrights and properties of the subject.\r\n\r\n(2) That for the purpose of obtaining the patent Wood had notoriously\r\nmisrepresented the state of the nation.\r\n\r\n(3) That great quantities of the coin had been imported of different\r\nimpressions and of much less weight than the patent called for.\r\n\r\n(4) That the loss to the nation by the uttering of this coin would\r\namount to 150 per cent.\r\n\r\n(5) That in coining the halfpence Wood was guilty of a notorious fraud.\r\n\r\n(6) \"That it is the opinion of this Committee, that it hath been always\r\nhighly prejudicial to this kingdom to grant the power or privilege of\r\ncoining money to private persons; and that it will, at all times, be of\r\ndangerous consequence to grant any such power to any body politic, or\r\ncorporate, or any private person or persons whatsoever.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"Comm. Journals,\" vol. iii., pp. 317-325.]\r\n\r\nAddresses to his Majesty in conformity with these resolutions were voted\r\non September 27th.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords passed similar resolutions on September 26th, and\r\nvoted addresses embodying them on September 28th.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"Lords' Journals,\" vol. ii., pp. 745-751.]\r\n\r\nThese Addresses received a better attention than did the letters from\r\nthe revenue commissioners. The Houses were courteously informed that\r\ntheir communications would receive His Majesty's careful consideration.\r\nWalpole kept his promise, but not before he had fought hard to maintain\r\nthe English prerogative, as he might have called it. The \"secret\"\r\nhistory as narrated in Coxe's lively manner, throws some light on the\r\nsituation. Coxe really finds his hero's conduct not marked with \"his\r\nusual caution.\" The Lord Lieutenant was permitted to go to Ireland\r\nwithout proper instructions; the information on which Walpole acted was\r\nnot reliable; and he did not sufficiently appreciate the influence of\r\nChancellor Midleton and his family. \"He bitterly accused Lord Midleton\r\nof treachery and low cunning, of having made, in his speeches,\r\ndistinction between the King and his ministers, of caballing with\r\nCarteret, Cadogan, and Roxburgh, and of pursuing that line of conduct,\r\nbecause he was of opinion the opposite party would gain the ascendency\r\nin the cabinet. He did not believe the disturbances to be so serious as\r\nthey were represented, nor was he satisfied with the Duke of Grafton's\r\nconduct, as being solely directed by Conolly, but declared that the part\r\nacted by Conolly, almost excused what the Brodricks had done.\" Carteret\r\ncomplained to the King and proved to him that Walpole's policy was a\r\ndangerous one. The King became irritated and Walpole \"ashamed.\" He even\r\nbecame \"uneasy,\" and it is to be supposed, took a more \"cautious\"\r\ncourse; for he managed to conciliate the Brodricks and the powers in\r\nDublin. But the devil was not ill long. The cabinet crisis resulted in\r\nthe triumph of Townshend and Walpole, and the devil got well again.\r\nCarteret must be removed and the patent promoted. But Midleton and the\r\nBrodricks must be kept friendly. So Carteret went to Ireland as Lord\r\nLieutenant, Midleton remained Chancellor, and constituted a lord\r\njustice, and St. John Brodrick was nominated a member of the Privy\r\nCouncil. Still farther on his \"cautious\" way, Ireland must be given some\r\nconsideration; hence the Committee of the Privy Council, specially\r\ncalled to inquire into the grievances complained of by the Irish Houses\r\nof Parliament in their loyal addresses.\r\n\r\nThe Committee sat for several weeks, and the report it issued forms the\r\nsubject of Swift's animadversions in the Drapier's third letter. But the\r\ntime spent by the Committee in London was being utilized in quite a\r\ndifferent fashion by Swift in Ireland. \"Cautious\" as was Walpole, he had\r\nnot reckoned with the champion of his political opponents of Queen\r\nAnne's days. Swift had little humour for court intrigues and cabinet\r\ncabals. He came out into the open to fight the good fight of the people\r\nto whom courts and cabinets should be servants and not self-seeking\r\nmasters. Whatever doubts the people of Ireland may have had about the\r\nlegal validity of their resentment towards Wood and his coins, were\r\nquickly dissipated when they read \"A Letter to the Shop Keepers,\r\nTradesmen, Farmers, and Common People of Ireland, concerning the Brass\r\nHalf-pence coined by Mr. Wood,\" and signed, \"M.B. Drapier.\" The letter,\r\nas Lord Orrery remarked, acted like the sound of a trumpet. At that\r\nsound \"a spirit arose among the people, that in the eastern phrase, was\r\n_like unto a trumpet in the day of the whirlwind_. Every person of every\r\nrank, party, and denomination was convinced, that the admission of\r\nWood's copper must prove fatal to the Commonwealth. The papist, the\r\nfanatic, the Tory, the Whig, all listed themselves volunteers under the\r\nbanners of M.B. Drapier, and were all equally zealous to serve the\r\nCommon cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe present text of the first of the Drapier's letters is based on that\r\ngiven by Sir W. Scott, carefully collated with two copies of the first\r\nedition which differed from each other in many particulars. One belonged\r\nto the late Colonel F. Grant, and the other is in the British Museum. It\r\nhas also been read with the collection of the Drapier's Letters issued\r\nby the Drapier Club in 1725, with the title, \"Fraud Detected\"; with the\r\nLondon edition of \"The Hibernian Patriot\" (1730), and with Faulkner's\r\ntext issued in his collected edition of Swift's Works in 1735.\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                  A\r\n               *LETTER*\r\n                TO THE\r\n_Shop-Keepers_, _Tradesmen_, _Farmers_\r\n  and _Common-People_ of\r\n *IRELAND*,\r\n\r\n            Concerning the\r\n          *Brass Half-pence*\r\n              Coined by\r\n\r\n            **Mr. Woods,**\r\n\r\n                 WITH\r\nA _Design_ to have them _Pass_ in this\r\n              *KINGDOM*.\r\n\r\nWherein is shewn the Power of the said PATENT,\r\n  the Value of the HALF-PENCE, and\r\n  how far every Person may be oblig'd to take the\r\n  same in Payments, and how to behave in Case\r\n  such an Attempt shou'd be made by WOODS\r\n  or any other Person.\r\n\r\n[Very Proper to be kept in every FAMILY.]\r\n\r\n        By M.B. _Drapier_.\r\n\r\nDUBLIN: Printed by _J.

Therefore I do most earnestly exhort you as\r\nmen, as Christians, as parents, and as lovers of your country, to read\r\nthis paper with the utmost attention, or get it read to you by others;\r\nwhich that you may do at the less expense, I have ordered the printer to\r\nsell it at the lowest rate.\r\n\r\nIt is a great fault among you, that when a person writes with no other\r\nintention than to do you good, you will not be at the pains to read his\r\nadvices: One copy of this paper may serve a dozen of you, which will be\r\nless than a farthing a-piece. It is your folly that you have no common\r\nor general interest in your view, not even the wisest among you, neither\r\ndo you know or enquire, or care who are your friends, or who are your\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nAbout three[9] years ago, a little book was written, to advise all\r\npeople to wear the manufactures of this our own dear country:[10] It had\r\nno other design, said nothing against the King or Parliament, or any\r\nman, yet the POOR PRINTER was prosecuted two years, with the utmost\r\nviolence, and even some WEAVERS themselves, for whose sake it was\r\nwritten, being upon the JURY, FOUND HIM GUILTY. This would be enough to\r\ndiscourage any man from endeavouring to do you good, when you will\r\neither neglect him or fly in his face for his pains, and when he must\r\nexpect only danger to himself and loss of money, perhaps to his\r\nruin.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: In his reprint of the Drapier's Letters, issued in 1725\r\nwith the title, \"Fraud Detected; or the Hibernian Patriot,\" Faulkner\r\nprints \"four\" instead of \"three\"; but this, of course, is a correction\r\nmade to agree with the date of the publication of this reprint. The\r\n\"Proposal\" was published in 1720. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The \"little book\" was \"A Proposal for the Universal Use of\r\nIrish Manufactures.\" See vol. vii. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Instead of the words \"loss of money,\" Faulkner in the\r\nreprint of 1725 has \"to be fined and imprisoned.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nHowever I cannot but warn you once more of the manifest destruction\r\nbefore your eyes, if you do not behave yourselves as you ought.\r\n\r\nI will therefore first tell you the plain story of the fact; and then I\r\nwill lay before you how you ought to act in common prudence, and\r\naccording to the laws of your country.\r\n\r\nThe fact is thus: It having been many years since COPPER HALFPENCE OR\r\nFARTHINGS were last coined in this kingdom, they have been for some time\r\nvery scarce,[12] and many counterfeits passed about under the name of\r\n_raps_, several applications were made to England, that we might have\r\nliberty to coin new ones, as in former times we did; but they did not\r\nsucceed. At last one Mr. Wood,[13] a mean ordinary man, a hardware\r\ndealer, procured a patent[14]under his Majesty's broad seal to coin\r\nfourscore and ten thousand pounds[15] in copper for this kingdom, which\r\npatent however did not oblige any one here to take them, unless they\r\npleased. Now you must know, that the halfpence and farthings in England\r\npass for very little more than they are worth. And if you should beat\r\nthem to pieces, and sell them to the brazier you would not lose above a\r\npenny in a shilling. But Mr. Wood made his halfpence of such base metal,\r\nand so much smaller than the English ones, that the brazier would not\r\ngive you above a penny of good money for a shilling of his; so that this\r\nsum of fourscore and ten thousand pounds in good gold and silver, must\r\nbe given for trash that will not be worth above eight or nine thousand\r\npounds real value. But this is not the worst, for Mr. Wood when he\r\npleases may by stealth send over another and another fourscore and ten\r\nthousand pounds, and buy all our goods for eleven parts in twelve, under\r\nthe value. For example, if a hatter sells a dozen of hats for five\r\nshillings a-piece, which amounts to three pounds, and receives the\r\npayment in Mr. Wood's coin, he really receives only the value of five\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: They had become scarce because they had been undervalued,\r\nand therefore sent out of the country in payment of goods bought. See\r\nPrior's \"Observations on Coin,\" issued in 1729, where it is stated that\r\nthis scarcity had occurred only within the last twenty years. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: William Wood (1671-1730) was an ironmaster of\r\nWolverhampton. In addition to the patent for coining copper halfpence\r\nwhich he obtained for Ireland, and to which full reference is made in\r\nthe introductory note to this first Drapier's Letter, Wood also obtained\r\na patent, in 1722, for coining halfpence, pence and twopence for the\r\nEnglish colonies in America. This latter patent fared no better than the\r\nIrish one. The coins introduced in America bear the dates 1722 and 1723,\r\nand are now much sought after by collectors. They are known as the Rosa\r\nAmerican coinage. A list of the poems and pamphlets on Wood, during the\r\nexcitement in Dublin, attending on the Drapier's Letters, will be found\r\nin the bibliography of Swift's works to be given in vol. xi. of this\r\nedition. See also Monck Mason's \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral.\" In\r\nthe original edition of the Letter, Wood's name is mis-spelt Woods. [T.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See the introductory note for the manner in which this\r\npatent was obtained. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: This is how the amount is named in the first edition; but\r\nthe amount in reality was £100,800 (the value of 360 tons of copper, as\r\nstated by the patent). Sir W. Scott prints this as £108,000. Coxe, in\r\nhis \"Memoirs of Sir Robert Walpole\" gives the amount as £100,000. Lecky\r\nstates it as £108,000. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will wonder how such an ordinary fellow as this Mr. Wood\r\ncould have so much interest as to get His Majesty's broad seal for so\r\ngreat a sum of bad money, to be sent to this poor country, and that all\r\nthe nobility and gentry here could not obtain the same favour, and let\r\nus make our own halfpence, as we used to do. Now I will make that matter\r\nvery plain. We are at a great distance from the King's court, and have\r\nnobody there to solicit for us, although a great number of lords and\r\nsquires, whose estates are here, and are our countrymen, spending all\r\ntheir lives and fortunes there. But this same Mr. Wood was able to\r\nattend constantly for his own interest; he is an Englishman and had\r\ngreat friends, and it seems knew very well where to give money, to\r\nthose that would speak to others that could speak to the King and could\r\ntell a fair story. And His Majesty, and perhaps the great lord or lords\r\nwho advised him, might think it was for our country's good; and so, as\r\nthe lawyers express it, \"the King was deceived in his grant,\" which\r\noften happens in all reigns. And I am sure if His Majesty knew that such\r\na patent, if it should take effect according to the desire of Mr. Wood,\r\nwould utterly ruin this kingdom, which hath given such great proofs of\r\nits loyalty, he would immediately recall it, and perhaps shew his\r\ndispleasure to somebody or other. But \"a word to the wise is enough.\"\r\nMost of you must have heard, with what anger our honourable House of\r\nCommons received an account of this Wood's patent.[16] There were\r\nseveral fine speeches made upon it, and plain proofs that it was all A\r\nWICKED CHEAT from the bottom to the top, and several smart votes were\r\nprinted, which that same Wood had the assurance to answer likewise in\r\nprint, and in so confident a way, as if he were a better man than our\r\nwhole Parliament put together.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The Irish House of Commons reported that the loss to the\r\ncountry, even if the patent were carried out as required, would amount\r\nto about 150 per cent.; and both Irish Houses of Parliament voted\r\naddresses against the coinage, and accused the patentee of fraud and\r\ndeceit. They asserted that the terms of the patent had not been\r\nfulfilled and \"that the circulation of the halfpence would be highly\r\nprejudicial to the revenue, destructive of the commerce, and of most\r\ndangerous consequences to the rights and properties of the subjects.\"\r\nSee introductory note. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Wood's indiscreet retort was published in the \"Flying\r\nPost\" October 8th, 1723. Later he boasted that he would, with Walpole's\r\nassistance, \"pour the coin down the throats of the people.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThis Wood, as soon as his patent was passed, or soon after, sends over\r\na great many barrels of these halfpence, to Cork and other sea-port\r\ntowns,[18] and to get them off offered an hundred pounds in his coin for\r\nseventy or eighty in silver. But the collectors of the King's customs\r\nvery honestly refused to take them, and so did almost everybody else.\r\nAnd since the Parliament hath condemned them, and desired the King that\r\nthey might be stopped, all the kingdom do abominate them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: At Dublin, Cork, Waterford and other ports, the merchants\r\nrefused to accept the copper coins. Monck Mason notes that \"in the\r\n'Dublin Gazette,' No. 2562, we meet with resolutions by the merchants of\r\nCork, dated the 25th of Aug., 1724, and like resolutions by those of\r\nWaterford, dated 22d Aug. wherein they declare, that, 'they will never\r\nreceive or utter in any payment, the halfpence or farthings coined by\r\nWilliam Wood; as they conceive the importing and uttering the same, to\r\nbe highly prejudicial to His Majesty's revenue, and to the trade of the\r\nkingdom': these resolutions are declared to be conformable to those of\r\nthe Trinity Guild, of merchants, of the city of Dublin, voted at their\r\nguild-hall, on the 18th day of the same month\" (Hist. St. Patrick's, p.\r\n346, note r). See also Appendix No. IX. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut Wood is still working underhand to force his halfpence upon us, and\r\nif he can by help of his friends in England prevail so far as to get an\r\norder that the commissioners and collectors of the King's money shall\r\nreceive them, and that the army is to be paid with them, then he thinks\r\nhis work shall be done. And this is the difficulty you will be under in\r\nsuch a case. For the common soldier when he goes to the market or\r\nalehouse will offer this money, and if it be refused, perhaps he will\r\nswagger and hector, and threaten to beat the butcher or alewife, or take\r\nthe goods by force, and throw them the bad halfpence. In this and the\r\nlike cases, the shopkeeper or victualler, or any other tradesman has no\r\nmore to do, than to demand ten times the price of his goods, if it is to\r\nbe paid in Wood's money; for example, twenty-pence of that money for a\r\nquart of ale, and so in all things else, and not part with his goods\r\ntill he gets the money.\r\n\r\nFor suppose you go to an alehouse with that base money, and the landlord\r\ngives you a quart for four of these halfpence, what must the victualler\r\ndo? His brewer will not be paid in that coin, or if the brewer should be\r\nsuch a fool, the farmers will not take it from them for their bere,[19]\r\nbecause they are bound by their leases to pay their rents in good and\r\nlawful money of England, which this is not, nor of Ireland neither, and\r\nthe 'squire their landlord will never be so bewitched to take such trash\r\nfor his land, so that it must certainly stop somewhere or other, and\r\nwherever it stops it is the same thing, and we are all undone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Bere = barley. Cf. A.S. _baerlic_, Icelandic, _barr_,\r\nmeaning barley, the grain used for making malt for the preparation of\r\nbeer. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe common weight of these halfpence is between four and five to an\r\nounce, suppose five, then three shillings and fourpence will weigh a\r\npound, and consequently twenty shillings will weigh six pound butter\r\nweight. Now there are many hundred farmers who pay two hundred pound a\r\nyear rent. Therefore when one of these farmers comes with his\r\nhalf-year's rent, which is one hundred pound, it will be at least six\r\nhundred pound weight, which is three horse load.\r\n\r\nIf a 'squire has a mind to come to town to buy clothes and wine and\r\nspices for himself and family, or perhaps to pass the winter here; he\r\nmust bring with him five or six horses loaden with sacks as the farmers\r\nbring their corn; and when his lady comes in her coach to our shops, it\r\nmust be followed by a car loaden with Mr. Wood's money. And I hope we\r\nshall have the grace to take it for no more than it is worth.\r\n\r\nThey say 'Squire Conolly[20] has sixteen thousand pounds a year, now if\r\nhe sends for his rent to town, as it is likely he does, he must have two\r\nhundred and forty horses to bring up his half-year's rent, and two or\r\nthree great cellars in his house for stowage. But what the bankers will\r\ndo I cannot tell. For I am assured, that some great bankers keep by them\r\nforty thousand pounds in ready cash to answer all payments, which sum,\r\nin Mr. Wood's money, would require twelve hundred horses to carry it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: William Conolly (d. 1729) was chosen Speaker of the Irish\r\nHouse of Commons on November 12th, 1715. He held this office until\r\nOctober 12th, 1729. Swift elsewhere says that Wharton sold Conolly the\r\noffice of Chief Commissioner of the Irish Revenue for £3,000. Between\r\nthe years 1706 and 1729 Conolly was ten times selected for the office of\r\na Lord Justice of Ireland. The remark in the text as to Conolly's income\r\nis repeated by Boulter (\"Letters,\" vol. i., p. 334), though the Primate\r\nwrites of £17,000 a year. The reference to Conolly is of set purpose,\r\nbecause Conolly had advocated the patent as against Midleton's\r\ncondemnation of it. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I am already resolved what to do; I have a pretty good\r\nshop of Irish stuffs and silks, and instead of taking Mr. Wood's bad\r\ncopper, I intend to truck with my neighbours the butchers, and bakers,\r\nand brewers, and the rest, goods for goods, and the little gold and\r\nsilver I have, I will keep by me like my heart's blood till better\r\ntimes, or till I am just ready to starve, and then I will buy Mr. Wood's\r\nmoney as my father did the brass money in K. James's time,[21] who could\r\nbuy ten pound of it with a guinea, and I hope to get as much for a\r\npistole, and so purchase bread from those who will be such fools as to\r\nsell it me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: James II., during his unsuccessful campaign in Ireland,\r\ndebased the coinage in order to make his funds meet the demands of his\r\nsoldiery. Archbishop King, in his work on the \"State of the Protestants\r\nin Ireland,\" describes the evil effects which this proceeding had: \"King\r\nJames's council used not to stick at the formalities of law or reason,\r\nand therefore vast quantities of brass money were coined, and made\r\ncurrent by a proclamation, dated 18th June, 1689, under severe\r\npenalties. The metal of which this money was made was the worst kind of\r\nbrass; old guns, and the refuse of metals were melted down to make it;\r\nworkmen rated it at threepence or a groat a pound, which being coined\r\ninto sixpences, shillings, or half-crowns, one pound weight made about\r\n£5. And by another proclamation, dated 1690, the half-crowns were called\r\nin, and being stamped anew, were made to pass for crowns; so that then,\r\nthree pence or four pence worth of metal made £10. There was coined in\r\nall, from the first setting up of the mint, to the rout at the Boyne,\r\nbeing about twelve months, £965,375. In this coin King James paid all\r\nhis appointments, and all that received the king's pay being generally\r\npapists, they forced the protestants to part with the goods out of their\r\nshops for this money, and to receive their debts in it; so that the loss\r\nby the brass money did, in a manner, entirely fall on the protestants,\r\nbeing defrauded (for I can call it no better) of about, £60,000 per\r\nmonth by this stratagem, which must, in a few months, have utterly\r\nexhausted them. When the papists had gotten most of their saleable goods\r\nfrom their protestant neighbours, and yet great quantities of brass\r\nmoney remained in their hands, they began to consider how many of them,\r\nwho had estates, had engaged them to protestants by judgments, statutes\r\nstaple, and mortgages; and to take this likewise from them they procured\r\na proclamation, dated 4 Feb. 1689, to make brass money current in all\r\npayments whatsoever.\" A proclamation of William III., dated July 10th,\r\n1690, ordered that these crown pieces of James should pass as of equal\r\nvalue with one penny each. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThese halfpence, if they once pass, will soon be counterfeit, because it\r\nmay be cheaply done, the stuff is so base. The Dutch likewise will\r\nprobably do the same thing, and send them over to us to pay for our\r\ngoods.[22] And Mr. Wood will never be at rest but coin on: So that in\r\nsome years we shall have at least five times fourscore and ten thousand\r\npounds of this lumber. Now the current money of this kingdom is not\r\nreckoned to be above four hundred thousand pounds in all, and while\r\nthere is a silver sixpence left these blood-suckers will never be quiet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The Dutch had previously counterfeited the debased coinage\r\nof Ireland and sent them over in payment for Irish manufactures. [T.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\nWhen once the kingdom is reduced to such a condition, I will tell you\r\nwhat must be the end: The gentlemen of estates will all turn off their\r\ntenants for want of payment, because as I told you before, the tenants\r\nare obliged by their leases to pay sterling which is lawful current\r\nmoney of England; then they will turn their own farmers, as too many of\r\nthem do already, run all into sheep where they can, keeping only such\r\nother cattle as are necessary, then they will be their own merchants and\r\nsend their wool and butter and hides and linen beyond sea for ready\r\nmoney and wine and spices and silks. They will keep only a few miserable\r\ncottiers.[23] The farmers must rob or beg, or leave their country. The\r\nshopkeepers in this and every other town, must break and starve: For it\r\nis the landed man that maintains the merchant, and shopkeeper, and\r\nhandicraftsman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: \"Unlike the peasant proprietor,\" says Lecky, \"and also\r\nunlike the mediaeval serf, the cottier had no permanent interest in the\r\nsoil, and no security for his future position. Unlike the English\r\nfarmer, he was no capitalist, who selects land as one of the many forms\r\nof profitable investment that are open to him. He was a man destitute of\r\nall knowledge and of all capital, who found the land the only thing that\r\nremained between himself and starvation. Rents in the lower grades of\r\ntenancies were regulated by competition, but it was competition between\r\na half-starving population, who had no other resources except the soil,\r\nand were therefore prepared to promise anything rather than be deprived\r\nof it. The landlord did nothing for them. They built their own mud\r\nhovels, planted their hedges, dug their ditches. They were half naked,\r\nhalf starved, utterly destitute of all providence and of all education,\r\nliable at any time to be turned adrift from their holdings, ground to\r\nthe dust by three great burdens--rack-rents, paid not to the landlord\r\nbut to the middleman; tithes, paid to the clergy--often the absentee\r\nclergy--of the church to which they did not belong; and dues, paid to\r\ntheir own priests\" (\"Hist, of Ireland,\" vol. i., pp. 214-215, ed. 1892).\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut when the 'squire turns farmer and merchant himself, all the good\r\nmoney he gets from abroad, he will hoard up or send for England, and\r\nkeep some poor tailor or weaver and the like in his own house, who will\r\nbe glad to get bread at any rate.\r\n\r\nI should never have done if I were to tell you all the miseries that we\r\nshall undergo if we be so foolish and wicked as to take this CURSED\r\nCOIN. It would be very hard if all Ireland should be put into one scale,\r\nand this sorry fellow Wood into the other, that Mr. Wood should weigh\r\ndown this whole kingdom, by which England gets above a million of good\r\nmoney every year clear into their pockets, and that is more than the\r\nEnglish do by all the world besides.\r\n\r\nBut your great comfort is, that as His Majesty's patent does not oblige\r\nyou to take this money, so the laws have not given the crown a power of\r\nforcing the subjects to take what money the King pleases: For then by\r\nthe same reason we might be bound to take pebble-stones or cockle-shells\r\nor stamped leather for current coin, if ever we should happen to live\r\nunder an ill prince, who might likewise by the same power make a guinea\r\npass for ten pounds, a shilling for twenty shillings, and so on, by\r\nwhich he would in a short time get all the silver and gold of the\r\nkingdom into his own hands, and leave us nothing but brass or leather or\r\nwhat he pleased. Neither is anything reckoned more cruel or oppressive\r\nin the French government than their common practice of calling in all\r\ntheir money after they have sunk it very low, and then coining it anew\r\nat a much higher value, which however is not the thousandth part so\r\nwicked as this abominable project of Mr. Wood. For the French give their\r\nsubjects silver for silver and gold for gold, but this fellow will not\r\nso much as give us good brass or copper for our gold and silver, nor\r\neven a twelfth part of their worth.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much, I will now go on to tell you the judgments of\r\nsome great lawyers in this matter, whom I fee'd on purpose for your\r\nsakes, and got their opinions under their hands, that I might be sure I\r\nwent upon good grounds.\r\n\r\nA famous law-book, called \"The Mirror of Justice,\"[24] discoursing of\r\nthe articles (or laws) ordained by our ancient kings declares the law to\r\nbe as follows: \"It was ordained that no king of this realm should\r\nchange, impair or amend the money or make any other money than of gold\r\nor silver without the assent of all the counties,\" that is, as my Lord\r\nCoke says,[25] without the assent of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: This was an important legal treatise often quoted by Coke.\r\nIts full title is: \"The Booke called, The Mirrour of Justices: Made by\r\nAndrew Home. With the book, called, The Diversity of Courts, And Their\r\nJurisdictions ... London ... 1646.\" The French edition was printed in\r\n1642 with the title, \"La somme appelle Mirroir des Justices: vel\r\nspeculum Justiciariorum, Factum per Andream Home.\" Coke quotes it from a\r\nmanuscript, as he died before it was printed. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: 2 Inst. 576. [ORIG. ED.]]\r\n\r\nThis book is very ancient, and of great authority for the time in which\r\nit was wrote, and with that character is often quoted by that great\r\nlawyer my Lord Coke.[26] By the law of England, the several metals are\r\ndivided into lawful or true metal and unlawful or false metal, the\r\nformer comprehends silver or gold; the latter all baser metals: That the\r\nformer is only to pass in payments appears by an act of Parliament[27]\r\nmade the twentieth year of Edward the First, called the \"Statute\r\nconcerning the Passing of Pence,\" which I give you here as I got it\r\ntranslated into English, for some of our laws at that time, were, as I\r\nam told writ in Latin: \"Whoever in buying or selling presumeth to refuse\r\nan halfpenny or farthing of lawful money, bearing the stamp which it\r\nought to have, let him be seized on as a contemner of the King's\r\nmajesty, and cast into prison.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: 2 Inst. 576-577. [ORIG. ED.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: 2 Inst. 577. [ORIG. ED.]]\r\n\r\nBy this statute, no person is to be reckoned a contemner of the King's\r\nmajesty, and for that crime to be committed to prison; but he who\r\nrefuses to accept the King's coin made of lawful metal, by which, as I\r\nobserved before, silver and gold only are intended.\r\n\r\nThat this is the true construction of the act, appears not only from the\r\nplain meaning of the words, but from my Lord Coke's observation upon it.\r\n\"By this act\" (says he) \"it appears, that no subject can be forced to\r\ntake in buying or selling or other payments, any money made but of\r\nlawful metal; that is, of silver or gold.\"[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: 2 Inst. 577. [ORIG. ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe law of England gives the King all mines of gold and silver, but not\r\nthe mines of other metals, the reason of which prerogative or power, as\r\nit is given by my Lord Coke[29] is, because money can be made of gold\r\nand silver, but not of other metals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: 2 Inst. 577. [ORIG. ED.]]\r\n\r\nPursuant to this opinion halfpence and farthings were anciently made of\r\nsilver, which is most evident from the act of Parliament of Henry the\r\n4th. chap. 4.[30] by which it is enacted as follows: \"Item, for the\r\ngreat scarcity that is at present within the realm of England of\r\nhalfpence and farthings of silver, it is ordained and established that\r\nthe third part of all the money of silver plate which shall be brought\r\nto the bullion, shall be made in halfpence and farthings.\" This shews\r\nthat by the word \"halfpenny\" and \"farthing\" of lawful money in that\r\nstatute concerning the passing of pence, are meant a small coin in\r\nhalfpence and farthings of silver.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Swift makes an incorrect reference here. The act was 4\r\nHenry IV., cap. 10. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThis is further manifest from the statute of the ninth year of Edward\r\nthe 3d. chap. 3. which enacts, \"That no sterling halfpenny or farthing\r\nbe molten for to make vessel, nor any other thing by the goldsmiths, nor\r\nothers, upon forfeiture of the money so molten\" (or melted).\r\n\r\nBy another act in this King's reign[31] black money was not to be\r\ncurrent in England, and by an act made in the eleventh year of his reign\r\nchap. 5. galley halfpence were not to pass, what kind of coin these were\r\nI do not know, but I presume they were made of base metal, and that\r\nthese acts were no new laws, but farther declarations of the old laws\r\nrelating to the coin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: The act against black money was passed in Henry IV.'s\r\nreign not Edward III.'s. The \"galley halfpence\" were dealt with by 9\r\nHen. IV., cap. 4. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThus the law stands in relation to coin, nor is there any example to the\r\ncontrary, except one in Davis's Reports,[32] who tells us that in the\r\ntime of Tyrone's rebellion Queen Elizabeth ordered money of mixed metal\r\nto be coined in the Tower of London, and sent over hither for payment of\r\nthe army, obliging all people to receive it and commanding that all\r\nsilver money should be taken only as bullion, that is, for as much as it\r\nweighed. Davis tells us several particulars in this matter too long here\r\nto trouble you with, and that the privy-council of this kingdom obliged\r\na merchant in England to receive this mixed money for goods transmitted\r\nhither.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: This refers to Sir John Davies's \"Abridgement of Sir\r\nEdward Coke's Reports,\" first published in 1651. Davies was\r\nAttorney-General for Ireland and a poet. His works have been collected\r\nand edited by Dr. A.B. Grosart in the Fuller Worthies Library. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Charles I., during the Civil War, paid his forces with\r\ndebased coin struck by him. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut this proceeding is rejected by all the best lawyers as contrary to\r\nlaw, the Privy-council here having no such power. And besides it is to\r\nbe considered, that the Queen was then under great difficulties by a\r\nrebellion in this kingdom assisted from Spain, and whatever is done in\r\ngreat exigences and dangerous times should never be an example to\r\nproceed by in seasons of peace and quietness.\r\n\r\nI will now, my dear friends to save you the trouble, set before you in\r\nshort, what the law obliges you to do, and what it does not oblige you\r\nto.\r\n\r\nFirst, You are obliged to take all money in payments which is coined by\r\nthe King and is of the English standard or weight, provided it be of\r\ngold or silver.\r\n\r\nSecondly, You are not obliged to take any money which is not of gold or\r\nsilver, no not the halfpence, or farthings of England, or of any other\r\ncountry, and it is only for convenience, or ease, that you are content\r\nto take them, because the custom of coining silver halfpence and\r\nfarthings hath long been left off, I will suppose on account of their\r\nbeing subject to be lost.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Much less are you obliged to take those vile halfpence of that\r\nsame Wood, by which you must lose almost eleven-pence in every shilling.\r\n\r\nTherefore my friends, stand to it one and all, refuse this filthy trash.\r\nIt is no treason to rebel against Mr. Wood. His Majesty in his patent\r\nobliges nobody to take these halfpence,[34] our gracious prince hath no\r\nso ill advisers about him; or if he had, yet you see the laws have not\r\nleft it in the King's power, to force us to take any coin but what is\r\nlawful, of right standard gold and silver, therefore you have nothing to\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The words of the patent are \"to pass and to be received as\r\ncurrent money; by such as shall or will, voluntarily and wittingly, and\r\nnot otherwise, receive the same\" (the halfpence and farthings). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAnd let me in the next place apply myself particularly to you who are\r\nthe poor sort of tradesmen, perhaps you may think you will not be so\r\ngreat losers as the rich, if these halfpence should pass, because you\r\nseldom see any silver, and your customers come to your shops or stalls\r\nwith nothing but brass, which you likewise find hard to be got, but you\r\nmay take my word, whenever this money gains footing among you, you will\r\nbe utterly undone; if you carry these halfpence to a shop for tobacco\r\nor brandy, or any other thing you want, the shopkeeper will advance his\r\ngoods accordingly, or else he must break, and leave the key under the\r\ndoor. Do you think I will sell you a yard of tenpenny stuff for twenty\r\nof Mr. Wood's halfpence? No, not under two hundred at least, neither\r\nwill I be at the trouble of counting, but weigh them in a lump; I will\r\ntell you one thing further, that if Mr. Wood's project should take, it\r\nwill ruin even our beggars; For when I give a beggar an halfpenny, it\r\nwill quench his thirst, or go a good way to fill his belly, but the\r\ntwelfth part of a halfpenny will do him no more service than if I should\r\ngive him three pins out of my sleeve.\r\n\r\nIn short these halfpence are like \"the accursed thing, which\" as the\r\nScripture tells us, \"the children of Israel were forbidden to touch,\"\r\nthey will run about like the plague and destroy every one who lays his\r\nhands upon them. I have heard scholars talk of a man who told a king\r\nthat he had invented a way to torment people by putting them into a bull\r\nof brass with fire under it, but the prince put the projector first into\r\nhis own brazen bull to make the experiment;[35] this very much resembles\r\nthe project of Mr. Wood, and the like of this may possibly be Mr. Wood's\r\nfate, that the brass he contrived to torment this kingdom with, may\r\nprove his own torment, and his destruction at last.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: It is curious to find Swift so referring to Phalaris, of\r\nwhom he had heard so much in the days of the \"Battle of the Books.\" [SIR\r\nH. CRAIK.]]\r\n\r\nN.B. The author of this paper is informed by persons who have made it\r\ntheir business to be exact in their observations on the true value of\r\nthese halfpence, that any person may expect to get a quart of twopenny\r\nale for thirty-six of them.\r\n\r\nI desire all persons may keep this paper carefully by them to refresh\r\ntheir memories whenever they shall have farther notice of Mr. Wood's\r\nhalfpence, or any other the like imposture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\nTO MR. HARDING THE PRINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of the August of 1724, the Committee of Inquiry\r\nhad finished their report on Wood's patent. Somehow, an advance notice\r\nof the contents of the report found its way, probably directed by\r\nWalpole himself, into the pages of a London journal, from whence it was\r\nreprinted in Dublin, in Harding's Newspaper on the 1st of August. The\r\nnotice stated that the Committee had recommended a reduction in the\r\namount of coin Wood was to issue to £40,000. It informed the public that\r\nthe report notified that Wood was willing to take goods in exchange for\r\nhis coins, if enough silver were not to be had, and he agreed to\r\nrestrict the amount of each payment to 5-1/2_d_. But a pretty broad hint\r\nwas given that a refusal to accept the compromise offered might possibly\r\nprovoke the higher powers to an assertion of the prerogative.\r\n\r\nWalpole also had already endeavoured to calm the situation by consenting\r\nto a minute examination of the coins themselves at the London Mint. The\r\nLords Commissioners had instructed Sir Isaac Newton, the Master of the\r\nMint, Edward Southwell, and Thomas Scroope, to make an assay of Wood's\r\nmoney. The report of the assayists was issued on April 27th, 1724;[1]\r\nand certified that the coins submitted had been tested and found to be\r\ncorrect both as to weight and quality. In addition to this evidence of\r\ngood faith, Walpole had nominated Carteret in place of the Duke of\r\nGrafton to the Lord-Lieutenancy. Carteret was a favourite with the best\r\nmen in Ireland, and a man of culture as well as ability. It was hoped\r\nthat his influence would smooth down the members of the opposition by an\r\nacceptance of the altered measure. He was in the way in London, and he\r\nmight be of great service in Dublin; so to Dublin he went.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A full reprint of this report is given in Appendix II.]\r\n\r\nBut Walpole had not reckoned with the Drapier. In the paragraph in\r\nHarding's sheet, Swift saw a diplomatist's move to win the game by\r\ndiplomatic methods. Compromise was the one result Swift was determined\r\nto render impossible; and the Drapier's second letter, \"To Mr. Harding\r\nthe Printer,\" renews the conflict with yet stronger passion and with\r\neven more satirical force. It is evident Swift was bent now on raising a\r\ndeeper question than merely this of the acceptance or refusal of Wood's\r\nhalfpence and farthings. There was a principle here that had to be\r\ninsisted and a right to be safeguarded. Mr. Churton Collins ably\r\nexpresses Swift's attitude at this juncture when he says:[2] \"Nothing\r\ncan be more certain than that it was Swift's design from the very\r\nbeginning to make the controversy with Wood the basis of far more\r\nextensive operations. It had furnished him with the means of waking\r\nIreland from long lethargy into fiery life. He looked to it to furnish\r\nhim with the means of elevating her from servitude to independence, from\r\nignominy to honour. His only fear was lest the spirit which he had\r\nkindled should burn itself out or be prematurely quenched. And of this\r\nhe must have felt that there was some danger, when it was announced that\r\nEngland had given way much more than it was expected she would give way,\r\nand much more than she had ever given way before.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Jonathan Swift,\" pp. 179-180.]\r\n\r\nThis letter to Harding was but the preliminary leading up to the famous\r\nfourth letter \"to the whole people of Ireland.\" It was also an\r\nintroduction to, and preparation of the public mind for, the drastic\r\ncriticism of the Privy Council's Report, the arrival of which was\r\nexpected shortly.\r\n\r\nThe present text of this second letter is that given by Sir W. Scott,\r\ncollated with the copies of the original edition in the possession of\r\nthe late Colonel F. Grant and in the British Museum. It has also been\r\ncompared with Faulkner's issue of 1725, in \"Fraud Detected.\"\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                 A\r\n              *LETTER*\r\n                 TO\r\n     Mr. _Harding_ the Printer,\r\n         Upon Occasion of a\r\n\r\n           **PARAGRAPH**\r\n              *IN HIS*\r\n           **News-Paper**\r\n           of _Aug_. 1st.\r\n\r\nRelating to Mr. _Wood's_ Half-pence.\r\n\r\n       _By_ M.B. _Drapier_.\r\n    AUTHOR of the LETTER to the\r\n         SHOP-KEEPERS, &c.\r\n\r\n  DUBLIN: Printed by _J.

HARDING THE PRINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, In your Newsletter of the 1st. instant there is a paragraph dated\r\nfrom London, July 25th. relating to Wood's halfpence; whereby it is\r\nplain what I foretold in my \"Letter to the Shopkeepers, &c.\" that this\r\nvile fellow would never be at rest, and that the danger of our ruin\r\napproaches nearer, and therefore the kingdom requires NEW and FRESH\r\nWARNING; however I take that paragraph to be, in a great measure, an\r\nimposition upon the public, at least I hope so, because I am informed\r\nthat Wood is generally his own newswriter. I cannot but observe from\r\nthat paragraph that this public enemy of ours, not satisfied to ruin us\r\nwith his trash, takes every occasion to treat this kingdom with the\r\nutmost contempt. He represents \"several of our merchants and traders\r\nupon examination before a committee of council, agreeing that there was\r\nthe utmost necessity of copper money here, before his patent, so that\r\nseveral gentlemen have been forced to tally with their workmen and give\r\nthem bits of cards sealed and subscribed with their names.\" What then?\r\nIf a physician prescribes to a patient a dram of physic, shall a rascal\r\napothecary cram him with a pound, and mix it up with poison? And is not\r\na landlord's hand and seal to his own labourers a better security for\r\nfive or ten shillings, than Wood's brass seven times below the real\r\nvalue, can be to the kingdom, for an hundred and four thousand\r\npounds?[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Thus in original edition. £108,000 is the amount generally\r\ngiven. See note on p. 15. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut who are these merchants and traders of Ireland that make this report\r\nof \"the utmost necessity we are under of copper money\"? They are only a\r\nfew betrayers of their country, confederates with Wood, from whom they\r\nare to purchase a great quantity of his coin, perhaps at half value, and\r\nvend it among us to the ruin of the public, and their own private\r\nadvantage. Are not these excellent witnesses, upon whose integrity the\r\nfate of a kingdom must depend, who are evidences in their own cause, and\r\nsharers in this work of iniquity?\r\n\r\nIf we could have deserved the liberty of coining for ourselves, as we\r\nformerly did, and why we have not _is everybody's wonder as well as\r\nmine_,[4] ten thousand pounds might have been coined here in Dublin of\r\nonly one-fifth below the intrinsic value, and this sum, with the stock\r\nof halfpence we then had, would have been sufficient:[5] But Wood by his\r\nemissaries, enemies to God and this kingdom, hath taken care to buy up\r\nas many of our old halfpence as he could, and from thence the present\r\nwant of change arises; to remove which, by Mr. Wood's remedy, would be,\r\nto cure a scratch on the finger by cutting off the arm. But supposing\r\nthere were not one farthing of change in the whole nation, I will\r\nmaintain, that five and twenty thousand pounds would be a sum fully\r\nsufficient to answer all our occasions. I am no inconsiderable\r\nshopkeeper in this town, I have discoursed with several of my own and\r\nother trades, with many gentlemen both of city and country, and also\r\nwith great numbers of farmers, cottagers, and labourers, who all agree\r\nthat two shillings in change for every family would be more than\r\nnecessary in all dealings. Now by the largest computation (even before\r\nthat grievous discouragement of agriculture, which hath so much lessened\r\nour numbers [6]) the souls in this kingdom are computed to be one\r\nmillion and a half, which, allowing but six to a family, makes two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand families, and consequently two shillings to\r\neach family will amount only to five and twenty thousand pounds, whereas\r\nthis honest liberal hardwareman Wood would impose upon us above four\r\ntimes that sum.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Time and again Ireland had petitioned the King of England\r\nfor the establishment of a mint in Dublin. Both Houses of Parliament\r\naddressed King Charles I. in 1634, begging for a mint which should coin\r\nmoney in Ireland of the same standard and values as those of England,\r\nand allowing the profits to the government. Wentworth supported the\r\naddress; but it was refused (Carte's \"Ormond,\" vol. i., pp. 79-80). When\r\nLord Cornwallis's petition for a renewal of his patent for minting coins\r\nwas presented in 1700, it was referred to a committee of the Lords\r\nJustices. In their report the Lords Justices condemned the system in\r\nvogue, and urged the establishment of a mint, in which the coining of\r\nmoney should be in the hands of the government and in those of a\r\nsubject. No notice was taken of this advice. See Lecky's \"Ireland,\" vol.\r\ni., p. 448 (ed 1892) [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Boulter stated that £10,000 or £15,000 would have amply\r\nfulfilled the demand (\"Letters,\" vol. i., pp. 4, 11). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: It was not alone the direct discouragement of agriculture\r\nwhich lessened the population. This result was also largely brought\r\nabout by the anti-Catholic legislation of Queen Anne's reign, which\r\n\"reduced the Roman Catholics to a state of depression,\" and caused\r\nthousands of them to go elsewhere for the means of living. See\r\nCrawford's \"Ireland,\" vol. ii., pp. 264-267. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nYour paragraph relates further, that Sir Isaac Newton reported an assay\r\ntaken at the Tower of Wood's metal, by which it appears, that Wood had\r\nin all respects performed his contract[7]. His contract! With whom? Was\r\nit with the parliament or people of Ireland? Are not they to be the\r\npurchasers? But they detest, abhor, and reject it, as corrupt,\r\nfraudulent, mingled with dirt and trash. Upon which he grows angry, goes\r\nto law, and will impose his goods upon us by force.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: For the full text of Newton's report see Appendix, No. II.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut your Newsletter says that an assay was made of the coin. How\r\nimpudent and insupportable is this? Wood takes care to coin a dozen or\r\ntwo halfpence of good metal, sends them to the Tower and they are\r\napproved, and these must answer all that he hath already coined or shall\r\ncoin for the future. It is true indeed, that a gentleman often sends to\r\nmy shop for a pattern of stuff, I cut it fairly off, and if he likes it,\r\nhe comes or sends and compares the pattern with the whole piece, and\r\nprobably we come to a bargain. But if I were to buy an hundred sheep,\r\nand the grazier should bring me one single wether fat and well fleeced\r\nby way of pattern, and expect the same price round for the whole\r\nhundred, without suffering me to see them before he was paid, or giving\r\nme good security to restore my money for those that were lean or shorn\r\nor scabby, I would be none of his customer. I have heard of a man who\r\nhad a mind to sell his house, and therefore carried a piece of brick in\r\nhis pocket, which he shewed as a pattern to encourage purchasers: And\r\nthis is directly the case in point with Mr. Wood's assay.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Monck Mason remarks on this assay that \"the assay-masters\r\ndo not report that Mr. Wood's coinage was superior to that of former\r\nkings, but only to those specimens of such coinages as were exhibited by\r\nMr. Wood, which, it is admitted were much worn. Whether the money coined\r\nin the preceding reign was good or bad is in fact nothing to the\r\npurpose.\" \"'What argument,'\" quotes Monck Mason from the tract issued in\r\n1724 entitled, \"A Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland, in\r\ntheir unanimous refusal of Mr. Wood's Copper Money,\" \"'can be drawn from\r\nthe badness of our former coinages but this, that because we have\r\nformerly been cheated by our coiners, we ought to suffer Mr. Wood to\r\ncheat us over again? Whereas, one reason for our so vigorously opposing\r\nMr. Wood's coinage, is, because we have always been imposed upon in our\r\ncopper money, and we find he is treading exactly in the steps of his\r\npredecessors, and thinks he has a right to cheat us because he can shew\r\na precedent for it.' In truth, there was a vast number of counterfeits\r\nof those coins, which had been imported, chiefly from Scotland, as\r\nappears from a proclamation prohibiting the Importation of them in 1697\"\r\n(\"History St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" p, 340, note d.) [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe next part of the paragraph contains Mr. Wood's voluntary proposals\r\nfor \"preventing any future objections or apprehensions.\"\r\n\r\nHis first proposal is, that \"whereas he hath already coined seventeen\r\nthousand pounds, and has copper prepared to make it up forty thousand\r\npounds, he will be content to coin no more, unless the EXIGENCES OF\r\nTRADE REQUIRE IT, though his patent empowers him to coin a far greater\r\nquantity.\"\r\n\r\nTo which if I were to answer it should be thus: \"Let Mr. Wood and his\r\ncrew of founders and tinkers coin on till there is not an old kettle\r\nleft in the kingdom: let them coin old leather, tobacco-pipe clay or the\r\ndirt in the streets, and call their trumpery by what name they please\r\nfrom a guinea to a farthing, we are not under any concern to know how he\r\nand his tribe or accomplices think fit to employ themselves.\" But I hope\r\nand trust, that we are all to a man fully determined to have nothing to\r\ndo with him or his ware.\r\n\r\nThe King has given him a patent to coin halfpence, but hath not obliged\r\nus to take them, and I have already shewn in my \"Letter to the\r\nShopkeepers, &c.\" that the law hath not left it in the power of the\r\nprerogative to compel the subject to take any money, beside gold and\r\nsilver of the right sterling and standard.\r\n\r\nWood further proposes, (if I understand him right, for his expressions\r\nare dubious) that \"he will not coin above forty thousand pounds, unless\r\nthe exigences of trade require it.\" First, I observe that this sum of\r\nforty thousand pounds is almost double to what I proved to be sufficient\r\nfor the whole kingdom, although we had not one of our old halfpence\r\nleft. Again I ask, who is to be judge when the exigences of trade\r\nrequire it? Without doubt he means himself, for as to us of this poor\r\nkingdom, who must be utterly ruined if his project should succeed, we\r\nwere never once consulted till the matter was over, and he will judge of\r\nour exigences by his own; neither will these be ever at an end till he\r\nand his accomplices will think they have enough: And it now appears that\r\nhe will not be content with all our gold and silver, but intends to buy\r\nup our goods and manufactures with the same coin.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into examination of the prices for which he now\r\nproposes to sell his halfpence, or what he calls his copper, by the\r\npound; I have said enough of it in my former letter, and it hath\r\nlikewise been considered by others. It is certain that by his own first\r\ncomputation, we were to pay three shillings for what was intrinsically\r\nworth but one,[9] although it had been of the true weight and standard\r\nfor which he pretended to have contracted; but there is so great a\r\ndifference both in weight and badness in several of his coins that some\r\nof them have been nine in ten below the intrinsic value, and most of\r\nthem six or seven.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The report of the Committee of the Privy Council which sat\r\non Wood's coinage, stated that copper ready for minting cost eighteen\r\npence per pound before it was brought into the Mint at the Tower of\r\nLondon. See the Report prefixed to Letter III. and Appendix II., in\r\nwhich it is also stated that Wood's copper was worth thirteen pence per\r\npound. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Newton's assay report says that Wood's pieces were of\r\nunequal weight. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nHis last proposal being of a peculiar strain and nature, deserves to be\r\nvery particularly considered, both on account of the matter and the\r\nstyle. It is as follows.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, in consideration of the direful apprehensions which prevail in\r\nIreland, that Mr. Wood will by such coinage drain them of their gold and\r\nsilver, he proposes to take their manufactures in exchange, and that no\r\nperson be obliged to receive more than fivepence halfpenny at one\r\npayment.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, Observe this little impudent hardwareman turning into ridicule\r\n\"the direful apprehensions of a whole kingdom,\" priding himself as the\r\ncause of them, and daring to prescribe what no King of England ever\r\nattempted, how far a whole nation shall be obliged to take his brass\r\ncoin. And he has reason to insult; for sure there was never an example\r\nin history, of a great kingdom kept in awe for above a year in daily\r\ndread of utter destruction, not by a powerful invader at the head of\r\ntwenty thousand men, not by a plague or a famine, not by a tyrannical\r\nprince (for we never had one more gracious) or a corrupt administration,\r\nbut by one single, diminutive, insignificant, mechanic.\r\n\r\nBut to go on. To remove our \"direful apprehensions that he will drain us\r\nof our gold and silver by his coinage:\" This little arbitrary\r\nmock-monarch most graciously offers to \"take our manufactures in\r\nexchange.\" Are our Irish understandings indeed so low in his opinion? Is\r\nnot this the very misery we complain of? That his cursed project will\r\nput us under the necessity of selling our goods for what is equal to\r\nnothing. How would such a proposal sound from France or Spain or any\r\nother country we deal with, if they should offer to deal with us only\r\nupon this condition, that we should take their money at ten times higher\r\nthan the intrinsic value? Does Mr. Wood think, for instance, that we\r\nwill sell him a stone of wool for a parcel of his counters not worth\r\nsixpence, when we can send it to England and receive as many shillings\r\nin gold and silver? Surely there was never heard such a compound of\r\nimpudence, villainy and folly.\r\n\r\nHis proposals conclude with perfect high treason. He promises, that no\r\nperson shall be _obliged_ to receive more than fivepence halfpenny of\r\nhis coin in one payment: By which it is plain, that he pretends to\r\n_oblige_ every subject in this kingdom to take so much in every payment,\r\nif it be offered; whereas his patent obliges no man, nor can the\r\nprerogative by law claim such a power, as I have often observed; so\r\nthat here Mr. Wood takes upon him the entire legislature, and an\r\nabsolute dominion over the properties of the whole nation.\r\n\r\nGood God! Who are this wretch's advisers? Who are his supporters,\r\nabettors, encouragers, or sharers? Mr. Wood will _oblige_ me to take\r\nfivepence halfpenny of his brass in every payment! And I will shoot Mr.\r\nWood and his deputies through the head, like highwaymen or\r\nhousebreakers, if they dare to force one farthing of their coin upon me\r\nin the payment of an hundred pounds. It is no loss of honour to submit\r\nto the lion, but who, with the figure of a man, can think with patience\r\nof being devoured alive by a rat. He has laid a tax upon the people of\r\nIreland of seventeen shillings at least in the pound; a tax I say, not\r\nonly upon lands, but interest-money, goods, manufactures, the hire of\r\nhandicraftsmen, labourers, and servants. Shopkeepers look to yourselves.\r\nWood will _oblige_ and force you to take fivepence halfpenny of his\r\ntrash in every payment, and many of you receive twenty, thirty, forty\r\npayments in a day, or else you can hardly find bread: And pray consider\r\nhow much that will amount to in a year: Twenty times fivepence halfpenny\r\nis nine shillings and twopence, which is above an hundred and sixty\r\npounds a year, whereof you will be losers of at least one hundred and\r\nforty pounds by taking your payments in his money. If any of you be\r\ncontent to deal with Mr. Wood on such conditions they may. But for my\r\nown particular, \"let his money perish with him.\" If the famous Mr.\r\nHampden rather chose to go to prison, than pay a few shillings to King\r\nCharles 1st. without authority of Parliament, I will rather choose to be\r\nhanged than have all my substance taxed at seventeen shillings in the\r\npound, at the arbitrary will and pleasure of the venerable Mr. Wood.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph concludes thus. \"N.B.\" (that is to say _nota bene_, or\r\n_mark well_), \"No evidence appeared from Ireland, or elsewhere, to prove\r\nthe mischiefs complained of, or any abuses whatsoever committed in the\r\nexecution of the said grant.\"\r\n\r\nThe impudence of this remark exceeds all that went before. First; the\r\nHouse of Commons in Ireland, which represents the whole people of the\r\nkingdom; and secondly the Privy-council, addressed His Majesty against\r\nthese halfpence. What could be done more to express the universal sense\r\nand opinion of the nation? If his copper were diamonds, and the kingdom\r\nwere entirely against it, would not that be sufficient to reject it?\r\nMust a committee of the House of Commons, and our whole Privy-council go\r\nover to argue _pro_ and _con_ with Mr. Wood? To what end did the King\r\ngive his patent for coining of halfpence in Ireland? Was it not, because\r\nit was represented to his sacred Majesty, that such a coinage would be\r\nof advantage to the good of this kingdom, and of all his subjects here?\r\nIt is to the patentee's peril if his representation be false, and the\r\nexecution of his patent be fraudulent and corrupt. Is he so wicked and\r\nfoolish to think that his patent was given him to ruin a million and a\r\nhalf of people, that he might be a gainer of three or four score\r\nthousand pounds to himself? Before he was at the charge of passing a\r\npatent, much more of raking up so much filthy dross, and stamping it\r\nwith His Majesty's \"image and superscription,\" should he not first in\r\ncommon sense, in common equity, and common manners, have consulted the\r\nprincipal party concerned; that is to say, the people of the kingdom,\r\nthe House of Lords or Commons, or the Privy-council? If any foreigner\r\nshould ask us, \"whose image and superscription\" there is in Wood's coin,\r\nwe should be ashamed to tell him, it was Caesar's. In that great want of\r\ncopper halfpence, which he alleges we were, our city set up our Caesar's\r\nstatue[11] in excellent copper, at an expense that is equal in value to\r\nthirty thousand pounds of his coin: And we will not receive his _image_\r\nin worse metal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: An equestrian statue of George I. at Essex Bridge, Dublin,\r\n[F.]]\r\n\r\nI observe many of our people putting a melancholy case on this subject.\r\n\"It is true\" say they, \"we are all undone if Wood's halfpence must pass;\r\nbut what shall we do, if His Majesty puts out a proclamation commanding\r\nus to take them?\" This hath been often dinned in my ears. But I desire\r\nmy countrymen to be assured that there is nothing in it. The King never\r\nissues out a proclamation but to enjoin what the law permits him. He\r\nwill not issue out a proclamation against law, or if such a thing\r\nshould happen by a mistake, we are no more obliged to obey it than to\r\nrun our heads into the fire. Besides, His Majesty will never command us\r\nby a proclamation, what he does not offer to command us in the patent\r\nitself. There he leaves it to our discretion, so that our destruction\r\nmust be entirely owing to ourselves. Therefore let no man be afraid of a\r\nproclamation, which will never be granted; and if it should, yet upon\r\nthis occasion, will be of no force. The King's revenues here are near\r\nfour hundred thousand pounds a year, can you think his ministers will\r\nadvise him to take them in Wood's brass, which will reduce the value to\r\nfifty thousand pounds. England gets a million sterl. by this nation,\r\nwhich, if this project goes on, will be almost reduced to nothing: And\r\ndo you think those who live in England upon Irish estates will be\r\ncontent to take an eighth or a tenth part, by being paid in Wood's\r\ndross?\r\n\r\nIf Wood and his confederates were not convinced of our stupidity, they\r\nnever would have attempted so audacious an enterprise. He now sees a\r\nspirit hath been raised against him, and he only watches till it begins\r\nto flag, he goes about \"watching\" when to \"devour us.\" He hopes we shall\r\nbe weary of contending with him, and at last out of ignorance, or fear,\r\nor of being perfectly tired with opposition, we shall be forced to\r\nyield. And therefore I confess it is my chief endeavour to keep up your\r\nspirits and resentments. If I tell you there is a precipice under you,\r\nand that if you go forwards you will certainly break your necks. If I\r\npoint to it before your eyes, must I be at the trouble of repeating it\r\nevery morning? Are our people's \"hearts waxed gross\"? Are \"their ears\r\ndull of hearing,\" and have \"they closed their eyes\"? I fear there are\r\nsome few vipers among us, who, for ten or twenty pounds gain, would sell\r\ntheir souls and their country, though at last it would end in their own\r\nruin as well as ours. Be not like \"the deaf adder, who refuses to hear\r\nthe voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely.\"\r\n\r\nThough my letter be directed to you, Mr. Harding, yet I intend it for\r\nall my countrymen. I have no interest in this affair but what is common\r\nto the public. I can live better than many others, I have some gold and\r\nsilver by me, and a shop well furnished, and shall be able to make a\r\nshift when many of my betters are starving. But I am grieved to see the\r\ncoldness and indifference of many people, with whom I discourse. Some\r\nare afraid of a proclamation, others shrug up their shoulders, and cry,\r\n\"What would you have us do?\" Some give out, there is no danger at all.\r\nOthers are comforted that it will be a common calamity and they shall\r\nfare no worse than their neighbours. Will a man, who hears midnight\r\nrobbers at his door, get out of bed, and raise his family for a common\r\ndefence, and shall a whole kingdom lie in a lethargy, while Mr. Wood\r\ncomes at the head of his confederates to rob them of all they have, to\r\nruin us and our posterity for ever? If an highwayman meets you on the\r\nroad, you give him your money to save your life, but, God be thanked,\r\nMr. Wood cannot touch a hair of your heads. You have all the laws of God\r\nand man on your side. When he or his accomplices offer you his dross it\r\nis but saying no, and you are safe. If a madman should come to my shop\r\nwith an handful of dirt raked out of the kennel, and offer it in payment\r\nfor ten yards of stuff, I would pity or laugh at him, or, if his\r\nbehaviour deserved it, kick him out of my doors. And if Mr. Wood comes\r\nto demand any gold and silver, or commodities for which I have paid my\r\ngold and silver, in exchange for his trash, can he deserve or expect\r\nbetter treatment?\r\n\r\nWhen the evil day is come (if it must come) let us mark and observe\r\nthose who presume to offer these halfpence in payment. Let their names,\r\nand trades, and places of abode be made public, that every one may be\r\naware of them, as betrayers of their country, and confederates with Mr.\r\nWood. Let them be watched at markets and fairs, and let the first honest\r\ndiscoverer give the word about, that Wood's halfpence have been offered,\r\nand caution the poor innocent people not to receive them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have been too tedious; but there would never be an end, if I\r\nattempted to say all that this melancholy subject will bear. I will\r\nconclude with humbly offering one proposal, which, if it were put in\r\npractice, would blow up this destructive project at once. Let some\r\nskilful judicious pen draw up an advertisement to the following purpose.\r\n\r\nThat \"Whereas one William Wood hardware-man, now or lately sojourning\r\nin the city of London, hath, by many misrepresentations, procured a\r\npatent for coining an hundred and forty thousand pounds[12] in copper\r\nhalfpence for this kingdom, which is a sum five times greater than our\r\noccasions require. And whereas it is notorious that the said Wood hath\r\ncoined his halfpence of such base metal and false weight, that they are,\r\nat least, six parts in seven below the real value. And whereas we have\r\nreason to apprehend, that the said Wood may, at any time hereafter,\r\nclandestinely coin as many more halfpence as he pleases. And whereas the\r\nsaid patent neither doth nor can _oblige_ His Majesty's subjects to\r\nreceive the said halfpence in any payment, but leaves it to their\r\nvoluntary choice, because, by law the subject cannot be _obliged_ to\r\ntake any money except gold or silver. And whereas, contrary to the\r\nletter and meaning of the said patent, the said Wood hath declared that\r\nevery person shall be _obliged_ to take fivepence halfpenny of his coin\r\nin every payment. And whereas the House of Commons and Privy-council\r\nhave severally addressed his Most Sacred Majesty, representing the ill\r\nconsequences which the said coinage may have upon this kingdom. And\r\nlastly whereas it is universally agreed, that the whole nation to a man\r\n(except Mr. Wood and his confederates) are in the utmost apprehensions\r\nof the ruinous consequences, that must follow from the said coinage.\r\nTherefore we whose names are underwritten, being persons of considerable\r\nestates in this kingdom, and residers therein, do unanimously resolve\r\nand declare that we will never receive, one farthing or halfpenny of the\r\nsaid Wood's coining, and that we will direct all our tenants to refuse\r\nthe said coin from any person whatsoever; Of which that they may not be\r\nignorant, we have sent them a copy of this advertisement, to be read to\r\nthem by our stewards, receivers, &c.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: In the first paragraph of this letter the sum was given as\r\n£104,000. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI could wish, that a paper of this nature might be drawn up, and signed\r\nby two or three hundred principal gentlemen of this kingdom, and printed\r\ncopies thereof sent to their several tenants; I am deceived, if anything\r\ncould sooner defeat this execrable design of Wood and his accomplices.\r\nThis would immediately give the alarm, and set the kingdom on their\r\nguard. This would give courage to the meanest tenant and cottager. \"How\r\nlong, O Lord, righteous and true.\"\r\n\r\nI must tell you in particular, Mr. Harding, that you are much to blame.\r\nSeveral hundred persons have enquired at your house for my \"Letter to\r\nthe Shopkeepers, &c.\" and you had none to sell them. Pray keep yourself\r\nprovided with that letter, and with this; you have got very well by the\r\nformer, but I did not then write for your sake, any more than I do now.\r\nPray advertise both in every newspaper, and let it not be _your_ fault\r\nor _mine_, if our countrymen will not take warning. I desire you\r\nlikewise to sell them as cheap as you can.\r\n\r\n_I am your servant_,\r\n\r\nM.B.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 4, 1724.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Report of the Committee of the Lords of His\r\nMajesty's most honourable Privy-Council, in\r\nrelation to Mr. Wood's Halfpence\r\nand Farthings, etc._[1]\r\n\r\nAT THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AT WHITEHALL, THE 24TH DAY\r\nOF JULY, 1724.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obedience to your Majesty's order of reference, upon the several\r\nresolutions and addresses of both Houses of Parliament of Ireland,\r\nduring their late session, the late address of your Majesty's justices,\r\nand Privy-council of that kingdom, and the petitions of the county and\r\ncity of Dublin, concerning a patent granted by your Majesty to William\r\nWood Esq; for the coining and uttering copper halfpence and farthings in\r\nthe kingdom of Ireland, to such persons as would voluntarily accept the\r\nsame; and upon the petition of the said William Wood, concerning the\r\nsame coinage, the Lords of the Committee have taken into their\r\nconsideration the said patent, addresses, petitions, and all matters and\r\npapers relating thereto, and have heard and examined all such persons,\r\nas upon due and sufficient notice, were desirous and willing to be heard\r\nupon the subject matter under their consideration, and have agreed upon\r\nthe following Report, containing a true state of the whole matter, as it\r\nappeared before them, with their humble opinion, to be laid before your\r\nMajesty for your royal consideration and determination, upon a matter of\r\nsuch importance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the story of the origin of this report see the Note\r\nprefixed to Letter III. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe several addresses to your Majesty from your subjects of Ireland,\r\ncontain in general terms the strongest representations of the great\r\napprehensions they were under, from the importing and uttering copper\r\nhalfpence and farthings in Ireland, by virtue of the patent granted to\r\nMr. Wood, which they conceived would prove highly prejudicial to your\r\nMajesty's revenue, destructive of the trade and commerce of the kingdom,\r\nand of dangerous consequence to the properties of the subject. They\r\nrepresent, That the patent had been obtained in a clandestine and\r\nunprecedented manner, and by notorious misrepresentations of the state\r\nof Ireland; That if the terms of the patent had been complied with, this\r\ncoinage would have been of infinite loss to the kingdom, but that the\r\npatentee, under colour of the powers granted to him, had imported and\r\nendeavoured to utter great quantities of different impressions, and of\r\nless weight, than required by the patent, and had been guilty of\r\nnotorious frauds and deceit in coining the said copper money: And they\r\nhumbly beseech your Majesty, that you would give such directions, as in\r\nyour great wisdom you should think proper, to prevent the fatal effects\r\nof uttering any half pence or farthings by virtue of the said patent:\r\nAnd the House of Commons of Ireland, in a second address upon this\r\nsubject, pray, That your Majesty would be pleased to give directions to\r\nthe several officers intrusted in the receipt of your Majesty's revenue,\r\nThat they do not on any pretence whatever, receive or utter any of the\r\nsaid copper halfpence or farthings.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the addresses of the Houses of Parliament of Ireland, your\r\nMajesty was most graciously pleased to assure them, \"That if any abuses\r\nhad been committed by the patentee, you would give the necessary orders\r\nfor enquiring into and punishing those abuses; and that your Majesty\r\nwould do everything, that was in your power, for the satisfaction of\r\nyour people.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this your Majesty's most gracious declaration, your\r\nMajesty was pleased to take this matter into you royal consideration;\r\nand that you might be the better enabled effectually to answer the\r\nexpectations of your people of Ireland, your Majesty was pleased by a\r\nletter from Lord Carteret, one of your principal secretaries of state,\r\ndated March 10, 1723-4, to signify your pleasure to your Lord Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland, \"That he should give directions for sending over such papers\r\nand witnesses as should be thought proper to support the objections made\r\nagainst the patent, and against the patentee, in the execution of the\r\npowers given him by the patent.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of these your Majesty's orders, the Lord Lieutenant, by\r\nhis letter of the 20th of March, 1723-4, represented the great\r\ndifficulty he found himself under, to comply with these your Majesty's\r\norders; and by another letter of the 24th of March 1723-4, \"after\r\nconsulting the principal members of both Houses, who were immediately in\r\nyour Majesty's service, and of the Privy Council,\" acquainted your\r\nMajesty, \"That none of them would take upon them to advise, how any\r\nmaterial persons or papers might be sent over on this occasion; but they\r\nall seemed apprehensive of the ill temper any miscarriage, in a trial,\r\nupon _scire facias_ brought against the patentee, might occasion in both\r\nHouses, if the evidence were not laid as full before a jury, as it was\r\nbefore them,\" and did therefore, a second time, decline sending over\r\nany persons, papers or materials whatsoever, to support this charge\r\nbrought against your Majesty's patent and the patentee.\r\n\r\nAs this proceeding seemed very extraordinary, that in a matter that had\r\nraised so great and universal a clamour in Ireland, no one person could\r\nbe prevailed upon to come over from Ireland, in support of the united\r\nsense of both Houses of Parliament of Ireland; That no papers, no\r\nmaterials, no evidence whatsoever of the mischiefs arising from this\r\npatent, or of the notorious frauds and deceit committed in the execution\r\nof it, could now be had, to give your Majesty satisfaction herein; \"your\r\nMajesty however, desirous to give your people of Ireland all possible\r\nsatisfaction, but sensible that you cannot in any case proceed against\r\nany of the meanest of your subjects, but according to the known rules\r\nand maxims of law and justice,\" repeated your orders to your Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland, that by persuasion, and making proper allowances\r\nfor their expenses, new endeavours might be used to procure and send\r\nover such witnesses as should be thought material to make good the\r\ncharge against the patent.\r\n\r\nIn answer to these orders, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland acquaints your\r\nMajesty, by his letter of the 23d of April to one of your principal\r\nsecretaries of state, \"That in order to obey your Majesty's commands as\r\nfar as possibly he could, at a meeting with my Lord Chancellor, the\r\nChief Judges, your Majesty's Attorney and Solicitor-General, he had\r\nearnestly desired their advice and assistance, to enable him to send\r\nover such witnesses as might be necessary to support the charge against\r\nMr. Wood's patent, and the execution of it. The result of this meeting\r\nwas such, that the Lord Lieutenant could not reap the least advantage or\r\nassistance from it, every one being so guarded with caution, against\r\ngiving any advice or opinion in this matter of state, apprehending great\r\ndanger to themselves from meddling in it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lords of the Committee think it very strange, that there should be\r\nsuch great difficulty in prevailing with persons, who had already given\r\ntheir evidence before the Parliament of Ireland, to come over and give\r\nthe same evidence here, and especially, that the chief difficulty should\r\narise, from a general apprehension of a miscarriage, in an enquiry\r\nbefore your Majesty, or in a proceeding by due course of law, in a case,\r\nwhere both Houses of Parliament had declared themselves so fully\r\nconvinced, and satisfied upon evidence, and examinations taken in the\r\nmost solemn manner.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that your Majesty sent your orders to the Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland, to send over such evidences as were thought\r\nmaterial to support the charge against the patent, that your Majesty\r\nmight, without any further loss of time than was absolutely necessary,\r\nbe as fully informed as was possible, and that the abuses and frauds\r\nalleged to be committed by the patentee, in executing the powers granted\r\nto him, might be fully and strictly enquired into, and examined, your\r\nMajesty was pleased to order that an assay should be made of the\r\nfineness, value, and weight of this copper money, and the goodness\r\nthereof, compared with the former coinages of copper money for Ireland,\r\nand the copper money coined in your Majesty's Mint in England; and it\r\nwas accordingly referred to Sir Isaac Newton, Edward Southwell, and\r\nThomas Scroope, Esqs. to make the said assay and trial.\r\n\r\nBy the reports made of this assay, which are hereunto annexed, it\r\nappears,[2] \"That the pix of the copper moneys coined at Bristol by Mr.\r\nWood for Ireland, containing the trial pieces, which was sealed and\r\nlocked up at the time of coining, was opened at your Majesty's mint at\r\nthe Tower; that the comptroller's account of the quantities of halfpence\r\nand farthings coined, agreed with Mr. Wood's account, amounting to 59\r\ntons, 3 hundred, 1 quarter, 11 pounds, and 4 ounces; That by the\r\nspecimens of this coinage, which had from time to time been taken from\r\nthe several parcels coined, and sealed up in papers, and put into the\r\npix, 60 halfpence weighed 14 ounces troy, and 18 penny-weight, which is\r\nabout a quarter of an ounce above one pound weight avoirdupois; and 30\r\nfarthings weighed 3 ounces and 3 quarters of an ounce troy, and 46\r\ngrams, which is also above the weight required by the patent. It also\r\nappears, that both halfpence and farthings when heated red-hot spread\r\nthin under the hammer without cracking; that the copper of which Mr.\r\nWood's coinage is made, is of the same goodness and value with the\r\ncopper of which the copper money is coined in your Majesty's mint for\r\nEngland, and worth in the market about 13 pence per pound weight\r\navoirdupois; That a pound of copper wrought into bars of fillets, and\r\nmade fit for coinage, before brought into the mint at the Tower of\r\nLondon, is worth 18 pence per pound, and always cost as much, and is\r\ncoined into 23 pence of copper money by tale, for England; It likewise\r\nappears, that the halfpence and farthings coined by Mr. Wood, when\r\ncompared with the copper money coined for Ireland, in the reigns of King\r\nCharles II. King James II. and King William and Queen Mary, considerably\r\nexceeds them all in weight, very far exceeds them all in goodness,\r\nfineness, and value of the copper, none of them bearing the fire so\r\nwell, not being malleable, wasting very much in the fire, and great part\r\nof them burning into a cinder of little or no value at all; Specimens\r\nof all which, as likewise of Mr. Wood's copper money, upon trials and\r\nassays made by Sir Isaac Newton, Mr. Southwell, and Mr. Scroope, were\r\nlaid before this Committee for their information.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Appendix, No. II. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Lords of the Committee beg leave upon this article of the complaint,\r\n\"That notorious frauds and deceits had been committed by the patentee,\r\nin executing the powers granted him,\" to observe to your Majesty, That\r\nthis is a fact expressly charged upon the patentee, and if it had in any\r\nmanner been proved, it might have enabled your Majesty, by due course of\r\nlaw, to have given the satisfaction to your people of Ireland, that has\r\nbeen so much insisted upon; but as it is now above four months since\r\nyour Majesty was pleased to send over to Ireland for such evidence, as\r\nmight prove a fact alleged to be so notorious, and no evidence at all\r\nhas been as yet transmitted, nor the least expectation given of any that\r\nmay hereafter be obtained, and the trials and assays that have been\r\ntaken of the halfpence, and farthings coined by Mr. Wood proving so\r\nunquestionably the weight, goodness and fineness of the copper money\r\ncoined, rather exceeding the conditions of the patent, than being any\r\nway defective, the Lords of the Committee cannot advise your Majesty, by\r\na writ of _scire facias_, or any other manner to endeavour vacating the\r\nsaid patent, when there is no probability of success in such an\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nAs these trials and assays fully shew that the patentee hath acted\r\nfairly according to the terms and conditions of his patent, so they\r\nevidently prove, that the care and caution made use of in this patent,\r\nby proper conditions, checks, and comptrols have effectually provided,\r\nthat the copper money coined for Ireland by virtue of this patent,\r\nshould far exceed the like coinages for Ireland, in the reigns of your\r\nMajesty's royal predecessors.\r\n\r\nAnd that your Majesty's royal predecessors have exercised this undoubted\r\nprerogative of granting to private persons the power and privilege of\r\ncoining copper halfpence and farthings for the kingdom of Ireland, was\r\nproved to this Committee by several precedents of such patents granted\r\nto private persons by King Charles II. and King James II. none of which\r\nwere equally beneficial to your kingdom of Ireland, nor so well guarded\r\nwith proper covenants and conditions for the due execution of the powers\r\nthereby granted, although the power and validity of those patents, and a\r\ndue compliance with them, was never in any one instance, till this time,\r\ndisputed or controverted.\r\n\r\nBy these former patents, the sole power of coining copper money for\r\nIreland, was granted to the patentees for the term of 21 years, to be\r\ncoined in such place as they should think convenient, and \"such\r\nquantities as they could conveniently issue within the term of 21\r\nyears,\" without any restriction of the quantity to be coined within the\r\nwhole term, or any provision of a certain quantity, only to be coined\r\nannually to prevent the ill consequences of too great a quantity to be\r\npoured in at once, at the will and pleasure of the patentees; no\r\nprovision was made for the goodness and fineness of the copper, no\r\ncomptroller appointed to inspect the copper in bars and fillets, before\r\ncoined, and take constant assays of the money when coined, and the power\r\nof issuing not limited \"to such as would voluntarily accept the same\";\r\nbut by the patent granted to John Knox, the money coined by virtue of\r\nthe patent, \"is made and declared to be the current coin of the kingdom\r\nof Ireland,\" and a pound weight of copper was allowed to be coined into\r\n2 shillings and 8 pence, and whatever quantity should be coined, a rent\r\nof 16_l_ _per annum_ only was reserved to the crown, and 700 tons of\r\ncopper were computed to be coined within the 21 years, without any\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nThe term granted to Mr. Wood for coining copper money is for 14 years\r\nonly, the quantity for the whole term limited to 360 tons, 100 ton only\r\nto be issued within one year, and 20 tons each year for the 13 remaining\r\nyears; a comptroller is appointed by the authority of the crown to\r\ninspect, comptrol, and assay the copper, as well not coined as coined;\r\nthe copper to be fine British copper, cast into bars or fillets, which\r\nwhen heated red hot would spread thin under the hammer; a pound weight\r\nof copper to be coined into 2 shillings and sixpence, and without any\r\ncompulsion on currency enforced, to be received by such only as would\r\nvoluntarily and wilfully accept the same\"; a rent of 800_l_ _per annum_\r\nis reserved unto your Majesty,[3] and 200_l per annum_ to your Majesty's\r\nclerk comptroller, to be paid annually by the patentee, for the full\r\nterm of the fourteen years, which for 13 years when 20 tons of copper\r\nonly are coined, is not inconsiderable; these great and essential\r\ndifferences in the several patents, that have been granted for coining\r\ncopper money for the kingdom of Ireland, seemed sufficiently to justify\r\nthe care and caution that was used in granting the letters-patent to Mr.\r\nWood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See the extract from the patent itself, where the amount is\r\ngiven differently [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nIt has been further represented to your Majesty, That these\r\nletters-patent were obtained by Mr. Wood in a clandestine and\r\nunprecedent manner, and by gross misrepresentations of the state of the\r\nkingdom of Ireland. Upon enquiring into this fact it appears, That the\r\npetition of Mr. Wood for obtaining this coinage, was presented to your\r\nMajesty at the time that several other petitions and applications were\r\nmade to your Majesty, for the same purpose, by sundry persons, well\r\nacquainted and conversant with the affairs of Ireland, setting forth the\r\ngreat want of small money and change in all the common and lower parts\r\nof traffic, and business throughout the kingdom, and the terms of Mr.\r\nWood's petition seeming to your Majesty most reasonable, thereupon a\r\ndraught of a warrant directing a grant of such coinage to be made to Mr.\r\nWood, was referred to your Majesty's then Attorney and Solicitor-general\r\nof England, to consider and report their opinion to your Majesty; Sir\r\nIsaac Newton, as the Committee is informed was consulted in all the\r\nsteps of settling and adjusting the terms and conditions of the patent;\r\nand after mature deliberation, your Majesty's warrant was signed,\r\ndirecting an indenture in such manner as is practised in your Majesty's\r\nmint in the Tower of London, for the coining of gold and silver moneys,\r\nto pass the Great Seal of Great Britain, which was carried through all\r\nthe usual forms and offices without haste or precipitation, That the\r\nCommittee cannot discover the least pretence to say, this patent was\r\npassed or obtained in a clandestine or unprecedented manner, unless it\r\nis to be understood, that your Majesty's granting a liberty of coining\r\ncopper money for Ireland, under the Great Seal of Great Britain, without\r\nreferring the consideration thereof to the principal officers of\r\nIreland, is the grievance and mischief complained of. Upon this head it\r\nmust be admitted, that letters-patent under the Great Seal of Great\r\nBritain for coining copper money for Ireland, are legal and obligatory,\r\na just and reasonable exercise of your Majesty's royal prerogative, and\r\nin no manner derogatory, or invasive, of any liberties or privileges of\r\nyour subjects of Ireland. When any matter or thing is transacting that\r\nconcerns or may affect your kingdom of Ireland, if your Majesty has any\r\ndoubts concerning the same, or sees just cause for considering your\r\nofficers of Ireland, your Majesty is frequently pleased to refer such\r\nconsiderations to your chief governors of Ireland, but the Lords of the\r\nCommittee hope it will not be asserted, that any legal orders or\r\nresolutions of your Majesty can or ought to be called in question or\r\ninvalidated, because the advice or consent of your chief governors of\r\nthat kingdom was not previously had upon them: The precedents are many,\r\nwherein cases of great importance to Ireland, and that immediately\r\naffected, the interests of that kingdom, warrants, orders, and\r\ndirections, by the authority of your Majesty and your royal\r\npredecessors, have been issued under the royal sign manual, without any\r\nprevious reference, or advice of your officers of Ireland, which have\r\nalways had their due force, and have been punctually complied with and\r\nobeyed. And as it cannot be disputed but this patent might legally and\r\nproperly pass under the Great Seal of Great Britain, so their Lordships\r\ncannot find any precedents of references to the officers of Ireland, of\r\nwhat passed under the Great Seal of England; on the contrary, there are\r\nprecedents of patents passed under the Great Seal of Ireland, where in\r\nall the previous steps the references were made to the officers of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBy the misrepresentation of the state of Ireland, in order to obtain\r\nthis patent, it is presumed, is meant, That the information given to\r\nyour Majesty of the great want of small money, to make small payments,\r\nwas groundless, and that there is no such want of small money: The Lords\r\nof the Committee enquired very particularly into this article, and Mr.\r\nWood produced several witnesses, that directly asserted the great want\r\nof small money for change, and the great damage that retailers and\r\nmanufactures suffered for want of such copper money. Evidence was given,\r\nThat considerable manufacturers have been obliged to give tallies, or\r\ntokens in cards, to their workmen for want of small money, signed upon\r\nthe back, to be afterwards exchanged for larger money: That a premium\r\nwas often given to obtain small money for necessary occasions: Several\r\nletters from Ireland to correspondents in England were read, complaining\r\nof the want of copper money, and expressing the great demand there was\r\nfor this money.\r\n\r\nThe great want of small money was further proved by the common use of\r\n_raps_, a counterfeit coin, of such base metal, that what passes for a\r\nhalfpenny, is not worth half a farthing, which raps appear to have\r\nobtained a currency, out of necessity and for want of better small money\r\nto make change with, and by the best accounts, the Lords of the\r\nCommittee have reason to believe, That there can be no doubt, that there\r\nis a real want of small money in Ireland, which seems to be so far\r\nadmitted on all hands, that there does not appear to have been any\r\nmisrepresentation of the state of Ireland in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn the second address from the House of Commons to your Majesty, They\r\nmost humbly beseech your Majesty, that you will be graciously pleased to\r\ngive directions to the several officers intrusted with the receipt of\r\nyour Majesty's revenue, that they do not, on any pretence whatsoever,\r\nreceive or utter such halfpence or farthings, and Mr. Wood, in his\r\npetition to your Majesty, complains, that the officers of your Majesty's\r\nrevenue had already given such orders to all the inferior officers not\r\nto receive any of this coin.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty, by your patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain,\r\nwills, requires and commands your \"lieutenant, deputy, or other chief\r\ngovernor or governors of your kingdom of Ireland, and all other officers\r\nand ministers of your Majesty, your heirs and successors in England,\r\nIreland or elsewhere, to be aiding and assisting to the said William\r\nWood, his executors, &c. in the execution of all or any the powers,\r\nauthorities, directions, matters or things to be executed by him or\r\nthem, or for his or their benefit and advantage, by virtue, and in\r\npursuance of the said indentures, in all things as becometh, &c.\" And if\r\nthe officers of the revenue have, upon their own authority, given any\r\norders, directions, significations, or intimations, to hinder or\r\nobstruct the receiving and uttering the copper money coined and\r\nimported, pursuant to your Majesty's letters-patent, this cannot but be\r\nlooked upon as a very extraordinary proceeding.\r\n\r\nIn another paragraph of the patent your Majesty has covenanted and\r\ngranted unto the said William Wood, his executors, &c. \"That upon\r\nperformance of covenants, on his and their parts, he and they shall\r\npeaceably, and quietly, have, hold, and enjoy all the powers,\r\nauthorities, privileges, licences, profits, advantages, and all other\r\nmatters and things thereby granted, without any let, suit, trouble,\r\nmolestation or denial of your Majesty, your heirs or successors, or of\r\nor by any of your or their officers or ministers, or any person or\r\npersons, &c.\" This being so expressly granted and covenanted by your\r\nMajesty, and there appearing no failure, non-performance, or breach of\r\ncovenants, on the part of the patentee, the Lords of the Committee\r\ncannot advise your Majesty to give directions to the officers of the\r\nrevenue, not to receive or utter any of the said copper halfpence or\r\nfarthings as has been desired.\r\n\r\nMr. Wood having been heard by his counsel, produced his several\r\nwitnesses, all the papers and precedents, which he thought material,\r\nhaving been read and considered, and having as he conceived, fully\r\nvindicated both the patent, and the execution thereof. For his further\r\njustification, and to clear himself from the imputation of attempting to\r\nmake to himself any unreasonable profit or advantage, and to enrich\r\nhimself at the expense of the kingdom of Ireland, by endeavouring to\r\nimpose upon them, and utter a greater quantity of copper money, than the\r\nnecessary occasions of the people shall require, and can easily take\r\noff, delivered a proposal in writing, signed by himself, which is\r\nhereunto annexed, and Mr. Wood having by the said letters-patent,\r\n\"covenanted, granted, and promised to, and with your Majesty, your heirs\r\nand successors, that he shall and will from time to time in the making\r\nthe said copper farthings and halfpence in England, and in transporting\r\nthe same from time to time to Ireland, and in uttering, vending,\r\ndisposing and dispersing the same there, and in all his doings and\r\naccounts concerning the same, submit himself to the inspection,\r\nexamination, order and comptrol of your Majesty and your commissioners\r\nof the treasury or high-treasurer for the time being;\" the Lords of the\r\nCommittee are of opinion, that your Majesty upon this voluntary offer\r\nand proposal of Mr. Wood, may give proper orders and directions for the\r\nexecution and due performance of such parts of the said proposal, as\r\nshall be judged most for the interest and accommodation of your subjects\r\nof Ireland: In the mean time, it not appearing to their Lordships that\r\nMr. Wood has done or committed any act or deed, that may tend to\r\ninvalidate, or make void his letters-patent, or to forfeit the\r\nprivileges and advantages thereby granted to him by your Majesty; It is\r\nbut just and reasonable, that your Majesty should immediately send\r\norders to your commissioners of the revenue, and all other your officers\r\nin Ireland, to revoke all orders, directions, significations, or\r\nintimations whatsoever, that may have been given by them, or any of\r\nthem, to hinder or obstruct the receiving and uttering this copper\r\nmoney, and that the halfpence and farthings already coined by Mr. Wood,\r\namounting to about 17,000_l_. and such further quantity as shall make up\r\nthe said 17,000_l_. to 40,000_l_. \"be suffered and permitted without any\r\nlet, suit, trouble, molestation, or denial of any of your Majesty's\r\nofficers or ministers whatsoever, to pass, and be received as current\r\nmoney by such as shall be willing to receive the same.\" At the same\r\ntime, it may be advisable for your Majesty, to give the proper orders,\r\nthat Mr. Wood shall not coin, import into Ireland, utter or dispose of\r\nany more copper halfpence or farthings, than to the amount of 40,000_l_.\r\naccording to his own proposal, without your Majesty's special licence or\r\nauthority, to be had for that purpose; and if your Majesty shall be\r\npleased to order, that Mr. Wood's proposal, delivered to the Lords of\r\nthe Committee, shall be transmitted to your Majesty's chief governor,\r\ndeputies, or other your ministers, or officers in Ireland, it will give\r\nthem a proper opportunity to consider, Whether, after the reduction of\r\n360 tons of copper, being in value 100,800_l_. to 142 tons, 17 hundred,\r\n16 pounds being in value 40,000_l_. only, anything can be done for the\r\nfurther satisfaction of the people of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\nTO THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe Drapier's second letter was dated August 4th, 1724. A few days\r\nlater the English Privy Council's Report, dated 24th July, 1724, arrived\r\nin Dublin, and on August 25th, Swift had issued his reply to it in this\r\nthird letter.\r\n\r\nThe Report itself, which is here prefixed to the third letter, was said\r\nto have been the work of Walpole. Undoubtedly, it contains the best\r\narguments that could then be urged in favour of Wood and the patent, and\r\nundoubtedly, also, it would have had the desired effect had it been\r\nallowed to do its work uncriticised. But Swift's opposition was fatal to\r\nWalpole's intentions. He took the report as but another attempt to foist\r\non the people of Ireland a decree in which they had not been consulted,\r\nand no amount of yielding, short of complete abandonment of it, would\r\npalliate the thing that was hateful in itself. He resented the insult.\r\nAfter specific rebuttals of the various arguments urged in the report in\r\nfavour of the patent, Swift suddenly turns from the comparatively petty\r\nand insignificant consideration as to the weight and quality of the\r\ncoins, and deals with the broad principle of justice which the granting\r\nof the patent had ignored. Had the English Houses of Parliament and the\r\nEnglish Privy Council, he said, addressed the King against a similar\r\nbreach of the English people's rights, his Majesty would not have waited\r\nto discuss the matter, nor would his ministers have dared to advise him\r\nas they had done in this instance. \"Am I a free man in England,\" he\r\nexclaims, \"and do I become a slave in six hours in crossing the\r\nchannel?\"\r\n\r\nThe report, however, is interesting inasmuch as it assists us to\r\nappreciate the pathetic condition of Irish affairs at the time. The very\r\nfact that the petition of the Irish parliament could be so handled,\r\nproves how strong had been the hold over Ireland by England, and with\r\nwhat daring insistence the English ministers continued to efface the\r\nlast strongholds of Irish independence.\r\n\r\nMonck Mason, in reviewing the report, has devoted a very elaborate note\r\nto its details, and has fortified his criticisms with a series of\r\nremarkable letters from the Archbishop of Dublin, which he publishes for\r\nthe first time.[1] I have embodied much of this note in the annotations\r\nwhich accompany the present reprint of this letter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" pp. lxxxvi-xcv.]\r\n\r\nThe text of this third letter is based on Sir W.

A printed paper was sent to me on the 18th\r\ninstant, entitled, \"A Report of the Committee of the Lords of His\r\nMajesty's Most Honourable Privy-Council in England, relating to Mr.\r\nWood's Halfpence and Farthings.\"[2] There is no mention made where the\r\npaper was printed, but I suppose it to have been in Dublin; and I have\r\nbeen told that the copy did not come over in the Gazette, but in the\r\nLondon Journal, or some other print of no authority or consequence; and\r\nfor anything that legally appears to the contrary, it may be a\r\ncontrivance to fright us, or a project of some printer, who hath a mind\r\nto make a penny by publishing something upon a subject, which now\r\nemploys all our thoughts in this kingdom. Mr. Wood in publishing this\r\npaper would insinuate to the world, as if the Committee had a greater\r\nconcern for his credit and private emolument, than for the honour of the\r\nPrivy-council and both Houses of Parliament here, and for the quiet and\r\nwelfare of this whole kingdom; For it seems intended as a vindication of\r\nMr. Wood, not without several severe remarks on the Houses of Lords and\r\nCommons of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The full text of this report is prefixed to this third\r\nletter of the Drapier. The report was published in the \"London Journal\"\r\nabout the middle of August of 1724. Neither the \"Gazette\" nor any other\r\nministerial organ printed it, which evidently gave Swift his cue to\r\nattack it in the merciless manner he did. Monck Mason thought it \"not\r\nimprobable that the minister [Walpole] adopted this method of\r\ncommunication, because it served his own purpose; he dared not to stake\r\nhis credit upon such a document, which, in its published form, contains\r\nsome gross mis-statements\" (\"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" note,\r\non p. 336). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe whole is indeed written with the turn and air of a pamphlet, as if\r\nit were a dispute between William Wood on the one part, and the Lords\r\nJustices, Privy-council and both Houses of Parliament on the other; the\r\ndesign of it being to clear and vindicate the injured reputation of\r\nWilliam Wood, and to charge the other side with casting rash and\r\ngroundless aspersions upon him.\r\n\r\nBut if it be really what the title imports, Mr. Wood hath treated the\r\nCommittee with great rudeness, by publishing an act of theirs in so\r\nunbecoming a manner, without their leave, and before it was communicated\r\nto the government and Privy-council of Ireland, to whom the Committee\r\nadvised that it should be transmitted. But with all deference be it\r\nspoken, I do not conceive that a Report of a Committee of the Council in\r\nEngland is hitherto a law in either kingdom; and until any point is\r\ndetermined to be a law, it remains disputable by every subject.\r\n\r\nThis (may it please your lordships and worships) may seem a strange way\r\nof discoursing in an illiterate shopkeeper. I have endeavoured (although\r\nwithout the help of books) to improve that small portion of reason which\r\nGod hath pleased to give me, and when reason plainly appears before me,\r\nI cannot turn away my head from it. Thus for instance, if any lawyer\r\nshould tell me that such a point were law, from which many gross\r\npalpable absurdities must follow, I would not, I could not believe him.\r\nIf Sir Edward Coke should positively assert (which he nowhere does, but\r\nthe direct contrary) that a limited prince, could by his prerogative\r\noblige his subjects to take half an ounce of lead, stamped with his\r\nimage, for twenty shillings in gold, I should swear he was deceived or a\r\ndeceiver, because a power like that, would leave the whole lives and\r\nfortunes of the people entirely at the mercy of the monarch: Yet this,\r\nin effect, is what Wood hath advanced in some of his papers, and what\r\nsuspicious people may possibly apprehend from some passages in that\r\nwhich is called the \"Report.\"\r\n\r\nThat paper mentions \"such persons to have been examined, who were\r\ndesirous and willing to be heard upon that subject.\" I am told, they\r\nwere four in all, Coleby, Brown, Mr. Finley the banker, and one more\r\nwhose name I know not. The first of these was tried for robbing the\r\nTreasury in Ireland, and although he was acquitted for want of legal\r\nproof, yet every person in the Court believed him to be guilty. The\r\nsecond was tried for a rape, and stands recorded in the votes of the\r\nHouse of Commons, for endeavouring by perjury and subornation, to take\r\naway the life of John Bingham, Esq.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Referring to these persons who were examined by the\r\nCommittee, Monck Mason quotes from two letters from Archbishop King to\r\nEdward Southwell, Esq. King was one of the council, and Southwell\r\nsecretary of state at the time. The first of these letters remarks:\r\n\"Could a greater contempt be put upon a nation, than to see such a\r\nlittle fellow as Wood favoured and supported against them, and such\r\nprofligates as Brown and Coleby believed before a whole parliament,\r\ngovernment, and private council.\" From the second letter, written on\r\nAugust 15th, 1724, Monck Mason gives the following extracts:\r\n\r\n\"--When I returned to Dublin I met with resolutions concerning our\r\nhalfpence, founded chiefly on the testimony of two infamous persons,\r\nJohn Brown and Coleby: as to the first of these, you will find his\r\ncharacter in the votes of the house of commons, last parliament.\r\nTuesday, the 5th of November.\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, that it appears to this Committee, that a wicked conspiracy\r\nwas maliciously contrived and carried on against John Bingham, to take\r\naway his life and fortune.\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, that it is the opinion of this Committee, that the said John\r\nBrown, of Rabens, Esq. and his accomplices, were the chief promoters and\r\nadvisers of the said conspiracy.\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, that it is the opinion of this Committee, that the said John\r\nBrown is a person not fit to serve his majesty, in any office or\r\nemployment, civil or military, whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, that the said John Brown has, in the course of his\r\nexamination, grossly prevaricated with this Committee.\r\n\r\n\"'To all which resolutions, the question being severally put, the house\r\ndid agree, _nemine contradicente_.\r\n\r\n\"'Ordered, that the said John Brown be, for his said prevarication,\r\ntaken into the custody of the serjeant at arms attending this house.\r\n\r\n\"'Ordered, that his majesty's attorney-general do present the said John\r\nBrown, for conniving and maliciously carrying on the said conspiracy to\r\ntake away the life of the said John Bingham, and others.'\r\n\r\n\"As to Coleby, he was turned out of the treasury for robbing it of a\r\nconsiderable sum of money. I was present at his trial at the\r\nKing's-bench, and the evidence was such as convinced every one, in his\r\nconscience, that he was guilty; but, the proofs being presumptive, and\r\nnot direct, the jury acquitted him; on which the judge (Pine, if I\r\nremember right) observed the happiness of English subjects, that, though\r\neverybody was convinced of a man's guilt, yet, if the evidence did not\r\ncome up to the strict requisites of the law, he would escape\" (\"History\r\nof St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" pp. xciv-xcv.) [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut since I have gone so far as to mention particular persons, it may be\r\nsome satisfaction to know who is this Wood himself, that has the honour\r\nto have a whole kingdom at his mercy, for almost two years together. I\r\nfind he is in the patent entitled _Esq_; although he were understood to\r\nbe only a hardware-man, and so I have been bold to call him in my former\r\nletters; however a '_squire_ he is, not only by virtue of his patent,\r\nbut by having been a collector in Shropshire, where pretending to have\r\nbeen robbed, and suing the county, he was cast, and for the infamy of\r\nthe fact, lost his employment.\r\n\r\nI have heard another story of this 'Squire Wood from a very honourable\r\nlady, that one Hamilton told her. He (Hamilton) was sent for six years\r\nago by Sir Isaac Newton to try the coinage of four men, who then\r\nsolicited a patent for coining halfpence for Ireland; their names were\r\nWood, Coster, Elliston, and Parker. Parker made the fairest offer, and\r\nWood the worst, for his coin were three halfpence in a pound less value\r\nthan the other. By which it is plain with what intentions he solicited\r\nthis patent, but not so plain how he obtained it.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged in the said paper, called the \"Report,\" that upon repeated\r\norders from a secretary of state, for sending over such papers and\r\nwitnesses, as should be thought proper to support the objections made\r\nagainst the patent (by both Houses of Parliament) the Lord Lieutenant\r\nrepresented \"the great difficulty he found himself in to comply with\r\nthese orders. That none of the principal members of both Houses, who\r\nwere in the King's service or council, would take upon them to advise\r\nhow any material person or papers might be sent over on this occasion,\r\n&c.\" And this is often repeated and represented as \"a proceeding that\r\nseems very extraordinary, and that in a matter which had raised so great\r\na clamour in Ireland, no one person could be prevailed upon to come over\r\nfrom Ireland in support of the united sense of both Houses of Parliament\r\nin Ireland, especially that the chief difficulty should arise from a\r\ngeneral apprehension of a miscarriage, in an enquiry before His\r\nMajesty, or in a proceeding by due course of law, in a case where both\r\nHouses of Parliament had declared themselves so fully convinced, and\r\nsatisfied upon evidence, and examinations taken in the most solemn\r\nmanner.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Commenting on this Monck Mason has the following note. This\r\nlearned biographer's remarks are specially important inasmuch as he has\r\nfortified them with letters from Archbishop King, unpublished at the\r\ntime he wrote: \"But this [referring to the extract from the Report given\r\nby Swift] will not appear so strange or inexplicable after perusing the\r\nfollowing letter from Archbishop King ... to Edward Southwell, Esq. ...;\r\nthis important state paper may, therefore, be considered as an official\r\ncommunication of the sentiments of the Irish Privy Council upon this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\"Letter from William King, Archbishop of Dublin, to Edward Southwell,\r\nEsq., dated the 23d March, 1723.\r\n\r\n\"'I have not had any occasion of late to trouble you with my letters;\r\nbut yesternight I came to the knowledge of an affair which gave me some\r\nuneasiness, and, I believe, will do so to the whole kingdom, when it\r\nbecomes public. My lord lieutenant sent for several lords and commoners\r\nof the privy council, and communicated to them a letter from my Lord\r\nCarteret, writ by his majesty's command, in which was repeated the\r\nanswer given to the addresses of the lords and commons, about one\r\nWilliam Wood's farthings and halfpence; and his grace is required to\r\nsend over witnesses and evidences against the patentee or patent: this\r\nhas surprised most people, because we were borne in hand that that\r\naffair was dead, and that we should never hear any more of it.\r\n\r\n\"'His grace's design was, to be advised by what means and methods he\r\nmight effectually comply with his majesty's commands; and, by what I\r\ncould perceive, it was the sense of all, that it was not possible, in\r\nthe present situation of affairs, to answer his majesty's expectations\r\nor those of the kingdom; and that, for these reasons:\r\n\r\n\"'1st, because this is a controversy between the parliament of Ireland\r\nand William Wood, and, the parliament being now prorogued, nobody either\r\nwould, or durst, take on them to meddle in a business attacked by the\r\nparliament, or pretend to manage a cause which so deeply concerned the\r\nparliament, and the whole nation, without express orders. If this letter\r\nhad come whilst the parliament was sitting, and had been communicated to\r\nthe houses, they could have appointed certain persons to have acted for\r\nthem, and raised a fund to support them, as has been done formerly in\r\nthis kingdom on several occasions; but, for any, without such authority,\r\nto make himself a party for the legislature and people of Ireland, would\r\nbe a bold undertaking, and, perhaps, dangerous; for, if such undertaker\r\nor undertakers should fail in producing all evidences that may be had,\r\nor any of the papers necessary to make the case evident, they must\r\nexpect to be severely handled the next parliament for their\r\nofficiousness, and bear the blame of the miscarriage of the cause: for\r\nthese reasons, as it seemed to me, the privy councillors were unwilling\r\nto engage at all in the business, or to meddle with it.\r\n\r\n\"'But, 2dly, the thing seemed impracticable; because it would signify\r\nnothing to send over the copies of the papers that were laid before the\r\nparliament, if the design is, as it seems to be, to bring the patent to\r\na legal trial; for such copies we were told by lawyers, could not be\r\nproduced in any court as evidence; and, as to the originals, they are in\r\nthe possession of the houses, and (as was conceived) could not be taken\r\nfrom the proper officers with whom they were trusted, but by the like\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"'And, as to the witnesses, it was a query whether my lord lieutenant by\r\nhis own power could send them; and, if he have such power, yet it will\r\nnot be possible to come at the witnesses, for several in each house\r\nvouched several facts on their own knowledge, to whom the houses gave\r\ncredit; my lord lieutenant can neither be apprised of the persons nor of\r\nthe particulars which the members testified; whereas, if the parliament\r\nwas sitting, those members would appear, and make good their assertions.\r\n\r\n\"'There were several sorts of farthings and halfpence produced to the\r\nhouses, differing in weight, and there was likewise a difference in the\r\nstamp. These were sent over by William Wood to his correspondents here,\r\nand by them produced. But can it be proved, on a legal trial, that these\r\nparticular halfpence were coined by him? It is easy for him to say, that\r\nthey are counterfeited, as (if I remember right) he has already affirmed\r\nin the public prints, in his answer to the address of the commons.\r\n\r\n\"'But, 3dly, it was not on the illegality of the patent, nor chiefly on\r\nthe abuse of it the patentee (which was not so much as mentioned by the\r\nlords), that the parliament insisted, but on the unavoidable mischief\r\nand destruction it would bring on the kingdom, and on its being obtained\r\nby most false and notorious misinformation of his majesty; it being\r\nsuggested, as appears by the preamble, that the kingdom wanted such\r\nhalfpence and farthings: now, if the king be misinformed, the lawyers\r\ntell us, that the grant is void. And, that his majesty was deceived in\r\nthis grant by a false representation, it was said, needed no further\r\nproof than the patent itself.--William Wood by it was empowered to coin\r\n360 tons of copper into halfpence and farthings, which would have made\r\n£90,000, about the fifth part of all the current cash of Ireland; for\r\nthat is not reckoned, by those who suppose it most, to be £500,000. Now,\r\nthe current cash of England is reckoned above twenty millions; in\r\nproportion, therefore, if Ireland wants £90,000 England will want four\r\nmillions. It is easy to imagine what would be said to a man that would\r\npropose to his majesty such a coinage; and it is agreed, that the people\r\nof England would not be more alarmed by such a patent, than the people\r\nof Ireland are, by the prospect of turning the fifth part of their\r\ncurrent coin into brass.\r\n\r\n\"'This, so far as I can remember, is a brief of what passed in the\r\nmeeting before my lord lieutenant'\" (\"History of St. Patrick's\r\nCathedral,\" pp. lxxxvii-lxxxviii). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nHow shall I, a poor ignorant shopkeeper, utterly unskilled in law, be\r\nable to answer so weighty an objection. I will try what can be done by\r\nplain reason, unassisted by art, cunning or eloquence.\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, the committee of council, hath already prejudged\r\nthe whole case, by calling the united sense of both Houses of\r\nParliament in Ireland an \"universal clamour.\" Here the addresses of the\r\nLords and Commons of Ireland against a ruinous destructive project of an\r\n\"obscure, single undertaker,\" is called a \"clamour.\" I desire to know\r\nhow such a style would be resented in England from a committee of\r\ncouncil there to a Parliament, and how many impeachments would follow\r\nupon it. But supposing the appellation to be proper, I never heard of a\r\nwise minister who despised the universal clamour of a people, and if\r\nthat clamour can be quieted by disappointing the fraudulent practice of\r\na single person, the purchase is not exorbitant.\r\n\r\nBut in answer to this objection. First it is manifest, that if this\r\ncoinage had been in Ireland, with such limitations as have been formerly\r\nspecified in other patents, and granted to persons of this kingdom, or\r\neven of England, able to give sufficient security, few or no\r\ninconveniencies could have happened, which might not have been\r\nimmediately remedied. As to Mr. Knox's patent mentioned in the Report,\r\nsecurity was given into the exchequer, that the patentee should at any\r\ntime receive his halfpence back, and pay gold or silver in exchange for\r\nthem. And Mr. Moor (to whom I suppose that patent was made over) was in\r\n1694 forced to leave off coining, before the end of that year, by the\r\ngreat crowds of people continually offering to return his coinage upon\r\nhim. In 1698 he coined again, and was forced to give over for the same\r\nreason. This entirely alters the case; for there is no such condition in\r\nWood's patent, which condition was worth a hundred times all other\r\nlimitations whatsoever.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: It will serve to elucidate this paragraph if an account be\r\ngiven of the various coinage patents issued for Ireland. Monck Mason\r\ngives an account in a long note to his biography of Swift; but as he has\r\nobtained it from the very ably written tract, \"A Defence of the Conduct\r\nof the People of Ireland,\" etc., I have gone to that pamphlet for the\r\npresent _résumé_. I quote from pp. 21-24 of the Dublin edition, issued\r\nin 1724 and printed by George Ewing:\r\n\r\n\"K. Charles 2d. 1660 granted a patent for coining only farthings for the\r\nkingdom of Ireland to Coll. Armstrong: But I do not find he ever made\r\nany use of it.[A] For all our copper and brass money to the year 1680\r\nwas issued by private persons, who obtained particular licences, _on\r\ngiving security to change their half-pence and farthings for gold and\r\nsilver_; but some of their securities failing, others pretending the\r\nhalf-pence which were tendered to be changed were counterfeits, the\r\npublic always suffered. Col. Armstrong's son, finding great profit was\r\nmade by coining half-pence in Ireland, by virtue of particular licences\r\nrecallable at pleasure, solicited and obtained a patent in the name of\r\nGeorge Legg afterwards Lord Dartmouth, for coining half-pence for\r\nIreland from 1680, for 21 years, _he giving security to exchange them\r\nfor gold or silver on demand_.[B] In pursuance of this he coined\r\nconsiderable quantities of half-pence for four years; but in 1685 [John]\r\nKnox, with the consent of Armstrong, got the remaining part of this term\r\ngranted by patent in his own name, he giving security as above, and got\r\nhis half-pence declared the current coin of Ireland, notwithstanding two\r\nActs of Parliament had enacted that they should not be received in the\r\nrevenue. Knox was interrupted in his coinage in 1689, by King James's\r\ntaking it into his own hands, to coin his famous brass money, of which\r\nhe coined no less than £965,375, three penny worth of metal passing for\r\n£10 _ster_. In this money creditors were obliged to receive their debts,\r\nand by this cruel stratagem Ireland lost about £60,000 per month. This\r\nnot only made our gold and silver, but even our half-pence to disappear;\r\nwhich obliged King William to coin pewter half-pence for the use of his\r\narmy....\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Monck Mason, quoting Simon \"On Irish Coins\" (Append., No.\r\nLXV), says: \"Sir Thomas [Armstrong] was never admitted to make use of\r\nthis grant, nor could he obtain allowance of the chief governor of\r\nIreland, to issue them as royal coin among the subjects of that\r\nkingdom.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: \"A proclamation was issued by the lord lieutenant,\r\ndeclaring these half-pence to be the current coin of the kingdom, but it\r\nprovided that none should be enforced to take more than five shillings\r\nin the payment of one hundred pounds, and so proportionately in all\r\ngreater and lesser sums.... This patent was granted, by and with, the\r\nadvice of James, Duke of Ormond\" (Monck Mason, \"History of St.\r\nPatrick's,\" p. 334, note y).]\r\n\r\n\"After the Revolution, Col. Roger Moore being possessed of Knox's\r\npatent, commenced his coinage in Dublin, and at first kept several\r\noffices for changing his half-pence for gold or silver. He soon\r\noverstocked the kingdom so with copper money, that persons were obliged\r\nto receive large sums in it; for the officers of the crown were\r\nindustrious dispensers of it, for which he allowed them a premium. It\r\nwas common at that time for one to compound for 1/4 copper, and the\r\ncollectors paid nothing else. The country being thus overcharged with a\r\nbase coin, everyone tendered it to Col. Moore to be changed. This he\r\nrefused, on pretence they were counterfeits.... On this he quitted\r\ncoining in 1698, but left us in a miserable condition, which is lively\r\nrepresented in a Memorial presented by Will. Trench, Esq. to the Lords\r\nof the Treasury, on Mr. Wood's obtaining his patent, and which our\r\nCommissioners referred to.... Col. Moore finding the sweet of such a\r\npatent, applied to King William for a renewal of it; but his petition\r\nbeing referred to the government of Ireland, the affair was fairly\r\nrepresented to the king, whereby his designs were frustrated.\r\n\r\n\"In the reign of the late Queen, application was made by Robert Baird\r\nand William Harnill, Trustees for the garrison which defended\r\nLondonderry, for a patent to coin base money for Ireland ... their\r\npetition was rejected.... Since this time there have been many\r\napplications made for such patents.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nPut the case, that the two Houses of Lords and Commons of England, and\r\nthe Privy-council there should address His Majesty to recall a patent,\r\nfrom whence they apprehend the most ruinous consequences to the whole\r\nkingdom: And to make it stronger if possible, that the whole nation,\r\nalmost to a man, should thereupon discover the \"most dismal\r\napprehensions\" (as Mr. Wood styles them) would His Majesty debate half\r\nan hour what he had to do? Would any minister dare advise him against\r\nrecalling such a patent? Or would the matter be referred to the\r\nPrivy-Council or to Westminster-hall, the two Houses of Parliament\r\nplaintiffs, and William Wood defendant? And is there even the smallest\r\ndifference between the two cases?\r\n\r\nWere not the people of Ireland born as free as those of England? How\r\nhave they forfeited their freedom? Is not their Parliament as fair a\r\nrepresentative of the people as that of England? And hath not their\r\nPrivy-council as great or a greater share in the administration of\r\npublic affairs? Are they not subjects of the same King? Does not the\r\nsame sun shine on them? And have they not the same God for their\r\nprotector? Am I a freeman in England, and do I become a slave in six\r\nhours by crossing the Channel? No wonder then, if the boldest persons\r\nwere cautious to interpose in a matter already determined by the whole\r\nvoice of the nation, or to presume to represent the representatives of\r\nthe kingdom, and were justly apprehensive of meeting such a treatment as\r\nthey would deserve at the next session. It would seem very extraordinary\r\nif an inferior court in England, should take a matter out of the hands\r\nof the high court of Parliament, during a prorogation, and decide it\r\nagainst the opinion of both Houses.\r\n\r\nIt happens however, that, although no persons were so bold, as to go\r\nover as evidences, to prove the truth of the objections made against\r\nthis patent by the high court of Parliament here, yet these objections\r\nstand good, notwithstanding the answers made by Wood and his Council.\r\n\r\nThe Report says, that \"upon an assay made of the fineness, weight and\r\nvalue of this copper, it exceeded in every article.\" This is possible\r\nenough in the pieces upon which the assay was made; but Wood must have\r\nfailed very much in point of dexterity, if he had not taken care to\r\nprovide a sufficient quantity of such halfpence as would bear the trial;\r\nwhich he was well able to do, although \"they were taken out of several\r\nparcels.\" Since it is now plain, that the bias of favour hath been\r\nwholly on his side.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The report of the assayers as abstracted by the Lords of\r\nthe Committee in their report is not accurately stated. Monck Mason\r\nnotes that the abstract omits the following passage: \"But although the\r\ncopper was very good, and the money, one piece with another, was full\r\nweight, yet the single pieces were not so equally coined in the weight\r\nas they should have been.\" Nor is it shown that the coins assayed were\r\nof the same kind as those sent into Ireland. The Committee's report\r\nfails to see the question that must arise when it is noted that while in\r\nEngland a pound of copper was made into twenty-three pence, yet for\r\nIreland Wood was permitted to make it into thirty pence, in spite of the\r\nstatement that the copper used in England was worth fivepence a pound\r\nmore than that used by Wood. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut what need is there of disputing, when we have positive demonstration\r\nof Wood's fraudulent practices in this point? I have seen a large\r\nquantity of these halfpence weighed by a very skilful person, which were\r\nof four different kinds, three of them considerably under weight. I have\r\nnow before me an exact computation of the difference of weight between\r\nthese four sorts, by which it appears that the fourth sort, or the\r\nlightest, differs from the first to a degree, that, in the coinage of\r\nthree hundred and sixty tons of copper, the patentee will be a gainer,\r\nonly by that difference, of twenty-four thousand four hundred and\r\nninety-four pounds, and in the whole, the public will be a loser of\r\neighty-two thousand one hundred and sixty-eight pounds, sixteen\r\nshillings, even supposing the metal in point of goodness to answer\r\nWood's contract and the assay that hath been made; which it infallibly\r\ndoth not. For this point hath likewise been enquired into by very\r\nexperienced men, who, upon several trials in many of these halfpence,\r\nhave found them to be at least one fourth part below the real value (not\r\nincluding the raps or counterfeits that he or his accomplices have\r\nalready made of his own coin, and scattered about). Now the coinage of\r\nthree hundred and sixty ton of copper coined by the weight of the fourth\r\nor lightest sort of his halfpence will amount to one hundred twenty-two\r\nthousand four hundred eighty-eight pounds, sixteen shillings, and if we\r\nsubtract a fourth part of the real value by the base mixture in the\r\nmetal, we must add to the public loss one fourth part to be subtracted\r\nfrom the intrinsic value of the copper, which in three hundred and sixty\r\ntons amounts to ten thousand and eighty pounds, and this added to the\r\nformer sum of eighty-two thousand one hundred sixty-eight pounds,\r\nsixteen shillings, will make in all, ninety-two thousand two hundred\r\nforty-eight pounds loss to the public; besides the raps or counterfeits\r\nthat he may at any time hereafter think fit to coin. Nor do I know\r\nwhether he reckons the dross exclusive or inclusive with his three\r\nhundred and sixty ton of copper; which however will make a considerable\r\ndifference in the account.\r\n\r\nYou will here please to observe, that the profit allowed to Wood by the\r\npatent is twelvepence out of every pound of copper valued at _1s. 6d_.\r\nwhereas _5d_. only is allowed for coinage of a pound weight for the\r\nEnglish halfpence, and this difference is almost 25 _per cent_. which is\r\ndouble to the highest exchange of money, even under all the additional\r\npressures, and obstructions to trade, that this unhappy kingdom lies at\r\npresent. This one circumstance in the coinage of three hundred and sixty\r\nton of copper makes a difference of twenty-seven thousand seven hundred\r\nand twenty pounds between English and Irish halfpence, even allowing\r\nthose of Wood to be all of the heaviest sort.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise to be considered, that for every halfpenny in a pound\r\nweight exceeding the number directed by the patent, Wood will be a\r\ngainer in the coinage of three hundred and sixty ton of copper, sixteen\r\nhundred and eighty pounds profit more than the patent allows him; Out of\r\nwhich he may afford to make his comptrollers easy upon that article.\r\n\r\nAs to what is alleged, that \"these halfpence far exceed the like coinage\r\nfor Ireland in the reigns of His Majesty's predecessors;\" there cannot\r\nwell be a more exceptionable way of arguing: Although the fact were\r\ntrue, which however is altogether mistaken; not by any fault in the\r\nCommittee, but by the fraud and imposition of Wood, who certainly\r\nproduced the worst patterns he could find, such as were coined in small\r\nnumbers by permissions to private men, as butchers' halfpence, black\r\ndogs and the like, or perhaps the small St. Patrick's coin which passes\r\nfor a farthing, or at best some of the smallest raps of the latest kind.\r\nFor I have now by me some halfpence coined in the year 1680 by virtue of\r\nthe patent granted to my Lord Dartmouth, which was renewed to Knox, and\r\nthey are heavier by a ninth part than those of Wood, and in much better\r\nmetal. And the great St. Patrick's halfpenny is yet larger than either.\r\n\r\nBut what is all this to the present debate? If under the various\r\nexigencies of former times, by wars, rebellions, and insurrections, the\r\nKings of England were sometimes forced to pay their armies here with\r\nmixed or base money, God forbid that the necessities of turbulent times\r\nshould be a precedent for times of peace, and order, and settlement.\r\n\r\nIn the patent above mentioned granted to Lord Dartmouth, in the reign of\r\nKing Charles 2d. and renewed to Knox, the securities given into the\r\nexchequer, obliging the patentee to receive his money back upon every\r\ndemand, were an effectual remedy against all inconveniencies. And the\r\ncopper was coined in our own kingdom, so that we were in no danger to\r\npurchase it with the loss of all our silver and gold carried over to\r\nanother, nor to be at the trouble of going to England for the redressing\r\nof any abuse.\r\n\r\nThat the Kings of England have exercised their prerogative of coining\r\ncopper for Ireland and for England is not the present question: But (to\r\nspeak in the style of the Report) it would \"seem a little\r\nextraordinary,\" supposing a King should think fit to exercise his\r\nprerogative by coining copper in Ireland, to be current in England,\r\nwithout referring it to his officers in that kingdom to be informed\r\nwhether the grant was reasonable, and whether the people desired it or\r\nno, and without regard to the addresses of his Parliament against it.\r\nGod forbid that so mean a man as I should meddle with the King's\r\nprerogative: But I have heard very wise men say, that the King's\r\nprerogative is bounded and limited by the good and welfare of his\r\npeople. I desire to know, whether it is not understood and avowed that\r\nthe good of Ireland was intended by this patent. But Ireland is not\r\nconsulted at all in the matter, and as soon as Ireland is informed of\r\nit, they declare against it; the two Houses of Parliament and the\r\nPrivy-council addresses His Majesty upon the mischiefs apprehended by\r\nsuch a patent. The Privy-council in England takes the matter out of the\r\nParliament's cognizance; the good of the kingdom is dropped, and it is\r\nnow determined that Mr. Wood shall have the power of ruining a whole\r\nnation for his private advantage.\r\n\r\nI never can suppose that such patents as these were originally granted\r\nwith the view of being a job for the interest of a particular person, to\r\nthe damage of the public: Whatever profit must arise to the patentee was\r\nsurely meant at best but as a secondary motive, and since somebody must\r\nbe a gainer, the choice of the person was made either by favour, or\r\n_something else_[7] or by the pretence of merit and honesty. This\r\nargument returns so often and strongly into my head, that I cannot\r\nforbear frequently repeating it. Surely His Majesty, when he consented\r\nto the passing of this patent, conceived he was doing an act of grace to\r\nhis most loyal subjects of Ireland, without any regard to Mr. Wood,\r\nfarther than as an instrument. But the people of Ireland think this\r\npatent (intended _no doubt_ for their good) to be a most intolerable\r\ngrievance, and therefore Mr. Wood can never succeed, without an open\r\navowal that his profit is preferred not only before the interests, but\r\nthe very safety and being of a great kingdom; and a kingdom\r\ndistinguished for its loyalty, perhaps above all others upon earth. Not\r\nturned from its duty by the \"jurisdiction of the House of Lords,\r\nabolished at a stroke, by the hardships of the Act of Navigation newly\r\nenforced; By all possible obstructions in trade,\" and by a hundred\r\nother instances, \"enough to fill this paper.\" Nor was there ever among\r\nus the least attempt towards an insurrection in favour of the Pretender.\r\nTherefore whatever justice a free people can claim we have at least an\r\nequal title to it with our brethren in England, and whatever grace a\r\ngood prince can bestow on the most loyal subjects, we have reason to\r\nexpect it: Neither hath this kingdom any way deserved to be sacrificed\r\nto one \"single, rapacious, obscure, ignominious projector.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: A hint at the Duchess of Kendal's influence in the\r\nprocuring of the patent. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAmong other clauses mentioned in this patent, to shew how advantageous\r\nit is to Ireland, there is one which seems to be of a singular nature,\r\nthat the patentee shall be obliged, during his term, \"to pay eight\r\nhundred pounds a year to the crown, and two hundred pounds a year to the\r\ncomptroller.\"[8] I have heard indeed that the King's council do always\r\nconsider, in the passing of a patent, whether it will be of advantage to\r\nthe crown, but I have likewise heard that it is at the same time\r\nconsidered whether the passing of it may be injurious to any other\r\npersons or bodies politic. However, although the attorney and solicitor\r\nbe servants to the King, and therefore bound to consult His Majesty's\r\ninterest, yet I am under some doubt whether eight hundred pounds a year\r\nto the crown would be equivalent to the ruin of a kingdom. It would be\r\nfar better for us to have paid eight thousand pounds a year into His\r\nMajesty's coffers, in the midst of all our taxes (which, in proportion,\r\nare greater in this kingdom than ever they were in England, even during\r\nthe war) than purchase such an addition to the revenue at the price of\r\nour _utter undoing_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: By the terms of the patent, Wood covenanted to pay to the\r\nKing's clerk, or comptroller of the coinage, £200 yearly, and £100 per\r\nannum into his Majesty's exchequer, and not as Walpole's report has it,\r\n£800 and £200. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut here it is plain that fourteen thousand pounds are to be paid by\r\nWood, only as a small circumstantial charge for the purchase of his\r\npatent, what were his other visible costs I know not, and what were his\r\nlatent, is variously conjectured. But he must be surely a man of some\r\nwonderful merit. Hath he saved any other kingdom at his own expense, to\r\ngive him a title of reimbursing himself by the destruction of ours? Hath\r\nhe discovered the longitude or the universal medicine? No. But he hath\r\nfound out the philosopher's stone after a new manner, by debasing of\r\ncopper, and resolving to force it upon us for gold.\r\n\r\nWhen the two Houses represented to His Majesty, that this patent to Wood\r\nwas obtained in a clandestine manner, surely the Committee could not\r\nthink the Parliament would insinuate that it had not passed in the\r\ncommon forms, and run through every office where fees and perquisites\r\nwere due. They knew very well that persons in places were no enemies to\r\ngrants, and that the officers of the crown could not be kept in the\r\ndark. But the late Lord Lieutenant of Ireland[9] affirmed it was a\r\nsecret to him (and who will doubt of his veracity, especially when he\r\nswore to a person of quality; from whom I had it, that Ireland should\r\nnever be troubled with these halfpence). It was a secret to the people\r\nof Ireland, who were to be the only sufferers, and those who best knew\r\nthe state of the kingdom and were most able to advise in such an affair,\r\nwere wholly strangers to it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The Duke of Grafton. Walpole called him \"a fair-weather\r\npilot, that knew not what he had to do, when the first storm arose.\"\r\nCharles, second Duke of Grafton (1683-1757), was the grandfather of the\r\nthird duke, so virulently attacked by Junius in his famous letters. [T.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\nIt is allowed by the Report that this patent was passed without the\r\nknowledge of the chief governor or officers of Ireland; and it is there\r\nelaborately shewn, that \"former patents have passed in the same manner,\r\nand are good in law.\" I shall not dispute the legality of patents, but\r\nam ready to suppose it in His Majesty's power to grant a patent for\r\nstamping round bits of copper to every subject he hath. Therefore to lay\r\naside the point of law, I would only put the question, whether in reason\r\nand justice it would not have been proper, in an affair upon which the\r\nwelfare of a kingdom depends, that the said kingdom should have received\r\ntimely notice, and the matter not be carried on between the patentee and\r\nthe officers of the Crown, who were to be the only gainers by it.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament, who in matters of this nature are the most able and\r\nfaithful counsellors, did represent this grant to be \"destructive of\r\ntrade, and dangerous to the properties of the people,\" to which the only\r\nanswer is, that \"the King hath a prerogative to make such a grant.\"\r\n\r\nIt is asserted that in the patent to Knox, his \"halfpence, are made and\r\ndeclared the current coin of the kingdom,\" whereas in this to Wood,\r\nthere is only a \"power given to issue them to such as will receive\r\nthem.\" The authors of the Report, I think, do not affirm that the King\r\ncan by law declare _anything_ to be current money by his\r\nletters-patents. I dare say they will not affirm it, and if Knox's\r\npatent contained in it powers contrary to law, why is it mentioned as a\r\nprecedent in His Majesty's just and merciful reign:[10] But although\r\nthat clause be not in Wood's patent, yet possibly there are others, the\r\nlegality whereof may be equally doubted, and particularly that, whereby\r\n\"a power is given to William Wood to break into houses in search of any\r\ncoin made in imitation of his.\" This may perhaps be affirmed to be\r\nillegal and dangerous to the liberty of the subject. Yet this is a\r\nprecedent taken from Knox's patent, where the same power is granted, and\r\nis a strong instance what uses may be sometimes made of precedents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Knox's patent, as Monck Mason points out, did not contain\r\nthe right to have his coins pass as the current coin of the realm; that\r\nwas permitted by a proclamation of the lord lieutenant, and could in the\r\nsame manner be withdrawn. Knox's patent differed materially from that\r\ngranted to Wood, since he was obliged to take back his coins and give\r\ngold or silver for them, and no one was compelled to take more than five\r\nshillings in the payment of each £100. See note, p. 66. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut although before the passing of this patent, it was not thought\r\nnecessary to consult any persons of this kingdom, or make the least\r\nenquiry whether copper money were wanted among us; yet now at length,\r\nwhen the matter is over, when the patent hath long passed, when Wood\r\nhath already coined seventeen thousand pounds, and hath his tools and\r\nimplements prepared to coin six times as much more; the Committee hath\r\nbeen pleased to make this affair the subject of enquiry. Wood is\r\npermitted to produce his evidences, which consist as I have already\r\nobserved, of four in number, whereof Coleby, Brown and Mr. Finley the\r\nbanker are three. And these were to prove that copper money was\r\nextremely wanted in Ireland. The first had been out of the kingdom\r\nalmost twenty years, from the time that he was tried for robbing the\r\ntreasury, and therefore his knowledge and credibility are equal. The\r\nsecond may be allowed a more knowing witness, because I think it is not\r\nabove a year since the House of Commons ordered the Attorney-general to\r\nprosecute him, for endeavouring \"to take away the life of John Bingham\r\nEsq; member of parliaments by perjury and subornation.\" He asserted that\r\nhe was forced to tally with his labourers for want of small money (which\r\nhath often been practised in England by Sir Ambrose Crawley[11] and\r\nothers) but those who knew him better give a different reason, (if there\r\nbe any truth at all in the fact) that he was forced to tally with his\r\nlabourers not for want of halfpence, but of more substantial money,\r\nwhich is highly possible, because the race of suborners, forgers,\r\nperjurers and ravishers, are usually people of no fortune, or of those\r\nwho have run it out by their vices and profuseness. Mr. Finley the third\r\nwitness honestly confessed, that he was ignorant whether Ireland wanted\r\ncopper money or no; but all his intention was to buy a certain quantity\r\nfrom Wood at a large discount, and sell them as well as he could, by\r\nwhich he hoped to get two or three thousand pounds for himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Ambrose Crowley (not Crawley) was alderman and sheriff of\r\nLondon. He was knighted January 1st, 1706-1707, and sat in the House of\r\nCommons as member for Andover in 1713-1714. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut suppose there were not one single halfpenny of copper coin in this\r\nwhole kingdom (which Mr. Wood seems to intend, unless we will come to\r\nhis terms, as appears by employing his emissaries to buy up our old ones\r\nat a penny in the shilling more than they pass for), it could not be any\r\nreal evil to us, although it might be some inconvenience. We have many\r\nsorts of small silver coins, to which they are strangers in England,\r\nsuch as the French threepences, fourpence halfpennies and eightpence\r\nhalf-pennies, the Scotch fivepences and tenpences, besides their\r\ntwenty-pences, and three-and-four-pences, by all which we are able to\r\nmake change to a halfpenny of almost any piece of gold or silver, and if\r\nwe are driven to Brown's expedient of a sealed card, with the little\r\ngold or silver still remaining, it will I suppose, be somewhat better\r\nthan to have nothing left but Wood's adulterated copper, which he is\r\nneither obliged by his patent, nor hitherto able by his estate to make\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe Report farther tells us, it \"must be admitted that letters-patents\r\nunder the Great Seal of Great Britain for coining copper money for\r\nIreland are legal and obligatory, a just and reasonable exercise of His\r\nMajesty's royal prerogative, and in no manner derogatory or invasive of\r\nany liberty or privilege of his subjects of Ireland.\" First we desire to\r\nknow, why His Majesty's prerogative might not have been as well\r\nasserted, by passing this patent in Ireland, and subjecting the several\r\nconditions of the contract to the inspection of those who are only\r\nconcerned, as was formerly done in the only precedents for patents\r\ngranted for coining for this kingdom, since the mixed money[12] in Queen\r\nElizabeth's time, during the difficulties of a rebellion: Whereas now\r\nupon the greatest imposition that can possibly be practised, we must go\r\nto England with our complaints, where it hath been for some time the\r\nfashion to think and to affirm that \"we cannot be too hardly used.\"\r\nAgain the Report says, that \"such patents are obligatory.\" After long\r\nthinking, I am not able to find out what can possibly be meant here by\r\nthis word _obligatory_. This patent of Wood neither obligeth him to\r\nutter his coin, nor us to take it, or if it did the latter, it would be\r\nso far void, because no patent can oblige the subject against law,\r\nunless an illegal patent passed in one kingdom can bind another and not\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"Civill warre having set all Ireland in a combustion, the\r\nQueene [Elizabeth] more easily to subdue the rebels, did take silver\r\ncoyne from the Irish, some few years before her death, and paid her army\r\nwith a mixed base coyne, which, by proclamation, was commanded to be\r\nspent and received, for sterling silver money. This base mixed money had\r\nthree parts of copper, and the fourth part of silver, which proportion\r\nof silver was in some part consumed by the mixture, so as the English\r\ngoldsmiths valued a shilling thereof at no more than two silver pence,\r\nthough they acknowledged the same to be worth two pence halfpenny.\"\r\n(Fynes Moryson's \"Itinerary,\" pt. i., p. 283). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nLastly, it is added that \"such patents are in no manner derogatory or\r\ninvasive of any liberty or privilege of the King's subjects of Ireland.\"\r\nIf this proposition be true, as it is here laid down, without any\r\nlimitation either expressed or implied, it must follow that a King of\r\nEngland may at any time coin copper money for Ireland, and oblige his\r\nsubjects here to take a piece of copper under the value of half a\r\nfarthing for half-a-crown, as was practised by the late King James, and\r\neven without that arbitrary prince's excuse, from the necessity and\r\nexigences of his affairs. If this be in no manner \"derogatory nor\r\nevasive of any liberties or privileges of the subjects of Ireland,\" it\r\nought to have been expressed what our liberties and privileges are, and\r\nwhether we have any at all, for in specifying the word _Ireland_,\r\ninstead of saying \"His Majesty's subjects,\" it would seem to insinuate\r\nthat we are not upon the same foot with our fellow-subjects in\r\n_England_; which, however the practice may have been, I hope will never\r\nbe directly asserted, for I do not understand that Poining's act[13]\r\ndeprived us of our liberty, but only changed the manner of passing laws\r\nhere (which however was a power most indirectly obtained) by leaving the\r\nnegative to the two Houses of Parliament. But, waiving all controversies\r\nrelating to the legislature, no person, I believe, was ever yet so bold\r\nas to affirm that the people of Ireland have not the same title to the\r\nbenefits of the common law, with the rest of His Majesty's subjects, and\r\ntherefore whatever liberties or privileges the people of England enjoy\r\nby common law, we of Ireland have the same; so that in my humble\r\nopinion, the word _Ireland_ standing in that proposition, was, in the\r\nmildest interpretation, _a lapse of the pen_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: It was not intended that Poyning's act should interfere\r\nwith the liberty of the people, but it is undoubted that advantage was\r\ntaken of this law, and an interpretation put on it far different from\r\nthe intention that brought it on the statute books. It was passed by a\r\nparliament convened by Sir Edward Poyning, at Drogheda, in the tenth\r\nyear of Henry VII.'s reign. Its immediate cause was the invasion of\r\nPerkin Warbeck. That pretender assumed royal authority in Ireland and\r\nhad several statutes passed during his short-lived term of power. To\r\nprevent any viceroy from arrogating to himself the powers of law-making\r\nit was enacted by Poyning's parliament:\r\n\r\n\"That no parliament be holden hereafter in Ireland, but at such season\r\nas the King's lieutenant and counsaile there first do certifie the King,\r\nunder the Great Seal of that land, the causes and considerations, and\r\nall such acts as them seemeth should pass in the same parliament, and\r\nsuch causes, considerations, and acts affirmed by the King and his\r\ncounsaile to be good and expedient for that land, and his licence\r\nthereupon, as well in affirmation of the said causes and acts, as to\r\nsummon the said parliament, under his Great Seal of England had and\r\nobtained; that done, a parliament to be had and holden as afore\r\nrehearsed\" (\"Irish Statutes,\" vol. i., p. 44).\r\n\r\nTwo statutes, one, the Act of 3 and 4 Phil., and Mary, cap. 4, and the\r\nother of II Eliz. Ses. 3, cap. 8, explain this act further, and the\r\nlatter points out the reason for the original enactment, namely, that\r\n\"before this statute, when liberty was given to the governors to call\r\nparliaments at their pleasure, acts passed as well to the dishonour of\r\nthe prince, as to the hindrance of their subjects\" (\"Irish Statutes,\"\r\nvol. i., p. 346).\r\n\r\n\"By Poyning's Law,\" says Lecky, \"a great part of the independence of\r\nthe Irish Parliament had indeed been surrendered; but even the servile\r\nParliament which passed it, though extending by its own authority to\r\nIreland laws previously enacted in England, never admitted the right of\r\nthe English Parliament to make laws for Ireland.\" (\"Hist. Ireland,\" vol.\r\nii., p. 154; 1892 ed). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe Report farther asserts, that \"the precedents are many, wherein cases\r\nof great importance to Ireland, and that immediately affected the\r\ninterests of that kingdom, warrants, orders, and directions by the\r\nauthority of the King and his predecessors, have been issued under the\r\nroyal sign manual, without any previous reference or advice of His\r\nMajesty's officers of Ireland, which have always had their due force,\r\nand have been punctually complied with, and obeyed.\" It may be so, and I\r\nam heartily sorry for it, because it may prove an eternal source of\r\ndiscontent. However among all these precedents there is not one of a\r\npatent for coining money for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing hath perplexed me more than this doctrine of\r\nprecedents. If a job is to be done, and upon searching records you find\r\nit hath been done before, there will not want a lawyer to justify the\r\nlegality of it, by producing his precedents, without ever considering\r\nthe motives and circumstances that first introduced them, the necessity\r\nor turbulence or iniquity of times, the corruptions of ministers, or the\r\narbitrary disposition of the prince then reigning. And I have been told\r\nby persons eminent in the law, that the worst actions which human nature\r\nis capable of, may be justified by the same doctrine. How the first\r\nprecedents began of determining cases of the highest importance to\r\nIreland, and immediately affecting its interest, without any previous\r\nreference or advice to the King's officers here, may soon be accounted\r\nfor. Before this kingdom was entirely reduced by the submission of\r\nTyrone in the last year of Queen Elizabeth's reign, there was a period\r\nof four hundred years, which was a various scene of war and peace\r\nbetween the English pale and the Irish natives, and the government of\r\nthat part of this island which lay in the English hands, was, in many\r\nthings under the immediate administration of the King. Silver and copper\r\nwere often coined here among us, and once at least upon great necessity,\r\na mixed or base metal was sent from England. The reign of King James\r\nIst. was employed in settling the kingdom after Tyrone's rebellion, and\r\nthis nation flourished extremely till the time of the massacre 1641. In\r\nthat difficult juncture of affairs, the nobility and gentry coined their\r\nown plate here in Dublin.\r\n\r\nBy all that I can discover, the copper coin of Ireland for three hundred\r\nyears past consisted of small pence and halfpence, which particular men\r\nhad licence to coin, and were current only within certain towns and\r\ndistricts, according to the personal credit of the owner who uttered\r\nthem, and was bound to receive them again, whereof I have seen many\r\nsorts; neither have I heard of any patent granted for coining copper for\r\nIreland till the reign of King Charles II. which was in the year 1680.\r\nto George Legge Lord Dartmouth, and renewed by King James II. in the\r\nfirst year of his reign to John Knox. Both patents were passed in\r\nIreland, and in both the patentees were obliged to receive their coin\r\nagain to any that would offer then twenty shillings of it, for which\r\nthey were obliged to pay gold or silver.\r\n\r\nThe patents both of Lord Dartmouth and Knox were referred to the\r\nAttorney-general here, and a report made accordingly, and both, as I\r\nhave already said, were passed in this kingdom. Knox had only a patent\r\nfor the remainder of the term granted to Lord Dartmouth, the patent\r\nexpired in 1701, and upon a petition by Roger Moor to have it renewed,\r\nthe matter was referred hither, and upon the report of the attorney and\r\nsolicitor, that it was not for His Majesty's service or the interest of\r\nthe nation to have it renewed, it was rejected by King William. It\r\nshould therefore seem very extraordinary, that a patent for coining\r\ncopper halfpence, intended and professed for the good of the kingdom,\r\nshould be passed without once consulting that kingdom, for the good of\r\nwhich it is declared to be intended, and this upon the application of a\r\n\"poor, private obscure mechanic;\" and a patent of such a nature, that as\r\nsoon as ever the kingdom is informed of its being passed, they cry out\r\nunanimously against it as ruinous and destructive. The representative\r\nof the nation in Parliament, and the Privy-council address the King to\r\nhave it recalled; yet the patentee, such a one as I have described,\r\nshall prevail to have this patent approved, and his private interest\r\nshall weigh down the application of a whole kingdom. St. Paul says, \"All\r\nthings are lawful, but all things are not expedient.\" We are answered\r\nthat this patent is lawful, but is it expedient? We read that the\r\nhigh-priest said \"It was expedient that one Man should die for the\r\npeople;\" and this was a most wicked proposition. But that a whole nation\r\nshould die for one man, was never heard of before.\r\n\r\nBut because much weight is laid on the precedents of other patents, for\r\ncoining copper for Ireland, I will set this matter in as clear a light\r\nas I can. Whoever hath read the Report, will be apt to think, that a\r\ndozen precedents at least could be produced of copper coined for\r\nIreland, by virtue of patents passed in England, and that the coinage\r\nwas there too; whereas I am confident, there cannot be one precedent\r\nshewn of a patent passed in England for coining copper for Ireland, for\r\nabove an hundred years past, and if there were any before, it must be in\r\ntimes of confusion. The only patents I could ever hear of, are those\r\nalready mentioned to Lord Dartmouth and Knox; the former in 1680. and\r\nthe latter in 1685. Now let us compare these patents with that granted\r\nto Wood. First, the patent to Knox, which was under the same conditions\r\nas that granted to Lord Dartmouth, was passed in Ireland, the government\r\nand the Attorney and Solicitor-general making report that it would be\r\nuseful to this kingdom: [The patentee was obliged to make every\r\nhalfpenny one hundred and ten grains Troy weight, whereby _2s. 2d_. only\r\ncould be coined out of a pound of copper.][14] The patent was passed\r\nwith the advice of the King's council here; The patentee was obliged to\r\nreceive his coin from those who thought themselves surcharged, and to\r\ngive gold and silver for it; Lastly, The patentee was to pay only _16l.\r\n13s. 4d. per ann._ to the crown. Then, as to the execution of that\r\npatent. First, I find the halfpence were milled, which, as it is of\r\ngreat use to prevent counterfeits (and therefore industriously avoided\r\nby Wood) so it was an addition to the charge of coinage. And for the\r\nweight and goodness of the metal; I have several halfpence now by me,\r\nmany of which weigh a ninth part more than those coined by Wood, and\r\nbear the fire and hammer a great deal better; and which is no trifle,\r\nthe impression fairer and deeper. I grant indeed, that many of the\r\nlatter coinage yield in weight to some of Wood's, by a fraud natural to\r\nsuch patentees; but not so immediately after the grant, and before the\r\ncoin grew current: For in this circumstance Mr. Wood must serve for a\r\nprecedent in future times.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The portion here in square brackets was printed in the\r\nfourth edition of this Letter and in the work entitled, \"Fraud\r\nDetected.\" It is not given in Faulkner's first collected edition issued\r\nin 1735, nor in \"The Hibernian Patriot,\" issued in 1730. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now examine this new patent granted to William Wood. It passed\r\nupon very false suggestions of his own, and of a few confederates: It\r\npassed in England, without the least reference hither. It passed unknown\r\nto the very Lord Lieutenant, then in England. Wood is empowered to coin\r\none hundred and eight thousand pounds, \"and all the officers in the\r\nkingdom (civil and military) are commanded\" in the Report to countenance\r\nand assist him. Knox had only power to utter what we would take, and was\r\nobliged \"to receive his coin back again at our demand,\" and to \"enter\r\ninto security for so doing.\" Wood's halfpence are not milled, and\r\ntherefore more easily counterfeited by himself as well as by others:\r\nWood pays a thousand pounds _per ann._ for 14 years, Knox paid only\r\n_16l. 13s. 4d. per ann._ for 21 years.\r\n\r\nIt was the Report that set me the example of making a comparison between\r\nthose two patents, wherein the committee was grossly misled by the false\r\nrepresentation of William Wood, as it was by another assertion, that\r\nseven hundred ton of copper were coined during the 21 years of Lord\r\nDartmouth's and Knox's patents. Such a quantity of copper at the rate of\r\n_2s. 8d. per_ pound would amount to about an hundred and ninety thousand\r\npounds, which was very near as much as the current cash of the kingdom\r\nin those days; yet, during that period, Ireland was never known to have\r\ntoo much copper coin, and for several years there was no coining at all:\r\nBesides I am assured, that upon enquiring into the custom-house books,\r\nall the copper imported into the kingdom, from 1683 to 1692, which\r\nincludes 8 years of the 21 (besides one year allowed for the troubles)\r\ndid not exceed 47 tons, and we cannot suppose even that small quantity\r\nto have been wholly applied to coinage: So that I believe there was\r\nnever any comparison more unluckily made or so destructive of the design\r\nfor which it was produced.\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist reckons it an effect of God's anger, when \"He selleth His\r\npeople for nought, and taketh no money for them.\" That we have greatly\r\noffended God by the wickedness of our lives is not to be disputed: But\r\nour King we have not offended in word or deed; and although he be God's\r\nvicegerent upon earth, he will not punish us for any offences, except\r\nthose which we shall commit against his legal authority, his sacred\r\nperson (which God preserve) or the laws of the land.\r\n\r\nThe Report is very profuse in arguments, that Ireland is in great want\r\nof copper money.[15] Who were the witnesses to prove it, hath been shewn\r\nalready, but in the name of God, Who are to be judges? Does not the\r\nnation best know its own wants? Both Houses of Parliament, the\r\nPrivy-council and the whole body of the people declare the contrary: Or\r\nlet the wants be what they will, We desire they may not be supplied by\r\nMr. Wood. We know our own wants but too well; they are many and grievous\r\nto be borne, but quite of another kind. Let England be satisfied: As\r\nthings go, they will in a short time have all our gold and silver, and\r\nmay keep their adulterate copper at home, for we are determined not to\r\npurchase it with our manufactures, which Wood hath graciously offered to\r\naccept. Our wants are not so bad by an hundredth part as the method he\r\nhath taken to supply them. He hath already tried his faculty in\r\nNew-England,[16] and I hope he will meet at least with an equal\r\nreception here; what _that_ was I leave to public intelligence. I am\r\nsupposing a wild case, that if there should be any person already\r\nreceiving a monstrous pension out of this kingdom, who was instrumental\r\nin procuring this patent, they have either not well consulted their own\r\ninterests, or Wood must[17] put more dross into his copper and still\r\ndiminish its weight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: On this subject of the want of small money in Ireland,\r\nMonck Mason traverses the Report in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"There appears to be a manifest prevarication in their lordships' report\r\nupon this part of the subject; they state, that the witnesses testified,\r\nthat there was a want of small money in Ireland; they attempt,\r\ntherefore, to impose a copper currency, which certainly was not wanted.\r\nTo satisfy the reader upon this point, I shall quote, from the\r\nunpublished correspondence of Archbishop King, the following extracts:\r\nthe first, from his letter to General Gorge, dated the 17th October,\r\n1724, is to the following purpose.\r\n\r\n\"'... As to our wanting halfpence for change, it is most false; we have\r\nmore halfpence than we need, already; it is true, we want change; but it\r\nis sixpences, shillings, half-crowns, and crowns; our silver and our\r\nguineas being almost gone; and the general current coin of the kingdom\r\nis now moydores, which are thirty shillings a-piece; at least nine pence\r\nabove the value in silver: now, they would have us change these for\r\nhalfpence, and so the whole cash of the kingdom would be these\r\nhalfpence.' ...\r\n\r\n\"But the true state of the case, as to coin, is more circumstantially\r\ndeveloped in the following letter of the same prelate to Mr. Southwell,\r\nwhich was written a few months before, viz., on the 9th June, 1724.\r\n\r\n\"'... And yet, after all, we want change, and I will take leave to\r\nacquaint you with the state of this kingdom as to coin. We used to have\r\nhardly any money passing here, but foreign ducatoons, plate pieces,\r\nperns, dollars, etc. but, when the East India Company were forbid\r\nsending the coin of England abroad, they continued to buy up all our\r\nforeign coin, and give us English money in lieu of some part of it; by\r\nwhich we lost twopence in every ounce, the consequence of this was, that\r\nin two years there was not to be seen in Ireland a piece of foreign\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n\"'If any be brought, it is immediately sent away, the two, or as I am\r\ninformed, the three pence in the ounce, given by the East India Company,\r\nbeing a temptation not to be resisted; but, the truth is, very little is\r\nbrought in, for the merchants that carry our commodities to foreign\r\nmarkets, find it more to their advantage to carry directly to London\r\nwhatever they receive in cash; and whereas formerly they used, when they\r\nhad disposed of their cargo, to load their vessels with such commodities\r\nas there was a demand for in Ireland, and bring the rest in cash, they\r\nbring now only the commodities, and send the silver to London; and when\r\nthey have got the twopence in every ounce from the East India Company,\r\nthe rest serves to answer the returns we are obliged to make to England,\r\nfor the rents we are obliged to pay to noblemen and gentlemen who have\r\nestates in Ireland and live in England, and for the pensions, and other\r\noccasions which are many; by this means they gain likewise the exchange,\r\nwhich is commonly four or five per cent, better to them than if they\r\nsent cash.\r\n\r\n\"'It Is farther to be observed, that 21 shillings, which is the value of\r\na guinea in England, makes in Ireland 22 shillings and 9 pence, whereas\r\na guinea passes for 23 shillings with us, therefore, he who sends silver\r\ninto England, gains three pence more by it than if he sent guineas; this\r\nadvantage, though it may seem little, yet in a manner has entirely\r\ndrained us of our English money which was given in lieu of foreign\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n\"'But farther, if any carry foreign gold to England, they cannot easily\r\npass it, and if they do, it is at a greater loss than there is in the\r\nguineas, this has taken away our guineas, so that there is hardly one to\r\nbe seen; we have hardly any coin left but a few moydores and pistoles,\r\nwhich can, by no means, serve the inland trade of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"'To give, therefore, a short view of our case, it is thus; We can have\r\nEnglish coin but by stealth, there being an act of parliament forbidding\r\nthe exportation of English coin; if, therefore, we should send our gold\r\nor silver to England to be coined, we cannot have it back again, or if\r\nwe could, we cannot keep it for the reason above; we cannot for the same\r\nreason have foreign silver; let us add to these, that by the act of\r\nnavigation and other acts, we cannot make our markets of buying where we\r\nmake our markets for selling; though we might have the commodities we\r\nwant much cheaper there, than we can have them in England, viz. all East\r\nIndia and Turkey goods, with many others: nor is it to be expected that\r\nany nation will trade with us with their silver only, when we will not\r\nexchange commodities with them.\r\n\r\n\"'Except, therefore, England designs entirely to ruin Ireland, a kingdom\r\nby which it is demonstrable that she gains yearly thirteen or fourteen\r\nhundred thousand pounds, she ought to think of giving us some relief'\"\r\n(\"History of St. Patrick's,\" pp. xciii-xciv). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: See note on p. 14. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Another hint at the Duchess of Kendal and her connection\r\nwith the patent. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nUpon Wood's complaint that the officers of the King's revenue here had\r\nalready given orders to all the inferior officers not to receive any\r\nof his coin, the Report says, That \"this cannot but be looked upon as a\r\nvery extraordinary proceeding,\" and being contrary to the powers given\r\nin the patent, the Committee say, They \"cannot advise His Majesty to\r\ngive directions to the officers of the revenue here, not to receive or\r\nutter any of the said coin as has been desired in the addresses of both\r\nHouses,\" but on the contrary, they \"think it both just and reasonable\r\nthat the King should immediately give orders to the commissioners of the\r\nrevenue, &c. to revoke all orders, &c. that may have been given by them\r\nto hinder or obstruct the receiving the said coin.\" And accordingly, we\r\nare told, such orders are arrived.[18]. Now this was a cast of Wood's\r\npolitics; for his information was wholly false and groundless, which he\r\nknew very well; and that the commissioners of the revenue here were\r\nall, except one, sent us from England, and love their employments too\r\nwell to have taken such a step: But Wood was wise enough to consider,\r\nthat such orders of revocation would be an open declaration of the crown\r\nin his favour, would put the government here under a difficulty, would\r\nmake a noise, and possibly create some terror in the poor people of\r\nIreland. And one great point he hath gained, that although any orders of\r\nrevocation will be needless, yet a new order is to be sent, and perhaps\r\nalready here, to the commissioners of the revenue, and all the King's\r\nofficers in Ireland, that Wood's \"halfpence be suffered and permitted,\r\nwithout any let, suit, trouble, molestation or denial of any of the\r\nKing's officers or ministers whatsoever, to pass and be received as\r\ncurrent money by such as shall be willing to receive them.\" In this\r\norder there is no exception, and therefore, as far as I can judge, it\r\nincludes all officers both civil and military, from the Lord High\r\nChancellor to a justice of peace, and from the general to an ensign: So\r\nthat Wood's project is not likely to fail for want of managers enough.\r\nFor my own part, as things stand, I have but little regret to find\r\nmyself out of the number, and therefore I shall continue in all humility\r\nto exhort and warn my fellow-subjects never to receive or utter this\r\ncoin, which will reduce the kingdom to beggary by much quicker and\r\nlarger steps than have hitherto been taken.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Archbishop King's letter, quoted by Monck Mason, explains\r\nwhy it was that the revenue officers refused to receive Wood's coins. It\r\nseems the officers had been advised by lawyers that, in the event of\r\ntheir taking the coins, it might be quite likely they would be compelled\r\nto make them good, should such a demand be made of them. Precedents\r\ncould easily be cited by those taking action, since all previous patents\r\nissued to private individuals for coining money, required of the\r\npatentee to take them back and pay for them with gold or silver. [T.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The suggestion thus made by the Lords of the Committee,\r\nalthough coupled with the reduction in the amount of money Wood was to\r\nbe permitted to introduce, did not do any good. Archbishop King argued\r\nrightly that this was treating the people of Ireland as if they were\r\nfools and children. If Wood could coin £40,000, what was to prevent him\r\ncoining £200,000? The suggestion indeed irritated the people almost as\r\nmuch as did the patent itself. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut it is needless to argue any longer. The matter is come to an issue.\r\nHis Majesty pursuant to the law, hath left the field open between Wood\r\nand the kingdom of Ireland. Wood hath liberty to offer his coin, and we\r\nhave law, reason, liberty and necessity to refuse it. A knavish jockey\r\nmay ride an old foundered jade about the market, but none are obliged to\r\nbuy it. I hope the words \"voluntary\" and \"willing to receive it\" will be\r\nunderstood, and applied in their true natural meaning, as commonly\r\nunderstood by Protestants. For if a fierce captain comes to my shop to\r\nbuy six yards of scarlet cloth, followed by a porter laden with a sack\r\nof Wood's coin upon his shoulders, if we are agreed about the price, and\r\nmy scarlet lies ready cut upon the counter, if he then gives me the word\r\nof command, to receive my money in Wood's coin, and calls me a\r\n\"disaffected Jacobite dog\" for refusing it (although I am as loyal a\r\nsubject as himself, and without hire) and thereupon seizes my cloth,\r\nleaving me the price in his odious copper, and bids me take my remedy:\r\nIn this case, I shall hardly be brought to think that I am left to my\r\nown will. I shall therefore on such occasions, first order the porter\r\naforesaid to go off with his pack, and then see the money in silver and\r\ngold in my possession before I cut or measure my cloth. But if a common\r\nsoldier drinks his pot first, and then offers payment in Wood's\r\nhalfpence, the landlady may be under some difficulty; For if she\r\ncomplains to his captain or ensign, they are likewise officers, included\r\nin this general order for encouraging these halfpence to pass as current\r\nmoney. If she goes to a justice of peace, he is also an officer, to whom\r\nthis general order is directed. I do therefore advise her to follow my\r\npractice, which I have already begun, and be paid for her goods before\r\nshe parts with them. However I should have been content, for some\r\nreasons, that the military gentlemen had been excepted by name, because\r\nI have heard it said, that their discipline is best confined within\r\ntheir own district.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty in the conclusion of his answer to the address of the House\r\nof Lords against Wood's coin, is pleased to say that \"he will do\r\neverything in his power for the satisfaction of his people.\" It should\r\nseem therefore, that the recalling the patent is not to be understood as\r\na thing in his power. But however since the law does not oblige us to\r\nreceive this coin, and consequently the patent leaves it to our\r\nvoluntary choice, there is nothing remaining to preserve us from rain\r\nbut that the whole kingdom should continue in a firm determinate\r\nresolution never to receive or utter this fatal coin:[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: So ready was the response to this suggestion of Swift's,\r\nthat it was found necessary for tradesmen to take precautions to have it\r\npublicly known that they were in no way connected with Wood and his\r\nmoney, The following is a copy of an advertisement which illustrates\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas several persons in this kingdom suspect that John Molyneux of\r\nMeath Street, ironmonger, and his brother Daniel Molyneux, of Essex\r\nStreet, ironmonger, are interested in the patent obtained by William\r\nWood for coining of halfpence and farthings for this kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"Now we the said John Molyneux and Daniel Molyneux, in order to satisfy\r\nthe public, do hereby declare, that we are in no way concerned with the\r\nsaid Wood in relation to his said patent; And that we never were\r\npossessed of any of the said halfpence or farthings, except one\r\nhalfpence and one farthing, which I the said John Molyneux received in a\r\npost-letter, and which I immediately afterwards delivered to one of the\r\nLords-Justices of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"And we do further declare, that we will not directly or indirectly, be\r\nanyways concerned with the said Wood's halfpence or farthings; but on\r\nthe contrary, act to the great advantage and satisfaction of this\r\nkingdom, as good, loving and faithful subjects ought to do. And we do\r\nfurther declare, that to the best of our knowledge, the said William\r\nWood is not in this kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"Given under our hands in Dublin this 22d. day of August 1724.\r\n\r\n\"JOHN MOLYNEUX\r\n\r\n\"DAN. MOLYNEUX.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, I, Thomas Handy, of Meath Street, Dublin, did receive by the\r\nlast packet, from a person in London, to whom I am an entire stranger,\r\nbills of lading for eleven casks of Wood's halfpence, shipped at\r\nBristol, and consigned to me by the said person on his own proper\r\naccount, of which I had not the least notice until I received the said\r\nbills of lading.\r\n\r\n\"Now I, the said Thomas Handy, being highly sensible of the duty and\r\nregard which every honest man owes to his country and to his\r\nfellow-subjects, do hereby declare, that I will not be concerned,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in entering, landing, importing, receiving, or\r\nuttering any of the said Wood's halfpence, for that I am fully\r\nconvinced, as well from the addresses of both Houses of Parliament, as\r\notherwise, that the importing and uttering the said halfpence will be\r\ndestructive to this nation, and prejudicial to his Majesty's revenue.\r\n\r\n\"And of this my resolution I gave notice by letter to the person who\r\nsent me the bills of lading, the very day I received them, and have sent\r\nback the said bills to him.\r\n\r\n\"THO. HANDY.\r\n\r\n\"Dublin, 29th. August, 1724.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAfter which, let the officers to whom these orders are directed, (I\r\nwould willingly except the military) come with their exhortations,\r\ntheir arguments and their eloquence, to persuade us to find our interest\r\nin our undoing. Let Wood and his accomplices travel about the country\r\nwith cart-loads of their ware, and see who will take it off their hands,\r\nthere will be no fear of his being robbed, for a highwayman would scorn\r\nto touch it.\r\n\r\nI am only in pain how the commissioners of the revenue will proceed in\r\nthis juncture; because I am told they are obliged by act of Parliament\r\nto take nothing but gold and silver in payment for His Majesty's\r\ncustoms, and I think they cannot justly offer this coinage of Mr. Wood\r\nto others, unless they will be content to receive it themselves.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the whole is this. The \"Committee advises the King to send\r\nimmediate orders to all his officers here, that Wood's coin be suffered\r\nand permitted without any let, suit, trouble, &c. to pass and be\r\nreceived as current money by such as shall be willing to receive the\r\nsame.\" It is probable, that the first willing receivers may be those who\r\nmust receive it whether they will or no, at least under the penalty of\r\nlosing an office. But the landed undepending men, the merchants, the\r\nshopkeepers and bulk of the people, I hope, and am almost confident,\r\nwill never receive it. What must the consequence be? The owners will\r\nsell it for as much as they can get. Wood's halfpence will come to be\r\noffered for six a penny (yet then he will be a sufficient gainer) and\r\nthe necessary receivers will be losers of two-thirds in their salaries\r\nor pay.\r\n\r\nThis puts me in mind of a passage I was told many years ago in England.\r\nAt a quarter-sessions in Leicester, the justices had wisely decreed, to\r\ntake off a halfpenny in a quart from the price of ale. One of them, who\r\ncame in after the thing was determined, being informed of what had\r\npassed, said thus: \"Gentlemen; you have made an order, that ale should\r\nbe sold in our country for three halfpence a quart: I desire you will\r\nnow make another to appoint who must drink it, for _by G-- I will\r\nnot_.\"[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The following broadside, ascribed to Swift, but written\r\nprobably by Sheridan, further amusingly illustrates the point Swift\r\nmakes. The broadside was printed by John Harding:\r\n\r\n\"Another Letter to Mr. Harding the printer, upon occasion of the Report\r\nof the Committee of the Lords of His Majesty's Most Honourable\r\nPrivy-Council, in relation to Mr. Wood's halfpence and farthings, etc.,\r\nlately published.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Harding,--Although this letter also is directed to you, yet you\r\nknow that it is intended for the benefit of the whole kingdom, and\r\ntherefore I pray make it public, and take care to disperse it.\r\n\r\n\"The design of it is only to desire all people to take notice, That\r\nwhatever apprehensions some persons seem to be under on account of the\r\nabove-mentioned report concerning Mr. Wood's halfpence and farthings,\r\nyet the utmost advice which the right honourable Committee have thought\r\nfit to give His Majesty, is, That a certain sum of the said halfpence\r\nand farthings may be received as current money by such as shall be\r\nwilling to receive the same. And if we are willing to ruin ourselves and\r\nour country, I think we are not to be pitied.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this occasion I would only tell my countrymen a short story.\r\n\r\n\"A certain King of Great Britain who spoke broad Scotch, and being\r\nhimself a man of wit, loved both to hear and speak things that were\r\nhumorous, had once a petition preferred to him, in which the petitioner,\r\nhaving set forth his own merits, most humbly prayed His Majesty to grant\r\nhim letters-patent for receiving a shilling from every one of his\r\nsubjects who should be willing to give so much to him. 'In gude troth,'\r\nsaid the King, 'a very reasonable petition. Let every man give thee twa\r\nshillings gin he be willing so to do, and thou shalt have full liberty\r\nto receive it.' 'But,' says the petitioner, 'I desire that this clause\r\nmay be inserted in my patent, That every man who refuses to give me a\r\nshilling, should appear at Westminster Hall to shew cause why he so\r\nrefuses.' 'This also,' says the King, 'shall be granted thee, but always\r\nwith this proviso, that the man be willing to come.'\r\n\r\n\"I am your, etc.\r\n\r\n\"MISOXULOS.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nI must beg leave to caution your lordships and worships in one\r\nparticular. Wood hath graciously promised to load us at present only\r\nwith forty thousand pounds of his coin, till the exigences of the\r\nkingdom require the rest. I entreat you will never suffer Mr. Wood to be\r\na judge of your exigences. While there is one piece of silver or gold\r\nremaining in the kingdom he will call it an exigency, he will double his\r\npresent _quantum_ by stealth as soon as he can, and will have the\r\nremainder still to the good. He will pour his own raps[22]and\r\ncounterfeits upon us: France and Holland will do the same; nor will our\r\nown coiners at home be behind them: To confirm which I have now in my\r\npocket a rap or counterfeit halfpenny in imitation of his, but so ill\r\nperformed, that in my conscience I believe it is not of his coining.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The word Rap is probably a contraction of \"raparee,\" and\r\nwas the name given to the tokens that passed current in Ireland for\r\ncopper coins of small value. Generally it referred to debased coins;\r\nhence it may be allied to \"raparee,\" who might be considered as a\r\ndebased citizen. The raparees were so called from the rapary or\r\nhalf-pike they carried. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI must now desire your lordships and worships that you will give great\r\nallowance for this long undigested paper, I find myself to have gone\r\ninto several repetitions, which were the effects of haste, while new\r\nthoughts fell in to add something to what I had said before. I think I\r\nmay affirm that I have fully answered every paragraph in the Report,\r\nwhich although it be not unartfully drawn, and is perfectly in the\r\nspirit of a pleader who can find the most plausible topics in behalf of\r\nhis client, yet there was no great skill required to detect the many\r\nmistakes contained in it, which however are by no means to be charged\r\nupon the right honourable Committee, but upon the most false impudent\r\nand fraudulent representations of Wood and his accomplices. I desire one\r\nparticular may dwell upon your minds, although I have mentioned it more\r\nthan once; That after all the weight laid upon precedents there is not\r\none produced in the whole Report, of a patent for coining copper in\r\nEngland to pass in Ireland, and only two patents referred to (for indeed\r\nthere were no more) which were both passed in Ireland, by references to\r\nthe King's Council here, both less advantageous to the coiner than this\r\nof Wood, and in both securities given to receive the coin at every call,\r\nand give gold and silver in lieu of it. This demonstrates the most\r\nflagrant falsehood and impudence of Wood, by which he would endeavour to\r\nmake the right honourable Committee his instruments, (for his own\r\nillegal and exorbitant gain,) to ruin a kingdom, which hath deserved\r\nquite different treatment.\r\n\r\nI am very sensible that such a work as I have undertaken might have\r\nworthily employed a much better pen. But when a house is attempted to be\r\nrobbed it often happens that the weakest in the family runs first to\r\nstop the door. All the assistance I had were some informations from an\r\neminent person,[23] whereof I am afraid I have spoiled a few by\r\nendeavouring to make them of a piece with my own productions, and the\r\nrest I was not able to manage: I was in the case of David who could not\r\nmove in the armour of Saul, and therefore I rather chose to attack this\r\n\"uncircumcised Philistine (Wood I mean) with a sling and a stone.\" And I\r\nmay say for Wood's honour as well as my own, that he resembles Goliath\r\nin many circumstances, very applicable to the present purpose; For\r\nGoliath had \"a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a\r\ncoat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of\r\nbrass, and he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass\r\nbetween his shoulders.\" In short he was like Mr. Wood, all over brass;\r\nAnd \"he defied the armies of the living God.\" Goliath's condition of\r\ncombat were likewise the same with those of Wood. \"If he prevail against\r\nus, then shall we be his servants:\" But if it happens that I prevail\r\nover him, I renounce the other part of the condition, he shall never be\r\na servant of mine, for I do not think him fit to be trusted in any\r\nhonest man's shop.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Mr. Robert Lindsay, a Dublin lawyer, assisted Swift on the\r\nlegal points raised in the Drapier's letters. This is the Mr. Lindsay,\r\ncounsellor-at-law, to whom Swift submitted a case concerning a Mr.\r\nGorman (see Scott's edit., vol. xix., p. 294). Mr. Lindsay is supposed\r\nto be the author of two letters addressed to Chief Justice Whitshed on\r\nthe matter of his conduct towards the grand jury which discharged\r\nHarding the printer (see Scott's edit., vol. vi., p. 467). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI will conclude with my humble desire and request which I made in my\r\nsecond letter; That your lordships and worships would please to order a\r\ndeclaration to be drawn up expressing, in the strongest terms, your firm\r\nresolutions never to receive or utter any of Wood's halfpence or\r\nfarthings, and forbidding your tenants to receive them. That the said\r\ndeclaration may be signed by as many persons as possible who have\r\nestates in this kingdom, and be sent down to your several tenants\r\naforesaid.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: A Declaration, pursuant to this request, was signed soon\r\nafter by the most considerable persons of the kingdom, which was\r\nuniversally spread and of great use. [F.]\r\n\r\n\"The humble petition of the lord-mayor, sheriffs, commons, and citizens\r\nof the city of Dublin, in Common Council assembled,\" was issued as a\r\nbroadside on 8th September, 1724. See also Appendix IX. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAnd if the dread of Wood's halfpence should continue till next\r\nquarter-sessions (which I hope it will not) the gentlemen of every\r\ncounty will then have a fair opportunity of declaring against them with\r\nunanimity and zeal.\r\n\r\nI am with the greatest respect,\r\n  (May it please your lordships and worships)\r\n                  Your most dutiful\r\n                        and obedient servant,\r\n                                            M.B.\r\n\r\nAug. 25, 1724.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO THE WHOLE PEOPLE OF IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nThe country was now in a very fever of excitement. Everywhere meetings\r\nwere held for the purpose of expressing indignation against the\r\nimposition, and addresses from brewers, butchers, flying stationers, and\r\ntownspeople generally, were sent in embodying the public protest against\r\nWood and his coins. Swift fed the flame by publishing songs and ballads\r\nwell fitted for the street singers, and appealing to the understandings\r\nof those who he well knew would effectively carry his message to the\r\nvery hearths of the poorest labourers. Courtier and student, tradesman\r\nand freeman, thief and prostitute, beggar and loafer, all were alike\r\ncarried by an indignation which launched them on a maelstrom of\r\nenthusiasm. So general became the outcry that, in Coxe's words, \"the\r\nlords justices refused to issue the orders for the circulation of the\r\ncoin.... People of all descriptions and parties flocked in crowds to the\r\nbankers to demand their money, and drew their notes with an express\r\ncondition to be paid in gold and silver. The publishers of the most\r\ntreasonable pamphlets escaped with impunity, provided Wood and his\r\npatent were introduced into the work. The grand juries could scarcely be\r\ninduced to find any bill against such delinquents; no witnesses in the\r\nprosecution were safe in their persons; and no juries were inclined, or\r\nif inclined could venture, to find them guilty.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a state of public feeling Swift assumed an entirely new\r\nattitude. He promulgated his \"Letter to the Whole People of Ireland\"--a\r\nletter which openly struck at the very root of the whole evil, and laid\r\nbare to the public eye the most secret spring of its righteous\r\nindignation. It was not Wood nor his coins, it was the freedom of the\r\npeople of Ireland and their just rights and privileges that were being\r\nfought for. He wrote them the letter \"to refresh and continue that\r\nspirit so seasonably raised among\" them, and in order that they should\r\nplainly understand \"that by the laws of God, of NATURE, of NATIONS, and\r\nof your COUNTRY, you ARE, and OUGHT to be as FREE a people as your\r\nbrethren in England.\" The King's prerogative had been held threateningly\r\nover them. What was the King's prerogative? he asked in effect. It was\r\nbut the right he enjoyed within the bounds of the law as made by the\r\npeople in parliament assembled. The law limits him with his subjects.\r\nSuch prerogative he respected and would take up arms to protect against\r\nany who should rebel. But \"all government without the consent of the\r\ngoverned, is the very definition of slavery.\" The condition of the Irish\r\nnation was such that it was to be expected eleven armed men should\r\novercome a single man in his shirt; but even if those in power exercise\r\nthen power to cramp liberty, a man on the rack may still have \"the\r\nliberty of roaring as loud as he thought fit.\" And the men on the rack\r\nroared to a tune that Walpole had never before heard.\r\n\r\nThe letter appeared on the 13th October, 1724.[1] The Duke of Grafton\r\nhad been recalled and Carteret had taken up the reins of government. For\r\nreasons, either personal or politic, he took Walpole's side. Coxe goes\r\ninto considerations on this attitude of Carteret's, but they hardly\r\nconcern us here. Suffice it that the Lord Lieutenant joined forces with\r\nthe party in the Irish Privy Council, among whom were Midleton and St.\r\nJohn Brodrick, and on October 27th issued a proclamation offering a\r\nreward of £300[2] for the discovery of the author of this \"wicked and\r\nmalicious pamphlet\" which highly reflected on his Majesty and his\r\nministers, and which tended \"to alienate the affections of his good\r\nsubjects of England and Ireland from each other.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Not on October 23rd as the earlier editors print it, and as\r\nMonck Mason, Scott and Mr. Churton Collins repeat.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Appendix, No. VI.]\r\n\r\nThe author's name was not made public, nor was it likely to be. There is\r\nno doubt that it was generally known who the author was. In that general\r\nknowledge lies the whole pith of the Biblical quotation circulated\r\nabroad on the heels of the proclamation: \"And the people said unto Saul,\r\nshall _Jonathan_ die, who had wrought this great salvation in Israel?\r\nGod forbid: as the Lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall\r\nto the ground, for he hath wrought with God this day: So the people\r\nrescued _Jonathan_ that he died not.\"\r\n\r\nSwift remained very much alive. Harding, for printing the obnoxious\r\nletter, had been arrested and imprisoned, and the Crown proceeded with\r\nhis prosecution. In such circumstances Swift was not likely to remain\r\nidle. On the 26th October he addressed a letter to Lord Chancellor\r\nMidleton in defence of the Drapier's writings, and practically\r\nacknowledged himself to be the author.[3] It was not actually printed\r\nuntil 1735, but there is no doubt that Midleton received it at the time\r\nit was written. What effect it had on the ultimate issue is not known;\r\nbut Midleton's conduct justifies the confidence Swift placed in him. The\r\nGrand Jury of the Michaelmas term of 1724 sat to consider the bill\r\nagainst Harding. On the 11th of November Swift addressed to them his\r\n\"Seasonable Advice.\" The bill was thrown out. Whitshed, the Chief\r\nJustice, consistently with his action on a previous occasion (see vol.\r\nvii.), angrily remonstrated with the jury, demanded of them their\r\nreasons for such a decision, and finally dissolved them. This\r\nunconstitutional, and even disgraceful conduct, however, served but to\r\naccentuate the resentment of the people against Wood and the patent, and\r\nthe Crown fared no better by a second Grand Jury. The second jury\r\naccompanied its rejection of the bill by a presentment against the\r\npatent,[4] and the defeat of the \"prerogative\" became assured. Every\r\nwhere the Drapier was acclaimed the saviour of his country. Any person\r\nwho could scribble a doggerel or indite a tract rushed into print, and\r\nnow Whitshed was harnessed to Wood in a pillory of contemptuous\r\nridicule. Indeed, so bitter was the outcry against the Lord Chief\r\nJustice, that it is said to have hastened his death. The cities of\r\nDublin, Cork and Waterford passed resolutions declaring the uttering of\r\nWood's halfpence to be highly prejudicial to his Majesty's revenue and\r\nto the trades of the kingdom. The Drapier was now the patriot, and the\r\nwhole nation responded to his appeal to assist him in its own defence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The highly wrought up story about Swift's butler, narrated\r\nby Sheridan, Deane Swift and Scott, is nothing but a sample of\r\neighteenth century \"sensationalism.\" Swift never bothered himself about\r\nwhat his servants would say with regard to the authorship of the\r\nLetters. Certainly this letter to Midleton proves that he was not at all\r\nafraid of the consequences of discovery.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See Appendix V.]\r\n\r\nThe text of the present reprint is based on that given by Sir Walter\r\nScott, collated with the original edition and with that reprinted in\r\n\"Fraud Detected\" (1725).

A people long used to hardships, lose by\r\ndegrees the very notions of liberty, they look upon themselves as\r\ncreatures at mercy, and that all impositions laid on them by a stronger\r\nhand, are, in the phrase of the Report, legal and obligatory. Hence\r\nproceeds that poverty and lowness of spirit, to which a kingdom may be\r\nsubject as well as a particular person. And when Esau came fainting from\r\nthe field at the point to die, it is no wonder that he sold his\r\nbirthright for a mess of pottage.\r\n\r\nI thought I had sufficiently shewn to all who could want instruction, by\r\nwhat methods they might safely proceed, whenever this coin should be\r\noffered to them; and I believe there hath not been for many ages an\r\nexample of any kingdom so firmly united in a point of great importance,\r\nas this of ours is at present, against that detestable fraud. But\r\nhowever, it so happens that some weak people begin to be alarmed anew,\r\nby rumours industriously spread. Wood prescribes to the newsmongers in\r\nLondon what they are to write. In one of their papers published here by\r\nsome obscure printer (and probably with no good design) we are told,\r\nthat \"the Papists in Ireland have entered into an association against\r\nhis coin,\" although it be notoriously known, that they never once\r\noffered to stir in the matter; so that the two Houses of Parliament, the\r\nPrivy-council, the great number of corporations, the lord mayor and\r\naldermen of Dublin, the grand juries, and principal gentlemen of\r\nseveral counties are stigmatized in a lump under the name of \"Papists.\"\r\n\r\nThis impostor and his crew do likewise give out, that, by refusing to\r\nreceive his dross for sterling, we \"dispute the King's prerogative, are\r\ngrown ripe for rebellion, and ready to shake off the dependency of\r\nIreland upon the crown of England.\" To countenance which reports he hath\r\npublished a paragraph in another newspaper, to let us know that \"the\r\nLord Lieutenant is ordered to come over immediately to settle his\r\nhalfpence.\"\r\n\r\nI entreat you, my dear countrymen, not to be under the least concern\r\nupon these and the like rumours, which are no more than the last howls\r\nof a dog dissected alive, as I hope he hath sufficiently been. These\r\ncalumnies are the only reserve that is left him. For surely our\r\ncontinued and (almost) unexampled loyalty will never be called in\r\nquestion for not suffering ourselves to be robbed of all that we have,\r\nby one obscure ironmonger.\r\n\r\nAs to disputing the King's prerogative, give me leave to explain to\r\nthose who are ignorant, what the meaning of that word _prerogative_ is.\r\n\r\nThe Kings of these realms enjoy several powers, wherein the laws have\r\nnot interposed: So they can make war and peace without the consent of\r\nParliament; and this is a very great prerogative. But if the Parliament\r\ndoth not approve of the war, the King must bear the charge of it out of\r\nhis own purse, and this is as great a check on the crown. So the King\r\nhath a prerogative to coin money without consent of Parliament. But he\r\ncannot compel the subject to take that money except it be sterling, gold\r\nor silver; because herein he is limited by law. Some princes have indeed\r\nextended their prerogative further than the law allowed them; wherein\r\nhowever, the lawyers of succeeding ages, as fond as they are of\r\nprecedents, have never dared to justify them. But to say the truth, it\r\nis only of late times that prerogative hath been fixed and ascertained.\r\nFor whoever reads the histories of England, will find that some former\r\nKings, and these none of the worst, have upon several occasions ventured\r\nto control the laws with very little ceremony or scruple, even later\r\nthan the days of Queen Elizabeth. In her reign that pernicious counsel\r\nof sending base money hither, very narrowly failed of losing the\r\nkingdom, being complained of by the lord-deputy, the council, and the\r\nwhole body of the English here:[5] So that soon after her death it was\r\nrecalled by her successor, and lawful money paid in exchange.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See Moryson's \"Itinerary\" (Pt. ii., pp. 90, 196 and 262),\r\nwhere an account is given which fully bears out Swift.[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nHaving thus given you some notion of what is meant by the King's\r\n\"prerogative,\" as far as a tradesman can be thought capable of\r\nexplaining it, I will only add the opinion of the great Lord Bacon: That\r\n\"as God governs the world by the settled laws of nature, which he hath\r\nmade, and never transcends those laws but upon high important occasions;\r\nso among earthly princes, those are the wisest and the best, who govern\r\nby the known laws of the country, and seldomest make use of their\r\nprerogative.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The words in inverted commas appear to be a reminiscence\r\nrather than a quotation. I have not traced the sentence, as it stands,\r\nin Bacon; but the regular government of the world by the laws of nature,\r\nas contrasted with the exceptional disturbance of these laws, is\r\nenunciated in Bacon's \"Confession of Faith,\" while the dangers of a\r\nstrained prerogative are urged in the \"Essay on Empire.\" Bacon certainly\r\ngives no support to Swift's limits of the prerogative as regards\r\ncoinage. [CRAIK.]]\r\n\r\nNow, here you may see that the vile accusation of Wood and his\r\naccomplices, charging us with \"disputing the King's prerogative\" by\r\nrefusing his brass, can have no place, because compelling the subject to\r\ntake any coin which is not sterling is no part of the King's\r\nprerogative, and I am very confident if it were so, we should be the\r\nlast of his people to dispute it, as well from that inviolable loyalty\r\nwe have always paid to His Majesty, as from the treatment we might in\r\nsuch a case justly expect from some who seem to think, we have neither\r\ncommon sense nor common senses. But God be thanked, the best of them are\r\nonly our fellow-subjects, and not our masters. One great merit I am sure\r\nwe have, which those of English birth can have no pretence to, that our\r\nancestors reduced this kingdom to the obedience of England, for which we\r\nhave been rewarded with a worse climate, the privilege of being governed\r\nby laws to which we do not consent, a ruined trade, a House of Peers\r\nwithout jurisdiction, almost an incapacity for all employments; and the\r\ndread of Wood's halfpence.\r\n\r\nBut we are so far from disputing the King's prerogative in coining, that\r\nwe own he has power to give a patent to any man for setting his royal\r\nimage and superscription upon whatever materials he pleases, and liberty\r\nto the patentee to offer them in any country from England to Japan, only\r\nattended with one small limitation, That nobody alive is obliged to take\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nUpon these considerations I was ever against all recourse to England for\r\na remedy against the present impending evil, especially when I observed\r\nthat the addresses of both Houses, after long expectance, produced\r\nnothing but a REPORT altogether in favour of Wood, upon which I made\r\nsome observations in a former letter, and might at least have made as\r\nmany more. For it is a paper of as singular a nature as I ever beheld.\r\n\r\nBut I mistake; for before this Report was made, His Majesty's most\r\ngracious answer to the House of Lords was sent over and printed, wherein\r\nthere are these words, \"granting the patent for coining halfpence and\r\nfarthings AGREEABLE TO THE PRACTICE OF HIS ROYAL PREDECESSORS, &c.\" That\r\nKing Charles 2d. and King James 2d. (AND THEY ONLY) did grant patents\r\nfor this purpose is indisputable, and I have shewn it at large. Their\r\npatents were passed under the great seal of Ireland by references to\r\nIreland, the copper to be coined in Ireland, the patentee was bound on\r\ndemand to receive his coin back in Ireland, and pay silver and gold in\r\nreturn. Wood's patent was made under the great seal of England, the\r\nbrass coined in England, not the least reference made to Ireland, the\r\nsum immense, and the patentee under no obligation to receive it again\r\nand give good money for it: This I only mention, because in my private\r\nthoughts I have sometimes made a query, whether the penner of those\r\nwords in His Majesty's most gracious answer, \"agreeable to the practice\r\nof his royal predecessors,\" had maturely considered the several\r\ncircumstances, which, in my poor opinion seem to make a difference.\r\n\r\nLet me now say something concerning the other great cause of some\r\npeople's fear, as Wood has taught the London newswriter to express it.\r\nThat \"his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant is coming over to settle Wood's\r\nhalfpence.\"\r\n\r\nWe know very well that the Lords Lieutenants for several years past have\r\nnot thought this kingdom worthy the honour of their residence, longer\r\nthan was absolutely necessary for the King's business, which\r\nconsequently wanted no speed in the dispatch; and therefore it naturally\r\nfell into most men's thoughts, that a new governor coming at an unusual\r\ntime must portend some unusual business to be done, especially if the\r\ncommon report be true, that the Parliament prorogued to I know not when,\r\nis by a new summons (revoking that prorogation) to assemble soon after\r\nhis arrival: For which extraordinary proceeding the lawyers on t'other\r\nside the water have by great good fortune found two precedents.\r\n\r\nAll this being granted, it can never enter into my head that so little a\r\ncreature as Wood could find credit enough with the King and his\r\nministers to have the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland sent hither in a hurry\r\nupon his errand.\r\n\r\nFor let us take the whole matter nakedly as it lies before us, without\r\nthe refinements of some people, with which we have nothing to do. Here\r\nis a patent granted under the great seal of England, upon false\r\nsuggestions, to one William Wood for coining copper halfpence for\r\nIreland: The Parliament here, upon apprehensions of the worst\r\nconsequences from the said patent, address the King to have it recalled;\r\nthis is refused, and a committee of the Privy-council report to His\r\nMajesty, that Wood has performed the conditions of his patent. He then\r\nis left to do the best he can with his halfpence; no man being obliged\r\nto receive them; the people here, being likewise left to themselves,\r\nunite as one man, resolving they will have nothing to do with his ware.\r\nBy this plain account of the fact it is manifest, that the King and his\r\nministry are wholly out of the case, and the matter is left to be\r\ndisputed between him and us. Will any man therefore attempt to persuade\r\nme, that a Lord Lieutenant is to be dispatched over in great haste\r\nbefore the ordinary time, and a Parliament summoned by anticipating a\r\nprorogation, merely to put an hundred thousand pounds into the pocket of\r\na sharper, by the ruin of a most loyal kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut supposing all this to be true. By what arguments could a Lord\r\nLieutenant prevail on the same Parliament which addressed with so much\r\nzeal and earnestness against this evil, to pass it into a law? I am sure\r\ntheir opinion of Wood and his project is not mended since the last\r\nprorogation; and supposing those methods should be used which detractors\r\ntell us have been sometimes put in practice for gaining votes. It is\r\nwell known that in this kingdom there are few employments to be given,\r\nand if there were more, it is as well known to whose share they must\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nBut because great numbers of you are altogether ignorant in the affairs\r\nof your country, I will tell you some reasons why there are so few\r\nemployments to be disposed of in this kingdom. All considerable offices\r\nfor life here are possessed by those to whom the reversions were\r\ngranted, and these have been generally followers of the chief governors,\r\nor persons who had interest in the Court of England. So the Lord\r\nBerkeley of Stratton[7] holds that great office of master of the rolls,\r\nthe Lord Palmerstown[8] is first remembrancer worth near 2000_l. per\r\nann._ One Dodington[9] secretary to the Earl of Pembroke,[10] begged the\r\nreversion of clerk of the pells worth 2500_l._ a year, which he now\r\nenjoys by the death of the Lord Newtown. Mr. Southwell is secretary of\r\nstate,[11] and the Earl of Burlington[12] lord high treasurer of Ireland\r\nby inheritance. These are only a few among many others which I have been\r\ntold of, but cannot remember. Nay the reversion of several employments\r\nduring pleasure are granted the same way. This among many others is a\r\ncircumstance whereby the kingdom of Ireland is distinguished from all\r\nother nations upon earth, and makes it so difficult an affair to get\r\ninto a civil employ, that Mr. Addison was forced to purchase an old\r\nobscure place, called keeper of the records of Bermingham's Tower of ten\r\npounds a year, and to get a salary of 400_l._ annexed to it,[13] though\r\nall the records there are not worth half-a-crown, either for curiosity\r\nor use. And we lately saw a favourite secretary descend to be master of\r\nthe revels, which by his credit and extortion he hath made pretty\r\nconsiderable.[14] I say nothing of the under-treasurership worth about\r\n8000_l_. a year, nor the commissioners of the revenue, four of whom\r\ngenerally live in England; For I think none of these are granted in\r\nreversion. But the test is, that I have known upon occasion some of\r\nthese absent officers as keen against the interest of Ireland as if they\r\nhad never been indebted to her for a single groat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Berkeley was one of the Junta in Harley's administration of\r\n1710-1714.

His connection\r\nwith a person so disliked by Swift may account for his inclusion here.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This was Henry Temple, first Viscount Palmerston, with whom\r\nSwift later had an unpleasant correspondence. Palmerston could not have\r\nbeen more than seven years old when he was appointed (September 21st,\r\n1680), with Luke King, chief remembrancer of the Court of Exchequer in\r\nIreland, for their joint lives. King died in 1716, but the grant was\r\nrenewed to Palmerston and his son Henry for life. He was raised to the\r\npeerage as Baron Temple of Mount Temple, and Viscount Palmerston of\r\nPalmerston, in March, 1722-1723.

In June, 1720, Edward Southwell had his salary\r\nas secretary increased by £300; and in July of the same year the office\r\nwas granted to him and his son for life.

The\r\nLord-lieutenancy of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and the office of\r\nCustos Rotulorum of the North and West Ridings, seem also to have been\r\ninheritances of this family. The third Earl had a taste for\r\narchitecture, and spent enormous sums of money in the reconstruction of\r\nBurlington House, a building that was freely satirized by Hogarth and\r\nLord Hervey. His taste, however, seems to have run to the ornamental\r\nrather than the useful, and its gratification involved him in such\r\nserious financial difficulties, that he was compelled to sell some of\r\nhis Irish estates. Swift notes that \"My Lord Burlington is now selling\r\nin one article £9,000 a year in Ireland for £200,000 which must pay his\r\ndebts\" (Scott's edit. 1814, vol. xix., p. 129).

The\r\nexactions made by this gentleman upon the players, in his capacity of\r\nMaster of the Revels, are the subject of two satirical poems. [S.]\r\n\r\nThis may have been John Hopkins, the second son of the Bishop of\r\nLondonderry, who was the author of \"Amasia,\" dedicated to the Duchess of\r\nGrafton. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI confess, I have been sometimes tempted to wish that this project of\r\nWood might succeed, because I reflected with some pleasure what a jolly\r\ncrew it would bring over among us of lords and squires, and pensioners\r\nof both sexes, and officers civil and military, where we should live\r\ntogether as merry and sociable as beggars, only with this one abatement,\r\nthat we should neither have meat to feed, nor manufactures to clothe us,\r\nunless we could be content to prance about in coats of mail, or eat\r\nbrass as ostriches do iron.\r\n\r\nI return from this digression to that which gave me the occasion of\r\nmaking it: And I believe you are now convinced, that if the Parliament\r\nof Ireland were as temptable as any other assembly within a mile of\r\nChristendom (which God forbid) yet the managers must of necessity fail\r\nfor want of tools to work with. But I will yet go one step further, by\r\nsupposing that a hundred new employments were erected on purpose to\r\ngratify compilers; yet still an insuperable difficulty would remain; for\r\nit happens, I know not how, that money is neither Whig nor Tory, neither\r\nof town nor country party, and it is not improbable, that a gentleman\r\nwould rather choose to live upon his own estate which brings him gold\r\nand silver, than with the addition of an employment, when his rents and\r\nsalary must both be paid in Wood's brass, at above eighty _per cent._\r\ndiscount.\r\n\r\nFor these and many other reasons, I am confident you need not be under\r\nthe least apprehensions from the sudden expectation of the Lord\r\nLieutenant,[15] while we continue in our present hearty disposition; to\r\nalter which there is no suitable temptation can possibly be offered:\r\nAnd if, as I have often asserted from the best authority, the law hath\r\nnot left a power in the crown to force any money except sterling upon\r\nthe subject, much less can the crown devolve such a power upon another.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Lord Carteret, afterwards Earl Granville. See note to \"A\r\nVindication of Lord Carteret,\" in vol. vii. of present edition of\r\nSwift's works. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThis I speak with the utmost respect to the person and dignity of his\r\nExcellency the Lord Carteret, whose character hath been given me by a\r\ngentleman that hath known him from his first appearance in the world:\r\nThat gentleman describes him as a young nobleman of great\r\naccomplishments, excellent learning, regular in his life, and of much\r\nspirit and vivacity. He hath since, as I have heard, been employed\r\nabroad, was principal secretary of state, and is now about the 37th year\r\nof his age appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. From such a governor\r\nthis kingdom may reasonably hope for as much prosperity as, under so\r\nmany discouragements, it can be capable of receiving.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Carteret was an old friend of Swift. On the Earl's\r\nappointment to the Lord-lieutenancy, in April, 1724, Swift wrote him a\r\nletter on the matter of Wood's halfpence, in which he took the liberty\r\nof \"an old humble servant, and one who always loved and esteemed\" him,\r\nto make known to him the apprehensions the people were under concerning\r\nMr. Wood's patent. \"Neither is it doubted,\" he wrote, \"that when your\r\nexcellency shall be thoroughly informed, your justice and compassion for\r\nan injured people, will force you to employ your credit for their\r\nrelief.\" Swift waited for more than a month, and on receiving no reply,\r\nsent a second letter, which Sir Henry Craik justly calls, \"a masterpiece\r\nof its kind.\" It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"June 9, 1724.\r\n\r\n\"MY LORD,\r\n\r\n\"It is above a month since I took the boldness of writing to your\r\nexcellency, upon a subject wherein the welfare of this kingdom is highly\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\"I writ at the desire of several considerable persons here, who could\r\nnot be ignorant that I had the honour of being well known to you.\r\n\r\n\"I could have wished your excellency had condescended so far, as to let\r\none of your under clerks have signified to me that a letter was\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\"I have been long out of the world; but have not forgotten what used to\r\npass among those I lived with while I was in it: and I can say, that\r\nduring the experience of many years, and many changes in affairs, your\r\nexcellency, and one more, who is not worthy to be compared to you, are\r\nthe only great persons that ever refused to answer a letter from me,\r\nwithout regard to business, party, or greatness; and if I had not a\r\npeculiar esteem for your personal qualities, I should think myself to be\r\nacting a very inferior part in making this complaint.\r\n\r\n\"I never was so humble, as to be vain upon my acquaintance with men in\r\npower, and always rather chose to avoid it when I was not called.\r\nNeither were their power or titles sufficient, without merit, to make me\r\ncultivate them; of which I have witnesses enough left, after all the\r\nhavoc made among them, by accidents of time, or by changes of persons,\r\nmeasures, and opinions.\r\n\r\n\"I know not how your conception of yourself may alter, by every new high\r\nstation; but mine must continue the same, or alter for the worse.\r\n\r\n\"I often told a great minister, whom you well know, that I valued him\r\nfor being the same man through all the progress of power and place. I\r\nexpected the like in your lordship; and still hope that I shall be the\r\nonly person who will ever find it otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"I pray God to direct your excellency in all your good undertakings, and\r\nespecially in your government of this kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"I shall trouble you no more; but remain, with great respect, my Lord,\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency's most obedient,\r\n\r\n\"and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n\"JON. SWIFT.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter brought an immediate reply from Carteret, who confessed\r\nhimself in the wrong for his silence, and trusted he had not forfeited\r\nSwift's friendship by it. With regard to Mr. Wood's patent, he said that\r\nthe matter was under examination, \"and till that is over I am not\r\ninformed sufficiently to make any other judgment of the matter, than\r\nthat which I am naturally led to make, by the general aversion which\r\nappears to it in the whole nation.\" Swift replied in a charming vein,\r\nand elegantly put his scolding down to the testiness of old age. His\r\nexcellency had humbled him. \"Therefore, I fortel that you, who could so\r\neasily conquer so captious a person, and of so little consequence, will\r\nquickly subdue this whole kingdom to love and reverence you\" (Scott's\r\ned. 1824, vol. xvi., pp. 430-435). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nIt is true indeed, that within the memory of man, there have been\r\ngovernors of so much dexterity, as to carry points of terrible\r\nconsequence to this kingdom, by their power with _those who were in\r\noffice_, and by their arts in managing or deluding others with oaths,\r\naffability, and even with dinners. If Wood's brass had in those times\r\nbeen upon the anvil, it is obvious enough to conceive what methods would\r\nhave been taken. Depending persons would have been told in plain terms,\r\nthat it was a \"service expected from them, under pain of the public\r\nbusiness being put into more complying hands.\" Others would be allured\r\nby promises. To the country gentleman, besides good words, burgundy and\r\ncloseting. It would perhaps have been hinted how \"kindly it would be\r\ntaken to comply with a royal patent, though it were not compulsory,\"\r\nthat if any inconveniences ensued, it might be made up with other\r\n\"graces or favours hereafter.\" That \"gentlemen ought to consider whether\r\nit were prudent or safe to disgust England:\" They would be desired to\r\n\"think of some good bills for encouraging of trade, and setting the poor\r\nto work, some further acts against Popery and for uniting Protestants.\"\r\nThere would be solemn engagements that we should \"never be troubled with\r\nabove forty thousand pounds in his coin, and all of the best and\r\nweightiest sort, for which we should only give our manufactures in\r\nexchange, and keep our gold and silver at home.\" Perhaps a \"seasonable\r\nreport of some invasion would have been spread in the most proper\r\njuncture,\" which is a great smoother of rubs in public proceedings; and\r\nwe should have been told that \"this was no time to create differences\r\nwhen the kingdom was in danger.\"\r\n\r\nThese, I say, and the like methods would in corrupt times have been\r\ntaken to let in this deluge of brass among us; and I am confident would\r\neven then have not succeeded, much less under the administration of so\r\nexcellent a person as the Lord Carteret, and in a country where the\r\npeople of all ranks, parties and denominations are convinced to a man,\r\nthat the utter undoing of themselves and their posterity for ever will\r\nbe dated from the admission of that execrable coin; that if it once\r\nenters, it can be no more confined to a small or moderate quantity, than\r\nthe plague can be confined to a few families, and that no equivalent can\r\nbe given by any earthly power, any more than a dead carcass can be\r\nrecovered to life by a cordial.\r\n\r\nThere is one comfortable circumstance in this universal opposition to\r\nMr. Wood, that the people sent over hither from England to fill up our\r\nvacancies ecclesiastical, civil and military, are all on our side:\r\nMoney, the great divider of the world, hath by a strange revolution,\r\nbeen the great uniter of a most divided people. Who would leave a\r\nhundred pounds a year in England (a country of freedom) to be paid a\r\nthousand in Ireland out of Wood's exchequer. The gentleman they have\r\nlately made primate[17] would never quit his seat in an English House of\r\nLords, and his preferments at Oxford and Bristol, worth twelve hundred\r\npounds a year, for four times the denomination here, but not half the\r\nvalue; therefore I expect to hear he will be as good an Irishman, upon\r\nthis article, as any of his brethren, or even of us who have had the\r\nmisfortune to be born in this island. For those, who, in the common\r\nphrase, do not \"come hither to learn the language,\" would never change a\r\nbetter country for a worse, to receive brass instead of gold.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Hugh Boulter (1672-1742) was appointed Archbishop of\r\nArmagh, August 31st, 1724. He had been a fellow of Magdalen College,\r\nOxford, and had served the King as chaplain in Hanover, in 1719. In this\r\nlatter year he was promoted to the Bishopric of Bristol, and the Deanery\r\nof Christ Church, Oxford. His appointment as Primate of Ireland, was in\r\naccordance with Walpole's plan for governing Ireland from England.\r\nWalpole had no love for Carteret, and no faith in his power or\r\nwillingness to aid him in his policy. Indeed, Carteret was sent to\r\nIreland to be got out of the way. He was governor nominally; the real\r\ngovernor being Walpole in the person of the new Primate. What were\r\nBoulter's instructions may be gathered from the manner in which he\r\ncarried out his purpose. Of a strong character and of untiring energy,\r\nBoulter set about his work in a fashion which showed that Walpole had\r\nchosen well. Nothing of any importance that transpired in Ireland, no\r\nfact of any interest about the individuals in office, no movement of any\r\nsuspected or suspicious person escaped his vigilance. His letters\r\ntestify to an unabating zeal for the English government of Irish affairs\r\nby Englishmen in the English interest. His perseverance knew no\r\nobstacles; he continued against all difficulties in his dogged and yet\r\nable manner to establish some order out of the chaos of Ireland's\r\ncondition. But his government was the outcome of a profound conviction\r\nthat only in the interest of England should Ireland be governed. If\r\nIreland could be made prosperous and contented, so much more good would\r\naccrue to England. But that prosperity and that contentment had nothing\r\nwhatever to do with safeguarding Irish institutions, or recognizing the\r\nrights of the Irish people. If he gave way to popular opinion at all, it\r\nwas because it was either expedient or beneficial to the English\r\ninterest. If he urged, as he did, the founding of Protestant Charter\r\nschools, it was because this would strengthen the English power. To\r\npreserve that he obtained the enactment of a statute which excluded\r\nRoman Catholics from the legal profession and the offices of legal\r\nadministration; and another act of his making actually disfranchised\r\nthem altogether. Boulter was also a member of the Irish Privy Council,\r\nand Lord Justice of Ireland. The latter office he held under the\r\nvice-regencies of Carteret, Dorset and Devonshire. His secretary,\r\nAmbrose Philips, had been connected with him, in earlier years, in\r\ncontributing to a periodical entitled, \"The Free Thinker,\" which\r\nappeared in 1718. Philips, in 1769, supervised the publication of\r\nBoulter's \"Letters,\" which were published at Oxford. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAnother slander spread by Wood and his emissaries is, that by opposing\r\nhim we discover an inclination to \"shake off our dependence upon the\r\ncrown of England.\" Pray observe how important a person is this same\r\nWilliam Wood, and how the public weal of two kingdoms is involved in\r\nhis private interest. First, all those who refuse to take his coin are\r\nPapists; for he tells us that \"none but Papists are associated against\r\nhim;\" Secondly, they \"dispute the King's prerogative;\" Thirdly, \"they\r\nare ripe for rebellion,\" and Fourthly, they are going to \"shake off\r\ntheir dependence upon the crown of England;\" That is to say, \"they are\r\ngoing to choose another king;\" For there can be no other meaning in this\r\nexpression, however some may pretend to strain it.\r\n\r\nAnd this gives me an opportunity of explaining, to those who are\r\nignorant, another point, which hath often swelled in my breast. Those\r\nwho come over hither to us from England, and some weak people among\r\nourselves, whenever in discourse we make mention of liberty and\r\nproperty, shake their heads, and tell us, that Ireland is a \"depending\r\nkingdom,\" as if they would seem, by this phrase, to intend that the\r\npeople of Ireland is in some state of slavery or dependence different\r\nfrom those of England; Whereas a \"depending kingdom\" is a modern term of\r\nart, unknown, as I have heard, to all ancient civilians, and writers\r\nupon government; and Ireland is on the contrary called in some statutes\r\nan \"imperial crown,\" as held only from God; which is as high a style as\r\nany kingdom is capable of receiving. Therefore by this expression, a\r\n\"depending kingdom,\" there is no more understood than that by a statute\r\nmade here in the 33d year of Henry 8th. \"The King and his successors are\r\nto be kings imperial of this realm as united and knit to the imperial\r\ncrown of England.\" I have looked over all the English and Irish statutes\r\nwithout finding any law that makes Ireland depend upon England, any more\r\nthan England does upon Ireland. We have indeed obliged ourselves to have\r\nthe same king with them, and consequently they are obliged to have the\r\nsame king with us. For the law was made by our own Parliament, and our\r\nancestors then were not such fools (whatever they were in the preceding\r\nreign) to bring themselves under I know not what dependence, which is\r\nnow talked of without any ground of law, reason or common sense.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: This was the passage selected by the government upon which\r\nto found its prosecution. As Sir Walter Scott points out, it \"contains\r\nthe pith and essence of the whole controversy.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nLet whoever think otherwise, I M.B. Drapier, desire to be excepted,[19]\r\nfor I declare, next under God, I _depend_ only on the King my sovereign,\r\nand on the laws of my own country; and I am so far from _depending_ upon\r\nthe people of England, that if they should ever rebel against my\r\nsovereign (which God forbid) I would be ready at the first command from\r\nHis Majesty to take arms against them, as some of _my_ countrymen did\r\nagainst _theirs_ at Preston. And if such a rebellion should prove so\r\nsuccessful as to fix the Pretender on the throne of England, I would\r\nventure to transgress that statute so far as to lose every drop of my\r\nblood to hinder him from being King of Ireland.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: For a humorous story which accounts for Swift's use of the\r\nwords \"desire to be excepted,\" see the Drapier's sixth letter. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Great offence was taken at this paragraph. Swift refers to\r\nit again in his sixth letter. Sir Henry Craik, in his \"Life of Jonathan\r\nSwift\" (vol. ii., p. 74), has an acute note on this paragraph, and the\r\none already alluded to in the sixth letter. I take the liberty of\r\ntranscribing it: \"The manoeuvre by which Swift managed to associate a\r\nsuspicion of Jacobitism with his opponents, is one peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic; and so is the skill with which, in the next letter, he\r\nmeets the objections to this paragraph, by half offering an extent of\r\nsubmission that might equally be embarrassing--a submission even to\r\nJacobitism, if Jacobitism were to become strong enough. He does not\r\ncommit himself, however: he fears a 'spiteful interpretation.' In short,\r\nhe places the English Cabinet on the horns of a dilemma. 'Am I to resist\r\nJacobitism? Then what becomes of your doctrine of Ireland's dependency?'\r\nor, 'Am I to become a Jacobite, if England bids me? Then what becomes of\r\nyour Protestant succession? Must even that give way to your desire to\r\ntyrannize?'\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n'Tis true indeed, that within the memory of man, the Parliaments of\r\nEngland have sometimes assumed the power of binding this kingdom by laws\r\nenacted there,[21] wherein they were at first openly opposed (as far as\r\ntruth, reason and justice are capable of opposing) by the famous Mr.\r\nMolineux,[22] an English gentleman born here, as well as by several of\r\nthe greatest patriots, and best Whigs in England; but the love and\r\ntorrent of power prevailed. Indeed the arguments on both sides were\r\ninvincible. For in reason, all government without the consent of the\r\ngoverned is the very definition of slavery: But in fact, eleven men well\r\narmed will certainly subdue one single man in his shirt. But I have\r\ndone. For those who have used power to cramp liberty have gone so far as\r\nto resent even the liberty of complaining, although a man upon the rack\r\nwas never known to be refused the liberty of roaring as loud as he\r\nthought fit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Particularly in the reign of William III., when this\r\ndoctrine of English supremacy was assumed, in order to discredit the\r\nauthority of the Irish Parliament summoned by James II. [S.]\r\n\r\nSee note on Poyning's Law, p. 77. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: See note on p. 167. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAnd as we are apt to sink too much under unreasonable fears, so we are\r\ntoo soon inclined to be raised by groundless hopes (according to the\r\nnature of all consumptive bodies like ours) thus, it hath been given\r\nabout for several days past, that somebody in England empowered a second\r\nsomebody to write to a third somebody here to assure us, that we \"should\r\nno more be troubled with those halfpence.\" And this is reported to have\r\nbeen done by the same person, who was said to have sworn some months\r\nago, that he would \"ram them down our throats\" (though I doubt they\r\nwould stick in our stomachs) but whichever of these reports is true or\r\nfalse, it is no concern of ours. For in this point we have nothing to do\r\nwith English ministers, and I should be sorry it lay in their power to\r\nredress this grievance or to enforce it: For the \"Report of the\r\nCommittee\" hath given me a surfeit. The remedy is wholly in your own\r\nhands, and therefore I have digressed a little in order to refresh and\r\ncontinue that spirit so seasonably raised amongst you, and to let you\r\nsee that by the laws of GOD, of NATURE, of NATIONS, and of your own\r\nCOUNTRY, you ARE and OUGHT to be as FREE a people as your brethren in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIf the pamphlets published at London by Wood and his journeymen in\r\ndefence of his cause, were reprinted here, and that our countrymen could\r\nbe persuaded to read them, they would convince you of his wicked design\r\nmore than all I shall ever be able to say. In short I make him a perfect\r\nsaint in comparison of what he appears to be from the writings of those\r\nwhom he hires to justify his project. But he is so far master of the\r\nfield (let others guess the reason) that no London printer dare publish\r\nany paper written in favour of Ireland, and here nobody hath yet been so\r\nbold as to publish anything in favour of him.\r\n\r\nThere was a few days ago a pamphlet sent me of near 50 pages written in\r\nfavour of Mr. Wood and his coinage, printed in London; it is not worth\r\nanswering, because probably it will never be published here: But it gave\r\nme an occasion to reflect upon an unhappiness we lie under, that the\r\npeople of England are utterly ignorant of our case, which however is no\r\nwonder, since it is a point they do not in the least concern themselves\r\nabout, farther than perhaps as a subject of discourse in a coffee-house\r\nwhen they have nothing else to talk of. For I have reason to believe\r\nthat no minister ever gave himself the trouble of reading any papers\r\nwritten in our defence, because I suppose their opinions are already\r\ndetermined, and are formed wholly upon the reports of Wood and his\r\naccomplices; else it would be impossible that any man could have the\r\nimpudence to write such a pamphlet as I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nOur neighbours whose understandings are just upon a level with ours\r\n(which perhaps are none of the brightest) have a strong contempt for\r\nmost nations, but especially for Ireland: They look upon us as a sort of\r\nsavage Irish, whom our ancestors conquered several hundred years ago,\r\nand if I should describe the Britons to you as they were in Caesar's\r\ntime, when they painted their bodies, or clothed themselves with the\r\nskins of beasts, I would act full as reasonably as they do: However they\r\nare so far to be excused in relation to the present subject, that,\r\nhearing only one side of the cause, and having neither opportunity nor\r\ncuriosity to examine the other, they believe a lie merely for their\r\nease, and conclude, because Mr. Wood pretends to have power, he hath\r\nalso reason on his side.\r\n\r\nTherefore to let you see how this case is represented in England by Wood\r\nand his adherents, I have thought it proper to extract out of that\r\npamphlet a few of those notorious falsehoods in point of fact and\r\nreasoning contained therein; the knowledge whereof will confirm my\r\ncountrymen in their own right sentiments, when they will see by\r\ncomparing both, how much their enemies are in the wrong.\r\n\r\nFirst, The writer, positively asserts, \"That Wood's halfpence were\r\ncurrent among us for several months with the universal approbation of\r\nall people, without one single gainsayer, and we all to a man thought\r\nourselves happy in having them.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, He affirms, \"That we were drawn into a dislike of them only by\r\nsome cunning evil-designing men among us, who opposed this patent of\r\nWood to get another for themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThirdly, That \"those who most declared at first against Wood's patent\r\nwere the very men who intended to get another for their own advantage.\"\r\n\r\nFourthly, That \"our Parliament and Privy-council, the Lord Mayor and\r\naldermen of Dublin, the grand juries and merchants, and in short the\r\nwhole kingdom, nay the very dogs\" (as he expresseth it) \"were fond of\r\nthose halfpence, till they were inflamed by those few designing persons\r\naforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nFifthly, He says directly, That \"all those who opposed the halfpence\r\nwere Papists and enemies to King George.\"\r\n\r\nThus far I am confident the most ignorant among you can safely swear\r\nfrom your own knowledge that the author is a most notorious liar in\r\nevery article; the direct contrary being so manifest to the whole\r\nkingdom, that if occasion required, we might get it confirmed under five\r\nhundred thousand hands.\r\n\r\nSixthly, He would persuade us, that \"if we sell five shillings worth of\r\nour goods or manufactures for two shillings and fourpence worth of\r\ncopper, although the copper were melted down, and that we could get five\r\nshillings in gold or silver for the said goods, yet to take the said two\r\nshillings and fourpence in copper would be greatly for our advantage.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lastly, He makes us a very fair offer, as empowered by Wood, that\r\n\"if we will take off two hundred thousand pounds in his halfpence for\r\nour goods, and likewise pay him three _per cent_. interest for thirty\r\nyears, for an hundred and twenty thousand pounds (at which he computes\r\nthe coinage above the intrinsic value of the copper) for the loan of his\r\ncoin, he, will after that time give us good money for what halfpence\r\nwill be then left.\"\r\n\r\nLet me place this offer in as clear a light as I can to shew the\r\nunsupportable villainy and impudence of that incorrigible wretch. First\r\n(says he) \"I will send two hundred thousand pounds of my coin into your\r\ncountry, the copper I compute to be in real value eighty thousand\r\npounds, and I charge you with an hundred and twenty thousand pounds for\r\nthe coinage; so that you see I lend you an hundred and twenty thousand\r\npounds for thirty years, for which you shall pay me three _per cent_.\r\nThat is to say three thousand six hundred pounds _per ann_. which in\r\nthirty years will amount to an hundred and eight thousand pounds. And\r\nwhen these thirty years are expired, return me my copper and I will give\r\nyou good money for it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the proposal made to us by Wood in that pamphlet written by one\r\nof his commissioners; and the author is supposed to be the same infamous\r\nColeby one of his under-swearers at the committee of council, who was\r\ntried for robbing the treasury here, where he was an under-clerk.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: See note on p. 61. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBy this proposal he will first receive two hundred thousand pounds, in\r\ngoods or sterling for as much copper as he values at eighty thousand\r\npounds, but in reality not worth thirty thousand pounds. Secondly, He\r\nwill receive for interest an hundred and eight thousand pounds. And when\r\nour children came thirty years hence to return his halfpence upon his\r\nexecutors (for before that time he will be probably gone to his own\r\nplace) those executors will very reasonably reject them as raps and\r\ncounterfeits, which probably they will be, and millions of them of his\r\nown coinage.\r\n\r\nMethinks I am fond of such a dealer as this who mends every day upon our\r\nhands, like a Dutch reckoning, where if you dispute the unreasonableness\r\nand exorbitance of the bill, the landlord shall bring it up every time\r\nwith new additions.\r\n\r\nAlthough these and the like pamphlets published by Wood in London be\r\naltogether unknown here, where nobody could read them without as much\r\nindignation as contempt would allow, yet I thought it proper to give you\r\na specimen how the man employs his time, where he rides alone without\r\none creature to contradict him, while our FEW FRIENDS there wonder at\r\nour silence, and the English in general, if they think of this matter at\r\nall, impute our refusal to wilfulness or disaffection, just as Wood and\r\nhis hirelings are pleased to represent.\r\n\r\nBut although our arguments are not suffered to be printed in England,\r\nyet the consequence will be of little moment. Let Wood endeavour to\r\npersuade the people there that we ought to receive his coin, and let me\r\nconvince our people here that they ought to reject it under pain of our\r\nutter undoing. And then let him do his best and his worst.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude, I must beg leave in all humility to tell Mr. Wood,\r\nthat he is guilty of great indiscretion, by causing so honourable a name\r\nas that of Mr. Walpole to be mentioned so often, and in such a manner,\r\nupon his occasion: A short paper printed at Bristol and reprinted here\r\nreports Mr. Wood to say, that he \"wonders at the impudence and insolence\r\nof the Irish in refusing his coin, and what he will do when Mr. Walpole\r\ncomes to town.\" Where, by the way, he is mistaken, for it is the true\r\nEnglish people of Ireland who refuse it, although we take it for granted\r\nthat the Irish will do so too whenever they are asked. He orders it to\r\nbe printed in another paper, that \"Mr. Walpole will cram this brass down\r\nour throats:\" Sometimes it is given out that we must \"either take these\r\nhalfpence or eat our brogues,\" And, in another newsletter but of\r\nyesterday, we read that the same great man \"hath sworn to make us\r\nswallow his coin in fire-balls.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings to my mind the known story of a Scotchman, who receiving\r\nsentence of death, with all the circumstances of hanging, beheading,\r\nquartering, embowelling and the like, cried out, \"What need all this\r\nCOOKERY?\" And I think we have reason to ask the same question; for if we\r\nbelieve Wood, here is a dinner getting ready for us, and you see the\r\nbill of fare, and I am sorry the drink was forgot, which might easily be\r\nsupplied with melted lead and flaming pitch.\r\n\r\nWhat vile words are these to put into the mouth of a great councillor,\r\nin high trust with His Majesty, and looked upon as a prime-minister. If\r\nMr. Wood hath no better a manner of representing his patrons, when I\r\ncome to be a great man, he shall never be suffered to attend at my\r\nlevee. This is not the style of a great minister, it savours too much of\r\nthe kettle and the furnace, and came entirely out of Mr. Wood's forge.\r\n\r\nAs for the threat of making us eat our brogues, we need not be in pain;\r\nfor if his coin should pass, that unpolite covering for the feet, would\r\nno longer be a national reproach; because then we should have neither\r\nshoe nor brogue left in the kingdom. But here the falsehood of Mr. Wood\r\nis fairly detected; for I am confident Mr. Walpole never heard of a\r\nbrogue in his whole life.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: A biting sneer at Walpole's ignorance of Irish affairs.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAs to \"swallowing these halfpence in fire-balls,\" it is a story equally\r\nimprobable. For to execute this operation the whole stock of Mr. Wood's\r\ncoin and metal must be melted down and moulded into hollow balls with\r\nwild-fire, no bigger than a reasonable throat can be able to swallow.\r\nNow the metal he hath prepared, and already coined will amount at least\r\nfifty millions of halfpence to be swallowed by a million and a half of\r\npeople; so that allowing two halfpence to each ball, there will be about\r\nseventeen balls of wild-fire a-piece to be swallowed by every person in\r\nthis kingdom, and to administer this dose, there cannot be conveniently\r\nfewer than fifty thousand operators, allowing one operator to every\r\nthirty, which, considering the squeamishness of some stomachs and the\r\npeevishness of young children, is but reasonable. Now, under correction\r\nof better judgments, I think the trouble and charge of such an\r\nexperiment would exceed the profit, and therefore I take this report to\r\nbe spurious, or at least only a new scheme of Mr. Wood himself, which to\r\nmake it pass the better in Ireland he would father upon a minister of\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nBut I will now demonstrate beyond all contradiction that Mr. Walpole is\r\nagainst this project of Mr. Wood, and is an entire friend to Ireland,\r\nonly by this one invincible argument, that he has the universal opinion\r\nof being a wise man, an able minister, and in all his proceedings\r\npursuing the true interest of the King his master: And that as his\r\nintegrity is above all corruption, so is his fortune above all\r\ntemptation. I reckon therefore we are perfectly safe from that corner,\r\nand shall never be under the necessity of contending with so formidable\r\na power, but be left to possess our brogues and potatoes in peace as\r\nremote from thunder as we are from Jupiter.\r\n\r\nI am,\r\n   My dear countrymen,\r\n     Your loving fellow-subject,\r\n       fellow-sufferer and humble servant.\r\n                                         M.B.\r\n\r\nOct. 13. 1724.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONABLE ADVICE TO THE GRAND JURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONABLE ADVICE TO THE GRAND JURY,\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE BILL PREPARING AGAINST THE PRINTER OF THE DRAPIER'S\r\nFOURTH LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince a bill is preparing for the grand jury, to find against the\r\nprinter of the Drapier's last letter, there are several things maturely\r\nto be considered by those gentlemen, before whom this bill is to come,\r\nbefore they determine upon it.\r\n\r\nFIRST, they are to consider, that the author of the said pamphlet, did\r\nwrite three other discourses on the same subject; which instead of being\r\ncensured were universally approved by the whole nation, and were allowed\r\nto have raised, and continued that spirit among us, which hitherto hath\r\nkept out Wood's coin: For all men will allow, that if those pamphlets\r\nhad not been writ, his coin must have overrun the nation some months\r\nago.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY, it is to be considered that this pamphlet, against which a\r\nproclamation hath been issued, is writ by the same author; that nobody\r\never doubted the innocence, and goodness of his design, that he appears\r\nthrough the whole tenor of it, to be a loyal subject to His Majesty, and\r\ndevoted to the House of Hanover, and declares himself in a manner\r\npeculiarly zealous against the Pretender; And if such a writer in four\r\nseveral treatises on so nice a subject, where a royal patent is\r\nconcerned, and where it was necessary to speak of England and of\r\nliberty, should in one or two places happen to let fall an inadvertent\r\nexpression, it would be hard to condemn him after all the good he hath\r\ndone; Especially when we consider, that he could have no possible\r\ndesign in view, either of honour or profit, but purely the GOOD of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY, it ought to be well considered, whether any one expression in\r\nthe said pamphlet, be really liable to just exception, much less to be\r\nfound \"wicked, malicious, seditious, reflecting upon His Majesty and his\r\nministry,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe two points in that pamphlet, which it is said the prosecutors intend\r\nchiefly to fix on, are, First, where the author mentions the \"penner of\r\nthe King's answer.\" First, it is well known, His Majesty is not master\r\nof the English tongue, and therefore it is necessary that some other\r\nperson should be employed to pen what he hath to say, or write in that\r\nlanguage. Secondly, His Majesty's answer is not in the first person, but\r\nthe third. It is not said \"WE are concerned,\" or, \"OUR royal\r\npredecessors,\" but \"HIS MAJESTY is concerned;\" and \"HIS royal\r\npredecessors.\" By which it is plain these are properly not the words of\r\nHis Majesty; but supposed to be taken from him, and transmitted hither\r\nby one of his ministers. Thirdly it will be easily seen, that the author\r\nof the pamphlet delivers his sentiments upon this particular, with the\r\nutmost caution and respect, as any impartial reader will observe.\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph, which it is said will be taken notice of as a\r\nmotive to find the bill, is, what the author says of Ireland being a\r\ndepending kingdom. He explains all the dependency he knows of it, which\r\nis a law made in Ireland, whereby it is enacted that \"whoever is King of\r\nEngland, shall be King of Ireland.\" Before this explanation be\r\ncondemned, and the bill found upon it, it would be proper, that some\r\nlawyers should fully inform the jury what other law there is, either\r\nstatute or common for this dependency, and if there be no law, there is\r\nno transgression.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth thing very maturely to be considered by the jury, is, what\r\ninfluence their finding the bill may have upon the kingdom. The people\r\nin general find no fault in the Drapier's last book, any more than in\r\nthe three former, and therefore when they hear it is condemned by a\r\ngrand jury of Dublin, they will conclude it is done in favour of Wood's\r\ncoin, they will think we of this town have changed our minds, and intend\r\nto take those halfpence, and therefore that it will be in vain for them\r\nto stand out. So that the question comes to this, Which will be of the\r\nworst consequence, to let pass one or two expressions, at the worst only\r\nunwary, in a book written for the public service; or to leave a free\r\nopen passage for Wood's brass to overrun us, by which we shall be undone\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nThe fifth thing to be considered, is, that the members of the grand jury\r\nbeing merchants, and principal shopkeepers, can have no suitable\r\ntemptation offered them, as a recompense for the mischief they will\r\nsuffer by letting in this coin, nor can be at any loss or danger by\r\nrejecting the bill: They do not expect any employments in the state, to\r\nmake up in their own private advantage, the destruction of their\r\ncountry. Whereas those who go about to advise, entice, or threaten them\r\nto find that bill, have great employments, which they have a mind to\r\nkeep, or to get greater, which was likewise the case of all those who\r\nsigned to have the author prosecuted. And therefore it is known, that\r\nhis grace the Lord Archbishop of Dublin,[1] so renowned for his piety,\r\nand wisdom, and love of his country, absolutely refused to condemn the\r\nbook, or the author.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The proclamation against the Drapier's fourth letter as\r\ngiven in Appendix IV. at the end of this volume, does not bear\r\nArchbishop King's signature. In a letter from that prelate, written on\r\nNovember 24th, 1724, to Samuel Molineux, secretary to the Prince of\r\nWales, it appears that other persons of influence also refrained from\r\nsanctioning it. The following is an extract from this letter as given by\r\nMonck Mason for the first time:\r\n\r\n\"A great many pamphlets have been writ about it [Wood's patent], but I\r\nam told none of them are permitted to be printed in England. Two have\r\ncome out since my Lord Lieutenant came here, written with sobriety,\r\nmodesty, and great force, in my opinion, which put the matter in a fair\r\nand clear light, though not with all the advantage of which it is\r\ncapable; four were printed before, by somebody that calleth himself a\r\nDrapier which were in a ludicrous and satyrical style; against the last\r\nof these the Lord Lieutenant procured a proclamation, signed by 17 of\r\nthe Council; offering £300 for discovering the author. I thought the\r\npremium excessive, so I and three more refused to sign it, but declared,\r\nthat if his excellency would secure us from the brass money, I would\r\nsign it, or any other, tending only to the disadvantage of private\r\npersons; but, till we had that security, I would look on this\r\nproclamation no otherwise than as a step towards passing that base and\r\nmischievous coin, and designed to intimidate those who opposed the\r\npassing it; and I declared, that I would not approve of anything that\r\nmight countenance, or encourage such a ruinous project; that issuing\r\nsuch a proclamation would make all believe, that the government was\r\nengaged to support Wood's pretensions, and that would neither be for\r\ntheir honour nor ease. I was not able to stop the proclamation, but my\r\nrefusing to sign it has not been without effect.\" (\"History of St.\r\nPatrick's,\" p. 344, note n.). [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nLastly, it ought to be considered what consequence the finding the bill,\r\nmay have upon a poor man perfectly innocent, I mean the printer. A\r\nlawyer may pick out expressions and make them liable to exception, where\r\nno other man is able to find any. But how can it be supposed, that an\r\nignorant printer can be such a critic? He knew the author's design was\r\nhonest, and approved by the whole kingdom, he advised with friends, who\r\ntold him there was no harm in the book, and he could see none himself.\r\nIt was sent him in an unknown hand, but the same in which he received\r\nthe three former. He and his wife have offered to take their oaths that\r\nthey knew not the author; and therefore to find a bill, that may bring a\r\npunishment upon the innocent, will appear very hard, to say no worse.\r\nFor it will be impossible to find the author, unless he will please to\r\ndiscover himself, although I wonder he ever concealed his name. But I\r\nsuppose what he did at first out of modesty, he now continues to do out\r\nof prudence. God protect us and him!\r\n\r\nI will conclude all with a fable, ascribed to Demosthenes. He had served\r\nthe people of Athens with great fidelity in the station of an orator,\r\nwhen upon a certain occasion, apprehending to be delivered over to his\r\nenemies, he told the Athenians, his countrymen, the following story.\r\nOnce upon a time the wolves desired a league with the shepherds, upon\r\nthis condition; that the cause of strife might be taken away, which was\r\nthe shepherds and the mastiffs; this being granted, the wolves without\r\nall fear made havoc of the sheep.[2]\r\n\r\nNovem. 11th, 1724.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The advice had the desired effect. The jury returned a\r\nverdict of \"Ignoramus\" on the bill, which so aroused Whitshed, the Chief\r\nJustice, that he discharged them. As a comment on Whitshed's illegal\r\nprocedure, the following extract was circulated:\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM A BOOK ENTITLED, \"AN EXACT COLLECTION OF THE DEBATES OF THE\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS HELD AT WESTMINSTER, OCTOBER 21, 1680,\" page 150.\r\n\r\n_Resolutions of the House of Commons, in England, November 13, 1680._\r\n\r\n\"Several persons being examined about the dismissing a grand jury in\r\nMiddlesex, the House came to the following resolutions:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the discharging of a grand-jury by any judge, before\r\nthe end of the term, assizes, or sessions, while matters are under their\r\nconsideration, and not presented, is arbitrary, illegal, destructive to\r\npublic justice, a manifest violation of his oath, and is a means to\r\nsubvert the fundamental laws of this kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That a committee be appointed to examine the proceedings of\r\nthe judges in Westminster-hall, and report the same with their opinion\r\ntherein to this House.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO THE LORD CHANCELLOR MIDDLETON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nI have departed from the order given by Faulkner and the earlier\r\neditors,[1] and followed by Sir W. Scott in arranging the series of the\r\nDrapier's Letters, by adhering to a more correct chronological sequence.\r\nThis letter has always been printed as the sixth Drapier's letter, but I\r\nhave printed it here as the fifth, since it was written prior to the\r\nletter addressed to Viscount Molesworth, which has hitherto been called\r\nthe fifth. The Molesworth letter I print here as \"Letter VI.\" As already\r\nnoted the letter to Midleton was written on the 26th October, 1724, but\r\nits first publication in print did not occur until Faulkner included it\r\nin the fourth volume of his collected edition of Swift's works, issued\r\nin 1735. There it is signed \"J.S.\" and is given as from the \"Deanery\r\nHouse.\" All the other letters are printed as \"By M.B. Drapier.\" The\r\nAdvertisement to the Reader prefixed to the present fifth letter is from\r\nFaulkner's edition. Probably it was printed by Faulkner under Swift's\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sheridan, Deane Swift, Hawkesworth and Nichols]\r\n\r\nSwift's acquaintance with Midleton had been of long standing. The\r\nChancellor had been an avowed opponent of the patent and yet, by his\r\nsignature to the proclamation, he seemed to be giving the weight of his\r\nofficial position against the popular sentiment. In addressing him,\r\nSwift was endeavouring, apparently, to keep him to his original line of\r\naction and to destroy any influence the government party may have had on\r\nhim, since he was well aware of Carteret's insinuating charm. Midleton,\r\nhowever, had always stood firm against the patent. His signature to the\r\nproclamation against the Drapier was justified by him when he said that\r\nthe Drapier's letters tended to disturbance. Carteret had really tried\r\nto win him over, but he did not succeed \"While he [Midleton] expressed\r\nthe highest obligation to the Lord Lieutenant,\" writes Coxe, \"he\r\ndeclared that his duty to his country was paramount to every other\r\nconsideration, and refused to give any assistance to government, until\r\nthe patent was absolutely surrendered.\"\r\n\r\nThe text here given of this letter is based on Faulkner's issue in vol.\r\niv. of the 1735 edition of Swift's works. It has been collated with that\r\ngiven in the fifth volume of the \"Miscellanies,\" printed in London in\r\nthe same year.\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe former of the two following papers is dated Oct. 6th 1724[3], by\r\nwhich it appears to be written a little after the proclamation against\r\nthe author of the Drapier's Fourth Letter. It is delivered with much\r\ncaution, because the author confesseth himself to be Dean of St.\r\nPatrick's; and I could discover his name subscribed at the end of the\r\noriginal, although blotted out by some other hand, I can tell no other\r\nreason why it was not printed, than what I have heard; that the writer\r\nfinding how effectually the Drapier had succeeded, and at the same time\r\nhow highly the people in power seemed to be displeased, thought it more\r\nprudent to keep the paper in his cabinet. However, having received some\r\nencouragement to collect into one volume all papers relating to Ireland,\r\nsupposed to be written by the Drapier; and knowing how favourably that\r\nauthor's writings in this kind have been received by the public; to make\r\nthe volume more complete, [I procured a copy of the following letter\r\nfrom one of the author's friends, with whom it was left, while the\r\nauthor was in England; and][4] I have printed it as near as I could in\r\nthe order of time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Nichols, in the second volume of his Supplement to Swift's\r\nWorks (1779, 8vo), prints a note on this \"Advertisement,\" furnished him\r\nby Bowyer. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1. The first of the papers is said to be dated Oct. 6, 1724; and that\r\nit appears from thence to be dated a little after the proclamation\r\nagainst the Drapier's fourth letter. Now the fourth letter itself is\r\ndated Oct. 23, 1724. This is a pardonable mistake anywhere, but, much\r\nmore in a country where _going before just coming after_ is the\r\ncharacteristic dialect. But I little thought that the Dean, in his zeal\r\nfor Ireland, would vouchsafe to adopt the shibboleth of it.\r\n\r\n\"2. The Preface-writer, in the choice MS which he found, could discover\r\nthe Dean's name subscribed at the end of the original; but _blotted out_\r\nby _some other hand_. As the former passage is a proof that the\r\nAdvertisement was drawn up in Ireland, so this affords a strong\r\npresumption that it was under the direction of the Dean himself: for who\r\nelse could divine that his name was struck out by another hand? Other\r\nink it might be: but in these recent MSS. of our age, it is the first\r\ntime I ever heard of a blot carrying the evidence of a handwriting.\r\nWhether the Dean or the printer hit this _blot_, I shall not inquire;\r\nbut lay before you the pleasant procedure of the latter upon this\r\ndiscovery. He had got, we see, the original in the Dean's hand; but the\r\nname was obliterated. What does he, but send away to England for a copy\r\nwhich might authenticate _his original_; and from such a copy the public\r\nis favoured with it! I remember, in a cause before Sir Joseph Jekyll, a\r\nman began reading in court the title-deeds of an estate which was\r\ncontested. 'The original is a little blind,' says he; 'I have got a very\r\nfair copy of it, which I beg leave to go on with'--'Hold,' says Sir\r\nJoseph, 'if the original is not good, the copy can never make it so.' I\r\nam far, however, from accusing the printer of intending any fraud on the\r\nworld. He who tells his story so openly gives security enough for his\r\nhonesty. I can easily conceive the Advertisement might be in a good\r\nmeasure the Dean's, who never was over-courteous to his readers, and\r\nmight for once be content to be merry with them.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Misprinted by Faulkner for Oct. 26th. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This portion in square brackets is not given by Faulkner in\r\nhis Advertisement. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe next treatise is called \"An Address, &c.\" It is without a date; but\r\nseems to be written during the first session of Parliament in Lord\r\nCarteret's government. The title of this Address is in the usual form,\r\nby M.B. Drapier. There is but a small part of it that relates to William\r\nWood and his coin: The rest contains several proposals for the\r\nimprovement of Ireland, the many discouragements it lies under, and what\r\nare the best remedies against them.\r\n\r\nBy many passages in some of the Drapier's former letters, but\r\nparticularly in the following Address, concerning the great drain of\r\nmoney from Ireland by absentees, importation of foreign goods, balance\r\nof trade, and the like, it appears that the author had taken much pains,\r\nand been well informed in the business of computing; all his reasonings\r\nupon that subject, although he does not here descend to particular sums,\r\nagreeing generally with the accounts given by others who have since made\r\nthat enquiry their particular study. And it is observable, that in this\r\nAddress, as well as in one of his printed letters, he hath specified\r\nseveral important articles, that have not been taken notice of by others\r\nwho came after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO THE LORD CHANCELLOR MIDDLETON.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lord, I desire you will consider me as a member who comes in at the\r\nlatter end of a debate; or as a lawyer who speaks to a cause, when the\r\nmatter hath been almost exhausted by those who spoke before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Alan Brodrick, Lord Midleton (1660?-1728), came of a Surrey\r\nfamily that had greatly benefited by the forfeitures in Ireland.\r\nAdopting the profession of the law, Brodrick was, in 1695, appointed\r\nSolicitor-General for Ireland. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as\r\nthe member for Cork, and in 1703 was chosen its Speaker. His strong\r\nopposition to the Sacramental Test Act lost him the favour of the\r\ngovernment, and he was removed from his office of Solicitor-General. In\r\n1707, however, he was appointed Attorney-General for Ireland, and in\r\n1714 made Lord Chancellor. In the year following he was created Baron\r\nBrodrick of Midleton. His trimming with Walpole and Carteret did not,\r\nhowever, prevent him from opposing the Wood's patent, though he signed\r\nthe proclamation against the Drapier. He thought the letters served to\r\n\"create jealousies between the King and the people of Ireland.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI remember some months ago I was at your house upon a commission, where\r\nI am one of the governors: But I went thither not so much on account of\r\nthe commission, as to ask you some questions concerning Mr. Wood's\r\npatent to coin halfpence for Ireland; where you very freely told me, in\r\na mixed company, how much you had been always against that wicked\r\nproject, which raised in me an esteem for you so far, that I went in a\r\nfew days to make you a visit, after many years' intermission. I am\r\nlikewise told, that your son wrote two letters from London, (one of\r\nwhich I have seen) empowering those to whom they were directed, to\r\nassure his friends, that whereas there was a malicious report spread of\r\nhis engaging himself to Mr. Walpole for forty thousand pounds of Wood's\r\ncoin, to be received in Ireland, the said report was false and\r\ngroundless; and he had never discoursed with that minister on the\r\nsubject; nor would ever give his consent to have one farthing of the\r\nsaid coin current here. And although it be long since I have given\r\nmyself the trouble of conversing with people of titles or stations; yet\r\nI have been told by those who can take up with such amusements, that\r\nthere is not a considerable person of the kingdom, scrupulous in any\r\nsort to declare his opinion. But all this is needless to allege, when we\r\nconsider, that the ruinous consequences of Wood's patent, have been so\r\nstrongly represented by both Houses of Parliament; by the Privy-council;\r\nthe Lord Mayor and Aldermen of Dublin; by so many corporations; and the\r\nconcurrence of the principal gentlemen in most counties, at their\r\nquarter-sessions, without any regard to party, religion, or nation.\r\n\r\nI conclude from hence, that the currency of these halfpence would, in\r\nthe universal opinion of our people, be utterly destructive to this\r\nkingdom; and consequently, that it is every man's duty, not only to\r\nrefuse this coin himself, but as far as in him lies, to persuade others\r\nto do the like: And whether this be done in private or in print, is all\r\na case: As no layman is forbid to write, or to discourse upon religious\r\nor moral subjects; although he may not do it in a pulpit (at least in\r\nour church). Neither is this an affair of state, until authority shall\r\nthink fit to declare it so: Or if you should understand it in that\r\nsense; yet you will please to consider that I am not now a preaching.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I do think it my duty, since the Drapier will probably be no\r\nmore heard of, so far to supply his place, as not to incur his fortune:\r\nFor I have learnt from old experience, that there are times wherein a\r\nman ought to be cautious as well as innocent. I therefore hope, that\r\npreserving both those characters, I may be allowed, by offering new\r\narguments or enforcing old ones, to refresh the memory of my\r\nfellow-subjects, and keep up that good spirit raised among them; to\r\npreserve themselves from utter ruin by lawful means, and such as are\r\npermitted by his Majesty.\r\n\r\nI believe you will please to allow me two propositions: First, that we\r\nare a most loyal people; and, Secondly, that we are a free people, in\r\nthe common acceptation of that word applied to a subject under a\r\nlimited monarch. I know very well, that you and I did many years ago\r\nin discourse differ much, in the presence of Lord Wharton, about the\r\nmeaning of that word _liberty_, with relation to Ireland. But if you\r\nwill not allow us to be a free people, there is only another appellation\r\nleft; which, I doubt, my Lord Chief Justice Whitshed would call me to an\r\naccount for, if I venture to bestow: For, I observed, and I shall never\r\nforget upon what occasion, the device upon his coach to be _Libertas et\r\nnatale solum;_ at the very point of time when he was sitting in his\r\ncourt, and perjuring himself to betray both.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: On this motto of Whitshed's Swift wrote the following\r\npoetical paraphrase:\r\n\r\n\"_Libertas et natale solum:_\r\nFine words! I wonder where you stole 'em.\r\nCould nothing but thy chief reproach\r\nServe for a motto on thy coach?\r\nBut let me now thy words translate:\r\n_Natale solum,_ my estate;\r\nMy dear estate, how well I love it,\r\nMy tenants, if you doubt, will prove it,\r\nThey swear I am so kind and good,\r\nI hug them till I squeeze their blood.\r\n  _Libertas_ bears a large import:\r\nFirst, how to swagger in a court;\r\nAnd, secondly, to shew my fury\r\nAgainst an uncomplying jury;\r\nAnd, thirdly, 'tis a new invention,\r\nTo favour Wood, and keep my pension;\r\nAnd, fourthly, 'tis to play an odd trick,\r\nGet the great seal and turn out Broderick;\r\nAnd, fifthly, (you know whom I mean,)\r\nTo humble that vexatious Dean:\r\nAnd, sixthly, for my soul to barter it\r\nFor fifty times its worth to Carteret.\r\nNow since your motto thus you construe,\r\nI must confess you've spoken once true.\r\n_Libertas et natale solum_.\r\nYou had good reason when you stole 'em.\"\r\n\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nNow, as for our loyalty, to His present Majesty; if it hath ever been\r\nequalled in any other part of his dominions; I am sure it hath never\r\nbeen exceeded: And I am confident he hath not a minister in England who\r\ncould ever call it once in question: But that some hard rumours at least\r\nhave been transmitted from t'other side the water, I suppose you will\r\nnot doubt: and rumours of the severest kind; which many good people have\r\nimputed to the indirect proceeding of Mr. Wood and his emissaries; as if\r\nhe endeavoured it should be thought that our loyalty depended upon the\r\ntest of refusing or taking his copper. Now, as I am sure you will admit\r\nus to be a loyal people; so you will think it pardonable in us to hope\r\nfor all proper marks of favour and protection from so gracious a King,\r\nthat a loyal and free people can expect: Among which, we all agree in\r\nreckoning this to be one; that Wood's halfpence may never have entrance\r\ninto this kingdom. And this we shall continue to wish, when we dare no\r\nlonger express our wishes; although there were no such mortal as a\r\nDrapier in the world.\r\n\r\nI am heartily sorry, that any writer should, in a cause so generally\r\napproved, give occasion to the government and council to charge him with\r\nparagraphs \"highly reflecting upon His Majesty and his ministers;\r\ntending to alienate the affections of his good subjects in England and\r\nIreland from each other; and to promote sedition among the people.\"[7] I\r\nmust confess, that with many others, I thought he meant well; although\r\nhe might have the failing of better writers, to be not always fortunate\r\nin the manner of expressing himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Swift here quotes the words of the proclamation issued\r\nagainst the fourth Drapier's Letter. See Appendix IV. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nHowever, since the Drapier is but one man, I shall think I do a public\r\nservice, by asserting that the rest of my countrymen are wholly free\r\nfrom learning out of _his_ pamphlets to reflect on the King or his\r\nministers, to breed sedition.\r\n\r\nI solemnly declare, that I never once heard the least reflection cast\r\nupon the King, on the subject of Mr. Wood's coin: For in many discourses\r\non this matter, I do not remember His Majesty's name to be so much as\r\nmentioned. As to the ministry in England, the only two persons hinted at\r\nwere the Duke of Grafton, and Mr. Walpole:[8] The former, as I have\r\nheard you and a hundred others affirm, declared, that he never saw the\r\npatent in favour of Mr. Wood, before it was passed, although he were\r\nthen lord lieutenant: And therefore I suppose everybody believes, that\r\nhis grace hath been wholly unconcerned in it since.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Walpole was created a Knight of the Bath in 1724, when that\r\norder was revived. In 1726 he was installed Knight of the Order of the\r\nGarter, being the only commoner who had been so distinguished since the\r\nreign of James I., except Admiral Montague, afterwards Earl of Sandwich.\r\nHe had been offered a peerage in 1723, but declined it for himself,\r\naccepting it for his son, who was created Baron Walpole of Walpole, in\r\nNorfolk. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nMr. Walpole was indeed supposed to be understood by the letter W. in\r\nseveral newspapers; where it is said, that some expressions fell from\r\nhim not very favourable to the people of Ireland; for the truth of\r\nwhich, the kingdom is not to answer, any more than for the discretion of\r\nthe publishers. You observe, the Drapier wholly clears Mr. Walpole of\r\nthis charge, by very strong arguments and speaks of him with civility. I\r\ncannot deny myself to have been often present, where the company gave\r\nthen opinion, that Mr. Walpole favoured Mr. Wood's project, which I\r\nalways contradicted; and for my own part, never once opened my lips\r\nagainst that minister, either in mixed or particular meetings: And my\r\nreason for this reservedness was, because it pleased him, in the Queen's\r\ntime (I mean Queen Anne of ever blessed memory) to make a speech\r\ndirectly against me, by name, in the House of Commons, as I was told a\r\nvery few minutes after, in the Court of Requests, by more than fifty\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nBut you, who are in a great station here, (if anything here may be\r\ncalled great) cannot be ignorant, that whoever is understood by public\r\nvoice to be chief minister, will, among the general talkers, share the\r\nblame, whether justly or no, of every thing that is disliked; which I\r\ncould easily make appear in many instances, from my own knowledge, while\r\nI was in the world; and particularly in the case of the greatest, the\r\nwisest, and the most uncorrupt minister, I ever conversed with.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut, whatever unpleasing opinion some people might conceive of Mr.\r\nWalpole, on account of those halfpence; I dare boldly affirm, it was\r\nentirely owing to Mr. Wood. Many persons of credit, come from England,\r\nhave affirmed to me, and others, that they have seen letters under his\r\nhand, full of arrogance and insolence towards Ireland; and boasting of\r\nhis favour with Mr. Walpole; which is highly probable: Because he\r\nreasonably thought it for his interest to spread such a report; and\r\nbecause it is the known talent of low and little spirits, to have a\r\ngreat man's name perpetually in their mouths.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See Coxe's \"Memoirs of Walpole\" (vol. i., cap. 26, p. 389,\r\ned. 1800), where Wood is blamed for his indiscretion on this matter. See\r\nalso note prefixed to the Drapier's First Letter in the present edition.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThus I have sufficiently justified the people of Ireland, from learning\r\nany bad lessons out of the Drapier's pamphlets, with regard to His\r\nMajesty and his ministers: And, therefore, if those papers were intended\r\nto sow sedition among us, God be thanked, the seeds have fallen upon a\r\nvery improper soil.\r\n\r\nAs to alienating the affections of the people of England and Ireland\r\nfrom each other; I believe, the Drapier, whatever his intentions were,\r\nhath left that matter just as he found it.\r\n\r\nI have lived long in both kingdoms, as well in country as in town; and\r\ntherefore, take myself to be as well informed as most men, in the\r\ndispositions of each people toward the other. By the people, I\r\nunderstand here, only the bulk of the common people; and I desire no\r\nlawyer may distort or extend my meaning.\r\n\r\nThere is a vein of industry and parsimony, that runs through the whole\r\npeople of England; which, added to the easiness of their rents, makes\r\nthem rich and sturdy. As to Ireland, they know little more than they do\r\nof Mexico; further than that it is a country subject to the King of\r\nEngland, full of bogs, inhabited by wild Irish Papists; who are kept in\r\nawe by mercenary troops sent from thence: And their general opinion is,\r\nthat it were better for England if this whole island were sunk into the\r\nsea; for, they have a tradition, that every forty years there must be a\r\nrebellion in Ireland. I have seen the grossest suppositions pass upon\r\nthem; \"that the wild Irish were taken in toils; but that, in some time,\r\nthey would grow so tame, as to eat out of your hands:\" I have been\r\nasked by hundreds, and particularly by my neighbours, your tenants, at\r\nPepper-harrow; \"whether I had come from Ireland by sea:\" And, upon the\r\narrival of an Irishman to a country town, I have known crowds coming\r\nabout him, and wondering to see him look so much better than themselves.\r\n\r\nA gentleman now in Dublin, affirms, \"that passing some months ago\r\nthrough Northampton, and finding the whole town in a flurry, with bells,\r\nbonfires, and illuminations, upon asking the cause, was told, it was for\r\njoy, that the Irish had submitted to receive Wood's halfpence.\" This, I\r\nthink, plainly shews what sentiments that large town hath of us; and how\r\nlittle they made it their own case; although they be directly in our way\r\nto London, and therefore, cannot but be frequently convinced that we\r\nhave human shapes.\r\n\r\nAs to the people of this kingdom, they consist either of Irish Papists;\r\nwho are as inconsiderable, in point of power, as the women and children;\r\nor of English Protestants, who love their brethren of that kingdom;\r\nalthough they may possibly sometimes complain, when they think they are\r\nhardly used: However, I confess, I do not see any great consequence, how\r\ntheir personal affections stand to each other, while the sea divides\r\nthem, and while they continue in their loyalty to the same prince. And\r\nyet, I will appeal to you; whether those from England have reason to\r\ncomplain, when they come hither in pursuit of their fortunes? Or,\r\nwhether the people of Ireland have reason to boast, when they go to\r\nEngland on the same design?\r\n\r\nMy second proposition was, that we of Ireland are a free people: This, I\r\nsuppose, you will allow; at least, with certain limitations remaining in\r\nyour own breast. However, I am sure it is not criminal to affirm;\r\nbecause the words \"liberty\" and \"property,\" as applied to the subject,\r\nare often mentioned in both houses of Parliament, as well as in yours,\r\nand other courts below; from whence it must follow, that the people of\r\nIreland do, or ought to enjoy all the benefits of the common and statute\r\nlaw; such as to be tried by juries, to pay no money without their own\r\nconsent, as represented in Parliament; and the like. If this be so, and\r\nif it be universally agreed, that a free people cannot, by law, be\r\ncompelled to take any money in payment, except gold and silver; I do\r\nnot see why any man should be hindered from cautioning his countrymen\r\nagainst this coin of William Wood; who is endeavouring by fraud to rob\r\nus of that property, which the laws have secured. If I am mistaken, and\r\nthat this copper can be obtruded on us; I would put the Drapier's case\r\nin another light, by supposing, that a person going into his shop,\r\nshould agree for thirty shillings' worth of goods, and force the seller\r\nto take his payment in a parcel of copper pieces, intrinsically not\r\nworth above a crown: I desire to know, whether the Drapier would not be\r\nactually robbed of five and twenty shillings, and how far he could be\r\nsaid to be master of his property? The same question may be applied to\r\nrents and debts, on bond or mortgage, and to all kind of commerce\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to do what the Drapier hath done more than once before me;\r\nwhich is, to relate the naked fact, as it stands in the view of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOne William Wood, Esq; and hardware-man, obtains, by fraud, a patent in\r\nEngland, to coin 108,000_l._ in copper, to pass in Ireland, leaving us\r\nliberty to take, or to refuse. The people here, in all sorts of bodies\r\nand representatives, do openly and heartily declare, that they will not\r\naccept this coin: To justify these declarations, they generally offer\r\ntwo reasons; first, because by the words of the patent, they are left to\r\ntheir own choice: And secondly, because they are not obliged by law: So\r\nthat here you see there is, _bellum atgue virum_, a kingdom on one side,\r\nand William Wood on the other. And if Mr. Wood gets the victory, at the\r\nexpense of Ireland's ruin, and the profit of one or two hundred thousand\r\npounds (I mean by continuing, and counterfeiting as long as he lives)\r\nfor himself; I doubt, both present and future ages will, at least, think\r\nit a very singular scheme.\r\n\r\nIf this fact be truly stated; I must confess, I look upon it as my duty,\r\nso far as God hath enabled me, and as long as I keep within the bounds\r\nof truth, of duty, and of decency, to warn my fellow-subjects, as they\r\nvalue their King, their country, and all that ought or can be dear to\r\nthem, never to admit this pernicious coin; no not so much as one single\r\nhalfpenny. For, if one single thief forces the door, it is in vain to\r\ntalk of keeping out the whole crew behind.\r\n\r\nAnd, while I shall be thus employed, I will never give myself leave to\r\nsuppose, that what I say can either offend my Lord Lieutenant; whose\r\nperson and great qualities I have always highly respected; (as I am sure\r\nhis excellency will be my witness) or the ministers in England, with\r\nwhom I have nothing to do, or they with me; much less the Privy-council\r\nhere, who, as I am informed, did send an address to His Majesty against\r\nMr. Wood's coin; which, if it be a mistake, I desire I may not be\r\naccused for a spreader of false news: But, I confess, I am so great a\r\nstranger to affairs, that for anything I know, the whole body of the\r\ncouncil may since have been changed: And, although I observed some of\r\nthe very same names in a late declaration against that coin, which I saw\r\nsubscribed to the proclamation against the Drapier; yet possibly they\r\nmay be different persons; for they are utterly unknown to me, and are\r\nlike to continue so.\r\n\r\nIn this controversy, where the reasoners on each side are divided by St.\r\nGeorge's Channel, His Majesty's prerogative, perhaps, would not have\r\nbeen mentioned; if Mr. Wood, and his advocates, had not made it\r\nnecessary, by giving out, that the currency of his coin should be\r\nenforced by a proclamation. The traders and common people of the\r\nkingdom, were heartily willing to refuse this coin; but the fear of a\r\nproclamation brought along with it most dreadful apprehensions. It was\r\ntherefore, absolutely necessary for the Drapier, to remove this\r\ndifficulty; and accordingly, in one of his former pamphlets, he hath\r\nproduced invincible arguments, (wherever he picked them up) that the\r\nKing's prerogative was not at all concerned in the matter; since the law\r\nhad sufficiently provided against any coin to be imposed upon the\r\nsubject, except gold and silver; and that copper is not money, but as it\r\nhath been properly called _nummorum famulus_.\r\n\r\nThe three former letters from the Drapier, having not received any\r\npublic censure, I look upon them to be without exception; and that the\r\ngood people of the kingdom ought to read them often, in order to keep up\r\nthat spirit raised against this destructive coin of Mr. Wood: As for\r\nthis last letter, against which a proclamation is issued; I shall only\r\nsay, that I could wish it were stripped of all that can be any way\r\nexceptionable; which I would not think it below me to undertake, if my\r\nabilities were equal; but being naturally somewhat slow of\r\ncomprehension; no lawyer, and apt to believe the best of those who\r\nprofess good designs, without any visible motive either of profit or\r\nhonour; I might pore for ever, without distinguishing the cockle from\r\nthe corn.\r\n\r\nThat which, I am told, gives greatest offence in this last letter, is\r\nwhere the Drapier affirms; \"that if a rebellion should prove so\r\nsuccessful, as to fix the Pretender on the throne of England, he would\r\nventure so far to transgress the Irish statute, (which unites Ireland to\r\nEngland under one King) as to lose every drop of his blood, to hinder\r\nhim from being King of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nI shall not presume to vindicate any man, who openly declares he would\r\ntransgress a statute; and a statute of such importance: But, with the\r\nmost humble submission, and desire of pardon for a very innocent\r\nmistake, I should be apt to think that the loyal intention of the\r\nwriter, might be at least some small extenuation of his crime. For, in\r\nthis I confess myself to think with the Drapier.\r\n\r\nI have not hitherto been told of any other objections against that\r\npamphlet; but, I suppose, they will all appear at the prosecution of the\r\nDrapier. And, I think, whoever in his own conscience believes the said\r\npamphlet to be \"wicked and malicious, seditious and scandalous, highly\r\nreflecting upon His Majesty and his ministers, &c.\" would do well to\r\ndiscover the author, (as little a friend as I am to the trade of\r\ninformers) although the reward of 300_l_. had not been tacked to the\r\ndiscovery. I own, it would be a great satisfaction to me, to hear the\r\narguments not only of judges, but of lawyers, upon this case. Because,\r\nyou cannot but know, there often happens occasions, wherein it would be\r\nvery convenient, that the bulk of the people should be informed how they\r\nought to conduct themselves; and therefore, it hath been the wisdom of\r\nthe English Parliaments, to be very reserved in limiting the press. When\r\na bill is debating in either House of Parliament there, nothing is more\r\nusual, than to have the controversy handled by pamphlets on both sides;\r\nwithout the least animadversion upon the authors.\r\n\r\nSo here, in the case of Mr. Wood and his coin; since the two Houses\r\ngave their opinion by addresses, how dangerous the currency of that\r\ncopper would be to Ireland; it was, without all question, both lawful\r\nand convenient, that the bulk of the people should be let more\r\nparticularly into the nature of the danger they were in; and of the\r\nremedies that were in their own power, if they would have the sense to\r\napply them; and this cannot be more conveniently done, than by\r\nparticular persons, to whom God hath given zeal and understanding\r\nsufficient for such an undertaking. Thus it happened in the case of that\r\ndestructive project for a bank in Ireland, which was brought into\r\nParliament a few years ago; and it was allowed, that the arguments and\r\nwritings of some without doors, contributed very much to reject it.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Swift himself assisted in writing against this\r\n\"destructive project\" in a series of pamphlets (see vol. vii.). The\r\narguments for and against the bank were thoroughly discussed by Hercules\r\nRowley and Henry Maxwell in a series of controversial letters against\r\neach other. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nNow, I should be heartily glad if some able lawyers would prescribe the\r\nlimits, how far a private man may venture in delivering his thoughts\r\nupon public matters: Because a true lover of his country, may think it\r\nhard to be a quiet stander-by, and an indolent looker-on, while a public\r\nerror prevails; by which a whole nation may be ruined. Every man who\r\nenjoys property, hath some share in the public; and therefore, the care\r\nof the public is, in some degree, every such man's concern.\r\n\r\nTo come to particulars, I could wish to know, Whether it be utterly\r\nunlawful in any writer so much as to mention the prerogative; at least\r\nso far as to bring it into doubt, upon any point whatsoever? I know it\r\nis often debated in Westminster-hall; and Sir Edward Coke, as well as\r\nother eminent lawyers, do frequently handle that subject in their books.\r\n\r\nSecondly, How far the prerogative extends to force coin upon the\r\nsubject, which is not sterling; such as lead, brass, copper, mixt metal,\r\nshells, leather, or any other material; and fix upon it whatever\r\ndenomination the crown shall think fit?\r\n\r\nThirdly, What is really and truly meant by that phrase of \"a depending\r\nkingdom,\" as applied to Ireland; and wherein that dependency consisteth?\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, In what points relating to liberty and property, the people of\r\nIreland differ, or at least ought to differ, from those of England?\r\n\r\nIf these particulars were made so clear, that none could mistake them,\r\nit would be of infinite ease and use to the kingdom; and either prevent\r\nor silence all discontents.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Somers, the greatest man I ever knew of your robe; and whose\r\nthoughts of Ireland differed as far as heaven and earth, from those of\r\nsome others among his brethren here; lamented to me, that the\r\nprerogative of the Crown, or the privileges of Parliament, should ever\r\nbe liable to dispute, in any single branch of either; by which means, he\r\nsaid, the public often suffered great inconveniences; whereof he gave me\r\nseveral instances. I produce the authority of so eminent a person, to\r\njustify my desires, that some high points might be cleared.\r\n\r\nFor want of such known ascertainment, how far a writer may proceed in\r\nexpressing his good wishes for his country; a person of the most\r\ninnocent intentions, may possibly, by the oratory and comments of\r\nlawyers, be charged with many crimes, which from his very soul he\r\nabhors; and consequently may be ruined in his fortunes, and left to rot\r\namong thieves in some stinking jail; merely for mistaking the purlieus\r\nof the law. I have known, in my lifetime, a printer prosecuted and\r\nconvicted, for publishing a pamphlet; where the author's intentions, I\r\nam confident, were as good and innocent, as those of a martyr at his\r\nlast prayers.[12] I did very lately, as I thought it my duty, preach to\r\nthe people under my inspection, upon the subject of Mr. Wood's coin; and\r\nalthough I never heard that my sermon gave the least offence, as I am\r\nsure none was intended; yet, if it were now printed and published, I\r\ncannot say, I would ensure it from the hands of the common hangman; or\r\nmy own person from those of a messenger.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Supposed to be \"A proposal for the universal use of Irish\r\nmanufactures,\" written by the author. [F.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The reference here is to Swift's sermon on \"Doing Good.\"\r\nSee Swift's Works, vol. iv., p. 181, present edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI have heard the late Chief Justice Holt[14]affirm, that in all criminal\r\ncases, the most favourable interpretation should be put upon words, that\r\nthey can possibly bear. You meet the same position asserted in many\r\ntrials, for the greatest crimes; though often very ill practised, by the\r\nperpetual corruption of judges. And I remember, at a trial in Kent,\r\nwhere Sir George Rook[15] was indicted for calling a gentleman knave and\r\nvillain; the lawyer for the defendant brought off his client, by\r\nalleging, that the words were not injurious; for, _knave_ in the old and\r\ntrue signification, imported only a servant; and _villain_ in Latin, is\r\n_villicus_; which is no more than a man employed in country labour; or\r\nrather a bailiff.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Sir John Holt (1642-1710) held the recordership of London,\r\nin 1685, and was appointed Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in\r\n1688. In the celebrated case, Ashby _v._. White, Holt strongly upheld\r\nthe rights of the voter as against the House of Commons. He was\r\ndistinguished, in his time, for the fair and impartial hearing he always\r\naccorded a prisoner, and he even personally assisted the accused in\r\ncases where the law did not allow him to be represented by counsel. Many\r\nof Holt's opinions did become \"standard maxims.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Admiral Sir George Rooke (1650-1709), who, with\r\nRear-Admiral Byng, captured Gibraltar in 1704. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nIf Sir John Holt's opinion were a standard maxim for all times and\r\ncircumstances, any writer, with a very small measure of discretion,\r\nmight easily be safe; but, I doubt, in practice it hath been frequently\r\ncontrolled, at least before his time; for I take it to be an old rule in\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nI have read, or heard, a passage of Signor Leti, an Italian; who being\r\nin London, busying himself with writing the History of England, told\r\nKing Charles the Second, that he endeavoured as much as he could to\r\navoid giving offence, but found it a thing impossible; although he\r\nshould have been as wise as Solomon: The King answered, that if this\r\nwere the case, he had better employ his time in writing proverbs as\r\nSolomon did: But Leti lay under no public necessity of writing; neither\r\nwould England have been one halfpenny the better, or the worse, whether\r\nhe writ or no.\r\n\r\nThis I mention, because I know it will readily be objected, \"What have\r\nprivate men to do with the public? What call had a Drapier to turn\r\npolitician, to meddle in matters of state? Would not his time have been\r\nbetter employed in looking to his shop; or his pen in writing proverbs,\r\nelegies, ballads, garlands, and wonders? He would then have been out of\r\nall danger of proclamations, and prosecutions. Have we not able\r\nmagistrates and counsellors hourly watching over the public weal?\" All\r\nthis may be true: And yet, when the addresses from both Houses of\r\nParliament, against Mr. Wood's halfpence, failed of success; if some pen\r\nhad not been employed, to inform the people how far they might legally\r\nproceed, in refusing that coin, to detect the fraud, the artifice, and\r\ninsolence of the coiner; and to lay open the most ruinous consequences\r\nto the whole kingdom; which would inevitably follow from the currency of\r\nthe said coin; I might appeal to many hundred thousand people, whether\r\nany one of them would ever have had the courage or sagacity to refuse\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIf this copper should begin to make its way among the common, ignorant\r\npeople, we are inevitably undone; it is they who give us the greatest\r\napprehension, being easily frighted, and greedy to swallow\r\nmisinformations: For, if every man were wise enough to understand his\r\nown interest, which is every man's principal study, there would be no\r\nneed of pamphlets upon this occasion. But, as things stand, I have\r\nthought it absolutely necessary, from my duty to God, my King, and my\r\ncountry, to inform the people, that the proclamation lately issued\r\nagainst the Drapier, doth not in the least affect the case of Mr. Wood\r\nand his coin; but only refers to certain paragraphs in the Drapier's\r\nlast pamphlet, (not immediately relating to his subject, nor at all to\r\nthe merits of the cause,) which the government was pleased to dislike;\r\nso that any man has the same liberty to reject, to write, and to declare\r\nagainst this coin, which he had before: Neither is any man obliged to\r\nbelieve, that those honourable persons (whereof you are the first) who\r\nsigned that memorable proclamation against the Drapier, have at all\r\nchanged their opinions, with regard to Mr. Wood or his coin.\r\n\r\nTherefore concluding myself to be thus far upon a safe and sure foot; I\r\nshall continue, upon any proper occasion, as God enables me, to revive\r\nand preserve that spirit raised in the nation, (whether the real author\r\nwere a real Drapier or no is little to the purpose) against this horrid\r\ndesign of Mr. Wood; at the same time carefully watching every stroke of\r\nmy pen, and venturing only to incur the public censure of the world as a\r\nwriter; not of my Lord Chief Justice Whitshed, as a criminal. Whenever\r\nan order shall come out by authority, forbidding all men upon the\r\nhighest penalties, to offer anything in writing or discourse against\r\nMr. Wood's halfpence; I shall certainly submit. However, if that should\r\nhappen, I am determined to be somewhat more than the last man in the\r\nkingdom to receive them; because I will never receive them at all: For,\r\nalthough I know how to be silent; I have not yet learned to pay active\r\nobedience against my conscience, and the public safety.\r\n\r\nI desire to put a case, which I think the Drapier, in some of his books,\r\nhath put before me; although not so fully as it requires.\r\n\r\nYou know the copper halfpence in England are coined by the public; and\r\nevery piece worth pretty tolerably near the value of the copper. Now\r\nsuppose, that, instead of the public coinage, a patent had been granted\r\nto some private, obscure person, for coining a proportionable quantity\r\nof copper in that kingdom, to what Mr. Wood is preparing in this; and\r\nall of it at least five times below the intrinsic value: The current\r\nmoney of England is reckoned to be twenty millions; and ours under five\r\nhundred thousand pounds: By this computation, as Mr. Wood hath power to\r\ngive us 108,000 pound; so the patentee in England, by the same\r\nproportion, might circulate four millions three hundred and twenty\r\nthousand pounds; besides as much more by stealth and counterfeits: I\r\ndesire to know from you, whether the Parliament might not have addressed\r\nupon such an occasion; what success they probably would have had; and\r\nhow many Drapiers would have risen to pester the world with pamphlets:\r\nYet that kingdom would not be so great a sufferer as ours in the like\r\ncase; because their cash would not be conveyed into foreign countries,\r\nbut lie hid in the chests of cautious, thrifty men, until better times.\r\nThen I desire, for the satisfaction of the public, that you will please\r\nto inform me why this country is treated in so very different a manner,\r\nin a point of such high importance; whether it be on account of\r\nPoining's act; of subordination; dependence; or any other term of art;\r\nwhich I shall not contest, but am too dull to understand.\r\n\r\nI am very sensible, that the good or ill success of Mr. Wood, will\r\naffect you less than any person of consequence in the kingdom; because I\r\nhear you are so prudent as to make all your purchases in England; and\r\ntruly so would I, if I had money, although I were to pay a hundred\r\nyears' purchase; because I should be glad to possess a freehold that\r\ncould not be taken from me by any law to which I did not give my own\r\nconsent; and where I should never be in danger of receiving my rents in\r\nmixed copper, at the loss of sixteen shillings in the pound. You can\r\nlive in ease and plenty at Pepper-harrow, in Surrey; and therefore I\r\nthought it extremely generous and public-spirited in you to be of the\r\nkingdom's side in this dispute, by shewing, without reserve, your\r\ndisapprobation of Mr. Wood's design; at least if you have been so frank\r\nto others as you were to me; which indeed I could not but wonder at,\r\nconsidering how much we differ in other points; and therefore I could\r\nget but few believers, when I attempted to justify you in this article\r\nfrom your own words.\r\n\r\nI would humbly offer another thought, which I do not remember to have\r\nfallen under the Drapier's observation. If these halfpence should once\r\ngain admittance; it is agreed, that in no long space of time, what by\r\nthe clandestine practices of the coiner, what by his own counterfeits,\r\nand those of others, either from abroad or at home; his limited quantity\r\nwould be trebled upon us, until there would not be a grain of gold or\r\nsilver visible in the nation. This, in my opinion would lay a heavy\r\ncharge upon the crown, by creating a necessity of transmitting money\r\nfrom England to pay the salaries at least of the principal civil\r\nofficers: For I do not conceive how a judge (for instance) could support\r\nhis dignity with a thousand pounds a year in Wood's coin; which would\r\nnot intrinsically be worth near two hundred. To argue that these\r\nhalfpence, if no other coin were current, would answer the general ends\r\nof commerce among ourselves, is a great mistake; and the Drapier hath\r\nmade that matter too clear to admit an answer; by shewing us what every\r\nowner of land must be forced to do with the products of it in such a\r\ndistress. You may read his remarks at large in his second and third\r\nletter; to which I refer you.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude, I cannot but observe, that for several months past,\r\nthere have more papers been written in this town, such as they are, all\r\nupon the best public principle, the love of our country, than, perhaps,\r\nhath been known in any other nation, and in so short a time: I speak in\r\ngeneral, from the Drapier down to the maker of ballads; and all without\r\nany regard to the common motives of writers: which are profit, favour,\r\nand reputation. As to profit, I am assured by persons of credit, that\r\nthe best ballad upon Mr. Wood will not yield above a groat to the\r\nauthor; and the unfortunate adventurer Harding, declares he never made\r\nthe Drapier any present, except one pair of scissors. As to favour,\r\nwhoever thinks to make his court by opposing Mr. Wood is not very deep\r\nin politics. And as to reputation, certainly no man of worth and\r\nlearning, would employ his pen upon so transitory a subject, and in so\r\nobscure a corner of the world, to distinguish himself as an author. So\r\nthat I look upon myself, the Drapier, and my numerous brethren, to be\r\nall true patriots in our several degrees.\r\n\r\nAll that the public can expect for the future, is only to be sometimes\r\nwarned to beware of Mr. Wood's halfpence; and refer them for conviction\r\nto the Drapier's reasons. For, a man of the most superior understanding,\r\nwill find it impossible to make the best use of it, while he writes in\r\nconstraint; perpetually softening, correcting, or blotting out\r\nexpressions, for fear of bringing his printer, or himself, under a\r\nprosecution from my Lord Chief-Justice Whitshed. It calls to my\r\nremembrance the madman in Don Quixote, who being soundly beaten by a\r\nweaver for letting a stone (which he always carried on his shoulder)\r\nfall upon a spaniel, apprehended that every cur he met was of the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I am convinced, that what I have now written will\r\nappear low and insipid; but if it contributes, in the least, to preserve\r\nthat union among us for opposing this fatal project of Mr. Wood, my\r\npains will not be altogether lost.\r\n\r\nI sent these papers to an eminent lawyer (and yet a man of virtue and\r\nlearning into the bargain) who, after many alterations returned them\r\nback, with assuring me, that they are perfectly innocent; without the\r\nleast mixture of treason, rebellion, sedition, malice, disaffection,\r\nreflection, or wicked insinuation whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIf the bellman of each parish, as he goes his circuit, would cry out,\r\nevery night, \"Past twelve o'clock; Beware of Wood's halfpence;\" it would\r\nprobably cut off the occasion for publishing any more pamphlets;\r\nprovided that in country towns it were done upon market days. For my\r\nown part, as soon as it shall be determined, that it is not against law,\r\nI will begin the experiment in the liberty of St. Patrick's; and hope my\r\nexample may be followed in the whole city But if authority shall think\r\nfit to forbid all writings, or discourses upon this subject, except such\r\nas are in favour of Mr. Wood, I will obey as it becomes me; only when I\r\nam in danger of bursting, I will go and whisper among the reeds, not any\r\nreflection upon the wisdom of my countrymen; but only these few words,\r\nBEWARE OF WOOD'S HALFPENCE.\r\n\r\nI am,\r\n    With due Respect,\r\n        Your Most Obedient,\r\n            Humble Servant,\r\n                 J.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeanery House,\r\n    Oct. 26, 1724.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD VISCOUNT MOLESWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis letter, hitherto styled the Drapier's fifth letter, is here printed\r\nas the sixth, for the reasons already stated. It was published on the\r\n14th December, 1724, at a time when the Drapier agitation had reached\r\nits last stage. The Drapier had taught his countrymen that \"to be brave\r\nis to be wise,\" and he now struck the final blow that laid prostrate an\r\nalready tottering opposition.\r\n\r\nWalpole realized that to govern Ireland from England he must have a\r\ntrustier aid, a heavier hand, and a more vigilant eye, than were\r\nafforded in Carteret. Carteret, however, was better away in Ireland,\r\nand, moreover, as Lord-Lieutenant, he was an ameliorating influence on\r\nthe Irish patriotic party in Dublin. But that party was now backed by a\r\nvery important popular opinion. For the present, therefore, he gave way;\r\nbut his real feelings might have been discovered by an interpretation of\r\nhis appointment of Hugh Boulter as Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of\r\nIreland.[1] Boulter's letter to the Duke of Newcastle, written after his\r\narrival in Dublin towards the end of November, 1724, gave a very\r\nunambiguous account of the state of the country towards the patent. On\r\nthe 3rd of December, he wrote, \"We are at present in a very bad state,\r\nand the people so poisoned with apprehensions of Wood's halfpence, that\r\nI do not see there can be any hopes of justice against any person for\r\nseditious writings, if he does but mix somewhat about Wood in them....\r\nBut all sorts here are determinedly set against Wood's halfpence, and\r\nlook upon their estates as half sunk in their value, whenever they shall\r\npass upon the nation.\"[2] On January 19th 1724-1725, the Primate wrote\r\nagain to the same effect. On the 3rd of July, he hopes that, as\r\nparliament is about to meet, the Lord-Lieutenant \"will be impowered in\r\nhis speech to speak clearly as to the business of the halfpence, and\r\nthoroughly rid this nation of their fear on that head.\"[3] Boulter's\r\nadvice was taken. On the 14th August, 1725, a vacation of the patent was\r\nissued, and when parliament met shortly after, the Lord-Lieutenant was\r\nable, in his speech, to announce that his Majesty had put an entire end\r\nto the patent granted Wood for coining copper halfpence and farthings.\r\nHe alluded to the surrender as a remarkable instance of royal favour and\r\ncondescension which should fill the hearts of a loyal and obedient\r\npeople with the highest sense of duty and gratitude. He doubted not the\r\nHouses would make suitable acknowledgment of their sense of happiness\r\nenjoyed under his Majesty's most mild and gracious government.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See note on pp. 111-112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Boulter's letter, vol. i., p. 3. Dublin edition, 1770.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid_., p. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Comm. Journals, vol. iii., p. 398.]\r\n\r\nThe Commons unanimously voted an address suitable to the occasion and in\r\nharmony with the Lord-Lieutenant's suggestion. But the Lords\r\nprocrastinated in debates. It was a question whether their address\r\nshould or should not include the words \"great wisdom\" in addition to the\r\nword \"condescension\" to express their sense of his Majesty's action.\r\nFinally, however, the address was forthcoming, though not before some\r\nstrenuous expressions of opinion had been made by Midleton and\r\nArchbishop King against Walpole's administration. As passed, their\r\nAddress included the debated words; as presented the Address omitted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThus ended this famous agitation in which the people of Ireland won\r\ntheir first victory over England by constitutional means. Wood was no\r\nloser by the surrender; indeed, he was largely the gainer, since he was\r\ngiven a pension of £3,000 per annum for twelve years.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Coxe says for eight years.]\r\n\r\nNow that the fight was over the people, to use Scott's words, \"turned\r\ntheir eyes with one consent on the man, by whose unbending fortitude,\r\nand pre-eminent talents, this triumph was accomplished.\" He was hailed\r\njoyously and blessed fervently wherever he went; the people almost\r\nidolized him; he was their defender and their liberator. No monarch\r\nvisiting his domains could have been received with greater honour than\r\nwas Swift when he came into a town. Medals and medallions were struck in\r\nhis honour. A club was formed to the memory of the Drapier; shops and\r\ntaverns bore the sign of the Drapier's Head; children and women carried\r\nhandkerchiefs with the Drapier's portrait woven in them. All grades of\r\nsociety respected him for an influence that, founded in sincerity and\r\nguided by integrity and consummate ability, had been used patriotically.\r\nThe DEAN became Ireland's chiefest citizen; and Irishmen will ever\r\nrevere the memory of the man who was the first among them to precipitate\r\ntheir national instincts into the abiding form of national power--the\r\nreasoned opinion of a free people.\r\n\r\nThe text of this letter is based on that given by Sir Walter Scott,\r\ncollated with the original edition and with the text given in \"Fraud\r\nDetected\" (1725).\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                   A\r\n\r\n               **LETTER**\r\n\r\n      To the Right Honourable the\r\n     *Lord Viscount _Molesworth_.*\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy _M.B.

HARDING, When I sent you my former papers, I cannot say I intended\r\nyou either good or hurt, and yet you have happened through my means to\r\nreceive both. I pray God deliver you from any more of the latter, and\r\nincrease the former. Your trade, particularly in this kingdom, is of all\r\nothers the most unfortunately circumstantiated; For as you deal in the\r\nmost worthless kind of trash, the penny productions of pennyless\r\nscribblers, so you often venture your liberty and sometimes your lives,\r\nfor the purchase of half-a-crown, and by your own ignorance are punished\r\nfor other men's actions.\r\n\r\nI am afraid, you in particular think you have reason to complain of me\r\nfor your own and your wife's confinement in prison, to your great\r\nexpense, as well as hardship, and for a prosecution still impending. But\r\nI will tell you, Mr. Harding, how that matter stands. Since the press\r\nhath lain under so strict an inspection, those who have a mind to inform\r\nthe world are become so cautious, as to keep themselves if possible out\r\nof the way of danger. My custom is to dictate to a 'prentice who can\r\nwrite in a feigned hand, and what is written we send to your house by a\r\nblackguard boy. But at the same time I do assure you upon my reputation,\r\nthat I never did send you anything, for which I thought you could\r\npossibly be called to an account. And you will be my witness that I\r\nalways desired you by a letter to take some good advice before you\r\nventured to print, because I knew the dexterity of dealers in the law at\r\nfinding out something to fasten on where no evil is meant; I am told\r\nindeed, that you did accordingly consult several very able persons, and\r\neven some who afterwards appeared against you: To which I can only\r\nanswer, that you must either change your advisers, or determine to print\r\nnothing that comes from a Drapier.\r\n\r\nI desire you will send the enclosed letter, directed \"To my Lord\r\nViscount Molesworth at his house at Brackdenstown near Swords;\" but I\r\nwould have it sent printed for the convenience of his Lordship's\r\nreading, because this counterfeit hand of my 'prentice is not very\r\nlegible. And if you think fit to publish it, I would have you first get\r\nit read over carefully by some notable lawyer: I am assured you will\r\nfind enough of them who are friends to the Drapier, and will do it\r\nwithout a fee, which I am afraid you can ill afford after all your\r\nexpenses. For although I have taken so much care, that I think it\r\nimpossible to find a topic out of the following papers for sending you\r\nagain to prison; Yet I will not venture to be your guarantee.\r\n\r\nThis ensuing letter contains only a short account of myself, and an\r\nhumble apology for my former pamphlets, especially the last, with little\r\nmention of Mr. Wood or his halfpence, because I have already said enough\r\nupon that subject, until occasion shall be given for new fears; and in\r\nthat case you may perhaps hear from me again.\r\n\r\nI am,\r\n  Your Friend\r\n    and Servant,\r\n               M.B.\r\n\r\nFrom my shop in\r\nSt. Francis-street\r\nDec. 14. 1724.\r\n\r\n_P.S._ For want of intercourse between you and me, which I never will\r\nsuffer, your people are apt to make very gross errors in the press,\r\nwhich I desire you will provide against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD VISCOUNT MOLESWORTH, AT HIS\r\nHOUSE AT BRACKDENSTOWN NEAR SWORDS.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lord, I reflect too late on the maxim of common observers, that\r\n\"those who meddle in matters out of their calling, will have reason to\r\nrepent;\" which is now verified in me: For by engaging in the trade of a\r\nwriter, I have drawn upon myself the displeasure of the government,\r\nsignified by a proclamation promising a reward of three hundred pounds\r\nto the first faithful subject who shall be able and inclined to inform\r\nagainst me. To which I may add the laudable zeal and industry of my Lord\r\nChief Justice [Whitshed] in his endeavours to discover so dangerous a\r\nperson. Therefore whether I repent or no, I have certainly cause to do\r\nso, and the common observation still stands good.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Robert, Viscount Molesworth (1656-1725), born in Dublin and\r\neducated at the University there, was a prominent adherent of the Prince\r\nof Orange during the Revolution of 1688. In 1692 William sent him to\r\nDenmark as envoy-extraordinary to the Court at Copenhagen; but he left\r\nabruptly because of the offence he gave there. Retiring to Flanders,\r\nMolesworth revenged himself by writing, \"An Account of Denmark as it was\r\nin 1692,\" in which he described that country as no fit place for those\r\nwho held their liberties dearly. Molesworth had been strongly imbued\r\nwith the republican teachings of Algernon Sidney, and his book affords\r\nample proof of the influence. Its publication aroused much indignation,\r\nand a controversy ensued in which Swift's friend, Dr. William King, took\r\npart. In 1695 Molesworth returned to Ireland, became a Privy Councillor\r\nin 1697, sat in the Irish parliament in 1703-1705, and in the English\r\nHouse of Commons from 1705 to 1708. In 1713 he was removed from the\r\nIrish Privy Council on a charge of a treasonable utterance, which Steele\r\nvindicated in \"The Englishman\" and \"The Crisis.\" The accession of George\r\nI., however, brought Molesworth into his honours again, and he was\r\ncreated Baron Molesworth of Philipstown, and Viscount Molesworth of\r\nSwords, in 1719. His work entitled \"Considerations for Promoting\r\nAgriculture,\" issued in 1723, was considered by Swift as \"an excellent\r\ndiscourse, full of most useful hints.\" At the time Swift addressed him\r\nthis sixth letter, Molesworth was living in retirement at Brackdenstown.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nIt will sometimes happen, I know not how in the course of human affairs,\r\nthat a man shall be made liable to legal animadversions, where he has\r\nnothing to answer for, either to God or his country; and condemned at\r\nWestminster-hall for what he will never be charged with at the Day of\r\nJudgment.\r\n\r\nAfter strictly examining my own heart, and consulting some divines of\r\ngreat reputation, I cannot accuse myself of any \"malice or wickedness\r\nagainst the public;\" of any \"designs to sow sedition,\" of \"reflecting on\r\nthe King and his ministers,\" or of endeavouring \"to alienate the\r\naffections of the people of this kingdom from those of England.\"[7] All\r\nI can charge myself with, is a weak attempt to serve a nation in danger\r\nof destruction by a most wicked and malicious projector, without waiting\r\nuntil I were called to its assistance; which attempt, however it may\r\nperhaps give me the title of _pragmatical_ and _overweening_ will never\r\nlie a burthen upon my conscience. God knows whether I may not with all\r\nmy caution have already run myself into danger, by offering thus much in\r\nmy own vindication. For I have heard of a judge, who, upon the\r\ncriminal's appeal to the dreadful Day of Judgment, told him he had\r\nincurred a _premunire_ for appealing to a foreign jurisdiction: And of\r\nanother in Wales, who severely checked the prisoner for offering the\r\nsame plea, taxing him with reflecting on the Court by such a comparison,\r\nbecause \"comparisons were odious.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The quotations are from the charges stated in the\r\nindictment and proclamation against the writer and printer of the\r\nprevious letters. [T.S.] ]\r\n\r\nBut in order to make some excuse for being more speculative than others\r\nof my condition, I desire your lordship's pardon, while I am doing a\r\nvery foolish thing, which is, to give you some little account of myself.\r\n\r\nI was bred at a free school where I acquired some little knowledge in\r\nthe Latin tongue, I served my apprenticeship in London, and there set up\r\nfor myself with good success, till by the death of some friends, and\r\nthe misfortunes of others, I returned into this kingdom, and began to\r\nemploy my thoughts in cultivating the woollen manufacture through all\r\nits branches Wherein I met with great discouragement and powerful\r\nopposers, whose objections appeared to me very strange and singular They\r\nargued that the people of England would be offended if our manufactures\r\nwere brought to equal theirs; and even some of the weaving trade were my\r\nenemies, which I could not but look upon as absurd and unnatural I\r\nremember your lordship at that time did me the honour to come into my\r\nshop, where I shewed you a piece of black and white stuff just sent from\r\nthe dyer, which you were pleased to approve of, and be my customer for\r\nit.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The \"piece of black and white stuff just sent from the\r\ndyer,\" refers to his pamphlet, issued in 1720, \"The Proposal for the\r\nUniversal Use of Irish Manufactures.\" See vol. vii. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nHowever I was so mortified, that I resolved for the future to sit\r\nquietly in my shop, and deal in common goods like the rest of my\r\nbrethren; till it happened some months ago considering with myself that\r\nthe lower and poorer sort of people wanted a _plain strong coarse stuff\r\nto defend them against cold easterly winds, which then blew very fierce\r\nand blasting for a long time together_, I contrived one on purpose,\r\nwhich sold very well all over the kingdom, and preserved many thousands\r\nfrom agues I then made a second and a third kind of stuffs for the\r\ngentry with the same success, insomuch that an ague hath hardly been\r\nheard of for some time.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The \"cold easterly winds\" refer to the demands made on the\r\nIrish people to accept Wood's halfpence. The three different kinds of\r\n\"stuffs\" are the three letters written under the _nom de guerre,_ \"M.B.\r\nDrapier.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThis incited me so far, that I ventured upon a fourth piece made of the\r\nbest Irish wool I could get, and I thought it grave and rich enough to\r\nbe worn by the best lord or judge of the land. But of late some great\r\nfolks complain as I hear, \"that when they had it on, they felt a\r\nshuddering in their limbs,\" and have thrown it off in a rage, cursing to\r\nhell the poor Drapier who invented it, so that I am determined never to\r\nwork for persons of quality again, except for your lordship and a very\r\nfew more.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: This refers to the fourth letter of the Drapier, which\r\nbrought forth the proclamation, and for the author of which the reward\r\nof £300 was offered. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI assure your lordship upon the word of an honest citizen, that I am not\r\nricher by the value of one of Mr. Wood's halfpence with the sale of all\r\nthe several stuffs I have contrived; for I give the whole profit to the\r\ndyers and pressers.[11] And therefore I hope you will please to believe,\r\nthat no other motive beside the love of my country could engage me to\r\nbusy my head and hands to the loss of my time and the gain of nothing\r\nbut vexation and ill-will.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The printers [F.]]\r\n\r\nI have now in hand one piece of stuff to be woven on purpose for your\r\nlordship, although I might be ashamed to offer it you, after I have\r\nconfessed that it will be made only from the shreds and remnants of the\r\nwool employed in the former. However I shall work it up as well as I\r\ncan, and at worst, you need only give it among your tenants.\r\n\r\nI am very sensible how ill your lordship is like to be entertained with\r\nthe pedantry of a drapier in the terms of his own trade. How will the\r\nmatter be mended, when you find me entering again, though very\r\nsparingly, into an affair of state; for such is now grown the\r\ncontroversy with Mr. Wood, if some great lawyers are to be credited. And\r\nas it often happens at play, that men begin with farthings, and go on to\r\ngold, till some of them lose their estates, and die in jail; so it may\r\npossibly fall out in my case, that by playing too long with Mr. Wood's\r\nhalfpence, I may be drawn in to pay a fine, double to the reward for\r\nbetraying me, be sent to prison, and \"not be delivered thence till I\r\nshall have paid the uttermost farthing.\"\r\n\r\nThere are my lord, three sorts of persons with whom I am resolved never\r\nto dispute: A highwayman with a pistol at my breast, a troop of dragoons\r\nwho come to plunder my house, and a man of the law who can make a merit\r\nof accusing me. In each of these cases, which are almost the same, the\r\nbest method is to keep out of the way, and the next best is to deliver\r\nyour money, surrender your house, and confess nothing.\r\n\r\nI am told that the two points in my last letter, from which an occasion\r\nof offence hath been taken, are where I mention His Majesty's answer to\r\nthe address of the House of Lords upon Mr. Wood's patent, and where I\r\ndiscourse upon Ireland's being a dependent kingdom. As to the former, I\r\ncan only say, that I have treated it with the utmost respect and\r\ncaution, and I thought it necessary to shew where Wood's patent differed\r\nin many essential parts from all others that ever had been granted,\r\nbecause the contrary had for want of due information been so strongly\r\nand so largely asserted. As to the other, of Ireland's dependency, I\r\nconfess to have often heard it mentioned, but was never able to\r\nunderstand what it meant. This gave me the curiosity to enquire among\r\nseveral eminent lawyers, who professed they knew nothing of the matter.\r\nI then turned over all the statutes of both kingdoms without the least\r\ninformation, further than an Irish act, that I quoted, of the 33d of\r\nHenry 8th, uniting Ireland to England under one king. I cannot say I was\r\nsorry to be disappointed in my search, because it is certain, I could be\r\ncontented to depend only upon God and my prince and the laws of my own\r\ncountry, after the manner of other nations. But since my betters are of\r\na different opinion, and desire further dependencies, I shall readily\r\nsubmit, not insisting on the exception I made of M.B. Drapier. For\r\nindeed that hint was borrowed from an idle story I had heard in England,\r\nwhich perhaps may be common and beaten, but because it insinuates\r\nneither treason nor sedition, I will just barely relate it.\r\n\r\nSome hundred years ago when the peers were so great that the commons\r\nwere looked upon as little better than their dependents, a bill was\r\nbrought in for making some new additions to the power and privileges of\r\nthe peerage. After it was read, one Mr. Drewe a member of the house,\r\nstood up, and said, he very much approved the bill, and would give his\r\nvote to have it pass; but however, for some reasons best known to\r\nhimself, he desired that a clause might be inserted for excepting the\r\nfamily of the Drewes. The oddness of the proposition taught others to\r\nreflect a little, and the bill was thrown out.\r\n\r\nWhether I were mistaken, or went too far in examining the dependency\r\nmust be left to the impartial judgment of the world, as well as to the\r\ncourts of judicature, although indeed not in so effectual and decisive\r\na manner. But to affirm, as I hear some do, in order to countenance a\r\nfearful and servile spirit, that this point did not belong to my\r\nsubject, is a false and foolish objection. There were several scandalous\r\nreports industriously spread by Wood and his accomplices to discourage\r\nall opposition against his infamous project. They gave it out that we\r\nwere prepared for a rebellion, that we disputed the King's prerogative,\r\nand were shaking off our dependency. The first went so far, and obtained\r\nso much belief against the most visible demonstrations to the contrary,\r\nthat a great person of this kingdom, now in England, sent over such an\r\naccount of it to his friends, as would make any good subject both grieve\r\nand tremble. I thought it therefore necessary to treat that calumny as\r\nit deserved. Then I proved by an invincible argument that we could have\r\nno intention to dispute His Majesty's prerogative, because the\r\nprerogative was not concerned in the question, the civilians and lawyers\r\nof all nations agreeing that copper is not money. And lastly to clear us\r\nfrom the imputation of shaking off our dependency, I shewed wherein as I\r\nthought this dependency consisted, and cited the statute above mentioned\r\nmade in Ireland, by which it is enacted, that \"whoever is King of\r\nEngland shall be King of Ireland,\" and that the two kingdoms shall be\r\n\"for ever knit together under one King.\" This, as I conceived, did\r\nwholly acquit us of intending to break our dependency, because it was\r\naltogether out of our power, for surely no King of England will ever\r\nconsent to the repeal of that statute.\r\n\r\nBut upon this article I am charged with a heavier accusation. It is said\r\nI went too far, when I declared, that \"if ever the Pretender should come\r\nto be fixed upon the throne of England (which God forbid) I would so far\r\nventure to transgress this statute, that I would lose the last drop of\r\nmy blood before I would submit to him as King of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThis I hear on all sides, is the strongest and weightiest objection\r\nagainst me, and which hath given the most offence; that I should be so\r\nbold to declare against a direct statute, and that any motive how strong\r\nsoever, could make me reject a King whom England should receive. Now if\r\nin defending myself from this accusation I should freely confess, that I\r\n\"went too far,\" that \"the expression was very indiscreet, although\r\noccasioned by my zeal for His present Majesty and his Protestant line in\r\nthe House of Hanover,\" that \"I shall be careful never to offend again in\r\nthe like kind.\" And that \"I hope this free acknowledgment and sorrow for\r\nmy error, will be some atonement and a little soften the hearts of my\r\npowerful adversaries.\" I say if I should offer such a defence as this, I\r\ndo not doubt but some people would wrest it to an ill meaning by some\r\nspiteful interpretation, and therefore since I cannot think of any other\r\nanswer, which that paragraph can admit, I will leave it to the mercy of\r\nevery candid reader.\r\n\r\nI will now venture to tell your lordship a secret, wherein I fear you\r\nare too deeply concerned You will therefore please to know that this\r\nhabit of writing and discoursing, wherein I unfortunately differ from\r\nalmost the whole kingdom, and am apt to grate the ears of more than I\r\ncould wish, was acquired during my apprenticeship in London, and a long\r\nresidence there after I had set up for myself. Upon my return and\r\nsettlement here, I thought I had only changed one country of freedom for\r\nanother. I had been long conversing with the writings of your\r\nlordship,[12] Mr. Locke, Mr. Molineaux,[13] Colonel Sidney[14] and other\r\ndangerous authors, who talk of \"liberty as a blessing, to which the\r\nwhole race of mankind hath an original title, whereof nothing but\r\nunlawful force can divest them.\" I knew a good deal of the several\r\nGothic institutions in Europe, and by what incidents and events they\r\ncame to be destroyed; and I ever thought it the most uncontrolled and\r\nuniversally agreed maxim, that _freedom_ consists in a people being\r\ngoverned by laws made with their own consent; and _slavery_ in the\r\ncontrary. I have been likewise told, and believe it to be true, that\r\n_liberty_ and _property_ are words of known use and signification in\r\nthis kingdom, and that the very lawyers pretend to understand, and have\r\nthem often in their mouths. These were the errors which have misled me,\r\nand to which alone I must impute the severe treatment I have received.\r\nBut I shall in time grow wiser, and learn to consider my driver, the\r\nroad I am in, and with whom I am yoked. This I will venture to say, that\r\nthe boldest and most obnoxious words I ever delivered, would in England\r\nhave only exposed me as a stupid fool, who went to prove that the sun\r\nshone in a clear summer's day; and I have witnesses ready to depose that\r\nyour lordship hath said and writ fifty times worse, and what is still an\r\naggravation, with infinitely more wit and learning, and stronger\r\narguments, so that as politics run, I do not know a person of more\r\nexceptionable principles than yourself; and if ever I shall be\r\ndiscovered, I think you will be bound in honour to pay my fine and\r\nsupport me in prison; or else I may chance to inform against you by way\r\nof reprisal.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See note _ante_, p. 161.

His \"Dioptrica Nova\" contains a warm appreciation\r\nof Locke's \"Essay on the Human Understanding.\" He died in October, 1698,\r\nbut in the early part of this year, he published his famous inquiry into\r\nthe effect of English legislation on Irish manufactures. The work was\r\nentitled, \"The Case of Ireland's being bound by Acts of Parliament in\r\nEngland stated,\" and its publication made a great stir both in England\r\nand in Ireland. Molyneux attempted to show that the Irish Parliament was\r\nindependent of the English Parliament. His book was reported by a\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons, on June 22nd, 1698, to be \"of\r\ndangerous consequence to the Crown and Parliament of England,\" but the\r\nmatter went no further than embodying this resolution of the committee\r\nin an address to the King.

He was tried\r\nfor treason before Jeffreys, and in spite of a most excellent defence,\r\nsentenced to death. His execution took place on December 7th, 1682. [T.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: A writer, signing himself M.M., replying to this letter of\r\nSwift's in a broadside entitled, \"Seasonable Advice to M.B. Drapier,\r\nOccasioned by his Letter to the R--t. Hon. the Lord Visct. Molesworth,\"\r\nactually takes this paragraph to mean that Swift intended seriously to\r\nturn informer: \"Now sir, some people are of opinion that you carried\r\nthis too far, inasmuch as you become a precedent to informers: others\r\nthink that you intimate to his lordship, the miserable circumstance you\r\nare in by the menaces of the prentice to whom you dictate; they conceive\r\nyour declaring to inform, if not fee'd, to the contrary, signifies your\r\nsaid prentice on the last occasion to swear, if you don't forthwith\r\ndeliver him his indentures, and half of your stock to set up trade with,\r\nhe will inform against you, bring you to justice, be dismissed by law,\r\nand get the promised £300 to begin trade with; how near these\r\nconceptions be to truth I can't tell; but I know people think that word\r\n_inform_ unseasonable. . . .\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I beg your lordship to receive my confession, that if\r\nthere be any such thing as a dependency of Ireland upon England,\r\notherwise than as I have explained it, either by the law of God, of\r\nnature, of reason, of nations, or of the land (which I shall never\r\nhereafter contest,) then was the proclamation against me, the most\r\nmerciful that ever was put out, and instead of accusing me as malicious,\r\nwicked and seditious, it might have been directly as guilty of high\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nAll I desire is, that the cause of my country against Mr. Wood may not\r\nsuffer by any inadvertency of mine; Whether Ireland depends upon\r\nEngland, or only upon God, the King and the law, I hope no man will\r\nassert that it depends upon Mr. Wood. I should be heartily sorry that\r\nthis commendable resentment against me should accidentally (and I hope,\r\nwhat was never intended) strike a damp upon that spirit in all ranks and\r\ncorporations of men against the desperate and ruinous design of Mr.\r\nWood. Let my countrymen blot out those parts in my last letter which\r\nthey dislike, and let no rust remain on my sword to cure the wounds I\r\nhave given to our most mortal enemy. When Sir Charles Sidley[16] was\r\ntaking the oaths, where several things were to be renounced, he said \"he\r\nloved renouncing,\" asked \"if any more were to be renounced, for he was\r\nready to renounce as much as they pleased.\" Although I am not so\r\nthorough a renouncer; yet let me have but good city security against\r\nthis pestilent coinage, and I shall be ready not only to renounce every\r\nsyllable in all my four letters, but to deliver them cheerfully with my\r\nown hands into those of the common hangman, to be burnt with no better\r\ncompany than the coiner's _effigies,_ if any part of it hath escaped out\r\nof the secular hands of the rabble.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: This must be Sir Charles Sedley (properly Sidley), the\r\nfamous wit and dramatist of Charles II.'s reign. In his reprint of 1735,\r\nFaulkner prints the name \"Sidley,\" though the original twopenny tract\r\nand the \"Hibernian Patriot\" print it as \"Sidney.\" Sir W. Scott corrects\r\nit to \"Sedley.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut whatever the sentiments of some people may be, I think it is agreed\r\nthat many of those who subscribed against me, are on the side of a vast\r\nmajority in the kingdom who opposed Mr. Wood; and it was with great\r\nsatisfaction that I observed some right honourable names very amicably\r\njoined with my own at the bottom of a strong declaration against him and\r\nhis coin. But if the admission of it among us be already determined the\r\nworthy person who is to betray me ought in prudence to do it with all\r\nconvenient speed, or else it may be difficult to find three hundred\r\npounds in sterling for the discharge of his hire; when the public shall\r\nhave lost five hundred thousand, if there be so much in the nation;\r\nbesides four-fifths of its annual income for ever.\r\n\r\nI am told by lawyers, that in all quarrels between man and man, it is of\r\nmuch weight, which of them gave the first provocation or struck the\r\nfirst blow. It is manifest that Mr. Wood hath done both, and therefore I\r\nshould humbly propose to have him first hanged and his dross thrown into\r\nthe sea; after which the Drapier will be ready to stand his trial. \"It\r\nmust needs be that offences come, but woe unto him by whom the offence\r\ncometh.\" If Mr. Wood had held his hand every body else would have held\r\ntheir tongues, and then there would have been little need of pamphlets,\r\njuries, or proclamations upon this occasion. The provocation must needs\r\nhave been great, which could stir up an obscure indolent Drapier to\r\nbecome an author. One would almost think the very stones in the street\r\nwould rise up in such a cause: And I am not sure they will not do so\r\nagainst Mr. Wood if ever he comes within their reach. It is a known\r\nstory of the dumb boy, whose tongue forced a passage for speech by the\r\nhorror of seeing a dagger at his father's throat. This may lessen the\r\nwonder that a tradesman hid in privacy and silence should cry out when\r\nthe life and being of his political mother are attempted before his\r\nface, and by so infamous a hand.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, Mr. Wood the destroyer of a kingdom walks about in\r\ntriumph (unless it be true that he is in jail for debt) while he who\r\nendeavoured to assert the liberty of his country is forced to hide his\r\nhead for occasionally dealing in a matter of controversy. However I am\r\nnot the first who hath been condemned to death for gaining a great\r\nvictory over a powerful enemy, by disobeying for once the strict orders\r\nof military discipline.\r\n\r\nI am now resolved to follow (after the usual proceeding of mankind,\r\nbecause it is too late) the advice given me by a certain Dean. He shewed\r\nthe mistake I was in of trusting to the general good-will of the people,\r\n\"that I had succeeded hitherto better than could be expected, but that\r\nsome unfortunate circumstantial lapse would probably bring me within the\r\nreach of power. That my good intentions would be no security against\r\nthose who watched every motion of my pen, in the bitterness of my soul.\"\r\nHe produced an instance of \"a writer as innocent, as disinterested, and\r\nas well meaning as myself, where the printer, who had the author in his\r\npower, was prosecuted with the utmost zeal, the jury sent back nine\r\ntimes, and the man given up to the mercy of the court.\"[17] The Dean\r\nfurther observed \"that I was in a manner left alone to stand the battle,\r\nwhile others who had ten thousand times better talents than a Drapier,\r\nwere so prudent to lie still, and perhaps thought it no unpleasant\r\namusement to look on with safety, while another was giving them\r\ndiversion at the hazard of his liberty and fortune, and thought they\r\nmade a sufficient recompense by a little applause.\" Whereupon he\r\nconcluded with a short story of a Jew at Madrid, who being condemned to\r\nthe fire on account of his religion, a crowd of school-boys following\r\nhim to the stake, and apprehending they might lose their sport, if he\r\nshould happen to recant, would often clap him on the back, and cry,\r\n\"_Sta firme Moyse_ (Moses, continue steadfast).\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: This was for the publication of \"A Proposal for the\r\nUniversal Use of Irish Manufactures.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI allow this gentleman's advice to have been good, and his observations\r\njust, and in one respect my condition is worse than that of the Jew, for\r\nno recantation will save me. However it should seem by some late\r\nproceedings, that my state is not altogether deplorable. This I can\r\nimpute to nothing but the steadiness of two impartial grand juries,\r\nwhich hath confirmed in me an opinion I have long entertained, that, as\r\nphilosophers say, \"virtue is seated in the middle,\" so in another\r\nsense, the little virtue left in the world is chiefly to be found among\r\nthe middle rank of mankind, who are neither allured out of her paths by\r\nambition, nor driven by poverty.\r\n\r\nSince the proclamation occasioned by my last letter, and a due\r\npreparation for proceeding against me in a court of justice, there have\r\nbeen two printed papers clandestinely spread about, whereof no man is\r\nable to trace the original further than by conjecture, which with its\r\nusual charity lays them to my account. The former is entitled,\r\n\"Seasonable Advice,\"[18] and appears to have been intended for\r\ninformation of the grand jury, upon the supposition of a bill to be\r\nprepared against that letter. The other[19] is an extract from a printed\r\nbook of Parliamentary Proceedings in the year 1680 containing an angry\r\nresolution of the House of Commons in England against dissolving grand\r\njuries. As to the former, your lordship will find it to be the work of a\r\nmore artful hand than that of a common Drapier. It hath been censured\r\nfor endeavouring to influence the minds of a jury, which ought to be\r\nwholly free and unbiassed, and for that reason it is manifest that no\r\njudge was ever known either upon or off the bench, either by himself or\r\nhis dependents, to use the least insinuation that might possibly affect\r\nthe passions or interests of any one single juryman, much less of a\r\nwhole jury; whereof every man must be convinced who will just give\r\nhimself the trouble to dip into the common printed trials; so as, it is\r\namazing to think, what a number of upright judges there have been in\r\nboth kingdoms for above sixty years past, which, considering how long\r\nthey held their offices during pleasure, as they still do among us, I\r\naccount next to a miracle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: See p. 123. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See note on p. 127. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAs to the other paper I must confess it is a sharp censure of an English\r\nHouse of Commons against dissolving grand juries by any judge before the\r\nend of the term, assizes, or sessions, while matters are under their\r\nconsideration, and not presented; is arbitrary, illegal, destructive to\r\npublic justice, a manifest violation of his oath, and is a means to\r\nsubvert the fundamental laws of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nHowever, the publisher seems to have been mistaken in what he aimed at.\r\nFor, whatever dependence there may be of Ireland upon England, I hope he\r\nwould not insinuate, that the proceedings of a lord chief justice in\r\nIreland must depend upon a resolution of an English House of Commons.\r\nBesides, that resolution although it were levelled against a particular\r\nlord chief justice, Sir William Scroggs,[20] yet the occasion was\r\ndirectly contrary: For Scroggs dissolved the grand jury of London for\r\nfear they should present, but ours in Dublin was dissolved because they\r\nwould not present, which wonderfully alters the case. And therefore a\r\nsecond grand jury supplied that defect by making a presentment[21] that\r\nhath pleased the whole kingdom. However I think it is agreed by all\r\nparties, that both the one and the other jury behaved themselves in such\r\na manner, as ought to be remembered to their honour, while there shall\r\nbe any regard left among us for virtue or public spirit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Sir William Scroggs (1623?-1683) was appointed Lord Chief\r\nJustice of England on the removal of Sir Thomas Ramsford in 1678. One of\r\nthe eight articles of impeachment against Scroggs, in 1680, was for\r\nillegally discharging the grand jury of Middlesex before the end of the\r\nterm. Although the articles of impeachment were carried to the House of\r\nLords in 1681, the proceedings went no farther than ordering him to find\r\nbail and file his answer by a certain time. Scroggs was removed, on\r\naccount of his unpopularity, on April 11th, 1681. As a lawyer, Scroggs\r\nhas no great reputation; as a judge he must be classed with the\r\nnotorious Jeffreys. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: See Appendix No. V. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nI am confident your lordship will be of my sentiments in one thing, that\r\nsome short plain authentic tract might be published for the information\r\nboth of petty and grand juries, how far their power reacheth, and where\r\nit is limited, and that a printed copy of such a treatise might be\r\ndeposited in every court, to be consulted by the jurymen before they\r\nconsider of their verdict; by which abundance of inconveniences would be\r\navoided, whereof innumerable instances might be produced from former\r\ntimes, because I will say nothing of the present.\r\n\r\nI have read somewhere of an eastern king who put a judge to death for an\r\niniquitous sentence, and ordered his hide to be stuffed into a cushion,\r\nand placed upon the tribunal for the son to sit on, who was preferred to\r\nhis father's office. I fancy such a memorial might not have been\r\nunuseful to a son of Sir William Scroggs, and that both he and his\r\nsuccessors would often wriggle in their seats as long as the cushion\r\nlasted. I wish the relater had told us what number of such cushions\r\nthere might be in that country.\r\n\r\nI cannot but observe to your lordship how nice and dangerous a point it\r\nis grown for a private person to inform the people even in an affair\r\nwhere the public interest and safety are so highly concerned as that of\r\nMr. Wood, and this in a country where loyalty is woven into the very\r\nhearts of the people, seems a little extraordinary. Sir William Scroggs\r\nwas the first who introduced that commendable acuteness into the courts\r\nof judicature; but how far this practice hath been imitated by his\r\nsuccessors or strained upon occasion, is out of my knowledge. When\r\npamphlets unpleasing to the ministry were presented as libels, he would\r\norder the offensive paragraphs to be read before him, and said it was\r\nstrange that the judges and lawyers of the King's Bench should be duller\r\nthan all the people of England; and he was often so very happy in\r\napplying the initial letters of names, and expounding dubious hints (the\r\ntwo common expedients among writers of that class for escaping the law)\r\nthat he discovered much more than ever the authors intended, as many of\r\nthem or their printers found to their cost. If such methods are to be\r\nfollowed in examining what I have already written or may write hereafter\r\nupon the subject of Mr. Wood, I defy any man of fifty times my\r\nunderstanding and caution to avoid being entrapped, unless he will be\r\ncontent to write what none will read, by repeating over the old\r\narguments and computations, whereof the world is already grown weary. So\r\nthat my good friend Harding lies under this dilemma, either to let my\r\nlearned works hang for ever a drying upon his lines, or venture to\r\npublish them at the hazard of being laid by the heels.\r\n\r\nI need not tell your lordship where the difficulty lies. It is true, the\r\nKing and the laws permit us to refuse this coin of Mr. Wood, but at the\r\nsame time it is equally true, that the King and the laws permit us to\r\nreceive it. Now it is most certain the ministers in England do not\r\nsuppose the consequences of uttering that brass among us to be so\r\nruinous as we apprehend; because doubtless if they understood it in that\r\nlight, they are persons of too much honour and justice not to use their\r\ncredit with His Majesty for saving a most loyal kingdom from\r\ndestruction. But as long as it shall please those great persons to think\r\nthat coin will not be so very pernicious to us, we lie under the\r\ndisadvantage of being censured as obstinate in not complying with a\r\nroyal patent. Therefore nothing remains, but to make use of that liberty\r\nwhich the King and the laws have left us, by continuing to refuse this\r\ncoin, and by frequent remembrances to keep up that spirit raised against\r\nit, which otherwise may be apt to flag, and perhaps in time to sink\r\naltogether. For, any public order against receiving or uttering Mr.\r\nWood's halfpence is not reasonably to be expected in this kingdom,\r\nwithout directions from England, which I think nobody presumes, or is so\r\nsanguine to hope.\r\n\r\nBut to confess the truth, my lord, I begin to grow weary of my office as\r\na writer, and could heartily wish it were devolved upon my brethren, the\r\nmakers of songs and ballads, who perhaps are the best qualified at\r\npresent to gather up the gleanings of this controversy. As to myself, it\r\nhath been my misfortune to begin and pursue it upon a wrong foundation.\r\nFor having detected the frauds and falsehoods of this vile impostor Wood\r\nin every part, I foolishly disdained to have recourse to whining,\r\nlamenting, and crying for mercy, but rather chose to appeal to law and\r\nliberty and the common rights of mankind, without considering the\r\nclimate I was in.\r\n\r\nSince your last residence in Ireland, I frequently have taken my nag to\r\nride about your grounds, where I fancied myself to feel an air of\r\nfreedom breathing round me, and I am glad the low condition of a\r\ntradesman did not qualify me to wait on you at your house, for then I am\r\nafraid my writings would not have escaped severer censures. But I have\r\nlately sold my nag, and honestly told his greatest fault, which was that\r\nof snuffing up the air about Brackdenstown, whereby he became such a\r\nlover of liberty, that I could scarce hold him in. I have likewise\r\nburied at the bottom of a strong chest your lordship's writings under a\r\nheap of others that treat of liberty, and spread over a layer or two of\r\nHobbes, Filmer, Bodin[22] and many more authors of that stamp, to be\r\nreadiest at hand whenever I shall be disposed to take up a new set of\r\nprinciples in government. In the mean time I design quietly to look to\r\nmy shop, and keep as far out of your lordship's influence as possible;\r\nand if you ever see any more of my writings upon this subject, I promise\r\nyou shall find them as innocent, as insipid and without a sting as what\r\nI have now offered you. But if your lordship will please to give me an\r\neasy lease of some part of your estate in Yorkshire,[23] thither will I\r\ncarry my chest and turning it upside down, resume my political reading\r\nwhere I left it off; feed on plain homely fare, and live and die a free\r\nhonest English farmer: But not without regret for leaving my countrymen\r\nunder the dread of the brazen talons of Mr. Wood: My most loyal and\r\ninnocent countrymen, to whom I owe so much for their good opinion of me,\r\nand of my poor endeavours to serve them,\r\n\r\nI am\r\n  with the greatest respect,\r\n           My Lord\r\n    Your Lordship's most obedient\r\n              and most humble servant,\r\n                                     M.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my shop\r\nin St. Francis-Street,\r\nDec. 14.\r\n1724.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Sir Robert Filmer, the political writer who suffered for\r\nhis adhesion to the cause of Charles I.

DRAPIER.\r\n\r\n\"Multa gemens ignominiam Plagasque superbi Victoris.--\"\r\n\r\n[VIRGIL, _Georg. III._, 226-7.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was published in the fourth volume of the collected edition\r\nof Swift's Works, issued by Faulkner, in Dublin, in 1735. It is there\r\nstated that it was written \"before the Lord Carteret came over, and soon\r\nafter the fourth Drapier's letter.\" If Faulkner be correct, and he\r\nprobably is, the subject matter of the letter shows that it was not to\r\nbe printed until after the agitation had subsided. The letter is in an\r\nentirely different spirit from the other letters, and deals with\r\nsuggestions and methods of action for a general righting of the wrongs\r\nunder which Ireland was suffering. In matter as well as in manner it is\r\nnot a continuation of the contest against Wood, but an effort to send\r\nthe people along paths which would lead to their general welfare and\r\nprosperity. As such it properly concludes the Drapier series.\r\n\r\nThe text of the letter here printed is that of Faulkner collated with\r\nthat given in the fifth volume of \"Miscellanies,\" issued in London in.\r\n1735.\r\n\r\n[T.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\nAN HUMBLE ADDRESS TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been told, that petitions and addresses, either to King or\r\nParliament, are the right of every subject; providing they consist with\r\nthat respect, which is due to princes and great assemblies. Neither do I\r\nremember, that the modest proposals, or opinions of private men, have\r\nbeen ill-received, when they have not been delivered in the style of\r\nadvice; which is a presumption far from my thoughts. However, if\r\nproposals should be looked upon as too assuming; yet I hope, every man\r\nmay be suffered to declare his own and the nation's wishes. For\r\ninstance; I may be allowed to wish, that some further laws were enacted\r\nfor the advancement of trade, for the improvement of agriculture, now\r\nstrangely neglected, against the maxim of all wise nations: For\r\nsupplying the manifest defects in the acts concerning plantation of\r\ntrees: For setting the poor to work, and many others.\r\n\r\nUpon this principle, I may venture to affirm; it is the hearty wish of\r\nthe whole nation, very few excepted; that the Parliament in this session\r\nwould begin by strictly examining into the detestable fraud of one\r\nWilliam Wood, now or late of London, hardwareman; who illegally and\r\nclandestinely, as appears by your own votes and addresses, procured a\r\npatent in England, for coining halfpence in that kingdom, to be current\r\nhere. This, I say, is the wish of the whole nation, very few excepted;\r\nand upon account of those few, is more strongly and justly the wish of\r\nthe rest: Those few consisting either of Wood's confederates, some\r\nobscure tradesmen, or certain bold UNDERTAKERS[1] of weak judgment, and\r\nstrong ambition; who think to find their accounts in the ruin of the\r\nnation, by securing or advancing themselves. And, because such men\r\nproceed upon a system of politics, to which I would fain hope you will\r\nbe always utter strangers, I shall humbly lay it before you.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This was a phrase used in the time of Charles II. to\r\nexpress those dashing ministers who obtained power by undertaking to\r\ncarry through particular favourite measures of the crown. But the Dean\r\napplies it with his usual studied ambiguity, so that it may be explained\r\nas meaning schemers or projectors in general. [S.]]\r\n\r\nBe pleased to suppose me in a station of fifteen hundred pounds a year,\r\nsalary and perquisites; and likewise possessed of 800_l_. a year, real\r\nestate. Then, suppose a destructive project to be set on foot; such, for\r\ninstance, as this of Wood; which if it succeed, in all the consequences\r\nnaturally to be expected from it, must sink the rents and wealth of the\r\nkingdom one half, (although I am confident, it would have done so\r\nfive-sixths.) Suppose, I conceive that the countenancing, or privately\r\nsupporting this project, will please those by whom I expect to be\r\npreserved, or higher exalted. Nothing then remains, but to compute and\r\nbalance my gain and my loss, and sum up the whole. I suppose that I\r\nshall keep my employment ten years, (not to mention the fair chance of a\r\nbetter.) This at 1500_l_. a year, amounts, in ten years, to 15,000_l_.\r\nMy estate, by the success of the said project, sinks 400_l_. a year;\r\nwhich at twenty years' purchase, is but 8000_l_. so that I am a clean\r\ngainer of 7000_l_. upon the balance. And during all that period, I am\r\npossessed of power and credit, can gratify my favourites, and take\r\nvengeance of mine enemies. And if the project miscarry, my private merit\r\nis still entire. This arithmetic, as horrible as it appears, I knowingly\r\naffirm to have been practised, and applied in conjunctures, whereon\r\ndepended the ruin or safety of a nation: Although, probably the charity\r\nand virtue of a senate, will hardly be induced to believe, that there\r\ncan be such monsters among mankind. And yet, the wise Lord Bacon\r\nmentions a sort of people, (I doubt the race is not yet extinct) who\r\nwould \"set a house on fire, for the convenience of roasting their own\r\neggs at the flame.\"\r\n\r\nBut whoever is old enough to remember, and hath turned his thoughts to\r\nobserve the course of public affairs in this kingdom, from the time of\r\nthe Revolution; must acknowledge, that the highest points of interest\r\nand liberty, have been often sacrificed to the avarice and ambition of\r\nparticular persons, upon the very principles and arithmetic that I have\r\nsupposed: The only wonder is, how these artists were able to prevail\r\nupon numbers; and influence even public assemblies to become instruments\r\nfor effecting their execrable designs.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, in all conscience, latitude enough for vice, if a man in\r\nstation be allowed to act injustice, upon the usual principles of\r\ngetting a bribe, wreaking his malice, serving his party, or consulting\r\nhis preferment; while his wickedness terminates in the ruin only of\r\nparticular persons: But, to deliver up our whole country, and every\r\nliving soul who inhabits it, to certain destruction; hath not, as I\r\nremember, been permitted by the most favourable casuists on the side of\r\ncorruption. It were far better, that all who have had the misfortune to\r\nbe born in this kingdom, should be rendered incapable of holding any\r\nemployment whatsoever, above the degree of a constable, (according to\r\nthe scheme and intention of a great minister[2] _gone to his own\r\nplace_)than to live under the daily apprehension of a few false brethren\r\namong ourselves. Because, in the former case we should be wholly free\r\nfrom the danger of being betrayed; since none could then have impudence\r\nenough to pretend any public good.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Earl of Sunderland. See note on p. 377 of vol. _v._ of\r\npresent edition. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nIt is true, that in this desperate affair of the new halfpence, I have\r\nnot heard of any man above my own degree of a shopkeeper, to have been\r\nhitherto so bold, as, in direct terms, to vindicate the fatal project;\r\nalthough I have been told of some very mollifying expressions which were\r\nused, and very gentle expedients proposed and handed about, when it\r\nfirst came under debate: But, since the eyes of the people have been so\r\nfar opened, that the most ignorant can plainly see their own ruin, in\r\nthe success of Wood's attempt; these grand compounders have been more\r\ncautious.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Alluding to Walpole's overture for reducing the amount to\r\nbe coined to £40,000. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut that the same spirit still subsists, hath manifestly appeared (among\r\nother instances of great compliance) from certain circumstances, that\r\nhave attended some late proceedings in a court of judicature. There is\r\nnot any commonplace more frequently insisted on, by those who treat of\r\nour constitution, than the great happiness and excellency of trials by\r\njuries; yet if this blessed part of our law be eludible at pleasure, by\r\nthe force of power, frowns, and artifice; we shall have little reason to\r\nboast of our advantage, in this particular, over other states or\r\nkingdoms in Europe. And surely, these high proceedings, exercised in a\r\npoint that so nearly concerned the life-blood of the people, their\r\nnecessary subsistence, their very food and raiment, and even the public\r\npeace; will not allow any favourable appearance; because it was obvious,\r\nthat so much superabundant zeal could have no other design, or produce\r\nany other effect, than to damp that spirit raised in the nation against\r\nthis accursed scheme of William Wood, and his abettors; to which spirit\r\nalone, we owe, and for ever must owe, our being hitherto preserved, and\r\nour hopes of being preserved for the future; if it can be kept up, and\r\nstrongly countenanced by your wise assemblies. I wish I could account\r\nfor such a demeanour upon a more charitable foundation, than that of\r\nputting our interest in over balance with the ruin of our country.\r\n\r\nI remember some months ago, when this affair was fresh in discourse; a\r\nperson near allied to SOMEBODY, or (as the hawkers called him) NOBODY,\r\nwho was thought deeply concerned, went about very diligently among his\r\nacquaintance, to shew the bad consequences that might follow from any\r\npublic resentment to the disadvantage of his ally Mr. Wood; principally\r\nalleging the danger of all employments being disposed of from England.\r\nOne of these emissaries came to me, and urged the same topic: I\r\nanswered, naturally, that I knew there was no office of any kind, which\r\na man from England might not have, if he thought it worth his asking;\r\nand that I looked upon all who had the disadvantage of being born here,\r\nas only in the condition of leasers and gleaners. Neither could I\r\nforbear mentioning the known fable of the countryman, who entreated his\r\nass to fly for fear of being taken by the enemy; but the ass refused to\r\ngive himself that trouble; and upon a very wise reason, because he could\r\nnot possibly change his present master for a worse: The enemy could not\r\nmake him fare harder; beat him more cruelly; nor load him with heavier\r\nburthens.\r\n\r\nUpon these, and many other considerations, I may affirm it to be the\r\nwish of the whole nation, that the power and privileges of juries were\r\ndeclared, ascertained, and confirmed by the legislature; and that\r\nwhoever hath been manifestly known to violate them, might be stigmatized\r\nby public censure; not from any hope that such a censure will amend\r\ntheir practices, or hurt their interest, (for it may probably operate\r\nquite contrary in both:) but that the nation may know their enemies from\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nI say not this with any regard or view to myself; for I write in great\r\nsecurity; and am resolved that none shall merit at my expense further\r\nthan by shewing their zeal to discover, prosecute, and condemn me, for\r\nendeavouring to do my duty in serving my country: And yet I am conscious\r\nto myself that I never had the least intention to reflect on His\r\nMajesty's ministers, nor on any other person, except William Wood, whom\r\nI neither did, nor do yet conceive to be of that number. However, some\r\nwould have it, that I went too far; but I suppose they will now allow\r\nthemselves mistaken. I am sure I might easily have gone further; and I\r\nthink I could not easily have fared worse. And therefore I was no\r\nfurther affected with their proclamation, and subsequent proceedings,\r\nthan a good clergyman is with the sins of the people. And as to the poor\r\nprinter, he is now gone to appear before a higher, and before a\r\nrighteous tribunal.\r\n\r\nAs my intention is only to lay before your great assemblies, the general\r\nwishes of the nation; and as I have already declared it our principal\r\nwish that your first proceeding would be to examine into the pernicious\r\nfraud of William Wood; so I must add, as the universal opinion, that all\r\nschemes of commutation, composition, and the like expedients, either\r\navowed or implied, will be of the most pernicious consequences to the\r\npublic; against the dignity of a free kingdom; and prove an\r\nencouragement to future adventurers in the same destructive projects.\r\nFor, it is a maxim, which no man at present disputes, that even a\r\nconnivance to admit one thousand pounds in these halfpence, will\r\nproduce, in time, the same ruinous effects, as if we openly consented to\r\nadmit a million. It were, therefore, infinitely more safe and eligible,\r\nto leave things in the doubtful, melancholy state they are at present,\r\n(which, however, God forbid) and trust entirely to the general aversion\r\nof our people against this coin; using all honest endeavours to\r\npreserve, continue, and increase that aversion, than submit to apply\r\nthose palliatives which weak, perfidious, or abject politicians, are,\r\nupon all occasions, and in all diseases, so ready to administer.\r\n\r\nIn the small compass of my reading, (which, however, hath been more\r\nextensive than is usual to men of my inferior calling) I have observed\r\nthat grievances have always preceded supplies; and if ever grievances\r\nhad a title to such a pre-eminence, it must be this of Wood; because it\r\nis not only the greatest grievance that any country could suffer, but a\r\ngrievance of such a kind that, if it should take effect, would make it\r\nimpossible for us to give any supplies at all; except in adulterate\r\ncopper; unless a tax were laid for paying the civil and military lists,\r\nand the large pensions, with real commodities instead of money; which,\r\nhowever, might be liable to some few objections as well as difficulties:\r\nFor although the common soldiers might be content with beef and mutton,\r\nand wool, and malt, and leather; yet I am in some doubt as to the\r\ngenerals, the colonels, the numerous pensioners, the civil officers, and\r\nothers, who all live in England upon Irish pay; as well as those few who\r\nreside among us only because they cannot help it.\r\n\r\nThere is one particular, which although I have mentioned more than once\r\nin some of my former papers, yet I cannot forbear to repeat, and a\r\nlittle enlarge upon it; because I do not remember to have read or heard\r\nof the like in the history of any age or country; neither do I ever\r\nreflect upon it without the utmost astonishment.\r\n\r\nAfter the unanimous addresses to his Sacred Majesty, against this patent\r\nof Wood, from both Houses of Parliament, which are the three estates of\r\nthe kingdom; and likewise an address from the Privy-council, to whom,\r\nunder the chief governors, the whole administration is entrusted; the\r\nmatter is referred to a committee of council in London. Wood, and his\r\nadherents, are heard on one side; and a few volunteers, without any\r\ntrust or direction from hence, on the other. The question (as I\r\nremember) chiefly turned upon the want of halfpence in Ireland:\r\nWitnesses are called on the behalf of Wood (of what credit I have\r\nformerly shewn :) Upon the issue the patent is found good and legal; all\r\nHis Majesty's officers here, (not excepting the military) commanded to\r\nbe aiding and assisting to make it effectual. The addresses of both\r\nHouses of Parliament, of the Privy-council; and of the city of Dublin:\r\nThe declarations of most counties and corporations through the kingdom,\r\nare altogether laid aside, as of no weight, consequence, or\r\nconsideration whatsoever: And the whole kingdom of Ireland nonsuited, in\r\ndefault of appearance; as if it were a private cause between John Doe,\r\nplaintiff, and William Roe, defendant.\r\n\r\nWith great respect to those-honourable persons, the committee of council\r\nin London, I have not understood them to be our governors, councillors,\r\nor judges. Neither did our case turn at all upon the question, whether\r\nIreland wanted halfpence or no. For there is no doubt, but we do want\r\nboth halfpence, gold, and silver; and we have numberless other wants,\r\nand some that we are not so much as allowed to name; although they are\r\npeculiar to this nation; to which no other is subject, whom God hath\r\nblessed with religion and laws, or any degree of soil and sunshine: But,\r\nfor what demerits on our side, I am altogether in the dark.\r\n\r\nBut, I do not remember, that our want of halfpence was either affirmed,\r\nor denied in any of our addresses or declarations, against those of\r\nWood: We alleged, the fraudulent obtaining and executing his patent, the\r\nbaseness of his metal, the prodigious sum to be coined, which might be\r\nincreased by stealth, from foreign importation and his own counterfeits,\r\nas well as those at home; whereby we must infallibly lose all our little\r\ngold and silver, and all our poor remainder of a very limited and\r\ndiscouraged trade: We urged, that the patent was passed without the\r\nleast reference hither; and without mention of any security given by\r\nWood, to receive his own halfpence upon demand; both which are contrary\r\nto all former proceedings in the like cases. These, and many other\r\narguments we offered; but still the patent went on, and at this day our\r\nruin would have been half completed; if God, in His mercy, had not\r\nraised an universal detestation of these halfpence, in the whole\r\nkingdom; with a firm resolution never to receive them; since we are not\r\nunder obligations to do so by any law, either human or divine.\r\n\r\nBut, in the Name of God, and of all justice and piety; when the King's\r\nMajesty was pleased that this patent should pass; is it not to be\r\nunderstood, that he conceived, believed, and intended it as a gracious\r\nact, for the good and benefit of his subjects, for the advantage of a\r\ngreat and fruitful kingdom; of the most loyal kingdom upon earth, where\r\nno hand or voice was ever lifted up against him; a kingdom where the\r\npassage is not of three hours from Britain; and a kingdom where Papists\r\nhave less power, and less land, than in England? Can it be denied, or\r\ndoubted, that His Majesty's ministers understood and proposed the same\r\nend, the good of this nation, when they advised the passing this patent?\r\nCan the person of Wood be otherwise regarded, than as the instrument,\r\nthe mechanic, the head-workman, to prepare his furnace, his fuel, his\r\nmetal, and his stamps? If I employ a shoe-boy, is it in view to his\r\nadvantage, or to my own convenience? I mention the person of William\r\nWood alone, because no other appears, and we are not to reason upon\r\nsurmises; neither would it avail, if they had a real foundation.\r\n\r\nAllowing therefore, (for we cannot do less) that this patent, for the\r\ncoining of halfpence, was wholly intended, by a gracious king, and a\r\nwise public-spirited ministry, for the advantage of Ireland; yet when\r\nthe whole kingdom to a man, for whose good the patent was designed, do,\r\nupon maturest consideration, universally join, in openly declaring,\r\nprotesting, addressing, petitioning, against these halfpence, as the\r\nmost ruinous project that ever was set on foot, to complete the slavery\r\nand destruction of a poor innocent country: Is it, was it, can it, or\r\nwill it ever be a question, not whether such a kingdom, or William Wood,\r\nshould be a gainer; but whether such a kingdom should be wholly undone,\r\ndestroyed, sunk, depopulated, made a scene of misery and desolation, for\r\nthe sake of William Wood? God, of His infinite mercy, avert this\r\ndreadful judgment; and it is our universal wish, that God would put it\r\ninto your hearts to be His instruments for so good a work.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, who am but one man, of obscure condition, I do solemnly\r\ndeclare, in the presence of Almighty God, that I will suffer the most\r\nignominious and torturing death, rather than submit to receive this\r\naccursed coin, or any other that shall be liable to the same objections,\r\nuntil they shall be forced upon me, by a law of my own country; and if\r\nthat shall ever happen, I will transport myself into some foreign land,\r\nand eat the bread of poverty among a free people.\r\n\r\nAm I legally punishable for these expressions? Shall another\r\nproclamation issue against me, because I presume to take my country's\r\npart against William Wood; where her final destruction is intended? But,\r\nwhenever you shall please to impose silence upon me, I will submit;\r\nbecause, I look upon your unanimous voice to be the voice of the nation;\r\nand this I have been taught, and do believe to be, in some manner, the\r\nvoice of God.\r\n\r\nThe great ignominy of a whole kingdom, lying so long at mercy, under so\r\nvile an adversary, is such a deplorable aggravation, that the utmost\r\nexpressions of shame and rage, are too low to set it forth; and\r\ntherefore, I shall leave it to receive such a resentment, as is worthy\r\nof a parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise our universal wish, that His Majesty would grant liberty\r\nto coin halfpence in this kingdom, for our own use; under such\r\nrestrictions as a parliament here shall advise: Since the power of\r\ncoining even gold and silver, is possessed by every petty prince abroad;\r\nand was always practised by Scotland, to the very time of the Union; yet\r\nsurely Scotland, as to soil, climate, and extent, is not, in itself, a\r\nfourth part the value of Ireland; (for Bishop Burnet says, it is not\r\nabove a fortieth part in value, to the rest of Britain) and with respect\r\nto the profit that England gains from hence, not the forty thousandth\r\npart. Although I must confess, that a mote in the eye, or a thorn in the\r\nside, is more dangerous and painful than a beam, or a spike at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe histories of England, and of most other countries, abound in\r\nrelating the miserable, and sometimes the most tragical effects, from\r\nthe abuses of coin; by debasing the metal, by lessening, or enhancing\r\nthe value upon occasions, to the public loss; of which we have an\r\nexample, within our own memory in England, and another very lately in\r\nFrance. It is the tenderest point of government, affecting every\r\nindividual, in the highest degree. When the value of money is arbitrary,\r\nor unsettled; no man can well be said to have any property at all; nor\r\nis any wound so suddenly felt, so hardly cured, or that leaves such deep\r\nand lasting scars behind it.\r\n\r\nI conceive this poor unhappy island, to have a title to some indulgence\r\nfrom England; not only upon the score of Christianity, natural equity,\r\nand the general rights of mankind; but chiefly on account of that\r\nimmense profit they receive from us; without which, that kingdom would\r\nmake a very different figure in Europe, from what it doth at present.\r\n\r\nThe rents of land in Ireland, since they have been of late so enormously\r\nraised, and screwed up, may be computed to about two millions; whereof\r\none-third part, at least, is directly transmitted to those, who are\r\nperpetual absentees in England; as I find by a computation made with the\r\nassistance of several skilful gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThe other articles by which we are altogether losers, and England a\r\ngainer; we found to amount to almost as much more. I will only set down\r\nas many heads of them as I can remember; and leave them to the\r\nconsideration of those, who understand accounts better than I pretend to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe occasional absentees, for business, health, or diversion.\r\n\r\nThree-fourths of the revenue of the chief governor, during his absence;\r\nwhich is usually four-fifths of his government.\r\n\r\nThe whole revenue of the post-office.\r\n\r\nThe numerous pensions paid to persons in England.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the chief officers of the army absent in England, which is a\r\ngreat sum.\r\n\r\nFour commissioners of the revenue, always absent.\r\n\r\nCivil employments very numerous, and of great income.\r\n\r\nThe vast charge of appeals to the House of Lords, and to the Court of\r\nDelegates.\r\n\r\nStudents at the Inns of Court, and the two Universities.\r\n\r\nEighty thousand pounds sent yearly to England, for coals; whereof the\r\nprime cost is nothing; and therefore, the profit wholly theirs.\r\n\r\nOne hundred thousand pounds paid several years past, for corn sent over\r\nhither from England; the effect of our own great wisdom in discouraging\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nThe kind liberty granted us of wearing Indian stuffs, and calicoes, to\r\ngratify the vanity and folly of our women; which, beside the profit to\r\nEngland, is an unconceivable loss to us; forcing the weavers to beg in\r\nour streets, or transport themselves to foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious loss to us, and gain to England, by selling them all our\r\nwool at their own rates; whereof the manufacture exceeds above ten times\r\nthe prime cost: A proceeding without example in the Christian or heathen\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOur own wool returned upon us, in English manufactures, to our infinite\r\nshame and damage; and the great advantage of England.\r\n\r\nThe full profit of all our mines accruing to England; an effect of great\r\nnegligence and stupidity.\r\n\r\nAn affectation among us, of liking all kinds of goods made in England.\r\n\r\nNOTE, Many of the above articles have been since particularly computed\r\nby another writer, to whose treatise the reader is referred.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The work referred to is \"A List of the Absentees of\r\nIreland, and the yearly value of their estates and Incomes spent\r\nabroad,\" by Thomas Prior, Esq. Prior was a native of Ireland and the\r\nschoolfellow and life-long friend of Berkeley, the philosopher. In\r\nconcert with Samuel Madden and other friends, he founded, in 1731, the\r\nDublin Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, Manufactures, Arts and\r\nSciences. This society was the parent of the present Royal Dublin\r\nSociety. His \"List of the Absentees of Ireland\" was published in 1729.\r\nHe also issued \"Observations on Coin\" (1730), and \"An Authentic\r\nNarrative of the Success of Tar Water in Curing a great number and\r\nvariety of Distempers\" (1746), to which Berkeley contributed. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nThese and many other articles, which I cannot recollect at present, are\r\nagreed by judicious men to amount to near seven hundred thousand pounds\r\n_per ann_. clear profit to England. And, upon the whole, let any man\r\nlook into those authors who write upon the subject of commerce, he shall\r\nfind, that there is not one single article in the essentials, or\r\ncircumstances of trade, whereby a country can be a loser, which we do\r\nnot possess in the highest perfection; somewhat, in every particular,\r\nthat bears a kind of analogy to William Wood; and now the branches are\r\nall cut off, he stands ready with his axe at the root.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject of perpetual absentees, I have spent some time in very\r\ninsignificant reflections; and considering the usual motives of human\r\nactions, which are pleasure, profit, and ambition, I cannot yet\r\ncomprehend how those persons find their account in any of the three. I\r\nspeak not of those English peers or gentlemen, who, beside their estates\r\nat home, have possessions here; for, in that case, the matter is\r\ndesperate; but I mean those lords, and wealthy knights, or squires,\r\nwhose birth, and partly their education, and all their fortune (except\r\nsome trifle, and that in very few instances) are in this kingdom. I knew\r\nmany of them well enough, during several years, when I resided in\r\nEngland; and truly I could not discover that the figure they made was,\r\nby any means, a subject for envy; at least it gave me two very different\r\npassions: For, excepting the advantage of going now and then to an\r\nopera, or sometimes appearing behind a crowd at Court; or adding to the\r\nring of coaches in Hyde Park, or losing their money at the Chocolate\r\nHouse; or getting news, votes, and minutes, about five days before us in\r\nDublin, I say, besides these, and a few other privileges of less\r\nimportance, their temptations to live in London, were beyond my\r\nknowledge or conception. And I used to wonder, how a man of birth and\r\nspirit, could endure to be wholly insignificant and obscure in a foreign\r\ncountry, when he might live with lustre in his own; and even at less\r\nthan half that expense, which he strains himself to make, without\r\nobtaining any one end; except that which happened to the frog when he\r\nwould needs contend for size with the ox. I have been told by scholars,\r\nthat Caesar said, he would rather be the first man, in I know not what\r\nvillage, than the second in Rome. This, perhaps, was a thought only fit\r\nfor Caesar: But to be preceded by thousands, and neglected by millions;\r\nto be wholly without power, figure, influence, honour, credit, or\r\ndistinction, is not, in my poor opinion, a very amiable situation of\r\nlife, to a person of title, or wealth, who can so cheaply and easily\r\nshine in his native country.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the depopulating of the kingdom, the leaving so many parts\r\nof it wild and uncultivated, the ruin of so many country-seats and\r\nplantations, the cutting down all the woods to supply expenses in\r\nEngland; the absence of so many noble and wealthy persons, hath been the\r\ncause of another fatal consequence, which few perhaps have been aware\r\nof. For if that very considerable number of lords, who possess the\r\namplest fortunes here, had been content to live at home, and attend the\r\naffairs of their own country in Parliament; the weight, reputation, and\r\ndignity thereby added to that noble House, would, in all human\r\nprobability, have prevented certain proceedings, which are now ever to\r\nbe lamented; because they never can be remedied: And we might have then\r\ndecided our own properties among ourselves, without being forced to\r\ntravel five hundred miles by sea and land, to another kingdom, for\r\njustice; to our infinite expense, vexation, and trouble: Which is a mark\r\nof servitude without example, from the practice of any age or nation in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes wondered, upon what motive the peerage of England were\r\nso desirous to determine our controversies; because I have been assured,\r\nand partly know, that the frequent appeals from hence, have been very\r\nirksome to that illustrious body; and whoever hath frequented the\r\nPainted Chamber, and Court of Requests, must have observed, that they\r\nare never so nobly filled, as when an Irish appeal is under debate.\r\n\r\nThe peers of Scotland, who are very numerous, were content to reside in\r\ntheir castles and houses, in that bleak and barren climate; and although\r\nsome of them made frequent journeys to London, yet I do not remember any\r\nof their greatest families, till very lately, to have made England their\r\nconstant habitation, before the Union: Or, if they did, I am sure it was\r\ngenerally to their own advantage; and whatever they got, was employed to\r\ncultivate and increase their own estates; and by that means enrich\r\nthemselves and their country.\r\n\r\nAs to the great number of rich absentees, under the degree of peers;\r\nwhat particular ill effects their absence may have upon this kingdom,\r\nbesides those already mentioned, may perhaps be too tender a point for\r\nme to touch. But whether those who live in another kingdom, upon great\r\nestates here; and have lost all regards to their own country, further\r\nthan upon account of the revenues they receive from it: I say, whether\r\nsuch persons may not be prevailed on to recommend others to vacant\r\nseats, who have no interest here, except a precarious employment; and\r\nconsequently can have no views, but to preserve what they have got, or\r\nto be higher advanced: This, I am sure, is a very melancholy question,\r\nif it be a question at all.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the prodigious profit which England receives by the\r\ntransmittal thither of two-thirds of the revenues of this whole kingdom;\r\nit hath another mighty advantage by making our country a receptacle,\r\nwherein to disburthen themselves of their supernumerary pretenders to\r\noffices; persons of second-rate merit in their own country; who, like\r\nbirds of passage, most of them thrive and fatten here, and fly off when\r\ntheir credit and employments are at an end. So that Ireland may justly\r\nsay what Luther said of himself; POOR Ireland maketh many rich.\r\n\r\nIf amidst all our difficulties, I should venture to assert, that we have\r\none great advantage, provided we could improve it as we ought; I believe\r\nmost of my readers would be long in conjecturing what possible advantage\r\ncould ever fall to our share. However, it is certain, that all the\r\nregular seeds of party and faction among us are entirely rooted out, and\r\nif any new ones shall spring up, they must be of equivocal generation,\r\nwithout any seed at all; and will justly be imputed to a degree of\r\nstupidity beyond even what we have been ever charged with upon the score\r\nof our birth-place and climate.\r\n\r\nThe parties in this kingdom (including those of modern date) are, First,\r\nof those who have been charged or suspected to favour the Pretender; and\r\nthose who were zealous opposers of him. Secondly, of those who were for\r\nand against a toleration of Dissenters by law. Thirdly, of High and Low\r\nChurch; or, (to speak in the cant of the times) of Whig and Tory: And,\r\nFourthly, of court and country. If there be any more, they are beyond my\r\nobservation or politics: For as to subaltern or occasional parties, they\r\nhave all been derivations from the same originals.\r\n\r\nNow, it is manifest, that all these incitements to faction, party, and\r\ndivision are wholly removed from among us. For, as to the Pretender, his\r\ncause is both desperate and obsolete: There are very few now alive who\r\nwere _men_ in his father's time, and in that prince's interest; and in\r\nall others, the obligation of conscience hath no place;[5] even the\r\nPapists in general, of any substance, or estates, and their priests\r\nalmost universally, are what we call Whigs in the sense which by that\r\nword is generally understood. They feel the smart, and see the scars of\r\ntheir former wounds; and very well know, that they must be made a\r\nsacrifice to the least attempts towards a change; although it cannot be\r\ndoubted, that they would be glad to have their superstition restored,\r\nunder any prince whatsoever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: That is to say, they had not sworn any allegiance to him.\r\n[T.S.]]\r\n\r\nSecondly, The Dissenters are now tolerated by law; neither do we observe\r\nany murmurs at present from that quarter, except those reasonable\r\ncomplaints they make of persecution, because they are excluded from\r\ncivil employments; but their number being very small in either House of\r\nParliament, they are not yet in a situation to erect a party: Because,\r\nhowever indifferent men may be with regard to religion, they are now\r\ngrown wise enough to know, that if such a latitude were allowed to\r\nDissenters; the few small employments left us in cities and\r\ncorporations, would find other hands to lay hold on them.\r\n\r\nThirdly, The dispute between High and Low Church is now at an end;\r\ntwo-thirds of the bishops having been promoted in this reign, and most\r\nof them from England, who have bestowed all preferments in their gift to\r\nthose they could well confide in: The deaneries all except three, and\r\nmany principal church-livings, are in the donation of the crown: So that\r\nwe already possess such a body of clergy as will never engage in\r\ncontroversy upon that antiquated and exploded subject.\r\n\r\nLastly, As to court and country parties, so famous and avowed under most\r\nreigns in English Parliaments: This kingdom hath not, for several years\r\npast been a proper scene whereon to exercise such contentions; and is\r\nnow less proper than ever; many great employments for life being in\r\ndistant hands, and the reversions diligently watched and secured; the\r\ntemporary ones of any inviting value are all bestowed elsewhere as fast\r\nas they drop; and the few remaining, are of too low consideration to\r\ncreate contests about them, except among younger brothers, or tradesmen\r\nlike myself. And, therefore, to institute a court and country party\r\nwithout materials, would be a very new system in politics, and what I\r\nbelieve was never thought on before; nor, unless in a nation of idiots,\r\ncan ever succeed. For the most ignorant Irish cottager will not sell his\r\ncow for a groat.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I conclude, that all party and faction, with regard to public\r\nproceedings, are now extinguished in this kingdom; neither doth it\r\nappear in view how they can possibly revive; unless some new causes be\r\nadministered; which cannot be done without crossing the interests of\r\nthose who are greatest gainers by continuing the same measures. And,\r\ngeneral calamities without hope of redress, are allowed to be the great\r\nuniters of mankind.\r\n\r\nHowever we may dislike the causes; yet this effect of begetting an\r\nuniversal concord among us in all national debates, as well as in\r\ncities, corporations, and country neighbourhoods, may keep us at least\r\nalive, and in a condition to eat the little bread allowed us in peace\r\nand amity. I have heard of a quarrel in a tavern, where all were at\r\ndaggers-drawing, till one of the company cried out, desiring to know the\r\nsubject of the quarrel; which, when none of them could tell, they put up\r\ntheir swords, sat down, and passed the rest of the evening in quiet. The\r\nformer part hath been our case; I hope the latter will be so too; that\r\nwe shall sit down amicably together, at least until we have something\r\nthat may give us a title to fall out; since nature hath instructed even\r\na brood of goslings to stick together while the kite is hovering over\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that a firm union in any country, where every man wishes\r\nthe same thing with relation to the public, may, in several points of\r\nthe greatest importance, in some measure, supply the defect of power;\r\nand even of those rights which are the natural and undoubted inheritance\r\nof mankind. If the universal wish of the nation upon any point, were\r\ndeclared by the unanimous vote of the House of Commons, and a reasonable\r\nnumber of Lords; I should think myself obliged in conscience to act in\r\nmy sphere according to that vote; because, in all free nations, I take\r\nthe proper definition of law to be the will of the majority of those who\r\nhave the property in land; which, if there be a monarchy, is to be\r\nconfirmed by the royal assent. And, although such votes or declarations\r\nhave not received such a confirmation, for certain accidental reasons;\r\nyet I think they ought to be of much weight with the subject; provided\r\nthey neither oppose the King's prerogative, endanger the peace of the\r\nnation, nor infringe any law already in force; none of which, however,\r\ncan reasonably be supposed. Thus, for instance, if nine in ten of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and a reasonable number of native temporal peers,\r\nshould declare, that whoever received or uttered brass coin, except\r\nunder certain limitations and securities, should be deemed as enemies to\r\nthe King and the nation; I should think it a heinous sin in myself to\r\nact contrary to such a vote: And, if the same power should declare the\r\nsame censure against those who wore Indian stuffs and calicoes, or\r\nwoollen manufactures imported from abroad, whereby this nation is\r\nreduced to the lowest ebb of misery; I should readily, heartily, and\r\ncheerfully pay obedience; and to my utmost power persuade others to do\r\nthe like: Because, there is no law of this land obliging us either to\r\nreceive such coin, or to wear such foreign manufactures.\r\n\r\nUpon this last article, I could humbly wish that the reverend the clergy\r\nwould set us an example, by contenting themselves with wearing gowns,\r\nand other habiliments of Irish drapery; which, as it would be some\r\nincitement to the laity, and set many hands to work; so they would find\r\ntheir advantage in the cheapness; which is a circumstance not to be\r\nneglected by too many among that venerable body.[6] And, in order to\r\nthis, I could heartily desire, that the most ingenious artists of the\r\nweaving trade, would contrive some decent stuffs and silks for\r\nclergymen, at reasonable rates.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: This hath since been put in practice, by the persuasions,\r\nand influence of the supposed author; but much defeated by the most\r\ninfamous fraud of shop-keepers. [F.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This scheme was likewise often urged to the weavers by the\r\nsupposed author; but he could never prevail upon them to put it in\r\npractice. [F.]]\r\n\r\nI have pressed several of our most substantial brethren, that the whole\r\ncorporation of weavers in silk and woollen, would publish some\r\nproposals, (I wish they would do it to both Houses of Parliament)\r\ninviting persons of all degrees, and of both sexes, to wear the woollen\r\nand silk manufactures of our own country; entering into solemn, mutual\r\nengagements, that the buyer shall have good, substantial, merchantable\r\nware for his money; and at a certain rate, without the trouble of\r\ncheapening: So that, if I sent a child for a piece of stuff of a\r\nparticular colour and fineness, I should be sure not to be deceived; or\r\nif I had reason to complain, the corporation should give me immediate\r\nsatisfaction; and the name of the tradesman who did me the wrong, should\r\nbe published; and warning given not to deal with him for the future;\r\nunless the matter plainly appeared to be a mistake: For, besides the\r\ntrouble of going from shop to shop; an ignorant customer runs the hazard\r\nof being cheated in the price and goodness of what he buys; being forced\r\nto an unequal combat with a dexterous, and dishonest man, in his own\r\ncalling. Thus our goods fall under a general disreputation; and the\r\ngentry call for English cloth, or silk, from an opinion they have (and\r\noften too justly by our own faults) that the goodness more than makes up\r\nfor the difference of price.\r\n\r\nBesides, it hath been the sottish and ruinous practice of us tradesmen,\r\nupon any great demand of goods, either at home or from abroad, to raise\r\nthe prices immediately, and manufacture the said goods more slightly and\r\nfraudulently than before.\r\n\r\nOf this foul and foolish proceeding, too many instances might be\r\nproduced; and I cannot forbear mentioning one, whereby this poor kingdom\r\nhath received such a fatal blow in the only article of trade allowed us\r\nof any importance that nothing but the success of Wood's project, could\r\noutdo it. During the late plague in France, the Spaniards, who buy their\r\nlinen cloths in that kingdom, not daring to venture thither for fear of\r\ninfection; a very great demand was made here for that commodity, and\r\nexported to Spain: But, whether by the ignorance of the merchants, or\r\ndishonesty of the Northern weavers, or the collusion of both; the ware\r\nwas so bad, and the price so excessive, that except some small\r\nquantity, which was sold below the prime cost, the greatest part was\r\nreturned back: And I have been told by very intelligent persons, that if\r\nwe had been fair dealers, the whole current of the linen trade to Spain\r\nwould have taken its course from hence.\r\n\r\nIf any punishment were to be inflicted on numbers of men; surely there\r\ncould none be thought too great for such a race of traitors, and enemies\r\nto God and their country; who for the prospect of a little present gain,\r\ndo not only ruin themselves, (for that alone would be an example to the\r\nrest, and a blessing to the nation) but sell their souls to hell, and\r\ntheir country to destruction; And, if the plague could have been\r\nconfined only to these who were partakers in the guilt, had it travelled\r\nhither from Marseilles, those wretches would have died with less title\r\nto pity, than a highwayman going to the gallows.\r\n\r\nBut, it happens very unluckily, that, for some time past, all endeavours\r\nor proposals from private persons, to advance the public service;\r\nhowever honestly and innocently designed, have been called _flying in\r\nthe King's face:_ And this, to my knowledge, hath been the style of some\r\npersons, whose ancestors, (I mean those among them who had any) and\r\nthemselves, have been flying in princes' faces these fourscore years;\r\nand from their own inclinations would do so still, if their interest did\r\nnot lead them rather to fly in the face of a kingdom; which hath given\r\nthem wings to enable them for such a flight.\r\n\r\nThus, about four years ago, when a discourse was published, endeavouring\r\nto persuade our people to wear their own woollen manufactures,[8] full\r\nof the most dutiful expressions to the King, and without the least party\r\nhint; it was termed \"flying in the King's face;\" the printer was\r\nprosecuted in the manner we all remember; (and, I hope, it will\r\nsomewhere be remembered further) the jury kept eleven hours, and sent\r\nback nine times, till they were under the necessity of leaving the\r\nprisoner to the mercy of the court, by a special verdict. The judge on\r\nthe bench invoking God for his witness, when he asserted, that the\r\nauthor's design was to bring in the Pretender.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This was Swift's pamphlet entitled, \"A Proposal for the\r\nUniversal Use of Irish Manufactures.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The action and language of Justice Whitshed. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nAnd thus also, my own poor endeavours to prevent the ruin of my country,\r\nby the admission of Wood's coin, was called by the same persons, \"flying\r\nin the King's face;\" which I directly deny: For I cannot allow that\r\nvile representation of the royal countenance in William Wood's\r\nadulterate copper, to be his Sacred Majesty's face; or if it were, my\r\nflying was not against the impression, but the baseness of the metal;\r\nbecause I well remembered; that the image which Nebuchadnezzar\r\n\"commanded to be set up, for all men to fall down and worship it,\" was\r\nnot of _copper_, but pure _gold_. And I am heartily sorry, we have so\r\nfew royal images of that metal among us; the sight whereof, although it\r\ncould hardly increase our veneration for His Majesty, which is already\r\nso great; yet would very much enliven it with a mixture of comfort and\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAlexander the Great, would suffer no statuary, except Phidias, to carve\r\nhis image in stone or metal. How must he have treated such an operator\r\nas Wood, who goes about with sackfuls of dross; odiously misrepresenting\r\nhis Prince's countenance; and would force them, by thousands, upon every\r\none of us, at above six times the value.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding all that hath been objected by William Wood\r\nhimself; together with his favourers, abettors, supporters, either\r\npublic or private; by those who connive at his project, or discourage\r\nand discountenance his opposers, for fear of lessening their favour, or\r\nhazarding their employments; by those who endeavour to damp the spirit\r\nof the people raised against this coin; or check the honest zeal of such\r\nas by their writings, or discourses, do all they can to keep it up:\r\nThose softeners, sweeteners, compounders; and expedient-mongers, who\r\nshake their heads so strongly, that we can hear their pockets jingle; I\r\ndid never imagine, that, in detecting the practices of such enemies to\r\nthe kingdom, I was \"flying in the King's face\"; or thought they were\r\nbetter representers of His Majesty, than that very coin, for which they\r\nare secret or open advocates.\r\n\r\nIf I were allowed to recite only those wishes of the nation, which may\r\nbe in our power to attain; I think they might be summed up in these few\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nFirst, That an end might be put to our apprehensions of Wood's\r\nhalfpence, and to any danger of the like destructive scheme for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nSecondly; That halfpence might be coined in this kingdom, by a public\r\nmint, with due limitations.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That the sense of both Houses of Parliament, at least of the\r\nHouse of Commons, were declared by some unanimous and hearty votes,\r\nagainst wearing any silk or woollen manufactures, imported from abroad,\r\nas likewise against wearing Indian silks or calicoes, which are\r\nforbidden under the highest penalties in England: And it behoves us, to\r\ntake example from so wise a nation; because we are under a greater\r\nnecessity to do so, since we are not allowed to export any woollen\r\nmanufactures of our own; which is the principal branch of foreign trade\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nFourthly, That some effectual methods may be taken to civilize the\r\npoorer sort of our natives, in all those parts of this kingdom where the\r\nIrish abound; by introducing among them our language and customs; for\r\nwant of which they live in the utmost ignorance, barbarity and poverty;\r\ngiving themselves wholly up to idleness, nastiness, and thievery, to the\r\nvery great and just reproach of too many landlords. And, if I had in me\r\nthe least spirit of a projector, I would engage that this might be\r\neffected in a few years, at a very inconsiderable charge.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Since this hint was suggested, several useful seminaries\r\nhave been instituted, under the name of \"Charter Working Schools,\" in\r\nIreland, supported by the royal benefaction of a thousand pounds a year,\r\nby a tax on hawkers and pedlars, and by voluntary subscriptions. The\r\nschools are for the education of boys and girls born of Popish parents;\r\nin most of them, the children manufacture their own clothing, and the\r\nboys are employed in matters relative to husbandry. [F.]\r\n\r\nThese Charter Schools, founded by Marsh, Bishop of Clogher, and adopted\r\nby Primate Boulter in 1733, were intended \"to rescue the souls of\r\nthousands of poor children from the dangers of Popish superstition and\r\nidolatry, and their bodies from the miseries of idleness and beggary.\"\r\nIn reality the scheme was one by which it was hoped to prevent the\r\ngrowth of Catholicism. The conditions and methods of instruction were\r\npositively cruel, since the children were actually withheld from any\r\ncommunication with their parents. Mr. Lecky deals with the subject fully\r\nin the first volume of his \"Ireland in the Eighteenth Century,\" Froude\r\ngives the scheme his praise and admiration, but at the time of its\r\ninstitution it was the cause of \"an intensity of bitterness hardly\r\nequalled by any portion of the penal code. Parents would rather do\r\nanything than send their children into such prisons where, at last, they\r\nwould receive an education which, to their minds, must lead them to\r\nforfeit their soul's salvation.\" [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nFifthly, That due encouragement should be given to agriculture; and a\r\nstop put to that pernicious practice of graziers; engrossing vast\r\nquantities of land, sometimes at great distance; whereby the country is\r\nextremely depopulated.\r\n\r\nSixthly, That the defects in those acts for planting forest trees, might\r\nbe fully supplied, since they have hitherto been wholly ineffectual;\r\nexcept about the demesnes of a few gentlemen; and even there, in\r\ngeneral, very unskilfully made, and thriving accordingly. Neither hath\r\nthere yet been due care taken to preserve what is planted, or to enclose\r\ngrounds; not one hedge, in a hundred, coming to maturity, for want of\r\nskill and industry. The neglect of copsing woods cut down, hath likewise\r\nbeen of very ill consequences. And if men were restrained from that\r\nunlimited liberty of cutting down their own woods before the proper\r\ntime, as they are in some other countries; it would be a mighty benefit\r\nto the kingdom. For, I believe, there is not another example in Europe,\r\nof such a prodigious quantity of excellent timber cut down, in so short\r\na time, with so little advantage to the country, either in shipping or\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nI may add, that absurd practice of cutting turf, without any regularity;\r\nwhereby great quantities of restorable land are made utterly desperate,\r\nmany thousands of cattle destroyed, the turf more difficult to come at,\r\nand carry home, and less fit for burning; the air made unwholesome by\r\nstagnating pools and marshes; and the very sight of such places\r\noffensive to those who ride by. Neither should that odious custom be\r\nallowed, of cutting scraws, (as they call them) which is flaying off the\r\ngreen surface of the ground, to cover their cabins; or make up their\r\nditches; sometimes in shallow soils, where all is gravel within a few\r\ninches; and sometimes in low ground, with a thin greensward, and sloughy\r\nunderneath; which last turns all into bog, by this mismanagement. And,\r\nI have heard from very skilful country-men, that by these two practices\r\nin turf and scraws, the kingdom loseth some hundreds of acres of\r\nprofitable land every year; besides the irreparable loss of many skirts\r\nof bogs, which have a green coat of grass, and yet are mangled for turf;\r\nand, besides the want of canals, by regular cutting, which would not\r\nonly be a great convenience for bringing their turf home at an easy\r\nrate; but likewise render even the larger bogs more dry and safe, for\r\nsummer pasture.\r\n\r\nThese, and some other speculations of the like kind, I had intended to\r\npublish in a particular discourse against this session of Parliament;\r\nbecause, in some periods of my life, I had opportunity and curiosity to\r\nobserve, from what causes those great errors, in every branch of country\r\nmanagement, have arisen; of which I have now ventured to relate but few,\r\nout of very many; whereof some, perhaps, would not be mentioned without\r\ngiving offence; which I have endeavoured, by all possible means, to\r\navoid. And, for the same reason, I chose to add here, the little I\r\nthought proper to say on this subject.\r\n\r\nBut, as to the lands of those who are perpetual absentees, I do not see\r\nany probability of their being ever improved. In former times, their\r\ntenants sat at easy rents; but for some years past, they have been,\r\ngenerally speaking, more terribly racked by the dexterity of merciless\r\nagents from England, than even those held under the severest landlords\r\nhere. I was assured upon the place, by great numbers of credible people,\r\nthat a prodigious estate in the county of Cork, being let upon leases\r\nfor lives, and great fines paid; the rent was so high, that the tenants\r\nbegged leave to surrender their leases, and were content to lose their\r\nfines.\r\n\r\nThe cultivating and improvement of land, is certainly a subject worthy\r\nof the highest enquiry in any country, but especially in ours; where we\r\nare so strangely limited in every branch of trade, that can be of\r\nadvantage to us; and utterly deprived of those, which are of the\r\ngreatest importance; whereof I defy the most learned man in Europe, to\r\nproduce me an example from any other kingdom in the world: For, we are\r\ndenied the benefits which God and nature intended to us; as manifestly\r\nappears by our happy situation for commerce, and the great number of\r\nour excellent ports. So that, I think, little is left us, beside the\r\ncultivating our own soil, encouraging agriculture, and making great\r\nplantations of trees, that we might not be under the necessity of\r\nsending for corn and bark from England, and timber from other countries.\r\nThis would increase the number of our inhabitants, and help to consume\r\nour natural products, as well as manufactures at home. And I shall never\r\nforget what I once ventured to say to a great man in England; \"That few\r\npoliticians, with all their schemes, are half so useful members of a\r\ncommonwealth, as an honest farmer; who, by skilfully draining, fencing,\r\nmanuring, and planting, hath increased the intrinsic value of a piece of\r\nland; and thereby done a perpetual service to his country;\" which it is\r\na great controversy, whether any of the former ever did, since the\r\ncreation of the world; but no controversy at all, that ninety-nine in a\r\nhundred, have done abundance of mischief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIXES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nADDRESSES TO THE KING[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To the King's most Excellent MAJESTY: _The humble_ ADDRESS _of the_\r\nKnights, Citizens _and_ Burgesses, _in Parliament assembled._\r\n\r\n\"MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,\r\n\r\nIt is with the utmost Concern, that We, Your Majesty's most dutiful\r\nsubjects, the Commons of IRELAND in Parliament assembled, find ourselves\r\nindispensably obliged, to represent to Your Majesty, our unanimous\r\nOpinion: That the importing and uttering of _Copper Farthings_ and\r\n_Halfpence_ by virtue of the Patent lately granted to _William Wood,_\r\nEsq.; under the Great Seal of _Great Britain,_ will be highly\r\nprejudicial to Your Majesty's Revenue, destructive of the trade and\r\ncommerce of this nation, and of the most dangerous consequence to the\r\nproperties of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Addresses by the House of Commons and the House of Lords\r\npresented to the King in conformity with the resolutions passed by these\r\nHouses.

That the reserving the\r\ncoining of _Half-pence_ and _Farthings_ to the _Crown_ and _the not\r\nintrusting it_ with any private person, body politic or corporate, will\r\nalways be for Your Majesty's service, and the good of your people in\r\n_this Kingdom._\r\n\r\n\"In confidence, Sir, of your paternal care of the welfare of _this_\r\ncountry, we beseech Your Majesty, that you will be pleased to extend\r\nthat goodness and compassion to us, which has so eminently shewed itself\r\nto all your other subjects, who have the happiness to live under your\r\nprotection and government; and that you will give such directions as may\r\neffectually free us from the terrible apprehensions we labour under from\r\nthe _Patent_ granted to _William Wood.\"_\r\n\r\nThe following was the King's reply to the above address:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE R.\r\n\r\n\"His _Majesty is very much concerned to see, That His granting the\r\nPatent for coining_ Half-pence _and_ Farthings _agreeable to the\r\nPractice of his Royal Predecessors, has given so much uneasiness to the_\r\nHouse of Lords: _And if there have been any abuses committed by the_\r\nPatentee, _His Majesty will give the necessary Orders for enquiring\r\ninto, and punishing those Abuses.

But although the copper\r\nwas very good, and the money, one piece with another, was full weight,\r\nyet the single pieces were not so equally coined in the weight as they\r\nshould have been.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The copy of this Report as here printed is taken from the\r\ntract already quoted in previous notes, entitled, \"A Defence of the\r\nConduct of the People of Ireland in their unanimous Refusal of Mr.\r\nWood's Copper-money ... Dublin: Printed for George Ewing, at the Angel\r\nand Bible in Dames-Street, MDCCXXIV.\" As already noted, the assayists\r\nhad for trial only those coins which were coined between March, 1723,\r\nand March, 1724, and these coins were neither imported into Ireland nor\r\nattempted to be uttered there. As Wood asked for the assay, he no doubt\r\nknew what he was about. But even as it stands, the Report was not very\r\nfavourable to him. The author of the tract named above enters minutely\r\ninto this point, and for a further inquiry the reader is referred to\r\npages 15 to 19 of his publication. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\n\"We found also that thirty and two old half-pence coined for Ireland in\r\nthe reigns of King Charles 2d., King James 2d., and King William 3d. and\r\nQueen Mary, and produced by Mr. Wood, weighed six ounces and eight\r\npennyweight _Troy_, that is, one hundred and three grains and a half\r\napiece one with another. They were much worn, and if about six or seven\r\ngrains be allowed to each of them one with another for loss of their\r\nweight by wearing, the copper-money coined for England, in the reign of\r\nKing William being already as much lightened by wearing, they might at\r\nfirst weigh about half a pound _avoirdupois_; whereas only thirty of\r\nthose coined by Mr. Wood are to be of that. They were also made of bad\r\ncopper, two of those coined in the reign of King Charles II. wasted much\r\nin the fire, and then spread thin under the hammer, but not so well\r\nwithout cracking as those of Mr. Wood. Two of those coined in the reign\r\nof King James II. wasted much more in the fire, and were not malleable\r\nwhen red hot. Two of those coined in the reign of King William and Queen\r\nMary wasted still more in the fire, and turned to an unmalleable\r\nsubstance like a cinder, as your Lordships may see the pieces now laid\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\n\"By the assays we reckon the copper of Mr. Wood's halfpence and\r\nfarthings to be of the same goodness and value with the copper of which\r\nthe copper money is coined in the King's Mint for England; or worth in\r\nthe market about twelve or thirteen pence per pound weight\r\n_avoirdupois_; and the copper of which the half-pence were coined for\r\nIreland in the reigns of King Charles, King James, and King William, to\r\nbe much inferior in value, the mixture being unknown, and not bearing\r\nthe fire for converting it to any other use until it be refined.\r\n\r\n\"The half-pence and farthings in the pix coined by Mr. Wood had on one\r\nside the head of the King, with this inscription GEORGIUS DEI GRATIA\r\nREX: And on the other side, a woman sitting with a harp by her left\r\nside, and above her the inscription HIBERNIA with the date. The\r\nhalf-pence coined in the reigns of King Charles, King James, and King\r\nWilliam, had on one side the head of King Charles, King James, or King\r\nWilliam and Queen Mary, and on the reverse a harp crowned.\r\n\r\n\"All which facts we most humbly represent to your Lordships.

[644-649].\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the heat of this business, which has of late so much and so justly\r\nconcerned this kingdom, is at last, in a great measure over, we may\r\nventure to abate something of our former zeal and vigour in handling it,\r\nand looking upon it as an enemy almost overthrown, consult more our own\r\namusement than its prejudice, in attacking it in light excursory\r\nskirmishes. Thus much I thought fit to observe, lest the world should be\r\ntoo apt to make an obvious pun upon me; when beginning to dream upon\r\nthis occasion, I presented it with the wild nocturnal rovings of an\r\nunguided imagination, on a subject of so great importance, as the final\r\nwelfare or ruin of a whole nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following tract, written probably by Thomas Sheridan,\r\nSwift's humorous friend, is interesting as affording an example of the\r\nlighter kind of literature brought into existence by this agitation. It\r\nmay be that Swift had a hand in its composition. The text is taken from\r\na copy of the original broadside in the South Kensington Collection. It\r\nwas published during the height of the controversy. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nBut so it was, that upon reading one of the Drapier's letters, I fell\r\nasleep, and had the following dream:\r\n\r\nThe first object that struck me was a woman of exquisite beauty, and a\r\nmost majestic air, seated on a throne, whom by the figure of a lion\r\nbeneath her feet, and of Neptune who stood by her, and paid her the most\r\nrespectful homage, I easily knew to be the Genius of England; at some\r\ndistance from her, (though not at so great an one as seemed to be\r\ndesired,) I observed a matron clothed in robes so tattered and torn,\r\nthat they had not only very nigh lost their original air of royalty and\r\nmagnificence, but even exposed her to the inclemency of the weather in\r\nseveral places, which with many other afflictions had so affected her,\r\nthat her natural beauty was almost effaced, and her strength and spirits\r\nvery nigh lost. She hung over a harp with which, if she sometimes\r\nendeavoured to sooth her melancholy, she had still the misfortune to\r\nfind it more or less out of tune, particularly, when as I perceived at\r\nlast, it was strung with a sort of wire of so base composition, that\r\nneither she nor I could make anything of it. I took particular notice,\r\nthat, when moved by a just sense of her wrongs, she could at any time\r\nraise her head, she fixed her eyes so stedfastly on her neighbour,\r\nsometimes with an humble and entreating, at others, with a more bold and\r\nresentful regard, that I could not help (however improbable it should\r\nseem from her generous august appearance) in a great measure to\r\nattribute her misfortunes to her; but this I shall submit to the\r\njudgment of the world.\r\n\r\nI should now at last mention the name, were not these circumstances too\r\nunhappily singular to make that any way necessary.\r\n\r\nAs I was taken up with many melancholy reflections on this moving\r\nobject, I was on a sudden interrupted by a little sort of an uproar,\r\nwhich, upon turning my eyes towards it, I found arose from a crowd of\r\npeople behind her throne; the cause it seems was this:\r\n\r\nThere was, I perceived, among them the god of merchandise, with his\r\nsandals, mostly of brass, but not without a small proportion of gold and\r\nsilver, and his wings chiefly of the two latter metals, but allayed with\r\na little of the former; with those he used to trudge up and down to\r\nfurnish them with necessaries; with these he'd take a flight to other\r\ncountries, but not so dexterously or to so good purpose as in other\r\nplaces of his office, not so much for want of encouragement among 'em\r\nhere, as on account of the haughty jealousy of their neighbours, who, it\r\nseems dreading in them a rival, took care to clip his wings and\r\ncircumscribe his flights; the former, more especially, being, by these\r\nand other means so much worn, he performed his office but lamely, which\r\ngave occasion to some who had their own private interest more at heart,\r\nthan that of the public, to patch up some of the places that were worn,\r\nwith a metal of the same nature indeed, but so slight and base, that\r\nthough at first it might serve to carry him on their errands, it soon\r\nfailed, and by degrees grew entirely useless; insomuch, that he would\r\nrather be retarded than promoted in his business, and this occasioned\r\nthe above disturbances among his dependents, who thereupon turned their\r\neyes towards their mistress (for by this time she will I presume be\r\nbetter known by that, than the more homely and sociable name of\r\nneighbour) and not daring of late to say or do anything without her\r\napprobation, made several humble applications to her, beseeching that\r\nshe would continue them that liberty of refitting these implements\r\nthemselves, which she had been formerly pleased graciously to allow 'em;\r\nbut these, however reasonable, were all rejected, whereupon I observed a\r\ncertain person (a mean ill-looking fellow) from among a great number of\r\npeople that stood behind the genius of England, who, during the whole\r\naffair had kept his eyes intently fixed on his neighbours, watching all\r\ntheir motions, like a hawk hovering over his quarry, and with just the\r\nsame design: Him, I say, I observed to turn off hastily, and make\r\ntowards the throne, where being arrived, after some preparations\r\nrequisite, he preferred a petition, setting forth the wants and\r\nnecessities, (but taking care to make 'em appear at least four times\r\ngreater than they really were) of his neighbours, or as he might have\r\nmore truly and honestly said his own, both which, for the latter, though\r\nnot expressed, he chiefly intended, but modestly or rather knavishly\r\nleft to be understood, he begged the royal licence to redress, by\r\nsupplying those defects which were the occasion of 'em. This humble\r\nsuppliant I observed both before and after this petition, seemed to\r\nemploy his utmost industry and art, to insinuate himself into the good\r\ngraces of two persons that stood on each side the throne;[2]the one on\r\nthe right was a lady of large make and swarthy complexion; the other, a\r\nman, that seemed to be between fifty and sixty, who had an air of deep\r\ndesigning thought: These two he managed with a great deal of art; for\r\nthe lady he employed all the little arts that win her sex, particularly,\r\nI observed, that he frequently took hold of her hand, as in raptures, to\r\nkiss it, in such a manner as made me suspect she did not always draw it\r\nback empty; but this he did so slily, that it was not easy for anybody\r\nto be certain of it: The man on the other hand, he plied his own way\r\nwith politics, remonstrating to him the several things he had before the\r\nthrone; which however, as might be presumed from his manner of attending\r\nto them, seemed to make little impression; but when he came to lay\r\nbefore him the great advantages that might accrue from thence to their\r\nmistress, and consequently to him, he heard him with the utmost\r\neagerness and satisfaction; at last, having plainly told him, that he\r\nhimself should be a considerable gainer by it, and thereupon, that every\r\nthing that came to his hands of that nature should be at his service: As\r\na sort of token or earnest he kissed his hand in the same manner he had\r\nthe lady's, and so retired; by these and the like means he soon brought\r\nover both parties to him, who, with a whisper or two, procured him the\r\nroyal licence; whereupon he immediately fell to making up a metal, if it\r\ndeserved the name, of a very strange composition, wherewith he purposed\r\nto refit the implements of that useful deity, but in such manner, that\r\nfor the base metal he put into them, he would take care to draw away\r\nfrom them an infinitely more than proportionable quantity of gold and\r\nsilver, and thereby render him almost incapable of taking flight to\r\nforeign countries; nay, at last perhaps utterly so, when under pretence\r\nof their not being completed, he should filch in more of his metal, and\r\nfilch away more of theirs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Duchess of Kendal and Sir Robert Walpole. [S.]]\r\n\r\nThese things being therefore prepared, he sends 'em over to his\r\nneighbours, and there endeavoured to get them admitted by fair words and\r\npromises, being too sensible that they were not of themselves the most\r\nwilling to accept of his favour, and indeed he was not deceived; for\r\nthey being advertised of his designs, had taken the alarm, and had\r\nalmost to a man united in one common faction against him. This generous\r\nardour had first taken hold of the most active and important part, and\r\nif I may be allowed to call it, the heart of this body, from thence was\r\non one side by a quick passage, and in its more refined parts,\r\ncommunicated through the blood to the contemplative, and reasoning, the\r\nhead, which it inspired with noble thoughts and resolutions; and on the\r\nother, to the inferior extremities, which were thereby rendered more\r\nexpedite and readier to obey the dictates of the head in a rougher\r\nmethod of opposition, from each of which extremities being carried back\r\nto its fountain, it was returned to them from thence, and so backwards\r\nand forwards, till the circulation and union were confirmed and\r\ncompleted, the sordid unnatural, offensive parts being in the meantime\r\nthrown off as dregs of nature, and nuisances of human society; but of\r\nthese in so well-tempered a constitution, there were but few; however,\r\nwhen there were any to be found, though they had been of the most\r\nexalted nature, and bore most noble offices in this body, by any\r\ncorruption became so, they shared the common fate, with this only\r\ndifference, that they were rejected with greater scorn and contempt on\r\naccount of their former dignity, as was found in one notorious instance;\r\nbut on the other hand, among all the parts that were serviceable to the\r\nconstitution on this occasion, there was not one more so, than a certain\r\none whose name indeed is not openly known, but whose good offices and\r\nusefulness are too great ever to be forgotten; for it by its nice\r\ndiligence and skill selected out things of the most noble and exquisite\r\nnature, by infusing and dispersing them to enliven and invigorate the\r\nwhole body, which how effectually they did, our bold projector sadly\r\nexperienced. For finding all his endeavours to pass his ware upon them,\r\ndisappointed, he withdrew; but his patron on the other side being\r\ninformed of what had passed, fell into a most terrible passion, and\r\nthreatened, they say, I know not what, of making to swallow and ramming\r\ndown throats; but while they were in deep conference together, methought\r\nall on a sudden a trap-door dropped, and down fell our projector; this\r\nunexpected accident did on many accounts not a little alarm the throne,\r\nand gave it but too great occasion to reflect a little on what had been\r\ndoing, as what a mean ordinary fellow it had intrusted with the care of\r\nan affair of so great consequence that though their neighbours' refusal\r\nmight possibly have put him to such straits as might be the great\r\noccasion of this disgrace, yet that very refusal could not be so\r\nuniversal and resolute without some reason, which could arise from\r\nnothing else but the unseasonableness or unworthiness of his offers, or\r\nboth, and he, consequently, must deserve as much to suffer as they did;\r\nnot for the better information, therefore in these surmises some of the\r\nneighbours were consulted, who confirming them, things seemed to bear a\r\ngood face, and be in a very fair way of clearing up. When I awoke, I\r\ncannot say whether more pleased at the present posture of affairs, when\r\nI recollected how indifferent an one they had lately been in, or anxious\r\nwhen upon considering that they were not yet firm and settled, I was led\r\nto reflect in general on the uncertainty of events, and in particular,\r\non the small reason the persons in hand can have to promise themselves\r\nprosperous ones, especially when they are depending in that part of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nDublin, printed in the year 1724-5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM A FRIEND TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ------[1]\r\n\r\nCeteri, quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus extollerentur:\r\nInvalido legum auxilio, quae vi, ambitu, postremo pecunia\r\nturbabantur.--_Tacit.

They were,\r\nperhaps, composed by Mr. Robert Lindsay, distinguished by Swift in his\r\nletter to Lord Midleton, as an eminent lawyer, as well as a man of\r\nvirtue and learning, whose legal advice he used during the whole\r\ncontroversy. [S.]\r\n\r\nThe present letters are taken from copies of the original broadsides in\r\nthe South Kensington collection. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nIn matters of law your opinion has from our first acquaintance entirely\r\nguided me, and the things you have assured me I might depend upon as\r\nlaw, have few of them escaped my memory, though I have had but little\r\nconversation with you since you first appeared in Parliament and moved\r\nthe House to resolve, That it is the indispensable duty of the judges of\r\nthis kingdom to go through their circuits; nor have I had any since you\r\nfell sick and was made solicitor-general.\r\n\r\nI have often heard your lordship affirm, and therefore I do affirm it,\r\nThat the great ends for which grand juries were instituted, were the\r\nsupport of the government, the safety of every man's life and fortune,\r\nit being necessary some should be trusted to inquire after all\r\ndisturbers of the peace, that they might be prosecuted and brought to\r\ncondign punishment; and it is no less needful for every man's quiet and\r\nsafety, that the trust of such inquisitions should be put into the hands\r\nof persons of understanding and integrity, that will suffer no man to be\r\nfalsely accused or defamed; nor the lives of any to be put in jeopardy,\r\nby the malicious conspiracies of great or small, or the perjuries of any\r\nprofligate wretches.\r\n\r\nSo material a part of our constitution are grand juries, so much does\r\nthe security of every subject depend upon them, that though anciently\r\nthe sheriff was by express law, chosen annually by the people of the\r\ncounty, and trusted with the power of the county, yet the law left not\r\nthe election of grand juries to the will of the sheriff, but has\r\ndescribed their qualifications, which if they have, and the sheriff\r\nreturn them, no man, nay no judge, can object to their being sworn, much\r\nless may they to their serving when sworn: And to prevent the\r\ndiscretionary power (a new-fashioned term) of these judges over juries,\r\nyou used to say was made the statute of the 11th of Hen. 4.\r\n\r\nPardon me my lord if I venture to affirm, That a dissolving power is a\r\nbreach of that law, or at least an evasion, as every citizen in Dublin\r\nin Sir Constantine Phipps's time perfectly understood, that disapproving\r\nthe aldermen lawfully returned to the Privy-council was in effect\r\nassuming the power of choosing and returning----But your lordship and\r\nI know dissolving and disapproving are different terms.\r\n\r\nI always understood from your Lordship the trust and power of grand\r\njuries is or ought to be accounted amongst the greatest and of most\r\nconcern, next to the legislative: The honour, reputations, fortunes and\r\nlives of every man being subject to their censure; the kings of England\r\nhave an undoubted power of dissolving parliaments, but dissolving 'till\r\none was returned to their or their ministers' liking, has never been\r\nthought very righteous, and Heaven be praised never very successful.\r\n\r\nI am entirely of your lordship's opinion, the oath of a grand juryman is\r\nnot always sufficiently considered by the jurors, which is as follows.\r\n\r\n\"You shall diligently enquire, and true presentment make of all such\r\narticles, matters and things as shall be given you in charge; And of all\r\nother matters and things as shall come to your own knowledge, touching\r\nthis present service. The King's counsel your fellows' and your own you\r\nshall keep secret,\" &c.--And from some other men's behaviour, I fear\r\noaths are not always as sacredly observed as they ought to be: \"The\r\nKing's counsel, your fellows' and your _own_ you shall keep\r\nsecret\"--Though our grandmothers my lord might have thought there was a\r\ndispensing power in the Pope, you and I profess no power upon earth can\r\ndispense with this oath, so that to force a man to discover the counsel\r\nhe is sworn to keep, is to force him into direct perjury.\r\n\r\nSuppose upon information taken before your Lordship of a rape committed,\r\na bill of indictment were sent to a grand jury, and the grand jury\r\nreturn _ignoramus_ on it, application is made to the Court to\r\nrecommend it to them to reconsider it, and they return as before\r\n_ignoramus_--Suppose a judge with more than decent passion should ask\r\nthem their reasons (which is their counsel) for so doing, nay should be\r\nso particular as to demand of them whether they thought the woman a\r\nwhore. Must not all the world conclude somebody had forgot the oath of a\r\ngrand juryman? Yes sure, or his own, or worse.--But suppose they should\r\nask a juror a question might criminate himself? My Lord, you know I put\r\nnot bare possibilities, it is generally believed these things have been\r\ndone within an oak of this town--And if I am rightly informed, the\r\nrestraint a juror is under by his oath, is so well understood, that a\r\ncertain person desired the clerk of the Crown to change the form of it\r\nby adding this exception: \"unless by leave or order of the Court.\"\r\n\r\nThese things, my Lord, would seem strange in Westminster-hall, and would\r\nbe severely noted in St. Stephen's Chapel. The honour of the Crown would\r\nbe thought a very false as well as weak plea for such proceedings there,\r\nas indeed it is an infamous one everywhere, for 'tis a scandal upon a\r\nking, if he is represented in a court of justice, as if he were\r\npartially concerned or rather inclined to desire, that a party should be\r\nfound guilty, than that he should be declared innocent.\r\n\r\nThe King's interest and honour is more concerned in the protection of\r\nthe innocent, than in the punishment of the guilty, as in all the\r\nimmediate actions of his Majesty we find that maxim pursued, a maxim can\r\nnever run a prince into excesses. We do not only find those princes\r\nrepresented in history under odious characters, who have basely betrayed\r\nthe innocent, but such as by their spies and informers were too\r\ninquisitive after the guilty, whereas none was ever blamed for clemency,\r\nor for being too gentle interpreters of the law. Though Trajan was an\r\nexcellent prince, endowed with all heroical virtues; yet the most\r\neloquent writers, and his best friends, found nothing more to be praised\r\nin his government, than that in his time, all men might think what they\r\npleased, and every man speak what he thought, this I say, that if any\r\namongst us by violent measures, and a dictatorial behaviour have raised\r\njealousies in the minds of His Majesty's faithful subjects, the blame\r\nmay lie at their door.\r\n\r\nI know it has been said for His Majesty's service, grand juries may be\r\nforced to discover their counsels: But you will confess a king can do\r\nnothing against law, nor will any honest man judge that for his service,\r\nwhich is not warranted by law. If a constant uninterrupted usage, can\r\ngive the force of a law, then the grand jurymen are bound by law, as\r\nwell as by their oaths, to keep the King's, their fellows' and their own\r\ncounsel secret. Bracton and Britton in their several generations bear\r\nwitness, that it was then practised; and greater proof of it needs not\r\nbe sought, than the disputes that appear by the law-books to have been\r\namongst the ancient lawyers, Whether it was treason or felony for a\r\ngrand juryman to discover their counsels--The trust of grand juries was\r\nin those days thought so sacred, and their secrecy of so great concern\r\nto the kingdom, that whosoever should break their oaths, was by all\r\nthought worthy to die, only some would have them suffer as traitors,\r\nothers as felons.\r\n\r\nIf a king's commands should come to the judges of a court of justice or\r\nto a jury, desiring them to vary from the direction of the law, (which\r\nit is criminal to say, and no man ought to be believed therein) they are\r\nbound by their oaths not to regard them. The statute of 2 of E. 3. 8.\r\nand 20 E. 3. I. are express; and the substance of these and other\r\nstatutes is inserted into the oaths taken by every judge; and if they be\r\nunder the most solemn and sacred tie in the execution of justice to hold\r\nfor nothing the commands of the King under the great seal, then surely\r\npolitical views and schemes, the pleasure or displeasure of a minister,\r\nin the like case ought to be less than nothing.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange doctrine that men must sacrifice the law to secure their\r\nproperties, if the law is to be fashioned for every occasion, if grand\r\njurymen contrary to their oaths must discover their fellows' and their\r\nown counsels, and betray the trust the law has reposed in them, if they\r\nmust subject the reasons of their verdicts to the censure of the judges,\r\nwhom the law did never design to trust with the liberty, property, or\r\ngood name of their fellow-subjects. No man can say he has any security\r\nfor his life or fortune, and they who do not themselves, may however see\r\ntheir best friends and nearest relations suffer the utmost violences and\r\noppressions.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to say a few words of the petit jury, not forgetting Mr.\r\nWalters. I am assured by an eminent lawyer, that the power and office of\r\na petit jury is judicial, that they only are the judges from whose\r\nsentence the indicted are to expect life or death. Upon their integrity\r\nand understanding the lives of all that are brought in judgment do\r\nultimately depend; from their verdict there lies no appeal, by finding\r\nguilty or not guilty. They do complicately resolve both law and fact. As\r\nit hath been the law, so it hath always been the custom and practice of\r\nthese juries (except as before) upon all general issues, pleaded in\r\ncases civil as well as criminal, to judge both of the law and fact. So\r\nit is said in the report of the Lord Chief Justice Vaughan in Bushell's\r\ncase, That these juries determine the law in all matters where issue is\r\njoined and tried, in the principal case whether the issue be about\r\ntrespass or debt, or disseizin in assizes, or a tort or any such like,\r\nunless they should please to give a special verdict with an implicate\r\nfaith in the judgment of the Court, to which none can oblige them\r\nagainst their wills.\r\n\r\nIt is certain we may hope to see the trust of a grand juryman best\r\ndischarged when gentlemen of the best fortunes and understandings attend\r\nthat service, but it is as certain we must never expect to see such men\r\non juries, if for differing with a judge in opinion, when they only are\r\nthe lawful judges, they are liable to be treated like villains, like\r\nperjurers, and enemies to their king and country; I say my lord such\r\nbehaviour to juries will make all gentlemen avoid that duty, and instead\r\nof men of interest, of reputation and abilities, our lives, our\r\nfortunes, and our reputations must depend upon the basest and meanest of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nI know it is commonly said, _boni judicis est ampliare juridictionem_.\r\nBut I take that to be better advice which was given by the Lord\r\nChancellor Bacon upon swearing a judge; That he would take care to\r\ncontain the jurisdiction of the court within the ancient mere-stones\r\nwithout removing the mark.\r\n\r\nI intend to pay my respects to your lordship once every month 'till the\r\nmeeting of the Parliament, when our betters may consider of these\r\nmatters, and therefore will not trouble you with any more on this\r\nsubject at present. But conclude, most heartily praying----\r\n\r\nThat from depending upon the will of a judge, who may be corrupted or\r\nswayed by his own passions, interests, or the impulse of such as support\r\nhim and may advance him to greater honours, the God of mercy and of\r\njustice deliver this nation.\r\n\r\n          I am, my lord,\r\n  Your lordship's most obedient humble servant,\r\n                                             N.N.\r\nDec. the First 1724.\r\n     Dublin: Printed in the Year 1724.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SECOND LETTER FROM A FRIEND TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ------\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lord,\r\n\r\nI think the best service men employed by His Majesty can do for him and\r\nthis country, is to shew such prudence and temper in their behaviours as\r\nmay convince every man they are not intrusted with any power but what is\r\nnecessary and will always be exercised for the advantage and security of\r\nHis Majesty's subjects.\r\n\r\nFor my own part I hold it the duty of every man though he has not the\r\nhonour of serving His Majesty in public employment, not only, not to\r\nmisrepresent the actions of his servants, but in matters of small\r\nconcern, to wink at their follies and mistakes; I know the Jacobites and\r\nPapists our irreconcilable enemies are too watchful to lay hold of every\r\noccasion to misrepresent His Majesty and turn the faults of ambitious\r\nand self-interested servants upon the best of kings.\r\n\r\nI hear some men say, that in my last to your lordship, there appears\r\nmore of the satirist, than becomes a man engaged merely in the defence\r\nof liberty and justice; But I am satisfied I can with charity affirm,\r\nthey are either such as have no knowledge of the several steps [that]\r\nhave been taken to bring this poor country into ruin and disgrace, or\r\nthey are of the number of those who have had a share in the actings and\r\ncontrivances against it; for my lord, he must rather be an insensible\r\nstoic than an angry cynic, who can survey the measures of some men\r\nwithout horror and indignation--To see men act as if they had never\r\ntaken an oath of fidelity to their king, whose interest is inseparable\r\nfrom that of his people, but had sworn to support the ruinous projects\r\nof abandoned men (of whatever faction) must rouse the most lethargic, if\r\nhonest, soul.\r\n\r\nI who have always professed myself a Whig do confess it has mine.\r\n\r\nI beg leave in this place to explain what I intended in my last by the\r\nwords, \"unless by leave or order of the court,\" lest whilst I plead for\r\njustice I should do an injury to your lordship.\r\n\r\nI do declare I never heard that story of your lordship, and I hope no\r\nman did believe it of you. My intention was by that hint to remember you\r\nof Judge U--p--n and a certain assizes held at Wicklow, as I believe\r\nyour lordship understood it, and as I now desire all the world may.\r\n\r\nHaving learned from your lordship and other lawyers of undoubted\r\nabilities, that no judge ought by threats or circumvention to make a\r\ngrand-juryman discover the king's counsel his fellows' or his own I\r\nshould not at present say anything in support of that position. But that\r\nI find a most ridiculous and false explanation seem to mislead some men\r\nin that point: Say they, by the word counsel is understood, such bills\r\nas are before the grand jury and the evidence the prosecutors for the\r\ncrown have to support the charge against the subject--Lest that being\r\nknown the party indictable may fly from justice, or he may procure false\r\nwitnesses to discredit the evidence for the king, or he may by bribes\r\nand other indirect measures take off the witnesses for the crown.\r\n\r\nI confess _I_ take that to be the meaning of the word counsel, but I am\r\ncertain that is not _all_ that is meant by it, that is what must be\r\nunderstood when it is called the king's counsel, _id est_, the counsel\r\nor reasons for which the king by his servants, his attorney-general or\r\ncoroner, has drawn and sent to the grand jury a charge against a\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBut the counsel of a juror is a different thing, it is the evidence, the\r\nmotives and reasons that induce him or his fellow-jurors to say _billa\r\nvera_ or _ignoramus_, and the opinion he or they happen to be of when the\r\nquestion is put by the foreman for finding or not finding: This counsel\r\nevery man is sworn to keep secret, that so their opinion and advice may\r\nnot be of prejudice to them hereafter, That as they are sworn to act\r\nwithout favour or affection, so may they also act without FEAR. Whereas,\r\nwere it otherwise the spirit of revenge is so universal, there are but\r\nfew cases wherein a juror could act with safety to himself; either the\r\nprosecuted, as where the bill is found, or the prosecutor, where it is\r\nreturned _ignoramus_, may contrive to defame the jurors who differ from\r\nthem in opinion: As I am told has happened to some very honest citizens\r\nwho are represented to be Jacobites since their opinions were know to be\r\nagainst ----. And sometimes revenge or ambition may prompt men to carry\r\nit further, as in the case of Mr. Wilmer, who in King Charles 2d's time\r\nwas very severely handled for being one of an _ignoramus_ jury.----\r\n'Tis not necessary to say whom he disobliged by being so.----But if I\r\nremember right his case was this.\r\n\r\nHe was a merchant, (and as I said, an _ignoramus_ juryman) had\r\ncovenanted with a servant boy to serve him in the West Indies, and\r\naccordingly sent him beyond sea: Upon suggestion and affidavit by which\r\nany person might have it, a writ _de homine replegiando_ was granted\r\nagainst Mr. Wilmer; the sheriffs would have returned on the writ the\r\nagreement and the boy's consent, but the court (in the case of this\r\nWilmer) Easter 34, Cha. 2. [_i.e.,_ Charles the Second] in B.R. ruled\r\nthey must return _replegiari fecimus_ or _elongavit_, that is, they had\r\nreplevy'd the boy, or that Wilmer had carried him away where they could\r\nnot find him, in which last case Mr. Wilmer, though an innocent person\r\nmust have gone to gaol until he brought the boy into court or he must\r\nhave been outlawed--Shower's Rep. 2 Part.\r\n\r\nI do not say this that I think the same thing will be practised again,\r\nor anything like it, though I know that very homely proverb, \"More ways\r\nof killing a dog than hanging him.\"--But I instance it to shew, the\r\ncounsels of every grand juryman should be kept secret, that he may act\r\nfreely and without apprehensions of resentment from the prosecuted or\r\nprosecutor.\r\n\r\nMy resolution when I writ to you last, was, not to have said anything in\r\nthis concerning the power of dissolving or dispensing, but as I have\r\nbeen forced to say something of the dispensing, for the same reason I\r\nmust of the dissolving power.--A power undoubtedly in effect including\r\nthat of returning, which makes me wish two men of great interest in this\r\nkingdom, differing in every other thing, had not undertaken to defend\r\nit, or they had better reasons for it than I have yet heard.\r\n\r\n'Tis said, \"This power is in the court as a right of resistance is in\r\nthe people, as the people have a power superior to the prerogative of\r\nthe prince, though no written or express law for it; so of necessity\r\nthough no statute directs it, and it may seem to overturn the greatest\r\nsecurity men have for their liberties, yet the court has a power of\r\ndissolving grand juries, if they refuse to find or present as the court\r\nshall direct.\"\r\n\r\nPray let us consider how well this concludes.\r\n\r\nThe people may do anything in defence of their lives, their religion and\r\nliberties, and consequently resistance is lawful, therefore an inferior\r\ncourt a _bene placito_ judge may----Monstrous absurdity.\r\n\r\nAnother, I am sorry I can't say more modest argument to support it is\r\nthis.--\r\n\r\n\"Considering,\" say they, \"grand juries, it is but reasonable a\r\ndiscretionary power of dissolving them should be lodged in the judges.\"\r\n\r\nBy the words \"considering grand juries,\" I must understand considering\r\ntheir understandings, their fortunes or their integrity, for from a want\r\nof one or more of those qualifications must arise the reason of such a\r\ndiscretionary power in the judges.\r\n\r\nThough I shall not urge it as far as I could, I will venture to say the\r\nargument is at least as strong the other way--considering the judges.--\r\n\r\nFirst as to their understandings, it must be confessed the benches are\r\ninfinitely superior to the lower professors of the law: Yet surely it\r\ncan't give offence to say the gentlemen of the several counties have\r\nunderstandings sufficient to discharge the duty of grand jurymen--If\r\nwant of fortune be an objection to grand jurymen, _a pari ratione_, it\r\nis an objection to some other men.--Besides, that the fact is not true,\r\nfor in their circuits, no judge goes into any county where he does not\r\nmeet at least a dozen gentlemen returned upon every grand jury, every\r\none of whom have better estates than he himself has--And these not\r\nduring pleasure, which last consideration, saves me the trouble of\r\nshewing the weakness of the objection in the third qualification.\r\n\r\n\"Ay. But it was a necessary expedient to keep out Wood's brass.\"\r\n\r\nAre the properties of the commons of this kingdom better secured by the\r\nknight-errantry of that day? In the name of common sense, what are we to\r\nbelieve? Has the undaunted spirit, the tremendous voice of ------\r\nfrightened Wood and his accomplices from any further attempts? Or rather\r\nhas not the ready compliance of ------ encouraged them to further\r\ntrials? The officers and attendants of his court may tremble when he\r\nfrowns, but who else regards it more than they do one of Wood's\r\nfarthings.\r\n\r\n\"There is no comparison,\" says another, \"between the affair of Sir W.\r\nScroggs and this of ------. Sir W. discharged a grand jury because they\r\nwere about to present the Duke of York for being a Papist, but ------\r\ndischarged the grand jury for not presenting a paper he recommended to\r\nthem to present as scandalous, (and in which, I say, he was a party\r\nreflected on.)\"\r\n\r\nI agree there is a mighty difference, but whom does it make for?\r\n\r\nA grand jury of a hundred (part of a county) take upon them to present\r\na no less considerable person than the king's brother and heir\r\npresumptive of the crown, the chief-justice thinks this a matter of too\r\nmuch moment for men of such sort to meddle in, but a matter more proper\r\nfor the consideration of Parliament: I would not be understood to\r\ncondemn the jury; I think they acted as became honest Englishmen and\r\nlovers of their country; But I say if judges could in any case be\r\nallowed to proceed by rules of policy, surely here was a sufficient\r\nexcuse. However the commons impeached him.\r\n\r\nThe determinations of ignorant or wicked judges as they are precedents\r\nof little weight, so they are but of little danger, and therefore it\r\nwill become the commons at all times to animadvert most carefully upon\r\nthe actions of the most knowing men in that profession.\r\n\r\nI say, my lord, _at all times_, because I hear former merit is pleaded\r\nto screen this action from any inquiry.\r\n\r\nI am sensible much is due to the man who has always preferred the public\r\ninterest to his private advantages as -------- has done. When a man has\r\nsignalized himself, when he has suffered for that principle, he deserves\r\nuniversal respect. Yet men should act agreeably to the motive of that\r\nrespect, and not ruin the liberty of their country to shew their\r\ngratitude, and so, my lord, where a man has the least pretence to that\r\ncharacter, I think 'tis best to pass over small offences, but never such\r\nas will entail danger and dishonour upon us and our posterity.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, my lord, when a question was in the senate, whether they\r\nshould ransom fifteen thousand citizens who had merited much by their\r\nformer victories, but losing one battle were taken prisoners; were\r\ndetermined by the advice of that noble Roman Attilius Regulus not to\r\nredeem them as men unworthy their further care, though probably it was\r\ntheir misfortunes not their faults lost that day.\r\n\r\n    Flagitio additis\r\nDamnum: neque amissos colores\r\nLuna refert medicata fuco\r\n\r\nHe thought they were not worthy to be trusted again:----\r\n\r\nTo shew them pity, in his mind, would betray the Romans to perpetual\r\ndanger: _Et exemplo trahenti_\r\n\r\nPerniciem veniens in aevum,\r\nSi non periret immiserabilis\r\nCaptiva pubes\r\n\r\nI hear some precedents have been lately found out to justify that\r\nmemorable action; but if precedents must control reason and justice, if\r\na man may swear he will keep his counsels secret, and yet by precedents\r\nmay be forced to divulge them, I would advise gentlemen very seriously\r\nto consider, the danger we are in; and examine what precedents there are\r\non each side of the question, for my part I think the commons of England\r\nare not a worse precedent than the judges of England.\r\n\r\nBesides it must be remembered that precedents in some cases will not\r\nexcuse a judge, even where they are according to the undoubted law of\r\nthe land, as for instance,\r\n\r\nSuppose a man says what is true, not knowing it to be true, though it be\r\nlogically a truth as it is distinguished, yet it is morally false; and\r\nso, suppose a judge give judgment according to law, not knowing it to be\r\nso, as if he did not know the reason of it at that time, but bethought\r\nhimself of a reason or precedent for it afterwards, though the judgment\r\nbe legal and according to precedent, yet the pronouncing of it is\r\nunjust; and the judge shall be condemned in the opinions of all men: As\r\nhappened to the Lord Chief Justice Popham a person of great learning and\r\nparts, who upon the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh; when Sir Walter\r\nobjected to reading or giving in evidence, Lord Cobham's affidavit,\r\ntaken in his absence, without producing the lord face to face, the lord\r\nbeing then forthcoming: The chief justice overruled the objection, and\r\nwas of opinion it should be given in evidence against Sir Walter, and\r\nsumming up the evidence to the jury the chief justice said, \"Just then\r\nit came into his mind why the accuser should not come face to face to\r\nthe prisoner, because, &c.\" Now if any judge has since found precedents,\r\nor has since picked up the opinion of lawyers, I fear he will come\r\nwithin the case I have put.\r\n\r\nI foresee, if ever this question happens to be debated, _you know\r\nwhere_, gentlemen will be divided; Some will be desirous to do their\r\ncountry justice and free us from all future danger of this kind; Others\r\nupon motives not quite so laudable, will strive to screen, and with\r\nothers private friendship will prevail: But I would recommend to your\r\nfriends, who really love their country, to consider the several\r\ncircumstances concurring in your lordship which probably may not in your\r\nsuccessor: Let them suppose a person were to fill your place, from whose\r\nmanifest ignorance in the law, we may reasonably conclude, his only\r\nmerit is an inveteracy and hatred to this country. I say how could your\r\nbest friends excuse themselves, if in regard to your lordship they\r\nshould suffer such a precedent to be handed down to such a man\r\nunobserved or uncensured?\r\n\r\n_Invenit etiam aemulos infaelix nequitia_--Ambitious men have not always\r\nbeen deterred by the unhappy fate of their predecessors, _Quid si\r\nfloreat vigeatque?_ But what lengths will they run if injustice and\r\ncorruption shall ride triumphant?\r\n\r\nHad somebody received a reprimand upon his knees in a proper place, for\r\ntreating a printer's jury like men convict of perjury, forcing them to\r\nfind a special verdict, I dare to say he had not been quite so hardy as\r\nto have discharged the grand jury or treated them in the manner he did,\r\nbecause they had not an implicit faith in the court; nor had he dared\r\nnot to receive a presentment made by the second grand jury against\r\nWood's farthings upon pretence it was informal, which I mention because\r\nthe worthy Drapier has mistaken the fact.\r\n\r\nSome of your lordship's screens I hear advise you to shew great humility\r\nand contrition for what's past, as the only means to appease the just\r\nindignation all sorts of men have conceived against you.----Were I well\r\nsecured you will not recommend this letter to the next grand jury to be\r\npresented, I could give you more _seasonable advice_, but happen as it\r\nmay I will venture to give you a little.\r\n\r\nFawning and cajoling will have but little effect on those who have had\r\nthe honour of your acquaintance these ten years past, for Caligula who\r\nused to hide his head if he heard the thunder, would piss upon the\r\nstatues of the gods when he thought the danger over--A better expedient\r\nis this,----\r\n\r\nTell men the Drapier is a Tory and a Jacobite.--That he writ \"The\r\nConduct of the Allies.\"--That he writ not his letters with a design to\r\nkeep out Wood's halfpence, but to bring in the Pretender; persuade them\r\nif you can, the dispute is no longer about the power of judges over\r\njuries, nor how much the liberty of the subject is endangered by\r\ndissolving them at pleasure, but that it is now become mere Whig and\r\nTory, a dispute between His Majesty's friends and the Jacobites, and\r\n'twere better to see a thousand grand juries discharged than the Tories\r\ncarry a question though in the right.--_Haec vulnera pro libertate\r\npublica excepi, hunc oculum pro vobis impendi._ Try this cant, pin a\r\ncloth over your eyes, look very dismal, and cry, \"I was turned out of\r\nemployment, when the Drapier was rewarded with a Deanery,\" I say, my\r\nlord, if you can once bring matters thus to bear, I have not the least\r\ndoubt you may escape without censure.\r\n\r\nTo your lordship's zeal and industry without doubt is owing, that the\r\nPapists and the Tories have not delivered this kingdom over to the\r\nPretender, so Caesar conquered Pompey that _Legum auctor et eversor,_\r\nand 'twas but just the liberty and laws of Rome should afterwards depend\r\nupon his will and pleasure.----The Drapier in his letter to Lord\r\nMolesworth has made a fair offer, \"Secure his country from Wood's\r\ncoinage,\" then condemn all he has writ and said as false and scandalous,\r\nwhen your lordship does as much I must confess it will be somewhat\r\ndifficult to discover the impostor.\r\n\r\nThus to keep my word with your lordship, I have much against my\r\ninclinations writ this, which shall be my last upon the ungrateful\r\nsubject.--If I have leisure, and find a safe opportunity of giving it to\r\nthe printer, my next shall explain what has long duped the true Whigs of\r\nthis kingdom.

The\r\nsecond Grand Jury not only repeated the verdict of the first, but issued\r\nthe following expression of its opinion on the matter of Wood and his\r\npatent. [T.S.]]\r\n\r\nWe the Grand Jury of the county of the city of Dublin, this Michaelmas\r\nterm, 1724, having entirely at heart His Majesty's interest and the\r\nwelfare of our country, and being thoroughly sensible of the great\r\ndiscouragement which trade hath suffered by the apprehensions of the\r\nsaid coin, whereof we have already felt the dismal effects, and that the\r\ncurrency thereof will inevitably tend to the great diminution of His\r\nMajesty's revenue, and the ruin of us and our posterity: do present all\r\nsuch persons as have attempted, or shall endeavour by fraud or\r\notherwise, to impose the said halfpence upon us, contrary to His\r\nMajesty's most gracious intentions, as enemies to His Majesty's\r\ngovernment, and to the safety, peace and welfare of all His Majesty's\r\nsubjects of this kingdom, whose affections have been so eminently\r\ndistinguished by their zeal to his illustrious family, before his happy\r\naccession to the throne, and by their continued loyalty ever since.\r\n\r\nAs we do with all just gratitude acknowledge the services of all such\r\npatriots, as have been eminently zealous for the interest of His\r\nMajesty, and this country, in detecting the fraudulent impositions of\r\nthe said Wood, and preventing the passing his base coin: So we do at the\r\nsame time declare our abhorrence and detestation of all reflections on\r\nHis Majesty, and his government, and that we are ready with our lives\r\nand fortunes to defend his most Sacred Majesty against the Pretender and\r\nall His Majesty's open and secret enemies both at home and abroad: Given\r\nunder our hands at the Grand Jury Chamber this 28th, November, 1724.[2]\r\n\r\nGeorge Forbes,             David Tew,\r\nWilliam Empson,            Thomas How,\r\nNathaniel Pearson,         John Jones,\r\nJoseph Nuttall,            James Brown,\r\nWilliam Aston,             Charles Lyndon,\r\nStearn Tighe,              Jerom Bredin,\r\nRichard Walker,            John Sican,\r\nEdmond French,             Anthony Brunton,\r\nJohn Vereilles,            Thomas Gaven,\r\nPhilip Pearson,            Daniel Elwood,\r\nThomas Robins,             John Brunet.\r\nRichard Dawson,\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: On August 20th, 1724, the Grand Jury, and the other\r\ninhabitants of the Liberty of the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick's\r\nwaited on the Dean, and read him the following Declaration, desiring him\r\nto give orders for its publication:\r\n\r\n\"The Declaration of the Grand-Jury, and the rest of the inhabitants of\r\nthe Liberty of the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick's, Dublin.\r\n\r\n\"We, the Grand-Jury, and other inhabitants of the Liberty of the Dean\r\nand Chapter of St. Patrick's, Dublin, whose names are underwritten, do\r\nunanimously declare and determine, that we never will receive or pay any\r\nof the half-pence or farthings already coined, or that shall hereafter\r\nbe coined, by one William Wood, being not obliged by law to receive the\r\nsame; because we are thoroughly convinced by the Addresses of both\r\nHouses of Parliament, as well as by that of his Majesty's most\r\nhonourable Privy-Council, and by the universal opinion of the whole\r\nkingdom, that the currency of the said half-pence and farthings would\r\nsoon deprive us of all our gold and silver, and therefore be of the most\r\ndestructive consequence to the trade and welfare of the nation.\" [T.\r\nS.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION AGAINST THE DRAPIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Oct. 27th,_ 1724.\r\n\r\n\"A proclamation for discovering ye Author of ye Pamphlet intituled A\r\nletter to ye whole people of Ireland, by M.B.

So far as I can learn, Monck\r\nMason seems to have been the first historian to discover it; nor do I\r\nfind the fact mentioned by any of Swift's later biographers.\r\n\r\n\"It was rumoured in Swift's time,\" says Monck Mason, \"but not actually\r\nknown to him\" (see Drapier's Sixth Letter), \"that the Irish Privy\r\nCouncil had addressed his Majesty against Mr. Wood's coin. Having\r\ninspected the papers of the Council office, I shall lay before the\r\nreader the particulars of this event, which were never promulgated,\r\nprobably, because they had not the desired effect, the premier [Walpole]\r\nhaving determined, notwithstanding all opposition or advice, to\r\npersevere in his ill-judged project.\r\n\r\n\"On the 17th April, 1724, at a meeting of the Council, in which the Duke\r\nof Grafton himself presided, it was ordered, that it should be referred\r\nto a committee of the whole board, or of any seven or more, 'to consider\r\nwhat was proper to be done to allay and quiet the great fears of the\r\npeople, occasioned by their apprehensions of William Wood's copper money\r\nbecoming current among them,' On the 6th of May, the committee reported,\r\nthat they had considered the matter referred to them, and were of\r\nopinion, that an address should be sent to his Majesty, of which they\r\nthen presented a draught. It was again on the 19th, referred to a\r\ncommittee of the whole board to prepare a letter, which was accordingly\r\ndone on the next day.--The report was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'To the King's Most Excellent Majesty, the humble address of the Lords\r\nJustices, and Privy-Council.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"'May it please your Majesty,\r\n\r\n\"'We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Justices\r\nand Privy Council, most humbly beg leave, at this time, to give an\r\ninstance of that duty, which, as upon all other occasions, so more\r\nespecially upon such as are of the greatest moment and importance, we\r\nhold ourselves always bound to pay to your Majesty.\r\n\r\n\"'Your Majesty's great council, the High Court of Parliament, being now\r\nprorogued, we conceive ourselves bound, by the trust which your Majesty\r\nhas been pleased to repose in us, and the oaths we have taken, with all\r\nhumility to lay before your Majesty the present state of this your\r\nkingdom, with reference to a great evil that appears to threaten it, to\r\nwhich, if a speedy remedy be not applied, the unavoidable consequence,\r\nas we apprehend, will be, the ruin of multitudes of your Majesty's\r\nsubjects, together with a great diminution of your revenue.\r\n\r\n\"'Though the fears of your Majesty's subjects of this kingdom, in\r\nrelation to the coinage of copper half-pence and farthings, were, in a\r\ngreat measure, allayed by your Majesty's most gracious resolution to do\r\nevery thing in your power for the satisfaction of your people, expressed\r\nin your Majesty's answer to the addresses of both Houses of Parliament;\r\nyet, the repeated intelligence from Great Britain, that William Wood has\r\nthe assurance to persist in his endeavours to introduce his copper\r\nhalf-pence and farthings amongst us, has again alarmed your faithful\r\nsubjects, to such a degree, as already to give a great check to our\r\ninland trade. If the letters patent granted to William Wood should, in\r\nall points, be exactly complied with, the loss to be sustained by taking\r\nhis half-pence and farthings would be much greater than this poor\r\nkingdom is able to bear. But if he, or any other persons, should, for\r\nthe value of gain, be tempted to coin and import even more than double\r\nthe quantity he by his patent is allowed to do, your people here do not\r\nsee how it is possible for your Majesty's chief governors of this your\r\nkingdom, to detect or hinder the cheat.\r\n\r\n\"'It is found by experience, that we have already a sufficient quantity\r\nof half-pence, to serve by way of exchange in the retailing trade, which\r\nis the only use of such sort of money, of which, therefore, we find\r\nourselves to be in no want.\r\n\r\n\"'And since, by the letters patent granted to the same William Wood, no\r\nman is required or commanded to take the said half-pence or farthings,\r\nbut the taking them is left at liberty to those who are willing so to\r\ndo; we most humbly submit it to your royal wisdom and goodness, whether\r\nit may not be for your Majesty's service, and the great satisfaction and\r\ngood of your subjects, and very much tend to the allaying and quieting\r\nof their fears, that your Majesty should cause your royal pleasure to be\r\nsignified to the Commissioners, and other officers of your Majesty's\r\nrevenue in this kingdom, that they neither receive those half-pence and\r\nfarthings, nor give countenance or encouragement to the uttering or\r\nvending of them; or that some other speedy method may be taken to\r\nprevent their becoming current amongst us.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSearching among the pamphlets of the Halliday Collection at the Royal\r\nIrish Academy, Dublin, I came across a tract of twelve pages, printed by\r\nJohn Whaley of Dublin in 1723, with the following title:\r\n\r\n\"The Patentee's Computation of Ireland, in a Letter from the Author of\r\nthe Whitehall Evening-Post concerning the making of Copper-Coin. As also\r\nthe Case and Address of both Houses of Parliament together with His\r\nMajesty's Most Gracious Answer to the House of Lords Address.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer of this tract in defence of the patent maintained the\r\nfollowing propositions:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) That the Kingdom of Ireland wants a Copper Coin.\r\n\r\n(2) That the quantity of this coin will be no inconvenience to it.\r\n\r\n(3) That it is better than ever the Kingdom had, and as good as (in all\r\nprobability) they ever will or can have, and that the Patentee's profit\r\nis not extravagant, as commonly reported.\r\n\r\n(4) That the Kingdom will lose nothing by this coin.\r\n\r\n(5) That the public in Ireland will gain considerably by it, if they\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n(6) That the Kingdom will have £100,000 additional cash.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he states his arguments, they are quite reasonable. On proposition\r\nthree, if his figures are correct, he is especially convincing. He\r\ndetails the cost of manufacture thus:\r\n\r\n                                                     _s.  d._\r\nCopper prepared for the coinage at his Majesty's\r\n  Mint at the Tower of London, costs per pound\r\n  weight                                              1   6\r\n\r\nCoinage of one pound weight                               3-1/2\r\n\r\nWaste and charge of re-melting                            1\r\n\r\nYearly payment to the Exchequer and Comptroller           1\r\n\r\nAllowed to the purchaser for exchange, &c.                5\r\n\r\n                                  Total charge        2   4-1/2\r\n\r\n\"So that the patentee,\" he concludes, \"makes a profit of only 1-1/2_d._\r\nin the half crown or about 5%.\"\r\n\r\nThe tract, however, is more interesting for the reprint it gives of the\r\ntwenty-eight articles stated by the people in objection to the patent\r\nand the coin. I give these articles in full:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND'S CASE HUMBLY PRESENTED TO THE HONOURABLE THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS,\r\nAND BURGESSES IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED\r\n\r\n\r\nMOST HUMBLY SHEWETH,\r\n\r\nWhereas your Honours finding the late Grant or Letters Patents obtained\r\nby Mr. William Wood, for making Three Hundred and Sixty Tun weight of\r\ncopper half-pence for the Kingdom of Ireland, were to be manufactured in\r\nLondon &c. which money is now coining in Bristol, and that the said\r\nmoney was to weigh two shillings and sixpence in each pound weight, and\r\nthat change was to be uttered or passed for all such as were pleased to\r\ntake the same in this Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThat it's humbly conceived Your Honours on considering the following\r\nRemarks, will find the permitting such change to pass, exceeding\r\nInjurious and Destructive to the Nation.\r\n\r\nFirst. That the same will be a means to drain this Kingdom of all its\r\nGold and Silver, and ten, fifteen, or twenty per cent abated, will most\r\neffectually do the same.\r\n\r\n2d. That the making such money in England will give great room for\r\ncounterfeiting that coin, as well in this Kingdom, as where it is made.\r\n\r\n3d. That the Copper Mines of this Island which might be manufactured in\r\nthe nation, is by management shipped off to England by some persons at,\r\nor about forty shillings per tun, by others at four pounds and six\r\npounds per ton, which copper when smelted and refined is sold and sent\r\nback to this kingdom at two shillings and six pence per pound weight as\r\naforesaid, which is two hundred and eighty pound sterl. per ton.\r\n\r\n4th. That two shillings and sixpence per pound weight is making the said\r\ncoin of very small value, the said coin ought not to weigh or exceed two\r\nshillings in each pound weight as the English Halfpence are.\r\n\r\n5th. That all such money brought to this Nation manufactured, is to be\r\nentered at value, which value is in the Book of Rates, ten per cent duty\r\nand excise.\r\n\r\n6th. That no security is given to this Nation to make such money in any\r\none point, the same may be found defective in either, as to baseness of\r\nmetal, workmanship or weight, or to give gold and silver for the same,\r\nwhen the subject was, or may be burthened therewith.\r\n\r\n7th. That if such monies as aforesaid be permitted to pass in this\r\nnation, all persons that have gold or silver by them would not part\r\ntherewith, but Brass money must be carried from House to House on\r\nTruckles, and in the county by carts and horses, with troops to guard\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n8th. That such money will raise the price of all commodities from\r\nabroad, probably to three or four hundred per cent.\r\n\r\n9th. That linen, yarn, beef, butter, tallow, hides and all other\r\ncommodities, will raise to that degree by being bought with half-pence,\r\nand workmen paid with brass money, that commissions from abroad will not\r\nreach them, therefore such goods must lie on hands and remain a drugg.\r\n\r\n10th. That the excise of beer, ale, brandy, &c., and hearth-money will\r\nbe paid in such coin, the same falling first into the hands of the poor\r\nand middling people.\r\n\r\n11th. That if any trouble should happen in this nation, no army could be\r\nraised with such specie, but an enemy in all appearance would be\r\nadmitted with their gold and silver, and which would drive the nation\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n12th. The Courts of Law could not subsist, for all the suits there must\r\nbe supported and maintained with ready money. Viz. Gold and Silver.\r\n\r\n13th. That all the bankers must shut up their shops, no lodgment would\r\nbe made except Halfpence, such as would lodge their money with them,\r\nwould rather draw off and cause a run on them, fearing that their specie\r\nshould be turned into the said brass and copper money.\r\n\r\n14th. That such bills as are drawn to the country, viz. Cork, Limerick,\r\nWaterford, Kingsale, Deny, &c. The Exchange would be instead of a\r\nquarter per cent, twenty per cent and then paid in the said Brass\r\nspecie, by means of its being brought on cars, carts, or waggons, and\r\nguards to attend the same.\r\n\r\n15th. That all the rent in the Kingdom would be paid in half-pence; no\r\nman would give gold or silver, when he had brass money to pay the same.\r\n\r\n16th. That no one can coin or manufacture such a quantity of halfpence\r\nor farthings for this Kingdom, out of the same, but either he must be\r\nruined in the undertaking or the nation undone by his project, in taking\r\nsuch light money, by reason of ten per cent, duty, and probably this\r\nsession be made twenty or thirty per cent duty, and the exchange nine or\r\nten per cent. Ten per cent abated to circulate them. Ten per cent\r\nfactorage, freight, gabberage, key-porters, &c. all which is forty per\r\ncent, charged on the same.\r\n\r\n17th. That if the said Wood was obliged to make his light money not to\r\nexceed two shillings in the pound weight according to the English coin,\r\nhe would give up such grant, for six pence in each pound weight is 25\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n18th. That the said twenty-five per cent is 19,360_l._ sterl. on the\r\nsaid 360 ton of copper, loss to this nation, by being coined out of this\r\nKingdom, besides 80,690_l._ of gold and silver sent out of the Kingdom\r\nfor brass or copper money.\r\n\r\n19th. That the copper mines of this Kingdom is believed to be the metal\r\nsuch copper is made of, which verifies the English saying, That Irish\r\npeople are wild, that would part with 200,000_l._ sterl. of their gold\r\nand silver, for their own copper mines, which cost them not one pound\r\nsterl.\r\n\r\n20th. That the said Wood's factors probably may send in fourteen years\r\ndouble the quantity of copper which is 720 ton, then this Kingdom loses\r\n38,720_l._ sterl. and parts with 161,280_l._ sterl. of their gold and\r\nsilver for almost nothing.\r\n\r\n21st. If any great sum was to be raised by this nation, on any emergency\r\nextraordinary, to serve his Majesty and his Kingdom how would it be\r\npossible to do the same; copper half-pence would not stem the tide, no\r\nsilver now to be had of value, then no gold to be seen.\r\n\r\n22d. That England also must be a great loser by such money, by reason\r\nthe said half-pence being from 20 to 40 grains lighter and less in value\r\nthan their own, so that the same will not pass in that Kingdom scarce\r\nfor farthings a piece, how then shall the vast quantities of goods be\r\npaid for, that are brought from that Kingdom here, a considerable part\r\nof this island must be broke and run away for want of silver and gold to\r\npay them their debts.\r\n\r\n23d. That if the said Wood should get all that money, what power would\r\nhe regard, and what temptation would he be subject unto on that head, he\r\nis but a man, and one almost as little known or heard of, as any one\r\nsubject the king has on this side the water.\r\n\r\n24th. That the vast quantity of sea-coal brought from England here,\r\nwould not be had for such money; the colliers will keep both their ships\r\nand coal at home, before they trade with such a nation, as had their\r\ntreasure turned into brass money.\r\n\r\n25th. That the Army must be paid with such money, none else to be had,\r\nthey would lay down their arms and do no duty, what blood and confusion\r\nthen would attend the same.\r\n\r\n26th. That no people out of any other Kingdom would come into this\r\ncountry to dwell, either to plant or sow, where all their money must be\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\n27th. That the beautiful Quay and river of Dublin which is now lined and\r\nfilled with ships in a most delightful order, would then be scattered to\r\nother harbours, as also the new Range, there and now a building, would\r\nbe left, nothing but empty places all as doleful as the weeping river,\r\ndeserted by her fleets and armies of merchants and traders.\r\n\r\n28th. That the aforesaid scheme is to be viewed and considered by a\r\nKing and Parliament, that will do themselves and their nation justice,\r\nwho will with hearts and hands, stem that tide and current, as never to\r\nsuffer so dutiful and loyal a people to be ruined and undone without\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IX\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTIONS OF THE VARIOUS SPECIMENS OF WOOD'S COINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following descriptions of the various varieties of Wood's coins,\r\ntaken from a note in Monck Mason's \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral\"\r\n(ed. 1819, pp. xcvi-xcvii), may be interesting to the student. The two\r\nvarieties of the coins given as illustrations in this volume are\r\nreproduced from specimens in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nMonck Mason obtains his information from Simon's \"Essay on Irish Coins,\"\r\nDublin, 1749, 4to; Snelling's Supplement to Simon issued in 1767; and\r\nthe edition of Simon's work reprinted in 1810.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of No. II. of this list all of Wood's coins had, on\r\none side, \"the king's head laureat, looking to the left, with this\r\ninscription, GEORGIUS, DEI GRATIA, REX. On the reverse is the figure of\r\nIreland, represented by a woman sitting, beside her, a harp: the\r\ndifferences consist chiefly, in variations in the attitude of the\r\nfigure, and in the date of the coin.\"\r\n\r\nNo. I. 1722.--Hibernia, with both her hands on the harp, which is placed\r\non her right side; her figure is full front, but she looks towards the\r\nright; round her this inscription, HIBERNIA, 1722. (Simon, plate 7,\r\nNumb. 160)\r\n\r\nNo. II. 1722.--Hibernia is seated as in the last, but has her head\r\nturned to the left, on which side there is a rock; round her is\r\ninscribed, HIBERNIA; in the exergue, 1722; on the obverse the usual\r\nhead, the inscription, GEORGIUS D.G. REX. (Snelling, plate 2, Numb. 24.)\r\n\r\nNo. III. 1722.--Hibernia, in profile, looking to the left, holding, in\r\nher right hand, a palm branch, resting her left on a harp; round it,\r\nHIBERNIA, 1722. (Simon, plate 7, Numb. 161.)\r\n\r\nNo. IV. 1723.--Hibernia, as in the last; round her, HIBERNIA, 1723.\r\n(Simon, plate 8, Numb. 169.)\r\n\r\nIt was some of this coin that was submitted to Sir Isaac Newton for\r\nassay.\r\n\r\nNo. V. 1724.--Hibernia, as in the last two, differing only in the date.\r\n(Mentioned by Simon, but no engraving given.)\r\n\r\nNo, VI. 1724.--Hibernia, seated as in the three preceding; round her,\r\nHIBERNIA: in the exergue, 1724. (Snelling, plate 2, Numb. 26.)\r\n\r\nMason notes of this specimen: \"Mr. Snelling does not specify,\r\nparticularly, in what respect this coin differs from those which\r\nprecede; his words are, 'different from any other, and very good work,\r\nespecially the halfpenny, which is the finest and broadest piece of his\r\nmoney I ever saw, and belongs to Mr. Bartlet.' They do not, however,\r\nappear to have attained to circulation in Ireland. A few might, perhaps,\r\nhave been struck off by the patentee, to distribute among his own, and\r\nthe minister's friends.\"\r\n\r\nNo. VII.--Mr. Snelling mentions, \"another halfpenny, which has Hibernia\r\npointing up with one hand to a sun in the top of the piece\"; but of this\r\nhe has not given any engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddison, made keeper of the records of Bermingham's Tower\r\nArmstrong, Sir Thomas, granted a patent to  coin farthings in Ireland\r\nArmstrong, Sir William, granted a patent to coin halfpence in Ireland\r\n\r\nBacon, Lord, on the Royal prerogative, quoted\r\nBerkeley, Lord, of Stratton, Master of the Rolls\r\nBingham, John\r\nBodin, Jean\r\nBoulter, Archbishop\r\nBrodrick, St. John, made a Privy Councillor\r\nBrown, John\r\nBurlington, Earl of, Lord High Treasurer of Ireland\r\n\r\nCarteret, Lord,\r\n  attempts to injure Walpole's reputation by means of the Wood agitation\r\n  made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\r\n  takes Walpole's side\r\n  character of\r\n  Swift's letters to\r\n  his relations with Walpole\r\nCharles I., paid his troops with debased coin\r\nCoinage, the law with reference to\r\n  _See_ Wood's Coinage\r\nCoke,  Sir Edward, on the laws regarding coinage\r\nColeby\r\nConolly, William, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons\r\nCoxe, Archdeacon, his account of the agitation in Ireland\r\n\"Creed of an Irish Commoner, A\"\r\nCrowley, Sir Ambrose\r\n\r\nDartmouth, Lord, granted a patent to coin halfpence in Ireland\r\nDavies, Sir John, his \"Abridgement of Coke's Reports\"\r\n\"Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland, A,\" quoted\r\nDoddington, Bubb\r\nDrapier, the, his account of himself\r\n  proclamation against\r\nDublin, petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs and citizens of\r\nDutch, the, counterfeited debased coinage of Ireland\r\n\r\nElizabeth, Queen, her army paid with base coin\r\n  base money sent to Ireland by\r\nEwing, George, \"Defence of the Conduct of the People of\r\n  Ireland\" published by\r\n\r\nFilmer, Sir Robert\r\nFinley\r\nFrance, system of re coinage in\r\n\r\nGeorge I., equestrian statue of, in Dublin\r\nGrafton, Duke of, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\r\n  recalled\r\n  not concerned with Wood's patent\r\n\r\nHarding, John, arrest and prosecution of\r\nHarley, Robert, Earl of Oxford, Swift's tribute to\r\nHolt, Sir John\r\n\r\nHopkins, Right Hon.
