I have not\r\ngone beyond the printed material, of which there is a vast mass, much of it\r\nof no value, but which contains all and more than is needed to obtain a\r\ncorrect understanding of the man and of his public and private life. No one\r\ncan pretend to write a life of Webster without following in large measure\r\nthe narrative of events as given in the elaborate, careful, and scholarly\r\nbiography which we owe to Mr. George T. Curtis. In many of my conclusions I\r\nhave differed widely from those of Mr. Curtis, but I desire at the outset\r\nto acknowledge fully my obligations to him. I have sought information in\r\nall directions, and have obtained some fresh material, and, as I believe,\r\nhave thrown a new light upon certain points, but this does not in the least\r\ndiminish the debt which I owe to the ample biography of Mr. Curtis in\r\nregard to the details as well as the general outline of Mr. Webster's\r\npublic and private life.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the stout Puritan Commonwealth of Massachusetts firmly\r\nplanted than it began rapidly to throw out branches in all directions. With\r\nevery succeeding year the long, thin, sinuous line of settlements stretched\r\nfarther and farther away to the northeast, fringing the wild shores of the\r\nAtlantic with houses and farms gathered together at the mouths or on the\r\nbanks of the rivers, and with the homes of hardy fishermen which clustered\r\nin little groups beneath the shelter of the rocky headlands. The extension\r\nof these plantations was chiefly along the coast, but there was also a\r\nmovement up the river courses toward the west and into the interior. The\r\nline of northeastern settlements began first to broaden in this way very\r\nslowly but still steadily from the plantations at Portsmouth and Dover,\r\nwhich were nearly coeval with the flourishing towns of the Bay. These\r\nsettlements beyond the Massachusetts line all had one common and marked\r\ncharacteristic. They were all exposed to Indian attack from the earliest\r\ndays down to the period of the Revolution. Long after the dangers of Indian\r\nraids had become little more than a tradition to the populous and\r\nflourishing communities of Massachusetts Bay, the towns and villages of\r\nMaine and New Hampshire continued to be the outposts of a dark and bloody\r\nborder land. French and Indian warfare with all its attendant horrors was\r\nthe normal condition during the latter part of the seventeenth and the\r\nfirst quarter of the eighteenth century. Even after the destruction of the\r\nJesuit missions, every war in Europe was the signal for the appearance of\r\nFrenchmen and savages in northeastern New England, where their course was\r\nmarked by rapine and slaughter, and lighted by the flames of burning\r\nvillages. The people thus assailed were not slow in taking frequent and\r\nthorough vengeance, and so the conflict, with rare intermissions, went on\r\nuntil the power of France was destroyed, and the awful danger from the\r\nnorth, which had hung over the land for nearly a century, was finally\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nThe people who waged this fierce war and managed to make headway in despite\r\nof it were engaged at the same time in a conflict with nature which was\r\nhardly less desperate. The soil, even in the most favored places, was none\r\nof the best, and the predominant characteristic of New Hampshire was the\r\ngreat rock formation which has given it the name of the Granite State.\r\nSlowly and painfully the settlers made their way back into the country,\r\nseizing on every fertile spot, and wringing subsistence and even a certain\r\nprosperity from a niggardly soil and a harsh climate. Their little hamlets\r\ncrept onward toward the base of those beautiful hills which have now become\r\none of the favorite play-grounds of America, but which then frowned grimly\r\neven in summer, dark with trackless forests, and for the larger part of the\r\nyear were sheeted with the glittering, untrampled snow from which they\r\nderive their name. Stern and strong with the force of an unbroken\r\nwilderness, they formed at all times a forbidding background to the sparse\r\nsettlements in the valleys and on the seashore.\r\n\r\nThis life of constant battle with nature and with the savages, this work of\r\nwresting a subsistence from the unwilling earth while the hand was always\r\narmed against a subtle and cruel foe, had, of course, a marked effect upon\r\nthe people who endured it. That, under such circumstances, men should have\r\nsucceeded not only in gaining a livelihood, but should have attained also a\r\ncertain measure of prosperity, established a free government, founded\r\nschools and churches, and built up a small but vigorous and thriving\r\ncommonwealth, is little short of marvellous. A race which could do this had\r\nan enduring strength of character which was sure to make itself felt\r\nthrough many generations, not only on their ancestral soil, but in every\r\nregion where they wandered in search of a fortune denied to them at home.\r\nThe people of New Hampshire were of the English Puritan stock. They were\r\nthe borderers of New England, and were among the hardiest and boldest of\r\ntheir race. Their fierce battle for existence during nearly a century and a\r\nhalf left a deep impress upon them. Although it did not add new traits to\r\ntheir character, it strengthened and developed many of the qualities which\r\nchiefly distinguished the Puritan Englishman. These borderers, from lack of\r\nopportunity, were ruder than their more favored brethren to the south, but\r\nthey were also more persistent, more tenacious, and more adventurous. They\r\nWere a vigorous, bold, unforgiving, fighting race, hard and stern even\r\nbeyond the ordinary standard of Puritanism.\r\n\r\nAmong the Puritans who settled in New Hampshire about the year 1636, during\r\nthe great emigration which preceded the Long Parliament, was one bearing\r\nthe name of Thomas Webster. He was said to be of Scotch extraction, but\r\nwas, if this be true, undoubtedly of the Lowland or Saxon Scotch as\r\ndistinguished from the Gaels of the Highlands. He was, at all events, a\r\nPuritan of English race, and his name indicates that his progenitors were\r\nsturdy mechanics or handicraftsmen. This Thomas Webster had numerous\r\ndescendants, who scattered through New Hampshire to earn a precarious\r\nliving, found settlements, and fight Indians. In Kingston, in the year\r\n1739, was born one of this family named Ebenezer Webster. The struggle for\r\nexistence was so hard for this particular scion of the Webster stock, that\r\nhe was obliged in boyhood to battle for a living and pick up learning as he\r\nbest might by the sole aid of a naturally vigorous mind. He came of age\r\nduring the great French war, and about 1760 enlisted in the then famous\r\ncorps known as \"Rogers's Rangers.\" In the dangers and the successes of\r\ndesperate frontier fighting, the \"Rangers\" had no equal; and of their hard\r\nand perilous experience in the wilderness, in conflict with Indians and\r\nFrenchmen, Ebenezer Webster, strong in body and daring in temperament, had\r\nhis full share.\r\n\r\nWhen the war closed, the young soldier and Indian fighter had time to look\r\nabout him for a home. As might have been expected, he clung to the frontier\r\nto which he was accustomed, and in the year 1763 settled in the\r\nnorthernmost part of the town of Salisbury. Here he built a log-house, to\r\nwhich, in the following year, he brought his first wife, and here he began\r\nhis career as a farmer. At that time there was nothing civilized between\r\nhim and the French settlements of Canada. The wilderness stretched away\r\nfrom his door an ocean of forest unbroken by any white man's habitation;\r\nand in these primeval woods, although the war was ended and the French\r\npower overthrown, there still lurked roving bands of savages, suggesting\r\nthe constant possibilities of a midnight foray or a noonday ambush, with\r\ntheir accompaniments of murder and pillage. It was a fit home, however, for\r\nsuch a man as Ebenezer Webster. He was a borderer in the fullest sense in a\r\ncommonwealth of borderers. He was, too, a splendid specimen of the New\r\nEngland race; a true descendant of ancestors who had been for generations\r\nyeomen and pioneers. Tall, large, dark of hair and eyes, in the rough world\r\nin which he found himself he had been thrown at once upon his own resources\r\nwithout a day's schooling, and compelled to depend on his own innate force\r\nof sense and character for success. He had had a full experience of\r\ndesperate fighting with Frenchmen and Indians, and, the war over, he had\r\nreturned to his native town with his hard-won rank of captain. Then he had\r\nmarried, and had established his home upon the frontier, where he remained\r\nbattling against the grim desolation of the wilderness and of the winter,\r\nand against all the obstacles of soil and climate, with the same hardy\r\nbravery with which he had faced the Indians. After ten years of this life,\r\nin 1774, his wife died and within a twelvemonth he married again.\r\n\r\nSoon after this second marriage the alarm of war with England sounded, and\r\namong the first to respond was the old ranger and Indian fighter, Ebenezer\r\nWebster. In the town which had grown up near his once solitary dwelling he\r\nraised a company of two hundred men, and marched at their head, a splendid\r\nlooking leader, dark, massive, and tall, to join the forces at Boston. We\r\nget occasional glimpses of this vigorous figure during the war. At\r\nDorchester, Washington consulted him about the state of feeling in New\r\nHampshire. At Bennington, we catch sight of him among the first who scaled\r\nthe breastworks, and again coming out of the battle, his swarthy skin so\r\nblackened with dust and gunpowder that he could scarcely be recognized. We\r\nhear of him once more at West Point, just after Arnold's treason, on guard\r\nbefore the general's tent, and Washington says to him, \"Captain Webster, I\r\nbelieve I can trust you.\" That was what everybody seems to have felt about\r\nthis strong, silent, uneducated man. His neighbors trusted him. They gave\r\nhim every office in their gift, and finally he was made judge of the local\r\ncourt. In the intervals of his toilsome and adventurous life he had picked\r\nup a little book-learning, but the lack of more barred the way to the\r\nhigher honors which would otherwise have been easily his. There were\r\nsplendid sources of strength in this man, the outcome of such a race, from\r\nwhich his children could draw. He was, to begin with, a magnificent animal,\r\nand had an imposing bodily presence and appearance. He had courage, energy,\r\nand tenacity, all in high degree. He was business-like, a man of few words,\r\ndetermined, and efficient. He had a great capacity for affection and\r\nself-sacrifice, noble aspirations, a vigorous mind, and, above all, a\r\nstrong, pure character which invited trust. Force of will, force of mind,\r\nforce of character; these were the three predominant qualities in Ebenezer\r\nWebster. His life forms the necessary introduction to that of his\r\ncelebrated son, and it is well worth study, because we can learn from it\r\nhow much that son got from a father so finely endowed, and how far he\r\nprofited by such a rich inheritance.\r\n\r\nBy his first wife, Ebenezer Webster had five children. By his second wife,\r\nAbigail Eastman, a woman of good sturdy New Hampshire stock, he had\r\nlikewise five. Of these, the second son and fourth child was born on the\r\neighteenth of January, 1782, and was christened Daniel. The infant was a\r\ndelicate and rather sickly little being. Some cheerful neighbors predicted\r\nafter inspection that it would not live long, and the poor mother,\r\noverhearing them, caught the child to her bosom and wept over it. She\r\nlittle dreamed of the iron constitution hidden somewhere in the small frail\r\nbody, and still less of all the glory and sorrow to which her baby was\r\ndestined.\r\n\r\nFor many years, although the boy disappointed the village Cassandras by\r\nliving, he continued weak and delicate. Manual labor, which began very\r\nearly with the children of New Hampshire farmers, was out of the question\r\nin his case, and so Daniel was allowed to devote much of his time to play,\r\nfor which he showed a decided aptitude. It was play of the best sort, in\r\nthe woods and fields, where he learned to love nature and natural objects,\r\nto wonder at floods, to watch the habits of fish and birds, and to acquire\r\na keen taste for field sports. His companion was an old British sailor, who\r\ncarried the child on his back, rowed with him on the river, taught him the\r\nangler's art, and, best of all, poured into his delighted ear endless\r\nstories of an adventurous life, of Admiral Byng and Lord George Germaine,\r\nof Minden and Gibraltar, of Prince Ferdinand and General Gage, of Bunker\r\nHill, and finally of the American armies, to which the soldier-sailor had\r\ndeserted. The boy repaid this devoted friend by reading the newspapers to\r\nhim; and he tells us in his autobiography that he could not remember when\r\nhe did not read, so early was he taught by his mother and sisters, in true\r\nNew England fashion. At a very early age he began to go to school;\r\nsometimes in his native town, sometimes in another, as the district school\r\nmoved from place to place. The masters who taught in these schools knew\r\nnothing but the barest rudiments, and even some of those imperfectly. One\r\nof them who lived to a great age, enlightened perhaps by subsequent events,\r\nsaid that Webster had great rapidity of acquisition and was the quickest\r\nboy in school. He certainly proved himself the possessor of a very\r\nretentive memory, for when this pedagogue offered a jack-knife as a reward\r\nto the boy who should be able to recite the greatest number of verses from\r\nthe Bible, Webster, on the following day, when his turn came, arose and\r\nreeled off verses until the master cried \"enough,\" and handed him the\r\ncoveted prize. Another of his instructors kept a small store, and from him\r\nthe boy bought a handkerchief on which was printed the Constitution just\r\nadopted, and, as he read everything and remembered much, he read that\r\nfamous instrument to which he was destined to give so much of his time and\r\nthought. When Mr. Webster said that he read better than any of his masters,\r\nhe was probably right. The power of expression and of speech and readiness\r\nin reply were his greatest natural gifts, and, however much improved by\r\ncultivation, were born in him. His talents were known in the neighborhood,\r\nand the passing teamsters, while they watered their horses, delighted to\r\nget \"Webster's boy,\" with his delicate look and great dark eyes, to come\r\nout beneath the shade of the trees and read the Bible to them with all the\r\nforce of his childish eloquence. He describes his own existence at that\r\ntime with perfect accuracy. \"I read what I could get to read, went to\r\nschool when I could, and when not at school, was a farmer's youngest boy,\r\nnot good for much for want of health and strength, but expected to do\r\nsomething.\" That something consisted generally in tending the saw-mill, but\r\nthe reading went on even there. He would set a log, and while it was going\r\nthrough would devour a book. There was a small circulating library in the\r\nvillage, and Webster read everything it contained, committing most of the\r\ncontents of the precious volumes to memory, for books were so scarce that\r\nhe believed this to be their chief purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1791 the brave old soldier, Ebenezer Webster, was made a judge\r\nof the local court, and thus got a salary of three or four hundred dollars\r\na year. This accession of wealth turned his thoughts at once toward that\r\neducation which he had missed, and he determined that he would give to his\r\nchildren what he had irretrievably lost himself. Two years later he\r\ndisclosed his purpose to his son, one hot day in the hay-field, with a\r\nmanly regret for his own deficiencies and a touching pathos which the boy\r\nnever forgot. The next spring his father took Daniel to Exeter Academy.\r\nThis was the boy's first contact with the world, and there was the usual\r\nsting which invariably accompanies that meeting. His school-mates laughed\r\nat his rustic dress and manners, and the poor little farm lad felt it\r\nbitterly. The natural and unconscious power by which he had delighted the\r\nteamsters was stifled, and the greatest orator of modern times never could\r\nsummon sufficient courage to stand up and recite verses before these Exeter\r\nschool-boys. Intelligent masters, however, perceived something of what was\r\nin the lad, and gave him a kindly encouragement. He rose rapidly in the\r\nclasses, and at the end of nine months his father took him away in order to\r\nplace him as a pupil with a neighboring clergyman. As they drove over,\r\nabout a month later, to Boscawen, where Dr. Wood, the future preceptor,\r\nlived, Ebenezer Webster imparted to his son the full extent of his plan,\r\nwhich was to end in a college education. The joy at the accomplishment of\r\nhis dearest and most fervent wish, mingled with a full sense of the\r\nmagnitude of the sacrifice and of the generosity of his father, overwhelmed\r\nthe boy. Always affectionate and susceptible of strong emotion, these\r\ntidings overcame him. He laid his head upon his father's shoulder and wept.\r\n\r\nWith Dr. Wood Webster remained only six months. He went home on one\r\noccasion, but haying was not to his tastes. He found it \"dull and\r\nlonesome,\" and preferred rambling in the woods with his sister in search of\r\nberries, so that his indulgent father sent him back to his studies. With\r\nthe help of Dr. Wood in Latin, and another tutor in Greek, he contrived to\r\nenter Dartmouth College in August, 1797. He was, of course, hastily and\r\npoorly prepared. He knew something of Latin, very little of Greek, and next\r\nto nothing of mathematics, geography, or history. He had devoured\r\neverything in the little libraries of Salisbury and Boscawen, and thus had\r\nacquired a desultory knowledge of a limited amount of English literature,\r\nincluding Addison, Pope, Watts, and \"Don Quixote.\" But however little he\r\nknew, the gates of learning were open, and he had entered the precincts of\r\nher temple, feeling dimly but surely the first pulsations of the mighty\r\nintellect with which he was endowed.\r\n\r\n\"In those boyish days,\" he wrote many years afterwards, \"there were two\r\nthings which I did dearly love, reading and playing,--passions which did\r\nnot cease to struggle when boyhood was over, (have they yet altogether?)\r\nand in regard to which neither _cita mors_ nor the _victoria laeta_ could\r\nbe said of either.\" In truth they did not cease, these two strong passions.\r\nOne was of the head, the other of the heart; one typified the intellectual,\r\nthe other the animal strength of the boy's nature; and the two contending\r\nforces went with him to the end. The childhood of Webster has a deep\r\ninterest which is by no means usual. Great men in their earliest years are\r\ngenerally much like other boys, despite the efforts of their biographers to\r\nthe contrary. If they are not, they are very apt to be little prigs like\r\nthe second Pitt, full of \"wise saws and modern instances.\" Webster was\r\nneither the one nor the other. He was simple, natural, affectionate, and\r\nfree from pertness or precocity. At the same time there was an innate power\r\nwhich impressed all those who approached him without their knowing exactly\r\nwhy, and there was abundant evidence of uncommon talents. Webster's boyish\r\ndays are pleasant to look upon, but they gain a peculiar lustre from the\r\nnoble character of his father, the deep solicitude of his mother, and the\r\ngenerous devotion and self-sacrifice of both parents. There was in this\r\nsomething prophetic. Every one about the boy was laboring and sacrificing\r\nfor him from the beginning, and this was not without its effect upon his\r\ncharacter. A little anecdote which was current in Boston many years ago\r\ncondenses the whole situation. The story may be true or false,--it is very\r\nprobably unfounded,--but it contains an essential truth and illustrates the\r\ncharacter of the boy and the atmosphere in which he grew up. Ezekiel, the\r\noldest son, and Daniel were allowed on one occasion to go to a fair in a\r\nneighboring town, and each was furnished with a little money from the\r\nslender store at home. When they returned in the evening, Daniel was\r\nradiant with enjoyment; Ezekiel rather silent. Their mother inquired as to\r\ntheir adventures, and finally asked Daniel what he did with his money.\r\n\"Spent it,\" was the reply. \"And what did you do with yours, Ezekiel?\" \"Lent\r\nit to Daniel.\" That answer well sums up the story of Webster's home life in\r\nchildhood. All were giving or lending to Daniel of their money, their time,\r\ntheir activity, their love and affection. This petting was partly due to\r\nWebster's delicate health, but it was also in great measure owing to his\r\nnature. He was one of those rare and fortunate beings who without exertion\r\ndraw to themselves the devotion of other people, and are always surrounded\r\nby men and women eager to do and to suffer for them. The boy accepted all\r\nthat was showered upon him, not without an obvious sense that it was his\r\ndue. He took it in the royal spirit which is characteristic of such\r\nnatures; but in those childish days when laughter and tears came readily,\r\nhe repaid the generous and sacrificing love with the warm and affectionate\r\ngratitude of an earnest nature and a naturally loving heart. He was never\r\ncold, or selfish, or designing. Others loved him, and sacrificed to him,\r\nbut he loved them in return and appreciated their sacrifices. These\r\nconditions of his early days must, however, have had an effect upon his\r\ndisposition and increased his belief in the fitness of having the devotion\r\nof other people as one of his regal rights and privileges, while, at the\r\nsame time, it must have helped to expand his affections and give warmth to\r\nevery generous feeling.\r\n\r\nThe passions for reading and play went with him to Dartmouth, the little\r\nNew Hampshire college of which he was always so proud and so fond. The\r\ninstruction there was of good quality enough, but it was meagre in quantity\r\nand of limited range, compared to what is offered by most good high schools\r\nof the present day. In the reminiscences of his fellow-students there is\r\nabundant material for a picture of Webster at that time. He was recognized\r\nby all as the foremost man in the college, as easily first, with no second.\r\nYet at the same time Mr. Webster was neither a student nor a scholar in the\r\ntruest sense of the words. He read voraciously all the English literature\r\nhe could lay his hands on, and remembered everything he read. He achieved\r\nfamiliarity with Latin and with Latin authors, and absorbed a great deal of\r\nhistory. He was the best general scholar in the college. He was not only\r\nnot deficient but he showed excellence at recitation in every branch of\r\nstudy. He could learn anything if he tried. But with all this he never\r\ngained more than a smattering of Greek and still less of mathematics,\r\nbecause those studies require, for anything more than a fair proficiency, a\r\nlove of knowledge for its own sake, a zeal for learning incompatible with\r\nindolence, and a close, steady, and disinterested attention. These were not\r\nthe characteristics of Mr. Webster's mind. He had a marvellous power of\r\nrapid acquisition, but he learned nothing unless he liked the subject and\r\ntook pleasure in it or else was compelled to the task. This is not the\r\nstuff from which the real student, with an original or inquiring mind, is\r\nmade. It is only fair to say that this estimate, drawn from the opinions of\r\nhis fellow-students, coincided with his own, for he was too large-minded\r\nand too clear-headed to have any small vanity or conceit in judging\r\nhimself. He said soon after he left college, and with perfect truth, that\r\nhis scholarship was not remarkable, nor equal to what he was credited with.\r\nHe explained his reputation after making this confession by saying that he\r\nread carefully, meditated on what he had read, and retained it so that on\r\nany subject he was able to tell all he knew to the best advantage, and was\r\ncareful never to go beyond his depth. There is no better analysis of Mr.\r\nWebster's strongest qualities of mind than this made by himself in\r\nreference to his college standing. Rapid acquisition, quick assimilation of\r\nideas, an iron memory, and a wonderful power of stating and displaying all\r\nhe knew characterized him then as in later life. The extent of his\r\nknowledge and the range of his mind, not the depth or soundness of his\r\nscholarship, were the traits which his companions remembered. One of them\r\nsays that they often felt that he had a more extended understanding than\r\nthe tutors to whom he recited, and this was probably true. The Faculty of\r\nthe college recognized in Webster the most remarkable man who had ever come\r\namong them, but they could not find good grounds to award him the prizes,\r\nwhich, by his standing among his fellows, ought by every rule to have been\r\nat his feet. He had all the promise of a great man, but he was not a fine\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\nHe was studious, punctual, and regular in all his habits. He was so\r\ndignified that his friends would as soon have thought of seeing President\r\nWheelock indulge in boyish disorders as of seeing him. But with all his\r\ndignity and seriousness of talk and manner, he was a thoroughly genial\r\ncompanion, full of humor and fun and agreeable conversation. He had few\r\nintimates, but many friends. He was generally liked as well as universally\r\nadmired, was a leader in the college societies, active and successful in\r\nsports, simple, hearty, unaffected, without a touch of priggishness and\r\nwith a wealth of wholesome animal spirits.\r\n\r\nBut in these college days, besides the vague feeling of students and\r\nprofessors that they had among them a very remarkable man, there is a clear\r\nindication that the qualities which afterwards raised him to fame and power\r\nwere already apparent, and affected the little world about him. All his\r\ncontemporaries of that time speak of his eloquence. The gift of speech, the\r\nunequalled power of statement, which were born in him, just like the\r\nmusical tones of his voice, could not be repressed. There was no recurrence\r\nof the diffidence of Exeter. His native genius led him irresistibly along\r\nthe inevitable path. He loved to speak, to hold the attention of a\r\nlistening audience. He practised off-hand speaking, but he more commonly\r\nprepared himself by meditating on his subject and making notes, which,\r\nhowever, he never used. He would enter the class-room or debating society\r\nand begin in a low voice and almost sleepy manner, and would then gradually\r\nrouse himself like a lion, and pour forth his words until he had his\r\nhearers completely under his control, and glowing with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWe see too, at this time, the first evidence of that other great gift of\r\nbountiful nature in his commanding presence. He was then tall and thin,\r\nwith high cheek bones and dark skin, but he was still impressive. The boys\r\nabout him never forgot the look of his deep-set eyes, or the sound of the\r\nsolemn tones of his voice, his dignity of mien, and his absorption in his\r\nsubject. Above all they were conscious of something indefinable which\r\nconveyed a sense of greatness. It is not usual to dwell so much upon mere\r\nphysical attributes and appearance, but we must recur to them again and\r\nagain, for Mr. Webster's personal presence was one of the great elements of\r\nhis success; it was the fit companion and even a part of his genius, and\r\nwas the cause of his influence, and of the wonder and admiration which\r\nfollowed him, as much almost as anything he ever said or did.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Webster's college career belong the first fruits of his intellect.\r\nHe edited, during one year, a small weekly journal, and thus eked out his\r\nslender means. Besides his strictly editorial labors, he printed some short\r\npieces of his own, which have vanished, and he also indulged in poetical\r\neffusions, which he was fond of sending to absent friends. His rhymes are\r\nwithout any especial character, neither much better nor much worse than\r\nmost college verses, and they have no intrinsic value beyond showing that\r\ntheir author, whatever else he might be, was no poet. But in his own field\r\nsomething of this time, having a real importance, has come down to us. The\r\nfame of his youthful eloquence, so far beyond anything ever known in the\r\ncollege, was noised abroad, and in the year 1800 the citizens of Hanover,\r\nthe college town, asked him to deliver the Fourth of July oration. In this\r\nproduction, which was thought of sufficient merit to deserve printing, Mr.\r\nWebster sketched rapidly and exultingly the course of the Revolution, threw\r\nin a little Federal politics, and eulogized the happy system of the new\r\nConstitution. Of this and his other early orations he always spoke with a\r\ngood deal of contempt, as examples of bad taste, which he wished to have\r\nburied and forgotten. Accordingly his wholesale admirers and supporters who\r\nhave done most of the writing about him, and who always sneezed when Mr.\r\nWebster took snuff, have echoed his opinions about these youthful\r\nproductions, and beyond allowing to them the value which everything\r\nWebsterian has for the ardent worshipper, have been disposed to hurry them\r\nover as of no moment. Compared to the reply to Hayne or the Plymouth\r\noration, the Hanover speech is, of course, a poor and trivial thing.\r\nConsidered, as it ought to be, by itself and in itself, it is not only of\r\ngreat interest as Mr. Webster's first utterance on public questions, but it\r\nis something of which he had no cause to feel ashamed. The sentiments are\r\nhonest, elevated, and manly, and the political doctrine is sound. Mr.\r\nWebster was then a boy of eighteen, and he therefore took his politics from\r\nhis father and his father's friends. For the same reason he was imitative\r\nin style and mode of thought. All boys of that age, whether geniuses or\r\nnot, are imitative, and Mr. Webster, who was never profoundly original in\r\nthought, was no exception to the rule. He used the style of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, then in its decadence, and very florid, inflated, and heavy it\r\nwas. Yet his work was far better and his style simpler and more direct than\r\nthat which was in fashion. He indulged in a good deal of patriotic\r\nglorification. We smile at his boyish Federalism describing Napoleon as\r\n\"the gasconading pilgrim of Egypt,\" and Columbia as \"seated in the forum of\r\nnations, and the empires of the world amazed at the bright effulgence of\r\nher glory.\" These sentences are the acme of fine writing, very boyish and\r\nvery poor; but they are not fair examples of the whole, which is much\r\nsimpler and more direct than might have been expected. Moreover, the\r\nthought is the really important thing. We see plainly that the speaker\r\nbelongs to the new era and the new generation of national measures and\r\nnationally-minded men. There is no colonialism about him. He is in full\r\nsympathy with the Washingtonian policy of independence in our foreign\r\nrelations and of complete separation from the affairs of Europe. But the\r\nmain theme and the moving spirit of this oration are most important of all.\r\nThe boy Webster preached love of country, the grandeur of American\r\nnationality, fidelity to the Constitution as the bulwark of nationality,\r\nand the necessity and the nobility of the union of the States; and that was\r\nthe message which the man Webster delivered to his fellow-men. The enduring\r\nwork which Mr. Webster did in the world, and his meaning and influence in\r\nAmerican history, are all summed up in the principles enunciated in that\r\nboyish speech at Hanover. The statement of the great principles was\r\nimproved and developed until it towered above this first expression as Mont\r\nBlanc does above the village nestled at its foot, but the essential\r\nsubstance never altered in the least.\r\n\r\nTwo other college orations have been preserved. One is a eulogy on a\r\nclassmate who died before finishing his course, the other is a discourse on\r\n\"Opinion,\" delivered before the society of the \"United Fraternity.\" There\r\nis nothing of especial moment in the thought of either, and the improvement\r\nin style over the Hanover speech, though noticeable, is not very marked. In\r\nthe letters of that period, however, amid the jokes and fun, we see that\r\nMr. Webster was already following his natural bent, and turning his\r\nattention to politics. He manifests the same spirit as in his oration, and\r\nshows occasionally an unusual maturity of judgment. His criticism of\r\nHamilton's famous letter to Adams, to take the most striking instance, is\r\nboth keen and sound.\r\n\r\nAfter taking his degree in due course in 1801, Mr. Webster returned to his\r\nnative village, and entered the office of a lawyer next door to his\r\nfather's house, where he began the study of the law in compliance with his\r\nfather's wish, but without any very strong inclination of his own. Here he\r\nread some law and more English literature, and passed a good deal of time\r\nin fishing and shooting. Before the year was out, however, he was obliged\r\nto drop his legal studies and accept the post of schoolmaster in the little\r\ntown of Fryeburg, Maine.\r\n\r\nThis change was due to an important event in the Webster family which had\r\noccurred some time before. The affection existing between Daniel and his\r\nelder brother Ezekiel was peculiarly strong and deep. The younger and more\r\nfortunate son, once started in his education, and knowing the desire of his\r\nelder brother for the same advantages, longed to obtain them for him. One\r\nnight in vacation, after Daniel had been two years at Dartmouth, the two\r\nbrothers discussed at length the all-important question. The next day,\r\nDaniel broached the matter to his father. The judge was taken by surprise.\r\nHe was laboring already under heavy pecuniary burdens caused by the\r\nexpenses of Daniel's education. The farm was heavily mortgaged, and\r\nEbenezer Webster knew that he was old before his time and not destined to\r\nmany more years of life. With the perfect and self-sacrificing courage\r\nwhich he always showed, he did not shrink from this new demand, although\r\nEzekiel was the prop and mainstay of the house. He did not think for a\r\nmoment of himself, yet, while he gave his consent, he made it conditional\r\non that of the mother and daughters whom he felt he was soon to leave. But\r\nMrs. Webster had the same spirit as her husband. She was ready to sell the\r\nfarm, to give up everything for the boys, provided they would promise to\r\ncare in the future for her and their sisters. More utter self-abnegation\r\nand more cheerful and devoted self-sacrifice have rarely been exhibited,\r\nand it was all done with a simplicity which commands our reverence. It was\r\nmore than should have been asked, and a boy less accustomed than Daniel\r\nWebster to the devotion of others, even with the incentive of brotherly\r\nlove, might have shrunk from making the request. The promise of future\r\nsupport was easily made, but the hard pinch of immediate sacrifice had to\r\nbe borne at once. The devoted family gave themselves up to the struggle to\r\nsecure an education for the two boys, and for years they did battle with\r\ndebt and the pressure of poverty. Ezekiel began his studies and entered\r\ncollege the year Daniel graduated; but the resources were running low, so\r\nlow that the law had to be abandoned and money earned without delay; and\r\nhence the schoolmastership.\r\n\r\nAt no time in his life does Mr. Webster's character appear in a fairer or\r\nmore lovable light than during this winter at Fryeburg. He took his own\r\nshare in the sacrifices he had done so much to entail, and he carried it\r\ncheerfully. Out of school hours he copied endless deeds, an occupation\r\nwhich he loathed above all others, in order that he might give all his\r\nsalary to his brother. The burden and heat of the day in this struggle for\r\neducation fell chiefly on the elder brother in the years which followed;\r\nbut here Daniel did his full part, and deserves the credit for it.\r\n\r\nHe was a successful teacher. His perfect dignity, his even temper, and\r\nimperturbable equanimity made his pupils like and respect him. The\r\nsurvivors, in their old age, recalled the impression he made upon them, and\r\nespecially remembered the solemn tones of his voice at morning and evening\r\nprayer, extemporaneous exercises which he scrupulously maintained. His\r\nletters at this time are like those of his college days, full of fun and\r\ngood humor and kind feeling. He had his early love affairs, but was saved\r\nfrom matrimony by the liberality of his affections, which were not confined\r\nto a single object. He laughs pleasantly and good-naturedly over his\r\nfortunes with the fair sex, and talks a good deal about them, but his first\r\nloves do not seem to have been very deep or lasting. Wherever he went, he\r\nproduced an impression on all who saw him. In Fryeburg it was his eyes\r\nwhich people seem to have remembered best. He was still very thin in face\r\nand figure, and he tells us himself that he was known in the village as\r\n\"All-eyes;\" and one of the boys, a friend of later years, refers to Mr.\r\nWebster's \"full, steady, large, and searching eyes.\" There never was a time\r\nin his life when those who saw him did not afterwards speak of his looks,\r\ngenerally either of the wonderful eyes or the imposing presence.\r\n\r\nThere was a circulating library in Fryeburg, and this he read through in\r\nhis usual rapacious and retentive fashion. Here, too, he was called on for\r\na Fourth of July oration. This speech, which has been recently printed,\r\ndwells much on the Constitution and the need of adhering to it in its\r\nentirety. There is a distinct improvement in his style in the direction of\r\nsimplicity, but there is no marked advance in thought or power of\r\nexpression over the Hanover oration. Two months after delivering this\r\naddress he returned to Salisbury and resumed the study of the law in Mr.\r\nThompson's office. He now plunged more deeply into law books, and began to\r\nwork at the law with zeal, while at the same time he read much and\r\nthoroughly in the best Latin authors. In the months which ensued his mind\r\nexpanded, and ambition began to rise within him. His horizon was a limited\r\none; the practice of his profession, as he saw it carried on about him, was\r\nsmall and petty; but his mind could not be shackled. He saw the lions in\r\nthe path plainly, but he also perceived the great opportunities which the\r\nlaw was to offer in the United States, and he prophesied that we, too,\r\nshould soon have our Mansfields and Kenyons. The hand of poverty was heavy\r\nupon him, and he was chafing and beating his wings against the iron bars\r\nwith which circumstances had imprisoned him. He longed for a wider field,\r\nand eagerly desired to finish his studies in Boston, but saw no way to get\r\nthere, except by a \"miracle.\"\r\n\r\nThis miracle came through Ezekiel, who had been doing more for himself and\r\nhis family than any one else, but who, after three years in college, was at\r\nthe end of his resources, and had taken, in his turn, to keeping school.\r\nDaniel went to Boston, and there obtained a good private school for his\r\nbrother. The salary thus earned by Ezekiel was not only sufficient for\r\nhimself, but enabled Daniel to gratify the cherished wish of his heart, and\r\ncome to the New England capital to conclude his professional studies.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to gain admittance to some good office. Mr.\r\nWebster was lucky enough to obtain an introduction to Mr. Gore, with whom,\r\nas with the rest of the world, that wonderful look and manner, apparent\r\neven then, through boyishness and rusticity, stood him in good stead. Mr.\r\nGore questioned him, trusted him, and told him to hang up his hat, begin\r\nwork as clerk at once, and write to New Hampshire for his credentials. The\r\nposition thus obtained was one of fortune's best gifts to Mr. Webster. It\r\nnot only gave him an opportunity for a wide study of the law under wise\r\nsupervision, but it brought him into daily contact with a trained barrister\r\nand an experienced public man. Christopher Gore, one of the most eminent\r\nmembers of the Boston bar and a distinguished statesman, had just returned\r\nfrom England, whither he had been sent as one of the commissioners\r\nappointed under the Jay treaty. He was a fine type of the aristocratic\r\nFederalist leader, one of the most prominent of that little group which\r\nfrom the \"headquarters of good principles\" in Boston so long controlled the\r\npolitics of Massachusetts. He was a scholar, gentleman, and man of the\r\nworld, and his portrait shows us a refined, high-bred face, suggesting a\r\nFrench marquis of the eighteenth century rather than the son of a New\r\nEngland sea-captain. A few years later, Mr. Gore was chosen governor of\r\nMassachusetts, and defeated when a candidate for reëlection, largely, it is\r\nsupposed, because he rode in a coach and four (to which rumor added\r\noutriders) whenever he went to his estate at Waltham. This mode of travel\r\noffended the sensibilities of his democratic constituents, but did not\r\nprevent his being subsequently chosen to the Senate of the United States,\r\nwhere he served a term with much distinction. The society of such a man was\r\ninvaluable to Mr. Webster at this time. It taught him many things which he\r\ncould have learned in no other way, and appealed to that strong taste for\r\neverything dignified and refined which was so marked a trait of his\r\ndisposition and habits. He saw now the real possibilities which he had\r\ndreamed of in his native village; and while he studied law deeply and\r\nhelped his brother with his school, he also studied men still more\r\nthoroughly and curiously. The professional associates and friends of Mr.\r\nGore were the leaders of the Boston bar when it had many distinguished men\r\nwhose names hold high places in the history of American law. Among them\r\nwere Theophilus Parsons, Chief Justice of Massachusetts; Samuel Dexter, the\r\nablest of them all, fresh from service in Congress and the Senate and as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury; Harrison Gray Otis, fluent and graceful as an\r\norator; James Sullivan, and Daniel Davis, the Solicitor-General. All these\r\nand many more Mr. Webster saw and watched, and he has left in his diary\r\ndiscriminating sketches of Parsons and Dexter, whom he greatly admired, and\r\nof Sullivan, of whom he had a poor opinion professionally.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1804, while Mr. Webster was thus pleasantly\r\nengaged in studying his profession, getting a glimpse of the world, and now\r\nand then earning a little money, an opening came to him which seemed to\r\npromise immediate and assured prosperity. The judges of his father's court\r\nof common pleas offered him the vacant clerkship, worth about fifteen\r\nhundred dollars annually. This was wealth to Mr. Webster. With this income\r\nhe could relieve the family from debt, make his father's last years\r\ncomfortable, and smooth Ezekiel's path to the bar. When, however, he\r\nannounced his good luck to Mr. Gore, and his intention of immediately going\r\nhome to accept the position, that gentleman, to Mr. Webster's great\r\nsurprise, strongly urged a contrary course. He pointed out the possible\r\nreduction of the salary, the fact that the office depended on the favor of\r\nthe judges, and, above all, that it led to nothing, and destroyed the\r\nchances of any really great career. This wise mentor said: \"Go on and\r\nfinish your studies. You are poor enough, but there are greater evils than\r\npoverty; live on no man's favor; what bread you do eat, let it be the bread\r\nof independence; pursue your profession, make yourself useful to your\r\nfriends and a little formidable to your enemies, and you have nothing to\r\nfear.\" Mr. Webster, always susceptible to outside influences, saw the\r\nwisdom of this advice, and accepted it. It would have been well if he had\r\nnever swerved even by a hair's breadth from the high and sound principles\r\nwhich it inculcated. He acted then without delay. Going at once to\r\nSalisbury, he broke the news of his unlooked-for determination to his\r\nfather, who was utterly amazed. Pride in his son's high spirit mingled\r\nsomewhat with disappointment at the prospect of continued hardships; but\r\nthe brave old man accepted the decision with the Puritan stoicism which was\r\nso marked a trait in his character, and the matter ended there.\r\n\r\nReturning to Boston, Mr. Webster was admitted to the bar in March, 1805.\r\nMr. Gore moved his admission, and, in the customary speech, prophesied his\r\nstudent's future eminence with a sure knowledge of the latent powers which\r\nhad dictated his own advice in the matter of the clerkship. Soon after\r\nthis, Mr. Webster returned to New Hampshire and opened his office in the\r\nlittle town of Boscawen, in order that he might be near his father. Here he\r\ndevoted himself assiduously to business and study for more than two years,\r\nworking at his profession, and occasionally writing articles for the\r\n\"Boston Anthology.\" During this time he made his first appearance in court,\r\nhis father being on the bench. He gathered together a practice worth five\r\nor six hundred a year, a very creditable sum for a young country\r\npractitioner, and won a reputation which made him known in the State.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1806, after a noble, toiling, unselfish life of sixty-seven\r\nyears, Ebenezer Webster died. Daniel assumed his father's debts, waited\r\nuntil Ezekiel was admitted to the bar, and then, transferring his business\r\nto his brother, moved, in the autumn of 1807, to Portsmouth. This was the\r\nprincipal town of the State, and offered, therefore, the larger field which\r\nhe felt he needed to give his talents sufficient scope. Thus the first\r\nperiod in his life closed, and he started out on the extended and\r\ndistinguished career which lay before him. These early years had been years\r\nof hardship, but they were among the best of his life. Through great\r\ndifficulties and by the self-sacrifice of his family, he had made his way\r\nto the threshold of the career for which he was so richly endowed. He had\r\npassed an unblemished youth; he had led a clean, honest, hard-working life;\r\nhe was simple, manly, affectionate. Poverty had been a misfortune, not\r\nbecause it had warped or soured him, for he smiled at it with cheerful\r\nphilosophy, nor because it had made him avaricious, for he never either\r\nthen or at any time cared for money for its own sake, and nothing could\r\nchill the natural lavishness of his disposition. But poverty accustomed him\r\nto borrowing and to debt, and this was a misfortune to a man of Mr.\r\nWebster's temperament. In those early days he was anxious to pay his debts;\r\nbut they did not lie heavy upon him or carry a proper sense of\r\nresponsibility, as they did to Ezekiel and to his father. He was deeply in\r\ndebt; his books, even, were bought with borrowed money, all which was\r\nnatural and inevitable; but the trouble was that it never seems to have\r\nweighed upon him or been felt by him as of much importance. He was thus\r\nearly brought into the habit of debt, and was led unconsciously to regard\r\ndebts and borrowing as he did the sacrifices of others, as the normal modes\r\nof existence. Such a condition was to be deplored, because it fostered an\r\nunfortunate tendency in his moral nature. With this exception, Mr.\r\nWebster's early years present a bright picture, and one which any man had a\r\nright to regard with pride and affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLAW AND POLITICS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occasion of Mr. Webster's first appearance in court has been the\r\nsubject of varying tradition. It is certain, however, that in the counties\r\nwhere he practised during his residence at Boscawen, he made an unusual and\r\nvery profound impression. The effect then produced is described in homely\r\nphrase by one who knew him well. The reference is to a murder trial, in\r\nwhich Mr. Webster gained his first celebrity.\r\n\r\n     \"There was a man tried for his life, and the judges chose Webster\r\n     to plead for him; and, from what I can learn, he never has spoken\r\n     better than he did there where he first began. He was a black,\r\n     raven-haired fellow, with an eye as black as death's, and as heavy\r\n     as a lion's,--that same heavy look, not sleepy, but as if he didn't\r\n     care about anything that was going on about him or anything\r\n     anywhere else. He didn't look as if he was thinking about anything,\r\n     but as if he _would_ think like a hurricane if he once got waked up\r\n     to it. They say the lion looks so when he is quiet.... Webster\r\n     would sometimes be engaged to argue a case just as it was coming to\r\n     trial. That would set him to thinking. It wouldn't wrinkle his\r\n     forehead, but made him restless. He would shift his feet about, and\r\n     run his hand up over his forehead, through his Indian-black hair,\r\n     and lift his upper lip and show his teeth, which were as white as a\r\n     hound's.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the speech so admired then was infinitely below what was done\r\nafterwards. The very next was probably better, for Mr. Webster grew\r\nsteadily. This observer, however, tells us not what Mr. Webster said, but\r\nhow he looked. It was the personal presence which dwelt with every one at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nThus with his wonderful leonine look and large, dark eyes, and with the\r\ngrowing fame which he had won, Mr. Webster betook himself to Portsmouth. He\r\nhad met some of the leading lawyers already, but now he was to be brought\r\ninto direct and almost daily competition with them. At that period in New\r\nEngland there was a great rush of men of talent to the bar, then casting\r\noff its colonial fetters and emerging to an independent life. The pulpit\r\nhad ceased to attract, as of old; medicine was in its infancy; there were\r\nnone of the other manifold pursuits of to-day, and politics did not offer a\r\ncareer apart. Outside of mercantile affairs, therefore, the intellectual\r\nforces of the old Puritan commonwealths, overflowing with life, and feeling\r\nthe thrill of youthful independence and the confidence of rapid growth in\r\nbusiness, wealth, and population, were concentrated in the law. Even in a\r\nsmall State like New Hampshire, presenting very limited opportunities,\r\nthere was, relatively speaking, an extraordinary amount of ability among\r\nthe members of the bar, notwithstanding the fact that they had but just\r\nescaped from the condition of colonists. Common sense was the divinity of\r\nboth the courts and the profession. The learning was not extensive or\r\nprofound, but practical knowledge, sound principles, and shrewd management\r\nwere conspicuous. Jeremiah Smith, the Chief Justice, a man of humor and\r\ncultivation, was a well read and able judge; George Sullivan was ready of\r\nspeech and fertile in expedients; and Parsons and Dexter of Massachusetts,\r\nboth men of national reputation, appeared from time to time in the New\r\nHampshire courts. Among the most eminent was William Plumer, then Senator,\r\nand afterwards Governor of the State, a well-trained, clear-headed,\r\njudicious man. He was one of Mr. Webster's early antagonists, and defeated\r\nhim in their first encounter. Yet at the same time, although a leader of\r\nthe bar and a United States Senator, he seems to have been oppressed with a\r\nsense of responsibility and even of inequality by this thin, black-eyed\r\nyoung lawyer from the back country. Mr. Plumer was a man of cool and\r\nexcellent judgment, and he thought that Mr. Webster on this occasion was\r\ntoo excursive and declamatory. He also deemed him better fitted by mind and\r\ntemperament for politics than for the law, an opinion fully justified in\r\nthe future, despite Mr. Webster's eminence at the bar. In another case,\r\nwhere they were opposed, Mr. Plumer quoted a passage from Peake's \"Law of\r\nEvidence.\" Mr. Webster criticised the citation as bad law, pronounced the\r\nbook a miserable two-penny compilation, and then, throwing it down with a\r\nfine disdain, said, \"So much for Mr. Thomas Peake's compendium of the 'Law\r\nof Evidence.'\" Such was his manner that every one present appeared to think\r\nthe point settled, and felt rather ashamed of ever having heard of Mr.\r\nPeake or his unfortunate book. Thereupon Mr. Plumer produced a volume of\r\nreports by which it appeared that the despised passage was taken word for\r\nword from one of Lord Mansfield's decisions. The wretched Peake's character\r\nwas rehabilitated, and Mr. Webster silenced. This was an illustration of a\r\nfailing of Mr. Webster at that time. He was rough and unceremonious, and\r\neven overbearing, both to court and bar, the natural result of a new sense\r\nof power in an inexperienced man. This harshness of manner, however, soon\r\ndisappeared. He learned rapidly to practise the stately and solemn courtesy\r\nwhich distinguished him through life.\r\n\r\nThere was one lawyer, however, at the head of his profession in New\r\nHampshire, who had more effect upon Mr. Webster than any other whom he ever\r\nmet there or elsewhere. This was the man to whom the Shaker said: \"By thy\r\nsize and thy language[1] I judge that thou art Jeremiah Mason.\" Mr. Mason\r\nwas one of the greatest common-lawyers this country has ever produced. Keen\r\nand penetrating in intellect, he was master of a relentless logic and of a\r\nstyle which, though simple and homely, was clear and correct to the last\r\npoint. Slow and deliberate in his movements, and sententious in his\r\nutterances, he dealt so powerfully with evidence and so lucidly with\r\nprinciples of law that he rarely failed to carry conviction to his hearers.\r\nHe was particularly renowned for his success in getting verdicts. Many\r\nyears afterwards Mr. Webster gave it as his deliberate opinion that he had\r\nnever met with a stronger intellect, a mind of more native resources or\r\nquicker and deeper vision than were possessed by Mr. Mason, whom in mental\r\nreach and grasp and in closeness of reasoning he would not allow to be\r\nsecond even to Chief Justice Marshall. Mr. Mason on his side, with his\r\nusual sagacity, at once detected the great talents of Mr. Webster. In the\r\nfirst case where they were opposed, a murder trial, Mr. Webster took the\r\nplace of the Attorney-General for the prosecution. Mr. Mason, speaking of\r\nthe impression made by his youthful and then unknown opponent, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"He broke upon me like a thunder shower in July, sudden,\r\n     portentous, sweeping all before it. It was the first case in which\r\n     he appeared at our bar; a criminal prosecution in which I had\r\n     arranged a very pretty defence, as against the Attorney-General,\r\n     Atkinson, who was able enough in his way, but whom I knew very well\r\n     how to take. Atkinson being absent, Webster conducted the case for\r\n     him, and turned, in the most masterly manner, the line of my\r\n     defences, carrying with him all but one of the jurors, so that I\r\n     barely saved my client by my best exertions. I was nevermore\r\n     surprised than by this remarkable exhibition of unexpected power.\r\n     It surpassed, in some respects, anything which I have ever since\r\n     seen even in him.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Mason, as is well known, was six feet seven inches in\r\nheight, and his language, always very forcible and direct, was, when he was\r\nirritated, if we may trust tradition, at times somewhat profane.]\r\n\r\nWith all his admiration for his young antagonist, however, one cannot help\r\nnoticing that the generous and modest but astute counsel for the defence\r\nended by winning his case.\r\n\r\nFortune showered many favors upon Mr. Webster, but none more valuable than\r\nthat of having Jeremiah Mason as his chief opponent at the New Hampshire\r\nbar. Mr. Mason had no spark of envy in his composition. He not only\r\nregarded with pleasure the great abilities of Mr. Webster, but he watched\r\nwith kindly interest the rapid rise which soon made this stranger from the\r\ncountry his principal competitor and the champion commonly chosen to meet\r\nhim in the courts. He gave Mr. Webster his friendship, staunch and\r\nunvarying, until his death; he gave freely also of his wisdom and\r\nexperience in advice and counsel. Best of all was the opportunity of\r\ninstruction and discipline which Mr. Webster gained by repeated contests\r\nwith such a man. The strong qualities of Mr. Webster's mind rapidly\r\ndeveloped by constant practice and under such influences. He showed more\r\nand more in every case his wonderful instinct for seizing on the very heart\r\nof a question, and for extricating the essential points from the midst of\r\nconfused details and clashing arguments. He displayed, too, more strongly\r\nevery day his capacity for close, logical reasoning and for telling retort,\r\nbacked by a passion and energy none the less effective from being but\r\nslowly called into activity. In a word, the unequalled power of stating\r\nfacts or principles, which was the predominant quality of Mr. Webster's\r\ngenius, grew steadily with a vigorous vitality while his eloquence\r\ndeveloped in a similar striking fashion. Much of this growth and\r\nimprovement was due to the sharp competition and bright example of Mr.\r\nMason. But the best lesson that Mr. Webster learned from his wary yet\r\ndaring antagonist was in regard to style. When he saw Mr. Mason go close to\r\nthe jury box, and in a plain style and conversational manner, force\r\nconviction upon his hearers, and carry off verdict after verdict, Mr.\r\nWebster felt as he had never done before the defects of his own modes of\r\nexpression. His florid phrases looked rather mean, insincere, and\r\ntasteless, besides being weak and ineffective. From that time he began to\r\nstudy simplicity and directness, which ended in the perfection of a style\r\nunsurpassed in modern oratory. The years of Mr. Webster's professional life\r\nin Portsmouth under the tuition of Mr. Mason were of inestimable service to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nEarly in this period, also, Mr. Webster gave up his bachelor existence, and\r\nmade for himself a home. When he first appeared at church in Portsmouth the\r\nminister's daughter noted and remembered his striking features and look,\r\nand regarded him as one with great capacities for good or evil. But the\r\ninteresting stranger was not destined to fall a victim to any of the young\r\nladies of Portsmouth. In the spring of 1808 he slipped away from his new\r\nfriends and returned to Salisbury, where, in May, he was married. The bride\r\nhe brought back to Portsmouth was Grace Fletcher, daughter of the minister\r\nof Hopkinton. Mr. Webster is said to have seen her first at church in\r\nSalisbury, whither she came on horseback in a tight-fitting black velvet\r\ndress, and looking, as he said, \"like an angel.\" She was certainly a very\r\nlovely and charming woman, of delicate and refined sensibilities and bright\r\nand sympathetic mind. She was a devoted wife, the object of her husband's\r\nfirst and strongest love, and the mother of his children. It is very\r\npleasant to look at Mr. Webster in his home during these early years of his\r\nmarried life. It was a happy, innocent, untroubled time. He was advancing\r\nin his profession, winning fame and respect, earning a sufficient income,\r\nblessed in his domestic relations, and with his children growing up about\r\nhim. He was social by nature, and very popular everywhere. Genial and\r\naffectionate in disposition, he attached everybody to him, and his hearty\r\nhumor, love of mimicry, and fund of anecdote made him a delightful\r\ncompanion, and led Mr. Mason to say that the stage had lost a great actor\r\nin Webster.\r\n\r\nBut while he was thus enjoying professional success and the contented\r\nhappiness of his fireside, he was slowly but surely drifting into the\r\ncurrent of politics, whither his genius led him, and which had for him an\r\nirresistible attraction. Mr. Webster took both his politics and his\r\nreligion from his father, and does not appear to have questioned either. He\r\nhad a peculiarly conservative cast of mind. In an age of revolution and\r\nscepticism he showed no trace of the questioning spirit which then\r\nprevailed. Even in his earliest years he was a firm believer in existing\r\ninstitutions, in what was fixed and established. He had a little of the\r\ndisposition of Lord Thurlow, who, when asked by a dissenter why, being a\r\nnotorious free-thinker, he so ardently supported the Established Church,\r\nreplied: \"I support the Church of England because it is established.\r\nEstablish your religion, and I'll support that.\" But if Mr. Webster took\r\nhis religion and politics from his father in an unquestioning spirit, he\r\naccepted them in a mild form. He was a liberal Federalist because he had a\r\nwide mental vision, and by nature took broad views of everything. His\r\nfather, on the other hand, was a rigid, intolerant Federalist of a\r\nthorough-going Puritan type. Being taken ill once in a town of Democratic\r\nproclivities, he begged to be carried home. \"I was born a Federalist,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I have lived a Federalist, and I won't die in a Democratic town.\" In\r\nthe same way Ezekiel Webster's uncompromising Federalism shut him out from\r\npolitical preferment, and he would never modify his principles one jot in\r\norder to gain the seat in Congress which he might easily have obtained by\r\nslight concessions. The broad and liberal spirit of Daniel Webster rose\r\nsuperior to the rigid and even narrow opinions of his father and brother,\r\nbut perhaps it would have been better for him if he had had in addition to\r\nhis splendid mind the stern, unbending force of character which made his\r\nfather and brother stand by their principles with immovable Puritan\r\ndetermination. Liberal as he was, however, in his political opinions, the\r\nsame conservative spirit which led him to adopt his creed made him sustain\r\nit faithfully and constantly when he had once accepted it. He was a steady\r\nand trusted party man, although neither then nor at any time a blind,\r\nunreasoning partisan.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster came forward gradually as a political leader by occasional\r\naddresses and speeches, at first with long intervals between them, and then\r\nbecoming more frequent, until at last he found himself fairly engaged in a\r\npublic career. In 1804, at the request of some of his father's friends, he\r\npublished a pamphlet, entitled, \"An Appeal to Old Whigs,\" in the interest\r\nof Gilman, the Federal candidate for governor. He seems to have had a very\r\npoor opinion of this performance, and his interest in the success of the\r\nparty at that juncture was very slight. In 1805 he delivered a Fourth of\r\nJuly oration at Salisbury, which has not been preserved; and in the\r\nfollowing year he gave another before the \"Federal gentlemen\" of Concord,\r\nwhich was published. The tone of this speech is not very partisan, nor does\r\nit exhibit the bitter spirit of the Federalists, although he attacked the\r\nadministration, was violent in urging the protection of commerce, and was\r\nextremely savage in his remarks about France. At times the style is\r\nforcible, and even rich, but, as a rule, it is still strained and\r\nartificial. The oration begins eagerly with an appeal for the Constitution\r\nand the Republic, the ideas always uppermost in Mr. Webster's mind. As a\r\nwhole, it shows a distinct improvement in form, but there are no marks of\r\ngenius to raise it above the ordinary level of Fourth of July speeches. His\r\nnext production was a little pamphlet, published in 1808, on the embargo,\r\nwhich was then paralyzing New England, and crushing out her prosperity.\r\nThis essay is important because it is the first clear instance of that\r\nwonderful faculty which Mr. Webster had of seizing on the vital point of a\r\nsubject, and bringing it out in such a way that everybody could see and\r\nunderstand it. In this case the point was the distinction between a\r\ntemporary embargo and one of unlimited duration. Mr. Webster contended that\r\nthe latter was unconstitutional. The great mischief of the embargo was in\r\nJefferson's concealed intention that it should be unlimited in point of\r\ntime, a piece of recklessness and deceit never fully appreciated until it\r\nhad all passed into history. This Mr. Webster detected and brought out as\r\nthe most illegal and dangerous feature of the measure, while he also\r\ndiscussed the general policy in its fullest extent. In 1809 he spoke before\r\nthe Phi Beta Kappa Society, upon \"The State of our Literature,\" an address\r\nwithout especial interest except as showing a very marked improvement in\r\nstyle, due, no doubt, to the influence of Mr. Mason.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three years Mr. Webster was completely absorbed in the\r\npractice of his profession, and not until the declaration of war with\r\nEngland had stirred and agitated the whole country did he again come before\r\nthe public. The occasion of his reappearance was the Fourth of July\r\ncelebration in 1812, when he addressed the Washington Benevolent Society at\r\nPortsmouth. The speech was a strong, calm statement of the grounds of\r\nopposition to the war. He showed that \"maritime defence, commercial\r\nregulations, and national revenue\" were the very corner-stones of the\r\nConstitution, and that these great interests had been crippled and abused\r\nby the departure from Washington's policy. He developed, with great force,\r\nthe principal and the most unanswerable argument of his party, that the\r\nnavy had been neglected and decried because it was a Federalist scheme,\r\nwhen a navy was what we wanted above all things, and especially when we\r\nwere drifting into a maritime conflict. He argued strongly in favor of a\r\nnaval war, and measures of naval defence, instead of wasting our resources\r\nby an invasion of Canada. So far he went strictly with his party, merely\r\ninvigorating and enforcing their well-known principles. But when he came to\r\ndefining the proper limits of opposition to the war he modified very\r\nessentially the course prescribed by advanced Federalist opinions. The\r\nmajority of that party in New England were prepared to go to the very edge\r\nof the narrow legal line which divides constitutional opposition from\r\ntreasonable resistance. They were violent, bitter, and uncompromising in\r\ntheir language and purposes. From this Mr. Webster was saved by his breadth\r\nof view, his clear perceptions, and his intense national feeling. He says\r\non this point:--\r\n\r\n     \"With respect to the war in which we are now involved, the course\r\n     which our principles require us to pursue cannot be doubtful. It is\r\n     now the law of the land, and as such we are bound to regard it.\r\n     Resistance and insurrection form no part of our creed. The\r\n     disciples of Washington are neither tyrants in power nor rebels\r\n     out. If we are taxed to carry on this war we shall disregard\r\n     certain distinguished examples and shall pay. If our personal\r\n     services are required we shall yield them to the precise extent of\r\n     our constitutional liability. At the same time the world may be\r\n     assured that we know our rights and shall exercise them. We shall\r\n     express our opinions on this, as on every measure of the\r\n     government,--I trust without passion, I am certain without fear. By\r\n     the exercise of our constitutional right of suffrage, by the\r\n     peaceable remedy of election, we shall seek to restore wisdom to\r\n     our councils, and peace to our country.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a sensible and patriotic opposition. It represented the views of\r\nthe moderate Federalists, and traced the lines which Mr. Webster\r\nconsistently followed during the first years of his public life. The\r\naddress concluded by pointing out the French trickery which had provoked\r\nthe war, and by denouncing an alliance with French despotism and ambition.\r\n\r\nThis oration was printed, and ran at once through two editions. It led to\r\nthe selection of Mr. Webster as a delegate to an assembly of the people of\r\nthe county of Rockingham, a sort of mass convention, held in August, 1812.\r\nThere he was placed on the committee to prepare the address, and was chosen\r\nto write their report, which was adopted and published. This important\r\ndocument, widely known at the time as the \"Rockingham Memorial,\" was a\r\ncareful argument against the war, and a vigorous and able presentation of\r\nthe Federalist views. It was addressed to the President, whom it treated\r\nwith respectful severity. With much skill it turned Mr. Madison's own\r\narguments against himself, and appealed to public opinion by its clear and\r\nconvincing reasoning. In one point the memorial differed curiously from the\r\noration of a month before. The latter pointed to the suffrage as the mode\r\nof redress; the former distinctly hinted at and almost threatened secession\r\neven while it deplored a dissolution of the Union as a possible result of\r\nthe administration's policy. In the one case Mr. Webster was expressing his\r\nown views, in the other he was giving utterance to the opinions of the\r\nmembers of his party among whom he stood. This little incident shows the\r\nsusceptibility to outside influences which formed such an odd trait in the\r\ncharacter of a man so imperious by nature. When acting alone, he spoke his\r\nown opinions. When in a situation where public opinion was concentrated\r\nagainst him, he submitted to modifications of his views with a curious and\r\nindolent indifference.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result to Mr. Webster of the ability and tact which he\r\ndisplayed at the Rockingham Convention was his election to the thirteenth\r\nCongress, where he took his seat in May, 1813. There were then many able\r\nmen in the House. Mr. Clay was Speaker, and on the floor were John C.\r\nCalhoun, Langdon Cheves and William Lowndes of South Carolina, Forsyth and\r\nTroup of Georgia, Ingersoll of Pennsylvania, Grundy of Tennessee, and\r\nMcLean of Ohio, all conspicuous in the young nationalist war party. Macon\r\nand Eppes were representatives of the old Jeffersonian Republicans, while\r\nthe Federalists were strong in the possession of such leaders as Pickering\r\nof Massachusetts, Pitkin of Connecticut, Grosvenor and Benson of New York,\r\nHanson of Maryland, and William Gaston of North Carolina. It was a House in\r\nwhich any one might have been glad to win distinction. That Mr. Webster was\r\nconsidered, at the outset, to be a man of great promise is shown by the\r\nfact that he was placed on the Committee on Foreign Relations, of which Mr.\r\nCalhoun was the head, and which, in the war time, was the most important\r\ncommittee of the House.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's first act was a characteristic one. Early in June he\r\nintroduced a set of resolutions calling upon the President for information\r\nas to the time and mode in which the repeal of the French decrees had been\r\ncommunicated to our government. His unerring sagacity in singling out the\r\nweak point in his enemy's armor and in choosing his own keenest weapon, was\r\nnever better illustrated than on this occasion. We know now that in the\r\nnegotiations for the repeal of the decrees, the French government tricked\r\nus into war with England by most profligate lying. It was apparent then\r\nthat there was something wrong, and that either our government had been\r\ndeceived, or had withheld the publication of the repealing decree until war\r\nwas declared, so that England might not have a pretext for rescinding the\r\nobnoxious orders. Either horn of the dilemma, therefore, was disagreeable\r\nto the administration, and a disclosure could hardly fail to benefit the\r\nFederalists. Mr. Webster supported his resolutions with a terse and simple\r\nspeech of explanation, so far as we can judge from the meagre abstract\r\nwhich has come down to us. The resolutions, however, were a firebrand, and\r\nlighted up an angry and protracted debate, but the ruling party, as Mr.\r\nWebster probably foresaw, did not dare to vote them down, and they passed\r\nby large majorities. Mr. Webster spoke but once, and then very briefly,\r\nduring the progress of the debate, and soon after returned to New\r\nHampshire. With the exception of these resolutions, he took no active part\r\nwhatever in the business of the House beyond voting steadily with his\r\nparty, a fact of which we may be sure because he was always on the same\r\nside as that staunch old partisan, Timothy Pickering.\r\n\r\nAfter a summer passed in the performance of his professional duties, Mr.\r\nWebster returned to Washington. He was late in his coming, Congress having\r\nbeen in session nearly three weeks when he arrived to find that he had been\r\ndropped from the Committee on Foreign Relations. The dominant party\r\nprobably discovered that he was a young man of rather too much promise and\r\ntoo formidable an opponent for such an important post. His resolutions had\r\nbeen answered at the previous session, after his departure, and the report,\r\nwhich consisted of a lame explanation of the main point, and an elaborate\r\ndefence of the war, had been quietly laid aside. Mr. Webster desired debate\r\non this subject, and succeeded in carrying a reference of the report to a\r\ncommittee of the whole, but his opponents prevented its ever coming to\r\ndiscussion. In the long session which ensued, Mr. Webster again took\r\ncomparatively little part in general business, but he spoke oftener than\r\nbefore. He seems to have been reserving his strength and making sure of his\r\nground. He defended the Federalists as the true friends of the navy, and he\r\nresisted with great power the extravagant attempt to extend martial law to\r\nall citizens suspected of treason. On January 14, 1814, he made a long and\r\nwell reported speech against a bill to encourage enlistments. This is the\r\nfirst example of the eloquence which Mr. Webster afterwards carried to such\r\nhigh perfection. Some of his subsequent speeches far surpass this one, but\r\nthey differ from it in degree, not in kind. He was now master of the style\r\nat which he aimed. The vehicle was perfected and his natural talent gave\r\nthat vehicle abundance of thought to be conveyed. The whole speech is\r\nsimple in form, direct and forcible. It has the elasticity and vigor of\r\ngreat strength, and glows with eloquence in some passages. Here, too, we\r\nsee for the first time that power of deliberate and measured sarcasm which\r\nwas destined to become in his hands such a formidable weapon. The florid\r\nrhetoric of the early days is utterly gone, and the thought comes to us in\r\nthose short and pregnant sentences and in the choice and effective words\r\nwhich were afterwards so typical of the speaker. The speech itself was a\r\nparty speech and a presentation of party arguments. It offered nothing new,\r\nbut the familiar principles had hardly ever been stated in such a striking\r\nand impressive fashion. Mr. Webster attacked the war policy and the conduct\r\nof the war, and advocated defensive warfare, a navy, and the abandonment of\r\nthe restrictive laws that were ruining our commerce, which had been the\r\nmain cause of the adoption of the Constitution. The conclusion of this\r\nspeech is not far from the level of Mr. Webster's best work. It is too long\r\nfor quotation, but a few sentences will show its quality:--\r\n\r\n     \"Give up your futile projects of invasion. Extinguish the fires\r\n     that blaze on your inland frontier. Establish perfect safety and\r\n     defence there by adequate force. Let every man that sleeps on your\r\n     soil sleep in security. Stop the blood that flows from the veins of\r\n     unarmed yeomanry and women and children. Give to the living time to\r\n     bury and lament their dead in the quietness of private sorrow.\r\n     Having performed this work of beneficence and mercy on your inland\r\n     border, turn, and look with the eye of justice and compassion on\r\n     your vast population along the coast. Unclench the iron grasp of\r\n     your embargo. Take measures for that end before another sun\r\n     sets.... Let it no longer be said that not one ship of force, built\r\n     by your hands, yet floats upon the ocean.... If then the war must\r\n     be continued, go to the ocean. If you are seriously contending for\r\n     maritime rights, go to the theatre where alone those rights can be\r\n     defended. Thither every indication of your fortune points you.\r\n     There the united wishes and exertions of the nation will go with\r\n     you. Even our party divisions, acrimonious as they are, cease at\r\n     the water's edge.\"\r\n\r\nEvents soon forced the policy urged by Mr. Webster upon the administration,\r\nwhose friends carried first a modification of the embargo, and before the\r\nclose of the session introduced a bill for its total repeal. The difficult\r\ntask of advocating this measure devolved upon Mr. Calhoun, who sustained\r\nhis cause more ingeniously than ingenuously. He frankly admitted that\r\nrestriction was a failure as a war measure, but he defended the repeal on\r\nthe ground that the condition of affairs in Europe had changed since the\r\nrestrictive policy was adopted. It had indeed changed since the embargo of\r\n1807, but not since the imposition of that of 1813, which was the one under\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun laid himself open to most unmerciful retorts, which was his\r\nmisfortune, not his fault, for the embargo had been utterly and hopelessly\r\nwrong from the beginning. Mr. Webster, however, took full advantage of the\r\nopportunity thus presented. His opening congratulations are in his best\r\nvein of stately sarcasm, and are admirably put. He followed this up by a\r\nnew argument of great force, showing the colonial spirit of the restrictive\r\npolicy. He also dwelt with fresh vigor on the identification with France\r\nnecessitated by the restrictive laws, a reproach which stung Mr. Calhoun\r\nand his followers more than anything else. He then took up the embargo\r\npolicy and tore it to pieces,--no very difficult undertaking, but well\r\nperformed. The shifty and shifting policy of the government was especially\r\ndistasteful to Mr. Webster, with his lofty conception of consistent and\r\nsteady statesmanship, a point which is well brought out in the following\r\npassage:--\r\n\r\n     \"In a commercial country, nothing can be more objectionable than\r\n     frequent and violent changes. The concerns of private business do\r\n     not endure such rude shocks but with extreme inconvenience and\r\n     great loss. It would seem, however, that there is a class of\r\n     politicians to whose taste all change is suited, to whom whatever\r\n     is unnatural seems wise, and all that is violent appears great....\r\n     The Embargo Act, the Non-Importation Act, and all the crowd of\r\n     additions and supplements, together with all their garniture of\r\n     messages, reports, and resolutions, are tumbling undistinguished\r\n     into one common grave. But yesterday this policy had a thousand\r\n     friends and supporters; to-day it is fallen and prostrate, and few\r\n     'so poor as to do it reverence.' Sir, a government which cannot\r\n     administer the affairs of a nation without so frequent and such\r\n     violent alterations in the ordinary occupations and pursuits of\r\n     private life, has, in my opinion, little claim to the regard of the\r\n     community.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is very characteristic of Mr. Webster's temperament in dealing\r\nwith public affairs, and is a very good example of his power of dignified\r\nreproach and condemnation.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun had said at the close of his speech, that the repeal of the\r\nrestrictive measures should not be allowed to affect the double duties\r\nwhich protected manufactures. Mr. Webster discussed this point at length,\r\ndefining his own position, which was that of the New England Federalists,\r\nwho believed in free trade as an abstract principle, and considered\r\nprotection only as an expedient of which they wanted as little as possible.\r\nMr. Webster set forth these views in his usual effective and lucid manner,\r\nbut they can be considered more fitly at the period when he dealt with the\r\ntariff as a leading issue of the day and of his own public life.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster took no further action of importance at this session, not even\r\nparticipating in the great debate on the loan bill; but, by the manner in\r\nwhich these two speeches were referred to and quoted in Congress for many\r\ndays after they were delivered, we can perceive the depth of their first\r\nimpression. I have dwelt upon them at length because they are not in the\r\ncollected edition of his speeches, where they well deserve a place, and,\r\nstill more, because they are the first examples of his parliamentary\r\neloquence which show his characteristic qualities and the action of his\r\nmind. Mr. Webster was a man of slow growth, not reaching his highest point\r\nuntil he was nearly fifty years of age, but these two speeches mark an\r\nadvanced stage in his progress. The only fresh point that he made was when\r\nhe declared that the embargo was colonial in spirit; and this thought\r\nproceeded from the vital principle of Mr. Webster's public life, his\r\nintense love for nationality and union, which grew with his growth and\r\nstrengthened with his strength. In other respects, these speeches presented\r\nsimply the arguments and opinions of his party. They fell upon the ear of\r\nCongress and the country with a new and ringing sound because they were\r\nstated so finely and with such simplicity. Certainly one of them, and\r\nprobably both, were delivered without any immediate preparation, but they\r\nreally had the preparation of years, and were the utterance of thoughts\r\nwhich had been garnered up by long meditation. He wisely confined himself\r\nat this time to a subject which had been long before his mind, and upon\r\nwhich he had gathered all the essential points by observation and by a\r\nstudy of the multitude of speeches and essays with which the country had\r\nbeen deluged. These early speeches, like some of the best of his prime,\r\nalthough nominally unprepared, were poured forth from the overflowing\r\nresources which had been the fruit of months of reflection, and which had\r\nbeen stored up by an unyielding memory. They had really been in preparation\r\never since the embargo pamphlet of 1808, and that was one reason for their\r\nripeness and terseness, for their easy flow and condensed force. I have\r\nexamined with care the debates in that Congress. There were many able and\r\nexperienced speakers on the floor. Mr. Clay, it is true, took no part, and\r\nearly in the session went to Europe. But Mr. Calhoun led in debate, and\r\nthere were many others second only to him. Among all the speeches, however,\r\nMr. Webster's stand out in sharp relief. His utterances were as clear and\r\ndirect as those of Mr. Calhoun, but they had none of the South Carolinian's\r\ndryness. We can best judge of their merit and their effect by comparing\r\nthem with those of his associates. They were not only forcible, but they\r\nwere vivid also and full of life, and his words when he was roused fell\r\nlike the blows of a hammer on an anvil. They lacked the polish and richness\r\nof his later efforts, but the force and power of statement and the purity\r\nof diction were all there, and men began to realize that one destined to\r\ngreat achievements had entered the field of American politics.\r\n\r\nThis was very apparent when Mr. Webster came back to Washington for the\r\nextra session called in September, 1814. Although he had made previously\r\nbut two set speeches, and had taken comparatively little part in every-day\r\ndebate, he was now acknowledged, after his few months of service, to be one\r\nof the foremost men in the House, and the strongest leader in his party. He\r\ndiffered somewhat at this time from the prevailing sentiment of the\r\nFederalists in New England, for the guiding principle of his life, his love\r\nof nationality, overrode all other influences. He discountenanced the\r\nmeasures which led to the Hartford Convention, and he helped to keep New\r\nHampshire out of that movement; but it is an entire mistake to represent\r\nhim as an independent Federalist at this period. The days of Mr. Webster's\r\nindependent politics came later, when the Federalists had ceased to exist\r\nas a party and when no new ties had been formed. In the winter of 1814 and\r\n1815, although, like many of the moderate Federalists, he disapproved of\r\nthe separatist movement in New England, on all other party questions he\r\nacted consistently with the straitest of the sect. Sensibly enough, he did\r\nnot consider the convention at Hartford, although he had nothing to do with\r\nit, either treasonable or seditious; and yet, much as he disliked its\r\nsupposed purposes, he did not hesitate, in a speech on the Enlistment Bill,\r\nto use them as a threat to deter the administration from war measures. This\r\nwas a favorite Federalist practice, gloomily to point out at this time the\r\ngathering clouds of domestic strife, in order to turn the administration\r\nback from war, that poor frightened administration of Mr. Madison, which\r\nhad for months been clutching frantically at every straw which seemed to\r\npromise a chance of peace.\r\n\r\nBut although Mr. Webster went as steadily and even more strongly with his\r\nparty in this session, he did more and better service than ever before,\r\npartly, perhaps, because on the questions which arose, his party was, in\r\nthe main, entirely right. The strength of his party feeling is shown by his\r\nattitude in regard to the war taxes, upon which he made a quiet but\r\neffective speech. He took the ground that, as a member of the minority, he\r\ncould not prevent the taxes nor stop hostilities, but he could protest\r\nagainst the war, its conduct, and its authors, by voting against the taxes.\r\nThere is a nice question of political ethics here as to how far an\r\nopposition ought to go in time of national war and distress, but it is\r\ncertainly impossible to give a more extreme expression to parliamentary\r\nopposition than to refuse the supplies at a most critical moment in a\r\nsevere conflict. To this last extreme of party opposition to the\r\nadministration, Mr. Webster went. It was as far as he could go and remain\r\nloyal to the Union. But there he stopped absolutely. With the next step,\r\nwhich went outside the Union, and which his friends at home were\r\nconsidering, he would have nothing to do, and he would not countenance any\r\nseparatist schemes. In the national Congress, however, he was prepared to\r\nadvance as far as the boldest and bitterest in opposition, and he either\r\nvoted against the war taxes or abstained from voting on them, in company\r\nwith the strictest partisans of the Pickering type.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to suppose from this that Mr. Webster had lost in the\r\nleast the liberality or breadth of view which always characterized him. He\r\nwas no narrower then than when he entered Congress, or than when he left\r\nit. He went with his party because he believed it to be right,--as at that\r\nmoment it undoubtedly was. The party, however, was still extreme and\r\nbitter, as it had been for ten years, but Mr. Webster was neither. He went\r\nall lengths with his friends in Congress, but he did not share their\r\nintensity of feeling or their fierce hostility to individuals. The\r\nFederalists, for instance, as a rule had ceased to call upon Mr. Madison,\r\nbut in such intolerance Mr. Webster declined to indulge. He was always on\r\ngood terms with the President and with all the hostile leaders. His\r\nopposition was extreme in principle, but not in manner; it was vigorous and\r\nuncompromising, but also stately and dignified. It was part of his large\r\nand indolent nature to accept much and question little; to take the ideas\r\nmost easy and natural to him, those of his friends and associates, and of\r\nhis native New England, without needless inquiry and investigation. It was\r\npart of the same nature, also, to hold liberal views after he had fairly\r\ntaken sides, and never, by confounding individuals with principles and\r\npurposes, to import into politics the fiery, biting element of personal\r\nhatred and malice.\r\n\r\nHis position in the House once assured, we find Mr. Webster taking a much\r\nmore active part in the daily debates than before. On these occasions we\r\nhear of his \"deliberate, conversational\" manner, another of the lessons\r\nlearned from Mr. Mason when that gentleman, standing so close to the\r\njury-box that he could have \"laid his finger on the foreman's nose,\" as Mr.\r\nWebster said, chatted easily with each juryman, and won a succession of\r\nverdicts. But besides the daily debate, Mr. Webster spoke at length on\r\nseveral important occasions. This was the case with the Enlistment Bill,\r\nwhich involved a forced draft, including minors, and was deemed\r\nunconstitutional by the Federalists. Mr. Webster had \"a hand,\" as he puts\r\nit,--a strong one, we may be sure,--in killing \"Mr. Monroe's conscription.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important measure, however, with which Mr. Webster was called to\r\ndeal, and to which he gave his best efforts, was the attempt to establish a\r\nnational bank. There were three parties in the House on this question. The\r\nfirst represented the \"old Republican\" doctrines, and was opposed to any\r\nbank. The second represented the theories of Hamilton and the Federalists,\r\nand favored a bank with a reasonable capital, specie-paying, and free to\r\ndecide about making loans to the government. The third body was composed of\r\nmembers of the national war-party, who were eager for a bank merely to help\r\nthe government out of its appalling difficulties. They, therefore, favored\r\nan institution of large capital, non-specie-paying, and obliged to make\r\nheavy loans to the government, which involved, of course, an irredeemable\r\npaper currency. In a word, there was the party of no bank, the party of a\r\nspecie bank, and the party of a huge paper-money bank. The second of these\r\nparties, with which of course Mr. Webster acted, held the key of the\r\nsituation. No bank could be established unless it was based on their\r\nprinciples. The first bill, proposing a paper-money bank, originated in the\r\nHouse, and was killed there by a strong majority, Mr. Webster making a long\r\nspeech against it which has not been preserved. The next bill came from the\r\nSenate, and was also for a paper-money bank. Against this scheme Mr.\r\nWebster made a second elaborate speech, which is reprinted in his works.\r\nHis genius for arranging and stating facts held its full strength in\r\nquestions of finance, and he now established his reputation as a master in\r\nthat difficult department of statesmanship. His recent studies of\r\neconomical questions in late English works and in English history gave\r\nfreshness to what he said, and in clearness of argument, in range of view,\r\nand wisdom of judgment, he showed himself a worthy disciple of the school\r\nof Hamilton. His argument proceeded on the truest economical and commercial\r\nprinciples, and was, indeed, unanswerable. He then took his stand as the\r\nfoe of irredeemable paper, whether in war or peace, and of wild,\r\nunrestrained banking, a position from which he never wavered, and in\r\nsupport of which he rendered to the country some of his best service as a\r\npublic man. The bill was defeated by the casting vote of the Speaker. When\r\nthe result was announced, Mr. Calhoun was utterly overwhelmed. He cared\r\nlittle for the bank but deeply for the government, which, as it was not\r\nknown that peace had been made, seemed to be on the verge of ruin. He came\r\nover to Mr. Webster, and, bursting into tears, begged the latter to aid in\r\nestablishing a proper bank, a request which was freely granted.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then reconsidered, the bill recommitted and brought back, with\r\na reduced capital, and freed from the government power to force loans and\r\nsuspend specie payments. This measure was passed by a large majority,\r\ncomposed of the Federalists and the friends of the government, but it was\r\nthe plan of the former which had prevailed. The President vetoed the bill\r\nfor a variety of reasons, duly stated, but really, as Mr. Webster said,\r\nbecause a sound bank of this sort was not in favor with the administration.\r\nAnother paper-money scheme was introduced, and the conflict began again,\r\nbut was abruptly terminated by the news of peace, and on March 4 the\r\nthirteenth Congress came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth Congress, to which he had been reëlected, Mr. Webster said\r\nmany years afterward, was the most remarkable for talents of any he had\r\never seen. To the leaders of marked ability in the previous Congress, most\r\nof whom had been reëlected, several others were added. Mr. Clay returned\r\nfrom Europe to take again an active part. Mr. Pinkney, the most eminent\r\npractising lawyer in the country, recently Attorney-General and Minister to\r\nEngland, whom John Randolph, with characteristic insolence, \"believed to be\r\nfrom Maryland,\" was there until his appointment to the Russian mission.\r\nLast, but not least, there was John Randolph himself, wildly eccentric and\r\nvenomously eloquent,--sometimes witty, always odd and amusing, talking\r\nincessantly on everything, so that the reporters gave him up in despair,\r\nand with whom Mr. Webster came to a definite understanding before the close\r\nof the session.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster did not take his seat until February, being detained at the\r\nNorth by the illness of his daughter Grace. When he arrived he found\r\nCongress at work upon a bank bill possessing the same objectionable\r\nfeatures of paper money and large capital as the former schemes which he\r\nhad helped to overthrow. He began his attack upon this dangerous plan by\r\nconsidering the evil condition of the currency. He showed that the currency\r\nof the United States was sound because it was gold and silver, in his\r\nopinion the only constitutional medium, but that the country was flooded by\r\nthe irredeemable paper of the state banks. Congress could not regulate the\r\nstate banks, but they could force them to specie payments by refusing to\r\nreceive any notes which were not paid in specie by the bank which issued\r\nthem. Passing to the proposed national bank, he reiterated the able\r\narguments which he had made in the previous Congress against the large\r\ncapital, the power to suspend specie payments, and the stock feature of the\r\nbank, which he thought would lead to speculation and control by the state\r\nbanks. This last point is the first instance of that financial foresight\r\nfor which Mr. Webster was so remarkable, and which shows so plainly the\r\nsoundness of his knowledge in regard to economical matters. A violent\r\nspeculation in bank stock did ensue, and the first years of the new\r\ninstitution were troubled, disorderly, and anything but creditable. The\r\nopposition of Mr. Webster and those who thought with him, resulted in the\r\nreduction of the capital and the removal of the power to suspend specie\r\npayments. But although shorn of its most obnoxious features, Mr. Webster\r\nvoted against the bill on its final passage on account of the participation\r\npermitted to the government in its management. He was quite right, but,\r\nafter the bank was well established, he supported it as Lord Thurlow\r\npromised to do in regard to the dissenter's religion. Indeed, Mr. Webster\r\nultimately so far lost his original dislike to this bank that he became one\r\nof its warmest adherents. The plan was defective, but the scheme, on the\r\nwhole, worked better than had been expected.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the passage of the bank bill, Mr. Calhoun introduced a\r\nbill requiring the revenue to be collected in lawful money of the United\r\nStates. A sharp debate ensued, and the bill was lost. Mr. Webster at once\r\noffered resolutions requiring all government dues to be paid in coin, in\r\nTreasury notes, or in notes of the Bank of the United States. He supported\r\nthese resolutions, thus daringly put forward just after the principle they\r\ninvolved had been voted down, in a speech of singular power, clear,\r\nconvincing, and full of information and illustration. He elaborated the\r\nideas contained in his previous remarks on the currency, displaying with\r\ngreat force the evils of irredeemable paper, and the absolute necessity of\r\na sound currency based on specie payments. He won a signal victory by the\r\npassage of his resolutions, which brought about resumption, and, after the\r\nbank was firmly established, gave us a sound currency and a safe medium of\r\nexchange. This was one of the most conspicuous services ever rendered by\r\nMr. Webster to the business interests and good government of the country,\r\nand he deserves the full credit, for he triumphed where Mr. Calhoun had\r\njust been defeated.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster took more or less part in all the questions which afterwards\r\narose in the House, especially on the tariff, but his great efforts were\r\nthose devoted to the bank and the currency. The only other incident of the\r\nsession was an invitation to fight a duel sent him by John Randolph. This\r\nwas the only challenge ever received by Mr. Webster. He never could have\r\nseemed a very happy subject for such missives, and, moreover, he never\r\nindulged in language calculated to provoke them. Randolph, however, would\r\nhave challenged anybody or anything, from Henry Clay to a field-mouse, if\r\nthe fancy happened to strike him. Mr. Webster's reply is a model of dignity\r\nand veiled contempt. He refused to admit Randolph's right to an\r\nexplanation, alluded to that gentleman's lack of courtesy in the House,\r\ndenied his right to call him out, and wound up by saying that he did not\r\nfeel bound to risk his life at any one's bidding, but should \"always be\r\nprepared to repel, in a suitable manner, the aggression of any man who may\r\npresume on this refusal.\" One cannot help smiling over this last clause,\r\nwith its suggestion of personal violence, as the two men rise before the\r\nfancy,--the big, swarthy black-haired son of the northern hills, with his\r\nrobust common sense, and the sallow, lean, sickly Virginia planter, not\r\nmany degrees removed mentally from the patients in Bedlam.\r\n\r\nIn the affairs of the next session of the fourteenth Congress Mr. Webster\r\ntook scarcely any part. He voted for Mr. Calhoun's internal improvement\r\nbill, although without entering the debate, and he also voted to pass the\r\nbill over Mr. Madison's veto. This was sound Hamiltonian Federalism, and in\r\nentire consonance with the national sentiments of Mr. Webster. On the\r\nconstitutional point, which he is said to have examined with some care, he\r\ndecided in accordance with the opinions of his party, and with the doctrine\r\nof liberal construction, to which he always adhered.\r\n\r\nOn March 4, 1817, the fourteenth Congress expired, and with it the term of\r\nMr. Webster's service. Five years were to intervene before he again\r\nappeared in the arena of national politics. This retirement from active\r\npublic life was due to professional reasons. In nine years Mr. Webster had\r\nattained to the very summit of his profession in New Hampshire. He was\r\nearning two thousand dollars a year, and in that hardy and poor community\r\nhe could not hope to earn more. To a man with such great and productive\r\ntalents, and with a growing family, a larger field had become an absolute\r\nnecessity. In June, 1816, therefore, Mr. Webster removed from Portsmouth to\r\nBoston. That he gained by the change is apparent from the fact that the\r\nfirst year after his removal his professional income did not fall short of\r\ntwenty thousand dollars. The first suggestion of the possibilities of\r\nwealth offered to his abilities in a suitable field came from his going to\r\nWashington. There, in the winter of 1813 and 1814, he was admitted to the\r\nbar of the Supreme Court of the United States, before which he tried two or\r\nthree cases, and this opened the vista of a professional career, which he\r\nfelt would give him verge and room enough, as well as fit remuneration.\r\nFrom this beginning the Supreme Court practice, which soon led to the\r\nremoval to Boston, rapidly increased, until, in the last session of his\r\nterm, it occupied most of his time. This withdrawal from the duties of\r\nCongress, however, was not due to a sacrifice of his time to his\r\nprofessional engagements, but to the depression caused by his first great\r\ngrief, which must have rendered the noise and dust of debate most\r\ndistasteful to him. Mr. and Mrs. Webster had arrived in Washington for this\r\nlast session, in December, 1816, and were recalled to Boston by the illness\r\nof their little daughter Grace, who was their oldest child, singularly\r\nbright and precocious, with much of her father's look and talent, and of\r\nher mother's sensibility. She was a favorite with her father, and tenderly\r\nbeloved by him. After her parents' return she sank rapidly, the victim of\r\nconsumption. When the last hour was at hand, the child, rousing from sleep,\r\nasked for her father. He came, raised her upon his arm, and, as he did so,\r\nshe smiled upon him and died. It is a little incident in the life of a\r\ngreat man, but a child's instinct does not err at such a moment, and her\r\ndying smile sheds a flood of soft light upon the deep and warm affections\r\nof Mr. Webster's solemn and reserved nature. It was the first great grief.\r\nMr. Webster wept convulsively as he stood beside the dead, and those who\r\nsaw that stately creature so wrung by anguish of the heart never forgot the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThus the period which began at Portsmouth in 1807 closed in Boston, in\r\n1817, with the death of the eldest born. In that decade Mr. Webster had\r\nadvanced with great strides from the position of a raw and youthful lawyer\r\nin a back country town of New Hampshire. He had reached the highest\r\nprofessional eminence in his own State, and had removed to a wider sphere,\r\nwhere he at once took rank with the best lawyers. He was a leading\r\npractitioner in the highest national court. During his two terms in\r\nCongress he had become a leader of his party, and had won a solid national\r\nreputation. In those years he had rendered conspicuous service to the\r\nbusiness interests of the nation, and had established himself as one of the\r\nablest statesmen of the country in matters of finance. He had defined his\r\nposition on the tariff as a free-trader in theory and a very moderate\r\nprotectionist when protection was unavoidable, a true representative of the\r\ndoctrine of the New England Federalists. He had taken up his ground as the\r\nchampion of specie payments and of the liberal interpretation of the\r\nConstitution, which authorized internal improvements. While he had not\r\nshrunk from extreme opposition to the administration during the war, he had\r\nkept himself entirely clear from the separatist sentiment of New England in\r\nthe year 1814. He left Congress with a realizing sense of his own growing\r\npowers, and, rejoicing in his strength, he turned to his profession and to\r\nhis new duties in his new home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE.--MR. WEBSTER AS A LAWYER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a vague tradition that when Mr. Webster took up his residence in\r\nBoston, some of the worthies of that ancient Puritan town were disposed at\r\nfirst to treat him rather cavalierly and make him understand that because\r\nhe was great in New Hampshire it did not follow that he was also great in\r\nMassachusetts. They found very quickly, however, that it was worse than\r\nuseless to attempt anything of this sort with a man who, by his mere look\r\nand presence whenever he entered a room, drew all eyes to himself and\r\nhushed the murmur of conversation. It is certain that Mr. Webster soon\r\nfound himself the friend and associate of all the agreeable and\r\ndistinguished men of the town, and that he rapidly acquired that general\r\npopularity which, in those days, went with him everywhere. It is also\r\ncertain that he at once and without effort assumed the highest position at\r\nthe bar as the recognized equal of its most eminent leaders. With an income\r\nincreased tenfold and promising still further enlargement, a practice in\r\nwhich one fee probably surpassed the earnings of three months in New\r\nHampshire, with an agreeable society about him, popular abroad, happy and\r\nbeloved at home, nothing could have been more auspicious than these opening\r\nyears of his life in Boston.\r\n\r\nThe period upon which he then entered, and during which he withdrew from\r\nactive public service to devote himself to his profession, was a very\r\nimportant one in his career. It was a period marked by a rapid intellectual\r\ngrowth and by the first exhibition of his talents on a large scale. It\r\nembraces, moreover, two events, landmarks in the life of Mr. Webster, which\r\nplaced him before the country as one of the first and the most eloquent of\r\nher constitutional lawyers, and as the great master in the art of\r\noccasional oratory. The first of these events was the argument in the\r\nDartmouth College case; the second was the delivery of the Plymouth\r\noration.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter into or discuss the merits or demerits of the\r\nconstitutional and legal theories and principles involved in the famous\r\n\"college causes,\" or in any other of the great cases subsequently argued by\r\nMr. Webster. In a biography of this kind it is sufficient to examine Mr.\r\nWebster's connection with the Dartmouth College case, and endeavor, by a\r\nstudy of his arguments in that and in certain other hardly less important\r\ncauses, to estimate properly the character and quality of his abilities as\r\na lawyer, both in the ordinary acceptation of the term and in dealing with\r\nconstitutional questions.\r\n\r\nThe complete history of the Dartmouth College case is very curious and\r\ndeserves more than a passing notice. Until within three years it is not too\r\nmuch to say that it was quite unknown, and its condition is but little\r\nbetter now. In 1879 Mr. John M. Shirley published a volume entitled the\r\n\"Dartmouth College Causes,\" which is a monument of careful study and\r\nthorough research. Most persons would conclude that it was a work of merely\r\nlegal interest, appealing to a limited class of professional readers. Even\r\nthose into whose hands it chanced to come have probably been deterred from\r\nexamining it as it deserves by the first chapter, which is very obscure,\r\nand by the confusion of the narrative which follows. Yet this monograph,\r\nwhich has so unfortunately suffered from a defective arrangement of\r\nmaterial, is of very great value, not only to our legal and constitutional\r\nhistory, but to the political history of the time and to a knowledge of the\r\ndistinguished actors in a series of events which resulted in the\r\nestablishment of one of the most far-reaching of constitutional doctrines,\r\none that has been a living question ever since the year 1819, and is at\r\nthis moment of vast practical importance. Mr. Shirley has drawn forth from\r\nthe oblivion of manuscript a collection of documents which, taken in\r\nconjunction with those already in print, throws a flood of light upon a\r\ndark place of the past and gives to a dry constitutional question the vital\r\nand human interest of political and personal history.\r\n\r\nIn his early days, Eleazer Wheelock, the founder of Dartmouth College, had\r\nhad much religious controversy with Dr. Bellamy of Connecticut, who was\r\nlike himself a graduate of Yale. Wheelock was a Presbyterian and a liberal,\r\nBellamy a Congregationalist and strictly orthodox. The charter of Dartmouth\r\nwas free from any kind of religious discrimination. By his will the elder\r\nWheelock provided in such a way that his son succeeded him in the\r\npresidency of the college. In 1793 Judge Niles, a pupil of Bellamy, became\r\na trustee of the college, and he and John Wheelock represented the opposite\r\nviews which they respectively inherited from tutor and father. They were\r\nformed for mutual hostility, and the contest began some twelve years before\r\nit reached the public. The trustees and the president were then all\r\nFederalists, and there would seem to have been no differences of either a\r\npolitical or a religious nature. The trouble arose from the resistance of a\r\nminority of the trustees to what they termed the \"family dynasty.\"\r\nWheelock, however, maintained his ascendency until 1809, when his enemies\r\nobtained a majority in the board of trustees, and thereafter admitted no\r\nfriend of the president to the government, and used every effort to subdue\r\nthe dominant dynasty.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire, at that period, the Federalists were the ruling party,\r\nand the Congregationalists formed the state church. The people were, in\r\npractice, taxed to support Congregational churches, and the clergy of that\r\ndenomination were exempted from taxation. All the Congregational ministers\r\nwere stanch Federalists and most of their parishioners were of the same\r\nparty. The college, the only seat of learning in the State, was one of the\r\nFederalist and Congregational strongholds.\r\n\r\nAfter several years of fruitless and bitter conflict, the Wheelock party,\r\nin 1815, brought their grievances before the public in an elaborate\r\npamphlet. This led to a rejoinder and a war of pamphlets ensued, which was\r\nsoon transferred to the newspapers, and created a great sensation and a\r\nprofound interest. Wheelock now contemplated legal proceedings. Mr. Plumer\r\nwas in ill health, Judge Smith and Mr. Mason were allied with the trustees,\r\nand the president therefore went to Mr. Webster, consulted him\r\nprofessionally, paid him, and obtained a promise of his future services.\r\nAbout the time of this consultation, Wheelock sent a memorial to the\r\nLegislature, charging the trustees with misapplication of the funds, and\r\nvarious breaches of trust, religious intolerance, and a violation of the\r\ncharter in their attacks upon the presidential office, and prayed for a\r\ncommittee of investigation. The trustees met him boldly and offered a\r\nsturdy resistance, denying all the charges, especially that of religious\r\nintolerance; but the committee was voted by a large majority. On August\r\n5th, Wheelock, as soon as he learned that the committee was to have a\r\nhearing, wrote to Mr. Webster, reminding him of their consultation,\r\ninclosing a fee of twenty dollars, and asking him to appear before the\r\ncommittee. Mr. Webster did not come, and Wheelock had to go on as best he\r\ncould without him. One of Wheelock's friends, Mr. Dunham, wrote a very\r\nindignant letter to Mr. Webster on his failure to appear; to which Mr.\r\nWebster replied that he had seen Wheelock and they had contemplated a suit\r\nin court, but that at the time of the hearing he was otherwise engaged, and\r\nmoreover that he did not regard a summons to appear before a legislative\r\ncommittee as a professional call, adding that he was by no means sure that\r\nthe president was wholly in the right. The truth was, that many of Mr.\r\nWebster's strongest personal and political friends, and most of the leaders\r\nwith whom he was associated in the control of the Federalist party, were\r\neither trustees themselves or closely allied with the trustees. In the\r\ninterval between the consultation with Wheelock and the committee hearing,\r\nthese friends and leaders saw Mr. Webster, and pointed out to him that he\r\nmust not desert them, and that this college controversy was fast developing\r\ninto a party question. Mr. Webster was convinced, and abandoned Wheelock,\r\nmaking, as has been seen, a very unsatisfactory explanation of his conduct.\r\nIn this way he finally parted company with Wheelock, and was thereafter\r\nirrevocably engaged on the side of the trustees.\r\n\r\nEvents now moved rapidly. The trustees, without heeding the advice of Mr.\r\nMason to delay, removed Wheelock from the presidency, and appointed in his\r\nplace the Rev. Francis Brown. This fanned the flame of popular excitement,\r\nand such a defiance of the legislative committee threw the whole question\r\ninto politics. As Mr. Mason had foreseen when he warned the trustees\r\nagainst hasty action, all the Democrats, all members of sects other than\r\nthe Congregational, and all freethinkers generally, were united against the\r\ntrustees, and consequently against the Federalists. The election came on.\r\nWheelock, who was a Federalist, went over to the enemy, carrying his\r\nfriends with him, and Mr. Plumer, the Democratic candidate, was elected\r\nGovernor, together with a Democratic Legislature. Mr. Webster perceived at\r\nonce that the trustees were in a bad position. He advised that every effort\r\nshould be made to soothe the Democrats, and that the purpose of founding a\r\nnew college should be noised abroad, in order to create alarm. Strategy,\r\nhowever, was vain. Governor Plumer declared against the trustees in his\r\nmessage, and the Legislature in June, 1816, despite every sort of protest\r\nand remonstrance, passed an act to reorganize the college, and virtually to\r\nplace it within the control of the State. The Governor and council at once\r\nproceeded to choose trustees and overseers under the new law, and among\r\nthose thus selected was Joseph Story of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBoth boards of trustees assembled. The old board turned out Judge Woodward,\r\ntheir secretary, who was a friend to Wheelock and secretary also of the new\r\nboard, and, receiving a thousand dollars from a friend of one of the\r\nprofessors, resolved to fight. President Brown refused to obey the summons\r\nof the new trustees, who expelled the old board by resolution. Thereupon\r\nthe old board brought suit against Woodward for the college seal and other\r\nproperty, and the case came on for trial in May, 1817. Mr. Mason and Judge\r\nSmith appeared for the college, George Sullivan and Ichabod Bartlett for\r\nWoodward and the state board. The case was argued and then went over to the\r\nSeptember term of the same year, at Exeter, when Mason and Smith were\r\njoined by Mr. Webster.\r\n\r\nThe cause was then argued again on both sides and with signal ability. In\r\npoint of talent the counsel for the college were vastly superior to their\r\nopponents, but Sullivan and Bartlett were nevertheless strong men and\r\nthoroughly prepared. Sullivan was a good lawyer and a fluent and ready\r\nspeaker, with great power of illustration. Bartlett was a shrewd,\r\nhard-headed man, very keen and incisive, and one whom it was impossible to\r\noutwit or deceive. He indulged, in his argument, in some severe reflections\r\nupon Mr. Webster's conduct toward Wheelock, which so much incensed Mr.\r\nWebster that he referred to Mr. Bartlett's argument in a most contemptuous\r\nway, and strenuously opposed the publication of the remarks \"personal or\r\ninjurious to counsel.\"\r\n\r\nThe weight of the argument for the college fell upon Mason and Smith, who\r\nspoke for two and four hours respectively. Sullivan and Bartlett occupied\r\nthree hours, and the next day Mr. Webster closed for the plaintiffs in a\r\nspeech of two hours. Mr. Webster spoke with great force, going evidently\r\nbeyond the limits of legal argument, and winding up with a splendid\r\nsentimental appeal which drew tears from the crowd in the Exeter\r\ncourt-room, and which he afterwards used in an elaborated form and with\r\nsimilar effect before the Supreme Court at Washington.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes necessary to state briefly the points at issue in this case,\r\nwhich were all fully argued by the counsel on both sides. Mr. Mason's\r\nbrief, which really covered the whole case, was that the acts of the\r\nLegislature were not obligatory, 1, because they were not within the\r\ngeneral scope of legislative power; 2, because they violated certain\r\nprovisions of the Constitution of New Hampshire restraining legislative\r\npower; 3, because they violated the Constitution of the United States. In\r\nFarrar's report of Mason's speech, twenty-three pages are devoted to the\r\nfirst point, eight to the second, and six to the third. In other words, the\r\nthird point, involving the great constitutional doctrine on which the case\r\nwas finally decided at Washington, the doctrine that the Legislature, by\r\nits acts, had impaired the obligation of a contract, was passed over\r\nlightly. In so doing Mr. Mason was not alone. Neither he nor Judge Smith\r\nnor Mr. Webster nor the court nor the counsel on the other side, attached\r\nmuch importance to this point. Curiously enough, the theory had been\r\noriginated many years before, by Wheelock himself, at a time when he\r\nexpected that the minority of the trustees would invoke the aid of the\r\nLegislature against him, and his idea had been remembered. It was revived\r\nat the time of the newspaper controversy, and was pressed upon the\r\nattention of the trustees and upon that of their counsel. But the lawyers\r\nattached little weight to the suggestion, although they introduced it and\r\nargued it briefly. Mason, Smith, and Webster all relied for success on the\r\nground covered by the first point in Mason's brief. This is called by Mr.\r\nShirley the \"Parsons view,\" from the fact that it was largely drawn from an\r\nargument made by Chief Justice Parsons in regard to visitatorial powers at\r\nHarvard College. Briefly stated, the argument was that the college was an\r\ninstitution founded by private persons for particular uses; that the\r\ncharter was given to perpetuate such uses; that misconduct of the trustees\r\nwas a question for the courts, and that the Legislature, by its\r\ninterference, transcended its powers. To these general principles,\r\nstrengthened by particular clauses in the Constitution of New Hampshire,\r\nthe counsel for the college trusted for victory. The theory of impairing\r\nthe obligation of contracts they introduced, but they did not insist on it,\r\nor hope for much from it. On this point, however, and, of course, on this\r\nalone, the case went up to the Supreme Court. In December, 1817, Mr.\r\nWebster wrote to Mr. Mason, regretting that the case went up on \"one point\r\nonly.\" He occupied himself at this time in devising cases which should\r\nraise what he considered the really vital points, and which, coming within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States, could be taken to the Circuit Court,\r\nand thence to the Supreme Court at Washington. These cases, in accordance\r\nwith his suggestion, were begun, but before they came on in the Circuit\r\nCourt, Mr. Webster made his great effort in Washington. Three quarters of\r\nhis legal argument were there devoted to the points in the Circuit Court\r\ncases, which were not in any way before the Supreme Court in the College\r\nvs. Woodward. So little, indeed, did Mr. Webster think of the great\r\nconstitutional question which has made the case famous, that he forced the\r\nother points in where he admitted that they had no proper standing, and\r\nargued them at length. They were touched upon by Marshall, who, however,\r\ndecided wholly upon the constitutional question, and they were all thrown\r\naside by Judge Washington, who declared them irrelevant, and rested his\r\ndecision solely and properly on the constitutional point. Two months after\r\nhis Washington argument, Mr. Webster, still urging forward the Circuit\r\nCourt cases, wrote to Mr. Mason that all the questions must be brought\r\nproperly before the Supreme Court, and that, on the \"general principle\"\r\nthat the State Legislature could not divest vested rights, strengthened by\r\nthe constitutional provisions of New Hampshire, he was sure they could\r\ndefeat their adversaries. Thus this doctrine of \"impairing the obligation\r\nof contracts,\" which produced a decision in its effects more far-reaching\r\nand of more general interest than perhaps any other ever made in this\r\ncountry, was imported into the case at the suggestion of laymen, was little\r\nesteemed by counsel, and was comparatively neglected in every argument.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to go back now, for a moment, in the history of the case.\r\nThe New Hampshire court decided against the plaintiffs on every point, and\r\ngave a very strong and elaborate judgment, which Mr. Webster acknowledged\r\nwas \"able, plausible, and ingenious.\" After much wrangling, the counsel\r\nagreed on a special verdict, and took the case up on a writ of error to the\r\nSupreme Court. Mason and Smith were unable or unwilling to go to\r\nWashington, and the case was intrusted to Mr. Webster, who secured the\r\nassistance of Mr. Joseph Hopkinson of Philadelphia. The case for the State,\r\nhitherto ably managed, was now confided to Mr. John Holmes of Maine, and\r\nMr. Wirt, the Attorney-General, who handled it very badly. Holmes, an\r\nactive, fluent Democratic politician, made a noisy, rhetorical, political\r\nspeech, which pleased his opponents and disgusted his clients and their\r\nfriends. Mr. Wirt, loaded with business cares of every sort, came into\r\ncourt quite unprepared, and endeavored to make up for his deficiencies by\r\ndeclamation. On the other side the case was managed with consummate skill.\r\nHopkinson was a sound lawyer, and, being thoroughly prepared, made a good\r\nlegal argument. The burden of the conflict was, however, borne by Mr.\r\nWebster, who was more interested personally than professionally, and who,\r\nhaving raised money in Boston to defray the expenses of the suit, came into\r\nthe arena at Washington armed to the teeth, and in the full lustre of his\r\ngreat powers.\r\n\r\nThe case was heard on March 10, 1818, and was opened by Mr. Webster. He had\r\nstudied the arguments of his adversaries below, and the vigorous hostile\r\nopinion of the New Hampshire judges. He was in possession of the thorough\r\nargument emanating from the penetrating mind of Mr. Mason and fortified and\r\nextended by the ample learning and judicial wisdom of Judge Smith. To the\r\nwork of his eminent associates he could add nothing more than one not very\r\nimportant point, and a few cases which his far-ranging and retentive memory\r\nsupplied. All the notes, minutes, and arguments of Smith and Mason were in\r\nhis hands. It is only just to say that Mr. Webster tells all this himself,\r\nand that he gives all credit to his colleagues, whose arguments he says \"he\r\nclumsily put together,\" and of which he adds that he could only be the\r\nreciter. The faculty of obtaining and using the valuable work of other men,\r\none of the characteristic qualities of a high and commanding order of mind,\r\nwas even then strong in Mr. Webster. But in that bright period of early\r\nmanhood it was accompanied by a frank and generous acknowledgment of all\r\nand more than all the intellectual aid he received from others. He truly\r\nand properly awarded to Mason and Smith all the credit for the law and for\r\nthe legal points and theories set forth on their side, and modestly says\r\nthat he was merely the arranger and reciter of other men's thoughts. But\r\nhow much that arrangement and recitation meant! There were, perhaps, no\r\nlawyers better fitted than Mason and Smith to examine a case and prepare an\r\nargument enriched with everything that learning and sagacity could suggest.\r\nBut when Mr. Webster burst upon the court and the nation with this great\r\nappeal, it was certain that there was no man in the land who could so\r\narrange arguments and facts, who could state them so powerfully and with\r\nsuch a grand and fitting eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe legal part of the argument was printed in Farrar's report and also in\r\nWheaton's, after it had been carefully revised by Mr. Webster with the\r\narguments of his colleagues before him. This legal and constitutional\r\ndiscussion shows plainly enough Mr. Webster's easy and firm grasp of facts\r\nand principles, and his power of strong, effective, and lucid statement;\r\nbut it is in its very nature dry, cold, and lawyer-like. It gives no\r\nconception of the glowing vehemence of the delivery, or of those omitted\r\nportions of the speech which dealt with matters outside the domain of law,\r\nand which were introduced by Mr. Webster with such telling and important\r\nresults. He spoke for five hours, but in the printed report his speech\r\noccupies only three pages more than that of Mr. Mason in the court below.\r\nBoth were slow speakers, and thus there is a great difference in time to be\r\naccounted for, even after making every allowance for the peroration which\r\nwe have from another source, and for the wealth of legal and historical\r\nillustration with which Mr. Webster amplified his presentation of the\r\nquestion. \"Something was left out,\" Mr. Webster says, and that something\r\nwhich must have occupied in its delivery nearly an hour was the most\r\nconspicuous example of the generalship by which Mr. Webster achieved\r\nvictory, and which was wholly apart from his law. This art of management\r\nhad already been displayed in the treatment of the cases made up for the\r\nCircuit Courts, and in the elaborate and irrelevant legal discussion which\r\nMr. Webster introduced before the Supreme Court. But this management now\r\nentered on a much higher stage, where it was destined to win victory, and\r\nexhibited in a high degree tact and knowledge of men. Mr. Webster was fully\r\naware that he could rely, in any aspect of the case, upon the sympathy of\r\nMarshall and Washington. He was equally certain of the unyielding\r\nopposition of Duvall and Todd; the other three judges, Johnson, Livingston,\r\nand Story, were known to be adverse to the college, but were possible\r\nconverts. The first point was to increase the sympathy of the Chief Justice\r\nto an eager and even passionate support. Mr. Webster knew the chord to\r\nstrike, and he touched it with a master hand. This was the \"something left\r\nout,\" of which we know the general drift, and we can easily imagine the\r\neffect. In the midst of all the legal and constitutional arguments,\r\nrelevant and irrelevant, even in the pathetic appeal which he used so well\r\nin behalf of his Alma Mater, Mr. Webster boldly and yet skilfully\r\nintroduced the political view of the case. So delicately did he do it that\r\nan attentive listener did not realize that he was straying from the field\r\nof \"mere reason\" into that of political passion. Here no man could equal\r\nhim or help him, for here his eloquence had full scope, and on this he\r\nrelied to arouse Marshall, whom he thoroughly understood. In occasional\r\nsentences he pictured his beloved college under the wise rule of\r\nFederalists and of the Church. He depicted the party assault that was made\r\nupon her. He showed the citadel of learning threatened with unholy invasion\r\nand falling helplessly into the hands of Jacobins and freethinkers. As the\r\ntide of his resistless and solemn eloquence, mingled with his masterly\r\nargument, flowed on, we can imagine how the great Chief Justice roused like\r\nan old war-horse at the sound of the trumpet. The words of the speaker\r\ncarried him back to the early years of the century, when, in the full flush\r\nof manhood, at the head of his court, the last stronghold of Federalism,\r\nthe last bulwark of sound government, he had faced the power of the\r\ntriumphant Democrats. Once more it was Marshall against Jefferson,--the\r\njudge against the President. Then he had preserved the ark of the\r\nConstitution. Then he had seen the angry waves of popular feeling breaking\r\nvainly at his feet. Now, in his old age, the conflict was revived.\r\nJacobinism was raising its sacrilegious hand against the temples of\r\nlearning, against the friends of order and good government. The joy of\r\nbattle must have glowed once more in the old man's breast as he grasped\r\nanew his weapons and prepared with all the force of his indomitable will to\r\nraise yet another constitutional barrier across the path of his ancient\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nWe cannot but feel that Mr. Webster's lost passages, embodying this\r\npolitical appeal, did the work, and that the result was settled when the\r\npolitical passions of the Chief Justice were fairly aroused. Marshall would\r\nprobably have brought about the decision by the sole force of his imperious\r\nwill. But Mr. Webster did a good deal of effective work after the arguments\r\nwere all finished, and no account of the case would be complete without a\r\nglance at the famous peroration with which he concluded his speech and in\r\nwhich he boldly flung aside all vestige of legal reasoning, and spoke\r\ndirectly to the passions and emotions of his hearers.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his argument he stood silent for some moments, until\r\nevery eye was fixed upon him, then, addressing the Chief Justice, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n     This, sir, is my case. It is the case not merely of that humble\r\n     institution, it is the case of every college in our land....\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, you may destroy this little institution; it is weak; it is in\r\n     your hands! I know it is one of the lesser lights in the literary\r\n     horizon of our country. You may put it out. But if you do so you\r\n     must carry through your work! You must extinguish, one after\r\n     another, all those greater lights of science which for more than a\r\n     century have thrown their radiance over our land. It is, sir, as I\r\n     have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.\"\r\n\r\nHere his feelings mastered him; his eyes filled with tears, his lips\r\nquivered, his voice was choked. In broken words of tenderness he spoke of\r\nhis attachment to the college, and his tones seemed filled with the\r\nmemories of home and boyhood; of early affections and youthful privations\r\nand struggles.\r\n\r\n     \"The court room,\" says Mr. Goodrich, to whom we owe this\r\n     description, \"during these two or three minutes presented an\r\n     extraordinary spectacle. Chief Justice Marshall, with his tall and\r\n     gaunt figure bent over as if to catch the slightest whisper, the\r\n     deep furrows of his cheek expanded with emotion and his eyes\r\n     suffused with tears; Mr. Justice Washington, at his side, with his\r\n     small and emaciated frame, and countenance more like marble than I\r\n     ever saw on any other human being,--leaning forward with an eager,\r\n     troubled look; and the remainder of the court at the two\r\n     extremities, pressing, as it were, to a single point, while the\r\n     audience below were wrapping themselves round in closer folds\r\n     beneath the bench, to catch each look and every movement of the\r\n     speaker's face....\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Webster had now recovered his composure, and, fixing his keen\r\n     eye on the Chief Justice, said in that deep tone with which he\r\n     sometimes thrilled the heart of an audience:--\r\n\r\n     \"'Sir, I know not how others may feel' (glancing at the opponents\r\n     of the college before him), 'but for myself, when I see my Alma\r\n     Mater surrounded, like Caesar in the senate-house, by those who are\r\n     reiterating stab after stab, I would not, for this right hand, have\r\n     her turn to me, and say, _Et tu quoque, mi fili! And thou too, my\r\n     son!_'\"\r\n\r\nThis outbreak of feeling was perfectly genuine. Apart from his personal\r\nrelations to the college, he had the true oratorical temperament, and no\r\nman can be an orator in the highest sense unless he feels intensely, for\r\nthe moment at least, the truth and force of every word he utters. To move\r\nothers deeply he must be deeply moved himself. Yet at the same time Mr.\r\nWebster's peroration, and, indeed, his whole speech, was a model of\r\nconsummate art. Great lawyer as he undoubtedly was, he felt on this\r\noccasion that he could not rely on legal argument and pure reason alone.\r\nWithout appearing to go beyond the line of propriety, without indulging in\r\na declamation unsuited to the place, he had to step outside of legal points\r\nand in a freer air, where he could use his keenest and strongest weapons,\r\nappeal to the court not as lawyers but as men subject to passion, emotion,\r\nand prejudice. This he did boldly, delicately, successfully, and thus he\r\nwon his case.\r\n\r\nThe replies of the opposing counsel were poor enough after such a speech.\r\nHolmes's declamation sounded rather cheap, and Mr. Wirt, thrown off his\r\nbalance by Mr. Webster's exposure of his ignorance, did but slight justice\r\nto himself or his cause. March 12th the arguments were closed, and the next\r\nday, after a conference, the Chief Justice announced that the court could\r\nagree on nothing and that the cause must be continued for a year, until the\r\nnext term. The fact probably was that Marshall found the judges five to two\r\nagainst the college, and that the task of bringing them into line was not a\r\nlight one.\r\n\r\nIn this undertaking, however, he was powerfully aided by the counsel and\r\nall the friends of the college. The old board of trustees had already paid\r\nmuch attention to public opinion. The press was largely Federalist, and,\r\nunder the pressure of what was made a party question, they had espoused\r\nwarmly the cause of the college. Letters and essays had appeared, and\r\npamphlets had been circulated, together with the arguments of the counsel\r\nat Exeter. This work was pushed with increased eagerness after the argument\r\nat Washington, and the object now was to create about the three doubtful\r\njudges an atmosphere of public opinion which should imperceptibly bring\r\nthem over to the college. Johnson, Livingston, and Story were all men who\r\nwould have started at the barest suspicion of outside influence even in the\r\nmost legitimate form of argument, which was all that was ever thought of or\r\nattempted. This made the task of the trustees very delicate and difficult\r\nin developing a public sentiment which should sway the judges without their\r\nbeing aware of it. The printed arguments of Mason, Smith, and Webster were\r\ncarefully sent to certain of the judges, but not to all. All documents of a\r\nsimilar character found their way to the same quarters. The leading\r\nFederalists were aroused everywhere, so that the judges might be made to\r\nfeel their opinion. With Story, as a New England man, a Democrat by\r\ncircumstances, a Federalist by nature, there was but little difficulty. A\r\nthorough review of the case, joined with Mr. Webster's argument, caused him\r\nsoon to change his first impression. To reach Livingston and Johnson was\r\nnot so easy, for they were out of New England, and it was necessary to go a\r\nlong way round to get at them. The great legal upholder of Federalism in\r\nNew York was Chancellor Kent. His first impression, like that of Story, was\r\ndecidedly against the college, but after much effort on the part of the\r\ntrustees and their able allies, Kent was converted, partly through his\r\nreason, partly through his Federalism, and then his powers of persuasion\r\nand his great influence on opinion came to bear very directly on\r\nLivingston, more remotely on Johnson. The whole business was managed like a\r\nquiet, decorous political campaign. The press and the party were everywhere\r\nactively interested. At first, and in the early summer of 1818, before Kent\r\nwas converted, matters looked badly for the trustees. Mr. Webster knew the\r\ncomplexion of the court, and hoped little from the point raised in Trustees\r\nvs. Woodward. Still, no one despaired, and the work was kept up until, in\r\nSeptember, President Brown wrote to Mr. Webster in reference to the\r\nargument:--\r\n\r\n     \"It has already been, or shortly will be, read by all the\r\n     _commanding_ men of New England and New York; and so far as it has\r\n     gone it has united them all, without a single exception within my\r\n     knowledge, in one broad and impenetrable phalanx for our defence\r\n     and support. New England and New York _are gained_. Will not this\r\n     be sufficient for our present purposes? If not, I should recommend\r\n     reprinting. And on this point you are the best judge. I\r\n     prevailingly think, however, that the current of opinion from this\r\n     part of the country is setting so strongly towards the South that\r\n     we may safely trust to its force alone to accomplish whatever is\r\n     necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe worthy clergyman writes of public opinion as if the object was to elect\r\na President. All this effort, however, was well applied, as was found when\r\nthe court came together at the next term. In the interval the State had\r\nbecome sensible of the defects of their counsel, and had retained Mr.\r\nPinkney, who stood at that time at the head of the bar of the United\r\nStates. He had all the qualifications of a great lawyer, except perhaps\r\nthat of robustness. He was keen, strong, and learned; diligent in\r\npreparation, he was ready and fluent in action, a good debater, and master\r\nof a high order of eloquence. He was a most formidable adversary, and one\r\nwhom Mr. Webster, then just at the outset of his career, had probably no\r\ndesire to meet in such a doubtful case as this.[1] Even here, however,\r\nmisfortune seemed to pursue the State, for Mr. Pinkney was on bad terms\r\nwith Mr. Wirt, and acted alone. He did all that was possible; prepared\r\nhimself elaborately in the law and history of the case, and then went into\r\ncourt ready to make the wisest possible move by asking for a re-argument.\r\nMarshall, however, was also quite prepared. Turning his \"blind ear,\" as\r\nsome one said, to Pinkney, he announced, as soon as he took his seat, that\r\nthe judges had come to a conclusion during the vacation. He then read one\r\nof his great opinions, in which he held that the college charter was a\r\ncontract within the meaning of the Constitution, and that the acts of the\r\nNew Hampshire Legislature impaired this contract, and were therefore void.\r\nTo this decision four judges assented in silence, although Story and\r\nWashington subsequently wrote out opinions. Judge Todd was absent, through\r\nillness, and Judge Duvall dissented. The immediate effect of the decision\r\nwas to leave the college in the hands of the victorious Federalists. In the\r\nprecedent which it established, however, it had much deeper and more\r\nfar-reaching results. It brought within the scope of the Constitution of\r\nthe United States every charter granted by a State, limited the action of\r\nthe States in a most important attribute of sovereignty, and extended the\r\njurisdiction of the highest federal court more than any other judgment ever\r\nrendered by them. From the day when it was announced to the present time,\r\nthe doctrine of Marshall in the Dartmouth College case has continued to\r\nexert an enormous influence, and has been constantly sustained and attacked\r\nin litigation of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Peter Harvey, in his _Reminiscences_ (p. 122), has an\r\nanecdote in regard to Webster and Pinkney, which places the former in the\r\nlight of a common and odious bully, an attitude as alien to Mr. Webster's\r\ncharacter as can well be conceived. The story is undoubtedly either wholly\r\nfictitious or so grossly exaggerated as to be practically false. On the\r\npage preceding the account of this incident, Mr. Harvey makes Webster say\r\nthat he never received a challenge from Randolph, whereas in Webster's own\r\nletter, published by Mr. Curtis, there is express reference to a note of\r\nchallenge received from Randolph. This is a fair example of these\r\n_Reminiscences_. A more untrustworthy book it would be impossible to\r\nimagine. There is not a statement in it which can be safely accepted,\r\nunless supported by other evidence. It puts its subject throughout in the\r\nmost unpleasant light, and nothing has ever been written about Webster so\r\nwell calculated to injure and belittle him as these feeble and distorted\r\nrecollections of his loving and devoted Boswell. It is the reflection of a\r\ngreat man upon the mirror of a very small mind and weak memory.]\r\n\r\nThe defendant Woodward having died, Mr. Webster moved that the judgment be\r\nentered _nunc pro tunc_. Pinkney and Wirt objected on the ground that the\r\nother causes on the docket contained additional facts, and that no final\r\njudgment should be entered until these causes had been heard. The court,\r\nhowever, granted Mr. Webster's motion. Mr. Pinkney then tried to avail\r\nhimself of the stipulation in regard to the special verdict, that any new\r\nand material facts might be added or any facts expunged. Mr. Webster\r\nperemptorily declined to permit any change, obtained judgment against\r\nWoodward, and obliged Mr. Pinkney to consent that the other causes should\r\nbe remanded, without instructions, to the Circuit Court, where they were\r\nheard by Judge Story, who rendered a decree _nisi_ for the college. This\r\nclosed the case, and such were the last displays of Mr. Webster's dexterous\r\nand vigorous management of the famous \"college causes.\"\r\n\r\nThe popular opinion of this case seems to be that Mr. Webster, with the aid\r\nof Mr. Mason and Judge Smith, developed a great constitutional argument,\r\nwhich he forced upon the acceptance of the court by the power of his close\r\nand logical reasoning, and thus established an interpretation of the\r\nConstitution of vast moment. The truth is, that the suggestion of the\r\nconstitutional point, not a very remarkable idea in itself, originated, as\r\nhas been said, with a layman, was regarded by Mr. Webster as a forlorn\r\nhope, and was very briefly discussed by him before the Supreme Court. He\r\nknew, of course, that if the case were to be decided against Woodward, it\r\ncould only be on the constitutional point, but he evidently thought that\r\nthe court would not take the view of it which was favorable to the college.\r\nThe Dartmouth College case was unquestionably one of Mr. Webster's great\r\nachievements at the bar, but it has been rightly praised on mistaken\r\ngrounds. Mr. Webster made a very fine presentation of the arguments mainly\r\nprepared by Mason and Smith. He transcended the usual legal limits with a\r\nburst of eloquent appeal which stands high among the famous passages of his\r\noratory. In what may be called the strategy of the case he showed the best\r\ngeneralship and the most skilful management. He also proved himself to be\r\npossessed of great tact and to be versed in the knowledge of men, qualities\r\nnot usually attributed to him because their exercise involved an amount of\r\ncare and painstaking foreign to his indolent and royal temperament, which\r\nalmost always relied on weight and force for victory.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster no doubt improved in details, and made better arguments at the\r\nbar than he did upon this occasion, but the Dartmouth College case, on the\r\nwhole, shows his legal talents so nearly at their best, and in such unusual\r\nvariety, that it is a fit point at which to pause in order to consider some\r\nof his other great legal arguments and his position and abilities as a\r\nlawyer. For this purpose it is quite sufficient to confine ourselves to the\r\ncases mentioned by Mr. Curtis, and to the legal arguments preserved in the\r\ncollection of Mr. Webster's speeches.\r\n\r\nFive years after the Dartmouth College decision, Mr. Webster made his\r\nfamous argument in the case of Gibbons vs. Ogden. The case was called\r\nsuddenly, and Mr. Webster prepared his argument in a single night of\r\nintense labor. The facts were all before him, but he showed a readiness in\r\narrangement only equalled by its force. The question was whether the State\r\nof New York had a right under the Constitution to grant a monopoly of steam\r\nnavigation in its waters to Fulton and Livingston. Mr. Webster contended\r\nthat the acts making such a grant were unconstitutional, because the power\r\nof Congress to regulate commerce was, within certain limitations,\r\nexclusive. He won his cause, and the decision, from its importance,\r\nprobably enhanced the contemporary estimate of his effort. The argument was\r\nbadly reported, but it shows all its author's strongest qualities of close\r\nreasoning and effective statement. The point in issue was neither difficult\r\nnor obscure, and afforded no opportunity for a display of learning. It was\r\npurely a matter of constitutional interpretation, and could be discussed\r\nchiefly in a historical manner and from the standpoint of public interests.\r\nThis was particularly fitted to Mr. Webster's cast of mind, and he did his\r\nsubject full justice. It was pure argument on general principles. Mr.\r\nWebster does not reach that point of intense clearness and condensation\r\nwhich characterized Marshall and Hamilton, in whose writings we are\r\nfascinated by the beauty of the intellectual display, and are held fast by\r\neach succeeding line, which always comes charged with fresh meaning.\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Webster touches a very high point in this most difficult\r\nform of argument, and the impressiveness of his manner and voice carried\r\nall that he said to its mark with a direct force in which he stood\r\nunrivalled.\r\n\r\nIn Ogden v. Saunders, heard in 1827, Mr. Webster argued that the clause\r\nprohibiting state laws impairing the obligation of contracts covered future\r\nas well as past contracts. He defended his position with astonishing\r\nability, but the court very correctly decided against him. The same\r\nqualities which appear in these cases are shown in the others of a like\r\nnature, which were conspicuous among the multitude with which he was\r\nintrusted. We find them also in cases involving purely legal questions,\r\nsuch as the Bank of the United States v. Primrose, and The Providence\r\nRailroad Co. v. The City of Boston, accompanied always with that ready\r\ncommand of learning which an extraordinary memory made easy. There seemed\r\nto be no diminution of Mr. Webster's great powers in this field as he\r\nadvanced in years. In the Rhode Island case and in the Passenger Tax cases,\r\nargued when he was sixty-six years old, he rose to the same high plane of\r\nclear, impressive, effective reasoning as when he defended his Alma Mater.\r\n\r\nTwo causes, however, demand more than a passing mention,--the Girard will\r\ncase and the Rhode Island case. The former involved no constitutional\r\npoints. The suit was brought to break the will of Stephen Girard, and the\r\nquestion was whether the bequest to found a college could be construed to\r\nbe a charitable devise. On this question Mr. Webster had a weak case in\r\npoint of law, but he readily detected a method by which he could go boldly\r\noutside the law, as he had done to a certain degree in the Dartmouth\r\nCollege case, and substitute for argument an eloquent and impassioned\r\nappeal to emotion and prejudice. Girard was a free-thinker, and he provided\r\nin his will that no priest or minister of any denomination should be\r\nadmitted to his college. Assuming that this excluded all religious\r\nteaching, Mr. Webster then laid down the proposition that no bequest or\r\ngift could be charitable which excluded Christian teaching. In other words,\r\nhe contended that there was no charity except Christian charity, which, the\r\npoet assures us, is so rare. At this day such a theory would hardly be\r\ngravely propounded by any one. But Mr. Webster, on the ground that Girard's\r\nbequest was derogatory to Christianity, pronounced a very fine discourse\r\ndefending and eulogizing, with much eloquence, the Christian religion. The\r\nspeech produced a great effect. One is inclined to think that it was the\r\ncause of the court's evading the question raised by Mr. Webster, and\r\nsustaining the will, a result they were bound to reach in any event, on\r\nother grounds. The speech certainly produced a great sensation, and was\r\nmuch admired, especially by the clergy, who caused it to be printed and\r\nwidely distributed. It did not impress lawyers quite so favorably, and we\r\nfind Judge Story writing to Chancellor Kent that \"Webster did his best for\r\nthe other side, but it seems to me altogether an address to the prejudices\r\nof the clergy.\" The subject, in certain ways, had a deep attraction for Mr.\r\nWebster. His imagination was excited by the splendid history of the Church,\r\nand his conservatism was deeply stirred by a system which, whether in the\r\nguise of the Romish hierarchy, as the Church of England, or in the form of\r\npowerful dissenting sects, was, as a whole, imposing by its age, its\r\ninfluence, and its moral grandeur. Moreover, it was one of the great\r\nestablished bulwarks of well-ordered and civilized society. All this\r\nappealed strongly to Mr. Webster, and he made the most of his opportunity\r\nand of his shrewdly-chosen ground. Yet the speech on the Girard will is not\r\none of his best efforts. It has not the subdued but intense fire which\r\nglowed so splendidly in his great speeches in the Senate. It lacked the\r\nstately pathos which came always when Mr. Webster was deeply moved. It was\r\ndelivered in 1844, and was slightly tinged with the pompousness which\r\nmanifested itself in his late years, and especially on religious topics. No\r\nman has a right to question the religious sincerity of another, unless upon\r\nevidence so full and clear that, in such cases, it is rarely to be found.\r\nThere is certainly no cause for doubt in Mr. Webster's case. He was both\r\nsincere and honest in religion, and had a real and submissive faith. But he\r\naccepted his religion as one of the great facts and proprieties of life. He\r\ndid not reach his religious convictions after much burning questioning and\r\nmany bitter experiences. In this he did not differ from most men of this\r\nage, and it only amounts to saying that Mr. Webster did not have a deeply\r\nreligious temperament. He did not have the ardent proselyting spirit which\r\nis the surest indication of a profoundly religious nature; the spirit of\r\nthe Saracen Emir crying, \"Forward! Paradise is under the shadow of our\r\nswords.\" When, therefore, he turned his noble powers to a defence of\r\nreligion, he did not speak with that impassioned fervor which, coming from\r\nthe depths of a man's heart, savors of inspiration and seems essential to\r\nthe highest religious eloquence. He believed thoroughly every word he\r\nuttered, but he did not feel it, and in things spiritual the heart must be\r\nenlisted as well as the head. It was wittily said of a well-known\r\nanti-slavery leader, that had he lived in the Middle Ages he would have\r\ngone to the stake for a principle, under a misapprehension as to the facts.\r\nMr. Webster not only could never have misapprehended facts, but, if he had\r\nflourished in the Middle Ages he would have been a stanch and honest\r\nsupporter of the strongest government and of the dominant church. Perhaps\r\nthis defines his religious character as well as anything, and explains why\r\nthe argument in the Girard will case, fine as it was, did not reach the\r\nelevation and force which he so often displayed on other themes.\r\n\r\nThe Rhode Island case grew out of the troubles known at that period as\r\nDorr's rebellion. It involved a discussion not only of the constitutional\r\nprovisions for suppressing insurrections and securing to every State a\r\nrepublican form of government, but also of the general history and theory\r\nof the American governments, both state and national. There was thus\r\noffered to Mr. Webster that full scope and large field in which he\r\ndelighted, and which were always peculiarly favorable to his talents. His\r\nargument was purely constitutional, and although not so closely reasoned,\r\nperhaps, as some of his earlier efforts, is, on the whole, as fine a\r\nspecimen as we have of his intellectual power as a constitutional lawyer at\r\nthe bar of the highest national tribunal. Mr. Webster did not often\r\ntranscend the proper limits of purely legal discussion in the courts, and\r\nyet even when the question was wholly legal, the court-room would be\r\ncrowded by ladies as well as gentlemen, to hear him speak. It was so at the\r\nhearing of the Girard suit; and during the strictly legal arguments in the\r\nCharles River Bridge case, the court-room, Judge Story says, was filled\r\nwith a brilliant audience, including many ladies, and he adds that\r\n\"Webster's closing reply was in his best manner, but with a little too much\r\n_fierté_ here and there.\" The ability to attract such audiences gives an\r\nidea of the impressiveness of his manner and of the beauty of his voice and\r\ndelivery better than anything else, for these qualities alone could have\r\ndrawn the general public and held their attention to the cold and dry\r\ndiscussion of laws and constitutions.\r\n\r\nThere is a little anecdote told by Mr. Curtis in connection with this Rhode\r\nIsland case, which illustrates very well two striking qualities in Mr.\r\nWebster as a lawyer. The counsel in the court below had been assisted by a\r\nclever young lawyer named Bosworth, who had elaborated a point which he\r\nthought very important, but which his seniors rejected. Mr. Bosworth was\r\nsent to Washington to instruct Mr. Webster as to the cause, and, after he\r\nhad gone through the case, Mr. Webster asked if that was all. Mr. Bosworth\r\nmodestly replied that there was another view of his own which his seniors\r\nhad rejected, and then stated it briefly. When he concluded, Mr. Webster\r\nstarted up and exclaimed, \"Mr. Bosworth, by the blood of all the Bosworths\r\nwho fell on Bosworth field, that is _the_ point of the case. Let it be\r\nincluded in the brief by all means.\" This is highly characteristic of one\r\nof Mr. Webster's strongest attributes. He always saw with an unerring\r\nglance \"_the_ point\" of a case or a debate. A great surgeon will detect the\r\nprecise spot where the knife should enter when disease hides it from other\r\neyes, and often with apparent carelessness will make the necessary incision\r\nat the exact place when a deflection of a hair's breadth or a tremor of the\r\nhand would bring death to the patient. Mr. Webster had the same\r\nintellectual dexterity, the mingled result of nature and art. As the tiger\r\nis said to have a sure instinct for the throat of his victim, so Mr.\r\nWebster always seized on the vital point of a question. Other men would\r\ndebate and argue for days, perhaps, and then Mr. Webster would take up the\r\nmatter, and grasp at once the central and essential element which had been\r\nthere all along, pushed hither and thither, but which had escaped all eyes\r\nbut his own. He had preëminently\r\n\r\n                      \"The calm eye that seeks\r\n    'Midst all the huddling silver little worth\r\n    The one thin piece that comes, pure gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe anecdote further illustrates the use which Mr. Webster made of the\r\nideas of other people. He did not say to Mr. Bosworth, here is the true\r\npoint of the case, but he saw that something was wanting, and asked the\r\nyoung lawyer what it was. The moment the proposition was stated he\r\nrecognized its value and importance at a glance. He might and probably\r\nwould have discovered it for himself, but his instinct was to get it from\r\nsome one else.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the familiar attributes of great intellectual power to be able\r\nto select subordinates wisely; to use other people and other people's labor\r\nand thought to the best advantage, and to have as much as possible done for\r\none by others. This power of assimilation Mr. Webster had to a marked\r\ndegree. There is no depreciation in saying that he took much from others,\r\nfor it is a capacity characteristic of the strongest minds, and so long as\r\nthe debt is acknowledged, such a faculty is a subject for praise, not\r\ncriticism. But when the recipient becomes unwilling to admit the obligation\r\nwhich is no detraction to himself, and without which the giver is poor\r\nindeed, the case is altered. In his earliest days Mr. Webster used to draw\r\non one Parker Noyes, a mousing, learned New Hampshire lawyer, and freely\r\nacknowledged the debt. In the Dartmouth College case, as has been seen, he\r\nover and over again gave simply and generously all the credit for the\r\nlearning and the points of the brief to Mason and Smith, and yet the glory\r\nof the case has rested with Mr. Webster and always will. He gained by his\r\nfrank honesty and did not lose a whit. But in his latter days, when his\r\nsense of justice had grown somewhat blunted and his nature was perverted by\r\nthe unmeasured adulation of the little immediate circle which then hung\r\nabout him, he ceased to admit his obligations as in his earlier and better\r\nyears. From no one did Mr. Webster receive so much hearty and generous\r\nadvice and assistance as from Judge Story, whose calm judgment and wealth\r\nof learning were always at his disposal. They were given not only in\r\nquestions of law, but in regard to the Crimes Act, the Judiciary Act, and\r\nthe Ashburton treaty. After Judge Story's death, Mr. Webster not only\r\ndeclined to allow the publication by the judge's son and biographer of\r\nStory's letters to himself, but he refused to permit even the publication\r\nof extracts from his own letters, intended merely to show the nature of the\r\nservices rendered to him by Story. A cordial assent would have enhanced the\r\nreputation of both. The refusal is a blot on the intellectual greatness of\r\nthe one and a source of bitterness to the descendants and admirers of the\r\nother. It is to be regretted that the extraordinary ability which Mr.\r\nWebster always showed in grasping and assimilating masses of theories and\r\nfacts, and in drawing from them what was best, should ever have been\r\nsullied by a want of gratitude which, properly and freely rendered, would\r\nhave made the lustre of his own fame shine still more brightly.\r\n\r\nA close study of Mr. Webster's legal career, in the light of contemporary\r\nreputation and of the best examples of his work, leads to certain quite\r\nobvious conclusions. He had not a strongly original or creative legal mind.\r\nThis was chiefly due to nature, but in some measure to a dislike to the\r\nslow processes of investigation and inquiry which were always distasteful\r\nto him, although he was entirely capable of intense and protracted\r\nexertion. He cannot, therefore, be ranked with the illustrious few, among\r\nwhom we count Mansfield and Marshall as the most brilliant examples, who\r\nnot only declared what the law was, but who made it. Mr. Webster's powers\r\nwere not of this class, but, except in these highest and rarest qualities,\r\nhe stands in the front rank of the lawyers of his country and his age.\r\nWithout extraordinary profundity of thought or depth of learning, he had a\r\nwide, sure, and ready knowledge both of principles and cases. Add to this\r\nquick apprehension, unerring sagacity for vital and essential points, a\r\nperfect sense of proportion, an almost unequalled power of statement,\r\nbacked by reasoning at once close and lucid, and we may fairly say that Mr.\r\nWebster, who possessed all these qualities, need fear comparison with but\r\nvery few among the great lawyers of that period either at home or abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MASSACHUSETTS CONVENTION AND THE PLYMOUTH ORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Dartmouth College case, and its result, at once raised\r\nMr. Webster to a position at the bar second only to that held by Mr.\r\nPinkney. He was now constantly occupied by most important and lucrative\r\nengagements, but in 1820 he was called upon to take a leading part in a\r\ngreat public work which demanded the exertion of all his talents as\r\nstatesman, lawyer, and debater. The lapse of time and the setting off of\r\nthe Maine district as a State had made a convention necessary, in order to\r\nrevise the Constitution of Massachusetts. This involved the direct resort\r\nto the people, the source of all power, which is only required to effect a\r\nchange in the fundamental law of the State. On these rare occasions it has\r\nbeen the honored custom in Massachusetts to lay aside all the\r\nqualifications attaching to ordinary legislatures and to choose the best\r\nmen, without regard to party, public office, or domicile, for the\r\nperformance of this important work. No better or abler body could have been\r\nassembled for this purpose than that which met in convention at Boston in\r\nNovember, 1820. Among these distinguished men were John Adams, then in his\r\neighty-fifth year, and one of the framers of the original Constitution of\r\n1780, Chief Justice Parker, of the Supreme Bench, the Federal judges, and\r\nmany of the leaders at the bar and in business. The two most conspicuous\r\nmen in the convention, however, were Joseph Story and Daniel Webster, who\r\nbore the burden in every discussion; and there were three subjects, upon\r\nwhich Mr. Webster spoke at length, that deserve more than a passing\r\nallusion.\r\n\r\nQuestions of party have, as a rule, found but little place in the\r\nconstitutional assemblies of Massachusetts. This was peculiarly the case in\r\n1820, when the old political divisions were dying out, and new ones had not\r\nyet been formed. At the same time widely opposite views found expression in\r\nthe convention. The movement toward thorough and complete democracy was\r\ngathering headway, and directing its force against many of the old colonial\r\ntraditions and habits of government embodied in the existing Constitution.\r\nThat portion of the delegates which favored certain radical changes was\r\nconfronted and stoutly opposed by those who, on the whole, inclined to make\r\nas few alterations as possible, and desired to keep things about as they\r\nwere. Mr. Webster, as was natural, was the leader of the conservative\r\nparty, and his course in this convention is an excellent illustration of\r\nthis marked trait in his disposition and character.\r\n\r\nOne of the important questions concerned the abolition of the profession of\r\nChristian faith as a qualification for holding office. On this point the\r\nline of argument pursued by Mr. Webster is extremely characteristic.\r\nAlthough an unvarying conservative throughout his life, he was incapable of\r\nbigotry, or of narrow and illiberal views. At the same time the process by\r\nwhich he reached his opinion in favor of removing the religious test shows\r\nmore clearly than even ultra-conservatism could, how free he was from any\r\ntouch of the reforming or innovating spirit. He did not urge that, on\r\ngeneral principles, religious tests were wrong, that they were relics of\r\nthe past and in hopeless conflict with the fundamental doctrines of\r\nAmerican liberty and democracy. On the contrary, he implied that a\r\nreligious test was far from being of necessity an evil. He laid down the\r\nsound doctrine that qualifications for office were purely matters of\r\nexpediency, and then argued that it was wise to remove the religious test\r\nbecause, while its principle would be practically enforced by a Christian\r\ncommunity, it was offensive to some persons to have it engrafted on the\r\nConstitution. The speech in which he set forth these views was an able and\r\nconvincing one, entirely worthy of its author, and the removal of the test\r\nwas carried by a large majority. It is an interesting example of the\r\ncombination of steady conservatism and breadth of view which Mr. Webster\r\nalways displayed. But it also brings into strong relief his aversion to\r\nradical general principles as grounds of action, and his inborn hostility\r\nto far-reaching change.\r\n\r\nHis two other important speeches in this convention have been preserved in\r\nhis works, and are purely and wholly conservative in tone and spirit. The\r\nfirst related to the basis of representation in the Senate, whose members\r\nwere then apportioned according to the amount of taxable property in the\r\ndistricts. This system, Mr. Webster thought, should be retained, and his\r\nspeech was a most masterly discussion of the whole system of government by\r\ntwo Houses. He urged the necessity of a basis of representation for the\r\nupper House different from that of the lower, in order to make the former\r\nfully serve its purpose of a check and balance to the popular branch. This\r\nimportant point he handled in the most skilful manner, and there is no\r\nescape from his conclusion that a difference of origin in the two\r\nlegislative branches of the government is essential to the full and perfect\r\noperation of the system. This difference of origin, he argued, could be\r\nobtained only by the introduction of property as a factor in the basis of\r\nrepresentation. The weight of his speech was directed to defending the\r\nprinciple of a suitable representation of property, which was a subject\r\nrequiring very adroit treatment. The doctrine is one which probably would\r\nnot be tolerated now in any part of this country, and even in 1820, in\r\nMassachusetts, it was a delicate matter to advocate it, for it was hostile\r\nto the general sentiment of the people. Having established his position\r\nthat it was all important to make the upper branch a strong and effective\r\ncheck, he said that the point in issue was not whether property offered the\r\nbest method of distinguishing between the two Houses, but whether it was\r\nnot better than no distinction at all. This being answered affirmatively,\r\nthe next question to be considered was whether property, not in the sense\r\nof personal possessions and personal power, but in a general sense, ought\r\nnot to have its due influence in matters of government. He maintained the\r\njustice of this proposition by showing that our constitutions rest largely\r\non the general equality of property, which, in turn, is due to our laws of\r\ndistribution. This led him into a discussion of the principles of the\r\ndistribution of property. He pointed out the dangers arising in England\r\nfrom the growth of a few large estates, while on the other hand he\r\npredicted that the rapid and minute subdivision of property in France would\r\nchange the character of the government, and, far from strengthening the\r\ncrown, as was then generally prophesied, would have a directly opposite\r\neffect, by creating a large and united body of small proprietors, who would\r\nsooner or later control the country. He illustrated, in this way, the value\r\nand importance of a general equality of property, and of steadiness in\r\nlegislation affecting it. These were the reasons, he contended, for making\r\nproperty the basis of the check and balance furnished to our system of\r\ngovernment by an upper House. Moreover, all property being subject to\r\ntaxation for the purpose of educating the children of both rich and poor,\r\nit deserved some representation for this valuable aid to government. It is\r\nimpossible, in a few lines,[1] to do justice to Mr. Webster's argument. It\r\nexhibited a great deal of tact and ingenuity, especially in the distinction\r\nso finely drawn between property as an element of personal power and\r\nproperty in a general sense, and so distributed as to be a bulwark of\r\nliberty. The speech is, on this account, an interesting one, for Mr.\r\nWebster was rarely ingenious, and hardly ever got over difficulties by\r\nfine-spun distinctions. In this instance adroitness was very necessary, and\r\nhe did not hesitate to employ it. By his skilful treatment, by his\r\nillustrations drawn from England and France, which show the accuracy and\r\nrange of his mental vision in matters of politics and public economy, both\r\nat home and abroad, and with the powerful support of Judge Story, Mr.\r\nWebster carried his point. The element of property representation in the\r\nSenate was retained, but so wholly by the ability of its advocate, that it\r\nwas not long afterwards removed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: My brief statement is merely a further condensation of the\r\nexcellent abstract of this speech made by Mr Curtis.]\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's other important speech related to the judiciary. The\r\nConstitution provided that the judges, who held office during good\r\nbehavior, should be removable by the Governor on an address from the\r\nLegislature. This was considered to meet cases of incompetency or of\r\npersonal misconduct, which could not be reached by impeachment. Mr. Webster\r\ndesired to amend the clause so as to require a two thirds vote for the\r\npassage of the address, and that reasons should be assigned, and a hearing\r\nassured to the judge who was the subject of the proceedings. These changes\r\nwere all directed to the further protection of the bench, and it was in\r\nthis connection that Mr. Webster made a most admirable and effective speech\r\non the well-worn but noble theme of judicial independence. He failed to\r\ncarry conviction, however, and his amendments were all lost. The perils\r\nwhich he anticipated have never arisen, and the good sense of the people of\r\nMassachusetts has prevented the slightest abuse of what Mr. Webster rightly\r\nesteemed a dangerous power.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's continual and active exertion throughout the session of this\r\nconvention brought him great applause and admiration, and showed his powers\r\nin a new light. Judge Story, with generous enthusiasm, wrote to Mr. Mason,\r\nafter the convention adjourned:--\r\n\r\n     \"Our friend Webster has gained a noble reputation. He was before\r\n     known as a lawyer; but he has now secured the title of an eminent\r\n     and enlightened statesman. It was a glorious field for him, and he\r\n     has had an ample harvest. The whole force of his great mind was\r\n     brought out, and, in several speeches, he commanded universal\r\n     admiration. He always led the van, and was most skilful and\r\n     instantaneous in attack and retreat. He fought, as I have told him,\r\n     in the 'imminent deadly breach;' and all I could do was to\r\n     skirmish, in aid of him, upon some of the enemy's outposts. On the\r\n     whole, I never was more proud of any display than his in my life,\r\n     and I am much deceived if the well-earned popularity, so justly and\r\n     so boldly acquired by him on this occasion, does not carry him, if\r\n     he lives, to the presidency.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this convention, so memorable in the career of Mr. Webster and so\r\nfilled with the most absorbing labors, was in session, he achieved a still\r\nwider renown in a very different field. On the 22d of December, 1820, he\r\ndelivered at Plymouth the oration which commemorated the two hundredth\r\nanniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims. The theme was a splendid one,\r\nboth in the intrinsic interest of the event itself, in the character of the\r\nPilgrims, in the vast results which had grown from their humble beginnings,\r\nand in the principles of free government, which had spread from the cabins\r\nof the exiles over the face of a continent, and had become the common\r\nheritage of a great people. We are fortunate in having a description of the\r\norator, written at the time by a careful observer and devoted friend, Mr.\r\nTicknor, who says:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Friday Evening._--I have run away from a great levee there is\r\n     down-stairs, thronging in admiration round Mr. Webster, to tell you\r\n     a little word about his oration. Yet I do not dare to trust myself\r\n     about it, and I warn you beforehand that I have not the least\r\n     confidence in my own opinion. His manner carried me away\r\n     completely; not, I think, that I could have been so carried away if\r\n     it had been a poor oration, for of that, I apprehend, there can be\r\n     no fear. It _must_ have been a great, a very great performance, but\r\n     whether it was so absolutely unrivalled as I imagined when I was\r\n     under the immediate influence of his presence, of his tones, of his\r\n     looks, I cannot be sure till I have read it, for it seems to me\r\n     incredible.\r\n\r\n     \"I was never so excited by public speaking before in my life. Three\r\n     or four times I thought my temples would burst with the gush of\r\n     blood; for, after all, you must know that I am aware it is no\r\n     connected and compacted whole, but a collection of wonderful\r\n     fragments of burning eloquence, to which his whole manner gave\r\n     tenfold force. When I came out I was almost afraid to come near to\r\n     him. It seemed to me as if he was like the mount that might not be\r\n     touched and that burned with fire. I was beside myself, and am so\r\n     still.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Saturday._--Mr. Webster was in admirable spirits. On Thursday\r\n     evening he was considerably agitated and oppressed, and yesterday\r\n     morning he had not his natural look at all; but since his entire\r\n     success he has been as gay and playful as a kitten. The party came\r\n     in one after another, and the spirits of all were kindled brighter\r\n     and brighter, and we fairly sat up till after two o'clock. I think,\r\n     therefore, we may now safely boast the Plymouth expedition has gone\r\n     off admirably.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ticknor was a man of learning and scholarship, just returned from a\r\nprolonged sojourn in Europe, where he had met and conversed with all the\r\nmost distinguished men of the day, both in England and on the Continent. He\r\nwas not, therefore, disposed by training or recent habits to indulge a\r\nfacile enthusiasm, and such deep emotion as he experienced must have been\r\ndue to no ordinary cause. He was, in fact, profoundly moved because he had\r\nbeen listening to one of the great masters of eloquence exhibiting, for the\r\nfirst time, his full powers in a branch of the art much more cultivated in\r\nAmerica by distinguished men of all professions than is the custom\r\nelsewhere. The Plymouth oration belongs to what, for lack of a better name,\r\nwe must call occasional oratory. This form of address, taking an\r\nanniversary, a great historical event or character, a celebration, or\r\noccasion of any sort as a starting point, permits either a close adherence\r\nto the original text or the widest latitude of treatment. The field is a\r\nbroad and inviting one. That it promises an easy success is shown by the\r\ninnumerable productions of this kind which, for many years, have been\r\nshowered upon the country. That the promise is fallacious is proved by the\r\nvery small number among the countless host of such addresses which survive\r\nthe moment of their utterance. The facility of saying something is\r\ncounterbalanced by the difficulty of saying anything worth hearing. The\r\ntemptation to stray and to mistake platitude for originality is almost\r\nalways fatal.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was better fitted than any man who has ever lived in this\r\ncountry for the perilous task of occasional oratory. The freedom of\r\nmovement which renders most speeches of this class diluted and commonplace\r\nwas exactly what he needed. He required abundant intellectual room for a\r\nproper display of his powers, and he had the rare quality of being able to\r\nrange over vast spaces of time and thought without becoming attenuated in\r\nwhat he said. Soaring easily, with a powerful sweep he returned again to\r\nearth without jar or shock. He had dignity and grandeur of thought,\r\nexpression, and manner, and a great subject never became small by his\r\ntreatment of it. He had, too, a fine historical imagination, and could\r\nbreathe life and passion into the dead events of the past.\r\n\r\nMr. Ticknor speaks of the Plymouth oration as impressing him as a series of\r\neloquent fragments. The impression was perfectly correct. Mr. Webster\r\ntouched on the historical event, on the character of the Pilgrims, on the\r\ngrowth and future of the country, on liberty and constitutional principles,\r\non education, and on human slavery. This was entirely proper to such an\r\naddress. The difficulty lay in doing it well, and Mr. Webster did it as\r\nperfectly as it ever has been done. The thoughts were fine, and were\r\nexpressed in simple and beautiful words. The delivery was grand and\r\nimpressive, and the presentation of each successive theme glowed with\r\nsubdued fire. There was no straining after mere rhetorical effect, but an\r\nartistic treatment of a succession of great subjects in a general and yet\r\nvivid and picturesque fashion. The emotion produced by the Plymouth oration\r\nwas akin to that of listening to the strains of music issuing from a\r\nfull-toned organ. Those who heard it did not seek to gratify their reason\r\nor look for conviction to be brought to their understanding. It did not\r\nappeal to the logical faculties or to the passions, which are roused by the\r\nkeen contests of parliamentary debate. It was the divine gift of speech,\r\nthe greatest instrument given to man, used with surpassing talent, and the\r\njoy and pleasure which it brought were those which come from listening to\r\nthe song of a great singer, or looking upon the picture of a great artist.\r\n\r\nThe Plymouth oration, which was at once printed and published, was received\r\nwith a universal burst of applause. It had more literary success than\r\nanything which had at that time appeared, except from the pen of Washington\r\nIrving. The public, without stopping to analyze their own feelings, or the\r\noration itself, recognized at once that a new genius had come before them,\r\na man endowed with the noble gift of eloquence, and capable by the exercise\r\nof his talents of moving and inspiring great masses of his fellow-men. Mr.\r\nWebster was then of an age to feel fully the glow of a great success, both\r\nat the moment and when the cooler and more critical approbation came. He\r\nwas fresh and young, a strong man rejoicing to run the race. Mr. Ticknor\r\nsays, in speaking of the oration:--\r\n\r\n     \"The passage at the end, where, spreading his arms as if to embrace\r\n     them, he welcomed future generations to the great inheritance which\r\n     we have enjoyed, was spoken with the most attractive sweetness and\r\n     that peculiar smile which in him was always so charming. The effect\r\n     of the whole was very great. As soon as he got home to our\r\n     lodgings, all the principal people then in Plymouth crowded about\r\n     him. He was full of animation, and radiant with happiness. But\r\n     there was something about him very grand and imposing at the same\r\n     time. I never saw him at any time when he seemed to me to be more\r\n     conscious of his own powers, or to have a more true and natural\r\n     enjoyment from their possession.\"\r\n\r\nAmid all the applause and glory, there was one letter of congratulation and\r\nacknowledgment which must have given Mr. Webster more pleasure than\r\nanything else, It came from John Adams, who never did anything by halves.\r\nWhether he praised or condemned, he did it heartily and ardently, and such\r\nan oration on New England went straight to the heart of the eager,\r\nwarm-blooded old patriot. His commendation, too, was worth having, for he\r\nspoke as one having authority. John Adams had been one of the eloquent men\r\nand the most forcible debater of the first Congress. He had listened to the\r\ngreat orators of other lands. He had heard Pitt and Fox, Burke and\r\nSheridan, and had been present at the trial of Warren Hastings. His\r\nunstinted praise meant and still means a great deal, and it concludes with\r\none of the finest and most graceful of compliments. The oration, he says,\r\n\r\n     \"is the effort of a great mind, richly stored with every species of\r\n     information. If there be an American who can read it without tears,\r\n     I am not that American. It enters more perfectly into the genuine\r\n     spirit of New England than any production I ever read. The\r\n     observations on the Greeks and Romans; on colonization in general;\r\n     on the West India islands; on the past, present, and future of\r\n     America, and on the slave-trade, are sagacious, profound, and\r\n     affecting in a high degree.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Burke is no longer entitled to the praise--the most consummate\r\n     orator of modern times.\"\r\n\r\n     \"What can I say of what regards myself? To my humble name,\r\n     _Exegisti monumentum aere perennius_.\"\r\n\r\nMany persons consider the Plymouth oration to be the finest of all Mr.\r\nWebster's efforts in this field. It is certainly one of the very best of\r\nhis productions, but he showed on the next great occasion a distinct\r\nimprovement, which he long maintained. Five years after the oration at\r\nPlymouth, he delivered the address on the laying of the corner-stone of\r\nBunker Hill monument. The superiority to the first oration was not in\r\nessentials, but in details, the fruit of a ripening and expanding mind. At\r\nBunker Hill, as at Plymouth, he displayed the massiveness of thought, the\r\ndignity and grandeur of expression, and the range of vision which are all\r\nso characteristic of his intellect and which were so much enhanced by his\r\nwonderful physical attributes. But in the later oration there is a greater\r\nfinish and smoothness. We appreciate the fact that the Plymouth oration is\r\na succession of eloquent fragments; the same is true of the Bunker Hill\r\naddress, but we no longer realize it. The continuity is, in appearance,\r\nunbroken, and the whole work is rounded and polished. The style, too, is\r\nnow perfected. It is at once plain, direct, massive, and vivid. The\r\nsentences are generally short and always clear, but never monotonous. The\r\npreference for Anglo-Saxon words and the exclusion of Latin derivatives are\r\nextremely marked, and we find here in rare perfection that highest\r\nattribute of style, the union of simplicity, picturesqueness, and force.\r\n\r\nIn the first Bunker Hill oration Mr. Webster touched his highest point in\r\nthe difficult task of commemorative oratory. In that field he not only\r\nstands unrivalled, but no one has approached him. The innumerable\r\nproductions of this class by other men, many of a high degree of\r\nexcellence, are forgotten, while those of Webster form part of the\r\neducation of every American school-boy, are widely read, and have entered\r\ninto the literature and thought of the country. The orations of Plymouth\r\nand Bunker Hill are grouped in Webster's works with a number of other\r\nspeeches professedly of the same kind. But only a very few of these are\r\nstrictly occasional; the great majority are chiefly, if not wholly,\r\npolitical speeches, containing merely passages here and there in the same\r\nvein as his great commemorative addresses. Before finally leaving the\r\nsubject, however, it will be well to glance for a moment at the few\r\norations which properly belong to the same class as the first two which we\r\nhave been considering.\r\n\r\nThe Bunker Hill oration, after the lapse of only a year, was followed by\r\nthe celebrated eulogy upon Adams and Jefferson. This usually and with\r\njustice is ranked in merit with its two immediate predecessors. As a whole\r\nit is not, perhaps, quite so much admired, but it contains the famous\r\nimaginary speech of John Adams, which is the best known and most hackneyed\r\npassage in any of these orations. The opening lines, \"Sink or swim, live or\r\ndie, survive or perish, I give my hand and my heart to this vote,\" since\r\nMr. Webster first pronounced them in Faneuil Hall, have risen even to the\r\ndignity of a familiar quotation. The passage, indeed, is perhaps the best\r\nexample we have of the power of Mr. Webster's historical imagination. He\r\nhad some fragmentary sentences, the character of the man, the nature of the\r\ndebate, and the circumstances of the time to build upon, and from these\r\nmaterials he constructed a speech which was absolutely startling in its\r\nlifelike force. The revolutionary Congress, on the verge of the tremendous\r\nstep which was to separate them from England, rises before us as we read\r\nthe burning words which the imagination of the speaker put into the mouth\r\nof John Adams. They are not only instinct with life, but with the life of\r\nimpending revolution, and they glow with the warmth and strength of feeling\r\nso characteristic of their supposed author. It is well known that the\r\ngeneral belief at the time was that the passage was an extract from a\r\nspeech actually delivered by John Adams. Mr. Webster, as well as Mr.\r\nAdams's son and grandson, received numerous letters of inquiry on this\r\npoint, and it is possible that many people still persist in this belief as\r\nto the origin of the passage. Such an effect was not produced by mere\r\nclever imitation, for there was nothing to imitate, but by the force of a\r\npowerful historic imagination and a strong artistic sense in its\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 Mr. Webster delivered an address before the Mechanics' Institute in\r\nBoston, on \"Science in connection with the Mechanic Arts,\" a subject which\r\nwas outside of his usual lines of thought, and offered no especial\r\nattractions to him. This oration is graceful and strong, and possesses\r\nsufficient and appropriate eloquence. It is chiefly interesting, however,\r\nfrom the reserve and self-control, dictated by a nice sense of fitness,\r\nwhich it exhibited. Omniscience was not Mr. Webster's foible. He never was\r\nguilty of Lord Brougham's weakness of seeking to prove himself master of\r\nuniversal knowledge. In delivering an address on science and invention,\r\nthere was a strong temptation to an orator like Mr. Webster to substitute\r\nglittering rhetoric for real knowledge; but the address at the Mechanics'\r\nInstitute is simply the speech of a very eloquent and a liberally educated\r\nman upon a subject with which he had only the most general acquaintance.\r\nThe other orations of this class were those on \"The Character of\r\nWashington,\" the second Bunker Hill address, \"The Landing at Plymouth,\"\r\ndelivered in New York at the dinner of the Pilgrim Society, the remarks on\r\nthe death of Judge Story and of Mr. Mason, and finally the speech on laying\r\nthe corner-stone for the addition to the Capitol, in 1851. These were all\r\ncomparatively brief speeches, with the exception of that at Bunker Hill,\r\nwhich, although very fine, was perceptibly inferior to his first effort\r\nwhen the corner-stone of the monument was laid. The address on the\r\ncharacter of Washington, to an American the most dangerous of great and\r\nwell-worn topics, is of a high order of eloquence. The theme appealed to\r\nMr. Webster strongly and brought out his best powers, which were peculiarly\r\nfitted to do justice to the noble, massive, and dignified character of the\r\nsubject. The last of these addresses, that on the addition to the Capitol,\r\nwas in a prophetic vein, and, while it shows but little diminution of\r\nstrength, has a sadness even in its splendid anticipations of the future,\r\nwhich makes it one of the most impressive of its class. All those which\r\nhave been mentioned, however, show the hand of the master and are worthy to\r\nbe preserved in the volumes which contain the noble series that began in\r\nthe early flush of genius with the brilliant oration in the Plymouth\r\nchurch, and closed with the words uttered at Washington, under the shadow\r\nof the Capitol, when the light of life was fading and the end of all things\r\nwas at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nRETURN TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thorough knowledge of the principles of government and legislation, the\r\npractical statesmanship, and the capacity for debate shown in the State\r\nconvention, combined with the splendid oration at Plymouth to make Mr.\r\nWebster the most conspicuous man in New England, with the single exception\r\nof John Quincy Adams. There was, therefore, a strong and general desire\r\nthat he should return to public life. He accepted with some reluctance the\r\nnomination to Congress from the Boston district in 1822, and in December,\r\n1823, took his seat.\r\n\r\nThe six years which had elapsed since Mr. Webster left Washington had been\r\na period of political quiet. The old parties had ceased to represent any\r\ndistinctive principles, and the Federalists scarcely existed as an\r\norganization. Mr. Webster, during this interval, had remained almost wholly\r\nquiescent in regard to public affairs. He had urged the visit of Mr. Monroe\r\nto the North, which had done so much to hasten the inevitable dissolution\r\nof parties. He had received Mr. Calhoun when that gentleman visited\r\nBoston, and their friendship and apparent intimacy were such that the South\r\nCarolinian was thought to be his host's candidate for the presidency.\r\nExcept for this and the part which he took in the Boston opposition to the\r\nMissouri compromise and to the tariff, matters to be noticed in connection\r\nwith later events, Mr. Webster had held aloof from political conflict.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Washington in 1823, the situation was much altered from\r\nthat which he had left in 1817. In reality there were no parties, or only\r\none; but the all-powerful Republicans who had adopted, under the pressure\r\nof foreign war, most of the Federalist principles so obnoxious to Jefferson\r\nand his school, were split up into as many factions as there were\r\ncandidates for the presidency. It was a period of transition in which\r\npersonal politics had taken the place of those founded on opposing\r\nprinciples, and this \"era of good feeling\" was marked by the intense\r\nbitterness of the conflicts produced by these personal rivalries. In\r\naddition to the factions which were battling for the control of the\r\nRepublican party and for the great prize of the presidency, there was still\r\nanother faction, composed of the old Federalists, who, although without\r\norganization, still held to their name and their prejudices, and clung\r\ntogether more as a matter of habit than with any practical object. Mr.\r\nWebster had been one of the Federalist leaders in the old days, and when\r\nhe returned to public life with all the distinction which he had won in\r\nother fields, he was at once recognized as the chief and head of all that\r\nnow remained of the great party of Washington and Hamilton. No Federalist\r\ncould hope to be President, and for this very reason Federalist support was\r\neagerly sought by all Republican candidates for the presidency. The favor\r\nof Mr. Webster as the head of an independent and necessarily disinterested\r\nfaction was, of course, strongly desired in many quarters. His political\r\nposition and his high reputation as a lawyer, orator, and statesman made\r\nhim, therefore, a character of the first importance in Washington, a fact\r\nto which Mr. Clay at once gave public recognition by placing his future\r\nrival at the head of the Judiciary Committee of the House.\r\n\r\nThe six years of congressional life which now ensued were among the most\r\nuseful if not the most brilliant in Mr. Webster's whole public career. He\r\nwas free from the annoyance of opposition at home, and was twice returned\r\nby a practically unanimous popular vote. He held a commanding and\r\ninfluential and at the same time a thoroughly independent position in\r\nWashington, where he was regarded as the first man on the floor of the\r\nHouse in point of ability and reputation. He was not only able to show his\r\ngreat capacity for practical legislation, but he was at liberty to advance\r\nhis own views on public questions in his own way, unburdened by the outside\r\ninfluences of party and of association which had affected him so much in\r\nhis previous term of service and were soon to reassert their sway in all\r\nhis subsequent career.\r\n\r\nHis return to Congress was at once signalized by a great speech, which,\r\nalthough of no practical or immediate moment, deserves careful attention\r\nfrom the light which it throws on the workings of his mind and the\r\ndevelopment of his opinions in regard to his country. The House had been in\r\nsession but a few days when Mr. Webster offered a resolution in favor of\r\nproviding by law for the expenses incident to the appointment of a\r\ncommissioner to Greece, should the President deem such an appointment\r\nexpedient. The Greeks were then in the throes of revolution, and the\r\nsympathy for the heirs of so much glory in their struggle for freedom was\r\nstrong among the American people. When Mr. Webster rose on January 19,\r\n1824, to move the adoption of the resolution which he had laid upon the\r\ntable of the House, the chamber was crowded and the galleries were filled\r\nby a large and fashionable audience attracted by the reputation of the\r\norator and the interest felt in his subject. His hearers were disappointed\r\nif they expected a great rhetorical display, for which the nature of the\r\nsubject and the classic memories clustering about it offered such strong\r\ntemptations. Mr. Webster did not rise for that purpose, nor to make\r\ncapital by an appeal to a temporary popular interest. His speech was for a\r\nwholly different purpose. It was the first expression of that grand\r\nconception of the American Union which had vaguely excited his youthful\r\nenthusiasm. This conception had now come to be part of his intellectual\r\nbeing, and then and always stirred his imagination and his affections to\r\ntheir inmost depths. It embodied the principle from which he never swerved,\r\nand led to all that he represents and to all that his influence means in\r\nour history.\r\n\r\nAs the first expression of his conception of the destiny of the United\r\nStates as a great and united nation, Mr. Webster was, naturally, \"more fond\r\nof this child\" than of any other of his intellectual family. The speech\r\nitself was a noble one, but it was an eloquent essay rather than a great\r\nexample of the oratory of debate. This description can in no other case be\r\napplied to Mr. Webster's parliamentary efforts, but in this instance it is\r\ncorrect, because the occasion justified such a form. Mr. Webster's purpose\r\nwas to show that, though the true policy of the United States absolutely\r\ndebarred them from taking any part in the affairs of Europe, yet they had\r\nan important duty to perform in exercising their proper influence on the\r\npublic opinion of the world. Europe was then struggling with the monstrous\r\nprinciples of the \"Holy Alliance.\" Those principles Mr. Webster reviewed\r\nhistorically. He showed their pernicious tendency, their hostility to all\r\nmodern theories of government, and their especial opposition to the\r\nprinciples of American liberty. If the doctrines of the Congress of Laybach\r\nwere right and could be made to prevail, then those of America were wrong\r\nand the systems of popular government adopted in the United States were\r\ndoomed. Against such infamous principles it behooved the people of the\r\nUnited States to raise their voice. Mr. Webster sketched the history of\r\nGreece, and made a fine appeal to Americans to give an expression of their\r\nsympathy to a people struggling for freedom. He proclaimed, so that all men\r\nmight hear, the true duty of the United States toward the oppressed of any\r\nland, and the responsibility which they held to exert their influence upon\r\nthe opinions of mankind. The national destiny of his country in regard to\r\nother nations was his theme; to give to the glittering declaration of\r\nCanning, that he would \"call in the new world to redress the balance of the\r\nold,\" a deep and real significance was his object.\r\n\r\nThe speech touched Mr. Clay to the quick. He supported Mr. Webster's\r\nresolution with all the ardor of his generous nature, and supplemented it\r\nby another against the interference of Spain in South America. A stormy\r\ndebate followed, vivified by the flings and taunts of John Randolph, but\r\nthe unwillingness to take action was so great that Mr. Webster did not\r\npress his resolution to a vote. He had at the outset looked for a practical\r\nresult from his resolution, and had desired the appointment of Mr. Everett\r\nas commissioner, a plan in which he had been encouraged by Mr. Calhoun, who\r\nhad given him to understand that the Executive regarded the Greek mission\r\nwith favor. Before he delivered his speech he became aware that Calhoun had\r\nmisled him, that Mr. Adams, the Secretary of State, considered Everett too\r\nmuch of a partisan, and that the administration was wholly averse to any\r\naction in the premises. This destroyed all hope of a practical result, and\r\nmade an adverse vote certain. The only course was to avoid a decision and\r\ntrust to what he said for an effect on public opinion. The real purpose of\r\nthe speech, however, was achieved. Mr. Webster had exposed and denounced\r\nthe Holy Alliance as hostile to the liberties of mankind, and had declared\r\nthe unalterable enmity of the United States to its reactionary doctrines.\r\nThe speech was widely read, not only wherever English was spoken, but it\r\nwas translated into all the languages of Europe, and was circulated\r\nthroughout South America. It increased Mr. Webster's fame at home and laid\r\nthe foundation of his reputation abroad. Above all, it stamped him as a\r\nstatesman of a broad and national cast of mind.\r\n\r\nHe now settled down to hard and continuous labor at the routine business\r\nof the House, and it was not until the end of March that he had occasion to\r\nmake another elaborate and important speech. At that time Mr. Clay took up\r\nthe bill for laying certain protective duties and advocated it strenuously\r\nas part of a general and steady policy which he then christened with the\r\nname of \"the American system.\" Against this bill, known as the tariff of\r\n1824, Mr. Webster made, as Mr. Adams wrote in his diary at the time, \"an\r\nable and powerful speech,\" which can be more properly considered when we\r\ncome to his change of position on this question a few years later.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the affairs of the national courts\r\nwere his particular care. Western expansion demanded an increased number of\r\njudges for the circuits, but, unfortunately, decisions in certain recent\r\ncases had offended the sensibilities of Virginia and Kentucky, and there\r\nwas a renewal of the old Jeffersonian efforts to limit the authority of the\r\nSupreme Court. Instead of being able to improve, he was obliged to defend\r\nthe court, and this he did successfully, defeating all attempts to curtail\r\nits power by alterations of the act of 1789. These duties and that of\r\ninvestigating the charges brought by Ninian Edwards against Mr. Crawford,\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, made the session an unusually laborious one,\r\nand detained Mr. Webster in Washington until midsummer.\r\n\r\nThe short session of the next winter was of course marked by the\r\nexcitement attendant upon the settlement of the presidential election which\r\nresulted in the choice of Mr. John Quincy Adams by the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The intense agitation in political circles did not,\r\nhowever, prevent Mr. Webster from delivering one very important speech, nor\r\nfrom carrying through successfully one of the most important and\r\npractically useful measures of his legislative career. The speech was\r\ndelivered in the debate on the bill for continuing the national Cumberland\r\nroad. Mr. Webster had already, many years before, defined his position on\r\nthe constitutional question involved in internal improvements. He now, in\r\nresponse to Mr. McDuffie of South Carolina, who denounced the measure as\r\npartial and sectional, not merely defended the principle of internal\r\nimprovements, but declared that it was a policy to be pursued only with the\r\npurest national feeling. It was not the business of Congress, he said, to\r\nlegislate for this State or that, or to balance local interests, and\r\nbecause they helped one region to help another, but to act for the benefit\r\nof all the States united, and in making improvements to be guided only by\r\ntheir necessity. He showed that these roads would open up the West to\r\nsettlement, and incidentally defended the policy of selling the public\r\nlands at a low price as an encouragement to emigration, telling his\r\nSouthern friends very plainly that they could not expect to coerce the\r\ncourse of population in favor of their own section. The whole speech was\r\nconceived in the broadest and wisest spirit, and marks another step in the\r\ndevelopment of Mr. Webster as a national statesman. It increased his\r\nreputation, and brought to him a great accession of popularity in the West.\r\n\r\nThe measure which he carried through was the famous \"Crimes Act,\" perhaps\r\nthe best monument that there is of his legislative and constructive\r\nability. The criminal law of the United States had scarcely been touched\r\nsince the days of the first Congress, and was very defective and\r\nunsatisfactory. Mr. Webster's first task, in which he received most\r\nessential and valuable though unacknowledged assistance from Judge Story,\r\nwas to codify and digest the whole body of criminal law. This done, the\r\nhardly less difficult undertaking followed of carrying the measure through\r\nCongress. In the latter, Mr. Webster, by his skill in debate and\r\nfamiliarity with his subject, and by his influence in the House, was\r\nperfectly successful. That he and Judge Story did their work well in\r\nperfecting the bill is shown by the admirable manner in which the Act stood\r\nthe test of time and experience.\r\n\r\nWhen the new Congress came together in 1825, Mr. Webster at once turned his\r\nattention to the improvement of the Judiciary, which he had been obliged to\r\npostpone in order to ward off the attacks upon the court. After much\r\ndeliberation and thought, aided by Judge Story, and having made some\r\nconcessions to his committee, he brought in a bill increasing the Supreme\r\nCourt judges to ten, making ten instead of seven circuits, and providing\r\nthat six judges should constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.\r\nAlthough not a party question, the measure excited much opposition, and was\r\nmore than a month in passing through the House. Mr. Webster supported it at\r\nevery stage with great ability, and his two most important speeches, which\r\nare in their way models for the treatment of such a subject, are preserved\r\nin his works. The bill was carried by his great strength in debate and by\r\nheight of forcible argument. But in the Senate, where it was deprived of\r\nthe guardianship of its author, it hung along in uncertainty, and was\r\nfinally lost through the apathy or opposition of those very Western members\r\nfor whose benefit it had been devised. Mr. Webster took its ultimate defeat\r\nvery coolly. The Eastern States did not require it, and were perfectly\r\ncontented with the existing arrangements, and he was entirely satisfied\r\nwith the assurance that the best lawyers and wisest men approved the\r\nprinciples of the bill. The time and thought which he had expended were not\r\nwasted so far as he was personally concerned, for they served to enhance\r\nhis influence and reputation both as a lawyer and statesman.\r\n\r\nThis session brought with it also occasions for debate other than those\r\nwhich were offered by measures of purely legislative and practical\r\ninterest. The administration of Mr. Adams marks the close of the \"era of\r\ngood feeling,\" as it was called, and sowed the germs of those divisions\r\nwhich were soon to result in new and definite party combinations. Mr. Adams\r\nand Mr. Clay represented the conservative and General Jackson and his\r\nfriends the radical or democratic elements in the now all-embracing\r\nRepublican party. It was inevitable that Mr. Webster should sympathize with\r\nthe former, and it was equally inevitable that in doing so he should become\r\nthe leader of the administration forces in the House, where \"his great and\r\ncommanding influence,\" to quote the words of an opponent, made him a host\r\nhimself. The desire of Mr. Adams to send representatives to the Panama\r\nCongress, a scheme which lay very near his heart and to which Mr. Clay was\r\nequally attached, encountered a bitter and factious resistance in the\r\nSenate, sufficient to deprive the measure of any real utility by delaying\r\nits passage. In the House a resolution was introduced declaring simply that\r\nit was expedient to appropriate money to defray the expenses of the\r\nproposed mission. The opposition at once undertook by amendments to\r\ninstruct the ministers, and generally to go beyond the powers of the House.\r\nThe real ground of the attack was slavery, threatened, as was supposed, by\r\nthe attitude of the South American republics--a fact which no one\r\nunderstood or cared to recognize. Mr. Webster stood forth as the champion\r\nof the Executive. In an elaborate speech of great ability he denounced the\r\nunconstitutional attempt to interfere with the prerogative of the\r\nPresident, and discussed with much effect the treaty-making power assailed\r\non another famous occasion, many years before, by the South, and defended\r\nat that time also by the eloquence of a representative of Massachusetts.\r\nMr. Webster showed the nature of the Panama Congress, defended its objects\r\nand the policy of the administration, and made a full and fine exposition\r\nof the intent of the \"Monroe doctrine.\" The speech was an important and\r\neffective one. It exhibited in an exceptional way Mr. Webster's capacity\r\nfor discussing large questions of public and constitutional law and foreign\r\npolicy, and was of essential service to the cause which he espoused. It was\r\nimbued, too, with that sentiment of national unity which occupied a larger\r\nspace in his thoughts with each succeeding year, until it finally pervaded\r\nhis whole career as a public man.\r\n\r\nAt the second session of the same Congress, after a vain effort to confer\r\nupon the country the benefit of a national bankrupt law, Mr. Webster was\r\nagain called upon to defend the Executive in a much more heated conflict\r\nthan that aroused by the Panama resolution. Georgia was engaged in\r\noppressing and robbing the Creek Indians, in open contempt of the treaties\r\nand obligations of the United States. Mr. Adams sent in a message reciting\r\nthe facts and hinting pretty plainly that he intended to carry out the laws\r\nby force unless Georgia desisted. The message was received with great wrath\r\nby the Southern members. They objected to any reference to a committee, and\r\nMr. Forsyth of Georgia declared the whole business to be \"base and\r\ninfamous,\" while a gentleman from Mississippi announced that Georgia would\r\nact as she pleased. Mr. Webster, having said that she would do so at her\r\nperil, was savagely attacked as the organ of the administration, daring to\r\nmenace and insult a sovereign State. This stirred Mr. Webster, although\r\nslow to anger, to a determination to carry through the reference at all\r\nhazards. He said:--\r\n\r\n     \"He would tell the gentleman from Georgia that if there were rights\r\n     of the Indians which the United States were bound to protect, that\r\n     there were those in the House and in the country who would take\r\n     their part. If we have bound ourselves by any treaty to do certain\r\n     things, we must fulfil such obligation. High words will not terrify\r\n     us, loud declamation will not deter us from the discharge of that\r\n     duty. In my own course in this matter I shall not be dictated to by\r\n     any State or the representative of any State on this floor. I shall\r\n     not be frightened from my purpose nor will I suffer harsh language\r\n     to produce any reaction on my mind. I will examine with great and\r\n     equal care all the rights of both parties.... I have made these few\r\n     remarks to give the gentleman from Georgia to understand that it\r\n     was not by bold denunciation nor by bold assumption that the\r\n     members of this House are to be influenced in the decision of high\r\n     public concerns.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Webster was thoroughly roused and indignant there was a darkness\r\nin his face and a gleam of dusky light in his deep-set eyes which were not\r\naltogether pleasant to contemplate. How well Mr. Forsyth and his friends\r\nbore the words and look of Mr. Webster we have no means of knowing, but the\r\nmessage was referred to a select committee without a division. The interest\r\nto us in all this is the spirit in which Mr. Webster spoke. He loved the\r\nUnion as intensely then as at any period of his life, but he was still far\r\ndistant from the frame of mind which induced him to think that his devotion\r\nto the Union would be best expressed and the cause of the Union best served\r\nby mildness toward the South and rebuke to the North. He believed in 1826\r\nthat dignified courage and firm language were the surest means of keeping\r\nthe peace. He was quite right then, and he would have been always right if\r\nhe had adhered to the plain words and determined manner to which he treated\r\nMr. Forsyth and his friends.\r\n\r\nThis session was crowded with work of varying importance, but the close of\r\nMr. Webster's career in the lower House was near at hand. The failing\r\nhealth of Mr. E.H. Mills made it certain that Massachusetts would soon have\r\na vacant seat in the Senate, and every one turned to Mr. Webster as the\r\nperson above all others entitled to this high office. He himself was by no\r\nmeans so quick in determining to accept the position. He would not even\r\nthink of it until the impossibility of Mr. Mills's return was assured, and\r\nthen he had to meet the opposition of the administration and all its\r\nfriends, who regarded with alarm the prospect of losing such a tower of\r\nstrength in the House. Mr. Webster, indeed, felt that he could render the\r\nbest service in the lower branch, and urged the senatorship upon Governor\r\nLincoln, who was elected, but declined. After this there seemed to be no\r\nescape from a manifest destiny. Despite the opposition of his friends in\r\nWashington, and his own reluctance, he finally accepted the office of\r\nUnited States senator, which was conferred upon him by the Legislature of\r\nMassachusetts in June, 1827.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the labors of Mr. Webster during three years spent in the lower\r\nHouse, no allusion has been made to the purely political side of his career\r\nat this time, nor to his relations with the public men of the day. The\r\nperiod was important, generally speaking, because it showed the first signs\r\nof the development of new parties, and to Mr. Webster in particular,\r\nbecause it brought him gradually toward the political and party position\r\nwhich he was to occupy during the rest of his life. When he took his seat\r\nin Congress, in the autumn of 1823, the intrigues for the presidential\r\nsuccession were at their height. Mr. Webster was then strongly inclined to\r\nMr. Calhoun, as was suspected at the time of that gentleman's visit to\r\nBoston. He soon became convinced, however, that Mr. Calhoun's chances of\r\nsuccess were slight, and his good opinion of the distinguished South\r\nCarolinian seems also to have declined. It was out of the question for a\r\nman of Mr. Webster's temperament and habits of thought, to think for a\r\nmoment of supporting Jackson, a candidate on the ground of military glory\r\nand unreflecting popular enthusiasm. Mr. Adams, as the representative of\r\nNew England, and as a conservative and trained statesman, was the natural\r\nand proper candidate to receive the aid of Mr. Webster. But here party\r\nfeelings and traditions stepped in. The Federalists of New England had\r\nhated Mr. Adams with the peculiar bitterness which always grows out of\r\ndomestic quarrels, whether in public or private life; and although the old\r\nstrife had sunk a little out of sight, it had never been healed. The\r\nFederalist leaders in Massachusetts still disliked and distrusted Mr. Adams\r\nwith an intensity none the less real because it was concealed. In the\r\nnature of things Mr. Webster now occupied a position of political\r\nindependence; but he had been a steady party man when his party was in\r\nexistence, and he was still a party man so far as the old Federalist\r\nfeelings retained vitality and force. He had, moreover, but a slight\r\npersonal acquaintance with Mr. Adams and no very cordial feeling toward\r\nhim. This disposed of three presidential candidates. The fourth was Mr.\r\nClay, and it is not very clear why Mr. Webster refused an alliance in this\r\nquarter. Mr. Clay had treated him with consideration, they were personal\r\nfriends, their opinions were not dissimilar and were becoming constantly\r\nmore alike. Possibly there was an instinctive feeling of rivalry on this\r\nvery account. At all events, Mr. Webster would not support Clay. Only one\r\ncandidate remained: Mr. Crawford, the representative of all that was\r\nextreme among the Republicans, and, in a party sense, most odious to the\r\nFederalists. But it was a time when personal factions flourished rankly in\r\nthe absence of broad differences of principle. Mr. Crawford was bidding\r\nfuriously for support in every and any quarter, and to Mr. Crawford,\r\naccordingly, Mr. Webster began to look as a possible leader for himself and\r\nhis friends. Just how far Mr. Webster went in this direction cannot be\r\nreadily or surely determined, although we get some light on the subject\r\nfrom an attack made on Mr. Crawford just at this time. Ninian Edwards,\r\nrecently senator from Illinois, had a quarrel with Mr. Crawford, and sent\r\nin a memorial to Congress containing charges against the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury which were designed to break him down as a candidate for the\r\npresidency. Of the merits of this quarrel it is not very easy to judge,\r\neven if it were important. The character of Edwards was none of the best,\r\nand Mr. Crawford had unquestionably made a highly unscrupulous use,\r\npolitically, of his position. The members of the administration, although\r\nwith no great love for Edwards, who had been appointed Minister to Mexico,\r\nwere distinctly hostile to Mr. Crawford, and refused to attend a dinner\r\nfrom which Edwards had been expressly excluded. Mr. Webster's part in the\r\naffair came from his being on the committee charged with the investigation\r\nof the Edwards memorial. Mr. Adams, who was of course excited by the\r\npresidential contest, disposed to regard his rivals with extreme disfavor,\r\nand especially and justly suspicious of Mr. Crawford, speaks of Mr.\r\nWebster's conduct in the matter with the utmost bitterness. He refers to it\r\nagain and again as an attempt to screen Crawford and break down Edwards,\r\nand denounces Mr. Webster as false, insidious, and treacherous. Much of\r\nthis may be credited to the heated animosities of the moment, but there can\r\nbe no doubt that Mr. Webster took the matter into his own hands in the\r\ncommittee, and made every effort to protect Mr. Crawford, in whose favor he\r\nalso spoke in the House. It is likewise certain that there was an attempt\r\nto bring about an alliance between Crawford and the Federalists of the\r\nNorth and East. The effort was abortive, and even before the conclusion of\r\nthe Edwards business Mr. Webster avowed that he should take but little part\r\nin the election, and that his only purpose was to secure the best terms\r\npossible for the Federalists, and obtain recognition for them from the next\r\nadministration. At that time he wished Mr. Mason to be attorney-general,\r\nand had already turned his thoughts toward the English mission for himself.\r\n\r\nTo this waiting policy he adhered, but when the popular election was over,\r\nand the final decision had been thrown into the House of Representatives,\r\nmore definite action became necessary. From the questions which he put to\r\nhis brother and others as to the course which he ought to pursue in the\r\nelection by the House, it is obvious that he was far from anxious to secure\r\nthe choice of Mr. Adams, and was weighing carefully other contingencies.\r\nThe feeling of New England could not, however, be mistaken. Public opinion\r\nthere demanded that the members of the House should stand by the New\r\nEngland candidate to the last. To this sentiment Mr. Webster submitted, and\r\nsoon afterwards took occasion to have an interview with Mr. Adams in order\r\nto make the best terms possible for the Federalists, and obtain for them\r\nsuitable recognition. Mr. Adams assured Mr. Webster that he did not intend\r\nto proscribe any section or any party, and added that although he could not\r\ngive the Federalists representation in the cabinet, he should give them one\r\nof the important appointments. Mr. Webster was entirely satisfied with this\r\npromise and with all that was said by Mr. Adams, who, as everybody knows,\r\nwas soon after elected by the House on the first ballot.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams on his side saw plainly the necessity of conciliating Mr.\r\nWebster, whose great ability and influence he thoroughly understood. He\r\ntold Mr. Clay that he had a high opinion of Mr. Webster, and wished to win\r\nhis support; and the savage tone displayed in regard to the Edwards affair\r\nnow disappears from the Diary. Mr. Adams, however, although he knew, as he\r\nsays, that \"Webster was panting for the English mission,\" and hinted that\r\nthe wish might be gratified hereafter, was not ready to go so far at the\r\nmoment, and at the same time he sought to dissuade Mr. Webster from being a\r\ncandidate for the speakership, for which in truth the latter had no\r\ninclination. Their relations, indeed, soon grew very pleasant. Mr. Webster\r\nnaturally became the leader of the administration forces in the House,\r\nwhile the President on his side sought Mr. Webster's advice, admired his\r\noration on Adams and Jefferson, dined at his house, and lived on terms of\r\nfriendship and confidence with him. It is to be feared, however, that all\r\nthis was merely on the surface. Mr. Adams at the bottom of his heart never,\r\nin reality, relaxed in his belief that Mr. Webster was morally unsound. Mr.\r\nWebster, on the other hand, whose Federalist opposition to Mr. Adams had\r\nonly been temporarily allayed, was not long in coming to the conclusion\r\nthat his services, if appreciated, were not properly recognized by the\r\nadministration. There was a good deal of justice in this view. The English\r\nmission never came, no help was to be obtained for Mr. Mason's election as\r\nsenator from New Hampshire, the speakership was to be refused in order to\r\npromote harmony and strength in the House. To all this Mr. Webster\r\nsubmitted, and fought the battles of the administration in debate as no one\r\nelse could have done. Nevertheless, all men like recognition, and Mr.\r\nWebster would have preferred something more solid than words and confidence\r\nor the triumph of a common cause. When the Massachusetts senatorship was in\r\nquestion Mr. Adams urged the election of Governor Lincoln, and objected on\r\nthe most flattering grounds to Mr. Webster's withdrawal from the House. It\r\nis not a too violent conjecture to suppose that Mr. Webster's final\r\nacceptance of a seat in the Senate was due in large measure to a feeling\r\nthat he had sacrificed enough for the administration. There can be no doubt\r\nthat coolness grew between the President and the Senator, and that the\r\nappointment to England, if still desired, never was made, so that when the\r\nnext election came on Mr. Webster was inactive, and, despite his hostility\r\nto Jackson, viewed the overthrow of Mr. Adams with a good deal of\r\nindifference and some satisfaction. It is none the less true, however, that\r\nduring these years when the first foundations of the future Whig party were\r\nlaid, Mr. Webster formed the political affiliations which were to last\r\nthrough life. He inevitably found himself associated with Clay and Adams,\r\nand opposed to Jackson, Benton, and Van Buren, while at the same time he\r\nand Calhoun were fast drifting apart. He had no specially cordial feeling\r\nto his new associates; but they were at the head of the conservative\r\nelements of the country, they were nationalists in policy, and they favored\r\nthe views which were most affected in New England. As a conservative and\r\nnationalist by nature and education, and as the great New England leader,\r\nMr. Webster could not avoid becoming the parliamentary chief of Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration, and thus paved the way for leadership in the Whig party of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIn narrating the history of these years, I have confined myself to Mr.\r\nWebster's public services and political course. But it was a period in his\r\ncareer which was crowded with work and achievement, bringing fresh fame and\r\nincreased reputation, and also with domestic events both of joy and sorrow.\r\nMr. Webster steadily pursued the practice of the law, and was constantly\r\nengaged in the Supreme Court. To these years belong many of his great\r\narguments, and also the prosecution of the Spanish claims, a task at once\r\nlaborious and profitable. In the summer of 1824 Mr. Webster first saw\r\nMarshfield, his future home, and in the autumn of the same year he visited\r\nMonticello, where he had a long interview with Mr. Jefferson, of whom he\r\nhas left a most interesting description. During the winter he formed the\r\nacquaintance and lived much in the society of some well-known Englishmen\r\nthen travelling in this country. This party consisted of the Earl of Derby,\r\nthen Mr. Stanley, Lord Wharncliffe, then Mr. Stuart Wortley; Lord Taunton,\r\nthen Mr. Labouchere, and Mr. Denison, afterwards Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons. With Mr. Denison this acquaintance was the foundation of a lasting\r\nand intimate friendship maintained by correspondence. In June, 1825, came\r\nthe splendid oration at Bunker Hill, and then a visit to Niagara, which, of\r\ncourse, appealed strongly to Mr. Webster. His account of it, however,\r\nalthough indicative of a deep mental impression, shows that his power of\r\ndescribing nature fell far short of his wonderful talent for picturing\r\nhuman passions and action. The next vacation brought the eulogy on Adams\r\nand Jefferson, when perhaps Mr. Webster may be considered to have been in\r\nhis highest physical and intellectual perfection. Such at least was the\r\nopinion of Mr. Ticknor, who says:--\r\n\r\n     \"He was in the perfection of manly beauty and strength; his form\r\n     filled out to its finest proportions, and his bearing, as he stood\r\n     before the vast multitude, that of absolute dignity and power. His\r\n     manner of speaking was deliberate and commanding. I never heard him\r\n     when his manner was so grand and appropriate; ... when he ended the\r\n     minds of men were wrought up to an uncontrollable excitement, and\r\n     then followed three tremendous cheers, inappropriate indeed, but as\r\n     inevitable as any other great movement of nature.\"\r\n\r\nHe had held the vast audience mute for over two hours, as John Quincy Adams\r\nsaid in his diary, and finally their excited feelings found vent in cheers.\r\nHe spoke greatly because he felt greatly. His emotions, his imagination,\r\nhis entire oratorical temperament were then full of quick sensibility. When\r\nhe finished writing the imaginary speech of John Adams in the quiet of his\r\nlibrary and the silence of the morning hour, his eyes were wet with tears.\r\n\r\nA year passed by after this splendid display of eloquence, and then the\r\nsecond congressional period, which had been so full of work and\r\nintellectual activity and well-earned distinction, closed, and he entered\r\nupon that broader field which opened to him in the Senate of the United\r\nStates, where his greatest triumphs were still to be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE TARIFF OF 1828 AND THE REPLY TO HAYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new dignity conferred on Mr. Webster by the people of Massachusetts had\r\nhardly been assumed when he was called upon to encounter a trial which must\r\nhave made all his honors seem poor indeed. He had scarcely taken his seat\r\nwhen he was obliged to return to New York, where failing health had\r\narrested Mrs. Webster's journey to the capital, and where, after much\r\nsuffering, she died, January 21, 1828. The blow fell with terrible severity\r\nupon her husband. He had many sorrows to bear during his life, but this\r\nsurpassed all others. His wife was the love of his youth, the mother of his\r\nchildren, a lovely woman whose strong but gentle influence for good was now\r\nlost to him irreparably. In his last days his thoughts reverted to her, and\r\nas he followed her body to the grave, on foot in the wet and cold, and\r\nleading his children by the hand, it must indeed have seemed as if the wine\r\nof life had been drunk and only the lees remained. He was excessively pale,\r\nand to those who looked upon him seemed crushed and heart-broken.\r\n\r\nThe only relief was to return to his work and to the excitement of public\r\naffairs; but the cloud hung over him long after he was once more in his\r\nplace in the Senate. Death had made a wound in his life which time healed\r\nbut of which the scar remained. Whatever were Mr. Webster's faults, his\r\naffection for those nearest to him, and especially for the wife of his\r\nyouth, was deep and strong.\r\n\r\n     \"The very first day of Mr. Webster's arrival and taking his seat in\r\n     the Senate,\" Judge Story writes to Mr. Ticknor, \"there was a\r\n     process bill on its third reading, filled, as he thought, with\r\n     inconvenient and mischievous provisions. He made, in a modest\r\n     undertone, some inquiries, and, upon an answer being given, he\r\n     expressed in a few words his doubts and fears. Immediately Mr.\r\n     Tazewell from Virginia broke out upon him in a speech of two hours.\r\n     Mr. Webster then moved an adjournment, and on the next day\r\n     delivered a most masterly speech in reply, expounding the whole\r\n     operation of the intended act in the clearest manner, so that a\r\n     recommitment was carried almost without an effort. It was a triumph\r\n     of the most gratifying nature, and taught his opponents the danger\r\n     of provoking a trial of his strength, even when he was overwhelmed\r\n     by calamity. In the labors of the court he has found it difficult\r\n     to work himself up to high efforts; but occasionally he comes out\r\n     with all his powers, and when he does, it is sure to attract a\r\n     brilliant audience.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to give a better picture than that presented by\r\nJudge Story of Mr. Webster's appearance and conduct in the month\r\nimmediately following the death of his wife. We can see how his talents,\r\nexcited by the conflicts of the Senate and the court, struggled, sometimes\r\nsuccessfully, sometimes in vain, with the sense of loss and sorrow which\r\noppressed him.\r\n\r\nHe did not again come prominently forward in the Senate until the end of\r\nApril, when he roused himself to prevent injustice. The bill for the relief\r\nof the surviving officers of the Revolution seemed on the point of being\r\nlost. The object of the measure appealed to Mr. Webster's love for the\r\npast, to his imagination, and his patriotism. He entered into the debate,\r\ndelivered the fine and dignified speech which is preserved in his works,\r\nand saved the bill.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after this he made his famous speech on the tariff of 1828, a\r\nbill making extensive changes in the rates of duties imposed in 1816 and\r\n1824. This speech marks an important change in Mr. Webster's views and in\r\nhis course as a statesman. He now gave up his position as the ablest\r\nopponent in the country of the protective policy, and went over to the\r\nsupport of the tariff and the \"American system\" of Mr. Clay. This change,\r\nin every way of great importance, subjected Mr. Webster to severe criticism\r\nboth then and subsequently. It is, therefore, necessary to examine briefly\r\nhis previous utterances on this question in order to reach a correct\r\nunderstanding of his motives in taking this important step and to\r\nappreciate his reasons for the adoption of a policy with which, after the\r\nyear 1828, he was so closely identified.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Webster first entered Congress he was a thorough-going Federalist.\r\nBut the Federalists of New England differed from their great chief,\r\nAlexander Hamilton, on the question of a protective policy. Hamilton, in\r\nhis report on manufactures, advocated with consummate ability the adoption\r\nof the principle of protection for nascent industries as an integral and\r\nessential part of a true national policy, and urged it on its own merits,\r\nwithout any reference to its being incident to revenue. The New England\r\nFederalists, on the other hand, coming from exclusively commercial\r\ncommunities, were in principle free-traders. They regarded with disfavor\r\nthe doctrine that protection was a good thing in itself, and desired it, if\r\nat all, only in the most limited form and purely as an incident to raising\r\nrevenue. With these opinions Mr. Webster was in full sympathy, and he took\r\noccasion when Mr. Calhoun, in 1814, spoke in favor of the existing double\r\nduties as a protective measure, and also in favor of manufactures, during\r\nthe debate on the repeal of the embargo, to define his position on this\r\nimportant question. A few brief extracts will show his views, which were\r\nexpressed very clearly and with his wonted ability and force.\r\n\r\n     \"I consider,\" he said, \"the imposition of double duties as a mere\r\n     financial measure. Its great object was to raise revenue, not to\r\n     foster manufactures.... I do not say the double duties ought to be\r\n     continued. I think they ought not. But what I particularly object\r\n     to is the holding out of delusive expectations to those concerned\r\n     in manufactures.... In respect to manufactures it is necessary to\r\n     speak with some precision. I am not, generally speaking, their\r\n     enemy. I am their friend; but I am not for rearing them or any\r\n     other interest in hot-beds. I would not legislate precipitately,\r\n     even in favor of them; above all, I would not profess intentions in\r\n     relation to them which I did not purpose to execute. I feel no\r\n     desire to push capital into extensive manufactures faster than the\r\n     general progress of our wealth and population propels it.\r\n\r\n     \"I am not in haste to see Sheffields and Birminghams in America.\r\n     Until the population of the country shall be greater in proportion\r\n     to its extent, such establishments would be impracticable if\r\n     attempted, and if practicable they would be unwise.\"\r\n\r\nHe then pointed out the inferiority and the perils of manufactures as an\r\noccupation in comparison with agriculture, and concluded as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am not anxious to accelerate the approach of the period when the\r\n     great mass of American labor shall not find its employment in the\r\n     field; when the young men of the country shall be obliged to shut\r\n     their eyes upon external nature, upon the heavens and the earth,\r\n     and immerse themselves in close and unwholesome workshops; when\r\n     they shall be obliged to shut their ears to the bleatings of their\r\n     own flocks upon their own hills, and to the voice of the lark that\r\n     cheers them at the plough, that they may open them in dust and\r\n     smoke and steam to the perpetual whirl of spools and spindles, and\r\n     the grating of rasps and saws. I have made these remarks, sir, not\r\n     because I perceive any immediate danger of carrying our\r\n     manufactures to an extensive height, but for the purpose of\r\n     guarding and limiting my opinions, and of checking, perhaps, a\r\n     little the high-wrought hopes of some who seem to look to our\r\n     present infant establishments for 'more than their nature or their\r\n     state can bear.'\r\n\r\n     \"_It is the true policy of government to suffer the different\r\n     pursuits of society to take their own course, and not to give\r\n     excessive bounties or encouragements to one over another. This,\r\n     also, is the true spirit of the Constitution. It has not, in my\r\n     opinion, conferred on the government the power of changing the\r\n     occupations of the people of different States and sections, and of\r\n     forcing them into other employments._ It cannot prohibit commerce\r\n     any more than agriculture, nor manufactures any more than commerce.\r\n     It owes protection to all.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentences in italics constitute a pretty strong and explicit statement\r\nof the _laissez faire_ doctrine, and it will be observed that the tone of\r\nall the extracts is favorable to free trade and hostile to protection and\r\neven to manufactures in a marked degree. We see, also, that Mr. Webster,\r\nwith his usual penetration and justice of perception, saw very clearly that\r\nuniformity and steadiness of policy were more essential than even the\r\npolicy itself, and in his opinion were most likely to be attained by\r\nrefraining from protection as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen the tariff of 1816 was under discussion Mr. Webster made no elaborate\r\nspeech against it, probably feeling that it was hopeless to attempt to\r\ndefeat the measure as a whole, but he devoted himself with almost complete\r\nsuccess to the task of reducing the proposed duties and to securing\r\nmodifications of various portions of the bill.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, when the tariff recommended at the previous session was about to\r\ncome before Congress, Mr. Webster was not in public life. He attended,\r\nhowever, a meeting of merchants and agriculturists, held in Faneuil Hall in\r\nthe summer of that year, to protest against the proposed tariff, and he\r\nspoke strongly in favor of the free trade resolutions which were then\r\nadopted. He began by saying that he was a friend to manufactures, but not\r\nto the tariff, which he considered as most injurious to the country.\r\n\r\n     \"He certainly thought it might be doubted whether Congress would\r\n     not be acting somewhat against the spirit and intention of the\r\n     Constitution in exercising a power to control essentially the\r\n     pursuits and occupations of individuals in their private\r\n     concerns--a power to force great and sudden changes both of\r\n     occupation and property upon individuals, _not as incidental to the\r\n     exercise of any other power, but as a substantial and direct\r\n     power_.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that he objects to the constitutionality of protection\r\nas a \"direct power,\" and in the speech of 1814, in the portion quoted in\r\nitalics, he declared against any general power still more forcibly and\r\nbroadly. It is an impossible piece of subtlety and refining, therefore, to\r\nargue that Mr. Webster always held consistently to his views as to the\r\nlimitations of the revenue power as a source of protection, and that he put\r\nprotection in 1828, and subsequently sustained it after his change of\r\nposition, on new and general constitutional grounds. In the speeches of\r\n1814 and 1820 he declared expressly against the doctrine of a general power\r\nof protection, saying, in the latter instance:--\r\n\r\n     \"It would hardly be contended that Congress possessed that sort of\r\n     general power by which it might declare that particular occupations\r\n     should be pursued in society and that others should not. _If such\r\n     power belonged to any government in this country, it certainly did\r\n     not belong to the general government._\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster took the New England position that there was no general power,\r\nand having so declared in this speech of 1820, he then went on to show that\r\nprotection could only come as incidental to revenue, and that, even in this\r\nway, it became unconstitutional when the incident was turned into the\r\nprinciple and when protection and not revenue was the object of the duties.\r\nAfter arguing this point, he proceeded to discuss the general expediency\r\nof protection, holding it up as a thoroughly mistaken policy, a failure in\r\nEngland which that country would gladly be rid of, and defending commerce\r\nas the truest and best support of the government and of general prosperity.\r\nHe took up next the immediate effects of the proposed tariff, and,\r\npremising that it would confessedly cause a diminution of the revenue,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n     \"In truth, every man in the community not immediately benefited by\r\n     the new duties would suffer a double loss. In the first place, by\r\n     shutting out the former commodity, the price of the domestic\r\n     manufacture would be raised. The consumer, therefore, must pay more\r\n     for it, and insomuch as government will have lost the duty on the\r\n     imported article, a tax equal to that duty must be paid to the\r\n     government. The real amount, then, of this bounty on a given\r\n     article will be precisely the amount of the present duty added to\r\n     the amount of the proposed duty.\"\r\n\r\nHe then went on to show the injustice which would be done to all\r\nmanufacturers of unprotected articles, and ridiculed the idea of the\r\nconnection between home industries artificially developed and national\r\nindependence. He concluded by assailing manufacturing as an occupation,\r\nattacking it as a means of making the rich richer and the poor poorer; of\r\ninjuring business by concentrating capital in the hands of a few who\r\nobtained control of the corporations; of distributing capital less widely\r\nthan commerce; of breeding up a dangerous and undesirable population; and\r\nof leading to the hurtful employment of women and children. The meeting,\r\nthe resolutions, and the speech were all in the interests of commerce and\r\nfree trade, and Mr. Webster's doctrines were on the most approved pattern\r\nof New England Federalism, which, professing a mild friendship for\r\nmanufactures and unwillingly conceding the minimum of protection solely as\r\nan incident to revenue, was, at bottom, thoroughly hostile to both. In 1820\r\nMr. Webster stood forth, both politically and constitutionally, as a\r\nfree-trader, moderate but at the same time decided in his opinions.\r\n\r\nWhen the tariff of 1824 was brought before Congress and advocated with\r\ngreat zeal by Mr. Clay, who upheld it as the \"American system,\" Mr. Webster\r\nopposed the policy in the fullest and most elaborate speech he had yet made\r\non the subject. A distinguished American economist, Mr. Edward Atkinson,\r\nhas described this speech of 1824 briefly and exactly in the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     \"It contains a refutation of the exploded theory of the balance of\r\n     trade, of the fallacy with regard to the exportation of specie, and\r\n     of the claim that the policy of protection is distinctively the\r\n     American policy which can never be improved upon, and it indicates\r\n     how thoroughly his judgment approved and his better nature\r\n     sympathized with the movement towards enlightened and liberal\r\n     commercial legislation, then already commenced in Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was in truth one of great ability, showing a remarkable\r\ncapacity for questions of political economy, and opening with an admirable\r\ndiscussion of the currency and of finance, in regard to which Mr. Webster\r\nalways held and advanced the soundest, most scientific, and most\r\nenlightened views. Now, as in 1820, he stood forth as the especial champion\r\nof commerce, which, as he said, had thriven without protection, had brought\r\nrevenue to the government and wealth to the country, and would be\r\ngrievously injured by the proposed tariff. He made his principal objection\r\nto the protection policy on the ground of favoritism to some interests at\r\nthe expense of others when all were entitled to equal consideration. Of\r\nEngland he said, \"Because a thing has been wrongly done, it does not follow\r\nthat it can be undone; and this is the reason, as I understand it, for\r\nwhich exclusion, prohibition, and monopoly are suffered to remain in any\r\ndegree in the English system.\" After examining at length the different\r\nvarieties of protection, and displaying very thoroughly the state of\r\ncurrent English opinion, he defined the position which he, in common with\r\nthe Federalists of New England, then as always adhered to in the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     \"Protection, when carried to the point which is now recommended,\r\n     that is, to entire prohibition, seems to me destructive of all\r\n     commercial intercourse between nations. We are urged to adopt the\r\n     system on general principles; ... I do not admit the general\r\n     principle; on the contrary, I think freedom of trade the general\r\n     principle, and restriction the exception.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that the proposed protective policy involved a decline of\r\ncommerce, and that steadiness and uniformity, the most essential requisites\r\nin any policy, were endangered. He then with great power dealt with the\r\nvarious points summarized by Mr. Atkinson, and concluded with a detailed\r\nand learned examination of the various clauses of the bill, which finally\r\npassed by a small majority and became law.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 came another tariff bill, so bad and so extreme in many respects\r\nthat it was called the \"bill of abominations.\" It originated in the\r\nagitation of the woollen manufacturers which had started the year before,\r\nand for this bill Mr. Webster spoke and voted. He changed his ground on\r\nthis important question absolutely and entirely, and made no pretence of\r\ndoing anything else. The speech which he made on this occasion is a\r\ncelebrated one, but it is so solely on account of the startling change of\r\nposition which it announced. Mr. Webster has been attacked and defended for\r\nhis action at this time with great zeal, and all the constitutional and\r\neconomic arguments for and against protection are continually brought\r\nforward in this connection. From the tone of the discussion, it is to be\r\nfeared that many of those who are interested in the question have not\r\ntaken the trouble to read what he said. The speech of 1828 is by no means\r\nequal in any way to its predecessors in the same field. It is brief and\r\nsimple to the last degree. It has not a shred of constitutional argument,\r\nnor does it enter at all into a discussion of general principles. It makes\r\nbut one point, and treats that point with great force as the only one to be\r\nmade under the circumstances, and thereby presents the single and\r\nsufficient reason for its author's vote. A few lines from the speech give\r\nthe marrow of the whole matter. Mr. Webster said:--\r\n\r\n     \"New England, sir, has not been a leader in this policy. On the\r\n     contrary, she held back herself and tried to hold others back from\r\n     it, from the adoption of the Constitution to 1824. Up to 1824 she\r\n     was accused of sinister and selfish designs, _because she\r\n     discountenanced the progress of this policy_.... Under this angry\r\n     denunciation against her the act of 1824 passed. Now the imputation\r\n     is of a precisely opposite character.... Both charges, sir, are\r\n     equally without the slightest foundation. The opinion of New\r\n     England up to 1824 was founded in the conviction that, on the\r\n     whole, it was wisest and best, both for herself and others, that\r\n     manufactures should make haste slowly.... When, at the commencement\r\n     of the late war, duties were doubled, we were told that we should\r\n     find a mitigation of the weight of taxation in the new aid and\r\n     succor which would be thus afforded to our own manufacturing labor.\r\n     Like arguments were urged, and prevailed, but not by the aid of New\r\n     England votes, when the tariff was afterwards arranged at the\r\n     close of the war in 1816. Finally, after a winter's deliberation,\r\n     the act of 1824 received the sanction of both Houses of Congress\r\n     and settled the policy of the country. What, then, was New England\r\n     to do?... Was she to hold out forever against the course of the\r\n     government, and see herself losing on one side and yet make no\r\n     effort to sustain herself on the other? No, sir. Nothing was left\r\n     to New England but to conform herself to the will of others.\r\n     Nothing was left to her but to consider that the government had\r\n     fixed and determined its own policy; and that policy was\r\n     _protection_.... I believe, sir, almost every man from New England\r\n     who voted against the law of 1824 declared that if, notwithstanding\r\n     his opposition to that law, it should still pass, there would be no\r\n     alternative but to consider the course and policy of the government\r\n     as then settled and fixed, and to act accordingly. The law did\r\n     pass; and a vast increase of investment in manufacturing\r\n     establishments was the consequence.\"\r\n\r\nOpinion in New England changed for good and sufficient business reasons,\r\nand Mr. Webster changed with it. Free trade had commended itself to him as\r\nan abstract principle, and he had sustained and defended it as in the\r\ninterest of commercial New England. But when the weight of interest in New\r\nEngland shifted from free trade to protection Mr. Webster followed it. His\r\nconstituents were by no means unanimous in support of the tariff in 1828,\r\nbut the majority favored it, and Mr. Webster went with the majority. At a\r\npublic dinner given to him in Boston at the close of the session, he\r\nexplained to the dissentient minority the reasons for his vote, which were\r\nvery simple. He thought that good predominated over evil in the bill, and\r\nthat the majority throughout the whole State of which he was the\r\nrepresentative favored the tariff, and therefore he had voted in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\nMuch fault has been found, as has been said, both at the time and since,\r\nwith Mr. Webster's change of position on this question. It has been held up\r\nas a monument of inconsistency, and as indicating a total absence of deep\r\nconviction. That Mr. Webster was, in a certain sense, inconsistent is\r\nbeyond doubt, but consistency is the bugbear of small minds, as well as a\r\nmark of strong characters, while its reverse is often the proof of wisdom.\r\nOn the other hand, it may be fairly argued that, holding as he did that the\r\nwhole thing was purely a business question to be decided according to\r\ncircumstances, his course, in view of the policy adopted by the government,\r\nwas at bottom perfectly consistent. As to the want of deep conviction, Mr.\r\nWebster's vote on this question proves nothing. He believed in free trade\r\nas an abstract general principle, and there is no reason to suppose that he\r\never abandoned his belief on this point. But he had too clear a mind ever\r\nto be run away with by the extreme vagaries of the Manchester school. He\r\nknew that there was no morality, no immutable right and wrong, in an\r\nimpost or a free list. It has been the fashion to refer to Mr. Disraeli's\r\ndeclaration that free trade was \"a mere question of expediency\" as a proof\r\nof that gentleman's cynical indifference to moral principles. That the late\r\nEarl of Beaconsfield had no deep convictions on any subject may be readily\r\nadmitted, but in this instance he uttered a very plain and simple truth,\r\nwhich all the talk in the world about free trade as the harbinger and\r\nfoundation of universal peace on earth, cannot disguise.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster never at any time treated the question of free trade or\r\nprotection as anything but one of expediency. Under the lead of Mr.\r\nCalhoun, in 1816, the South and West initiated a protective policy, and\r\nafter twelve years it had become firmly established and New England had\r\nadapted herself to it. Mr. Webster, as a New England representative,\r\nresisted the protective policy at the outset as against her interests, but\r\nwhen she had conformed to the new conditions, he came over to its support\r\nsimply on the ground of expediency. He rested the defence of his new\r\nposition upon the doctrine which he had always consistently preached, that\r\nuniformity and permanency were the essential and sound conditions of any\r\npolicy, whether of free trade or protection. In 1828, neither at the dinner\r\nin Boston nor in the Senate, did he enter into any discussion of general\r\nprinciples or constitutional theories. He merely said, in substance, You\r\nhave chosen to make protection necessary to New England, and therefore I am\r\nnow forced to vote for it. This was the position which he continued to hold\r\nto the end of his life. As he was called upon, year after year, to defend\r\nprotection, and as New England became more and more wedded to the tariff,\r\nhe elaborated his arguments on many points, but the essence of all he said\r\nafterwards is to be found in the speech of 1828. On the constitutional\r\npoint he was obliged to make a more violent change. He held, of course, to\r\nhis opinion that, under the revenue power, protection could be incidental\r\nonly, because from that doctrine there was no escape. But he dropped the\r\ncondemnation expressed in 1814 and the doubts uttered in 1820 as to the\r\ntheory that it was within the direct power of Congress to enact a\r\nprotective tariff, and assumed that they had this right as one of the\r\ngeneral powers in the Constitution, or that at all events they had\r\nexercised it, and that therefore the question was henceforward to be\r\nconsidered as _res adjudicata_. The speech of 1828 marks the separation of\r\nMr. Webster from the opinions of the old school of New England Federalism.\r\nThereafter he stood forth as the champion of the tariff and of the\r\n\"American system\" of Henry Clay. Regarding protection in its true light, as\r\na mere question of expediency, he followed the interests of New England\r\nand of the great industrial communities of the North. That he shifted his\r\nground at the proper moment, bad as the \"bill of abominations\" was, and\r\nthat, as a Northern statesman, he was perfectly justified in doing so,\r\ncannot be fairly questioned or criticised. It is true that his course was a\r\nsectional one, but everybody else's on this question was the same, and it\r\ncould not be, it never has been, and never will be otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe tariff of 1828 was destined indirectly to have far more important\r\nresults to Mr. Webster than the brief speech in which he signalized his\r\nchange of position on the question of protection. Soon after the passage of\r\nthe act, in May, 1828, the South Carolina delegation held a meeting to take\r\nsteps to resist the operation of the tariff, but nothing definite was then\r\naccomplished. Popular meetings in South Carolina, characterized by much\r\nviolent talk, followed, however, during the summer, and in the autumn the\r\nLegislature of the State put forth the famous \"exposition and protest\"\r\nwhich emanated from Mr. Calhoun, and embodied in the fullest and strongest\r\nterms the principles of \"nullification.\" These movements were viewed with\r\nregret and with some alarm throughout the country, but they were rather\r\nlost sight of in the intense excitement of the presidential election. The\r\naccession of Jackson then came to absorb the public attention, and brought\r\nwith it the sweeping removals from office which Mr. Webster strongly\r\ndenounced. At the same time he was not led into the partisan absurdity of\r\ndenying the President's power of removal, and held to the impregnable\r\nposition of steady resistance to the evils of patronage, which could be\r\ncured only by the operation of an enlightened public sentiment. It is\r\nobvious now that, in the midst of all this agitation about other matters,\r\nMr. Calhoun and the South Carolinians never lost sight of the conflict for\r\nwhich they were preparing, and that they were on the alert to bring\r\nnullification to the front in a more menacing and pronounced fashion than\r\nhad yet been attempted.\r\n\r\nThe grand assault was finally made in the Senate, under the eye of the\r\ngreat nullifier, who then occupied the chair of the Vice-President, and\r\ncame in an unexpected way. In December, 1829, Mr. Foote of Connecticut\r\nintroduced a harmless resolution of inquiry respecting the sales and\r\nsurveys of the Western lands. In the long-drawn debate which ensued,\r\nGeneral Hayne of South Carolina, on January 19, 1830, made an elaborate\r\nattack on the New England States. He accused them of a desire to check the\r\ngrowth of the West in the interests of the protective policy, and tried to\r\nshow the sympathy which should exist between the West and South, and lead\r\nthem to make common cause against the tariff. Mr. Webster felt that this\r\nattack could not be left unanswered, and the next day he replied to it.\r\nThis first speech on Foote's resolution has been so obscured by the\r\ngreatness of the second that it is seldom referred to and but little read.\r\nYet it is one of the most effective retorts, one of the strongest pieces of\r\ndestructive criticism, ever uttered in the Senate, although its purpose was\r\nsimply to repel the charge of hostility to the West on the part of New\r\nEngland. The accusation was in fact absurd, and but few years had elapsed\r\nsince Mr. Webster and New England had been assailed by Mr. McDuffie for\r\ndesiring to build up the West at the expense of the South by the policy of\r\ninternal improvements. It was not difficult, therefore, to show the\r\ngroundlessness of this new attack, but Mr. Webster did it with consummate\r\nart and great force, shattering Hayne's elaborate argument to pieces and\r\ntreading it under foot. Mr. Webster only alluded incidentally to the tariff\r\nagitation in South Carolina, but the crushing nature of the reply inflamed\r\nand mortified Mr. Hayne, who, on the following day, insisted on Mr.\r\nWebster's presence, and spoke for the second time at great length. He made\r\na bitter attack upon New England, upon Mr. Webster personally, and upon the\r\ncharacter and patriotism of Massachusetts. He then made a full exposition\r\nof the doctrine of nullification, giving free expression of the views and\r\nprinciples entertained by his master and leader, who presided over the\r\ndiscussion. The debate had now drifted far from the original resolution,\r\nbut its real object had been reached at last. The war upon the tariff had\r\nbeen begun, and the standard of nullification and of resistance to the\r\nUnion and to the laws of Congress had been planted boldly in the Senate of\r\nthe United States. The debate was adjourned and Mr. Hayne did not conclude\r\ntill January 25. The next day Mr. Webster replied in the second speech on\r\nFoote's resolution, which is popularly known as the \"Reply to Hayne.\"\r\n\r\nThis great speech marks the highest point attained by Mr. Webster as a\r\npublic man. He never surpassed it, he never equalled it afterwards. It was\r\nhis zenith intellectually, politically, and as an orator. His fame grew and\r\nextended in the years which followed, he won ample distinction in other\r\nfields, he made many other splendid speeches, but he never went beyond the\r\nreply which he made to the Senator from South Carolina on January 26, 1830.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of nullification, which was the main point both with Hayne and\r\nWebster, was no new thing. The word was borrowed from the Kentucky\r\nresolutions of 1799, and the principle was contained in the more cautious\r\nphrases of the contemporary Virginia resolutions and of the Hartford\r\nConvention in 1814. The South Carolinian reproduction in 1830 was fuller\r\nand more elaborate than its predecessors and supported by more acute\r\nreasoning, but the principle was unchanged. Mr. Webster's argument was\r\nsimple but overwhelming. He admitted fully the right of revolution. He\r\naccepted the proposition that no one was bound to obey an unconstitutional\r\nlaw; but the essential question was who was to say whether a law was\r\nunconstitutional or not. Each State has that authority, was the reply of\r\nthe nullifiers, and if the decision is against the validity of the law it\r\ncannot be executed within the limits of the dissenting State. The vigorous\r\nsarcasm with which Mr. Webster depicted practical nullification, and showed\r\nthat it was nothing more or less than revolution when actually carried out,\r\nwas really the conclusive answer to the nullifying doctrine. But Mr.\r\nCalhoun and his school eagerly denied that nullification rested on the\r\nright to revolt against oppression. They argued that it was a\r\nconstitutional right; that they could live within the Constitution and\r\nbeyond it,--inside the house and outside it at one and the same time. They\r\ncontended that, the Constitution being a compact between the States, the\r\nFederal government was the creation of the States; yet, in the same breath,\r\nthey declared that the general government was a party to the contract from\r\nwhich it had itself emanated, in order to get rid of the difficulty of\r\nproving that, while the single dissenting State could decide against the\r\nvalidity of a law, the twenty or more other States, also parties to the\r\ncontract, had no right to deliver an opposite judgment which should be\r\nbinding as the opinion of the majority of the court. There was nothing very\r\ningenious or very profound in the argument by which Mr. Webster\r\ndemonstrated the absurdity of the doctrine which attempted to make\r\nnullification a peaceable constitutional privilege, when it could be in\r\npractice nothing else than revolution. But the manner in which he put the\r\nargument was magnificent and final. As he himself said, in this very speech\r\nof Samuel Dexter, \"his statement was argument, his inference\r\ndemonstration.\"\r\n\r\nThe weak places in his armor were historical in their nature. It was\r\nprobably necessary, at all events Mr. Webster felt it to be so, to argue\r\nthat the Constitution at the outset was not a compact between the States,\r\nbut a national instrument, and to distinguish the cases of Virginia and\r\nKentucky in 1799 and of New England in 1814, from that of South Carolina in\r\n1830. The former point he touched upon lightly, the latter he discussed\r\nably, eloquently, ingeniously, and at length. Unfortunately the facts were\r\nagainst him in both instances. When the Constitution was adopted by the\r\nvotes of States at Philadelphia, and accepted by the votes of States in\r\npopular conventions, it is safe to say that there was not a man in the\r\ncountry from Washington and Hamilton on the one side, to George Clinton and\r\nGeorge Mason on the other, who regarded the new system as anything but an\r\nexperiment entered upon by the States and from which each and every State\r\nhad the right peaceably to withdraw, a right which was very likely to be\r\nexercised. When the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions appeared they were\r\nnot opposed on constitutional grounds, but on those of expediency and of\r\nhostility to the revolution which they were considered to embody. Hamilton,\r\nand no one knew the Constitution better than he, treated them as the\r\nbeginnings of an attempt to change the government, as the germs of a\r\nconspiracy to destroy the Union. As Dr. Von Holst tersely and accurately\r\nstates it, \"there was no time as yet to attempt to strangle the healthy\r\nhuman mind in a net of logical deductions.\" That was the work reserved for\r\nJohn C. Calhoun.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of 1799 is true of the New England leaders at Washington when\r\nthey discussed the feasibility of secession in 1804; of the declaration in\r\nfavor of secession made by Josiah Quincy in Congress a few years later; of\r\nthe resistance of New England during the war of 1812, and of the right of\r\n\"interposition\" set forth by the Hartford Convention. In all these\r\ninstances no one troubled himself about the constitutional aspect; it was a\r\nquestion of expediency, of moral and political right or wrong. In every\r\ncase the right was simply stated, and the uniform answer was, such a step\r\nmeans the overthrow of the present system.\r\n\r\nWhen South Carolina began her resistance to the tariff in 1830, times had\r\nchanged, and with them the popular conception of the government established\r\nby the Constitution. It was now a much more serious thing to threaten the\r\nexistence of the Federal government than it had been in 1799, or even in\r\n1814. The great fabric which had been gradually built up made an overthrow\r\nof the government look very terrible; it made peaceable secession a\r\nmockery, and a withdrawal from the Union equivalent to civil war. The\r\nboldest hesitated to espouse any principle which was avowedly\r\nrevolutionary, and on both sides men wished to have a constitutional\r\ndefence for every doctrine which they promulgated. This was the feeling\r\nwhich led Mr. Calhoun to elaborate and perfect with all the ingenuity of\r\nhis acute and logical mind the arguments in favor of nullification as a\r\nconstitutional principle. At the same time the theory of nullification,\r\nhowever much elaborated, had not altered in its essence from the bald and\r\nbrief statement of the Kentucky resolutions. The vast change had come on\r\nthe other side of the question, in the popular idea of the Constitution. It\r\nwas no longer regarded as an experiment from which the contracting parties\r\nhad a right to withdraw, but as the charter of a national government. \"It\r\nis a critical moment,\" said Mr. Bell of New Hampshire to Mr. Webster, on\r\nthe morning of January 26, \"and it is time, it is high time that the\r\npeople of this country should know what this Constitution _is_.\" \"Then,\"\r\nanswered Mr. Webster, \"by the blessing of heaven they shall learn, this\r\nday, before the sun goes down, what I understand it to be.\" With these\r\nwords on his lips he entered the senate chamber, and when he replied to\r\nHayne he stated what the Union and the government had come to be at that\r\nmoment. He defined the character of the Union as it existed in 1830, and\r\nthat definition so magnificently stated, and with such grand eloquence,\r\nwent home to the hearts of the people, and put into noble words the\r\nsentiment which they felt but had not expressed. This was the significance\r\nof the reply to Hayne. It mattered not what men thought of the Constitution\r\nin 1789. The government which was then established might have degenerated\r\ninto a confederation little stronger than its predecessor. But the\r\nConstitution did its work better, and converted a confederacy into a\r\nnation. Mr. Webster set forth the national conception of the Union. He\r\nexpressed what many men were vaguely thinking and believing, and the\r\nprinciples which he made clear and definite went on broadening and\r\ndeepening until, thirty years afterwards, they had a force sufficient to\r\nsustain the North and enable her to triumph in the terrible struggle which\r\nresulted in the preservation of national life. When Mr. Webster showed that\r\npractical nullification was revolution, he had answered completely the\r\nSouth Carolinian doctrine, for revolution is not susceptible of\r\nconstitutional argument. But in the state of public opinion at that time it\r\nwas necessary to discuss nullification on constitutional grounds also, and\r\nMr. Webster did this as eloquently and ably as the nature of the case\r\nadmitted. Whatever the historical defects of his position, he put weapons\r\ninto the hands of every friend of the Union, and gave reasons and arguments\r\nto the doubting and timid. Yet after all is said, the meaning of Mr.\r\nWebster's speech in our history and its significance to us are, that it set\r\nforth with every attribute of eloquence the nature of the Union as it had\r\ndeveloped under the Constitution. He took the vague popular conception and\r\ngave it life and form and character. He said, as he alone could say, the\r\npeople of the United States are a nation, they are the masters of an\r\nempire, their union is indivisible, and the words which then rang out in\r\nthe senate chamber have come down through long years of political conflict\r\nand of civil war, until at last they are part of the political creed of\r\nevery one of his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe reply to Hayne cannot, however, be dismissed with a consideration of\r\nits historical and political meaning or of its constitutional significance.\r\nIt has a personal and literary importance of hardly less moment. There\r\ncomes an occasion, a period perhaps, in the life of every man when he\r\ntouches his highest point, when he does his best, or even, under a sudden\r\ninspiration and excitement, something better than his best, and to which he\r\ncan never again attain. At the moment it is often impossible to detect this\r\npoint, but when the man and his career have passed into history, and we can\r\nsurvey it all spread out before us like a map, the pinnacle of success can\r\neasily be discovered. The reply to Hayne was the zenith of Mr. Webster's\r\nlife, and it is the place of all others where it is fit to pause and study\r\nhim as a parliamentary orator and as a master of eloquence.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting, however, to analyze what he said, let us strive to\r\nrecall for a moment the scene of his great triumph. On the morning of the\r\nmemorable day, the senate chamber was packed by an eager and excited crowd.\r\nEvery seat on the floor and in the galleries was occupied, and all the\r\navailable standing-room was filled. The protracted debate, conducted with\r\nso much ability on both sides, had excited the attention of the whole\r\ncountry, and had given time for the arrival of hundreds of interested\r\nspectators from all parts of the Union, and especially from New England.\r\nThe fierce attacks of the Southern leaders had angered and alarmed the\r\npeople of the North. They longed with an intense longing to have these\r\nassaults met and repelled, and yet they could not believe that this\r\napparently desperate feat could be successfully accomplished. Men of the\r\nNorth and of New England could be known in Washington, in those days, by\r\ntheir indignant but dejected looks and downcast eyes. They gathered in the\r\nsenate chamber on the appointed day, quivering with anticipation, and with\r\nhope and fear struggling for the mastery in their breasts. With them were\r\nmingled those who were there from mere curiosity, and those who had come\r\nrejoicing in the confident expectation that the Northern champion would\r\nsuffer failure and defeat.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the hush of expectation, in that dead silence which is so\r\npeculiarly oppressive because it is possible only when many human beings\r\nare gathered together, Mr. Webster rose. He had sat impassive and immovable\r\nduring all the preceding days, while the storm of argument and invective\r\nhad beaten about his head. At last his time had come; and as he rose and\r\nstood forth, drawing himself up to his full height, his personal grandeur\r\nand his majestic calm thrilled all who looked upon him. With perfect\r\nquietness, unaffected apparently by the atmosphere of intense feeling about\r\nhim, he said, in a low, even tone: \"Mr. President: When the mariner has\r\nbeen tossed for many days in thick weather and on an unknown sea, he\r\nnaturally avails himself of the first pause in the storm, the earliest\r\nglance of the sun, to take his latitude and ascertain how far the elements\r\nhave driven him from his true course. Let us imitate this prudence; and,\r\nbefore we float farther on the waves of this debate, refer to the point\r\nfrom which we departed, that we may, at least, be able to conjecture where\r\nwe now are. I ask for the reading of the resolution before the Senate.\"\r\nThis opening sentence was a piece of consummate art. The simple and\r\nappropriate image, the low voice, the calm manner, relieved the strained\r\nexcitement of the audience, which might have ended by disconcerting the\r\nspeaker if it had been maintained. Every one was now at his ease; and when\r\nthe monotonous reading of the resolution ceased Mr. Webster was master of\r\nthe situation, and had his listeners in complete control. With breathless\r\nattention they followed him as he proceeded. The strong masculine\r\nsentences, the sarcasm, the pathos, the reasoning, the burning appeals to\r\nlove of State and country, flowed on unbroken. As his feelings warmed the\r\nfire came into his eyes; there was a glow on his swarthy cheek; his strong\r\nright arm seemed to sweep away resistlessly the whole phalanx of his\r\nopponents, and the deep and melodious cadences of his voice sounded like\r\nharmonious organ-tones as they filled the chamber with their music. As the\r\nlast words died away into silence, those who had listened looked\r\nwonderingly at each other, dimly conscious that they had heard one of the\r\ngrand speeches which are land-marks in the history of eloquence; and the\r\nmen of the North and of New England went forth full of the pride of\r\nvictory, for their champion had triumphed, and no assurance was needed to\r\nprove to the world that this time no answer could be made.\r\n\r\nAs every one knows, this speech contains much more than the argument\r\nagainst nullification, which has just been discussed, and exhibits all its\r\nauthor's intellectual gifts in the highest perfection. Mr. Hayne had\r\ntouched on every conceivable subject of political importance, including\r\nslavery, which, however covered up, was really at the bottom of every\r\nSouthern movement, and was certain sooner or later to come to the surface.\r\nAll these various topics Mr. Webster took up, one after another, displaying\r\na most remarkable strength of grasp and ease of treatment. He dealt with\r\nthem all effectively and yet in just proportion. Throughout there are\r\nbursts of eloquence skilfully mingled with statement and argument, so that\r\nthe listeners were never wearied by a strained and continuous rhetorical\r\ndisplay; and yet, while the attention was closely held by the even flow of\r\nlucid reasoning, the emotions and passions were from time to time deeply\r\naroused and strongly excited. In many passages of direct retort Mr. Webster\r\nused an irony which he employed always in a perfectly characteristic way.\r\nHe had a strong natural sense of humor, but he never made fun or descended\r\nto trivial efforts to excite laughter against his opponent. He was not a\r\nwitty man or a maker of epigrams. But he was a master in the use of a cold,\r\ndignified sarcasm, which at times, and in this instance particularly, he\r\nused freely and mercilessly. Beneath the measured sentences there is a\r\nlurking smile which saves them from being merely savage and cutting\r\nattacks, and yet brings home a keen sense of the absurdity of the\r\nopponent's position. The weapon resembled more the sword of Richard than\r\nthe scimetar of Saladin, but it was none the less a keen and trenchant\r\nblade. There is probably no better instance of Mr. Webster's power of\r\nsarcasm than the famous passage in which he replied to Hayne's taunt about\r\nthe \"murdered coalition,\" which was said to have existed between Adams and\r\nCalhoun. In a totally different vein is the passage about Massachusetts,\r\nperhaps in its way as good an example as we have of Webster's power of\r\nappealing to the higher and more tender feelings of human nature. The\r\nthought is simple and even obvious, and the expression unadorned, and yet\r\nwhat he said had that subtle quality which stirred and still stirs the\r\nheart of every man born on the soil of the old Puritan Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe speech as a whole has all the qualities which made Mr. Webster a great\r\norator, and the same traits run through his other speeches. An analysis of\r\nthe reply to Hayne, therefore, gives us all the conditions necessary to\r\nforming a correct idea of Mr. Webster's eloquence, of its characteristics\r\nand its value. The Attic school of oratory subordinated form to thought to\r\navoid the misuse of ornament, and triumphed over the more florid practice\r\nof the so-called \"Asiatics.\" Rome gave the palm to Atticism, and modern\r\noratory has gone still farther in the same direction, until its predominant\r\nquality has become that of making sustained appeals to the understanding.\r\nLogical vigilance and long chains of reasoning, avoided by the ancients,\r\nare the essentials of our modern oratory. Many able men have achieved\r\nsuccess under these conditions as forcible and convincing speakers. But the\r\ngrand eloquence of modern times is distinguished by the bursts of feeling,\r\nof imagery or of invective, joined with convincing argument. This\r\ncombination is rare, and whenever we find a man who possesses it we may be\r\nsure that, in greater or less degree, he is one of the great masters of\r\neloquence as we understand it. The names of those who in debate or to a\r\njury have been in every-day practice strong and effective speakers, and\r\nalso have thrilled and shaken large masses of men, readily occur to us. To\r\nthis class belong Chatham and Burke, Fox, Sheridan and Erskine, Mirabeau\r\nand Vergniaud, Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was of course essentially modern in his oratory. He relied\r\nchiefly on the sustained appeal to the understanding, and he was a\r\nconspicuous example of the prophetic character which Christianity, and\r\nProtestantism especially, has given to modern eloquence. At the same time\r\nMr. Webster was in some respects more classical, and resembled more closely\r\nthe models of antiquity, than any of those who have been mentioned as\r\nbelonging to the same high class. He was wont to pour forth the copious\r\nstream of plain, intelligible observations, and indulge in the varied\r\nappeals to feeling, memory, and interest, which Lord Brougham sets down as\r\ncharacteristic of ancient oratory. It has been said that while Demosthenes\r\nwas a sculptor, Burke was a painter. Mr. Webster was distinctly more of the\r\nformer than the latter. He rarely amplified or developed an image or a\r\ndescription, and in this he followed the Greek rather than the Englishman.\r\nDr. Francis Lieber wrote: \"To test Webster's oratory, which has ever been\r\nvery attractive to me, I read a portion of my favorite speeches of\r\nDemosthenes, and then read, always aloud, parts of Webster; then returned\r\nto the Athenian; and Webster stood the test.\" Apart from the great\r\ncompliment which this conveys, such a comparison is very interesting as\r\nshowing the similarity between Mr. Webster and the Greek orator. Not only\r\ndoes the test indicate the merit of Mr. Webster's speeches, but it also\r\nproves that he resembled the Athenian, and that the likeness was more\r\nstriking than the inevitable difference born of race and time. Yet there\r\nis no indication that Webster ever made a study of the ancient models or\r\ntried to form himself upon them.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the classic self-restraint in Webster was partly due to the\r\nartistic sense which made him so devoted to simplicity of diction, and\r\npartly to the cast of his mind. He had a powerful historic imagination, but\r\nnot in the least the imagination of the poet, which\r\n\r\n    \"Bodies forth the forms of things unknown.\"\r\n\r\nHe could describe with great vividness, brevity, and force what had\r\nhappened in the past, what actually existed, or what the future promised.\r\nBut his fancy never ran away with him or carried him captive into the\r\nregions of poetry. Imagination of this sort is readily curbed and\r\ncontrolled, and, if less brilliant, is safer than that defined by\r\nShakespeare. For this reason, Mr. Webster rarely indulged in long,\r\ndescriptive passages, and, while he showed the highest power in treating\r\nanything with a touch of humanity about it, he was sparing of images drawn\r\nwholly from nature, and was not peculiarly successful in depicting in words\r\nnatural scenery or phenomena. The result is, that in his highest flights,\r\nwhile he is often grand and affecting, full of life and power, he never\r\nshows the creative imagination. But if he falls short on the poetic side,\r\nthere is the counterbalancing advantage that there is never a false note\r\nnor an overwrought description which offends our taste and jars upon our\r\nsensibilities.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster showed his love of direct simplicity in his style even more\r\nthan in his thought or the general arrangement and composition of his\r\nspeeches. His sentences are, as a rule, short, and therefore pointed and\r\nintelligible, but they never become monotonous and harsh, the fault to\r\nwhich brevity is always liable. On the contrary, they are smooth and\r\nflowing, and there is always a sufficient variety of form. The choice of\r\nlanguage is likewise simple. Mr. Webster was a remorseless critic of his\r\nown style, and he had an almost extreme preference for Anglo-Saxon words\r\nand a corresponding dislike of Latin derivatives. The only exception he\r\nmade was in his habit of using \"commence\" instead of its far superior\r\nsynonym \"begin.\" His style was vigorous, clear, and direct in the highest\r\ndegree, and at the same time warm and full of vitality. He displayed that\r\nrare union of strength with perfect simplicity, the qualities which made\r\nSwift the great master of pure and forcible English.\r\n\r\nCharles Fox is credited with saying that a good speech never reads well.\r\nThis opinion, taken in the sense in which it was intended, that a\r\ncarefully-prepared speech, which reads like an essay, lacks the freshness\r\nand glow that should characterize the oratory of debate, is undoubtedly\r\ncorrect. But it is equally true that when a speech which we know to have\r\nbeen good in delivery is equally good in print, a higher intellectual plane\r\nis reached and a higher level of excellence is attained than is possible to\r\neither the mere essay or to the effective retort or argument, which loses\r\nits flavor with the occasion which draws it forth. Mr. Webster's speeches\r\non the tariff, on the bank, and on like subjects, able as they are, are\r\nnecessarily dry, but his speeches on nobler themes are admirable reading.\r\nThis is, of course, due to the variety and ease of treatment, to their\r\npower, and to the purity of the style. At the same time, the immediate\r\neffect of what he said was immense, greater, even, than the intrinsic merit\r\nof the speech itself. There has been much discussion as to the amount of\r\npreparation which Mr. Webster made. His occasional orations were, of\r\ncourse, carefully written out beforehand, a practice which was entirely\r\nproper; but in his great parliamentary speeches, and often in legal\r\narguments as well, he made but slight preparation in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe term. The notes for the two speeches on Foote's resolution were jotted\r\ndown on a few sheets of note-paper. The delivery of the second one, his\r\nmasterpiece, was practically extemporaneous, and yet it fills seventy\r\noctavo pages and occupied four hours. He is reported to have said that his\r\nwhole life had been a preparation for the reply to Hayne. Whether he said\r\nit or not, the statement is perfectly true. The thoughts on the Union and\r\non the grandeur of American nationality had been garnered up for years, and\r\nthis in a greater or less degree was true of all his finest efforts. The\r\npreparation on paper was trifling, but the mental preparation extending\r\nover weeks or days, sometimes, perhaps, over years, was elaborate to the\r\nlast point. When the moment came, a night's work would put all the\r\nstored-up thoughts in order, and on the next day they would pour forth with\r\nall the power of a strong mind thoroughly saturated with its subject, and\r\nyet with the vitality of unpremeditated expression, having the fresh glow\r\nof morning upon it, and with no trace of the lamp.\r\n\r\nMore than all this, however, in the immediate effect of Mr. Webster's\r\nspeeches was the physical influence of the man himself. We can but half\r\nunderstand his eloquence and its influence if we do not carefully study his\r\nphysical attributes, his temperament and disposition. In face, form, and\r\nvoice, nature did her utmost for Daniel Webster. No envious fairy was\r\npresent at his birth to mar these gifts by her malign influence. He seemed\r\nto every one to be a giant; that, at least, is the word we most commonly\r\nfind applied to him, and there is no better proof of his enormous physical\r\nimpressiveness than this well-known fact, for Mr. Webster was not a man of\r\nextraordinary stature. He was five feet ten inches in height, and, in\r\nhealth, weighed a little less than two hundred pounds. These are the\r\nproportions of a large man, but there is nothing remarkable about them. We\r\nmust look elsewhere than to mere size to discover why men spoke of Webster\r\nas a giant. He had a swarthy complexion and straight black hair. His head\r\nwas very large, the brain weighing, as is well known, more than any on\r\nrecord, except those of Cuvier and of the celebrated bricklayer. At the\r\nsame time his head was of noble shape, with a broad and lofty brow, and his\r\nfeatures were finely cut and full of massive strength. His eyes were\r\nextraordinary. They were very dark and deep-set, and, when he began to\r\nrouse himself to action, shone with the deep light of a forge-fire, getting\r\never more glowing as excitement rose. His voice was in harmony with his\r\nappearance. It was low and musical in conversation; in debate it was high\r\nbut full, ringing out in moments of excitement like a clarion, and then\r\nsinking to deep notes with the solemn richness of organ-tones, while the\r\nwords were accompanied by a manner in which grace and dignity mingled in\r\ncomplete accord. The impression which he produced upon the eye and ear it\r\nis difficult to express. There is no man in all history who came into the\r\nworld so equipped physically for speech. In this direction nature could do\r\nno more. The mere look of the man and the sound of his voice made all who\r\nsaw and heard him feel that he must be the embodiment of wisdom, dignity,\r\nand strength, divinely eloquent, even if he sat in dreamy silence or\r\nuttered nothing but heavy commonplaces.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that no one of the many pictures of Mr. Webster gives a\r\ntrue idea of what he was. We can readily believe this when we read the\r\ndescriptions which have come down to us. That indefinable quality which we\r\ncall personal magnetism, the power of impressing by one's personality every\r\nhuman being who comes near, was at its height in Mr. Webster. He never, for\r\ninstance, punished his children, but when they did wrong he would send for\r\nthem and look at them silently. The look, whether of anger or sorrow, was\r\npunishment and rebuke enough. It was the same with other children. The\r\nlittle daughter of Mr. Wirt once came into a room where Mr. Webster was\r\nsitting with his back toward her, and touched him on the arm. He turned\r\nsuddenly, and the child started back with an affrighted cry at the sight of\r\nthat dark, stern, melancholy face. But the cloud passed as swiftly as the\r\nshadows on a summer sea, and the next moment the look of affection and\r\nhumor brought the frightened child into Mr. Webster's arms, and they were\r\nfriends and playmates in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe power of a look and of changing expression, so magical with a child,\r\nwas hardly less so with men. There have been very few instances in history\r\nwhere there is such constant reference to merely physical attributes as in\r\nthe case of Mr. Webster. His general appearance and his eyes are the first\r\nand last things alluded to in every contemporary description. Every one is\r\nfamiliar with the story of the English navvy who pointed at Mr. Webster in\r\nthe streets of Liverpool and said, \"There goes a king.\" Sidney Smith\r\nexclaimed when he saw him, \"Good heavens, he is a small cathedral by\r\nhimself.\" Carlyle, no lover of America, wrote to Emerson:--\r\n\r\n     \"Not many days ago I saw at breakfast the notablest of all your\r\n     notabilities, Daniel Webster. He is a magnificent specimen. You\r\n     might say to all the world, 'This is our Yankee Englishman; such\r\n     limbs we make in Yankee land!' As a logic fencer, or parliamentary\r\n     Hercules, one would incline to back him at first sight against all\r\n     the extant world. The tanned complexion; that amorphous crag-like\r\n     face; the dull black eyes under the precipice of brows, like dull\r\n     anthracite furnaces needing only to be _blown_; the mastiff mouth\r\n     accurately closed; I have not traced so much of _silent Berserkir\r\n     rage_ that I remember of in any man. 'I guess I should not like to\r\n     be your nigger!' Webster is not loquacious, but he is pertinent,\r\n     conclusive; a dignified, perfectly bred man, though not English in\r\n     breeding; a man worthy of the best reception among us, and meeting\r\n     such I understand.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the effect produced by Mr. Webster when in England, and it was a\r\nuniversal impression. Wherever he went men felt in the depths of their\r\nbeing the amazing force of his personal presence. He could control an\r\naudience by a look, and could extort applause from hostile listeners by a\r\nmere glance. On one occasion, after the 7th of March speech, there is a\r\nstory that a noted abolitionist leader was present in the crowd gathered to\r\nhear Mr. Webster, and this bitter opponent is reported to have said\r\nafterwards, \"When Webster, speaking of secession, asked 'what is to become\r\nof me,' I was thrilled with a sense of some awful impending calamity.\" The\r\nstory may be apocryphal, but there can be no doubt of its essential truth\r\nso far as the effect of Mr. Webster's personal presence goes. People looked\r\nat him, and that was enough. Mr. Parton in his essay speaks of seeing\r\nWebster at a public dinner, sitting at the head of the table with a bottle\r\nof Madeira under his yellow waistcoat, and looking like Jove. When he\r\npresided at the Cooper memorial meeting in New York he uttered only a few\r\nstately platitudes, and yet every one went away with the firm conviction\r\nthat they had heard him speak words of the profoundest wisdom and grandest\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nThe temptation to rely on his marvellous physical gifts grew on him as he\r\nbecame older, which was to be expected with a man of his temperament. Even\r\nin his early days, when he was not in action, he had an impassible and\r\nslumberous look; and when he sat listening to the invective of Hayne, no\r\nemotion could be traced on his cold, dark, melancholy face, or in the\r\ncavernous eyes shining with a dull light. This all vanished when he began\r\nto speak, and, as he poured forth his strong, weighty sentences, there was\r\nno lack of expression or of movement. But Mr. Webster, despite his capacity\r\nfor work, and his protracted and often intense labor, was constitutionally\r\nindolent, and this sluggishness of temperament increased very much as he\r\ngrew older. It extended from the periods of repose to those of action\r\nuntil, in his later years, a direct stimulus was needed to make him exert\r\nhimself. Even to the last the mighty power was still there in undiminished\r\nstrength, but it was not willingly put forth. Sometimes the outside impulse\r\nwould not come; sometimes the most trivial incident would suffice, and like\r\na spark on the train of gunpowder would bring a sudden burst of eloquence,\r\nelectrifying all who listened. On one occasion he was arguing a case to the\r\njury. He was talking in his heaviest and most ponderous fashion, and with\r\nhalf-closed eyes. The court and the jurymen were nearly asleep as Mr.\r\nWebster argued on, stating the law quite wrongly to his nodding listeners.\r\nThe counsel on the other side interrupted him and called the attention of\r\nthe court to Mr. Webster's presentation of the law. The judge, thus\r\nawakened, explained to the jury that the law was not as Mr. Webster stated\r\nit. While this colloquy was in progress Mr. Webster roused up, pushed back\r\nhis thick hair, shook himself, and glanced about him with the look of a\r\ncaged lion. When the judge paused, he turned again to the jury, his eyes no\r\nlonger half shut but wide open and glowing with excitement. Raising his\r\nvoice, he said, in tones which made every one start: \"If my client could\r\nrecover under the law as I stated it, how much more is he entitled to\r\nrecover under the law as laid down by the court;\" and then, the jury now\r\nbeing thoroughly awake, he poured forth a flood of eloquent argument and\r\nwon his case. In his latter days Mr. Webster made many careless and dull\r\nspeeches and carried them through by the power of his look and manner, but\r\nthe time never came when, if fairly aroused, he failed to sway the hearts\r\nand understandings of men by a grand and splendid eloquence. The lion slept\r\nvery often, but it never became safe to rouse him from his slumber.\r\n\r\nIt was soon after the reply to Hayne that Mr. Webster made his great\r\nargument for the government in the White murder case. One other address to\r\na jury in the Goodridge case, and the defence of Judge Prescott before the\r\nMassachusetts Senate, which is of similar character, have been preserved to\r\nus. The speech for Prescott is a strong, dignified appeal to the sober, and\r\nyet sympathetic, judgment of his hearers, but wholly free from any attempt\r\nto confuse or mislead, or to sway the decision by unwholesome pathos. Under\r\nthe circumstances, which were very adverse to his client, the argument was\r\na model of its kind, and contains some very fine passages full of the\r\nsolemn force so characteristic of its author. The Goodridge speech is\r\nchiefly remarkable for the ease with which Mr. Webster unravelled a\r\ncomplicated set of facts, demonstrated that the accuser was in reality the\r\nguilty party, and carried irresistible conviction to the minds of the\r\njurors. It was connected with a remarkable exhibition of his power of\r\ncross-examination, which was not only acute and penetrating, but extremely\r\nterrifying to a recalcitrant witness. The argument in the White case, as a\r\nspecimen of eloquence, stands on far higher ground than either of the other\r\ntwo, and, apart from the nature of the subject, ranks with the very best of\r\nMr. Webster's oratorical triumphs. The opening of the speech, comprising\r\nthe account of the murder and the analysis of the workings of a mind seared\r\nwith the remembrance of a horrid crime, must be placed among the very\r\nfinest masterpieces of modern oratory. The description of the feelings of\r\nthe murderer has a touch of the creative power, but, taken in conjunction\r\nwith the wonderful picture of the deed itself, the whole exhibits the\r\nhighest imaginative excellence, and displays the possession of an\r\nextraordinary dramatic force such as Mr. Webster rarely exerted. It has the\r\nsame power of exciting a kind of horror and of making us shudder with a\r\ncreeping, nameless terror as the scene after the murder of Duncan, when\r\nMacbeth rushes out from the chamber of death, crying, \"I have done the\r\ndeed. Didst thou not hear a noise?\" I have studied this famous exordium\r\nwith extreme care, and I have sought diligently in the works of all the\r\ngreat modern orators, and of some of the ancient as well, for similar\r\npassages of higher merit. My quest has been in vain. Mr. Webster's\r\ndescription of the White murder, and of the ghastly haunting sense of guilt\r\nwhich pursued the assassin, has never been surpassed in dramatic force by\r\nany speaker, whether in debate or before a jury. Perhaps the most\r\ncelebrated descriptive passage in the literature of modern eloquence is the\r\npicture drawn by Burke of the descent of Hyder Ali upon the plains of the\r\nCarnatic, but even that certainly falls short of the opening of Webster's\r\nspeech in simple force as well as in dramatic power. Burke depicted with\r\nall the ardor of his nature and with a wealth of color a great invasion\r\nwhich swept thousands to destruction. Webster's theme was a cold-blooded\r\nmurder in a quiet New England town. Comparison between such topics, when\r\none is so infinitely larger than the other, seems at first sight almost\r\nimpossible. But Mr. Webster also dealt with the workings of the human heart\r\nunder the influence of the most terrible passions, and those have furnished\r\nsufficient material for the genius of Shakespeare. The test of excellence\r\nis in the treatment, and in this instance Mr. Webster has never been\r\nexcelled. The effect of that exordium, delivered as he alone could have\r\ndelivered it, must have been appalling. He was accused of having been\r\nbrought into the case to hurry the jury beyond the law and evidence, and\r\nhis whole speech was certainly calculated to drive any body of men,\r\nterror-stricken by his eloquence, wherever he wished them to go. Mr.\r\nWebster did not have that versatility and variety of eloquence which we\r\nassociate with the speakers who have produced the most startling effect\r\nupon that complex thing called a jury. He never showed that rapid\r\nalternation of wit, humor, pathos, invective, sublimity, and ingenuity\r\nwhich have been characteristic of the greatest advocates. Before a jury as\r\neverywhere else he was direct and simple. He awed and terrified jurymen; he\r\nconvinced their reason; but he commanded rather than persuaded, and carried\r\nthem with him by sheer force of eloquence and argument, and by his\r\noverpowering personality.\r\n\r\nThe extravagant admiration which Mr. Webster excited among his followers\r\nhas undoubtedly exaggerated his greatness in many respects; but, high as\r\nthe praise bestowed upon him as an orator has been, in that direction at\r\nleast he has certainly not been overestimated. The reverse rather is true.\r\nMr. Webster was, of course, the greatest orator this country has ever\r\nproduced. Patrick Henry's fame rests wholly on tradition. The same is true\r\nof Hamilton, who, moreover, never had an opportunity adequate to his\r\ntalents, which were unquestionably of the first order. Fisher Ames's\r\nreputation was due to a single speech which is distinctly inferior to many\r\nof Webster's. Clay's oratory has not stood the test of time; his speeches,\r\nwhich were so wonderfully effective when he uttered them, seem dead and\r\ncold and rather thin as we read them to-day. Calhoun was a great debater,\r\nbut was too dry and hard for the highest eloquence. John Quincy Adams,\r\ndespite his physical limitations, carried the eloquence of combat and\r\nbitter retort to the highest point in the splendid battles of his\r\ncongressional career, but his learning, readiness, power of expression,\r\nargument, and scathing sarcasm were not rounded into a perfect whole by the\r\nmore graceful attributes which also form an essential part of oratory.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster need not fear comparison with any of his countrymen, and he has\r\nno reason to shun it with the greatest masters of speech in England. He had\r\nmuch of the grandeur of Chatham, with whom it is impossible to compare him\r\nor indeed any one else, for the Great Commoner lives only in fragments of\r\ndoubtful accuracy. Sheridan was universally considered to have made the\r\nmost splendid speech of his day. Yet the speech on the Begums as given by\r\nMoore does not cast Webster's best work at all into the shade. Webster did\r\nnot have Sheridan's brilliant wit, but on the other hand he was never\r\nforced, never involved, never guilty of ornament, which fastidious judges\r\nwould now pronounce tawdry. Webster's best speeches read much better than\r\nanything of Sheridan, and, so far as we can tell from careful descriptions,\r\nhis manner, look, and delivery were far more imposing. The \"manly\r\neloquence\" of Fox seems to have resembled Webster's more closely than that\r\nof any other of his English rivals. Fox was more fertile, more brilliant,\r\nmore surprising than Webster, and had more quickness and dash, and a\r\ngreater ease and charm of manner. But he was often careless, and sometimes\r\nfell into repetitions, from which, of course, no great speaker can be\r\nwholly free any more than he can keep entirely clear of commonplaces.\r\nWebster gained upon him by superior finish and by greater weight of\r\nargument. Before a jury Webster fell behind Erskine as he did behind\r\nChoate, although neither of them ever produced anything at all comparable\r\nto the speech on the White murder; but in the Senate, and in the general\r\nfield of oratory, he rises high above them both. The man with whom Webster\r\nis oftenest compared, and the last to be mentioned, is of course Burke. It\r\nmay be conceded at once that in creative imagination, and in richness of\r\nimagery and language, Burke ranks above Webster. But no one would ever have\r\nsaid of Webster as Goldsmith did of Burke:--\r\n\r\n    \"Who, too deep for his hearers, still went on refining,\r\n    And thought of convincing while they thought of dining.\"\r\n\r\nWebster never sinned by over refinement or over ingenuity, for both were\r\nutterly foreign to his nature. Still less did he impair his power in the\r\nSenate as Burke did in the Commons by talking too often and too much. If he\r\ndid not have the extreme beauty and grace of which Burke was capable, he\r\nwas more forcible and struck harder and more weighty blows. He was greatly\r\naided in this by his brief and measured periods, and his strength was never\r\nwasted in long and elaborate sentences. Webster, moreover, would never have\r\ndegenerated into the ranting excitement which led Burke to draw a knife\r\nfrom his bosom and cast it on the floor of the House. This illustrates what\r\nwas, perhaps, Mr. Webster's very strongest point,--his absolute good taste.\r\nHe may have been ponderous at times in his later years. We know that he was\r\noccasionally heavy, pompous, and even dull, but he never violated the rules\r\nof the nicest taste. Other men have been more versatile, possessed of a\r\nricher imagination, and more gorgeous style, with a more brilliant wit and\r\na keener sarcasm, but there is not one who is so absolutely free from\r\nfaults of taste as Webster, or who is so uniformly simple and pure in\r\nthought and style, even to the point of severity.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A volume might be written comparing Mr. Webster with other\r\ngreat orators. Only the briefest and most rudimentary treatment of the\r\nsubject is possible here. A most excellent study of the comparative\r\nexcellence of Webster's eloquence has been made by Judge Chamberlain,\r\nLibrarian of the Boston Public Library, in a speech at the dinner of the\r\nDartmouth Alumni, which has since been printed as a pamphlet.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to compare Mr. Webster with this and the other great orator,\r\nand to select points of resemblance and of difference, and show where Mr.\r\nWebster was superior and where he fell behind. But the final verdict must\r\nbe upon all his qualities taken together. He had the most extraordinary\r\nphysical gifts of face, form, and voice, and employed them to the best\r\nadvantage. Thus equipped, he delivered a long series of great speeches\r\nwhich can be read to-day with the deepest interest, instruction, and\r\npleasure. He had dignity, grandeur, and force, a strong historic\r\nimagination, and great dramatic power when he chose to exert it. He\r\npossessed an unerring taste, a capacity for vigorous and telling sarcasm, a\r\nglow and fire none the less intense because they were subdued, perfect\r\nclearness of statement joined to the highest skill in argument, and he was\r\nmaster of a style which was as forcible as it was simple and pure. Take him\r\nfor all in all, he was not only the greatest orator this country has ever\r\nknown, but in the history of eloquence his name will stand with those of\r\nDemosthenes and Cicero, of Chatham and Burke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE WITH JACKSON AND THE RISE OF THE WHIG PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year preceding the delivery of his great speech Mr. Webster had lost\r\nhis brother Ezekiel by sudden death, and he had married for his second wife\r\nMiss Leroy of New York. The former event was a terrible grief to him, and\r\ntaken in conjunction with the latter seemed to make a complete break with\r\nthe past, and with its struggles and privations, its joys and successes.\r\nThe slender girl whom he had married in Salisbury church and the beloved\r\nbrother were both gone, and with them went those years of youth in which,--\r\n\r\n       \"He had sighed deep, laughed free,\r\n    Starved, feasted, despaired, been happy.\"\r\n\r\nOne cannot come to this dividing line in Mr. Webster's life without regret.\r\nThere was enough of brilliant achievement and substantial success in what\r\nhad gone before to satisfy any man, and it had been honest, simple, and\r\nunaffected. A wider fame and a greater name lay before him, but with them\r\ncame also ugly scandals, bitter personal attacks, an ambition which warped\r\nhis nature, and finally a terrible mistake. One feels inclined to say of\r\nthese later years, with the Roman lover:--\r\n\r\n                \"Shut them in\r\n    With their triumphs and their glories and the rest,\r\n                 Love is best.\"\r\n\r\nThe home changed first, and then the public career. The reply which, as\r\nJohn Quincy Adams said, \"utterly demolished the fabric of Hayne's speech\r\nand left scarcely a wreck to be seen,\" went straight home to the people of\r\nthe North. It gave eloquent expression to the strong but undefined feeling\r\nin the popular mind. It found its way into every house and was read\r\neverywhere; it took its place in the school books, to be repeated by shrill\r\nboy voices, and became part of the literature and of the intellectual life\r\nof the country. In those solemn sentences men read the description of what\r\nthe United States had come to be under the Constitution, and what American\r\nnationality meant in 1830. The leaders of the young war party in 1812 were\r\nthe first to arouse the national sentiment, but no one struck the chord\r\nwith such a master hand as Mr. Webster, or drew forth such long and deep\r\nvibrations. There is no single utterance in our history which has done so\r\nmuch by mere force of words to strengthen the love of nationality and\r\nimplant it deeply in the popular heart, as the reply to Hayne.\r\n\r\nBefore the delivery of that speech Mr. Webster was a distinguished\r\nstatesman, but the day after he awoke to a national fame which made all his\r\nother triumphs pale. Such fame brought with it, of course, as it always\r\ndoes in this country, talk of the presidency. The reply to Hayne made Mr.\r\nWebster a presidential candidate, and from that moment he was never free\r\nfrom the gnawing, haunting ambition to win the grand prize of American\r\npublic life. There was a new force in his career, and in all the years to\r\ncome the influence of that force must be reckoned and remembered.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was anxious that the party of opposition to General Jackson,\r\nwhich then passed by the name of National Republicans, should be in some\r\nway strengthened, solidified, and placed on a broad platform of distinct\r\nprinciples. He saw with great regret the ruin which was threatened by the\r\nanti-masonic schism, and it would seem that he was not indisposed to take\r\nadvantage of this to stop the nomination of Mr. Clay, who was peculiarly\r\nobjectionable to the opponents of masonry. He earnestly desired the\r\nnomination himself, but even his own friends in the party told him that\r\nthis was out of the question, and he acquiesced in their decision. Mr.\r\nClay's personal popularity, moreover, among the National Republicans was,\r\nin truth, invincible, and he was unanimously nominated by the convention at\r\nBaltimore. The action of the anti-masonic element in the country doomed\r\nClay to defeat, which he was likely enough to encounter in any event; but\r\nthe consolidation of the party so ardently desired by Mr. Webster was\r\nbrought about by acts of the administration, which completely overcame any\r\nintestine divisions among its opponents.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1831-1832, when the country was preparing for the coming\r\npresidential election, marks the beginning of the fierce struggle with\r\nAndrew Jackson which was to give birth to a new and powerful organization\r\nknown in our history as the Whig party, and destined, after years of\r\nconflict, to bring overwhelming defeat to the \"Jacksonian democracy.\" There\r\nis no occasion here to enter into a history of the famous bank controversy.\r\nEstablished in 1816, the bank of the United States, after a period of\r\ndifficulties, had become a powerful and valuable financial organization. In\r\n1832 it applied for a continuance of its charter, which then had three\r\nyears still to run. Mr. Webster did not enter into the personal contest\r\nwhich had already begun, but in a speech of great ability advocated a\r\nrenewal of the charter, showing, as he always did on such themes, a\r\nknowledge and a grasp of the principles and intricacies of public finance\r\nunequalled in our history except by Hamilton. In a second speech he made a\r\nmost effective and powerful argument against a proposition to give the\r\nStates authority to tax the bank, defending the doctrines laid down by\r\nChief Justice Marshall in McCullough vs. Maryland, and denying the power of\r\nCongress to give the States the right of such taxation, because by so doing\r\nthey violated the Constitution. The amendment was defeated, and the bill\r\nfor the continuance of the charter passed both Houses by large majorities.\r\n\r\nJackson returned the bill with a veto. He had the audacity to rest his veto\r\nupon the ground that the bill was unconstitutional, and that it was the\r\nduty of the President to decide upon the constitutionality of every measure\r\nwithout feeling in the least bound by the opinion of Congress or of the\r\nSupreme Court. His ignorance was so crass that he failed to perceive the\r\ndistinction between a new bill and one to continue an existing law, while\r\nhis vanity and his self-assumption were so colossal that he did not\r\nhesitate to assert that he had the right and the power to declare an\r\nexisting law, passed by Congress, approved by Madison, and held to be\r\nconstitutional by an express decision of the Supreme Court, to be invalid,\r\nbecause he thought fit to say so. To overthrow such doctrines was not\r\ndifficult, but Mr. Webster refuted them with a completeness and force which\r\nwere irresistible. At the same time he avoided personal attack in the\r\ndignified way which was characteristic of him, despite the extraordinary\r\ntemptation to indulge in invective and telling sarcasm to which Jackson by\r\nhis ignorance and presumption had so exposed himself. The bill was lost,\r\nthe great conflict with the bank was begun, and the Whig party was founded.\r\n\r\nAnother event of a different character, which had occurred not long before,\r\nhelped to widen the breach and to embitter the contest between the parties\r\nof the administration and of the opposition. When in 1829 Mr. McLane had\r\nreceived his instructions as Minister to England, he had been directed by\r\nMr. Van Buren to reopen negotiations on the subject of the West Indian\r\ntrade, and in so doing the Secretary of State had reflected on the previous\r\nadministration, and had said that the party in power would not support the\r\npretensions of its predecessors. Such language was, of course, at variance\r\nwith all traditions, was wholly improper, and was mean and contemptible in\r\ndealing with a foreign nation. In 1831 Mr. Van Buren was nominated as\r\nMinister to England, and came up for confirmation in the Senate some time\r\nafter he had actually departed on his mission. Mr. Webster opposed the\r\nconfirmation in an eloquent speech full of just pride in his country and of\r\nvigorous indignation against the slight which Mr. Van Buren had put upon\r\nher by his instructions to Mr. McLane. He pronounced a splendid \"rebuke\r\nupon the first instance in which an American minister had been sent abroad\r\nas the representative of his party and not as the representative of his\r\ncountry.\" The opposition was successful, and Mr. Van Buren's nomination\r\nwas rejected. It is no doubt true that the rejection was a political\r\nmistake, and that, as was commonly said at the time, it created sympathy\r\nfor Mr. Van Buren and insured his succession to the presidency. Yet no one\r\nwould now think as well of Mr. Webster if, to avoid awakening popular\r\nsympathy and party enthusiasm in behalf of Mr. Van Buren, he had silently\r\nvoted for that gentleman's confirmation. To do so was to approve the\r\ndespicable tone adopted in the instructions to McLane. As a patriotic\r\nAmerican, above all as a man of intense national feelings, Mr. Webster\r\ncould not have done otherwise than resist with all the force of his\r\neloquence the confirmation of a man who had made such an undignified and\r\nunworthy exhibition of partisanship. Politically he may have been wrong,\r\nbut morally he was wholly right, and his rebuke stands in our history as a\r\nreproach which Mr. Van Buren's subsequent success can neither mitigate nor\r\nimpair.\r\n\r\nThere was another measure, however, which had a far different effect from\r\nthose which tended to build up the opposition to Jackson and his followers.\r\nA movement was begun by Mr. Clay looking to a revision and reduction of the\r\ntariff, which finally resulted in a bill reducing duties on many articles\r\nto a revenue standard, and leaving those on cotton and woollen goods and\r\niron unchanged. In the debates which occurred during the passage of this\r\nbill Mr. Webster took but little part, but they caused a furious outbreak\r\non the part of the South Carolinians led by Hayne, and ended in the\r\nconfirmation of the protective policy. When Mr. Webster spoke at the New\r\nYork dinner in 1831, he gave his hearers to understand very clearly that\r\nthe nullification agitation was not at an end, and after the passage of the\r\nnew tariff bill he saw close at hand the danger which he had predicted.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1832, South Carolina in convention passed her famous ordinance\r\nnullifying the revenue laws of the United States, and her Legislature,\r\nwhich assembled soon after, enacted laws to carry out the ordinance, and\r\ngave an open defiance to the Federal government. The country was filled\r\nwith excitement. It was known that Mr. Calhoun, having published a letter\r\nin defence of nullification, had resigned the vice-presidency, accepted the\r\nsenatorship of South Carolina, and was coming to the capital to advocate\r\nhis favorite doctrine. But the South Carolinians had made one trifling\r\nblunder. They had overlooked the President. Jackson was a Southerner and a\r\nDemocrat, but he was also the head of the nation, and determined to\r\nmaintain its integrity. On December 10, before Congress assembled, he\r\nissued his famous proclamation in which he took up rigorously the position\r\nadopted by Mr. Webster in his reply to Hayne, and gave the South\r\nCarolinians to understand that he would not endure treason, but would\r\nenforce constitutional laws even though he should be compelled to use\r\nbayonets to do it. The Legislature of the recalcitrant State replied in an\r\noffensive manner which only served to make Jackson angry. He, too, began to\r\nsay some pretty violent things, and, as he generally meant what he said,\r\nthe gallant leaders of nullification and other worthy people grew very\r\nuneasy. There can be no doubt that the outlook was very threatening, and\r\nthe nullifiers were extremely likely to be the first to suffer from the\r\neffects of the impending storm.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was in New Jersey, on his way to Washington, when he first\r\nreceived the proclamation, and at Philadelphia he met Mr. Clay, and from a\r\nfriend of that gentleman received a copy of a bill which was to do away\r\nwith the tariff by gradual reductions, prevent the imposition of any\r\nfurther duties, and which at the same time declared against protection and\r\nin favor of a tariff for revenue only. This headlong plunge into concession\r\nand compromise was not at all to Mr. Webster's taste. He was opposed to the\r\nscheme for economical reasons, but still more on the far higher ground that\r\nthere was open resistance to laws of undoubted constitutionality, and until\r\nthat resistance was crushed under foot any talk of compromise was a blow at\r\nthe national dignity and the national existence which ought not to be\r\ntolerated for an instant. His own course was plain. He proposed to sustain\r\nthe administration, and when the national honor should be vindicated and\r\nall unconstitutional resistance ended, then would come the time for\r\nconcessions. Jackson was not slow in giving Mr. Webster something to\r\nsupport. At the opening of the session a message was sent to Congress\r\nasking that provision might be made to enable the President to enforce the\r\nlaws by means of the land and naval forces if necessary. The message was\r\nreferred to a committee, who at once reported the celebrated \"Force Bill,\"\r\nwhich embodied the principles of the message and had the entire approval of\r\nthe President. But Jackson's party broke, despite the attitude of their\r\nchief, for many of them were from the South and could not bring themselves\r\nto the point of accepting the \"Force Bill.\" The moment was critical, and\r\nthe administration turned to Mr. Webster and took him into their councils.\r\nOn February 8 Mr. Webster rose, and, after explaining in a fashion which no\r\none was likely to forget, that this was wholly an administration measure,\r\nhe announced his intention, as an independent senator, of giving it his\r\nhearty and inflexible support. The combination thus effected was\r\noverwhelming. Mr. Calhoun was now thoroughly alarmed, and we can well\r\nimagine that the threats of hanging, in which it was rumored that the\r\nPresident had indulged, began to have a good deal of practical significance\r\nto a gentleman who, as Secretary of War, had been familiar with the\r\ncircumstances attending the deaths of Arbuthnot and Ambrister. At all\r\nevents, Mr. Calhoun lost no time in having an interview with Mr. Clay, and\r\nthe result was, that the latter, on February 11, announced that he should,\r\non the following day, introduce a tariff bill, a measure of the same sort\r\nhaving already been started in the House. The bill as introduced did not\r\ninvolve such a complete surrender as that which Mr. Webster had seen in\r\nPhiladelphia, but it necessitated most extensive modifications and gave all\r\nthat South Carolina could reasonably demand. Mr. Clay advocated it in a\r\nbrilliant speech, resting his defence on the ground that this was the only\r\nway to preserve the tariff, and that it was founded on the great\r\nconstitutional doctrine of compromise. Mr. Webster opposed the bill\r\nbriefly, and then introduced a series of resolutions combating the proposed\r\nmeasure on economical principles and on those of justice, and especially\r\nassailing the readiness to abandon the rightful powers of Congress and\r\nyield them up to any form of resistance. Before, however, he could speak in\r\nsupport of his resolutions, the \"Force Bill\" came up, and Mr. Calhoun made\r\nhis celebrated argument in support of nullification. This Mr. Webster was\r\nobliged to answer, and he replied with the great speech known in his works\r\nas \"The Constitution not a compact between sovereign States.\" In a general\r\nway the same criticism is applicable to this debate as to that with Hayne,\r\nbut there were some important differences. Mr. Calhoun's argument was\r\nsuperior to that of his follower. It was dry and hard, but it was a\r\nsplendid specimen of close and ingenious reasoning, and, as was to be\r\nexpected, the originator and master surpassed the imitator and pupil. Mr.\r\nWebster's speech, on the other hand, in respect to eloquence, was decidedly\r\ninferior to the masterpiece of 1830. Mr. Curtis says, \"Perhaps there is no\r\nspeech ever made by Mr. Webster that is so close in its reasoning, so\r\ncompact, and so powerful.\" To the first two qualities we can readily\r\nassent, but that it was equally powerful may be doubted. So long as Mr.\r\nWebster confined himself to defending the Constitution as it actually was\r\nand as what it had come to mean in point of fact, he was invincible. Just\r\nin proportion as he left this ground and attempted to argue on historical\r\npremises that it was a fundamental law, he weakened his position, for the\r\nhistorical facts were against him. In the reply to Hayne he touched but\r\nslightly on the historical, legal, and theoretical aspects of the case, and\r\nhe was overwhelming. In the reply to Calhoun he devoted his strength\r\nchiefly to these topics, and, meeting his keen antagonist on the latter's\r\nown chosen ground, he put himself at a disadvantage. In the actual present\r\nand in the steady course of development, the facts were wholly with Mr.\r\nWebster. Whatever the people of the United States understood the\r\nConstitution to mean in 1789, there can be no question that a majority in\r\n1833 regarded it as a fundamental law, and not as a compact--an opinion\r\nwhich has now become universal. But it was quite another thing to argue\r\nthat what the Constitution had come to mean was what it meant when it was\r\nadopted. The identity of meaning at these two periods was the proposition\r\nwhich Mr. Webster undertook to maintain, and he upheld it as well and as\r\nplausibly as the nature of the case admitted. His reasoning was close and\r\nvigorous; but he could not destroy the theory of the Constitution as held\r\nby leaders and people in 1789, or reconcile the Virginia and Kentucky\r\nresolutions or the Hartford Convention with the fundamental-law doctrines.\r\nNevertheless, it would be an error to suppose that because the facts of\r\nhistory were against Mr. Webster in these particulars, this able,\r\ningenious, and elaborate argument was thrown away. It was a fitting\r\nsupplement and complement to the reply to Hayne. It reiterated the national\r\nprinciples, and furnished those whom the statement and demonstration of an\r\nexisting fact could not satisfy, with an immense magazine of lucid\r\nreasoning and plausible and effective arguments. The reply to Hayne gave\r\nmagnificent expression to the popular feeling, while that to Calhoun\r\nsupplied the arguments which, after years of discussion, converted that\r\nfeeling into a fixed opinion, and made it strong enough to carry the North\r\nthrough four years of civil war. But in his final speech in this debate Mr.\r\nWebster came back to his original ground, and said, in conclusion, \"Shall\r\nwe have a general government? Shall we continue the union of States under a\r\n_government_ instead of a league? This vital and all-important question the\r\npeople will decide.\" The vital question went to the great popular jury, and\r\nthey cast aside all historical premises and deductions, all legal\r\nsubtleties and refinements, and gave their verdict on the existing facts.\r\nThe world knows what that verdict was, and will never forget that it was\r\nlargely due to the splendid eloquence of Daniel Webster when he defended\r\nthe cause of nationality against the slave-holding separatists of South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nWhile this great debate was in progress, and Mr. Webster and the faithful\r\nadherents of Jackson were pushing the \"Force Bill\" to a vote, Mr. Clay was\r\nmaking every effort to carry the compromise tariff. In spite of his\r\nexertions, the Force Bill passed on February 20, but close behind came the\r\ntariff, which Mr. Webster opposed, on its final passage, in a vigorous\r\nspeech. There is no need to enter into his economical objections, but he\r\nmade his strongest stand against the policy of sacrificing great interests\r\nto soothe South Carolina. Mr. Clay replied, but did not then press a vote,\r\nfor, with that dexterous management which he had exhibited in 1820 and was\r\nagain to display in 1850, he had succeeded in getting his tariff bill\r\ncarried rapidly through the House, in order to obviate the objection that\r\nall money bills must originate in the lower branch. The House bill passed\r\nthe Senate, Mr. Webster voting against it, and became law. There was no\r\nfurther need of the Force Bill. Clay, Calhoun, even the daring Jackson\r\nultimately, were very glad to accept the easy escape offered by a\r\ncompromise. South Carolina had in reality prevailed, although Mr. Clay had\r\nsaved protection in a modified form. Her threats of nullification had\r\nbrought the United States government to terms, and the doctrines of Calhoun\r\nwent home to the people of the South with the glory of substantial victory\r\nabout them, to breed and foster separatism and secession, and prepare the\r\nway for armed conflict with the nobler spirit of nationality which Mr.\r\nWebster had roused in the North.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Mr. Webster at this period, Mr. Benton says:--\r\n\r\n     \"He was the colossal figure on the political stage during that\r\n     eventful time, and his labors, splendid in their day, survive for\r\n     the benefit of distant posterity.\"... \"It was a splendid era in his\r\n     life, both for his intellect and his patriotism. No longer the\r\n     advocate of classes or interests, he appeared as the great\r\n     defender of the Union, of the Constitution, of the country, and of\r\n     the administration to which he was opposed. Released from the bonds\r\n     of party and the narrow confines of class and corporation advocacy,\r\n     his colossal intellect expanded to its full proportions in the\r\n     field of patriotism, luminous with the fires of genius, and\r\n     commanding the homage not of party but of country. His magnificent\r\n     harangues touched Jackson in his deepest-seated and ruling feeling,\r\n     love of country, and brought forth the response which always came\r\n     from him when the country was in peril and a defender presented\r\n     himself. He threw out the right hand of fellowship, treated Mr.\r\n     Webster with marked distinction, commended him with public praise,\r\n     and placed him on the roll of patriots. And the public mind took\r\n     the belief that they were to act together in future, and that a\r\n     cabinet appointment or a high mission would be the reward of his\r\n     patriotic service. It was a crisis in the life of Mr. Webster. He\r\n     stood in public opposition to Mr. Clay and Mr. Calhoun. With Mr.\r\n     Clay he had a public outbreak in the Senate. He was cordial with\r\n     Jackson. The mass of his party stood by him on the proclamation. He\r\n     was at a point from which a new departure might be taken: one at\r\n     which he could not stand still; from which there must be either\r\n     advance or recoil. It was a case in which _will_ more than\r\n     _intellect_ was to rule. He was above Mr. Clay and Mr. Calhoun in\r\n     intellect, below them in will: and he was soon seen cooperating\r\n     with them (Mr. Clay in the lead) in the great measure condemning\r\n     President Jackson.\"\r\n\r\nThis is of course the view of a Jacksonian leader, but it is none the less\r\nfull of keen analysis and comprehension of Mr. Webster, and in some\r\nrespects embodies very well the conditions of the situation. Mr. Benton\r\nnaturally did not see that an alliance with Jackson was utterly impossible\r\nfor Mr. Webster, whose proper course was therefore much less simple than it\r\nappeared to the Senator from Missouri. There was in reality no common\r\nground possible between Webster and Jackson except defence of the national\r\nintegrity. Mr. Webster was a great orator, a splendid advocate, a trained\r\nstatesman and economist, a remarkable constitutional lawyer, and a man of\r\nimmense dignity, not headstrong in temper and without peculiar force of\r\nwill. Jackson, on the other hand, was a rude soldier, unlettered,\r\nintractable, arbitrary, with a violent temper and a most despotic will. Two\r\nmen more utterly incompatible it would have been difficult to find, and\r\nnothing could have been more wildly fantastic than to suppose an alliance\r\nbetween them, or to imagine that Mr. Webster could ever have done anything\r\nbut oppose utterly those mad gyrations of personal government which the\r\nPresident called his \"policy.\"\r\n\r\nYet at the same time it is perfectly true that just after the passage of\r\nthe tariff bill Mr. Webster was at a great crisis in his life. He could not\r\nact with Jackson. That way was shut to him by nature, if by nothing else.\r\nBut he could have maintained his position as the independent and unbending\r\ndefender of nationality and as the foe of compromise. He might then have\r\nbrought Mr. Clay to his side, and remained himself the undisputed head of\r\nthe Whig party. The coalition between Clay and Calhoun was a hollow,\r\nill-omened thing, certain to go violently to pieces, as, in fact, it did,\r\nwithin a few years, and then Mr. Clay, if he had held out so long, would\r\nhave been helpless without Mr. Webster. But such a course required a very\r\nstrong will and great tenacity of purpose, and it was on this side that Mr.\r\nWebster was weak, as Mr. Benton points out. Instead of waiting for Mr. Clay\r\nto come to him, Mr. Webster went over to Clay and Calhoun, and formed for a\r\ntime the third in that ill-assorted partnership. There was no reason for\r\nhis doing so. In fact every good reason was against it. Mr. Clay had come\r\nto Mr. Webster with his compromise, and had been met with the reply \"that\r\nit would be yielding great principles to faction; and that the time had\r\ncome to test the strength of the Constitution and the government.\" This was\r\na brave, manly answer, but Mr. Clay, nationalist as he was, had straightway\r\ndeserted his friend and ally, and gone over to the separatists for support.\r\nThen a sharp contest had occurred between Mr. Webster and Mr. Clay in the\r\ndebate on the tariff; and when it was all over, the latter wrote with frank\r\nvanity and a slight tinge of contempt: \"Mr. Webster and I came in\r\nconflict, and I have the satisfaction to tell you that he gained nothing.\r\nMy friends flatter me with my having completely triumphed. There is no\r\npermanent breach between us. I think he begins already to repent his\r\ncourse.\" Mr. Clay was intensely national, but his theory of preserving the\r\nUnion was by continual compromise, or, in other words, by constant yielding\r\nto the aggressive South. Mr. Webster's plan was to maintain a firm\r\nattitude, enforce absolute submission to all constitutional laws, and prove\r\nthat agitation against the Union could lead only to defeat. This policy\r\nwould not have resulted in rebellion, but, if it had, the hanging of\r\nCalhoun and a few like him, and the military government of South Carolina,\r\nby the hero of New Orleans, would have taught slave-holders such a lesson\r\nthat we should probably have been spared four years of civil war. Peaceful\r\nsubmission, however, would have been the sure outcome of Mr. Webster's\r\npolicy. But a compromise appealed as it always does to the timid,\r\nbalance-of-power party. Mr. Clay prevailed, and the manufacturers of New\r\nEngland, as well as elsewhere, finding that he had secured for them the\r\nbenefit of time and of the chapter of accidents, rapidly came over to his\r\nsupport. The pressure was too much for Mr. Webster. Mr. Clay thought that\r\nif Mr. Webster \"had to go over the work of the last few weeks he would have\r\nbeen for the compromise, which commands the approbation of a great\r\nmajority.\" Whether Mr. Webster repented his opposition to the compromise no\r\none can say, but the change of opinion in New England, the general assent\r\nof the Whig party, and the dazzling temptations of presidential candidacy\r\nprevailed with him. He fell in behind Mr. Clay, and remained there in a\r\nparty sense and as a party man for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nThe terrible prize of the presidency was indeed again before his eyes. Mr.\r\nClay's overthrow at the previous election had removed him, for the time\r\nbeing at least, from the list of candidates, and thus freed Mr. Webster\r\nfrom his most dangerous rival. In the summer of 1833 Mr. Webster made a\r\ntour through the Western States, and was received everywhere with\r\nenthusiasm, and hailed as the great expounder and defender of the\r\nConstitution. The following winter he stood forward as the preëminent\r\nchampion of the Bank against the President. Everything seemed to point to\r\nhim as the natural candidate of the opposition. The Legislature of\r\nMassachusetts nominated him for the presidency, and he himself deeply\r\ndesired the office, for the fever now burned strongly within him. But the\r\nmovement came to nothing. The anti-masonic schism still distracted the\r\nopposition. The Kentucky leaders were jealous of Mr. Webster, and thought\r\nhim \"no such man\" as their idol Henry Clay. They admitted his greatness and\r\nhis high traits of character, but they thought his ambition mixed with too\r\nmuch self-love. Governor Letcher wrote to Mr. Crittenden in 1836 that Clay\r\nwas more elevated, disinterested and patriotic than Webster, and that the\r\nverdict of the country had had a good effect on the latter. Despite the\r\ninterest and enthusiasm which Mr. Webster aroused in the West, he had no\r\nreal hold upon that section or upon the masses of the people and the\r\nWestern Whigs turned to Harrison. There was no hope in 1836 for Mr.\r\nWebster, or, for that matter, for his party either. He received the\r\nelectoral vote of faithful Massachusetts, and that was all. As it was then,\r\nso it had been at the previous election, and so it was to continue to be at\r\nthe end of every presidential term. There never was a moment when Mr.\r\nWebster had any real prospect of attaining to the presidency. Unfortunately\r\nhe never could realize this. He would have been more than human, perhaps,\r\nif he had done so. The tempting bait hung always before his eyes. The prize\r\nseemed to be always just coming within his reach, and was really never near\r\nit. But the longing had entered his soul. He could not rid himself of the\r\nidea of this final culmination to his success; and it warped his feelings\r\nand actions, injured his career, and embittered his last years.\r\n\r\nThis notice of the presidential election of 1836 has somewhat anticipated\r\nthe course of events. Soon after the tariff compromise had been effected,\r\nMr. Webster renewed his relations with Mr. Clay, and, consequently, with\r\nMr. Calhoun, and their redoutable antagonist in the President's chair soon\r\ngave them enough to do. The most immediate obstacle to Mr. Webster's\r\nalliance with General Jackson was the latter's attitude in regard to the\r\nbank. Mr. Webster had become satisfied that the bank was, on the whole, a\r\nuseful and even necessary institution. No one was better fitted than he to\r\ndecide on such a question, and few persons would now be found to differ\r\nfrom his judgment on this point. In a general way he may be said to have\r\nadopted the Hamiltonian doctrine in regard to the expediency and\r\nconstitutionality of a national bank. There were intimations in the spring\r\nof 1833 that the President, not content with preventing the re-charter of\r\nthe bank, was planning to strike it down, and practically deprive it of\r\neven the three years of life which still remained to it by law. The scheme\r\nwas perfected during the summer, and, after changing his Secretary of the\r\nTreasury until he got one who would obey, President Jackson dealt his great\r\nblow. On September 26 Mr. Taney signed the order removing the deposits of\r\nthe government from the Bank of the United States. The result was an\r\nimmediate contraction of loans, commercial distress, and great confusion.\r\n\r\nThe President had thrown down the gage, and the leaders of the opposition\r\nwere not slow to take it up. Mr. Clay opened the battle by introducing two\r\nresolutions,--one condemning the action of the President as\r\nunconstitutional, the other attacking the policy of removal, and a long and\r\nbitter debate ensued. A month later, Mr. Webster came forward with\r\nresolutions from Boston against the course of the President. He presented\r\nthe resolutions in a powerful and effective speech, depicting the\r\ndeplorable condition of business, and the injury caused to the country by\r\nthe removal of the deposits. He rejected the idea of leaving the currency\r\nto the control of the President, or of doing away entirely with paper, and\r\nadvocated the re-charter of the present bank, or the creation of a new one;\r\nand, until the time for that should arrive, the return of the deposits,\r\nwith its consequent relief to business and a restoration of stability and\r\nof confidence for the time being at least. He soon found that the\r\nadministration had determined that no law should be passed, and that the\r\ndoctrine that Congress had no power to establish a bank should be upheld.\r\nHe also discovered that the constitutional pundit in the White House, who\r\nwas so opposed to a single national bank, had created, by his own fiat, a\r\nlarge number of small national banks in the guise of state banks, to which\r\nthe public deposits were committed, and the collection of the public\r\nrevenues intrusted. Such an arbitrary policy, at once so ignorant,\r\nillogical, and dangerous, aroused Mr. Webster thoroughly, and he entered\r\nimmediately upon an active campaign against the President. Between the\r\npresentation of the Boston resolutions and the close of the session he\r\nspoke on the bank, and the subjects necessarily connected with it, no less\r\nthan sixty-four times. He dealt entirely with financial topics,--chiefly\r\nthose relating to the currency, and with the constitutional questions\r\nraised by the extension of the executive authority. This long series of\r\nspeeches is one of the most remarkable exhibitions of intellectual power\r\never made by Mr. Webster, or indeed by any public man in our history. In\r\ndiscussing one subject in all its bearings, involving of necessity a\r\ncertain amount of repetition, he not only displayed an extraordinary grasp\r\nof complicated financial problems and a wide knowledge of their scientific\r\nmeaning and history, but he showed an astonishing fertility in argument,\r\ncoupled with great variety and clearness of statement and cogency of\r\nreasoning. With the exception of Hamilton, Mr. Webster is the only\r\nstatesman in our history who was capable of such a performance on such a\r\nsubject, when a thorough knowledge had to be united with all the resources\r\nof debate and all the arts of the highest eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe most important speech of all was that delivered in answer to Jackson's\r\n\"Protest,\" sent in as a reply to Mr. Clay's resolutions which had been\r\nsustained by Mr. Webster as chairman of the Committee on Finance. The\r\n\"Protest\" asserted, in brief, that the Legislature could not order a\r\nsubordinate officer to perform certain duties free from the control of the\r\nPresident; that the President had the right to put his own conception of\r\nthe law into execution; and, if the subordinate officer refused to obey,\r\nthen to remove such officer; and that the Senate had therefore no right to\r\ncensure his removal of the Secretary of the Treasury, in order to reach the\r\ngovernment deposits. To this doctrine Mr. Webster replied with great\r\nelaboration and ability. The question was a very nice one. There could be\r\nno doubt of the President's power of removal, and it was necessary to show\r\nthat this power did not extend to the point of depriving Congress of the\r\nright to confer by law specified and independent powers upon an inferior\r\nofficer, or of regulating the tenure of office. To establish this\r\nproposition, in such a way as to take it out of the thick and heated\r\natmosphere of personal controversy, and put it in a shape to carry\r\nconviction to the popular understanding, was a delicate and difficult task,\r\nrequiring, in the highest degree, lucidity and ingenuity of argument. It is\r\nnot too high praise to say that Mr. Webster succeeded entirely. The real\r\ncontest was for the possession of that debatable ground which lies between\r\nthe defined limits of the executive and legislative departments. The\r\nstruggle consolidated and gave coherence to the Whig party as representing\r\nthe opposition to executive encroachments. At the time Jackson, by his\r\nimperious will and marvellous personal popularity, prevailed and obtained\r\nthe acceptance of his doctrines. But the conflict has gone on, and the\r\nbalance of advantage now rests with the Legislature. This tendency is quite\r\nas dangerous as that of which Jackson was the exponent, if not more so. The\r\nexecutive department has been crippled; and the influence and power of\r\nCongress, and especially of the Senate, have become far greater than they\r\nshould be, under the system of proportion and balance embodied in the\r\nConstitution. Despite Jackson's victory there is, to-day, far more danger\r\nof undue encroachments on the part of the Senate than on that of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nAt the next session the principal subject of discussion was the trouble\r\nwith France. Irritated at the neglect of the French government to provide\r\nfunds for the payment of their debt to us, Jackson sent in a message\r\nseverely criticising them, and recommending the passage of a law\r\nauthorizing reprisals on French property. The President and his immediate\r\nfollowers were eager for war, Calhoun and his faction regarded the whole\r\nquestion as only matter for \"an action of assumpsit,\" while Mr. Webster and\r\nMr. Clay desired to avoid hostilities, but wished the country to maintain a\r\nfirm and dignified attitude. Under the lead of Mr. Clay, the recommendation\r\nof reprisals was rejected, and under that of Mr. Webster a clause smuggled\r\ninto the Fortification Bill to give the President three millions to spend\r\nas he liked was struck out and the bill was subsequently lost. This affair,\r\nwhich brought us to the verge of war with France, soon blew over, however,\r\nand caused only a temporary ripple, although Mr. Webster's attack on the\r\nFortification Bill left a sting behind.\r\n\r\nIn this same session Mr. Webster made an exhaustive speech on the question\r\nof executive patronage and the President's power of appointment and\r\nremoval. He now went much farther than in his answer to the \"Protest,\"\r\nasserting not only the right of Congress to fix the tenure of office, but\r\nalso that the power of removal, like the power of appointment, was in the\r\nPresident and Senate jointly. The speech contained much that was valuable,\r\nbut in its main doctrine was radically unsound. The construction of 1789,\r\nwhich decided that the power of removal belonged to the President alone,\r\nwas clearly right, and Mr. Webster failed to overthrow it. His theory,\r\nembodied in a bill which provided that the President should state to the\r\nSenate, when he appointed to a vacancy caused by removal, his reasons for\r\nsuch removal, was thoroughly mischievous. It was more dangerous than\r\nJackson's doctrine, for it tended to take the power of patronage still more\r\nfrom a single and responsible person and vest it in a large and therefore\r\nwholly irresponsible body which has always been too much inclined to\r\ndegenerate into an office-broking oligarchy, and thus degrade its high and\r\nimportant functions. Mr. Webster argued his proposition with his usual\r\nforce and perspicuity, but the speech is strongly partisan and exhibits the\r\ndisposition of an advocate to fit the Constitution to his particular case,\r\ninstead of dealing with it on general and fundamental principles.\r\n\r\nThe session closed with a resolution offered by Mr. Benton to expunge the\r\nresolutions of censure upon the President, which was overwhelmingly\r\ndefeated, and was then laid upon the table, on the motion of Mr. Webster.\r\nHe also took the first step to prevent the impending financial disaster\r\ngrowing out of the President's course toward the bank, by carrying a bill\r\nto stop the payment of treasury warrants by the deposit banks in current\r\nbanknotes, and to compel their payment in gold and silver. The rejection of\r\nBenton's resolutions served to embitter the already intense conflict\r\nbetween the President and his antagonists, and Mr. Webster's bill, while it\r\nshowed the wisdom of the opposition, was powerless to remedy the mischief\r\nwhich was afoot.\r\n\r\nIn this same year (1835) the independence of Texas was achieved, and in the\r\nsession of 1835-36 the slavery agitation began its march, which was only to\r\nterminate on the field of battle and in the midst of contending armies.\r\nMr. Webster's action at this time in regard to this great question, which\r\nwas destined to have such an effect upon his career, can be more fitly\r\nnarrated when we come to consider his whole course in regard to slavery in\r\nconnection with the \"7th of March\" speech. The other matters of this\r\nsession demand but a brief notice. The President animadverted in his\r\nmessage upon the loss of the Fortification Bill, due to the defeat of the\r\nthree million clause. Mr. Webster defended himself most conclusively and\r\neffectively, and before the session closed the difficulties with France\r\nwere practically settled. He also gave great attention to the ever-pressing\r\nfinancial question, trying to mitigate the evils which the rapid\r\naccumulation of the public funds was threatening to produce. He felt that\r\nhe was powerless, that nothing indeed could be done to avert the\r\napproaching disaster; but he struggled to modify its effects and delay its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nComplications increased rapidly during the summer. The famous \"Specie\r\nCircular,\" issued by the Secretary of the Treasury without authority of\r\nlaw, weakened all banks which did not hold the government deposits, forced\r\nthem to contract their loans, and completed the derangement of domestic\r\nexchange. This grave condition of affairs confronted Congress when it\r\nassembled in December, 1836. A resolution was introduced to rescind the\r\nSpecie Circular, and Mr. Webster spoke at length in the debate, defining\r\nthe constitutional duties of the government toward the regulation of the\r\ncurrency, and discussing in a masterly manner the intricate questions of\r\ndomestic exchanges and the excessive circulation of bank notes. On another\r\noccasion he reiterated his belief that a national bank was the true remedy\r\nfor existing ills, but that only hard experience could convince the country\r\nof its necessity.\r\n\r\nAt this session the resolution to expunge the vote of censure of 1833 was\r\nagain brought forward by Mr. Benton. The Senate had at last come under the\r\nsway of the President, and it was clear that the resolution would pass.\r\nThis precious scheme belongs to the same category of absurdities as the\r\nplacing Oliver Cromwell's skull on Temple Bar, and throwing Robert Blake's\r\nbody on a dung-hill by Charles Stuart and his friends. It was not such a\r\nmean and cowardly performance as that of the heroes of the Restoration, but\r\nit was far more \"childish-foolish.\" The miserable and ludicrous nature of\r\nsuch a proceeding disgusted Mr. Webster beyond measure. Before the vote was\r\ntaken he made a brief speech that is a perfect model of dignified and\r\nsevere protest against a silly outrage upon the Constitution and upon the\r\nrights of senators, which he was totally unable to prevent. The original\r\ncensure is part of history. No \"black lines\" can take it out. The expunging\r\nresolution, which Mr. Curtis justly calls \"fantastic and theatrical,\" is\r\nalso part of history, and carries with it the ineffaceable stigma affixed\r\nby Mr. Webster's indignant protest.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the session Mr. Webster made up his mind to resign his\r\nseat in the Senate. He had private interests which demanded his attention,\r\nand he wished to travel both in the United States and in Europe. He may\r\nwell have thought, also, that he could add nothing to his fame by remaining\r\nlonger in the Senate. But besides the natural craving for rest, it is quite\r\npossible that he believed that a withdrawal from active and official\r\nparticipation in politics was the best preparation for a successful\r\ncandidacy for the presidency in 1840. This certainly was in his mind in the\r\nfollowing year (1838), when the rumor was abroad that he was again\r\ncontemplating retirement from the Senate; and it is highly probable that\r\nthe same motive was at bottom the controlling one in 1837. But whatever the\r\ncause of his wish to resign, the opposition of his friends everywhere, and\r\nof the Legislature of Massachusetts, formally and strongly expressed, led\r\nhim to forego his purpose. He consented to hold his seat for the present,\r\nat least, and in the summer of 1837 made an extended tour through the West,\r\nwhere he was received as before with the greatest admiration and\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe distracted condition of the still inchoate Whig party in 1836, and the\r\nextraordinary popularity of Jackson, resulted in the complete victory of\r\nMr. Van Buren. But the General's chosen successor and political heir found\r\nthe great office to which he had been called, and which he so eagerly\r\ndesired, anything but a bed of roses. The ruin which Jackson's wild policy\r\nhad prepared was close at hand, and three months after the inauguration the\r\nstorm burst with full fury. The banks suspended specie payments and\r\nuniversal bankruptcy reigned throughout the country. Our business interests\r\nwere in the violent throes of the worst financial panic which had ever been\r\nknown in the United States. The history of Mr. Van Buren's administration,\r\nin its main features, is that of a vain struggle with a hopeless network of\r\ndifficulties, and with the misfortune and prostration which grew out of\r\nthis wide-spread disaster. It is not necessary here to enter into the\r\ndetails of these events. Mr. Webster devoted himself in the Senate to\r\nmaking every effort to mitigate the evils which he had prophesied, and to\r\nprevent their aggravation by further injudicious legislation. His most\r\nimportant speech was delivered at the special session against the first\r\nsub-treasury bill and Mr. Calhoun's amendment. Mr. Calhoun, who had wept\r\nover the defeat of the bank bill in 1815, was now convinced that all banks\r\nwere mistakes, and wished to prevent the acceptance of the notes of specie\r\npaying banks for government dues. Mr. Webster's speech was the fullest and\r\nmost elaborate he ever made on the subject of the currency, and the\r\nrelations of the government to it. His theme was the duty and right of the\r\ngeneral government under the Constitution to regulate and control the\r\ncurrency, and his masterly argument was the best that has ever been made,\r\nleaving in fact nothing to be desired.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1839 there was talk of sending Mr. Webster to London as\r\ncommissioner to settle the boundary disputes, but it came to nothing, and\r\nin the following summer he went to England in his private capacity\r\naccompanied by his family. The visit was in every way successful. It\r\nbrought rest and change as well as pleasure, and was full of interest. Mr.\r\nWebster was very well received, much attention was paid him, and much\r\nadmiration shown for him. He commanded all this, not only by his\r\nappearance, his reputation, and his intellectual force, but still more by\r\nthe fact that he was thoroughly and genuinely American in thought, feeling,\r\nand manner.\r\n\r\nHe reached New York on his return at the end of December, and was there met\r\nby the news of General Harrison's nomination by the Whigs. In the previous\r\nyear it had seemed as if, with Clay out of the way by the defeat of 1832,\r\nand Harrison by that of 1836, the great prize must fall to Mr. Webster. His\r\nname was brought forward by the Whigs of Massachusetts, but it met with no\r\nresponse even in New England. It was the old story; Mr. Clay and his\r\nfriends were cool, and the masses of the party did not desire Mr. Webster.\r\nThe convention turned from the Massachusetts statesman and again nominated\r\nthe old Western soldier.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster did not hesitate as to the course he should pursue upon his\r\nreturn. He had been reëlected to the Senate in January, 1839, and after the\r\nsession closed in July, 1840, he threw himself into the campaign in support\r\nof Harrison. The people did not desire Mr. Webster to be their President,\r\nbut there was no one whom they so much wished to hear. He was besieged from\r\nall parts of the country with invitations to speak, and he answered\r\ngenerously to the call thus made upon him.\r\n\r\nOn his way home from Washington, in March, 1837, more than three years\r\nbefore, he had made a speech at Niblo's Garden in New York,--the greatest\r\npurely political speech which he ever delivered. He then reviewed and\r\narraigned with the greatest severity the history of Jackson's\r\nadministration, abstaining in his characteristic way from all personal\r\nattack, but showing, as no one else could show, what had been done, and the\r\nresults of the policy, which were developing as he had predicted. He also\r\nsaid that the worst was yet to come. The speech produced a profound\r\nimpression. People were still reading it when the worst really came, and\r\nthe great panic broke over the country. Mr. Webster had, in fact, struck\r\nthe key-note of the coming campaign in the Niblo-Garden speech of 1837. In\r\nthe summer of 1840 he spoke in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and\r\nVirginia, and was almost continually upon the platform. The great feat of\r\n1833-34, when he made sixty-four speeches in the Senate on the bank\r\nquestion, was now repeated under much more difficult conditions. In the\r\nfirst instance he was addressing a small and select body of trained\r\nlisteners, all more or less familiar with the subject. In 1840 he was\r\nobliged to present these same topics, with all their infinite detail and\r\ninherent dryness, to vast popular audiences, but nevertheless he achieved a\r\nmarvellous success. The chief points which he brought out were the\r\ncondition of the currency, the need of government regulation, the\r\nresponsibility of the Democrats, the miserable condition of the country,\r\nand the exact fulfillment of the prophecies he had made. The argument and\r\nthe conclusion were alike irresistible, but Mr. Webster showed, in handling\r\nhis subject, not only the variety, richness, and force which he had\r\ndisplayed in the Senate, but the capacity of presenting it in a way\r\nthoroughly adapted to the popular mind, and yet, at the same time, of\r\npreserving the impressive tone of a dignified statesman, without any\r\ndegeneration into mere stump oratory. This wonderful series of speeches\r\nproduced the greatest possible effect. They were heard by thousands and\r\nread by tens of thousands. They fell, of course, upon willing ears. The\r\npeople, smarting under bankruptcy, poverty, and business depression, were\r\nwild for a change; but nothing did so much to swell the volume of public\r\nresentment against the policy of the ruling party as these speeches of Mr.\r\nWebster, which gave character and form to the whole movement. Jackson had\r\nsown the wind, and his unlucky successor was engaged in the agreeable task\r\nof reaping the proverbial crop. There was a political revolution. The Whigs\r\nswept the country by an immense majority, the great Democratic party was\r\ncrushed to the earth, and the ignorant misgovernment of Andrew Jackson\r\nfound at last its fit reward. General Harrison, as soon as he was elected,\r\nturned to the two great chiefs of his party to invite them to become the\r\npillars of his administration. Mr. Clay declined any cabinet office, but\r\nMr. Webster, after some hesitation, accepted the secretaryship of state. He\r\nresigned his seat in the Senate February 22, 1841, and on March 4 following\r\ntook his place in the cabinet, and entered upon a new field of public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF STATE.--THE ASHBURTON TREATY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one feature in the history, or rather in the historic scenery of\r\nthis period, which we are apt to overlook. The political questions, the\r\ndebates, the eloquence of that day, give us no idea of the city in which\r\nthe history was made, or of the life led by the men who figured in that\r\nhistory. Their speeches might have been delivered in any great centre of\r\ncivilization, and in the midst of a brilliant and luxurious society. But\r\nthe Washington of 1841, when Mr. Webster took the post which is officially\r\nthe first in the society of the capital and of the country, was a very odd\r\nsort of place, and widely different from what it is to-day. It was not a\r\nvillage, neither was it a city. It had not grown, but had been created for\r\na special purpose. A site had been arbitrarily selected, and a city laid\r\nout on the most magnificent scale. But there was no independent life, for\r\nthe city was wholly official in its purposes and its existence. There were\r\na few great public buildings, a few large private houses, a few hotels and\r\nboarding houses, and a large number of negro shanties. The general effect\r\nwas of attempted splendor, which had resulted in slovenliness and\r\nstraggling confusion. The streets were unpaved, dusty in summer, and deep\r\nwith mud in winter, so that the mere difficulty of getting from place to\r\nplace was a serious obstacle to general society. Cattle fed in the streets,\r\nand were milked by their owners on the sidewalk. There was a grotesque\r\ncontrast between the stately capitol where momentous questions were\r\neloquently discussed and such queerly primitive and rude surroundings. Few\r\npersons were able to entertain because few persons had suitable houses.\r\nMembers of Congress usually clubbed together and took possession of a\r\nhouse, and these \"messes,\" as they were called,--although without doubt\r\nvery agreeable to their members,--did not offer a mode of life which was\r\neasily compatible with the demands of general society. Social enjoyments,\r\ntherefore, were pursued under difficulties; and the city, although\r\nimproving, was dreary enough.\r\n\r\nSociety, too, was in a bad condition. The old forms and ceremonies of the\r\nmen of 1789 and the manners and breeding of our earliest generation of\r\nstatesmen had passed away, and the new democracy had not as yet a system of\r\nits own. It was a period of transition. The old customs had gone, the new\r\nones had not crystallized. The civilization was crude and raw, and in\r\nWashington had no background whatever,--such as was to be found in the old\r\ncities and towns of the original thirteen States. The tone of the men in\r\npublic life had deteriorated and was growing worse, approaching rapidly its\r\nlowest point, which it reached during the Polk administration. This was due\r\npartly to the Jacksonian democracy, which had rejected training and\r\neducation as necessary to statesmanship, and had loudly proclaimed the\r\ngreat truths of rotation in office, and the spoils to the victors, and\r\npartly to the slavery agitation which was then beginning to make itself\r\nfelt. The rise of the irrepressible conflict between freedom and slavery\r\nmade the South overbearing and truculent; it produced that class of\r\npoliticians known as \"Northern men with Southern principles,\" or, in the\r\nslang of the day, as \"doughfaces;\" and it had not yet built up a strong,\r\nvigorous, and aggressive party in the North. The lack of proper social\r\nopportunities, and this deterioration among men in public life, led to an\r\nincreasing violence and roughness in debate, and to a good deal of coarse\r\ndissipation in private. There was undoubtedly a brighter side, but it was\r\nlimited, and the surroundings of the distinguished men who led our\r\npolitical parties in 1841 at the national capital, do not present a very\r\ncheerful or attractive picture.\r\n\r\nWhen the new President appeared upon the scene he was followed by a general\r\nrush of hungry office-seekers, who had been starving for places for many\r\nyears. General Harrison was a brave, honest soldier and pioneer, simple in\r\nheart and manners, unspoiled and untaught by politics of which he had had a\r\ngood share. He was not a great man, but he was honorable and well\r\nintentioned. He wished to have about him the best and ablest men of his\r\nparty, and to trust to their guidance for a successful administration. But\r\nalthough he had no desire to invent a policy, or to draft state papers, he\r\nwas determined to be the author of his own inaugural speech, and he came to\r\nWashington with a carefully-prepared manuscript in his pocket. When Mr.\r\nWebster read this document he found it full of gratitude to the people, and\r\nabounding in allusions to Roman history. With his strong sense of humor,\r\nand of the unities and proprieties as well, he was a good deal alarmed at\r\nthe proposed speech; and after much labor, and the expenditure of a good\r\ndeal of tact, he succeeded in effecting some important changes and\r\nadditions. When he came home in the evening, Mrs. Seaton, at whose house he\r\nwas staying, remarked that he looked worried and fatigued, and asked if\r\nanything had happened. Mr. Webster replied, \"You would think that something\r\nhad happened if you knew what I have done. I have killed seventeen Roman\r\nproconsuls.\" It was a terrible slaughter for poor Harrison, for the\r\nproconsuls were probably very dear to his heart. His youth had been passed\r\nin the time when the pseudo classicism of the French Republic and Empire\r\nwas rampant, and now that, in his old age, he had been raised to the\r\npresidency, his head was probably full of the republics of antiquity, and\r\nof Cincinnatus called from the plough, to take the helm of state.\r\n\r\nM. de Bacourt, the French minister at this period, a rather shallow and\r\nilliberal man who disliked Mr. Webster, gives, in his recently published\r\ncorrespondence, the following amusing account of the presentation of the\r\ndiplomatic corps to President Harrison,--a little bit of contemporary\r\ngossip which carries us back to those days better than anything else could\r\npossibly do. The diplomatic corps assembled at the house of Mr. Fox, the\r\nBritish minister, who was to read a speech in behalf of the whole body, and\r\nthence proceeded to the White House where\r\n\r\n     \"the new Secretary of State, Mr. Webster, who is much embarrassed\r\n     by his new functions, came to make his arrangements with Mr. Fox.\r\n     This done, we were ranged along the wall in order of seniority, and\r\n     after too long a delay for a country where the chief magistrate has\r\n     no right to keep people waiting, the old General came in, followed\r\n     by all the members of his Cabinet, who walked in single file, and\r\n     so kept behind him. He then advanced toward Mr. Fox, whom Mr.\r\n     Webster presented to him. Mr. Fox read to him his address. Then the\r\n     President took out his spectacles and read his reply. Then, after\r\n     having shaken hands with the English minister, he walked from one\r\n     end of our line to the other, Mr. Webster presenting each of us by\r\n     name, and he shaking hands with each one without saying a word.\r\n     This ceremony finished he returned to the room whence he had come,\r\n     and reappeared with Mrs. Harrison--the widow of his eldest\r\n     son--upon his arm, whom he presented to the diplomatic corps _en\r\n     masse_. Mr. Webster, who followed, then presented to us Mrs.\r\n     Finley, the mother of this Mrs. Harrison, in the following terms:\r\n     'Gentlemen, I introduce to you Mrs. Finley, the lady who attends\r\n     Mrs. Harrison;' and observe that this good lady who attends the\r\n     others--takes care of them--is blind. Then all at once, a crowd of\r\n     people rushed into the room. They were the wives, sisters,\r\n     daughters, cousins, and lady friends of the President and of all\r\n     his ministers, who were presented to us, and _vice versa_, in the\r\n     midst of an inconceivable confusion.\"\r\n\r\nFond, however, as Mr. Webster was of society, and punctilious as he was in\r\nmatters of etiquette and propriety, M. de Bacourt to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding, he had far more important duties to perform than those of\r\nplaying host and receiving foreign ministers. Our relations with England\r\nwhen he entered the cabinet were such as to make war seem almost\r\ninevitable. The northeastern boundary, undetermined by the treaty of 1783,\r\nhad been the subject of continual and fruitless negotiation ever since that\r\ntime, and was still unsettled and more complicated than ever. It was agreed\r\nthat there should be a new survey and a new arbitration, but no agreement\r\ncould be reached as to who should arbitrate or what questions should be\r\nsubmitted to the arbitrators, and the temporary arrangements for the\r\npossession of the territory in dispute were unsatisfactory and precarious.\r\nMuch more exciting and perilous than this old difficulty was a new one and\r\nits consequences growing out of the Canadian rebellion in 1837. Certain of\r\nthe rebels fled to the United States, and there, in conjunction with\r\nAmerican citizens, prepared to make incursions into Canada. For this\r\npurpose they fitted out an American steamboat, the Caroline. An expedition\r\nfrom Canada crossed the Niagara River to the American shore, set fire to\r\nthe Caroline, and let her drift over the Falls. In the fray which occurred,\r\nan American named Durfree was killed. The British government avowed this\r\ninvasion to be a public act and a necessary measure of self-defence; but it\r\nwas a question when Mr. Van Buren went out of office whether this avowal\r\nhad been made in an authentic manner. There was another incident, however,\r\nalso growing out of this affair, even more irritating and threatening than\r\nthe invasion itself. In November, 1840, one Alexander McLeod came from\r\nCanada to New York, where he boasted that he was the slayer of Durfree, and\r\nthereupon was at once arrested on a charge of murder and thrown into\r\nprison. This aroused great anger in England, and the conviction of McLeod\r\nwas all that was needed to cause immediate war. In addition to these\r\ncomplications was the question of the right of search for the impressment\r\nof British seamen and for the suppression of the slave-trade. Our\r\ngovernment was, of course, greatly hampered in action by the rights of\r\nMaine and Massachusetts on the northeastern boundary, and by the fact that\r\nMcLeod was within the jurisdiction and in the power of the New York courts,\r\nand wholly out of reach of those of the United States. The character of the\r\nnational representatives on both sides in London tended, moreover, to\r\naggravate the growing irritation between the two countries. Lord Palmerston\r\nwas sharp and domineering, and Mr. Stevenson, our minister, was by no means\r\nmild or conciliatory. Between them they did what they could to render\r\naccommodation impossible.\r\n\r\nTo evolve a satisfactory and permanent peace from these conditions was the\r\ntask which confronted Mr. Webster, and he was hardly in office before he\r\nreceived a demand from Mr. Fox for the release of McLeod, in which full\r\navowal was made that the burning of the Caroline was a public act. Mr.\r\nWebster determined that the proper method of settling the boundary\r\nquestion, when that subject should be reached, was to agree upon a\r\nconventional and arbitrary line, and that in the mean time the only way to\r\ndispose of McLeod was to get him out of prison, separate him,\r\ndiplomatically speaking, from the affair of the Caroline, and then take\r\nthat up as a distinct matter for negotiation with the British government.\r\nThe difficulty in regard to McLeod was the most pressing, and so to that he\r\ngave his immediate attention. His first step was to instruct the\r\nAttorney-General to proceed to Lockport, where McLeod was imprisoned, and\r\ncommunicate with the counsel for the defence, furnishing them with\r\nauthentic information that the destruction of the Caroline was a public\r\nact, and that therefore McLeod could not be held responsible. He then\r\nreplied to the British minister that McLeod could, of course, be released\r\nonly by judicial process, but he also informed Mr. Fox of the steps which\r\nhad been taken by the administration to assure the prisoner a complete\r\ndefence based on the avowal of the British government that the attack on\r\nthe Caroline was a public act. This threw the responsibility for McLeod,\r\nand for consequent peace or war, where it belonged, on the New York\r\nauthorities, who seemed, however, but little inclined to assist the general\r\ngovernment. McLeod came before the Supreme Court of New York in July, on a\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_, but they refused to release him on the grounds set\r\nforth in Mr. Webster's instructions to the Attorney-General, and he was\r\nremanded for trial in October, which was highly embarrassing to our\r\ngovernment, as it kept this dangerous affair open.\r\n\r\nBut this and all other embarrassments to the Secretary of State sank into\r\ninsignificance beside those caused him by the troubles in his own political\r\nparty. Between the time of the instructions to the Attorney-General and\r\nthat of the letter to Mr. Fox, President Harrison died, after only a month\r\nof office. Mr. Tyler, of whose views but little was known, at once\r\nsucceeded, and made no change in the cabinet of his predecessor. On the\r\nlast day of May, Congress, called in extra session by President Harrison,\r\nconvened. A bill establishing a bank was passed, and Mr. Tyler vetoed it on\r\naccount of constitutional objections to some of its features. The\r\ntriumphant Whigs were filled with wrath at this unlooked-for check. Mr.\r\nClay reflected on the President with great severity in the Senate, the\r\nmembers of the party in the House were very violent in their expressions of\r\ndisapproval, and another measure, known as the \"Fiscal Corporation Act,\"\r\nwas at once prepared. Mr. Webster regarded this state of affairs with great\r\nanxiety and alarm. He said that such a contest, if persisted in, would ruin\r\nthe party and deprive them of the fruits of their victory, besides\r\nimperilling the important foreign policy then just initiated. He strove to\r\nallay the excitement, and resisted the passage of any new bank measure,\r\nmuch as he wished the establishment of such an institution, advising\r\npostponement and delay for the sake of procuring harmony if possible. But\r\nthe party in Congress would not be quieted. They were determined to force\r\nMr. Tyler's hand at all hazards, and while the new bill was pending, Mr.\r\nClay, stung by the taunts of Mr. Buchanan, made a savage attack upon the\r\nPresident. As a natural consequence, the \"Fiscal Corporation\" scheme shared\r\nthe fate of its predecessor. The breach between the President and his party\r\nwas opened irreparably, and four members of the cabinet at once resigned.\r\nMr. Webster was averse to becoming a party to an obvious combination\r\nbetween the Senate and the cabinet to harass the President, and he was\r\ndetermined not to sacrifice the success of his foreign negotiations to a\r\npolitical quarrel. He therefore resolved to remain in the cabinet for the\r\npresent, at least, and, after consulting the Massachusetts delegation in\r\nCongress, who fully approved his course, he announced his decision to the\r\npublic in a letter to the \"National Intelligencer.\" His action soon became\r\nthe subject of much adverse criticism from the Whigs, but at this day no\r\none would question that he was entirely right. It was not such an easy\r\nthing to do, however, as it now appears, for the excitement was running\r\nhigh among the Whigs, and there was great bitterness of feeling toward the\r\nPresident. Mr. Webster behaved in an independent and patriotic manner,\r\nshowing a liberality of spirit, a breadth of view, and a courage of opinion\r\nwhich entitle him to the greatest credit.\r\n\r\nEvents, which had seemed thus far to go steadily against him in his\r\nnegotiations, and which had been supplemented by the attacks of the\r\nopposition in Congress for his alleged interference with the course of\r\njustice in New York, now began to turn in his favor. The news of the\r\nrefusal of the New York court to release McLeod on a _habeas corpus_ had\r\nhardly reached England when the Melbourne ministry was beaten in the House\r\nof Commons, and Sir Robert Peel came in, bringing with him Lord Aberdeen as\r\nthe successor of Lord Palmerston in the department of foreign affairs. The\r\nnew ministry was disposed to be much more peaceful than their predecessors\r\nhad been, and the negotiations at once began to move more smoothly. Great\r\ncare was still necessary to prevent outbreaks on the border, but in October\r\nMcLeod proved an _alibi_ and was acquitted, and thus the most dangerous\r\nelement in our relations with England was removed. Matters were still\r\nfurther improved by the retirement of Mr. Stevenson, whose successor in\r\nLondon was Mr. Everett, eminently conciliatory in disposition and in full\r\nsympathy with the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was now able to turn his undivided attention to the\r\nlong-standing boundary question. His proposition to agree upon a\r\nconventional line had been made known by Mr. Fox to his government, and\r\nsoon afterwards Mr. Everett was informed that Lord Ashburton would be sent\r\nto Washington on a special mission. The selection of an envoy well known\r\nfor his friendly feeling toward the United States, which was also\r\ntraditional with the great banking-house of his family, was in itself a\r\npledge of conciliation and good will. Lord Ashburton reached Washington in\r\nApril, 1842, and the negotiation at once began.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible and needless to give here a detailed account of that\r\nnegotiation. We can only glance briefly at the steps taken by Mr. Webster\r\nand at the results achieved by him. There were many difficulties to be\r\novercome, and in the winter of 1841-42 the case of the Creole added a fresh\r\nand dangerous complication. The Creole was a slave-ship, on which the\r\nnegroes had risen, and, taking possession, had carried her into an English\r\nport in the West Indies, where assistance was refused to the crew, and\r\nwhere the slaves were allowed to go free. This was an act of very doubtful\r\nlegality, it touched both England and the Southern States in a very\r\nsensitive point, and it required all Mr. Webster's tact and judgment to\r\nkeep it out of the negotiation until the main issue had been settled.\r\n\r\nThe principal obstacle in the arrangement of the boundary dispute arose\r\nfrom the interests and the attitude of Massachusetts and Maine. Mr. Webster\r\nobtained with sufficient ease the appointment of commissioners from the\r\nformer State, and, through the agency of Mr. Sparks, who was sent to\r\nAugusta for the purpose, commissioners were also appointed in Maine; but\r\nthese last were instructed to adhere to the line of 1783 as claimed by the\r\nUnited States. Lord Ashburton and Mr. Webster readily agreed that a treaty\r\nmust come from mutual conciliation and compromise; but, after a good deal\r\nof correspondence, it became apparent that the Maine commissioners and the\r\nEnglish envoy could not be brought to an agreement. A dead-lock and\r\nconsequent loss of the treaty were imminent. Mr. Webster then had a long\r\ninterview with Lord Ashburton. By a process of give and take they agreed on\r\na conventional line and on the concession of certain rights, which made a\r\nfair bargain, but unluckily the loss was suffered by Maine and\r\nMassachusetts, while the benefits received by the United States accrued to\r\nNew York, Vermont, and New Hampshire. This brought the negotiators to the\r\npoint at which they had already been forced to halt so many times before.\r\nMr. Webster now cut the knot by proposing that the United States should\r\nindemnify Maine and Massachusetts in money for the loss they were to suffer\r\nin territory, and by his dexterous management the commissioners of the two\r\nStates were persuaded to assent to this arrangement, while Lord Ashburton\r\nwas induced to admit the agreement into a clause of the treaty. This\r\ndisposed of the chief question in dispute, but two other subjects were\r\nincluded in the treaty besides the boundary. The first related to the\r\nright of search claimed by England for the suppression of the slave-trade.\r\nThis was met by what was called the \"Cruising Convention,\" a clause which\r\nstipulated that each nation should keep its own squadron on the coast of\r\nAfrica, to enforce separately its own laws against the slave-trade, but in\r\nmutual coöperation. The other subject of agreement grew out of the Creole\r\ncase. England supposed that we sought the return of the negroes because\r\nthey were slaves, but Mr. Webster argued that they were demanded as\r\nmutineers and murderers. The result was an article which, while it\r\ncarefully avoided even the appearance of an attempt to bind England to\r\nreturn fugitive slaves, provided amply for the extradition of criminals.\r\nThe case of the Caroline was disposed of by a formal admission of the\r\ninviolability of national territory and by an apology for the burning of\r\nthe steamboat. As to the action in regard to the slaves on the Creole, Mr.\r\nWebster could only obtain the assurance that there should be \"no officious\r\ninterference with American vessels driven by accident or violence into\r\nBritish ports,\" and with this he was content to let the matter drop. On the\r\nsubject of impressment, the old _casus belli_ of 1812, Mr. Webster wrote a\r\nforcible letter to Lord Ashburton. In it he said that, in future, \"in every\r\nregularly-documented American merchant vessel, the crew who navigate it\r\nwill find their protection in the flag which is over them.\" In other words,\r\nif you take sailors out of our vessels, we shall fight; and this simple\r\nstatement of fact ended the whole matter and was quite as binding on\r\nEngland as any treaty could have been.\r\n\r\nThus the negotiation closed. The only serious objection to its results was\r\nthat the interests of Maine were sacrificed perhaps unduly,--as a recent\r\ndiscussion of that point seems to show. But such a sacrifice was fully\r\njustified by what was achieved. A war was averted, a long standing and\r\nmenacing dispute was settled, and a treaty was concluded which was\r\ncreditable and honorable to all concerned. By his successful introduction\r\nof the extradition clause, Mr. Webster rendered a great service to\r\ncivilization and to the suppression and punishment of crime. Mr. Webster\r\nwas greatly aided throughout--both in his arguments, and in the\r\nconstruction of the treaty itself--by the learned and valuable assistance\r\nfreely given by Judge Story. But he conducted the whole negotiation with\r\ngreat ability and in the spirit of a liberal and enlightened statesman. He\r\ndisplayed the highest tact and dexterity in reconciling so many clashing\r\ninterests, and avoiding so many perilous side issues, until he had brought\r\nthe main problem to a solution. In all that he did and said he showed a\r\ndignity and an entire sufficiency, which make this negotiation one of the\r\nmost creditable--so far as its conduct was concerned--in which the United\r\nStates was ever engaged.\r\n\r\nWhile the negotiation was in progress there was a constant murmur among the\r\nWhigs about Mr. Webster's remaining in the cabinet, and as soon as the\r\ntreaty was actually signed a loud clamor began--both among the politicians\r\nand in the newspapers--for his resignation. In the midst of this outcry the\r\nSenate met and ratified the treaty by a vote of thirty-nine to nine,--a\r\ngreat triumph for its author. But the debate disclosed a vigorous\r\nopposition, Benton and Buchanan both assailing Mr. Webster for neglecting\r\nand sacrificing American, and particularly Southern, interests. At the same\r\ntime the controversy which Mr. Webster called \"the battle of the maps,\" and\r\nwhich was made a great deal of in England, began to show itself. A map of\r\n1783, which Mr. Webster obtained, had been discovered in Paris, sustaining\r\nthe English view, while another was afterwards found in London, supporting\r\nthe American claim. Neither was of the least consequence, as the new line\r\nwas conventional and arbitrary; but the discoveries caused a great deal of\r\nunreasonable excitement. Mr. Webster saw very plainly that the treaty was\r\nnot yet secure. It was exposed to attacks both at home and abroad, and had\r\nstill to pass Parliament. Until it was entirely safe, Mr. Webster\r\ndetermined to remain at his post. The clamor continued about his\r\nresignation, and rose round him at his home in Marshfield, whither he had\r\ngone for rest. At the same time the Whig convention of Massachusetts\r\ndeclared formally a complete separation from the President. In the language\r\nof to-day, they \"read Mr. Tyler out of the party.\" There was a variety of\r\nmotives for this action. One was to force Mr. Webster out of the cabinet,\r\nanother to advance the fortunes of Mr. Clay, in favor of whose presidential\r\ncandidacy movements had begun in Massachusetts, even among Mr. Webster's\r\npersonal friends, as well as elsewhere. Mr. Webster had just declined a\r\npublic dinner, but he now decided to meet his friends in Faneuil Hall. An\r\nimmense audience gathered to hear him, many of them strongly disapproving\r\nhis course, but after he had spoken a few moments, he had them completely\r\nunder control. He reviewed the negotiation; he discussed fully the\r\ndifferences in the party; he deplored, and he did not hesitate strongly to\r\ncondemn these quarrels, because by them the fruits of victory were lost,\r\nand Whig policy abandoned. With boldness and dignity he denied the right of\r\nthe convention to declare a separation from the President, and the implied\r\nattempt to coerce himself and others. \"I am, gentlemen, a little hard to\r\ncoax,\" he said, \"but as to being driven, that is out of the question. If I\r\nchoose to remain in the President's councils, do these gentlemen mean to\r\nsay that I cease to be a Massachusetts Whig? I am quite ready to put that\r\nquestion to the people of Massachusetts.\" He was well aware that he was\r\nlosing party strength by his action; he knew that behind all these\r\nresolutions was the intention to raise his great rival to the presidency;\r\nbut he did not shrink from avowing his independence and his intention of\r\ndoing what he believed to be right, and what posterity admits to have been\r\nso. Mr. Webster never appeared to better advantage, and he never made a\r\nmore manly speech than on this occasion, when, without any bravado, he\r\nquietly set the influence and the threats of his party at defiance.\r\n\r\nHe was not mistaken in thinking that the treaty was not yet in smooth\r\nwater. It was again attacked in the Senate, and it had a still more severe\r\nordeal to go through in Parliament. The opposition, headed by Lord\r\nPalmerston, assailed the treaty and Lord Ashburton himself, with the\r\ngreatest virulence, denouncing the one as a capitulation, and the other as\r\na grossly unfit appointment. Moreover, the language of the President's\r\nmessage led England to believe that we claimed that the right of search had\r\nbeen abandoned. After much correspondence, this misunderstanding drew forth\r\nan able letter from Mr. Webster, stating that the right of search had not\r\nbeen included in the treaty, but that the \"cruising convention\" had\r\nrendered the question unimportant. Finally, all complications were\r\ndispersed, and the treaty ratified; and then came an attack from an\r\nunexpected quarter. General Cass--our minister at Paris--undertook to\r\nprotest against the treaty, denounce it, and leave his post on account of\r\nit. This wholly gratuitous assault led to a public correspondence, in which\r\nGeneral Cass, on his own confession, was completely overthrown and broken\r\ndown by the Secretary of State. This was the last difficulty, and the work\r\nwas finally accepted and complete.\r\n\r\nDuring this important and absorbing negotiation, other matters of less\r\nmoment, but still of considerable consequence, had been met by Mr. Webster,\r\nand successfully disposed of. He made a treaty with Portugal, respecting\r\nduties on wines; he carried on a long correspondence with our minister to\r\nMexico in relation to certain American prisoners; he vindicated the course\r\nof the United States in regard to the independence of Texas, teaching M. de\r\nBocanegra, the Mexican Secretary of State, a lesson as to the duties of\r\nneutrality, and administering a severe reproof to that gentleman for\r\nimputing bad faith to the United States; he conducted the correspondence,\r\nand directed the policy of the government in regard to the troubles in\r\nRhode Island; he made an effort to settle the Oregon boundary; and,\r\nfinally, he set on foot the Chinese mission, which, after being offered to\r\nMr. Everett, was accepted by Mr. Cushing with the best results. But his\r\nreal work came to an end with the correspondence with General Cass at the\r\nclose of 1842, and in May of the following year he resigned the\r\nsecretaryship. In the two years during which he had been at the head of the\r\ncabinet, he had done much. His work added to his fame by the ability which\r\nit exhibited in a new field, and has stood the test of time. In a period of\r\ndifficulty, and even danger, he proved himself singularly well adapted for\r\nthe conduct of foreign affairs,--a department which is most peculiarly and\r\ntraditionally the employment and test of a highly-trained statesman. It may\r\nbe fairly said that no one, with the exception of John Quincy Adams, has\r\never shown higher qualities, or attained greater success in the\r\nadministration of the State Department, than Mr. Webster did while in Mr.\r\nTyler's cabinet.\r\n\r\nOn his resignation, he returned at once to private life, and passed the\r\nnext summer on his farm at Marshfield,--now grown into a large\r\nestate,--which was a source of constant interest and delight, and where he\r\nwas able to have beneath his eyes his beloved sea. His private affairs were\r\nin disorder, and required his immediate attention. He threw himself into\r\nhis profession, and his practice at once became active, lucrative, and\r\nabsorbing. To this period of retirement belong the second Bunker Hill\r\noration and the Girard argument, which made so much noise in its day. He\r\nkept himself aloof from politics, but could not wholly withdraw from them.\r\nThe feeling against him, on account of his continuance in the cabinet, had\r\nsubsided, and there was a feeble and somewhat fitful movement to drop Clay,\r\nand present Mr. Webster as a candidate for the presidency. Mr. Webster,\r\nhowever, made a speech at Andover, defending his course and advocating Whig\r\nprinciples, and declared that he was not a candidate for office. He also\r\nrefused to allow New Hampshire to mar party harmony by bringing his name\r\nforward. When Mr. Clay was nominated, in May, 1844, Mr. Webster, who had\r\nbeheld with anxiety the rise of the Liberty party and prophesied the\r\nannexation of Texas, decided, although he was dissatisfied with the silence\r\nof the Whigs on this subject, to sustain their candidate. This was\r\nundoubtedly the wisest course; and, having once enlisted, he gave Mr. Clay\r\na hearty and vigorous support, making a series of powerful speeches,\r\nchiefly on the tariff, and second in variety and ability only to those\r\nwhich he had delivered in the Harrison campaign. Mr. Clay was defeated\r\nlargely by the action of the Liberty party, and the silence of the Whigs\r\nabout Texas and slavery cost them the election. At the beginning of the\r\nyear Mr. Webster had declined a reëlection to the Senate, but it was\r\nimpossible for him to remain out of politics, and the pressure to return\r\nsoon became too strong to be resisted. When Mr. Choate resigned in the\r\nwinter of 1844-45, Mr. Webster was reëlected senator, from Massachusetts.\r\nOn the first of March the intrigue, to perfect which Mr. Calhoun had\r\naccepted the State Department, culminated, and the resolutions for the\r\nannexation of Texas passed both branches of Congress. Four days later Mr.\r\nPolk's administration, pledged to the support and continuance of the\r\nannexation policy, was in power, and Mr. Webster had taken his seat in the\r\nSenate for his last term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nRETURN TO THE SENATE.--THE SEVENTH OF MARCH SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal events of Mr. Polk's administration belong to or grow out of\r\nthe slavery agitation, then beginning to assume most terrible proportions.\r\nSo far as Mr. Webster is concerned, they form part of the history of his\r\ncourse on the slavery question, which culminated in the famous speech of\r\nMarch 7, 1850. Before approaching that subject, however, it will be\r\nnecessary to touch very briefly on one or two points of importance in Mr.\r\nWebster's career, which have no immediate bearing on the question of\r\nslavery, and no relation to the final and decisive stand which Mr. Webster\r\ntook in regard to it.\r\n\r\nThe Ashburton treaty was open to one just criticism. It did not go far\r\nenough. It did not settle the northwestern as it did the northeastern\r\nboundary. Mr. Webster, as has been said, made an effort to deal with the\r\nformer as well as the latter, but he met with no encouragement, and as he\r\nwas then preparing to retire from office, the matter dropped. In regard to\r\nthe northwestern boundary Mr. Webster agreed with the opinion of Mr.\r\nMonroe's cabinet, that the forty-ninth parallel was a fair and proper line;\r\nbut the British undertook to claim the line of the Columbia River, and this\r\nexcited corresponding claims on our side. The Democracy for political\r\npurposes became especially warlike and patriotic. They declared in their\r\nplatform that we must have the whole of Oregon and reoccupy it at once. Mr.\r\nPolk embodied this view in his message, together with the assertion that\r\nour rights extended to the line of 54° 40' north, and a shout of\r\n\"fifty-four-forty or fight\" went through the land from the enthusiastic\r\nDemocracy. If this attitude meant anything it meant war, inasmuch as our\r\nproposal for the forty-ninth parallel, and the free navigation of the\r\nColumbia River, made in the autumn of 1845, had been rejected by England,\r\nand then withdrawn by us. Under these circumstances Mr. Webster felt it his\r\nduty to come forward and exert all his influence to maintain peace, and to\r\npromote a clear comprehension, both in the United States and in Europe, of\r\nthe points at issue. His speech on this subject and with this aim was\r\ndelivered in Faneuil Hall. He spoke of the necessity of peace, of the fair\r\nadjustment offered by an acceptance of the forty-ninth parallel, and\r\nderided the idea of casting two great nations into war for such a question\r\nas this. He closed with a forcible and solemn denunciation of the president\r\nor minister who should dare to take the responsibility for kindling the\r\nflames of war on such a pretext. The speech was widely read. It was\r\ntranslated into nearly all the languages of Europe, and on the continent\r\nhad a great effect. About a month later he wrote to Mr. MacGregor of\r\nGlasgow, suggesting that the British government should offer to accept the\r\nforty-ninth parallel, and his letter was shown to Lord Aberdeen, who at\r\nonce acted upon the advice it contained. While this letter, however, was on\r\nits way, certain resolutions were introduced in the Senate relating to the\r\nnational defences, and to give notice of the termination of the convention\r\nfor the joint occupation of Oregon, which would of course have been nearly\r\nequivalent to a declaration of war. Mr. Webster opposed the resolutions,\r\nand insisted that, while the Executive, as he believed, had no real wish\r\nfor war, this talk was kept up about \"all or none,\" which left nothing to\r\nnegotiate about. The notice finally passed, but before it could be\r\ndelivered by our minister in London, Lord Aberdeen's proposition of the\r\nforty-ninth parallel, as suggested by Mr. Webster, had been received at\r\nWashington, where it was accepted by the truculent administration, agreed\r\nto by the Senate, and finally embodied in a treaty. Mr. Webster's\r\nopposition had served its purpose in delaying action and saving bluster\r\nfrom being converted into actual war,--a practical conclusion by no means\r\ndesired by the dominant party, who had talked so loud that they came very\r\nnear blundering into hostilities merely as a matter of self-justification.\r\nThe declarations of the Democratic convention and of the Democratic\r\nPresident in regard to England were really only sound and fury, although\r\nthey went so far that the final retreat was noticeable and not very\r\ngraceful. The Democratic leaders had had no intention of fighting with\r\nEngland when all they could hope to gain would be glory and hard knocks,\r\nbut they had a very definite idea of attacking without bluster and in good\r\nearnest another nation where there was territory to be obtained for\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon question led, however, to an attack upon Mr. Webster which\r\ncannot be wholly passed over. He had, of course, his personal enemies in\r\nboth parties, and his effective opposition to war with England greatly\r\nangered some of the most warlike of the Democrats, and especially Mr. C.J.\r\nIngersoll of Pennsylvania, a bitter Anglophobist. Mr. Ingersoll, in\r\nFebruary, made a savage attack upon the Ashburton negotiation, the treaty\r\nof Washington, and upon Mr. Webster personally, alleging that as Secretary\r\nof State he had been guilty of a variety of grave misdemeanors, including a\r\ncorrupt use of the public money. Some of these charges, those relating to\r\nthe payment of McLeod's counsel by our government, to instructions to the\r\nAttorney-General to take charge of McLeod's defence, and to a threat by\r\nMr. Webster that if McLeod were not released New York would be laid in\r\nashes, were repeated in the Senate by Mr. Dickinson of New York. Mr.\r\nWebster peremptorily called for all the papers relating to the negotiation\r\nof 1842, and on the sixth and seventh of April (1846), he made the\r\nelaborate speech in defence of the Ashburton treaty, which is included in\r\nhis collected works. It is one of the strongest and most virile speeches he\r\never delivered. He was profoundly indignant, and he had the completest\r\nmastery of his subject. In fact, he was so deeply angered by the charges\r\nmade against him, that he departed from his almost invariable practice, and\r\nindulged in a severe personal denunciation of Ingersoll and Dickinson.\r\nAlthough he did not employ personal invective in his oratory, it was a\r\nweapon which he was capable of using with most terrible effect, and his\r\nblows fell with crushing force upon Ingersoll, who writhed under the\r\nstrokes. Through some inferior officers of the State Department Ingersoll\r\ngot what he considered proofs, and then introduced resolutions calling for\r\nan account of all payments from the secret service fund; for communications\r\nmade by Mr. Webster to Messrs. Adams and Gushing of the Committee on\r\nForeign Affairs; for all papers relating to McLeod, and for the minutes of\r\nthe committee on Foreign Affairs, to show that Mr. Webster had expressed an\r\nopinion adverse to our claim in the Oregon dispute. Mr. Ingersoll closed\r\nhis speech by a threat of impeachment as the result and reward of all this\r\nevil-doing, and an angry debate followed, in which Mr. Webster was attacked\r\nand defended with equal violence. President Polk replied to the call of the\r\nHouse by saying that he could not feel justified, either morally or\r\nlegally, in revealing the uses of the secret service fund. Meantime a\r\nsimilar resolution was defeated in the Senate by a vote of forty-four to\r\none, Mr. Webster remarking that he was glad that the President had refused\r\nthe request of the House; that he should have been sorry to have seen an\r\nimportant principle violated, and that he was not in the least concerned at\r\nbeing thus left without an explanation; he needed no defence, he said,\r\nagainst such attacks.\r\n\r\nMr. Ingersoll, rebuffed by the President, then made a personal explanation,\r\nalleging specifically that Mr. Webster had made an unlawful use of the\r\nsecret service money, that he had employed it to corrupt the press, and\r\nthat he was a defaulter. Mr. Ashmun of Massachusetts replied with great\r\nbitterness, and the charges were referred to a committee. It appeared, on\r\ninvestigation, that Mr. Webster had been extremely careless in his\r\naccounts, and had delayed in making them up and in rendering vouchers,\r\nfaults to which he was naturally prone; but it also appeared that the money\r\nhad been properly spent, that the accounts had ultimately been made up, and\r\nthat there was no evidence of improper use. The committee's report was\r\nlaid upon the table, the charges came to nothing, and Mr. Ingersoll was\r\nleft in a very unpleasant position with regard to the manner in which he\r\nhad obtained his information from the State Department. The affair is of\r\ninterest now merely as showing how deeply rooted was Mr. Webster's habitual\r\ncarelessness in money matters, even when it was liable to expose him to\r\nvery grave imputations, and what a very dangerous man he was to arouse and\r\nput on the defensive.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was absent when the intrigue and scheming of Mr. Polk\r\nculminated in war with Mexico, and so his vote was not given either for or\r\nagainst it. He opposed the volunteer system as a mongrel contrivance, and\r\nresisted it as he had the conscription bill in the war of 1812, as\r\nunconstitutional. He also opposed the continued prosecution of the war,\r\nand, when it drew toward a close, was most earnest against the acquisition\r\nof new territory. In the summer of 1847 he made an extended tour through\r\nthe Southern States, and was received there, as he had been in the West,\r\nwith every expression of interest and admiration.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican war, however, cost Mr. Webster far more than the anxiety and\r\ndisappointment which it brought to him as a public man. His second son,\r\nMajor Edward Webster, died near the City of Mexico, from disease contracted\r\nby exposure on the march. This melancholy news reached Mr. Webster when\r\nimportant matters which demanded his attention were pending in Congress.\r\nMeasures to continue the war were before the Senate even after they had\r\nratified the peace. These measures Mr. Webster strongly resisted, and he\r\nalso opposed, in a speech of great power, the acquisition of new\r\nterritories by conquest, as threatening the very existence of the nation,\r\nthe principles of the Constitution, and the Constitution itself. The\r\nincrease of senators, which was, of course, the object of the South in\r\nannexing Texas and in the proposed additions from Mexico, he regarded as\r\ndestroying the balance of the government, and therefore he denounced the\r\nplan of acquisition by conquest in the strongest terms. The course about to\r\nbe adopted, he said, will turn the Constitution into a deformity, into a\r\ncurse rather than a blessing; it will make a frame of government founded on\r\nthe grossest inequality, and will imperil the existence of the Union. With\r\nthis solemn warning he closed his speech, and immediately left Washington\r\nfor Boston, where his daughter, Mrs. Appleton, was sinking in consumption.\r\nShe died on April 28th and was buried on May 1st. Three days later, Mr.\r\nWebster followed to the grave the body of his son Edward, which had been\r\nbrought from Mexico. Two such terrible blows, coming so near together, need\r\nno comment. They tell their own sad story. One child only remained to him\r\nof all who had gathered about his knees in the happy days at Portsmouth\r\nand Boston, and his mind turned to thoughts of death as he prepared at\r\nMarshfield a final resting-place for himself and those he had loved.\r\nWhatever successes or defeats were still in store for him, the heavy cloud\r\nof domestic sorrow could never be dispersed in the years that remained, nor\r\ncould the gaps which had been made be filled or forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut the sting of personal disappointment and of frustrated ambition,\r\ntrivial enough in comparison with such griefs as these, was now added to\r\nthis heavy burden of domestic affliction. The success of General Taylor in\r\nMexico rendered him a most tempting candidate for the Whigs to nominate.\r\nHis military services and his personal popularity promised victory, and the\r\nfact that no one knew Taylor's political principles, or even whether he was\r\na Whig or a Democrat, seemed rather to increase than diminish his\r\nattractions in the eyes of the politicians. A movement was set on foot to\r\nbring about this nomination, and its managers planned to make Mr. Webster\r\nVice-President on the ticket with the victorious soldier. Such an offer was\r\na melancholy commentary on his ambitious hopes. He spurned the proposition\r\nas a personal indignity, and, disapproving always of the selection of\r\nmilitary men for the presidency, openly refused to give his assent to\r\nTaylor's nomination. Other trials, however, were still in store for him.\r\nMr. Clay was a candidate for the nomination, and many Whigs, feeling that\r\nhis success meant another party defeat, turned to Taylor as the only\r\ninstrument to prevent this danger. In February, 1848, a call was issued in\r\nNew York for a public meeting to advance General Taylor's candidacy, which\r\nwas signed by many of Mr. Webster's personal and political friends. Mr.\r\nWebster was surprised and grieved, and bitterly resented this action. His\r\nbiographer, Mr. Curtis, speaks of it as a blunder which rendered Mr.\r\nWebster's nomination hopeless. The truth is, that it was a most significant\r\nillustration of the utter futility of Mr. Webster's presidential\r\naspirations. These friends in New York, who no doubt honestly desired his\r\nnomination, were so well satisfied that it was perfectly impracticable,\r\nthat they turned to General Taylor to avoid the disaster threatened, as\r\nthey believed, by Mr. Clay's success. Mr. Webster predicted truly that Clay\r\nand Taylor would be the leading candidates before the convention, but he\r\nwas wholly mistaken in supposing that the movement in New York would bring\r\nabout the nomination of the former. His friends had judged rightly. Taylor\r\nwas the only man who could defeat Clay, and he was nominated on the fourth\r\nballot. Massachusetts voted steadily for Webster, but he never approached a\r\nnomination. Even Scott had twice as many votes. The result of the\r\nconvention led Mr. Webster to take a very gloomy view of the prospects of\r\nthe Whigs, and he was strongly inclined to retire to his tent and let them\r\ngo to deserved ruin. In private conversation he spoke most disparagingly of\r\nthe nomination, the Whig party, and the Whig candidate. His strictures were\r\nwell deserved, but, as the election drew on, he found or believed it to be\r\nimpossible to live up to them. He was not ready to go over to the Free-Soil\r\nparty, he could not remain silent, yet he could not give Taylor a full\r\nsupport. In September, 1848, he made his famous speech at Marshfield, in\r\nwhich, after declaring that the \"sagacious, wise, far-seeing doctrine of\r\n_availability_ lay at the root of the whole matter,\" and that \"the\r\nnomination was one not fit to be made,\" he said that General Taylor was\r\npersonally a brave and honorable man, and that, as the choice lay between\r\nhim and the Democratic candidate, General Cass, he should vote for the\r\nformer and advised his friends to do the same. He afterwards made another\r\nspeech, in a similar but milder strain, in Faneuil Hall. Mr. Webster's\r\nattitude was not unlike that of Hamilton when he published his celebrated\r\nattack on Adams, which ended by advising all men to vote for that\r\nobjectionable man. The conclusion was a little impotent in both instances,\r\nbut in Mr. Webster's case the results were better. The politicians and\r\nlovers of availability had judged wisely, and Taylor was triumphantly\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nBefore the new President was inaugurated, in the winter of 1848-49, the\r\nstruggle began in Congress, which led to the delivery of the 7th of March\r\nspeech by Mr. Webster in the following year. At this point, therefore, it\r\nbecomes necessary to turn back and review briefly and rapidly Mr. Webster's\r\ncourse in regard to the question of slavery.\r\n\r\nHis first important utterance on this momentous question was in 1819, when\r\nthe land was distracted with the conflict which had suddenly arisen over\r\nthe admission of Missouri. Massachusetts was strongly in favor of the\r\nexclusion of slavery from the new States, and utterly averse to any\r\ncompromise. A meeting was held in the state-house at Boston, and a\r\ncommittee was appointed to draft a memorial to Congress, on the subject of\r\nthe prohibition of slavery in the territories. This memorial,--which was\r\nafterwards adopted,--was drawn by Mr. Webster, as chairman of the\r\ncommittee. It set forth, first, the belief of its signers that Congress had\r\nthe constitutional power \"to make such a prohibition a condition on the\r\nadmission of a new State into the Union, and that it is just and proper\r\nthat they should exercise that power.\" Then came an argument on the\r\nconstitutional question, and then the reasons for the exercise of the power\r\nas a general policy. The first point was that it would prevent further\r\ninequality of representation, such as existed under the Constitution in\r\nthe old States, but which could not be increased without danger. The next\r\nargument went straight to the merits of the question, as involved in\r\nslavery as a system. After pointing out the value of the ordinance of 1787\r\nto the Northwest, the memorial continued:--\r\n\r\n     \"We appeal to the justice and the wisdom of the national councils\r\n     to prevent the further progress of a great and serious evil. We\r\n     appeal to those who look forward to the remote consequences of\r\n     their measures, and who cannot balance a temporary or trifling\r\n     convenience, if there were such, against a permanent growing and\r\n     desolating evil.\r\n\r\n     \"... The Missouri territory is a new country. If its extensive and\r\n     fertile fields shall be opened as a market for slaves, the\r\n     government will seem to become a party to a traffic, which in so\r\n     many acts, through so many years, it has denounced as impolitic,\r\n     unchristian, and inhuman.... The laws of the United States have\r\n     denounced heavy penalties against the traffic in slaves, because\r\n     such traffic is deemed unjust and inhuman. We appeal to the spirit\r\n     of these laws; we appeal to this justice and humanity; we ask\r\n     whether they ought not to operate, on the present occasion, with\r\n     all their force? We have a strong feeling of the injustice of any\r\n     toleration of slavery. Circumstances have entailed it on a portion\r\n     of our community, which cannot be immediately relieved from it\r\n     without consequences more injurious than the suffering of the evil.\r\n     But to permit it in a new country, where yet no habits are formed\r\n     which render it indispensable, what is it but to encourage that\r\n     rapacity and fraud and violence against which we have so long\r\n     pointed the denunciation of our penal code? What is it but to\r\n     tarnish the proud fame of the country? What is it but to render\r\n     questionable all its professions of regard for the rights of\r\n     humanity and the liberties of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nA year later Mr. Webster again spoke on one portion of this subject, and in\r\nthe same tone of deep hostility and reproach. This second instance was that\r\nfamous and much quoted passage of his Plymouth oration in which he\r\ndenounced the African slave-trade. Every one remembers the ringing words:--\r\n\r\n     \"I hear the sound of the hammer, I see the smoke of the furnaces\r\n     where manacles and fetters are still forged for human limbs. I see\r\n     the visages of those who, by stealth and at midnight, labor in this\r\n     work of hell,--foul and dark as may become the artificers of such\r\n     instruments of misery and torture. Let that spot be purified, or\r\n     let it cease to be of New England. Let it be purified, or let it be\r\n     set aside from the Christian world; let it be put out of the circle\r\n     of human sympathies and human regards, and let civilized man\r\n     henceforth have no communion with it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is directed against the African slave-trade, the most hideous feature,\r\nperhaps, in the system. But there was no real distinction between slavers\r\nplying from one American port to another and those which crossed the ocean\r\nfor the same purpose. There was no essential difference between slaves\r\nraised for the market in Virginia--whence they were exported and sold--and\r\nthose kidnapped for the same object on the Guinea coast. The physical\r\nsuffering of a land journey might be less than that of a long sea-voyage,\r\nbut the anguish of separation between mother and child was the same in all\r\ncases. The chains which clanked on the limbs of the wretched creatures,\r\ndriven from the auction block along the road which passed beneath the\r\nnational capitol, and the fetters of the captured fugitive were no softer\r\nor lighter than those forged for the cargo of the slave-ships. Yet the man\r\nwho so magnificently denounced the one in 1820, found no cause to repeat\r\nthe denunciation in 1850, when only domestic traffic was in question. The\r\nmemorial of 1819 and the oration of 1820 place the African slave-trade and\r\nthe domestic branch of the business on precisely the same ground of infamy\r\nand cruelty. In 1850 Mr. Webster seems to have discovered that there was a\r\nwide gulf fixed between them, for the latter wholly failed to excite the\r\nstern condemnation poured forth by the memorialist of 1819 and the orator\r\nof 1820. The Fugitive Slave Law, more inhuman than either of the forms of\r\ntraffic, was defended in 1850 on good constitutional grounds; but the\r\neloquent invective of the early days against an evil which constitutions\r\nmight necessitate but could not alter or justify, does not go hand in hand\r\nwith the legal argument.\r\n\r\nThe next occasion after the Missouri Compromise, on which slavery made its\r\ninfluence strongly felt at Washington, was when Mr. Adams's scheme of the\r\nPanama mission aroused such bitter and unexpected resistance in Congress.\r\nMr. Webster defended the policy of the President with great ability, but he\r\nconfined himself to the international and constitutional questions which it\r\ninvolved, and did not discuss the underlying motive and true source of the\r\nopposition. The debate on Foote's resolution in 1830, in the wide range\r\nwhich it took, of course included slavery, and Mr. Hayne had a good deal to\r\nsay on that subject, which lay at the bottom of the tariff agitation, as it\r\ndid at that of every Southern movement of any real importance. In his\r\nreply, Mr. Webster said that he had made no attack upon this sensitive\r\ninstitution, that he had simply stated that the Northwest had been greatly\r\nbenefited by the exclusion of slavery, and that it would have been better\r\nfor Kentucky if she had come within the scope of the ordinance of 1787. The\r\nweight of his remarks was directed to showing that the complaint of\r\nNorthern attacks on slavery as existing in the Southern States, or of\r\nNorthern schemes to compel the abolition of slavery, was utterly groundless\r\nand fallacious. At the same time he pointed out the way in which slavery\r\nwas continually used to unite the South against the North.\r\n\r\n     \"This feeling,\" he said, \"always carefully kept alive, and\r\n     maintained at too intense a heat to admit discrimination or\r\n     reflection, is a lever of great power in our political machine.\r\n     There is not and never has been a disposition in the North to\r\n     interfere with these interests of the South. Such interference has\r\n     never been supposed to be within the power of government; nor has\r\n     it been in any way attempted. The slavery of the South has always\r\n     been regarded as a matter of domestic policy left with the States\r\n     themselves, and with which the Federal government had nothing to\r\n     do. Certainly, sir, I am and ever have been of that opinion. The\r\n     gentleman, indeed, argues that slavery, in the abstract, is no\r\n     evil. Most assuredly, I need not say I differ with him altogether\r\n     and most widely on that point. I regard domestic slavery as one of\r\n     the greatest evils, both moral and political.\"\r\n\r\nHis position is here clearly defined. He admits fully that slavery within\r\nthe States cannot be interfered with by the general government, under the\r\nConstitution. But he also insists that it is a great evil, and the obvious\r\nconclusion is, that its extension, over which the government does have\r\ncontrol, must and should be checked. This is the attitude of the memorial\r\nand the oration. Nothing has yet changed. There is less fervor in the\r\ndenunciation of slavery, but that may be fairly attributed to circumstances\r\nwhich made the maintenance of the general government and the enforcement of\r\nthe revenue laws the main points in issue.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the anti-slavery movement, destined to grow to such vast\r\nproportions, began to show itself in the Senate. The first contest came on\r\nthe reception of petitions for the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia. Mr. Calhoun moved that these petitions should not be received,\r\nbut his motion was rejected by a large majority. The question then came on\r\nthe petitions themselves, and, by a vote of thirty-four to six, their\r\nprayer was rejected, Mr. Webster voting with the minority because he\r\ndisapproved this method of disposing of the matter. Soon after, Mr. Webster\r\npresented three similar petitions, two from Massachusetts and one from\r\nMichigan, and moved their reference to a committee of inquiry. He stated\r\nthat, while the government had no power whatever over slavery in the\r\nStates, it had complete control over slavery in the District, which was a\r\ntotally distinct affair. He urged a respectful treatment of the petitions,\r\nand defended the right of petition and the motives and characters of the\r\npetitioners. He spoke briefly, and, except when he was charged with placing\r\nhimself at the head of the petitioners, coldly, and did not touch on the\r\nmerits of the question, either as to the abolition of slavery in the\r\nDistrict or as to slavery itself.\r\n\r\nThe Southerners, especially the extremists and the nullifiers, were always\r\nmore ready than any one else to strain the powers of the central government\r\nto the last point, and use them most tyrannically and illegally in their\r\nown interest and in that of their pet institution. The session of 1836\r\nfurnished a striking example of this characteristic quality. Mr. Calhoun\r\nat that time introduced his monstrous bill to control the United States\r\nmails in the interests of slavery, by authorizing postmasters to seize and\r\nsuppress all anti-slavery documents. Against this measure Mr. Webster spoke\r\nand voted, resting his opposition on general grounds, and sustaining it by\r\na strong and effective argument. In the following year, on his way to the\r\nNorth, after the inauguration of Mr. Van Buren, a great public reception\r\nwas given to him in New York, and on that occasion he made the speech in\r\nNiblo's Garden, where he defined the Whig principles, arraigned so\r\npowerfully the policy of Jackson, and laid the foundation for the triumphs\r\nof the Harrison campaign. In the course of that speech he referred to\r\nTexas, and strongly expressed his belief that it should remain independent\r\nand should not be annexed. This led him to touch upon slavery. He said:--\r\n\r\n     \"I frankly avow my entire unwillingness to do anything that shall\r\n     extend the slavery of the African race on this continent, or add\r\n     other slave-holding States to the Union. When I say that I regard\r\n     slavery in itself as a great moral, social, and political evil, I\r\n     only use the language which has been adopted by distinguished men,\r\n     themselves citizens of slave-holding States. I shall do nothing,\r\n     therefore, to favor or encourage its further extension. We have\r\n     slavery already amongst us. The Constitution found it in the Union,\r\n     it recognized it, and gave it solemn guaranties. To the full\r\n     extent of the guaranties we are all bound in honor, in justice, and\r\n     by the Constitution.... But when we come to speak of admitting new\r\n     States, the subject assumes an entirely different aspect.... In my\r\n     opinion, the people of the United States will not consent to bring\r\n     into the Union a new, vastly extensive, and slave-holding country,\r\n     large enough for half a dozen or a dozen States. In my opinion,\r\n     they ought not to consent to it.... On the general question of\r\n     slavery a great portion of the community is already strongly\r\n     excited. The subject has not only attracted attention as a question\r\n     of politics, but it has struck a far deeper-toned chord. It has\r\n     arrested the religious feeling of the country; it has taken strong\r\n     hold on the consciences of men. He is a rash man, indeed, and\r\n     little conversant with human nature, and especially has he a very\r\n     erroneous estimate of the character of the people of this country,\r\n     who supposes that a feeling of this kind is to be trifled with or\r\n     despised. It will assuredly cause itself to be respected. It may be\r\n     reasoned with, it may be made willing--I believe it is entirely\r\n     willing--to fulfil all existing engagements and all existing\r\n     duties, to uphold and defend the Constitution as it is established,\r\n     with whatever regrets about some provisions which it does actually\r\n     contain. But to coerce it into silence, to endeavor to restrain its\r\n     free expression, to seek to compress and confine it, warm as it is\r\n     and more heated as such endeavors would inevitably render\r\n     it,--should this be attempted, I know nothing, even in the\r\n     Constitution or in the Union itself, which would not be endangered\r\n     by the explosion which might follow.\"\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Webster spoke on slavery and upon the agitation against it, in\r\n1837. The tone was the same as in 1820, and there was the same ring of\r\ndignified courage and unyielding opposition to the extension and\r\nperpetuation of a crying evil.\r\n\r\nIn the session of Congress preceding the speech at Niblo's Garden, numerous\r\npetitions for the abolition of slavery in the District had been offered.\r\nMr. Webster reiterated his views as to the proper disposition to be made of\r\nthem; but announced that he had no intention of expressing an opinion as to\r\nthe merits of the question. Objections were made to the reception of the\r\npetitions, the question was stated on the reception, and the whole matter\r\nwas laid on the table. The Senate, under the lead of Calhoun, was trying to\r\nshut the door against the petitioners, and stifle the right of petition;\r\nand there was no John Quincy Adams among them to do desperate battle\r\nagainst this infamous scheme.\r\n\r\nIn the following year came more petitions, and Mr. Calhoun now attempted to\r\nstop the agitation in another fashion. He introduced a resolution to the\r\neffect that these petitions were a direct and dangerous attack on the\r\n\"institution\" of the slave-holding States. This Mr. Clay improved in a\r\nsubstitute, which stated that any act or measure of Congress looking to the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District would be a violation of the faith\r\nimplied in the cession by Virginia and Maryland,--a just cause of alarm to\r\nthe South, and having a direct tendency to disturb and endanger the Union.\r\nMr. Webster wrote to a friend that this was an attempt to make a new\r\nConstitution, and that the proceedings of the Senate, when they passed the\r\nresolutions, drew a line which could never be obliterated. Mr. Webster also\r\nspoke briefly against the resolutions, confining himself strictly to\r\ndemonstrating the absurdity of Mr. Clay's doctrine of \"plighted faith.\" He\r\ndisclaimed carefully, and even anxiously, any intention of expressing an\r\nopinion on the merits of the question; although he mentioned one or two\r\nreasonable arguments against abolition. The resolutions were adopted by a\r\nlarge majority, Mr. Webster voting against them on the grounds set forth in\r\nhis speech. Whether the approaching presidential election had any\r\nconnection with his careful avoidance of everything except the\r\nconstitutional point, which contrasted so strongly with his recent\r\nutterances at Niblo's Garden, it is, of course, impossible to determine.\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, who had no love for Mr. Webster, and who was then in the\r\nmidst of his desperate struggle for the right of petition, says, in his\r\ndiary, in March, 1838, speaking of the delegation from Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n     \"Their policy is dalliance with the South; and they care no more\r\n     for the right of petition than is absolutely necessary to satisfy\r\n     the feeling of their constituents. They are jealous of Cushing,\r\n     who, they think, is playing a double game. They are envious of my\r\n     position as the supporter of the right of petition; and they\r\n     truckle to the South to court their favor for Webster. He is now\r\n     himself tampering with the South on the slavery and the Texas\r\n     question.\"\r\n\r\nThis harsh judgment may or may not be correct, but it shows very plainly\r\nthat Mr. Webster's caution in dealing with these topics was noticed and\r\ncriticised at this period. The annexation of Texas, moreover, which he had\r\nso warmly opposed, seemed to him, at this juncture, and not without reason,\r\nto be less threatening, owing to the course of events in the young\r\nrepublic. Mr. Adams did not, however, stand alone in thinking that Mr.\r\nWebster, at this time, was lukewarm on the subject. In 1839 Mr. Giddings\r\nsays \"that it was impossible for any man, who submitted so quietly to the\r\ndictation of slavery as Mr. Webster, to command that influence which was\r\nnecessary to constitute a successful politician.\" How much Mr. Webster's\r\nattitude had weakened, just at this period, is shown better by his own\r\naction than by anything Mr. Giddings could say. The ship Enterprise,\r\nengaged in the domestic slave-trade from Virginia to New Orleans, had been\r\ndriven into Port Hamilton, and the slaves had escaped. Great Britain\r\nrefused compensation. Thereupon, early in 1840, Mr. Calhoun introduced\r\nresolutions declaratory of international law on this point, and setting\r\nforth that England had no right to interfere with, or to permit, the\r\nescape of slaves from vessels driven into her ports. The resolutions were\r\nidle, because they could effect nothing, and mischievous because they\r\nrepresented that the sentiment of the Senate was in favor of protecting the\r\nslave-trade. Upon these resolutions, absurd in character and barbarous in\r\nprinciple, Mr. Webster did not even vote. There is a strange contrast here\r\nbetween the splendid denunciation of the Plymouth oration and this utter\r\nlack of opinion, upon resolutions designed to create a sentiment favorable\r\nto the protection of slave-ships engaged in the domestic traffic. Soon\r\nafterwards, when Mr. Webster was Secretary of State, he advanced much the\r\nsame doctrine in the discussion of the Creole case, and his letter was\r\napproved by Calhoun. There may be merit in the legal argument, but the\r\ncharacter of the cargo, which it was sought to protect, put it beyond the\r\nreach of law. We have no need to go farther than the Plymouth oration to\r\nfind the true character of the trade in human beings as carried on upon the\r\nhigh seas.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the cabinet, and resuming his law practice, Mr. Webster, of\r\ncourse, continued to watch with attention the progress of events. The\r\nformation of the Liberty party, in the summer of 1843, appeared to him a\r\nvery grave circumstance. He had always understood the force of the\r\nanti-slavery movement at the North, and it was with much anxiety that he\r\nnow saw it take definite shape, and assume extreme grounds of opposition.\r\nThis feeling of anxiety was heightened when he discovered, in the following\r\nwinter, while in attendance upon the Supreme Court at Washington, the\r\nintention of the administration to bring about the annexation of Texas, and\r\nspring the scheme suddenly upon the country. This policy, with its\r\nconsequence of an enormous extension of slave territory, Mr. Webster had\r\nalways vigorously and consistently opposed, and he was now thoroughly\r\nalarmed. He saw what an effect the annexation would produce upon the\r\nanti-slavery movement, and he dreaded the results. He therefore procured\r\nthe introduction of a resolution in Congress against annexation; wrote some\r\narticles in the newspapers against it himself; stirred up his friends in\r\nWashington and New York to do the same, and endeavored to start public\r\nmeetings in Massachusetts. His friends in Boston and elsewhere, and the\r\nWhigs generally, were disposed to think his alarm ill-founded. They were\r\nabsorbed in the coming presidential election, and were too ready to do Mr.\r\nWebster the injustice of supposing that his views upon the probability of\r\nannexation sprang from jealousy of Mr. Clay. The suspicion was unfounded\r\nand unfair. Mr. Webster was wholly right and perfectly sincere. He did a\r\ngood deal in an attempt to rouse the North. The only criticism to be made\r\nis that he did not do more. One public meeting would have been enough, if\r\nhe had spoken frankly, declared that he knew, no matter how, that\r\nannexation was contemplated, and had then denounced it as he did at Niblo's\r\nGarden. \"One blast upon his bugle-horn were worth a thousand men.\" Such a\r\nspeech would have been listened to throughout the length and breadth of the\r\nland; but perhaps it was too much to expect this of him in view of his\r\ndelicate relations with Mr. Clay. At a later period, in the course of the\r\ncampaign, he denounced annexation and the increase of slave territory, but\r\nunfortunately it was then too late. The Whigs had preserved silence on the\r\nsubject at their convention, and it was difficult to deal with it without\r\nreflecting on their candidate. Mr. Webster vindicated his own position and\r\nhis own wisdom, but the mischief could not then be averted. The annexation\r\nof Texas after the rejection of the treaty in 1844 was carried through,\r\nnearly a year later, by a mixture of trickery and audacity in the last\r\nhours of the Tyler administration.\r\n\r\nFour days after the consummation of this project Mr. Webster took his seat\r\nin the Senate, and on March 11 wrote to his son that, \"while we feel as we\r\nought about the annexation of Texas, we ought to keep in view the true\r\ngrounds of objection to that measure. Those grounds are,--want of\r\nconstitutional power,--danger of too great an extent of territory, and\r\nopposition to the increase of slavery and slave representation. It was\r\nproperly considered, also, as a measure tending to produce war.\" He then\r\ngoes on to argue that Mexico had no good cause for war; but it is evident\r\nthat he already dreaded just that result. When Congress assembled again, in\r\nthe following December, the first matter to engage their attention was the\r\nadmission of Texas as a State of the Union. It was impossible to prevent\r\nthe passage of the resolution, but Mr. Webster stated his objections to the\r\nmeasure. His speech was brief and very mild in tone, if compared with the\r\nlanguage which he had frequently used in regard to the annexation. He\r\nexpressed his opposition to this method of obtaining new territory by\r\nresolution instead of treaty, and to acquisition of territory as foreign to\r\nthe true spirit of the Republic, and as endangering the Constitution and\r\nthe Union by increasing the already existing inequality of representation,\r\nand extending the area of slavery. He dwelt on the inviolability of slavery\r\nin the States, and did not touch upon the evils of the system itself.\r\n\r\nBy the following spring the policy of Mr. Polk had culminated, intrigue had\r\ndone its perfect work, hostilities had been brought on with Mexico, and in\r\nMay Congress was invited to declare a war which the administration had\r\ntaken care should already exist. Mr. Webster was absent at this time, and\r\ndid not vote on the declaration of war; and when he returned he confined\r\nhimself to discussing the war measures, and to urging the cessation of\r\nhostilities, and the renewal of efforts to obtain peace.\r\n\r\nThe next session--that of the winter of 1846-47--was occupied, of course,\r\nalmost entirely with the affairs of the war. In these measures Mr. Webster\r\ntook scarcely any part; but toward the close of the session, when the terms\r\non which the war should be concluded were brought up, he again came\r\nforward. February 1, 1847, Mr. Wilmot of Pennsylvania introduced the famous\r\nproviso, which bears his name, as an amendment to the bill appropriating\r\nthree millions of dollars for extraordinary expenses. By this proviso\r\nslavery was to be excluded from all territory thereafter acquired or\r\nannexed by the United States. A fortnight later Mr. Webster, who was\r\nopposed to the acquisition of more territory on any terms, introduced two\r\nresolutions in the Senate, declaring that the war ought not to be\r\nprosecuted for the acquisition of territory, and that Mexico should be\r\ninformed that we did not aim at seizing her domain. A similar resolution\r\nwas offered by Mr. Berrien of Georgia, and defeated by a party vote. On\r\nthis occasion Mr. Webster spoke with great force and in a tone of solemn\r\nwarning against the whole policy of territorial aggrandizement. He\r\ndenounced all that had been done in this direction, and attacked with\r\ntelling force the Northern democracy, which, while it opposed slavery and\r\nfavored the Wilmot Proviso, was yet ready to admit new territory, even\r\nwithout the proviso. His attitude at this time, in opposition to any\r\nfurther acquisition of territory on any terms, was strong and determined,\r\nbut his policy was a terrible confession of weakness. It amounted to saying\r\nthat we must not acquire territory because we had not sufficient courage to\r\nkeep slavery out of it. The Whigs were in a minority, however, and Mr.\r\nWebster could effect nothing. When the Wilmot Proviso came before the\r\nSenate Mr. Webster voted for it, but it was defeated, and the way was clear\r\nfor Mr. Polk and the South to bring in as much territory as they could get,\r\nfree of all conditions which could interfere with the extension of slavery.\r\nIn September, 1847, after speaking and voting as has just been described in\r\nthe previous session of Congress, Mr. Webster addressed the Whig convention\r\nat Springfield on the subject of the Wilmot Proviso. What he then said is\r\nof great importance in any comparison which may be made between his earlier\r\nviews and those which he afterwards put forward, in March, 1850, on the\r\nsame subject. The passage is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"We hear much just now of a panacea for the dangers and evils of\r\n     slavery and slave annexation, which they call the 'Wilmot Proviso.'\r\n     That certainly is a just sentiment, but it is not a sentiment to\r\n     found any new party upon. It is not a sentiment on which\r\n     Massachusetts Whigs differ. There is not a man in this hall who\r\n     holds to it more firmly than I do, nor one who adheres to it more\r\n     than another.\r\n\r\n     \"I feel some little interest in this matter, sir. Did I not commit\r\n     myself in 1837 to the whole doctrine, fully, entirely? And I must\r\n     be permitted to say that I cannot quite consent that more recent\r\n     discoverers should claim the merit, and take out a patent.\r\n\r\n     \"I deny the priority of their invention. Allow me to say, sir, it\r\n     is not their thunder.\r\n\r\n     \"There is no one who can complain of the North for resisting the\r\n     increase of slave representation, because it gives power to the\r\n     minority in a manner inconsistent with the principles of our\r\n     government. What is past must stand; what is established must\r\n     stand; and with the same firmness with which I shall resist every\r\n     plan to augment the slave representation, or to bring the\r\n     Constitution into hazard by attempting to extend our dominions,\r\n     shall I contend to allow existing rights to remain.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, I can only say that, in my judgment, we are to use the first,\r\n     the last, and every occasion which occurs, in maintaining our\r\n     sentiments against the extension of the slave-power.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following winter Mr. Webster continued his policy of opposition to\r\nall acquisitions of territory. Although the cloud of domestic sorrow was\r\nalready upon him, he spoke against the legislative powers involved in the\r\n\"Ten Regiment\" Bill, and on the 23d of March, after the ratification of the\r\ntreaty of peace, which carried with it large cessions of territory, he\r\ndelivered a long and elaborate speech on the \"Objects of the Mexican War.\"\r\nThe weight of his speech was directed against the acquisition of\r\nterritory, on account of its effect on the Constitution, and the increased\r\ninequality of representation which it involved. He referred to the plan of\r\ncutting up Texas so as to obtain ten senators, as \"borough mongering\" on a\r\ngrand scale, a course which he proposed to resist to the last; and he\r\nconcluded by denouncing the whole project as one calculated to turn the\r\nConstitution into a curse rather than a blessing. \"I resist it to-day and\r\nalways,\" he said. \"Whoever falters or whoever flies, I continue the\r\ncontest.\"\r\n\r\nIn June General Taylor was nominated, and soon after Mr. Webster left\r\nWashington, although Congress was still in session. He returned in August,\r\nin time to take part in the settlement of the Oregon question. The South,\r\nwith customary shrewdness, was endeavoring to use the territorial\r\norganization of Oregon as a lever to help them in their struggle to gain\r\ncontrol of the new conquests. A bill came up from the House with no\r\nprovision in regard to slavery, and Mr. Douglas carried an amendment to it,\r\ndeclaring the Missouri Compromise to be in full force in Oregon. The House\r\ndisagreed, and, on the question of receding, Mr. Webster took occasion to\r\nspeak on the subject of slavery in the territories. He was disgusted with\r\nthe nomination of Taylor and with the cowardly silence of the Whigs on the\r\nquestion of the extension of slavery. In this frame of mind he made one of\r\nthe strongest and best speeches he ever delivered on this topic. He denied\r\nthat slavery was an \"institution;\" he denied that the local right to hold\r\nslaves implied the right of the owner to carry them with him and keep them\r\nin slavery on free soil; he stated in the strongest possible manner the\r\nright of Congress to control slavery or to prohibit it in the territories;\r\nand he concluded with a sweeping declaration of his opposition to any\r\nextension of slavery or any increase of slave representation. The Oregon\r\nbill finally passed under the pressure of the \"Free-Soil\" nominations, with\r\na clause inserted in the House, embodying substantially the principles of\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress adjourned, Mr. Webster returned to Marshfield, where he made\r\nthe speech on the nomination of General Taylor. It was a crisis in his\r\nlife. At that moment he could have parted with the Whigs and put himself at\r\nthe head of the constitutional anti-slavery party. The Free-Soilers had\r\ntaken the very ground against the extension of slavery which he had so long\r\noccupied. He could have gone consistently, he could have separated from the\r\nWhigs on a great question of principle, and such a course would have been\r\nno stronger evidence of personal disappointment than was afforded by the\r\ndeclaration that the nomination of Taylor was one not fit to be made. Mr.\r\nWebster said that he fully concurred in the main object of the Buffalo\r\nConvention, that he was as good a Free-Soiler as any of them, but that the\r\nFree-Soil party presented nothing new or valuable, and he did not believe\r\nin Mr. Van Buren. He then said it was not true that General Taylor was\r\nnominated by the South, as charged by the Free-Soilers; but he did not\r\nconfess, what was equally true, that Taylor was nominated through fear of\r\nthe South, as was shown by his election by Southern votes. Mr. Webster's\r\nconclusion was, that it was safer to trust a slave-holder, a man without\r\nknown political opinions, and a party which had not the courage of its\r\nconvictions, than to run the risk of the election of another Democrat. Mr.\r\nWebster's place at that moment was at the head of a new party based on the\r\nprinciples which he had himself formulated against the extension of\r\nslavery. Such a change might have destroyed his chances for the presidency,\r\nif he had any, but it would have given him one of the greatest places in\r\nAmerican history and made him the leader in the new period. He lost his\r\nopportunity. He did not change his party, but he soon after accepted the\r\nother alternative and changed his opinions.\r\n\r\nHis course once taken, he made the best of it, and delivered a speech in\r\nFaneuil Hall, in which it is painful to see the effort to push aside\r\nslavery and bring forward the tariff and the sub-treasury. He scoffed at\r\nthis absorption in \"one idea,\" and strove to thrust it away. It was the\r\ncry of \"peace, peace,\" when there was no peace, and when Daniel Webster\r\nknew there could be none until the momentous question had been met and\r\nsettled. Like the great composer who heard in the first notes of his\r\nsymphony \"the hand of Fate knocking at the door,\" the great New England\r\nstatesman heard the same warning in the hoarse murmur against slavery, but\r\nhe shut his ears to the dread sound and passed on.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Webster returned to Washington, after the election of General\r\nTaylor, the strife had already begun over our Mexican conquests. The South\r\nhad got the territory, and the next point was to fasten slavery upon it.\r\nThe North was resolved to prevent the further spread of slavery, but was by\r\nno means so determined or so clear in its views as its opponent. President\r\nPolk urged in his message that Congress should not legislate on the\r\nquestion of slavery in the territories, but that if they did, the right of\r\nslave-holders to carry their slaves with them to the new lands should be\r\nrecognized, and that the best arrangement was to extend the line of the\r\nMissouri Compromise to the Pacific. For the originator and promoter of the\r\nMexican war this was a very natural solution, and was a fit conclusion to\r\none of the worst presidential careers this country has ever seen. The plan\r\nhad only one defect. It would not work. One scheme after another was\r\nbrought before the Senate, only to fail. Finally, Mr. Webster introduced\r\nhis own, which was merely to authorize military government and the\r\nmaintenance of existing laws in the Mexican cessions, and a consequent\r\npostponement of the question. The proposition was reasonable and sensible,\r\nbut it fared little better than the others. The Southerners found, as they\r\nalways did sooner or later, that facts were against them. The people of New\r\nMexico petitioned for a territorial government and for the exclusion of\r\nslavery. Mr. Calhoun pronounced this action \"insolent.\" Slavery was not\r\nonly to be permitted, but the United States government was to be made to\r\nforce it upon the people of the territories. Finally, a resolution was\r\noffered \"to extend the Constitution\" to the territories,--one of those\r\nutterly vague propositions in which the South delighted to hide\r\nwell-defined schemes for extending, not the Constitution, but\r\nslave-holding, to fresh fields and virgin soil. This gave rise to a sharp\r\ndebate between Mr. Webster and Mr. Calhoun as to whether the Constitution\r\nextended to the territories or not. Mr. Webster upheld the latter view, and\r\nthe discussion is chiefly interesting from the fact that Mr. Webster got\r\nthe better of Mr. Calhoun in the argument, and as an example of the\r\nlatter's excessive ingenuity in sustaining and defending a more than\r\ndoubtful proposition. The result of the whole business was, that nothing\r\nwas done, except to extend the revenue laws of the United States to New\r\nMexico and California.\r\n\r\nBefore Congress again assembled, one of the subjects of their debates had\r\ntaken its fortunes into its own hands. California, rapidly peopled by the\r\ndiscoveries of gold, had held a convention and adopted a frame of\r\ngovernment with a clause prohibiting slavery. When Congress met, the\r\nSenators and Representatives of California were in Washington with their\r\nfree Constitution in their hands, demanding the admission of their State\r\ninto the Union.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico was involved in a dispute with Texas as to boundaries, and if\r\nthe claim of Texas was sanctioned, two thirds of the disputed territory\r\nwould come within the scope of the annexation resolutions, and be\r\nslave-holding States. Then there was the further question whether the\r\nWilmot Proviso should be applied to New Mexico on her organization as a\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe President, acting under the influence of Mr. Seward, advised that\r\nCalifornia should be admitted, and the question of slavery in the other\r\nterritories be decided when they should apply for admission. Feeling was\r\nrunning very high in Washington, and there was a bitter and protracted\r\nstruggle of three weeks, before the House succeeded in choosing a Speaker.\r\nThe State Legislatures on both sides took up the burning question, and\r\ndebated and resolved one way or the other with great excitement. The\r\nSouthern members held meetings, and talked about secession and about\r\nwithdrawing from Congress. The air was full of murmurs of dissolution and\r\nintestine strife. The situation was grave and even threatening.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs Mr. Clay, now an old man, and with but a short\r\nterm of life before him, resolved to try once more to solve the problem and\r\ntide over the dangers by a grand compromise. The main features of his plan\r\nwere: the admission of California with her free Constitution; the\r\norganization of territorial governments in the Mexican conquests without\r\nany reference to slavery; the adjustment of the Texan boundary; a guaranty\r\nof the existence of slavery in the District of Columbia until Maryland\r\nshould consent to its abolition; the prohibition of the slave-trade in the\r\nDistrict; provision for the more effectual enforcement of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, and a declaration that Congress had no power over the\r\nslave-trade between the slave-holding States. As the admission of\r\nCalifornia was certain, the proposition to bring about the prohibition of\r\nthe slave-trade in the District was the only concession to the North.\r\nEverything else was in the interest of the South; but then that was always\r\nthe manner in which compromises with slavery were made. They could be\r\neffected in no other way.\r\n\r\nThis outline Mr. Clay submitted to Mr. Webster January 21, 1850, and Mr.\r\nWebster gave it his full approval, subject, of course, to further and more\r\ncareful consideration. February 5 Mr. Clay introduced his plan in the\r\nSenate, and supported it in an eloquent speech. On the 13th the President\r\nsubmitted the Constitution of California, and Mr. Foote moved to refer it,\r\ntogether with all matters relating to slavery, to a select committee. It\r\nnow became noised about that Mr. Webster intended to address the Senate on\r\nthe pending measures, and on the 7th of March he delivered the memorable\r\nspeech which has always been known by its date.\r\n\r\nIt may be premised that in a literary and rhetorical point of view the\r\nspeech of the 7th of March was a fine one. The greater part of it is taken\r\nup with argument and statement, and is very quiet in tone. But the famous\r\npassage beginning \"peaceable secession,\" which came straight from the\r\nheart, and the peroration also, have the glowing eloquence which shone with\r\nso much splendor all through the reply to Hayne. The speech can be readily\r\nanalyzed. With extreme calmness of language Mr. Webster discussed the whole\r\nhistory of slavery in ancient and modern times, and under the Constitution\r\nof the United States. His attitude is so judicial and historical, that if\r\nit is clear he disapproved of the system, it is not equally evident that he\r\ncondemned it. He reviewed the history of the annexation of Texas, defended\r\nhis own consistency, belittled the Wilmot Proviso, admitted substantially\r\nthe boundary claims of Texas, and declared that the character of every\r\npart of the country, so far as slavery or freedom was concerned, was now\r\nsettled, either by law or nature, and that he should resist the insertion\r\nof the Wilmot Proviso in regard to New Mexico, because it would be merely a\r\nwanton taunt and reproach to the South. He then spoke of the change of\r\nfeeling and opinion both at the North and the South in regard to slavery,\r\nand passed next to the question of mutual grievances. He depicted at length\r\nthe grievances of the South, including the tone of the Northern press, the\r\nanti-slavery resolutions of the Legislature, the utterances of the\r\nabolitionists, and the resistance to the Fugitive Slave Law. The last,\r\nwhich he thought the only substantial and legally remediable complaint, he\r\ndwelt on at great length, and severely condemned the refusal of certain\r\nStates to comply with this provision of the Constitution. Then came the\r\ngrievances of the North against the South, which were dealt with very\r\nbriefly. In fact, the Northern grievances, according to Mr. Webster,\r\nconsisted of the tone of the Southern press and of Southern speeches which,\r\nit must be confessed, were at times a little violent and somewhat\r\noffensive. The short paragraph reciting the unconstitutional and\r\nhigh-handed action of the South in regard to free negroes employed as\r\nseamen on Northern vessels, and the outrageous treatment of Mr. Hoar at\r\nCharleston in connection with this matter, was not delivered, Mr. Giddings\r\nsays, but was inserted afterwards and before publication, at the suggestion\r\nof a friend. After this came the fine burst about secession, and a\r\ndeclaration of faith that the Southern convention called at Nashville would\r\nprove patriotic and conciliatory. The speech concluded with a strong appeal\r\nin behalf of nationality and union.\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis correctly says that a great majority of Mr. Webster's\r\nconstituents, if not of the whole North, disapproved this speech. He might\r\nhave added that that majority has steadily increased. The popular verdict\r\nhas been given against the 7th of March speech, and that verdict has passed\r\ninto history. Nothing can now be said or written which will alter the fact\r\nthat the people of this country who maintained and saved the Union have\r\npassed judgment upon Mr. Webster and condemned what he said on the 7th of\r\nMarch, 1850, as wrong in principle and mistaken in policy. This opinion is\r\nnot universal,--no opinion is,--but it is held by the great body of mankind\r\nwho know or care anything about the subject, and it cannot be changed or\r\nsubstantially modified, because subsequent events have fixed its place and\r\nworth irrevocably. It is only necessary, therefore, to examine very briefly\r\nthe grounds of this adverse judgment, and the pleas put in against it by\r\nMr. Webster and by his most devoted partisans.\r\n\r\nFrom the sketch which has been given of Mr. Webster's course on the slavery\r\nquestion, we see that in 1819 and 1820 he denounced in the strongest terms\r\nslavery and every form of slave-trade; that while he fully admitted that\r\nCongress had no power to touch slavery in the States, he asserted that it\r\nwas their right and their paramount duty absolutely to stop any further\r\nextension of slave territory. In 1820 he was opposed to any compromise on\r\nthis question. Ten years later he stood out to the last, unaffected by\r\ndefeat, against the principle of compromise which sacrificed the rights and\r\nthe dignity of the general government to the resistance and threatened\r\nsecession of a State.\r\n\r\nAfter the reply to Hayne in 1830, Mr. Webster became a standing candidate\r\nfor the presidency, or for the Whig nomination to that office. From that\r\ntime forth, the sharp denunciation of slavery and traffic in slaves\r\ndisappears, although there is no indication that he ever altered his\r\noriginal opinion on these points; but he never ceased, sometimes mildly,\r\nsometimes in the most vigorous and sweeping manner, to attack and oppose\r\nthe extension of slavery to new regions, and the increase of slave\r\nterritory. If, then, in the 7th of March speech, he was inconsistent with\r\nhis past, such inconsistency must appear, if at all, in his general tone in\r\nregard to slavery, in his views as to the policy of compromise, and in his\r\nattitude toward the extension of slavery, the really crucial question of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nAs to the first point, there can be no doubt that there is a vast\r\ndifference between the tone of the Plymouth oration and the Boston memorial\r\ntoward slavery and the slave-trade, and that of the 7th of March speech in\r\nregard to the same subjects. For many years Mr. Webster had had but little\r\nto say against slavery as a system, but in the 7th of March speech, in\r\nreviewing the history of slavery, he treats the matter in such a very calm\r\nmanner, that he not only makes the best case possible for the South, but\r\nhis tone is almost apologetic when speaking in their behalf. To the\r\ngrievances of the South he devotes more than five pages of his speech, to\r\nthose of the North less than two. As to the infamy of making the national\r\ncapital a great slave-mart, he has nothing to say--although it was a matter\r\nwhich figured as one of the elements in Mr. Clay's scheme.\r\n\r\nBut what most shocked the North in this connection were his utterances in\r\nregard to the Fugitive Slave Law. There can be no doubt that under the\r\nConstitution the South had a perfect right to claim the extradition of\r\nfugitive slaves. The legal argument in support of that right was excellent,\r\nbut the Northern people could not feel that it was necessary for Daniel\r\nWebster to make it. The Fugitive Slave Law was in absolute conflict with\r\nthe awakened conscience and moral sentiment of the North. To strengthen\r\nthat law, and urge its enforcement, was a sure way to make the resistance\r\nto it still more violent and intolerant. Constitutions and laws will\r\nprevail over much, and allegiance to them is a high duty, but when they\r\ncome into conflict with a deep-rooted moral sentiment, and with the\r\nprinciples of liberty and humanity, they must be modified, or else they\r\nwill be broken to pieces. That this should have been the case in 1850 was\r\nno doubt to be regretted, but it was none the less a fact. To insist upon\r\nthe constitutional duty of returning fugitive slaves, to upbraid the North\r\nwith their opposition, and to urge upon them and upon the country the\r\nstrict enforcement of the extradition law, was certain to embitter and\r\nintensify the opposition to it. The statesmanlike course was to recognize\r\nthe ground of Northern resistance, to show the South that a too violent\r\ninsistence upon their constitutional rights would be fatal, and to endeavor\r\nto obtain such concessions as would allay excited feelings. Mr. Webster's\r\nstrong argument in favor of the Fugitive Slave Law pleased the South, of\r\ncourse; but it irritated and angered the North. It promoted the very\r\nstruggle which it proposed to allay, for it admitted the existence of only\r\none side to the question. The consciences of men cannot be coerced; and\r\nwhen Mr. Webster undertook to do it he dashed himself against the rocks.\r\nPeople did not stop to distinguish between a legal argument and a defence\r\nof the merits of catching runaway slaves. To refer to the original law of\r\n1793 was idle. Public opinion had changed in half a century; and what had\r\nseemed reasonable at the close of the eighteenth century was monstrous in\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nAll this Mr. Webster declined to recognize. He upheld without diminution or\r\nmodification the constitutional duty of sending escaping slaves back to\r\nbondage; and from the legal soundness of this position there is no escape.\r\nThe trouble was that he had no word to say against the cruelty and\r\nbarbarity of the system. To insist upon the necessity of submitting to the\r\nhard and repulsive duty imposed by the Constitution was one thing. To urge\r\nsubmission without a word of sorrow or regret was another. The North felt,\r\nand felt rightly, that while Mr. Webster could not avoid admitting the\r\nforce of the constitutional provisions about fugitive slaves, and was\r\nobliged to bow to their behest, yet to defend them without reservation, to\r\nattack those who opposed them, and to urge the rigid enforcement of a\r\nFugitive Slave Law, was not in consonance with his past, his conscience,\r\nand his duty to his constituents. The constitutionality of a Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw may be urged and admitted over and over again, but this could not make\r\nthe North believe that advocacy of slave-catching was a task suited to\r\nDaniel Webster. The simple fact was that he did not treat the general\r\nquestion of slavery as he always had treated it. Instead of denouncing and\r\ndeploring it, and striking at it whenever the Constitution permitted, he\r\napologized for its existence, and urged the enforcement of its most\r\nobnoxious laws. This was not his attitude in 1820; this was not what the\r\npeople of the North expected of him in 1850.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the policy of compromise there is a much stronger contrast\r\nbetween Mr. Webster's attitude in 1850 and his earlier course than in the\r\ncase of his views on the general subject of slavery. In 1819, although not\r\nin public life, Mr. Webster, as is clear from the tone of the Boston\r\nmemorial, was opposed to any compromise involving an extension of slavery.\r\nIn 1832-33 he was the most conspicuous and unyielding enemy of the\r\nprinciple of compromise in the country. He then took the ground that the\r\ntime had come to test the strength of the Constitution and the Union, and\r\nthat any concession would have a fatally weakening effect. In 1850 he\r\nsupported a compromise which was so one-sided that it hardly deserves the\r\nname. The defence offered by his friends on this subject--and it is the\r\nstrongest point they have been able to make--is that these sacrifices, or\r\ncompromises, were necessary to save the Union, and that--although they did\r\nnot prevent ultimate secession--they caused a delay of ten years, which\r\nenabled the North to gather sufficient strength to carry the civil war to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. It is not difficult to show historically that the\r\npolicy of compromise between the national principle and unlawful opposition\r\nto that principle was an entire mistake from the very outset, and that if\r\nillegal and partisan State resistance had always been put down with a firm\r\nhand, civil war might have been avoided. Nothing strengthened the general\r\ngovernment more than the well-judged and well-timed display of force by\r\nwhich Washington and Hamilton crushed the Whiskey Rebellion, or than the\r\nhappy accident of peace in 1814, which brought the separatist movement in\r\nNew England to a sudden end. After that period Mr. Clay's policy of\r\ncompromise prevailed, and the result was that the separatist movement was\r\nidentified with the maintenance of slavery, and steadily gathered strength.\r\nIn 1819 the South threatened and blustered in order to prevent the complete\r\nprohibition of slavery in the Louisiana purchase. In 1832 South Carolina\r\npassed the nullification ordinance because she suffered by the operation of\r\na protective tariff. In 1850 a great advance had been made in their\r\npretensions. Secession was threatened because the South feared that the\r\nMexican conquests would not be devoted to the service of slavery. Nothing\r\nhad been done, nothing was proposed even, prejudicial to Southern\r\ninterests; but the inherent weakness of slavery, and the mild conciliatory\r\nattitude of Northern statesmen, incited the South to make imperious demands\r\nfor favors, and seek for positive gains. They succeeded in 1850, and in\r\n1860 they had reached the point at which they were ready to plunge the\r\ncountry into the horrors of civil war solely because they lost an\r\nelection. They believed, first, that the North would yield everything for\r\nthe sake of union, and secondly, that if there was a limit to their\r\ncapacity for surrender in this direction, yet a people capable of so much\r\nsubmission in the past would never fight to maintain the Union. The South\r\nmade a terrible mistake, and was severely punished for it; but the\r\ncompromises of 1820, 1833, and 1850 furnished some excuse for the wild idea\r\nthat the North would not and could not fight. Whether a strict adherence to\r\nthe strong, fearless policy of Hamilton, which was adopted by Jackson and\r\nadvocated by Webster in 1832-33, would have prevented civil war, must, of\r\ncourse, remain matter of conjecture. It is at least certain that in that\r\nway alone could war have been avoided, and that the Clay policy of\r\ncompromise made war inevitable by encouraging slave-holders to believe that\r\nthey could always obtain anything they wanted by a sufficient show of\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nIt is urged, however, that the policy of compromise having been adopted, a\r\nchange in 1850 would have simply precipitated the sectional conflict. In\r\njudging Mr. Webster, the practical question, of course, is as to the best\r\nmethod of dealing with matters as they actually were and not as they might\r\nhave been had a different course been pursued in 1820 and 1832. The\r\npartisans of Mr. Webster have always taken the ground that in 1850 the\r\nchoice was between compromise and secession; that the events of 1861 showed\r\nthat the South, in 1850, was not talking for mere effect; that the\r\nmaintenance of the Union was the paramount consideration of a patriotic\r\nstatesman; and that the only practicable and proper course was to\r\ncompromise. Admitting fully that Mr. Webster's first and highest duty was\r\nto preserve the Union, it is perfectly clear now, when all these events\r\nhave passed into history, that he took the surest way to make civil war\r\ninevitable, and that the position of 1832 should not have been abandoned.\r\nIn the first place, the choice was not confined to compromise or secession.\r\nThe President, the official head of the Whig party, had recommended the\r\nadmission of California, as the only matter actually requiring immediate\r\nsettlement, and that the other questions growing out of the new territories\r\nshould be dealt with as they arose. Mr. Curtis, Mr. Webster's biographer,\r\nsays this was an impracticable plan, because peace could not be kept\r\nbetween New Mexico and Texas, and because there was great excitement about\r\nthe slavery question throughout the country. These seem very insufficient\r\nreasons, and only the first has any practical bearing on the matter.\r\nGeneral Taylor said: Admit California, for that is an immediate and\r\npressing duty, and I will see to it that peace is preserved on the Texan\r\nboundary. Zachary Taylor may not have been a great statesman, but he was a\r\nbrave and skilful soldier, and an honest man, resolved to maintain the\r\nUnion, even if he had to shoot a few Texans to do it. His policy was bold\r\nand manly, and the fact that it was said to have been inspired by Mr.\r\nSeward, a leader in the only Northern party which had any real principle to\r\nfight for, does not seem such a monstrous idea as it did in 1850 or does\r\nstill to those who sustain Mr. Webster's action. That General Taylor's\r\npolicy was not so wild and impracticable as Mr. Webster's friends would\r\nhave us think, is shown by the fact that Mr. Benton, Democrat and\r\nSoutherner as he was, but imbued with the vigor of the Jackson school,\r\nbelieved that each question should be taken up by itself and settled on its\r\nown merits. A policy which seemed wise to three such different men as\r\nTaylor, Seward, and Benton, could hardly have been so utterly impracticable\r\nand visionary as Mr. Webster's partisans would like the world to believe.\r\nIt was in fact one of the cases which that extremely practical statesman\r\nNicolo Machiavelli had in mind when he wrote that, \"Dangers that are seen\r\nafar off are easily prevented; but protracting till they are near at hand,\r\nthe remedies grow unseasonable and the malady incurable.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be readily admitted that there was a great and perilous political\r\ncrisis in 1850, as Mr. Webster said. In certain quarters, in the excitement\r\nof party strife, there was a tendency to deride Mr. Webster as a\r\n\"Union-saver,\" and to take the ground that there had been no real danger of\r\nsecession. This, as we can see now very plainly, was an unfounded idea.\r\nWhen Congress met, the danger of secession was very real, although perhaps\r\nnot very near. The South, although they intended to secede as a last\r\nresort, had no idea that they should be brought to that point. Menaces of\r\ndisunion, ominous meetings and conventions, they probably calculated, would\r\neffect their purpose and obtain for them what they wanted, and subsequent\r\nevents proved that they were perfectly right in this opinion. On February\r\n14 Mr. Webster wrote to Mr. Harvey:--\r\n\r\n     \"I do not partake in any degree in those apprehensions which you\r\n     say some of our friends entertain of the dissolution of the Union\r\n     or the breaking up of the government. I am mortified, it is true,\r\n     at the violent tone assumed here by many persons, because such\r\n     violence in debate only leads to irritation, and is, moreover,\r\n     discreditable to the government and the country. But there is no\r\n     serious danger, be assured, and so assure our friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day he wrote to Mr. Furness, a leader of the anti-slavery party,\r\nexpressing his abhorrence of slavery as an institution, his unwillingness\r\nto break up the existing political system to secure its abolition, and his\r\nbelief that the whole matter must be left with Divine Providence. It is\r\nclear from this letter that he had dismissed any thought of assuming an\r\naggressive attitude toward slavery, but there is nothing to indicate that\r\nhe thought the Union could be saved from wreck only by substantial\r\nconcessions to the South. Between the date of the letter to Harvey and\r\nMarch 7, Mr. Curtis says that the aspect of affairs had materially changed,\r\nand that the Union was in serious peril. There is nothing to show that Mr.\r\nWebster thought so, or that he had altered the opinion which he had\r\nexpressed on February 14. In fact, Mr. Curtis's view is the exact reverse\r\nof the true state of affairs. If there was any real and immediate danger to\r\nthe Union, it existed on February 14, and ceased immediately afterwards, on\r\nFebruary 16, as Dr. Von Holst correctly says, when the House of\r\nRepresentatives laid on the table the resolution of Mr. Root of Ohio,\r\nprohibiting the extension of slavery to the territories. By that vote, the\r\nvictory was won by the slave-power, and the peril of speedy disunion\r\nvanished. Nothing remained but to determine how much the South would get\r\nfrom their victory, and how hard a bargain they could drive. The admission\r\nof California was no more of a concession than a resolution not to\r\nintroduce slavery in Massachusetts would have been. All the rest of the\r\ncompromise plan, with the single exception of the prohibition of the\r\nslave-trade in the District of Columbia, was made up of concessions to the\r\nSouthern and slave-holding interest. That Henry Clay should have\r\noriginated and advocated this scheme was perfectly natural. However wrong\r\nor mistaken, this had been his steady and unbroken policy from the outset,\r\nas the best method of preserving the Union and advancing the cause of\r\nnationality. Mr. Clay was consistent and sincere, and, however much he may\r\nhave erred in his general theory, he never swerved from it. But with Mr.\r\nWebster the case was totally different. He had opposed the principle of\r\ncompromise from the beginning, and in 1833, when concession was more\r\nreasonable than in 1850, he had offered the most strenuous and unbending\r\nresistance. Now he advocated a compromise which was in reality little less\r\nthan a complete surrender on the part of the North. On the general question\r\nof compromise he was, of course, grossly inconsistent, and the history of\r\nthe time, as it appears in the cold light of the present day, shows plainly\r\nthat, while he was brave and true and wise in 1833, in 1850 he was not only\r\ninconsistent, but that he erred deeply in policy and statesmanship. It has\r\nalso been urged in behalf of Mr. Webster that he went no farther than the\r\nRepublicans in 1860 in the way of concession, and that as in 1860 so in\r\n1850, anything was permissible which served to gain time. In the first\r\nplace, the _tu quoque_ argument proves nothing and has no weight. In the\r\nsecond place, the situations in 1850 and in 1860 were very different.\r\n\r\nThere were at the former period, in reference to slavery, four parties in\r\nthe country--the Democrats, the Free-Soilers, the Abolitionists, and the\r\nWhigs. The three first had fixed and widely-varying opinions; the last was\r\ntrying to live without opinions, and soon died. The pro-slavery Democrats\r\nwere logical and practical; the Abolitionists were equally logical but\r\nthoroughly impracticable and unconstitutional, avowed nullifiers and\r\nsecessionists; the Free-Soilers were illogical, constitutional, and\r\nperfectly practical. As Republicans, the Free-Soilers proved the\r\ncorrectness and good sense of their position by bringing the great majority\r\nof the Northern people to their support. But at the same time their\r\nposition was a difficult one, for while they were an anti-slavery party and\r\nhad set on foot constitutional opposition to the extension of slavery,\r\ntheir fidelity to the Constitution compelled them to admit the legality of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law and of slavery in the States. They aimed, of course,\r\nfirst to check the extension of slavery and then to efface it by gradual\r\nrestriction and full compensation to slave-holders. When they had carried\r\nthe country in 1860, they found themselves face to face with a breaking\r\nUnion and an impending war. That many of them were seriously frightened,\r\nand, to avoid war and dissolution, would have made great concessions,\r\ncannot be questioned; but their controlling motive was to hold things\r\ntogether by any means, no matter how desperate, until they could get\r\npossession of the government. This was the only possible and the only wise\r\npolicy, but that it involved them in some contradictions in that winter of\r\nexcitement and confusion is beyond doubt. History will judge the men and\r\nevents of 1860 according to the circumstances of the time, but nothing that\r\nhappened then has any bearing on Mr. Webster's conduct. He must be judged\r\naccording to the circumstances of 1850, and the first and most obvious fact\r\nis, that he was not fighting merely to gain time and obtain control of the\r\ngeneral government. The crisis was grave and serious in the extreme, but\r\nneither war nor secession were imminent or immediate, nor did Mr. Webster\r\never assert that they were. He thought war and secession might come, and it\r\nwas against this possibility and probability that he sought to provide. He\r\nwished to solve the great problem, to remove the source of danger, to set\r\nthe menacing agitation at rest. He aimed at an enduring and definite\r\nsettlement, and that was the purpose of the 7th of March speech. His\r\nreasons--and of course they were clear and weighty in his own\r\nmind--proceeded from the belief that this wretched compromise measure\r\noffered a wise, judicious, and permanent settlement of questions which, in\r\ntheir constant recurrence, threatened more and more the stability of the\r\nUnion. History has shown how wofully mistaken he was in this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe last point to be considered in connection with the 7th of March speech\r\nis the ground then taken by Mr. Webster with reference to the extension of\r\nslavery. To this question the speech was chiefly directed, and it is the\r\nportion which has aroused the most heated discussion. What Mr. Webster's\r\nviews had always been on the subject of slavery extension every one knew\r\nthen and knows now. He had been the steady and uncompromising opponent of\r\nthe Southern policy, and in season and out of season, sometimes vehemently\r\nsometimes gently, but always with firmness and clearness, he had declared\r\nagainst it. The only question is, whether he departed from these\r\noften-expressed opinions on the 7th of March. In the speech itself he\r\ndeclared that he had not abated one jot in his views in this respect, and\r\nhe argued at great length to prove his consistency, which, if it were to be\r\neasily seen of men, certainly needed neither defence nor explanation. The\r\ncrucial point was, whether, in organizing the new territories, the\r\nprinciple of the Wilmot Proviso should be adopted as part of the measure.\r\nThis famous proviso Mr. Webster had declared in 1847 to represent exactly\r\nhis own views. He had then denied that the idea was the invention of any\r\none man, and scouted the notion that on this doctrine there could be any\r\ndifference of opinion among Whigs. On March 7 he announced that he would\r\nnot have the proviso attached to the territorial bills, and should oppose\r\nany effort in that direction. The reasons he gave for this apparent change\r\nwere, that nature had forbidden slavery in the newly-conquered regions, and\r\nthat the proviso, under such circumstances, would be a useless taunt and\r\nwanton insult to the South. The famous sentence in which he said that he\r\n\"would not take pains uselessly to reaffirm an ordinance of nature, nor to\r\nreënact the will of God,\" was nothing but specious and brilliant rhetoric.\r\nIt was perfectly easy to employ slaves in California, if the people had not\r\nprohibited it, and in New Mexico as well, even if there were no cotton nor\r\nsugar nor rice plantations in either, and but little arable land in the\r\nlatter. There was a classic form of slave-labor possible in those\r\ncountries. Any school-boy could have reminded Mr. Webster of\r\n\r\n    \"Seius whose eight hundred slaves\r\n    Sicken in Ilva's mines.\"\r\n\r\nMining was one of the oldest uses to which slave-labor had been applied,\r\nand it still flourished in Siberia as the occupation of serfs and\r\ncriminals. Mr. Webster, of course, was not ignorant of this very obvious\r\nfact; and that nature, therefore, instead of forbidding slave-labor in the\r\nMexican conquests, opened to it a new and almost unlimited field in a\r\nregion which is to-day one of the greatest mining countries in the world.\r\nStill less could he have failed to know that this form of employment for\r\nslaves was eagerly desired by the South; that the slave-holders fully\r\nrecognized their opportunity, announced their intention of taking\r\nadvantage of it, and were particularly indignant at the action of\r\nCalifornia because it had closed to them this inviting field. Mr. Clingman\r\nof North Carolina, on January 22, when engaged in threatening war in order\r\nto bring the North to terms, had said, in the House of Representatives:\r\n\"But for the anti-slavery agitation our Southern slave-holders would have\r\ncarried their negroes into the mines of California in such numbers that I\r\nhave no doubt but that the majority there would have made it a\r\nslave-holding State.\"[1] At a later period Mr. Mason of Virginia declared,\r\nin the Senate, that he knew of no law of nature which excluded slavery from\r\nCalifornia. \"On the contrary,\" he said, \"if California had been organized\r\nwith a territorial form of government only, the people of the Southern\r\nStates would have gone there freely, and have taken their slaves there in\r\ngreat numbers. They would have done so because the value of the labor of\r\nthat class would have been augmented to them many hundred fold.\"[2] These\r\nwere the views of practical men and experienced slave-owners who\r\nrepresented the opinions of their constituents, and who believed that\r\ndomestic slavery could be employed to advantage anywhere. Moreover, the\r\nSouthern leaders openly avowed their opposition to securing any region to\r\nfree labor exclusively, no matter what the ordinances of nature might be.\r\nIn 1848, it must be remembered in this connection, Mr. Webster not only\r\nurged the limitation of slave area, and sustained the power of Congress to\r\nregulate this matter in the territories, but he did not resist the final\r\nembodiment of the principle of the Wilmot Proviso in the bill for the\r\norganization of Oregon, where the introduction of slavery was infinitely\r\nmore unlikely than in New Mexico. Cotton, sugar, and rice were excluded,\r\nperhaps, by nature from the Mexican conquests, but slavery was not. It was\r\nworse than idle to allege that a law of nature forbade slaves in a country\r\nwhere mines gaped to receive them. The facts are all as plain as possible,\r\nand there is no escape from the conclusion that in opposing the Wilmot\r\nProviso, in 1850, Mr. Webster abandoned his principles as to the extension\r\nof slavery. He practically stood forth as the champion of the Southern\r\npolicy of letting the new territories alone, which could only result in\r\nplacing them in the grasp of slavery. The consistency which he labored so\r\nhard to prove in his speech was hopelessly shattered, and no ingenuity,\r\neither then or since, can restore it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Congressional Globe_, 31st Congress, 1st Session, p. 203.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid., Appendix, p. 510.]\r\n\r\nA dispassionate examination of Mr. Webster's previous course on slavery,\r\nand a careful comparison of it with the ground taken in the 7th of March\r\nspeech, shows that he softened his utterances in regard to slavery as a\r\nsystem, and that he changed radically on the policy of compromise and on\r\nthe question of extending the area of slavery. There is a confused story\r\nthat in the winter of 1847-48 he had given the anti-slavery leaders to\r\nunderstand that he proposed to come out on their ground in regard to\r\nMexico, and to sustain Corwin in his attack on the Democratic policy, but\r\nthat he failed to do so. The evidence on this point is entirely\r\ninsufficient to make it of importance, but there can be no doubt that in\r\nthe winter of 1850 Mr. Webster talked with Mr. Giddings, and led him, and\r\nthe other Free-Soil leaders, to believe that he was meditating a strong\r\nanti-slavery speech. This fact was clearly shown in the recent newspaper\r\ncontroversy which grew out of the celebration of the centennial anniversary\r\nof Webster's birth. It is a little difficult to understand why this\r\nincident should have roused such bitter resentment among Mr. Webster's\r\nsurviving partisans. To suppose that Mr. Webster made the 7th of March\r\nspeech after long deliberation, without having a moment's hesitation in the\r\nmatter, is to credit him with a shameless disregard of principle and\r\nconsistency, of which it is impossible to believe him guilty. He\r\nundoubtedly hesitated, and considered deeply whether he should assume the\r\nattitude of 1833, and stand out unrelentingly against the encroachments of\r\nslavery. He talked with Mr. Clay on one side. He talked with Mr. Giddings,\r\nand other Free-Soilers, on the other. With the latter the wish was no\r\ndoubt father to the thought, and they may well have imagined that Mr.\r\nWebster had determined to go with them, when he was still in doubt and\r\nmerely trying the various positions. There is no need, however, to linger\r\nover matters of this sort. The change made by Mr. Webster can be learned\r\nbest by careful study of his own utterances, and of his whole career. Yet,\r\nat the same time, the greatest trouble lies not in the shifting and\r\ninconsistency revealed by an examination of the specific points which have\r\njust been discussed, but in the speech as a whole. In that speech Mr.\r\nWebster failed quite as much by omissions as by the opinions which he\r\nactually announced. He was silent when he should have spoken, and he spoke\r\nwhen he should have held his peace. The speech, if exactly defined, is, in\r\nreality, a powerful effort, not for compromise or for the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, or any other one thing, but to arrest the whole anti-slavery movement,\r\nand in that way put an end to the dangers which threatened the Union and\r\nrestore lasting harmony between the jarring sections. It was a mad project.\r\nMr. Webster might as well have attempted to stay the incoming tide at\r\nMarshfield with a rampart of sand as to seek to check the anti-slavery\r\nmovement by a speech. Nevertheless, he produced a great effect. His mind\r\nonce made up, he spared nothing to win the cast. He gathered all his\r\nforces; his great intellect, his splendid eloquence, his fame which had\r\nbecome one of the treasured possessions of his country,--all were given to\r\nthe work. The blow fell with terrible force, and here, at last, we come to\r\nthe real mischief which was wrought. The 7th of March speech demoralized\r\nNew England and the whole North. The abolitionists showed by bitter anger\r\nthe pain, disappointment, and dismay which this speech brought. The\r\nFree-Soil party quivered and sank for the moment beneath the shock. The\r\nwhole anti-slavery movement recoiled. The conservative reaction which Mr.\r\nWebster endeavored to produce came and triumphed. Chiefly by his exertions\r\nthe compromise policy was accepted and sustained by the country. The\r\nconservative elements everywhere rallied to his support, and by his ability\r\nand eloquence it seemed as if he had prevailed and brought the people over\r\nto his opinions. It was a wonderful tribute to his power and influence, but\r\nthe triumph was hollow and short-lived. He had attempted to compass an\r\nimpossibility. Nothing could kill the principles of human liberty, not even\r\na speech by Daniel Webster, backed by all his intellect and knowledge, his\r\neloquence and his renown. The anti-slavery movement was checked for the\r\ntime, and pro-slavery democracy, the only other positive political force,\r\nreigned supreme. But amid the falling ruins of the Whig party, and the\r\nevanescent success of the Native Americans, the party of human rights\r\nrevived; and when it rose again, taught by the trials and misfortunes of\r\n1850, it rose with a strength which Mr. Webster had never dreamed of, and,\r\nin 1856, polled nearly a million and a half of votes for Fremont. The rise\r\nand final triumph of the Republican party was the condemnation of the 7th\r\nof March speech and of the policy which put the government of the country\r\nin the hands of Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. When the war came,\r\ninspiration was not found in the 7th of March speech. In that dark hour,\r\nmen remembered the Daniel Webster who replied to Hayne, and turned away\r\nfrom the man who had sought for peace by advocating the great compromise of\r\nHenry Clay.\r\n\r\nThe disapprobation and disappointment which were manifested in the North\r\nafter the 7th of March speech could not be overlooked. Men thought and said\r\nthat Mr. Webster had spoken in behalf of the South and of slavery. Whatever\r\nhis intentions may have been, this was what the speech seemed to mean and\r\nthis was its effect, and the North saw it more and more clearly as time\r\nwent on. Mr. Webster never indulged in personal attacks, but at the same\r\ntime he was too haughty a man ever to engage in an exchange of compliments\r\nin debate. He never was in the habit of saying pleasant things to his\r\nopponents in the Senate merely as a matter of agreeable courtesy. In this\r\ndirection, as in its opposite, he usually maintained a cold silence. But\r\non the 7th of March he elaborately complimented Calhoun, and went out of\r\nhis way to flatter Virginia and Mr. Mason personally. This struck close\r\nobservers with surprise, but it was the real purpose of the speech which\r\nwent home to the people of the North. He had advocated measures which with\r\nslight exceptions were altogether what the South wanted, and the South so\r\nunderstood it. On the 30th of March Mr. Morehead wrote to Mr. Crittenden\r\nthat Mr. Webster's appointment as Secretary of State would now be very\r\nacceptable to the South. No more bitter commentary could have been made.\r\nThe people were blinded and dazzled at first, but they gradually awoke and\r\nperceived the error that had been committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, however, needed nothing from outside to inform him as to his\r\nconduct and its results. At the bottom of his heart and in the depths of\r\nhis conscience he knew that he had made a dreadful mistake. He did not\r\nflinch. He went on in his new path without apparent faltering. His speech\r\non the compromise measures went farther than that of the 7th of March. But\r\nif we study his speeches and letters between 1850 and the day of his death,\r\nwe can detect changes in them, which show plainly enough that the writer\r\nwas not at ease, that he was not master of that real conscience of which he\r\nboasted.\r\n\r\nHis friends, after the first shock of surprise, rallied to his support,\r\nand he spoke frequently at union meetings, and undertook, by making immense\r\nefforts, to convince the country that the compromise measures were right\r\nand necessary, and that the doctrines of the 7th of March speech ought to\r\nbe sustained. In pursuance of this object, during the winter of 1850 and\r\nthe summer of the following year, he wrote several public letters on the\r\ncompromise measures, and he addressed great meetings on various occasions,\r\nin New England, New York, and as far south as Virginia. We are at once\r\nstruck by a marked change in the character and tone of these speeches,\r\nwhich produced a great effect in establishing the compromise policy. It had\r\nnever been Mr. Webster's habit to misrepresent or abuse his opponents. Now\r\nhe confounded the extreme separatism of the abolitionists and the\r\nconstitutional opposition of the Free-Soil party, and involved all\r\nopponents of slavery in a common condemnation. It was wilful\r\nmisrepresentation to talk of the Free-Soilers as if they were identical\r\nwith the abolitionists, and no one knew better than Mr. Webster the\r\ndistinction between the two, one being ready to secede to get rid of\r\nslavery, the other offering only a constitutional resistance to its\r\nextension. His tone toward his opponents was correspondingly bitter. When\r\nhe first arrived in Boston, after his speech, and spoke to the great crowd\r\nin front of the Revere House, he said, \"I shall support no agitations\r\nhaving their foundations in unreal, ghostly abstractions.\" Slavery had now\r\nbecome \"an unreal, ghostly abstraction,\" although it must still have\r\nappeared to the negroes something very like a hard fact. There were men in\r\nthat crowd, too, who had not forgotten the noble words with which Mr.\r\nWebster in 1837 had defended the character of the opponents of slavery, and\r\nthe sound of this new gospel from his lips fell strangely on their ears. So\r\nhe goes on from one union meeting to another, and in speech after speech\r\nthere is the same bitter tone which had been so foreign to him in all his\r\nprevious utterances. The supporters of the anti-slavery movement he\r\ndenounces as insane. He reiterates his opposition to slave extension, and\r\nin the same breath argues that the Union must be preserved by giving way to\r\nthe South. The feeling is upon him that the old parties are breaking down\r\nunder the pressure of this \"ghostly abstraction,\" this agitation which he\r\ntries to prove to the young men of the country and to his fellow-citizens\r\neverywhere is \"wholly factitious.\" The Fugitive Slave Law is not in the\r\nform which he wants, but still he defends it and supports it. The first\r\nfruits of his policy of peace are seen in riots in Boston, and he\r\npersonally advises with a Boston lawyer who has undertaken the cases\r\nagainst the fugitive slaves. It was undoubtedly his duty, as Mr. Curtis\r\nsays, to enforce and support the law as the President's adviser, but his\r\npersonal attention and interest were not required in slave cases, nor would\r\nthey have been given a year before. The Wilmot Proviso, that doctrine which\r\nhe claimed as his own in 1847, when it was a sentiment on which Whigs could\r\nnot differ, he now calls \"a mere abstraction.\" He struggles to put slavery\r\naside for the tariff, but it will not down at his bidding, and he himself\r\ncannot leave it alone. Finally he concludes this compromise campaign with a\r\ngreat speech on laying the foundation of the capitol extension, and makes a\r\npathetic appeal to the South to maintain the Union. They are not pleasant\r\nto read, these speeches in the Senate and before the people in behalf of\r\nthe compromise policy. They are harsh and bitter; they do not ring true.\r\nDaniel Webster knew when he was delivering them that that was not the way\r\nto save the Union, or that, at all events, it was not the right way for him\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\nThe same peculiarity can be discerned in his letters. The fun and humor\r\nwhich had hitherto run through his correspondence seems now to fade away as\r\nif blighted. On September 10, 1850, he writes to Mr. Harvey that since\r\nMarch 7 there has not been an hour in which he has not felt a \"crushing\r\nsense of anxiety and responsibility.\" He couples this with the declaration\r\nthat his own part is acted and he is satisfied; but if his anxiety was\r\nsolely of a public nature, why did it date from March 7, when, prior to\r\nthat time, there was much greater cause for alarm than afterwards. In\r\neverything he said or wrote he continually recurs to the slavery question\r\nand always in a defensive tone, usually with a sneer or a fling at the\r\nabolitionists and anti-slavery party. The spirit of unrest had seized him.\r\nHe was disturbed and ill at ease. He never admitted it, even to himself,\r\nbut his mind was not at peace, and he could not conceal the fact. Posterity\r\ncan see the evidences of it plainly enough, and a man of his intellect and\r\nfame knew that with posterity the final reckoning must be made. No man can\r\nsay that Mr. Webster anticipated the unfavorable judgment which his\r\ncountrymen have passed upon his conduct, but that in his heart he feared\r\nsuch a judgment cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine with perfect accuracy any man's motives in\r\nwhat he says or does. They are so complex, they are so often undefined,\r\neven in the mind of the man himself, that no one can pretend to make an\r\nabsolutely correct analysis. There have been many theories as to the\r\nmotives which led Mr. Webster to make the 7th of March speech. In the heat\r\nof contemporary strife his enemies set it down as a mere bid to secure\r\nSouthern support for the presidency, but this is a harsh and narrow view.\r\nThe longing for the presidency weakened Mr. Webster as a public man from\r\nthe time when it first took possession of him after the reply to Hayne. It\r\nundoubtedly had a weakening effect upon him in the winter of 1850, and had\r\nsome influence upon the speech of the 7th of March. But it is unjust to say\r\nthat it did more. It certainly was far removed from being a controlling\r\nmotive. His friends, on the other hand, declare that he was governed solely\r\nby the highest and most disinterested patriotism, by the truest wisdom.\r\nThis explanation, like that of his foes, fails by going too far and being\r\ntoo simple. His motives were mixed. His chief desire was to preserve and\r\nmaintain the Union. He wished to stand forth as the great saviour and\r\npacificator. On the one side was the South, compact, aggressive, bound\r\ntogether by slavery, the greatest political force in the country. On the\r\nother was a weak Free-Soil party, and a widely diffused and earnest moral\r\nsentiment without organization or tangible political power. Mr. Webster\r\nconcluded that the way to save the Union and the Constitution, and to\r\nachieve the success which he desired, was to go with the heaviest\r\nbattalions. He therefore espoused the Southern side, for the compromise was\r\nin the Southern interest, and smote the anti-slavery movement with all his\r\nstrength. He reasoned correctly that peace could come only by administering\r\na severe check to one of the two contending parties. He erred in attempting\r\nto arrest the one which all modern history showed was irresistible. It is\r\nno doubt true, as appears by his cabinet opinion recently printed, that he\r\nstood ready to meet the first overt act on the part of the South with\r\nforce. Mr. Webster would not have hesitated to have struck hard at any body\r\nof men or any State which ventured to assail the Union. But he also\r\nbelieved that the true way to prevent any overt act on the part of the\r\nSouth was by concession, and that was precisely the object which the\r\nSouthern leaders sought to obtain. We may grant all the patriotism and all\r\nthe sincere devotion to the cause of the Constitution which is claimed for\r\nhim, but nothing can acquit Mr. Webster of error in the methods which he\r\nchose to adopt for the maintenance of peace and the preservation of the\r\nUnion. If the 7th of March speech was right, then all that had gone before\r\nwas false and wrong. In that speech he broke from his past, from his own\r\nprinciples and from the principles of New England, and closed his splendid\r\npublic career with a terrible mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the remainder of Mr. Webster's public life, outside of and\r\napart from the slavery question, can be quickly told. General Taylor died\r\nsuddenly on July 9, 1850, and this event led to an immediate and complete\r\nreorganization of the cabinet. Mr. Fillmore at once offered the post of\r\nSecretary of State to Mr. Webster, who accepted it, resigned his seat in\r\nthe Senate, and, on July 23, assumed his new position. No great negotiation\r\nlike that with Lord Ashburton marked this second term of office in the\r\nDepartment of State, but there were a number of important and some very\r\ncomplicated affairs, which Mr. Webster managed with the wisdom, tact, and\r\ndignity which made him so admirably fit for this high position.\r\n\r\nThe best-known incident of this period was that which gave rise to the\r\nfamous \"Hülsemann letter.\" President Taylor had sent an agent to Hungary to\r\nreport upon the condition of the revolutionary government, with the\r\nintention of recognizing it if there were sufficient grounds for doing so.\r\nWhen the agent arrived, the revolution was crushed, and he reported to the\r\nPresident against recognition. These papers were transmitted to the Senate\r\nin March, 1850. Mr. Hülsemann, the Austrian _chargé_, thereupon complained\r\nof the action of our administration, and Mr. Clayton, then Secretary of\r\nState, replied that the mission of the agent had been simply to gather\r\ninformation. On receiving further instructions from his government, Mr.\r\nHülsemann rejoined to Mr. Clayton, and it fell to Mr. Webster to reply,\r\nwhich he did on December 21, 1850. The note of the Austrian _chargé_ was in\r\na hectoring and highly offensive tone, and Mr. Webster felt the necessity\r\nof administering a sharp rebuke. \"The Hülsemann letter,\" as it was called,\r\nwas accordingly dispatched. It set forth strongly the right of the United\r\nStates and their intention to recognize any _de facto_ revolutionary\r\ngovernment, and to seek information in all proper ways in order to guide\r\ntheir action. The argument on this point was admirably and forcibly stated,\r\nand it was accompanied by a bold vindication of the American policy, and by\r\nsome severe and wholesome reproof. Mr. Webster had two objects. One was to\r\nawaken the people of Europe to a sense of the greatness of this country,\r\nthe other to touch the national pride at home. He did both. The foreign\r\nrepresentatives learned a lesson which they never forgot, and which opened\r\ntheir eyes to the fact that we were no longer colonies, and the national\r\npride was also aroused. Mr. Webster admitted that the letter was, in some\r\nrespects, boastful and rough. This was a fair criticism, and it may be\r\njustly said that such a tone was hardly worthy of the author. But, on the\r\nother hand, Hülsemann's impertinence fully justified such a reply, and a\r\nlittle rough domineering was, perhaps, the very thing needed. It is certain\r\nthat the letter fully answered Mr. Webster's purpose, and excited a great\r\ndeal of popular enthusiasm. The affair did not, however, end here. Mr.\r\nHülsemann became very mild, but he soon lost his temper again. Kossuth and\r\nthe refugees in Turkey were brought to this country in a United States\r\nfrigate. The Hungarian hero was received with a burst of enthusiasm that\r\ninduced him to hope for substantial aid, which was, of course, wholly\r\nvisionary. The popular excitement made it difficult for Mr. Webster to\r\nsteer a proper course, but he succeeded, by great tact, in showing his own\r\nsympathy, and, so far as possible, that of the government, for the cause of\r\nHungarian independence and for its leader, without going too far or\r\ncommitting any indiscretion which could justify a breach of international\r\nrelations with Austria. Mr. Webster's course, including a speech at a\r\ndinner in Boston, in which he made an eloquent allusion to Hungary and\r\nKossuth, although carefully guarded, aroused the ire of Mr. Hülsemann, who\r\nleft the country, after writing a letter of indignant farewell to the\r\nSecretary of State. Mr. Webster replied, through Mr. Hunter, with extreme\r\ncoolness, confining himself to an approval of the gentleman selected by Mr.\r\nHülsemann to represent Austria after the latter's departure.\r\n\r\nThe other affairs which occupied Mr. Webster's official attention at this\r\ntime made less noise than that with Austria, but they were more complicated\r\nand some of them far more perilous to the peace of the country. The most\r\nimportant was that growing out of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty in regard to\r\nthe neutrality of the contemplated canal in Nicaragua. This led to a\r\nprolonged correspondence about the protectorate of Great Britain in\r\nNicaragua, and to a withdrawal of her claim to exact port-charges. It is\r\ninteresting to observe the influence which Mr. Webster at once obtained\r\nwith Sir Henry Bulwer and the respect in which he was held by that\r\nexperienced diplomatist. Besides this discussion with England, there was a\r\nsharp dispute with Mexico about the right of way over the Isthmus of\r\nTehuantepec, and the troubles on the Texan boundary before Congress had\r\nacted upon the subject. Then came the Lopez invasion of Cuba, supported by\r\nbodies of volunteers enlisted in the United States, which, by its failure\r\nand its results, involved our government in a number of difficult\r\nquestions. The most serious was the riot at New Orleans, where the Spanish\r\nconsulate was sacked by a mob. To render due reparation for this outrage\r\nwithout wounding the national pride by apparent humiliation was no easy\r\ntask. Mr. Webster settled everything, however, with a judgment, tact, and\r\ndignity which prevented war with Spain and yet excited no resentment at\r\nhome. At a later period, when the Kossuth affair was drawing to an end, the\r\nperennial difficulty about the fisheries revived and was added to our\r\nCentral American troubles with Great Britain, and this, together with the\r\naffair of the Lobos Islands, occupied Mr. Webster's attention, and drew\r\nforth some able and important dispatches during the summer of 1852, in the\r\nlast months of his life.\r\n\r\nWhile the struggle was in progress to convince the country of the value and\r\njustice of the compromise measures and to compel their acceptance, another\r\npresidential election drew on. It was the signal for the last desperate\r\nattempt to obtain the Whig nomination for Mr. Webster, and it seemed at\r\nfirst sight as if the party must finally take up the New England leader.\r\nMr. Clay was wholly out of the race, and his last hour was near. There was\r\nabsolutely no one who, in fame, ability, public services, and experience\r\ncould be compared for one moment with Mr. Webster. The opportunity was\r\nobvious enough; it awakened all Mr. Webster's hopes, and excited the ardor\r\nof his friends. A formal and organized movement, such as had never before\r\nbeen made, was set on foot to promote his candidacy, and a vigorous and\r\nearnest address to the people was issued by his friends in Massachusetts.\r\nThe result demonstrated, if demonstration were needed, that Mr. Webster had\r\nnot, even under the most favorable circumstances, the remotest chance for\r\nthe presidency. His friends saw this plainly enough before the convention\r\nmet, but he himself regarded the great prize as at last surely within his\r\ngrasp. Mr. Choate, who was to lead the Webster delegates, went to\r\nWashington the day before the convention assembled. He called on Mr.\r\nWebster and found him so filled with the belief that he should be nominated\r\nthat it seemed cruel to undeceive him. Mr. Choate, at all events, had not\r\nthe heart for the task, and went back to Baltimore to lead the forlorn hope\r\nwith gallant fidelity and with an eloquence as brilliant if not so grand as\r\nthat of Mr. Webster himself. A majority[1] of the convention divided their\r\nvotes very unequally between Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Webster, the former\r\nreceiving 133, the latter 29, on the first ballot, while General Scott had\r\n131. Forty-five ballots were taken, without any substantial change, and\r\nthen General Scott began to increase his strength, and was nominated on the\r\nfifty-third ballot, receiving 159 votes. Most of General Scott's supporters\r\nwere opposed to resolutions sustaining the compromise measures, while\r\nthose who voted for Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Webster favored that policy.\r\nGeneral Scott owed his nomination to a compromise, which consisted in\r\ninserting in the platform a clause strongly approving Mr. Clay's measures.\r\nMr. Webster expected the Fillmore delegates to come to him, an unlikely\r\nevent when they were so much more numerous than his friends, and, moreover,\r\nthey never showed the slightest inclination to do so. They were chiefly\r\nfrom the South, and as they chose to consider Mr. Fillmore and not his\r\nsecretary the representative of compromise, they reasonably enough expected\r\nthe latter to give way. The desperate stubbornness of Mr. Webster's\r\nadherents resulted in the nomination of Scott. It seemed hard that the\r\nSouthern Whigs should have done so little for Mr. Webster after he had done\r\nand sacrificed so much to advance and defend their interests. But the South\r\nwas practical. In the 7th of March speech they had got from Mr. Webster all\r\nthey could expect or desire. It was quite possible, in fact it was highly\r\nprobable, that, once in the presidency, he could not be controlled or\r\nguided by the slave-power or by any other sectional influence. Mr.\r\nFillmore, inferior in every way to Mr. Webster in intellect, in force, in\r\nreputation, would give them a mild, safe administration and be easily\r\ninfluenced by the South. Mr. Webster had served his turn, and the men\r\nwhose cause he had advocated and whose interests he had protected cast him\r\naside.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Curtis says a \"great majority continued to divide their\r\nvotes between Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Webster.\" The highest number reached by\r\nthe combined Webster and Fillmore votes, on any one ballot, was 162, three\r\nmore than was received on the last ballot by General Scott, who, Mr. Curtis\r\ncorrectly says, obtained only a \"few votes more than the necessary\r\nmajority.\"]\r\n\r\nThe loss of the nomination was a bitter disappointment to Mr. Webster. It\r\nwas the fashion in certain quarters to declare that it killed him, but this\r\nwas manifestly absurd. The most that can be said in this respect was, that\r\nthe excitement and depression caused by his defeat preyed upon his mind and\r\nthereby facilitated the inroads of disease, while it added to the clouds\r\nwhich darkened round him in those last days. But his course of action after\r\nthe convention cannot be passed over without comment. He refused to give\r\nhis adhesion to General Scott's nomination, and he advised his friends to\r\nvote for Mr. Pierce, because the Whigs were divided, while the Democrats\r\nwere unanimously determined to resist all attempts to renew the slavery\r\nagitation. This course was absolutely indefensible. If the Whig party was\r\nso divided on the slavery question that Mr. Webster could not support their\r\nnominee, then he had no business to seek a nomination at their hands, for\r\nthey were as much divided before the convention as afterwards. He chose to\r\ncome before that convention, knowing perfectly well the divisions of the\r\nparty, and that the nomination might fall to General Scott. He saw fit to\r\nplay the game, and was in honor bound to abide by the rules. He had no\r\nright to say \"it is heads I win, and tails you lose.\" If he had been\r\nnominated he would have indignantly and justly denounced a refusal on the\r\npart of General Scott and his friends to support him. It is the merest\r\nsophistry to say that Mr. Webster was too great a man to be bound by party\r\nusages, and that he owed it to himself to rise above them, and refuse his\r\nsupport to a poor nomination and to a wrangling party. If Mr. Webster could\r\nno longer act with the Whigs, then his name had no business in that\r\nconvention at Baltimore, for the conditions were the same before its\r\nmeeting as afterward. Great man as he was, he was not too great to behave\r\nhonorably; and his refusal to support Scott, after having been his rival\r\nfor a nomination at the hands of their common party, was neither honorable\r\nnor just. If Mr. Webster had decided to leave the Whigs and act\r\nindependently, he was in honor bound to do so before the Baltimore\r\nconvention assembled, or to have warned the delegates that such was his\r\nintention in the event of General Scott's nomination. He had no right to\r\nstand the hazard of the die, and then refuse to abide by the result. The\r\nWhig party, in its best estate, was not calculated to excite a very warm\r\nenthusiasm in the breast of a dispassionate posterity, and it is perfectly\r\ntrue that it was on the eve of ruin in 1852. But it appeared better then,\r\nin the point of self-respect, than four years before. In 1848 the Whigs\r\nnominated a successful soldier conspicuous only for his availability and\r\nwithout knowing to what party he belonged. They maintained absolute\r\nsilence on the great question of the extension of slavery, and carried on\r\ntheir campaign on the personal popularity of their candidate. Mr. Webster\r\nwas righteously disgusted at their candidate and their negative attitude.\r\nHe could justly and properly have left them on a question of principle; but\r\nhe swallowed the nomination, \"not fit to be made,\" and gave to his party a\r\ndecided and public support. In 1852 the Whigs nominated another successful\r\nsoldier, who was known to be a Whig, and who had been a candidate for their\r\nnomination before. In their platform they formally adopted the essential\r\nprinciple demanded by Mr. Webster, and declared their adhesion to the\r\ncompromise measures. If there was disaffection in regard to this\r\ndeclaration of 1852, there was disaffection also about the silence of 1848.\r\nIn the former case, Mr. Webster adhered to the nomination; in the latter,\r\nhe rejected it. In 1848 he might still hope to be President through a Whig\r\nnomination. In 1852 he knew that, even if he lived, there would never be\r\nanother chance. He gave vent to his disappointment, put no constraint upon\r\nhimself, prophesied the downfall of his party, and advised his friends to\r\nvote for Franklin Pierce. It was perfectly logical, after advocating the\r\ncompromise measures, to advise giving the government into the hands of a\r\nparty controlled by the South. Mr. Webster would have been entirely\r\nreasonable in taking such a course before the Baltimore convention. He had\r\nno right to do so after he had sought a nomination from the Whigs, and it\r\nwas a breach of faith to act as he did, to advise his friends to desert a\r\nfalling party and vote for the Democratic candidate.\r\n\r\nAfter the acceptance of the Department of State, Mr. Webster's health\r\nbecame seriously impaired. His exertions in advocating the compromise\r\nmeasures, his official labors, and the increased severity of his annual\r\nhay-fever,--all contributed to debilitate him. His iron constitution\r\nweakened in various ways, and especially by frequent periods of intense\r\nmental exertion, to which were superadded the excitement and nervous strain\r\ninseparable from his career, was beginning to give way. Slowly but surely\r\nhe lost ground. His spirits began to lose their elasticity, and he rarely\r\nspoke without a tinge of deep sadness being apparent in all he said. In\r\nMay, 1852, while driving near Marshfield, he was thrown from his carriage\r\nwith much violence, injuring his wrists, and receiving other severe\r\ncontusions. The shock was very great, and undoubtedly accelerated the\r\nprogress of the fatal organic disease which was sapping his life. This\r\nphysical injury was followed by the keen disappointment of his defeat at\r\nBaltimore, which preyed upon his heart and mind. During the summer of 1852\r\nhis health gave way more rapidly. He longed to resign, but Mr. Fillmore\r\ninsisted on his retaining his office. In July he came to Boston, where he\r\nwas welcomed by a great public meeting, and hailed with enthusiastic\r\nacclamations, which did much to soothe his wounded feelings. He still\r\ncontinued to transact the business of his department, and in August went to\r\nWashington, where he remained until the 8th of September, when he returned\r\nto Marshfield. On the 20th he went to Boston, for the last time, to consult\r\nhis physician. He appeared at a friend's house, one evening, for a few\r\nmoments, and all who then saw him were shocked at the look of illness and\r\nsuffering in his face. It was his last visit. He went back to Marshfield\r\nthe next day, never to return. He now failed rapidly. His nights were\r\nsleepless, and there were scarcely any intervals of ease or improvement.\r\nThe decline was steady and sure, and as October wore away the end drew\r\nnear. Mr. Webster faced it with courage, cheerfulness, and dignity, in a\r\nreligious and trusting spirit, with a touch of the personal pride which was\r\npart of his nature. He remained perfectly conscious and clear in his mind\r\nalmost to the very last moment, bearing his sufferings with perfect\r\nfortitude, and exhibiting the tenderest affection toward the wife and son\r\nand friends who watched over him. On the evening of October 23 it became\r\napparent that he was sinking, but his one wish seemed to be that he might\r\nbe conscious when he was actually dying. After midnight he roused from an\r\nuneasy sleep, struggled for consciousness, and ejaculated, \"I still live.\"\r\nThese were his last words. Shortly after three o'clock the labored\r\nbreathing ceased, and all was over.\r\n\r\nA hush fell upon the country as the news of his death sped over the land. A\r\ngreat gap seemed to have been made in the existence of every one. Men\r\nremembered the grandeur of his form and the splendor of his intellect, and\r\nfelt as if one of the pillars of the state had fallen. The profound grief\r\nand deep sense of loss produced by his death were the highest tributes and\r\nthe most convincing proofs of his greatness.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his wishes, all public forms and ceremonies were\r\ndispensed with. The funeral took place at his home on Friday, October 29.\r\nThousands flocked to Marshfield to do honor to his memory, and to look for\r\nthe last time at that noble form. It was one of those beautiful days of the\r\nNew England autumn, when the sun is slightly veiled, and a delicate haze\r\nhangs over the sea, shining with a tender silvery light. There is a sense\r\nof infinite rest and peace on such a day which seems to shut out the noise\r\nof the busy world and breathe the spirit of unbroken calm. As the crowds\r\npoured in through the gates of the farm, they saw before them on the lawn,\r\nresting upon a low mound of flowers, the majestic form, as impressive in\r\nthe repose of death as it had been in the fullness of life and strength.\r\nThere was a wonderful fitness in it all. The vault of heaven and the\r\nspacious earth seemed in their large simplicity the true place for such a\r\nman to lie in state. There was a brief and simple service at the house, and\r\nthen the body was borne on the shoulders of Marshfield farmers, and laid in\r\nthe little graveyard which already held the wife and children who had gone\r\nbefore, and where could be heard the eternal murmur of the sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn May, 1852, Mr. Webster said to Professor Silliman: \"I have given my life\r\nto law and politics. Law is uncertain and politics are utterly vain.\" It is\r\na sad commentary for such a man to have made on such a career, but it fitly\r\nrepresents Mr. Webster's feelings as the end of life approached. His last\r\nyears were not his most fortunate, and still less his best years. Domestic\r\nsorrows had been the prelude to a change of policy, which had aroused a\r\nbitter opposition, and to the pangs of disappointed ambition. A sense of\r\nmistake and failure hung heavily upon his spirits, and the cry of \"vanity,\r\nvanity, all is vanity,\" came readily to his lips. There is an infinite\r\npathos in those melancholy words which have just been quoted. The sun of\r\nlife, which had shone so splendidly at its meridian, was setting amid\r\nclouds. The darkness which overspread him came from the action of the 7th\r\nof March, and the conflict which it had caused. If there were failure and\r\nmistake they were there. The presidency could add nothing, its loss could\r\ntake away nothing from the fame of Daniel Webster. He longed for it\r\neagerly; he had sacrificed much to his desire for it; his disappointment\r\nwas keen and bitter at not receiving what seemed to him the fit crown of\r\nhis great public career. But this grief was purely personal, and will not\r\nbe shared by posterity, who feel only the errors of those last years coming\r\nafter so much glory, and who care very little for the defeat of the\r\nambition which went with them.\r\n\r\nThose last two years awakened such fierce disputes, and had such an\r\nabsorbing interest, that they have tended to overshadow the half century of\r\ndistinction and achievement which preceded them. Failure and disappointment\r\non the part of such a man as Webster seem so great, that they too easily\r\ndwarf everything else, and hide from us a just and well proportioned view\r\nof the whole career. Mr. Webster's success had, in truth, been brilliant,\r\nhardly equalled in measure or duration by that of any other eminent man in\r\nour history. For thirty years he had stood at the head of the bar and of\r\nthe Senate, the first lawyer and the first statesman of the United States.\r\nThis is a long tenure of power for one man in two distinct departments. It\r\nwould be remarkable anywhere. It is especially so in a democracy. This\r\ngreat success Mr. Webster owed solely to his intellectual power\r\nsupplemented by great physical gifts. No man ever was born into the world\r\nbetter formed by nature for the career of an orator and statesman. He had\r\neverything to compel the admiration and submission of his fellow-men:--\r\n\r\n           \"The front of Jove himself;\r\n    An eye like Mars to threaten and command;\r\n    A station like the herald Mercury\r\n    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;\r\n    A combination and a form indeed,\r\n    Where every god did seem to set his seal,\r\n    To give the world assurance of a man.\"\r\n\r\nHamlet's words are a perfect picture of Mr. Webster's outer man, and we\r\nhave but to add to the description a voice of singular beauty and power\r\nwith the tone and compass of an organ. The look of his face and the sound\r\nof his voice were in themselves as eloquent as anything Mr. Webster ever\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\nBut the imposing presence was only the outward sign of the man. Within was\r\na massive and powerful intellect, not creative or ingenious, but with a\r\nwonderful vigor of grasp, capacious, penetrating, far-reaching. Mr.\r\nWebster's strongest and most characteristic mental qualities were weight\r\nand force. He was peculiarly fitted to deal with large subjects in a large\r\nway. He was by temperament extremely conservative. There was nothing of the\r\nreformer or the zealot about him. He could maintain or construct where\r\nother men had built; he could not lay new foundations or invent. We see\r\nthis curiously exemplified in his feeling toward Hamilton and Madison. He\r\nadmired them both, and to the former he paid a compliment which has become\r\na familiar quotation. But Hamilton's bold, aggressive genius, his audacity,\r\nfertility, and resource, did not appeal to Mr. Webster as did the prudence,\r\nthe constructive wisdom, and the safe conservatism of the gentle Madison,\r\nwhom he never wearied of praising. The same description may be given of his\r\nimagination, which was warm, vigorous, and keen, but not poetic. He used it\r\nwell, it never led him astray, and was the secret of his most conspicuous\r\noratorical triumphs.\r\n\r\nHe had great natural pride and a strong sense of personal dignity, which\r\nmade him always impressive, but apparently cold, and sometimes solemn in\r\npublic. In his later years this solemnity degenerated occasionally into\r\npomposity, to which it is always perilously near. At no time in his life\r\nwas he quick or excitable. He was indolent and dreamy, working always under\r\npressure, and then at a high rate of speed. This indolence increased as he\r\ngrew older; he would then postpone longer and labor more intensely to make\r\nup the lost time than in his earlier days. When he was quiescent, he seemed\r\nstern, cold, and latterly rather heavy, and some outer incentive was needed\r\nto rouse his intellect or touch his heart. Once stirred, he blazed forth,\r\nand, when fairly engaged, with his intellect in full play, he was as grand\r\nand effective in his eloquence as it is given to human nature to be. In the\r\nless exciting occupations of public life, as, for instance, in foreign\r\nnegotiations, he showed the same grip upon his subject, the same capacity\r\nand judgment as in his speeches, and a mingling of tact and dignity which\r\nproved the greatest fitness for the conduct of the gravest public affairs.\r\nAs a statesman Mr. Webster was not an \"opportunist,\" as it is the fashion\r\nto call those who live politically from day to day, dealing with each\r\nquestion as it arises, and exhibiting often the greatest skill and talent.\r\nStill less was he a statesman of the type of Charles Fox, who preached to\r\nthe deaf ears of one generation great principles which became accepted\r\ntruisms in the next. Mr. Webster stands between the two classes. He viewed\r\nthe present with a strong perception of the future, and shaped his policy\r\nnot merely for the daily exigency, but with a keen eye to subsequent\r\neffects. At the same time he never put forward and defended single-handed a\r\ngreat principle or idea which, neglected then, was gradually to win its way\r\nand reign supreme among a succeeding generation.\r\n\r\nHis speeches have a heat and glow which we can still feel, and a depth and\r\nreality of thought which have secured them a place in literature. He had\r\nnot a fiery nature, although there is often so much warmth in what he said.\r\nHe was neither high tempered nor quick to anger, but he could be fierce,\r\nand, when adulation had warped him in those later years, he was capable of\r\nstriking ugly blows which sometimes wounded friends as well as enemies.\r\n\r\nThere remains one marked quality to be noticed in Mr. Webster, which was of\r\nimmense negative service to him. This was his sense of humor. Mr. Nichol,\r\nin his recent history of American literature, speaks of Mr. Webster as\r\ndeficient in this respect. Either the critic himself is deficient in humor\r\nor he has studied only Webster's collected works, which give no indication\r\nof the real humor in the man. That Mr. Webster was not a humorist is\r\nunquestionably true, and although he used a sarcasm which made his\r\nopponents seem absurd and even ridiculous at times, and in his more\r\nunstudied efforts would provoke mirth by some happy and playful allusion,\r\nsome felicitous quotation or ingenious antithesis, he was too stately in\r\nevery essential respect ever to seek to make mere fun or to excite the\r\nlaughter of his hearers by deliberate exertions and with malice\r\naforethought. He had, nevertheless, a real and genuine sense of humor. We\r\ncan see it in his letters, and it comes out in a thousand ways in the\r\ndetails and incidents of his private life. When he had thrown aside the\r\ncares of professional or public business, he revelled in hearty, boisterous\r\nfun, and he had that sanest of qualities, an honest, boyish love of pure\r\nnonsense. He delighted in a good story and dearly loved a joke, although\r\nno jester himself. This sense of humor and appreciation of the ridiculous,\r\nalthough they give no color to his published works, where, indeed, they\r\nwould have been out of place, improved his judgment, smoothed his path\r\nthrough the world, and saved him from those blunders in taste and those\r\nfollies in action which are ever the pitfalls for men with the fervid,\r\noratorical temperament.\r\n\r\nThis sense of humor gave, also, a great charm to his conversation and to\r\nall social intercourse with him. He was a good, but never, so far as can be\r\njudged from tradition, an overbearing talker. He never appears to have\r\ncrushed opposition in conversation, nor to have indulged in monologue,\r\nwhich is so apt to be the foible of famous and successful men who have a\r\nsolemn sense of their own dignity and importance. What Lord Melbourne said\r\nof the great Whig historian, \"that he wished he was as sure of anything as\r\nTom Macaulay was of everything,\" could not be applied to Mr. Webster. He\r\nowed his freedom from such a weakness partly, no doubt, to his natural\r\nindolence, but still more to the fact that he was not only no pedant, but\r\nnot even a very learned man. He knew no Greek, but was familiar with Latin.\r\nHis quotations and allusions were chiefly drawn from Shakespeare, Milton,\r\nHomer, and the Bible, where he found what most appealed to him--simplicity\r\nand grandeur of thought and diction. At the same time, he was a great\r\nreader, and possessed wide information on a vast variety of subjects, which\r\na clear and retentive memory put always at his command. The result of all\r\nthis was that he was a most charming and entertaining companion.\r\n\r\nThese attractions were heightened by his large nature and strong animal\r\nspirits. He loved outdoor life. He was a keen sportsman and skilful\r\nfisherman. In all these ways he was healthy and manly, without any tinge of\r\nthe mere student or public official. He loved everything that was large.\r\nHis soul expanded in the free air and beneath the blue sky. All natural\r\nscenery appealed to him,--Niagara, the mountains, the rolling prairie, the\r\ngreat rivers,--but he found most contentment beside the limitless sea, amid\r\nbrown marshes and sand-dunes, where the sense of infinite space is\r\nstrongest. It was the same in regard to animals. He cared but little for\r\nhorses or dogs, but he rejoiced in great herds of cattle, and especially in\r\nfine oxen, the embodiment of slow and massive strength. In England the\r\nthings which chiefly appealed to him were the Tower of London, Westminster\r\nAbbey, Smithfield cattle market, and English agriculture. So it was always\r\nand everywhere. He loved mountains and great trees, wide horizons, the\r\nocean, the western plains, and the giant monuments of literature and art.\r\nHe rejoiced in his strength and the overflowing animal vigor that was in\r\nhim. He was so big and so strong, so large in every way, that people sank\r\ninto repose in his presence, and felt rest and confidence in the mere fact\r\nof his existence. He came to be regarded as an institution, and when he\r\ndied men paused with a sense of helplessness, and wondered how the country\r\nwould get on without him. To have filled so large a space in a country so\r\nvast, and in a great, hurrying, and pushing democracy, implies a\r\npersonality of a most uncommon kind.\r\n\r\nHe was, too, something more than a charming companion in private life. He\r\nwas generous, liberal, hospitable, and deeply affectionate. He was adored\r\nin his home, and deeply loved his children, who were torn from him, one\r\nafter another. His sorrow, like his joy, was intense and full of force. He\r\nhad many devoted friends, and a still greater body of unhesitating\r\nfollowers. To the former he showed, through nearly all his life, the warm\r\naffection which was natural to him. It was not until adulation and flattery\r\nhad deeply injured him, and the frustrated ambition for the presidency had\r\npoisoned both heart and mind, that he became dictatorial and overbearing.\r\nNot till then did he quarrel with those who had served and followed him, as\r\nwhen he slighted Mr. Lawrence for expressing independent opinions, and\r\nrefused to do justice to the memory of Story because it might impair his\r\nown glories. They do not present a pleasant picture, these quarrels with\r\nfriends, but they were part of the deterioration of the last years, and\r\nthey furnish in a certain way the key to his failure to attain the\r\npresidency. The country was proud of Mr. Webster; proud of his intellect,\r\nhis eloquence, his fame. He was the idol of the capitalists, the merchants,\r\nthe lawyers, the clergy, the educated men of all classes in the East. The\r\npoliticians dreaded and feared him because he was so great, and so little\r\nin sympathy with them, but his real weakness was with the masses of the\r\npeople. He was not popular in the true sense of the word. For years the\r\nWhig party and Henry Clay were almost synonymous terms, but this could\r\nnever be said of Mr. Webster. His following was strong in quality, but weak\r\nnumerically. Clay touched the popular heart. Webster never did. The people\r\nwere proud of him, wondered at him, were awed by him, but they did not love\r\nhim, and that was the reason he was never President, for he was too great\r\nto succeed to the high office, as many men have, by happy or unhappy\r\naccident. There was also another feeling which is suggested by the\r\ndifferences with some of his closest friends. There was a lurking distrust\r\nof Mr. Webster's sincerity. We can see it plainly in the correspondence of\r\nthe Western Whigs, who were not, perhaps, wholly impartial. But it existed,\r\nnevertheless. There was a vague, ill-defined feeling of doubt in the\r\npublic mind; a suspicion that the spirit of the advocate was the ruling\r\nspirit in Mr. Webster, and that he did not believe with absolute and\r\nfervent faith in one side of any question. There was just enough\r\ncorrectness, just a sufficient grain of truth in this idea, when united\r\nwith the coldness and dignity of his manner and with his greatness itself,\r\nto render impossible that popularity which, to be real and lasting in a\r\ndemocracy, must come from the heart and not from the head of the people,\r\nwhich must be instinctive and emotional, and not the offspring of reason.\r\n\r\nThere is no occasion to discuss, or hold up to reprobation, Mr. Webster's\r\nfailings. He was a splendid animal as well as a great man, and he had\r\nstrong passions and appetites, which he indulged at times to the detriment\r\nof his health and reputation. These errors may be mostly fitly consigned to\r\nsilence. But there was one failing which cannot be passed over in this way.\r\nThis was in regard to money. His indifference to debt was perceptible in\r\nhis youth, and for many years showed no sign of growth. But in his later\r\nyears it increased with terrible rapidity. He earned twenty thousand a year\r\nwhen he first came to Boston,--a very great income for those days. His\r\npublic career interfered, of course, with his law practice, but there never\r\nwas a period when he could not, with reasonable economy, have laid up\r\nsomething at the end of every year, and gradually amassed a fortune. But\r\nhe not only never saved, he lived habitually beyond his means. He did not\r\nbecome poor by his devotion to the public service, but by his own\r\nextravagance. He loved to spend money and to live well. He had a fine\r\nlibrary and handsome plate; he bought fancy cattle; he kept open house, and\r\nindulged in that most expensive of all luxuries, \"gentleman-farming.\" He\r\nnever stinted himself in any way, and he gave away money with reckless\r\ngenerosity and heedless profusion, often not stopping to inquire who the\r\nrecipient of his bounty might be. The result was debt; then subscriptions\r\namong his friends to pay his debts; then a fresh start and more debts, and\r\nmore subscriptions and funds for his benefit, and gifts of money for his\r\ntable, and checks or notes for several thousand dollars in token of\r\nadmiration of the 7th of March speech.[1] This was, of course, utterly\r\nwrong and demoralizing, but Mr. Webster came, after a time, to look upon\r\nsuch transactions as natural and proper. In the Ingersoll debate, Mr.\r\nYancey accused him of being in the pay of the New England manufacturers,\r\nand his biographer has replied to the charge at length. That Mr. Webster\r\nwas in the pay of the manufacturers in the sense that they hired him, and\r\nbade him do certain things, is absurd. That he was maintained and supported\r\nin a large degree by New England manufacturers and capitalists cannot be\r\nquestioned; but his attitude toward them was not that of servant and\r\ndependent. He seems to have regarded the merchants and bankers of State\r\nStreet very much as a feudal baron regarded his peasantry. It was their\r\nprivilege and duty to support him, and he repaid them with an occasional\r\nmagnificent compliment. The result was that he lived in debt and died\r\ninsolvent, and this was not the position which such a man as Daniel Webster\r\nshould have occupied.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The story of the gift of ten thousand dollars in token of\r\nadmiration of the 7th of March speech, referred to by Dr. Von Holst\r\n(_Const. Hist. of the United States_) may be found in a volume entitled,\r\n_In Memoriam, B. Ogle Tayloe_, p. 109, and is as follows: \"My opulent and\r\nmunificent friend and neighbor Mr. William W. Corcoran,\" says Mr. Tayloe,\r\n\"after the perusal of Webster's celebrated March speech in defence of the\r\nConstitution and of Southern rights, inclosed to Mrs. Webster her husband's\r\nnote for ten thousand dollars given him for a loan to that amount. Mr.\r\nWebster met Mr. Corcoran the same evening, at the President's, and thanked\r\nhim for the 'princely favor.' Next day he addressed to Mr. Corcoran a\r\nletter of thanks which I read at Mr. Corcoran's request.\" This version is\r\nsubstantially correct. The morning of March 8 Mr. Corcoran inclosed with a\r\nletter of congratulation some notes of Mr. Webster's amounting to some six\r\nthousand dollars. Reflecting that this was not a very solid tribute, he\r\nopened his letter and put in a check for a thousand dollars, and sent the\r\nnotes and the check to Mr. Webster, who wrote him a letter expressing his\r\ngratitude, which Mr. Tayloe doubtless saw, and which is still in existence.\r\nI give the facts in this way because Mr. George T. Curtis, in a newspaper\r\ninterview, referring to an article of mine in the _Atlantic Monthly_, said,\r\n\"With regard to the story of the ten thousand dollar check, which story Mr.\r\nLodge gives us to understand he found in the pages of that very credulous\r\nwriter Dr. Von Holst, although I have not looked into his volumes to see\r\nwhether he makes the charge, I have only to say that I never heard of such\r\nan occurrence before, and that it would require the oath of a very credible\r\nwitness to the fact to make me believe it.\" I may add that I have taken the\r\ntrouble not only to look into Dr. Von Holst's volumes but to examine the\r\nwhole matter thoroughly. The proof is absolute and indeed it is not\r\nnecessary to go beyond Mr. Webster's own letter of acknowledgment in search\r\nof evidence, were there the slightest reason to doubt the substantial\r\ncorrectness of Mr. Tayloe's statement. The point is a small one, but a\r\nstatement of fact, if questioned, ought always to be sustained or\r\nwithdrawn.]\r\n\r\nHe showed the same indifference to the source of supplies of money in other\r\nways. He took a fee from Wheelock, and then deserted him. He came down to\r\nSalem to prosecute a murderer, and the opposing counsel objected that he\r\nwas brought there to hurry the jury beyond the law and the evidence, and it\r\nwas even murmured audibly in the court-room that he had a fee from the\r\nrelatives of the murdered man in his pocket. A fee of that sort he\r\ncertainly received either then or afterwards. Every ugly public attack that\r\nwas made upon him related to money, and it is painful that the biographer\r\nof such a man as Webster should be compelled to give many pages to show\r\nthat his hero was not in the pay of manufacturers, and did not receive a\r\nbribe in carrying out the provisions of the treaty of Guadaloupe-Hidalgo.\r\nThe refutation may be perfectly successful, but there ought to have been no\r\nneed of it. The reputation of a man like Mr. Webster in money matters\r\nshould have been so far above suspicion that no one would have dreamed of\r\nattacking it. Debts and subscriptions bred the idea that there might be\r\nworse behind, and although there is no reason to believe that such was the\r\ncase, these things are of themselves deplorable enough.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Webster failed it was a moral failure. His moral character was not\r\nequal to his intellectual force. All the errors he ever committed, whether\r\nin public or in private life, in political action or in regard to money\r\nobligations, came from moral weakness. He was deficient in that intensity\r\nof conviction which carries men beyond and above all triumphs of\r\nstatesmanship, and makes them the embodiment of the great moral forces\r\nwhich move the world. If Mr. Webster's moral power had equalled his\r\nintellectual greatness, he would have had no rival in our history. But this\r\ncombination and balance are so rare that they are hardly to be found in\r\nperfection among the sons of men. The very fact of his greatness made his\r\nfailings all the more dangerous and unfortunate. To be blinded by the\r\nsplendor of his fame and the lustre of his achievements and prate about the\r\nsin of belittling a great man is the falsest philosophy and the meanest\r\ncant. The only thing worth having, in history as in life, is truth; and we\r\ndo wrong to our past, to ourselves, and to our posterity if we do not\r\nstrive to render simple justice always. We can forgive the errors and\r\nsorrow for the faults of our great ones gone; we cannot afford to hide or\r\nforget their shortcomings.\r\n\r\nBut after all has been said, the question of most interest is, what Mr.\r\nWebster represented, what he effected, and what he means in our history.\r\nThe answer is simple. He stands to-day as the preëminent champion and\r\nexponent of nationality. He said once, \"there are no Alleghanies in my\r\npolitics,\" and he spoke the exact truth. Mr. Webster was thoroughly\r\nnational. There is no taint of sectionalism or narrow local prejudice about\r\nhim. He towers up as an American, a citizen of the United States in the\r\nfullest sense of the word. He did not invent the Union, or discover the\r\ndoctrine of nationality. But he found the great fact and the great\r\nprinciple ready to his hand, and he lifted them up, and preached the gospel\r\nof nationality throughout the length and breadth of the land. In his\r\nfidelity to this cause he never wavered nor faltered. From the first burst\r\nof boyish oratory to the sleepless nights at Marshfield, when, waiting for\r\ndeath, he looked through the window at the light which showed him the\r\nnational flag fluttering from its staff, his first thought was of a united\r\ncountry. To his large nature the Union appealed powerfully by the mere\r\nsense of magnitude which it conveyed. The vision of future empire, the\r\ndream of the destiny of an unbroken union touched and kindled his\r\nimagination. He could hardly speak in public without an allusion to the\r\ngrandeur of American nationality, and a fervent appeal to keep it sacred\r\nand intact. For fifty years, with reiteration ever more frequent,\r\nsometimes with rich elaboration, sometimes with brief and simple allusion,\r\nhe poured this message into the ears of a listening people. His words\r\npassed into text-books, and became the first declamations of school-boys.\r\nThey were in every one's mouth. They sank into the hearts of the people,\r\nand became unconsciously a part of their life and daily thoughts. When the\r\nhour came, it was love for the Union and the sentiment of nationality which\r\nnerved the arm of the North, and sustained her courage. That love had been\r\nfostered, and that sentiment had been strengthened and vivified by the life\r\nand words of Webster. No one had done so much, or had so large a share in\r\nthis momentous task. Here lies the debt which the American people owe to\r\nWebster, and here is his meaning and importance in his own time and to us\r\nto-day. His career, his intellect, and his achievements are inseparably\r\nconnected with the maintenance of a great empire, and the fortunes of a\r\ngreat people.
