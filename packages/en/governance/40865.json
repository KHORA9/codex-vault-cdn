But he has learned since it was begun—what it was very\r\nstupid of him not to have known at the outset—that in the matter of\r\nheresies, ethical, social, and political as well as theological,\r\ninterest is bound to pass for approval, explanation for advocacy, and\r\nsympathy, be it ever so slight, for profound belief: as if a man who\r\nshowed a curiosity about and appreciation of dogs should, by that very\r\nfact, become a dog; or as if (since there may seem to be an unfortunate\r\nimplication of contempt in this illustration) a German who attempted to\r\nexpound honestly English temperament, opinions, and traditions should,\r\nby that very fact, become an Englishman._\r\n\r\n_Once for all, then, the author is not a_ revolutionist, _though there\r\nare moments when he fancies he would like to be one, it appears such an\r\neminently satisfying state. It takes faith to be a revolutionist; and he\r\nis, alas! mentally incapable of faith. He is not an anarchist, not a\r\nsocialist, not a radical, not a “red republican,” nor a_ “mangeur de\r\nprêtres.” _His affiliations have not been even_ Dreyfusard _in France,\r\nnor even Bryanite in America. He is a conservative of the conservatives,\r\nonly prevented from being a reactionary by the fact that reaction is but\r\nanother form of revolution, and the most hopeless and faith-exacting of\r\nthem all. So far from being a revolutionist, he is an evolutionist only\r\nunder protest_,—vi et armis, _as it were. He favours things as they\r\nare, things as they were quite as often, while things as they might be\r\ncontain for him no allure. He cherishes enormously this imperfect old\r\nworld as it is, still more as it was; has not the slightest desire to\r\nreconstruct it after his own formula, and would not willingly exchange\r\nit for any hypothetical world which, up to the present hour, restless\r\nhuman ingenuity has devised._\r\n\r\n_He is “naturally beforehand shy of novelties, new books, new faces, new\r\nyears,” and is “sanguine only in the prospects of other [former] years.”\r\nHe likes old cabinets, old comedies, old prints, old stuffs, old pipes,\r\nold wine, old ships, old trees, old shoes, old friends, old customs, old\r\ncrotchets, and old ladies._\r\n\r\n_He prefers infinitely—it is very wrong and foolish, perhaps, but he\r\ncannot help it—ancient hostelries to modern hotels, spontaneous\r\nneighbourliness to organised benevolence, fireplaces to furnace-heaters,\r\nand waving meadows to close-cropped lawns; a blooded aristocrat to a\r\nsocial struggler, a patriot to a cosmopolite, a brave drinker to a total\r\nabstinence apostle, an illiterate Breton peasant to the “smart” product\r\nof improved schools, a mediæval cloister to a free-thinker’s hall, and\r\nan easy-going priest to a nervous sceptic; beauty to utility,\r\nsuperstition to science, ritual to plain sense. A uniform appeals to him\r\nmore than a business suit, a coquettish gown more than the most advanced\r\nhygienic bloomer, a solicitous mother and competent housewife more than\r\na brilliant club woman. He finds more satisfaction in old-fashioned,\r\ncomfortable ideas than in disquieting progressive ones. He would quite\r\nas soon be domineered over by a noble as by a parvenu or a pot-house\r\npolitician, and is less shocked by the colossal pretensions of a pope\r\nthan by the puerile bumptiousness of a small-minded clergyman. He\r\ndeplores railways, trolleys, bicycles, automobiles, and compulsory\r\neducation, because they all tend to destroy native dialects, customs,\r\nand costumes, obliterate all local colour, and so render lands far\r\nseparated dully alike. He resents the presumptuousness of that Reason\r\nwhich is so seldom reasonable, and would not shed a tear nor distil a\r\nregret if telephones, telegraphs, and psychical research were swept off\r\nthe face of the earth._\r\n\r\n_He is well aware, therefore, that there is good to be said of\r\ntime-honoured institutions: of the state; of the army, the church, and\r\nthe courts of law, the props of the state; and of capitalists, the pets\r\nand protégés of the state. On occasion he could write a fervid defence\r\nof each and every one of these established things. But he is equally\r\naware that there is good to be said of the conscientious opponents of\r\nthe state, its props and its protégés. To say this good is his present\r\nbusiness; and, if he seems to bend over backward sometimes in saying it,\r\nit should be borne in mind that they also have bent over backward—nay,\r\nturned double somersaults backward—who, prompted by terror, prejudice,\r\nintolerance, hatred, or contempt, have pronounced unqualified\r\ncondemnation on the consecrated antagonists of things as they are; and\r\nit should at least be queried whether his indiscretions may not be\r\nexcused (if not altogether justified) thereby._\r\n\r\n_No, the author is not a revolutionist, but he is acquainted with plenty\r\nof good fellows who are. “He has eaten their bread and salt; he has\r\ndrunk their water and wine.” He has taken pot-luck with them, witnessed\r\ntheir privations, and listened to the telling of their dreams. He thinks\r\nhe comprehends them, he knows he loves them, and he would present them\r\nas he has found them to the world._\r\n\r\n_This attitude will be understood by all who really believe in fair\r\nplay, in giving every man his innings and the devil his due; who can\r\nadmit merits equally in Christians and Pagans, Jesuits and Agnostics,\r\nClassicists and Romanticists, Greeks and Goths; who admire a beau geste\r\nalike in missionary and filibuster, condottiere and crusader, martyr and\r\ntoreador, pirate and king,—in a Jeanne d’Arc and a Ravaillac, a\r\nKitchener and a Joubert, a Sheridan and a Mosby, a Dewey and an\r\nAguinaldo, a Hobson and a Cervera, a Makaroff and a Uryu, a Napoleon and\r\na Musolino, a Richard Cœur de Lion and a Robin Hood, a Nelson and a\r\nCambronne. It will be understood by all those who appreciate a joke,\r\neven when it turns against themselves; who recognise the nobility of\r\nstraight thinking and bold speaking, the sublimity of high passion, the\r\nregenerating force of righteous resentment and stubborn resistance, and\r\nthe holiness of self-sacrifice for an ideal; who have a faculty for\r\nputting themselves in other men’s places or have learned the hard lesson\r\nof calling no thing “common or unclean”; who love men because they are\r\nmen, serve women because they are women, compassionate suffering because\r\nit is suffering, reverence him who hath much struggled to no apparent\r\npurpose, and pardon much, like the Christ, to him who hath much loved._\r\n\r\n_That these persons are the few does not seriously matter. It is a great\r\nthing to be understood by a few._\r\n\r\n\r\n   ALVAN F.

But the beginnings of anarchistic philosophy\r\nand the development of anarchism, however suggestive they may be, do not\r\nfall within the province of this volume. Therefore it is not necessary\r\nto expound the tenets or to trace the influence of the anarchist or\r\nsemi-anarchist devotees through the ages: the Taoists of China (whose\r\nfounder, Lao-Tse (600 B.C.), was a contemporary of Pythagoras and\r\nConfucius), the social prophets of Islam from Mazdak in the sixth\r\ncentury to the wonderful Bab in the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, Saint Anthony of Padua and Jean Vicenza in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, Savonarola at the end of the fifteenth, the Anabaptists under\r\nThomas Munzer, Mathiesen, and Jean de Leyde in the sixteenth, Razine the\r\nCossack and the Scottish Covenanters in the seventeenth, Mandrin the\r\nbrigand in the eighteenth, and the Jesuits of Paraguay in the last half\r\nof the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries. I do not\r\npretend to determine whether the Guelph-Ghibelline feud, which rent\r\nEurope for more than two hundred years, was or was not a struggle\r\nbetween despotism and religious democracy, or whether Gregory VII.,\r\nAlexander III., Gregory IX., Innocent IV., and Boniface VIII. were or\r\nwere not revolutionary popes endeavouring to realise the social dreams\r\nof the Franciscans and Dominicans. I do not try to discover what there\r\nis of truth in the astonishing claims of certain exalted students of\r\noccultism, mysticism, and comparative religions, that anarchism found\r\nexpression in the worship of the Indian Siva, the Persian Mithras, the\r\nChaldean Baal-Moloch, and the Greek Bacchus; in the conspiracy of the\r\nBacchanals (described by Livy) in the first half of the second century\r\nbefore Christ; in the colossal extravagances of the Cæsars; in the\r\n_bizarreries_ of the Nicolaites, the Cainites, the Carpocratians, the\r\nOphites, and other Gnostics of Egypt during the first five centuries of\r\nthe Christian era; in the _Consortia_ under Constantine; and in the\r\nfanaticisms of the Inquisitors, the Lollards, Flagellants, Bégards,\r\nPatarins, Templars, and Devil-worshippers during the Middle Ages. I do\r\nnot dwell upon nor so much as collate the anarchistic tendencies and\r\nsanctions which anarchist scholars discern in the writings or sayings of\r\nJob and the Old Testament prophets, of Athanasius, Chrysostom, and Saint\r\nFrancis of Assisi, Plato, Jesus, Rabelais, Bourdaloue, and Bossuet, and\r\nthe pre-Revolutionary Encyclopedists (especially Diderot and Rousseau).\r\nI even pass by the far more pertinent teachings, systems, personalities,\r\nand careers of the admitted precursors of modern anarchism; of Max\r\nStirner and Fourier, of Proudhon, the father of modern anarchist\r\ndoctrine, and of “the mysterious Russian,” Bakounine, the father of the\r\nmodern anarchist party. I also pass by the agrarian revolt of Gracchus\r\nBabœuf (guillotined by Barras in 1797); the emergence of the learned\r\nRussian Kropotkine, and of the Italians Cafiero and Malatesta; the\r\nrelations between French anarchism and Russian nihilism; the struggle\r\nfor Italian liberation; the founding of the _Internationale_ and of the\r\n_Fédération Jurasienne_; the epic struggle for the control of the\r\n_Internationale_ between Karl Marx, representing authoritative\r\ncentralisation, and Bakounine, representing anti-authoritative\r\nfederalism. I neglect, in a word, the more than interesting history of\r\nthe slow evolution of modern anarchism, and coming directly, without\r\nfurther ado, to the France of to-day, attack the questions,—What is\r\nanarchy? What does the anarchist want? And how does he hope to get it?\r\n\r\nOf the contemporary French Encyclopedists who are preparing, or think\r\nthey are preparing, the revolution of the twentieth century, three are\r\neminently fitted by their learning, by their capacity for straight\r\nthinking and utterance, by their sense of historical perspective, their\r\npower of keen analysis and bold synthesis, by their breadth, their\r\ntolerance, their humanity, their integrity, and their consecration, to\r\nanswer these questions. They are Pierre Kropotkine, Elisée Reclus, and\r\nJean Grave. But Kropotkine, while the author of such epoch-making works\r\nas _La Conquête du Pain, L’Anarchie: son Idéal_, and _Les Paroles d’un\r\nRévolté_, is a Russian, not a Frenchman, by birth and breeding, and has\r\nbeen little in Paris of late; and Reclus[1] (one of the most learned\r\ngeographers of his time), though never far away from the anarchist\r\nmovement, is, by reason of his devotion to his specialty, rarely in the\r\nthick of it. Besides, he has made his home in Belgium for many years.\r\n\r\nIt is to Jean Grave, therefore, the youngest of the three, the present\r\neditor of the journal _Les Temps Nouveaux_ and author of _La Société\r\nMourante_, _La Société Future_, _La Société au Lendemain de la\r\nRévolution_, _L’Individu et la Société_, and _L’Anarchie: son But, ses\r\nMoyens_, that it seems best to confide the delicate task of presenting\r\nthe French anarchistic idea and ideal; and, because I cannot trust\r\nmyself to summarise without bias the _credo_ of a sect to which I do not\r\nbelong, I quote in full the comprehensive first chapter of his important\r\ndoctrinal volume, _L’Anarchie: son But, ses Moyens_:—\r\n\r\n   “In spite of the fact that the idea of anarchy has emerged\r\n   from the obscurity in which men have attempted to stifle it,\r\n   in spite of the fact that to-day (thanks to persecution,\r\n   thanks to laws of exception such as are made in the worst\r\n   monarchies) the words ‘anarchy’ and ‘anarchist’ are unfamiliar\r\n   to none, there are not many who know exactly what anarchy is.\r\n\r\n   “The intervention of the anarchists in the Dreyfus affair,\r\n   where they were much in evidence, had the effect of bringing\r\n   them into contact with bourgeois politicians, who knew\r\n   absolutely nothing about them; but anarchy did not come out\r\n   into a clearer light from this association.\r\n\r\n   “Anarchy, in the eyes of some, is robbery, assassination,\r\n   bombs, a return to savagery; anarchists are only\r\n   house-breakers, loafers, who would divide all wealth in order\r\n   to be able to amuse themselves with doing nothing.\r\n\r\n   “In the eyes of others, anarchy is a sort of Utopia, of\r\n   golden-age dream which they readily grant to be very\r\n   beautiful, but a dream good at best to illustrate books of\r\n   ethics or fantastic social schemes with. The most kindly\r\n   disposed regard anarchy as a vague aspiration which they do\r\n   not hesitate to recognise as desirable for humanity to attain,\r\n   but as so completely inaccessible that there is no reason for\r\n   making any decided effort to realise it, and consider the\r\n   anarchist as a species of lunatic whom it is prudent to avoid,\r\n   a pitiful _illuminé_ who strays from the practicable paths to\r\n   lose himself in the vagueness of Utopia.\r\n\r\n   “They are very few who know that anarchy is a theory resting\r\n   on rational bases, that anarchists are men who, having\r\n   collated the complaints of those who suffer from the actual\r\n   social order, and having saturated themselves with human\r\n   aspirations, have undertaken a critique of the institutions\r\n   which control us, analysing them, weighing their worth, and\r\n   estimating what they are capable of producing, and who, from\r\n   the sum total of their observations, deduce logical natural\r\n   laws for the organisation of a better society.\r\n\r\n   “Of course, the anarchists do not pretend to have invented the\r\n   critique of the social order. Others had done that before\r\n   them. As soon as power began to exist, there were malcontents\r\n   who made no bones of railing at its acts; and, if we possessed\r\n   the legends which men handed down from generation to\r\n   generation before writing was known, we should probably find\r\n   therein satires against the chiefs. It is quite possible to\r\n   criticise the existing order of things without being an\r\n   anarchist, and there are those who have done this in a\r\n   successful fashion which the anarchists will never surpass.\r\n\r\n   “But what anarchists believe they have done more than the\r\n   other critics, more than the existing socialistic schools or\r\n   the socialistic schools which preceded them, is to have gotten\r\n   their bearings in the midst of the confused mass of errors\r\n   which spring from the complexity of social relations, to have\r\n   remounted to the causes of misery, of exploitation, and\r\n   finally to have laid bare the political error which made men\r\n   place hope in good governments, good governors, good\r\n   legislation, good dispensers of justice, as efficacious\r\n   remedies for the ills from which humanity suffers.\r\n\r\n   “Anarchy, studying man in his nature, in his evolution,\r\n   demonstrates that there cannot be good laws or good\r\n   governments or faithful appliers of the laws.\r\n\r\n   “Every human law is necessarily arbitrary; for, however just\r\n   it may be, and whatever may be the breadth of view of those\r\n   who make it, it represents only a part of human development,\r\n   only an infinitesimal fragment of the aspirations of all.\r\n   Every law formulated by a parliament, far from being the\r\n   product of a great conception, is, on the contrary, only the\r\n   mean of public opinion, since parliament itself, by its very\r\n   manner of recruitment, represents only a very mediocre mean.\r\n\r\n   “Applied to all in the same fashion, the law becomes thus, by\r\n   the very force of things, arbitrary and unjust for those who\r\n   are on this side or on that side of the mean.\r\n\r\n   “A law, then, not being able to represent the aspirations of\r\n   all, can be made effective on those who would infringe it only\r\n   by fear of punishment. Its application involves the existence\r\n   of a judicial and repressive apparatus, and it becomes thus\r\n   the more odious as its coercive force is the more sure.\r\n\r\n   “The law unjust to start with, because, conception of minority\r\n   or majority, it wishes to impose itself on the whole, becomes\r\n   still more unjust because applied by men who, having the\r\n   defects and the passions, the prejudices and the personal\r\n   errors, of appreciation of men, cannot act, whatever be their\r\n   probity, except under the influence of these prejudices and\r\n   errors.\r\n\r\n   “There can be no good laws, nor good judges, nor,\r\n   consequently, good government, since the existence of these\r\n   implies a single rule of conduct for all, while it is\r\n   diversity which characterises individuals.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “No society based on human laws, then,—and this is the case of\r\n   all societies past and present,—can fully satisfy the ideal of\r\n   every one.\r\n\r\n   “The minority of idlers alone who, by ruse and by force, have\r\n   managed to seize the power, and who use, to their own profit,\r\n   the forces of the collectivity,—this minority alone, I say,\r\n   can find their account in this order of things and interest\r\n   themselves in its prolongation. But they can only make it last\r\n   with the help of the ignorance of individuals regarding their\r\n   own personalities, their possibilities, and their capacities.\r\n\r\n   “But however great the ignorance of the people may be, when\r\n   the pressure is too strong, they revolt. This is why our\r\n   society is so unstable, why the laws are repeatedly violated\r\n   by those who make them or by those who are charged to apply\r\n   them, when their interest points that way; for, power being\r\n   based on force, it is to force that all those resort who are\r\n   in power and wish to maintain themselves there, as well as all\r\n   those who are in pursuit of power.\r\n\r\n   “Made to be applied to all and to content everybody, the laws\r\n   derange more or less every individual, who wishes, while he is\r\n   under them, to abolish or relax them, but who wishes them more\r\n   vigorous when it is his turn to apply them.\r\n\r\n   “Nevertheless, new aspirations do arise; and, when the\r\n   antagonism becomes too great between these aspirations and the\r\n   political laws, the door opens wide to disorders and to\r\n   revolution.\r\n\r\n   “And it will always be the same so long as no other way is\r\n   found to repair the harm done by a law recognised as bad than\r\n   the application of a new law. This ignorance on the part of\r\n   men makes human institutions, once established, resist\r\n   changes. The names vary, but the things remain.\r\n\r\n   “Men, not having yet been able to arrive at a social\r\n   conception other than that of authority, are condemned to turn\r\n   in the same circle, and will be condemned to turn in the same\r\n   circle so long as they shall not have altered their\r\n   conception. Royalty, empire, dictatorship, republic,\r\n   centralisation, federalism, communalism,—these are all at\r\n   bottom so many phases of authority. Whether in the name of a\r\n   single person or in the deceitful name of the majority, always\r\n   the will of some is imposed on all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEAN GRAVE IN HIS WORKSHOP\r\n\r\n   “_There is no more intimate or\r\n   engaging business interior in Paris._”]\r\n\r\n   “Furthermore, if the individual increases his knowledge in a\r\n   continuous fashion, it is only in a very slow fashion. Still\r\n   he has arrived to-day at the point where, to develop himself\r\n   in his integrity, it is necessary that his autonomy be\r\n   complete, that his aspirations express themselves freely, that\r\n   he be permitted to cultivate them in all their breadth, that\r\n   nothing fetter his free initiative and his evolution.\r\n\r\n   “And so it is that now, at last, anarchists draw from their\r\n   study of the existing social organisation this important\r\n   lesson: that human laws ought to disappear, carrying with them\r\n   the legislative, executive, judicial, and repressive systems\r\n   which impede human evolution by causing murderous crises in\r\n   which many thousands of human beings perish, by delaying all\r\n   humanity in its forward march, and, sometimes, even by\r\n   dragging it backward.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “While the politicians have not got beyond this formula, which\r\n   they believe the _ne plus ultra_ of liberty,—‘_l’individu\r\n   libre dans la commune, la commune libre dans l’état_,’—we know\r\n   that these political forms are incompatible with liberty,\r\n   since they tend always to submit a number of men to the same\r\n   rule; and we formulate our device, ‘_l’individu libre dans\r\n   l’humanité libre_,’—the individual, left free to attach\r\n   himself according to his tendencies, his affinities, free to\r\n   seek out those with whom his liberty and his aptitudes can\r\n   accord, unfettered by the political organisations which are\r\n   determined by geographical or territorial considerations.\r\n\r\n   “For man to develop himself freely in his physical,\r\n   intellectual, and moral nature, for him to reveal all his\r\n   capacities, it is necessary that each individual be able to\r\n   satisfy all his physical, intellectual, and moral needs. And\r\n   this satisfaction can only be assured to all if the soil,\r\n   which is the creation of no one, is placed at the free\r\n   disposition of whoever is capable of tilling it, and if the\r\n   existing equipment, product of the labour of preceding\r\n   generations, ceases to belong to a minority of parasites who\r\n   exact a large tithe upon the resultant of its activity and\r\n   the activity of those who work it.\r\n\r\n   “The earth too much cut up, on the one hand, to permit the\r\n   small land-holders to employ the powerful machinery which\r\n   would effectively second their efforts, appropriated in\r\n   immense lots, on the other hand, by a class of idlers who\r\n   secure, without work, an income from the production of those\r\n   to whom they consent to rent,[2]—the earth nourishes its\r\n   existing population with difficulty. And I have not counted\r\n   the ignorance which is fostered by a defective education and\r\n   which causes the greater part of the cultivators to cling to\r\n   the traditional processes of cultivation,—processes which\r\n   demand far too much work and effort for the results.\r\n\r\n   “Yet, in spite of these sources of waste, the earth would\r\n   still manage to nourish, after a fashion, every living being\r\n   if the middlemen were not there to warehouse the products and\r\n   to speculate and gamble upon them, in such a way that the\r\n   majority of persons are never in a condition to buy what they\r\n   need. The fault, then, if all have not enough to eat, lies\r\n   with the defective social organisation, and is not due to lack\r\n   of production. A better distribution of products would alone\r\n   be sufficient to give every one enough to eat, while a better\r\n   management of the soil and a better use of the instruments of\r\n   production would bring about abundance for all.\r\n\r\n   “A clearer comprehension of things will bring the peasant to\r\n   understand that his interest, properly understood, is to unite\r\n   his parcel of land with the parcels of his neighbours, to\r\n   associate his efforts with their efforts, in order to diminish\r\n   his toil and increase his production.\r\n\r\n   “And as no one has the right to sterilise, for his sole\r\n   pleasure, the slightest parcel of land, so long as there is a\r\n   single being who has not plenty to eat, the coming revolution\r\n   will have for one of its objects to put the soil into the\r\n   hands of those who shall wish to cultivate it and the farm\r\n   machines into the hands of those who shall wish to operate\r\n   them.\r\n\r\n   “All this, anarchy seeks to demonstrate to the peasant,\r\n   explaining to him that the masters who impose upon him exploit\r\n   likewise the workman of the towns, trying to make him\r\n   comprehend that, far from considering the town workman as an\r\n   enemy, he should stretch out his hand to him, to the end that\r\n   they may aid each other in the struggle for life, and arrive\r\n   thus at disembarrassing themselves of their common parasites.\r\n\r\n   “To the workman, anarchy demonstrates that he must not expect\r\n   his enfranchisement to come from providential saviours, nor\r\n   from the palliatives with which the puppets of politics, who\r\n   wish to control his vote and so dominate him, try to dazzle\r\n   him; that the emancipation of the individual can be brought\r\n   about only by the individual’s own action, can result only\r\n   from his own energy and his own efforts when, knowing how to\r\n   act, he shall use his liberty in place of demanding it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “It is not alone to those who are dying of want that anarchy\r\n   addresses itself. To satisfy one’s hunger is a primordial\r\n   right which takes precedence over all other rights and stands\r\n   at the head of the claims of a human being. But anarchy\r\n   embraces all the aspirations and neglects no need. The list of\r\n   its demands includes all the demands of humanity.\r\n\r\n   “Mirbeau, in his _Mauvais Bergers_, makes one of the\r\n   characters proclaim to workmen on a strike their right to\r\n   beauty. And, indeed, every being has a right not only to what\r\n   sustains life, but also to whatever renders it easy, enlivens\r\n   it, and embellishes it. They are rare, alas! in our social\r\n   state, who can live their lives amply.\r\n\r\n   “Some there are whose physical needs are satisfied, but who\r\n   are retarded in their evolution by a social organisation which\r\n   is conditioned by the narrowness of conception of the average\r\n   intellect,—artists, littérateurs, savants, all who think,\r\n   suffer morally, if not physically, from the present order of\r\n   things.\r\n\r\n   “Daily they are wounded by the pettinesses of current\r\n   existence, and disheartened by the mediocrity of the public to\r\n   whom they address themselves, and whom they must consider if\r\n   they wish to sell their works,—a situation which conducts\r\n   those who would not die of hunger to compromise, to vulgar and\r\n   mediocre art.\r\n\r\n   “Their education has led many of them to believe that they are\r\n   of an essence superior to the peasant, to the manual worker,\r\n   from whom, for the matter of that, they are for the most part\r\n   descended. They have been persuaded that it is necessary, if\r\n   their ‘talent’ is to develop and their imagination is to have\r\n   full swing, that the ‘vile multitude’ take upon its shoulders\r\n   the heavy tasks, devote itself to serving them, and wear\r\n   itself out in making, by its labour, life easy for them; that\r\n   they must have, if their genius is to attain its complete\r\n   fruition, the same atmosphere of luxury and of idleness as the\r\n   aristocratic classes.\r\n\r\n   “A healthy conception of things teaches that a human being, to\r\n   be complete, must exercise his limbs as well as his brain,\r\n   that labour is degrading only because it has been made a sign\r\n   of servitude, and that a man truly worthy of the name does not\r\n   need to impose the cares of his existence on others.\r\n\r\n   “One man is as good as another: that there are degrees of\r\n   development is due to causes of which we are ignorant, but\r\n   such or such an illiterate may have moral qualities superior\r\n   to the moral qualities of those who are more learned than he.\r\n   In any case, intelligence, if it blesses him who possesses it,\r\n   does not confer on him the right to exploit or govern others.\r\n   These differences of development merely imply differences of\r\n   desires, of aspirations, of ideals; and it is for the\r\n   individual himself who is so favoured to realise what responds\r\n   best to his conception of happiness.\r\n\r\n   “Besides, these differences of development only appear to us\r\n   as great as they do because education, ill understood and ill\r\n   distributed, perpetuates prejudices and errors. Imagination,\r\n   invention, observation, judgment, if they vary somewhat in\r\n   intensity in different individuals, do not differ in essence.\r\n   They are simple faculties of our brain which do not lose their\r\n   quality for being employed to construct a machine or a house,\r\n   solder a kettle, or make a shirt, rather than to write a\r\n   romance or a treatise on anatomy.\r\n\r\n   “Greedy of hierarchy, we humans have divided into high and low\r\n   occupations the diverse employment of our forces. The\r\n   parasites who have made themselves our masters, all in\r\n   proclaiming themselves superior, have established that there\r\n   is nothing truly noble but idleness, that there is nothing\r\n   truly beautiful but force exerted to destroy; that force\r\n   expended to produce, to draw out of the earth and out of\r\n   industry whatever is necessary to sustain life, is of a vile,\r\n   inferior quality, and that its use should be reserved to the\r\n   servile classes.\r\n\r\n   “On this basis we continue to declare certain occupations low,\r\n   forgetting that they are such only because one class is forced\r\n   to pursue them in the service of another class, to submit to\r\n   its orders and caprices, to abdicate its liberty; but there\r\n   can be nothing base in no matter what work which consists in\r\n   ministering to our own needs.\r\n\r\n   “The artist and the littérateur belong to the masses. They\r\n   cannot isolate themselves, and inevitably feel the effects of\r\n   the surrounding mediocrity. It is vain for them to intrench\r\n   themselves behind the privileges of the ruling classes, to\r\n   attempt to withdraw into their ‘_tour d’ivoire_’: if there is\r\n   debasement for him who is reduced to performing the vilest\r\n   tasks to satisfy his hunger, the morality of those who condemn\r\n   him to it is not superior to his own; if obedience degrades,\r\n   command, far from exalting character, degrades it also.\r\n\r\n   “To live their dream, realise their aspirations, they, too,\r\n   must work—for the moral and intellectual elevation of the\r\n   masses. They, too, must understand that their own development\r\n   is made up of the intellectuality of all; that, whatever the\r\n   heights they believe they have attained, they belong to the\r\n   multitude. If they strain to rise above the multitude, a\r\n   thousand bonds hold them to it, fetter their action and their\r\n   thought, preventing them forever from reaching the summits\r\n   they have glimpsed. A society normally constituted does not\r\n   admit slaves, but a mutual exchange of services between\r\n   equals.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “The very savant, who considers dealing with knowledge the\r\n   noblest employ of the human faculties, must learn that\r\n   knowledge is not a private domain reserved for a few adepts\r\n   uttering oracles before a public of ignoramuses, who take them\r\n   at their word; and that in science, as in art and in\r\n   literature, the faculties of judgment, of observation, and of\r\n   comparison, do not differ from the faculties employed in\r\n   occupations which we consider more vulgar.\r\n\r\n   “In spite of the intellectual compression which has held\r\n   humanity down for so many centuries, science has been able to\r\n   progress and develop, thanks to the critical spirit of\r\n   individuals refractory to official teaching and ready-made\r\n   conceptions. It ought, then, to be put within the reach of\r\n   all, to become accessible to all aptitudes, in order that this\r\n   spirit of criticism which has saved it from obscurantism may\r\n   contribute to hasten its full efflorescence.\r\n\r\n   “Knowledge is divided into so many diverse branches that it is\r\n   impossible for the same individual to know them all in their\r\n   entirety, the duration of a human life being far from\r\n   sufficient for a man to acquire enough ideas to be able to\r\n   investigate them in their minutest details.\r\n\r\n   “To study them,—that is, if he expects to be able to criticise\r\n   them,—he is forced to have recourse to the labours of his\r\n   predecessors and also of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n   “It is from all human knowledge that the general synthesis\r\n   must proceed. What we know to-day is only a means for\r\n   acquiring the knowledge of to-morrow. And an individual\r\n   obtains reliable knowledge only in accepting the help of all.\r\n   The observations of the humblest persons are not always to be\r\n   disdained. Let the savants also, then, cease to believe\r\n   themselves a caste apart, let them understand once for all\r\n   that knowledge does not demand special aptitudes, and that it\r\n   must be accessible to all, in order that all, in developing\r\n   themselves, may contribute thus to the general development.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “What is true for individuals is true for nations. Just as an\r\n   individual cannot live without the support of all, a people\r\n   cannot exist without the co-operation of the other peoples. A\r\n   nation which should shut itself up within its frontiers,\r\n   ceasing all relations with the rest of the world, would not be\r\n   slow to retrograde and perish. It is then absurd and criminal\r\n   to foment, under colour of patriotism, hatreds nominally\r\n   national, but which are in reality only pretexts for the\r\n   governing classes to legitimise the scourge, militarism, of\r\n   which they have need to assure their power.\r\n\r\n   “Every nation has need of the other nations. There is not a\r\n   region which, for one product or another, is not the customer\r\n   of another region. And it is no reason for you to hate your\r\n   neighbours because they speak a different language, because a\r\n   hundred years ago they invaded and ravaged regions which are\r\n   indifferent to you to-day; and it is no reason for you to feel\r\n   yourselves outraged by this ancient invasion because, once\r\n   upon a time, the inhabitants of the invaded regions suffered\r\n   under the yoke which now galls you.\r\n\r\n   “There is not a single nation which cannot reproach its\r\n   neighbours with some crime of this sort; not a single nation\r\n   which at the present moment does not hold within its borders\r\n   some province incorporated against the desire of its\r\n   inhabitants. And, if those who performed these acts of\r\n   brigandage were highly detestable, in what respect are their\r\n   descendants responsible therefor? Should we also be held\r\n   responsible for the acts of brigandage which our histories\r\n   teach us to admire as glorious achievements?\r\n\r\n   “Who among those who aspire to live solely by their own work\r\n   can take delight in seeing one nation rush upon another\r\n   nation? It is only those who have made themselves the masters\r\n   of nations, and who find it for their interest to augment the\r\n   numbers of those whom they exploit, who feel the need of\r\n   supplying aliment to the troops they train for the work of\r\n   slaughter. These understand perfectly that a menace of war\r\n   with a neighbour serves to justify the existence of the armies\r\n   which are their main prop.\r\n\r\n   “The despots who have exalted patriotism into a new religion\r\n   know very well how to ignore frontiers when the defence of\r\n   their privileges or the extension of their exploitation is at\r\n   stake. If it is a question of hunting down subversive ideas,\r\n   the French, German, Italian, Swiss, Russian, and other\r\n   bourgeois are ready enough to lend to each other their\r\n   diplomats and their police.\r\n\r\n   “Is it a question of putting down a strike? The exploiters are\r\n   not slow to engage foreign workmen, so that they consent to\r\n   work at the lowest wage; and governments would not hesitate,\r\n   if there were need, to lend each other their armies.\r\n\r\n   “And do not all the international understandings which have\r\n   been established for finance, the postal service, commerce,\r\n   navigation, railroads, prove that it is the _entente\r\n   pacifique_, after all, which is the supreme law?\r\n\r\n   “The anarchists would bring the workers to see a brother in\r\n   every workingman, on whichever side of the frontier he chances\r\n   to have been born.\r\n\r\n   “Brothers in misery, suffering from the same ills, bowed\r\n   beneath the same yoke, they have the same interests to defend,\r\n   the same ideal to pursue. Their veritable enemies are those\r\n   who exploit them, who enslave them and prevent their\r\n   development. It is against their masters that they should arm\r\n   themselves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Anarchy pays little attention to the shady combinations of\r\n   politics. It professes the most profound disdain for\r\n   politicians. The promises of the place-seekers interest it\r\n   only as they disclose all the inanity of politics, and only as\r\n   they can be made use of to demonstrate that the social\r\n   organisation will not be transformed until the day when a\r\n   resolute attack shall be made against its economic defects.\r\n\r\n   “If the politicians believe the lies they retail, they are\r\n   simple ignoramuses or imbeciles; for the slightest reasoning\r\n   should suffice to make them understand that, when a disease is\r\n   to be cured and its return prevented, its causes must be\r\n   attacked. If they lie purposely, they are rascals; and, in the\r\n   one case as in the other, they deceive those whose confidence\r\n   they win by their babble and their intrigue.\r\n\r\n   “Those who exploit the actual economic organisation will\r\n   always seek to direct to their own profit all the attempts at\r\n   amelioration that are suggested, and there will always be\r\n   people who are dismayed by brusque changes and who prefer to\r\n   rely on middle terms which seem to them to conciliate all\r\n   interests.\r\n\r\n   “It will always be for the advantage of the masters to deceive\r\n   the oppressed regarding the veritable means of\r\n   enfranchisement, and there will always be enough cormorants\r\n   greedy of power to assist them in their work of muddling\r\n   questions.\r\n\r\n   “Anarchy demonstrates the inanity of every attempt at\r\n   amelioration which attacks only the effect while letting\r\n   subsist the cause.\r\n\r\n   “So long as the wealth of society shall be the appanage of a\r\n   minority of loafers, this minority will employ it in living at\r\n   the expense of those whom it exploits. And, as it is the\r\n   possession of capital which makes strength and gives the\r\n   mastery of the social organisation, they are always in a\r\n   position to turn to their own profit every amelioration which\r\n   is undertaken.\r\n\r\n   “For an amelioration to benefit all, privileges must be\r\n   destroyed. It is to re-enter into the possession of that of\r\n   which they have been despoiled that the efforts of those who\r\n   possess nothing ought to tend. To break the power which\r\n   crushes them, to prevent its reconstitution, to take\r\n   possession of the means of production, to create a social\r\n   organisation in which social wealth can no more be\r\n   concentrated in the hands of a few,—this is what the\r\n   anarchists dream.\r\n\r\n   “If the exploitation of man is to be prevented, the bases of\r\n   the economic order must be changed: the soil and all that\r\n   which is the product of anterior generations must rest at the\r\n   free disposition of those who can work them, must not be\r\n   monopolised for the gain of any party whatsoever,—individual,\r\n   group, corporation, commune, or nation.\r\n\r\n   “This is what the partisans of partial reforms do not\r\n   comprehend, and yet this is what conscientious study of\r\n   economic facts demonstrates. Nothing good can come from the\r\n   activity of the charlatans of politics. Human emancipation\r\n   cannot be the work of any legislation, of any concession of\r\n   liberty on the part of those who rule. It can only be the work\r\n   of the _fait accompli_, of the individual will affirming\r\n   itself in acts.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Basing itself upon the evolutionist doctrine, rejecting all\r\n   preconceived will in the phenomena by which the evolution of\r\n   worlds and beings is manifested, recognising that this\r\n   evolution is solely the work of the forces of matter in\r\n   contact, simply the result of the transformations which this\r\n   matter undergoes in the course of its own evolution, anarchy\r\n   is frankly atheistic, and repels every idea of any creating or\r\n   directing entity whatsoever.\r\n\r\n   “But, as it is absolute liberty, if it combats religious\r\n   error, it is primarily from the point of view of truth, and,\r\n   specifically, because the priesthoods which have sprung up\r\n   about the different religious dogmas pretend to use the force\r\n   which their authority and capital lend them to impose their\r\n   beliefs and to make even those who reject all religions help\r\n   pay for them.\r\n\r\n   “As to whatever concerns the intimate thought of each,\r\n   anarchists understand that an individual cannot think\r\n   otherwise than his own mentality permits. They would see no\r\n   objection to people gathering together in special buildings\r\n   for the purpose of addressing prayers and praises to a\r\n   hypothetical being if they did not attempt to impose their\r\n   beliefs on others.\r\n\r\n   “Anarchists look for the triumph of reason from, and only\r\n   from, the culture of minds; and they know from themselves that\r\n   force and oppression cannot stifle ideas.\r\n\r\n   “They demand absolute liberty in the domain of thought as in\r\n   that of deeds, in the family as in society.\r\n\r\n   “Like all the forms of human activity, the association of the\r\n   sexes has not to brook the control or solicit the sanction of\r\n   any person whatsoever. It is absurd to wish to set limits to,\r\n   raise barriers against, or impose restraints on the affections\r\n   of individuals. Love, friendship, hatred, do not come at call:\r\n   we feel them or endure them without being able to help\r\n   ourselves, without even, more often than not, being able to\r\n   explain them and unravel their motives.\r\n\r\n   “Marriage, then, can be trammelled by no rule, by no law other\r\n   than that of mutual good faith and sincerity. It can have no\r\n   duration beyond the reciprocal affection of the two beings\r\n   associated, and should be dissoluble at the will of the party\r\n   for whom it becomes a burden.\r\n\r\n   “True, there will always remain some problems which cannot be\r\n   solved without friction and pain, such as the disposition of\r\n   the children, the suffering of the party in whom love\r\n   survives, and other matters of sentiment. But these\r\n   difficulties cannot be resolved any better by pre-established\r\n   rules: on the contrary, constraint only envenoms the\r\n   difficulties. It will be the duty of the interested parties to\r\n   find the solution of the difficulties which estrange them.\r\n\r\n   “The best that can be hoped for is that the moral level of\r\n   humanity will be so far elevated that goodness and tolerance\r\n   will increase and bestow their healing balm on the human\r\n   passions, which by their very nature elude regulation and\r\n   control.\r\n\r\n   “The great objection behind which the adversaries of anarchy\r\n   intrench themselves when driven into their last redoubts is\r\n   this, that the anarchist ideal is beautiful, certainly, but\r\n   much too beautiful ever to be realised, since humanity will\r\n   never be well-behaved enough to attain it.\r\n\r\n   “This objection is specious. No one can say what humanity will\r\n   be to-morrow; and there is no phase of its past development\r\n   which, if it had been foreseen and announced to the\r\n   generations preceding, would not have been held (with reasons\r\n   galore) quite as unrealisable as the anarchist ideal is held\r\n   by those who cannot abstract themselves from the present,—a\r\n   mental state not hard to understand, since the average brain\r\n   has not yet accomplished the evolution which will smooth the\r\n   way for the new order of things.\r\n\r\n   “As long as individuals stagnate in servitude, waiting for\r\n   providential men or events to put an end to their abjectness,\r\n   as long as they shall be contented to hope without acting, so\r\n   long the ideal that is the most beautiful, the ideal that is\r\n   the simplest, will rest, necessarily, in a state of pure\r\n   reverie, of vague Utopia.\r\n\r\n   “Where, except in the fable, has Fortune been seen to descend\r\n   to the threshold of the sleeper, and wait patiently till it\r\n   pleases his indolence to take her?\r\n\r\n   “When individuals shall have reconquered their self-esteem,\r\n   when they shall be convinced of their own force, when, tired\r\n   of bending the back, they shall have found once more their\r\n   dignity, and shall know how to make it respected, then they\r\n   will have learned that the will can accomplish everything when\r\n   it is at the service of a trained intellect.\r\n\r\n   “They have only to _will_ to be free, to _be_ free.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: La France Libre]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ORAL PROPAGANDA OF ANARCHY\r\n\r\n\r\n    _“Woe is me if I preach not the gospel!”_—SAINT PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _“The orthodox believers went to hear Him, but understood\r\n    nothing.”_\r\n\r\n    TOLSTOY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _“For He taught them as one having authority, and not as the\r\n    scribes.”_\r\n\r\n    SAINT MATTHEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _“The_ chanson, _like the bayonet, is a French weapon.”_—JULES\r\n    CLARETIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _“We must arm the camarades, we must never rest from arming the\r\n    camarades, with stronger and stronger arguments. We must enrich\r\n    their memories and imaginations with fresh facts which prove\r\n    more clearly the necessity of the social revolution.”_—PIERRE\r\n    LAVROFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnarchist propaganda is of four sorts, viz.: I. Oral. II. Written. III.\r\nBy example (_propagande par l’exemple_). IV. By the overt act of\r\nviolence (_propagande par le fait_).\r\n\r\nWith the anarchistic as with other creeds the simplest, most natural\r\nform of oral propaganda is, of course, that which consists in telling\r\none’s faith to one’s neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe proselyting zeal that prompts a man to take his gospel with him\r\nwherever he goes,—to his workshop, to his café, to his restaurant, to\r\nthe street corner, to “the butcher, the baker, the candlestick\r\nmaker,”—and to couple with exhortation the\r\n\r\n   “_Little, nameless, unremembered acts\r\n     Of kindness and of love_”\r\n\r\nthat make up neighbourly service, is a force not the less real and\r\npotent because its operations are unseen and the measure of them cannot\r\nbe taken. It is a factor to be reckoned with, the\r\n\r\n       “_presence of a good diffused,\r\n     And in diffusion ever more intense_”;\r\n\r\nbut it is essentially an affair of the soul not to be declared save by\r\nthe novelist or poet, and it is of the same substance in all cases of\r\ngenuine conviction, whatever the basis of the conviction may be.\r\n\r\nThe unit of the only oral propaganda of which the public can take\r\ncognisance is the “group” (_le groupe_).\r\n\r\nThe anarchist group is unique—among organisations, one would say if one\r\nmight. Whether it consist of three persons or thirty, or some number\r\nbetween these limits,—in point of fact it is oftener three than thirty,\r\nwith an average of perhaps a dozen,—it has neither constitution nor\r\nby-laws, neither president, vice-president, nor executive board. It is\r\nas exempt from human guidance as a Quaker meeting, to which, for the\r\nmatter of that, it bears more than this one superficial resemblance, and\r\nas guiltless as an old-fashioned ladies’ committee meeting of\r\nparliamentary law. Now the _camarades_ do not always conduct themselves\r\nwith exemplary decorum, and it sometimes happens that two or three of\r\nthem are on their feet together and talking at once; but, at the most,\r\nthis predicament does not arise more frequently than in more rule-bound\r\nbodies, and it cannot, on the whole, be said that the groups are any\r\nmore disorderly, distrait, dilly-dallying, and ineffective than the\r\nboresome assemblies in which, often, conceited lack-brains make\r\nparliamentary tactics an end, not a means, by perpetually “rising to\r\npoints of order” and “appealing from the decisions of the chair.”\r\n\r\nThe group meets sometimes at a café or wine-shop and sometimes at the\r\nlodging of a member. It is oftenest born of a mutual desire for\r\nfellowship on the part of the anarchists of a street or quarter; but it\r\nmay result, quite independently of propinquity, from a common enthusiasm\r\nfor a special phase of the doctrine, a common wish to pursue the same\r\nline of study, or from a common interest in some concrete enterprise,\r\nsuch as coming to the rescue of strikers, raising funds for the families\r\nof the victims of police persecution, founding libraries and lecture\r\ncourses, or the circulation of tracts. In any case there are no formal\r\nconditions of membership, a group never being at a loss to rid itself,\r\nwithout appeal to written law or precedent, of an intruder who makes\r\nhimself obnoxious.\r\n\r\nThe programmes of group meetings vary infinitely with the tempers and\r\ncaprices of the members, as well as with the objects of the groups; but\r\nthey may be said, in general, to consist of the reading of original\r\nessays and poems, reports on the progress of the cause at home and\r\nabroad, a consideration of the bearing on the cause of the latest events\r\nin the world at large, an exchange of journals and brochures accompanied\r\nby expositions and discussions of their contents, a volunteering of\r\nservice for the tasks in hand, and that untrammelled exchange of ideas\r\nin which the lines between speech-making and conversation, wrangle and\r\ndiscussion, are not too rigidly drawn.\r\n\r\nThe group is highly ephemeral. Everything about it being guided by the\r\nexigencies of the moment, it rarely survives the accomplishment of the\r\nspecial object for which it is formed. It dies, as it is born, easily;\r\nor, rather, yielding to the charm of the untried, it takes to itself a\r\nnew body when the old body grows cramping or monotonous. Such deaths do\r\nnot signify complete exhaustion of vitality or even a diminution of\r\nstrength. By a sort of transmigration of souls the vital force is\r\nredistributed, that is all.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable fluidity makes it practically impossible to get any\r\ngroup statistics that are worth the paper they are written on. An\r\nestimate made a few years back by a person who seemed as well situated\r\nas any one to know, put the number of groups at about one hundred in\r\nParis and between four hundred and five hundred in the rest of France.\r\nThe same authority would probably give rather higher figures now. But\r\nsuch figures, even if accurate, are of very slight importance, since the\r\nnumber of groups is no criterion whatever of the number of anarchists.\r\nThe most militant anarchists hold aloof from the groups in order to have\r\ncomplete freedom of action and escape police surveillance; many are in\r\ncommercial or administrative situations which counsel reticence; and\r\nmany labourers are constrained to a similar reticence by the danger of\r\nlosing their jobs. Furthermore, many anarchists call themselves\r\nsocialists in order to benefit by the greater tolerance accorded to the\r\nsocialists, especially since the Combes ministry came into power. In a\r\nword, the anarchist has every reason to conceal his identity from the\r\nprying statistician, and usually succeeds in doing so. Mark Twain,\r\ncommenting once on the inadequate census returns of the Jews in America,\r\naffirmed that he himself was personally acquainted with several million.\r\nThe meagre numbers ordinarily assigned to the anarchists in France tempt\r\none strongly to imitate Mark’s facetious audacity. At least, if French\r\nanarchists are really so few, one may affirm with safety that he is\r\npersonally acquainted with them all.\r\n\r\nGroup names are of no great moment when group identity is so evanescent;\r\nbut some of the names are picturesque or suggestive enough to bear\r\nrecording:—\r\n\r\n_Les Enfants de la Nature_, _La Panthère de Batignolles_, _Les Gonzes\r\nPoilus du Point-du-Jour_, _La Jeunesse Anti-Patriotique de Belleville_,\r\n_Le Drapeau Noir_, _Les Quand Même_, _La Révolte des Travailleurs_, _Le\r\nCercle Internationale_, _La Torpille_, _Le Groupe Libertaire_, _Les\r\nForçats_, _Le Réveil_, _Les Résolus_, _L’Emancipation_, _Les\r\nAnti-Travailleurs_, _Les Indomptables_, _Les Sans-Patrie_, _Les Amis de\r\nRavachol_, _Les Cœurs de Chêne_, _La Dynamite_, _Terre et Indépendance_,\r\n_Les Indignés_, _La Vipère_, _L’Affamé_, _Le Glaive_, _Les Parias de\r\nCharonne._\r\n\r\nAs each individual of a group is a law unto himself, recognising no\r\nauthority in the group as a whole, so each group is a law unto itself,\r\nindependent of every other group and recognising no higher authority\r\nwhatsoever. In France, formerly, as is still the case in several\r\ncountries, groups of the same region formed a federation; but the only\r\npresent tangible proofs of the existence of an anarchist movement on a\r\nlarge scale are district, national, and international congresses to\r\nwhich whoever wishes[3] may be a delegate. These congresses have no\r\nlegislative, administrative, or coercive power over their component\r\nparts; their functions are purely advisory like those of the district\r\nconferences of the Congregational churches in America.\r\n\r\nA newly formed group usually gets itself into touch, by correspondence,\r\nwith its senior groups somewhat after the manner of a Chautauqua\r\nLiterary and Scientific Circle or the local branch of a “correspondence\r\nuniversity.” Thus: “The group _Les Vengeurs_ would like to put itself\r\ninto communication with the existing groups. Those who have not received\r\na personal letter, but who wish to correspond, are requested to direct\r\ntheir letters to the following address,” etc.\r\n\r\nUnion meetings of several groups are not infrequent. Thus: “_L’Avenir\r\nSocial_ of St. Ouen invites the _camarades_ of the groups of St. Denis,\r\nStains, Argenteuil, Puteaux, and Aubervilliers to a grand meeting which\r\nwill be held Sunday, February 17, at 8.30 o’clock.” But these union\r\nmeetings can no more bind by their action the individual groups\r\nparticipating than the “union temperance meetings” of the churches of\r\nNew England towns can bind the action of the individual churches\r\nparticipating.\r\n\r\nAnarchist mass meetings are relatively rare. If landlords are found\r\nwilling to let their halls to anarchists,—and such landlords are not\r\nplentiful,—the police interpose at the last moment. Besides, money to\r\npay for a hall is not always forthcoming, and the hesitancy of even the\r\nwarmest sympathisers to compromise themselves by appearing publicly in\r\nthe company of the _camarades_ has to be reckoned with. But the\r\nanarchist has ways of holding a mass meeting—without holding it—that\r\nare worth two of holding it in the stereotyped fashion, and that speak\r\nvolumes for his resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nOne of his favourite devices is to get himself named in due form a\r\ncandidate for the Chamber, which gives him the right to cover the walls\r\nof the government buildings with unstamped posters[4] and the free use\r\nof the public-school property for meetings. “Several _camarades_ are\r\nastonished” (I quote from a number of _Le Libertaire_) “to see Libertad\r\na candidate. Reassure yourselves. With his customary enthusiastic and\r\ncommunicative eloquence he exposes in his meetings the imbecility and\r\nthe infamy of the parliamentary system. Paraf-Javal seconds him with his\r\nmarvellous talent as a logician. Between them they are doing an\r\nexcellent and useful work. At the last meeting an auditor—to carry out\r\nthe farce of the campaign rally—proposed a resolution which was not\r\nvoted, but which was gayly read by Libertad in the midst of general\r\napprobation. You will perceive by this resolution that our _camarade_ is\r\nnot on the point of occupying a seat in the _Palais-Bourbon_:—\r\n\r\n   “‘The electors assembled in the school building of the\r\n   Boulevard de Belleville, after having listened to the bogus\r\n   candidate Libertad and the _camarade_ Paraf-Javal, conclude\r\n   (agreeing thus at every point with the candidate himself) that\r\n   voting is too stupid to be thought of, and that liberty of\r\n   opinion, like every other liberty, is not to be asked for, but\r\n   to be taken, whatever the obstacles. They are determined to\r\n   send packing all the genuine candidates in whom they see only\r\n   imbeciles or knaves.’”\r\n\r\nThe anarchist’s sense of humour, you see, is much more highly developed\r\nthan is ordinarily supposed. Nothing tickles this sense of humour more\r\nthan to pack the meetings of his antagonists, the bourgeois politicians,\r\ndivert these meetings from their primitive object by virtue of numbers,\r\naddress, strength of lung, hardness of fist, or all of these combined,\r\nand so carry on his propaganda at the expense of the very persons it is\r\ndirected against.\r\n\r\nHe effects this peacefully, as a rule, if his numbers are overwhelmingly\r\nsuperior. In this case it is very much an affair of bravado and\r\nlungs. He simply elects a _bureau_[5] to his mind—for so good\r\nan end he is more than willing to stifle his scruples against\r\nparliamentarianism—and, having installed a number of the _camarades_\r\nupon the platform, carries on the meeting with his own orators and as\r\nnearly in his own fashion as circumstances permit; of course, not\r\nwithout more or less noise and abusive protest, if the adherents of the\r\noriginal cause remain in the audience.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the numbers are more evenly matched, the interlopers,\r\nwithout attempting to capture the organisation of the meeting, make a\r\ndash for the front at a preconcerted signal, scale the platform as\r\nthough it were a rampart, throw down every member of the _bureau_ into\r\nthe body of the house, and send the speaking-desk with its pitcher and\r\nglass of _eau sucrée_, the secretary’s table, and all the rest of the\r\nplatform paraphernalia flying after them. Then, if resistance is offered\r\non the floor of the hall, a pitched battle ensues, and the possession of\r\nthe platform (except as it gives the advantage of position and an\r\nadmirable chance to strut, game-cock fashion) counts for little, in the\r\nutter impossibility of getting heard, even if it is maintained, which it\r\nis not always, there being instances on record of the platform being\r\ntaken and retaken, quite as if it were a strategic redoubt, several\r\ntimes in a single evening. Supposing, however, that the interlopers\r\nfollow up the platform victory by another victory in the body of the\r\nhall, and succeed in ejecting the rightful occupants completely; the\r\ndispossessed, if they are not able to call up re-enforcements for a\r\nre-entry and renewal of the conflict, have no other redress than to\r\npersuade the proprietor of the hall to vacate it by cutting off the gas\r\nsupply or by summoning the police. Either way, they gain nothing but the\r\nemptiest sort of dog-in-the-manger vengeance, since they cannot hope to\r\nresume their own interrupted meeting.\r\n\r\nDuring the days succeeding the Dreyfus affair, when excitement was\r\nrunning high over the struggle between the nationalists and the\r\nsocialists for the control of the Paris municipal council, a great\r\nnationalist mass meeting (“_une grande réunion patriotique_”), to be\r\npresided over by a nationalist deputy and addressed by other celebrities\r\nof the party, was announced for half-past eight of a certain Friday\r\nevening, in the assembly room of the Tivoli-Vauxhall, close by the Place\r\nde la République. On the morning of the night set for the meeting all\r\nthe nationalist organs printed the following item:—\r\n\r\n   “We are informed at the last moment that the anarchists are\r\n   coming in force to-night to our patriotic meeting at\r\n   Tivoli-Vauxhall in order to prevent its being held and to\r\n   transform it into a demonstration of _sans-patrie._ They\r\n   propose to wave the red and the black flag. We are obliged,\r\n   therefore, much to our regret, to take measures to prevent the\r\n   entrance of our adversaries, and must limit the entries\r\n   strictly to those who are provided with invitations.\r\n   Invitations may be had by applying at,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the revolutionary organs of the same morning printed\r\nthe following:—\r\n\r\n   “The _Comité d’Action Révolutionnaire_ invites all\r\n   republicans, all socialists, and all _libertaires_\r\n   [_libertaire_ is a euphonious name for anarchist] to assist at\r\n   the public meeting organised by the nationalists for this\r\n   evening, Friday, at 8.30, Tivoli-Vauxhall, rue de la Douane in\r\n   the Château d’Eau Quarter. All the _camarades_ and _citoyens_\r\n   are urged to wear the red eglantine.”\r\n\r\nTo one familiar with Parisian ways these antithetic notices promised a\r\nbeautiful scrimmage. There _was_ a beautiful scrimmage.\r\n\r\nThe doors opened at eight, and during half an hour or more the persons\r\nduly provided with invitations straggled into the hall; while, on the\r\nsidewalk opposite, a hostile crowd of socialists and anarchists, which\r\nthe police had the greatest difficulty in restraining, asserted angrily\r\ntheir right to enter.\r\n\r\nJust as the president of the evening, a phenomenally fat politician,\r\narose to speak, the police lines gave way under the strain put upon\r\nthem; there was a terrific stampede across the street, and before the\r\npublic had time to pull themselves together again and before the\r\nticket-takers could oppose the slightest resistance or really knew what\r\nwas happening, more than two thousand persons without invitations had\r\ninvaded the hall.\r\n\r\n   “_Vive la Sociale!_ _Vive l’Anarchie!_ _A bas l’Armée!_”\r\n   bellowed the invaders.\r\n\r\n   “_Vive le Drapeau!_ _Vive Rochefort!_ _Vive l’Armée!_”\r\n   screamed the invaded.\r\n\r\nAnd, presto! pandemonium reigned.\r\n\r\nIn vain the elephantine president brandished his bell and pounded on the\r\ntable. In vain he made a speaking trumpet with his hands and roared\r\nthrough it for order. The antagonistic yells mounted, collided, cracked,\r\nand exploded in mid air.\r\n\r\n   “_A bas la Calotte!_”—“_Vive l’Armée!_”\r\n\r\n   “_Mort aux Juifs!_”—“_A bas Drumont!_”\r\n\r\n   “_A bas Zola!_”—“_Vive Loubet!_”\r\n\r\n   “_Vive l’Internationale!_”—“_Vive le Drapeau!_”\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the hall, to the air of _Les Lampions_, a surging band\r\nchanted,—\r\n\r\n   _“Déroulède à Charenton,[6]\r\n     Déroulède à Charenton,\r\n         Ton taine,\r\n     Déroulède à Charenton,\r\n     Déroulède à Charenton,\r\n         Ton ton.”_\r\n\r\nAnd in the front of the hall another surging band retorted, to the same\r\nair,—\r\n\r\n   _“Conspuez Loubet!\r\n     Conspuez Loubet!\r\n       Conspuez!”_\r\n\r\n“_Enlevez l’homme tonneau!_” (Away with the hogshead-man!) a shrill and\r\nmocking voice in one corner piped.\r\n\r\n   “ENLEVEZ L’HOMME TONNEAU!!”\r\n\r\na hundred, five hundred, a thousand voices caught up the derisive cry.\r\n\r\n   “ENLEVEZ L’HOMME TONNEAU!!!”\r\n\r\nthe whole two thousand interlopers bawled.\r\n\r\nAnd, bawling thus, they seethed on to the platform like a wave, lifted\r\nthe frantically gesticulating “_homme-tonneau_” and his two hundred of\r\navoirdupois clean off his feet, and, receding with multitudinous\r\nlaughter, swept him down the aisle and out through the door as if he\r\nwere a chip, and all his satellites and followers in the wake of him.\r\n\r\nThe new broom of the proverb never swept one-half so clean. Not a\r\nnationalist, at least not a nationalist who dared to raise a nationalist\r\ncry, was left in the hall. The socialists and anarchists were in\r\ncomplete possession; but the real scrimmage of the evening was yet to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nA _bureau_ was chosen in which the two parties were about equally\r\nrepresented, and a resolution was passed branding the nationalists as\r\ntools of the bourgeois and as royalist reactionaries more dangerous than\r\nthe royalists themselves. Then a socialist, in an excess of zeal, made\r\nthe blunder of introducing a resolution committing the meeting to the\r\nsupport of a certain socialist candidate for the municipal council. The\r\nanarchists, holding to their cardinal principle of non-participation in\r\nelections, vigorously dissented. Hot words followed; the crucial\r\ndifferences between the doctrines were evoked and emphasised; old\r\ninjuries were recalled; old disputes were raked up; old sores were\r\nprobed and laid open. Plainly, the hall was much too small for both.\r\n\r\nFrom furious debate the meeting went to still more furious shouts and\r\ncounter-shouts. _Vive l’Anarchie_, which had so lately locked arms with\r\n_Vive la Sociale_, now confronted it and hissed threatenings and curses\r\nin its teeth. And from shouts (there being no “_homme-tonneau_” to\r\nkindle saving laughter) the meeting went to blows. Fists, canes,\r\numbrellas, chairs, and benches cleaved the air; shoes battered shins and\r\nheads concaved stomachs; clothes were torn, hats crushed in and trampled\r\nunder foot; furniture was dismembered, and mirrors, windows, and gas\r\nglobes were shattered. The field days of the French Chamber were left\r\nfar in the rear, so was even the legendary South Boston Democratic\r\ncaucus. The pushing, pulling, pounding, kicking, scratching, biting, and\r\nbutting, the oaths and calls for help, the howls, growls, and yelps of\r\nbaffled rage and pain, would need the pen of a French Fielding to\r\ndescribe and transcribe.\r\n\r\nFinally, the socialists passed out by the same door as the nationalists,\r\nand in very much the same fashion. But the anarchists had barely time to\r\ncatch their breath and to pronounce the socialists “the tools of the\r\nbourgeois and the most dangerous of reactionaries, because the most\r\ndisguised,” when the police arrived, and with their fateful “_Messieurs,\r\nla réunion est dissoute_,” backed up by the extinction of the gas,\r\nevacuated the hall.\r\n\r\nOnce in the street, the anarchists were _solidaire_ again with the\r\nsocialists against their common bourgeois enemies, the nationalists.\r\nWhat is more, all three were _solidaire_ against their common enemy, the\r\npolice; and the latter were forced to call on their reserves and a body\r\nof the _Garde Républicaine_ to disperse the rioters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAULED TO DEATH FOR SHOUTING, “VIVE L’ARMÉE!”]\r\n\r\nThe joint debates (_assemblées contradictoires_) which are held, now and\r\nthen, during the political campaigns, are very apt to degenerate into\r\nsimilar scrimmages. As a rule, such encounters—there must be a special\r\nprovidence for scrimmages as there is for lovers—work no great harm\r\nbeyond bruises to those engaged in them; but fatal results are not\r\nunknown. Not long ago, at an anti-militarist meeting in the hall of the\r\n“_Mille Colonnes_,” a man who had the bad taste or the misplaced courage\r\nto cry, “_Vive l’Armée!_” was quickly mauled to death by the infuriate\r\naudience. This was not an “_assemblée contradictoire_,” it is true; but,\r\nif it had been, the outcome would probably have been the same.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to say, however, that the anarchists, on such occasions,\r\nare not more intolerant than others. There is no certainty that a man\r\nwould have fared better who, alone, in a patriotic assembly at that time\r\nhad raised the cry, “_A bas l’Armée!_”\r\n\r\nThe anarchist, with all his haughty insistence on directness and\r\nsincerity, is not totally averse to taking or administering the\r\nsugar-coated pill. He has _punchs-conférences_ (punch-talks) and\r\n_soupes-conférences_ (soup-talks), the former for himself, the latter\r\nfor others. At the _punch-conférence_ he washes down the word with the\r\nbeverage of his choice,—more often wine, coffee, or beer than the punch\r\nwhich gives the name. At the _soupe-conférence_ he dispenses to hungry\r\nvagabonds the soup that sustains life and the doctrines that, to his\r\nmind, explain it and make it worth while; precisely as the city\r\nmissionaries and the “Salvation lassies” dispense food and gospel to\r\n“hoboes” at the “mission breakfasts” and “hallelujah lunches” of English\r\nand American cities and large towns.\r\n\r\nIn the summer he has “_ballades de propagande_,”—picnic trips into the\r\ncountry, which are given a serious turn by doctrinal speeches, in the\r\nopen air, after lunch.\r\n\r\nHe has also—at least he had for a season—his weekly _déjeuners\r\nvégétariens_, at which the somewhat attenuated coating of sugar which a\r\nvegetarian lunch gives to the lecture pill is overlaid with the more\r\nsubstantial sweetness of frolic, song, and badinage.\r\n\r\nHe has his theatre (that is to say, he has his amateur theatricals)\r\nabout which a glamour of mystery and adventure is shed by the fact the\r\ngreater part of the répertoire is under the ban of the censorship.\r\nEntrance to the performances is by invitation only and free. It is thus\r\nthe law is evaded, a fixed and obligatory cloak-room charge replacing\r\nthe fee of admission.\r\n\r\nThe _Maison du Peuple_ of the rue Ramey, which calls itself socialistic\r\nfrom motives of prudence, has a permanent band of actors (_le Théâtre\r\nSocial_) on the border line between professionals and amateurs, who give\r\nevening and matinée performances nearly every Sunday throughout the\r\nwinter and spring, and who occasionally go upon the road.\r\n\r\nA single announcement will suffice to explain the operations of this and\r\nall similar troupes:—\r\n\r\n   “THÉÂTRE SOCIAL.\r\n\r\n   _Maison du Peuple de Paris_, 47 _rue Ramey_ (4, _impasse\r\n   Pers_).\r\n\r\n   “_Camarades_,\r\n\r\n   “Before its departure for Belgium, where it is going to give a\r\n   series of representations of its great success, _L’Exemple_,\r\n   the _Théâtre Social_ has decided to give two other\r\n   representations (evening and matinée) of the piece of\r\n   Chéri-Vinet, at the _Maison du Peuple_, in order to\r\n   accommodate the _camarades_ of the suburban districts.\r\n\r\n   “We invite you, then, _camarades_, to assist at the third and\r\n   fourth representations (_strictly private_) of _L’Exemple_,\r\n   interdicted by the Censorship, the unpublished revolutionary\r\n   drama in 4 acts and 5 tableaux, which will be given Sunday,\r\n   the 31st of March, at two o’clock and at half-past eight\r\n   sharp.\r\n\r\n   “_L’Exemple_ will be preceded by _En Famille_, a piece by\r\n   Méténier in one act.\r\n\r\n   “Obligatory cloak-room fee, ten sous.\r\n\r\n   “Invitations may be procured at the _Maison du Peuple_, 47 rue\r\n   Ramey, at the offices of _L’Aurore_, _La Petite République_,\r\n   and _Le Petit Sou_, and at the house of the _citoyen_ A——,\r\n   number —, rue Championnet.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs at the _Théâtre d’Application_ (formerly _la Bodinière_), the various\r\nindependent theatres, and the “Thursdays” of the _Odéon_, the\r\nperformance of the revolutionary troupe is usually preceded by an\r\nexplanatory or relevant talk either by its author or some well-known\r\nthinker or littérateur. Thus, when Charles Malato’s _Barbapoux_,\r\nannounced as an “_Œuvre Aristophanesque, Symbolico-fantaisiste_,” was\r\nperformed at the _Maison du Peuple_, Malato himself provided an\r\nintroductory lecture, entitled “_Le Cléricalisme et le Nationalisme._”\r\n\r\nAbove all, the anarchist has his _soirée familiale_. For example:—\r\n\r\n   “The anarchist group, _Les Résolus_, announce for _Mardi Gras_\r\n   a grand _soirée familiale et privée_, to begin at nine.\r\n   Concert by amateurs, preceded by a lecture by L. Réville,\r\n   subject ‘_Le Socialisme et l’Anarchie_,’ and followed by a\r\n   ball and a _tombola_ [lottery]. Entrance free. Obligatory\r\n   cloak-room fee, six sous.”\r\n\r\nIn a big, barn-like, crudely lighted, smoke-begrimed, rafter-ceilinged\r\nhall, whose walls are adorned with the painted texts which are anarchy’s\r\ngreat watchwords,\r\n\r\n   NOTRE ENNEMI C’EST NOTRE MAÎTRE\r\n\r\n   LA FONTAINE\r\n\r\n\r\n   LA PROPRIÉTÉ C’EST LE VOL\r\n\r\n   PROUDHON\r\n\r\n\r\n   LA NATURE N’A FAIT NI SERVITEUR NI MAÎTRE\r\n   JE NE VEUX NI DONNER NI RECEVOIR DES LOIS\r\n\r\n   DIDEROT\r\n\r\n\r\n   LE CLÉRICALISME C’EST L’ENNEMI\r\n\r\n   GAMBETTA\r\n\r\n\r\n   NI DIEU NI MAÎTRE\r\n\r\n   BLANQUI\r\n\r\nto the laboured sounds of a patient, plethoric orchestra, the _Résolus_\r\ncouples, some commonplace, some grotesque, and some graceful, dance with\r\nhonest zest; but with a restraint and modesty in striking contrast with\r\nthe reckless _abandon_ of such resorts as the _Moulin Rouge_, maintained\r\nmainly for the prudent depravity of touring English and American men and\r\n(alas!) women, who flock there to fan jaded or hitherto unawakened\r\nsenses into flame, under the flimsy pretext or the fond illusion that\r\nthey are studying French life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BALL AT THE MAISON DU PEUPLE\r\n\r\n   _To the laboured sounds of a patient, plethoric\r\n   orchestra, the couples dance with honest\r\n   zest; but with a restraint and modesty_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANCING AT THE MOULIN ROUGE\r\n\r\n   _in striking contrast with the reckless abandon\r\n   of such resorts as the Moulin Rouge, maintained\r\n   mainly for the prudent depravity of tourists_.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the _soirée familiale_, it is highly diverting to\r\nnote the same advertising dodges on the part of the managers; the same\r\nmeaningless compliments to performers on the part of those who introduce\r\nthem; the same ill-concealed impatience on the part of the audience\r\nduring the serious part of the exercises for the dancing to begin; the\r\nsame fluttering preoccupation with ribbons, robes, coiffures, and\r\naigrettes, and the same jealousies of superior beauty, superior style,\r\nand more numerous or assiduous adorers on the part of the young women;\r\nand the same fussy solicitude on the part of doting mammas to have their\r\ndaughters dance with the young men that are “likely” as in assemblies\r\nthat do not occupy themselves with lofty ideas and ideals; also the same\r\ntiptoeing excitement over the drawing of the _tombola_ as in the\r\n_soirées_ of the working people, who do not profess a contempt for gain.\r\n\r\nBut he would be a precipitate reasoner, not to say a sorry churl, who\r\nshould pounce on these little charming inconsequences as refutations of\r\nthe anarchist theory, or should even call attention to them as other\r\nthan reassuring evidence that the anarchist is a very human and likable\r\nbeing, not unaffected with amiable vices, and that he is not the abject\r\nslave of that angular consistency which, if it be a virtue at all, is\r\nthe most unlovely of all the virtues. Your sound anarchist will probably\r\ntell you that he is sincerely ashamed of these failings, that they are\r\ndeplorable relics of the old spirit of over-reaching which cannot, in\r\nthe nature of the case, be entirely expelled so long as the old social\r\nrégime continues. But this apology is so familiar, so threadbare even,\r\nit has been proffered so many, many times by so many very different\r\nsorts of people, that you prefer to ignore it, and attribute the\r\nanarchist’s dainty peccadilloes to the good old human nature which has\r\nalways made men so much more companionable—let us guard ourselves\r\nagainst saying so much better—than their creeds.\r\n\r\nIn all the anarchist assemblies—the group meetings, the congresses, the\r\nmass meetings, and the various social and semi-social evenings—the\r\n_trimardeur_ is a noteworthy figure. The _trimardeur_[7] (literally,\r\npilgrim of the great road) is a _camarade_ who devotes himself to\r\nwinning converts while making his tour of France. He has a certain\r\nkinship with the ancient bard, the mediæval troubadour and itinerant\r\nfriar, and the German apprentice on his _Wanderjahre_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TRIMARDEUR DISPUTING WITH SOCIALISTS]\r\n\r\nBut he is chiefly interesting as being the nearest modern approach to\r\nthe early Christian apostle and the most perfect embodiment of the\r\nmissionary spirit in existence. Figure him as the contemporary\r\nmissionary or missionary agent minus a salary and a domicile,—if you\r\ncan imagine such an anachronistic phenomenon!\r\n\r\nHe is usually a skilful and reliable workman who has lost his job from\r\nhis irresistible propensity to spread radical ideas among his\r\nfellow-workmen or for his active connection with a strike. He sets out\r\non his proselyting tour “with neither purse nor scrip nor shoes,”\r\n“neither bread, neither money” almost literally; and, literally, without\r\n“two coats.” In the country he mingles with the peasants and farm\r\nlabourers, sleeping under their roofs, “eating and drinking such things\r\nas they give,” and converting as many as he may, sure of a welcome, for\r\nthat matter, wherever there is a lodge—and where is there not?—of that\r\nmost fraternal of all freemasonries,—discontent. In the cities he works\r\nduring his sojourn, if work is to be had; and, when he “goes out of a\r\ncity,” he blesses that city if it has “received” him, and “he shakes off\r\nthe very dust from his feet as a testimony against it” if it has\r\n“received him not.”\r\n\r\nThe origin, methods, and manners of the _trimardeur_ have been well\r\ndescribed by one Flor O’Squarr. I take up his description at the point\r\nwhere the incipient _trimardeur_ has been turned away by his employer.\r\n“He offers his labour to the factory opposite, to the foundry adjacent.\r\nVain proceeding! Unfavourable reports immediately follow him or have\r\npreceded him there. The employers also combine. He will be received\r\nnowhere except by mistake and for a short time. At the beginning this\r\nconspiracy of the world against him surprises and disturbs him. He\r\nexclaims: ‘What have I done to them, then? Why do they drive me away\r\nthus, as they would a mangy or vicious cur? I have defended my interests\r\nand those of my fellows. It was my right, after all.’\r\n\r\n   “Later he discerns injustice in this persistent\r\n   hostility,—bourgeois injustice, _parbleu!_ This discovery\r\n   provokes in him the idea of revolt, as a draught of alcohol\r\n   inflames the blood. Persecution has begun then. Well, let it\r\n   be so! He will accept it, not without pride. The theory of\r\n   anarchy sinks a little deeper into his brain, after the manner\r\n   of a spike on which the employers have tried their sledges.\r\n   Then he buckles his belt, turns up his pantaloons, tightens\r\n   his shoe-lacing, and gains the _trimard_ with a few sous in\r\n   his pocket, _en route_ for the nearest large town, where he\r\n   hopes to find employment and an unworked field for his\r\n   neophytic zeal.\r\n\r\n   “If he sets out from Angers, from Trélazé, for instance, he\r\n   tramps as far as Nantes, where he improvises himself porter or\r\n   stevedore along the quays of the Loire, undertaking with the\r\n   rashest indifference any occupation for which only muscle is\r\n   required....\r\n\r\n   “Signalled anew, ... our man rebuckles his belt, turns up\r\n   again his pantaloons, retightens his shoe-lacing, and gains\r\n   the _trimard_ with a few sous in his pocket, headed towards\r\n   St. Nazaire or Brest, towards Rennes or towards Cherbourg,\r\n   towards any city whatsoever in which he can hope to earn his\r\n   bread and convert men. Along the road he manages to get\r\n   shelter on the farms, and he carries on his propaganda among\r\n   the peasantry.\r\n\r\n   “This tireless fanaticism will carry him through Normandy\r\n   towards the regions of the north. He will be expelled from the\r\n   spinning-mills of Rouen, the glass-works of Douai, the mines\r\n   of Anzin, the forges of Fives. From there he will pass into\r\n   Belgium, always ‘on the hoof’ (_à pattes_) and on the\r\n   _trimard_: he will visit Brussels, where the marvellous\r\n   workingmen’s organisations of Brasseur and Jean Volders will\r\n   make him shrug his shoulders,—‘Fudge, all that! authoritative\r\n   socialism, that’; Antwerp, which will detain him a week, a bit\r\n   disconcerted by the machine; Liège and Scraing, which will\r\n   keep him a month; le Borinage, which he will contemplate as a\r\n   promised land. Perhaps he will go into Germany, the vast\r\n   Germany so inclement to anarchy,—that is, if he does not\r\n   descend into the east by the Luxembourg, and gain the Jura by\r\n   the Vosges.\r\n\r\n   “In two or three years he will have seen many districts and\r\n   many countries, and will have scattered behind him everywhere,\r\n   indifferently, seeds of revolt without troubling himself about\r\n   the nature of the ground. His information will be considerably\r\n   augmented. He will have made good by experience the defects of\r\n   his education. He will know various languages and _patois_,\r\n   having spoken Breton at Vannes, Normand at Caen, Walloon at\r\n   Namur, Flemish at Gand, Marollien at Brussels, German in the\r\n   east or in Switzerland; and, like the cosmopolitan Bohemian\r\n   who had learned to borrow five francs in all the tongues of\r\n   the world, he will have become capable of preaching anarchy in\r\n   all the ‘_argots_.’...\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EVENING IN A CABARET\r\n\r\n   “_The little wine-shop concerts at\r\n    which every person present is\r\n    expected to do his turn._”]\r\n\r\n   “If during his travels the _trimardeur_ has not acquired fine\r\n   manners, at least he has acquired some very extended notions\r\n   on customs and industries. He will know, without referring to\r\n   a note, by a simple habit of memory, the distribution of the\r\n   revolutionary contingents, here, there, and everywhere, in\r\n   labour unions or socialist or anarchist groups, and the\r\n   efficacy of each; what can be attempted at Montpellier, what\r\n   is possible at Calais, how the iron is extracted at\r\n   Mont-Canigan, and how it is worked at St. Chamond; why the\r\n   fitters of the Seine are better paid than those of Nevers or\r\n   Creuzot; where one stands a chance of being welcomed if one\r\n   has been driven from the workshops of la Ciotat; by what\r\n   artifice one may travel gratuitously in the baggage-cars of\r\n   the company of the Midi, etc., etc. This miscellaneous\r\n   information is not a bad substitute for science, and forms in\r\n   fact a sort of fund of practical science very useful in the\r\n   every-day life.”\r\n\r\n   “_Nous partons tous faire le tour du monde\r\n     Quand nous manquons de travail et de pain;\r\n     Et cependant notre terre féconde\r\n     Produit assez pour tout le genre humain,\r\n     Nos exploiteurs veulent jouir sans cesse:\r\n     Dans tous nos maux ils trouvent un plaisir.\r\n     Nous travaillons pour créer la richesse,\r\n     Et de misère il nous faudrait mourir?_”\r\n\r\n   REFRAIN.\r\n\r\n   “_Allons, debout! les Trimardeurs,\r\n     Tous les hommes, enfin, veulent l’indépendance;\r\n     Supprimons donc nos exploiteurs,\r\n     Afin d’avoir le droit de vivre dans l’aisance._”\r\n\r\nSo runs the first stanza of the _Chant des Trimardeurs_; and this\r\n_chanson_, though execrable poetry, is, nevertheless, amply suggestive\r\nof the spirit of the _trimardeur_, and at the same time fairly\r\nillustrative of the popular revolutionary _chanson_ (_chanson populaire\r\nrévolutionnaire_).\r\n\r\n   “Of all the peoples of Europe,” said Jean-Jacques Rousseau,\r\n   “the French people is the one whose temperament is the most\r\n   inclined to the _chanson_.\r\n\r\n   “The _chanson_ is the Frenchman’s ægis against ennui.... He\r\n   uses it sometimes as a kind of consolation for the losses and\r\n   reverses he sustains. He sings his defeats, his poverty, and\r\n   his ills as readily as his prosperity and his victories.\r\n   Beating or beaten, in abundance or in need, happy or unhappy,\r\n   gay or sad, he sings always. One would say that the _chanson_\r\n   is the natural expression of all his sentiments.”\r\n\r\nFrance’s _chanson populaire_ has always been one of the most important\r\nbreeders and disseminators of social and political discontent. It has\r\nalways kept pace with and frequently forerun revolutions. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that it is looked on by the anarchists as one of\r\nthe most efficacious means of propaganda. The circulation among the\r\nmasses of songs of revolt (_chansons de propagande_) is vigorously\r\ncarried on by a number of revolutionary publishing concerns, which\r\nretail them at two sous each[8] and wholesale them at fr. 4.50 a\r\nhundred, and which also distribute them gratuitously as often as a\r\n_camarade_ or sympathiser will provide a fund for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn these _chansons_, logic is deliberately ignored, and metaphysics and\r\nethics are very little meddled with. All the subtleties and refinements\r\nof the doctrine, all the gentleness and sweet reasonableness of the\r\naccredited expounders of the doctrine, are crowded out by the necessity\r\nfor the simple, downright, direct appeal to the passion which is the\r\n_chanson’s_ peculiar province.\r\n\r\nThe very titles of these _chansons de propagande_ show that their\r\npurpose is inflammation rather than persuasion. Notice a few of them:—\r\n\r\n“_Ouvrier, prends la Machine!_” “_Crevez-moi la Sacoche_” (money-bag)!\r\n“_Fusille les Voleurs_,” _Les Briseurs d’Images_, _Le Drapeau Rouge_,\r\n_Le Réveil_, “_Vivement, Brav’ Ouvrier!_” _La Chanson du Linceul_.\r\n\r\nWhen proselytism is not sufficiently pronounced in the _chansons_\r\nthemselves, caustic foot-notes make up the deficiency. Thus this\r\ndefinition of the word _députés_: “Deputies are persons who make rules\r\nfor others and exceptions for themselves.”\r\n\r\nThese _chansons_, besides being sung in the various anarchist functions,\r\nappear, along with ballads, amorous ditties, and the topical songs of\r\nthe day, on the programmes of the little wine-shop concerts of the\r\nfaubourgs, at which each and every person present is expected to “do his\r\nturn” and all are counted on to help out with the choruses. These\r\ndiminutive faubourg concert halls are the lineal descendants of the\r\nfamous historic workingmen’s _goguettes_ and _guinguettes_ into which\r\nthe great Déjazet was happy to escape and from which the thought and the\r\nspirit of revolt were never far distant. “Behind their closed doors,”\r\nsays Jules Claretie, “the government was roundly berated, the couplets\r\nof the _chansonniers_ there becoming for it more redoubtable than the\r\nfiercest articles of the press.”\r\n\r\nThe _chansons de propagande_—the more catchy, least compromising of\r\nthem, that is—are sung in the public squares and on the street corners\r\nof the working districts by the itinerant musicians, who are at all\r\nseasons, but especially at fête times, a picturesque feature of Paris\r\nstreets, and who conduct so many open-air singing schools, as it were,\r\nin that they teach their motley audiences to sing the songs they have\r\nthe wit to sell them.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the anarchist _chansons_ ever see the types. The majority\r\neither circulate in handwriting among the groups or, without having been\r\ntaken down, are transmitted orally, like the mediæval folk-songs or the\r\nHomeric lays, suffering, like those, all sorts of modifications and\r\ncorruptions of text in the transmission.\r\n\r\nOf the _chansons populaires révolutionnaires_ which have come down to\r\nthe present from the Great Revolution, the _Marseillaise_, a true\r\n_chanson de propagande_ in its time, well called by Lamartine “the\r\nfire-water of the Revolution,” is not in favour with the orthodox\r\nanarchists, because it is essentially patriotic and uses the offensive\r\nword _citoyen_. The “_Ça Ira_” is still sung by the anarchists, but not\r\nalways to its original words. The _Père Duchêne_, a part of which dates\r\nfrom the Directoire, is sung mainly by the coal-miners of the region of\r\nthe Loire. The _Carmagnole_ alone—the saucy, rollicking, explosive,\r\ndiabolic _Carmagnole!_—has held its own against all new-comers,\r\nchanging, but losing nothing of its sauciness, its explosiveness, and\r\nits diabolism as it has passed from the versions of 1792-93 through its\r\nseven clearly defined texts to the version of the memorable strike of\r\nMontceau-les-Mines in 1883.\r\n\r\nAfter the execution of Ravachol[9] the airs of the “_Ça Ira_” and the\r\n_Carmagnole_ were combined into a chanson called _La Ravachole_, which,\r\nin spite of this hybrid origin, may fairly be classed as the latest and\r\nby far the most vindictive version of the _Carmagnole_.\r\n\r\nLA RAVACHOLE\r\n\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n   _Dans la grande ville de Paris (bis)\r\n    Il y a des bourgeois bien nourris, (bis)\r\n    Il y a les miséreux\r\n    Qui ont le ventre creux.\r\n    Ceux-là ont les dents longues,\r\n    Vive le son, vive le son,\r\n    Ceux-là ont les dents longues,\r\n    Vive le son\r\n    D’ l’explosion._\r\n\r\n    REFRAIN\r\n\r\n   _Dansons la Ravachole,\r\n    Vive le son, vive le son,\r\n    Dansons la Ravachole,\r\n    Vive le son\r\n    D’ l’explosion.\r\n    Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira,\r\n    Tous les bourgeois goût’ront d’ la bombe,\r\n    Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira,\r\n    Tous les bourgeois on les saut’ra,\r\n    On les saut’ra._\r\n\r\n\r\n    II\r\n\r\n   _Il y a les magistrats vendus, (bis)\r\n    Il y a les financiers ventrus, (bis)\r\n    Il y a les argosins;\r\n    Mais pour tous ces coquins\r\n    Il y a d’ la dynamite,\r\n    Vive le son, vive le son,\r\n    Il y a d’ la dynamite,\r\n    Vive le son\r\n    D’ l’explosion!_\r\n\r\n   _Dansons, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    III\r\n\r\n   _Il y a les sénateurs gâteux, (bis)\r\n    Il y a les députés véreux, (bis)\r\n    Il y a les généraux,\r\n    Assassins et bourreaux,\r\n    Bouchers en uniforme,\r\n    Vive le son, vive le son,\r\n    Bouchers en uniforme,\r\n    Vive le son\r\n    D’ l’explosion._\r\n\r\n   _Dansons, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV\r\n\r\n   _Il y a les hôtels des richards (bis)\r\n    Tandis que les pauvres déchards (bis)\r\n    A demi-morts de froid\r\n    Et souffrant dans leurs doigts.\r\n    Refilent la comète,\r\n    Vive le son, vive le son,\r\n    Refilent la comète,\r\n    Vive le son\r\n    D’ l’explosion._\r\n\r\n   _Dansons, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    V\r\n\r\n   _Ah, nom de dieu, faut en finir!

The barricades of those agitated periods rang with lyric\r\nimprovisations born of the ferment and frenzy of the hour. The authors\r\nwere oftener clerks or day labourers than they were poets or\r\nprofessional _chansonniers_, and their songs, many of the best of which\r\nhave survived, were genuine songs of the people. But the one supremely\r\ngreat _chanson populaire révolutionnaire_ of the last half of the\r\ncentury just closed, a song as striking in its way as the _Carmagnole_,\r\nthe “_Ça Ira_,” the _Père Duchêne_, or the _Marseillaise_, is the\r\n_Internationale_. Wherever there is revolt or faith in revolt,\r\nbrotherhood or yearning after brotherhood, this stupendous hymn of the\r\nreligion of humanity (for it is much more a hymn than a _chanson_) is\r\nfervidly and reverently sung. The _Internationale_ has something of the\r\nprofundity and awfulness of Martin Luther’s “_Ein’ Feste Burg_.” Like\r\nthat marvellous psalm, it is at once uplifting and crushing. In concept\r\nit is probably the biggest song of liberty that has ever been written.\r\nIt is surely the biggest in this respect of all the French revolutionary\r\n_chansons_. As the _Marseillaise_, with its fierce, defiant staccatos\r\nand fiery, resistless appeal, is the perfect lyric expression of the\r\nfury of onset (_furia francese_) in the field, and as the _Carmagnole_,\r\nwith its madly reeling, rolling, booming rhythms and its terrible,\r\nmocking, blasphemous mirth, is the perfect lyric expression of the\r\ndrunkenness and dare-devilness of mobs and barricades, so the\r\n_Internationale_, with its slow, solemn, stately measure and its\r\nuniversal reach of feeling and of thought, is the perfect lyric\r\nexpression of the eternal might and majesty of humanity. Hearing it, it\r\nis as if one heard the cadenced beat of the million-millioned tread of\r\nthe advancing race, sweeping all barriers of pride and prejudice before\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the meetings, the numerous stanzas of the _Carmagnole_ and the\r\n_Internationale_ are generally delivered as a solo from the platform by\r\na _camarade_ who is blessed with a good memory and exceptional lung\r\npower, the audiences leaping into the choruses. The effect is invariably\r\ninspiriting, whatever the personality of the soloist or the quality of\r\nhis voice, and whatever the composition and the voices of the audience.\r\nIndeed, these two _chansons_ seem to belong to that rare sort of music\r\nwhich cannot be spoiled by bad, if it be not half-hearted, execution. So\r\nthat there is conviction behind it, it carries,—the music in which\r\nsincerity and fervour atone for all defects of pitch, key, and voice.\r\n\r\nIn the open air, the more familiar stanzas are sung in unison just as is\r\nthe _Marseillaise_, just as are the songs of the students, and just as\r\nare, for that matter, all the songs of the people in France,—a method\r\nby which a great deal more is gained in lilt and concentration (where\r\nonly the primal emotions are concerned) than is lost in charm. And I\r\ndefy any one who has a drop of red blood in him to be at the centre of\r\nseveral thousand excited people who are shouting the _Marseillaise_, the\r\n_Internationale_, or the _Carmagnole_, and not join in, even though his\r\nevery instinct and belief be anti-revolutionary and he has neither voice\r\nnor ear. He who has not shared the surging and chanting of an angry\r\nParis mob has only half experienced the popular thrill, and can have\r\nonly half an idea what solidarity of emotion means.\r\n\r\nThe _Internationale_ is as much the rallying cry of the opening of the\r\ntwentieth century as the _Marseillaise_ was of the opening of the\r\neighteenth; and it would not be surprising if its author, Eugène\r\nPottier, who is already called by the faithful “the Tyrtæus of the\r\nSocial Revolution,” should win ultimately the same sort of an apotheosis\r\nas Rouget de Lisle won by the _Marseillaise_.\r\n\r\nPoor Pottier, who died in 1887 at seventy-one years of age, saw only the\r\nbeginning of the phenomenal vogue of his masterpiece as a revolutionary\r\nslogan.\r\n\r\nPottier was one of the few who dared to speak his mind freely during the\r\nSecond Empire, and was a prominent figure on the barricades of both 1848\r\nand 1871. He was proscribed for his participation in the Commune, but\r\nescaped to America, where he remained till amnesty was declared. Unable\r\nto work steadily at his trade after his return, because his natural\r\nemployers resented the part he had taken in the organisation of his\r\ncraft, as well as his share in the Commune, and systematically neglected\r\nas a poet and song-writer by the bourgeois press, his poverty was\r\nterrible at times,—so terrible that it is no hyperbole to say that many\r\nof his best pieces were written with his heart’s blood. They were real\r\ncries of real anguish. His boundless love and pity for the poor and his\r\nincessant struggle for the emancipation of the oppressed turned his\r\nlife—like that of the noble Communard, Blanqui, to whom he dedicated a\r\nmarvellous sonnet—into an uninterrupted series of self-sacrifices; and\r\nhe stands side by side with Blanqui among the finest modern\r\nrevolutionist types. Many of his _chansons_ besides the _Internationale_\r\nhave survived him. He left also a quantity of far from despicable poems.\r\n\r\nThey are legion, the men of the people whom anarchy has inspired of late\r\nyears to sing; but the majority of them are unknown to the general\r\npublic and even to other anarchistic groups than their own. A few,\r\nhowever, have a Parisian reputation for their abilities or\r\neccentricities.\r\n\r\nPaul Paillette, a quaint, picturesque personality, inhabits a\r\ncorrespondingly quaint and picturesque lodging, which he calls his\r\n“_grenier de philosophe_” (philosopher’s garret) on the summit of\r\nMontmartre. He was originally a jeweller; but of late years he has\r\nsupported himself by rendering his own productions and those of Bruant\r\nand Xanrof in the salons of the bourgeois, who gladly pay him for\r\nridiculing and abusing them. He is also a favourite feature of the union\r\nmeetings and _soirées familiales_ in several quarters of the city.\r\n\r\nPaul Paillette can be bitter, caustic, and violent when he chooses; but\r\nhis dominant note is gentle, hopeful, idyllic, and ideal, as the\r\nfollowing _chanson_ from his principal volume, _Les Tablettes d’un\r\nLézard_, testifies:—\r\n\r\n\r\n   HEUREUX TEMPS\r\n\r\n   Air: _Le Temps des Cerises._\r\n\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n   _Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Les humains joyeux auront un gros cœur\r\n            Et légère panse.\r\n    Heureux, on saura, sainte récompense,\r\n    Dans l’amour d’autrui doubler son bonheur!\r\n    Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Les humains joyeux auront un gros cœur._\r\n\r\n\r\n    II\r\n\r\n   _Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    On ne verra plus d’êtres ayant faim\r\n          Auprès d’autres ivres:\r\n    Sobres nous serons et riches en vivres;\r\n    Des maux engendrés ce sera la fin.\r\n    Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Tous satisferont sainement leur faim._\r\n\r\n\r\n    III\r\n\r\n   _Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Le travail sera récréation\r\n          Au lieu d’être peine.\r\n    Le corps sera libre, et l’âme sereine,\r\n    En paix, fera son évolution.\r\n    Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Le travail sera récréation._\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV\r\n\r\n   _Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Les petits bébés auront au berceau\r\n          Les baisers des mères.\r\n    Tous seront choyés, tous égaux, tous frères;\r\n    Ainsi grandira ce monde nouveau.\r\n    Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Les bébés auront un même berceau._\r\n\r\n\r\n    V\r\n\r\n   _Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Les vieillards aimés, poètes-pasteurs,\r\n          Bénissant la terre,\r\n    S’éteindront, béats, sous le ciel mystère,\r\n    Ayant bien vécu, loin de ces hauteurs.\r\n    Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Les vieillards seront de bien doux pasteurs._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LA RENOMMÉE DES POMMES-DE-TERRE FRITES\r\n\r\n   _Fried potatoes sold at\r\n   one sou the package_]\r\n\r\n\r\n    VI\r\n\r\n   _Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Nature sera paradis d’amour;\r\n          Femme souveraine,\r\n    Esclave aujourd’hui, demain notre reine,\r\n    Nous rechercherons tes ordres du jour!\r\n    Quand nous en serons au temps d’anarchie,\r\n    Nature sera paradis d’amour._\r\n\r\n\r\n    VII\r\n\r\n   _Il semble encore loin, ce temps d’anarchie;\r\n    Mais, si loin soit-il, nous le pressentons;\r\n          Une foi profonde\r\n    Nous fait entrevoir ce bienheureux monde\r\n    Qu’hélas! notre esprit dessine à tâtons.\r\n    Il semble encore loin, ce temps d’anarchie;\r\n    Mais, si loin soit-il, nous le pressentons!_\r\n\r\nBrunel, a café garçon by profession, author of _Le Chant des\r\nPeinards_, has been associated with Paul Paillette in organising\r\n_soupes-conférences_ and _déjeuners végétariens_.\r\n\r\nAchille Leroy calls himself “author, publisher, and international\r\nbook-seller,” and his invariable response to the simple salutation,\r\n“_Comment ça va?_” (How goes it?) is:—“_L’idée marche_” (The idea\r\nmoves). He earns his living by selling his own and other iconoclastic\r\nworks at the doors of revolutionary gatherings,[10]—anarchist\r\ngatherings preferred,—scrupulously devoting to the cause whatever he\r\nmay gain beyond the bare necessities. Though an honest, harmless body,\r\nif ever there was one, he is so addicted to the spots where trouble is\r\ngoing on or brewing that he has been arrested many times; for instance,\r\non the day of the 1899 _Grand Prix_ for having cried, “_A bas les\r\nSergots!_” Achille wrote a letter of self-defence at that time which was\r\nprinted in certain of the newspapers and in the _Almanach de la Question\r\nSociale_. He was also defended in the _Journal du Peuple_ by M. Lucien\r\nPerrin, as follows:—\r\n\r\n   “Among the condemnations which evoked violent murmurs from the\r\n   listeners was that of our worthy _camarade_, Achille Leroy,\r\n   the revolutionary publisher. He had bravely cried, ‘_Vive la\r\n   Liberté!_’ when he was seized by the police and maltreated, as\r\n   only these brutes know how. As he was unarmed, and had\r\n   committed no violence, the police officers accused him of\r\n   having cried, ‘_A bas les Sergots!_’ (what a crime!) The ruse\r\n   succeeded, and our friend was condemned to a month of prison\r\n   without reprieve.”\r\n\r\nAuguste Valette, a roving vagabond character, sometimes attached to a\r\nParis _caveau_ (concert-cellar) or _café-concert_ and sometimes to a\r\nstrolling show, gained some little notoriety at the time of the trial of\r\nSalsou for his attempt against the Shah of Persia, and came near being\r\nindicted with Salsou as an accomplice because two violent anarchist\r\npoems by him, dedicated to Salsou, were found among the latter’s papers.\r\n\r\nOther singers of anarchy are Olivier Souêtre, author of _Marianne_ and\r\n_La Crosse en l’Air_, two _chansons_ that enjoy and deserve high favour;\r\nH. Luss, author of _La Défense du Chiffonnier_ and _La Grève de Cholet_;\r\nFélix Pagaud, author of _Les Tueurs_; Daubré, to whom is attributed the\r\nlast stanza of _Père Duchêne_; Hippolyte Raullot, Jacques Gueux,\r\nMartinet de Troyes, Pierre Niton, and Jean la Plèbs, who style\r\nthemselves “_poètes plébéiens_”; Théodore Jean, Luc, Marquisat,\r\nDoublier, etc. It is useless to go on naming them, as their names mean\r\nnothing outside of the revolutionary circles of Paris.\r\n\r\nThey are all most striking individualities, however, ranging all the way\r\nfrom freaks to heroes; and it is the individuality which they lavish on\r\nthe rendering of their _chansons_ that constitutes their drawing power.\r\nYou must hear a Brunel, a Valette, a Paul Paillette, sing his own\r\n_chansons_ to comprehend the influence they exert, since, in simple\r\nprint, the most of these productions seem decidedly flat.\r\n\r\nPère La Purge, the jovial-faced cobbler of the narrow, dark, and\r\ntortuous rue de la Parcheminerie in the Latin Quarter, calls for a\r\nspecial word here, because he perpetuates worthily the revolutionary\r\ntradition of the cobbler.\r\n\r\nPère La Purge is a perfect modern counterpart of the cobblers who\r\nsecreted intended victims of the massacre of St. Bartholomew under the\r\nrefuse of their shops; who, under Richelieu, managed to get letters to\r\nprisoners in the Bastille by sewing them between the soles of the\r\nprisoners’ shoes; who were among the first shop-keepers to set the\r\ntricolor cockade over their shops, and made themselves otherwise\r\nremarked for their zeal in the Revolution; and who, under the\r\nRestoration, played an important revolutionary rôle by placarding the\r\nwalls of their shops with caricatures and _Pasquinades_ (Pasquino, it\r\nshould not be forgotten, was a cobbler) and by secretly circulating\r\nseditious pamphlets and _chansons_.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of machinery to do heeling and soling “while you wait”\r\n(_ressemelage Américain_) is driving out of Paris the old-time cobblers\r\nwho made their shops rendezvous of the opposition and nurseries of\r\nrevolt. But a few of these cobblers still persist; and of these Père La\r\nPurge is the best known, if not the most talented or most dangerous,\r\nexample. His _Chansons du Gars_, which are issued with a superb cover\r\ndesign by Ibels, display a great deal of shrewdness and aptness of\r\nphrase,—\r\n\r\n   “_I ‘a d’ la malice!\r\n    Oui, foi d’ Bap’tiss!_”\r\n\r\nbut his most popular work is the lurid and penny-dreadful _Chanson du\r\nPère La Purge_, which has given him his name.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA CHANSON DU PÈRE LA PURGE\r\n\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n   _Je suis le vieux Père La Purge,\r\n      Pharmacien de l’humanité,\r\n    Contre sa bile je m’insurge\r\n      Avec ma fille, Egalité._\r\n\r\n    REFRAIN\r\n\r\n   _J’ai ce qu’il faut dans ma boutique,\r\n      Sans le tonnerre et les éclairs,\r\n    Pour watriner toute la clique\r\n      Des affameurs de l’Univers._\r\n\r\n\r\n    II\r\n\r\n   _Pendant que le peuple s’étiole\r\n      Sur le pavé, sans boulotter,\r\n    Bourgeoisie, assez de la fiole!\r\n      Avec ma purge il faut compter._\r\n\r\n   _J’ai ce qu’il faut, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    III\r\n\r\n   _J’ai des poignards, des faulx, des piques,\r\n      Des revolvers et des lingots,\r\n    Pour attaquer les flancs uniques\r\n      Des Gallifets et des sergots._\r\n\r\n   _J’ai ce qu’il faut, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV\r\n\r\n   _J’ai du pétrole et de l’essence\r\n      Pour badigeonner les châteaux;\r\n    Des torches pour la circonstance,\r\n      A porter au lieu de flambeaux._\r\n\r\n   _J’ai ce qu’il faut, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    V\r\n\r\n   _J’ai du picrate de potasse,\r\n      Du nitro de chlore à foison,\r\n    Pour enlever toute la crasse\r\n      Du palais et de la prison._\r\n\r\n   _J’ai ce qu’il faut, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    VI\r\n\r\n\r\n   _J’ai des pavés, j’ai de la poudre,\r\n      De la dynamite, oh! crénom!\r\n    Qui rivalise avec la foudre\r\n      Pour vous enlever le ballon._\r\n\r\n   _J’ai ce qu’il faut, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    VII\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Le gaz est aussi de la fête!\r\n      Si vous résistez, mes agneaux,\r\n    Au beau milieu de la tempête\r\n      Je fais éclater ses boyaux._\r\n\r\n   _J’ai ce qu’il faut, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n    VIII\r\n\r\n   _Ma boutique est toute la France,\r\n      Mes succursales sont partout.\r\n    Où la faim pousse à la vengeance,\r\n      Prends la bouteille et verse tout!_\r\n\r\n   _J’ai ce qu’il faut dans ma boutique,\r\n      Sans le tonnerre et les éclairs,\r\n    Pour watriner toute la clique\r\n      Des affameurs de l’Univers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “ENLEVEZ L’HOMME TONNEAU!”]\r\n\r\n   “_For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals\r\n     For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders._”\r\n\r\n   WALT WHITMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE WRITTEN PROPAGANDA OF ANARCHY\r\n\r\n   “_The wonder is that he didn’t take a pair of tongs to hand me\r\n   my paper.

All other attempts to establish a daily\r\nanarchist organ seem to have failed completely,[11] and the _Journal du\r\nPeuple_ lived—if its feeble panting for existence can rightly be called\r\nliving—only a few months. After its demise, M. Faure, as if to conceal\r\nhis defeat, started an anarchist weekly, _Les Plébéiennes_, the good\r\nwill of which he was not slow and, apparently, not too reluctant to turn\r\nover to another anarchist weekly, _Le Libertaire_ (eight pages, price\r\ntwo sous a copy), which had been printed intermittently at Montmartre\r\nfor a considerable period, and which M. Faure himself had been\r\ninstrumental in founding. The public proclamation of the consummation of\r\nthe fusion between _Les Plébéiennes_ and _Le Libertaire_, which, being\r\nthe fusion of two miseries, was at the farthest possible remove from the\r\nup-to-date fusion that goes to the forming of a trust, is of interest\r\nbecause it throws a great deal of light on the make-up of an anarchist\r\npaper, and on the anomalous and difficult position in the newspaper\r\nworld of the anarchist press:—\r\n\r\n   “Because of material difficulties—want of money, to speak\r\n   frankly—the _Libertaire_ was obliged to suspend publication.\r\n   It reappears to-day after a very short eclipse, and we have\r\n   every reason to hope that the regularity of its appearance\r\n   will be exposed to no fresh interruptions....\r\n\r\n   “We have profited by this short, obligatory vacation to\r\n   attempt to group about the _Libertaire_ new forces and more\r\n   numerous signatures; in a word, to take all the measures\r\n   necessary to insure it a vigorous life.... You will see\r\n   elsewhere that our friend Sébastien Faure has interrupted the\r\n   publication of his excellent _Plébéiennes_ in order to rally\r\n   as many readers as possible about the _Libertaire_. It is in\r\n   the _Libertaire_, then, that Sébastien Faure will hereafter\r\n   express his thoughts as often as he shall feel inclined to do\r\n   so.\r\n\r\n   “Furthermore, precious and assiduous collaborators have\r\n   formally promised us regular contributions; namely, Laurent\r\n   Tailhade, who with his incisive and scholarly pen will treat\r\n   especially of the vulgarities of Christianity; Paul Ary Cine,\r\n   who will expose barrack life; Raphaël Dunois, who will\r\n   chronicle and interpret the labor movement; Georges Pioch,\r\n   dramatic and literary criticism; J. G. Prodhomme, musical\r\n   criticism; A. R. Vertpré, art criticism; Alfred Griot, review\r\n   of the reviews; Fred-Pol, review of the week; Alfred Bloch,\r\n   scientific _chronique_; A. Harrent, anti-clerical\r\n   _chronique_....\r\n\r\n   “In a word, we are doing what we can. Let our readers on their\r\n   side do what they can in making known the _Libertaire_, in\r\n   seeking new purchasers for it, in sending us financial aid\r\n   sometimes, and in establishing in favour of their organ a\r\n   serious and persevering propaganda.\r\n\r\n   “In this manner we can be certain that we and ours will have a\r\n   journal to voice our opinions, our angers, and our hopes, and\r\n   one which we can depend on to lead the people in the way that\r\n   is frankly ‘_libertaire_’ on the fast-approaching day when it\r\n   is going to be necessary to ‘fight it out,’ when all the\r\n   political parties are going to fall on each other in order to\r\n   retain power or usurp it. We are on the eve of important\r\n   events. It is the moment for all of us to show ourselves, to\r\n   shake off, some of us, our apathy, others of us our egoism, to\r\n   silence all our dissensions, to combine with force will,\r\n   abnegation, and audacity.”—_Le Libertaire._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DORMER-WINDOW OF JEAN GRAVE’S WORKSHOP\r\n\r\n   _Office of “Les Temps Nouveaux,”\r\n   in the rue Mouffetard_]\r\n\r\nOlder, solider, more temperate, more dignified, and—if the word in such\r\na strange connection is permissible—more conservative, indeed so solid,\r\ntemperate, dignified, and conservative that it has been more than\r\nonce referred to as the _Temps_ of the anarchist press, is _Les Temps\r\nNouveaux_, an eight-page weekly, sold, like _Le Libertaire_, at two sous\r\na copy. _Les Temps Nouveaux_ (formerly _La Révolte_, and before that _Le\r\nRévolté_), which was founded at Geneva, Switzerland, by Elisée Reclus\r\nand Pierre Kropotkine more than a quarter of a century ago, has appeared\r\nregularly ever since with only slight interruptions and the few changes\r\nof title that commemorate its encounters with the law. It came to Paris\r\nsoon after its foundation, being forced to emigrate from Switzerland on\r\naccount of the anarchist attempt against the _Palais-Fédéral_ at Berne.\r\nIts most distinguished, and at the same time most distinctive, feature\r\nis a literary supplement made up in considerable part of selections from\r\nthe French and foreign classics and from the writings of contemporary\r\nscientists and littérateurs, not avowed revolutionists, which arraign\r\nthe evils of society or support any one of the articles of the anarchist\r\ncreed. It also reproduces in full addresses by non-anarchist celebrities\r\nin which concessions are made to revolutionary ideals or ideas.\r\n\r\n   “You may seize our journals, our brochures,” says the editor,\r\n   Jean Grave, “you will not prevent the _camarades_ from reading\r\n   what the bourgeois authors have written on the rottenness and\r\n   abjectness of the present hour. This alone is more terrible\r\n   than all the revendications and threats we can accumulate.”\r\n\r\nFrom time to time this supplement serves to make public the addresses\r\nprepared for prohibited anarchist congresses, as in the year of the last\r\nExposition, when it printed the papers which would have been read at the\r\nInternational Anarchist Congress (euphoniously named _Le Congrès Ouvrier\r\nRévolutionnaire Internationale_) if a frightened or over-prudent\r\nministry had not forbidden the sitting of the congress.\r\n\r\nThe contents of all the literary supplements thus far issued have been\r\nclassified under the heads of War, Militarism, Property, Family,\r\nReligion, Law, Justice, The Magistracy, Poverty, Wage-earning, etc., and\r\nthey have been reproduced (with added selections, illustrations, and\r\ncomplete bibliographies) in as many volumes as there are heads.[12]\r\n\r\nThanks, perhaps, to the clever handling of its literary supplement;\r\nthanks, perhaps, to the thoughtfulness and relative tolerance of the\r\nbody of the paper, the _Temps Nouveaux_ has an appreciable circulation\r\namong artists, littérateurs, savants, economists, bibliophiles, and\r\nvarious other sorts of cultured people quite outside of anarchist\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nThe present editor, Jean Grave, is one of the most winning personalities\r\nin the anarchist or any other contemporary movement for reform. A\r\n_Lyonnais_ by origin, a shoemaker and later a printer by trade, Jean\r\nGrave came to Paris in his early manhood. He took part in the Commune,\r\nand was one of the banished after its downfall, passing most of his\r\nexile in Switzerland, where he was intimately associated with Kropotkine\r\nand Reclus.\r\n\r\nAs editor, despite his comparative moderation, he has not been immune\r\nfrom persecution. Like Kropotkine, his predecessor in the editorial\r\nchair, Jean Grave has a fair experimental knowledge of the inside of\r\nprison walls. A thorough man of the people, and proud of the fact,—he\r\nhas always retained his printer’s blouse,—his person and his writings\r\nalike are nevertheless instinct with the most perfect urbanity.\r\n\r\nThere is no more picturesque corner in Paris than that on which, for\r\nmany years now, the _Temps Nouveaux_ has had its office in the top of an\r\naged and mellow six-story building whose ground floor is a wine-shop and\r\nwhose wrinkled roof and plant-bedecked dormer-window overlook the\r\nsixteenth-century church of St. Médard,—no more intimate and engaging\r\nbusiness interior than the paper, book, and brochure bestrewn,\r\nflower-and-print-decorated, slanting-walled loft in which Jean Grave\r\n(veritable “attic philosopher”) and his assistant make up and administer\r\ntheir sheet. Nothing could be more open and kind than the welcome you\r\nget when, having felt your way up a winding stair as damp and dark as a\r\nmediæval donjon-keep, you turn the latch-key, hospitably left in the\r\noutside of the door, and with a premonitory knock enter the loft; always\r\nproviding your entry is courteous and your coming well motived. Indeed,\r\nI know in all Paris nothing morally finer than the example Jean Grave’s\r\ngentle, unassuming life offers of consecration to the ideal.\r\n\r\nThere is something peculiarly significant in the fact that the office of\r\nthis anarchist organ (whose mission is to be, like the university\r\nsettlement, a picket of civilisation carrying light into dark places) is\r\nlocated on the line where the university and the industrial districts\r\noverlap each other, at the very point where the _Quartier Latin_ ceases\r\nand the Faubourgs Coulebarbe and Salpêtrière begin; at the junction of\r\nsuch typical highways as the rue Claude Bernard, passing the _Ecole\r\nNormale_, the rue Monge, in which many students lodge, the broad Avenue\r\ndes Gobelins, with its evening and Sunday animation as a labourers’\r\npromenade, and the steeply ascending rue Mouffetard, with its motley\r\nstreet market for the poor.[13]\r\n\r\nThe _Temps Nouveaux_, the _Libertaire_, and the anarchist weeklies of\r\nthe provinces serve to keep the individual _camarades_, the “groups,”\r\nand the _trimardeurs_ in close touch with each other and with the whole\r\nanarchist body, as well as to narrate events, establish the real\r\nsignificance of the casualty columns of the bourgeois press, and expound\r\nthe doctrine of anarchy. They also lend themselves to mutual relief\r\nwork,—raising subscriptions for the _camarades_ in distress from lack\r\nof employment, and securing comforts for the _camarades_ in prison and\r\nfor their families. They likewise signal _mouchards_ (police spies), and\r\npredict their movements, rehabilitate _camarades_ unjustly accused of\r\nespionage, denounce the crookedness of employers, arrange for lectures,\r\nand, especially, utilise for the best interests of the movement the\r\nvaried information gleaned here, there, and everywhere by _trimardeurs_,\r\nwho are for them so many unsalaried correspondents.\r\n\r\nAn anarchist monthly, _L’Education Libertaire_, has lately been founded\r\nby the _Bibliothèque d’Education Libertaire_ of the Faubourg St.\r\nAntoine, which is not only the organ of the various _Bibliothèques\r\nLibertaires_[14] of Paris and the provinces, but also a review of real\r\nsolidity and distinction.\r\n\r\nIts nature and scope may be judged by a brief excerpt from its first\r\nprospectus:—\r\n\r\n   “_L’Education Libertaire_ will contain:—\r\n\r\n   “I. One or two articles by the writers of note who have\r\n   accorded us their literary collaboration. [Follows a list of a\r\n   score or more collaborators, of whom Pierre Quillard, A. F.\r\n   Hérold, Urbain Gohier, Charles Malato, Henri Rainaldy, and\r\n   Laurent Tailhade have a Parisian or more than Parisian\r\n   reputation.]\r\n\r\n   “II. Certain of the lectures delivered in the _Bibliothèques\r\n   Libertaires_. These lectures will also be printed as\r\n   brochures, which, the type being already set, will cost\r\n   nothing but the paper and printing. We shall get thus the\r\n   brochure at one sou.\r\n\r\n   “III. Articles upon the different theories of education and\r\n   the attempts at ‘_libertaire_’ education, a large subject,\r\n   which will give rise to interesting discussions.\r\n\r\n   “IV. Communications or articles from the _Bibliothèques\r\n   Libertaires_.\r\n\r\n   “V. A concise summary of the month’s happenings, social,\r\n   economic, foreign, scientific, etc.\r\n\r\n   “VI. Criticisms of the books of which we shall receive two\r\n   copies,—one for the library of the review, the other to\r\n   circulate among the libraries which have given in their\r\n   adherence to the review.”\r\n\r\nThe number of _camarades_ who are afflicted with the _cacoethes\r\nscribendi_ being almost as great as those who are afflicted with the\r\n_cacoethes loquendi_, many of the groups have little amateur papers of\r\ntheir own. These amateur papers sometimes remain in manuscript, and are\r\nread aloud in the meetings (very much as in the old-fashioned American\r\nlyceums); are sometimes mimeographed for distribution among the members;\r\nand sometimes are printed, to be sold, by a _camarade_ who has a\r\nhand-press at his disposition,—rarely by a professional printer. When a\r\ngroup which is ambitious for a paper does not feel sufficient unto\r\nitself in literary talent, it solicits outside assistance, thus:—\r\n\r\n   “The group _Les Résolus_ is going to print a journal in the\r\n   form of a brochure. The ‘_copains_’ call upon the _camarades_\r\n   who are willing to collaborate to communicate with the\r\n   _camarade_ Rodor.”\r\n\r\nThe number of anarchist papers in existence is as nothing to the number\r\nthat has disappeared. _Le Riflard_, _L’Attaque_, _La Lutte_, _Le “Ça\r\nIra,” Le Forçat_, _L’Insurgé_, _Le Droit Social_, _L’Etendard\r\nRévolutionnaire_, _Le Défi_, _Le Drapeau Noir_, _L’Affamé_, _Terre et\r\nLiberté_, _L’Audace_, _L’Hydre Anarchiste_, _L’Idée Ouvrière_, _L’Homme\r\nLibre_, _La Révolution Sociale_, _L’Emeute_, _La Liberté Sociale_, _Le\r\nDroit Anarchique_, _La Misère_, _Le Deschard_, _Le Falot_, _L’Idée\r\nLibre_, _Le Père Jean Chiffonier de Paris_, _Le Père Peinard_, and\r\nscores of others have lived and died in Paris and the provinces within\r\nthe last thirty years. Of them all, the most famous, not because the\r\nmost violent, but because the most violent with talent and wit (indeed,\r\nthe most famous incendiary sheet in France since the _Père Duchêne_ of\r\nEugène Vermesch), was the _Père Peinard_. While its circulation was\r\nnever enormous (8,000-15,000 copies), it came to the knowledge of the\r\nbourgeois, and gave them such a turn that it seems likely to remain in\r\nthe public consciousness for at least a generation.\r\n\r\nWith no display of philosophy (which is not saying it had no\r\nphilosophy), it played openly upon the appetites, prejudices, and\r\nrancours of the proletariat. Without reserve or disguise, it incited to\r\ntheft, counterfeiting, repudiation of taxes and rents, killing, and\r\narson. It counselled the immediate assassination of deputies, senators,\r\njudges, priests, and army officers. It advised unemployed workingmen to\r\ntake food for themselves and their families wherever it was to be found,\r\nto help themselves to shoes at the shoe-dealers’ when the spring rains\r\nwet their feet and to overcoats at the clothiers’ when winter winds\r\nnipped them. It urged employed workingmen to put their tyrannical\r\nemployers out of the way, and to appropriate their manufacturing\r\nplants; farm labourers and vintagers to take possession of the farms and\r\nvineyards, and turn the landlords and vine-owners into fertilizing\r\nphosphates; miners to seize the mines and to offer picks to the\r\nstockholders, in case they showed a willingness to work like their\r\nbrother men, otherwise to dump them into the disused shafts; conscripts\r\nto emigrate rather than perform their military service; and soldiers to\r\ndesert or shoot down their officers. It glorified poachers and other\r\ndeliberate breakers of the law. It recounted the exploits of the\r\nolden-time brigands and outlaws, and exhorted moderns to follow their\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nCitations from the _Père Peinard_ are impossible, less because of a\r\nconstantly recurring broadness that is more than broadness (since this\r\nmight easily be dodged in extracts) than because it was written in the\r\npicturesque slang of the faubourg, which can no more be rendered into\r\nEnglish than _Chimmie Fadden_, for instance, could be rendered into\r\nFrench. The very titles of the articles are untranslatable.\r\n\r\nWhatever exception to its morals one may take, one is forced to admit\r\nthat the _Père Peinard_ was a remarkable production in its way. For\r\nblended drollery and diabolism, _camaraderie_ and cynicism, _gaminerie_\r\nand gruesomeness, it would be hard in contemporary writing to find its\r\ncounterpart. Like the unmatched narrative of the shipwreck in the second\r\ncanto of _Don Juan_, it was at once rollicking and horrible, flippant\r\nand terrible, ribald and sublime. In it there was no distinguishing\r\nbetween the antics, grimaces, and piquant impudence of the buffoon and\r\nthe imprecations of the tragedian or the anathemas of the prophet; and,\r\nwhile there were times when the sight of this grinning fury was merely\r\ngrotesque, there were others (seconds, at least) when it was\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nThe _Père Peinard_ was even more a one man’s paper than is Drumont’s _La\r\nLibre Parole_ or Rochefort’s _L’Intransigeant_. Apart from the\r\nillustrations, which were the work of obscure caricaturists now thrice\r\nfamous,—a fact which gives the file a high value with collectors,—it\r\nwas practically all written by its editor, Emile Pouget. Pouget is by\r\ngeneral consent one of the “best fellows in the world.” Nevertheless, he\r\nis no dilettante revolutionist. His grievances against society are very\r\nreal ones. He was forced out of his original occupation as a dry-goods\r\nclerk because he tried to organise his fellow-employees; and he was\r\ncondemned (along with Louise Michel) on disgracefully insufficient\r\nevidence for a misdemeanour in connection with a meeting of the\r\nunemployed, of which he was not guilty. The following account of the\r\naffair is so fully substantiated by the official record of the trial\r\nthat it may be accepted as practically authentic:—\r\n\r\n   “The organisers of this meeting of the unemployed simply had\r\n   in view to bring together on the Esplanade des Invalides the\r\n   greatest number possible of hungry persons. They intended it\r\n   to be less a revolt than a demonstration. They had no thought\r\n   whatever of marching on the Elysée or on the Ministry of the\r\n   Interior. They merely wished to say to the _bourgeoisie_:\r\n   ‘Look at us. We are 20,000 without means of existence.’ And\r\n   the Esplanade des Invalides had been chosen in order that they\r\n   might not be accused of impeding circulation. The police,\r\n   disturbed at the idea of so large a number of men assembling\r\n   in one place, took every precaution to prevent it. They closed\r\n   the Esplanade, and forced those who came to the meeting into\r\n   the streets adjacent, where disorders naturally arose. Certain\r\n   individuals, who really had eaten nothing since the night\r\n   before, invaded three bake-shops. The bake-shops were cleaned\r\n   out in five minutes as if by enchantment.\r\n\r\n   “Pouget had pillaged nothing, planned nothing, directed\r\n   nothing. He was simply overheard to say of these poor devils\r\n   during the pillage: ‘They take bread because they are hungry.\r\n   They are right.’ He repeated it spiritedly in the assize\r\n   court, and he was condemned to eight years of prison for\r\n   ‘incitation to pillage.’ It would have been more precise to\r\n   condemn him for _approbation_ of pillage, since, in point of\r\n   fact, he had not committed any other crime.”\r\n\r\nDuring its entire existence the _Père Peinard_ carried on an extensive\r\ntraffic in brochures, _chansons_, etc., of the same violent nature as\r\nitself. It also published an _Almanack_ for 1894, which is now rare and\r\nmuch prized in book-collecting quarters.\r\n\r\nThe first anarchist _Almanack_ was issued in 1892 by Sébastien Faure,\r\nwho made the laughable and, from the point of view of sale, disastrous\r\nblunder of basing it on the anarchist-hated Gregorian calendar.\r\n\r\nPouget’s _Almanack_, forewarned, avoided this rock of offence. It was a\r\nrehash of his paper, supplemented by a lengthy philosophico-historical\r\ndisquisition on the calendar, appreciations of all the months,\r\nallegorical observations on tides and eclipses, an anarchist chronology,\r\nand a bundle of fantastic predictions,—all in the paper’s highly\r\ncoloured _faubourien_ slang.\r\n\r\n   “If ever,” says Jean Grave somewhere, “the history of this\r\n   movement is written, if ever it is revealed how the anarchist\r\n   publications have lived, how they have amassed sou by sou the\r\n   sums necessary to their appearance, the world will be\r\n   astounded at the proofs of solidarity and devotion which will\r\n   thus be brought to light. It will appreciate what a force\r\n   conviction is, especially among the most disinherited.”\r\n\r\nThere is something pathetic as well as diverting about the forced\r\npreoccupation of the anarchist organs with the question of the money\r\nwhich they consider it a part of their mission to depreciate, something\r\nwell-nigh cruel in the ironical destiny that compels them to be\r\nperpetually harping on the thing which it is one of their pet dreams to\r\nabolish,—to plead on their last pages for the same thing their first\r\npages abuse.\r\n\r\nThis inconsequence between the thought and the deed is not, however, to\r\nbe confounded with hypocrisy. It is accepted because unavoidable, but\r\naccepted sorrowfully and bitterly; and it does not profit individuals.\r\n\r\nIn choosing to depend for their sinews of war on the contributions of\r\nthe _camarades_ rather than on the advertising which would contaminate\r\nand enslave them, the anarchist journals have certainly chosen the\r\nlesser moral evil. There is even a certain Quixotic heroism in this\r\nchoice, which is the more apparent since it is at the price of this\r\ninestimable, if incomplete, moral independence that the socialists are\r\nable to carry on a propaganda of a wider range. By way of compensation\r\nfor their sacrifice in refusing bourgeois advertising, it sometimes\r\nhappens that the anarchist journals are supported, without running the\r\nslightest moral danger, by bourgeois funds. So it was that in the\r\nFaubourg St. Antoine several years ago the anarchist cabinet-makers\r\npreached the annihilation of their employers during several months. The\r\ncabinet-makers founded an organ entitled _Le Pot-à-colle_ (_The\r\nGlue-pot_), in the first number of which they chanced to give one of the\r\nmanufacturers a terrible castigation. The relatively small edition\r\nprinted was sold so fast that the _camarades_ most interested barely\r\nmanaged to get copies. A watch was set on the news-stands of the\r\nfaubourg, and it was discovered that it was the business rivals of the\r\nattacked manufacturers who had snapped up the papers. The discovery was\r\nutilised to such good purpose that the phenomenal popularity of the\r\n_Glue-pot_ continued just as long as there was a manufacturer left in\r\nthe district to “roast.”\r\n\r\nThe following statement of the review _L’Education Libertaire_ to its\r\nsubscribers gives a better idea than pages of explanation by an outsider\r\ncould give of the poverty to which anarchist publications are subject\r\nand of their uphill struggle to get the wherewithal to live:—\r\n\r\n   “TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS\r\n\r\n   “Those of our readers who have followed our attempt month by\r\n   month know by what a slow progression we have arrived at the\r\n   bringing out of this Review.\r\n\r\n   “We shall continue, as in the past, to publish in each number\r\n   the accounts of the preceding number. This will enable the\r\n   readers to appreciate the pecuniary effort that must be made\r\n   if the publication is to be continued.\r\n\r\n   “We have received a hundred francs for this number and forty\r\n   for subsequent numbers. We have lumped the money all together\r\n   to pay in part for this number. We shall not appear again\r\n   until we have in the treasury the necessary sum. It is for our\r\n   readers, if they approve of our attempt, to interest their\r\n   friends in the Review, and engage them to subscribe.\r\n\r\n   “We have accepted subscriptions of three months, six months,\r\n   and one year. By that we mean subscriptions for three numbers,\r\n   six numbers, and twelve numbers. If the state of our treasury\r\n   does not permit us to appear every month, our subscribers\r\n   will, none the less, receive as many numbers as they have\r\n   subscribed for at the rate of ten sous per number. WE FORMALLY\r\n   BIND OURSELVES, having received subscriptions for one year, TO\r\n   PRINT THE REVIEW TWELVE TIMES. As to dates, we guarantee\r\n   nothing. The _camarades_ who are the administrators of this\r\n   journal are workingmen, able to dispense very little money;\r\n   and it would take them long months of self-assessment to get\r\n   together the 200 francs necessary for the publication of each\r\n   number.\r\n\r\n   “To facilitate the diffusion of our Review and the search for\r\n   new subscribers, we have prepared special propagandist\r\n   numbers, which we will send, postpaid, for five sous each to\r\n   readers who are already subscribers. These special numbers\r\n   have printed on every page in red ink, ‘_Read and Circulate_.’\r\n   They may secure subscribers for us if each of us pass one or\r\n   two about in his own circle.\r\n\r\n   “As to the next number, we urge the _camarades_ who have\r\n   subscribed for only three months or six months to make their\r\n   subscriptions annual, in which case we shall be able to appear\r\n   again early in December.”\r\n\r\nThe accounts referred to in the second paragraph of the above are\r\nexceedingly suggestive reading. They recorded one subscription of twenty\r\nfrancs. The remainder of the subscriptions ranged from two sous to two\r\nfrancs. The total receipts were fr. 57.10. The expenses of printing and\r\nmailing the number were fr. 73.60, and the incidental expenses were fr.\r\n11.55. The deficit for this number was, therefore, fr. 28.05; but, the\r\ndeficit on the two preceding numbers having amounted to fr. 32.80, the\r\nreview at the end of its third number showed a deficit of fr. 60.85.\r\n\r\nVery trifling seems this deficit to those of us who are accustomed to\r\nread the balance sheets of large journals, but very real and very\r\nembarrassing are the difficulties which it presents to the publishers of\r\nan anarchist periodical. The financial statement is followed by this\r\nnotice:—\r\n\r\n   “To cover this deficit and reimburse the _camarades_ who\r\n   advanced us money, we offer for sale at ten sous, postpaid,\r\n   the one hundred and thirty copies of the Preparatory Series\r\n   which we still have left (3 numbers with covers, 18 pages\r\n   each).”\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgment of subscriptions and contributions through the\r\ncolumns of the papers is theoretically for the sake of saving the labour\r\nand expense of correspondence and postage; and, when the names of the\r\ncontributors are given by initials only, as is sometimes done, the\r\ndevice may stand for what it claims to be. But when, as too frequently\r\nhappens, the names are printed in full, it is impossible not to suspect\r\nthe editors of catering to precisely the same sort of vanity as that\r\nwhich lies back of bourgeois subscription lists.\r\n\r\nThese account columns are further utilised by the _camarades_—but here\r\nat least the taint is scarcely a bourgeois one—for the launching of\r\npleasantries (more or less astute) and for the expression of sentiments,\r\nthe affirmation of brotherhood, the declaration of principles, and the\r\nutterance of prophecies or threats.\r\n\r\nIn a recent subscription list of _Le Libertaire_ these signatures\r\nappeared: _Nemesis_, fr. 0.50; _L’Alouette_, 0.50; _Ni Dieu ni Maître_,\r\n0.50; _Un Evadé du Bagne Schneider_, 0.50; _Trois Mètres de Corde pour\r\nle Roussin D——_, 0.50; _Un Va-nu-pied_, 0.25; _Un Coopérateur\r\nCommuniste-anarchiste_, 0.30; _Trois Semeurs à Lille_, 0.25; _Après la\r\nConférence de Sébastien Faure_, 2 fr.; _Trois Coopérateurs_, 0.30; _Un\r\nMiséreux_, 0.10; _Un Garçon de Café Ennemi de la Tyrannie_, 0.30; _Deux\r\nTrimardeurs_, 2 fr.; _Un Camarade Dévoué_, 1 fr.; _A Bas la Lâcheté\r\nHumaine_, 1 fr.; _Vive l’Energie Individuelle!_ 1 fr.; _Trois Copains\r\nRochefortais_, 4 fr.; _Le Breton du Jardin des Plantes_, 0.30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIERRE JOSEPH PROUDHON[15]]\r\n\r\nA recent device for raising funds, which is at the same time an\r\nadditional means of propaganda, is the sale of anarchist pictures. Up to\r\n1886 a portrait of Louise Michel was the only picture published under\r\nanarchist auspices. In that year _La Révolte_ (now _Les Temps\r\nNouveaux_), having become convinced of the proselyting value of\r\npictures, attempted to buy for reproduction such of the plates of the\r\nillustrated weekly _L’Illustration_ as had or could be given a\r\nrevolutionary meaning. This attempt failing, it set about producing a\r\nseries of pictures of its own called _Images de Propagande_, to be sold\r\nat prices ranging from ten to twenty-five sous. These _Images de\r\nPropagande_ are all genuine works of art by artists of renown, and the\r\ncomplete collection is much sought by amateurs. The _Temps Nouveaux_ has\r\nalso turned to the advantage of the propaganda the illustrated postal\r\ncard fever, and has prepared a series of anarchist pictures especially\r\nfor children.\r\n\r\nThe pictorial propaganda has gained even the provinces. The following is\r\nan excerpt from an anarchist periodical:—\r\n\r\n   “The _camarades_ of Roubaix will soon enter into possession of\r\n   their little press. For a long while they have ardently\r\n   desired a press, but some efforts still remain to be made. If\r\n   we make a pecuniary appeal to the _camarades_, it is that we\r\n   may get together more quickly the sum necessary for the\r\n   purchase.... To hasten matters, if possible, a _Roubaisien\r\n   camarade_ has had the idea of photographing on a plaque of\r\n   good size (18 by 24 centimetres) the engraving representing\r\n   the Chicago martyrdom and a drawing with the portraits of\r\n   Emile Henry,[16] Caserio,[17] and Angiolillo on a plaque of 9\r\n   by 12 centimetres. Price, Martyrs of Chicago, fr. 1.40,\r\n   postpaid; Henri, Caserio, Angiolillo, 85 centimes, postpaid.\r\n   Send orders to,” etc.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no greater obstacle to the progress of the written\r\npropaganda than the perpetual petty annoyances that arise from an\r\ninadequacy of funds. It is by no means the only one. The anarchist who\r\nhas already in hand the means to pay for having his journal printed is\r\noften unable to find a printer who will undertake the work. “The\r\n_copains_ of Grenoble,”—the item is from a _trimardeur’s_ report,—“after\r\nhaving done everything in their power to launch their paper, rebuffed by\r\nall the printers (downright refusal, exorbitant charge, etc.), have\r\ndecided to buy a mimeograph and to autograph manifests, which they will\r\nsow broadcast.”\r\n\r\nSupposing his journal printed, however, the anarchist editor is still\r\nfar from the end of his troubles. He has to get it properly distributed;\r\nand in this undertaking, likewise, he encounters numerous difficulties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LITTLE ANARCHISTS]\r\n\r\nIt is so compromising in every way to be known as a reader of an\r\nanarchist publication that few even of the sympathetically inclined,\r\nunless they have a pronounced taste for martyrdom, care to lower\r\nthemselves in the eyes of their postman, their _concièrge_, and their\r\nneighbours, and to run the risk of being black listed in all quarters\r\nby receiving an anarchist paper regularly through the post. Besides,\r\nthey have a perfectly natural reluctance to pay in advance the\r\nsubscription price of three months, six months, or a year, for a paper\r\nthat may not be able to keep alive two months. They prefer to buy the\r\nnumbers at the news-stands as they come out,—a procedure which not only\r\nconsiderably diminishes the publisher’s net returns, but keeps him in a\r\nhighly inconvenient uncertainty with regard to his budget. In some years\r\nthe news-stand sale of the _Temps Nouveaux_, for instance, has been\r\nnine-tenths of the whole circulation.\r\n\r\nThis very news-stand sale is lessened by the indifference or positive\r\nill-will of the newsdealers, who either decline to handle anarchist\r\npapers at all; or, if they do handle them, contrive to keep them well\r\nout of view. Furthermore, the railway and post-office authorities take a\r\nmischievous or malignant delight in delaying the delivery of anarchist\r\nprinted matter when they cannot find pretexts for holding it up\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n   “We receive frequent complaints, which we know are justified\r\n   for the most part,” says _Le Libertaire_, “on account of\r\n   tardiness in the arrival of our paper. We assure our dealers\r\n   and subscribers that the journal is sent out regularly every\r\n   Thursday, barring the weeks when money is lacking.\r\n   Consequently, it is to the malice of the railroads and the\r\n   post-office that the delay must be ascribed.”\r\n\r\nTo counteract these and other hindrances to the sale of their wares,\r\nanarchist editors have to resort to numerous devices. These devices may\r\nbe in the form of stereotyped requests to readers to secure other\r\nreaders, and to force the hands of the dealers, of which the following\r\nare good examples:—\r\n\r\n   “_Friends and Readers_,\r\n\r\n   “If you would be useful to the _Journal du Peuple_, and serve\r\n   the ideas which it defends, buy several copies and distribute\r\n   them to the persons whom you judge capable of buying it later\r\n   for themselves.”\r\n\r\n   “We urge our friends in Paris to keep demanding our paper of\r\n   the newsdealers in order to compel them to handle it. A bit of\r\n   determination on the part of each, and _ça ira_.”\r\n\r\nOften the advertisement appears as a more presuming and exacting appeal\r\nto loyalty, as, for example:—\r\n\r\n   “Our liquidation of the end of the year permits us to spare a\r\n   quantity of back numbers. We beg those of our friends who are\r\n   willing to take upon themselves their distribution, either in\r\n   the meetings or at the doors of the factories, to let us know\r\n   how many copies to send them.”\r\n\r\nAt other times, resort is taken to such original and audacious schemes\r\nas the following:—\r\n\r\n   “JOURNALS FOR ALL\r\n\r\n   “The reactionary press penetrates into the rural districts,\r\n   while many of the _libertaire_ journals are unknown there. We\r\n   remind our readers that the enterprise ‘JOURNALS FOR ALL,’ 17\r\n   rue Cujas, holds itself at their disposition to give them the\r\n   addresses of poor provincials who would be delighted to\r\n   receive their papers once they have been read. It will cost\r\n   them a stamp of two centimes each day and the trouble of\r\n   wrapping and addressing. In thus sending away their papers,\r\n   our readers will be doing a work highly advantageous to the\r\n   propaganda. Write the secretary for fuller particulars.”\r\n\r\n   “Here is a means of circulating our paper which, employed upon\r\n   a certain scale, would be highly efficacious: All the\r\n   _camarades_ who can make the sacrifice of a certain number of\r\n   copies should roll them into a more or less tempting small\r\n   package, wrap them well to protect them, and then throw them\r\n   into the doorways of houses, slip them into the baskets of\r\n   women on their way to or from market, or give them to the\r\n   children in the street to take home to their parents.”\r\n\r\nFinally, the wily stratagems of a determined and not over-scrupulous\r\nsecret police and the special rigour of a body of more or less biased\r\njudges in applying Draconian laws of exception must be reckoned with. In\r\nno department of their work do the former display more cunning or the\r\nlatter more severity. Nevertheless, they have never been able, combined,\r\nto prevail over the intensity of the anarchist proselyting spirit far\r\nenough to prevent for any length of time the spread of the written word.\r\nTrick has been matched by trick and audacity by audacity. The defiance\r\nwith which the authorities are met is well typified by the following\r\nmanifesto:—\r\n\r\n   “READERS AND SUBSCRIBERS OF _L’Insurgé_, TAKE NOTICE!\r\n\r\n   “We announce to our readers that we shall not be able to\r\n   appear this week; but, in spite of all the rascalities of the\r\n   government, we intend to appear in the breach again very soon.\r\n   _Vive l’homme libre dans l’humanité libre! Vive l’Anarchie!_\r\n\r\n   “SANTAVILLE\r\n   “[Managing Editor of _L’Insurgé_].”\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1881 the press law was such that a condemned journal was\r\nforced to change its name, if it wished to reappear; and the tradition\r\nsurvives of an anarchist sheet at Lyons which suffered eighteen\r\nsuccessive condemnations (involving for the managing editors\r\nimprisonment for terms varying from six months to two years), and which,\r\ntherefore, bore successively eighteen different names.\r\n\r\nAfter 1881 until the passage of the special anarchist restrictive acts\r\npopularly known as the _Lois Scélérates_, a journal could pass through\r\nany number of condemnations without losing its identity; the guilt of\r\nthe responsible editor being held as purely personal. It was during this\r\ngolden age of relative liberty that the _Père Peinard_ saw ten of its\r\nmanaging editors condemned within three years—as a cavalry officer\r\nleading a charge may see horses shot out from under him—without having\r\nits advance materially impeded.\r\n\r\n   “Once the condemned editor was out of the way,” says a writer\r\n   familiar with the administration of this curious journal, “it\r\n   was as if no condemnation had intervened. There was somewhere\r\n   on the _trimard_ in France or abroad an anarchist who owed to\r\n   the state two years of Ste. Pélagie and a 3,000-franc\r\n   fine,[18] but the journal was not touched. _Le Père Peinard_\r\n   remained unassailable....\r\n\r\n   “From the number and the gravity of the sentences imposed it\r\n   would seem that the _Père Peinard_ must have experienced great\r\n   difficulty in the recruitment of its editors or that it must\r\n   have paid them enormous salaries. Quite the reverse. The\r\n   fanaticism of the anarchists was such that they vied with each\r\n   other in imploring of Pouget the favour of a chance to be\r\n   condemned. At any given moment several were impatiently\r\n   awaiting their turn. Never did the _Père Peinard_ pay one of\r\n   its editors. Never did it even allow him a free subscription.\r\n   The editor of the _Père Peinard_ was a special type, a\r\n   volunteer of the assize court, who went to the prison as water\r\n   goes to the river, and who pushed his disinterestedness to the\r\n   point of buying his own paper—two sous out of his pocket—every\r\n   Sunday.”\r\n\r\nUnder the present laws it would be more difficult for so saucy and\r\nreckless a sheet as the _Père Peinard_ to keep up its laughter over the\r\ndiscomfiture of the authorities; that is, if it were printed in France.\r\n\r\nTo-day a paper of this sort, to appear here with anything like an\r\napproach to regularity, would have to be printed in some foreign town\r\nthat is tolerant towards anarchists, and smuggled through the mails\r\ninside of other journals or in covers with unsuspicious titles. This\r\npropaganda at long range is too expensive to be carried on in a\r\nwholesale fashion. It has its periods of favour, however, and is never\r\ntotally neglected. Apropos of unsuspicious cover titles, it is on record\r\nthat the journal _L’Internationale_, which used to be printed in the\r\nFrench colony of London, regaled the prying eyes of the French\r\npost-office employees and the police with such more than reputable\r\ninscriptions as these: _Mandement de S. E. le Cardinal Manning_, _Petit\r\nTraité de Géographie_, _Rapport sur la Question du Tunnel Sous-Marin_,\r\n_Contes Traduits de Dickens_, _Lettres d’un Pasteur sur la Sainte\r\nBible_.\r\n\r\nOnce, at least,—more than once, it is probable,—anarchist doctrines\r\nhave been preached in a journal founded and supported by the prefecture\r\nof police,—an ideal arrangement, it would seem, since both parties\r\nthereto find their account therein, the anarchists in having a chance to\r\nsay their say without grubbing for funds, and the police in having large\r\noccasion for self-felicitation over their shrewdness in keeping the\r\nanarchists under strict surveillance.\r\n\r\nThe practical impossibility of carrying on a journal successfully\r\nwithout a permanent and known office, subscription lists, and the\r\nassistance of the newsdealers, has made the anarchist resort to the\r\nsecret issue by unknown presses of placards and hand-bills whenever he\r\nhas anything very special or very incendiary to say,—particularly at\r\nelection time, when he is exceedingly active in preaching abstention\r\nfrom the polls, and during the enrolment and departure of the\r\nconscripts. The police will tear down the placards, of course, but\r\nrarely before they have been read; and they may arrest the distributors\r\nof the fliers, but this does not recall the fliers which have been put\r\nforth. More than this they cannot do, since either there is no printer’s\r\nmark to guide them or, if one appears, it is false or fantastic, such as\r\n“117 _rue de la Liberté_, _ville de la Fraternité_, _Etats-Unis de\r\nl’Humanité_, _Département de l’Egalité_.”\r\n\r\nThe tantalising documents float into the streets quietly and gently like\r\nsnowflakes, before the very eyes of the police, and are irresponsible as\r\nsnowflakes, having nothing more than these about them to indicate their\r\nitinerary or origin.\r\n\r\nHere is an election placard which may serve as a sample:—\r\n\r\n   “A BAS LA CHAMBRE!\r\n\r\n   “People, retake your liberty, your initiative, and keep them.\r\n   The Government is the valet of Capital. Down with the\r\n   Government! Down with the king, Loubet! To the sewer with the\r\n   Senate! To the river with the Chamber! To the dunghill with\r\n   all this ancient social rottenness! Away with the Chamber!\r\n   Away with the Senate! Away with the Presidency! Away with\r\n   Capital!\r\n\r\n   “_Vive la Révolution Sociale! Vive l’Anarchie!_\r\n\r\n   “(Signed) AN ANARCHIST GROUP.”\r\n\r\nIn the view of the larger-minded anarchists—the Reclus, the\r\nKropotkines, the Graves—the betterment of society must be preceded by\r\nthe betterment of the individuals that make up society. Education is the\r\ncorner-stone of the structure their hope has builded. They realise that\r\nthey have undertaken a moral and intellectual labour of long reach,\r\ncalling for infinite energy and patience, for years and perhaps\r\ngenerations of scattered, seemingly bootless initiative, exhortation,\r\nand example. So far as these leaders are concerned, no charge could well\r\nbe falser than the one that is daily being brought against them of\r\nignoring the calendar in all their calculations, juggling with an\r\nabstract social man,—very much as the elder economists juggled with\r\ntheir “economic man,”—and expecting with childlike _naïveté_ to make\r\nhuman nature and the world over in a twinkling.\r\n\r\n   “For the establishment of the anarchist society,” says Jean\r\n   Grave, “it is necessary that each individual taken separately\r\n   be able to govern himself, that he knows how to make his\r\n   autonomy respected while respecting the autonomy of others,\r\n   and that he succeeds in liberating his volition from the\r\n   tyranny of surrounding influences....\r\n\r\n   ... “Now for individuals to dispense with authority, for each\r\n   one to be able to exercise his autonomy without coming into\r\n   conflict with his fellows, it is essential that we all\r\n   acquire a mentality appropriate to this state of things.”\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful anarchist is well aware that, for the production of this\r\nappropriate mentality, his placards, posters, and hand-bills, his\r\npictures and _chansons_, his weeklies, monthlies, and annuals, are\r\nludicrously inadequate and inapt. He is far from despising these\r\nagencies. He recognises their value as popularisers and as ferment; but\r\nhe is struggling towards a propaganda of a deeper, more compelling\r\nnature as rapidly as he is able. He would (like the devout Catholic)\r\nassume complete control of the mental training of his children, taking\r\nthem out of the public schools, which impose respect for his two\r\nbugbears—authority and property—along with other bourgeois\r\ncommonplaces and superstitions, in order to give, in schools of his own,\r\nthe complete, well-rounded education which he calls _l’éducation\r\nintégrale_.\r\n\r\nM. Paul Robin, who made a passably successful experiment with this\r\n_éducation intégrale_ at the Prévost Orphanage, Cempuis,[19] during the\r\nyears 1880 to 1894, has expounded the meaning of the phrase in an\r\narticle which it would be a real pleasure to quote entire. A few\r\nparagraphs will suffice, however, to reveal the loftiness, the\r\nsweetness, and the eminent sanity of his ideas:—\r\n\r\n   “The word _intégrale_, applied to education, includes the\r\n   three epithets, physical, intellectual, and moral, and\r\n   indicates further the continuous relations between these three\r\n   divisions.\r\n\r\n   “_L’éducation intégrale_ is not the forced accumulation of an\r\n   infinite number of notions upon all things: it is the culture,\r\n   the harmonious development, of all the faculties of the human\r\n   being,—health, vigour, beauty, intelligence, goodness....\r\n\r\n   “_L’éducation physique_ embraces muscular and cerebral\r\n   development. It satisfies the need of exercise of all our\r\n   organs, passive as well as active,—a need given the authority\r\n   of law by physiology. To note this development and to learn to\r\n   direct it with prudence, anthropometric observations should\r\n   be made and anthropometric statistics continuously kept.\r\n\r\n   “The exercise of the senses, the calculations necessary in\r\n   sports and in physical exertion of every sort,—races, workshop\r\n   labour, etc.,—have their influence on the intellect, and\r\n   render attractive certain tasks often considered repulsive\r\n   because of the awkward manner in which they have been\r\n   approached.\r\n\r\n   “_L’éducation intellectuelle_ has to do with two totally\r\n   distinct matters,—matters of opinion, variable, debatable, the\r\n   cause of quarrels, antagonisms, rivalries; and matters of\r\n   fact, of observation, of experience, whose solutions are\r\n   identical for all beings. The old teaching occupied itself\r\n   almost entirely with the first matters to the neglect of the\r\n   second. The new teaching, on the contrary, should diminish as\r\n   much as possible the number and prominence of the first in\r\n   favour of the second. In whatever of the first is of necessity\r\n   retained, notably the acquisition of languages, it should\r\n   limit itself to the purely practical side, and reserve the\r\n   study of the complicated, illogical evolution of language for\r\n   a small, selected group of adults who are well grounded in the\r\n   sciences....\r\n\r\n   ... “On the other hand, the study of nature, of industry (by\r\n   its practice in workshops), of the sciences (in laboratories\r\n   and observatories), gives to the brain a harmonious\r\n   development, makes it well balanced, and imparts a great\r\n   justness of judgment. Theoretical study in books should only\r\n   come after the excitation given by real practice, to\r\n   supplement and co-ordinate the elements which the practice has\r\n   furnished. From this concordance in the knowledge and\r\n   appreciation of real facts results inevitably a tendency to\r\n   concord upon all other matters; that is to say, veritable\r\n   social peace....\r\n\r\n   “It should not be forgotten that the _éducation intégrale_,\r\n   _physique_, and _intellectuelle_, must combine knowledge and\r\n   art, the knowing and the doing.\r\n\r\n   “A genuine _intégral_ is at once theorician and practician. He\r\n   unites the two qualities systematically separated by the\r\n   official routine, which maintains, on the one side, primary\r\n   and professional instruction, and, on the other, secondary\r\n   and higher instruction. His is the brain that directs and the\r\n   hand that executes. He is at one and the same time artisan and\r\n   savant.\r\n\r\n   “There is no need of detailing at length a programme of moral\r\n   education. Morality, like reason, is a resultant: it depends\r\n   on the ensemble. The part of teaching in it is slight. The\r\n   child assimilates in the measure of his intellectual\r\n   development ideas of social reciprocity and of goodness; but\r\n   moral education is especially a work of influence, the\r\n   consequence of a normal existence in a normal environment. The\r\n   physiological régime and the general direction given to the\r\n   thoughts by the teaching as a whole are its principal\r\n   elements.\r\n\r\n   “Great care should be taken to exclude false, demoralising\r\n   ideas, narrowing prejudices, dismaying impressions, everything\r\n   that can throw the imagination out of the true into trouble\r\n   and disorder, morbid suggestions and excitation to vanity; to\r\n   suppress occasions of rivalry and jealousy; to assure the\r\n   continual view of calm, ordered, and natural things; to\r\n   organise a simple, occupied, animated, varied life, divided\r\n   between play and work. The progressive usage of liberty and of\r\n   responsibility should be developed, preaching should be done\r\n   mainly by example, and, above all, an effort should be put\r\n   forth to make happiness prevail....\r\n\r\n   “As to the inferior, backward, degenerate children,—sad\r\n   consequences of a succession of hereditary blights, aggravated\r\n   by deplorable, haphazard births and a heels-over-head\r\n   education,—these are moral invalids, for whom it is necessary\r\n   to care with compassion and of whom almost nothing should be\r\n   demanded. It is necessary, doubtless, to take, with all\r\n   possible humanity, precautions to prevent their injuring or\r\n   contaminating the others; but one must guard one’s self well\r\n   against believing that he has the right to punish them because\r\n   of a nature for which they are not responsible.”\r\n\r\nApart from this one notable experiment, little or nothing has as yet\r\nbeen done in Paris or elsewhere in France towards the systematic\r\napplication of _l’éducation intégrale_. The anarchist school, rather\r\npretentiously called a college (_le Collège Libertaire_), opened in 1901\r\non the edge of the university quarter of Paris, has only succeeded so\r\nfar in establishing a few evening courses for adults, the lack of funds\r\nthat handicaps every anarchistic enterprise being supplemented in this\r\ncase by the difficulty of securing proper teachers, because of the\r\ndanger, amounting almost to a certainty, of loss of position, if\r\nregularly employed teachers lend themselves to a revolutionary\r\nenterprise. The recent foundation by the anarchists of a child’s paper,\r\n_Jean-Pierre_, is an interesting experiment along this educational line.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the _éducation intégrale_ to win its way, the more\r\nintellectual anarchists are making a strong effort to increase the study\r\nof the masters and of the forerunners and disciples of the masters. To\r\nthis end the principal anarchist organs, especially the _Temps\r\nNouveaux_, keep on sale and persistently recommend the reading of the\r\nworks of the principal dead and living authors, native and foreign, who\r\nhave expounded anarchy or who tend—or are claimed to tend—towards\r\nanarchy: Proudhon, Stirner, and Bakounine; Darwin, Büchner, Herzen,\r\nGodwin, and Herbert Spencer; Ibsen, Björnson, Tolstoy, Leopardi, and\r\nNietzsche; Louise Michel, Elisée Reclus, Jean Grave, and Kropotkine; the\r\nanti-militarists Richet, Dubois-Dessaule, Vallier, and Urbain Gohier;\r\nthe sociologists Charles-Albert and Jules Huret; the philosophers Guy\r\nand Letourneau; Lefèvre, the student of comparative religions; Guyau,\r\nthe moralist; the novelists and dramatists Marsolleau, Darien, Descaves,\r\nChèze, Raganasse, Lami, Lumet, and Ajalbert; the Italian Malato, the\r\nGerman Eltzbacher, the Hollander Nieuwenhuis, the American Tucker, and\r\nthe Spaniard Tarrida del Marmol.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, selected portions from nearly all these writers and from\r\nHamon, Saurin, Malatesta, Tcherkesoff, Janvion, Chaughi, Darnaud,\r\nSébastien Faure, Lavroff, Paul Delasalle, and Cafiero, are published, as\r\nbrochures in editions running as high as sixty thousand and at prices\r\nranging from one sou to fifteen sous (usually two sous) each, so that\r\nfor a total outlay of two or three francs those who have not the means\r\nto buy or the application to read the fr. 3.50 volumes may familiarise\r\nthemselves with anarchist thought in all its most important bearings.\r\nThe real nature of the contents of some of the brochures is disguised by\r\nthe use of innocuous titles. Thus a certain appeal to desertion from the\r\narmy bears on its cover this inscription: “_Pour la Défense des Intérêts\r\nTypographiques_.”\r\n\r\nUnlike the placards, posters, and hand-bills, most of the brochures are\r\nrestrained in tone. Now and then, however, an anonymous brochure is\r\nissued from nobody knows what printing establishment that startles the\r\npublic and puts the policy on its mettle. The most famous of these\r\n(worth its weight in gold now to bibliophiles for its rarity) is the\r\n_Indicateur Anarchiste: Manuel du Parfait Dynamiteur_ (40 pages,\r\npublished 1887).\r\n\r\nThe _Indicateur Anarchiste_ was practically a reprint of a\r\nseries of articles that had appeared in the London journal,\r\n_L’Internationale_,[20] under the rubric “_Un Cours de Chimie\r\nPratique_,” which articles were in their turn practically a reprint of a\r\nseries that appeared in _La Lutte_ of Lyons under the rubric “_Produits\r\nAnti-Bourgeois_.” They included minute directions for the fabrication\r\nand use of several explosives and of Greek fire, the common and\r\nscientific names and the prices of their ingredients, and a detailed\r\ndescription of the tools and vessels best adapted to the various\r\nnecessary processes. The announcement of the original series in _La\r\nLutte_ was as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n   “PRODUITS ANTI-BOURGEOIS\r\n\r\n   “Under this heading we shall put before our friends the\r\n   inflammable and explosive materials which are the best known,\r\n   the easiest to handle and prepare,—in a word, the most useful.\r\n   These preparations are not classical. If we point them out to\r\n   the _camarades_ notwithstanding, it is because we have\r\n   discovered that they are superior to others and offer less\r\n   danger.\r\n\r\n   “We shall mention only the most indispensable products, and\r\n   yet these are unknown to many of the _camarades_. In the\r\n   approaching conflict each one must be a bit of a chemist. This\r\n   is why it is high time to take matters into our own hands, and\r\n   demonstrate to the bourgeois that what we want we want in\r\n   earnest.”\r\n\r\nThe excitement aroused by the publication and general circulation of\r\nthis ominous brochure proved to be well-nigh gratuitous. Experience has\r\ndemonstrated that in France, where the most scholarly anarchists are\r\nlittle inclined to participate in the _propagande par le fait_,[21] the\r\nmajority of dynamiters are forced (like Salvat in Zola’s _Paris_), to\r\nsteal their explosives. They are not capable of putting the precepts of\r\nthis so-called popular manual, rudimentary as they appear, into\r\npractice; the required manipulations, even when reduced to their\r\nsimplest terms, being too dangerous and delicate for any but laboratory\r\ntrained hands to execute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Revolutionary Poster]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   “_The battles of the heroes of the future will be\r\n   individualistic, not against the armed force of governments\r\n   but against the apathetic routine and inertia of the human\r\n   masses._”—EDWARD CARPENTER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PROPAGANDA OF ANARCHY BY EXAMPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_As a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not\r\n   his mouth._”\r\n\r\n   ISAIAH.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Resist not evil.”\r\n   “Swear not at all.”\r\n   “Judge not that ye be not judged.”\r\n   “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell what thou hast and give\r\n      to the poor.”\r\n   “Ye shall know them by their fruits._”—JESUS CHRIST.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_And when He was accused of the chief priests and elders, He\r\n   answered nothing._”—SAINT MATTHEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_The most dangerous foe to truth and freedom among us is the\r\n   solid majority....

Human laws are only good and valid in\r\n   so far as they conform to, explain, and apply the law of God.\r\n   They are evil whensoever they contrast with or oppose it; and\r\n   it is then not only your right, but your duty, to disobey and\r\n   abolish them._”—MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_To profit by all the circumstances of life, to make one’s\r\n   acts accord with one’s ideas, is to carry on a_ propagande\r\n   par le fait _of a slow but continuous action which must\r\n   produce its results._”—JEAN GRAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen that great and original child of nature, Thoreau, the Hermit of\r\nWalden, protested against the collection of taxes in Concord town, he\r\nlittle suspected, probably, that he was prefiguring a revolutionary\r\nmovement which, before the century was over, was to alarm the sleek and\r\nthe smug of the Old World and the New; and yet, whether Thoreau realised\r\nit or not, his attitude was the anarchistic attitude and his act an act\r\nof the _propagande par l’exemple_.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the American anti-slavery champion, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, was also essentially anarchistic.\r\n\r\n   “Garrison,” says Tolstoy, “as a man enlightened by\r\n   Christianity, starting out with a practical aim,—the struggle\r\n   against slavery,—understood very soon that the cause of\r\n   slavery was not a casual, temporary seizure of several\r\n   millions of negroes by the Southerners, but an old and\r\n   universal anti-Christian recognition of the right of violence\r\n   of some people over others. The means towards the recognition\r\n   of this right was always the evil, which people considered\r\n   possible to outroot or to lessen by rude force; that is, again\r\n   by evil. And, realising this, Garrison pointed out against\r\n   slavery, not the sufferings of the slaves, not the cruelty of\r\n   the slave-owners, not the equal rights of citizens, but the\r\n   eternal Christian law of non-resistance. Garrison understood\r\n   that which the most forward champions against slavery failed\r\n   to understand,—that the sole irresistible means against\r\n   slavery was the denial of the right of one man over the\r\n   liberty of another under any circumstances whatever.\r\n\r\n   “The Abolitionists attempted to prove that slavery was\r\n   illegal, unprofitable, cruel, degrading, and so forth; but the\r\n   pro-slavery champions, in their turn, proved the untimeliness,\r\n   the danger, and the harmful consequences which would arise\r\n   from the abolition of slavery. And neither could convince the\r\n   other. But Garrison, understanding that the slavery of the\r\n   negroes was but a private case of general violence, put forth\r\n   the general principle with which it was impossible to\r\n   disagree,—that no one, under any pretext, has the right of\r\n   ruling; that is, of using force over his equals. Garrison did\r\n   not insist so much on the right of slaves to be free as he\r\n   denied the right of any man whatever, or of any company of\r\n   men, to compel another man to do anything by force. For the\r\n   battle with slavery he put forth the principle of the battle\r\n   with all the evil of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the citizens of the little French commune of Counozouls\r\nto pay their taxes between 1902 and 1904 because they were deprived of\r\ntheir hereditary right to supply themselves with wood from an adjacent\r\nforest, and the “passive resistance” of the nonconformists in England to\r\nthe enforcement of the new education act, and of the French Catholics to\r\nthe expulsion of the monastic orders, are recent instances of probably\r\nunconscious _propagande par l’exemple_.\r\n\r\nTolstoy has made a clear and full statement of the purport of the\r\n_propagande par l’exemple_.\r\n\r\n   “Taxes,” he says, “were never instituted by common consent,\r\n   ... but are taken by those who have the power of taking\r\n   them.... A man should not voluntarily pay taxes to governments\r\n   either directly or indirectly; nor should he accept money\r\n   collected by taxes either as salary or as pension or as a\r\n   reward; nor should he make use of governmental institutions\r\n   supported by taxes, since they are collected by violence from\r\n   the people.”\r\n\r\nHe holds military service in similar abhorrence:—\r\n\r\n   “Every honest man ought to understand that the payment of\r\n   taxes which are employed to maintain and arm soldiers, and,\r\n   still more, serving in the army, are not indifferent acts, but\r\n   wicked and shameful acts, since he who commits them not only\r\n   permits assassination, but participates in it.”\r\n\r\nIn an apologue, “Too Dear,” he demonstrates that law courts, prisons,\r\nand armies are alike useless to a sound civilisation. In short, Tolstoy\r\nrenounces the state, and prays for its extinction, root and branch:—\r\n\r\n   “The doctrine of humility, pardon, and love, is incompatible\r\n   with the state, with its arrogance, its deeds of violence, its\r\n   executions, its wars. Real Christianity not only excludes the\r\n   possibility of acknowledging the state, but also destroys its\r\n   foundation.... The sum of all the evil possible to the people,\r\n   if left to themselves, could not equal the sum of the evil\r\n   actually accomplished by the tyranny of church and state.”\r\n\r\nWhat could a militant anarchist say more? And there is no limit to the\r\nextent to which these anarchistic utterances of Tolstoy might be\r\nmultiplied.\r\n\r\nMost French anarchists believe that the privileged will never surrender\r\ntheir privileges without a desperate resistance. Only a little handful\r\nof them are Tolstoyans in maintaining that simple non-resistance\r\nfaithfully adhered to will alone suffice to regenerate the world. But\r\nthey nearly all hold that cumulative non-resistance is, under certain\r\nconditions, the most effective resistance (”_faire le vide autour des\r\ninstitutions sociales est le meilleur moyen de les démolir_”); and a\r\nmajority of them, probably,—certainly a majority of their more\r\nintellectual element,—esteem it by far the most important propaganda\r\nfor the present hour.\r\n\r\nThe average French anarchist is forced to recognise at the outset the\r\nunpalatable truth that a good half of his customary doings are based on\r\nthe government and property he opposes. He rejects the theory of money,\r\nbut he must buy and sell. He abhors the state, but serves it, and uses\r\nits tax-supported institutions; and he is constantly finding himself in\r\nsituations where he must do violence to his inmost convictions, or get\r\nout of life altogether by the portals of suicide or want. There are some\r\nunorthodox doings, however, which can be avoided without incurring a\r\nmartyrdom out of all decent proportion to the seriousness of the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n   “If the force of power crushes you to-day, if, in spite of\r\n   everything, authority fetters you in your evolution, there is\r\n   always a certain margin for resistance. Fill this margin\r\n   without being afraid of overstepping it,” advises one of the\r\n   moderate advocates of the _propagande par l’exemple_.\r\n\r\nThe two forms of non-resistance oftenest enjoined by Tolstoy (namely,\r\nnon-payment of taxes and refusal to serve in the army) are so disastrous\r\nin their consequences—as Tolstoy himself would have seen, had he not\r\nbeen born into a high estate and had he not attained a ripe age and an\r\nassured position before his revolutionary ideas completely matured—that\r\nthey can hardly be said to come within this margin. And they are\r\ninculcated in France less with a view to inciting isolated individuals\r\nto put them into practice immediately than in the hope that a day may\r\narrive when they will be suddenly put into practice simultaneously by so\r\nlarge a number of persons that coercion will be out of the question.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, refusal to handle money, to pay interest, to pay rent, to\r\ntake oath, to testify in court, and to do jury duty, call down such\r\nspeedy retribution that these, too, must be interpreted as lying in the\r\ngenerality of cases outside the margin mentioned above.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, protest against parliamentarianism by abstention from\r\nvoting (_la propagande abstentionniste_) is a thoroughly feasible kind\r\nof non-resistance, and is practised almost universally by the anarchists\r\nof France.\r\n\r\n   “If we seek,” says Jean Grave, “to _faire le vide_ around the\r\n   political machine, it is to the end of not forfeiting our\r\n   right to act by and for ourselves. It is to preserve our\r\n   liberty of action that we reject every compromise with the\r\n   actual political order of things. It is to habituate ourselves\r\n   to this liberty which is the _summum_ of our aspirations that\r\n   we attempt to exercise it in our struggle against the present\r\n   social state. To the individuals whom they wish to enlist\r\n   under their banner, the advocates of authority say, ‘Send us\r\n   to the Chamber to make laws in your favour!’\r\n\r\n   “To those whom they wish to make think, the anarchists, after\r\n   having exposed the facts, explain that they have no favours to\r\n   expect from anybody; and that, when a thing seems to them bad,\r\n   the best way to destroy it is to ‘_faire le vide_’ about it;\r\n   ... that they never await from the good pleasure of their\r\n   masters the authorisation to conform their acts to their\r\n   thoughts; and that they commission nobody to legislate as to\r\n   what they should do.”\r\n\r\nAbstention from marriage (which, as ordinarily practised, the anarchist\r\nconsiders legalised prostitution, and the theoretical indissolubility of\r\nwhich he regards as nothing short of blasphemy) is another thoroughly\r\nfeasible kind of non-resistance. And it is rare to find an anarchist,\r\nwhose marital status was not fixed before he gave in his adherence to\r\nanarchism, who deigns to consult the pleasure or implore the blessing of\r\nany authority whatsoever in a matter which, to his thinking, concerns no\r\none but himself and the person of his choice.[22]\r\n\r\nMalthusianism, also,—in spite of a reverence for the procreative\r\ninstinct, on the part of anarchists, which Zola’s _Fécondité_ does not\r\nsurpass,—is in high favour in anarchistic circles. The motives for the\r\nanarchist’s refusal to bring offspring into the world are set forth in\r\nOctave Mirbeau’s ejaculation of disgust called out by a project of law\r\nfor checking depopulation introduced by one M. Piot into the Senate:—\r\n\r\n   “I dispute that depopulation is an evil. In a social state\r\n   like ours, in a social state which fosters preciously,\r\n   scientifically, in special cultures, poverty and its\r\n   derivative, crime; in a social state which, in spite of new\r\n   investigations and in spite of new philosophies, relies solely\r\n   on the prehistoric forces,—murder and massacre,—what matters\r\n   to the people—the only class, for that matter, which still\r\n   produces children—this much-discussed question of\r\n   depopulation? If the people were clairvoyant, logical with\r\n   their wretchedness and their servitude, they would desire, not\r\n   the cessation of depopulation, but its redoubling. We are\r\n   constantly being told that depopulation is the gravest danger\r\n   which threatens the future of the country. In what, pray, dear\r\n   Monsieur Piot, and you, also, excellent legislators, who lull\r\n   us ceaselessly with your twaddle? In this, you say, that there\r\n   will come inevitably a time when we shall no more have enough\r\n   men to send out to be killed in the Soudan, in Madagascar, in\r\n   China, in the _bagnes_, and in the barracks. You are dreaming\r\n   of repeopling now, then, only for the sake of depeopling later\r\n   on? Ah, no, thank you. If we must die, we like better to die\r\n   at once and by a death of our own choosing.”\r\n\r\nBesides discountenancing elections and marriage, the zealous\r\npropagandist _par l’exemple_ flouts “those whose sole power lies in the\r\nobedience of cringers”; defies “those whose character he despises”;\r\nrefuses to go to law or to accept interest for loans; abstains from the\r\nluxuries which the bourgeois deems indispensable; protests against\r\ninsolence on the part of government functionaries, brutality,\r\nhigh-handed invasion of domiciles, and insults to women on the part of\r\nthe police, cruelty on the part of landlords, and bulldozing on the part\r\nof foremen and employers. He violates deliberately the deep-seated\r\nsocial usages which, equally with the political, judicial, and economic\r\nusages, twist and warp existence; and strives to keep himself in his\r\nlabour, his friendships, and his domestic relations “saturated with\r\naversion for the bourgeois, and for whatever in existence savours of\r\ncapitalism and the _bourgeoisie_, and with a sentiment of solidarity\r\ntowards all who are struggling for sincere living.”\r\n\r\n   “There is a view [of culture],” says Matthew Arnold in his\r\n   immortal essay _Sweetness and Light_, “in which all the love\r\n   of our neighbour, the impulses towards action, help, and\r\n   beneficence, the desire for removing human error, clearing\r\n   human confusion, and diminishing human misery, the noble\r\n   aspiration to leave the world better and happier than we found\r\n   it,—motives eminently such as are called social,—come in as\r\n   part of the grounds of culture, and the main and pre-eminent\r\n   part. Culture is, then, properly described, not as having its\r\n   origin in curiosity, but as having its origin in the love of\r\n   perfection: it is _a study of perfection_. It moves by the\r\n   force not merely or primarily of the scientific passion for\r\n   pure knowledge, but also of the moral and social passion for\r\n   doing good.”\r\n\r\nSomething of the same noble and refined philosophy underlies this\r\ninsistence, by the greater anarchist teachers, on the proselyting value\r\nof truth of intercourse and of downright living and on the consequent\r\nnecessity of the training and purifying of the individual as the surest\r\nmeans of changing a social _milieu_. In the individual refusal to live\r\nthe “conventional lies” which Max Nordau (who has long trembled on the\r\nverge of anarchism) anathematised is a real disintegrating force. “We\r\nmust begin with ourselves,” says Jean Grave, “in our efforts at\r\ntransformation.” And it is sure that the saintliness of Louise Michel,\r\nthe fine simplicity and modesty of Elisée Reclus, the voluntary poverty\r\nof the gentle Jean Grave, and the unobtrusive virtues of their obscure\r\ndisciples are factors of tremendous importance to the anarchist\r\nmovement. Dialectics are powerless before the blameless living of such\r\nreal apostles of “sweetness and light.” They may not have the whole\r\ntruth,—they would be the last to claim that they have,—but there must\r\nbe some shred of truth in a belief that is thus witnessed by beautiful\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn pinning so much of their faith to the gradual modification of daily\r\nhabits of thinking and acting, these anarchists reveal themselves no\r\nmean psychologists and no ordinary students of human nature; and it is\r\nregarding this relatively prosaic _propagande par l’exemple_ that the\r\nchoicest anarchist spirits have spoken their most sagacious and most\r\nwinning words.\r\n\r\nThus, the late Pierre Lavroff wrote: “There exists another form of\r\npropaganda accessible to all temperaments, provided the conviction be\r\nsincere; and many times this form, though wanting the _éclat_ which\r\naccompanies the burning word or the heroic act, proves to be the most\r\nefficacious in the life of every day.\r\n\r\n   ... “The conditions of the actual social régime oppose\r\n   themselves at every instant to a life in conformity with\r\n   conviction more than the juridical conditions retard the\r\n   extension of advanced ideas and more than the police\r\n   surveillance prevents the revolutionary agitation.\r\n\r\n   “It has often been remarked that the most considerable\r\n   transformations in the ideas of society have occurred, not\r\n   because the arguments which were advanced against existing\r\n   forms and beliefs had acquired more force, but in consequence\r\n   of an insensible modification in mental habits. During entire\r\n   centuries the same arguments were repeated; but the habits of\r\n   thought acted as a cuirass, and repulsed for a long time all\r\n   the attacks made against error. Then, at a given moment, this\r\n   cuirass yielded, all at once, without any apparent cause.\r\n   Religious doubt, political liberalism, the propaganda of\r\n   socialism, are more or less prominent examples. The heroic\r\n   acts which strike the imagination merely prepare a soil which\r\n   befits these changes. The great majority lets itself—and will\r\n   a long time yet let itself—be guided by habits. Arguments make\r\n   no great impression upon it. It modifies its customs by\r\n   imitation alone. In the case of heroic acts this imitation\r\n   extends only to individuals exceptionally placed. Its\r\n   veritable domain is the daily living. Every new doctrine which\r\n   embraces practical moral elements must provide a series of\r\n   models which may be imitated, not by an exceptional hero, but\r\n   by an ordinary man. The numerous examples incorporate the new\r\n   doctrine into the daily life. They are, broadly speaking, the\r\n   most efficacious propagandists of new ideas. Truth realising\r\n   itself in living is much more accessible than truth in a state\r\n   of thought. The ideas which an individual propagates act upon\r\n   a small number, upon the best prepared. A way of life is less\r\n   conspicuous, but exercises a more intense action on the\r\n   masses. The propaganda carried on by the daily example is the\r\n   most potent auxiliary of the spoken word. It surpasses often\r\n   in influence the most energetic agitation directed against an\r\n   existing evil....\r\n\r\n   “For the majority of men the _propagande par l’exemple_ is the\r\n   only form which makes tangible the spoken propaganda. It alone\r\n   changes the habits of thinking and living. It produces, in\r\n   fact, a modification of the psychic dispositions of society;\r\n   and it opens the way for society to be influenced by the\r\n   energetic acts of exceptional individuals, for whom it\r\n   prepares a receptive soil.”\r\n\r\nBefore words of such keen observation and high moral and philosophic\r\nimport from men who have not forgotten how to think because they seem\r\nsometimes to dream, only an attitude of reverence is possible; and the\r\nadmission is forced that some of these anarchists are not so very\r\nflighty, after all, and that some of them are “not so bent on acting and\r\ninstituting, even with the great aim of diminishing human error and\r\nmisery ever before their thoughts, but that they can remember that\r\nacting and instituting are of little use, unless they know how and what\r\nthey ought to act and institute.”\r\n\r\nAnother manifestation of the _propagande par l’exemple_ has been the\r\ncreation, in France and abroad, of anarchist experiment stations where\r\nan effort has been made to realise on a small scale, by isolation from\r\nthe world at large, the social arrangements which are, on a large scale,\r\nthe anarchist dream.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural colony founded in Algeria by M. Regnier, one of the\r\nsons-in-law of Elisée Reclus, seems to have been the only really\r\nsuccessful venture in this line; and I am not sure whether even this is\r\nstill in existence.\r\n\r\nThe other anarchist colonies set up abroad—notably _La Colonie\r\nCecilia_, which was one of the by-products of the emigration from France\r\nto South America—have all come to more or less speedy grief.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are not far to seek. The colonists were totally ignorant of\r\nthe regions to which they emigrated. They looked to find easier living\r\nand well-nigh perfect liberty, and were amazed and disillusionised when\r\nthey discovered that conditions were not so very different under these\r\nnew civilisations from what they were under the old.\r\n\r\nThey were ignorant of each other. No selection having been exercised in\r\nforming the groups, the orthodox were overshadowed by the heterodox and\r\nby adventurers who were not anarchists at all; and many even of the\r\northodox were too timorous or too weary to resume, under new skies, the\r\nstruggle which they fancied, in quitting Europe, they had left behind\r\nforever. Misunderstandings, disputes, and even spoliation were the\r\nnatural result.\r\n\r\nThey were farther handicapped by a lack of preliminary funds for their\r\ninstallations, by the absence of the appliances of civilisation to which\r\nthey were accustomed, and by unfamiliarity with the agriculture or other\r\nwork they had to do.\r\n\r\nBut the primary reason—the reason which may indeed be said to include\r\nall the other reasons—for the failure of the French anarchist colonies\r\nin foreign lands is that the transition the colonists were called upon\r\nto make was far too abrupt. As Jean Grave has pointed out in this\r\nconnection, “People cannot pass thus brusquely from a society where\r\nfighting and egoism are obligatory on every being to a society where the\r\nrelations between individuals are those of love, of sympathy, of\r\nbenevolence, of solidarity, where you take no heed of the faults of\r\nthose who surround you, ignoring the follies of your neighbours while\r\nthey ignore yours. The existing social state has in no way prepared us\r\nfor solidarity and benevolence.”\r\n\r\nThe French attempts to found anarchist colonies at home have fared\r\nlittle, if any, better than the attempts to found them abroad.\r\n\r\nA communistic workshop, opened in Paris in 1885 by a number of\r\nanarchistic tailors whom a strike had left without employment, was\r\nclosed at the end of a year; but whether by reason of internal\r\ndisagreements or by reason of the intrigues of interested employers it\r\nis not easy, from the evidence, to determine. The product was divided\r\nequally among all the members of the association,—the unskilled, the\r\nsick, the aged, and the impotent included.\r\n\r\nThe anarchist _Commune de Montreuil_ (said to be the original of the\r\n_phalanstère_ of Descaves’ and Donnay’s highly successful play, _La\r\nClairière_) was established in 1892 at Montreuil-sous-Bois, a suburb of\r\nParis. A workshop was rented in which the members spent all the time\r\nthey could spare from their regular employments in working for the\r\nbenefit of those who might be in need, and Saturday lectures were given.\r\nThe plans involved, further, hiring a piece of ground to be cultivated\r\nfor a similar purpose in a similar fashion, a gradual cessation of\r\nworking for employers as occasion permitted and results warranted, a\r\nschool for children, and a library for adults. These plans were\r\nfrustrated, not by the petty rivalries of the women (as in the\r\nDescaves-Donnay play), but by the dissolution of the _Commune_ by the\r\ngovernment as a part of the wholesale anarchist repressions of 1893-94.\r\nSome of the original members of the _Commune de Montreuil_ have since\r\nbanded themselves together for an exchange of services with the idea of\r\nhabituating themselves to make and utilise products “without commercial\r\nexchange, representative value, or appraisal”; but the exchangers remain\r\nin their respective homes.\r\n\r\nAt Angers, in the Maine-et-Loire, a department remote from Paris, a\r\nnumber of anarchist workingmen pledged themselves some time since to\r\ndivide their wages at the end of each week “in order to equalise the\r\nconditions of existence.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to draw any conclusion whatsoever from experiments that\r\nare so partial as these and that have been conducted under such\r\nunfavourable conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the two great modern industrial reform movements—trade-unionism and\r\nco-operation—the anarchist finds other fields for the _propagande par\r\nl’exemple_.\r\n\r\nHe is bound to look askance at trade-unions, and, if a purist, to hold\r\nhimself aloof from them, because by the very fact of trying to raise\r\nwages they recognise the legitimacy of the wage system, and because they\r\noften resort to politics, and implore the intervention of parliament to\r\ngain their ends.\r\n\r\n   “The unions are wheels in the capitalistic machine because\r\n   they are placed—if only temporarily—under the conditions of\r\n   the capitalistic system,” says one. “To accept discussion with\r\n   one’s exploiters is to confess their right to exploitation,”\r\n   says another. “The _raison d’être_ of the union is to\r\n   negotiate with the employers, to quibble over the greater or\r\n   less degree of exploitation; while an anarchist should aim\r\n   only at the destruction of this exploitation,” says still\r\n   another.\r\n\r\nRegarding the efficiency of trade-unions as a means of permanently\r\nbettering the conditions of the working classes, to say nothing of\r\ninsuring their emancipation, the anarchist has no illusions. On the\r\ncontrary, he does them scanter justice than even the capitalist, who,\r\nhowever he may antagonise them, at least pays them the sincere\r\ncompliment of fearing them. The anarchist has not a particle of faith in\r\ntrade-unionism as such. He is more orthodox than the most orthodox of\r\neconomists as to the iron law of wages (_la loi d’airain des salaires_),\r\nthe inexorableness of the operation of supply and demand, and the\r\nimpotence of strikes. He maintains stoutly that a so-called trade-union\r\nvictory can, in the nature of the case, be only the semblance of a\r\nvictory, since gains cannot be defended, since an increase in wages\r\ncannot be maintained, against an unfavourable market, and since, even if\r\nit could be maintained, it would be counterbalanced in the long run by\r\nthe increased cost of living consequent thereon. Whoever would oppose\r\nthe trade-union theory and practice will find in the anarchist writings\r\nand speeches the completest possible arsenal of weapons ready forged to\r\nhis hand. No apologist for things as they are can have exposed more\r\nrelentlessly than he the financial foolishness of fighting millions of\r\ndollars with hundreds of dollars, and of pitting the danger of actual\r\nstarvation against the relatively insignificant danger of decreased\r\nprofits,—of combating strength with weakness, in a word, on the\r\nformer’s chosen ground.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the anarchist recognises that the trade-union is a natural\r\ngrouping of the proletariat; that it was the first important grouping to\r\nacknowledge, by acts, the irrepressible conflict between capital and\r\nlabour, the first to boldly lift and wave the standard of industrial\r\nrevolt, the first to shift the attempt at enfranchisement from the\r\npolitical to the economic ground, and the first to appreciate the\r\nadvantages of internationalism; that it is the best considerable example\r\nthus far of solidarity in action, the most favourable soil for\r\nanarchistic good seed—particularly the good seed of the _propagande par\r\nl’exemple_—within present reach, the most favourable ground for\r\ndisputing the future with the socialists, and an excellent weapon of\r\noffence and defence. And he approves of strikes, with all their\r\ndemonstrable financial futility, because they keep to the fore the idea\r\nof revolt, and because—a sort of left-handed reason—every unsuccessful\r\nstrike is an argument in his favour, inasmuch as it shows the emptiness\r\nof partial measures that do not reach the cause.\r\n\r\nBesides, he discerns a trend his way in the growing trade-union advocacy\r\nof the “universal strike” (_grève universelle_ or _grève générale_)\r\nwhich he regards as but another name for the revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the memorable _grève des terrassiers_,[23] Gustave\r\nGeffroy contributed to _Le Journal_ a sketch entitled “_Tableau de\r\nGrève_,” which is at once a vivid pen-picture and a prophecy:—\r\n\r\n   “We could easily have believed ourselves, these latter days,\r\n   borne backward to the days of the siege of Paris or the weeks\r\n   which followed the time of the Commune, in perceiving above\r\n   the pedestrians the silhouettes of cavaliers on patrol and the\r\n   hands of soldiers in campaign accoutrements in the public\r\n   squares and along the banks of the Seine.... When the\r\n   redoubtable question of labour and of _misère_ is the order of\r\n   the day, it is anguish with silence which reigns in the street\r\n   where pass the soldiers under arms.\r\n\r\n   “It has been so everywhere this week. About the stacks of\r\n   arms, along the route of the cavaliers, not a cry has escaped,\r\n   as if each one, by some tacit understanding, knew that destiny\r\n   must not be tempted nor risks run. The public regarded without\r\n   uttering a word, gazed fixedly at these sons of the soil and\r\n   of the faubourg, wearing uniforms and equipped with provisions\r\n   and cartridges as if they were entering on a campaign in this\r\n   peaceful city. Where was the enemy? These strikers, slowly\r\n   promenading, listlessly dangling their arms,—they who set\r\n   forth habitually to work, and who return from work with a\r\n   rapid, cadenced step,—and quite stupefied at having become\r\n   idle strollers; adversaries little fierce, without arms,\r\n   without their tools even, having in their favour only their\r\n   patience, their passivity, their hope, and especially their\r\n   assurance that sooner or later they will conquer, when all\r\n   their fellows shall will it like them.\r\n\r\n   “It is this fatality of the victory of numbers which is the\r\n   enemy; it is against this that the regiments and the squadrons\r\n   have been sent out, against this that to-morrow they would\r\n   have trundled out the artillery. All this parade of force\r\n   would have been made this time, could have been made, in fact,\r\n   only in pure loss.... And so it will be—we can now affirm\r\n   it—on that future day when the _grève générale_ shall be\r\n   interpreted in this fashion, when there shall be everywhere\r\n   only dismaying calm, the tragic refusal to work, when the\r\n   soldiers called out to guarantee order shall find only order\r\n   everywhere,—placid visages and folded arms. Military display\r\n   will be useless on that day. The great social change will have\r\n   come by the fact of that new sort of revolution which a\r\n   reactionary journalist designated very justly, the other day,\r\n   by the name of the passive revolution....\r\n\r\n   ... “Ah! the good time when the people offered itself freely\r\n   as a target on a pile of paving-stones in a narrow street!\r\n\r\n   “This good time is no more. The great boulevards, the broad\r\n   avenues, the power of the artillery which can sweep everything\r\n   from afar without the insurgents seeing anything but the quick\r\n   flame, the sounding light, the cloud of smoke, were already\r\n   there to assure the end of the ancient street war. It was not\r\n   enough. The revolutionary tactics also have changed, in\r\n   proportion as the revolutionary party has extended, has gained\r\n   in force, and has become more conscious of its destinies....\r\n\r\n   “Seek not elsewhere than in a profound transformation of the\r\n   human mind the cause of the tranquillity of a strike in which\r\n   we behold the placid confrontation of the workingman and the\r\n   soldier. For all observers endowed with reason and\r\n   _sang-froid_, to whatever party they belong, the spectacle is\r\n   that of the toiling mass reconnoitring the ground and testing\r\n   its strength. Nothing less than a pacific and irresistible\r\n   transformation is announced. Of course, the _grève générale_\r\n   can be realised only by an understanding throughout an\r\n   organisation far-seeing and complete, and then, only, thanks\r\n   to a certain combination of circumstances; but this is not\r\n   saying it cannot be realised.\r\n\r\n   “It is easy to brand such a programme as tainted with Utopia\r\n   and struck with sterility. But to do so is to refuse to\r\n   recognise the sense of facts and especially the power of a\r\n   unique idea. Bear in mind that this idea of the _grève\r\n   générale_ has already thousands of adherents, not only in\r\n   France, but in Germany, in England, in America, and you will\r\n   have some chance of appreciating the significance of the\r\n   strike of to-day, so different from the strike of yesterday,\r\n   in spite of a few traditional incidents into which the\r\n   strikers and the government have been betrayed.”\r\n\r\nGeffroy, the writer of the above, is not an anarchist, but a socialist.\r\nFew anarchists see in the _grève générale_, as he does, a purely passive\r\nrevolution, which will prevail without the shedding of a drop of blood\r\nor any other violence whatsoever. Most of its anarchist advocates regard\r\nit, “not as a strike of folded arms, but as a general revolt of the\r\nproletariat, outside of all political lines, for the conquest of the\r\nmeans of production and for complete emancipation.”\r\n\r\nThe _grève générale_ apart, the anarchist who enters the trade-union[24]\r\ndoes it, incidentally, perhaps, to rid the union of the curse of\r\npolitics and to score over the socialists, but primarily to transform it\r\nby the influence of precept (and, still more, of example) from “a reform\r\nmovement for the defence of the material and moral interests of the\r\nworkers, and especially the satisfaction of such immediate desires as\r\nthe amelioration of salaries and the diminution of the working day,”\r\ninto “an economic movement of the working class against the capitalistic\r\nclass for the suppression of the latter and of the régime which they\r\nrepresent.”\r\n\r\nConsequently, anarchist writings are replete with solemn warnings to the\r\nfaithful against the insidious peril of having anything to do with the\r\nunions with any other object in view than that of making them other than\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nFrom co-operation, as from trade-unionism, the purists of anarchy keep\r\nthemselves prudently aloof by reason of the risk of contamination from\r\ntoo close contact with commercial processes and partial measures.\r\n\r\nOther anarchists—the majority, perhaps—are still holding co-operation\r\nunder observation, waiting for it to display more satisfactory\r\ncredentials before they declare themselves. Thus the _Etudiants\r\nSocialistes Révolutionnaires Internationalistes_[25] “have pronounced\r\nfor it,” says A. D. Bancel, “all in pronouncing against it.”\r\n\r\nOthers do not object to participating passively in the movement, so that\r\nthey are not called on to aid in the work of organisation and serve on\r\nboards and committees.\r\n\r\nThe rest have espoused it with more or less enthusiasm because its\r\nefforts are economic rather than political, because it militates against\r\nsocialism, because it is a phase of the struggle between classes;\r\nbecause it is of a high educational value to the proletariat in showing\r\nit its real position; because it fosters internationalism; because its\r\nunit, the co-operative group, like the union, is an expression of\r\nsolidarity, an excellent field for the _propagande par l’exemple_ and a\r\nconvenient weapon of combat; and finally because its ultimate aim is _la\r\nliberté intégrale_.\r\n\r\nThere is a _pan-coopération_ as there is a _grève universelle_. And, as\r\nthe _grève universelle_ (which is the revolution) is regarded by some as\r\nthe inevitable consummation of trade-unionism, so _la pan-coopération_,\r\nalias _la république coopérative_, alias _l’alliance coopérative\r\ninternationale_ (which is likewise the revolution), is regarded by some\r\nas the inevitable consummation of co-operation.\r\n\r\nBy these latter a critical moment is foreseen when the angry meeting of\r\n_le capitalisme autoritaire_ and _le coopératisme libertaire_ will\r\nkindle a colossal, world-wide, and purifying conflagration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PROPAGANDA OF ANARCHY “PAR LE FAIT”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_I came not to send peace, but a sword.... I am come to send\r\n   fire on the earth._”—JESUS CHRIST.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_It is not by metaphysics that men will be undeceived: the\r\n   truth must be proven by deeds._”—VOLTAIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Not songs of loyalty alone are these,\r\n    But songs of insurrection also,\r\n    For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over,\r\n    And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,\r\n    And stakes his life to be lost at any moment.”\r\n\r\n    WALT WHITMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “La force destructive est une force créatice.”—BAKOUNINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_If I were dying of starvation, and had no means of buying a\r\n   piece of bread, and were to go by a baker’s where bread was\r\n   within reach, I should help myself to it. And the way I should\r\n   reason would be this: That bread belongs to the baker, but it\r\n   is more God’s bread than it is the baker’s, and I am one of\r\n   God’s little boys, and therefore understand the proximity of\r\n   this loaf to be the answer to the prayer I offered my Father\r\n   this morning: ‘Give me this day my daily bread_.’”—DR. CHARLES\r\n   PARKHURST.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_His [Dr. Parkhurst’s] principle of necessity is one easily\r\n   misapplied; but it is right, notwithstanding Dr. Johnson’s\r\n   reply to the man whose excuse for stealing a loaf of bread was\r\n   that he ‘must live.’ ‘I don’t see the necessity,’ said the\r\n   rude moralist. And so said the custodian of morality when\r\n   David stole the shew-bread for his starving soldiers; but our\r\n   Lord said he did right._”—Editorial in NEW YORK INDEPENDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_I hold it blasphemy that a man ought not to fight against\r\n   authority. There is no great religion and no great freedom\r\n   that has not done it in the beginning._”—GEORGE ELIOT, in\r\n   Felix Holt, the Radical.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to doctrines, ultimate aims, and the three methods of\r\ndisseminating them already described,—oral and written propaganda and\r\nthe propaganda by example,—French anarchists are all of the same mind;\r\nbut with regard to the fourth means, the propaganda by the overt act of\r\nviolence (_la propagande par le fait_), there is anything but unanimity\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nNo anarchist, the simon-pure Tolstoyan excepted, denies the right to\r\ncollective revolt, the duty, even, of insurrection. But this attitude\r\nhas nothing distinctive about it. The same right and the same duty have\r\nbeen affirmed and reaffirmed by the republicans of all ages, and by the\r\nroyalists, also, when they have been temporarily out of power, the only\r\nappreciable difference being that the republicans and royalists have\r\nesteemed them as a means of realising rather than a means of spreading\r\ntheir ideal.\r\n\r\nThe emergence into public prominence of the insurrectional idea which\r\nanarchists had long held—more or less consciously—dates from the Peace\r\nCongress held in Geneva in 1867, at which the Belgian César de Paepe\r\ncreated a sensation by declaring that “not peace, but war, must be\r\npreached.” “Peace,” he explained, “can be hoped for only as a fruit of\r\nvictory in the social war.” Bakounine, just then coming to the front in\r\nEurope, lent the weight of his authority to De Paepe’s idea.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, the _Fédération Italienne_ approved a definite declaration\r\n(signed by Cafiero and Malatesta) of the same purport:—\r\n\r\n   “The _Fédération Italienne_ believes that insurrection,\r\n   destined to affirm by deeds the principles of liberty, is the\r\n   most efficacious agency of propaganda and the only one which,\r\n   without corrupting and deceiving the masses, can penetrate\r\n   even the lowest social strata, and draw the live forces of\r\n   humanity into the struggle the _Internationale_ is carrying\r\n   on.”\r\n\r\nFour months later, in the spring of 1877, this credo of insurrection was\r\nput in practice at Letino and San Galo, Italy, where Cafiero, Malatesta,\r\nCeccarelli, and the rural priests, Fortini and Tamburini, with thirty\r\nfollowers, took possession of the public buildings, imprisoned or drove\r\nout the local authorities, set fire to the archives and property\r\nrecords, and seized and distributed the tax money among the people.\r\n\r\nThe same year a memorial of the Congress of Fribourg, signed by\r\nKropotkine and Elisée Reclus among others, declared:—\r\n\r\n   “We are revolutionists because we desire justice. Never has\r\n   great progress, special or general, been made by simple,\r\n   pacific evolution. It has always been made by a revolution. If\r\n   the work of mental preparation is accomplished slowly, the\r\n   realisation of the ideas occurs quickly,”—an utterance with\r\n   which may be compared Kropotkine’s, “Governments have never\r\n   done anything but give a legal sanction to accomplished\r\n   revolutionary facts”; Jean Grave’s, “We are revolutionists\r\n   because we have the reasoned conviction that the privileged\r\n   will not abandon one of their privileges if they are not\r\n   forced to it”; and this confession of Guillaume Froment in\r\n   Zola’s _Paris_:—\r\n\r\n   “I was only a positivist, a savant given over entirely to\r\n   observation and experience, accepting nothing beyond the\r\n   verified fact. Scientifically, socially, I admitted a simple\r\n   and slow evolution, generating humanity as the human being\r\n   himself is generated. And it was then that, in the history of\r\n   the globe and in that of societies, I was forced to make a\r\n   place for the volcano, the abrupt cataclysm, the sudden\r\n   eruption, which has marked each geologic phase, each historic\r\n   period. One comes thus to perceive that a step has never been\r\n   taken, nor a progress made, without the aid of terrible\r\n   catastrophes. Every forward march has sacrificed billions of\r\n   existences. Our narrow justice revolts, we treat Nature as an\r\n   atrocious mother; but, if we do not excuse the volcano, we\r\n   must, nevertheless, endure it as forewarned savants when it\r\n   breaks out, and then, ah! then, I am perhaps a dreamer, like\r\n   the others: I have my ideas.”\r\n\r\nThe year following the Fribourg Congress (1878) Kropotkine warmly\r\nadvocated insurrection before the Congress of the _Fédération\r\nJurasienne_. “By insurrections,” he said, “the anarchists seek to\r\nquicken popular sentiment and initiative to the double end of a violent\r\nexpropriation and the disorganisation of the state.” The congress\r\npronounced formally in favour of the insurrectional principle, and from\r\nthat day to this it has never been seriously questioned in any important\r\nanarchist quarter.\r\n\r\nIf the overt act by the individual anarchist is not viewed with the same\r\nunanimous and unqualified approval as the collective act of\r\ninsurrection, it is because there is an easy distinction (representing,\r\nperhaps, a real difference) to be made between the individual act\r\ndirected against the principle of authority incarnated in an official of\r\nthe state,—president, minister, deputy, general, senator, judge, and\r\npolice prefect,—when it comes under the general head of regicide (a\r\nreform measure which is almost as old as the world), and the individual\r\nact directed against the principle of property incarnated in any member\r\nof the _bourgeoisie_ whatsoever, when it comes under the general head—O\r\ndeterrent power of a name!—of murder.\r\n\r\nThe first kind of individual attempt (regicide) encounters little\r\nopposition based on principle within the anarchist ranks. It is opposed,\r\nas Alexander H. Stephens opposed the foundation of the Confederacy (of\r\nwhich he accepted the vice-presidency, once it was declared), on grounds\r\nof expediency. As regicides, Caserio, Vaillant,[26] Bresci,[27] Pallas\r\n(whose attempt against the Maréchal Campos was glorified by the\r\nInternational Labor Congress at Chicago in 1893), and the assassin of\r\nAlexander II. fall into much the same category as Brutus, Cromwell,\r\nHarmodius and Aristogiton, and the executioners of Louis XVI.; and, in\r\nthe case at least of the assassin of the czar, the classification,\r\nwhile not perhaps ideal, might be worse.\r\n\r\nAs to weapons, the popular distinction (which is, in fact, more nice\r\nthan wise) between the pistol and stiletto, on the one hand, and the\r\nbomb, on the other, is not made. “I admit all means, even the bomb,”\r\nsays Charles Malato, who approved Pallas and Vaillant, but regretted\r\nHenry’s attempted slaughter of the bourgeois at the _Café Terminus_, “if\r\nonly it be well placed; and yet I am not a drinker of blood.”\r\n\r\nThe second kind of individual attempt—the suppression of members of the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ for the sole reason that they are bourgeois—is\r\ndisapproved by all the anarchists but a small knot of extremists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES MALATO]\r\n\r\nThis disapproval, which is for the most part purely formal and passive\r\nwhen the act attains the person against whom it was directed, and its\r\nunselfishness is immediately evident, may become aggressive, not to say\r\nbitter, in certain quarters, when a tragic botch has been made of the\r\njob (by a mistake in victims) or when its significance as an act of\r\npropaganda has been obscured by the presence of motives of personal\r\nrevenge. Elisée Reclus, of all the eminent French theoricians, has shown\r\nhimself the most consistently refractory to this sort of _propagande par\r\nle fait_. In an article called out by the rapid succession of individual\r\nattempts in 1892, he said:—\r\n\r\n   “When you have a grudge against a person, you seek him out,\r\n   you have an explanation with him, but you do not make innocent\r\n   persons bear the brunt of your rancour.\r\n\r\n   “Anarchy is the _summum_ of humane theories. Whoso calls\r\n   himself anarchist should be gentle and good. All overt acts of\r\n   the nature of that of yesterday are looked on by true\r\n   _compagnons_ as crimes. If those who perpetrate these\r\n   barbarities act with the design of promulgating the anarchist\r\n   creed, they deceive themselves completely.\r\n\r\n   “Things will come to such a pass, there will be such disgust\r\n   with the _compagnons_, they will inspire such horror, that no\r\n   one will be willing to hear anarchy so much as spoken of.\r\n\r\n   “And yet the idea is beautiful: it is grand. See to it that it\r\n   is respected. The persons who do evil in its name befoul our\r\n   doctrines.”\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy for the outsider to grasp why, of two anarchist\r\nacts of violence with similar exterior aspects, the same _camarade_\r\npraises the one and deplores the other. What is more, he will understand\r\nstill less when the _camarade_ has explained. There are labyrinths of\r\nsubtleties in anarchist apologetics through whose intricate windings the\r\nlay intelligence has no Ariadne-given thread to guide it, and depths of\r\nesoteric metaphysics which only the plummet of the adept can sound.\r\n\r\nVaillant had almost unanimous plaudits from the _camarades_, no little\r\npraise from the socialists, and approval—mark the humorous note!—from\r\ncertain of the deputies whose lives he had jeopardised.\r\n\r\nRavachol, author of the explosions at the houses of the judges Benoit\r\nand Bulot and of other overt acts less readily comprehensible, was\r\npractically repudiated at first by the _Temps Nouveaux_ (then _La\r\nRévolte_) on account of a dubious past, but was recognised loyally, if\r\nlanguidly, as soon as his entire disinterestedness was made plain.\r\n\r\nThe general attitude of the _Temps Nouveaux_ towards the _propagande par\r\nle fait_ is one of guarded detachment, verging on complete\r\nindifference,—an attitude of rare prudence, sanity, and sagacity. It\r\ntreats the whole matter of the individual attempt as a side issue, with\r\nan unfortunate tendency to divert the attention of both the faithful and\r\nthe unfaithful from the basal principles of anarchy, and makes it very\r\nclear that it would ignore it altogether if it could.\r\n\r\n   “If anarchy,” says this representative journal, “does not\r\n   reject violence when it is demonstrated to be indispensable to\r\n   enfranchisement, it does not elevate it into a system.\r\n   Violence is for it a means, debatable, like everything, but\r\n   which is, at most, only an accessory affair. It must disappear\r\n   when the obstacles are overcome, and weakens in nothing any of\r\n   the elements of the ideal itself....\r\n\r\n   “Deeds are not counselled, nor spoken, nor written. They are\r\n   done. Sometimes a deed done effects more than a long period of\r\n   writing. This journal will always be the first to applaud\r\n   those who act. We are, then, far from repelling the\r\n   _propagande par le fait_. Only—we have said it before, and we\r\n   repeat it—the _propagande par le fait_ cannot be the work of a\r\n   journal. It is not for us to say to individuals: ‘Do this! Do\r\n   that!’ If they are convinced and conscientious, they will know\r\n   what they have to do....\r\n\r\n   “To say to the workers, ‘Do this, burn that, hang that one,’\r\n   is child’s play, since the reader may demand with reason why\r\n   he who preaches so glibly does not do himself what he urges\r\n   others to do.”\r\n\r\nThe American labour leaders are wont to assure us, while reserving to\r\nthemselves in all cases the right to criticism and opposition, that\r\nthere never has been, using terms broadly, and never can be, an\r\nunsuccessful strike, since the strike that is the least necessary and\r\nmost immediately disastrous serves the large purpose of focussing public\r\nattention on the strained relations between capital and labour, of\r\nrevealing by a sort of cathode-ray efficacy the hidden ills of the body\r\npolitic, and so of bringing just that much the nearer the final cure.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the anarchist leaders assert that in anarchy no forces are\r\nlost, and that the manifestations which are, in appearance, the most\r\nfoolhardy and shocking may have, equally with those which are, in\r\nappearance, the most reasonable, the saving merit of compelling the\r\nthoughtless world to think. “And perhaps,” says one of these leaders,\r\n“it will occur to the hide-bound _bourgeoisie_ to find society\r\ndefective when they shall have discovered that there is some danger in\r\nperpetuating its errors.”\r\n\r\n   “The anarchist had been told,” wrote Zo d’Axa in _L’Endehors_,\r\n   apropos of the dynamite exploits of an unknown, who turned out\r\n   to be Ravachol, “that the idea for which he was willing to\r\n   brave every danger did not exist. He had had it dinned into\r\n   his ears that, in other times, the precursors talked less and\r\n   acted more. His theory had been laughed at. His hope had been\r\n   mocked. When, upon the highway as an apostle, he had attempted\r\n   to convert the people, no one of these laughers and mockers\r\n   had been willing to tarry and listen an instant.\r\n\r\n   “Now, behold him!\r\n\r\n   “Like the street vender drawing crude charcoal pictures on the\r\n   sidewalk to attract the cockney crowd to which he means to\r\n   offer an _article de Paris_ a little later, a primitive\r\n   propagandist of anarchy has decided to force attention by the\r\n   brutality of an act.\r\n\r\n   “Back of this act is the faith, so much tabooed, to which he\r\n   has at last drawn fruitful discussion.\r\n\r\n   “It was an Idea the dynamiter displayed.\r\n\r\n   “And no one can deny it,—at the moment when, by favour of the\r\n   excitement, the journals are giving their readers the very\r\n   ‘_articles de Paris_’ which the terrible unknown dreamed of\r\n   showing. Side by side with their invectives the _Figaro_, the\r\n   _Eclair_, other sheets, print and expound theories which had\r\n   not had the freedom of their columns before. These journals\r\n   have become, in spite of their reserves, the propagators of\r\n   the accursed Idea.\r\n\r\n   “Is it a result?\r\n\r\n   “Men read, discuss, realise perhaps.”\r\n\r\nTo _comprehend_ the foregoing manner of reasoning or, rather, point of\r\nview (the word “comprehend” is italicised lest any one confound\r\ninoffensive comprehension with dangerous approval), one must have had in\r\nsome country or other some bitter experience—stinging rebuke or\r\nangering, insulting rebuff—with the vapid self-complacency, the\r\ndogmatic thick-wittedness, the dictatorial stubborness, and the cruel\r\nhard-heartedness of the bourgeois. One must have been shocked and\r\nsickened by his vulgar flaunting of a stupid—or wicked?—determination\r\nto persist in his denial that his fellow-men ever starve, unless he can\r\nsee them, with his own eyes, throw up their hands dramatically, stagger,\r\nand fall around him.\r\n\r\nIf one has had this disillusionising experience with the bourgeois, he\r\nwill _comprehend_—there will be no lapsing here into such atrociously\r\nbad form as hinting the possibility of acquiescence—that there are\r\nnumerous poor devils who say, “Let the bourgeois have the dramatic\r\ndemonstration of starvation, since he will credit no other!”\r\n\r\nHe will _comprehend_ that there are some, not poor devils, who think\r\nthat a certain manifestation of the hungry in Trafalgar Square was a\r\nbeautiful eye-opener for the British public; that there are others who\r\nlook upon the march of Coxey’s grotesque army as anything but a\r\nridiculous failure; and that there are still others who, recalling a\r\nmemorable famine winter in Boston,—the shudderful winter when the\r\nauthority of the state was invoked to disperse a peaceable assembling of\r\nthe unemployed,—hold it a real pity that the assembling was quite so\r\npeaceable.\r\n\r\nHe will _comprehend_ these last when they say that a few broken\r\nwindow-panes in the swaggering Back Bay and self-sufficient West End\r\nwould have made the inhabitants of those districts less glib in their\r\nassertions that there was no real suffering in the city and less eager,\r\nby way of a clinching argument, to parrot, as having happened to their\r\nvery selves, the incident which probably did happen sometime and\r\nsomewhere to some one, thanks to some irresponsible tramp’s sense of\r\nhumour,—of the professedly hungry man who refused to work because he\r\nhad a previous engagement to march in the procession of the unemployed.\r\n\r\nThere is an appreciable distance from broken windows to broken heads.\r\nStill it is plain enough that the person who can _comprehend_ the point\r\nof view that in a given exigency applauds the first can _comprehend_\r\n(always bear in mind that this word is an innocuous one) the point of\r\nview that in a graver exigency applauds the second.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that there are bourgeois, as there are dogs, who\r\nunderstand no argument and respect no appeal but the blow,—let it not\r\nbe said here that it is true,—it is not surprising, however deplorable\r\nit may be, that there are those among the proletariat who find it “a\r\nsource of innocent merriment,” in the words of Gilbert’s Lord High\r\nExecutioner, “to make the penalty fit the crime.”\r\n\r\nAnarchist and dynamiter are so far from being interchangeable terms that\r\nit would be possible and, perhaps, justifiable to write a treatise on\r\nthe theory of anarchy without making the slightest reference to\r\ndynamiting or any other form of the _propagande par le fait_. Taken by\r\nitself, the list of the overt anarchist acts in France during the last\r\ntwenty-five years seems a long one; but, when it is viewed in the light\r\nof the total number of anarchist believers, it is evident that the\r\ndynamiter is the exception among the _camarades_. When, furthermore, the\r\nfew hundred victims anarchy has made in all the world during the quarter\r\nof a century it has been militant are compared with the number of the\r\nvictims the Minotaur—poverty—devours in a single country in a single\r\nyear,[28] or with the havoc wrought by any one of the commoner diseases,\r\nanarchy as a menace to human life ceases to appear a very serious\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the alarm the _propagande par le fait_ has excited is not\r\nto be wondered at. The dread of the dynamiter, like the savage’s dread\r\nof the railroad, is a dread of the mysterious and uncontrollable,\r\nsuperstitious perhaps, but which no amount of civilisation can entirely\r\neradicate from the human mind. Lightning, which also does relatively\r\nlittle damage, is feared, and will probably continue to be feared so\r\nlong as there is no forecasting where it will strike.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the new dynamite propaganda the unknown quantities were,\r\nin the beginning at least, so numerous as to be bewildering; and several\r\nof them still remain uneliminated. Much more is now known about\r\nanarchist doctrines, about the nature and power of dynamite, and the\r\nother fabulously destructive modern explosives, and a little more about\r\nthe characters of the persons who employ these explosives. But the\r\ndynamiter’s seeming illogicality in the choice of his victims and his\r\nactual inability—comparable only to a woman’s proverbial awkwardness in\r\nthrowing a stone—to attain the victims he has chosen, while he does\r\nattain others, are as pronounced as ever.\r\n\r\nWhen throwers of bombs massacre persons they would not have harmed for\r\nthe world, and when bombs are found in such diverse spots as cafés,\r\nrestaurants, hotels, churches, soldiers’ recruiting offices and\r\nbarracks, police stations, bazaars, private dwellings, public markets,\r\nstock exchanges, employment bureaus, and old people’s homes, who,\r\nindeed, can boast of his security? In the course of the years 1891-95\r\nthe fear of the dynamiters assumed such proportions as to amount almost\r\nto a panic, and this period is still referred to as “The Terror” in\r\ncertain quarters.\r\n\r\n   “_Ah, ah! c’est pas un’ crac\r\n     La dynamit’ nous fich’ l’ trac,_”\r\n\r\nsang the clever _Montmartrois chansonnier_ Eugène Lemercier in a witty\r\ntopical song, _Le Trac de la Dynamite_, which had an enormous vogue.\r\n\r\nAt that time irresponsible rumour attributed to the _camarades_, to the\r\n“_catastrophards_,” such fell and fantastic schemes for the annihilation\r\nof the old society as the dispersion of malignant microbes, the\r\npoisoning of the water supply, and the introduction of nitro-glycerine\r\ninto reservoirs, conduits, and sewers. There were frequent thefts of\r\ndynamite, the authors of which remained for some time at large. An\r\nanarchist _cocher_ (probably demented) rode down pedestrians in\r\npursuance of a vow he had made to exterminate the bourgeois. Public\r\nalarm was aggravated by the professional imaginings of the reporters and\r\nthe police. It was wantonly played upon by the _estampeurs_\r\n(blackmailers and swindlers vaguely affiliated with “the groups”), who\r\ncoined money by selling to a willingly gullible press bogus tips of\r\nconspiracies and contemplated explosions,—notably the mining of the\r\n_Opéra_, the _Palais de Justice_, and the Presidential Tribune at\r\nLongchamp, and the assassination of Leo XIII.,—and by _fumistes_\r\n(practical jokers), who perpetrated sardonic jokes with sand, iron\r\nfilings, and sardine boxes, which were taken to the municipal\r\nlaboratories[29] with the same infinite precautions as the real bombs in\r\nthe ominous-looking vehicle presided over by the _cocher_ “Ramasse” and\r\ndrawn by the horse “Dynamite.”\r\n\r\nDuring “The Terror” landlords begged or ordered magistrate tenants to\r\nquit their premises, lest they draw down bombs as trees draw down the\r\nthunderbolts, and added to their “TO LET” notices these reassuring\r\nwords, “IL N’Y A PAS DE MAGISTRAT DANS LA MAISON”; the neighbours of\r\njudges compromised by the anarchist trials hastily moved into other\r\nparts of the city and even into the country; rag-pickers and\r\n_concièrges_ fainted or had hysterics at the sight of sardine tins in\r\nthe garbage boxes; _concièrges_ quakingly told their heads before\r\nventuring to open the street doors for their own belated lodgers;\r\nanarchist tenants were as sedulously sought as magistrate lodgers were\r\navoided, were loaded with soft words and favours, and implored not to\r\nworry themselves about their rent bills; and café and restaurant garçons\r\nvied with each other in flattering the caprices of their anarchist\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\nFlor O’Squarr tells of an anarchist, real or assumed, who, having\r\nregaled himself with a bountiful repast in a high-priced restaurant\r\nclose by the Madeleine, called for the proprietor, and said:—\r\n\r\n“I have had an excellent meal, and I haven’t a sou to pay for it. Arrest\r\nme, if you like; but I warn you that I am an anarchist, and that you\r\nexpose yourself to the vengeance of my associates. Choose!” The\r\npanic-stricken Boniface insisted on drinking the audacious fellow’s\r\nhealth in champagne, and, when visited the following day by the police,\r\nwho had heard of the affair, refused to make complaint against the\r\nswindler or give information that might lead to his detection. “A\r\ncharming person, very polite, very well bred, and not proud,” was all\r\nthat could be got out of him.\r\n\r\n“_Le vol_” (theft) is another recognised form of the _propagande par le\r\nfait_.\r\n\r\n“Are you cold,” says Charles Malato, “then enter the great bazaars which\r\nare crammed with unused garments, and take them; are you hungry, invade\r\nthe meat-shops. Everything human industry produces belongs to you\r\nbecause you are men, and you are cravens if you do not take what you\r\nneed.” Several international congresses have passed resolutions\r\nexhorting the hungry to take food wherever they can find it.\r\n\r\nAbout this right of the individual to take for himself whatever is\r\nnecessary to sustain his life, a right admitted theoretically,\r\nfor the matter of that, by many who do not consider themselves\r\nrevolutionists,—by popes, prelates, and theologians even, all the way\r\nfrom Saint Thomas to Manning and Parkhurst,—anarchists of all\r\ncomplexions agree absolutely. But over the right to steal in general\r\nthere is as much dispute among them as there is over the right to kill.\r\nSome hold stealing meritorious, if the victims are properly chosen;\r\nothers, if the profits are devoted scrupulously to the oral or written\r\npropaganda; others still, if they are turned over to the poor. Those who\r\napprove theft unreservedly are few indeed. Jean Grave admits that he is\r\nsomewhat perplexed, but inclines to approve the open, defiant theft. He\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n   “Anarchy recognises in every individual from the moment he has\r\n   seen the light of day the right to live. Individuals suffer\r\n   from hunger by reason of a defective social organisation. And\r\n   yet the planet has still, and will have for a long time,\r\n   enough and more than enough to nourish the beings it carries.\r\n   Every individual who finds himself reduced by the fault of\r\n   society to a want of bread has the right to rebel against\r\n   society, to take food wherever it exists....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POSSIBLE REVOLUTIONISTS]\r\n\r\n   “Nevertheless, there is a thing that puzzles many of us;\r\n   namely, the ignoble means it is necessary to employ, if one\r\n   would steal, the perpetual deceit to throw the victim off his\r\n   guard, the constant duplicity to capture his confidence....\r\n\r\n   “Every one acts as he understands, as he can. If his ways of\r\n   proceeding are in contradiction with the established order of\r\n   things, it is for him and the defenders of the code to have an\r\n   explanation. But, when certain persons pretend to derive their\r\n   way of living from a special order of ideas, when they seek to\r\n   disguise with the cloak of the _propagande_ deeds done for\r\n   their own preservation, we have a right to say what we think.\r\n\r\n   “If, then, we place ourselves at the view-point of the right\r\n   which the individual has to live, he may steal. It is his\r\n   privilege, especially if society drives him to want by\r\n   refusing him work. And I add that it would be very stupid of\r\n   him to commit suicide when society has made him destitute. The\r\n   right to the defence of one’s own existence being primordial,\r\n   one must take where there is.\r\n\r\n   “But, if the act of stealing is to assume a character of\r\n   revendication or of protest against the defective organisation\r\n   of society, it must be performed openly, without any\r\n   subterfuge.\r\n\r\n   “‘But,’ retort the defenders of _le vol_, ‘the individual who\r\n   acts openly will deprive himself thus of the possibility of\r\n   continuing. He will lose thereby his liberty, since he will be\r\n   at once arrested, tried, and condemned.’\r\n\r\n   “Granted. But, if the individual who steals in the name of the\r\n   right to revolt resorts to ruse, he does nothing more nor less\r\n   than the first thief that comes along who steals to live\r\n   without embarrassing himself with theories.\r\n\r\n   “It is with stealing as it is with the military service. There\r\n   are persons who refuse to let themselves be enrolled,\r\n   preferring to expatriate themselves. This way of proceeding\r\n   has its little character of protestation. But alongside of\r\n   these there are others who, by the simulation of an infirmity,\r\n   by taking advantage of an exemption or the utilisation of an\r\n   efficacious protection, manage to evade military servitude.\r\n   They are right, surely,—a thousand times right,—from their\r\n   point of view. But, if they tell us that they have thereby\r\n   performed acts of revolutionary propaganda, and contributed to\r\n   demolish the régime, it would be easy to demonstrate that\r\n   their claim is false....\r\n\r\n   “To resort to ruse, to dissimulate, in order to capture the\r\n   confidence of the person one is planning to despoil, is, it\r\n   must be confessed, an unwholesome and degrading line of\r\n   conduct.”\r\n\r\nAmong the few Paris pilferers whose lives have distilled the odour of\r\nsanctity, who have taken on themselves to perpetuate the tradition of\r\nthe magnanimous bandit, the philanthropic pirate, and the tender-hearted\r\noutlaw, to incarnate the paradox of the “_bon voleur_” (honest thief),\r\nthe two most famous are Pini and Duval.\r\n\r\nClément Duval, who robbed and attempted to burn the mansion of Mlle.\r\nMadeleine Lemaire, was an iron worker of an independent spirit, who\r\nbecame so disgusted with the sufferings and humiliations of the\r\nlabourer’s lot that he determined to make a dramatic protest. His\r\nprevious record was absolutely clean, save for a petty theft from an\r\nemployer when his _compagne_ and children had eaten nothing for\r\ntwenty-four hours; and he carried away from the Lemaire residence only a\r\nsmall part of the valuables at his disposal, which shows that gain was\r\nnot his primary object. In his written defence, which the presiding\r\njudge, Berard des Glajeux, did not allow him to read, he dwelt at great\r\nlength on the hardships of the working-woman. In fact, Duval was a\r\nfeminist of the first water. Saint Clément Duval! Forget him not,\r\nfeminists, when you make up your calendar of saints!\r\n\r\nIn the _Revue Bleue_, a publication which can hardly be accused of\r\nhaving a revolutionary bias, M. Paul Mimande wrote of Duval: “Well, to\r\nmy thinking, this thief, this incendiary, is _honnête_.... I believe him\r\nincapable of robbing and killing to satisfy his cupidity. He worked for\r\nthe collectivity alone. Duval has the serenity of the _illuminé_ who\r\nsuffers for a holy cause. He is logical in submitting, without murmurs\r\nor protestations, to the hard rules of the _bagne_. Very sincerely, he\r\nrefuses to find himself disgraced by the livery of the convict; and he\r\nshows it by his bearing and his talk. His conscience cries out to him\r\nthat he has acted well. What does the rest matter!\r\n\r\n  “I had a long conversation with Clément Duval. I questioned him\r\n  searchingly; and I discerned in his phrases, ardent, but\r\n  hollow, a sort of atavic duplicate of the times of John Huss.”\r\n\r\nDuval had neither instruction nor the gift of eloquence, and succeeded\r\nill in explaining his theories to the jury of the Seine. Pini, on the\r\nother hand, who had been at great pains to educate himself, was an\r\norator and philosopher as well as a student. His defence—less a defence\r\nof himself than of his theory of the right to steal (_le droit au\r\nvol_)—was as splendid a bit of impertinence as was ever delivered in a\r\ncourt-room.\r\n\r\nCalmly, cynically, with a control of voice and charm of gesture that\r\nwould have done credit to the most gifted advocate, he said (in part):—\r\n\r\n   “As to us anarchists, it is with the untroubled assurance of\r\n   performing a duty that we make our attacks on property. We\r\n   have two objects in view: first, to claim for ourselves the\r\n   natural right to existence which you bourgeois concede to\r\n   beasts and deny to men; second, to provide ourselves with the\r\n   materials best suited for destroying your show, and, if it\r\n   becomes necessary, you with it. This manner of reasoning makes\r\n   your hair stand on end; but what would you have? This is the\r\n   state of the case. The new times have come. There was a time\r\n   when the starving wretch who appropriated a morsel of bread,\r\n   and was arraigned before your plethoric persons therefor,\r\n   admitted that he had committed a crime, craved pardon, and\r\n   promised to perish of hunger (he and his family) rather than\r\n   touch again the property of another. He was ashamed to show\r\n   his face. To-day it is very different. Extremes meet; and man,\r\n   after having sunk so low, is retrieving himself splendidly.\r\n   Arraigned before you for having smashed the strong boxes of\r\n   your compeers, he does not excuse his act, but defends it,\r\n   proves to you with pride that he has yielded to the natural\r\n   need of retaking what had been previously stolen from him; he\r\n   proves to you that his act is superior in morality to all your\r\n   laws, flouts your mouthings and your authority, and in the\r\n   very teeth of your accusations against him tells you that the\r\n   real thieves, _messieurs les juges!_ are you and your\r\n   bourgeois band.\r\n\r\n   “This is precisely my case. Be assured I do not blush under\r\n   your charges, and I experience a delicious pleasure in being\r\n   called thief by you.”\r\n\r\nMaître Labori’s eloquent pleading, though it did much to establish his\r\nreputation as an advocate, proved as vain in the case of this refractory\r\n_prolétaire_ as it did later in the case of his bourgeois client,\r\nDreyfus; and Pini was given twenty years of hard labour for his thieving\r\nand his impertinent impenitence.\r\n\r\nPini whose thefts were legion, Pini who in the guise of the son of an\r\nItalian cardinal paid reconnoitring visits to the archbishopric of\r\nParis, and dreamed the colossal dream of rifling the Vatican, Pini, I\r\nsay, never stole for himself nor for his friends, but only for the\r\npropaganda, for humanity. He was the altruistic thief of the century’s\r\nclose _par excellence_. Every son of his thieving was devoted to the\r\ncause. He gave to street beggars freely, but always from his legitimate\r\nearnings, never from the proceeds of his expeditions, and never without\r\nreproaching them for stretching out their hands to beg when they might\r\nsteal. “Sometimes, even in winter,” says one who claims to have known\r\nhim well, “Pini, half-clothed and almost barefoot, traversed Paris to\r\ncarry assistance to the destitute _compagnons_. He distributed among\r\nthem one franc or two francs out of his own pocket; but he did not\r\nencroach upon the capital of two or three hundred louis which had\r\nresulted from his last exploit. He subsidised several French and Italian\r\npresses for the printing of journals, manifests, and placards. The\r\nstolen money belonged to the cause, to the idea, to the future.”\r\n\r\nWhen he gave of his consecrated hoard to individuals, as he sometimes\r\ndid, it was always because the propaganda was directly involved. Thus\r\nhe supported for two years at the University of Milan the son of an\r\nimprisoned _camarade_, and aided many of the _camarades_ who were in\r\nprison or who had been obliged to flee to escape imprisonment. He was\r\nblamed by some of his associates for having invested a sum of stolen\r\nmoney in an industrial enterprise. The blame was just from the anarchist\r\npoint of view; and yet, even in this case, the profits were plainly\r\ndestined in advance for the propaganda.\r\n\r\nWithin the last two or three years the treasures of the churches have\r\nbeen the greatest sufferers from the pilferers on principle, who have\r\nbeen inflamed by the anti-clerical campaign of the Combes ministry.\r\n\r\nAs anarchist killings have been very little formidable, viewed in the\r\nlarge, so the aggregate of the anarchist stealings is, in social or\r\ncriminal statistics, a negligible quantity. These stealings have not\r\nbrought expropriation appreciably nearer, and have only served the\r\nanarchist cause, if they have served it at all, by keeping before the\r\npublic mind the fact that the anarchist theory is as much opposed to\r\nproperty as it is to government.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the thieves who call themselves anarchists in court are\r\nthieves first and anarchists afterwards,—eleventh-hour converts, who,\r\nhaving fallen on the misfortune of detection, essay to play anarchist\r\nrôles, prompted thereto by a sense of humour, a hope of securing the\r\nsympathy and support of the _camarades_, or a yearning for the homage of\r\nthe “_petit peuple de Paris_”, who, as Marcel Prévost has pointed out,\r\n“adore all revolutionists.”\r\n\r\nOne other form of _propaganda par le fait_ remains to be mentioned;\r\nnamely, counterfeiting. But anarchist counterfeiting has not been\r\nadvocated, it seems, by the accredited anarchist theoricians, and has\r\nnot been provided with a romantic halo by any master practitioner, like\r\nPini; in short, has not attained the dignity of a public peril, and\r\ncalls for no extended notice here. The greater part of the so-called\r\nanarchist counterfeiters are common criminals or vulgar charlatans with\r\nwhom anarchy is a mercenary after-thought, or they are simple police\r\nspies.\r\n\r\nThe most picturesque of the real anarchist counterfeiters who have\r\npassed through the judicial mill is the _Lyonnais poète-chansonnier_\r\nknown as “_L’Abruti_.”\r\n\r\n“_L’Abruti_” (“The Imbruted”), the uncomplimentary name, intended as a\r\nfling against society, is of his own choosing, tormented by that craving\r\nfor the great road, for space and liberty which has been the blessing\r\nand the curse of the best and the worst of men since time was,—from\r\nAbraham, Homer, Cain, Esau, and John the Baptist to Morrow, Salsou,[30]\r\nRavachol, Richepin, and Josiah Flynt; L’Abruti swore off working for the\r\ndetested bourgeois one fine day, and, shouldering a little pack in which\r\nhe had stowed a stew-pan, a coffee-pot, a set of mysterious steel\r\nimplements, and some scraps of writing-paper, set out from Lyons in true\r\ntroubadour or, to be more accurate, in true _trimardeur_ style, to make\r\nhis tour of France.\r\n\r\nSauntering out of the sunrise in the morning, between hedge-rows\r\ntraceried with the fragrant eglantine, free of fancy and free of limb;\r\nruminating the “_heureux temps d’anarchie_” prophesied by the\r\n_poète-camarade_ Laurent Tailhade, “_temps où la plèbe baiserait la\r\ntrace des pas des poètes_”; casting about for couplets with a mind\r\nattuned to Verlaine’s poetic precept,—\r\n\r\n   “_Que ton vers soit la bonne aventure\r\n     Eparse au vent crispé du matin\r\n     Qui va fleurant la menthe et le thym_”;\r\n\r\nexploring the motionless blue and the scudding white of the sky for a\r\nfresh image; exchanging good words and snuff-pinches with passing\r\nrustics and smiles and badinage with the rustics’ wives and daughters;\r\nhalting now and again to quaff from a wayside spring, to catch a\r\nthrush’s liquid note, a magpie’s gibe, or a linnet’s whistle, to\r\nunshoulder his pack, and, using it as an _escritoire_, to fix on paper a\r\njust-discovered rhyme, or, using it as a pillow, to enjoy the discreet\r\nfellowship of a pipe and out of its curling smoke-fantasies fashion\r\nUtopias; beguiling the hours of the short shadows with alternate\r\nscribblings and siestas; and sauntering into the sunset when the long\r\nshadows came,—L’Abruti passed the days.\r\n\r\nHe dined and supped by the roadside under spicy limes or voluptuous\r\nacacias, lavishing his omelettes, his coffee, and his _chansons_ on all\r\nchance passers-by.\r\n\r\nWith his mysterious implements and the aid of flame, in some dusky\r\nforest thicket where a witch might weave a spell, he fabricated the\r\nwherewithal to buy his eggs and coffee; and he passed the nights,\r\naccording to the weather, under the stars or in some hospitable grange.\r\n\r\nThe idyl was rudely interrupted—a fig for civilisation!—by the\r\nPhilistine-minded gendarmes. L’Abruti was tried, and condemned to\r\nprison, though he had never gone beyond the fabrication of the ten-cent\r\npiece, instead of being decorated, as certain bourgeois are who deserve\r\nno better of society, and counterfeit talent instead of dimes.\r\n\r\nServed him right, perhaps, for violating his country’s laws! Served him\r\nright, unquestionably,—delicious, whimsical minstrel that he was,—for\r\ndeparting from the good old begging tradition!\r\n\r\nIt seems a pity, all the same. He was such a jolly good fellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RAID BY THE POLICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_“He [Souvarine] was going out into the unknown. He was going, with his\r\ntranquil air, to his mission of extermination wherever dynamite could be\r\nfound to destroy cities and men.

The\r\nfury of the mob is explained, if not excused, by the fact that this\r\nWatrin was allowed a premium of five per cent. upon every reduction of\r\nwages he was able to accomplish, coupled with the other fact that his\r\nbrutal and insatiate rapacity had forced wages down thirty per cent. in\r\neight years.\r\n\r\nThe anarchist house-breaker, Clément Duval, had been seriously\r\nhandicapped in the struggle for existence. In the Franco-Prussian war he\r\nhad received two wounds which had rendered him permanently unfit for his\r\ntrade of iron worker, and had contracted a disease which had forced him\r\nto spend nearly four years out of ten in various hospitals. He had\r\nexperienced real want in the course of his many periods of enforced\r\nidleness.\r\n\r\nPini had suffered much at the hands of society and the state. Many a\r\ntime, when out of work, he had been glad to sleep on straw, at two cents\r\na night, in the faubourg of La Glacière. His autobiography, which he\r\nwrote in jail, while awaiting his trial, is, like every formal utterance\r\nPini ever made, exceedingly illuminating. Of his early life he says:—\r\n\r\n   “Son of a poor pariah, I began my career surrounded with the\r\n   luxuries which the _bourgeoisie_ heaps upon us from our very\r\n   cradles. I saw six of my brothers die of want. One of my\r\n   sisters wore herself out in the service of a stingy family of\r\n   bourgeois.\r\n\r\n   “My old father (an ancient Garibaldian), after a painful\r\n   existence, in which he had given to the _bourgeoisie_ sixty\r\n   years of his sweat and enriched a good number of employers,\r\n   died like a dog in a charity hospital.\r\n\r\n   “I passed my childhood in a charity asylum; and, my primary\r\n   studies finished, I was forced at the age of twelve years to\r\n   go to work in a printing-office, where I earned just one franc\r\n   a week.”\r\n\r\nDriven from Italy in his young manhood for his connection with the\r\nleaders of the “Workingman’s Party,”[32] he took refuge in Switzerland,\r\nand after a few months came to Paris.\r\n\r\nHis disillusion in regard to Paris is highly significant. He had dreamed\r\nof finding there democracy, and found flagrant inequality instead.\r\n\r\nHe was successively chimney-sweep, bricklayer, groom, coal-heaver,\r\nsawyer, clerk, and street-hawker. His tribute to the Paris workingmen,\r\nwith whom he was thus intimately thrown, is especially fine:—\r\n\r\n   “They were mostly illiterate, but reasoned better than I. They\r\n   had studied the great, practical book of suffering, the pages\r\n   of which are printed in characters of blood and tears. It was\r\n   these poor pariahs who initiated me into the great anarchistic\r\n   ideal, and who, out of the midst of their misery, expounded to\r\n   me how society could be tranquil and happy under the régime of\r\n   essential justice.\r\n\r\n   “How noble they appeared to me, these men whom the bourgeois\r\n   loaded with insults after having sucked their blood!\r\n\r\n   “The _Paroles d’un Révolté_ of Kropotkine made a fervent\r\n   anarchist of me, and it was only then that I began to perceive\r\n   men and things in their true light.”\r\n\r\nThe outrages inflicted by the Clichy police on Dardare, Decamp, and\r\nLéveillé, who had defended their right to carry the black flag,\r\nrevolvers in hand, and the cavalier treatment of these same men by the\r\npersonages of the court before which they were summoned, were the\r\nprobable provocations for the unsuccessful attempt,[33] of which\r\nRavachol was suspected to be the author, on the Clichy station-house and\r\nfor the explosions of the rue de Clichy and the Boulevard St. Germain\r\nfor which he was condemned.\r\n\r\n   “Manacled and bleeding,” wrote Zo d’Axa at the time in\r\n   _L’Endehors_, “the three men were landed in the station-house.\r\n   Their respite was not long. The officers were not slow to pay\r\n   the prisoners a visit, and this is what they brought with\r\n   them: kicks for shin-bones, pummellings for panting chests,\r\n   blows of revolver butts for aching heads. It was the dance of\r\n   the vanquished. They mauled the poor fellows with inexorable\r\n   malice and ignoble ingenuity. The police band tortured with\r\n   ferocious joy.\r\n\r\n   “When they stopped, it was from weariness and only to reopen\r\n   the séance half an hour later. So passed the day of the arrest\r\n   and other subsequent days.\r\n\r\n   “Their eyes blackened, their heads swollen and unrecognisable,\r\n   their bodies bruised, their spirits broken, the poor fellows\r\n   had no more force to resist. They remained inert under\r\n   poundings as under the lash of insult. Their wounds festered,\r\n   and they were refused water to wash the sores. A month after\r\n   the arrest the bullet that might have given him gangrene had\r\n   not been extracted from the leg of Léveillé.”\r\n\r\nSome allowance should be made in the above account for the evident\r\npartisan spirit of Zo d’Axa. But there is plenty of unbiased evidence to\r\ndemonstrate the culpability of the police in this affair and to explain\r\nthe epidemic of overt acts that came after it.\r\n\r\nRulliers and Pedduzi, who attempted (the latter with success) to kill\r\ntheir employers, had both had their work taken away because of their\r\nanarchist belief.\r\n\r\nRavachol had been driven from workshop after workshop for his opinions.\r\nIn his defence, which the presiding judge, Darrigrand, refused to allow\r\nhim to read, he said:—\r\n\r\n   “I worked to live and to make a living for those who belonged\r\n   to me. So long as neither I nor mine suffered too much, I\r\n   remained what you call honest. Then work failed me, and with\r\n   this enforced idleness came hunger. It was then that this\r\n   great law of nature, this imperious voice which brooks no\r\n   retort,—the instinct of self-preservation,—pushed me to commit\r\n   certain crimes and misdemeanours for which you reproach me and\r\n   of which I recognise myself to be the author.”\r\n\r\nThe explosion at the Véry restaurant was in retaliation for the delivery\r\nof Ravachol to the police by the garçon L’Hérot.\r\n\r\nLorion, who fired on and wounded gendarmes to prove he was calumniated\r\nin being treated by the socialists as a police spy, had been detained\r\nfor five years in the House of Correction for having insulted the police\r\nat the _age of thirteen_.\r\n\r\nPresident Carnot signed his own death warrant in refusing to commute the\r\nsentence of Vaillant, who was condemned to the guillotine for throwing a\r\nbomb which neither killed nor seriously wounded anybody.\r\n\r\n   “Whether he admits it or not,” wrote Henri Rochefort,\r\n   prophetically at the time, “M. Carnot will remain the\r\n   veritable executioner of Vaillant\r\n\r\n     ‘_Qu’il aura de ses mains lié sur la bascule._’\r\n\r\n   “And, as he will be the only one to benefit by his decision,\r\n   the least that can be asked for is that he assume all the\r\n   risks.”\r\n\r\nThe exasperation produced by the execution of Vaillant was aggravated by\r\nthe indelicacy—unpardonable from the Parisian point of view—of holding\r\nthe execution during the Carnival, and by the atrocious pleasantry of\r\nthe Minister of the Interior, Raynal, who said, “_J’ai donné des\r\nétrennes aux honnêtes gens._”\r\n\r\nGeorges Etievant, who wounded two policemen, had had his life rendered\r\nabsolutely impossible by the persecution of the police. Implicated by\r\nthem in a theft of dynamite in 1891, he is said, on good authority, to\r\nhave served his time rather than denounce the real culprit, who was a\r\nfather of a family. Banished for the first article he wrote after his\r\nrelease, he tried to practise sculpture in London, but was prevented by\r\nthe machinations of the French secret police, who made him lose all his\r\nwork. He was a starving, shelterless outcast at the moment of his crime.\r\n\r\nSalsou, who attempted the life of the Persian shah during the Exposition\r\nof 1900, had lost work by reason of his opinions earlier in life.\r\nFurthermore, he had been arrested for vagabondage at Fontainebleau while\r\nmaking his way from Lyons to Paris on foot in 1894, and, this charge of\r\nvagabondage being groundless, had been condemned to three months of\r\nprison for vaunting his anarchist belief, on the dubious testimony of a\r\npolice spy, who had been put into the same cell with him for the express\r\npurpose of “drawing him out.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALSOU]\r\n\r\nFinally, the condemnation of Salsou to hard labour for life, in\r\npunishment of a relatively insignificant attempt by which no one was\r\nhurt, was based on diplomatic rather than judicial reasoning. He died\r\nsoon after his arrival at Cayenne, in consequence, probably, of the\r\nhardships to which he was subjected. His body was thrown to the sharks\r\nin the presence of a number of functionaries, who amused themselves by\r\ntaking photographs of the fight for its possession. Certain of the\r\nprisoners, who were witnesses of this revolting scene, have taken a\r\nsolemn oath to avenge it.\r\n\r\nIt looks very much as if the high-handed suppression of free speech in\r\nFrance during the early eighties had been largely instrumental in\r\nproducing the numerous overt anarchist acts during the nineties, and as\r\nif the continued policy of the authorities in “making examples” by an\r\noverstraining of the law had inspired other anarchists to follow the\r\nexamples of those who were made examples of.\r\n\r\n   “The anarchists,” says Jean Grave, very justly, “suffer\r\n   governmental persecutions, not only when they revolt, which is\r\n   quite comprehensible, but even when they content themselves\r\n   with a peaceable propagation of their way of understanding\r\n   things, and that notwithstanding the fact that at the present\r\n   time the majority of the governors pretend to have granted the\r\n   greatest political liberty.... The police have been ferocious,\r\n   pitiless, towards the workers. They have hunted the anarchists\r\n   like wild beasts. For a word a bit strong, for an article a\r\n   trifle more violent than usual, years of prison have fallen on\r\n   them.... Treated like wild beasts, certain ones act like wild\r\n   beasts.... ‘Who sows the wind reaps the whirlwind.’”\r\n\r\nIn 1882 sixty-six anarchists were tried at Lyons, and sixty-one\r\nconvicted (fifteen for contumacy), among them Kropotkine and the\r\nscientist Emile Gauthier. The unjust condemnation of Emile Pouget and\r\nLouise Michel, referred to in a previous chapter, came soon after.\r\n\r\n   “Cyvoct was sentenced to death[34] at Lyons,” says the\r\n   Chronology of the _Père Peinard_, under the date December 11,\r\n   1883, “for the crime of having been managing editor of an\r\n   anarchist journal at the moment when an unknown person placed\r\n   a bomb in a dive where the swells amused themselves.”\r\n\r\nIt could not be better put. Cyvoct was in Switzerland at the time of the\r\nexplosion, and could not by any possibility have been the author of it.\r\nHe was not even the writer of the article which was held by the court to\r\nhave provoked the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe next year Gueslaff was condemned to ten years of hard labour for an\r\nattempt at Montceau-les-Mines, which he made at the instigation and\r\nunder the direction of a police agent.\r\n\r\nThree years later—to pass rapidly on—anarchists were sentenced for\r\nrevolutionary speeches at Laon. In 1890 Merlino, Malato, and Louise\r\nMichel were incarcerated on the same charge. There was an indiscriminate\r\nand purely preventive ingathering (_rafle_) of anarchists the 22d of\r\nApril, 1892, in prevision of the trial of Ravachol and the dreaded\r\ndemonstration of May 1, and another _rafle_, also indiscriminate and\r\npurely preventive, on the New Year’s Day preceding the execution of\r\nVaillant,—a measure which wrought untold injury—could governmental\r\nmalice or stupidity go farther?—to anarchist workingmen, and brought\r\nuntold suffering on their families, from the fact that it coincided with\r\nthe moment for the payment of the January rent (_terme_).[35] It was of\r\nthe former _rafle_, in which he was included, that the littérateur Zo\r\nd’Axa, in his piquant _De Mazas à Jérusalem_, wrote:—\r\n\r\n   “The police drag-net trick of this month of April, ‘92, will\r\n   become historic.\r\n\r\n   “It is the first in date among the most cynical assaults of\r\n   modern times upon liberty of thought.\r\n\r\n   “The true inwardness of the affair is now known.\r\n\r\n   “The government wished to profit by the emotion caused by the\r\n   explosions of the _Caserne Loban_ and the rue de Clichy to\r\n   encircle in a gigantic trial of tendency the militant\r\n   revolutionists. The ministry and its docile agents pretended\r\n   to believe that certain opinions constituted complicity. The\r\n   writer, explaining how the disinherited gravitate inevitably\r\n   towards theft, became, by the simple fact of this explanation,\r\n   a thief himself. The thinker, studying the wherefore of the\r\n   _propagande par le fait_, became the secret associate of the\r\n   lighters of tragic fuses. The philosopher had no right to\r\n   counsel indulgence and to view without giddiness the facts.\r\n\r\n   “Society must rid itself of those of its members who are so\r\n   corrupt as to desire it better....\r\n\r\n   “Evidently, the impartiality of the judges was not to be\r\n   counted on. The word of command had been passed along. It\r\n   would be useless to prove that not only we were not cut-purses\r\n   nor cut-throats, but that no organisation existed among us,\r\n   even from the political point of view. The tribunals would\r\n   sentence us with the same unconcern.\r\n\r\n   “A single point was doubtful. For the success of the manœuvre\r\n   it was indispensable that the other countries prosecute their\r\n   refractory citizens in the same fashion.\r\n\r\n   “Well, what the French Republic had premeditated, Holland,\r\n   England, and even Germany had the decency to be unwilling to\r\n   undertake. The venerable monarchies did not yield to the\r\n   solicitations of the young republic, which dreamed of\r\n   reconstituting in an inverse sense the _Internationale_. There\r\n   were parleyings to this end, but they came to nothing. The\r\n   hunt of the free man was not decreed by all Europe. Our fallen\r\n   democracy realised from that moment that she could not do\r\n   worse than the worst autocracies.... The order was given to\r\n   set us at large.\r\n\r\n   “The politico-judiciary machination had miscarried. All it had\r\n   been able to do was to hold us a month in jail, and gall our\r\n   wrists slightly with the infamous irons....\r\n\r\n   “In making arbitrary arrests, our masters, for all their\r\n   excitement, had no illusions. They knew very well that they\r\n   would be forced, in the end, to restore to liberty men against\r\n   whom not a single specific fact could be adduced; but they\r\n   said to themselves this, ‘Mazas will calm them!’ Now Mazas\r\n   calms nothing at all....\r\n\r\n   “It is just the opposite that happens. Deranged in their\r\n   habits, perturbed in their affairs, losing often their means\r\n   of subsistence, those who are victims of the provocative raids\r\n   go out of prison more rebellious than they entered it....\r\n\r\n   “The little ones are hungry in the house, the baker refuses\r\n   credit, the landlord threatens eviction, the employer has\r\n   given another the job.\r\n\r\n   “Rage mounts. It overflows. Some commit suicide by an overt\r\n   act; and, surely, the least sturdy take a step forward. The\r\n   timid grow bold. In the solitude of the cell logical thought\r\n   has gone back to causes, has deduced responsibilities.\r\n\r\n   “Ideas become clarified. The man who has been incarcerated for\r\n   the platonic crime of subversive social love learns hatred.”\r\n\r\nAmong other questionable repressive measures may be mentioned the famous\r\n“trial of the thirty” (_procès des trente_), embracing several of the\r\ntheoricians, dilettanti, and littérateurs which resulted, necessarily,\r\nin acquittal, but which left much bad feeling behind; the “trial of the\r\nforty” (_procès des quarante_); the condemnation of Zo d’Axa and his\r\nmanaging editor, Matha, to eighteen months of prison and a 3,000-franc\r\nfine; the expulsion of the littérateur Alexandre Cohen and the art\r\ncritic Félix Fénéon; in the winter of 1900-01—to pass over the\r\nintervening period—a long-drawn-out series of wholesale _rafles_ made,\r\nnominally, to suppress the bands of thieves and thugs who had grown\r\nnumerous and insolent during the comparative immunity of the preceding\r\nsummer, in reality quite as much to enable the police to locate anew the\r\n_camarades_ of whom they had lost track during their preoccupation with\r\nthe Exposition; countless perquisitions and preventive arrests\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of France just before the last visit\r\nof the czar; and in the spring of 1904 the turning over of Russian\r\nrefugees to the Russian police,—so many arbitrary and oppressive acts\r\nwhich will bear, if they have not already borne, their inevitable fruit\r\nof hatred and revolt.\r\n\r\nFor these superfluous persecutions of the anarchists it is sometimes the\r\npolice and sometimes the ministry that is responsible; which it is not\r\nalways easy to determine, owing to the close connection between the\r\nFrench national and the Paris municipal governments.\r\n\r\nIf it has never been conclusively proved that a ministry has gone to the\r\nextent of organising riotings[36] and bogus anarchist attempts (as\r\ncapitalists have been known to organise strike violence) in order to\r\nmaintain itself in power, to further a domestic project, bolster up a\r\nforeign policy, or win in advance the moral support of the community for\r\na contemplated rigorous suppression of free assembling and free speech,\r\nthere have been times, as is more than hinted at in Zola’s _Paris_, when\r\na ministry has been publicly accused and currently believed to have done\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Rochefort, who makes a specialty of launching\r\nsensational hypotheses,[37] the attempts of Vaillant and Salsou[38] (by\r\nwhich practically no damage was done) were prepared by the police,\r\nacting under government orders. These charges are not to be taken more\r\nseriously, of course, than others from the same charlatanical source.\r\nThey are, perhaps, their own best refutation. On the other hand, it has\r\nbeen proved over and over again that not only cabinet ministers, but\r\npoliticians in general, as well as financiers and journalists,—all\r\nthose, in a word, who “fish in troubled waters,”—sometimes act in\r\ncollusion with the police in turning street disturbances, even at the\r\nrisk of bloodshed, to their own selfish or partisan advantage.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as if it were not enough to be able to repose on laws of\r\nexception that belong logically to the worst monarchies, the government\r\nhas an unfortunate way of straining legality, ever and anon, even to the\r\nbreaking point.\r\n\r\nSuch governmental acts as the transference of papers taken from nihilist\r\nrefugees in Paris (1890) to the Russian authorities in order to enable\r\nthe Russian police to arrest nihilists living in Russia; the prohibition\r\nof the holding of the International Labour Congress (1900), which it\r\nwould have been so easy to suppress at the first really incendiary\r\nutterance; the extradition of the boy Sipido (the would-be assassin of\r\nthe then Prince of Wales), a proceeding of such doubtful legality that\r\nthe ministry responsible for it was censured by a vote of 306 to 206 in\r\nthe Chamber; the invasion of the _Bourse de Travail_ (1903) by the\r\npolice, an act which Premier Combes himself was obliged to denounce in\r\nthe Chamber; and the refusal of the Minister of Justice (1904) to\r\nrehabilitate Cyvoct, who adduced overwhelming proofs of his\r\ninnocence;—all these are fair samples of the far from edifying means\r\nthe authorities are constantly employing to secure respect for the law.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that the servant will be more scrupulous than\r\nthe master, and we long ago became accustomed to the idea that it takes\r\na knave to catch a knave. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to\r\nexperience a sensation of disgust at the vileness of some of the methods\r\nto which the police descend whenever anarchists are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe police chieftains exaggerate (if they do not deliberately aggravate)\r\nthe gravity of the public peril (as a wily physician might exaggerate\r\nthe gravity of an illness) in order to win from their ministers the\r\npraise and gratitude which mean for them enlarged brigades, increase of\r\nsecret funds, and individual promotion.\r\n\r\nThe rank and file of the police, feeling a similar necessity of making a\r\ngood showing with their immediate superiors, entrap anarchists into\r\nstreet disturbances or violations of the common law, and fabricate, with\r\nthe aid of false witnesses, fictitious crimes for the suspects on their\r\nlists who are not obliging enough to make incendiary speeches or commit\r\nviolence. They invade the privacy of their homes on the flimsiest\r\npretexts; slander them to their _compagnes_, their neighbours, and their\r\nfriends; poison the minds of their _concièrges_, their landlords, and\r\ntheir employers against them; in short, they render their lives\r\ngenerally unlivable by mean and meddling tricks.\r\n\r\nThis is no imaginative sketch,—so far from it that, if the police\r\nshould take it into their heads, during one of the anarchist flurries\r\nwhich occur periodically, to make a descent upon the lodgings of the\r\nwriter, who is anything but an anarchist, he would probably be\r\nimprisoned (or, at least, confined preventively) for the sole offence of\r\nhaving in his possession the numerous red-covered volumes, brochures,\r\ncaricatures, placards, and _chansons_ which he has found it necessary to\r\ncollect in the preparation of this book. If he were a Frenchman, he\r\nwould certainly have much difficulty in avoiding temporary confinement\r\nunder such circumstances. Being an American, he might escape with being\r\ncourteously, but strenuously, requested to cross the border.\r\n\r\nThis elaborate spy system, this shrewdness, chicanery, and, not to mince\r\nwords, villany on the part of the police, is, after all, more or less\r\nfutile. It serves no great purpose in the suppression of the _propagande\r\npar le fait_.\r\n\r\nIt is well enough for a police prefect to boast publicly, as did M.\r\nAndrieux, back in the eighties, of the ease with which he penetrates the\r\nmeetings of the groups, and recruits spies among the _camarades_,[39]\r\nand to shake his sides over the fine trick he plays on the _camarades_\r\nin conducting a journal[40] for them with funds provided by the state.\r\n\r\nSuch boasting and such self-gratulatory chuckling are well enough in\r\ntheir way; but they are rather idle in view of the looseness of\r\norganisation of the groups, which any one, if he dissemble ever so\r\nlittle, may frequent, and the insignificance and unreliability of the\r\ninformation obtained from such easily recruited spies. Besides, there is\r\na class of anarchists who become police spies, nominally, for the\r\nexpress purpose of leading the police astray by false information.\r\nControlling one journal is not controlling all, and a controlled journal\r\nis not less a propagandist force because the public money goes (however\r\nsecretly) to the making of it. M. Andrieux’s _La Révolution Sociale_ not\r\nonly preached anarchy, but preached it (here the police\r\nshort-sightedness appears) very effectively. It converted some of those\r\nwho have since become the most feared of militant propagandists, and\r\ngoaded certain of the previously converted into action.\r\n\r\nOvert acts are seldom, if ever, arranged in the groups. Vaillant did\r\nnot breathe a word of his projected attempt against the Chamber of\r\nDeputies to his group of Choisy-le-Roi. It is the exception rather than\r\nthe rule when a really dangerous character is an assiduous frequenter of\r\nthe groups; and, if he is, he does not often take the group members into\r\nhis confidence. The “conspiracy” which is bruited about at every fresh\r\nanarchist attempt is rarely proved in France, for the very good reason\r\nthat in France it rarely exists outside of the excited imagination of\r\nthe frightened public and the professional suspiciousness of the\r\ndetective and judge. “Why will they prate of plots?” says Zo d’Axa.\r\n“There is something better. There is an idea which is alive and stirs,\r\nand which is making its way on every hand.”\r\n\r\nIt is well enough, again, for the anthropometric expert, M. Bertillon\r\n(since it seems to amuse him), to enrich his criminal museum with\r\nphotographs, relics, and statistics of the militant and non-militant\r\nanarchists who are brought his way by the police _rafles_; but what,\r\nafter all, does it profit him to know the “bigness of the skull, the\r\nstanding height, the sitting height, the size of the right ear and the\r\nleft foot,” so that “he has no instrument to register,” to borrow Zo\r\nd’Axa’s pregnant phrase, “the significance of a shoulder-shrug”?\r\n\r\nThe police may plume themselves on knowing the anarchists’ resorts,\r\nfaces, and aliases, and their tricks of cipher and invisible ink. But\r\nthis police knowledge of the anarchists is offset by the anarchists’\r\nknowledge of the police.[41] It is diamond cut diamond in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 a café garçon, acting on a wager, mounted the step of President\r\nLoubet’s state carriage, and dropped in the president’s lap a mysterious\r\nbundle which contained a photograph of the garçon’s little daughter. The\r\nbundle might as easily have contained a bomb, and all Paris shuddered.\r\n\r\nAfter the great _rafle_ of April, 1892, this same M. Loubet (then a\r\nminister), relying on the assurance of the police, proclaimed to the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ that they might sleep in peace for a time, since all the\r\ndangerous anarchists were under lock and key. Four days later the Véry\r\nrestaurant was dynamited precisely as it had been predicted that it\r\nwould be, whence arose, as the _Père Peinard_ exultantly and maliciously\r\nremarked at the time, “a new and capital word, _Véryfication_.”\r\n\r\nSomebody’s shoulder-shrug had not been taken account of.\r\n\r\nThe police expert knowledge of the anarchists, much as it is vaunted,\r\nhas not sufficed to prevent numerous overt anarchist acts in the\r\nimmediate past; and there is little reason to believe it can prevent the\r\nnext overt act to which a resolute man may make up his mind.\r\n\r\nIn carefully guarding dynamite from theft, the French police have\r\nrendered a real service to the public safety. But until the revolver and\r\nthe poniard, which are surer than dynamite of their chosen victims, can\r\nbe submitted to a similar control, the greatest service the police can\r\nrender against the _propagande par le fait_ would seem to be the purely\r\nnegative one of not exasperating anarchists indiscriminately and\r\nunnecessarily, and of not brutally crowding them to the wall.\r\n\r\nThe injustice of courts, the deceitfulness of ministries, the corruption\r\nof parliament, and the unscrupulousness of the police, as well as the\r\ninequalities of society, are important factors in the formation of the\r\n“_catastrophards_,” or propagandists _par le fait_. But they all become\r\ninsignificant before the passion for martyrdom, which has always, in\r\nsome form or other, possessed a minority of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe French propagandists _par le fait_, from Ravachol to Baumann,[42]\r\nmay have grievously deluded themselves; but they have unquestionably\r\nbelieved themselves to be apostles honoured in being set apart for\r\nmartyrdom.\r\n\r\nThe _stigmata_ are many and unmistakable. They have had the singleness\r\nof purpose and the merciless logic of zealots. They have preached in\r\nseason and out of season,[43] before judges, in prisons, and at the\r\nguillotine. They have consecrated the time allotted for their own\r\ndefence to the defence of anarchist tenets, have accepted advocates\r\nunder protest, and have refused to sign requests for the commutation of\r\ntheir sentences. They have borne the odium of deeds of which they were\r\nnot guilty, because they thereby secured a pulpit for their preaching,\r\nand left the real authors free to operate. They have held it sweet to\r\ndie for the faith. They have displayed, in the awful presence of the\r\nknife, the trance-like ecstasy of the illuminate.\r\n\r\nIn Part I. of his powerful two-part drama, _Au-dessus des Forces\r\nHumaines_, the hero of which is a dynamiter, the great-minded Norseman,\r\nBjörnson, has emphasised this fact, that it is among the propagandists\r\n_par le fait_ of anarchy that we must look for the modern martyrs, for\r\nthe men who witness their faith with their blood, who sacrifice\r\nthemselves unreservedly for their fellow-men, who welcome death with\r\nsmiles and outstretched arms because they are confident that their\r\nmartyrdom will usher in the redemption of mankind.\r\n\r\nZola and a host of lesser literary lights have been emphasising the same\r\nfact in France.\r\n\r\n   “I know Vaillant,” says one of the characters of Victor\r\n   Barrucand’s novel _Avec le Feu_. “He is afflicted with a\r\n   hypertrophy of the sentiments. He believes in nature, in\r\n   humanity, in justice. He hopes for the reign of the entities.\r\n   He is the embodiment of disinterestedness. He wanted to act.\r\n   Like a brave bull, he charged the imaginary obstacle.... He is\r\n   sincere, he carries his faith like a torch, he would set the\r\n   world on fire by way of persuasion.... He is generous,\r\n   sanguine, sentimental,—the typical French revolutionist.”\r\n\r\nAnd of Emile Henry, author of the explosion of the _Café Terminus_, Zo\r\nd’Axa writes:—\r\n\r\n   “I hear him still, little more than a child, but already\r\n   grave, self-centred, and close-mouthed, sectarian even, as all\r\n   those forcibly become whose faith is troubled by no doubts,\r\n   those who see—hypnotised, may I say?—the end, and then reason,\r\n   judge, and decide with mathematical implacability. He believed\r\n   firmly in the advent of a future society, logically\r\n   constructed and harmoniously beautiful. What he reproached me\r\n   for was not counting enough on the regeneration of the race,\r\n   not referring everything to the ideal standard of anarchy.\r\n   Apparent contradictions shocked his logical sense. He was\r\n   astounded that any one who came to realise the baseness of an\r\n   epoch could continue to take any pleasure therein.”\r\n\r\nThe ferociousness of the self-styled conservators, who made it their\r\nbusiness to hang and burn witches, engendered the morbid exaltation that\r\nmade inoffensive, impressionable people accuse themselves of being\r\nwitches. The logical and inevitable counterpart of a Saul of Tarsus\r\nbreathing threatenings and slaughter is a Stephen beholding the heavens\r\nopened. It has always been so, and probably always will be.\r\n\r\n“The guillotine is the nimbus of the saints of this new religion,”\r\nwrites Félix Dubois, a declared opponent of anarchy, in _Le Péril\r\nAnarchiste_; and this revised version of the venerable proverb, “The\r\nblood of the martyrs is the seed of the church,” _donne à penser_. It\r\nmakes one query whether the fanaticism of this latter-day sect has not\r\nbeen inflamed rather than allayed by every anarchist head that has\r\nfallen. Fancy the feelings of a fervent, conscientious anarchist\r\nassisting at the public decapitation of one of his coreligionists. Zola\r\nhas described in unforgettable pages the entry of the contagion of\r\nmartyrdom into the system of his sincere, learned, and great-souled\r\nanarchist character, Guillaume Froment, at the execution of Froment’s\r\nprotégé:—\r\n\r\n   “Ah! the dumb stroke, the heavy shock of the knife! Guillaume\r\n   heard it penetrate far into this quarter of want and work,\r\n   heard it resound in the inmost recesses of the wretched\r\n   lodgings, where, at this hour, thousands of workers were\r\n   rising for the hard labour of the day. It took on there a\r\n   formidable meaning. It told the exasperation of injustice, the\r\n   madness of martyrdom, the agonising hope that the blood shed\r\n   would hasten the victory of the disinherited.”\r\n\r\nSo long as the guillotining of the anarchists is as dispassionate as\r\nthat of other killers of their kind, the guillotined are exalted into\r\nmartyrs by their coreligionists alone. But when, as in the case of\r\nVaillant, who had destroyed no life, the evident purpose of the courts\r\nis to wreak vengeance, not to deal justice, and when legal forms are\r\nstretched, if not completely snapped, by the weight of popular prejudice\r\nand passion with its old, old cry of “Crucify, crucify!” then, not only\r\nthe sectaries of anarchy, but revolutionists of every shade, and all\r\nthose who, while not revolutionists, are not quite ready to subscribe to\r\nthe formula that society, like the king, “can do no wrong,” are pained\r\nand shocked. These last add, unconsciously perhaps, several rays to the\r\nhalos of martyrdom about the heads of the anarchist thus wronged; and\r\nthe cause of a single tiny sect is confounded for the time being with\r\nthe cause of the oppressed at large.\r\n\r\nThe apotheosis of Vaillant is one of the most significant phenomena of\r\nmodern times. His fate was sincerely and widely deplored in literary and\r\nartistic circles and by reputable contributors (if not by editors) in\r\neven the capitalistic press.\r\n\r\nThe spontaneous public pilgrimage to his burial-place, the Champ de\r\nNavets, took the police so completely by surprise that they were not\r\nprepared to arrest it. A stone, inscribed “_Labor improbus omnia\r\nvincit_,” was hastily erected over his grave while its guardians were at\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was midwinter, bunches of fresh flowers were fairly showered\r\nupon the mound. These and the wreaths of immortelles and artificial\r\nflowers, which the French so much affect as funeral tributes, were\r\nnearly all accompanied by striking legends. A significant one of these\r\nread: “Glory to thee who wast great. I am only a child, but I will\r\navenge thee.” There was also a symbolic crown of thorns.\r\n\r\nThe scenes that were enacted over this anarchist grave were of a\r\npoignant, mystic, almost uncanny intensity.\r\n\r\nAn aged man raised a babe above the heads of the crowd, and said\r\nimpressively, “Behold the tomb of the martyr!”\r\n\r\nA labourer lifted his voice to utter five simple terrible words,\r\n“Vaillant, thou shalt be avenged.”\r\n\r\nA blind man declaimed: “In its lethargy the people is like a person\r\nburied alive. It wakes sometimes in the night of the tomb, and\r\nconvulsively strains to break the planks of its coffin. From the depths\r\nof darkness I have heard thy cry of rage and of despair, O Vaillant!\r\nThou hast threatened the powerful, those who live on the people and\r\nserve them not. Thy arm was raised, but thou wast thine only victim; and\r\nnow earth fills thy mouth. Alas!”\r\n\r\nA poet recited,—\r\n\r\n   “_Un ciel boueux taché de sang, c’était l’aurore,\r\n     La vieille aurore avec ses roses de festin,\r\n     Qui se levait honteuse à l’appel du destin\r\n     Pour éclairer des yeux que la mort allait clore._”\r\n\r\nAnother poet intoned,—\r\n\r\n   “_Que ton souffle se mêle à la création,\r\n     Que la rosée de ton sacrifice mouille nos âmes stériles,\r\n     Que ton exemple unique soit comme l’eau d’un seule nuage\r\n     Qui fait germer toutes les plantes dans la forêt!_”\r\n\r\nA ragged snail-gatherer led the crowd to the spot (a hollow against the\r\nwall) where a basket of the clotted blood that had flowed from the\r\nsevered head had been hidden. Men, women, and children knotted lumps of\r\nthe ensanguined sawdust in their handkerchiefs and besmeared their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nA fierce handbill, “_A Carnot le Tueur_,” was distributed broadcast. Two\r\nred flags were planted on the grave, and a black flag was unfurled,\r\nbearing the inscription, “_Vive la Mort!_”\r\n\r\nOn every anniversary of Vaillant’s death, unless the police interfere,\r\nsimilar scenes are enacted in the Champ de Navets; and in these weird,\r\ncommemorative rites the dead man’s little daughter, Sidonie, who was\r\nadopted by the _camarades_, plays a spectacular part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET RIOT]\r\n\r\nThe anniversary of the death of Ravachol is celebrated by a pilgrimage\r\nof the faithful to the tomb of Diderot, who is regarded as a precursor\r\nof anarchism (Montbrison, where Ravachol is buried, being too far away\r\nfor Parisians); and every anniversary of the deaths of those who have\r\ndied for the cause and every funeral of a _camarade_ is made a pretext\r\nfor keeping alive the morbid cult. But the great saint day of the French\r\nanarchist calendar is the 11th of November, the anniversary of the\r\nanarchist executions at Chicago.\r\n\r\nAll anarchistic (one might almost say all revolutionary) Europe honestly\r\nbelieves—whether rightly or wrongly history has yet, perhaps, to\r\ndecide—that the Chicago hanging was as flagrant a violation of human\r\nrights, and the preceding trial as disgraceful a travesty of justice, as\r\nthe worst absolute monarchy has ever had the audacity to perpetrate.\r\nWhatever the influence of this dramatic execution may have been in\r\nAmerica, it was highly inflammatory in Europe. Under a practically free\r\nimmigration system, America will be indeed fortunate if she does not,\r\nsooner or later, import long-stored-up rancour, originating from this\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of Europe, as in France; in Russia, Germany, and Austria, in\r\nItaly and Spain, the violent anarchist acts of the last twenty-five\r\nyears have been, broadly speaking, so many reprisals for real or fancied\r\ninjuries suffered at the hands of government or society.\r\n\r\nIt is as nearly proved as a thing that is not susceptible of\r\nmathematical proof well can be that the almost complete immunity of\r\nEngland from anarchist violence (the Fenian attempts can hardly be so\r\nclassed) has been due, in part at least, to the relative liberty of\r\nspeech, press, and assemblage she has accorded,—accorded with an almost\r\nheroic consistency, in view of the pressure European governments have\r\nbrought to bear upon her to change her policy. And it is surely\r\nsomething other than mere chance that so large a proportion of the\r\npropagandists _par le fait_ hail from Italy. The unconcerned fashion in\r\nwhich the Italian peasants and labourers—at Milan, at Carrara, in\r\nSicily—have been given cold lead when they have had the effrontery to\r\nask for bread, and the mediæval tortures, a hundred times worse than\r\ndeath, inflicted on Passanante[44] and his successors, under the\r\nhypocritical guise of clemency and humanity, have acted naturally enough\r\nas provocations toward anarchism rather than restraints against it.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the fate which awaited Bresci appeared in the\r\nParis _Matin_ immediately after his condemnation had been pronounced:—\r\n\r\n   “The penalty of imprisonment for life which has fallen upon\r\n   Bresci is very rigorous, and will be aggravated by solitary\r\n   confinement day and night.\r\n\r\n   “The condemned man will probably be taken to the _bagne_ of\r\n   St. Etienne, where he will be clothed in the black and yellow\r\n   striped prison uniform. During the first years he will occupy\r\n   a cell two and a half metres long and one metre wide, which\r\n   has never more than a half-light. Later he will be transferred\r\n   to a cell a little larger and fully lighted. A table, slightly\r\n   inclined, half a metre wide, will serve him for bed and\r\n   furniture. His food will be bread and water once a day only.\r\n   The jailers will hand it in to him through a hole covered with\r\n   coloured glass, which permits them to see the prisoner without\r\n   being seen by him.\r\n\r\n   “The days must pass in absolute silence. The punishments which\r\n   threaten the prisoner who does not submit to this terrible\r\n   régime are: I. The “strait-jacket” (_chemise de force_). II.\r\n   Irons which bind the hands to the feet, holding the body bent\r\n   forward. III. The _lit de force_, a wooden box exactly like a\r\n   coffin, pierced at the lower end with two holes for the feet.\r\n   The legs cannot be moved, and the arms are held motionless by\r\n   the _chemise de force_.\r\n\r\n   “After ten years of this régime the prisoner is allowed to\r\n   work during the day; but at night he returns to isolation and\r\n   silence. Neither visits nor letters—nothing—can penetrate\r\n   this tomb till the day when death or madness comes to deliver\r\n   him who inhabits it.”\r\n\r\nThe above is given for what it is worth without a guarantee of the\r\nstrict accuracy of every detail. But the _Matin_ is not a revolutionary\r\nsheet, and would seem to have no good reason for misrepresentation. If\r\nonly one-half of what it reveals is true, the crime of the Italian\r\ngovernment will seem to many more heinous than the worst thing the\r\nanarchists have ever done or been accused of doing. No wonder Bresci\r\ncontrived to put himself out of the way before a year had elapsed, and\r\nlittle wonder that the friends of Bresci have threatened reprisals.\r\n\r\nThe folly of taking official cognisance of the expression of incendiary\r\nviews was signally demonstrated at the time of the last visit of the\r\nczar to France, when the poet Laurent Tailhade was sentenced to a year\r\nof prison and a 1,000-franc fine for a prose-poem glorifying regicide,\r\npublished in _Le Libertaire_. This article would have been seen, had the\r\nauthorities but had the tact to ignore it, only by the few regular\r\nreaders of _Le Libertaire_, and would have been _read through_, it is\r\nsafe to say, only by a small and unexcitable minority of these; for M.\r\nTailhade is characterised by a style that is incomprehensible, save to\r\nthe _lettrés_. But the author must needs be haled into court;[45] and,\r\npresto! Paris and the provinces are in an uproar. Well-known literary\r\nand artistic personalities—Zola, Gustave Kahn, Frantz Jourdain, E.\r\nLedrain, and Jean Marestan among them—testify for their brother\r\ncraftsman in person, and Mirbeau, De Hérédia, and Anatole France by\r\nletter. The auditors applaud the culprit’s utterances, bear him away,\r\nafter the announcement of the verdict, in triumph, and hold banquets in\r\nhis honour. The dangerous article, or at least its incriminated\r\npassages, and the proceedings of the court are published, in spite of\r\nthe fact that such publication is expressly forbidden by law, throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of France; and all the papers teem with\r\n_chroniques_, leading articles, and skits upon Tailhade or anarchism.\r\nIndignation meetings are held in every corner of Paris, and resolutions\r\nof protest are passed by socialists, free thinkers, and simple\r\nrepublicans, and even by Masonic lodges.\r\n\r\nThe obscure _Libertaire_ is given an enormous quantity of free\r\nadvertising, the anarchist propaganda is carried on by its enemies, and\r\na martyr is made of a man with no special vocation for martyrdom. To be\r\nsure, the offender is in durance for a twelve-month, but he is not\r\nsilent; and nobody is deterred from following his example. A clearer\r\ninstance of making a mountain out of a molehill it would be hard to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Guillotine in Moonlight ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTER OF THE PROPAGANDIST “PAR LE FAIT”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Give the devil his due._”—Popular proverb.\r\n\r\n   “_He rose at five, and read until the work hour. His shop\r\n   associates, knowing him sincere, generous, incapable of\r\n   platitude, did not detest him in spite of his unsociable\r\n   ways._”—J.-H. ROSNY, in Le Bilatéral.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Granted, the ship comes into harbour with shrouds and tackle\r\n   damaged; the pilot is blameworthy; he has not been all-wise\r\n   and all-powerful: but to know how blameworthy, tell us first\r\n   whether his voyage has been round the globe or only to\r\n   Ramsgate and the Isle of Dogs._”—THOMAS CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_J’ai regardé le juge en face.\r\n     Certain d’abord d’être pendu,\r\n     Je ne me suis pas défendu.\r\n     A quoi bon mendier sa grâce!\r\n     Le cuir est fait pour le tanner;\r\n     Le code est fait pour condamner.\r\n     J’ai regardé le juge en face._”\r\n\r\n    MAURICE BOUKAY, in Chansons Rouges.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first anarchist I ever knew in any country was a dear, grandfatherly\r\nAmerican workingman in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who conducted me, the\r\nSunday following our chance meeting, to an ethical culture society in\r\nDorchester on purpose to show me how children should be taught to be\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe second was a young doctor of philosophy, dreaded by reputable Boston\r\nfor his well-documented _sans-gêne_, who chanced to be rusticating on a\r\nfarm where I spent ten days with a gang of a dozen city street boys. I\r\nfound him infinitely gentle and kind; and it was he of all the farm\r\nhousehold who came to relieve me one night while I was keeping an\r\nanxious bedside vigil beside one of the boys, who had received an\r\naccidental injury to the head that threatened to prove dangerous.\r\n\r\nThese my first two experiences with anarchist types were scarcely of a\r\nnature to dismay me, nor have I ever found anything dismaying in the\r\nprivate characters of the anarchists I have since known in the Old\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nIn an every way remarkable study of the anarchist temperament, based on\r\na thorough investigation of anarchists of many professions and all\r\nstations in life, A. Hamon, author of _La France Sociale et Politique_\r\nand _Une Psychologie du Militaire Professionnel_, has arrived at these\r\nsuggestive conclusions:—\r\n\r\n   “The positive method confirmed by the rational method enables\r\n   us to establish an ideal type of anarchist whose mentality is\r\n   the aggregate of common psychic characteristics. Every\r\n   anarchist partakes sufficiently of this ideal type to make it\r\n   possible to differentiate him from other men. The typical\r\n   anarchist, then, may be defined as follows: a man perceptibly\r\n   affected by the spirit of revolt under one or more of its\r\n   forms,—opposition, investigation, criticism,\r\n   innovation,—endowed with a strong love of liberty, egoistic,\r\n   or individualistic, and possessed of great curiosity,—a keen\r\n   desire to know. These traits are supplemented by an ardent\r\n   love of others, a highly developed moral sensitiveness, a\r\n   profound sentiment of justice, an alert logical faculty, and\r\n   pronounced combative tendencies.\r\n\r\n   “Such is the average psychic type of the anarchist. He is, to\r\n   summarise, a person rebellious, liberty-loving, at once\r\n   individualistic and altruistic, enamoured of justice, and\r\n   imbued with missionary zeal.”\r\n\r\nTo these conclusions every one who has been privileged to know well any\r\nnumber of anarchists will be likely to subscribe. And, if M. Hamon,\r\ninstead of extending his investigations to all sorts and conditions of\r\nanarchists, had limited them to the propagandists _par le fait_, his\r\nconclusions would not have been essentially different. He would probably\r\nhave felt constrained to admit that the “ardent love of others” and the\r\n“profound sentiment of justice” were curiously blended with petty\r\ncravings for notoriety or large desires for glory; the “missionary\r\nzeal,” with a reticence amounting to mystification about matters of\r\npurely personal concern or projects of violence; and the “highly\r\ndeveloped moral sensitiveness,” with a seemingly contradictory moral\r\ncallousness regarding the means permissible to attain an end. But, on\r\nthe other hand, M. Hamon would surely have added these sterling\r\nqualities: a rare love of animals, surpassing sweetness in all the\r\nordinary relations of life, exceptional sobriety of demeanour, frugality\r\nand regularity, austerity even, of living, and courage beyond compare.\r\n\r\nRavachol, the most difficult of all the French propagandists _par le\r\nfait_ to comprehend, Ravachol who never allowed (no more than a great\r\nfinancier might) a sentiment of humanity to interpose when the success\r\nof a plan was at stake, who never showed a gleam of remorse for his\r\nmurder of the miser hermit of Chambles and the pillaging for jewels of\r\nthe tomb of the Marquise de la Rochetaille,[46]—Ravachol was by the\r\ntestimony of all who knew him well, even his enemies, an unusually\r\nkind-hearted man where the Cause—I had almost said where politics—was\r\nnot concerned. In his young manhood he supported his mother and younger\r\nbrother, and treated them with the greatest consideration. He was fond\r\nof children, and remonstrated fiercely against cruelty to animals. The\r\npresiding judge tried in vain to wrest from the little son of Ravachol’s\r\n_compagne_ some hint of brutality on Ravachol’s part. “_Il était très\r\ndoux avec maman et avec moi_” was all the boy could be got to say; and\r\nthe only time Ravachol broke down during his detention and trial was at\r\nthe sight of this little one. Chaumartin, who had betrayed Ravachol from\r\nfear or some baser motive, said on the witness-stand, “He taught my\r\nlittle children to read, and cut out pictures for them”; and Ravachol\r\nforgave this same Chaumartin his baseness in open court.\r\n\r\nOnly a short time before the explosion of the rue de Clichy, Ravachol\r\nescorted to a shoe store a pitiable beggar girl he had chanced upon in\r\nthe street, and saw her provided with a new pair of shoes, for which he\r\npaid seven francs.\r\n\r\nThe charities and compassions of Pini, and Duval’s more than platonic\r\nsolicitude for the welfare of working-women, have been previously noted.\r\n\r\nDecamp, though he earned barely fr. 2.50 per day, and had a wife and\r\nthree children to provide for, adopted a homeless six-year-old child to\r\nsave it from vagabondage.\r\n\r\nFaugoux, who was given twenty years of hard labour for stealing\r\ndynamite, wrote to a _camarade_ regarding the damaging testimony of one\r\nDrouet:—\r\n\r\n   “As to Drouet, I pardon him his want of frankness regarding\r\n   me. He has little instruction, and he hoped in this way to\r\n   save himself from the law. This _compagnon_, although\r\n   convinced, has much sentiment for his family; and this is a\r\n   powerful motive. When he thought of the struggle and the\r\n   misery which his wife and child would have to support, he\r\n   forgot that he was an anarchist. Let us not lay it up against\r\n   him nor refuse him our hands.”\r\n\r\nSalsou adored, as he was adored by, his father and mother and his\r\nseveral brothers and sisters. He wrote them often in the years after he\r\nleft home for the _trimard_; and his letters were replete with\r\naffection, notably one in which he acknowledged the photograph of his\r\nmother and two of the children, Martha and Henri, playfully calling the\r\nlast named “Henricon.” His _compagne_ had no complaint to make of his\r\ntreatment of her, and even his laundress testified to his being\r\ncourteous and kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUISE MICHEL]\r\n\r\nReader’s of Zola’s _Germinal_ will remember the anarchist Souvarine’s\r\naffection for the pet rabbit, Pologne, and his sorrow at her death. The\r\npoint is well observed. Nearly every French anarchist, whether\r\npropagandist _par le fait_ or not, is a defender of the rights of all\r\nfour-footed things; and many are strict vegetarians. In her fascinating\r\nautobiography, Louise Michel returns again and again with flaming wrath\r\nto the sufferings of domestic animals.\r\n\r\n   “Under my revolt against the strong,” she says, “I find,\r\n   farther back than I can remember distinctly, a horror of the\r\n   tortures inflicted on dumb beasts. I would have liked to see\r\n   the animal defend himself,—the dog bite the one who abused\r\n   him, the horse, bleeding under the lash, trample on his\r\n   torturer. But always the dumb beast endures his lot with the\r\n   resignation of the subdued races. What an object of pity is\r\n   the beast!”\r\n\r\nThis typical anarchist trait is graphically illustrated by the following\r\nanecdote related by Flor O’Squarr:—\r\n\r\n   “One day in July I stopped before a book-stall of the rue\r\n   Châteaudun, close by the rue Laffitte, when I was joined by an\r\n   anarchist who led me before the show window of a bird dealer a\r\n   few steps away. There, with a hand that shook, he pointed out\r\n   to me some white mice shut up in tiny iron cages that were\r\n   provided with squirrels’ wheels, whereon the little beasts\r\n   galloped without respite.\r\n\r\n   “‘See there,’ moaned the dynamiter, ‘tell me if men are not\r\n   villains! These poor white mice, so delicate, so pretty,\r\n   suffer frightfully, don’t you know it, churning like that in\r\n   this instrument of torture. It gives them nausea and pains in\r\n   the stomach.’ He would have strangled the dealer without\r\n   remorse to avenge the mice.”\r\n\r\nZola, in his account of the trial of the dynamiter Salvat (_Paris_),\r\nmakes the culprit’s fellow-workmen testify that he was “a worthy man, an\r\nintelligent, diligent, and highly temperate workman, who adored his\r\nlittle daughter, and who was incapable of an indelicacy or meanness”;\r\nand this characterisation of a bomb-thrower of fiction might be applied\r\nwith little change to almost every real bomb-thrower who has operated in\r\nFrance. Scarcely one appears to have been—the _propagande_ apart—what\r\nwe call a “bad egg” and the French call a “_mauvais sujet_” or to have\r\nhad a bad disposition. There is scarcely a drunkard, a gambler, a\r\nlibertine, or a domestic tyrant, in the lot. Indeed, they have had so\r\nfew of the vices of genius that one almost sighs over their essential\r\ncommonplaceness.\r\n\r\nThey have nearly all been highly abstemious and nearly all great\r\nreaders. Pini’s living expenses averaged less than three francs a day,\r\nand were no more after a successful theft than before,—the best\r\npossible proof that he was not given to reckless dissipation.\r\n\r\nRavachol spent somewhat more than Pini,—seven or eight francs a day, on\r\nan average,—but was no hard liver. Philip, one of the French authors of\r\nthe explosion at Liège (spring of 1904), devoted a legacy to the cause.\r\nBaumann educated himself in evening schools after reaching manhood.\r\nSalsou, who had read the _Révolution Sociale_ of Proudhon at fifteen,\r\ndevoted a good part of his earnings to the purchase of journals and\r\nbooks. He paid from four to seven francs a week for his lodgings, and\r\nlived in other respects accordingly. Potatoes and onions “were the chief\r\nof his diet.” He left his room regularly about seven in the morning,\r\nreturned about the same hour at night, and went out very little evenings\r\neven to the group meetings, preferring to stay at home and read till a\r\nlate hour. In fact, the only things his associates found to reproach him\r\nfor were his over-seriousness and his taciturnity.\r\n\r\n   “He was an honest, laborious, sober man,” testified his\r\n   employer at his trial, “and ever ready to do a favour, but\r\n   very much shut up in himself,—not in the least communicative.\r\n   He passed for a scholar.” Whereupon Salsou, referring to his\r\n   condemnation at Fontainebleau for having talked of his faith,\r\n   retorted, “If they reproach me with being uncommunicative, it\r\n   is because I know what it costs to be communicative.”\r\n\r\n   “The aim of the press,” said Zola, apropos of the public\r\n   reception of Salvat’s attempt (_Paris_), “seemed to be to\r\n   besmirch Salvat, in order, in his person, to degrade anarchy;\r\n   and his life was made out to be one long abomination.... His\r\n   faults, magnified, were paraded without the causes that had\r\n   produced them, and without the excuse of the environment which\r\n   had aggravated them. What a revolt of humanity and justice\r\n   there was in the soul of Froment, who knew the true\r\n   Salvat,—Salvat, the tender mystic, the chimerical and\r\n   passionate spirit, thrown into life without defence, always\r\n   weighted down and exasperated by implacable poverty, and\r\n   finding his account at last in this dream of restoring the\r\n   golden age by destroying the old world!”\r\n\r\nWhenever a fresh anarchist trial occurs in France, this inglorious farce\r\nof press vilification is re-enacted. Not content with heaping on the\r\nculprit’s head all the misdemeanours of which he has been guilty and\r\nmany crimes of which he has not been guilty, the bourgeois organs try to\r\nstrip him of his one incontrovertible attribute,—courage. They\r\ndare—knowing him well under lock and key—to call him “coward.”\r\n\r\nNo, my respectable, quaking bourgeois, not that! Robber, murderer,\r\nincendiary, fornicator, what you will (if you must judge by your rule of\r\nthumb), but not coward! It is too much! You cannot deny the dynamiter\r\nwhat you concede to the vilest criminals and even to the beast of the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nDuval all but killed the police brigadier Rossignol, who attempted to\r\narrest him. For the judge who tried to worm out of him proofs of the\r\nexistence of accomplices, he had this fine epigram: “_Vous n’aurez ma\r\nlangue qu’avec ma tête_.” Condemned to death, he refused to sign a\r\npetition for clemency. The innocent Cyvoct, under sentence of death,\r\nalso refused to sue for pardon.\r\n\r\nTwo officers were wounded before Francis[47] could be secured on the\r\nBoulevard de Strasbourg, and it took four officers to hold\r\nParmeggiani.[48]\r\n\r\nPini had to be lassooed in the heart of Paris like a buffalo of the\r\nplains, and it was only when wounded that he could be retaken after his\r\nescape from Cayenne.\r\n\r\nLorion, advertised everywhere by the police for an incendiary speech at\r\nRoubaix (immediately after his release from a five years’ imprisonment),\r\nopenly led a band to the sack of the office of a Lille newspaper which\r\nhad treated him as a police spy, and then made good his escape to Havre;\r\nbut, determined to purge away the last vestige of the charge against\r\nhim, he returned to the region of Lille, and wounded two officers before\r\nhe could be taken.\r\n\r\nDecamp defended himself, after his cartridges were finished and his\r\nknife gone, with a bayonet,—which he succeeded in wresting from one of\r\nhis assailants,—until he swooned from loss of blood. In court he\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n   “You can guillotine me. I prefer it. I have had enough of your\r\n   prisons and your _bagnes_. Off with my head! I do not defend\r\n   it. I deliver it, shouting, ‘_Vive l’Anarchie!_’ What does\r\n   one _camarade’s_ head more or less amount to, if only our\r\n   beautiful Hope spreads!”\r\n\r\nBaumann constituted himself a prisoner, and demanded the guillotine.\r\nEtievant wrote from London a little while before his attempt:—\r\n\r\n   “We are here in large numbers, the proscribed of all\r\n   countries, convinced of the final triumph of Liberty, having\r\n   made great sacrifices already for the Idea, and fortifying\r\n   ourselves with the hope of rendering service to poor humanity\r\n   which has limped along painfully for so many centuries; and\r\n   yet I begin to doubt that we have done everything that we\r\n   might have done and in consequence everything that we should\r\n   have done. Would it not have been better to struggle even unto\r\n   death there where the hazard of birth had placed us? Rather\r\n   than to flee precipitately before the threats and the blows of\r\n   authority, would it not have been better to make the sacrifice\r\n   of our lives?” By deliberately returning to Paris, Etievant\r\n   answered his own question in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nHenry, whose attitude in court was that of a pontiff, “defended himself\r\nin the street like a little lion,” says Barrucand. “He resisted till he\r\nwas at the very end of his forces, even under the heels of the police.\r\nFlippant, ferocious, he mocked the officers, said that he had just\r\narrived from Pekin, and would not give his name.”\r\n\r\nVaillant denounced himself when he stood a fair chance of escape, and\r\nbore himself proudly before his judges and before the guillotine.\r\n\r\nRavachol, king of cynics, risked discovery in passing the _octroi_ (city\r\nrevenue office) with dynamite in his satchel; walked long distances on\r\nfoot and rode in jolting omnibuses while carrying materials that the\r\nslightest shock might explode; showed himself after each of his attempts\r\nwith an appalling indifference to recognition; defended himself superbly\r\nbefore the Véry restaurant, whither he had returned for no other\r\napparent purpose than to finish the conversion of the garçon L’Hérot,\r\nwhom he had found sympathetically inclined a fortnight before; advanced\r\nto the guillotine (though bound in a painful and ignoble fashion)\r\nsinging the most blasphemous and defiant of all the stanzas of the\r\nvenerable _Père Duchêne_;[49] hurled in the teeth of Deibler, the\r\nheadsman, the epithet, “_Cochon!_” and, as the knife fell, cried “_Vive\r\nla Ré_”—The word was never finished. Some of the bourgeois papers,\r\ndetermined to deprive Ravachol of the cynical grandeur of his death by\r\nmaking him out a retractor, claimed the unfinished word to be\r\n_République_ instead of _Révolution_.\r\n\r\nIt is the petty work of little men to call a man a coward who can die\r\nlike this. A consummate villain,—yes, judged by conventional\r\nstandards,—but no coward.\r\n\r\nThe man who dies like a man—and let it not be forgotten there are a\r\nhundred and one ways of doing it—is to be admired for that, whether he\r\nbe called John Huss or John Brown, Saint Stephen or Saint Jean\r\nNépomucène, Charles I. or Louis XVI., Raleigh or Ravachol, Petronius\r\nArbiter or Louis Lingg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANNIVERSARY DECORATIONS, MUR DES FÉDÉRÉS]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   “_He [Ravachol] endured everything without a murmur, all the\r\n   pain and all the punishment, because, in the sombre heaven to\r\n   which his criminal reveries mounted, he had seen his chimera\r\n   pass, because he believed himself an apostle._”—FLOR O’SQUARR,\r\n   in Les Coulisses de l’Anarchie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSOCIALISTS AND OTHER REVOLUTIONISTS\r\n\r\n   “_If the spirit of revolt is an essential part of the anarchist\r\n   mentality, it is not alone in this sort of mentality that it is\r\n   found. All anarchists are_ révoltés, _but all persons who display\r\n   tendencies to revolt are not anarchists. Thus in the political\r\n   and social sphere a number of the partisans of the bygone régimes\r\n   are_ révoltés.”—A. HAMON.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_I went yesterday to hear Paul Déroulède.... As for me, I\r\n   confess that I particularly relished this frankness of accent,\r\n   this conviction capable of folly._”—ALEXANDER HEPP.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Honour, to my thinking, consists entirely in the fine quality\r\n   of the motive which directs the act. Now I have always seen the\r\n   conduct of Paul Déroulède dominated by an anxious and continual\r\n   care for our national greatness, by the reparation of our\r\n   disasters. All the movements, all the supreme prayers of his\r\n   heart, are eminently French. That suffices me._”\r\n\r\n   SULLY-PRUDHOMME.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_There are no practical socialists but the anti-Semites._”\r\n\r\n   EDOUARD DRUMONT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Socialist Bookshelf]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the plainest after-results of the Dreyfus affair, into which the\r\nsocialists[50] as well as the anarchists threw themselves with glee for\r\nthe superb opportunity it offered to undermine patriotism and destroy\r\nthe army, has been a cleavage between the more conservative and the more\r\nradical elements of the socialist party.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause of this division may be found in the fact that two\r\nsocialists (one of whom, M. Millerand, had previously been decidedly\r\nmilitant) accepted portfolios in the coalition ministry which supervised\r\nthe Dreyfus trial at Rennes and which survived it for a time. This\r\nofficial service had such a sobering effect, both upon the ministers\r\nthemselves and upon their immediate following, that their socialism\r\nbecame frankly opportunist; and the more radical and _doctrinaire_ among\r\ntheir fellow-socialists felt compelled, because of this, to withdraw\r\nfrom them their support. In like manner the socialist deputies who have\r\nhelped to maintain the Combes ministry have been constrained to a\r\nsimilar opportunism. So it has come about that the French socialists,\r\nwho formerly were, broadly speaking, all revolutionary, are now divided\r\ninto the two distinct and even hostile camps[51] of evolutionary\r\nsocialists and revolutionary socialists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. VAILLANT[52]]\r\n\r\nWith the evolutionary socialists—who are, perhaps, for being the less\r\nlogical only the more philosophical—this book has, from the very nature\r\nof its subject, nothing to do. The revolutionary socialists alone\r\nconcern us.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that _doctrinaire_ socialism and _doctrinaire_\r\nanarchism are at opposite poles of the world of thought. Absolute\r\nauthority is as much the ideal of the one as absolute liberty is the\r\nideal of the other. For the anarchist the betterment of society depends\r\nprimarily on the betterment of the individual, while for the socialist\r\nthe betterment of the individual depends primarily on the betterment of\r\nsociety. The complete realisation of socialism presupposes the\r\nperfection of human machinery, and the complete realisation of anarchism\r\nthe perfection of human nature. The theories of the vicarious atonement\r\nand salvation by character present, in another field, a somewhat\r\nanalogous contrast. Nevertheless, these theoretically antithetical\r\nsystems find in their antagonism to actual conditions so many points of\r\ncontact that it is not always easy for an outsider to determine whether\r\na given revolutionist is an anarchist or a revolutionary socialist, and\r\nnot always easy, one more than half suspects, for a revolutionist to\r\ndetermine himself in which of the two classes he really belongs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LÉANDRE’S CARICATURE OF PAUL DÉROULÈDE AS DON QUIXOTE\r\n\r\n  _By permission of “Le Rire”_]\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary socialists, like the anarchists, are high-minded\r\ndreamers, who are bent on procuring happiness for the human kind.\r\nUnlike the anarchists, they participate in elections, and do not desire\r\nthe abolition of the state (as is indicated by their use of the word\r\n_citoyen_, which the anarchists abhor); but they do wish for the\r\ndownfall of the present state (with whose bad faith and impotence they\r\nare thoroughly disgusted) as the first step towards setting up the\r\nsocialistic state, and they hold collective revolt the most likely means\r\nof effecting this downfall; all of which, in troubled periods, amounts\r\nto very much the same thing practically as if they abjured the state\r\naltogether. Like the anarchists, they demand the abolition of private\r\nproperty, and they are opposed, like them, to charity (as the term is\r\npopularly understood), to patriotism, and to armies. Like the\r\nanarchists, furthermore (though this does not seem to be a logical\r\nnecessity for either), they are violently opposed to the church; and\r\nthey are (with less inevitableness than the anarchists in the same\r\nmatter) more or less hostile to marriage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. BROUSSE[53]]\r\n\r\nThey do not advocate the individual overt act of violence (though they\r\noften sympathise with it when committed), and, hoping for social\r\nsalvation from social machinery, neglect the propaganda _par l’exemple_.\r\nWith these exceptions their methods of propaganda are identical with\r\nthose of the anarchists. They dispense the word orally, as the\r\nanarchists dispense it by means of mass meetings, _punchs-conférences_,\r\n_soupes-conférences_, _matinées-conférences_, _ballades propagandistes_,\r\n_soirées familiales_, and amateur theatricals, and have a similar\r\n_penchant_ for the _chanson populaire_.\r\n\r\nThe socialists have their special books and brochures and ingenious\r\nmethods of circulating them and their special propagandist press, which\r\nincludes several dailies, as well as weeklies and monthlies,[54] and\r\nserves as a bond of union and a means of communication between\r\nindividuals and groups; and they make a copious use of placards,\r\nmanifestos, pictures, artistic posters, and souvenir postal cards.[55]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. JAURÈS[56]]\r\n\r\nAnarchists and socialists unite in anti-clerical and anti-militarist\r\nmass meetings, in interfering riotously with public worship, in\r\nshouting, _A bas l’Armée!_ and _A bas la Patrie!_ They also unite in\r\ndistributing to the conscripts manuals reciting their duties in the\r\nregiments, chief of which are disobedience and desertion; and they\r\ncommemorate together many of the same anniversaries, especially those of\r\nthe _Mur des Fédérés_[57] (May) and of Etienne Dolet[58] (August). It is\r\nat election times mainly that they try conclusions fiercely with each\r\nother, because of their antagonistic sentiments towards the exercise of\r\nthe vote.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary socialists esteem lightly trade-unions, except as a\r\nmeans of coercing ministries to paternalism, and take little interest in\r\nco-operation[59] as practised at present; but they have something of the\r\nsame faith as the anarchists that _la grève générale_, which several of\r\ntheir congresses have indorsed, and _la pan-coopération_ will coincide\r\nwith the revolution.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense—and not so very far-fetched a sense, either—every\r\npolitical party in Paris is revolutionary, inasmuch as all the “outs”\r\nare willing to resort to revolutionary methods to overturn the _statu\r\nquo_ and all the “ins” would be willing to resort to revolutionary\r\nmethods to restore their respective dispensations if, by a turn of the\r\nwheel of fortune, they should become the “outs.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. GUESDE[60]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. ALLEMANE[61]]\r\n\r\nThe anarchists and the socialists are by no means the only bodies who\r\nfind the Third Republic detestable, and who, to make way with it, would\r\ngladly descend into the street. The royalists and imperialists are\r\nreactionary revolutionists, only deterred from insurrection and a _coup\r\nd’état_ by the absence of the magnetic man and the propitious occasion.\r\nThe nationalists would pause at nothing that would enable them to\r\nsubstitute a plebiscitary for the present parliamentary republic, and\r\nthe anti-Semites at nothing that would expel or dispossess the Jews.\r\nRochefort and Drumont call themselves socialists; and Guérin’s organ,\r\n_L’Anti-Juif_, regularly carries this head-line, “_Défendre tous les\r\ntravailleurs, Combattre tous les spéculateurs_.” _L’Autorité_,\r\n_L’Intransigeant_, _La Libre Parole_, and _La Patrie_ are as truly\r\nrevolutionary sheets as are _Les Temps Nouveaux_ and _Le Libertaire_;\r\nwhile Paul de Cassagnac, Baron Legoux, Lur-Saluces, the gilded youth of\r\nthe “_Œillet Blanc_” (“White Carnation”) who battered the President’s\r\nhat at Auteuil, Rochefort, Drumont, Guérin, Régis, and Déroulède are as\r\nmuch revolutionists as the socialist Jules Guesde or the anarchist Jean\r\nGrave.\r\n\r\nSome time before his expulsion Déroulède said to his electors: “There\r\nis no other means of safety than a revolution at once popular and\r\nmilitary, having at its head a civilian and a soldier, both loyally\r\nresolved to maintain the republic. To deliver France and the republic,\r\nthere are three methods possible: the will of a man (that is, the _coup\r\nd’état_); the will of the people (that is, revolution); the will of the\r\nrepresentative assembly (that is, parliament). I will do all in my power\r\nto make the last method—the most peaceable—effective; but I do not\r\ngreatly count on it, and I declare myself determined to venture\r\neverything for the triumph of the other two.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULES GUÉRIN]\r\n\r\nDéroulède and Guérin are both in banishment at this moment for overt\r\nacts against the state. And, while the strict legality of the forms of\r\nthe high court trial that condemned them is more than dubious, there is\r\nno doubt possible as to their essential guilt.\r\n\r\nWhile Guérin was holding Fort Chabrol, the Dreyfusard anarchists were\r\nexhorted by the anarchist leader, Sébastien Faure, to change their cries\r\nof _A bas Guérin!_ to _Vive Guérin!_ since, whatever the\r\nanti-Dreyfusard, anti-Semite rebel might have been before the siege or\r\nmight be after it, he was logically one of them as long as he was\r\ndefying the authority of the state.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that Paris, in spite of her excessive conservatism in\r\ncertain directions, has, and ever since the Great Revolution has had, an\r\n_état d’esprit révolutionnaire_. Paris revolutionists and Parisians,\r\nthen, are, in the last analysis, pretty nearly one and the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE ELITE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_Montmartre va descendre!_”]\r\n\r\n                       “_The man\r\n   Of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys.\r\n   Power, like a desolating pestilence,\r\n   Pollutes whate’er it touches; and obedience,\r\n   Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,\r\n   Makes slaves of men and, of the human frame,\r\n   A mechanized automaton._”\r\n\r\n   SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY TRADITIONS OF THE LATIN QUARTER\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_When the students sing the_ Carmagnole, _France trembles._”\r\n\r\n   “_The monarchy of July persecuted the cancan, which historically\r\n   seems to have been the anarchy of the period._”—AURÉLIEN SCHOLL.\r\n\r\n   “_Humble spot, dingy little court, oh, how charming I find you!\r\n   Hence will go forth some day the Revolution which shall save us;\r\n   the age which by chloroform has already suppressed pain will\r\n   suppress hunger also._”\r\n\r\n   MICHELET on the Collège de France.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_The great movement of ideas which occurred in France under the\r\n   silent reign of Napoleon III., when the tribune was mute, the\r\n   press muzzled, and the right of assembly confiscated, had for its\r\n   stage the_ brasseries _of the Latin Quarter._”—EDMOND LEPELLETIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Sorbonne,” says Eugène Pelletan, “shines from the heights through\r\nthe early mists like the dawn of intelligence. It is there that the\r\nFrench Revolution was really born, thence was its point of departure....\r\n\r\n   “On this sacred mount of the university a philosopher in\r\n   monkish garb spoke one day in the open air. What did he say?\r\n   It matters little. He said something new, and the multitude\r\n   listened because he was the first to defend the claims of the\r\n   earth,—the right of reason to reason; and, while he spoke, a\r\n   veiled woman, with lips on fire, clung to the grating of a\r\n   convent over yonder, and encouraged him with gestures in\r\n   default of words.\r\n\r\n   “The man represents human intellect hampered by the church,\r\n   and the woman represents France confined in a cloister; but\r\n   Abélard will grow, and will assume day by day, like the Indian\r\n   god, a fresh avatar. To-morrow—for what is to-morrow in the\r\n   life of a people?—he will bear, according to the ironical or\r\n   severe humour of France, the name of Rabelais, the name of\r\n   Descartes, the name of Rousseau, the name of Voltaire. And,\r\n   side by side with him, the Idea, the insulted, the abused\r\n   Idea, will advance with slow and tragic steps between two rows\r\n   of fagots, a flame in her forehead and her hands at her sides,\r\n   until the day when she shall wrest the torch from the\r\n   executioner, and proclaim herself Queen.”\r\n\r\nWhoever would unfold the progress of the revolutionary spirit in France\r\nfrom the earliest times through the centuries must needs write a history\r\nof the Sorbonne and of the seat of the Sorbonne, the _Pays Latin_ (the\r\nLatin Quarter).\r\n\r\nIn the relatively limited area included between Notre Dame, where the\r\ngoddess of Reason was enthroned in the Great Revolution; the Place\r\nMaubert,[62] with its statue of Etienne Dolet, the sixteenth-century\r\nprinter, burned for impiety and atheism; the Square Monge, with its\r\nstatue of François Villon; the Place Monge, with its statue of Louis\r\nBlanc; the Panthéon, with its memorials to the intellectual liberators,\r\nRousseau, Victor Hugo, and Voltaire; the Place de l’Ecole de Médecine,\r\nwith its statue of Danton doughtily inscribed, “_Pour vaincre les\r\nennemis de la justice, il faut de l’audace, encore de l’audace et\r\ntoujours de l’audace_”; the Place St. Germain des Prés, with its statue\r\nof Diderot; and the Place de l’Institut, with its statue of\r\nCondorcet,—every inch of ground is rich in souvenirs of the\r\nintellectual history of France and of the convulsions by which this\r\nhistory’s various stages have been marked.\r\n\r\nHere on the left bank of the Seine, where Abélard, in the twelfth\r\ncentury, “discoursed to all the earth,—to two popes, twenty cardinals,\r\nand fifty bishops, to all the orders, all the modern schools which\r\ndescended from the mountain and inundated Europe”;[63] whither came\r\nDante in the fourteenth century for the lectures of Siger de Brabant;\r\nthe Greek Lascaris in the fifteenth and Calvin and Loyola in the\r\nsixteenth centuries; where the _trouvère_ Rutebœuf in the thirteenth\r\ncentury and the poet Villon in the fifteenth carried on the _propagande\r\npar l’exemple_ and even the _propagande par le fait_; where, in the\r\nearly part of the fifteenth century, the _Cabocherie_ decreed the reign\r\nof virtue and equality, pillaged the dwellings of the wealthy, and had\r\nall things common; where, in the sixteenth century, the _Commune\r\nCatholique_ was set up at the instigation of an anti-royalist preacher\r\nof St. Sévérin; where, in the same century, François Rabelais, Clément\r\nMarot, and La Boétie (friend of Montaigne and social democrat before his\r\ntime) prepared themselves, in their very different fashions, to\r\nalternately edify and castigate the civilisation of their epoch, and\r\nRené Descartes, in the seventeenth century, to found modern philosophy\r\nand to destroy scholasticism; where the eighteenth-century\r\nEncyclopedists set themselves to solve the problem of human destiny, and\r\nbegot the Revolution; where, in the century just closed, the trinity of\r\nthe Collège de France, Michelet, Quinet, and Mickiewicz, formed the men\r\nwho were to set up the Third Republic on the ruins of the Second\r\nEmpire,—in this intellectual and nerve centre of Paris, of France, and\r\nat intervals of the world, revolutionary action has been so often suited\r\nto the revolutionary thought that no one dreams of crying out crime or\r\nmystery when, in the course of excavations, human bones are exhumed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MÉGOTIERS OF THE PLACE MAUBERT]\r\n\r\nRevolutionary thinking has not been practised with impunity in the\r\n_Quartier Latin_. From Abélard to Michelet and Renan, religious,\r\npolitical, and philosophical heresies have called down ecclesiastical,\r\ngovernmental, and academical wrath with the usual result of helping to\r\npropagate the heresies.\r\n\r\nAbélard was censured for heterodoxy, hounded from one monastery to\r\nanother, and condemned finally to perpetual silence. Ramus, antagonist\r\nof the philosophy of Aristotle, was included in the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew. “In Ramus,” says Michelet, “they fancied they were killing\r\na second Abélard. They thought to butcher mind.” Clément Marot was\r\nimprisoned, and forced to flee from France. Descartes, maltreated by\r\nCatholics and Protestants alike, forbidden to teach, and threatened with\r\ndeath, took refuge first in Holland and then in Sweden. Vanini was\r\nburned at the stake. Buffon was persecuted for his _Histoire Naturelle_,\r\nand Montesquieu for his _Esprit des Lois_. Michelet, who “scratched the\r\nheavens with his white hand,”[64] Mickiewicz, Quinet, and Renan were\r\nexpelled from the Collège de France.\r\n\r\nThere have been periods, it is true, when the university faculties have\r\nbeen servile and cringing,—mere tools of the potentates of church and\r\nstate,—and periods when the students have been craven or lethargic; but\r\nthese periods are the exceptions. Speaking broadly, the _Quartier_ has\r\nbeen from first to last a preserve of free living and free thinking, a\r\nstronghold of opposition, a centre of agitation, and a hot-bed of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nEugène Pelletan thus describes the students of the university’s\r\nbeginnings:—\r\n\r\n   “A mixed, vagabond population, drifted together from nobody\r\n   could say where, they live by the grace of God, they eat when\r\n   they can, they sleep on straw, and carry their begging wallets\r\n   proudly, as if conscious they hold there the word of the\r\n   future.... When they do not dine, they have the resource of\r\n   the cabaret; and, always noisy, always care-free, they prowl\r\n   about at nightfall, they force now and then the door of a\r\n   bourgeois, and, when the watch rushes to the uproar, they put\r\n   it to rout, quit with answering for the misdemeanour to the\r\n   rector, who invariably exonerates.”\r\n\r\n   “Scantily clad and almost vagabonds,” says another historian\r\n   of this early period, “but not depriving themselves of good\r\n   cheer, the future magistrates and theologians, who were to\r\n   antagonise in parliament the will of the king, were already\r\n   revolutionary.”\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century the faculties, morally, and the students, both\r\nmorally and materially, cast in their lots with the revolution of\r\nEtienne Marcel, who is credited with having invented the barricade.\r\n\r\nReign succeeded reign, and still the good habit of thrashing the watch\r\nwas kept up. Besides, there were battles-royal galore between the\r\nstudents and the troops of the king.\r\n\r\nThe students made themselves jugglers, fakirs, and buffoons on the\r\nPont-Neuf, then a favourite, shop-lined promenade. They sacked\r\ncook-shops and taverns, and levied tribute from belated pedestrians. The\r\nlawless exploits of François Villon, singer of villanelles to\r\nGuillemette, the _tapissière_, and Jehanneton, the _chaperonnière_, in\r\nthe reigns of Charles VII. and Louis XI., have become legendary.\r\n\r\nThat other great François (Rabelais) has portrayed the democratic and\r\nturbulent temper of the students of a somewhat later period.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Louis XIV., the merry, strolling players and\r\nmountebanks, Tabarin and Gaultier-Garguille (the latter the inventor of\r\nthe farce), had numerous imitators among the students; which jovial\r\nhumour did not prevent the latter from entering heartily into the\r\n_Fronde_,[65] risking their lives on “the Day of the Barricades” and\r\nexercising their caustic wit against the court and the hated foreign\r\nminister, Mazarin, in lampoons called _Mazarinades_.\r\n\r\nThe trenchant criticisms and the comprehensive formulas, which appeared\r\nin the Encyclopedists’ published works, captivated many professors of\r\nthe university,[66] and made a direct and profound impression on the\r\nstudents. But it seems to be no exaggeration to say that it was the\r\ncafés and cabarets of the Left Bank rather than the university that\r\nfanned the smouldering flame of discontent into a conflagration of\r\nrebellion. In them the fiercest revolutionary clubs of the epoch had\r\ntheir rendezvous. At the _Café Procope_,—transformed, alas! into a\r\nvulgar restaurant only a year or so back,—Hébert presided over a club\r\nwhich burned before the door the journals found too tame for its ideas,\r\nand Danton met with Marat, Legendre, and Fabre d’Eglantine; and the\r\nProcope was only one of a score. Indeed, it would take a volume to do\r\nfull justice to the part played in French history by the Latin Quarter\r\ncafés from 1780 to Napoleon’s establishment of himself in power.\r\n\r\nUnder the Restoration the social and political Utopias of the Icarians,\r\nthe Fourierites, and the Saint-Simonians, commanded the interest, if not\r\nthe allegiance, of a considerable portion of the university. “The new\r\nSorbonne,” says Vacherot, “far from viewing unmoved the liberal movement\r\nwhich was to culminate in the revolution of July, participated in it\r\nactively, lending it the prestige of its most _spirituel_, its most\r\nserious, and its most eloquent teaching.”\r\n\r\nIt was in great part the students, as all know who have followed the\r\nvicissitudes of Marius and Cosette in _Les Misérables_, who were\r\nresponsible for the insurrection of 1830.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spheres of literature and art, however, where Romanticism\r\nwas struggling to supplant Classicism, that the hottest passions were\r\nkindled. The influence of Scott, Byron, and the rising Hugo dominated,\r\neven in the matter of dress. Romanticists adopted the costumes of\r\nMoslems, Corsairs, and Giaours: the _Quartier_ resembled a fancy-dress\r\nball-room, and men fought in its streets for their artistic as they had\r\nin other times for their political and religious creeds.\r\n\r\nThe students of the reign of Louis Philippe have been thus pictured by\r\nDe Banville: “Young, gay, reckless, but possessed of native distinction,\r\ncoquettishly arrayed in velvet and all sorts of original and fancy\r\ncostumes, capped with Basque _bérets_ and felts _à la_ Rubens, they went\r\nup and down, sauntering, singing, gazing into space, alone, or in pairs,\r\nor in groups, or three by three, selling their text-books willingly at\r\nthe old book dealers in order to enter the cabaret,—a custom which, as\r\nyou know, dates from the twelfth century.”\r\n\r\nOf this same youth and that which came immediately after it Aurélien\r\nScholl writes: “The young men of the schools thought solely of fêtes and\r\nof fun. The _Quartier_ resembled strangely the _Bohème_ of Mürger,—_la\r\nnoce_, nothing but _la noce_. The historiographer of this epoch finds\r\nonly farces to narrate, and such farces!”\r\n\r\nAnd yet the students played almost as large a part in the revolution of\r\n1848 as in that of 1830. Under their masks of flippancy they were\r\nserious. They had merely been waiting for the strategic moment and a\r\nleader; and, when in 1847 Antonio Watripon, bent on a “reawakening of\r\nthe schools,” founded a journal, _La Lanterne du Quartier Latin_, as a\r\nmeans of organising and directing the student opposition, they took an\r\nactive part in the demonstrations which brought about the downfall of\r\nthe government of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nThey sprang to arms again, soon after, against the disillusionising\r\n_coup d’état_ of the third Napoleon, while the workingmen remained\r\nrelatively submissive. “At the news that Louis Napoleon is getting ready\r\nto confiscate the public liberties,” says Scholl, “a wave of indignation\r\nsweeps over the length and breadth of the _Quartier_. The students\r\ninvade, and pronounce inflammatory discourses in, café after café,\r\n_crèmerie_ after _crèmerie_. They descend without hesitation into the\r\nstreet to combat the troops of the tyrant, and many pay for their\r\nheroism with their lives.”\r\n\r\nThe discouragement which followed the complete establishment of the\r\nauthority of the usurper naturally gave rise to a sort of lassitude,\r\nwhich was mistaken by many for sycophancy or indifference, and was\r\ngenerally regarded as proof positive of the degeneration of the student\r\ntype. But the students, although temporarily silent and outwardly\r\nsubmissive, had not disarmed. It was not long before Vallès, Gambetta,\r\nVermesch, Blanqui, Rochefort, and scores of others, who participated a\r\nlittle later in the Commune or in the founding of the Third Republic,\r\nwere busily sowing the seeds of disaffection in the cafes; and in 1865\r\nthis fresh revolutionary movement was given coherence and direction by\r\n_Les Propos de Labienus_, the little masterpiece of Rogeard.\r\n\r\nIt was, in point of fact, mainly in the cafés of the Latin Quarter\r\nrather than in the university proper that the revolution of 1871, as\r\nwell as that of 1789, was fermented.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, at the _Café de la Renaissance Hellénique_, a revolutionary\r\nclub was formed, consisting of eight persons, the oldest of whom was\r\nbarely twenty-two,—five law students, a medical student, a painter, and\r\na _rentier_,—the first overt act of which was a riotous protest against\r\nthe production of Augier’s _La Contagion_ at the _Odéon_. Most, if not\r\nall, of the charter members of this club, which was soon consolidated\r\nwith a club of older men meeting at the _Café Serpente_, saw the inside\r\nof the prison of Ste. Pélagie before the Commune was achieved.\r\n\r\n   “The Renaissance,” says Auguste Lepage in his _Cafés\r\n   Artistiques et Littéraires de Paris_, “had a special\r\n   physiognomy at the absinthe hour and after dinner. Noisy,\r\n   uncombed students entered, mounted to the second floor, got\r\n   together in groups, and talked politics or took a turn at\r\n   billiards. They lighted long pipes, artistically coloured; and\r\n   through the smoke clouds might be heard, together with the\r\n   voices of the speechifiers, the clicks of the ivory balls as\r\n   they met on the green cushions. _Etudiantes_ accompanied the\r\n   students. These strikingly dressed girls smoked cigarettes and\r\n   occupied themselves with politics.”\r\n\r\nThe imperial police had a special fondness for the Renaissance, and this\r\ncafé shared with the _Brasserie de St. Sévérin_, after the Commune was\r\nset up, the distinction of being used as a headquarters by the Communard\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nThe Procope, also affected by police spies, was frequented by Spuller,\r\nFerry, Floquet, Vermorel, and Gambetta, who preserved their liberty on\r\nmore than one occasion by utilising the back door, which had rendered a\r\nsimilar service to Danton in another century.\r\n\r\nThe _Café Voltaire_ harboured, among others, Gambetta and Vallès, the\r\n_Café de Buci_ Vallès and Delescluze, and the _Brasserie Audler_ and the\r\n_Restaurant Laveur_ Courbet and his unconventional intimates.\r\n\r\nTo summarise: from the time of Abélard—the Abélard who was sustained\r\nand inspired by the thought of the flaming lips of Héloïse pressed\r\nagainst the convent grating—to and through the Commune, the _Pays\r\nLatin_ was characterised by a revolutionary spirit which was composed of\r\nthree seemingly independent, if not mutually antagonistic, but, in\r\nreality, complementary and vitally interrelated traits,—love of\r\nlaughter, love of liberty, and love of love.\r\n\r\nThe different persons of this emancipating trinity were equally potent\r\nimpellers to Quixotic thought and action; and no one of the three could\r\nhave long survived—such is the French temperament in or out of the\r\n_Quartier_—without both of the others. The Gallic imagination and\r\nconscience are dependent on good cheer and affection; they cease to\r\noperate if a fellow may not unbend in buffoonery with the boys and may\r\nnot adore a woman. And, without conscience and imagination, is no\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTRE DAME FROM PONT D’AUSTERLITZ]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   _“Ever the undiscouraged, resolute, struggling soul of man_\r\n\r\n       *   *   *   *   *    *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n   _Ever the grappled mystery of all Earth’s ages old or new;_\r\n\r\n       *   *   *   *   *    *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n   _Ever the soul dissatisfied, curious, unconvinced at last;\r\n   Struggling to-day the same—battling the same.”_\r\n\r\n   WALT WHITMAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n   THE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT\r\n   IN THE LATIN QUARTER OF TO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n   _“Each Jack with his Jill.”_\r\n\r\n   BEN JONSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _“What is love? ‘Tis not hereafter;\r\n     Present mirth hath present laughter;\r\n     What’s to come is still unsure:\r\n     In delay there lies no plenty;\r\n     Then come kiss me, sweet-and-twenty;\r\n     Youth’s a stuff will not endure.”_\r\n\r\n   SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _“It once might have been, once only:\r\n       We lodged in a street together,\r\n     You, a sparrow on the house-top lonely,\r\n       I, a lone she-bird of his feather.”_\r\n\r\n   ROBERT BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _“The rôle of a pretty woman is more serious than we think.”_\r\n\r\n   MONTESQUIEU (Lettres Persanes).\r\n\r\n\r\n   _“I was twenty, age when the heart all illumined with poesy\r\n   guards religiously the subtile vibrations of the beautiful and\r\n   the just; the sweet human season in which one yearns to have a\r\n   thousand mouths to bite to bleeding—during an eternity—the bare\r\n   pink bosoms of the beautiful chimeras that go singing\r\n   by.”_—CLOVIS HUGUES.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_I shall eternally hide my deepest emotions under the mask of_\r\n   insouciance _and the perruque of irony._”\r\n\r\n   JULES VALLÈS, in Jacques Vingtras—Le Bachelier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CAVEAU OF THE LATIN QUARTER]\r\n\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said of late years about the change which has\r\ntaken place in the _Pays Latin_ and in the student character. The “old\r\nboys” tell us, with sneering superiority or quavering regret, that the\r\n_Quartier Latin_ is no longer what it was. Some evoke the revels and the\r\n_grisettes_ depicted in Louis Huart’s _Physiologie de l’Etudiant_,\r\nMusset’s _Mimi Pinson_, and Mürger’s _La Vie de Bohème_, and others the\r\nrebellious souls of the student martyrs of 1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871.\r\n\r\nAccording to the former, the contemporary student is a morose, prudent,\r\nselfish, woman-hating, digging prig, with no higher dreams than\r\npettifogging politics and bourgeois comfort, and the _étudiante_ a\r\nscheming, avaricious adventuress. According to the latter, he is\r\nsnobbish, extravagant, and dissipated, a brainless spendthrift, gambler,\r\ndebauchee, and drunkard, and his amorette, aside from differences of\r\nsex, his perfect counterpart.\r\n\r\nThere is truth in these somewhat conflicting charges, since both these\r\ntypes of student do exist. The curious thing is that similar complaints\r\nhave been made by the alumni out in the world for almost as long as\r\nthere have been alumni. It is not easy to go back far enough into the\r\nhistory of the _Quartier Latin_ to escape caustic aspersions on its\r\nignoble present and fond reversions to its fine and proper past.\r\n\r\nIf there is one period that is vaunted to-day above another as the\r\ngolden age of the Latin Quarter, it is the period portrayed in the\r\nwritings of Mürger, De Musset, and Nestor Roqueplan,—period when “_le\r\nvin était spirituel et la folie philosophique_”; period of innumerable\r\ndrolleries and of two revolutions; and yet each of these three writers,\r\neven the happy-hearted Mürger, had recourse to that necessary, if\r\npuerile, vanishing point of the perspective of thought,—an anterior\r\ngolden age.\r\n\r\nA person who did not know their authorship would take the opening\r\nchapters of De Musset’s _Confession d’un Enfant du Siècle_ to have been\r\nwritten in this year of grace 1904 by a disgruntled university alumnus,\r\nwho was casting longing, lingering looks behind him to De Musset’s time.\r\nAs, for instance, this passage: “The ways of the students and the\r\nartists—ways so fresh, so beautiful, so full of buoyant\r\nyouthfulness—felt the effects of the universal change. Men, in\r\nseparating from women, had muttered a word which wounds unto\r\ndeath,—disdain. They plunged into wine, and ran after courtesans. The\r\nstudents and the artists did likewise. They treated love as they treated\r\nglory and religion: it was a hoary illusion. They haunted low places.\r\nThe _grisette_ so imaginative, so _romanesque_, so sweet and tender in\r\nlove, found herself left behind her counter. She was poor, and she was\r\nno more lovable; she must have hats and gowns; she sold herself. O\r\nshame! The young man who should have loved her, whom she would have\r\nloved, he who formerly escorted her to the forests of Verrières and\r\nRomainville, to the dances on the greensward, to the suppers in the\r\nshady coverts, he who came to chat by the lamp in the back shop during\r\nthe long winter evenings, he who shared the morsel of bread steeped in\r\nthe sweat of her brow and her poor but sublime love,—he, this very man\r\nwho had deserted her, found her, during some night of orgy, within the\r\n_lupanar_, pale and livid, utterly lost, with hunger on her lips and\r\nprostitution in her heart.”\r\n\r\nA sight-seeing visitor to the highways of the _Quartier_ is apt to feel\r\nthat the grumbling of the elders is well grounded. The conventional,\r\nimperturbable, faultlessly attired _fils à papa_, and the over-dressed,\r\nover-breezy, blondined young (?) women he observes on the café terraces\r\nand in the public places, seem to have little or nothing in common with\r\nthe students and _grisettes_ of poetry and romance he is out for to see.\r\n\r\nThe _Quartier Latin_ has changed along with the rest of the world, of\r\ncourse, in the last thirty eventful years. The humiliating memory of the\r\nFranco-Prussian war and the failure of the Third Republic to fulfil its\r\npromises of social equality and freedom have necessarily rendered the\r\nstudent somewhat more reflective; the analytic fearlessness of science\r\nhas made him more relentlessly introspective; the growing fierceness of\r\nthe struggle for existence occasioned by the overcrowding of the\r\nprofessions and the obligatory military service has forced him, in his\r\nown despite, to be somewhat more practical; the phenomenal expansion of\r\nindustry, commerce, and finance, and their disillusionising tendencies,\r\nhave not, in the nature of things, left him entirely untainted; and the\r\nequally phenomenal spread of luxury has instilled some absurd and\r\ndeplorable sybaritic notions into his head.\r\n\r\nThere has been a net loss in the _Quartier_—and where has there not\r\nbeen?—in picturesqueness and spontaneity. But the vapouring cads and\r\nthe stolid “digs” who call down the wrath of the elders are not\r\nrepresentative: they are at the extremes of the student body. Taken all\r\nin all, the student has changed less than the big world about him, not\r\nonly during the last thirty years, but even during the centuries which\r\nhave elapsed since he came to his class with a bundle of straw under his\r\narm for a seat and his professor lectured _sub Jove_, liable to the\r\ninterruptions of passing washerwomen and street porters.\r\n\r\nHe has changed less; and such changes as he has undergone are, for the\r\nmost part, superficial. His love of laughter, his love of liberty, and\r\nhis love of love have not been lost. They manifest themselves a little\r\ndifferently, that is all.\r\n\r\nHis love of liberty is not, for the moment, manifested, as it was in the\r\nbeginning, when Rutebœuf and Villon played the highwayman and Clément\r\nMarot was king of the Bassoche, by forcing the doors of the bourgeois\r\nand beating the watch; nor, as it was in 1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871, by\r\nmounting the barricade, though there is never a certainty that he will\r\nnot mount a barricade to-morrow. His love of laughter does not often\r\nlead him to the pillaging of taverns and workshops nowadays, as it did\r\nthe roistering blade of the time of Louis XI., nor to the metamorphosing\r\nof himself into a juggler, tumbler, clown, or mountebank. And his love\r\nof love rarely blossoms into such dainty idyls as are recounted of the\r\nperiod of the Restoration and Louis Philippe. Perhaps, if the truth were\r\nknown, it was rarely they so blossomed even then.\r\n\r\nThe ragged doublets, begging wallets, and pallets of straw have gone\r\nforever, as have the street classes exposed to the inclemency of the\r\nweather, of which they were the fitting accompaniment. The stiff, ugly\r\nfashions of this superlatively ugly age—the cut-away and frock coats,\r\nthe “plug” and Derby hats, and the close-cropped hair—have, in a\r\nmeasure, replaced the felts _à la_ Rubens and flowing ties and the wavy\r\nlocks, velvet jackets, and blouses and tasselled Basque _bérets_ of\r\nRomanticism. Among the _étudiantes_ the simple muslin caps and chintz,\r\nmuslin, and gingham frocks have fled alarmed before modish hats and\r\ntailor-made gowns. The _cancan_, a pitiably tame _cancan_, is danced—in\r\npublic—only to satisfy the curiosity of sensation-seeking tourists.\r\nBut, allowing for differences of customs and costumes, for the\r\nunavoidable concessions to the more insistent claims of the spirit of\r\nthe age, the _Quartier Latin_ is still the same old _Quartier_.\r\n\r\nThere are numbers who still “live by the grace of God, eat when they\r\ncan,” not when they would, and “sell their books to the old book dealer\r\nfor a meal or an evening at the cabaret.” Poverty still stalks through\r\nthe _Pays Latin_, and is still bravely cuffed or blithely bluffed out of\r\ncountenance there. The student demand for rooms ranging from fifteen to\r\nthirty francs a month, and the lively, almost fierce student patronage\r\nof the _crèmeries_, _bouillons_, and little wine-shops (where an _à la\r\ncarte_ expenditure of 18 sous verges on extravagance), and of the _prix\r\nfixe_ restaurants at 22 and 25 sous, are eloquent of a wide-spread\r\nscarcity of funds.\r\n\r\n   “Flicoteaux exists, and will exist,” wrote Balzac in\r\n   _Illusions Perdues_, “as long as the student shall wish to\r\n   live. He eats there,—nothing more, nothing less; but he eats\r\n   there, as he works, with a sombre or joyous activity,\r\n   according to his circumstances and his character.”\r\n\r\nOne cannot have lived in the _Quartier_ long and not have had student\r\nfriends who had more than a passing acquaintance with hunger and for\r\nwhom a fire in winter was a festival event. In his mansard, where the\r\nstudent is doomed to freeze in winter and broil in summer, or in his\r\nstuffy, windowless _cabinet_, where he is doomed to suffocate the year\r\nround, are enough outward signs of destitution to rive the heart of the\r\nmost hardened professional charity visitor; and yet, ten to one, this\r\npoor devil of a “Jack” has his “Jill,” for the _grisette_ exists.\r\n\r\nYes, countless Jeremiads to the contrary notwithstanding, the _grisette_\r\nexists; under another name or, rather, under several other names,—there\r\nare words that defy strict definition; but she exists; changed somewhat,\r\nas the student himself is changed somewhat, but unchanged, as he is\r\nunchanged, in her love of laughter, her love of liberty, and her love of\r\nlove. Gracious, graceful, and tender as ever; ignorant and clever,\r\nsuperstitious and sagacious, selfish and self-sacrificing, garrulous\r\nand reticent, cruel and kind-hearted, outspoken and deceitful,\r\nconscientious and unscrupulous, generous and avaricious, and so forth\r\n_ad infinitum_; inconsequent, inconsistent, capricious, contradictory,\r\nbewitching bundle of opposites; best of comrades and sincerest, because\r\nficklest, of mistresses; adorable, ever-changing, and unchangeable\r\n_grisette_!\r\n\r\nGreedy of dress, the dance, and the theatre, she will sacrifice them all\r\nat the beck of a real affection. Indifferent to fortune when it comes\r\nher way, she will go without eating to have her fortune told her. She\r\nwill ruin a nabob without a twinge, and share her last crust with the\r\npoor. She is true to nothing but her latest impulse. She fears nothing\r\nbut being bored.\r\n\r\nJack nibbles scant bread and cheese, goes without wine and a fire, pawns\r\nhis overcoat, his watch, and his best hat to provide Jill with a silk\r\npetticoat or a new hat. Jill refuses a carriage and pair for love of\r\nJack, and makes merry, coquettish shift, for his sake, with “a ribbon\r\nand a rag”; and she will be as ready to go with him to the barricade\r\nto-morrow (for she dearly loves a scrimmage) as she is to go with him to\r\na banquet or a ball to-night.\r\n\r\nThanks to Jack (this latter-day Abélard) and almost as much to Jill\r\n(this latter-day Héloïse), to their unaffected sentimentalities and\r\ninnocent deviltries, the _Quartier_ has a luminous atmosphere of gayety\r\nand poesy, is, in a word, an adequate emblem of “the folly of youth that\r\namuses itself breaking window-panes, and which is, nevertheless,\r\npriceless beside the wisdom of age that mends them.”\r\n\r\nNote the student’s street masking, dancing, and singing, and his\r\nmanifold extravagances at the time of the Carnival, the _Mi-carême_, and\r\nthe _Quatorze Juillet_, and on special outdoor festival occasions of his\r\nown. Watch his pranks and listen to his magpie chatter in his\r\nrestaurants, cafés, and _brasseries_,—not the big, gaudy establishments\r\nof the “_Boul’ Mich_,” where he apes the _chic_ of the bourgeois with\r\nwhose purse he comes into direct and, for him, disastrous competition,\r\nand where, for the matter of that, the bourgeois often outnumbers him;\r\nbut in the dingy resorts of the back and side streets, where he is quite\r\nhis harum-scarum self, where he is free to shout, sing, caper, and guy\r\nto his heart’s content, play combs and tin horns, and applaud with\r\nbeer-mugs and canes, use floors for chairs, chairs for hobby-horses,\r\ntables for floors and chairs, and sandwiches for missiles, and dance his\r\nMariette upon his shoulder or dandle her upon his knee; and where he can\r\nvary the monotony of his dominoes and _manille_ by throwing a somersault\r\nor executing a pigeon-wing or by a turn at _savate_, leap-frog, or\r\npuss-in-the-corner. Follow him into the meetings of his bizarre clubs\r\nand sodalities; to the spots where he dances for the love of\r\ndancing,—_not_ the _Bullier_, where, except for rare occasions, he\r\nmerely forms part of a show; to his midnight suppers and\r\nmasquerades,—_Bal des Internes_, _Bal des Quat’z’ Arts_, _Bal Julien_,\r\nand others quite as characteristic because less renowned: in all these\r\nplaces and situations he displays a faculty for impromptu larking, for\r\nfabricating jocund pandemoniums at short notice, that prove him no\r\ndegenerate son of his father and no mean perpetuator of the mirthful\r\nprowess of his grandsires and great-grandsires.\r\n\r\nGo with him and his Finette, his Blanchette, his Rosette, his\r\nLouisette, or his Juliette, for a Sunday picnic at Bois-Meudon or\r\nJoinville-le-Pont, and share with them—if your wind is sufficient and\r\nyour Anglo-Saxon dignity can bear it—their more than infantile or\r\nlamb-like gambols over the meadows and under the trees. Keep with him,\r\nif you can be so privileged, his or her Saint’s Day. Celebrate with him\r\nthe _Fête des Rois_, the _Jour de l’An_, and the _Réveillon_. Rejoice\r\nwith him at the successful passing of his “exams” or condole with him\r\nfor being plucked. Help him empty the pannier and the cask received from\r\nhome. Enter into the spirit of his yarns, toasts, _gaudrioles_, and\r\n_chansons_ on these occasions; into the spirit of his betrayal of\r\nsentiment and play of wit, of his gallantry and persiflage, his repartee\r\nand poetry, his exaggerations and fantasies; of his _pas-seuls_ and\r\n_pas-à-quatres_, his revivals of _cancan_ (not the tame variety),\r\n_bourrée_, and _chahut_, his imitations of fandangos and jigs, his\r\nceremonious travesties of saraband and minuet, and his impulsive\r\nlaunching of _danses inédits_. Enjoy with him his accompaniments on\r\nglasses and symphonies on plates, his sallies and his salads, his coffee\r\nand his antics, his _pâtés_ and his mummeries, his horse-play and his\r\nwine. Under their spell you will be convinced, if you have any relish\r\nfor life in you, that for graces of fellowship, refinements of revelry,\r\nand subtleties of tomfoolery the student of the _Quartier_ has not his\r\npeer upon the planet.\r\n\r\nThe memory of Mürger and the cult of merriment under misfortune which\r\nhis immortal _Vie de Bohème_ symbolises is faithfully cherished. His\r\nanniversary is observed every summer about the time of St. Jean by a\r\npilgrimage to his monument in the Luxembourg and a banquet at an average\r\nprice of fifteen sous in some indulgent cabaret or café. A recent menu\r\nwas as follows: bread, wine, blood pudding, fried potatoes, almond\r\ncakes, cigars for the students and flowers for the _étudiantes_. One\r\nyear a thoughtless board of managers committed the indiscretion of\r\nelevating the price of the Mürger banquet to something over a franc,\r\nwhereat the whole _Quartier_ was thrown into a veritable tumult of\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\nThe real student cafes and cabarets[67]—which I would not name nor\r\nlocate for a kingdom, since their obscurity is the one thing that saves\r\nthem from being spoiled—are the lineal descendants and, _mutatis\r\nmutandis_, the worthy successors of the cafés and cabarets of the\r\nstudents’ fathers and grandfathers and of the taverns of his remote\r\nforbears.\r\n\r\nThere the ancient custom of charcoaling or chalking the walls with\r\nskits, epigrams, and caricatures, is kept up.[68]\r\n\r\nThere long-haired, unkempt poets mount on tables and counters, glass in\r\nhand, and flaunt their new-born epics, tragedies, and ballads, or loll\r\nin dreamful, languishing poses and intone their elegies and idyls, as\r\ndid Rutebœuf, Villon, Gringoire, and Cyrano de Bergerac in their\r\nrespective epochs; Molière, Boileau, Racine, and Crébillon, in the\r\nseventeenth century, at the “_Mouton Blanc_”; as did only yesterday\r\nMérat, Anatole France, Léon Vallade, and Leconte de Lisle at the _Café\r\nVoltaire_; De Banville, Mürger, Daudet, and Paul Arène at the _Café de\r\nl’Europe_; Coppée, Mendès, Rollinat, Mallarmé, Bourget (who began as a\r\npoet), Bouchor, Richepin, and Villiers de l’Isle-Adam at “The Sherry\r\nCobbler”; and as did all the versifiers of a generation at the _Café\r\nBobino_ (adjoining the famous little theatre of the same name), “which\r\nwas,” says Daudet, “the holy of holies for everybody who rhymed,\r\npainted, and trod the boards in the _Quartier Latin_.”\r\n\r\nThere they fête the victories of their respective poetic sects—_Roman_,\r\n_Instrumentiste_, _Magique_, _Magnifique_, _Déliquescent_, _Incohérent_,\r\nor _Néo-Décadent_, as the case may be, just as the Romanticists in their\r\ntime, and the Parnassians, Décadents, and Symbolists in their times,\r\nfêted their victories at the _Café Procope_. There they burn incense—as\r\nit was burned erstwhile at the _Soirées_ and _Petits Soupers Procope_ to\r\nHugo, Baudelaire, and Verlaine—to their divinities who have\r\nconsented—oh, monstrous condescension!—to foregather with them.\r\n\r\nThere, too, they blend becomingly philosophy and disputation with good\r\ncheer, as did D’Alembert, Voltaire, Condorcet, Diderot, and Rousseau in\r\nthis same all-absorbent Procope; Corot, Gérôme, Français, Jules Breton,\r\nBaudry, Harpignies, Garnier, Falguière, André Theuriet, and Edmond About\r\nat the _Café de Fleurus_; and Thérion, the original of the Elysée Mérant\r\nof Daudet’s _Rois en Exil_, Wallon, the original of Colline in Mürger’s\r\n_Vie de Bohème_, and Barbey d’Aurévilly, as famous for his\r\nlace-embroidered neckties and red-banded white trousers as for his\r\ncaustic wit, at the _Café Tabourey_.\r\n\r\nThe student’s lyric gift and _penchant_ for good fellowship find further\r\nvent in little cellar (_caveau_), back-room, or upper-room\r\n_café-concerts_[69] of his own founding, at which, in a congenial\r\natmosphere of tobacco and beer, he sings and recites to sympathetic\r\nlisteners _chansons_ and monologues of his own composition, and at which\r\nhe permits the _étudiante_, who almost invariably fancies herself\r\npredestined to a brilliant career on the operatic stage, to dispense, by\r\nway of interlude, the popular _risqué_ and sentimental songs of the day.\r\n\r\nThe editorial staffs of the ephemeral literary journals and reviews\r\n(_revues des jeunes_ and _journaux littéraires_) are so many mutual\r\nadmiration societies whose business meetings—there is so little\r\nbusiness to be done—are very apt to be banquets or _soirées\r\nlittéraires_. In fact, more than one sheet of the _Quartier_ has no\r\nother business office than the back room of the cabaret its editors\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nThese amateur publications (in which, for the matter of that, nearly\r\nevery one who counts in French literature has made his début) are not\r\nburdened with modesty. Witness the closing paragraph of the leading\r\neditorial of the first, last, and only number of the _Royal-Bohème_:—\r\n\r\n   “Our aim is to demand charity of those who, having\r\n   intelligence and heart, will not see in us a band of useless\r\n   beggars; our hope, to more than repay our benefactors with the\r\n   fruits of our thoughts and the flowers of our dreams.”\r\n\r\nFor a naïve and concrete statement of the revolutionist’s pet formula,\r\n“From every one according to his ability and to every one according to\r\nhis need,” or as an example of what would be called, in good American,\r\n“unmitigated nerve,” the above would be hard to match.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous writer has defined the Bohemian as “a person who sees with\r\nhis own eyes, hears with his own ears, thinks his own thoughts, follows\r\nthe lead of his own heart, and holds to the realities of life wherever\r\nthey conflict with its conventions.” The typical Bohemian student of\r\nParis is a Bohemian of this sort. He loves his comfort as well as\r\nanother fellow, but he is not ready to sell his soul for it. Material\r\nwell-being at the price of submission—moral, social, or political—he\r\nwill none of. Practical considerations do not count with him when\r\nthey antagonise his ideals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LATIN QUARTER TYPE]\r\n\r\nIn his monumental _Illusions Perdues_, Balzac describes at length a\r\nLatin Quarter _cénacle_ of nine persons, of which his hero, the poet\r\nLucien de Rubempré, became a member. Among other things, he says:—\r\n\r\n   “In this cold mansard the finest dreams of sentiment were\r\n   realised. Here brothers, all equally strong in different\r\n   regions of knowledge, enlightened each other in good faith,\r\n   telling one another everything, even their base thoughts,—all\r\n   of an immense instruction, and all tested in the crucible of\r\n   want.” Something of the beautiful earnestness of these ideal\r\n   and idealised Bohemians of Balzac has laid hold on the\r\n   Bohemian student of to-day. Like the members of this mansard\r\n   _cénacle_, he is seeking conscientiously and eagerly for a\r\n   comprehensive formula of life.\r\n\r\n   “The student is thinking,” writes an actual student, in answer\r\n   to the charges of materialism, dilettanteism, and subserviency\r\n   brought against the student body. “His thought is fermenting,\r\n   trying its force, preparing the future. The present hour is\r\n   grave, an hour of transition. In literature, in art, in\r\n   politics, something new is desired, expected, sought after.\r\n   Everywhere is chaos. Everywhere opposing elements clash. A\r\n   general synthesis or an exclusive choice from which harmony\r\n   may spring is called for. What are the laws of this synthesis,\r\n   what is the criterion of this choice? These are the questions\r\n   which, anxiously, without ceasing, and, perhaps, in spite of\r\n   himself, the contemporary youth is asking.”\r\n\r\nThere have been brief seasons when the whole university world—students\r\nand faculties alike—has been afflicted with intellectual snobbishness,\r\nindifference, discouragement, disillusion, fatigue, and even despair.\r\n\r\nThe present has its share of disillusion and discouragement, but it is\r\nprimarily a period of search. In the faculties, alongside of those\r\nfigure-heads—in which faculties always and everywhere have been\r\nrich—who cling tenaciously to whatever is ancient, respectable, and\r\ncommonplace, are men who are looking up and out.[70] M. Lavisse, for\r\ninstance, with his recurring emphasis on the necessity of a closer union\r\nof the university with the people, is a sort of second (and a more\r\nscientific) Michelet; and M. Lavisse has several colleagues who are\r\nlittle, if any, behind him in large suggestiveness. The thought-stirring\r\ninfluence of the disinterested, investigating zeal of Pasteur (and his\r\nsuccessors, Roux and Duclaux) and of Berthelot is also profound. A\r\nprovincial professor, M. Hervé, has recently been disciplined for\r\nunblushing anti-patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe _Collège Libre des Sciences Sociales_ (subsidised by the state) and\r\nthe _Ecole des Hautes Etudes Sociales_ have flung their doors wide open\r\nto socialism. Furthermore, this once descried doctrine has a hold on the\r\nuniversity itself. Just what the following of socialism is among the\r\nstudents, it is not possible, in the complete absence of reliable\r\nstatistics, to determine; but it is safe to say that it is large and\r\nfervent, since student socialists appear in convincing force at every\r\nimportant socialistic demonstration.\r\n\r\nAt the last anniversary of the “Bloody Week” of the Commune, in\r\nPère-la-Chaise I chanced upon two students wearing red eglantines in\r\ntheir buttonholes, with whom I had taken my meals for several weeks\r\nprevious without having been given the slightest intimation that they\r\nwere interested in social or political problems, to say nothing of being\r\nsocialists. The talk that resulted from this chance meeting revealed to\r\nme that they were actively affiliated with an important socialistic\r\norganisation, and that their convictions had marched fearlessly and far.\r\nThere are many such unproclaimed and unsuspected socialists in the\r\nQuarter.\r\n\r\nAnarchy also—that is, the philosophical type of anarchy so much in\r\nfavour in certain literary and artistic and even in certain scientific\r\ngroups—has an indefinite and fluctuating but extensive student\r\npenumbra.\r\n\r\nNo, the student’s noble aspirations have not all forsaken him. He\r\nabhors, as he has always abhorred, the prudish, the prudent, the\r\npolitic, the hypocritical, and the mean. He has not become hopelessly\r\nsubservient any more than he has become hopelessly morbid or hopelessly\r\nunsentimental. He can still resent dictation, as he can still laugh and\r\nlove. If he truckles to his professors in the matter of Greek and Latin\r\nroots, it is that Greek and Latin roots are subjects of supreme\r\nindifference to him. When his honest thinking and his deeper emotions\r\nare concerned, he is as recalcitrant as ever. He recognises no\r\nauthority, neither president nor prelate, general nor judge, nothing but\r\nhis own sense of truth and right.\r\n\r\nHe is thinking. What is more, he is ready to accept the logical\r\nconsequences of his thinking. When the time comes that these\r\nconsequences tally with action, he will act. He has the same imperious\r\nneed to act that he has to romp and to love. He looks to action—direct\r\naction, street action—for redress of wrong. He cannot help it: it is\r\nhis nature. Intensity is the primal law of his being and will out,\r\nthough he is merely telling a story, playing a joke, kissing a cheek, or\r\nsinging a song. He is not fifty, and he is French. He has the Quixotism,\r\nthe fine rashness, the sublime foolhardiness, of his years and of his\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nWith a mobility impossible for the Teuton or Anglo-Saxon to understand,\r\nbut which may be, notwithstanding, the highest form of self-control, he\r\npasses from vigorous frolic to vigorous work and _vice versa_\r\ninstantaneously. For him it is no farther from a laugh or a kiss to a\r\nbarricade than it is from a laugh to a kiss; and why should it be, when\r\nthe laugh, the kiss, and the barricade are (as they are with him),\r\nco-ordinate assertions of liberty? “Frivolous as a pistol bullet,” he\r\nflashes to his mark. Given the impact of provocation, he does not know\r\nwhat veering or wabbling means.\r\n\r\nSome contemporary—De Vogüé, I think—has said, “The student always\r\nrules those who think they are ruling him,” in which he resembles a\r\nwomanly woman; “and, when the critical moment comes, he resumes his\r\nliberty of action.”\r\n\r\nIf he has not been on a barricade in thirty years, it is because\r\nneither Boulangism, Dreyfusism,[71] Déroulèdism, nor anti-Combeism,\r\nthough he played some part in each, won, or deserved to win, his full\r\nallegiance. He has not taken the traditional chip off his shoulder,\r\nhowever, nor given any one permission to tread on his toes. On the\r\ncontrary, he has shown flashes of his old temper, even in the tranquil\r\nthird of a century just passed, often enough to leave no doubt of its\r\npersistence. It is only a little more than twenty years since the\r\n_Quartier_ was in an uproar by reason of a slanderous article on the\r\nstudents published in the _Cri du Peuple_ the day after the death of\r\nJules Vallès.\r\n\r\nIt is only a round fifteen years since the students, taking into their\r\nown hands the punishment of the _souteneurs_ of the _Quartier_, ducked a\r\nnumber of them in the frog-pond of the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nIt is only ten years since the students set all Paris and all France by\r\nthe ears because the government had interfered—unwarrantably, as they\r\nbelieved—with the immemorial usages of the _Quat’z’ Arts_ ball. The\r\n_Quartier_ was flooded with soldiers, blood was shed, and there was one\r\nlife lost. The students carried their point. Parliament intervened, and\r\nthe proceedings begun in the courts against the organisers of the ball\r\nwere dropped. What the consequences might otherwise have been no one can\r\ntell; but it is almost certain they would have been not local, but\r\nnational.\r\n\r\nIt is only six or seven years since it took a strong force of police to\r\ndefend against the wrath of the students the director of the _Ecole des\r\nArts Décoratifs_, whose offence was nothing more heinous than favouring\r\nthe sale, under school auspices, of the drawing materials, by dealing in\r\nwhich a medical student had hitherto earned the money to pursue his\r\nstudies; and this state of things lasted several days. And only a little\r\nover two years ago the students protested as vigorously against the\r\ncondemnation of Tailhade for his incendiary article in _Le Libertaire_\r\nas they had against the condemnation of Richepin for his _Chansons des\r\nGueux_ a quarter of a century before.\r\n\r\nIt was in a café of the Left Bank that French volunteers for\r\nthe Boer war were recruited; and it was most of all from the\r\nstudents, when Kruger came to Paris, that the ministry feared\r\nthe anti-British demonstrations that might bring international\r\ncomplications,—demonstrations which it craftily diverted by allowing\r\nthe student pro-Boer enthusiasm the fullest scope.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the Russian students by the Russian government\r\naroused among the students of Paris no little sympathy, which was given\r\nexpression in indignation meetings. It was probably quite as much the\r\ndread of the student displeasure as of the anarchist bomb that kept the\r\nczar on his last visit to France from entering Paris.\r\n\r\nThe above illustrations of the students’ irritability are the proverbial\r\nstraws that show which way the wind blows, and they might be multiplied\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nThere is no possible doubt of the student’s growing disgust with the\r\ncorruption and hypocrisy of the present republic,—this nominal\r\ndemocracy that is in reality a plutocracy,—nor of his slowly\r\ncrystallising resolution to have either something better than a republic\r\nor a better republic; and, in the long run, he always gets what he\r\nwants. The student strength is out of all proportion to the student\r\nnumbers. Let the students take their old place in the streets of the\r\n_Quartier_ to-morrow—5,000 or 500 strong—with a real rallying cry, and\r\nthrills of joy and shudders of apprehension will traverse the length and\r\nbreadth of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANTHEON]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   “_The Quarter knows that the student is its aristocracy,—an\r\n   aristocracy that gives more than it gets, against whom the\r\n   Carmagnole or the ‘Ça Ira’ could not be sung, whose spirit is\r\n   democratic and of the people._”\r\n\r\n    GILBERT PARKER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nBOHEMIANS OF THE LATIN QUARTER\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_It took a rugged faith in the future to pass the\r\n   evenings—without a fire—polishing verses, after having painted\r\n   all day long interminable registers._”—EMILE GOUDEAU, in Dix Ans\r\n   de Bohème.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_If an artist obeys the motive which may be called the natural\r\n   need of work, he deserves indulgence, perhaps, more than ever.

About\r\nthem, and quite as numerous as the thousands the university at any one\r\ntime enrolls, are gathered those students in the largest sense of the\r\nword—painters, sculptors, architects, poets, novelists, critics,\r\njournalists, historians, philosophers, philologists, scientists,\r\ninventors, and bibliophiles—who need the help of lectures, museums,\r\nlaboratories, and libraries in their daily tasks, or who, dependent on\r\nthat indefinable something called atmosphere for productiveness, can\r\nhardly conceive being at their scholarly or artistic best anywhere in\r\nthe world but in this particular corner of it which has given them their\r\ntraining and inspiration.\r\n\r\nAbout the university as a centre are also grouped those alumni who,\r\nquite independently of their callings, cling to the _Quartier_ as a\r\ncockney clings to the town for reasons gay or serious, trivial or\r\nweighty, fantastic or rational,—attachment to a lodging, a café, a\r\nclub, a restaurant, to the Luxembourg Gardens or the quays of the Seine,\r\nto book-stalls or shops of antiquities, to a chum or a mistress,—from\r\nany of the various motives of habit, taste, sentiment, or passion.\r\n\r\nFinally, the _Quartier_ retains those alumni who, cut off (whether by\r\nthe achievement of a degree or the failure to achieve one) from the\r\nconvenient parental remittances, are dismayed by the risks of a\r\npenniless plunge into the great, unfamiliar world. In the _Quartier_,\r\nwhere they are known, they can count on a modicum of credit for a\r\nmodicum of time from tailors, _restaurateurs_, and landlords, and on the\r\nunusurious loans of a little knot of friends. “One knows,” wrote\r\nRichepin, apropos of this matter, in his _Etapes d’un Réfractaire_,\r\n“that at such an hour in the rue de l’Ecole de Médecine or at the head\r\nof the rue Monsieur-le-Prince an easy-chair holds out its arms to him,\r\na tobacco pouch opens its heart to him, a friend lets him bellow his\r\nverses. These are so many consolations. What do I say? They are so many\r\nresources,—sometimes the only ones.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Quartier_, with these resources, a fellow will not starve in one\r\nmonth or two, as he might elsewhere. Besides, if the worst comes to the\r\nworst, there is the familiar and friendly Seine near by and the sweet,\r\nclean “Doric little morgue,” where he is bound to feel at home and where\r\nhe will be speedily recognised.\r\n\r\nA good proportion of these post-graduate denizens of the _Quarter_ are\r\neither by choice or by necessity Bohemians. To the former class\r\n(_Bohèmes par goût_) belongs my friend B——, whom for conveniences’ sake\r\nwe will call Berteil,—Gustave Berteil.\r\n\r\nIn a dingy hôtel of the rue Racine, just off the _Quartier’s_ highway,\r\nthe Boulevard St. Michel, in a room which costs perhaps forty francs a\r\nmonth, perhaps forty-five, and which has nothing about it to distinguish\r\nit from the room of a student who arrived in Paris yesterday, except for\r\na shelf of original and other editions of the elder French dramatists,\r\nM. Berteil (Gustave Berteil, simple Gustave to his friends), bachelor,\r\naged forty-three, has lived continuously ever since his salad days.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three years ago Gustave came up to Paris from a Provençal town,\r\nwhere his father was a wealthy notary, to prepare himself, in pursuance\r\nof the paternal desire, for admission to the bar. He was equipped with\r\nso much knowledge of life as the average provincial youth has at twenty,\r\nso much book knowledge as the average provincial _lycée_ affords, a\r\nclose acquaintance with the old French drama, for which the _lycée_\r\nwould have shuddered to be held accountable, and a consuming desire to\r\nwrite for the contemporary stage.\r\n\r\nDuring as many years as are ordinarily required for taking a degree in\r\nlaw, Gustave devoted the pleasant days to foraging for old dramatists in\r\nthe book-stalls and along the quays, the rainy days to play-writing and\r\nto perusing, repairing, and fondling his yellowed, tattered, worm-eaten\r\nacquisitions in his room,—where he had his meals served him,—and his\r\nevenings (whatever the weather) to the auditoriums or stage entrances of\r\nthe theatres and to the cafés where the _cabotins_ (actors) most do\r\ncongregate.\r\n\r\nHis relations to the law were limited, so far as is known, to the _bona\r\nfide_ purchase of expensive legal text books, which he invariably\r\nbartered, after a decent interval, for editions of his favourites,—a\r\ndevice, less ingenious than ingenuous, for at once quieting his\r\nconscience and obtaining larger remittances from home.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for Gustave (supposed young advocate) to return to\r\nthe Côte d’Azur and there assist his father in handling testaments and\r\ndeeds, he made a clean breast of it by post.\r\n\r\nThereupon the father cut off the son’s allowance, thinking thus “to\r\nstarve the rascal,” as he bluntly expressed it, “into submission.” He\r\nvery nearly succeeded in the starving part of his programme, as he\r\ndiscovered to his genuine horror,—for he was at bottom not a bad\r\npapa,—when, at the end of an anxious year without tidings from the boy,\r\nhe came to Paris and found his novel prodigal out at heels and elbows,\r\nhollowed in at stomach, and rickety at the knees; with absolutely\r\nnothing quite intact in fact about his person or surroundings—except\r\nthe shelf of old dramatists, which would easily have procured him food\r\nand fuel. Berteil _père_ was mollified, if sadly disillusionised, by\r\nthis ocular demonstration of pluck on the part of Berteil _fils_. He\r\nsettled on his unnatural offspring an allowance of 2,500 francs a year,\r\nto be trebled whenever he should abandon Bohemia for legitimate\r\nbusiness, and left him to live his own life in his own way.\r\n\r\nThis way has not turned out to be greatly different from the way of\r\nGustave’s nominal student days, and for at least ten years it has not\r\nvaried from one year to another by the value of a hair.\r\n\r\nEvery morning at ten, winter and summer, the hôtel garçon enters M.\r\nBerteil’s room, without rapping, to bring him his coffee and to inform\r\nhim of the weather. If the garçon reports that it is really\r\npleasant,—and the garçon knows from long experience, you may be sure,\r\nwhat M. Berteil considers really pleasant,—M. Berteil spends the day\r\nbook-hunting on the quays, where every _bouquineur_ and _bouquiniste_\r\ngreets him cordially as an old acquaintance. If the garçon’s weather\r\nbulletin is unfavourable, he orders his _déjeuner_ and dinner sent up to\r\nhis room, and spends the day in the society of his old dramatists and\r\nsuch of his friends, whose name is legion, as may chance to call. He\r\nstill haunts, evenings, as he did in the beginning, the cafés affected\r\nby the _cabotins_, with whom he passes for the most brilliant\r\nconversationalist on theatrical matters in or out of the “profession.”\r\nBut he abjured long ago theatre auditoriums and stage entrances, the\r\nlatter because he can now meet histrionic celebrities on an equal\r\nfooting, the former because he holds modern plays trash and modern\r\nmethods of interpreting old plays tinsel. He also put away long ago his\r\nyouthful, disquieting ambition to write for the contemporary stage,\r\nbecause he despaired of matching the old dramatists in their manner and\r\ndisdained the manner of the new.\r\n\r\nWhen he receives his monthly remittance of fr. 208.35, he gives the odd\r\ncentimes to the first street beggar he meets,—for luck,—and\r\nconsecrates fifty francs at once to a dinner with one or two of his\r\nintimates and the _amie_ of his law-student (?) days, who, still fair,\r\nthough “fat and forty,” is the prosperous proprietress of a little\r\nstationery shop in his street. The balance of the remittance amply\r\nsuffices him to live thirty days more in his modest fashion and to add a\r\nnew specimen or two to his collection of books.\r\n\r\nI do not know of a person whose life is organised more rationally,—I\r\nwould say scientically if Gustave did not abhor the word science and all\r\nits derivatives; and, in the teeth of the adage which warns us to call\r\nno man happy till he dies, I do not hesitate to say that Gustave Berteil\r\nis happy, and has been happy from the day of his reconciliation with his\r\nsire. Indeed, if I were asked to name the happiest man of my\r\nacquaintance, I should answer, “Gustave Berteil,” without a moment’s\r\npause.\r\n\r\nGustave, like the majority of the Bohemians from choice, was a Bohemian\r\nby necessity for a time; but the _Quartier_ has always had a sprinkling\r\nof brilliant, forceful personalities who have taken Bohemian vows\r\nwithout ever having had to consider the bread-and-butter question.\r\n\r\nSuch was the deceased artist Henri Pille (associated in his latter days\r\nwith Montmartre), whose appearance implied utter poverty, but who is\r\nsaid to have had landed property in a southern province which made the\r\nfluctuations of the picture market a matter of little concern to him.\r\n\r\nSuch is, or, perhaps, was, the poet Maurice Bouchor, to whom Richepin\r\ndedicated his virile volume, _Les Blasphèmes_. Bouchor, who now devotes\r\nalmost all his time and energy to the elevation of the working people\r\nthrough reading clubs and the _Universités Populaires_, is regarded by\r\nmany of his old associates as a renegade from Bohemia. He is confessedly\r\na renegade from many of its livelier and noisier pleasures, as his age\r\nand his gentle nature entitle him to be. But he still lives less\r\npretentiously than his means permit, is still “thinking his own\r\nthoughts, following the leadings of his own heart, and holding to the\r\nrealities of life where-ever they conflict with its conventions,” and so\r\nhas not entirely forfeited his claim, it is to be hoped, to be ranked\r\nwith the Bohemians of the Quarter.\r\n\r\nSuch also is Jean Richepin, in spite of his sumptuous establishment on\r\nthe Right Bank, a sort of Parisian Menelik, whose barbaric costumes and\r\naudacious exploits have entered as completely into the legendary lore of\r\nthe Quarter as the explosive inconsistencies of Jules Vallès and the\r\nalternate aspirings and back-slidings of Paul Verlaine. In the early\r\neighties, when he paraded the fantastic title of _Roi des Truands_ (King\r\nof the Vagrants), Richepin wore a talismanic bracelet and a\r\ncuriously-shaped hat, as badges of his rank. “There was even,” says his\r\nfellow-Bohemian, Emile Goudeau, “an epic struggle between Jean Richepin\r\nand the poor but great caricaturist André Gill [a Bohemian by necessity]\r\nas to which of the two would root out of the hatteries of Paris the most\r\nbizarre head-dress. Now Gill and now Richepin had the advantage. The\r\nillustrious Sapeck was the judge of last resort, and awarded the palm to\r\nthe victor.” It would take a long chapter to describe the costumes\r\nwhich have played a part in Richepin’s numerous and strange avatars. At\r\none time, if the narrative of a friend can be trusted, he remained in\r\nhiding for almost a fortnight because his wardrobe was reduced to a\r\nsimple window curtain; and his adventures have been so extraordinary\r\nthat this ludicrous incident, improbable as it sounds, does not defy\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEAN RICHEPIN]\r\n\r\nRichepin, Bouchor, and Paul Bourget, returning from “The Sherry Cobbler”\r\none night, halted under the arcade of the _Odéon_, named themselves _Les\r\nVivants_, and solemnly pledged each other eternal aid and fidelity. This\r\nwas the period when Bourget’s ambition was poetry, when he wore\r\npantaloons of water green, and imitated the miraculous cravats of Barbey\r\nd’Aurévilly and the mode of living of Balzac. “Bourget submitted\r\nhimself,” says Goudeau, “to a ferocious Balzacian régime. He dined very\r\nearly, went to bed immediately after, and had himself called on the\r\nstroke of 3 A.M..... The poet-recluse then drank two or three bowls of\r\nblack coffee, like Balzac, and, like Balzac, worked until seven. Then he\r\nslept again for an hour, rose, for good this time, and applied himself\r\nto the bread-winning activities which poverty imposes on young\r\nlittérateurs.”\r\n\r\nBourget, who began thus as a Bohemian from necessity, has ended as a\r\nsnob. He is a fair sample of the “_arrivé_” who disavows his past, and\r\n\r\n     “_Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\r\n       By which he did ascend._”\r\n\r\n   “I shall be adjudged severe, perhaps,” says the poet and\r\n   socialist deputy Clovis Hugues; “but I am of those who think\r\n   that the sacrifice of the _chevelure_ [long hair] is the most\r\n   dangerous of concessions to the modern _bourgeoisie_.... In\r\n   literature there is an affinity between the sudden\r\n   disappearance of the familiar mane and the forsaking of the\r\n   good comrades of the days of want. The transformation\r\n   effected, one may still have much _esprit_, but one has ceased\r\n   to be a good fellow. Beware, then, of the tribunes and the\r\n   poets who establish relations with the _garçons coiffeurs!_”\r\n\r\nI do not know that Bourget ever had any “_chevelure_” to leave in the\r\nhands of the Delilah of bourgeois respectability, but it would seem that\r\nhe had sacrificed on the altar of his parvenu-ship the sincere\r\nsoulfulness of which the “_chevelure_” as well as another thing may be\r\nthe visible symbol, since he apparently has no sympathy or helping hand\r\nfor his younger painter brother who is bravely struggling up to\r\nrecognition against heavy odds.\r\n\r\nEven the conceited “_arrivés_” of literature and the arts are entitled\r\nto a certain respect, especially when they have “arrived,” as has\r\nBourget, by force of genuine talent and persistent work. However\r\nridiculous the pretentious airs they assume, they are not cravens. They\r\nhave left Bohemia, but they have left it with colours flying, with all\r\nthe honours of war. As much cannot be said for the recreants,—called\r\nthe “_soumis_” or, still more expressively, the “_moutons_,”—who have\r\nforsaken Bohemia, without the excuse of having “arrived,” from sheer\r\npusillanimity, because they found its paths of hardship, struggle, and\r\nsacrifice too rugged in comparison with the easy highways of\r\nbourgeoisdom. Towards these one’s dominating sentiment can hardly be\r\nother than pity or contempt,—contempt, if they take greedily to the\r\nflesh-pots without regret at selling their souls to Mammon; pity, if\r\nthey do regret.\r\n\r\nRichepin, who knows this Bohemian world so well, has characterised the\r\ntwo varieties of “_moutons_.” Of the first (the unconscious “_moutons_,”\r\nso to speak) he says, “Having returned to the paternal roast, married\r\ntheir little cousins, and established themselves notaries in towns of\r\nthirty thousand inhabitants, they have the self-satisfaction of\r\nrehearsing before the fire their poor-artist adventures with the\r\nmagniloquence of a traveller who describes a tiger hunt”; and of the\r\nothers (the conscious “_moutons_”), “Wretchedly sad in the existence\r\ninto which they have entered against their wishes, in the intellectual\r\ntombs to which they have consigned themselves, they slowly atrophy. The\r\nbanal is particularly terrible in this,—that, if one returns to it\r\nafter having been disgusted with it, it is to find it more _banal_\r\nstill, and to die of it.”\r\n\r\nFew of the Bohemians who have been intimately associated with the\r\nQuarter during the last twenty-five or thirty years have been able to\r\nmake shift with their literature or their art alone. In order to keep\r\nbody and soul together, most have been constrained to resort to\r\ncompromises which are humiliating and disillusionising, but which are\r\nnot necessarily demoralising, and which stop a long way this side of\r\nabsolute surrender. Mallarmé taught English in the _lycées_ nearly all\r\nhis life, and conducted alone, during a short period, a journal entitled\r\n_La Dernière Mode_. Verlaine was long an employee of the _Hôtel de\r\nVille_, had periods of teaching, and even tried his hand at farming.\r\nEdmond Haraucourt,[72] Camille St. Croix, Léon Dierx, Emile Goudeau,\r\nCanqueteau, and Trimouillat have been at one time or another petty\r\nfunctionaries. Nearly all have dabbled in journalism. The happiest\r\ncompromise, however, the most independent form of dependence, so to say,\r\nhas been hit upon by Jacques Le Lorrain, poet and author of _L’Au Delà_,\r\nwho set up as a cobbler in 1896 in the rue du Sommerard, close by the\r\nCluny Museum.[73]\r\n\r\nIt is no infrequent thing for the loyal Bohemian to “arrive” too late\r\nto profit by his success because his spirit has been imbittered or his\r\nconstitution ruined by the hardships he has undergone.\r\n\r\n   “The maimed heart, the heart poniarded in this mute struggle\r\n   for life,” says Jules Vallès in his _Réfractaires_, “cannot be\r\n   taken out of the chest and replaced by another. There are no\r\n   wooden hearts in the market. It remains there, bleeding, the\r\n   poniard at its centre. Rich one day, famous, perhaps, these\r\n   victims of obscure combats may perfume their sores if they\r\n   will, sponge up the blood, wipe away their tears; memory will\r\n   tear open the wounds, strip off the bandages. A word, a\r\n   song,—joyous or sad,—will be enough to raise in these sick\r\n   souls the phantom of the past.”\r\n\r\nJehan Rictus more recently, in his terrible _Soliloques du Pauvre_, has\r\nexpressed the same thought in another fashion:—\r\n\r\n   _“Même si qu’un jour j’ tornais au riche\r\n       Par un effet de vot’ Bonté,\r\n    Ce jour-là j’ f’rai mett’e une affiche,\r\n       On cherche à vendre un cœur gâté.”_\r\n\r\nThe following poem embodies the experience of a Latin Quarter Bohemian\r\nwhose hard-won victory came too late because his health was gone:—\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n   _Do you remember, Marguerite,\r\n    How first we met in the Latin Quarter?\r\n    I was a poet, far from gay,\r\n    And you, well, you were—somebody’s daughter.\r\n    You dropped a glove upon the curb,—\r\n    Say, was it Fate or yourself who willed it?\r\n    I picked it up, a natural thing,\r\n    Laid it within the hand that had filled it.\r\n   “Merci, monsieur,” was all you said;\r\n    But, somehow, I knew from your tone, as you said it,\r\n    That, if I kept the hand awhile,\r\n    It would not count to my discredit.\r\n    So, hand in hand, we strolled and we chatted,\r\n    Happy as pups whose heads have been patted.\r\n    We drank a bock on the Saint Michel;\r\n    And, when we parted, I knew you so well\r\n    That I even dropped the “Mademoiselle.”\r\n    Do you remember I whispered low,\r\n    As I gazed in your eyes, so dark, so sweet,\r\n        “A bientôt, Marguerite,\r\n         Au revoir and à bientôt”?_\r\n\r\n\r\n    II\r\n\r\n   _Do you remember, Marguerite,\r\n    How we rubbed along in the Latin Quarter?\r\n    I Roland, the poet, almost gay,\r\n    And you, my mistress and—somebody’s daughter?\r\n    There were only a bed and a chair or two\r\n    In our tiny chamber under the mansard;\r\n    But our thoughts were simple, our hearts were true,\r\n    Something in each to the other answered.\r\n    Fresh youth was there, and love was there,\r\n    My hopes were strong, your face was fair;\r\n    And we lived and loved as devoted a pair\r\n    As ever old Paris sheltered.\r\n    In a worn béret and a faded blouse,\r\n    I scribbled for fame.

His father having decided to put him to the carpenter’s\r\ntrade, Joseph, who had no notion of becoming a mechanic, went secretly\r\nto the Free School of Design. The professor of the school procured him a\r\nplace as pupil with a government architect, which his father, under the\r\nimpression that carpentry and architecture were very much the same\r\nthing, allowed him to accept. Joseph made such progress that he paid his\r\nway at the end of a month, and at the end of six months earned his seven\r\nor eight francs a day. But he was getting no nearer to sculpture by this\r\nwork; and he left the architect’s office, in the face of his father’s\r\nopposition, and entered a sculptor’s atelier for study, paying a month\r\nin advance for his teaching. He took part in a competition for admission\r\nto the _Beaux-Arts_, and failed. Having no money with which to pay for\r\nlessons, he was forced to leave the atelier, but was received—about the\r\nonly bit of good luck in his whole career—by the great master, Rude. He\r\nlodged at this time in the rue du Cherche-Midi, over a cow stable, where\r\nhe was warmed only by what heat ascended through a hole in the floor.\r\n\r\nFinding he could not pay for the models and materials necessary to enter\r\nthe _Salon_ competitions, he assisted for a year, without entirely\r\nneglecting his studies, a noted ornament-worker, and put by enough to\r\nenable him to pursue his art studies to good advantage. Working by\r\nnight in a cold workshop, he contracted a sickness which confined him to\r\nhis bed for a time, and which swept away all his savings. As soon as he\r\nwas well again, he went back to work for his first employer (the\r\narchitect), designing ornaments whose execution was intrusted to others.\r\nHe thus gained a little pile—about 1,200 francs—with which to compete\r\nfor the _Salon_. It was stolen by a roof-worker who, while repairing an\r\nadjacent building, had seen him counting it.\r\n\r\nThis “mischance”—to go on in Mürger’s own language—“was a terrible\r\nblow to Joseph. ‘There are some people who have no luck,’ he said, ‘who\r\nwould lose with all the trumps of the pack in their hands.’ ‘Never\r\nmind,’ he resumed, brightening, ‘I will attempt the assault of the\r\nLouvre[74] with what little I have left. I will enter there with plaster\r\ninstead of bronze or marble.’”\r\n\r\nAll his courage had returned. He tried making fanciful statuettes, which\r\nhe could prepare without the expense of hiring models; but he had little\r\nsuccess in selling them.\r\n\r\n   “_La Misère_ returned, and knocked at his door. She entered,\r\n   terrible and pitiless, like a vanquished foe whose turn has\r\n   come to triumph, and who uses without mercy the right of\r\n   reprisal. Joseph’s destitution reached such a point that, when\r\n   one of his friends invited him to dinner, he answered naïvely,\r\n   ‘I’m afraid it will put me out: it’s not my day.’ For tobacco\r\n   he smoked walnut leaves, which he gathered in the forest of\r\n   Verrières, then dried, and chopped up fine.\r\n\r\n   “His sole hope was the coming _Salon_. In a room without a\r\n   fire,”—the odorous days of the calorific cow stable must have\r\n   seemed a paradise in retrospect,—“in a Siberian temperature,\r\n   he worked during three consecutive months on a Saint Antoine,\r\n   for he had been forced to renounce his group of Galatea, the\r\n   too costly execution of which he had deferred to better times.\r\n   Clay, in spite of its moderate cost, was too dear for his\r\n   empty purse, this same purse which had held almost a fortune;\r\n   for, by a strange irony, the thief who had taken his money had\r\n   left him his purse. He dug his clay himself, therefore, in\r\n   some fields of the _banlieue_. A rag-picker of the rue\r\n   Mouffetard whom he had met, I know not where, gave him\r\n   sittings at five sous an hour; and three-quarters of the time\r\n   the worthy man invented angelic ruses to avoid being paid.\r\n\r\n   “The date set for sending to the _Salon_ was near. It was time\r\n   to think of taking the plaster cast of the statue. Michelli,\r\n   Fontaine, and the other moulders who worked for the artists,\r\n   when they saw Joseph’s destitution, were unwilling to venture\r\n   credit. All he could obtain from one of them was the\r\n   furnishing of the necessary plaster. Aided by several friends,\r\n   Joseph took the cast of his statue himself. The operation\r\n   lasted two days, and turned out well.\r\n\r\n   “It was the eve of the day on which the jury was to begin its\r\n   sittings and on which the works to be passed upon must be at\r\n   the Louvre, by midnight at the very latest. During the night\r\n   it came on cold, and Joseph, to minimise the action of the\r\n   frost upon his statue, the still damp plaster of which had not\r\n   acquired the solidity which dryness gives, wrapped his only\r\n   blanket about it, and piled up on it, as a cuirass of warmth\r\n   against the darts of the cold, all his clothing, playing thus,\r\n   towards Saint Antoine, the rôle of Saint Martin.\r\n\r\n   “The next forenoon two or three friends came to aid Joseph in\r\n   transporting his statue to the Louvre. The wagon arrived four\r\n   hours too late. Nor was this all. At this point, fatality\r\n   intervened in the person of an absurd _concièrge_, who\r\n   declared that he would let nothing leave Joseph’s room before\r\n   the back rent was paid. The artists explained to the\r\n   _concièrge_ that a statue was not a piece of furniture, and\r\n   that the law did not permit him to hold it back. He would not\r\n   listen to reason, and, stony in his stubbornness, demanded a\r\n   written permit from the landlord. They hurried to Passy, where\r\n   the landlord lived, and did not find him. He would not be in\r\n   before dinner. They returned at the dinner hour. He had just\r\n   gone out. It was already eight o’clock in the evening. They\r\n   decided to apply to a justice of the peace. The justice turned\r\n   them over to the commissary of police, who began by sustaining\r\n   the _concièrge_, but who decided, on Joseph’s representations\r\n   of the injury that would be done him if he were made to miss\r\n   the _Salon_, to authorise the removal of the statue. It was\r\n   then eleven o’clock. They had barely an hour to get to the\r\n   Louvre. A dangerous coating of thin ice rendered the streets\r\n   impracticable. Vehicles could only advance at a walk. The\r\n   artists needed three hours at least, and they had only one.\r\n   Furthermore, repairs which were being made on the sewers\r\n   forced them to take the longest route. In crossing the\r\n   Pont-Neuf, Joseph and his friends heard it strike the\r\n   half-hour.\r\n\r\n   “‘It’s half-past eleven,’ said Joseph, who was sweating great\r\n   drops in spite of the fact that the thermometer marked a\r\n   north-pole temperature.\r\n\r\n   “‘It’s half-past twelve,’ volunteered a young man who detached\r\n   himself from a band of painters who were returning with their\r\n   pictures because they had arrived at the Louvre too late. They\r\n   were making the best of it, and were singing gaily,\r\n   ‘_Allons-nous-en, gens de la noce! etc._’\r\n\r\n   “Joseph and his friends retraced their steps.\r\n\r\n   “A little later Joseph exposed his Saint Antoine and a\r\n   statuette of Marguerite at the _Exposition du Bazar Bonne\r\n   Nouvelle_ (corresponding to the modern _Salon des Réfusés_),\r\n   and sold the two to the Museum of Compiègne for 150 francs.\r\n\r\n   “This paltry sum enabled him to drag himself about some\r\n   time,—a year almost. Then he entered the hospital through the\r\n   intervention of an interne, for he had no characterised\r\n   malady. He died there of exhaustion at the end of three\r\n   months....\r\n\r\n   “Joseph D—— died at the age of twenty-three, without rancour\r\n   or recrimination against the art that had killed him, as a\r\n   brave soldier falls on the field of battle, saluting his\r\n   flag.”\r\n\r\nIf I have reproduced here with much fulness this old story of Mürger’s,\r\nit is because Joseph D—— stands to the Bohemians of the _Quartier_ as\r\na kind of saint, _Saint Joseph de la Dèche_,[75] patron of poor artists,\r\nand because the half-century during which civilisation is supposed to\r\nhave been advancing with enormous strides has made no appreciable\r\ndifference in the hardships of the needy artist or in the bravery with\r\nwhich he faces them. Parents are still too often dull-witted, narrow,\r\nand unsympathetic where their offspring are concerned. Rents are still\r\nhard to pay, and art materials and models, food, clothes, and fuel hard\r\nto be had just when they are most needed. Luck is as capricious, the\r\n_concièrge_ as officious, winter as brutal, warmth as coy, and death as\r\nchary of reprieves as ever. Joseph D—— is as strictly up to date as if\r\nhe had been born in 1881 and died in 1904. One hesitates to depict the\r\nslow starvation of one’s acquaintances and friends, even under assumed\r\nnames; and the fateful career of Mürger’s Joseph is so perfectly typical\r\nof the careers of the poor devils of artists in the _Quartier_ of the\r\npresent period that there is no necessity of depicting it.\r\n\r\nQuite as terrible, though far less romantic than the _misère_ of the\r\nBohemian artist and littérateur, is the “_misère en habit noir_”—the\r\nnomenclature is Balzac’s—of the patientless doctor, the briefless\r\nbarrister, and the unemployed or underpaid teacher and professor.\r\n\r\nYour poet, your painter, or your sculptor, is, as a rule, a careless,\r\njolly dog, who has something of the genuine vagabond or adventurer in\r\nhim. He cannot tolerate anything that is cut and dried, not even\r\nprosperity; and he would be infinitely bored by life if its elements of\r\nuncertainty were quite eliminated. He prefers agreeable surprises to\r\ndisagreeable surprises, of course; but he prefers disagreeable surprises\r\nto no surprises at all.\r\n\r\nDissimulation is not an indispensable part of his artistic baggage. He\r\nmay flaunt and vaunt his poverty, swear at it or make game of it, and be\r\nnone the less considered, at least in his _milieu_. He is excused from\r\nplaying the dismal farce of keeping up appearances. He may live in an\r\nattic, clothe himself in tattered and seedy raiment, shirk the\r\nbath-tub, ignore the very existence of the laundress and the barber, be\r\nnoisy and reckless, and defy all the canons of the social code without\r\nstultifying himself or dishonouring his calling. Best of all, his life\r\nis rarely a lonely one. He suffers, but he has the _camaraderie_ of\r\nsuffering; and this enables him to laugh or shout his misery away.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, your so-called professional man—your physician, for\r\ninstance—must be more than decently lodged; be arrayed, at no matter\r\nwhat hour of the day,—such is the Old World convention,—in a faultless\r\nfrock-coat and silk hat; be restrained, not to say dignified, in\r\ndemeanour; assume to be busy when he is weary unto death with\r\ninaction,—and all this though hunger be consuming his very vitals.\r\n\r\nHe must button his suffering securely under his respectable black\r\nwaistcoat, and wear his professional complacence when his heart is torn\r\nwith sobs. If the reputable lodging or the reputable bearing fail him,\r\neven for a little, he is lost irrevocably.\r\n\r\nFour years ago or thereabouts a young physician, one Dr. Laporte, was\r\narraigned before a Paris court for criminal negligence in the practice\r\nof his profession. The court condemned him to prison, in spite of the\r\ntestimony of an eminent specialist in his favour, but with the\r\npalliative of the _Loi Bérenger_.[76]\r\n\r\nThe condemnation was based on these facts: Summoned to an emergency case\r\nalready compromised by lay treatment, and not possessing the surgical\r\ninstrument which it called for, Dr. Laporte cast around for a makeshift\r\ntool. He used unsuccessfully the only thing in any way adapted to his\r\npurpose that he discovered in the patient’s house; and then, finding his\r\nefforts futile, and foreseeing the fatal issue, which was not slow to\r\narrive, he withdrew, saying there was nothing more to be done.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the attachment of clemency to the sentence were these:\r\nthe evidence showed conclusively that he had had no patients for days\r\nand perhaps weeks; that he had no money to keep in proper repair the\r\ninstruments he owned, to say nothing of buying the instrument in\r\nquestion; and that he had not eaten a morsel of food for a full day\r\nprevious to the emergency visit, and was a prey to the giddiness of\r\nhunger at the moment he made his deplorable attempt.\r\n\r\n   “The police investigation,” said the presiding judge to the\r\n   culprit while the trial was in progress, “shows you as\r\n   nervous, excitable, unbalanced, passing quickly from a state\r\n   of exaltation to a state of the most profound depression.”\r\n   What wonder!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOUVRE]\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_They are logical in their insane heroism, they utter neither\r\n   cries nor plaints, they endure passively the obscure and\r\n   rigorous destiny which they allot themselves.

Unfortunately,\r\n   the purse was quickly emptied, and the drama was refused by\r\n   all the theatre managers.\r\n\r\n   “As his father was not rich, Louis M—— was unwilling to appeal\r\n   to him, and suffered without complaining.\r\n\r\n   “One day, however, he confessed his desperate situation to\r\n   Mme. C——, a friend of his family, who inhabits a comfortable\r\n   apartment, rue ——. Mme. C—— promised to see what she could do\r\n   for him. In the midst of a conversation with her yesterday he\r\n   drew a revolver from his pocket, and before she could catch\r\n   his arm fired a bullet into his heart.\r\n\r\n   “Death was instantaneous.”\r\n\r\nEmile Goudeau, in his _Dix Ans de Bohème_, tells of the picturesque\r\nsuicide of a young Latin Quarter poet of his acquaintance:—\r\n\r\n   “D——, arrayed in a new suit and with his hands full of\r\n   bouquets, went up to the cashier’s desk and graciously adorned\r\n   the counter and corsage of the cashier. Then, turning to a\r\n   medical student, he said to him nonchalantly, ‘My dear fellow,\r\n   I have made a bet that the little point of the heart is _here_\r\n   between these two ribs’; and he designated a spot on his\r\n   vest. ‘Not at all,’ corrected the other, ‘it is lower down.\r\n   _There!_’ ‘I have lost then,’ D—— replied.\r\n\r\n   “He called a cab, and ordered the _cocher_ to drive him to the\r\n   Arc de Triomphe.\r\n\r\n   “When the _cocher_ arrived at the head of the Champs Elysées,\r\n   and opened the cab door, there was only a corpse upon the\r\n   cushions. D—— had shot himself full in the heart.”\r\n\r\nThe last season I passed on the Left Bank of the Seine, the _Quartier_\r\nwas deeply moved by the death of one of its faithful devotees, the poet\r\nRené Leclerc (_nom-de plume_, Robert de la Villoyo), who poisoned\r\nhimself with cyanide of potassium.\r\n\r\nLeclerc was thirty-two at the time of his death. He had inhabited the\r\n_Quartier_ for more than a decade. He had come thither to study medicine\r\nin accordance with the wishes of his bourgeois parents; and he had\r\nstayed on after all thought of practising as a physician had left him,\r\nin order to pursue the literature which had become his passion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Suicide of the Latin Quarter]\r\n\r\nWith the funds which his family provided he lived neither too well nor\r\ntoo ill, working steadily, but gaining little, slowly developing a very\r\nreal, if not very robust, talent. He completed two romances, contributed\r\nmore or less regularly to _La Plume_ and the minor reviews and literary\r\nweeklies of the Left Bank, which are the easier to enter since\r\ncontributors are paid nothing at all or very little, and placed an\r\noccasional poem and _chronique_ in the daily press. Indeed, everything\r\nwent well with him up to the moment when his family, disgruntled at his\r\npersistency in holding to so unprofitable a calling, deprived him of his\r\nincome. Then he set out bravely to earn his living with his pen. He\r\nbesieged editors with copy, but succeeded in placing but few articles;\r\nand, when he did place them, he was more often than not kept waiting for\r\nhis pay, and sometimes defrauded out of it altogether. He tried in vain\r\nto find a publisher for either of his two manuscript romances. He did\r\ndifficult and ill-paid hack-work, collaborating on a translation into\r\nFrench of the Norwegian Strindberg and on an adaptation into French\r\nverse of the _Mandragore_ of Machiavelli; and he undertook—oh, the\r\nbitter pill!—the task of writing a volume on the _Côte d’Ivoire_, of\r\nwhich he was as ignorant as he was of the borders of the supposititious\r\ncanals of the planet Mars. Even this concession to mercantilism—beyond\r\nwhich it is not surprising he was unwilling to go—did not suffice to\r\nprocure him a living. He ran behind two quarters on his rent, and was\r\nthreatened with eviction. If not actually destitute, he was on the verge\r\nof destitution. And yet to those who were familiar with René Leclerc’s\r\nproud and sensitive spirit it seems more likely that it was disgust with\r\nhis lot rather than terror before the approach of want which drove him\r\nto kill himself. It was because he held his art so high that he was\r\nunwilling to survive its debasement. He had made concessions that he\r\nregarded as enormous,—compromised his ideal, vulgarised his taste, and\r\nprostituted (at least so it seemed to him) his talent. It was too much.\r\nHis last act-could a dying gesture well be finer?—was to reduce to\r\nashes the hateful manuscript of the _Côte d’Ivoire_ and all his other\r\nwritings that he held unworthy.\r\n\r\nAnd journalists were found contemptible enough to censure him, to call\r\nhim coward, because he was too fastidious to stoop to their own corrupt,\r\ndegrading practices, even to save his life.\r\n\r\nAmong the works he left, as having his affection and which by one of\r\nthose ironies so common with the law went to his unappreciative family\r\n(who might have saved him), was a collection of sweet and delicate\r\npoems, entitled _La Guirlande de Marie_, dedicated to her who had shared\r\nhis prosperity and remained the faithful friend of his adversity.\r\n\r\nHere are a few stanzas (from a poem of this collection) inscribed to\r\nHenry Mürger, in which he sings the praises of the Bohemia by which he\r\ndied:—\r\n\r\n   _Les gais amoureux et les amoureuses\r\n    Ont depuis des ans, Mürger, déserté\r\n    La mansarde étroite où leurs voix rieuses\r\n    Narguaient le bon sens—et la pauvreté!_\r\n\r\n   _L’amour, aujourd’hui, s’est fait plus morose;\r\n    Schaunard est rentier, Colline est bourgeois,\r\n    Les lauriers coupés, et mortes les roses,\r\n    Ils ont désappris les chemins du bois._\r\n\r\n   _Rodolphe et Mimi, Marcel et Musette,\r\n    Dans leurs lits bien clos sont endormis;\r\n    Mais, vivante encor, leur chanson coquette\r\n    Eveille en nos vers des refrains amis;_\r\n\r\n   _Nos rèves, vois-tu, sont restés les mêmes:\r\n    Roses du matin, rires du printemps,\r\n    Châteaux en Espagne ou parcs en Bohème\r\n    Irréels ou vrais,—comme de ton temps!_\r\n\r\n   _Nous marchons leur pas, nous aussi, sans trève.\r\n    Vers quel but lointain? Nous n’en savons rien;\r\n    Baste! Il faut toujours que route s’achève.\r\n    Quand nous y serons, nous le verrons bien._\r\n\r\n   _Peu d’argent en poche, et point de bagages,\r\n    Nul regret d’antan pour nous chagriner,\r\n    Nous sommes parés pour les longs voyages,\r\n    Libres: rien à perdre, et tout à gagner!_\r\n\r\nAnd here is a portion of a poem, “_Le Sabot de Noël_,” that is a sort of\r\nplayful prayer:—\r\n\r\n   _Mets dans mon sabot de Noël\r\n    Le jeune espoir qui nous fait libre,\r\n    Mets le désir profond de vivre\r\n    Et la fleur qui fleurit au ciel._\r\n\r\n   _Mets le succès dans les efforts,\r\n    Le travail sans souci ni doute,\r\n    Et comme étoile sur ma route\r\n    L’orgueil simple qui fait les forts._\r\n\r\nPoor boy! It was this very “_orgueil simple_” that was his sad undoing.\r\n\r\n   “If the artist,” says Balzac in a memorable passage of his\r\n   _Cousine Bette_, “does not hurl himself into his work, like\r\n   Curtius into the gulf, without reflecting, and if, in this\r\n   crater, he does not dig like a miner buried under a\r\n   land-slide, ... his work perishes in the atelier, where\r\n   production becomes impossible; and he assists at the suicide\r\n   of his talent.”\r\n\r\nRené Leclerc, though no mere dawdler, as the twelve sizable manuscripts\r\nhe left behind him prove, was not endowed with either the mental or the\r\nphysical endurance to perform the Herculean labour which Balzac both\r\npreached and practised. No more was Louis M—— nor D——; no more was\r\nthe brilliant Gérard de Nerval, who was found one winter morning in the\r\nrue de la Vieille Lanterne hanging from a window-bar, nor the precocious\r\nEscousse and Lebras, who at nineteen and sixteen respectively killed\r\nthemselves because a first phenomenal success with a drama was followed\r\nby failures; no more was Chatterton in England. Few artists are. With\r\nmost of them ample time for revery is a prerequisite condition of\r\nproduction. And yet the record seems to show that suicides are\r\nrelatively rare among poets and artists.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is because the record does not occupy itself with the poets\r\nand artists, the Louis M——s and the D——s, who are not known as such\r\nto the world at large. Or, perhaps, it is because so many die in the\r\nhospital, like Gilbert, Malfilâtre, Hégésippe Moreau, and the Joseph\r\nD—— of Mürger’s tale; and so many others are claimed by Charenton,\r\nlike Jules Jouy, Toulouse de Lautrec, and André Gill (for bedlam is\r\nanother Bohemian resort), that suicide has no need to assert its rights.\r\nIn any event, two cardinal qualities of the artistic temperament are\r\ndistinctly hostile to self-destruction; namely, faith in the sure\r\nemergence and supremacy of genius, and a Hamlet-like irresolution that\r\nprefers pouring out woes on paper to ending them by an energetic\r\ntrigger-pull.\r\n\r\nThe despair of the victims of the _misère en habit noir_, who are less\r\nable to sustain themselves by faith and who are more capable of decisive\r\naction, is, like their dress, much blacker and more austere; and\r\nsuicides are far commoner among them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PONT DU CARROUSEL AT NIGHT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFREAKS AND “FUMISTES”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_If there is a fill of tobacco among the crew, for God’s sake\r\n   pass it round and let us have a pipe before we go._”—ROBERT LOUIS\r\n   STEVENSON.\r\n\r\n   “_‘Lord, my dear,’ returned he, with the utmost good humour, ‘you\r\n   seem immensely chagrined; but, hang me, when the world laughs at\r\n   me, I laugh at all the world, and so we are even.’_”\r\n\r\n   OLIVER GOLDSMITH, Beau Tibbs at Home.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Stupeur du badaud, gaîté du trottin,\r\n     Le masque à Sardou, la gueule à Voltaire,\r\n     La tignasse en pleurs sur maigres vertèbres\r\n     Et la requimpette au revers fleuri\r\n     D’horribles bouquets pris à la poubelle,\r\n     Ainsi se ballade à travers Paris\r\n     Du brillant Montmartre au Quartier-Latin\r\n     Bibi-la-Purée, le pouilleux célèbre,\r\n     Prince des crasseux et des Purotains._”\r\n\r\n     JEHAN RICTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Much good might be sucked from these beggars._”—CHARLES LAMB.\r\n\r\n   “Mieux vaut goujat debout qu’empereur enterré.”—EMILE GOUDEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dislike of and contempt for the bourgeois felt by the Bohemian\r\nstudents and the other Bohemians who have elected to reside in the\r\n_Quartier Latin_ pale into insignificance before the absolute\r\ndetestation of the bourgeois displayed by the _Quartier’s chevaliers\r\nd’industrie_, the hangers-on and camp-followers of its littérateurs and\r\nartists, who bear about the same relation to their principals that a\r\nside-show bears to a circus or the capering monkey to the hand-organ and\r\nits grinder.\r\n\r\nAs the lackey of the nobleman often holds himself above the commoner far\r\nmore than does the nobleman himself, and as he will rather put up with\r\npoor living and poor wages in the service of an indigent aristocrat than\r\ndemean himself by serving in the households of tradesmen, so these\r\nne’er-do-wells of the _Quartier Latin_—ragged retainers of the\r\nthreadbare gentry of arts and letters, pinched flunkeys of the\r\nstraightened lords of thought, seedy clients of needy Latin patricians,\r\ntatterdemalion cup-bearers to tattered Parnassians, supernumeraries to\r\nthe protagonists in the melodrama of cultured poverty, chorus to the\r\nsoloists of the _Learned Beggars’ Opera_—would be humiliated and\r\nmiserable outside of the atmosphere of letters. They would rather be\r\ndoor-keepers, to paraphrase a familiar text, in the house of the\r\nintellectual _élite_ than to dwell in the tents of vulgarity.\r\n\r\nIf there is more comedy and less tragedy in the existences of these\r\nsatellites than in the existences of their controlling luminaries, it is\r\nnot because their physical hardships are fewer,—for, parasites,\r\nsycophants, trencher-friends, pick-thanks, and toad-eaters though they\r\nbe, theirs is but sorry hap,—but because they are mostly ambitionless\r\nor feeble-minded and so not as susceptible to the mental torture of\r\ndisenchantment.\r\n\r\nThey “carry the half of their mattresses in their hair,” after the\r\nfashion of the nephew of Rameau described by Diderot. They don the\r\ncast-off garments and retail the worn-out epigrams of their _fétiches_,\r\nwho are amused by and therefore endlessly indulgent of them. They strut\r\nand smirk and rant like children masquerading in the attic frippery of\r\ntheir elders, make as clever displays of superficial knowledge as the\r\nmost up-to-date members of the most up-to-date women’s clubs, and revert\r\nconstantly to a previous connection with the university which is not\r\nalways imaginary. As individuals, these pseudo-connoisseurs and savants\r\ncome and go in the _Quartier Latin_: the class goes on forever.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of persons still living in the Latin Quarter who knew\r\nthe originals of the eccentric _Quartier_ types immortalised by Jules\r\nVallès in his phenomenal _Réfractaires_.\r\n\r\nFontan-Crusoe, a genuine bachelor of arts, who slept one hundred and\r\neleven consecutive nights under a tree near the fortifications, spent\r\nfor nourishment from three to five sous a day which he earned by selling\r\nin the street his two principal works, _Le Spectre Noir: Elégie_ and _Un\r\nGalop à travers l’Espace_.\r\n\r\nPoupelin, called also “_Mes Papiers_,” he of the enormous yellow felt,\r\n“_pantalon d’enfant_,” and “_redingote de centennaire_,” who spent his\r\ntime seeking titled office and recommendations therefor, when\r\nhe was not occupied in one of the three positions which he accepted\r\nwith equal alacrity and in which he was equally efficient,—or\r\ninefficient,—namely, teacher, school usher, and cook.\r\n\r\nAnd M. Chaque, “_Orientaliste_,” another genuine _bachelier_, who had a\r\nuseful habit of carrying rice pudding in his hat and omelettes and beef\r\n_à la mode_ in his pockets,—ex-professor of a colonial school; author\r\nof a volume of travels in Greece (published by a reputable firm) with\r\nwhich he beset Greek enthusiasts orally and successfully; a constant\r\nreader of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, to which he had, once on a time,\r\ncontributed an article; communicant of all the Christian or pagan sects\r\nthat had churches or temples in Paris; privileged hanger-on of\r\ngaming-houses and soldiers’ barracks; razor-sharpener and professional\r\nweeper at the cemetery of Montparnasse.\r\n\r\nTwo vagrant types (equally grotesque with those of Vallès), who are now\r\ndead, but whom one need not have been long associated with the\r\n_Quartier_ to remember, were Eugène Cochet and Amédée Cloux.\r\n\r\nCochet was an ex-prefect of the Department of the Eure, a rhymester and\r\nthe author of an unpublished work of “philosophical reflections,” who\r\ndepended for his sustenance on the bounty of one or two restaurants and\r\nthe _soupes populaires_, and who had a mania for decorations, like\r\nPoupelin. The students, who made Cochet the butt of a great deal of\r\ngood-natured chaffing, which he accepted gratefully as so much tribute\r\nto his worth, formally invested him one day with the star of the Legion\r\nof Honour (attached to a flaming red cravat) and with the insignia of\r\nten fantastic foreign orders, notably with that of the Garter and that\r\nof the Green Elephant, which last consisted of a zinc elephant, painted\r\ngreen, suspended from a bailiff’s chain.\r\n\r\nAmédée Cloux, poet, emulated the literary forgeries of Chatterton at\r\ncloser range. He had a marvellous facility for copying poetic styles,\r\nand he got his living for a time by the deaths of his more illustrious\r\nbrother poets. As soon as a well-known poet died, he produced imitations\r\nof his poetry, which he sold as posthumous works. His most successful\r\nefforts, “_Le Chien Mort_,” attributed by him to Baudelaire, and “_Plus\r\nde Représailles_” and “_L’Ode à la Colonne Déboulonnée_,” purporting to\r\nbe by Eugène Vermesch, deceived both the public and the experts until\r\nthe good Cloux, who was more of a joker than a vulgar swindler,\r\nacknowledged his ruse.\r\n\r\nOf the freaks who now perch in (for they can hardly be said to inhabit)\r\nthe _Quartier Latin_, far and away the most famous is Bibi-la-Purée,\r\n\r\n   “_Qui porte en son cœur un vaste mépris\r\n     Pour quiconque n’est Bohème ni poète._”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Parisian of the period, perhaps, has been more written about, and\r\nnone more photographed, sculptured, etched, and painted; and none has\r\ndone more to divert his time than Bibi. Bibi is by turns an artist’s\r\nmodel, a sponge, a simple beggar, a shoe-black, a tourist’s guide, a\r\nwatcher of bicycles at café doors, a dealer in photographs of himself\r\nand in original poems, a boon companion of poets and artists, and a\r\nconfidant and counsellor of _étudiantes_; but he is first, last, and all\r\nthe time Bibi the fop, the Beau Tibbs of Latium, the Beau Brummel of the\r\nCastalian gutter.\r\n\r\nThe first time I saw Bibi was in 1895, at an anarchist meeting addressed\r\nby Louise Michel, in the rue de la Montagne Ste. Geneviève, back of the\r\nPanthéon. He was muffled to the eyes, conspirator-like, in the folds of\r\na rusty, tattered Spanish cloak, faced with dirty red velvet, and wore\r\nbesides a white yachting cap, white skin-tight pantaloons, gaping patent\r\nleather shoes fitted with cavalry spurs, and white gaiters.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Bibi he was pulling an unlighted cigar, and tenderly\r\nconvoying to his lodging a poet, not of the most obscure, who had been\r\nimbibing too freely. He was dight in a red fez, a bright green velvet\r\nwaistcoat under an Inverness cape (with no jacket intervening), a yellow\r\nsilk neckerchief, cavalry boots, and baggy brown corduroy trousers; and,\r\nif I should itemise all the different costumes it has been my privilege\r\nto see Bibi wear between these dates, a large octavo volume would\r\nscarcely hold the list. Reputed in some quarters to be an ex-student, an\r\nex-journalist, a political refugee, and a disguised nobleman, and in\r\nothers to be a blackmailer, a swindler, a thief, a police spy, and a\r\npander, the mystery that envelopes Bibi’s present as well as his past—a\r\nmystery which his autobiography, published in _L’Idée_, did appreciably\r\nnothing to dispel—gives him a curiosity-piquing charm.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt as to Bibi’s untidiness, his inordinate vanity, his\r\nassurance, his unscrupulousness, and his genuine kindness of heart; but\r\nbeyond this all is conjecture.\r\n\r\nJehan Rictus in a recent poem, to the recitation of which (at the\r\n_Noctambules_ or the _Grille_) Bibi often listens with his inscrutable\r\nsmile, has given Bibi a large symbolic significance:—\r\n\r\n   _“On dit de Bibi: ‘Chut! c’est un mouchard!’\r\n     D’autres: ‘Taisez-vous, il est bachelier!’\r\n     Et d’autres encor’: ‘Bibi est rentier.’\r\n     Mais nul ne peut croire à la vérité:\r\n     Bibi-la-Purée, c’est le Grand-Déchard.\r\n     Et quel âge a-t-il? On ne sait pas bien.\r\n     Son nom symbolique en le largougi\r\n     Proclame qu’il est assez ancien,\r\n     Quasi éternel comme la Misère.\r\n     Et trimballes-tu, tu trimballeras,\r\n     O Bibi, toujours ta rare effigie.\r\n     Bibi-la-Purée jamais ne mourra._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _C’est le Pèlerin, c’est le Solitaire\r\n     Qui depuis toujours marche sur la Terre,\r\n     C’est un sobriquet bon pour l’Etre Humain.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nBibi was a humble follower and adorer—slave almost—of Verlaine, who\r\nplayfully honored him with the following verses in his _Dédicaces_:—\r\n\r\n   A BIBI-PURÉE\r\n\r\n   _Bibi-Purée,\r\n    Type épatant\r\n    Et drôle tant!_\r\n\r\n   _Quel Dieu te crée\r\n    Ce chic, pourtant,\r\n    Qui nous agrée_\r\n\r\n   _Pourtant, aussi,\r\n    Ta gentillesse\r\n    Notre liesse,\r\n    Et ton souci\r\n    De l’obligeance\r\n    Notre gaieté,\r\n    Ta pauvreté,\r\n    Ton opulence?_\r\n\r\n\r\nA sincere mourner for Verlaine since his death, Bibi regards it as his\r\nspecial mission to cherish the cult of the dead poet’s memory.\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of Bibi’s mourning, however, has not prevented him from\r\nturning an honest penny by selling the inscribed volumes Verlaine had\r\ngiven him, nor from turning many a dishonest penny by selling, as\r\nrelics, copies of Verlaine’s works supplied with forged inscriptions,\r\nand numerous other objects Verlaine never saw.\r\n\r\nThanks to Bibi’s zeal, Verlaine’s last cane and last pipe have been\r\nmultiplied, like “the only true cross,” and have taken up their abodes\r\nin the poetic shrines of two hemispheres.[77]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to think of Bibi without thinking of the Mère Casimir,\r\nlately deceased, who was, for some reason, Bibi’s most cordial aversion.\r\n\r\nThe Mère Casimir was a tiny, twisted, shrivelled old flower-woman, who\r\nclaimed to be an _ex-danseuse_ of the _Opéra_ and to have had for\r\nfriends “princes and marquises,” and who was ready at any moment, in\r\nconsideration of a few sous, to prove it by executing certain grotesque\r\nTerpsichorean movements on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nWhile the Mère Casimir was still alive, there was nothing that delighted\r\nthe students more than bringing about an encounter between her and Bibi,\r\nand hearing the pair blackguard each other. Only once, so far as history\r\nrecords, was there a truce between them,—a certain _Mi-carême_, when,\r\nBibi having been elected king and the Mère Casimir queen of the fête,\r\nthey paraded the streets of Paris together in the same car. On that day\r\nthe antipathetic pair were so impressed with the dignities and\r\nresponsibilities of their position that they treated each other with\r\nroyal magnanimity. Bibi even went farther than strict etiquette\r\nrequired. In descending from his throne at the breaking up of the\r\ncortège, he gallantly fell to his knees,—sight for gods and men!—and\r\nkissed the hand of his queen.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Soudin, a long-haired but relatively neat little man,\r\nwith the noiseless step of a bird, who makes crayon portraits, at ten\r\nsous per head, at the _Grille_ and the _Noctambules_ and in the\r\nall-night restaurants of the _Halles Centrales_, is as much of a mystery\r\nin his way as Bibi, though he has lived in the _Quartier_ more than\r\ntwenty-five years. He is said to have been crossed in love early in\r\nlife, and his title is believed by many to be genuine. However that may\r\nbe, the little Soudin has the education and manners of a gentleman, and\r\n_noblesse oblige_ inspires his conduct. He does no offence to any, and\r\nis a veritable providence to his poorer fellow-Bohemians. M. le Marquis\r\nmakes poems as well as portraits, but not for money. “At least no\r\nmerchant traffics in his heart.”\r\n\r\nThe artist bard of Père Lunette’s,[78] who makes crayon portraits at ten\r\nsous a head, like the little marquis, and poems for money, unlike the\r\nlittle marquis, is also supposed by many to be of noble origin. He is a\r\ndashing, handsome fellow, with the felt and the swagger of a\r\n_mousquetaire_, and is, when he chooses to quit the vulgar rôle his\r\nposition at Père Lunette’s imposes upon him, a lively and stimulating\r\nconversationalist. In summer, with his bosom friend Père Jules, he\r\ntramps the country roads of France.\r\n\r\nAchille Leroy, philosopher and poet (the anarchist\r\nauthor-editor-publisher-bookseller, referred to in the chapter on the\r\noral propaganda of the anarchists), is another favourite with the\r\nstudents, upon whose quizzical, good-natured patronage he depends mainly\r\nfor the sale of his wares.\r\n\r\nSome years back, at the moment of the anarchist “Terror,” Achille,\r\nwhose illusions regarding his intellect are on a par with those of Bibi\r\nregarding his person, offered himself as a candidate for the Academy. He\r\nmade the customary “visits” to the Academicians attired in the uniform\r\nof a Mexican general, and wherever he was not received left an\r\nominous-looking brass kettle to which, along with his visiting card,\r\nthis inscription was attached:\r\n\r\n   “_Je ne fais sauter que les idées._”\r\n\r\nOther contemporary freaks who help to swell the picturesqueness and\r\ngaiety of the _Quartier_ are: the anarchist cobbler _chansonnier_ Père\r\nLa Purge (author of the _Chanson du Père La Purge_, quoted in a previous\r\nchapter), whose customers (mainly the poets and artists of the\r\n_Quartier_) visit his shop in the rue de la Parcheminerie to enjoy the\r\npiquancy of the contrast between his ruddy, contented face and his\r\nanathemas against society; Gaillepand, a big, athletic-looking fellow,\r\nwho, having failed to earn a living by legitimate sculpture, took to\r\nmaking plaster medallions of the celebrities of Paris, especially those\r\nof the _Quartier_, and selling them up and down the Boulevard St.\r\nMichel, while his brother “_Môme l’Histoire_” (now dead) displayed his\r\nphenomenal memory by reciting biographies and poems; the Mère Souris\r\n(Mother Mouse), so called from her conical head and her funny little\r\nwalk, ex-proprietor of an artists’ restaurant and present palmist,\r\nfortune-teller, and reputed usurer,—in short, a very useful personage\r\nto the _étudiantes_; Victor Sainbault, author, editor, publisher, and\r\nbookseller, like Achille Leroy; and the poet Coulet, who gives author’s\r\nreadings before the terraces of the cafés, and who between times, if\r\nhearsay may be credited, provides petty bourgeois families with wedding,\r\nchristening, and funeral verses at so much per yard.\r\n\r\nIt is because these freaks take themselves seriously, because they are\r\nunconscious humourists and involuntary _farceurs_, that they are\r\namusing. But the _Quartier_ has always had among its choicer Bohemians a\r\nclass of conscious, almost professional humourists and deliberate\r\n_farceurs_, called _fumistes_,[79] who by drolly expressing their\r\nvery disrespect for life have done much to make life worth the living.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SITE OF THE CHÂTEAU ROUGE\r\n\r\n   _La rue Galande_]\r\n\r\nThe most renowned of the _Quartier fumistes_ who practised when those\r\nnow in middle life were young was unquestionably Sapeck.\r\n\r\n   “Verily,” says Emile Goudeau, “I owe a taper to Sapeck for\r\n   having initiated me into this inner folly which manifests\r\n   itself outwardly by imperturbable buffooneries.... Better to\r\n   have kept alive, thanks to _insouciance_, than to have died\r\n   stoically of _misère_, wrapped in the cloak of a Byronian\r\n   hero. If we occasionally exceeded the proper limits of the\r\n   laugh, at least we did not light the brazier of Escousse nor\r\n   seek the rope of Gérard de Nerval; and that is something.”\r\n\r\nSapeck is very likely dead now. At any rate, he is dead to the Quarter.\r\nBut, as he was the successor (according to the archæologists of\r\n_fumisterie_) of Romien and Vivier, so he has his successors, one of\r\nwhom the _rapin_ Karl, mystifier of Quesnay de Beaurepaire and abductor\r\nof the Comtesse Martel (“Gyp”), has almost earned the right to be\r\nregarded as his peer. Zo d’Axa, who is less a _fumiste_ than he has it\r\nin him to be, because he takes time to be a serious and talented author\r\nand to serve sentences in prison for his opinions, perpetrated a\r\n_fumisterie_ some five years back that has taken an honourable place\r\namong the classics of its kind.\r\n\r\nIt will be best narrated as he narrated it himself in one of his\r\ncelebrated _Feuilles_:—\r\n\r\n   “HE IS ELECTED\r\n\r\n   “_Good People of the City, Electors_,\r\n\r\n   “Listen to the edifying story of a pretty little white\r\n   jackass, candidate in the capital. It is not a Mother Goose\r\n   tale nor a sensation of the _Petit Journal_. It is a veracious\r\n   narrative for the grown-up youngsters who still vote:—\r\n\r\n   “A little jackass, born in the land of La Fontaine and of\r\n   Rabelais, ... made a campaign for a deputy’s chair. When\r\n   election day came, this jackass, this typical candidate,\r\n   answering to the unequivocal name of _Nul_, executed a\r\n   last-hour manœuvre. On a warm Sunday in May, while the people\r\n   crowded to the urns, the white jackass, the candidate _Nul_,\r\n   enthroned on a triumphal car drawn by electors, traversed\r\n   Paris, his _bonne ville_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZO D’AXA’S NOVEL CANDIDATE\r\n\r\n   REFLECHISSEZ, CHERS CITOYENS VOUS SAVEZ QUE VOS ÉLUS VOUS\r\n   TROMPENT, VOUS ONT TROMPÉS, VOUS TROMPERONT—ET POURTANT VOUS\r\n   ALLEZ VOTER.... VOTEZ DONC POUR MOI! NOMMEZ L’ANE! ON N’EST\r\n   PAS PLUS BÊTE QUE VOUS.]\r\n\r\n   “Erect on his hind legs, ears to the wind, craning forward,\r\n   over-topping proudly the parti-colored vehicle,—the vehicle in\r\n   the form of an urn,—his head planted between the traditional\r\n   glass of water and the presidential bell, he passed in the\r\n   midst of hisses and bravos and jests.\r\n\r\n   “The jackass beheld Paris, and Paris beheld him.\r\n\r\n   “Paris! The Paris that votes, the rout, the people sovereign\r\n   every four years,—the people simpleton enough to believe that\r\n   sovereignty consists in naming its masters....\r\n\r\n   “Slowly the jackass went through the streets. As he advanced,\r\n   the walls were covered with placards by members of his\r\n   committee, while others distributed his proclamation to the\r\n   crowd:—\r\n\r\n   “‘Reflect, dear fellow-citizens. You know that your deputies\r\n   deceive you, have deceived you, will deceive you; and yet you\r\n   vote. Vote for me then! Vote for the jackass! Elect the\r\n   jackass! It is impossible to be more stupid than you.’\r\n\r\n   “This frankness, a trifle brutal, was not to everybody’s\r\n   taste.\r\n\r\n   “‘They are insulting us,’ bellowed some. ‘They are ridiculing\r\n   universal suffrage,’ protested others more justly. Some one\r\n   shook his fist at the jackass furiously, and said, ‘_Sale\r\n   Juif!_’ (Dirty Jew), but a laugh burst out, and spread\r\n   sonorous. The candidate was acclaimed. Bravely the elector\r\n   made fun of himself and of his representatives. Hats and canes\r\n   were waved. Ladies threw flowers. The jackass passed.\r\n\r\n   “He descended from the heights of Montmartre, going towards\r\n   the _Quartier Latin_. He crossed the Grands-Boulevards, the\r\n   Croissant,[80] where is cooked, without salt, the _ordinaire_\r\n   served by the gazettes. He saw the _halles_ (markets) where\r\n   the starving glean in the heaps of garbage, the quays where\r\n   electors elect lodgings under the bridges.\r\n\r\n   “Heart and brain! Paris! Democracy!...\r\n\r\n   “The jackass arrived before the Senate.\r\n\r\n   “He skirted the palace, whence the guard emerged hurriedly. He\r\n   followed, on the outside, alas! the too-green gardens. Then\r\n   came the Boulevard St. Michel. On the terraces of the cafés\r\n   the youth of the _Quartier_ clapped their hands. The crowd,\r\n   constantly growing, snatched out of each other’s hands the\r\n   jackass’s proclamations. The students harnessed themselves to\r\n   the car, a professor pushed the wheels; but it struck three,\r\n   and the police appeared.\r\n\r\n   “Since ten o’clock that morning, from post to commissariat,\r\n   the telegraph and the telephone had signalled the strange\r\n   passage of the subversive animal. The order was issued:\r\n   ‘Arrest the jackass!’ And now the police sergeants barred the\r\n   route of the candidate.\r\n\r\n   “Near the Place St. Michel, the faithful committee of _Nul_\r\n   was ordered by the armed force to conduct its candidate to the\r\n   nearest police station. Naturally, the committee paid no\r\n   attention, and kept on its way. The car crossed the Seine, and\r\n   soon it halted before the _Palais de Justice_.\r\n\r\n   “The police, re-enforced, surrounded the white jackass, the\r\n   impassive jackass. The candidate was arrested at the gate of\r\n   this _Palais de Justice_, whence deputies, defaulters,\r\n   _panamistes_, all the big thieves, go out free.\r\n\r\n   “In the midst of the surging crowd the car swayed as if about\r\n   to capsize. The police, a brigadier at their head, had seized\r\n   the shafts and donned the straps. The committee insisted no\r\n   more: they helped harness the _sergents de ville_.\r\n\r\n   “Thus the white jackass was abandoned by his warmest\r\n   partisans. Like any other vulgar politician, the animal had\r\n   come to a bad end. The police towed him, authority guided his\r\n   route. _From this moment Nul was only an official candidate._\r\n   His friends acknowledged him no more. The door of the\r\n   prefecture opened wide, and the jackass entered quite as if he\r\n   were entering his own stall.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has all this starving and self-killing and freakishness and\r\npractical joking of the _Quartier_ Bohemians to do with revolution? Much\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\nJules Vallès (all his life a Latin Quarter Bohemian), whom Richepin has\r\ncharacterised as “the most curious and the most complete of the\r\n_déclassés_ of the pen”; of whom his intimate friend Gill said, “He\r\nwould be the tenderest, the most _spirituel_, the most charming, and the\r\nmost eloquent fellow in the world, were it not for the mania which\r\npossesses him to believe himself at ease only in the smoke of battles or\r\nthe bawlings of the faubourgs”; who presented himself at the elections\r\nof 1869 as “_le candidat de la misère_,” and put at the head of his\r\nsecond volume of _Jacques Vingtras_ (_Le Bachelier_), “_A ceux qui\r\nnourris de Grec et de Latin sont morts de faim, je dédie ce\r\nlivre_,”—Jules Vallès (and who should know better than Vallès?) said,\r\nnot long before the Commune was declared:—\r\n\r\n   “In this life there is a danger. _Misère_ without a flag\r\n   conducts to the _misère_ that has a flag, and makes of the\r\n   scattered _réfractaires_ an army which counts in its ranks\r\n   less sons of the people than sons of the _bourgeoisie_. Behold\r\n   them bearing down upon us, pale, mute, emaciated, beating the\r\n   charge with the bones of their martyrs upon the drum of the\r\n   _révoltés_, and waving as a standard, at the point of a sword,\r\n   the blood-stained shirt of the last of their suicides!...\r\n\r\n   “These _déclassés_ must find places, or they will have\r\n   revenge; and this is why so much absinthe runs down their\r\n   throats and so much blood upon the paving-stones. They become\r\n   drunkards or rebels.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, in the introduction to his _Réfractaires_, he says, “Give me\r\nthree hundred of these men, any sort of a flag, toss me down there\r\nbefore the regiments in a raking fire, and you shall see what short work\r\nI will make of the gunners at the head of my _réfractaires_!”\r\n\r\nEvery convulsion Paris has undergone has proved the truth of Vallès’\r\nmordant sentences. What was the Commune, indeed, but the joint\r\nself-assertion of the _déclassés_?\r\n\r\n   “_Déclassés_,” wrote Richepin of the leaders of the Commune\r\n   shortly after its suppression, “from the unrecognised general,\r\n   Cluseret, to the unappreciated caricaturist, Pilotell; from\r\n   the intelligent deputy, Millière, to the lunatic, Allix; from\r\n   the great painter, Courbet, to the ex-monk, Panille, and\r\n   _tutti quanti_; _déclassés_ of politics, like Delescluze and\r\n   Pyat, of journalism and of literature, like Vallès, Vermesch,\r\n   Vermorel, Grousset, Vésinier, Maroleau; of the army, like\r\n   Rossel, of the workshop, like Assi, of the _brasserie_, like\r\n   Rigault, of lower still, like Johamard.”\r\n\r\nNot all these starving, suiciding, freakish, jesting Latin Quarter\r\nBohemians are conscious socialists and anarchists, though there is a\r\ngood proportion of them who are,—a greater proportion probably than\r\namong the students proper, by as much as their situations are more\r\nprecarious; but they nearly all hold vaguely subversive humanitarian\r\nviews, and they are all, even the Bohemians by choice, _réfractaires_\r\nand _révoltés_. Like the Thélémites of Rabelais, they all recognise but\r\nthe one law which is no law,—“_Fay ce que vouldras._”\r\n\r\nTheir way of living is a species of the _propagande par l’exemple_ from\r\nwhich it is a quick and easy step to the _propagande par le fait_. Given\r\na crisis, _réfractaire_, _révolté_, and _révolutionnaire_ spell very\r\nmuch the same thing. They are all ripe for disorder.\r\n\r\nThe victims of the _misère en habit noir_—the poor doctors, teachers,\r\nlawyers, petty functionaries, and clerks—are, in the nature of the\r\ncase, more submissive to their fate than the free-living freaks,\r\nlittérateurs, and artists; but there are evidences that they, too, are\r\nbeginning to think of stepping over the bounds within which patience is\r\na virtue.\r\n\r\nM. Paul Webre, one of a group of young men of means and\r\neducation—evolutionists, not revolutionists—who have pursued the\r\nlaboratory method of studying the conditions, the psychology, and the\r\nrelations to society of various employments, has given the following\r\ntestimony to the expectant, if unaggressive, attitude of the small\r\nclerks:—\r\n\r\n   “My relatively frail health forbidding me work in a factory, I\r\n   sought a place as a clerk. After twenty ineffectual\r\n   applications I succeeded in crossing the threshold of an\r\n   insurance company. I earn there 100 francs a month, on which I\r\n   manage to live without resorting to my income. I carry with me\r\n   in the morning a lunch of bread, cheese, and a slice of ham or\r\n   sausage, and I talk with my comrades of the office. Some are\r\n   married. These are the most unfortunate; but they reflect\r\n   that, if they quit their meagre situations, there are\r\n   innumerable persons in the streets ready to vie with each\r\n   other to obtain them, and they cling to them for dear life.\r\n   Nevertheless, their hatred is brooding. While taking cold\r\n   bites during the hour of respite which the avaricious\r\n   administration accords us, we pass our chiefs in review, and\r\n   compare their profits with our own. The director has a salary\r\n   of 100,000 francs, the president is several times a\r\n   millionaire; while we, _morbleu_! Oh, the monotonous days! the\r\n   repulsive work! the ominous end of the month! and the\r\n   certainty of plodding along for twenty years in the same\r\n   fashion, only to be sent away at last without resource! It is\r\n   poverty in the frayed frock-coat, the worst poverty. I have\r\n   tried to organise the discontented, but they have a terror of\r\n   compromising themselves and of making themselves marks for the\r\n   Company’s blows. So, bending over their documents, they spy\r\n   the growlings in the street, ready to descend there, in their\r\n   turn, when the revolution asserts itself. The atmosphere in\r\n   which these petty clerks stagnate is saturated with\r\n   bitterness, with rancours, with regrets, with deceived\r\n   ambitions. Terrible eruptions are being prepared therein. And\r\n   I cry to the capitalists: ‘Take care! Transform these enemies\r\n   into friends, these anarchists into conservators! Share your\r\n   profits with them. Throw them a honey-cake while there is\r\n   still time.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SECOND-HAND BOOK MARKET OF THE LATIN QUARTER]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   “_Put a man in the street with a coat that is too large on his\r\n   back, pantaloons that are too short, without a collar, without a\r\n   shirt, without stockings, without a sou, had he the genius of\r\n   Machiavelli, of Talleyrand, he would fall into the\r\n   gutter._”—JULES VALLÈS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMONTMARTRE AND “LA VACHE ENRAGÉE”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “La Gloire _marches before the_ Vache Enragée. _Follow her then,\r\n   try to catch up with her: there is honour even for those who\r\n   fall by the way._”\r\n\r\n   ADOLPHE WILLETTE, in Le Calvaire de la Vache Enragée.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Whatever scorn, whatever disgrace he may bring upon himself,\r\n   it is none the less true that the poor and obscure artist is\r\n   often worth more than the conquerors of the world; and there are\r\n   nobler hearts under the mansards where only three chairs, a bed,\r\n   a table, and a_ grisette _are to be found, than in the_ gémonies\r\n   dorées _and the_ abreuvoirs _of domestic ambition._”\r\n\r\n   ALFRED DE MUSSET, in Preface of Comédies et Proverbes.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Ils feront de ta corne acérée une épée,\r\n    Ils feront de ton crâne une coupe sculptée,\r\n    Où nous boirons ton sang avivé de levains.\r\n    Ils feront de ton cuir des bottes de sept lieues\r\n    Pour courir au pays des illusions bleues\r\n    Ou vers l’âpre idéal des rouges lendemains.”\r\n\r\n   PAUL MARROT, in a poem to the Vache Enragée.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_A la Vache Enragée, à Montmartre.

FRÉMIET.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “VIVE LA VACHE ENRAGÉE!\r\n             “_Son ami_,\r\n\r\n   “ALPHONSE DAUDET.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe official restoration at the Carnival of 1896 of the historic but\r\nlong unobserved fête of the _Bœuf Gras_ (Fat Ox) was the signal for the\r\ncreation of the fête of the _Vache Enragée_ (Famished Cow) for that\r\nyear’s _Mi-carême_ by the denizens of Montmartre.\r\n\r\n   “Over against the _Bœuf Gras_, father of the golden calf,\r\n   emblem of the wealth and prosperity of the _bourgeoisie_,”\r\n   said the committee of organisation in its public manifesto,\r\n   “the painters, poets, and _chansonniers_ of the Mont des\r\n   Martyrs have prepared for the pleasure and edification of the\r\n   Parisians a spectacle which they call the Cavalcade of the\r\n   _Vache Enragée_ (or the _Vachalcade_), intended to present the\r\n   picture, sometimes poignant, of their struggles, their\r\n   sufferings, their ideals, their chasings after phantoms, their\r\n   unrealised dreams, their often illusory hopes.”\r\n\r\nThis brand-new cavalcade consisted of a large number of pedestrians\r\nmasquerading as ducks, geese, rabbits, frogs, camels, donkeys, cats,\r\npigs, and giraffes (the French words for all of which have well-defined\r\nmetaphorical meanings), and as chimeras, Pierrots and Pierrettes; and a\r\nscore or more of fantastic floats (designed by Montmartre artists of\r\nrepute), the subtle and piquant symbolism of which was all Greek to the\r\nforeign tourists who chanced to see them and not too intelligible to\r\nmany Parisians who fancied they knew their Paris and their French. The\r\nfloats were entitled (to mention only those whose significance is fairly\r\nobvious) _Pegasus Seized by the Sheriffs_, _The Anti-Landlord League_,\r\n_The Wrestlers of Thought_, _The Temple of the Golden Calf_, _La Vache\r\nEnragée through the Ages_, _Feeding of la Vache Enragée_, _Drawing the\r\nTeeth of la Vache Enragée_, _A la Belle Etoile_,[81] and _Ma Tante_.[82]\r\nThe design for this last, by M. Grün, is given herewith.\r\n\r\nJudges were satirically represented as side-whiskered café garçons; the\r\nvictims of _la misère en habit noir_, as street pavers, attired in\r\nfrayed frock-coats, wind-traversed shoes, and weather-beaten “plug”\r\nhats; and _Les Jeunes_,[83] as small boys, in dunce-caps, playing on\r\ndrums.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRÜN’S DESIGN FOR FLOAT IN CAVALCADE OF LA VACHE ENRAGÉE]\r\n\r\nThe street parade lasted from mid-day to sunset. It was preceded by a\r\ntheatrical representation for the benefit of destitute artists, which\r\nincluded appropriate skits by the Montmartre playwrights Xanrof and\r\nCourtéline, an address by the Montmartre socialist poet-deputy Clovis\r\nHugues, and rapid platform drawing by the Montmartre caricaturists, Pal\r\nand Grün; and it was followed by bonfires and open-air dancing, and by a\r\nmasked ball at the _Moulin Rouge_, in the course of which a lottery was\r\ndrawn, whose principal prizes were sketches by Montmartre artists, among\r\nthem Faverot, Willette, Henri Pille, Roedel, Léandre, and Puvis de\r\nChavannes. The occasion was further signalised by the publication of a\r\nmagazine, _La Vache Enragée_, under the editorship of Willette.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of the second and last[84] fête of the _Vache\r\nEnragée_ (1897) was a musical poem, entitled “_Le Couronnement de la\r\nMuse de Montmartre_,” by the Montmartre composer Gustave Charpentier,\r\nnow thrice famous as the author of _Louise_, in which Labour, figured by\r\none Mlle. Stumpp (a working-girl, who had been elected by ballot the\r\nMontmartre Muse), was crowned by Beauty, figured by Cléo de Mérode.\r\nCharpentier interpreted his cantata as follows:—\r\n\r\n   “The Muse is the plebeian virgin, the virtuous young\r\n   working-girl, the daughter of the people, administering a\r\n   formidable slap in the face to the _pères la pudeur_,[85]\r\n   showing these drivellers of another epoch, these dotards whose\r\n   sentiments are false, unnatural, and bourgeois, that it is\r\n   possible to achieve the beautiful in taking for a queen an\r\n   _ouvrière_, a _rosière_ even, of Montmartre, region of ideals\r\n   too young for their too old ideas.”\r\n\r\nThis Montmartre fête of the _Vache Enragée_ is unique among the fêtes of\r\nthe whole world, I fancy, in that it is at once a bold apotheosis of the\r\nracking poverty of the artistic career and a defiant, masterful sneer at\r\nthe smugness of commercial Philistinism.[86] “It is a defence of _la\r\nmisère_ you are making,” said Zola in a communication to its\r\norganisers,—“a defence of _la misère_; and, to my thinking, you are\r\nright in making this defence.” Cyrano, a knight of the _vache enragée_,\r\nwho would have found himself delightfully at home in the Montmartre\r\ncavalcade, made a similar defence, according to Rostand, some centuries\r\nago:—\r\n\r\n   “_Moi, c’est moralement que j’ai mes élégances.\r\n     Je ne m’attife pas ainsi qu’un freluquet,\r\n     Mais je suis plus soigné si je suis moins coquet.\r\n     Je ne sortirais pas avec, par négligence,\r\n     Un affront pas très-bien lavé, la conscience\r\n     Jaune encore de sommeil dans le coin de son œil,\r\n     Un honneur chiffoné, des scrupules en deuil.\r\n     Mais je marche sans rien sur moi qui ne reluise,\r\n     Empanaché d’indépendance et de franchise;\r\n     Ce n’est pas une taille avantageuse, c’est\r\n     Mon âme que je cambre ainsi qu’en un corset,\r\n     Et tout couvert d’exploits qu’en rubans je m’attache,\r\n     Retroussant mon esprit ainsi qu’une moustache,\r\n     Je fais en traversant les groupes et les ronds,\r\n     Sonner les vérités comme des éperons._”\r\n\r\nThe device, _Vache Enragée_, cavalierly adopted as their catchword by\r\nthe painters, sculptors, poets, and musicians of Montmartre, was taken\r\ndirectly from the title of a Montmartre romance by Emile Goudeau, who\r\nwas named on that account honorary president of the festival; but the\r\nphrase had long been current in French conversation and literature to\r\ndesignate the poverty of the _prolétariat artistique et littéraire_.\r\nThus, the great Daudet wrote regarding one of the characters of\r\n_Jack_:—\r\n\r\n   “Then commenced for him this terrible ordeal of the _vache\r\n   enragée_, which either breaks you at once or bronzes you\r\n   forever.\r\n\r\n   “He became one of the ten thousand poor devils, famished and\r\n   proud, who rise in Paris every morning giddy with hunger and\r\n   ambitious dreams, nibble surreptitiously a sou loaf, which\r\n   they keep hidden away in the bottoms of their pockets, blacken\r\n   their clothes with penfuls of ink, whiten their shirt collars\r\n   with billiard chalk, and warm themselves over the registers of\r\n   the libraries and churches.... Art is such a wizard! It\r\n   creates a sun which shines for all, like Nature’s sun; and\r\n   those who approach it, even the poor, even the ill-favoured,\r\n   even the grotesque, carry away a little of its warmth and its\r\n   radiance. This celestial flame, imprudently ravished, which\r\n   the unsuccessful guard in the depths of their eyes, renders\r\n   them redoubtable sometimes, oftenest ridiculous; but their\r\n   existence gains from it a grandiose serenity, a contemptuous\r\n   indifference to misfortune, and a grace in suffering that\r\n   other kinds of poverty do not know.”\r\n\r\nThe Montmartre _Vache Enragée_, you see, is the same old Latin Quarter\r\n_Misère_ under another label, the “Bohemian road by which every man who\r\nenters the arts without other means of existence than art itself will be\r\nforced to travel, ... the training school of the artistic profession,\r\nthe preface to the Academy, the _Hôtel-Dieu_, or the Morgue.”[87]\r\n\r\nOver the stony and thorny route of the _Vache Enragée_ a large part of\r\nthe literary, artistic, and musical celebrities of France have at one\r\ntime or another passed.\r\n\r\nMillet painting signs at Cherbourg and hasty portraits for the soldiers\r\nat Havre—_Vache Enragée_!\r\n\r\nBarye forced to go about as a pedler in order to vend his now priceless\r\nstatuettes—_Vache Enragée_!\r\n\r\nHector Berlioz, ridiculed for wanting the courage to put a bullet\r\nthrough his brain, accepting newspaper work to live, failing to write a\r\nsymphony the theme of which came to him in a dream, because he would not\r\nhave money enough to bring it out if it were written—_Vache Enragée_!\r\n\r\nAudran and Charles Lecocq (who took prizes, the one in composition, the\r\nother in fugue, at the _Conservatoire_ and the Niedermeyer School\r\nrespectively) writing opéra bouffe to keep the wolf from the\r\ndoor—_Vache Enragée_!\r\n\r\nAlbert Glatigny, out on a hunt for funds to bury the dead mistress of a\r\nfriend, swimming the Seine (though he was a poor swimmer and it was late\r\nautumn) because he could not pay the small bridge toll which was then\r\nexacted—_Vache Enragée_!\r\n\r\nThe saturnine De Nerval and the brilliant Gauthier chasing dinners, the\r\nfirst in back alley-ways and the second in the salon of the Princesse\r\nMathilde—_Vache Enragée_!\r\n\r\n_Vache Enragée_, also, young Balzac living on a few sous a day and\r\nwriting the inevitable five-act drama in an icy garret, because his\r\nfather, who had intended the boy for the law, had said to him,\r\n“There are people who have a vocation for dying in the hospital,” and\r\nhis mother, “It seems that monsieur has a taste for misery!”\r\n\r\n_Vache Enragée_—young Daudet arriving in Paris, after an over-long\r\nfast, shod only with rubbers (as he has narrated in _Trente Ans_ and _Le\r\nPetit Chose_), and existing there on his share of the seventy-five\r\nfrancs a month his brother Ernest earned!\r\n\r\nAnd _Vache Enragée_—young Zola stifling in a “room under the roof where\r\none was forced to perform a series of acrobatic feats to sit down—on\r\nthe bed”; living several days on bread soaked in olive oil sent to him\r\nfrom the Midi, and pitifully imploring the editors of _Le Travail_ (a\r\nlittle Latin Quarter review) to print for him a poem written in the\r\nstyle of De Musset!\r\n\r\n_Vache Enragée_ again—Eugène Boudin sighing in his journal: “There are\r\nmoments hard to bear when on every side you see the impossibility of\r\ngetting a little money. There is a poor old mother who entreats, there\r\nis the rent to pay, there is the necessity of clothes, of brushes, of\r\ncanvases, which you finally have to get along without. Petty economy and\r\nthe worry that accompanies it kill you by inches.”\r\n\r\n_Vache Enragée_, in short, the privations of all those for whom liberty\r\nis a necessity, and beauty a religion, and with whom a glowing faith in\r\nart more than atones for the absence of bread, of fire, and of clothes!\r\n\r\nWinter before last a painter, fifty-three years of age, well known in\r\nart circles, was detected extracting money out of a church poor-box with\r\nthe aid of a glue-smeared stick. This revolting sort of infidelity to\r\nthe hard fare of the _Vache Enragée_ is, it need hardly be said, a rare\r\noccurrence; but it is not rare for men to be forced to familiarity with\r\nthe _Vache Enragée_ after they have become famous.\r\n\r\nGlatigny never got entirely free of poverty, and it was of disease\r\nproduced by hunger and exposure that both he and his wife died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LA MUSE DE MONTMARTRE.\r\n\r\n   _O Muse de Montmartre, ouvrière aux doigts fins\r\n    Qui saurait broder d’or l’azur des Séraphins\r\n    Et qui daignez sourire aux larmes des poètes,\r\n    Salut!

He\r\nnever earned more than four thousand francs a year, and rarely as much\r\nas three thousand francs,—a sum which was destitution, nothing more nor\r\nless, for a person whose vocation forced him into the world and whose\r\ninability to walk necessitated a perpetual outlay for carriage hire.\r\n\r\nIn a striking passage of his novel, _La Faiseuse de Gloire_, Paul Brulat\r\nwrites: “An old man approached the desk timidly, and stammered something\r\nin a low voice. The editor, annoyed at being interrupted, repelled him\r\nwith cruel words. ‘Oh, say now, won’t you ever stop coming here\r\nbegging?’ The old man moved off with a senile shake of the head. He bore\r\na great name in literature. He was called Villiers de l’Isle-Adam.”\r\n\r\nHenry Becque, whose _Corbeaux_ was refused by ten theatres before it was\r\naccepted by the _Théâtre Français_, “lived on a seventh floor, under the\r\nroof,” says his friend and admirer, Henri Bauer. “The furnishings of his\r\nsingle room were an iron bed, an unpainted table, and three\r\nstraw-bottomed chairs.” And this was long after Becque’s masterpieces\r\nhad been given a hearing, at a time when he was regarded by a large and\r\ninfluential group of his contemporaries as the greatest French dramatist\r\nthe last half of the nineteenth century had produced.\r\n\r\nBerlioz, Millet, Verlaine, and Hégésippe Moreau ate of the _Vache\r\nEnragée_, more or less regularly, all their lives. So have many other\r\nartistic natures, not the least worthy and not the least celebrated.\r\n\r\nFranz Servais, after having given fifteen years of labour, at untold\r\nsacrifice, to the creation and perfection of his opera, _L’Apollonide_,\r\nwon the support of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar only to have his patron\r\ndie just as the preparations for the production of the opera were\r\ncomplete and to die himself a few days after. In a letter to a friend,\r\nServais has related how on one occasion, when everything looked dark, he\r\nmissed an almost certain order from a musical publisher for want of\r\npresentable shoes: “I was unable to keep the appointment. At the last\r\nmoment I perceived that my best shoes were all broken open. They gaped\r\nat the ends like carps’ noses. You can imagine the face of the good\r\neditor, his regret for having offered me a little money, and how he\r\nwould have torn up the contract! I must wait for better luck.”\r\n\r\nFranz Servais took himself too tragically in letting a good thing escape\r\nhim simply because he had holes in his shoes. But Servais, though\r\nidentified with Paris, was a Belgian, not a Frenchman, by birth, and was\r\nnot a _Montmartrois_.\r\n\r\nWith a remunerative offer as an incentive, your typical _Montmartrois_\r\nwould not have taken more than fifteen minutes to beg, borrow, or steal,\r\nhire or buy on the strength of the offer itself or of a supposititious\r\nheritage, the necessary shoes, and would have celebrated the happy\r\noutcome with his friends the very same night. Resourcefulness is a\r\nsalient trait of the Bohemian wherever he may be found, and of none more\r\nthan of the Bohemian of Montmartre. His contrivances for making the pot\r\nboil are legion.\r\n\r\nIn a tight place, he utilises the erudition, of which he is ordinarily\r\nmore than half ashamed, in teaching foreigners French, working on\r\ncyclopedias or dictionaries, and giving lessons in the “three Rs,” for a\r\nfew sous a day, to the children of his _concièrge_. He gives lessons\r\njust as readily in dancing, fencing, sparring, and _savate_.\r\n\r\nIf his talents are literary, he contributes to diet and fashion\r\njournals, writes advertisements or puffs for trade organs, sings songs\r\nof his own composition in the streets, or prints original poetry on\r\nslips and sells it in the cafés. He reads and writes letters at so much\r\na piece for illiterate neighbours, supplies street singers (at a nominal\r\nprice) with words for their songs, makes almost presentable (by editing)\r\nthe productions of snobs, and constructs for _feuilletonistes_ romances\r\nwhich said _feuilletonistes_ sign. He writes indifferently theses for\r\nstudents, brochures for pamphleteers, placards and palaver for strolling\r\nshowmen, prospectuses for charlatans, anniversary rhymes for husbands or\r\nwives, god-parents or god-children, toasts for empty-pated banqueters,\r\nand funeral speeches or elegies for unimaginative mourners. If his gift\r\nis musical, he plays in night orchestras. If his gift is artistic, he\r\nposes as a model for his companions of the chisel and brush who chance\r\nto be in funds, copies old masters at ten to fifteen francs a picture,\r\ndesigns posters and daubs scenery for the fêtes of the faubourgs,\r\ncolours crude religious prints for the provincial market, paints\r\nworkingmen’s children in their first communion regalia, and makes\r\nportraits for fond widows and widowers—between demise and burial—of\r\ntheir dear deceased. If his health is particularly robust, he figures\r\nthe cured patient in quack doctors’ waiting-rooms.\r\n\r\nHe may, quite regardless of his bent, hawk toys in the street on fête\r\ndays, play the races (under sealed orders) for a friend too busy to\r\nattend, fish tadpoles in the suburbs for the reptiles of menageries,\r\nhelp out a small shopkeeper with his book-keeping, back envelopes for a\r\nbig bazaar, perform the duties of a valet under the euphuistic title of\r\nsecretary, and advertise wares by demanding them insistently where they\r\nare not kept. He may even make himself a printer’s, house painter’s,\r\nmason’s, blacksmith’s, or carpenter’s assistant, a market porter, or a\r\n_déménageur_ (mover). In all these contingencies, however, the immediate\r\nneed having been satisfied, he takes up again his normal autonomous\r\nexistence. He has not bound himself to lasting servitude. He has not\r\nsold his soul, and it is a rare thing that he is seriously demoralised\r\nby his half-humorous concessions. On the other hand, he has touched life\r\nat new points, deepened his sentiments, broadened his human sympathies,\r\nand lifted his horizon without lowering his ideal.\r\n\r\n“Implacable sausage!” cries the author of _Le Dimanche d’un Jeune Homme\r\nPauvre_. “We do not give sufficient credit to the influence of the hog\r\non literature! I know men of letters _en route_ for the Academy who ate\r\nkilometres of _boudin_ [blood pudding] during the hard years of their\r\nnovitiate.” This is merely a highly concrete way of saying that the\r\nFrench Bohemian is much less exercised over the savouriness of food than\r\nover its staying power. The problem he has to solve oftenest is not how\r\nmost to tickle his palate, but how to give his system the maximum of\r\nbracing at the minimum of expense. To the solution of this problem, the\r\n_Montmartrois_ brings an address that is amazing. So long as he can keep\r\nin the good graces of his _restaurateur_ or of his butcher, baker,\r\ngrocer, and sausage-man by painting handsome portraits of them and of\r\ntheir families or by flooding them with inscribed copies of his poems,\r\nthe equation is a simple one, and all goes easily enough. But when the\r\ninevitable day of reckoning comes for him, when credit is withdrawn, and\r\nall relations with these well-nigh indispensable individuals are\r\nincontinently snapped; when, furthermore, he has dined with his friend\r\nthe interne, J——, at the hospital table with his friend the sergeant,\r\nK——, in the sub-officers’ mess, and with his former classmates, the\r\nBaron Y—— and the leather merchant X——, in their homes, and when he\r\nhas made the round of the _cénacles_ at which he is welcome for the\r\nverses he recites, the stories he tells, or the songs he sings,—then\r\nthe simple equation becomes an affected quadratic one, and a lugubrious\r\nchange comes over the spirit of his dreams. Then bread and _boudin_,\r\nbread and cheese, bread and a sou’s worth of the meat kept for dogs, or\r\nbread helped down with a glass of _vin ordinaire_ at the corner\r\nwine-shop, are the most that he can hope to obtain, unless, like Zola,\r\nhe takes to snaring sparrows on the house-top, and roasting them,\r\nspitted on a curtain rod, by way of a brochette.\r\n\r\nIf the bread and cheese and the bread and wine also fail, if the\r\n_boudin_ has to be put into the category of the unattainable along with\r\nbeefsteak, and if the sparrows are coy, he may join the cats, dogs, and\r\nrag-pickers in exploring the garbage boxes at the break of morning; but\r\nhe usually prefers—perhaps because he does not easily accommodate\r\nhimself to early rising—some less direct, more diplomatic proceeding,\r\nsuch as tasting the stock of the market and street venders with the\r\nfastidious air of an intending buyer. Thus, walking up to a barrow of\r\nstrawberries: “Your strawberries look good. How do you sell them?” “Four\r\nsous a pound.” “May I taste them?” “Certainly.”\r\n\r\nHe munches and savours two or three berries attentively, as if almost\r\nconvinced of their merit, puts his hand into his pocket and draws out\r\nhis purse as if to order, but, tasting another berry as he does so,\r\nmakes a wry face, and ejaculates, “No, no, they’ll never do at all:\r\nthey’re too sour,” and moves on to another barrow.\r\n\r\nBerry by berry, slowly, but surely, he amasses a meal, as the miser\r\namasses his hoard; and, if he has the luck to get a sou’s worth of bread\r\nwith which to punctuate his butter, cheese, and fruit tastings, the\r\nresult is not half a gastronomic failure. Happy, however, the taster\r\nwhose crisis of penury coincides with the opening of the “Ham Fair”!\r\n\r\nPicking petty quarrels for the sake of the substantial festivity that is\r\nlikely to accompany the making up and betting on its eating capacity are\r\nother favourite ways for penniless hunger to satisfy itself.\r\n\r\nCatulle Mendès, who made the acquaintance of the _Vache Enragée_ during\r\nthe brief period when his family were unsympathetic with his aims, tells\r\nof a poet, presumably himself, who after thirty-six hours of abstinence\r\nsucceeded in breaking his fast by making a gingerbread bet:—\r\n\r\n   “The poet eyed the sweets wistfully, eyed them long.... He was\r\n   just going away, I know not where, in the direction of the\r\n   river perhaps, when he heard his name called. It was some one\r\n   he scarcely knew, a young man also, not a poet, met somewhere\r\n   by chance.\r\n\r\n   “‘How hard you look at that gingerbread!’ he said. The poet\r\n   replied with gravity, ‘It is because I adore it.’\r\n\r\n   “‘Really?’\r\n\r\n   “‘Yes, to distraction. There are days when I could eat a\r\n   franc’s worth at a sitting.’\r\n\r\n   “‘You’re joking. I bet you the franc you can’t eat as many as\r\n   you say.’\r\n\r\n   “‘I take you up,’ cried the _Parnassien_, with starveling\r\n   enthusiasm; and he precipitated himself upon the stall, and\r\n   devoured the gingerbreads,—would have eaten of them for still\r\n   greater, for enormous, sums,—taking pains to choose the pieces\r\n   without almonds, which were poorer in quality, but which were\r\n   bigger for the price. It was thus that he did not die of\r\n   hunger.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that Ibsen in his early days of poverty before the\r\npublication of _Brand_ made it an invariable rule to take a long walk at\r\nnoon, whether he had the money for a meal or not, in order not to lose\r\ncaste—and hence credit—with his landlady by revealing that he could\r\nnot dine as often as every day. Similarly the Montmartre Bohemian\r\ndisplays a fine pathetico-humorous ingenuity in making others believe he\r\nhas eaten when he has not, and even—supreme prestidigitation!—in\r\nmaking himself believe it: as when he passes the day in bed or puts his\r\nwatch back to cheat his appetite; when he takes his _déjeuner_ in the\r\nmiddle of the afternoon, not only to get a dinner at the price of a\r\n_déjeuner_, but to afford himself the illusion of having both; or when\r\nhe makes the Heaven-sent _apéritif_ that should precede or the\r\ngratuitous cigar that should follow a dinner, stand him in the stead of\r\nthe dinner itself.\r\n\r\nHis so-called affectations and poses—bizarre accoutrement and\r\noutlandish speech—are, in the last analysis, so many devices for cheap\r\nliving, so many expedients for disguising the completeness of his\r\ndestitution from his fellows and from himself, so many talismans for\r\nmetamorphosing a hard necessity into an idiosyncrasy of genius, or so\r\nmany modes of whistling, so to speak, to keep up his courage. Thus\r\nGoudeau, under the stress of exceptional ill-hap, consecrated himself\r\nsolemnly to playing practical jokes in a _phalanstère_; and the rotund\r\nand rippling Raoul Ponchon flaunted a splendid Breton costume at the\r\nvery time he had nothing better than a wash-house to sleep in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTMARTRE TYPES]\r\n\r\nIf the _Montmartrois_ carries his hat in his hand with a distrait,\r\nphilosophical air, it is certain that the last piece of head-gear\r\nProvidence has vouchsafed him is either too large or too small for his\r\nhead. If he speaks feelingly of his old aunt, he is referring\r\nindubitably to the pawn-shop, whose quotations are of far more moment to\r\nhim than are those of the Bourse. If you detect him in a railway\r\nstation, waiting more than half an hour for a train, it is that the\r\nshelter of the café has been, for some reason or other, temporarily\r\ndenied him. And, if he appears more than half a mile from his lodging in\r\ndressing-gown and slippers, with a salad or a bunch of radishes under\r\nhis arm, it is either because dressing-gown and slippers are, for the\r\nnonce, the sum of his wardrobe or because he has put on the\r\ndressing-gown to match compulsory slippers or the slippers to match a\r\ncompulsory dressing-gown. You may be sure he has carried the salad or\r\nradishes ever since he set out, and that he will renew them when they\r\nhave become too withered to serve his deceitful end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REAL MONTMARTRE\r\n\r\n  _La rue St. Vincent, known as “the lovers’ walk”_]\r\n\r\nHe carries his burdens buoyantly, as the best type of old man carries\r\nhis years, and, making hard necessity pass for a joke, extracts no end\r\nof amusement from his vicissitudes, caps himself with a Merry Andrew’s\r\nbonnet, and “drapes himself,” to use a phrase of Maurice Barrès, “with\r\nirony in order not to appear stark naked before men.”\r\n\r\nA young couple, who had long been habitués of a certain restaurant in\r\nthe rue Lepic, entered one night equipped with violin and guitar, made\r\nprofound obeisance to the assembled company, and announced that they had\r\ngot to earn their dinner on the spot that night, if they had one. With\r\ntheir instruments and voices they proceeded to earn it, amid their own\r\nand their whilom comrades’ jests and laughter. After a fortnight of this\r\nunenviable, if mirthful, prominence, their fortunes mended; and they\r\ndropped contentedly back into their obscurity as ordinary diners, the\r\nricher for an invigorating experience. Three handsome, long-haired,\r\nbearded fellows of the rue Menessier have taken Paris by storm this very\r\nsummer with their mandolin and guitar music in the open air.\r\n\r\nA Montmartre Bohemian, who is at once a superior musician and a species\r\nof Hercules, having made himself provisionally a _déménageur_, amused\r\nhimself mightily at his work, confounding the petty bourgeois he served,\r\nby playing their pianos. The natural though totally unforeseen result of\r\nhis somewhat impudent facetiousness was an opportunity to give lessons,\r\nwhich floated him back into the musical current.\r\n\r\nAnother _Montmartrois_ (Raoul Pouchon, I think), wearied with walking\r\nthe streets the night after he had been evicted from his lodging,\r\nrevenged himself by baiting with sugar all the street curs of his\r\ndistrict, and introducing them at two o’clock in the morning into the\r\nstairway of his evictor’s house.\r\n\r\nSometimes, perhaps, these merry Montmartre shifts come near\r\ntransgressing the bounds which separate fun from lawlessness. The\r\n_déménagement à la cloche de bois_,[88] the nailing of one’s emptied\r\ntrunk to the floor to impress one’s _concièrge_ with its weight, the\r\npaying of one’s rent by abstracting the clothes of one’s landlord and\r\nputting them in pawn, and the grateful acceptance of the _pâté_, chop,\r\nor sausage brought in by one’s pilfering dog, as if one were Elijah and\r\none’s _Toutou_ were a raven of the wild, can hardly be defended by any\r\nof the recognised bourgeois codes. But even these flagrant escapades\r\nproceed less from malice than from mischief, and even these fall\r\nstrangely in line with equity in nine cases out of ten.\r\n\r\nOn its Bohemian side, Montmartre is a second and, to the thinking of\r\nmany, a greater and more brilliant _Quartier Latin_.\r\n\r\nHere abound the literary and artistic restaurants, cafés, _bouillons_,\r\n_crèmeries_, and cabarets which have always conferred a peculiar charm\r\non Paris. Here, as well as in the Latin Quarter (and more numerous and\r\nvaried, perhaps, here than there), are the modern counterparts of the\r\n_Treille d’Or_, the _Pomme de Pin_, the _Radis Couronné_, the _Pressoir\r\nd’Or_, the _Ceinture qui Craque_, the _Deux Torches_, and the _Trois\r\nEntonnoirs_ of the time of Cyrano; the _Procope_, _de Valois_, _de Foy_,\r\n_du Caveau_, and _Mécanique_ of the time of Louis XVI.; the _Viot_,\r\n_Bléry_, _Flicoteaux_, _de Buci_, and _de la Rotonde_ of the Restoration\r\nand Louis Philippe; the _Molière_, _Voltaire_, _L’Orient_, “_Sherry\r\nCobbler_,” and _Bobino_ of the last empire. And here they have been long\r\nenough to have already developed their legends and _esprit de corps_.\r\n\r\nIn the _Brasseries des Martyrs_ and _Fontaine_, _Cabarets de\r\nRamponneau_, _de la Grande Pinte_, _du Plus Grand Bock_, and _de la\r\nPlace Belhomme_, and the _Cafés Jean Goujon_, _Laplace_, _de la Nouvelle\r\nAthénée_, and _Du Rat Mort_,[89] poets and painters, now grizzled,\r\nchattered and revelled before the grey hairs came. Dinochaux, of the\r\n_Café Dinochaux_ (rue Bréda), who nourished several of his patrons\r\ngratis for years, and bestowed credit unsolicited on any one who showed\r\nhimself worthy in literature or art, has taken his place in history\r\nalongside of Ragueneau, the keeper of the _Rôtisserie des Poètes_ of\r\n_Cyrano_.\r\n\r\nYou recall Ragueneau, the quaint saint, it is to be hoped. If not, here\r\nis a scrap of dialogue to evoke him:—\r\n\r\n     “CYRANO. _Bercés par ta voix.\r\n   Ne vois-tu pas comme ils s’empiffrent?_\r\n\r\n     “RAGUENEAU. _Je le vois....\r\n   Sans regarder, de peur que cela ne les trouble;\r\n   Et dire ainsi mes vers me donne un plaisir double,\r\n   Puisque je satisfais un doux faible que j’ai,\r\n   Tout en laissant manger ceux qui n’ont pas mangé._\r\n\r\n     “CYRANO (lui frappant sur l’épaule). _Toi, tu me plais!_”\r\n\r\nThe cook at Marguéry’s, being asked once upon a time what he thought of\r\nthe _Vache Enragée_, replied: “_Mon dieu, de la vache enragée! Je crois\r\nqu’on pourrait en faire un plat mangeable avec beaucoup de bonne humeur\r\net des petites femmes autour._”\r\n\r\nAt Montmartre the sagacious chef’s words are daily verified. At\r\nMontmartre, if nowhere else in the world, the _Vache Enragée_ is a\r\n“_plat mangeable_.”\r\n\r\nThe line of boulevards extending from the Place de Clichy to the Place\r\nd’Anvers which strikes American tourists, who visit it for Montmartre,\r\nas a vulgar hodge-podge of Coney Island, the Bowery, the Broadway of the\r\nTenderloin, and South Fifth Avenue, with a dash of, say, a Boston “Pop”\r\nconcert on a Harvard night, is no more the real Montmartre than Paris is\r\nthe real France. The real Montmartre is the abrupt hill known as “The\r\nButte,” just north of said boulevards[90] and included between\r\nthem,—the rue Marcadet, the rue de Clignancourt, and the avenue de St.\r\nOuen, a section of which the gigantic Byzantine cathedral of the _Sacré\r\nCœur_, the _Moulin de la Galette_, until recently an unsophisticated\r\npopular ball, and the _cimetière de Montmartre_ (the second cemetery of\r\nParis) are the salient features.\r\n\r\nThis real Montmartre (the Montmartre of the Butte) contains a tiny local\r\ncemetery (long disused), a tiny twelfth-century parochial church (St.\r\nPierre), a tiny district theatre, a tiny village plaza (Place du Tertre)\r\nwith the customary trees, benches, and aged, ruminating idlers, a tiny\r\npublic park (Square St. Pierre), two gaunt, grey windmills, and several\r\nsleepy wine-shops, over which sleepy publicans preside. Here are five,\r\nsix, and seven story city buildings, to be sure, but here are also\r\n(particularly on the northern slope) ancient garden-girdled mansions\r\nreminiscent of the epoch when the whole district was open country;\r\nsculptured gate-posts, crumbling, but stately, and rusty iron gates\r\nopening on symmetrical avenues; small one-and-a-half-story tile-roofed\r\nand straw-thatched dwellings, also garden-girdled, clutching with the\r\ngrip of the Swiss chalet the steep hillsides; narrow streets and winding\r\nlanes, and worn stone stairways where the hill’s incline forbids streets\r\nand lanes; high, erratic, heavily buttressed stone walls, bulging with\r\nage, over which houses also bulging with age (from the windows of which\r\na Paul might be let down in a basket) beetle as if to fall; diminutive\r\nfruit orchards and vegetable gardens; and diminutive barnyards,\r\ncluttered with chicken-coops, dove-cotes, pig-pens, and rabbit-cages,\r\nwhich advertise cows’ and goats’ milk, compost, and young pigs for sale.\r\nHere cats and dogs and hens roam multitudinous and unmolested, birds\r\nsing in the shrubbery, and chanticleer proclaims the dawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REAL MONTMARTRE\r\n\r\n   “_One would believe himself more than two hundred miles from\r\n   Paris._”]\r\n\r\nIn sum, the Butte, the real Montmartre, seems at first view to be\r\none-half country village and one-half large provincial town. In the rue\r\nSt. Vincent, the rue Mont-Cénis, the rue des Saules, rue de la\r\nFontaine-du-But, rue de la Borne, rue St. Rustique, rue Norvins, and rue\r\nde l’Abreuvoir, where one is scarcely a twenty minutes’ walk from the\r\nGrands-Boulevards, one would believe himself more than two hundred miles\r\nfrom the metropolis,—so different are these streets from the average\r\nmetropolitan ways,—were it not for the constant outlooks on Paris\r\nspread out beneath one, for the large proportion of Angoras among the\r\nubiquitous cats, and the phenomenal _savoir-vivre_, good-nature, and\r\nfriendliness of the dogs; were it not for an indefinable coquetry,\r\ntell-tale of Parisianism, about the little garden-girdled houses and a\r\nhundred artistic whimsicalities, such as are represented by a windmill\r\nstudio and a tram-car dwelling; were it not also that certain vistas are\r\nclosed by the flippant entrance to the _Moulin de la Galette_, that\r\nsundry glimpses of studio interiors are vouchsafed, and that silhouettes\r\nof long-haired, capering artists and of artists’ models loom up fitfully\r\nagainst the sky; and were there not a sort of vagabond humour in the\r\nvery atmosphere that accords ill with provincial straight-lacedness.\r\n\r\nAs the Butte wears the general aspect of a provincial community, so it\r\nhas the provincial community’s spirit of neighbourliness; but, as its\r\nprovincial aspect is enlivened by coquetry and mirth, so its provincial\r\nneighbourliness is happily modified by being shorn of the meddling\r\nspirit. The _Montmartrois_ is not indifferent to the welfare of his\r\nfellow-_Montmartrois_; but he minds his own business, which the\r\nneighbourly provincial rarely, if ever, does. He is as willing as the\r\nmost naïve countryman to lend a helping hand upon occasion; but, the\r\noccasion passed, he speedily effaces himself. He does not feel entitled\r\nto enter into your intimacy, to summer and winter with you, so to say,\r\nbecause he has done you a casual good turn.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered Montmartre, as most fellows enter it, with my _lares and\r\npenates_ enthroned on a hand-cart, and experienced the difficulty other\r\nfellows, thus encumbered, have experienced in scaling the Butte, a\r\nbutcher’s boy and an artist who was sketching in the street were prompt\r\nto put their shoulders to the wheel (to the tail-board, to be strictly\r\naccurate); but they did not by the same token cross-question me\r\nregarding my antecedents and intentions, as countrymen, in the same\r\ncircumstances, would have done. They gracefully accepted my invitation\r\nto a social glass at an adjacent wine-shop, then went their ways to\r\ntheir respective tasks; and that was the end of it.\r\n\r\nThe Butte, then, the real Montmartre, is in Paris, but not of it, and\r\nyet, of necessity, perpetually conscious of it,—a community which is\r\nand which is not a provincial town, which has an _esprit de corps_ not\r\ninconsistent with independence, a unity not destructive of variety, and\r\na sociability admirably accordant with a seemly privacy; while the\r\n_Montmartrois_ sees Paris without being blinded by it, touches Paris\r\nwithout being crushed by it, and is stimulated by Paris without losing\r\nhis identity therein.\r\n\r\n   “_J’ vis en philosophe et p’tê’t’ bien\r\n     Qu’étant presqu’heureux avec rien,\r\n     J’ai su résoudre un grav’ problème,\r\n     A mon septième_,”\r\n\r\nsings a _chansonnier_ of Montmartre. And it is indeed this ability to\r\n“be almost happy with nothing,” this fairy-godmother power to transform\r\nby a simple flourish a pumpkin into a coach, a dowdy into a fair\r\nprincess, and a cabbage into a rose, this talent, amounting to genius,\r\nfor squeezing so very much more out of life than there really is in it,\r\nthat lifts completely out of the commonplace the life of Montmartre.\r\n\r\nFor four hundred to five hundred francs a year, monsieur and madame,—as\r\nin the Latin Quarter every Jack has his Jill, so on the Butte every\r\n_Montmartrois_ has his _Montmartroise_,—monsieur and madame may have a\r\n_logement_,[91] consisting of two or three rooms and a kitchen with\r\npeerless views of Paris and the valley of the Seine; and in the shops of\r\nthe _brocanteurs_ they may procure antique furnishings of real beauty\r\nand durability, not, alas! for the proverbial song, but for less than\r\nthe bourgeois pay for their ugly, up-to-date flimflams.\r\n\r\nPrices are dearer at Montmartre than in several other parts of Paris.\r\nNevertheless, there is no district where, day in and day out, there is\r\nso much genuine poetry and so much honest zest in living.\r\n\r\nLouise France,[92] a dramatic artist of vigorous talent, who has been\r\nassociated with nearly all the important literary movements of\r\nMontmartre, is said to have welcomed a party of friends to her modest\r\n_logement_ one day with, “_Maintenant, en guise d’apéritif, je vais vous\r\noffrir une vue splendide sur Paris: c’est tout ce que je possède_.”\r\n\r\nGood Madame France is a thorough _Montmartroise_, and the incident is\r\nadmirably representative of the jocund humour of the Butte. The\r\n_Montmartrois_ will not only regale himself with a view from a window in\r\nlieu of an _apéritif_, but he will merrily substitute a _chanson_ for a\r\nroast, console himself with a kiss for the absence of the dessert, and\r\nwarm himself, as my friend L——, who has not had a fire for three\r\nwinters, expresses it, with sunsets and tobacco smoke,—his own, if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nDuring the periods of moving (namely, the 1st to the 15th of January,\r\nApril, July, and October) the essential domesticity of the Butte is\r\namply and amusingly revealed, and the complete congruity of domesticity\r\nand the arts is graphically demonstrated.\r\n\r\nChiffonniers lord it over model-thrones, paint brushes peep over the\r\nrims of soup-kettles or hide their heads in coal-scuttles, manikins\r\nfraternise with hat-trees and colour-boxes with stew-pans, stretchers\r\nsnuggle up to pillows, pastels and aquarelles lie cheek by jowl with\r\ndish-towels and table-cloths, brooms pay court to easels, palettes make\r\neyes at feather dusters, and impressionistic landscapes dazzle mirrors.\r\nMonsieur, aided by a chum, tugs a precariously loaded hand-cart,[93] or,\r\nif the distance to be traversed makes the hand-cart unnecessary or a\r\nlack of funds makes it impossible, he staggers, sweats, and swears under\r\nthe weight of trunks, chests, bureaus, and wardrobes; and madame,\r\nbareheaded, in wrapper and slippers, proffers highly unwelcome caution\r\nand advice while carrying the company coffee-cups or the parlour lamp.\r\n\r\nLike most other localities that partake of the idyllic, Montmartre is\r\nmost idyllic in the spring. Then painters work at their easels in its\r\nstreets, while their mesdames, who have followed them forth with\r\ncamp-chairs, sew and chatter in the nearest shade. Then its poplars and\r\nlimes are the same crisp, inviting green as the salads that pass in the\r\nhand-barrows. Then its myriad lilac, horse-chestnut, and acacia clusters\r\nare thyrsi awaiting the rhythmic wavings of the bacchanals, and then its\r\ncircumambient fragrance would inflame a Hippolyta’s blood, trouble a\r\nVestal’s vows, and make a Diana’s senses reel. Then, too, models, posing\r\nin court-yards and back gardens for the supernal effects of sunlight on\r\nflesh, are like great pink-and-purple-dappled exotic blooms escaped from\r\nShelley’s pages.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of nature that with soft music is bursting the bonds of\r\nwinter, and the spirit of the artist, spontaneous, impulsive,\r\ncapricious, and free, are in absolute accord. One breathes contempt for\r\nprudery and custom with the very air. Nature’s upward-rushing sap and\r\nthe artist’s careering fancy alike defy repression.\r\n\r\n“_Tout être a le droit d’être libre_,” the splendid throbbing lyric\r\nclimax of Charpentier’s Montmartre opera, _Louise_, had here its origin.\r\n\r\n“TOUT ÊTRE A LE DROIT D’ÊTRE LIBRE!”—the careless attire, unconstrained\r\nmien, and the _sans-gêne_ of the lovers of Montmartre proclaim it.\r\n\r\n“TOUT ÊTRE A LE DROIT D’ÊTRE LIBRE!” the Montmartre winds and birds and\r\nrivulets sing.\r\n\r\n   “_Et que faudrait-il faire?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   _Calculer, avoir peur, être blême,\r\n    Préférer faire une visite qu’un poème,\r\n    Rédiger des placets, se faire-présenter?\r\n    Non, merci! non, merci! non, merci! mais chanter,\r\n    Rêver, rire, passer, être seul, être libre,\r\n    Avoir l’œil qui regarde bien, la voix qui vibre,\r\n    Mettre, quand il vous plaît, son feutre de travers,\r\n    Pour un oui, pour un non, se battre—ou faire un vers!\r\n    Travailler sans souci de gloire ou de fortune,\r\n    A tel voyage, auquel on pense, dans la lune._”[94]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Montmartre Carrousel]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nLITERARY AND ARTISTIC CABARETS OF MONTMARTRE\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_We sang when the English dismembered the kingdom, we sang\r\n   during the civil war of the Armagnacs, during the ‘Ligue,’\r\n   during the Fronde, under the Régence; and it was to the sound of\r\n   the_ chansons _of Rivarol that the monarchy disappeared at the end\r\n   of the eighteenth century._”—DE JOUY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_The_ chanson _became history: it donned defiantly the Phrygian\r\n   bonnet, and marched in the forefront.... Men went singing to the\r\n   guillotine._” HENRI AVENEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_It is certain that the_ chanson _is, like wine, a product of our\r\n   soil, a flower of_ la patrie.”—JULES CLARETIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “And I send these words to Paris with my love,\r\n   And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them.”\r\n   WALT WHITMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bohemians of the _Quartier Latin_ who do not starve, commit suicide,\r\nreturn to their parents to eat the fatted calf, become rich and famous\r\nor alcoholic and insane, have one other resource left them,—a resource\r\nbeside which the proverbial jump out of the frying-pan into the fire is\r\nthe quintessence of discretion,—namely, emigration to Montmartre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REAL MONTMARTRE\r\n\r\n  _Cabaret du Lapin Agile_]\r\n\r\nOriginally given over to windmills and plaster ovens, a suburb at the\r\ntime of the Great Revolution (when it went for a while by the name of\r\nMont-Marat), Montmartre did not become a part of Paris proper until\r\n1859.\r\n\r\n   “I knew Montmartre,” says one of its ardent admirers,\r\n   “thirty-five years ago. It was a quarter like another, less\r\n   alive, in fact, than most others, except in the immediate\r\n   vicinity of the balls, _le Grand Turc_, _la Boule Noire_, etc.\r\n\r\n   “All of a sudden the Haussmannising empire bound it to Paris by\r\n   the Boulevard Magenta, and the picks of the workmen have had no\r\n   respite since.”\r\n\r\nThe Eighteenth Arrondissement, which corresponds roughly with\r\nMontmartre, has nearly doubled in population since the Franco-Prussian\r\nwar, and is now a city of more than 225,000 souls.\r\n\r\n   “Travellers tell us,” wrote Aurélien Scholl in 1898, “that in\r\n   America cities spring up with incredible rapidity.... I know\r\n   only two localities in France which have undergone a similar\r\n   speedy transformation,—Royan[95] and Montmartre. It is not so\r\n   very long ago that we saw from the boulevards looking up the\r\n   rue Laffitte a verdant _butte_ with a few windmills whose arms\r\n   enlivened the perspective. There were hovels and tiny,\r\n   shabby-looking shops along the present boulevards (Clichy and\r\n   Rochechouart).\r\n\r\n   “Montmartre is to-day one of the finest cities of France. It\r\n   has three theatres, five or six _cafés-concerts_, a circus,\r\n   restaurants, and _brasseries_.... _La cigale_ sings there all\r\n   summer—and all winter.”\r\n\r\nIn the partial eyes of the loyal _Montmartrois_, Montmartre, “_Ville\r\nLibre_,” literary and artistic Bohemia _par excellence_, is as much the\r\ncapital of Paris[96] as Paris is the capital of France. To them all the\r\nrest of Paris, the Latin Quarter included, is merely Montmartre’s back\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nMontmartre, by reason of its surpassing view, has always been favoured\r\nas a place of residence by detached writers and artists; and, after the\r\nclosing of the _Théâtre Bobino_ in the _Quartier Latin_, a perceptible\r\nliterary and artistic current thitherward set in. But it was the exodus\r\nof the “_Hydropathes_” and “_Hirsutes_” of the _Quartier_ to the _Chat\r\nNoir_ that marked (marked rather than caused) the real beginning of\r\nMontmartre’s supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe _Cercle des Hydropathes_[97] owed its origin to one Charles Cros,\r\nwho, tiring of being relegated to an inglorious obscurity while Coquelin\r\n_Cadet_ won laurels by the recitation of monologues, which he (Cros) had\r\nwritten, decided to recite his monologues himself.\r\n\r\nThe first formal meeting of the _Hydropathes_ was held on a Friday of\r\nOctober, 1878, in a small upper room of a Latin Quarter café, corner of\r\nthe rue Cujas and the Boulevard St. Michel. There were five persons\r\npresent. At the next meeting there were seventy-five, at the third one\r\nhundred, at the fourth one hundred and fifty, and so on, until, driven\r\nfrom café to café by the need of more room, they settled in a vacant\r\nstore, with an average attendance of three hundred to three hundred and\r\nfifty twice a week.\r\n\r\nEmile Goudeau presided,—as nearly, that is, as any one can be said to\r\npreside in a Latin Quarter assembly. There was liberty to drink, smoke,\r\nand woo the _grisette_. There were folly and tumult, confusion and fun;\r\nviolin, piano, and guitar music; singing in concert of riotous\r\nroof-lifting refrains; recitations of novelties and the classics by\r\nVillain, Leloir, Le Bargy, and Coquelin _Cadet_ of the _Comédie\r\nFrançaise_. Paul Mounet, also of the _Comédie_, arrayed in a blue blouse\r\nand red neckerchief, interpreted _La Grève des Forgerons_ week in and\r\nweek out with telling effect. Maurice Rollinat sang his own songs and\r\nthose of Pierre Dupont, and recited selections from his _Névroses_ and\r\n_Brandes_. Laurent Tailhade, Jean Moréas, Georges d’Esparbès, Louis\r\nMarsolleau, Jean Ajalbert, André Gill, Léon Valade, Charles Monselet,\r\nPaul Marrot, Edmond Haraucourt, Félicien Champsaur, Mac-Nab, Auguste\r\nVacquerie, Louis Tiercelin, Alphonse Allais, Jules Jouy, and a full\r\nscore more of poets and _chansonniers_ rendered their works. Bourget,\r\nCoppée, Paul Arène, Luigi Loir, and Bastien-Lepage were frequent, though\r\nfor the most part passive, spectators. All degrees of talent, all shades\r\nof politics, and all of the poetic schools were represented. Bernhardt\r\nwas proud to be known as a _Hydropathe_. Francisque Sarcey and Jules\r\nClaretie visited the _Hydropathes_, and praised them in the press. The\r\npolice threatened to dissolve them, but wisely refrained.\r\n\r\nThe _Hirsutes_ differed from the _Hydropathes_ only in name and in the\r\nfact that the name had an obvious significance.\r\n\r\nIt was the _Grand’ Pinte_ (a Louis XIII. cabaret of Montmartre,\r\nfrequented, but without mummery or fracas, by a band of painters and\r\npoets) that gave Rodolphe Salis, an _ex-Hydropathe_, the idea of putting\r\nthe boisterous _Hydropathe_ performances into a picturesque setting and\r\ninviting the paying public to attend. Salis, who was the son of a\r\nprosperous man of affairs, was in Bohemia against his father’s wishes.\r\nHalf-artist and half-littérateur, he supported himself, when the\r\npaternal purse-strings were tightened, by writing for the press and\r\npainting _Viae Dolorosae_ at fourteen francs apiece. In making himself\r\n“_gentilhomme-cabaretier_,” as he called it, this resourceful Salis had\r\nhit upon a device for reconciling theory with practice, filial\r\nsubmission with personal inclination, and Bohemia with business, which,\r\nto say the least, was not commonplace.\r\n\r\nSalis’ _Chat Noir_, “_Cabaret Moyen-Age fondé en 1114 par un fumiste_,”\r\nwas opened on the Boulevard de Rochechouart in December, 1881; and the\r\nfirst number of its literary organ of the same name, illustrated by\r\nForain, Willette, Rochegrosse, Henri Pille, Rivière, and Steinlen, was\r\npublished the month following. The cabaret’s bizarre frescos,\r\ncontributed by the cleverest young artists of Paris, and its fantastic\r\nfurnishings of curios and antiques, which Salis had zealously collected\r\nsince his boyhood, have been described too many times to be dwelt upon\r\nhere. Suffice it to say, the juxtaposition of the beautiful with the\r\ngrotesque, the serious with the flippant, and the reverent with the\r\nblasphemous, was so ingenious and piquant that attempts to imitate it\r\n(for the most part unsuccessful) have been made all over the civilised\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT ARISTIDE BRUANT’S\r\n\r\n  _Cabaret du Boulevard Rochechouart_]\r\n\r\nIn this suggestive setting nearly the entire _personnel_ of the\r\n_Hydropathes_ and a number of poets and dramatists, not _Hydropathes_,\r\nwho have since become celebrities, among them Georges Courtéline and\r\nMaurice Donnay, held witty carnival.\r\n\r\nThere was an even greater license of speech and act at the _Chat Noir_\r\nthan there had been among the _Hydropathes_. There were also more\r\nall-night revels, more startling antitheses of the lively and severe,\r\nand more practical joking. All this in spite of the fact (or, perhaps,\r\nbecause of it) that the performers, almost without exception, affected\r\nimpassibility, maintaining a supernatural gravity while dispensing the\r\nmost side-splitting productions.\r\n\r\nSalis’ attempt to serve both God and Mammon resulted, as such attempts\r\nhave usually resulted, advantageously for Mammon. Bohemia was reconciled\r\nto business by being completely swallowed up by business. Salis, the\r\n_gentilhomme-cabaretier_, waxed rich, and in waxing rich stooped to\r\nmethods of holding and dealing with his galaxy that have made his memory\r\nthe execration of the Butte. Nevertheless, Rodolphe Salis, all unworthy\r\nBohemian as his good fortune revealed him to be, gave Paris, as\r\nimpresario of the _Chat Noir_, a new manifestation of art and did more\r\nthan any one man towards establishing that modern republic of arts and\r\nletters which is known as Montmartre.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenal success of the _Chat Noir_, whose fame from being\r\nParisian became European, naturally led to the opening of establishments\r\nwhich copied one or more of its features. Montmartre was soon\r\nhoneycombed with _cabarets artistiques et littéraires._\r\n\r\nSteinlen, Willette, De Feure, Roedel, Redon, Toulouse-Lautrec, Truchet,\r\nBellanger, Le Petit, Grün, and other artists of the Butte, especially\r\nthe first three, were kept busy decorating; and the most popular\r\nmonologists and _chansonniers_,—Dominique Bonnaud, Hugues Delorme,\r\nJacques Ferny, Jules Jouy, E. Girault, Eugène Lemercier, Camille\r\nMarceau, Georges Millandy, Marcel Legay, Gaston Couté, Paul Delmet,\r\nThéodore Botrel, Léon Durôcher, Vincent Hyspa, Yann Nibor, Maurice\r\nBoukay, Charles Gallilée, Jehan Rictus, Octave Pradels, Victor Meusy,\r\nCamille Roy, Gabriel Montoya, Edmond Teulet, Paul Briand, Xavier Privas,\r\nRaoul Ponchon, Fragson, Lefèvre, Xanrof, Perducet, Dumestre, Montéhus,\r\nIvanof, Chatillon, Fursy, Canqueteau, and Trimouillat,—most of whom had\r\nreceived a part of their training at the _Chat Noir_,—performed\r\nregularly in two or three places on the same evening.\r\n\r\n_La Grand’ Pinte_ (joint inspirer with the _Hydropathes_ of the _Chat\r\nNoir_) became under the direction of another Salis—Gabriel—the\r\n_cabaret artistique et littéraire, L’Ane Rouge_. Its next-door\r\nneighbour, _Le Clou_, fitted itself out with a picturesque second-story\r\nsupper-room and an eccentric _caveau_, in which tourneys of poetry were\r\nfrequently given. _Le Café des Décadents_ (later _Café Duclerc_, where\r\nthe singers wore nooses about their necks), with its “_Bruxellois\r\nSoupers_”; _Le Carillon_, with its “Assizes”; _Le Fraternistère_, with\r\nits “_Guignol Social_” and its “_chansons et recréations\r\nsociologiques_”; _Le Casino des Concièrges_, with its “_Soupers\r\nPanamistes_”; _La Fourrière_ (The Pound), _La Roulotte_ (The Gypsy Van),\r\n_Le Cabaret des Assassins_ (now _Le Lapin Agile_), _Le Cabaret des\r\nPommes-de-terre Frites_, _La Purée_, _La Purée Sociale_, and the\r\n_Cabarets du Ciel, de l’Enfer_, and _du Néant_,—had each its little day\r\nof notoriety; and the last three, though by all odds the flattest of the\r\nlot, are still run for the benefit of country visitors.\r\n\r\n_Le Conservatoire_ (whose specialty is the _Théâtre d’Ombres\r\nChinoises_—shadow pantomime—with which the subtle artist Henri Rivière\r\nhelped build up the vogue of Salis), _Le Cabaret des Quat’z’ Arts_, _Le\r\nCabaret des Arts_, _La Veine_, and _La Lune Rousse_ are the five closest\r\nexisting counterparts of the _Chat Noir_. Their decorations are highly\r\neffective, and they employ most of the _Chat Noir_ celebrities who have\r\nnot, like Salis, passed over to the great majority.[98] But their\r\nperformances, while of high average merit, are totally lacking in the\r\nelements of spontaneity and unexpectedness, which constituted the rare\r\nand peculiar charm of the programmes of the _Chat Noir_ in its early and\r\nunspoiled days; and their prices, which have increased in direct\r\nproportion as intrinsic interest has decreased, are prohibitive for most\r\nof the real Bohemians of Montmartre. The truth is, these cabarets have\r\nlong ceased to attract the _Montmartrois_, and are kept up as mere show\r\nplaces for provincial and foreign tourists. It is only in their front\r\nrooms, where prices are normal and no performances worth mentioning are\r\ngiven—at the hour of the _apéritif_, that one may find any number of\r\ntruly representative _Montmartrois_.\r\n\r\nAt _La Boîte à Fursy_ (in the building to which the _Chat Noir_ repaired\r\nwhen the complaints of its neighbours and the need of more room forced\r\nit to quit its original home on the Boulevard de Rochechouart) and _Le\r\nTréteau de Tabarin_ (also under the management of Fursy) the prices are\r\nstill more prohibitive, so far as Bohemia is concerned, and the\r\naudiences, by just so much the more, unrepresentative.\r\n\r\nAll these places have been practically abandoned by their former\r\npatrons, and by the unprofessional singing, rhyming, reciting Bohemians\r\nin general, for tiny, obscure cafés or wine-shops,[99] whose tininess\r\nand obscurity are defences against sight-seeing invasion, and for\r\nprivate ateliers, from which the uninvited may be readily ejected. Those\r\nwho, depressed by the professionalism, mercenary spirit, and monotony of\r\nthe best-known cabarets, declare that the spirit of Bohemianism has\r\nabandoned the Butte, do not take into account these multitudinous\r\nBohemian conclaves, of which they are, in all probability, totally\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nOne group, to which for two years the writer was privileged to belong,\r\nincluded fifty members, whose ages ranged from twenty to seventy and\r\nwhose reputations ranged from zero to boulevard celebrity. It dined\r\nevery Tuesday evening at a really cheap and really Bohemian restaurant\r\nof the rue de la Rochefoucauld, adjourned after dinner to the atelier of\r\na musician in the rue Bréda for literary and musical exercises mingled\r\nwith horse-play, and readjourned at midnight to the supper-room of an\r\nadjacent café for unadulterated horse-play, without the slightest\r\nliterary or musical pretence.\r\n\r\nIn France the _chanson_ is second only to the press (if, indeed, it\r\nreally be second to anything) as a moulder of public opinion. It\r\ninstructs less than the press, perhaps, but it excites more.\r\n\r\n   “The _chanson_, like the bayonet,” says Jules Claretie, “is a\r\n   French weapon.... We are afraid of the _chanson_. It is a\r\n   dishevelled personage who tells the truth. We exile it, we\r\n   pursue it. M. Javert pursued not otherwise Fantine.... We are\r\n   afraid of it because it is necessarily, fatally, of the\r\n   opposition. It has no reason for existence, if it is not\r\n   factious.... From the _Mazarinades_ to the amusing _Chansons\r\n   Rosses_ of Fursy, the _chanson_ has administered fillips to the\r\n   powers. It is its lot. I add, it is its right.... _Vive la\r\n   chanson_! even the cruel _chanson_, when it is a sort of\r\n   Daumier!”\r\n\r\nOnly a small percentage of the songs heard in the _cabarets artistiques\r\net littéraires_ of Montmartre are frankly revolutionary or even “of the\r\nopposition,” in the narrow partisan sense of that phrase; but they\r\nnearly all “tell the truth to people,” they are nearly all satirical and\r\ncaptious to the last degree—“of the opposition,” that is, in the\r\nbroader sense of the phrase. They assail all the existing\r\ninstitutions,—army, state, church, property, and marriage,—not with\r\nthe direct invective which would put them at the censorship’s mercy, but\r\nwith the ridicule which in Paris, as in perhaps no other spot on the\r\nglobe, is more potent than invective, and before which the censorship,\r\nthough it turn pale and tear its hair with rage, is powerless.\r\n\r\nJules Jouy,[100] one of the bright particular stars of the _Chat Noir_\r\nand of several of its successors and imitators, was at once a veritable\r\nGavroche for saucy wit and a fervent pleader for the poor. He was a\r\nregular contributor to several socialistic sheets; and his _Chansons de\r\nBataille_—_La Terre_, _Les Enfants et les Mères_, _La Veuve_, _Fille\r\nd’Ouvrier_, _Les Inconnus_, _La Grève Noire_, _Pâle Travailleur_,\r\n_Victimes du Travail_, _Le Sang des Martyrs_, _La Carmagnole des\r\nMeurts-de-Faim_, etc.—are superb examples of the chanson of social\r\nrevolt and reclamation.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the _Casino des Concièrges_, _Le Cabaret des\r\nPommes-de-terre Frites_, and _La Purée Sociale_, was an ancient\r\nrevolutionist, Maxime Lisbonne, who had distinguished himself on a\r\nbarricade of the Place du Panthéon during the Commune.\r\n\r\nIn the supper-rooms of the _Clou_ the anarchist poet Paul Paillette was\r\nwont to recite his anarchist poems, and the _Clou_ is still a favourite\r\nmeeting-place for revolutionary groups.\r\n\r\nAt the _Quat’z’ Arts_ Marcel Legay varies his répertoire of sentimental\r\nand patriotic ballads with the stirring revolutionary _chansons_ of\r\nMaurice Boukay and J. B. Clément; Gaston Couté recites his subversive\r\n“_Les Conscrits_” and “_Le Christ en Bois_”; Eugène Lemercier with\r\ngenial malice, Gaston Sécot with waggery, and Yon Lug with Chinese\r\nimperturbability ridicule officialism in its every phase; Xavier Privas\r\n(Prince of _Chansonniers_ by formal election), in his highly individual\r\nand snappy fashion, renders—between two idyls—his fine socialistic\r\nsong _Les Résignés_ or exalts poverty with his _Noël_ or _Testament de\r\nPierrot_; and Jehan Rictus intones his heart-breaking _Soliloques du\r\nPauvre_.\r\n\r\nThe _Quat’z’ Arts_ has also had courses of Sunday afternoon lectures on\r\nthe _chanson_ by the socialist deputies Clovis Hugues and Maurice\r\nBoukay.\r\n\r\nThe _Boîte à Fursy_, though catering palpably to the snobs, is shut up\r\nnearly every season by an irate censorship, and this more often for\r\nreasons of politics than from any consideration of public morality.\r\n\r\n   “I have been allowed this merit, and it is the sole one I\r\n   claim,” says Fursy, in the introduction to his _Chansons\r\n   Rosses_, “of never letting pass, or rarely letting pass, a\r\n   salient happening without singing it immediately, and\r\n   attempting to draw from it, in a refrain, the morality—or\r\n   immorality—which the worthy man called _Monsieur Tout-le-Monde_\r\n   assigns it in his talk. I do my utmost not to lose time, and to\r\n   serve actuality piping hot. I am really satisfied only when I\r\n   manage to sing, in the evening, couplets inspired by that\r\n   morning’s event; and I have had the luck almost always to\r\n   succeed.”\r\n\r\nEven the _Cabarets du Ciel_, _de l’Enfer_, and _du Néant_—which, being\r\nmainly dependent for their effects upon machinery, hardly belong at all\r\nin the class of _cafés artistiques et littéraires_—have, lurking under\r\nall their vulgar clap-trap, no small fund of pungent satire on religion\r\nand the church.[101]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buffalo]\r\n\r\nFinally, there are at Montmartre a round half-dozen resorts, _cabarets\r\nde la chanson d’argot_ (also called _cabarets brutaux_), of which\r\nBruant’s _Mirliton_, Alexandre’s _Cabaret Bruyant_, and “Buffalo’s”\r\n_l’Alouette_ are the most conspicuous examples. They have had their day\r\nso far as spontaneity is concerned, like the _cabarets artistiques et\r\nlittéraires_, though, like them, they still attract foreigners and\r\nprovincials.\r\n\r\nMercenary and meretricious now to the last degree, however genuine they\r\nmay have been in the beginning, they still have this much, at least, of\r\nsincerity,—namely, cordial detestation of the bourgeois; and it is to\r\nthis very spirit, strangely enough, that their vogue with the bourgeois\r\nhas been due.\r\n\r\nIt was of one of these _cabarets brutaux_ (Bruant’s _Mirliton_,\r\nprobably) that Zola wrote in _Paris_: “Pleasure-seeking Paris, the\r\n_Bourgeoisie_, mistress of money and of power, sickened by their\r\npossessions in time, but unwilling to let anything go, flocked\r\nthither—to receive insults and obscenities full in the face.... Far\r\nmore than in the words, the burning insult was in the manner with which\r\nthe singer cast the words in the teeth of the rich, of the favoured, of\r\nthe fine ladies who elbowed each other to hear him. Under the low\r\nceiling, amid the smoke of pipes, in the blinding heat of the gas, he\r\nlaunched his verses brutally like _crachats_, a very hail-squall of\r\nfurious contempt.”\r\n\r\nBruant himself rarely appears nowadays at his _Mirliton_, which, with\r\nthe aid of under-studies, he, nevertheless, keeps up. Loaded with\r\nnotoriety and wealth, he has come to prefer following the hounds or\r\nemptying a bottle of good wine, as the Châtelain of Courthenay, to\r\nentertaining the bourgeois by affronting them.\r\n\r\nNot long back Bruant was an unsuccessful candidate for deputy at\r\nBelleville, which adjoins Montmartre. His address to his electors—with\r\nwhich it is customary for candidates to placard the walls of their\r\ndistricts—was in rhyme. The verses, though not of his best, are novel\r\nenough to demand quotation:—\r\n\r\nAUX ELECTEURS\r\n\r\n_de la première conscription du vingtième arrondissement\r\nBelleville-Saint-Fargeau_\r\n\r\nPROGRAMME\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n   _Si j’étais votre député,\r\n    Ohé!

Eugénie Buffet for the\r\nbenefit of the poor[102] (his cabaret is also known as _Le Cabaret du\r\nChanteur des Cours_) and to his having been haled into court by Bruant\r\nfor plagiarising his costume. The court decided in this _cause célèbre_\r\n(Bruant _vs._ Alexandre) that the top-boots, velvet jacket, scarlet\r\nscarf, and mountaineer’s felt which Bruant wore professionally were his\r\ntrade-mark, so to speak, and that the professional costume adopted by\r\nAlexandre—which, without being an exact copy, was as close a copy as\r\nthe word “Bruyant,” for example, is of Bruant—constituted a palpable\r\ninfringement. And it granted Bruant an injunction restraining Alexandre\r\nfrom appearing therein. The judgment was reaffirmed upon appeal.\r\n\r\nIn his first burst of rage over the result, Alexandre threatened to sing\r\nwithout any costume whatsoever; but he thought better of that. What he\r\ndid do was to defy the court. Swearing there was not force enough in\r\nFrance to undress him, he persisted in wearing the prohibited garb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDRE]\r\n\r\nThese strained relations with the law of the land made a hero of\r\nAlexandre, in a small way. He became thus a sort of Jules Guérin, and\r\nhis cabaret a sort of Fort Chabrol. He elucidated the situation to his\r\naudiences nightly in a speech that ran somewhat like this:—\r\n\r\n   “What do you say to a republic where you can’t wear, so that\r\n   they be decent, any clothes you like? This business has cost\r\n   me more than ten thousand francs already. Every day—and it’s\r\n   seventeen months now it’s been going on—the sheriff appears.\r\n   ‘Still in the costume, Alexandre?’ And that means twenty\r\n   francs! Twenty francs a day—to say nothing of the costs—counts\r\n   up. Well, what of it? Let the bill swell! Let them come as\r\n   often as they please! It’s their right! But I keep on wearing\r\n   the clothes all the same.\r\n\r\n   “Not that I don’t recognise in Bruant, for all the harm he’s\r\n   trying to do me, my _cher maître_. What should I be without\r\n   him? Nothing at all. Oh, yes, I’m ready enough to admit that.\r\n   I am no ingrate. For the man who is ruining me, I have\r\n   something _there_, at the heart, which abides, and which\r\n   nothing can take away.\r\n\r\n   “When I began to wear the costume, Aristide didn’t object. Not\r\n   he. He thought me beneath his notice, I suppose. But, when he\r\n   sees I am succeeding, then he brings me up in court.\r\n\r\n   “The truth of it is, he dreads my competition. I frighten him.\r\n   My glory throws him in the shade. He says to Alexandre, ‘Get\r\n   out of my light!’\r\n\r\n   “The Law has smitten me in the name of Bruant: the Law does\r\n   not know me. Since I have sung, I have gleaned upon the public\r\n   places, in the streets, twenty-two thousand francs for the\r\n   poor; and I am ordered to strip off my trousers. There’s\r\n   justice for you!\r\n\r\n   “Now on with the music! Twenty francs to pay every time I dare\r\n   to don the forbidden costume, the costume Bruant. It’s cheap\r\n   at twenty francs. I don the costume, and I pay.”\r\n\r\nThe law is effective, it would seem, in preventing Alexandre from\r\nappearing publicly in the costume outside of his own cabaret.\r\n\r\nOut of the medley of monologists and _chansonniers_ (largely, of course,\r\nmade up of mediocrities) who practise their professions in the cabarets\r\nof Montmartre, several of genuine poetical talent have emerged; and, of\r\nthese, at least three are characterised by a thoroughly lawless or\r\nrevolutionary spirit. These three are: Aristide Bruant, who exhibits a\r\nreality, a virility, a brutality, a grim humour, a picturesqueness of\r\nepithet, a boldness of imagery, and a tragic quality in caricature which\r\nmake him (in a narrow field) a sort of French Kipling, with an honest\r\ndevil-may-care quality by the side of which Kipling’s bravado seems\r\nfustian; Jehan Rictus, less facile, less humorous, and less insolent\r\nthan Bruant, but his equal in realism and his superior in sentiment; and\r\nMaurice Boukay (retired, and now a deputy), who lacks the grip on\r\nreality of Bruant and Rictus, but who atones partially for this lack by\r\na wealth of stirring appeal.\r\n\r\nBoukay’s point of view is that of the _lettré_, the social philosopher,\r\nthe reformer, the enlightened friend of the poor. His words are words of\r\nfaith, trumpet-calls from the heights instead of gibes or moans from the\r\ndepths. They ring true of reasoned and righteous revolt. His _Chansons\r\nRouges_ are neither narrative nor descriptive; not _chansons\r\nvécues_,—that is, _chansons_ based on his own experience,—but symbolic\r\npoems,—symbolic in both language and thought, what he himself might\r\ncall “_chansons d’humanité multiple et objective_.”\r\n\r\n   “They were all written,” says M. Boukay in his introduction,\r\n   “in a complete independence of spirit, at a time when, not yet\r\n   having entered political life, I listened to the great voice\r\n   of the people, and endeavoured to seize its hidden meaning....\r\n   My master Verlaine said: ‘The _chanson_ of love is blue. The\r\n   _chanson_ of dreams is white. The _chanson_ of sadness is\r\n   grey.’ The _chanson sociale_ is red.... It is the colour of\r\n   the glass of wine that your good heart offers the vagrant to\r\n   comfort him on the high road of life. It is the colour of the\r\n   rising sun towards which your ardent, hopeful eyes yearn. It\r\n   is the most intense hue of the tricolor flag, which lies close\r\n   to the heart of all the miseries, which waves in the wind of\r\n   all the liberties.\r\n\r\n   “‘Stop there!’ exclaims some timorous spirit. ‘Do you not\r\n   fear, singer of fraternity, to deepen the regrets and inflame\r\n   the anguish of the people under pretext of describing them?’\r\n\r\n   “But, my good critic, will voicing the plaint of him who\r\n   travails and suffers, always, then, be to wound the\r\n   sanctimonious egoisms of him who digests and does nothing\r\n   else? Would you resemble the iniquitous rich man,—tolerate the\r\n   stretching forth of the hand, silent and ashamed, to beg, and\r\n   forbid the quivering lips to groan? If you do not hear the\r\n   groan, how can you console it? If you do not see the sore\r\n   of poverty stripped of all its bandages, how will you know how\r\n   to cure it?... Be brave and be just, good critic! Open thine\r\n   eyes! Open thy heart!... The love of woman has for its\r\n   necessary complement the love of humanity. Is this your\r\n   belief? If yes, you will sing these _Chansons Rouges_. If no,\r\n   you will let the people sing them. In any case, you will\r\n   understand.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT ALEXANDRE’S\r\n\r\n  _Cabaret de la rue Pigalle_]\r\n\r\nThe titles of the _Chansons Rouges_ bear out the promise of this\r\nforeword: _Le Soleil Rouge_, _Le Coq Rouge_, _Le Noël Rouge_, _L’Etoile\r\nRouge_, _La Cité_, _La Chanson du Pauvre Chanteur_, _Fille et\r\nSouteneur_, _La Chanson de Nature_, _Le Mot Passé_, _La Dernière\r\nBastille_, _La Madeleine_, _La Femme Libre_, _Les Rafles_, _La Chanson\r\nde Misère_; and the songs bear out the promise of their titles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAURICE BOUKAY]\r\n\r\nNote the thrilling refrain of _Le Soleil Rouge_,—\r\n\r\n   “_Compagnon, le vieux monde bouge:\r\n       Marchons droit, la main dans la main!\r\n     Compagnon, le grand soleil rouge\r\n       Brillera, brillera demain_,”—\r\n\r\nand the poignant, threatening _Chanson de Misère_:—\r\n\r\n   LA CHANSON DE MISÈRE\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n   _J’ai chanté l’amour à vingt ans,\r\n    Et j’ai perdu l’une après l’une,\r\n    Blonde ou brune, au clair de la lune,\r\n    Mes illusions et mon temps.\r\n    Mon cœur oubliait la Misère,\r\n       Lire lon laire,\r\n    Pourtant la Misère était là,\r\n       Lire lon la!_\r\n\r\n\r\n    II\r\n\r\n   _C’était un matin de rancœur,\r\n    Que de ma tristesse accrue,\r\n    Je butai du pied, dans la rue,\r\n    Un pavé rouge comme un cœur.\r\n    C’était le cœur de la Misère,\r\n        Lire lon laire,\r\n    Entre deux pavés planté là,\r\n        Lire lon la!_\r\n\r\n\r\n    III\r\n\r\n   _Le pavé, se dressant vers moi:\r\n    “Combien j’ai vu de barricades,\r\n    Combien j’ai reçu d’estocades\r\n    De par la lettre de la loi!”\r\n    Passant, prends garde à la Misère,\r\n        Lire lon laire.\r\n    Son cœur n’est pas mort.

His most\r\nwidely known _chanson_, _A St. Lazare_, is one of the poems of a\r\ngeneration; and his _A Biribi_[104] has probably done more to rouse the\r\ncommon people against the army than all the anti-militarist meetings of\r\nthe socialists and anarchists combined. But propriety, alas! forbids\r\ntheir presence—and the presence of most of the best of Bruant’s work in\r\nthis volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAQUERAUX]\r\n\r\nThe monologues of Jehan Rictus (_Soliloques du Pauvre_, _Doléances_, and\r\n_Cantilènes du Malheur_) are conspicuous among the poems of poverty for\r\ntheir absolute and abject despair. Jehan Rictus is a man who has done\r\nmany kinds of hard manual labour, if report speaks true, and who knows\r\nthe wretchedness of extreme penury by long and cruel experience. “A\r\nstrange and highly typical figure; a pale, emaciated head we seem to\r\nhave seen somewhere before. Where?—in church paintings, perhaps; sad,\r\nlean, narrow-chested, tall, ‘long as a tear,’ and an expression so\r\nweary! He does not essay a gesture. He has only his voice, the anguish\r\nof his face, and the feverish gleam of his eyes with which to move us.\r\nHis hands, held always behind him, twitch ineffectually as if trying to\r\nburst invisible bonds.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n   Voilà comment en verité\r\n   Les pieds des Pauvres sont traités\r\n\r\n   Quand il saura ce traitement\r\n   Jésus Christ sera mécontent\r\n\r\n   ‘Et moi je vous le dis mes freres\r\n   Prenez bien garde à sa colère.\r\n\r\n   Jehan Rictus.]\r\n\r\nIn portraying the physical discomforts of poverty, the racking coughs,\r\nraging thirsts, aching bones, the nights without shelter or sleep, the\r\ndays without food, the tears that scald and the tearlessness that\r\ndeadens, Jehan Rictus has only done what has been done a score of times\r\nin prose and verse. Surely, an empty heart keeps close company, more\r\noften than not, with an empty stomach, and it is in portraying vividly\r\nthe mental and spiritual aspects of poverty that his work is fresh and\r\nunique. The humiliation of poverty’s uniform,—unkempt hair, missing\r\nshirt, drafty shoes, outlandish and threadbare garments,—of the\r\npavement bed, of the paroxysms of hunger attributed to intoxication, of\r\nthe unsuccessful search for work, of debarment from places of public\r\nresort, of silent submission to insult and gibe; the disgust with filth,\r\nvermin, vulgar noise, endless monotony, enforced celibacy, patronising\r\npity, petty deceits improvised to hide destitution, and hilarity\r\nimprovised to keep back tears; the hatred of those who practise\r\ninjustice and hypocrisy; the scorn of those who bestow and those who\r\naccept charity; the incipient madness of starvation, at once impelling\r\nto a shedding of the blood of the guilty and raising a horrid dread of\r\nconfounding the innocent with the guilty; the regret for loss of\r\nrespectability, courage, ambition, energy, talent, faith; the oppressive\r\nlonesomeness; the yearning for fresh distractions, innocent joys,\r\ncleanly living, for kindly words, sympathetic hand-clasps, kisses,\r\ncaresses, companionship, friendship, love, precious responsibility; the\r\nstolid indifference to death,—all these, the underlying sentiments of\r\npoverty, have never before been given in poetry, at least not without\r\nthe blight of palpable literary effort or factitious emotionalism.\r\n\r\nEqually unique and equally powerful with the exhibition of the multiform\r\nwoes of the destitute is the poet’s satirical exposure of the\r\ninconsistencies, insincerities, vanities, and refined cruelties of the\r\nvarious sorts of people who exploit the destitute. With an ironical\r\npretence of rendering deserved homage to poverty, he elaborates the\r\nimportant part it plays in the social scheme. Thanks to it, the\r\nemployees of the _Assistance Publique_ are able to maintain their\r\nfamilies in comfort; magistrates to attain a rotund and tranquil old\r\nage; economists (deferring to it as a dignified entity) to win\r\nprofessional chairs and academic honours; politicians to get the public\r\near; socialistic and anarchistic bawlers to finish out their careers as\r\ndawdling, alcoholic deputies; poets, painters, and novelists to swim in\r\nglory and good wine, and found luxurious establishments for their\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of winter, which clots the blood of one class, stimulates\r\nthe circulation of all the others. Then reputable benevolence drums a\r\nréveille on hollow stomachs; burial companies wax radiantly bustling;\r\nsalons, languishing for want of something to talk about, revive\r\npromptly; the tourist in the Midi and the bourgeois, smug and snug by\r\nhis fireside, daily commiserate suffering—after dinner—in a manner\r\nboth magnificent and ample; society gambols at charity fêtes and balls;\r\nthe press “rediscovers distress”; journalists sob, weep, and implore—at\r\nthree sous a line. In a word, pitying the unfortunate is a profession\r\nlike another; and, if the day should ever arrive when there were no more\r\npoor in the world, “many people”—to render idiom for idiom—“would be\r\nbadly in the soup.” Such satire stings and routs by virtue of the moral\r\nforce behind it: it is the whip of small cords plied by the man with a\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nSatire broadens to rollicking humour in depicting the abject terror of a\r\nconscience-stricken bourgeois shopkeeper before the embarrassing spectre\r\nof a hungry man:—\r\n\r\n   “_Avez-vous vu ce misérable?\r\n     Cet individu équivoque?\r\n     Ce pouilleux, ce voleur en loques,\r\n     Qui nous r’gardait manger à table?\r\n     Ma parole! on n’est pus (plus) chez soi,\r\n     On ne peut pus digérer tranquille—\r\n     Nous payons l’impôt, gn’a (il y en a) des lois!\r\n     Qu’est-ce qu’y (ils) font donc, les sergents d’ ville?_”\r\n\r\nI laughed almost to tears when I came upon this picture, because I knew\r\nthat same bourgeois shopkeeper—in Boston—during the historic famine\r\nwinter of 1893-94, when a great press formed a syndicate for the\r\ndissemination of lies, when the authority of a great state was appealed\r\nto, and a great governor received congratulatory despatches from the\r\nconfines of a great country for prompt and decisive action in a great\r\nemergency, and all because a few half-starved devils took a notion to\r\nshow themselves without washing their hands and faces or changing their\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nBut to return to France. Jehan Rictus loves the white apparitions of the\r\n“first communicants,” loves sunshine, lilacs, and watercress, birds and\r\nlittle children. Mrs. Browning’s memorable “Cry of the Children” is\r\nfeeble and conventional by the side of his “_Farandole des Pauv’s ‘tits\r\nFan-Fans_.” Charles Lamb was not sweeter, tenderer, daintier, in his\r\ntear-compelling reverie, “Dream Children,” than Rictus in dealing with\r\nhis dream loves,—his “cemetery of innocents” he calls them, his “poor\r\nlittle heap of dead.”\r\n\r\n   “_Et la vie les a massacrés,\r\n     Mes mains les ont ensevelis,\r\n     Mes yeux les ont beaucoup pleurés._”\r\n\r\nHis “_Espoir_,” in which he dreams of a sweetheart, is a veritable\r\nEugène Carrière in verse.\r\n\r\nAnother poem containing much of the same sad, tender beauty, strangely\r\ncommingled with piquant malice, mischievous _esprit_, broad humour, and\r\nbitter satire; a poem which, in spite of startling liberties of\r\nvocabulary, rhythm, and rhyme, is said to have brought honest tears to\r\nthe eyes of the impeccable De Hérédia, is “_Le Revenant_.” The\r\n“_Revenant_” is Jesus Christ. The appearance of Christ in\r\nnineteenth-century Paris is a much-worn _motif_ in French literature and\r\npainting; but the slum poet’s handling of it is so new, bold, and strong\r\nthat it seems to be altogether fresh.\r\n\r\n“_Le Revenant_” is in three parts.\r\n\r\nPart I. is a query as to what would happen if Jesus Christ should come\r\nback, and introduces a summary of the principal events of his career and\r\na strikingly original appreciation of his personality and character. He\r\nis the “man of the beautiful eyes and the beautiful dreams, whose heart\r\nwas larger than life.” But he is also “the anarchist,” the “Galilean\r\ntramp,” the “carpenter on a strike,” the “boon companion of thieves,”\r\nthe “quack hated by the doctors,” the “duffer who wore another cross\r\nthan that of the Legion of Honour, who boxed the bourgeois shop-keepers,\r\nand who wasn’t over-polite to the muffs of his time,”—phrases through\r\nwhose vulgar, uncouth, seemingly sacrilegious envelope are plainly\r\nvisible intense love and admiration, and which accurately represent the\r\nreligious attitude of the submerged, who, proverbially, applaud the name\r\nof Christ while they hiss the barest mention of his professed followers\r\nand his church.\r\n\r\nIn Part II. Jesus Christ suddenly appears on a corner of one of the\r\nexterior boulevards. The surprised poet greets him with bluff\r\ngood-nature, laments drolly his inability to do the proper thing by him\r\nin the matter of drinks, and overwhelms him with eager, naïve questions.\r\nThen, touched to the heart by his dazed look and apparent helplessness,\r\nhe assumes a kindly superiority, taking him under his protection, as he\r\nmight a lost infant, warning him against many things, especially against\r\nthe police, who will be certain to arrest him as a vagabond if he falls\r\nwithin their view. Finally, he discovers that the figure he has taken to\r\nbe that of the Christ is his own figure mirrored in the window of the\r\nwine-shop before which he has been standing.\r\n\r\nPart III. is the after-thought, what the poet would most wish to have\r\nsaid to Jesus Christ if he really had returned and he had been the first\r\nto greet him. Necessarily a repetition at many points of Parts I. and\r\nII., its excuse is the following declaration of faith:—\r\n\r\n   “_Chacun a la Beauté en lui,\r\n     Chacun a la Justice en lui,\r\n     Chacun a la Force en lui-même.\r\n     L’Homme est tout seul dans l’Univers.\r\n     Oh! oui, ben seul, et c’est sa gloire,\r\n     Car y n’a qu’ deux yeux pour tout voir._\r\n\r\n   “_Le Ciel, la Terre, et les Etoiles\r\n     Sont prisonniers d’ ses cils en pleurs.\r\n     Y’ n’ peut donc compter qu’ sur lui-même,\r\n     J’ m’en vas m’ remuer qu’ chacun m’imite,\r\n     C’est là qu’est la clef du Problème.\r\n     L’Homme doit êt’ son Maître et son Dieu._”\r\n\r\nand the following threat:—\r\n\r\n   “_Donnez-nous tous les jours l’ brich’ ton (pain) régulier,\r\n     Autrement nous tâch’rons d’ le prendre._”\r\n\r\nIt was probably this downright and direct threat that led Jules\r\nClaretie, writing for _Le Temps_, to say: “The poetry of the lean Jehan\r\nRictus is the Fronde of to-day. Far better that it mutter in the cabaret\r\nthan in the street.” The majority of the press critics, ignoring this\r\nsingle unequivocal threat and numerous indirect but slightly veiled\r\nanathemas, have pronounced his work “gentle and refined.” Both\r\ninterpretations are, in a measure, right.\r\n\r\nDesiring revolt with his whole soul, and sure of the righteousness of\r\nit, he is likewise so sure of its entire uselessness that he deprecates\r\nit far oftener than he proclaims it. A better state of things, in even\r\nthe most distant future, is to him but a dubious “perhaps.” From kings,\r\npresidents, councils, parliaments, nobles, bourgeois, popes, priests,\r\neconomists, reformers, and philanthropists he expects nothing. From his\r\nown down-trodden class he expects no more. They are stupid cattle,\r\nwaiting patiently to be bled. Enfeebled by hardship, cowed into\r\nspiritlessness by police and magistrates, ready to share with the dogs\r\nthe crumbs that drop from rich men’s tables, to cringe and fawn before\r\nthe faintest prospect of a bone; ready to sell themselves outright for\r\ntwo bars of music, three sous of absinthe, or a couple of rounds of\r\ntobacco; blinded by the dazzling fiction of universal suffrage: they are\r\nonly fit, at the moment a Bastille ought to be taken, to take the\r\ntram-car of that name, and generally show more signs of reverting to the\r\ntype of the ourang-outang than of ushering in that era of universal\r\naffection, when all men will be as brothers, and all nations of one\r\nspeech and one mind.\r\n\r\nHis prayers are despairing cries to a half-credited God,—a God at best\r\nso old, deaf, blind, unconcerned, and far away that his interference is\r\nnot much to be counted on.\r\n\r\nHe conjures Jesus Christ into the world only to chaff him for his faith\r\nin man, to characterise his teachings as the beautiful soliloquies of an\r\nunfortunate, and, finally, to warn him to make good his escape, if he\r\nwould keep out of the clutches of nineteenth-century Judas Iscariots and\r\nPontius Pilates.\r\n\r\nThe prophets and teachers who have tried radically to better the world\r\nhave always been treated as criminals, and always will be. It is vain to\r\nstruggle to make things over. Man is a muff by nature, and nature will\r\nnever change. The kilogramme of iron falsely called a heart will never\r\nbe anything more than a kilogramme of iron. The bank of love “assigned”\r\ncenturies ago. Modern civilisation is organised distress. These are his\r\nsober and reasoned conclusions.\r\n\r\nBut ever and anon, when pain grows too great to be borne, the blind\r\ninstinct of self-preservation overtops reason. Then he swears to be his\r\n“own good God all alone,” taking “his own skin for a banner, since that\r\nis the only thing he has in the world.” Even so his words are less the\r\nrallying cry of a reformer who believes in success than the desperate\r\ndefiance of a Prometheus chained to a rock; and recoil is speedy to his\r\nhabitual sentiment reiterated so often as to be a veritable refrain,\r\n“It’s only life, after all: there’s nothing to do but to weep.”\r\n\r\n“Jehan Rictus,” said a writer in the _Gil Blas_, “has definitely fixed a\r\nnew poetic sob in the cacophony of eternal human suffering.” Needless to\r\nadd, a sob was not his choice. Fate chose for him. His is no case of\r\n“wilful sadness in literature.” Sweet, tender, affectionate by nature,\r\nenamoured of sunlight, he might, under happier conditions, have given a\r\nsmile, a cheer, a pæan even, to the world. In giving a sob, he gave what\r\nlife gave him,—his all.\r\n\r\nHe is the perfect nihilist, who fails to be the perfect anarchist only\r\nbecause he has no faith. His Paris underworld is an Inferno. “All hope\r\nabandon ye who enter here,” is the burden of his message from the\r\nsubmerged; and it is this, probably, that led Laurent Tailhade to call\r\nhim “the Dante of _la misère_.”\r\n\r\nJehan Rictus is at present preaching his gospel of blended defiance and\r\ndespair in prose, in a journal called _L’Ennemi du Peuple_. His\r\njournalism, however, rises very little above the commonplace. He is\r\ngrowing fat and fashionable, and it is to be feared that his days of\r\nsignificant poetical productiveness are over.\r\n\r\nMontmartre participated actively in the revolution of 1830, and was the\r\nseat of the _Club de la Montagne_ in that of 1848. Of the period\r\nimmediately preceding the Commune one of its old residents writes:\r\n“There, insurrection held its drums and its guns always ready. The right\r\nto live free was the most precious of all things to the hearts of all.”\r\nIt seems to have been the order to seize the cannons which the _Gardes\r\nNationaux_ had transported to Montmartre after the capitulation of Paris\r\nthat precipitated the Commune; and it was at Montmartre that the\r\ngenerals Lecomte and Clément Thomas were executed.\r\n\r\nLouise Michel—and who should know better?—in her fascinating\r\n_Mémoires_ testifies to the revolutionary prestige of Montmartre. She\r\nsays, referring to the siege of Paris:—\r\n\r\n   “The Eighteenth Arrondissement was the terror of the selfish,\r\n   plundering jobbers, and others of their breed. When it was\r\n   rumoured, ‘Montmartre is coming down’ (‘_Montmartre va\r\n   descendre_’), the reactionaries scampered to their holes like\r\n   hunted animals, deserting in their panic the secret\r\n   storehouses in which provisions were rotting while Paris was\r\n   starving to death.”\r\n\r\nAgain, apropos of her discharge from custody in the early part of the\r\ninsurrection, she writes:—\r\n\r\n   “The four _citoyens_, Th. Ferré, Avronsart, Burlot, and\r\n   Christ, came to demand my release in the name of the\r\n   Eighteenth Arrondissement. At the first word of this\r\n   phrase,—terror of the reaction,—‘Montmartre is coming down,’ I\r\n   was given into their hands.”\r\n\r\nStill again, in a letter to Rochefort and Pain, on her return from\r\nexile:—\r\n\r\n   “I am writing to Joffrin at the same time as to you on the\r\n   subject of the meeting of Montmartre, before which I cannot go\r\n   to any other. It was at Montmartre I marched formerly: it is\r\n   with Montmartre I march to-day.”\r\n\r\nIt was to the Montmartre of the _indigènes_, the Montmartre of the\r\nworkingmen, the Montmartre then regarded as a twin of Belleville, which\r\nwas known as le _cratère de la révolution_, that Louise Michel paid\r\nthese tributes of affection and esteem. The invasion of the hordes of\r\narts and letters, who hold the _Vache Enragée_ above the Golden Calf,\r\nfar from weakening the revolutionary fervour of the Butte, has\r\nstrengthened it. Montmartre is none the less a hot-bed of revolution for\r\nhaving become a shrine of the Muses. On the contrary, its present\r\nrevolutionary spirit is the spirit of the old Montmartre and of the new\r\nBohemia fused into one; and it makes the “selfish, plundering jobbers,\r\nand others of their breed,” quake more than ever.\r\n\r\nAt every cloud on the municipal horizon no bigger than a man’s hand, at\r\nevery suggestion of disturbance in the political atmosphere, at every\r\nslightest rumble presaging the rising of the masses, the classes peer\r\nnervously and timorously in the direction of the beetling Montmartre,\r\nregretting from the bottom of their hearts that the offer Rothschild is\r\nsaid to have once made, to raze the Butte at his own expense, was not\r\naccepted by the government.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the aboriginal workingmen and the artistic and\r\nliterary colonists of Montmartre are of the most cordial sort. There is\r\na genuine solidarity between them (wherein is a profound lesson for the\r\nsocial settler), because they have common sufferings, common hatreds,\r\ncommon apprehensions, and common hopes; because they faint from the same\r\nhunger, shiver from the same frost, dread the same rent-bills, are\r\nliable to the same evictions and the same police _rafles_, and are under\r\nthe same temptation, when houseless, to commit a petty misdemeanour in\r\norder to get stowed away for the night.\r\n\r\nArtists may help the poor working people about them—without that effort\r\nof will, that compulsion of duty, which inevitably involves patronage,\r\nand which is the bane of all the attempts of the well-to-do to “elevate”\r\nthe poor—because, poor themselves, they often accept help from them in\r\nreturn and _in kind_, and because they are neither mysteries nor objects\r\nof envy to any.\r\n\r\nNowhere in Paris, certainly, is the identity of interests and sentiments\r\nof the simple proletariat and the _prolétariat littéraire_ so\r\ngraphically presented and the much-prated alliance between brain and\r\nbrawn, labour and intellect, so completely realised. Nowhere this side\r\nof heaven, probably, is social democracy so real and so devoid of pose.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that these poor devils of painters and poets,\r\nardent-eyed and beauty-loving, are inwardly submissive because they rail\r\noutwardly at their misfortunes; that they pardon either the individuals\r\nwho victimise them or the society which allows individuals to victimise\r\nthem. Revolt is none the less revolt for perpetrating and relishing a\r\njoke.\r\n\r\nThe note of social revolt in the cavalcade of the _Vache Enragée_ and in\r\nthe mock ceremony of the marriage of the _Rosière_; in the more than\r\nunconventional daily life, with its contemptuous disregard of ordinances\r\nof state and sacraments of church; in the political and social satire\r\nof the _chansonniers_, who sing indifferently in the _soirées_ of the\r\nsocialist and anarchist groups and in the _cabarets artistiques et\r\nlittéraires_; and in the coarse derision of the bawlers of the _cabarets\r\nbrutaux_,—is not to be ignored on the ground that it bears a semblance\r\nof mirth. The child’s play theory is absolutely untenable in this\r\nconnection. These jolly Bohemian dogs of Montmartre are capable of\r\ncorroding rancours and terrible wrath. And, if that descent from\r\nMontmartre which the conscience-stricken bourgeois feel in their bones\r\nwill come, ever does come, it will not be the simple proletariat that\r\nwill inaugurate and lead it, but the rollicking _prolétariat\r\nlittéraire_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LES CORBEAUX]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT IN PROSE LITERATURE & THE DRAMA\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_I have intended to rehabilitate the pariah, whatever form it\r\n   may take; whether it be a buffoon, like Triboulet, a\r\n   courtesan, like Marion Delorme, a poisoner, like Lucrezia\r\n   Borgia, the oppressed, like the people. Those who say that I\r\n   have practised art for art’s sake say a silly thing. No one,\r\n   more than I, has practised art for society and humanity. I\r\n   have always worked for this end, and have known what I wished\r\n   to do_.”—VICTOR HUGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_We know what it cost the First Empire to have displeased\r\n   Châteaubriand, what it cost Louis Philippe to have offended\r\n   Lamartine, Napoleon III. to have vexed Victor Hugo_.”—GASTON\r\n   DESCHAMPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_The aptitude for commerce is an inferior aptitude. There are\r\n   multitudes of banks in which fortunes are perpetuated. Is\r\n   there an unbroken line of Hugos, of Ampères, of Courbets,\r\n   which progresses incessantly from father to son? Commerce is\r\n   an absurd criterion of merit, base in itself and still more\r\n   degrading when it is regulated by laws like ours._”\r\n\r\n   Hélier, in ROSNY’S Le Bilatéral.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_This morning I received the visit of the police commissary,\r\n   my neighbour, accompanied by four alcoholics. They turned\r\n   everything topsy-turvy in my rooms, mixed up my\r\n   correspondence, rumpled my collection of prints, and all to\r\n   seize, at the end, a wood-cut of Maurin and the works of\r\n   Tolstoy._”\r\n\r\n   Meyrargues, in VICTOR BARRUCAND’S Avec le Feu.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_I believe it is impossible to-day for a great mind not to be\r\n   somewhat anarchistic._”—AUGUSTIN FILON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “_My own art is a negation of society, an affirmation of the\r\n   individual outside of all rules and of all social\r\n   necessities_.”—EMILE ZOLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the verdict of posterity regarding the literary and\r\nphilosophical activity of this restless, problematic period, the verdict\r\nof the contemporary world seems to be that Tolstoy, Ibsen, and Zola are\r\nthe three biggest literary philosophers (or philosophical littérateurs)\r\nof their day and generation; and it is a noteworthy fact, to put it\r\nmildly, that the attitude towards society of each one of these three\r\nintellectual giants is, more or less openly, revolutionary. All three\r\nmay be claimed by the parties of revolt without any considerable forcing\r\nof the note.\r\n\r\nTolstoy, by reason of his adoration of Jesus, his insistence on a\r\nliteral interpretation of Jesus’ teachings, his advocacy of\r\nnon-resistance as the most effective form of resistance, and his\r\nattempts to incorporate liberty in education and, by education, in life,\r\nseems to fall naturally enough into the category of the “Christian\r\nanarchist.” But, whether Tolstoy be a “Christian anarchist” or a\r\n“Christian socialist,” as certain Christian socialists rather\r\npresumptuously claim, is immaterial. He is opposed to the established\r\norder, and belongs indisputably with the revolutionists.\r\n\r\nIbsen is a fearless, implacable, self-confessed destroyer of dogma and\r\ntradition, whom the anarchists may claim without doing violence either\r\nto themselves or to him.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Zola towards society and the social problem is not so\r\neasy to define.\r\n\r\nZola exposed with a frankness bordering on brutality the rottenness of\r\nthe wealthy and privileged classes, the oppressions and cruelty of\r\ncapital, the selfishness and hypocrisy of ministers, magistrates, army\r\nofficers, and priests; pictured with a friendliness bordering on\r\nadvocacy the sufferings and struggles of the labourers, and stated with\r\nperfect fairness the most revolutionary ideas and ideals. That he had\r\nin him little enough of the stuff of which real martyrs are made—in\r\nspite of his constitutional inability to “shut himself up in his works,\r\nand act only through them,” as he a hundred times announced his\r\nintention of doing—was shown clearly enough by his ignominious flight\r\nwhen things turned against him in the Dreyfus affair. Nevertheless, no\r\nnovelist of his time—at least none in France—has portrayed so\r\nmasterfully, so sympathetically, one might almost say so devoutly, the\r\ncharacter of the extreme, the martyr type of anarchist, the\r\n_propagandiste par le fait_.\r\n\r\nZola is said to have boasted of the progress anarchistic violence made\r\nafter he “launched his Souvarine into the world.” The charge is probably\r\na libel; but from this cold, calculating, consecrated Souvarine of\r\n_Germinal_ to the generous, sentimental Salvat of Paris the sincere\r\n_propagandiste par le fait_ was explained, excused, admired, extolled by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThis is not saying that Zola was consciously (or unconsciously) an\r\nadvocate of the _propagande par le fait_. He extended an equal\r\ncordiality to all the reformers and innovators who are groping towards a\r\nnew and better world. The evils of contemporary society are so gigantic,\r\nin his view, and the necessity for a change of some sort so imperative,\r\nthat he could understand and condone any and every honest protest, no\r\nmatter how imprudent and no matter how fruitless.\r\n\r\nBesides, Zola was more of an observer than a philosopher, and more of a\r\npoet than either. His later works, and _Germinal_ at least among his\r\nearlier ones, are primarily prose epics. He loved the dynamiter for his\r\nepic value as Milton loved his magnificent Satan, and may have had no\r\nmore intention of holding him up to men as an exemplar than Milton had\r\nof instituting devil-worship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Emile Zola]\r\n\r\nIt is not normal for the poet to have a coherent system, and it is\r\nextremely doubtful if Zola had one. Still, the poet must have, like\r\nother mortals, his personal point of view; and Zola’s personal point of\r\nview (which is not for a moment to be confounded with his point of\r\nview as a poet) seems to have been that of the scientists of his\r\nnovels,—anarchistic as to end, but evolutionary as to means: the\r\nattitude of Guillaume Froment in _Paris_, who saw in “unities creating\r\nworlds, atoms producing life by attraction, by free and ardent love, the\r\nonly scientific theory of society,” and who “dreamed of the emancipated\r\nindividual evolving, expanding without any restraint whatsoever, for his\r\nown good and for the good of all.” The attitude of Bertheroy (_Paris_),\r\n“who worked, in the seclusion of his laboratory, for the ruin of the\r\npresent superannuated and abominable régime, with its God, its dogmas,\r\nits laws, but who desired also repose, too disdainful of useless acts to\r\njoin in the tumults of the street, preferring to live tranquil, rich,\r\nrecompensed, in peace with the government (whatever it might be), all in\r\nforeseeing and preparing the formidable issue of to-morrow,”—the\r\nBertheroy who says: “I have only contempt for the vain agitations of\r\npolitics, revolutionary or conservative. Does not science suffice? Of\r\nwhat use is it to wish to hurry things when a single step of science\r\ndoes more to advance humanity towards the city of justice and truth than\r\na hundred years of politics and social revolt? Science alone is\r\nrevolutionary: it alone can make not only truth, but justice prevail, if\r\njustice is ever possible here below. Of a certainty, it alone brushes\r\naway dogmas, expels the gods, creates light and happiness. It is I,\r\nmember of the Institute, rich and decorated, who am the only\r\nrevolutionist.” The attitude of Jordan (_Travail_), “a completely\r\nemancipated spirit, a tranquil and terrible evolutionist, sure that his\r\nlabour will ravage and renew the world.... According to Jordan, it is\r\nscience solely that leads humanity to truth, to justice, to final\r\nhappiness, to the perfect city of the future towards which the peoples\r\nare so slowly and painfully advancing.”\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it would not be unfair, perhaps, to address to\r\nZola himself the words which he made this Jordan speak to the reforming\r\nhero of _Travail_, Luc Froment: “Only, my noble friend, you are nothing\r\nmore nor less than an anarchist, complete evolutionist as you believe\r\nyourself; and you have every reason to say that, while it is with the\r\nformula of Fourier that we must begin, it is by _l’homme libre dans la\r\ncommune libre_ that we must end.” And, if Zola had been thus addressed,\r\nit is not unlikely that he would have replied laughingly, as he made his\r\nLuc reply, “At any rate, let’s begin; and we shall see in due time\r\nwhither logic leads us.”\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt possible regarding Zola’s belief in a good time\r\ncoming. His later books were fairly saturated with a sublime faith\r\nalmost childlike. There is also no doubt that he believed that science\r\nconsecrated to the service of humanity is quite capable of regenerating\r\nthe world, as he indicated by the communistic experiment of Luc in\r\n_Travail_. But whether he believed that science _will_ be consecrated to\r\nthe service of humanity or whether he was presenting a method which\r\nmight be employed, and which he simply hoped, almost against hope, would\r\nbe so employed, is not so clear. Thus, in the last chapter of _Travail_,\r\nafter giving a beautiful picture of the superb results of the peaceable\r\nrevolution accomplished through the altruistic initiative of Luc in the\r\ncommune of Beauclair, he added a sort of apocalyptic vision of the\r\nhappenings in the principal divisions of the big world outside, in which\r\nthe same superb results have been secured by violence,—by a bloody,\r\nsocialistic _coup d’état_, by the multiplication of anarchistic bombs,\r\nby a universal war,—quite as if he would say to the classes in power:\r\n“I have shown you how society may be renewed. I have shown you the way\r\nof your salvation, the only way. If you would but walk in this way, you\r\nmight save yourselves and the world with you. But you will not. You are\r\ntoo stupid, too selfish, too obstinate, too corrupt. You will not. I\r\nhave known you only too long, and I know you will not. Well, then, so\r\nmuch the worse for you! Expropriation, massacre, annihilation, await\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\nIf you ask intellectual Frenchmen, without distinction of social\r\nposition or political faith, who is the foremost living French man of\r\nletters, five out of six will answer, without an instant’s hesitation,\r\nAnatole France. Less pictorial, less colossal, and less epic than Zola,\r\nbut more penetrating and more profound; æsthetic and erudite (in the\r\ngood old-fashioned sense of the latter word), subtile, suave, and\r\nrefined; abundantly endowed with the humour and the wit in which Zola\r\nwas deficient; as impeccable in point of language and style as Zola was\r\ncareless, as measured as Zola was violent, as gentle as Zola was brutal,\r\nas finished as Zola was crude; as perfect an embodiment of the Greek\r\nspirit as Zola, if he had only had a keener sense of the grotesque,\r\nwould have been of the Gothic,—Anatole France is none the less a\r\nredoubtable iconoclast,—the most redoubtable iconoclast of his\r\ngeneration, perhaps. A playful pessimist, a piquant anarchist, a\r\nmischievous nihilist, if you will, but a pessimist, an anarchist, a\r\nnihilist, for all that. “Prejudices,” he says, “are unmade and remade\r\nwithout ceasing: they have the eternal mobility of the clouds. It is in\r\ntheir nature to be august before appearing to be odious; and the men are\r\nrare who have not the superstition of their time, and who look straight\r\nin the eye what the crowd does not dare to look at.” M. France is one of\r\nthese rare men. He combines the amiable doubt of Montaigne with the\r\nmocking irreverence of Voltaire and the subversive grace of Renan. “The\r\nend which M. France seems to pursue persistently,” says one of his\r\nliterary brethren, “is the demolition of the social edifice by the force\r\nof a logic tinctured with irony, without anger, and without phrases. By\r\nas much as Zola, Tailhade, and Mirbeau are ardent and passionate when\r\nthey attack society, by so much is M. France calm and feline; but he is\r\nnot, on that account, the less to be feared.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANATOLE FRANCE]\r\n\r\nAs the most eminent living representative of the best classic\r\ntraditions of French prose, M. France is the idol of the lettered youth\r\nof France. From admiration of form to acceptance of the substance\r\nunderlying the form is but a step. His ideas insinuate themselves\r\nconsequently into the very penetralia of culture,—that exquisite\r\nculture which brooks the presence of nothing common or unclean,—and\r\nthey act as a disintegrating force in circles where downright\r\nrevolutionary propaganda cannot enter.\r\n\r\nIn his writings, Anatole France is the precise intellectual\r\ncounterpart—at every point but that of Catholicism, and even here his\r\npassion for Augustine, Chrysostom, and the other Church Fathers deters\r\nhim from displaying an uncomely asperity—of his own adorable creation,\r\nl’Abbé Coignard,[105] the “delicious Catholic _révolté_, who juggles\r\nwith principles and human institutions as if they were a Merry Andrew’s\r\npainted spheres; the railing anarchist who lashes with jests and whose\r\nonly bombs are _bons mots_.” And the best characterisation it is\r\npossible to give of M. France, the genial iconoclast, is to repeat\r\ncertain of his observations on the character of his Abbé and certain of\r\nthe sayings he puts into his Abbé’s mouth,—which I accordingly do in\r\nthe following detached paragraphs, making no pretence of preserving in\r\nthe translation the peculiar savour and charm of the original:—\r\n\r\n\r\n   OF THE CHARACTER OF JERÔME COIGNARD.\r\n\r\n   “His free intelligence trampled under foot vulgar beliefs and\r\n   never accepted without examination the common opinion, except\r\n   in what had to do with the Catholic faith in which he was\r\n   immovable.\r\n\r\n   “The sagest of moralists, a sort of marvellous blend of\r\n   Epicurus and Saint Francis of Assisi.... He preserved, in his\r\n   boldest explorations, the attitude of a peaceful\r\n   promenader.... It is certain that the world, to his eyes,\r\n   resembled less the deserts of the Thébaïde than the gardens of\r\n   Epicurus. He sauntered therein with the audacious\r\n   ingenuousness which is the essential trait of his character\r\n   and the elemental principle of his teaching.”\r\n\r\n   “Never did spirit show itself at once so daring and so\r\n   pacific, nor temper its disdain with more sweetness.... He\r\n   despised men with tenderness. He endeavoured to teach them\r\n   that, since they have nothing anywhere near great in\r\n   themselves except their capacity for suffering, they can\r\n   cultivate nothing useful or beautiful but compassion.”\r\n\r\n   “It was his benevolence which impelled him to humiliate his\r\n   fellows in their sentiments, their knowledge, their\r\n   philosophy, and their institutions. He had to show them that\r\n   their imbecile natures have neither imagined nor constructed\r\n   anything worth being attacked or defended very energetically,\r\n   and that, if they knew the fragile crudity of their greatest\r\n   works, such as laws and empires, they would fight over them\r\n   only in play, for the sheer fun of the thing, like the\r\n   children who build castles of sand on the rim of the sea.”\r\n\r\n   “The majesty of the laws did not impose on his clairvoyant\r\n   soul; and he deplored the fact that the unfortunate are\r\n   burdened with so many obligations of which, for the most part,\r\n   it is impossible to discover the origin or the sense.”\r\n\r\n   “What he had the least of was the sense of veneration. Nature\r\n   had refused it him, and he did nothing to acquire it. He would\r\n   have feared, in exalting some, to debase others; and his\r\n   universal charity embraced equally the humble and the proud.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   SOME OF JERÔME COIGNARD’S SAYINGS.\r\n\r\n   _Of Society and Governments_:\r\n\r\n   “After the destruction of all the false principles, society\r\n   will subsist, because it is founded upon necessity, the laws\r\n   of which, older than Saturn, will rule when Prometheus shall\r\n   have dethroned Jupiter.”\r\n\r\n   “I conclude that all the laws with which a minister swells his\r\n   portfolio are vain documents that can neither make us live nor\r\n   prevent us from living.”\r\n\r\n   “It is well-nigh a matter of indifference whether we are\r\n   governed in one fashion or another, and ministers are\r\n   imposing only by reason of their clothes and their carriages.”\r\n\r\n   “These assemblies [parliaments] will be founded upon the\r\n   confused mediocrity of the multitude of which they will be the\r\n   issue. They will revolve obscure and multiple thoughts. They\r\n   will impose on the heads of the government the task of\r\n   executing vague wishes, of which they will not have full\r\n   consciousness themselves; and the ministers, less fortunate\r\n   than the Œdipus of the fable, will be devoured, one after the\r\n   other, by the hundred-headed Sphinx, for not having guessed\r\n   the riddle of which the Sphinx herself did not know the\r\n   answer. Their greatest hardship will be to resign themselves\r\n   to impotence, to words instead of action. They will become\r\n   rhetoricians, and very bad rhetoricians, since the talent\r\n   which carried with it ever so little clarity would ruin them.\r\n   They will be obliged to speak without saying anything, and the\r\n   least stupid among them will be condemned to deceive more than\r\n   the others. In this way the most intelligent will become the\r\n   most contemptible. And, if there shall be some capable of\r\n   arranging treaties, regulating finance, and supervising\r\n   affairs, their ability will profit them nothing; for time will\r\n   be lacking, and time is the stuff of great enterprises.”\r\n\r\n   _Of the Army_:\r\n\r\n   “I have observed that the trade the most natural to man is\r\n   that of soldiering; it is the one towards which he is the most\r\n   easily borne by his instincts and by his tastes, which are not\r\n   all good. And apart from certain rare exceptions, of which I\r\n   am one, man may be defined as an animal with a musket. Give\r\n   him a handsome uniform and the hope of going to fight, he will\r\n   be content.... The military condition has this also in keeping\r\n   with human nature, that one is never forced to think therein;\r\n   and it is clear that we were not made to think.”\r\n\r\n   “Thought is a disease peculiar to certain individuals, and\r\n   could not be propagated without bringing about promptly the\r\n   end of the species. Soldiers live in bands, and man is a\r\n   sociable animal. They wear costumes of blue and white, blue\r\n   and red, gray and blue, ribbons, plumes, and cockades; and\r\n   these give them the same prestige with women that the cock has\r\n   with the hen. They go forth marauding and to war; and man is\r\n   naturally thieving, libidinous, destructive, and sensible to\r\n   glory.”\r\n\r\n   “It is astounding, Tournebroche, my son, that war and the\r\n   chase, the mere thought of which ought to overwhelm us with\r\n   shame and remorse in recalling to us the miserable necessities\r\n   of our nature and our inveterate wickedness, should, on the\r\n   contrary, serve as matter for the pride of men; that\r\n   Christians should continue to honour the trade of butcher and\r\n   headsman when it is hereditary in the family; and that, in a\r\n   word, among civilised peoples the illustriousness of the\r\n   citizens is measured by the quantity of murder and carnage\r\n   they carry, so to speak, in their veins.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Pair of Army Officers]\r\n\r\n   _Of the Academy_:\r\n\r\n   “Happy he who has not put his hope in The Academy! Happy he\r\n   who lives exempt from fears and desires, and who knows that it\r\n   is equally vain to be an Academician and not to be an\r\n   Academician! Such a one leads, without trouble, a life hidden\r\n   and obscure. Beautiful liberty follows him everywhere. He\r\n   celebrates in the shade the silent orgies of wisdom, and all\r\n   the Muses smile on him as on their adept.”\r\n\r\n   “The immortality which has just been decreed to M. de Séez\r\n   neither a Bossuet nor a Belzunce desires. It is not graven in\r\n   the hearts of wondering peoples: it is inscribed in a big\r\n   register.”\r\n\r\n   “If there are to be found, among the forty, persons of more\r\n   polish than genius, what harm is there in this? Mediocrity\r\n   triumphs in the Academy. Where does it not triumph? Do you\r\n   find it less powerful in the parliaments and in the councils\r\n   of the crown, where, surely, it is less in its place? Does one\r\n   need to be a rare man to work on a dictionary which pretends\r\n   to control usage and which can only follow it?\r\n\r\n   “The _Académistes_ or _Académiciens_ were instituted, as you\r\n   know, to fix the proper usage in what concerns discourse, to\r\n   purge the language of every venerable and popular impurity,\r\n   and to prevent the appearance of another Rabelais, another\r\n   Montaigne, _tout puant la canaille, la cuistrerie, et la\r\n   province_.”\r\n\r\n   “Genius is something unsociable. An extraordinary man is\r\n   rarely a man of resources. The Academy was very well able to\r\n   do without Descartes and Pascal. Who can say that it could as\r\n   easily have done without M. Godeau or M. Conrart?”\r\n\r\n   _Of Justice, Courts, and Judges_:\r\n\r\n   “I hold man free in his acts because my religion teaches it;\r\n   but, outside the doctrine of the Church (which is\r\n   unequivocal), there is so little reason to believe in human\r\n   liberty that I shudder in thinking of the verdicts of a\r\n   justice that punishes actions of which the motives, the order,\r\n   and the causes equally elude us, in which the will has often\r\n   little part, and which are sometimes accomplished\r\n   unconsciously.”\r\n\r\n   “Tournebroche, my son, consider that I am speaking of human\r\n   justice, which is different from the justice of God, and which\r\n   is generally opposed to it.”\r\n\r\n   “The cruelest insult that men have been able to offer to our\r\n   Lord Jesus Christ has been the placing of his image in the\r\n   halls where the judges absolve the Pharisees who crucified him\r\n   and condemn the Magdalen whom he lifted up with his divine\r\n   hands.”[106]\r\n\r\n   “What has he, the Just, to do with these men who could not\r\n   show themselves just, even if they wished it, since their\r\n   dreary duty is to consider the actions of their fellows not in\r\n   themselves and in their essence, but from the single point of\r\n   view of the interests of society; that is to say, in the\r\n   interests of this mass of egoism, avarice, errors, and abuses\r\n   which constitute communities, and of which they (the judges)\r\n   are the blind conservators.”\r\n\r\n   “Judges do not sound the loins and do not read hearts, and\r\n   their justest justice is crude and superficial.... They are\r\n   men; that is to say, feeble and corruptible, gentle to the\r\n   strong and pitiless to the weak. They consecrate by their\r\n   sentences the cruelest social iniquities; and it is difficult\r\n   to distinguish, in this partiality, what comes from their\r\n   personal baseness and what is imposed on them by the duty of\r\n   their profession, this duty being, in reality, to support the\r\n   State in what it has of evil as well as in what it has of\r\n   good; to watch over the conservation of public morals, whether\r\n   they are excellent or detestable.... Furthermore, it should be\r\n   observed that the magistrate is the defender, by virtue of his\r\n   function, not only of the current prejudices to which we are\r\n   all more or less subject, but also of the time-worn prejudices\r\n   which are conserved in the laws after they have been effaced\r\n   from our souls and our habits. And there is not a spirit ever\r\n   so little meditative and free that does not feel how much\r\n   there is of Gothic in the law, while the judge has not the\r\n   right to feel it.”\r\n\r\n   “By the very nature of their profession, judges are inclined\r\n   to see a culprit in every prisoner; and their zeal seems so\r\n   terrible to certain European peoples that they have them\r\n   assisted, in important cases, by ten citizens chosen by lot.\r\n   From which it appears that chance, in its blindness,\r\n   guarantees the life and liberty of the accused better than the\r\n   enlightenment of the judges can. It is true that these\r\n   impromptu bourgeois magistrates, selected by a lottery, are\r\n   held well outside the affair of which they see only the\r\n   exterior pomp. It is true further that, being ignorant of the\r\n   laws, they are called in, not to apply them, but also simply\r\n   to decide, by a single word, if there is occasion to apply\r\n   them. We are told that assizes of this sort give absurd\r\n   results sometimes, but that the peoples who have established\r\n   them cling to them as to a highly precious protection. I\r\n   easily believe it. And I comprehend the acceptance of verdicts\r\n   rendered in this fashion, which may be inept and cruel, but of\r\n   which the absurdity and barbarity are, so to speak,\r\n   attributable to nobody. Injustice seems tolerable when it is\r\n   sufficiently incoherent to appear involuntary.”\r\n\r\n   “Just now this little bailiff, who has so strong a sentiment\r\n   of justice, suspected me of belonging to the party of thieves\r\n   and assassins. On the contrary, I so far disapprove theft and\r\n   assassination that I cannot endure even the copy of them\r\n   regularised by the laws; and it is painful for me to see that\r\n   judges have found no better means of punishing robbers and\r\n   homicides than by imitating them. For, after all,\r\n   Tournebroche, my son, in good faith, what are fines and the\r\n   death penalty, if not robbery and assassination perpetrated\r\n   with an august exactitude? And do you not see that our justice\r\n   merely tends, in all its pride, to this shame of avenging an\r\n   evil by an evil, a suffering by a suffering, and in doubling\r\n   misdemeanours and crimes in the name of equilibrium and\r\n   symmetry?\r\n\r\n   “Customs have more force than laws. Gentleness of demeanour\r\n   and sweetness of spirit are the only remedies which can\r\n   reasonably be applied to legal barbarity. For to correct laws\r\n   by laws is to take a slow and uncertain route.”\r\n\r\nBut for the historic setting, the turn of the phrase, and the absence of\r\nbitterness, one might fancy himself reading the contemporary anarchist\r\norgans, _Les Temps Nouveaux_ and _Le Libertaire_.\r\n\r\nAnatole France is as chary of Utopias as Zola is prone to them. He fears\r\nnothing so much as intemperance of emotion and speech. He believes in\r\nnothing, not even in his own unbelief. “If ever M. Anatole France,” says\r\nGaston Deschamps, “seeks martyrdom, it will be to confess the doctrine\r\nof the relativity of knowledge, to affirm the nothingness of human\r\nopinions, and to attest, at the price of his blood, that there is no\r\ntruth”; and yet it was apropos of this same M. France that this same M.\r\nDeschamps, in the course of a contention that literature always ends by\r\nhaving its way, sounded the note of warning placed at the beginning of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the dilettante humour or, to be more accurate, the\r\ndilettante philosophy that informs his writings, Anatole France did not\r\nremain within his _tour d’ivoire_ during that strange Dreyfus affair\r\nwhich transformed nearly every literary Frenchman into an agitator—for\r\none side or the other. Like Zola and like most of his fellow-craftsmen\r\nof an anarchistic or socialistic bent, he engaged actively in the\r\nanti-militarist campaign, the pretext of which was the wrongs of a Jew\r\nwhom they believed to be persecuted. In M. France, apostle of the\r\nnothingness of things in general and in particular, such a course was\r\nvery surprising and, it must be admitted, very inconsistent. His most\r\nplausible excuse probably is that he could not help himself, his\r\nchivalrous instincts proving stronger than his quietism. But he might\r\ndefend himself, if he thought it worth while, by citing the reply of\r\nJerôme Coignard to his satellite Tournebroche when the latter inquired\r\nwhy he would “reduce to dust the foundations of equity, of justice, of\r\nlaws, and of all the civil and military magistracies”:—\r\n\r\n   “My son, I have always observed that the troubles of men come\r\n   to them from their prejudices, as spiders and scorpions come\r\n   from the dimness of cellars and from the humidity of vaults.\r\n   It is good to flourish the broom and the brush a little in all\r\n   the dark corners. It is good even to give a little blow of the\r\n   pick here and there in the walls of the cellar and garden to\r\n   frighten the vermin and prepare the necessary ruins.”\r\n\r\nM. France has not yet gone back into the _tour d’ivoire_ from which the\r\nirresistible “Affair” drew him. He is a member of the executive\r\ncommittee of the Co-operative Bakery and a leader in the organisation of\r\nthe _Universités Populaires_; he presided on the occasion of the Victor\r\nHugo Centennial over a gigantic mass meeting of the latter, in which he\r\ngave “a little blow of the pick” to clericalism; and in 1903 he\r\ncontributed an introduction to Premier Combes’ volume _Campagne Laïque_,\r\nin defence of anti-clericalism.\r\n\r\nAt a recent anniversary of Diderot, whom both anarchists and socialists\r\nclaim as an ancestor, but who is more particularly an idol of the\r\nanarchists, he said:—\r\n\r\n   “_Citoyens_, master-spirits who are our friends have come here\r\n   to speak of Diderot, the savant, and Diderot, the philosopher.\r\n   As for me, I have only a word to say. I desire to show you\r\n   Diderot, the friend of the people. This son of the cutler of\r\n   Langres was an excellent man. A contemporary of Voltaire and\r\n   of Rousseau, he was the best of men in the best of centuries.\r\n\r\n   “He loved men and the pacific works of men. He conceived the\r\n   great design of lifting up into esteem the manual trades\r\n   looked down upon by the military, civil, and religious\r\n   aristocracies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCTAVE MIRBEAU]\r\n\r\n   “_Citoyens_, at a time when the united enemies of knowledge,\r\n   of peace, of liberty, arm themselves against the Republic, and\r\n   threaten to stifle democracy under the weight of all that\r\n   which does not think, or thinks only against thought, you have\r\n   had a happy inspiration in singling out for honour the memory\r\n   of this philosopher who teaches men happiness through work,\r\n   knowledge, and love; and who, looking far into the future,\r\n   announced the new era, the coming of the proletariat into a\r\n   pacified and comforted world.\r\n\r\n   “His penetrating view discerned our present struggles and our\r\n   future successes. And it is not too much to say that Diderot,\r\n   whose memory we celebrate to-day, Diderot, dead for one\r\n   hundred and twenty years, touches us very closely; that he is\r\n   ours, a great servitor of the people and a defender of the\r\n   proletariat.”\r\n\r\nAnatole France is the gentlest and subtlest ironist of his time; Octave\r\nMirbeau (to whom M. France’s _Jerôme Coignard_ was dedicated) is the\r\nfiercest. M. Mirbeau has not yet obtained the world renown of Zola nor\r\nthe national renown of M. France, but he may become in time as famous as\r\neither. He surpasses every living French writer in portraying the\r\nmonstrous, the atrocious, and the horrible, and in expressing hatred and\r\ndisgust; and his irony—too often fulminated, in violation of the\r\ncommonest courtesy, not to say decency, against individuals antipathetic\r\nto him—rives and blasts like the thunderbolt. It is doubtful if the\r\nworld has seen anything comparable to him for vitriolic vindictiveness\r\nsince England had Dean Swift. He is bitter, brutal, savage, terrifying\r\nto the last degree; “one of those combative natures,” says Eugène\r\nMontfort, “who are dreaded because their conviction partakes of the\r\nnature of an animate being, ... breathes, feeds, grows, is endowed with\r\nthe instinct of self-preservation and struggles for life.”\r\n\r\nHis _Calvaire_, as he himself puts it, “strips war of all its heroism.”\r\nHis _Journal d’une Femme de Chambre_ is the most complete and awful\r\narraignment of society it is possible to imagine between the covers of a\r\nsingle volume. Merciless towards the hypocrisy and hollowness of the\r\nhour, towards meanness and pretentiousness, towards impotent and\r\nmisdirected philanthropy, above all, towards the stupidity and ugliness\r\nof the smug bourgeois, whom he fairly flays alive as Apollo flayed\r\nMarsyas, M. Mirbeau is, on the other hand,—and here his resemblance to\r\nSwift ceases,—infinitely humane and uplifting, full of tenderness and\r\nchivalry for the outcast and unfortunate, for the goodness which would\r\ndiffuse happiness everywhere; full of generous ardour, high aspiration,\r\nand unfaltering faith in the ultimate triumph of the just.\r\n\r\nM. Mirbeau is a declared anarchist; and, as such, he published a\r\nwonderful Apology of Ravachol, furnished an introduction for Jean\r\nGrave’s most famous volume, and played a leading rôle in the Dreyfus\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nHis _chroniques_ are daring, incisive, brilliant, explosive, virile,\r\ninsulting. They cut, burn, scald, corrode. His short stories are\r\npassionate, dramatic, lyrical even, all in being realistic. His novels,\r\nthough they deal only indirectly with public issues, are upon all the\r\nanarchist library lists.\r\n\r\nEmile Zola, Anatole France, and Octave Mirbeau are held, by many persons\r\nwho do not in the least share their views, to be the three pre-eminent\r\nmasters of modern French fiction. On a distinctly lower plane than these\r\nthree, but still far above mediocrity, are two other novelists of a\r\nrevolutionary cast, Lucien Descaves and Victor Barrucand.\r\n\r\nDescaves demonstrated in his first volume—a collection of short stories\r\nentitled _Le Calvaire d’Héloïse Pajadin_—the depressing and degrading\r\ninfluence of the decent poverty of petty clerks and tradesmen; his _La\r\nColonne_ portrayed the contrasts of the Commune; and his _Soupes_\r\nexposed the hypocrisies, cruelties, and absurdities of professional and\r\namateur charity and philanthropy. But M. Descaves’ specialty is the\r\narmy: it is in his novels of the barracks that he is at his best, and by\r\nthese works he is best known.\r\n\r\nIn these books, with a talent which approaches genius, through hundreds\r\nof pages he holds the reader’s attention to the flat, stale, and\r\nunprofitable barrack life,—to its pettiness, selfishness, monotony,\r\nphysical and moral untidiness, desolation and disgust,—a life entirely\r\nlacking in all that we are accustomed to consider the material for\r\nromance. Under his skilful handling the commonplace and the vulgar\r\nbecome alternately tragic and grimly comic; and his _Sous-Offs_ and\r\n_Emmurés_, to which he owes his nomination as a charter member of the\r\n_Académie Goncourt_, are almost classics of their kind. Less exalted and\r\nless epic than Zola, of whose big, spectacular qualities he is quite\r\ndestitute, Descaves is, nevertheless, much closer to Zola than he is to\r\nMirbeau or to France. And he easily surpasses Zola in the latter’s\r\nmuch-heralded but rather superficial realism; that is, in the capacity\r\nfor heaping up significantly and without boresomeness minute, unromantic\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nDescaves has a square bull-dog head and jaw, if his photographs are to\r\nbe trusted. He certainly has a bull-dog’s fixity of purpose in the\r\nmatter of both substance and form. Nothing in the world will induce him\r\nto relax his grip on his immediate aim to indulge in fine ideas or fine\r\nwriting. His style is cold, hard, dry, correct, keen, and sure. He is an\r\nout-and-out anarchist, who has played a fairly active part in the events\r\nof the last few years. His _Sous-Offs_, though entirely free from\r\ndoctrinal discussion, cost him, by reason of its damaging revelations,\r\nan encounter with the law. No other novel—indeed, no other work of this\r\ngeneration, unless it be Bruant’s _chanson_, _Biribi_—has exerted so\r\nprofound an anti-militarist influence in France.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Victor Barrucand published in the _Revue Blanche_ a series of\r\narticles, concluding with a serious proposition for the establishment of\r\n“_Le Pain Gratuit_” (free bread); and on the occasion of the municipal\r\nelections of that year he placarded the principal communes of France\r\nwith the following appeal:—\r\n\r\n   “TO THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n   “The tactics of the ambitious and the usurpers have always\r\n   been to create division in order to reign.\r\n\r\n   “WORKERS!\r\n\r\n   “Be no more divided over political programmes of which you are\r\n   the dupes.\r\n\r\n    “Band yourselves together upon the basis of your interests.\r\n\r\n   “Let us not expect anything from the good will of anybody, but\r\n   let us define our own wills. Let us not say to any exterior\r\n   power, ‘GIVE US (_Donnez-nous_) OUR DAILY BREAD’; for manna\r\n   will not fall from heaven nor from the governmental spheres.\r\n   But let us say, ‘GIVE OURSELVES’ (_Donnons-nous_)! We can, if\r\n   we will it, affirm with solidarity true LIBERTY FOR ALL.\r\n\r\n   “Let us combine our determination and our scattered energies,\r\n   and let us constitute the great party of men with hearts upon\r\n   this question of bread, proclaiming THE RIGHT TO LIVE (_le\r\n   droit à la vie_) without humiliating conditions.\r\n\r\n   “Let bread, in all the communes, be the property of all, like\r\n   the water of the fountains, the lights of the streets, and the\r\n   streets themselves.\r\n\r\n   “We have free instruction, which profits only those who can\r\n   receive instruction. Let us organise, more justly, LE PAIN\r\n   GRATUIT for the profit and the liberty of all the workers.\r\n\r\n   “Let the bread necessary to life be a right, and not an alms.\r\n   Let it be no more the derisive price with which the labourer,\r\n   nourisher of the rich, is paid. Let us abrogate the law of\r\n   death inscribed on the margin of the code against him who has\r\n   not found a way to sell himself.\r\n\r\n   “THE PEOPLE MUST SPEAK OUT LOUD AND FIRM! THEY MUST DICTATE\r\n   THEIR TERMS!\r\n\r\n   “Let us vote no more for individuals nor for complicated\r\n   programmes. Let us vote for LE PAIN GRATUIT! Let there be no\r\n   political divisions upon this point. Let us be with those who\r\n   are with us, and be on our guard against the false\r\n   philanthropists who promise more butter than bread.\r\n\r\n   “Let us begin at the beginning. Let us lay the corner-stone of\r\n   a social edifice which shall shelter our children FREE AND\r\n   RECONCILED IN THE COMMON HAPPINESS.\r\n\r\n   “Let us silence the ambitious who see in the suffering of the\r\n   people only a means of attaining their ends. Let us replace\r\n   the politics of personalities (so remote from the interests of\r\n   the masses) by a finely human organisation of things. Let us\r\n   vote for the idea which cannot betray us.\r\n\r\n   “LET US VOTE FOR FREE BREAD!\r\n\r\n   “VICTOR BARRUCAND.”[107]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn _Avec le Feu_, a novel whose action is placed in the troubled period\r\nof the execution of Vaillant and the overt act of Emile Henry, M.\r\nBarrucand has given an exceedingly subtle and suggestive study of the\r\ndisgust with society of a certain element of the intellectual _élite_,\r\nand of the reasons for their espousal of the anarchist cause.\r\n\r\nThe principal character, one Robert, is a good type of the cultured,\r\nsemi-neurasthenic anarchist of a period chiefly characterised by its\r\nrestlessness and yearning:—\r\n\r\n   “On certain evenings he descended into the street, and\r\n   saturated himself with the crowd. On the benches he breathed\r\n   the mortality of the squares. He suffered for these miserable\r\n   cattle who bleed no more under the goad of conscience. He\r\n   roamed entire nights as chance led, hunting the débris of\r\n   souls, exploring with his emotions, as with a dark lantern,\r\n   the pavements of the drowsy city. At daybreak he came back\r\n   shivering, coughing, weary with over-walking, drunk with pity,\r\n   his stomach steeped in bad drinks. He concluded then that\r\n   labour had brutalised the species, and he sought the secret of\r\n   lifting it up. On these mornings he speculated daringly,\r\n   dreamed of sacrifices, of revolts, of noble disdains, of\r\n   ferocious protests against philanthropy and respectability. A\r\n   savour of death blended with his charity and perfumed his\r\n   heroic sleep.”\r\n\r\nThe novel ends dramatically, not with bomb-throwing, but with suicide,\r\nwhich this strange anarchist hero, who aspires to bomb-throwing, without\r\nhaving the necessary force of character to achieve it, chooses in its\r\nstead.\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to class M. Barrucand as an anarchist, or even as a\r\nrevolutionist, on the strength of this book, in spite of the generally\r\nsympathetic tone which pervades it. In fact, M. Barrucand’s philosophy\r\nas displayed therein is of so cynical and, at times, of so flippant an\r\norder, his temperament so weary and so buoyant, his moral outlook so\r\nsevere and lackadaisical, his style so lurid and simple, his\r\nappreciations so morbid and sane, and his literary method so\r\nimpressionistic, realistic, and symbolic, by turns, that it would be\r\nrash to draw any conclusions from it whatsoever, did not his attitude in\r\nhis other works—notably in his two historical biographies, _La Vie\r\nVéritable du Citoyen Rossignol_, _Vainqueur de la Bastille_, and\r\n_Mémoires et Notes de Choudieu, Représentant du Peuple_—and his\r\nidentification with the movement for Free Bread enroll him definitively\r\nin the ranks of revolt.\r\n\r\nMaurice Barrès, who is at present an apostle of nationalism, was at one\r\ntime classed as a “sentimental anarchist,”—an anarchist “with a rebel’s\r\nbrain and a voluptuary’s nerves, who would wear purple and fine linen.”\r\n“I am an enemy of the laws,” he said at that time.\r\n\r\nAmong other French novelists and short-story writers of a certain\r\nreputation who are more or less revolutionary in tone may be\r\nmentioned:—\r\n\r\nGeorges Darien, author of _Biribi-Armée d’Afrique_, a novel of the\r\nconvict-legion, which has proved a potent factor in lessening the\r\nrigours of the companies of discipline; Dubois-Dessaulle,[108] author of\r\n_Sous la Casaque_, who, after being released from the convict-legion to\r\nwhich he had been consigned (because a brochure by Jean Grave and an\r\narticle by Sévérine were found in his knapsack), had the superhuman\r\ncourage to soak his left arm in kerosene and set fire to it in order to\r\navoid ever being sent back into this inferno; Jean Ajalbert, author of\r\n_Sous le Sabre_; Marcel Lami, author of _La Débandade_; Louis Lamarque,\r\nauthor of _Un An de Caserne_; Paul Brulat, author of _La Faiseuse de\r\nGloire_, _Le Nouveau Candide_, _La Gangue_, and _Eldorado_, books\r\nreplete with generous indignation against social abuses; Jean Lombard,\r\none of the makers of the programme of the _Congrès Régional_ of Paris\r\n(1880) which declared for class candidates, whose untimely death was a\r\ngreat loss to French literature; Camille Pert, author of _En\r\nl’Anarchie_; Henri Rainaldy, author of _Delcros_, an exposure of the\r\ncowardices and murderousness of society; Adolphe Retté, author of _Le\r\nRégicide_; Marcel Schwob, author of _Spicilege_; Mme. Sévérine, author\r\nof _Pages Rouges_; Frantz Jourdain, author of _L’Atelier Chanterel_;\r\nZéphirin Raganasse, author of _Fabrique de Pions_; Louis Lumet, author\r\nof _La Fièvre_; M. Reepmaker, author of _Vengeance_; Théodore Chèze,\r\nHenri Fèvre, Jules Cazes, Pierre Valdagne, and the _feuilletoniste_\r\nMichel Zevacco.\r\n\r\nA number of the revolutionists who are primarily public agitators\r\nhave made attempts of varying merit to propagate their pet ideas\r\nthrough the medium of fiction. Such are Sébastien Faure with his\r\n_romans-feuilletons_ and Jean Grave with his _Malfaiteurs_, his military\r\nromance, _La Grande Famille_, and his book for boys, _Les Aventures de\r\nNono_.\r\n\r\nThe most thorough single-volume study that has as yet appeared of the\r\npsychology of the different varieties of contemporary revolutionary\r\ntypes, and of their aims and methods, is unquestionably J.-H.\r\nRosny’s[109] romance, _Le Bilatéral_. But M. Rosny, although he has\r\nappeared on a public platform in company with professed _révoltés_, to\r\nprotest against “_La Cruauté Contemporaine_,” is primarily a scientific\r\nobserver, who cannot reasonably be classed as an agitator.\r\n\r\nLike the hero of this romance (Hélier, the “Bilatéral,” who habitually\r\nlooks at all sides of a subject, and then looks at them again), Rosny is\r\nimpassive, impartial, tolerant, eclectic. Far from excusing the crimes\r\nand errors of the capitalistic state, he is equally far from throwing\r\nin his lot with those who would incontinently overturn it.\r\n\r\n   “To think,” says the Bilatéral to his _doctrinaire_ socialist\r\n   and anarchist friends, “that there are multitudes of brave\r\n   souls like you who, like you, see only white and black.\r\n   Nothing but white and black! Why, _citoyens_, the complex is\r\n   grey, all shades of grey.”\r\n\r\n   Again he says: “You see, my dear” (he is speaking to an ardent\r\n   socialist girl), “that in the things of the social order we\r\n   meet rarely a problem simple enough to make it possible to\r\n   assert;—‘it is this’ or ‘it is that.’ Generally, between\r\n   _this_ and _that_ there are an endless number of points to\r\n   elucidate.... There is a high civilisation with plenty of\r\n   grain, with immense unemployed forces, with a science already\r\n   so large that it can resolve the problem of giving to all a\r\n   nest and nourishment; ... and those above are stupid, and\r\n   those below are stupid, and all so evilly disposed! My God!\r\n   dear child, if the people were not a brutal instinct, we might\r\n   indeed hope for a consoling solution.”\r\n\r\nStill, again, speaking to a group upon the Bourse: “‘History, science,\r\ndaily observation, demonstrate to us that nothing durable is elaborated\r\nwithout the aid of the great collaborator, Time. Did this\r\nhorse-chestnut-tree grow in a day? And you would have the humanity which\r\nhas evolved so slowly—oh, so slowly!—through myriads of years,\r\nhumanity bounded by prejudices, by predispositions against progressive\r\nideas, humanity which includes a hundred social sects ready to combat\r\neach other,—you would have this humanity change by means of a lousy,\r\nbloody, revolution? Granted that once, after centuries of patience, a\r\ncataclysm like that of ‘93 occurred. (And, even so, France, properly\r\nspeaking, has no reason to felicitate itself over Jacobinism.) But you\r\npretend to establish as a normal condition these cataclysms which can be\r\nonly the exception in the social life; and it is this that I am\r\npowerless to conceive.’\r\n\r\n   “‘Bravo!’ exclaimed the bourgeois.\r\n\r\n   “‘I have nothing to do with your bravos!’ cried the\r\n   Bilatéral, with a shade of nervousness. ‘If their ignorance\r\n   saddens me, your rottenness exasperates me; and it is not of\r\n   protecting the rich that I think, but of preventing a generous\r\n   minority of the poor from getting themselves butchered to no\r\n   purpose or from casting France into the maw of the rival\r\n   powers. As to the vile and cowardly cormorants, the whole race\r\n   of big and little parasites, the vermin that swarm in this\r\n   pseudo-republic alongside of the Orleanist penny-scrapers and\r\n   the pests of imperialism, if I had only to press a button to\r\n   annihilate them all, I would not hesitate a second.’”\r\n\r\nOther fiction writers who have shown an understanding of the gravity of\r\nthe revolutionary issue, a familiarity with revolutionary tenets and the\r\nworkings of the revolutionary mind, but whose points of view are either\r\nneutral, like Rosny’s, or frankly hostile, are Rachilde, Jane de la\r\nVaudère, Augustin Léger, Paul Dubost, and Adolphe Chenevière. These have\r\naided the propaganda, in their own despite, by rendering the\r\nrevolutionary types familiar and comprehensible, and so lifting them out\r\nof the category of monsters.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Emile Henry’s favourite book, his “_livre de chevet_,” the\r\nbook which he contrived to secrete in his cell during a part of his\r\nimprisonment, and which his jailers, when they pounced upon it, imagined\r\nto be of the most incendiary nature, was Cervantes’ _Don Quixote_. And\r\nit is not infrequently the case, in this matter of literature, that the\r\nmost potent revolutionary agents are those which make the least pretence\r\nof being so. The masterpieces of the humourists Meilhac, Halévy, Tristan\r\nBernard, Jules Renard, Pierre Veber, and Georges Courtéline, which hold\r\nup to ridicule rather than to reprobation the emptiness and baseness of\r\nsociety; such books of pity and of pardon as Daudet’s _Jack_, Goncourt’s\r\n_Fille Elisa_, and Loti’s _Livre de la Pitié et de la Mort_; books of\r\naspiration, like Prévost’s _Confessions d’un Amant_ and Bourget’s _Terre\r\nPromise_; of wrath, like Léon Daudet’s _Morticoles_; of “revolt against\r\nPuritanism,” like Pierre Louys’ _Aphrodite_; of energy, like Barrès’\r\n_Déracinés_; of searching, like Huysmanns’ _Cathédrale_; of regret,\r\nlike Bazin’s _Terre qui Meurt_; of unmoral pessimism, like De\r\nMaupassant’s _Bel-Ami_; and the whole range of disquieting feminist\r\nfiction,—may turn out to be the most active social ferments and the\r\nreal forerunners (little as their authors would wish it) of violent\r\nchange,—of revolt and revolution!\r\n\r\nAll contemporary fiction, in fact, has in it something of the doubt, the\r\ntrouble, and the protest of the period; and, once upon this tack,\r\nnothing less than a minute examination of every novel and volume of\r\nshort stories that has appeared since the Franco-Prussian war would be\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nOf the essayists, critics, and philosophers[110] who are more or less\r\nmilitant iconoclasts and _révoltés_, the most important are:—\r\n\r\nA. Ferdinand Hérold, who expounds his attitude as follows: “From the\r\ntime I was able to think a little for myself, I have had an anarchist\r\nmind. I mean that I have always had a horror of undisputed authority, of\r\ndogmatism, and of conventional ideas,—ideas which, the greater part of\r\nthe time, one does not attempt to justify to himself”; Camille Mauclair,\r\nwho says: “If anarchy is primarily the reform of ethics, in accordance\r\nwith the principles of individualism, I can declare squarely that\r\nanarchy was born in me, with the study of metaphysics and the awakening\r\nof sensibility in the period when I began to know myself....\r\nFurthermore, pity for the disinherited and execration of the spoliators\r\nis a point of honour for the few clean and upright people who are still\r\nto be found in the world”; Bernard Lazare,[111] who says: “Authority,\r\nits value, and its _raison d’être_ are things which I have never been\r\nable to comprehend. That a man arrogate to himself the right to domineer\r\nover his fellows, in any fashion whatsoever, is still inconceivable to\r\nme. At first I regarded myself as the only victim of baneful\r\ncircumstances and vicious wills. Later I came to consider mankind at\r\nlarge; and from my own sentiments I divined the feelings of those who\r\nmore or less continuously, or at some moment of their existence, are\r\nslaves. Then what had appeared to me odious for myself appeared to me\r\nodious for all”; Gustave Geffroy, who devoted a decade to his biography\r\nof the Communard Blanqui, entitled _L’Enfermé_; Henry Mazel, who\r\nexclaimed in the _Mercure de France_, “We are all anarchists, thank\r\nGod!” Alfred Naquet, a convert from nationalism; Urbain Gohier, author\r\nof _L’Armée contre la Nation_; Victor Charbonnel, ex-priest and editor\r\nof _La Raison_, and Henri Bérenger, editor of _L’Action_, who have acted\r\ntogether in exciting the masses to anti-clerical rioting; the\r\nsocialist-anthropologist Charles Letourneau; the bacteriologists\r\nMelchnikoff, Roux, and Duclaux;[112] Charles Albert and Armand\r\nCharpentier, apostles of _l’amour libre_; Christian Cornélissen, Georges\r\nPioch, Jean Jullien, G. Bachot, Léopold Lacour, Jules Laforgue,[112] B.\r\nGuineaudau, Auguste Chirac, Albert Delacour, E. Fournière, Jacques\r\nSantarelle, Louis Lumet, Maurice Bigeon, A. Hamon, Camille de St. Croix,\r\nFélix Fénéon, Han Ryner, Alex. Cohen, Henri Bauer,[112] Charles Vallier,\r\nGabriel de la Salle, Emile Michelet, Laurent Tailhade, Francis de\r\nPressensé, Maurice Le Blond, Saint-Georges de Bouhélier, G. Lhermitte,\r\nPaul Robin, Eugène Montfort, and Gustave Kahn.\r\n\r\nIn the first months of 1891 a weekly publication called\r\n_L’Endehors_[113] (_The Outsider_) was founded by a band of young\r\nliterary men. They were Zo d’Axa, Roinard, Georges Darien, Félix Fénéon,\r\nLucien Descaves, Victor Barrucand, Arthur Byl, A. Tabarant, Bernard\r\nLazare, Charles Malato, Pierre Quillard, Ghil, Edmond Cousturier, Henri\r\nFèvre, Edouard Dubus, A. F. Hérold, Georges Lecomte, Etienne Decrept,\r\nEmile Henry, Saint-Pol-Roux, Jules Méry, Alexandre Cohen, J. LeCoq,\r\nChatel, Cholin, Ludovic Malquin, Camille Mauclair, Octave Mirbeau,\r\nLucien Muhlfeld, Pierre Veber, Victor Melnotte, A. Mercier, Tristan\r\nBernard, Paul Adam, Charles Saunier, Jean Ajalbert, Emile Verhaeren,\r\nHenri de Regnier, and Francis Vielé-Griffin.\r\n\r\nThe journal bore by way of epigraph this phrase of its leading spirit\r\nand director, Zo d’Axa: “_Celui que rien n’enrôle et qu’une impulsive\r\nnature guide seule, ce hors la loi, ce hors d’école, cet isolé chercheur\r\nd’au delà, ne se dessine-t-il pas dans ce mot, L’Endehors?_”\r\n\r\nIt explained its purpose as follows: “We belong neither to a party nor\r\nto a group. We are outsiders. We go on our way, individuals, without the\r\nFaith which saves and blinds. Our disgust with society does not engender\r\nconvictions in us. We fight for the pleasure of fighting without\r\ndreaming of a better future. What matter to us the to-morrows which in\r\nthe centuries shall be! What matter to us the little nephews! It is\r\n_endehors_, outside of all laws, of all rules, of all theories, even\r\nanarchistic; it is now, from this moment, that we wish to give ourselves\r\nover to our compassions, to our transports, to our gentleness, to our\r\nwrath, to our instincts, with the proud consciousness of being\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nThe first number of _L’Endehors_ appeared in May, 1891, immediately\r\nafter the massacre of Fourmies,—in which old men, women, and children,\r\namong them a young girl bearing a hawthorn sprig by way of a flag of\r\ntruce, were shot down by the troops of the government,—and dealt\r\nbravely and scathingly with this horrible incident; and the last number\r\nwas issued in January, 1893, when the paper was forcibly suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe staff of _L’Endehors_ defended and even glorified Ravachol.\r\nMirbeau’s “_Apologie de Ravachol_” (referred to above) is one of the\r\nfinest bits of impassioned writing he has ever done. Paul Adam’s “_Eloge\r\nde Ravachol_” is also noteworthy. Here is a brief extract:—\r\n\r\n   “Politics would have been banished completely from our\r\n   preoccupations, had not the legend of sacrifice, of the gift\r\n   of a life for the happiness of humanity, suddenly reappeared\r\n   in our epoch, with the martyrdom of Ravachol.... At the end of\r\n   all these judicial proceedings, _chroniques_, and calls to\r\n   legal murder, Ravachol stands as the unmistakable propagator\r\n   of the great idea of the ancient religions, which extolled\r\n   the seeking of death by the individual for the good of the\r\n   world,—the abnegation of one’s self, of one’s life, and one’s\r\n   good name by the exaltation of the humble and the poor.\r\n   Ravachol is plainly the restorer of the essential\r\n   sacrifice....\r\n\r\n   “He saw suffering round about him, and he has ennobled the\r\n   suffering of others by offering his own in a holocaust. His\r\n   incontestable charity and disinterestedness, the energy of his\r\n   acts, his courage before inevitable death, lift him into the\r\n   splendours of legend. In this time of cynicism and of irony A\r\n   SAINT IS BORN TO US. His blood will be the example from which\r\n   new courages and new martyrs will spring. The grand idea of\r\n   universal altruism will bloom in the red pool at the foot of\r\n   the guillotine. A fruitful death is about to be consummated.\r\n   An event of human history is about to be inscribed in the\r\n   annals of the peoples. The legal murder of Ravachol will open\r\n   a new era.”\r\n\r\n_L’Endehors_ prophesied (or rather supposed), in an article entitled\r\n“_Notre Complot_,” Vaillant’s attempt against the Chamber;[114] and the\r\nex-members of its staff participated, after its supposition had become a\r\nfact, in the phenomenal demonstrations at Vaillant’s tomb. The\r\nindignation in literary circles over the execution of Vaillant was so\r\nintense that M. Magnard in _Le Figaro_ uttered a vigorous protest\r\nagainst “_la Vaillantolâtrie_”; and the most orthodox writers in the\r\nmost orthodox journals suddenly proclaimed the necessity of stemming\r\nthis tide of anarchistic heresy in high places (to which _L’Endehors_\r\nhad, so to speak, first given a habitation and a name) by the\r\naccomplishment of a number of necessary but long-delayed legal and\r\nsocial reforms.\r\n\r\nThe unlettered protagonist of Augustin Léger’s novel _Le Journal d’un\r\nAnarchiste_ appreciates the review conducted by one Hector de la\r\nRoche-Sableuse, of which _L’Endehors_ may well have been the model, in\r\nthe following fashion:—\r\n\r\n   “After all, in spite of their gibberish, these reviews of the\r\n   _jeunes gens_ lent me by Roche-Sableuse are sometimes\r\n   interesting. They shed crocodile tears over the lot of the\r\n   people? It is possible. They do not believe a word of what\r\n   they write? I do not say no. All this does not prevent them\r\n   from seeing clearly at times, and from putting their fingers\r\n   often on the truth. Besides, although these fine little\r\n   _messieurs_ are not in the least anxious at heart for the\r\n   triumph of the proletariat, because they know very well that\r\n   it would remove several cushions from under their elbows, they\r\n   understand and they expound perfectly the legitimacy of our\r\n   claims. And I applaud with both hands the eulogiums they\r\n   pronounce on the noble victims our cause already counts. In\r\n   short, they have interested me, and I have learned not a\r\n   little from them.”\r\n\r\n_L’Endehors_ was publicly praised by Georges Clemenceau, Henri Bauer,\r\nLaurent-Tailhade, and Jean de Mitty. The last-named said of it:—\r\n\r\n   “This little sheet so modest in appearance and at the same\r\n   time so fastidious in make-up that it might easily have been\r\n   taken for a club periodical or for the exclusive organ of a\r\n   few æsthetes, raised more tempests and provoked more passions\r\n   than a riot in the street. Violent it certainly was, and\r\n   violent with a violence which, for wearing always a literary,\r\n   subtile, and complex form, penetrated no less deeply, and\r\n   gained no less to its object the scattered energies and wills\r\n   that were craving definite guidance. Opportune or not, the\r\n   influence of _L’Endehors_ was exerted effectively.... But,\r\n   aside from its action on public affairs, the journal of Zo\r\n   d’Axa realised an incontestable intellectual effort; and it is\r\n   for the beauty of this effort that it pleases me to invoke\r\n   it.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that Emile Henry, in whose pontifical attitude before\r\nhis judges even his bitterest antagonists found “something atrociously\r\nsuperior and disquieting,” and in whom the sympathetic Albert Delacour\r\ndiscerns, or thinks he discerns (by reason of his solitary meditations,\r\nhis perpetual ratiocination, his hatred of action up to the moment of\r\nsupreme action, his disgust with life,[115] and his brooding on death),\r\na modern Hamlet, is the only member of the _Endehors_ group who has\r\ncommitted an overt act of violence.\r\n\r\nOf the rest, some have since identified themselves closely with\r\nsocialism, some with Boulangism and nationalism, and some with\r\nanarchism; some have given themselves to the creation of the humorous or\r\nthe beautiful without too obvious a destructive prepossession; and some\r\nhave held themselves scrupulously “_endehors_.”\r\n\r\nMost have remained _révoltés_ of one sort or another. Only a few have\r\nconformed, and a part of these only outwardly. Thus Paul Adam, who has\r\nseemed several times, by reason of the enormous range of his interests\r\nand the disconcerting agility of his intelligence, to be utterly lost to\r\nrevolution, has written, nevertheless, a number of novels of\r\nrevolutionary trend. He published in 1900 a defence of Bresci which\r\nmight have been written the very same day as his “_Eloge_” of Ravachol,\r\nand he reaffirmed his essential anarchism as late as the spring of 1904.\r\n\r\nOf those who have remained strictly “_endehors_,” Zo d’Axa,[116]\r\nuncorrected by hard experiences of prison and exile, resumed in 1898 his\r\nassault upon the abuses of society in his now famous _Feuilles_ with a\r\nfierceness, a versatility, an independence, a finesse, a facility in\r\nanathema, and a redundance in disdain that have rarely, if ever, been\r\nmatched in revolutionary pamphleteering—and privateering. It was as if\r\nMirbeau, with all the withering force of his mighty scorn, had descended\r\ninto the street, or as if _Père Peinard_ had attained the level of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe _Feuilles de Zo d’Axa_ appeared irregularly in the form of\r\nplacards, as events invited, during the troubled years of 1898 and 1899,\r\nand created an enormous sensation. Nothing was exempt from the\r\nsharpshooting of this guerilla of the asphalt,—this handsome,\r\nred-bearded “_mousquetaire chercheur de justes aventures_,” whom all\r\nParis knows by his picturesque brown cape and felt.\r\n\r\n   “To the argument of the multitude,” he wrote in his\r\n   salutatory, “to the catechism of the crowds, to all the\r\n   _raisons-d’état_ of the collectivity, behold the personal\r\n   reasons of the Individual oppose themselves!... He goes his\r\n   way, he acts, he takes aim, because a combative instinct makes\r\n   him prefer the chase to the nostalgic siesta. On the borders\r\n   of the code he poaches the big game,—officers and judges,\r\n   bucks or _carnivori_. He dislodges from the forests of Bondy\r\n   the herd of politicians. He amuses himself by snaring the\r\n   ravaging financier. He beats up at all the cross-roads the\r\n   domesticated _gent de lettres_, fur and feathers; all the\r\n   debauchers of ideas, all the monsters of the press and the\r\n   police.”\r\n\r\nLucien Descaves compares the series of Zo d’Axa’s writings to “a\r\nbeautiful road bordered with pity and hatred and paved with wrath and\r\nrevolt.”\r\n\r\nHe says further of him: “Zo d’Axa’s phrase is rapid. The fuse of his\r\narticles is short. When a match is approached to them, something is\r\nbound to explode; and D’Axa is quite capable of sacrificing himself, if\r\nneed be, in the explosion. He has proved it.”\r\n\r\nThe suppression of _L’Endehors_ (whose complete file is now one of the\r\nrarities of the book-mart) and the consequent dispersion of the\r\n_Endehors_ band were soon followed by the formation of another\r\nrevolutionary coterie of young poets, men of letters, and sociologists,\r\ncalled “_Le Groupe de l’Idée Nouvelle_.” This group (of whom Paul Adam,\r\nA. Hamon, Victor Barrucand, and Jean Carrière were the most prominent\r\nfigures) organised a series of _soirées-conférences_, which were given\r\nat the _Hôtel Continental_, during the winter of 1893-94, with great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XAVIER PRIVAS DELIVERING HIS LECTURE\r\n\r\n_L’Idée Nouvelle_ (somewhat tamed by time, it is true) still exists.\r\nThe following announcement, which appeared in 1900 in the anarchist\r\njournal _Les Temps Nouveaux_, explains its more recent activities and\r\naims:—\r\n\r\n   “L’ARGENT CONTRE L’HUMANITÉ”]\r\n\r\n   “_L’Idée Nouvelle_ informs the public that hereafter it adds\r\n   to its title _La Rénovation Sociale par le Travail_, and\r\n   announces that the first _conférence_ of the year will be\r\n   given at the _Hôtel des Sociétés Savantes_, Sunday, November\r\n   18, at three o’clock, by the poet and _chansonnier_ Xavier\r\n   Privas.[117] Subject, ‘_L’Argent contre l’Humanité_.’ The\r\n   second, to be given early in December by the sculptor Jean\r\n   Baffier, will treat ‘_La Corporation Autonome et l’Entreprise\r\n   Capitaliste_.’”\r\n\r\nTo the former committee of _L’Idée Nouvelle_, composed of men of\r\nletters, among whom were Paul Adam, Jules Cazes, Lucien Descaves, Louis\r\nde Grammont, Georges Lecomte, and Léopold Lacour, the artists Eugène\r\nCarrière, Jules Dalou, and Steinlen, and the geographer Elisée Reclus,\r\nconsented to join themselves at the time of the adoption of its new\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHere is the text of the declarations by means of which _La Rénovation\r\nSociale par le Travail_ quickly rallied to its support many of those of\r\nthe intellectual _élite_ who are thinking and acting along the lines of\r\nthe better aspirations of humanity:—\r\n\r\n   “Believing that the action of money as a medium of exchange is\r\n   universally injurious, that it is the source of all the\r\n   turpitudes and all the infamies of society; that almost all\r\n   the crimes, the enmities, the divisions, have for their\r\n   initial cause a question of interest,—namely, money; believing\r\n   also that money, far from being, as some pretend, a stimulus\r\n   to production, is rather an obstacle to it; that venality and\r\n   mercantilism dishonour and paralyse art, kill noble dreams and\r\n   generous ambitions; that too often, in the actual condition of\r\n   society, we propose to ourselves as the end of life, not an\r\n   ideal of beauty, of truth, of justice, but money; believing,\r\n   further, that there is no other means for counteracting such a\r\n   situation than by glorifying, rehabilitating, and equitably\r\n   apportioning labour, and by insisting strenuously on this law\r\n   of nature, that every consumer should be a producer, the\r\n   consumption being proportioned to the need, and the production\r\n   to the faculty and the aptitude,—the members of the committee\r\n   for _La Rénovation Sociale par le Travail_ pledge themselves\r\n   to spread these ideas by every means in their power,—by the\r\n   pen, by word, and by example.”\r\n\r\nThis group is at present preparing a fête, to be held in the fall of\r\n1904, for the “glorification of all the innovators to whom humanity is\r\nindebted for advancement along the line of integral emancipation.”\r\n\r\nThe _Noël Humaine_ (Human Christmas) is celebrated annually by another\r\ngroup of emancipated men of letters, under the auspices of Victor\r\nCharbonnel’s journal, _La Raison_.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary fervour of a considerable portion of the intellectual\r\n_élite_ has found further expression during the last ten years in a\r\nscore or more of reviews (”_jeunes revues_” or “_revues des jeunes_”)\r\n“which,” says Paul Adam, “have created, promulgated, sustained, and\r\ncaused to triumph almost two-thirds of the ideas upon which the new\r\ncentury is beginning its life.” “In each,” says the same writer, “a\r\ngroup of disinterested spirits, extraordinarily erudite, indifferent to\r\nsuccess and fortune, eager for knowledge and proud in its acquisition,\r\nhave cultivated the most beautiful garden of mentality which has been\r\nseen in France since the Pléïade and Port-Royal. Poets, sociologists,\r\nromancers, and critics have disseminated thereby marvellous beauties.”\r\n\r\nM. Adam exaggerates, as he is very apt to do. Nevertheless, in spite of\r\na great deal that is immature, amateurish, intemperate, and fantastic\r\nabout most of them, the _revues des jeunes_ are one of the most\r\nsignificant phenomena of these latter years.\r\n\r\nThey have been an appreciable disturbing force. The names of most of the\r\nwriters mentioned in this chapter are repeatedly appearing in their\r\ntables of contents; and their prospectuses abound in such tell-tale\r\nphrases as these: “_art libre_,” “_beauté sociale_,” “_vie féconde et\r\nhumanité forte_,” “_dévoiler les intrigues_, _combattre les abus_,”\r\n“_tribune ouverte_,” “_idées hardies et généreuses_,” “_l’âme purement\r\ndésintéressée des futurs Etats-Unis d’Europe_,” “_l’art existe pour la\r\nvie_,” “_la cité radieuse où l’humanité affranchie vivra enfin dans\r\nl’harmonie, dans la justice, et dans la force_.”\r\n\r\nFurthermore, such publications as _Le Mercure de France_, _La Grande\r\nRevue_ (edited by Fernand Labori, defender of anarchists and of\r\nDreyfus), _La Plume_ (whose _soirées littéraires_ have enjoyed an\r\ninternational renown), _La Revue de Paris_, _La Revue_, _La\r\nContemporaine_, _La Vogue_, _L’Hermitage_, and _La Grande France_, by\r\nextending the hospitality of their columns to the exploitation of the\r\nmost advanced theories and ideas, have—without claiming to be\r\nrevolutionary or, at any rate, without limiting themselves to\r\npropaganda—effectively supplemented the efforts of the propagandist\r\nmediums.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary sentiments prevalent among the intellectual _élite_ of\r\nFrance have found abundant expression in the French drama, as was to be\r\nexpected in a country which has a literary stage and in which nearly\r\nevery man of letters is something of a playwright. Indeed, it would not\r\nbe surprising if the stage, by reason of its superior capacity for\r\ngiving vividness to ideas, were quite as efficacious an instrument of\r\nrevolutionary propaganda as the press, the _chanson_, or the novel.\r\n\r\nOctave Mirbeau is the author of several plays, three of which, _Les\r\nMauvais Bergers_, _L’Epidémie_, and _L’Acquitté_, teem with caustic,\r\nuncompromising anarchism.\r\n\r\n_Les Mauvais Bergers_ was successfully produced by Bernhardt’s company\r\nin 1897. Its hero, Jean Roule, is a young, thoughtful, aspiring workman,\r\nwho has suffered so much at the hands of the capitalists and the\r\nauthorities and has seen so much suffering imposed on others from the\r\nsame sources that he is possessed with a colossal, implacable hatred of\r\neverybody and everything that has to do with power. On the other hand,\r\nhis heart is full to bursting with unselfish love for the unfortunate\r\nproletariat. “I want to live,” he cries, “to live in my flesh, in my\r\nbrain, in the expansion of all my organs, of all my faculties, instead\r\nof remaining the beast of burden that is flogged and the unthinking\r\nmachine that is turned for others. I want to be a man, in short,—a man\r\nin my own eyes.... We also need some poetry and some art in our lives;\r\nfor, poor as he may be, a man does not live by bread alone. He has a\r\nright, like the rich, to things of beauty.... These flames, this smoke,\r\nthese tortures, these accursed machines which every day and every hour\r\ndevour my brain, my heart, my right to happiness, my right to\r\nlife,—these—these yawning mouths of ovens, these fiery furnaces, these\r\ncaldrons which are fed with my muscles, with my will, with my liberty,\r\nby the shovelful,—to make out of them the wealth and the social\r\npuissance of a single man! Extinguish all that, I entreat you! Blow up\r\nall that! Annihilate all that!”\r\n\r\nHis most complete abhorrence is the politician. The employer is white\r\nbeside him. “The employer is a man, like you. You have him before you.\r\nYou speak to him, you move him, you threaten him, you kill him! At\r\nleast, he has a visage,—a chest in which to sink a knife. But go move\r\nthis being without a visage called politician! Go kill this thing called\r\npolitics,—this slimy, slippery thing which you think you hold and which\r\nalways escapes you, which you believe dead and which always comes to\r\nlife again,—this abominable thing by which everything has been debased,\r\neverything corrupted, everything bought, everything sold,—justice,\r\nlove, beauty!—which has made venality of conscience a national\r\ninstitution of France; which has done worse still, since with its filthy\r\nslaver it has befouled the august face of the poor! worse still, since\r\nit has destroyed in you your last ideal,—faith in Revolution!”\r\n\r\nAided and inspirited by a working-girl, Madeleine (Bernhardt’s rôle),\r\nthis Jean Roule, who would kill as much from excess of love as from\r\nhate, leads the workmen in a revolt against their employers. But the\r\nlatter are sustained by government troops, and the play ends with a\r\nmassacre and a procession of coffins.\r\n\r\n_L’Epidémie_ (1898) is an extravagant one-act comedy,—almost a\r\nfarce,—caricaturing the culpable indifference of the bourgeois\r\npolitician to the welfare of the humble and his extreme solicitude for\r\nthe welfare of the rich. Typhoid fever has made several victims in the\r\nmilitary barracks of a provincial city. The municipal council assembles\r\nfor the purpose of taking measures to arrest it. When the council\r\nlearns, however, that the disease has attacked no one outside the\r\nbarracks, and within the barracks only the private soldiers, whose duty,\r\nwhose glory it is to give their lives for their country, it decides to\r\ndo nothing, to the accompaniment of enthusiastic cries of “_Vive la\r\nFrance!_” The decision has scarcely been made when a messenger arrives\r\nwith the news that a bourgeois has died of the plague. Thereupon the\r\ncouncil reconsiders its former action, votes to erect a statue to the\r\ndead bourgeois, to name a street in his honour, to demolish the city’s\r\nunsanitary quarters, to open up boulevards, and to introduce a water\r\nsystem, and makes an appropriation of 100,000,000 francs therefor.\r\nFinally, each councillor rises in turn, and pronounces a panegyric of\r\nthe bourgeois victim.\r\n\r\n_L’Acquitté_, another one-act comedy, presents the adventure of a\r\nvagabond, Jean Guenille, who, having carried to the police station (in\r\nan access of honesty) a purse of 10,000 francs which he found in the\r\nstreet, is browbeaten and put under lock and key by the _commissaire_\r\nbecause he has no legal domicile. M. Mirbeau’s other plays, _Vieux\r\nMénages_ (1900), _Le Portefeuille_ and _Scrupules_ (1902), and _Les\r\nAffaires sont les Affaires_ (1903),—the last-named[118] an exposition\r\nof the power of money to destroy natural sentiments,—are only a shade\r\nless subversive in tone.\r\n\r\nLucien Descaves has to his credit a one-act anarchistic play, entitled\r\n_La Cage_. The Havenne family (consisting of father, mother, a son\r\nAlbert, aged twenty-one, and a daughter Madeleine, aged twenty-six),\r\nthreatened with eviction and unable to pay their rent or find work, are\r\nin black despair. The father and mother, in the temporary absence of\r\nAlbert and Madeleine, drink a vial of laudanum and light a brazier of\r\ncharcoal. The children return, find their parents dead, and, desiring to\r\ndie likewise, submit themselves to the poisonous fumes of the brazier,\r\nwhich is still burning. They bethink themselves in time, however, decide\r\nthat it is less cowardly to steal than to die, and set out together for\r\na career of outlawry and revolutionary apostleship. “Are we quite sure,\r\nMadeleine, that there is nothing better to do than to kill ourselves?”\r\nqueries Albert. And then he quotes the famous letter of Frederick of\r\nPrussia to D’Alembert: “If there should be found a family destitute of\r\nall resources and in the frightful condition you depict, I should not\r\nhesitate to decide theft legitimate.... The ties of society are based\r\nupon reciprocal services; but, if this society is composed of pitiless\r\nsouls, all engagements are broken.”\r\n\r\n_La Cage_ was suppressed by the censorship[119] very early in its\r\ncareer. Descaves, who dedicated his work “_Aux désespérés pour qu’ils\r\nchoisissent_,” foresaw and publicly predicted its interdiction. “Let me\r\ntry,” he said, “to put on the stage, instead of adulteries and\r\nembarrassing _liaisons_, the distress of a bourgeois family at the end\r\nof its resources, its illusions, and its courage,—the parents reduced\r\nto suicide and the children precipitated into revolt. Ah! you’ll hear a\r\nfine clatter!”\r\n\r\nThe severity of the censorship towards _La Cage_ called out numerous\r\nprotests, notably this from Alexander Hepp (in his _Quotidiens_), little\r\nsuspected of doctrinal sympathy with Descaves: “As soon as we show to\r\nthe gallery the reality of the miseries, the despairs, the injustices of\r\nsociety, a fragment of real life, of the true cross people carry, our\r\ndelicate sensibilities are shocked; and it is always before that which\r\nis truest that we cry out improbability. The innovating tendencies, the\r\nharsh accent of retribution, the virile sincerity of Descaves, who puts\r\non the boards a family driven to suicide, have disturbed the digestions\r\nof the orchestra.”\r\n\r\nThe critic Henri Bauer, commenting on _Les Mauvais Bergers_ and _La\r\nCage_, wrote: “An anti-social dramatic literature is born in France....\r\nIt required authors of the power and eloquence of Mirbeau, of the\r\ndevouring passion and the admirable soul of Descaves, to dare to ring\r\nout in dramatic dialogue this conclusion, _On n’améliore pas la société,\r\non la supprime_.... Society is a lie, social progress a lure, the social\r\npact is broken: nothing is left but the individual,—his temperament,\r\nhis law, his conscience, and his will.”\r\n\r\nDescaves’ _Tiers Etat_ is an eloquent plea for the faithful mistress who\r\nis debarred from marriage by legal technicalities. He is also joint\r\nauthor with Georges Darien of _Les Chapons_ (to which this legend was\r\nprefixed: “_Aux Mânes des Bourgeois de Calais nous sacrifions ce\r\nspécimen de leur pitoyable descendance_”), and with Maurice Donnay of\r\n_La Clairière_ and _Oiseaux de Passage_. _La Clairière_, which was one\r\nof the notable features of the theatrical season of 1898-99, pictures\r\nthe life of an anarchist _phalanstère_, which succeeds admirably until\r\nthe members send for their _compagnes_, when it is demoralised and\r\ndisintegrated by petty intrigues and jealousies.\r\n\r\nThe moral? Not the obvious and absurd one that men alone will constitute\r\nthe society of the future; but this, that women have not been\r\nenfranchised long enough to have developed the maturity of character\r\nnecessary to the practice of anarchist precepts. _Oiseaux de Passage_\r\ndeals with the experiences of anarchists in exile. “I am proud,” says M.\r\nDescaves, apropos of the piece, “to have been able to transfer to the\r\nstage the theories of a Bakounine, and to introduce them to the public\r\nthus.”\r\n\r\nMaurice Donnay is a railing nihilist, subtle, graceful, and gracious,\r\nsomewhat after the Anatole France pattern,—a smiling _révolté_, a\r\nrefined recalcitrant, whose recipe for a play is said to be “a little\r\nlove, much adultery, an enormous amount of _esprit_, a pinch of\r\npolitics, and a gramme of sociology,” and whose psychology is “a\r\nsparkling, effervescing affair, the analyses of which explode merrily\r\nwith the welcome noise of popping champagne corks.”\r\n\r\nIn _Amants_, _La Douloureuse_, _La Bascule_, _Le Retour de Jérusalem_,\r\nand _Georgette Lemonnier_, Donnay is prodigal of _bons mots_ and\r\nmalicious pleasantries, by which he gives the most piquant conceivable\r\nflavour to the social and political infamies of the time. _Le Torrent_,\r\nhis most ambitious work, has this much of the serious, that death is its\r\ndénouement; but its general method and attitude do not differ\r\nessentially from the method and attitude of his other plays.\r\n\r\nTo those who expressed surprise that the flippant Donnay should\r\ncollaborate with the truculent Descaves, Donnay himself said: “A young\r\nman, I produced at the _Chat Noir_ my piece _Pension de Famille_, which\r\nwon me the honour of being called ‘joyous anarchist’ by Jules Lemaître.\r\nI remained an anarchist in _La Douloureuse_. And, without doubt, I have\r\nalways been an anarchist; more, it is true, for sentimental than for\r\nsociological reasons, but also from a point of view exclusively\r\nphilosophical. He who analyses, he who, without ceasing, unravels the\r\nmeshes of this complicated network of ideas which constitutes the social\r\norder, is more or less of an anarchist necessarily, is he not?”\r\n\r\nOther works of unequivocal revolt produced within the last fifteen years\r\nare:—\r\n\r\n_Mais Quelqu’un Troubla la Fête_,[120] a one-act piece by Louis\r\nMarsolleau. A financier, a politician, a bishop, a general, a judge, a\r\nduchess, and a courtesan (so many types of the powerful and privileged\r\nof the world) partake hilariously of a sumptuous banquet. Their revels\r\nare interrupted by the apparition first of a peasant, then of a city\r\nlabourer, and are finally put an end to by a mysterious and terrible\r\nunknown, who causes a general explosion.\r\n\r\n_Sur la Foi des Etoiles_, by Gabriel Trarieux,—an esoteric symbolistic\r\neffort, a groping towards the society of the future: “I say to myself:\r\nThe stars up yonder, with their fixed, impassive air, the stars which\r\nhave mounted guard for centuries, are living worlds.... They die and are\r\nborn. I compare them to the truths which guide us.... For there are\r\nseveral truths,—... some very ancient, almost extinguished, to which we\r\nsubmit by force of habit, and some—oh! just emerging—which will not be\r\ntrue before to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n_Le Cuivre_, by Paul Adam and André Picard, which exposes and explains\r\nthe tyranny exercised by money over persons and governments; and\r\n_L’Automne_, by Paul Adam and Gabriel Mourey (forbidden by the\r\ncensorship).\r\n\r\n_Le Domaine_, by Lucien Besnard, which recounts the progress of\r\nsocialism in the rural districts, and defines the antagonism between the\r\ndecadent nobility and the rising fourth estate.\r\n\r\n_La Pâque Socialiste_, by Emile Veyrin, which describes a practical\r\nexperiment in Christian socialism.\r\n\r\n_La Sape_, by Georges Leneven, the hero of which is an anarchist dreamer\r\nof a highly intellectual type, _Le Détour_ by Henry Bernstein, and _Le\r\nMasque_ by Henri Bataille.\r\n\r\n_Le Voile du Bonheur_, by Georges Clemenceau, which employs Chinese\r\npersonages and a Chinese setting to explain the manner in which\r\nFrenchmen are fooled and ruled by their “mandarins”; and _Les Petits\r\nPieds_ by Henry de Saussine, which employs a similar device to ridicule\r\nFrench education.\r\n\r\n_Le Ressort: Etude de Révolution_, mystic and ominous, by Urbain Gohier;\r\n_Barbapoux_, savagely anti-clerical, by Charles Malato; _En Détresse_,\r\nwith a conclusion akin to that of Descaves’ _Cage_, by Henri Fèvre;\r\n_L’Ami de l’Ordre_, by Georges Darien; _La Grève_, by Jean Hugues;\r\n_Conte de Noël_ and _Des Cloches du Cain_, by Auguste Linert; _Le\r\nChemineau_, by Richepin; Jean Ajalbert’s adaptation of De Goncourt’s _La\r\nFille Elisa_;[121] and the pieces of Hérold, Pierre Valdagne, and\r\nGeorges Lecomte.\r\n\r\nThese performances have been supplemented by revivals of De Maupassant’s\r\n_Boule de Suif_, which portrays the sacrifice made by a prostitute for\r\nthe bourgeois and her ostracism by them when they have no further need\r\nof her assistance; of the stage version of Zola’s _Germinal_ in the\r\ntheatres of the working faubourgs; and of certain precursors, such as\r\nHenri Becque’s _Les Corbeaux_ (probably the most terrible arraignment of\r\nlaw and lawyers ever written) and _L’Evasion_ and _La Révolte_ of\r\nVilliers de l’Isle-Adam; and by the importation of the principal works\r\nof the Russian, Belgian, Scandinavian, German, Italian, and Spanish\r\ninnovators.\r\n\r\nAlfred Capus, the principal rival of Maurice Donnay in his peculiar\r\n_genre_, holds in completest but most amiable detestation whatever has\r\nto do with regular living. Less sardonic than M. Donnay, lighter,\r\nbrighter, and more _spirituel_, if that is possible, he is equally\r\nnihilistic, though not, so far as I am aware, by personal avowal. In\r\n_Rosine_ he ventures to depict a _union libre_ receiving a father’s\r\nbenediction; and in _Qui Perd Gagne_, _Années d’Aventures_, _Les Petites\r\nFolles_, _Mariage Bourgeois_, _La Veine_, _La Bourse ou la Vie_, and\r\n_Beau Jeune Homme_ he holds up to ridicule, one after another, all the\r\ntraditional bourgeois ideals.\r\n\r\nReformers being notoriously deficient in the sense of humour, it is a\r\ncurious and piquant circumstance that not only a majority of the\r\nbrilliant school of stage humourists, currently known as the “_Auteurs\r\nGais_,” but the four most admired of the group,—Georges Courtéline,\r\nPierre Veber, Jules Renard, and Tristan Bernard,—are frankly\r\nrevolutionary, either in their personal opinions or in their writings,\r\nor in both.\r\n\r\nPierre Veber and Tristan Bernard were charter members of the\r\nrevolutionary band _L’Endehors_, and have been affiliated latterly with\r\nthat of _L’Idée Nouvelle_. Jules Renard is the bitterest of social\r\nphilosophers, under the thin disguise of a charming, impeccable style.\r\n\r\nCourtéline, whose comic genius is so strong, so pure, and so fine that\r\nhe is called, without too gross exaggeration, “_le petit-fils de\r\nMolière_”; Courtéline, who will be read and played, in the opinion of\r\nmany, long after every other contemporary French dramatist has been\r\nforgotten; Courtéline, who makes you laugh till you weep over what you\r\nought to weep over without laughing, who promotes reflection and rouses\r\nthe conscience while dispelling melancholy,—this prodigious\r\nCourtéline, truth-loving joker and humane mountebank as he is, has\r\nprobably done more than any single individual in any sphere to bring\r\ninto disrepute the brutality of the army, and to expose the perpetual\r\ncontradiction between essential justice and the texts of the law.\r\n\r\nEugène Brieux is the most prolific producer of the “_pièce à thèse\r\nsociale_” and the most indefatigable corrector of abuses connected with\r\nthe Paris stage. He has attacked the race-course and the police station\r\nin _Le Résultat des Courses_, public and private charity in _Les\r\nBienfaiteurs_, physicians in _L’Evasion_, current methods of instruction\r\nin _Blanchette_, popular ignorance of and prejudice against venereal\r\ndiseases in _Les Avariés_,[122] the law and the administrators of the\r\nlaw in _La Robe Rouge_ (”_C’est donc la loi qui rend criminel?_”), and\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies in _L’Engrenage_; and he has defended the rights\r\nof children against parents in _Le Berceau_, the rights of the artistic\r\ntemperament in _Ménages d’Artistes_, the rights of the poor against the\r\nrich in _Les Remplaçantes_, and the rights of the _fille-mère_ in\r\n_Maternité_.\r\n\r\nM. Brieux is not easy to locate doctrinally or otherwise. He is not an\r\n“_auteur gai_,” far from it, and is not, in the strict sense of the\r\nterm, perhaps, a revolutionist. But his mania for the correction of\r\nabuses has surely beguiled him more than once into an attitude towards\r\nsociety that is, to all intents and purposes, revolutionary.\r\n\r\nThe rugged, poetic, weird, and philosophical François de Curel is as\r\ndifficult to locate doctrinally as M. Brieux. There are times when he\r\nseems to be as irreverent a nihilist as M. France, M. Donnay, or M.\r\nRichepin, and times when he seems to be as reverently ecclesiastical and\r\nreactionary as M. Paul Bourget or M. le Comte de Mun. All his\r\nplays—_Les Fossiles_, in which he pictures the pathetic impotence of\r\nthe exhausted nobility; _La Nouvelle Idole_, in which he alternately\r\nexalts and belittles science; _La Fille Sauvage_, in which he studies\r\nthe demoralising effect of civilisation upon the mind of the savage;\r\nand _Le Repas du Lion_, in which he confronts orthodox economy with the\r\nsocialist’s dream—admit of different and absolutely contradictory\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\nBut _Le Repas du Lion_ is claimed, with at least a show of reason, by\r\nthe socialists, because of its dénouement. One of its wealthy characters\r\nelucidates the conflict between labour and capital by means of a\r\nparable, “The Lion and the Jackal.” The lion hunts for himself. The\r\njackal, too feeble to hunt for himself, follows the lion. The lion\r\ngorges himself with his prey. The jackal eats what the lion leaves. If\r\nthere were no lion to hunt for him, the jackal would starve. Ergo, the\r\nlion is the benefactor of the jackal.\r\n\r\nA labourer objects: “In that case, Monsieur, there is a lion; and we are\r\nthe jackals. Since you choose to have the business settled between wild\r\nbeasts, we will follow you on to your own ground. When the jackals find\r\nthat the remnants left by the lion do not garnish their paunches\r\nsufficiently, they get together in great numbers, surprise the king, and\r\ndevour him alive.”\r\n\r\nThe labourer’s objection is given force by the shooting of the\r\ncapitalist of the piece. “The reply of the jackal to the lion,” comments\r\none of the minor characters.\r\n\r\nJean Jullien considers himself, if rumour speaks true, in no sense a\r\nrevolutionist. All the same, his robust drama _La Poigne_, which depicts\r\nvividly the moral ravages wrought by authority in and about a\r\nhumanitarian soul, was received enthusiastically by both the socialistic\r\nand the anarchistic press. “Socialists will take notice,” remarked a\r\nsocialist organ, “that it behooves them to lavish their money and their\r\nbravos on this attempt at ‘_L’Art Social_.’” And the theatrical critic\r\nof _Le Libertaire_ said: “The piece of Jean Jullien pleased us by its\r\nfrankness and its human interest. Rarely has an author so stirred our\r\nminds and hearts. It is only just to say that the personages exemplify\r\nthe sentiments and the ideas which are familiar to the anarchists, and\r\nthat we find in _La Poigne_ an echo of our passions.”\r\n\r\nThe same author’s _L’Ecolière_, which denounces the hypocrisy of petty\r\nprovincial functionaries and narrates the conflict of a high-minded,\r\nwarm-hearted woman with the bourgeois system of morals, was accorded a\r\nsimilar welcome in similar quarters. So also was his _Oasis_, which\r\npreaches that Humanity should create for itself, remote from “egoisms,\r\nprejudices, mutually hostile religions, and the disgraceful tumults of\r\ninjustice and war, the basis of peace, of association, and of love.”\r\n\r\nAs a _féministe_ who flouts and defies the marriage code, Paul Hervieu\r\nlays himself liable to be classed as a revolutionist, at least a partial\r\nrevolutionist, however little such a classification may please him.\r\nWhatever else they are, _La Loi de l’Homme_, _L’Armature_, _Les\r\nTenailles_, _Les Paroles Restent_, _L’Enigme_, and _Le Dédale_ are works\r\nof revolt. The first-named, _La Loi de l’Homme_, evoked the following\r\nsweeping but not unsympathetic judgment from the critic Emile de St.\r\nAuban, who, lawyer as well as critic, should know whereof he speaks:\r\n“The contemporary theatre occupies itself a great deal with the laws.\r\nThe code appears often on the boards, and the dramatist-jurists abrogate\r\nit in prose or in verse. But never was this abrogation so passionate, so\r\nbrusque, never was it so radical, so total, as in _La Loi de l’Homme_. I\r\nwill add so concise, since three very short acts, two of which make one,\r\nsuffice to erase not a text, but _the_ text, not _a_ law, but _the_ law,\r\nand with the law the cortège of egoisms and hypocrisies which have given\r\nit birth, and have assured it its full expansion and the calm and sure\r\nperpetration of its outrages; to erase, I say, an entire jurisprudence,\r\nwritten or traditional, promulgated against the weak for the strong.”\r\n\r\nTo the category of partial, unwilling, or unwitting revolutionists to\r\nwhich Jullien, Brieux, Hervieu, and De Curel belong may be assigned also\r\nJules Case in _La Vassale_, Gaston Dévore in _La Conscience d’un\r\nEnfant_, Georges Ancey in _Ces Messieurs_ and _La Dupe_, Emile Fabre in\r\n_L’Argent_, _Le Bien d’Autrui_, _La Vie Publique_, and _Comme Ils sont\r\nTous_, Rostand in _La Samaritaine_, Abel Hermant in _Le Faubourg_, _La\r\nCarrière_, and _La Meute_, Albert Guinon in _Décadence_,[123] Alexandre\r\nBisson in _Le Bon Juge_, Emile Bourgeois in _Mariage d’Argent_, and\r\nBruyerre in _En Paix_. Indeed, it is even permitted to query whether the\r\nreputed reactionaries, Jules Lemaître and Henri Lavedan, are not really\r\n(at least so far as certain of their pieces are concerned) in the same\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary and semi-revolutionary plays were for a considerable\r\nperiod well-nigh a monopoly of the _Théâtre Libre_, where unconditional\r\nliterary form and unconventional acting were the handmaids of\r\nunconventional ideas. Latterly they have invaded every legitimate stage\r\nof Paris, not excepting the august and supposedly inhospitable _Comédie\r\nFrançaise_; and they may be said to be the specialty of four houses: the\r\n_Théâtre Antoine_ (founded by Antoine after he abandoned the _Théâtre\r\nLibre_); the _Grand Guignol_, the nearest existing counterpart to the\r\n_Théâtre Libre_; and the _Gymnase_ and the _Renaissance_, which are now\r\ncopying the general policy of the _Antoine_. Maurice Maeterlinck and his\r\ncompany have latterly made their headquarters in Paris. Maeterlinck’s\r\n_Monna Vanna_ was applauded by the revolutionary organs.\r\n\r\nThe various free stages, or _théâtres à côté_, which give private\r\nperformances at irregular intervals, also reserve a modicum of space in\r\ntheir répertoires for pieces of social revolt.\r\n\r\nThe _revues_ of the variety theatres and concert halls, in which the\r\nevents of the year are criticised and caricatured with a freedom that\r\noften calls down the wrath of the censorship, particularly at\r\nMontmartre, are also far from a negligible influence in the direction of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n   In 1883 the socialist Clovis Hugues wrote, in an introduction\r\n   to a volume by the refractory Léon Cladel: “The petrification\r\n   of the republic in the bourgeois spirit does not prevent\r\n   literature from being socialistic. It is unconsciously so,\r\n   perhaps; but it is so. And this is the essential thing for the\r\n   future.... Open a romance, no matter what one, attend a\r\n   theatrical representation, no matter what one, and, so that\r\n   you have the slightest aptitude for combining details, for\r\n   surprising the idea in the fact, for following a philosophical\r\n   train through an intrigue, you will be amazed at the quantity\r\n   of socialism which emerges from this romance and that play.\r\n   Has the author felt himself responsible towards the Revolution\r\n   in writing his work? Not the least in the world. He has\r\n   yielded to the mighty pressure of events, he has submitted to\r\n   the historic fatalities of his time, the permanent influence\r\n   of humanity in travail.... What signifies this transformation?\r\n   It signifies that the philosophies soak down into literature;\r\n   it signifies that the hour is at hand, since the idea\r\n   incarnates itself involuntarily in the form; it signifies that\r\n   the fourth estate is mounting, that justice is near.”\r\n\r\nA round decade later (1894) A. Hamon, a friend of anarchy, wrote:—\r\n\r\n   “Read in the sheets which are the most hostile to the\r\n   anarchists—such as the _Figaro_, the _Journal_, the _Gil\r\n   Blas_, the _Echo de Paris_—the short stories, sketches, and\r\n   chroniques of the Mirbeaus, the Bauers, the Descaves, the Paul\r\n   Adams, the Bernard Lazares, the Ajalberts, the Sévérines,\r\n   etc., and you will perceive that anarchist tendencies throng\r\n   them. Follow the ‘_jeunes revues_,’ and you will observe that\r\n   there is not, to speak in the large, a piece of verse, a\r\n   story, a study of any sort whatsoever, which does not tend\r\n   towards the destruction of what the anarchists qualify as\r\n   social prejudice,—_la patrie_, authority, family, religion,\r\n   courts of law, militarism, etc.\r\n\r\n   “All the thinking men of this epoch,—savants, littérateurs,\r\n   artists, etc.,—one may almost say all, so rare are those who\r\n   imprison themselves in the ‘_tour d’ivoire_’ or who profess\r\n   doctrines commendatory of the existing order,—all the\r\n   relatively young men, I mean, who have attained their majority\r\n   since 1870, have _libertaire_ inclinations. The result is a\r\n   fervent propaganda under the most varied forms and in the most\r\n   dissimilar _milieux_.”\r\n\r\nStill later (1899) a declared opponent of anarchism, M. Fierens-Gevaert,\r\nwrote in his admirable social study, _La Tristesse Contemporaine_:\r\n“There are, to begin with, the militant anarchists,—a handful of\r\nwretched starvelings and lunatics, whose doctrine consists solely in\r\nlistening to the instincts of the brute within them. There are, next,\r\nthe unwitting or dilettante anarchists. These latter are legion. They\r\nare to be found in the highest grades of society. They even compose the\r\nintellectual _élite_ of their time. Every philosopher, novelist, poet,\r\ndramatist, and artist is to-day a latent anarchist; and very often he\r\nboasts of it.”\r\n\r\nJust how far this surprising situation is an heirloom of the four\r\nrevolutions which France traversed during the last century, and just how\r\nfar it is traceable to forces which have entered from without,—to\r\nNietzsche and Schopenhauer, Darwin and Spencer, Leopardi and the\r\npleiades of Russian and Scandinavian innovators,—it is not necessary to\r\ndetermine. The really significant thing is that the intellectual and\r\nsocial conditions which have produced Anatole France, Descaves, and\r\nMirbeau in France have likewise produced Björnson, Brandès, and\r\nStrindberg in Scandinavia, Maxim Gorky in Russia, Hermann Heijermanns in\r\nthe Netherlands, Gerhardt Hauptmann in Germany, Camille Lemonnier in\r\nBelgium, Gabriel d’Annunzio in Italy, and José Echegaray in the Biscayan\r\nPeninsula; and it is only by keeping well in mind the intensity and the\r\nscope of this world-movement of revolt that the dynamic value of French\r\nrevolt can be properly estimated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT IN POETRY, MUSIC AND ART\r\n\r\n   “_The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,\r\n   His insight and power encircle things of the human race, He is\r\n   the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human\r\n   race._”\r\n\r\n   WALT WHITMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Venez à moi, claquepatins,\r\n     Loqueteux, joueurs de musettes,\r\n     Clampins, loupeurs, voyous, catins,\r\n     Et marmousets et marmousettes,\r\n     Tas de traîne-cul-les housettes,\r\n     Race d’indépendants fougueux!\r\n     Je suis du pays dont vous êtes:\r\n     Le poète est le Roi des Gueux._\r\n\r\n   “_Vous que la bise des matins,\r\n     Que la pluie aux âpres sagettes,\r\n     Que les gendarmes, les mâtins,\r\n     Les coups, les fièvres, les disettes,\r\n     Prennent toujours pour amusettes,\r\n     Vous dont l’habit mince et fougueux\r\n     Paraît fait de vieilles gazettes,\r\n     Le poète est le Roi des Gueux._”\r\n\r\n     JEAN RICHEPIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Je voudrais dire à mes amis,\r\n     Sculpteurs d’idéal et de rimes,\r\n     Que s’enfermer n’est plus permis,\r\n     Lorsqu’au dehors grondent les crimes.\r\n     Chantons la justice et l’amour!\r\n     Le peuple va nous faire escorte.\r\n     Poète, descends de la tour!\r\n     Et puis ferme ta porte._”\r\n\r\n     MAURICE BOUKAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Persons of anarchistic mentality are signalised by their\r\n   love of the new in art and in science, by their feverish\r\n   search after new forms._”—A. HAMON.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_So it is you who are the poet. Well, as for me, I do not\r\n   like poets nor_ intellectuels. _I do not like them because\r\n   they are all more or less anarchists, and because the\r\n   anarchists blow up the bourgeois. I am neither a poet nor an_\r\n   intellectuel, _and I am proud of it._”\r\n\r\n   Monsieur Dupont, in La Petite Bohème of ARMAND CHARPENTIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nZola, being asked to define an anarchist, said, “_Un anarchiste, c’est\r\nun poète._” Conversely, the poet is more or less of an anarchist. Job\r\nand Isaiah are currently quoted by the _libertaires_ in support of their\r\nposition. Æschylus, in his immortal “_Prometheus_,” Euripides in his\r\n“_Bacchantes_,” Schiller, Shelley, Swinburne, Robert Burns, and Walt\r\nWhitman, in portions of their works, all promulgated good, sound\r\nanarchist doctrine. As to the poets who, without being specifically\r\nanarchistic, are revolutionists of one sort or another, their name is\r\nlegion. A bulky volume would scarcely suffice to name them.\r\n\r\nIn France, especially, revolutionary singers have never been lacking.\r\n“_Console-toi, gibet, tu sauveras la France!_” cried André Chénier,\r\ngreatest of the galaxy of poets who illustrated the Revolution.\r\nBéranger, before he was dazzled by the _épopée_ of Napoleon, had his\r\nmoments of revolt. The two Augustes of the Restoration, Barbier and\r\nBarthélemy, the first in his _Iambes_ and the second in his _Némésis_,\r\nglorified insurrection.\r\n\r\nHégésippe Moreau, who died in the _Hospice de la Charité_ at\r\ntwenty-eight, just as his _Myosotis_ was winning him recognition, heaped\r\nterrible imprecations upon the heads of the rich and powerful, and\r\nplayed a valiant part in the outbreak of 1830,\r\n\r\n   “_Non comme l’orateur du banquet populaire\r\n     Dont la flamme du punch attise la colère:\r\n     Comme un bouffon dans ses parades, non!\r\n     Mais les pieds dans le sang, en face du canon._”\r\n\r\n   “_Pour que son vers clément pardonne an genre humain,\r\n     Que faut-il au poète? Un baiser et du pain_,”\r\n\r\nsang Moreau in his beautiful “_Elégie à la Voulzie_,” which is recited\r\nin revolutionary meetings more often than any other poem. “He was\r\nhungry,” remarks Sainte-Beuve, apropos of Moreau’s vindictiveness, “and\r\nhe composed, in his hunger, songs that betrayed by their fierceness and\r\nbitterness the want within.”\r\n\r\nMoreau defends the excesses of the mobs of the Revolution:—\r\n\r\n   “_Oubliez-vous\r\n     Que leur âme de feu purifiait leurs œuvres?\r\n     Oui, d’un pied gigantesque écrasant les couleuvres\r\n     Par le fer et la flamme ils voulaient aplanir\r\n     Une route aux français vers un bel avenir.\r\n     Ils marchaient pleins de foi, pleins d’amour, et l’histoire\r\n     Absoudra, comme Dieu, qui sut aimer et croire._”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   _Au jour de la vengeance,\r\n   Si l’opprimé s’égare, il est absous d’avance._”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe predicts a general cataclysm, declares his intention of doing all in\r\nhis power to bring it on,—\r\n\r\n   “_J’ameuterai le peuple à mes vérités crues,\r\n     Je prophétiserai sur le trépied des rues,_”—\r\n\r\nand exults in the prospect,—\r\n\r\n   “_Et moi, j’applaudirai; ma jeunesse engourdie\r\n     Se réchauffera bien à ce grand incendie._”\r\n\r\nPierre Dupont (peer almost of Burns in his simple country songs), who\r\ndied disgraced by reason of his toadyism towards the government of the\r\nThird Napoleon, which had banished and then pardoned him, displayed a\r\nfine revolutionary fervour in 1848, before his banishment. His “_Chant\r\ndes Ouvriers_” and his poem—\r\n\r\n   “_On n’arrête pas le murmure\r\n     Du peuple quand il dit, j’ai faim,\r\n     Car c’est le cri de la Nature,\r\n     Il faut du pain, il faut du pain,_”\r\n\r\nwill be recited and sung by the people of France as long as there is\r\nsuch a thing as hunger within its borders.\r\n\r\nAt the same epoch, Alfred de Vigny distilled bitterness against society\r\nin his _Destinées_ and _Journal d’un Poète_; and Leconte de Lisle vented\r\nhis accumulated scorn as follows:—\r\n\r\n   “_Hommes, tueurs des Dieux, les temps ne sont pas loin\r\n     Où, sur un grand tas d’or, vautrés dans quelque coin,\r\n     Vous mourrez bêtement en emplissant vos poches!_”\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo’s _Châtiments_ (destined to become the favourite reading of\r\nCaserio, the assassin of Carnot) was the supreme cry of revolt of the\r\nSecond Empire. In such lines as these Hugo proclaimed the anarchist\r\nideal without, however, recognising it as such:—\r\n\r\n   “_Les temps heureux luiront, non pour la seule France,\r\n     Mais pour tous....\r\n     Les tyrans s’éteindront comme des météores....\r\n     Fêtes dans les cités, fêtes dans les campagnes!...\r\n     Où donc est l’échafaud? Ce monstre a disparu....\r\n     Plus de soldats l’épée au poing, plus de frontières,\r\n     Plus de fisc, plus de glaive ayant forme de croix....\r\n     Le saint labeur de tous se fond en harmonie....\r\n     Toute l’humanité dans sa splendide ampleur\r\n     Sent le don que lui fait le moindre travailleur....\r\n     Radieux avenir! Essor universel!\r\n     Epanouissement de l’homme sous le ciel!_”\r\n\r\nEugène Vermesch was the fiercest, though by no means the greatest, poet\r\nof the Commune. Laurent Tailhade and Jean Richepin, among the living,\r\nhave achieved renown as poets of revolt.\r\n\r\nRichepin[124] is as complete a nihilist of the open, rollicking,\r\ndevil-go-lucky order as Anatole France is of the subtle, Jehan\r\nRictus of the plaintive, and Zo d’Axa of the fantastic orders. Like\r\nthem, he commits himself to nothing and credits nothing, not even the\r\nfaiths and formulas of revolution; and, like them, he is nevertheless a\r\nformidable revolutionist.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to _Les Blasphèmes_ he proclaims his intention of\r\n“scandalising the devout, the Deists, the sceptics, the materialists,\r\nthe scientists, the worshippers of Reason, the prosperous and the\r\nunprosperous, in a word, the rout of fools and hypocrites who fancy it\r\ntheir duty to save Law, Property, the Family, Society, Morals, etc.” “In\r\nthe defence of these conventions, of which I do not recognise the\r\nbinding force,” he adds, “I shall hear all the geese of the Capital\r\nclack.”\r\n\r\nBook X. of _Les Blasphèmes_ is entitled “_Dernières Idoles_.” The\r\n“_dernières idoles_” are Nature, Reason, Progress. Richepin treats them\r\nin the most cavalier fashion:—\r\n\r\nNature:\r\n\r\n   “_Farce amère!_”\r\n\r\n   “_Carcasse qui n’a ni cœur, ni sang, ni lait!_”\r\n\r\n   “_Toi qui fais des vivants pour amuser la Mort, Ton ensemble\r\n   n’est rien qu’un mélange sans art._”\r\n\r\nReason:\r\n\r\n   “_Impudente drôlesse dont l’homme se croit le valet!_”\r\n\r\n   “_Coureuse de chimères, Faiseuse de vœux clandestins!_”\r\n\r\n   “_Reine fanfaronne, Servante du corps qui t’exhale!_”\r\n\r\nProgress:\r\n\r\n   “_Voici qu’un Dieu nouveau nous ronge: le Progrès._”\r\n\r\n   “_Le Progrès! Oui, grand fou, sous ce titre nouveau\r\n     C’est toujours Dieu qui vient te hanter le cerveau,\r\n     C’est toujours la stérile et dangereuse idée\r\n     Dont ton âme d’enfant fut jadis obsédée.\r\n     Sans le savoir tu crois encor._”\r\n\r\nIn another part of this volume he exalts, beginning with Satan himself,\r\nthe principal _révoltés_ of mythology and history. The following ringing\r\nstanzas are taken from “_Les Nomades_”:—\r\n\r\n   “_Oui, ce sont mes aïeux, à moi. Car j’ai beau vivre\r\n     En France, je ne suis ni Latin ni Gaulois.\r\n     J’ai les os fins, la peau jaune, des yeux de cuivre,\r\n     Un torse d’écuyer, et le mépris des lois.\r\n     Oui, je suis leur bâtard!_\r\n\r\n    _Leur sang bout dans mes veines,\r\n     Leur sang, qui m’a donné cet esprit mécréant,\r\n     Cet amour du grand air, et des courses lointaines,\r\n     L’Horreur de l’Idéal et la soif du Néant._”\r\n\r\nThe “_Marches Touraniennes_” conclude as follows:—\r\n\r\n   “_Plus de lois, de droits, plus rien!\r\n     Plus de vrai, de beau, de bien!\r\n         Ces Aryas!\r\n     Par le fer et par le feu,\r\n     Place au Néant, place au Dieu\r\n         Des Parias!_”\r\n\r\nFor his _Chansons des Gueux_, Richepin was fined five hundred francs\r\n(and costs) and kept in prison thirty days. In this volume he acclaims\r\nall the outlaws and outcasts, all the flotsam and jetsam of modern\r\ncivilisation in both country and town,—thieves, tramps, gypsies,\r\nbeggars, thugs, drunkards, foundlings, panders, and prostitutes; “the\r\nhalt, the maimed, the blind,” the reckless, the defiant, and the\r\nscoffing, the uncontrolled and the uncontrollable, with a vigour of\r\nlanguage, a genuineness of accent, a picturesqueness of phrase, an\r\naudacity in imagery and epithet, a poignancy of emotion, a naturalness,\r\na freshness, a breeziness, or rather a tempestuousness, that bespeak the\r\nmaster. He lays bare the thoughts and the passions of his disreputable\r\npersonages, portrays their starvation and their gluttonies, their\r\nenforced abstinences and their debaucheries, and makes them speak in\r\ntheir own weird tongues, sing their own ribald songs, and dance their\r\nown maddening dances. For lyric savagery and savage lyrism these\r\n_Chansons des Gueux_ have no counterpart, so far as I know, in modern\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n   “I love my heroes, my lamentable vagabonds,” wrote Richepin,\r\n   in an extraordinary preface.... “I love this something, I know\r\n   not what it is, which renders them beautiful, noble, this\r\n   wild-beast instinct which drives them into adventure,—a rash\r\n   and sinister instinct, granted, but an instinct characterised\r\n   by a fierce independence. Oh, the marvellous fable of La\r\n   Fontaine about the wolf and the dog! The errant wolf is mere\r\n   skin and bones. The dog is fat and sleek. Yes, but the chafed\r\n   neck, the collar! To be tied! ‘So you can’t run when you wish?\r\n   No? Good-bye, then, to your free meals. To the wood! To the\r\n   wood! Everything at the point of the sword!’ And Master Wolf\r\n   is off: he runs still. He runs still, and will always run,\r\n   this wolf, this tramp; and I love him for it. And every soul a\r\n   bit above the common will love likewise this voluntary pariah,\r\n   who may be repugnant, hideous, odious, abominable, but who has\r\n   greatness,—a superb greatness, since his whole being voices\r\n   the heroic war-cry of Tacitus: _Malo periculosam libertatem_.\r\n\r\n   “_Periculosam!_ my brave vagabonds! _Periculosam!_ do you\r\n   hear, you coddled worldlings, all of you who have your soup\r\n   and your kennel—and also your collar? Have I then committed a\r\n   great crime in revealing the brutal poetry of these\r\n   adventurers, of these braves, of these stubborn children to\r\n   whom society is almost always a stepmother, and who, finding\r\n   no milk in the breast of the unnatural nurse, bite the flesh\r\n   itself to calm their hunger?”\r\n\r\nLaurent Tailhade is a less natural and wholesome poet than Jean\r\nRichepin, perhaps, but he is certainly a more distinguished one. As a\r\nchiseller of poetic cameos and medallions, he has few, if any, superiors\r\namong his contemporaries. His _Vitraux_ and _Jardin des Rêves_ are\r\nparticularly relished by artists and littérateurs and by his\r\nbrother-poets.\r\n\r\nTailhade’s prose is as finely chiselled as his poetry. It is almost\r\ninvariably lyric; and—although he is caustic and cruel therein to the\r\nverge of cut-throatism, and although he has at his command the most\r\nextensive vocabulary of invective of any person in France, not excepting\r\nM. Henri Rochefort—it is always, like his poetry, distinguished. His\r\ncult for the classic French and Latin authors and his scrupulous care\r\nfor art save him from vulgarity and commonplaceness, even in his most\r\nquestionable literary undertakings and even in the simple diatribes\r\nwhich he contributes to the most insignificant, the least scholarly, and\r\nthe least artistic propagandist sheets. “He is a _lettré_,” says M.\r\nLedrain, conservator at the Louvre, “who knows admirably his Latin and\r\nhis Sixteenth Century, and who has formed thus a particularly savoury\r\nstyle which we all admire.”\r\n\r\nTailhade has unblenchingly defended nearly every anarchist attempt that\r\nhas occurred in Europe since he came to manhood. He characterised the\r\nassassination of Humbert by the Italian Bresci as “_un geste qui console\r\net qui revive nos espoirs_”; and Sophie Perowskaïa, Hartmann, Rysakoff,\r\nCaserio, Angiolillo, Henry, and Ravachol were all eulogised by him. He\r\nhas been prominently before the public on four occasions during the past\r\ndecade: at the time of the attempt of Vaillant, by reason of his\r\nstriking epigram, “_Qu’importe le reste, si le geste est beau_”; a\r\nlittle later, when he was himself the victim, at the _Restaurant Foyot_,\r\nof an anarchist—or anti-anarchist?—_beau geste_ which nearly cost him\r\nhis eyesight and permanently disfigured him; in the autumn of 1901, at\r\nthe time of the second visit of the czar, when he was tried and\r\nsentenced to a 1,000-franc fine and a year’s imprisonment for having\r\nreaffirmed “the venerable theory of regicide[125] which has traversed\r\nhistory” in a remarkable prose poem published by _Le Libertaire_, and\r\nentitled “_Le Triomphe de la Domesticité_”; and lastly, in 1903, when he\r\nwas mobbed in Brittany for his diatribes against the local clergy, on\r\nwhich occasion he rendered himself ludicrously guilty of inconsistency\r\nby appealing to the protection of the police.\r\n\r\nThe incriminated passage in “_Le Triomphe de la Domesticité_,” above\r\nreferred to, is as follows:—\r\n\r\n   “_Quoi, parmi ces soldats illégalement retenus pour veiller\r\n   sur la route où va passer la couardise impériale, parmi ces\r\n   gardes-barrières qui gagnent neuf francs tous les mois, parmi\r\n   les chemineaux, les mendiants, les trimardeurs, les outlaws,\r\n   ceux qui meurent de froid sous les ponts en hiver,\r\n   d’insolation en été, de faim toute la vie, il ne s’en trouvera\r\n   pas un pour prendre son fusil, son tissonnier, pour arracher\r\n   aux frênes des bois le gourdin préhistorique, et, montant sur\r\n   le marchepied des carrosses, pour frapper jusqu’à la mort,\r\n   pour frapper au visage, et pour frapper au cœur la canaille\r\n   triomphante, tsar, président, ministres, officiers, et les\r\n   clergés infames, tous les exploiteurs qui rient de sa misère,\r\n   vivent de sa moelle, courbent son échine, et le payent de\r\n   vains mots! La rue de la Ferronerie est-elle à jamais barrée?\r\n   La semence des héros est-elle inféconde pour toujours?_\r\n\r\n   “_Le sublime Louvel, Caserio, n’ont-ils plus d’héritiers? Les\r\n   tueurs de rois sont-ils morts à leur tour, ceux qui disaient\r\n   avec Jerôme Olgiati, l’exécuteur de Galéas Sforza, qu’un\r\n   trépas douloureux fait la renommée éternelle? Non! La\r\n   conscience humaine vit encore._”[126]\r\n\r\nAt the banquet offered him by sympathising littérateurs and artists\r\nimmediately after his trial, Tailhade proposed a toast which illustrates\r\ncapitally the scope of his emancipating ardour. It was:—\r\n\r\n“_A la Finlande! A la Sibérie! Aux Juifs Roumains! A l’Arménie! A la\r\nCatalogne! A la Sicile!_”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laurent Tailhade.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of his trial he expounded his attitude, as follows:—\r\n\r\n   “I know that I am on trial before you for excitation to\r\n   murder. As an author, it is my duty to express all my thought;\r\n   as an historian, it is my duty to discuss historic facts; as a\r\n   philosopher, I have the right to think and to deduce from\r\n   these facts the philosophical consequence which they warrant.\r\n   I have availed myself largely of what I consider my right. I\r\n   accept the entire responsibility of my acts. I even hold that\r\n   they do me honour. If to-morrow an occasion presented itself\r\n   for me to express again, in the interests of beauty, all my\r\n   thought, I should, before the general baseness, seize with\r\n   eagerness this fresh occasion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOVIS HUGUES]\r\n\r\nThe _raffiné_ De Goncourt was wont to dream of an infernal machine\r\n“_tuant la bêtise chic qui de quatre à six heures fait le tour du Bois\r\nde Boulogne_.” Similarly it is the Philistinism and vulgar fetichism of\r\nthe hour, its imbecility and ugliness, that particularly exasperate M.\r\nTailhade, this other _raffiné_, and set scintillating his scholarly and\r\nartistic ire. It was out of the depths of a profound disgust that he\r\ndrew his scorching volume, _Le Pays des Mufles_; and it is the æsthetic\r\noffences quite as much as the economic misdoings of the bourgeois that\r\nhe habitually lashes.\r\n\r\nSocialism likewise has its poets, of whom Clovis Hugues and Maurice\r\nBouchor (poets considerably inferior to Richepin and Tailhade) may be\r\nmentioned among the maturer men.\r\n\r\nClovis Hugues has as avocation, when the fortune of elections favours\r\nhim, the defence of socialistic principles in the Chamber of Deputies;\r\nand M. Bouchor gives a considerable portion of his time to acquainting\r\nworking people with the masterpieces of literature. “The æsthetic sense,\r\nwhich is the most elevated means of enjoyment, being dependent on the\r\nregular action of the other senses,” says Bouchor, “we need, if we would\r\nassure to all men a complete development, to demand plenty of material\r\ncomfort for every individual. We ought to realise for all humanity the\r\nidea of the old Latin adage,—_Mens sana in corpore sano_. Thus\r\nsocialism, which current prejudice interprets as a negation of art for\r\nart’s sake, is, on the contrary, the most direct route to it, and the\r\naffirmation of it.... We wish to raise the masses to the noblest\r\nartistic conceptions.... The people have a right to beauty, to science,\r\nto an unutilitarian culture of the mind, to whatever, in a word, can\r\nenlighten and ennoble it.”\r\n\r\nIn poetry the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of\r\nthought is a very intimate one. The search for fresh forms and the\r\nthinking of fresh thoughts are very apt to go together. Furthermore,\r\nthere would seem to be some subtle affinity between the releasing of\r\nverse from its fetters and the enfranchisement of humanity from its\r\nbondage. It would be puerile to lay any stress on the fact that both\r\nHenry and Vaillant wrote verses for the _revues des jeunes_, since this\r\nmay well have been a mere coincidence. But it is certain that the\r\nagitation for the _vers libre_ in France these latter years has been one\r\nof the manifestations of the prevalent revolutionary spirit.\r\n\r\nTrue, Verlaine and Mallarmé, though sufficiently revolutionary as\r\nregards form, were quite the reverse of revolutionary in their thinking;\r\nand plenty of similar instances might be cited. On the other hand, a\r\nlarge majority of the poets who have fought the battle for the\r\nrecognition of the rights of the _vers libre_ have been imbued, or at\r\nleast touched, with revolutionary ideas; and Verlaine, Mallarmé, and the\r\nother poets who remained loyal to the old society, all in discarding the\r\nold verse, were on terms of closest intimacy with the revolutionists,\r\nand were for a long time mainly encouraged (not to say “boomed”) by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAdolphe Retté and Gustave Kahn are unblushing anarchists. The former,\r\nwho has had in his time more than one misunderstanding with the law,\r\nsays of himself and his opinions: “I fenced, in the _revues_, against\r\nscholastics of every sort, maintaining that the artist (by the very fact\r\nof his being an artist) should translate his emotions by an individual\r\nrhythm, and not according to fixed forms.... I set myself to interrogate\r\nall the unfortunates whom I elbowed in this hell [the hospital], worse\r\nthan that of Dante.... It was shocking.... And I understood solidarity.\r\n\r\n   “Before entering the hospital, I was a theoretical anarchist.\r\n   On leaving it, I was the militant which I hope I have never\r\n   ceased to be. I deny and I revolt.”\r\n\r\nAll the members of the revolutionary _Endehors_ group were advocates of\r\nuntrammelled verse; and a goodly portion—among whom Pierre Quillard,\r\nFrancis Vielé-Griffin, and Henri de Regnier may be mentioned—were\r\nexponents of it.\r\n\r\nQuillard is now a militant anarchist at home, and has displayed on\r\nseveral occasions a chivalrous and more than platonic enthusiasm for\r\nemancipating movements abroad. Vielé-Griffin is mildly anarchistic. He\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n   “My æsthetic convictions, which are founded on the axiom, Art\r\n   is individualist and normal (that is to say, an artist worthy\r\n   of the name carries in his consciousness the necessary rules\r\n   of the expression for which he was born, and all dogmas are by\r\n   just so much detrimental to art), led me to consider whether\r\n   the anarchist doctrines might not have some connection with\r\n   these convictions. I am far from having elucidated all the\r\n   points which have occupied me up to this moment; but my\r\n   philosophy, essentially theistic, welcomes without effort a\r\n   sort of normal anarchism, which I am about to discover,\r\n   perhaps, in the divers anarchistic works I am consulting.”\r\n\r\nM. de Regnier, recognised in the most reputable quarters, has\r\npractically ceased his commerce with revolutionary spirits. But this\r\nfact does not in the least impair the significance of the other fact\r\nthat he found this commerce conducive, necessary even, to his proper\r\ndevelopment in the earlier stages of his career. Emile Verhaeren,\r\nGeorges Eekhoud, and several other Belgians whose art is intimately\r\nassociated with Paris are, or have been, poets of revolt.\r\n\r\nThe _Décadents_[127] and _Néo-Décadents_, _Symbolistes_ and\r\n_Néo-Symbolistes_, _Instrumentistes_, _Déliquescents_, and\r\n_Brutalistes_,[128] most of the sets of poets, in fact, who have made a\r\nstir in the French world of letters since the disappearance—as a\r\ncoterie—of the _Parnassiens_, have included many revolutionists, mostly\r\nof anarchistic bent, protesters as well against the oppressions of\r\npolitics and the conventions of society as against the obsession of\r\nstereotyped poetic forms.[129]\r\n\r\n   “The greater part,” writes one of their number, “flaunted\r\n   proudly their disdain of current prejudices, current morals,\r\n   and current institutions.... Some attacked property, religion,\r\n   family; others ridiculed marriage and extolled _l’union\r\n   libre_; others vaunted the blessings of cosmopolitanism and of\r\n   universal association.... With some, it is true, the\r\n   antagonism was only apparent,—simple love of paradox,\r\n   inordinate desire to get themselves talked about by uttering\r\n   eccentric phrases. But this state of mind existed. If all did\r\n   not detest sincerely our bourgeois society, each one lashed it\r\n   with violent diatribes, each one had a vague intuition of\r\n   something better.”\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason therefor may be,—emotional temperament, weariness\r\nwith physical privation, bitterness of unrecognised talent, disgust\r\nwith the ugliness of modern commercialism and industrialism, the subtle\r\nconnection between freedom of thought and freedom of form (noted in the\r\ndiscussion of poetry), or all these things combined,—it is safe to\r\nventure the assertion that there are, and long have been, in France more\r\nrevolutionists of various stripes among the artists than among any other\r\nclass of the community engaged in liberal pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe great Courbet—to go no farther back—was a disciple of Proudhon.\r\n“_Il avait_,” to use the picturesque phrase of Jules Vallès, “_du\r\ncharbon dans le crâne_.” The story of Courbet’s career of\r\nrevolt—largely mingled with sheer legend, it is true, but even so\r\nscarcely more extraordinary than the reality—is world property. Courbet\r\nsuffered imprisonment for his opinions, and had his pictures and\r\nhousehold effects sold by the state.\r\n\r\nCazin, mildest of painters, was so involved in the Commune that he was\r\nforced to take refuge in London, where he supported himself by making\r\nartistic earthen jars. Eugène Carrière, whose simple, original,\r\neminently human art is slowly conquering two hemispheres, is an\r\noutspoken antagonist of society as it is.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to say whether a majority of the Impressionists\r\nhold (apart from their art, which has proved profoundly revolutionary)\r\nrevolutionary views. It is currently known, however, that Pissarro,\r\nCézanne, and Delattre hold, or did hold, such views; and the more\r\nprominent Neo-Impressionists have anarchistic leanings almost to a man.\r\nAs to the social attitude of Maximilien Luce, Ibels, Paul Signac,\r\nPissarro _fils_, Félix Vallotton, Francis Jourdain (present managing\r\neditor of _Le Libertaire_), and Van Rysselberghe, for example, there is\r\nno possibility of dispute.\r\n\r\nLuce is the most typical living instance of the artist who is, as was\r\nCourbet, at once a striking figure in the art world and an influential\r\npersonality in the revolutionary groups. Born and brought up in a\r\nworking faubourg, which he still inhabits, Luce has an affection as\r\ngenuine as it is ardent for the common people; and he has rendered, with\r\ndisagreeable mannerisms and technical lapses, perhaps, but with truth,\r\noriginality, robustness, and intensity notwithstanding, two classes of\r\nsubjects which really make one,—the street and working life of Paris\r\nand the life of the lurid mining and smelting regions of Belgium and the\r\nnorth of France.\r\n\r\n   “Landscapist before everything,” says Emile Verhaeren, “Luce\r\n   remains faithful to the tendency to sink in nature the immense\r\n   strivings of human beings. The surroundings of men determine\r\n   their existence and their history. In seeing these monumental\r\n   and sinister chimneys and scaffoldings under the moon, these\r\n   smoke-clouds which move towards the horizon like hordes, these\r\n   fires which tear the night and seem to bleed like flesh, we\r\n   think of the tortured humanity of which they express the\r\n   suffering. Tracts of desolation and of tragic pangs, miseries\r\n   kindled in space, mad vortexes of matter roundabout the\r\n   voluntary activity which violates it, which subjugates it, and\r\n   which it opposes,—all anguish and all fear are unveiled.”\r\n\r\nPaul Signac, after Luce and Seurat (deceased) the best known of the\r\n_Néo-Impressionistes_, enumerates as follows the influences which have\r\nled him to identify himself with anarchism:—\r\n\r\n  “I. The laws of physiology—the rights of the stomach, of the\r\n  brain, of the eyes.\r\n\r\n  “II. Logic.\r\n\r\n  “III. Uprightness.\r\n\r\n  “IV. The sufferings of my fellows.\r\n\r\n  “V. The need of seeing happy people about me.”\r\n\r\nIt is certain that there are more revolutionary personalities in the\r\nseceding “_Champ de Mars_” than in the old, and so-called Official,\r\n_Salon_; and the various coteries of aggressive and often eccentric\r\ninnovators, who hold themselves aloof from or are held aloof by these\r\ntwo salons,—coteries which correspond vaguely to the coteries of the\r\n_jeunes poètes_,—display, for the most part, pronounced revolutionary\r\naffinities. The _Salon des Indépendants_, whose motto is, “Neither\r\njuries nor awards,” and whose object is “to enable artists to present\r\ntheir works freely to the judgment of the public, without any outside\r\nintervention whatsoever,” has been from the beginning an anarchistic\r\nsalon in every sense of the term,—an exhibition by revolutionary\r\nartists as well as an exhibition of revolutionary art. One has only to\r\ncompare the names of its exhibitors with the names of those who have\r\nco-operated in the pictorial propaganda of the anarchist organ _Les\r\nTemps Nouveaux_, to be convinced of it.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary that an Edwin Markham should write a “Man with a\r\nHoe” for the world to recognise that the art of Millet—whether Millet\r\nso intended it or not—has a social significance. There are many living\r\npainters, about whose social attitude the public at large knows little\r\nor nothing, who, like Millet (if in less degree), feel and express so\r\nwell, when they will, the benumbing influence of poverty, the hardness\r\nof the toil, or the meagreness of the joys of peasants and town\r\nlabourers, that this expression is an indirect plea—no less eloquent\r\nthan the most direct plea—for a redress of social wrongs.\r\n\r\nSuch, to name only a fraction of those who might be mentioned, are\r\nBesson, Buland, Leclerc, Sabatté, Léon L’Hermitte, Cottet, Dauchez, Jean\r\nVeber, Zwiller, Geffroy, Boggio, Prunier, Raffaelli, Luigi Loir, Mlle.\r\nDelasalle, Aublet, and Lubin de Beauvais.\r\n\r\nJules Adler, more positive, has given pictorial expression to the most\r\nviolent impulses of the mob and the sweeping demands of labour; and\r\nConstantin Meunier[130] has painted, like Luce, the black and bristling\r\nregion of the furnaces and the mines described by Zola in _Germinal_.\r\n\r\nAuguste Rodin, symbolic and synthetic, surely the greatest innovator in\r\nsculpture and probably the greatest sculptor of the century just closed,\r\nhas been subjected throughout his career to a systematic official and\r\nacademic opposition and persecution, which have not, so far as I know,\r\nmade a revolutionist of him, but which have made him a very god in the\r\neyes of all the revolutionary elements, and which would have produced\r\nthe same effect, perhaps, had his art been far less convincing and\r\ncolossal than it is.\r\n\r\nConstantin Meunier,[131] also an innovator, and second in merit to Rodin\r\nalone according to many, is the sculptor _par excellence_ of the “fourth\r\nestate.” The grim and tragic poetry of labour has been interpreted by\r\nhim as it had never been interpreted before in marble and bronze. The\r\nspecial physique, the attitudes and the gestures, of all the overworked\r\nminers, puddlers, fishermen, and peasants,—their dignity and their\r\npain, their capacity for endurance and resentment, their thirst for\r\nresistance,—have in him a superbly realistic and a compassionate,\r\nloving, high-minded, almost spiritual exponent. Righteous indignation\r\nagainst the present order of things underlies Meunier’s work. Indeed, he\r\nmakes no secret of his Utopian desires.\r\n\r\nBoth Meunier and Rodin have elaborated projects for a monument to the\r\nglorification of labour, which are enthusiastically praised by the\r\nchampions of social revolt.\r\n\r\nJules Dalou[131] was banished, like Cazin, for his participation in the\r\nCommune, and was the sculptor of the monuments to the revolutionists\r\nBlanqui and Victor Noir. Baffier is an avowed revolutionist, who affects\r\nthe name of artisan and the artisan’s garb.\r\n\r\nMicheline, the good angel of Emile Veyrin’s drama _La Pâque Socialiste_,\r\nsays: “Jesus of Nazareth, called the Christ, remained nailed to a cross\r\nsix hours. Humanity is on a cross of suffering. Humanity, the great\r\ncrucified, will release itself.” When she is asked whence she draws her\r\nhope, she replies, lifting her eyes to the cross, “From the gospel.”\r\nFurthermore, she distributes the bread of a new covenant to a band of\r\nweavers at a symbolic feast, patterned after the Last Supper. It is at\r\nthe foot of a _Calvaire_ that the anarchist Jean Roule, of Mirbeau’s\r\n_Mauvais Bergers_, harangues the multitude of striking workmen, who are\r\nfor the moment furious against him because he has refused to accept, in\r\nbehalf of the strikers, a strike fund offered by certain professional\r\nlabour leaders, who intend to utilise the strike for their own selfish\r\nends; and it is by pointing to the cross—“this cross where for two\r\nthousand years, under the weight of miserable hatreds, He agonises who,\r\nthe first, dared to speak to men of liberty and love”—that his\r\ncompanion Madeleine, fearing for his life, transforms their fury into\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe Montmartre monologist Jehan Rictus, in “_Le Revenant_”[132] and\r\nother of his poems, has presented the Christ as a modern city vagrant\r\nsuffering the buffets of modern society.\r\n\r\nThis fashion of bringing the Christian story up to date by introducing\r\nthe Christ into the life of the period has invaded painting as well as\r\npoetry and the drama. Practised by Dagnan-Bouveret from motives solely\r\nartistic,[133] by Léon L’Hermitte, Pierre Lagarde, and a number of\r\nothers from motives partly artistic and partly humanitarian, by the\r\n_mondain_ Jean Béraud (_Chemin de la Croix_, _Descente de la Croix_, _La\r\nMadeleine chez le Pharisien_, and _Le Christ Lié à la Colonne_) out of\r\nwhat seems to be sheer sensationalism, and by the decorators of the\r\n_cabarets artistiques et littéraires_ of Montmartre, half out of a\r\nbravado which those who cannot distinguish between religion and the\r\nchurch misname blasphemy and half out of class hatred, it has also been\r\npractised with unalloyed reverence and conviction by a number of\r\npainters as a direct and undisguised form of revolutionary propaganda.\r\nThese last, perceiving that Christ, in the person of his unfortunate\r\nchildren, is mocked, spit upon, and crucified every day, and that a\r\nMagdalen is treated with no more consideration by the scribes and\r\nPharisees of the twentieth century than by the scribes and Pharisees of\r\nthe first century, have given us Christs watching by the sick-beds of\r\n_cocottes_; Christs in corduroys and sabots, fraternising with peasants;\r\nChrists in the garb of the Paris labourer, exhorting in wine-shops and\r\nanarchist meetings; tatterdemalion Christs, pleading vainly for alms in\r\ncity streets and along the country roads; peace-proclaiming Christs,\r\njeered at and pommelled by militarist mobs; and vagabond Christs,\r\n“without legal domiciles,” brutalised by the police and hauled into the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nIt is among the “_dessinateurs_,”[134] however, that the tendency to\r\nutilise the Christ for purposes of revolutionary propaganda is the most\r\nin evidence. Indeed, it is among the _dessinateurs_ (who are often\r\npainters likewise) that the spirit of revolt all along the line is the\r\nmost pronounced.\r\n\r\nAn average Parisian, if asked to name the _dessinateurs_ most in the\r\npublic view, will cite for you Forain, Caran d’Ache, Léandre, Guillaume,\r\nCappiello, Sem, Abel Faivre, Steinlen, Willette, and Hermann-Paul.\r\n\r\nSem portrays relentlessly the rottenness of society, but draws no\r\nconclusions therefrom; Cappiello has no social significance, whatever\r\nhis artistic significance may be; and Guillaume, who produces\r\ncaptivating _demi-mondaines_ by the yard, has little more social\r\nsignificance, although as illustrator he has cleverly seconded\r\nCourtéline in poking good-natured fun at the army.\r\n\r\nCaran d’Ache gives himself by preference to gleeful satire of the\r\nfollies, frailties, and foibles of the time; but he can be tragic and\r\nredoubtable, when he chooses, in the denunciation of its injustices and\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\nAbel Faivre, who is very much the sort of a caricaturist one fancies\r\nRubens might have been, had Rubens taken to caricature, is slowly, but\r\nsurely, justifying his seemingly gratuitous grossness by evidences of an\r\nuncommon insight into human nature and of a far-reaching philosophical\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nLéandre, charming, canny, and critical, easily first of living\r\nportrait-caricaturists, amuses himself and his constituency hugely with\r\nthe imbecilities, vanities, and idiosyncrasies of public men,\r\nparticularly of parliamentarians. He was one of the illustrators of the\r\n_Feuilles de Zo d’Axa_, and contributes irregularly to the\r\nanti-bourgeois sheets, but does not appear to be an unequivocal social\r\nrevolutionist.\r\n\r\nForain, a consummate synthesiser, who can express more with a minimum of\r\nstrokes than any Frenchman living, at the beginning of his career was a\r\nfierce exposer of the emptiness and crookedness of politicians,\r\nfinanciers, and swells, and a convincing pleader for justice to the\r\noppressed. His sympathies have gone out to the people more rarely since.\r\nWith prosperity he has become something of a swell himself, but he still\r\nelectrifies Paris now and then with a drawing whose poignancy shows\r\nplainly that his heart has not shifted its position. Crueler than\r\nLéandre,—cruelest, in fact, of all the men of his profession,—he is\r\nmore dreaded by the politicians than any other artist in Paris. As a\r\npartisan of anti-Semitism, Forain has latterly directed most of his\r\npolitical caricatures against those whom he considers, rightly or\r\nwrongly, to be the tools of the Jews.\r\n\r\nHermann-Paul, Steinlen, and Willette[135] are out-and-out social\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\nHermann-Paul provides all the illustrations for _L’Officiel_, which\r\n“does not pretend,” says its editor Franc-Nohain, “to be funnier than\r\nthe _Journal Officiel_ of the French Republic.” He was an illustrator of\r\nthe _Feuilles de Zo d’Axa_, and has participated in the pictorial\r\npropaganda of _Les Temps Nouveaux_. He was one of the fiercest attackers\r\nof the army during the Dreyfus affair, and his specialty—if a man of\r\nsuch a wide range of antipathies as he may be said to have a\r\nspecialty—is the exposure of the horrors of war. The military\r\natrocities which have been perpetrated during the last few years, and\r\nwhich are still being perpetrated in various quarters of the globe, have\r\nin him an ungullible and indefatigable antagonist.\r\n\r\nWillette’s grace is proverbial. In his lighter moods he is, with a large\r\nallowance of course, a sort of modern Boucher or Watteau. He is prodigal\r\nto the last degree of dainty nymphs and goddesses and all manner of\r\ndelicate nudities, of playful elves, sprites, and cupids, of swans and\r\ndoves, of naïve _porcelaine-de-Saxe_ shepherdesses, irresponsible fauns\r\nand wily satyrs, of lamb-like gambols, young loves, and spring-time\r\nsettings; while his pale Pierrots and Pierrettes, disporting by the\r\nlight of the moon or pensively rhyming and serenading, are strangely\r\ninsinuating and enticing. His Parisian types—at once real and\r\nunreal—are equally captivating. Willette takes a mischievous delight in\r\nsurrounding them with piquant, pagan genii, by way of symbols; and, even\r\nwhen he leaves them quite alone, they belong less to the Paris of the\r\nday and the hour, with all their saucy modernity, than to the realm of\r\nfantasy. Nevertheless, he can be bitter, vindictive, terrible. No one of\r\nhis contemporaries, except Forain, can be so awful; and no one, not even\r\nForain, has so often frightened the bourgeois out of their bourgeois\r\nwits. A few of his fiercer cartoons deserve notice here:—\r\n\r\nA starving miner holds a bloated employer at the mercy of his pick, in\r\nthe bottom of a mine-shaft, and claims his vengeance.\r\n\r\nA wild-eyed figure, symbolising the proletariat, brandishes a knife\r\ntragically, and cries, “_Je voudrais que la société n’eût qu’une seule\r\ntête pour la lui couper d’un seul coup_.”\r\n\r\nA nude woman, at once voluptuous and august, enthroned before a\r\nguillotine, proclaims,—\r\n\r\n   “_Je suis la Sainte Démocratie,\r\n     J’attends mes amants._”\r\n\r\n_Pour la Prochaine Exposition_: A _sans-culotte_, saucily puffing a\r\ncigarette, displays a guillotine of the most approved pattern, with this\r\ncomment, “_Et elle sera à vapeur, mon bourgeois!_”\r\n\r\n_Marquis Talons-Rouges_: De Gallifet, “the butcher of the Commune,”\r\nstands transfixed with terror while the massacred rise up against him\r\nfrom under the paving-stones.\r\n\r\n_Vendredi Saint_: M. Bérenger,[136] attired as a Protestant clergyman,\r\nglowers at the Magdalen, who is weeping over the Crucified One, and\r\nsays, “_Si j’avais été de ces temps, il n’y aurait pas eu de scandale au\r\npied de la croix_.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Willette is not tenderer with his bewitching\r\ndreamland lovers than he is with the abused and the oppressed.\r\n\r\nHe has contributed to nearly all the illustrated organs of revolt,\r\nbeginning with the _Père Peinard_, and at one time made all the\r\nillustrations for a most impertinent little sheet, known as _Le Pied de\r\nNez_, the text for which was furnished by Camille St. Croix. His\r\nstained-glass window at the _Chat Noir_, representing the worship of the\r\ngolden calf and bearing the inscription “_Te Deum Laudamus_,” will be\r\nremembered as long as the _Chat Noir_ itself.\r\n\r\nSteinlen’s[137] work is big,—big for its humanity and big for its art;\r\nbig by reason of its realism and by reason of its idealism; big in\r\nextent, intent, and content. His compositions possess all the essential\r\nqualities of great pictures; and, if it is ever permitted to class a\r\nsimple _dessinateur_ with the masters, Steinlen must surely be ranked as\r\none of the few great artists of his time.\r\n\r\nIn Steinlen we have all the social types that the _chansonnier_ Bruant\r\nand the monologist Jehan Rictus have made vivid by their poetry, and a\r\ngreat many more besides; all the social types that the painters of the\r\nhumble—L’Hermitte, Raffaelli, Sabatté, and Besson—have endeared to us\r\non canvas, and a great many more besides: _maquereaux_ and their white\r\nslaves, the _filles du trottoir_; criminals, child-martyrs, country and\r\ncity vagabonds, and parasitic squatters on vacant city lots;\r\ncoster-mongers and street musicians; little dressmakers and milliners\r\ntripping jauntily down the slopes of Montmartre and Belleville;\r\nlaundresses pounding and gossiping in the wash-houses or wearily\r\ntraversing the streets, with heavy baskets of clothes on their arms;\r\nBohemian poets and artists fighting poverty in their humble _ménages_ or\r\njunketing with their mistresses and models; over-dressed _filles de\r\njoie_ awaiting, Danaë-like, in cafés and night restaurants, the descent\r\nof the golden shower; unsophisticated or hungry working-girls falling\r\ninto the traps set by the mistresses of the public houses, and country\r\nmaidens succumbing to the glitter of the soldier’s coat; toiling\r\npeasants, stupid, stolid, and patient; labourers and mechanics at their\r\nwork, at their noon-day luncheons, and, in the wine-shops after their\r\nworking hours, under the spell of prating politicians; miners grovelling\r\nin the murk or marching, pale, starving, and ominous, as strikers, to\r\nthe assertion of their rights and the redress of their wrongs. The\r\npainter Luce and the sculptor Meunier are, perhaps, the only artists who\r\nhave displayed continuously, during a series of years, an equal\r\ncomprehension of the suffering, the yearning, and the revolt of the\r\nmasses; and Meunier’s field of observation is scarcely as broad as\r\nSteinlen’s, while Luce’s technical skill is inferior to his. Steinlen\r\nhas climbed by the ladder of a marvellous intuition into the very soul\r\nof the proletariat, and his superb gift of expression enables him to\r\nbear completest witness to all that he has therein felt and seen.\r\n\r\nA mighty sadness permeates his work.\r\n\r\nSteinlen’s best-known drawings have appeared in _Le Père Peinard_, _Le\r\nChambard_, _Le Mirliton_, _La Lanterne_, the anarchist child’s paper\r\n_Jean-Pierre_, _Les Feuilles de Zo d’Axa_, _Le Canard Sauvage_, _Le\r\nSifflet_, and _Le Gil Blas Illustré_, to which last he contributed a\r\nfirst page, weekly, for a number of years. He has illustrated two\r\nvolumes of the _Chansons_ of Bruant (_Dans la Rue_) and Maurice Boukay’s\r\n_Chansons Rouges_. Several of his posters, notably that of the socialist\r\ndaily, _Le Petit Sou_, breathe a fierce revolutionary spirit.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor _dessinateurs_—minor not necessarily in talent, but in\r\nvogue—are the revolutionists Luce, Francis Jourdain, Vallotton,\r\nPissarro _fils_, Signac, Rysselberghe, and Ibels, already noticed as\r\npainters. Roubille, G. Maurin, Jehannet, Guillaume, Barbottin,\r\nAnquetin, Cross, Mab, Mabel, Lebasque, Delannoy, Comin-Ache, Chevalier,\r\nDaumont, Alexandre Charpentier, Heidbrinck, Camille Lefèvre, and J.\r\nHenault have been identified with the propaganda by art of _Les Temps\r\nNouveaux_. Couturier[138] has an intimate connection with the other\r\nanarchist organ, _Le Libertaire_. Jean Grave’s primer of anarchy, _Les\r\nAventures de Nono_, was illustrated by Charpentier, Heidbrinck,\r\nHermann-Paul, Camille Lefèvre, Luce, Mab, Rysselberghe, and Pissarro\r\n_fils_. Grandjouan, Léal de Camara, Arthur Michaël, Jossot, Dubuc,\r\nBalluriau, Gottlob, Noël Dorville, Jouve, Kupka, Weiluc, Louis Morin,\r\nBraun, Borgex, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cadel, Darbour, Roedel, Redon, and Grün\r\nare all strongly revolutionary in portions of their work.\r\n\r\n_Le Rire_, _Le Sourire_, _Le Cri de Paris_, _Le Gil Blas Illustré_, and\r\nnearly a score of illustrated sheets, whose existence is likely to be so\r\nephemeral that their enumeration would be idle, allow a modicum of space\r\nto refractory productions by these _dessinateurs_; and in the spring of\r\n1901 an illustrated publication was founded, which is devoted\r\nexclusively to full-page drawings of an anti-capitalistic,\r\nanti-governmental character. This publication, which is called\r\n_L’Assiette au Beurre_,[139] is as fierce in its way as was the\r\nsuppressed _Père Peinard_. Several of its numbers have been seized; but\r\nit has so far escaped complete suppression,—mainly, it is likely, by\r\nreason of an entire absence of reading-matter, it being far more\r\ndifficult for the courts to define the offence contained in an\r\ninflammatory drawing than the offence contained in an inflammatory text.\r\nThe prospectus of _L’Assiette au Beurre_ thus explains its aim: “We have\r\narrived at a turning-point in history, where it becomes necessary for a\r\npublication which addresses itself to thinkers and artists to face the\r\nsocial question under its most diverse aspects. Now is it not a duty to\r\ncombat by art the possessors of the _assiette au beurre_ and all social\r\niniquities? And how can it be done better than by the pictorial\r\npresentation which fixes an idea in the brain with an energy to which\r\nthe effort of the most puissant writer cannot attain?”\r\n\r\nPractically all the _dessinateurs_ heretofore mentioned have appeared\r\nwith greater or less frequency in _L’Assiette au Beurre_; and it has\r\npublished many special issues, of twenty-four pages or more, devoted\r\nexclusively to a single artist. Thus Braun, Grandjouan, Roubille,\r\nMichaël, Dubuc, Jean Veber, Willette, Van Dongen, Gottlob, Noël\r\nDorville, Heidbrinck, Jouve, Lucien Métivet, Ibels, Guillaume, Caran\r\nd’Ache, Kupka, Weiluc, Xavier, José, Minartz, Jacques Villon, Vallotton,\r\nSancha, Pezilla, Louis Morin, Doës, and Abel Faivre have had, each, at\r\nleast one number, and Hermann-Paul, Steinlen, Léal de Camara, Jossot,\r\nand Balluriau several numbers, each, consecrated to their works. No\r\nother existing journal of caricature has made so comprehensive an\r\nartistic effort;[140] and it is at least a curious commentary—not to\r\ninsist farther—on the social attitude of the artistic _élite_ that no\r\nother journal of caricature is so unequivocally revolutionary in tone.\r\n\r\nDaumier, the father of modern French caricature and the greatest of\r\nFrench caricaturists, was scarcely tenderer in his drawings to the\r\nexploiters of the poor, to bourgeois stupidity and sham, and to courts,\r\nlawyers, and politicians, than are the Mirbeaus, Tailhades, Jean Graves,\r\nand Kropotkines in their writings; and in this respect (ignoring, of\r\ncourse, the question of talent) he is closely resembled by a majority of\r\nhis successors. To be sure, it is easy to attach too much weight to this\r\nfact. The caricaturist, like many another fellow who has to get his\r\nliving by his wits, does not invariably make it a point to express his\r\nown convictions. The caricaturist, furthermore, could not consistently\r\naccept a Utopia if he succeeded in ushering one in, since in Utopia he\r\nwould have no excuse for being. “Caricature is, in the nature of the\r\ncase, of the opposition.” But it is one thing to be of the\r\nopposition—that is, to assail the political element in power—and quite\r\nanother thing to demolish the state itself and all the institutions of\r\nsociety. And it is this latter thing that the great body of contemporary\r\nFrench caricaturists are attempting to do.\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw in a little book of almost diabolical cleverness, _The\r\nPerfect Wagnerite_, has advanced the rather startling theory that no one\r\ncan comprehend the Wagner music-dramas who is not something of an\r\nanarchist.\r\n\r\nWhatever one may think of Bernard Shaw in general, of Bernard Shaw as a\r\nmusical critic in particular, and, still more in particular, of Bernard\r\nShaw as a Wagner interpreter, one must admit that there is always a\r\nhalf-truth, at least, lurking somewhere about his Sibylline epigrams and\r\nparadoxes. There is no questioning the fact that Wagner, the transformer\r\nof music, was a professor of revolutionary doctrines, and that he\r\nincorporated, deliberately or otherwise, the essence of these\r\nrevolutionary doctrines into his work. “During three years,” in the\r\nearly part of his career, “he kept pouring forth pamphlets on social\r\nevolution, religion, life, art, and the influence of riches”; and one of\r\nthese pamphlets, _Art and Revolution_, is esteemed an anarchist\r\ntext-book by anarchists in all parts of the world. “What man,” he says,\r\n“can, with lightness of heart and calm senses, plunge his regard to the\r\nbottom of this world of murder and rapine, organised and legalised by\r\ndeceit, imposture, and hypocrisy, without being obliged to avert his\r\neyes with a shudder of disgust?” Wagner resigned in 1849 his position as\r\nconductor of the opera at Dresden in order to become “a leader of the\r\npeople in the revolution then under way.” He appealed to the king of\r\nSaxony “to espouse the people’s cause, and then threw in his lot with\r\nthe people.” He was publicly proclaimed “a politically dangerous person\r\nalong with Bakounine and Roeckel,”—the same Bakounine who is held the\r\nfather of modern anarchism.\r\n\r\nIn France, as in Germany, the tendency of music during the last fifty\r\nyears has been towards a greater and greater liberty of form; and most\r\nof the notable contemporary French composers—with the exception of\r\nReyer, Saint-Saëns, and Massenet[141] (who represent, with\r\nmodifications, the classic tradition), and two or three ardent disciples\r\nof Gluck—proceed, more or less directly, either from Wagner or from\r\nthat other innovator, Hector Berlioz (sometimes called the French\r\nWagner), who was not, it is true, a revolutionist in the political\r\nsense, but who was bitter to the last degree against the society that\r\nstupidly refused to acknowledge his power.\r\n\r\nThe writer is not enough of a musical connoisseur to trace the\r\ntransformations wrought in musical forms by French composers since the\r\ntime of Berlioz,—by César Franck (who in a sense, however, stood apart\r\nfrom the currents), by Pierre Lalo, Isidore de Lara, Emmanuel Chabrier,\r\nVincent d’Indy, Camille Erlanger, DeBussy, Gabriel Fauré, Leroux, Le\r\nBorne, Bourgault-Ducoudray, Gustave Charpentier, and Alfred Bruneau;\r\nstill less to point out where these changes have been co-ordinated, as\r\nthey were in Wagner, with revolutionary thinking,—a task for which not\r\nonly musical connoisseurship, but the temperament of a musician, the\r\nknowledge of an adept, and the intellect of a philosopher would be\r\nrequired. But in two of the composers just named, Alfred Bruneau and\r\nGustave Charpentier, the co-ordination is so obvious that “he who runs”\r\n(he of the average lay intelligence) “may read,” since they are engaged\r\nin disseminating the idea of liberty among the people.\r\n\r\nBoth have been influenced by Wagner, but both depart from Wagner in\r\ntaking their subjects, not from legends, but from contemporary life, and\r\nthe most ordinary every-day sort of life at that.\r\n\r\nBruneau claims as large privileges for the composer of opera as are\r\naccorded to the author, the painter, and the dramatist; the same\r\nopenness to passion, movement, and humanity, and the same range of\r\nchoice as regards characters, language, and setting. “It is the right of\r\nthe composer”—I quote from Bruneau’s _Musique d’Hier et de Demain_—“to\r\nunite in a piece of his choosing any beings he pleases, to place these\r\nbeings in the human _milieu_ to which he considers they belong, and to\r\nput in their mouths the words which he considers appropriate.... He must\r\ninsist on liberty of the dialogue, developing itself, without constraint\r\nof any sort, upon the woof of the instrumentation, and forming one body\r\nwith it; liberty of the symphony, never interrupted, trumpeting,\r\nrumbling, swelling, subsiding, with the necessities of the drama;\r\nliberty of expression, more important still,—justness in the word and\r\nprecision in the term; liberty unlimited of the melody, tripping, alert,\r\ngrave, proud, tender, vigorous, joyous, surely, at being able to escape\r\nfrom the imprisonment of the cadence and the rhyme; liberty of the\r\nphrase, liberty of inspiration, liberty of art, liberty of form, liberty\r\ncomplete, magnificent, and definitive!”\r\n\r\nIn _Messidor_[142] and _L’Attaque du Moulin_ (prose librettos by Emile\r\nZola) Bruneau deals with strikes and the labour question so frankly that\r\nit is not a little surprising that they were allowed a place on a\r\nnational stage. These works are appreciated by the critics, but have not\r\nbeen, in spite of their popular subjects, signal popular successes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Charpentier’s opera of _Louise_ (produced at the\r\n_Opéra Comique_ in 1899, and not yet banished from a prominent place in\r\nthe répertoire) has rapidly made the tour of France and of Europe.\r\n_Louise_, which treats with a bizarre blending of realism and idealism\r\nthe life of the Bohemians and labourers of Montmartre, may be said to\r\nmark an epoch in opera, in that it is the first work of the French\r\nschool which, having combined innovation of musical form with innovation\r\nof subject and language, has achieved a striking and permanent artistic\r\nand popular success.\r\n\r\nWith _Louise_ the modern music-drama becomes, like the simple drama, an\r\nappreciable force in direct revolutionary propaganda. It is true that\r\neverything savouring of politics is scrupulously excluded from the\r\nlibretto of _Louise_, but this scrupulousness (absolutely indispensable\r\nin a piece prepared for a subsidised stage) does not prevent the opera\r\nfrom being an unmistakable protest against the social tyranny which is\r\nintrenched in the texts of the law. Indeed, Charpentier, whose fine\r\nsocial fervour has been evidenced in a variety of ways which may not be\r\ngone into here, has publicly proclaimed his belief “in the efficacy of\r\nrevolutions well prepared.”\r\n\r\nIt is more than a coincidence that the revolutionary Zola should have\r\nbeen a zealous defender of the art of Courbet, of Manet, of Monet,\r\nPissarro, and Cézanne, and that a pronounced anarchist like Octave\r\nMirbeau should have been an early admirer of Wagner, the introducer to\r\nFrance of Maeterlinck, the chief champion of Monet, and an apotheosiser\r\nof Rodin,—should have been, in short, the foster-father of the\r\n_irréguliers_ in every department of art. He would be a surpassingly\r\nsubtle analyser and a masterful synthesiser who could establish the\r\nconnection between polyphonic orchestration, impressionism in painting\r\nand sculpture and the _vers libre_, and between each and all of these\r\nand the anarchistic philosophy,—between revolt against academicism in\r\nthe arts and revolt against the state; and yet no one who observes ever\r\nso little can doubt that the connection exists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paris from Montmartre]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTO WHAT END?\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\r\n     Than are dreamt of in your philosophy._”\r\n\r\n     SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Truth’s fountains may be clear, her streams are muddy._”\r\n\r\n     LORD BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_Myself when young did eagerly frequent\r\n     Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument\r\n       About it and about: but evermore\r\n     Came out by the same door wherein I went._\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   _The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes\r\n    But Here or There as strikes the Player goes;\r\n      And He that tossed you down into the Field,\r\n    He knows about it all—HE knows—HE knows!_”\r\n\r\n    Rubáiyát of OMAR KHÁYYÁM.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “_A man finds he has been wrong at every preceding stage of\r\n   his career, only to deduce the astonishing conclusion that he\r\n   is at last entirely right.

Jerôme Coignard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wisest words, probably, that were ever heard in a court-room were\r\nuttered by Gamaliel, the Pharisee, at the trial of Peter and John:\r\n“Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this\r\nwork be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot\r\noverthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.”\r\n\r\nTo a similar purport, Montaigne wrote:—\r\n\r\n   “‘Tis a very great presumption to slight and condemn all\r\n   things for false that do not appear to us likely to be true,\r\n   which is the ordinary vice of such as fancy themselves wiser\r\n   than their neighbours. I was myself once one of these; and if\r\n   I heard talk of dead folks walking, of prophecies,\r\n   enchantments, witchcrafts, or any other story, I had no mind\r\n   to believe.... I presently pitied the poor people that were\r\n   abused by these follies, whereas I now find that I myself was\r\n   to be pitied as much at least as they; not that experience has\r\n   taught me anything to supersede my former opinions, though my\r\n   curiosity has endeavoured that way; but reason has instructed\r\n   me that thus resolutely to condemn anything for false and\r\n   impossible is to circumscribe and limit the will of God and\r\n   the power of nature within the bounds of my own capacity, than\r\n   which no folly can be greater. If we give the names of monster\r\n   and miracle to everything our reason cannot comprehend, how\r\n   many such are continually presented before our eyes! Let us\r\n   but consider through what clouds and, as it were, groping\r\n   through what darkness, our teachers lead us to the knowledge\r\n   of most of the things we apply our studies to, and we shall\r\n   find that it is rather custom than knowledge that takes away\r\n   the wonder, and renders them easy and familiar to us; ... and\r\n   that, if those things were now newly presented to us, we\r\n   should think them as strange and incredible, if not more so,\r\n   than others.... He that had never seen a river imagined the\r\n   first he met with to be the sea, and the greatest things that\r\n   have fallen within our knowledge we conclude to be the\r\n   extremes that nature makes of the kind.”\r\n\r\nTo have pondered and appropriated these words of the far-sighted\r\nPharisee and the sage of Périgord is to have stricken the word\r\n_impossible_ from one’s vocabulary, to have lost the desire to emit\r\nshrieks of anger or dismay before new views of life and society, and,\r\nwithout “mockings or arguments,” to simply “witness and wait.”\r\n\r\nThe philosophic doubt which no one more than Montaigne has approved—the\r\n“_Que sçais-je?_” which forbids the swearing of unconditional allegiance\r\nto unproved theories—is, of course, always in order; but doubt becomes\r\nmost pernicious dogmatism when it assumes the rôle of denial. It plays\r\nits proper part when, and only when, it produces a willingness to “leave\r\ngreat changes,” as Stevenson happily puts it, “to what we call great\r\nblind forces, their blindness being so much more perspicacious than the\r\nlittle peering, partial eyesight of men.”\r\n\r\n“_La folie d’hier est la sagesse de demain_” has been said so long, and\r\naccepted so long, that there is no tracing it to its origin; and yet we\r\ngo on diligently disregarding it, seizing every fresh occasion to “kick\r\nagainst the pricks,” quite as if the stupidity of the practice had not\r\nbeen demonstrated a thousand times over, quite as if the stones rejected\r\nby the builders had never become the heads of the corners, and the first\r\nhad never been last, and the last first.\r\n\r\n   “_Vieux soldats de plomb que nous sommes,\r\n     Au cordeau nous alignant tous,\r\n     Si de nos rangs sortent des hommes,\r\n     Tous nous crions: A bas les fous!\r\n     On les persécute, on les tue,\r\n     Sauf, après un long examen,\r\n     A leur dresser une statue\r\n     Pour la gloire du genre humain._”[143]\r\n\r\n“If we came from a globe where there was some semblance of rule and\r\norder,” says Georges Clemenceau, “the spectacle of our planet would\r\nappear to us a pure abomination.” In the interests of clearness, M.\r\nClemenceau has exaggerated, perhaps. Nevertheless, there is an element\r\nof truth in what he says. Our society is abundantly open to criticism;\r\nand that we chance to be inimical to panaceas and suspicious of Utopias\r\nis no valid reason for calling the black of our society white, and\r\nblandly treating its absurdities, illogicalities, injustices, and\r\ncruelties as infallibilities and amenities. Because the reformer commits\r\nthe folly of dogmatising in one direction does not excuse us for\r\ncommitting the counter-folly of dogmatising in another. Suppose we hold\r\nwith Omar that\r\n\r\n       “_the first Morning of Creation wrote\r\n   What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read,_”\r\n\r\nand suppose we are prone to take at the letter these lines of Walt\r\nWhitman,—\r\n\r\n   “_There was never any more inception than there is now,\r\n     Nor any more youth or age than there is now,\r\n     And will never be any more perfection than there is now,\r\n     Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now,_”—\r\n\r\nis it, therefore, necessary for us to shut our eyes to the most obvious\r\nfacts of the present and to all possibilities for the future?\r\n\r\nWhen Victor Barrucand, a few years ago, put forward his scheme for free\r\nbread (“_le pain gratuit_”), he was not treated as a visionary in any\r\nimportant quarter. The semi-bourgeois journals showed themselves, in\r\nseveral instances, rather friendly; and the opposition he encountered\r\nfrom the straight bourgeois press was of quite a different sort from\r\nthat which is evoked by a preposterous proposition. M. Clemenceau, one\r\nof the few radicals who has never for a moment lost his balance,\r\nsupported him warmly.\r\n\r\n   “It is high time we knew,” said Clemenceau, “whether, at the\r\n   degree of civilisation to which we have attained, we can\r\n   continue to tolerate that men, women, and children die of\r\n   want—in a few months from the exhaustion induced by\r\n   insufficiently remunerated work or in a few hours from\r\n   downright hunger. Our republican and monarchical\r\n   conservatives—all excellent Christians—answer, ‘No,’ but\r\n   continue to act ‘Yes.’... I just remarked that M. Barrucand\r\n   did not propose revolution to us. I ask myself now if I did\r\n   not go a bit too fast. Yes, eighteen hundred years after the\r\n   Christ, it is a revolution for Christians to prevent the death\r\n   of their fellows by slow and rapid starvation. Well, then, let\r\n   us inaugurate this revolution!”\r\n\r\n“_Le pain gratuit c’est le futur_,” said Jules Lermina at the same\r\nmoment. And, really, is it so unreasonable that every one should be\r\ngiven enough to eat, when slaves have been, and domestic animals are, so\r\nprovided for, and when every one is given the privilege of learning to\r\nread and write? Is it not rather surprising that a person should be\r\npermitted, nay, forced, to acquire reading and writing, and should be\r\nsupplied at the public expense (without apparent opposition from any\r\nsource) with fresh air, lights, pure water, paved streets, and parks,\r\nand should not be provided with bread; that he is entitled to food\r\ninspection and is not entitled to food itself; that he is assured proper\r\ndisposition for his waste and is not assured a sufficiency of supply;\r\nthat he can count on a burial and cannot count—supreme irony!—on a\r\nliving; has the right to a grave-plot and has not the right to a loaf?\r\nIs illiteracy so much more dangerous to society than destitution? Is\r\neverything as merry as it might be when death thus lords it over life;\r\nwhen a man asks for bread, and is given a coffin?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CONTRAST IN FUNERALS]\r\n\r\nA republic with manhood suffrage and generally disseminated\r\nbook-knowledge would probably have seemed as chimerical to the minds of\r\nour not very remote ancestors as the community of the socialist or\r\nanarchist dream seems to us. It would not be more remarkable if\r\nwage-earners should disappear than it was that serfs and slaves\r\ndisappeared; if the factory system should disappear than it was that it\r\nonce appeared; if alms-giving should be replaced by a recognition of the\r\nright to work than that charity from being a fine, spontaneous human\r\nimpulse has become an unwieldy, soulless machine; if private property\r\nshould be transformed into collective property than that private\r\nproperty was evolved out of the tribal possessions; if the church should\r\ncease to be an institution of the state—indeed it has already ceased to\r\nbe in America—than that it ever became one; if _l’union libre_ should\r\nsupersede marriage (with the loss of the latter’s chief sanctions,\r\nprivate property and the already much-enfeebled authority of the church)\r\nthan that monogamy has superseded polygamy; if woman should be\r\nemancipated than that man has, up to a certain point, been emancipated.\r\nFurthermore, it would be no more extraordinary if the _tiers état_ (the\r\npresent dominant _bourgeoisie_) should be evicted by the _quatrième\r\nétat_ (the proletariat) than it was that the _tiers état_ evicted the\r\nnobility and clergy in 1789; if a social republic (under which without\r\nknowing or, at least, without admitting it we are already half\r\ninstalled) should follow close upon the heels of a simple republic than\r\nthat a simple republic followed close upon the heels of a monarchy and a\r\nmonarchy close upon the heels of a feudal system; if nations should pass\r\nas political entities by being merged in an _Internationale_ than that\r\nthey emerged out of the seeming chaos of the Middle Ages; if there\r\nshould be one tongue over all the earth[144] than that there has come to\r\nbe one tongue over any entire people; if there should be general peace\r\nthan that there has been general war.\r\n\r\nNo, there is nothing inherently incredible or absurd about the ideas and\r\nideals of the contemporary revolutionists; nothing more transcendental\r\nor more visionary than there was, for their day and their generation, in\r\nthe ideas and ideals of the Encyclopedists, and of the innovators and\r\nreformers of all the past.\r\n\r\nIt may have been a mistake for the classes to impose book-learning on\r\nthe masses, to compel them to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge\r\nof good and evil, which makes men as gods; but, having given their wards\r\nto eat thereof, having deliberately stimulated them to think, the\r\nprivileged must let them follow out their thinking to the\r\nlogical—perhaps, also, to the bitter—end. There is no alternative.\r\nThere is no such thing as staying them midway in their course, since\r\nwith growing knowledge has come growing desire.\r\n\r\nIf the classes did not wish the masses to drink deep of the Pierian\r\nspring, they should have had the sense to keep them away from it\r\naltogether instead of ingenuously leading them up to sip. As it is, the\r\npeople have become mentally and morally incapable of blind submission.\r\nThey cannot be hoodwinked by fine phrases as of yore. Their roused and\r\ntrained intelligence is rapidly penetrating the shams, puncturing the\r\nfrauds, and stripping off the shows of republicanism. They will not much\r\nlonger be put off with the mere forms and formulas of liberty and\r\nwell-being which satisfied them at the start. They are now beginning to\r\ndemand the things themselves, and they have at last the minds and the\r\nmanhood necessary to enforce their demand. The illogical, hypocritical,\r\nplutocratic republic which they find themselves under disgusts and\r\nexasperates them quite as much as would a monarchy. They have resolved\r\nto have out-and-out democracy instead of the miserable makeshift for\r\ndemocracy that has been thrown to them as a sop; and have it they will!\r\n_Gare à vous_, naïve, short-sighted bourgeois, who with your reading and\r\nwriting started them on their quest for the new, if you attempt to place\r\nobstructions in their path!\r\n\r\nThe people have a startling way of getting, in the long run, the\r\nspecific things they set their hearts on. And one may admit—without the\r\nslightest prejudice to his intellectual independence or the slightest\r\nabdication of his preferences—that the specific things the\r\nrevolutionists of Paris and the world at large are striving for may\r\nsooner or later be theirs.\r\n\r\nA successful social revolution, one day or another, is neither an\r\ninconceivable, an impossible, nor even an improbable event. The time may\r\ncome, at least for all that we can reasonably affirm to the contrary,\r\nwhen there will be no more governments, no more great fortunes, no more\r\nprivate property, no more poverty, no more “marrying and giving in\r\nmarriage,” no more wars, no more armies, no more patriotism, and no more\r\ndiversity of tongues.\r\n\r\nThis is not saying that the individual life will be fuller, richer, and\r\nsweeter then than it has been and is, nor that the world will be\r\nenormously better and happier than it is and has been. Apples of the\r\nmost golden seeming have been known to turn to ashes in the plucker’s\r\nhand; and, when the time comes—if it does come—that the\r\nrevolutionists’ present cravings have all been satisfied, the millennium\r\nwill still, in all likelihood, be as far as ever away.\r\n\r\nChange, incessant change, is the law of the universe; but change, though\r\ninevitable, and hence never really bad and never really to be regretted,\r\nis not synonymous with progress,—not in the sense, at least, in which\r\nthe latter word is generally understood.\r\n\r\n   “_Partout de l’astre à l’étincelle,\r\n     Partout la vie universelle,\r\n     Se fond, tourbillonne, et ruisselle,\r\n     Et tout passe, et rien s’en va._”\r\n\r\nIt is as big a piece of dogmatism to be cock-sure the world is growing\r\nbetter all the time and all along the line, simply because it is\r\nperpetually changing, as it is to be cock-sure it is constantly growing\r\nworse, and as big a piece of credulity to look forward confidently to a\r\nGolden Age in the future as to revert—unhumorously—to a Golden Age in\r\nthe past. Every system of society which has existed thus far is now\r\nadmitted to have had its qualities and its defects,—what is more, the\r\ndefects of its qualities. Our period of machinery, universal suffrage,\r\nand diffused book-knowledge (factors from which our fathers expected\r\nmiracles to spring) has its blemishes as well as the periods of\r\nilliteracy, blooded aristocracy, and hand labour. Our new woman—we are\r\nreminded every day—is as antipathetic and inept in some ways as she is\r\ncharming and useful in other ways; and, while we cannot be sure that\r\nevery future period will “depress some elements of goodness just as much\r\nas it will encourage others,” we have, alas! no adequate guarantee that\r\nit will not do so.\r\n\r\nIt may be that it is again to be the mission of France to redeem (or\r\nappear to redeem) the world by a sort of vicarious atonement. The cult\r\nof revolution is not dead there, and the impulse that demolished the\r\nBastille has by no means spent itself. Or it may be that for Russia,\r\nwhere the provocation is greatest, or for America, where there is most\r\ninitiative and the most accelerated rate of change, is reserved this\r\nfearsome rôle. But, wherever the Social Revolution begins and wherever\r\nit reaches, the well-balanced man, who has won through stress and\r\ntravail to a sane outlook and to an enthusiasm for life; he who can say\r\nwith Kipling’s “Tramp Royal,”—\r\n\r\n   “_Gawd bless this world! Whatever she ‘ath done—\r\n     Excep’ when awful long—I’ve found it good.\r\n     So write before I die, ‘’E liked it all!’_”—\r\n\r\nwill await its arrival with complete equanimity.\r\n\r\n   “_Think, then, you are To-day what Yesterday\r\n     You were—To-morrow you shall not be less._”\r\n\r\nFriendships and loves—the only things really worth while to seasoned\r\nnatures—have always been. Under all régimes, men have had friends and\r\nsweethearts and little ones for the greater glory of their souls; and\r\nfriends and sweethearts and little ones—the boldest innovators do not\r\nassert otherwise—they are likely to have while time is.\r\n\r\nThese loves and these friendships have found such beautiful expression\r\nalready that there is little to hope from the future. On the other\r\nhand, so far as they are concerned, there is nothing to fear.\r\n\r\nWhat matters, then, in the last analysis the march of public\r\nevents,—monarchy, republic, social republic, or anarchistic\r\ncommune,—so that we bear the brunt together, heart to heart, and the\r\ngreat elemental things abide?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Eternal Realities]\r\n\r\n   “_Of the possibility of a free communistic society there can\r\n   really I take it be no doubt. The question that more\r\n   definitely presses on us now is one of transition—By what\r\n   steps shall we, or can we pass to that land of freedom?_\r\n\r\n   “_We have supposed a whole people started on its journey by\r\n   the lifting off of the burden of Fear and Anxiety; but in the\r\n   long slow ascent of Evolution no sudden miraculous change can\r\n   be expected; and for this reason alone it is obvious that we\r\n   can look for no sudden transformation to the communist form.\r\n   Peoples that have learnt the lesson of ‘trade’ and competition\r\n   so thoroughly as the modern nations have—each man fighting for\r\n   his own hand—must take some time to unlearn it. The Sentiment\r\n   of the Common Life, so long nipped and blighted, must have\r\n   leisure to grow and expand again; and we must acknowledge\r\n   that—in order to foster new ideas and new habits—an\r\n   intermediate stage of Collectivism will be quite necessary.\r\n   Formulæ like the ‘nationalisation of the land and all the\r\n   instruments of production,’ though they be vague and indeed\r\n   impossible of rigorous application, will serve as centres\r\n   for the growth of the sentiment. The partial application of\r\n   these formulæ will put folk through a lot of useful drilling\r\n   in the effort to work together and for common ends._”—EDWARD\r\n   CARPENTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Reclus’ anarchist brochure _A mon Ami le Paysan_ is a veritable\r\nliterary gem.\r\n\r\n[2] When they do not render it unproductive by transforming it into\r\nhunting grounds or pleasure parks or leave it sterile, either through\r\nwant of sufficient capital to ameliorate it or simply from indifference\r\nand neglect.—_Jean Grave._\r\n\r\n[3] In France. The usage is somewhat different in certain other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[4] Normally, all posters must carry revenue stamps.\r\n\r\n[5] The officers of an assembly are so called in France.\r\n\r\n[6] Charenton is the Paris insane hospital.\r\n\r\n[7] The word _trimardeur_ is derived from the dialect word _trimard_,\r\nwhich means _grande route_ (the great road).\r\n\r\n[8] Strictly, at 2 sous a four-page folder, each folder containing the\r\nwords and music of one song and the words of two or three others.\r\n\r\n[9] Ravachol was convicted of several overt acts, among them the\r\ndynamiting of the house of the judges Benoit and Bulot.\r\n\r\n[10] M. Leroy now has a little book-store in the Montsouris district.\r\n\r\n[11] Henri Bérenger’s _L’Action_, for all its violence, cannot be so\r\nclassed. A pronounced anarchist, Charles Malato, was for a time one of\r\nthe pillars of the acrimonious daily _L’Aurore_, and it is frequently\r\nrecommended by the anarchist press for anarchist reading. But it was\r\nnever, strictly speaking, an anarchist sheet. It is now under the\r\ncontrol of the radical Clemenceau.\r\n\r\n[12] The general title of the series is _La Bibliothèque Documentaire_.\r\n\r\n[13] The office of the _Temps Nouveaux_ has been transferred to the rue\r\nBroca, in the same district.\r\n\r\n[14] A set of anarchist groups, loosely federated, which devote\r\nthemselves to study with persistence and zeal.\r\n\r\n[15] Drawn after an _image de propagande_.\r\n\r\n[16] Author of the explosion at the _Café Terminus._\r\n\r\n[17] The assassin of Carnot.\r\n\r\n[18] Inability to pay this fine involving further imprisonment, the real\r\nterm of the editors condemned for two years became in most cases three\r\nyears or three years and a half. It should be noted, however, that a\r\nconsiderable proportion of them were condemned for contumacy, they\r\nhaving made good their escape to England or Belgium before their cases\r\nwere tried.\r\n\r\n[19] M. Gabriel Girond has written a volume entitled _Cempuis_ on this\r\neducational experiment, which no educator or student of education can\r\nafford to neglect. Maurice Devaldès, also, in a brochure entitled\r\n_L’Education et la Liberté_, compares the educational experiment of\r\nTolstoy at Yasnaïa-Poliana with M. Robin’s experiment at Cempuis, to the\r\nadvantage of the latter.\r\n\r\n[20] Believed by many to have been managed by the police in order to sow\r\ndissensions and cause divisions in the ranks of the anarchists.\r\n\r\n[21] In Russia, where many of the most violent _propagandistes par le\r\nfait_ are men of letters or scientists, the situation is quite\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n[22] Reclus’ daughters have entered into _union libre_ openly with their\r\nfather’s entire approval. A man of Elisée Reclus’ standing would not aid\r\nand abet such a course without profound conviction.\r\n\r\n[23] A strike of pick-and-shovel labourers, to supervise which the\r\ngovernment hurried 75,000 soldiers into Paris, although there were no\r\nsigns of violence.\r\n\r\n[24] Certain anarchists hold that it is proper for an anarchist to\r\npenetrate into the unions, so that he does not preside at their\r\nformation nor hold office therein,—an attitude which is amusingly\r\nanalogous to that of the scrupulous Episcopalian dame who drew the line\r\nof the permissible in Lent just this side of white kid slippers.\r\n\r\n[25] Communist-anarchists, in spite of the word _Socialistes_ in their\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n[26] Vaillant threw a bomb in the French Chamber.\r\n\r\n[27] Bresci killed King Humbert of Italy.\r\n\r\n[28] Estimated in France officially, and hence conservatively, as\r\n40,000.\r\n\r\n[29] Special laboratories, with walls constructed to minimise the force\r\nof a shock were erected at this time at four different points in\r\nParis,—Montrouge, Aubervilliers, Berey, and Le Point du Jour.\r\n\r\n[30] Salsou, who attempted to assassinate the Shah of Persia, was a\r\n_trimardeur_.\r\n\r\n[31] Whence the slang verb _watriner_ and the substantive _watrinade_.\r\n\r\n[32] Another version is that Pini, having voted twice, was condemned\r\nto three months’ imprisonment, and that it was to avoid this that he\r\nleft the country.\r\n\r\n[33] Frustrated by a faithful dog.\r\n\r\n[34] This sentence was commuted to long-term imprisonment by President\r\nGrévy.\r\n\r\n[35] _Le terme_ (rent) in Paris must be paid quarterly and in advance.\r\nIt is due on the 1st, and must be paid on the 8th or 15th (according to\r\nits amount) of January, April, July, and October.\r\n\r\n[36] There is a distinct class of men and women in Paris ready at any\r\nmoment to cry à bas or vive, no matter whom or what, for a five-franc\r\npiece. Napoléon Hayard, known as the “_empereur des camelots_,” who died\r\nrecently at a ripe age, was known to Parisians for many years as an\r\norganiser of manifestations.\r\n\r\n[37] It was Rochefort who declared the mysterious shooting of Labori\r\nduring the Dreyfus trial at Rennes to be a fictitious manœuvre.\r\n\r\n[38] The curious filing of the hammer of Salsou’s pistol, which rendered\r\nimpossible—according to a portion of the expert testimony—its discharge,\r\nlent a certain colour of truth to this accusation.\r\n\r\n[39] As lately as 1902 the anarchist spy service was recruited in this\r\nfashion, and so openly that spies might almost be said to have been\r\nadvertised for.\r\n\r\n[40] M. Andrieux’s _La Révolution Sociale_ was probably not the last\r\njournal of its class.\r\n\r\n[41] The militant anarchist’s knowledge of the code and of legal\r\nprocedure is also phenomenal. There is nothing he enjoys better, when in\r\ngood humour, than to remind his judge of a forgotten or wilfully\r\nneglected formality.\r\n\r\n[42] Baumann shot a priest who was personally unknown to him for the\r\nsake of the propaganda.\r\n\r\n[43] Ravachol was attempting to make a convert an hour and a half after\r\nthe explosion of the rue de Clichy.\r\n\r\n[44] Passanante attempted to assassinate King Humbert of Italy.\r\n\r\n[45] The prosecution of Tailhade was probably a sop to the Russian\r\ndiplomats, his article having been specially directed against the czar.\r\n\r\n[46] Ravachol justified these acts to himself on the ground that the\r\nliving and still more the dead had no right to hold wealth in\r\nunproductiveness while human beings were starving. The proceeds of both\r\nthese deeds were religiously consecrated by him to the _propagande_.\r\n\r\n[47] The probable author of the explosion at the _Restaurant Véry_.\r\n\r\n[48] Accused of complicity in various overt acts, but not condemned.\r\n\r\n[49] Ravachol’s masterful sneer at the church on his way to the\r\nguillotine was not, it seems, pure perverseness. Ravachol had taken a\r\nreal liking to the prison priest, whom he admitted to be a good fellow,\r\nbut he had such a horror of being claimed by the church after his death\r\nas an eleventh-hour penitent that he had requested the priest not to\r\nassist at his execution. To this request the priest had answered,—could\r\nanything well be more _maladroit_?—“I cannot avoid it. I shall be there\r\nby the same right as the headsman.”\r\n\r\n[50] The _Guesdistes_ and the _Jeunesse Blanquiste_ were the most\r\nimportant exceptions.\r\n\r\n[51] Hostile, that is, except at the eleventh hour of their congress,\r\nwhen they usually contrive to vote resolutions of harmony.\r\n\r\n[52] Leader of the _Parti Socialiste Révolutionnaire_.\r\n\r\n[53] Leader of the _Fédération des Travailleurs Socialistes_.\r\n\r\n[54] There is no socialist daily, however, which is not under\r\ncapitalistic control.\r\n\r\n[55] There has long been a shelf in one of the book-stalls of the arcade\r\nof the _Odéon_ devoted exclusively to works on Socialism. Whether this\r\ndevice is due to business insight or propagandist fervour, it is equally\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\n[56] Leader of the _Groupe des Socialistes Independants_.\r\n\r\n[57] Commemorating the Bloody Week of the Commune.\r\n\r\n[58] Burned at the stake in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[59] Some _coopératives socialistes_ have been established.\r\n\r\n[60] Leader of the _Parti Ouvrier Français_.\r\n\r\n[61] Leader of the _Parti Ouvrier Socialiste Révolutionnaire_.\r\n\r\n[62] The illustration of the Place Maubert shows one of its humble\r\nlatter-day distinctions. It is the market-place for the _Mégotiers_ of\r\nthe Quarter, gatherers of cigar and cigarette stubs, who carry canes\r\nwith which to rake up these tobacco remnants.\r\n\r\n[63] Michelet.\r\n\r\n[64] Jules Vallès.\r\n\r\n[65] Whence the word _frondeur_ (captious), currently applied to the\r\nstudents to this day.\r\n\r\n[66] La Harpe, the autocrat of the literary world, appeared before his\r\nclass one day in a red Phrygian cap, and devoted a portion of his\r\nlecture-hour to declaiming revolutionary _chansons_.\r\n\r\n[67] It would be superfluous to name their present habitués, since they\r\nare as yet too young to be famous.\r\n\r\n[68] The accompanying illustration is a portrait sketch of the son of\r\nFelix Gras in his favourite seat at one of these cabarets, above which\r\nsome artist has scrawled his caricature.\r\n\r\n[69] The _Grille_ and the _Noctambules_, the best-known _café-concerts_\r\nof the _Quartier_, are purely professional affairs. Their performers are\r\nnot students, and students make up only a small part of their audiences.\r\n\r\n[70] There were martyrs to conviction on both sides in the Dreyfus case,\r\nas there were under the last empire.\r\n\r\n[71] More than once during the Dreyfus affair the _Quartier_ seemed to\r\nbe on the verge of an eruption; but the lying, contemptible manœuvres of\r\nDreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusards alike threw cold water on both its\r\nmilitary and its anti-military enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n[72] Haraucourt has recently been elevated to the position of librarian\r\nof one of the principal libraries of Paris.\r\n\r\n[73] Jacques Le Lorrain has just died of consumption. A short time\r\nbefore his death he had the happiness of having his remarkable poetical\r\nplay _Don Quixote_ performed at the _Théâtre Victor Hugo_.\r\n\r\n[74] The _Salons_ were held in the Louvre at this period.\r\n\r\n[75] _Dèche_ and _purée_ (the latter akin to the Americanism “in the\r\nsoup”) are Bohemian slang for _misère_.\r\n\r\n[76] A law which commutes the penalty, but without expunging the\r\ncondemnation from the record.\r\n\r\n[77] Since these lines were written, word has come, alas! that Bibi is\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n[78] The _Cabaret du Père Lunette_—on the edge of the Latin Quarter—and\r\nits near neighbour, the _Château Rouge_ (also called _La Guillotine_),\r\nwere notorious criminal resorts in the days, not so very remote, before\r\nthe piercing of the rue Lagrange and the enlarging of the Place Maubert\r\nrendered innocuous one of the most dangerous corners of Paris. The\r\n_Château Rouge_ was recently demolished, and the Père Lunette ceased\r\nseveral years back to be anything but an insipid show-place for\r\ntourists. Neither has ever been an organic part of the _Quartier_ life.\r\n\r\n[79] Practical joker seems to be the only possible translation of the\r\nword _fumiste_, but it is a most inadequate one.\r\n\r\n[80] The rue de Croissant is filled with newspaper offices.\r\n\r\n[81] _Se coucher à la belle étoile_ is to be without a lodging other\r\nthan the pavement.\r\n\r\n[82] _Ma tante_ = the pawn-shop.\r\n\r\n[83] A name given to the younger poets of the more eccentric schools.\r\n\r\n[84] Discontinued with the discontinuance of its provocation, the fête\r\nof the _Bœuf Gras_.\r\n\r\n[85] Père la Pudeur, a name applied originally to the French Anthony\r\nComstock, M. Bérenger.\r\n\r\n[86] The _Bal Gavarni_ and the _Bal Monnier_ held at Montmartre in 1902\r\nand 1904 respectively—as a tribute to the memory of two great French\r\ncaricaturists—and the open-air Montmartre festivals, _Le Couronnement de\r\nla Rosière Montmartroise_ (1903) and _Le Mariage de la Rosière\r\nMontmartroise_ (1904), though similar in conception to the cavalcade of\r\nthe _Vache Enragée_, proved less effective from this particular point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[87] Henry Mürger.\r\n\r\n[88] _Déménager à la cloche de bois_ is to move secretly without paying\r\none’s rent.\r\n\r\n[89] The _Rat Mort_ has completely changed its character of late years.\r\nOnly at the _déjeuner_ and the dinner hours is any hint of its former\r\nself obtainable.\r\n\r\n[90] The slope from these boulevards to the rue de Lamartine and the rue\r\nSt. Lazare (between the rue de Clichy and the rue de Rochechouart) is\r\naffiliated with Montmartre, and by a stretching of the point may be said\r\nto belong to it; but its population is too largely made up of bourgeois\r\nand the exploiting _cocottes_ of the _Olympia_, _Moulin Rouge_, _Casino\r\nde Paris_, and _Folies-Bergères_ to admit of its being absolutely\r\nco-ordinated with the Butte.\r\n\r\n[91] Called _logement_ to distinguish it from the _appartement_, which\r\nis more pretentious. The kitchen of the _logement_ is provided with\r\nrunning water and gas; and the gas company is required by law to furnish\r\nthe tenant who does not pay more than 500 francs a year rent a new gas\r\nrange, _gratis_. Ateliers are relatively dearer, and the artist does not\r\neasily find an atelier in which he can live and work for less than 600\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\n[92] Recently deceased.\r\n\r\n[93] At Montmartre, as in all parts of Paris, hand-carts may be hired\r\nfor a few sous an hour.\r\n\r\n[94] _Cyrano de Bergerac._\r\n\r\n[95] A seaside resort.\r\n\r\n[96] It is not a rare thing for a Montmartre organ to speak of a trip to\r\nthe Grands-Boulevards or the Latin Quarter as “_un départ vers les pays\r\nétrangers désignés sous le nom des Etats-Unis de Paris_.”\r\n\r\n[97] The word _hydropathe_ was absolutely without significance in this\r\nconnection. It was hit upon by the merest chance, and welcomed because\r\nit suggested nothing that could mislead or occasion dispute.\r\n\r\n[98] Salis died several years ago.\r\n\r\n[99] One of these just beginning to be known, and hence sure soon to be\r\nspoiled, began with improvised tables made by placing boards upon\r\nwine-casks, and with other paraphernalia in keeping.\r\n\r\n[100] Deceased.\r\n\r\n[101] The French free-stage movement, which involved revolutionary\r\nthought as well as revolutionary form, was launched at Montmartre, and\r\nwas identified with Montmartre through all its polemic period,—up to the\r\nmoment, in fact, when it became Parisian, having gained its cause.\r\n\r\n[102] Alexandre is about to leave Montmartre for the Grands-Boulevards.\r\n\r\n[103] _Maquereau_ is a type name for a criminal loafer who lives by the\r\nprostitution of his mistress.\r\n\r\n[104] _Biribi_ is the name given to the African battalion to which\r\nrecalcitrant soldiers are assigned.\r\n\r\n[105] _Les Opinions de M. Jerôme Coignard._ M. Coignard belongs to the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[106] Since M. France wrote these words, the images of the Christ have\r\nbeen removed from the French courts.\r\n\r\n[107] As evidence that M. Barrucand’s scheme for free bread deserves to\r\nbe considered as something more than the Utopian ideal of a littérateur,\r\nit should be mentioned that the economist L. Auby advocated the same\r\nthing (winter of 1903-04) in as conservative an organ as the _Annales\r\nParlementaires_.\r\n\r\n[108] Dubois-Dessaulle, while acting as a newspaper correspondent in\r\nAbyssinia in the spring of 1904, was assassinated by natives. He was a\r\nmartyr to his conscientious belief that it is a crime to carry arms.\r\n\r\n[109] J.-H. Rosny is the signature of the Rosny brothers, who have to be\r\ntreated as one person in their relations to thought and literature.\r\n\r\n[110] Several of the persons here named are also writers of fiction or\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n[111] Lately deceased.\r\n\r\n[112] Lately deceased.\r\n\r\n[113] This title may perhaps be paraphrased by the American\r\ncolloquialism “Out of It.”\r\n\r\n[114] Henri Fouquier, an older conservative journalist (recently\r\ndeceased), of so much distinction that he was considered a possible\r\nAcademician, published about this time an article in the _XIXᵉ Siècle_\r\nin which he ridiculed the blowing up of the house of the bourgeois as an\r\nact devoid of common sense, but declared comprehensible a desire to blow\r\nup the Chamber of Deputies, the Prefecture of Police, or the Palace of\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\n[115] “I surely have the right,” he said, “to quit the theatre when the\r\npiece becomes odious to me, and even to slam the doors behind me in\r\ngoing out, at the risk of troubling the tranquillity of those who are\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n[116] Author of _Démolissons_ and _De Mazas à Jérusalem_.\r\n\r\n[117] On the occasion of this lecture Xavier Privas was assisted by an\r\nactor and an actress who recited appropriate poems and by the\r\n_chansonnier_ Trimouillat. The hall was entirely without light except\r\nfor a single lamp before the lecturer. In the accompanying illustration\r\nthe standing figure is Trimouillat.\r\n\r\n[118] A translation of this play has been successfully produced in\r\nAmerica (1904) under the title _Business is Business_.\r\n\r\n[119] _La Cage_ is well known, nevertheless, since it is given several\r\nprivate representations every season.\r\n\r\n[120] Forbidden by the censorship, but a favourite at the amateur\r\ntheatricals of the anarchistic groups.\r\n\r\n[121] Under the ban of the censorship from 1891 to 1900.\r\n\r\n[122] Forbidden by the censorship, but given a representation—by\r\ninvitation—at which literary and artistic Paris was fully represented.\r\n\r\n[123] Prohibited by the censorship at the time it was written. The\r\nprohibition was removed in the winter of 1904.\r\n\r\n[124] No notice is taken here of Richepin as a writer of romances.\r\n\r\n[125] Technically, “_d’avoir commis une provocation directe au crime de\r\nmeurtre, laquelle provocation, non suivie d’effet, avait pour but un\r\nacte de propagande anarchiste_.”\r\n\r\n[126] The court in detaching this violent passage from its philosophical\r\nand artistic setting made Tailhade’s offence appear much graver than it\r\nreally was.\r\n\r\n[127] “What I have had especially in view has been to serve the cause of\r\nprogress, of knowledge; that is to say, the Revolution,” wrote the\r\neditor of _Le Décadent_.\r\n\r\n[128] The minor French poets are so little known in England and America\r\nthat it would be superfluous to mention by name the members of these\r\nbizarre coteries.\r\n\r\n[129] _The Magiques_, _Romanistes_, and _Magnificistes_ are possible\r\nexceptions. But the _Magiques_ possessed at one time such an unquiet\r\nspirit as Paul Adam, and the _Magnificistes_ oppose the tyranny of\r\nscience and magnify “_les êtres_.” The _Romanistes_, it is true, accept\r\nrelatively regular poetic forms, but they attack the Christian church\r\nand admit the destruction of nationality. The union of the Latin\r\npeoples, which they advocate, they regard simply as an intermediate step\r\npreparatory to the union of the whole human race.\r\n\r\n[130] Meunier, who is primarily a sculptor, is a Belgian; but his\r\nartistic career has been sufficiently identified with Paris to warrant\r\nhis introduction here.\r\n\r\n[131] Deceased.\r\n\r\n[132] See Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\n[133] Dagnan-Bouveret may have a religious purpose, but scarcely a\r\nhumanitarian one.\r\n\r\n[134] The French word _dessinateur_ is currently applied to\r\nillustrators, freehand draughtsmen, and lithographic sketch artists; in\r\nfact, to all workers in black and white, and even to certain workers in\r\ncolour for purposes of reproduction. It is used above because there\r\nseems to be no single English word equally inclusive. No hard-and-fast\r\ndistinction is made here between the _dessinateurs_ who are primarily\r\ncaricaturists and those who are not.\r\n\r\n[135] Willette, usually classed as a revolutionary socialist, is said by\r\nhis intimates to have been a Bonapartist always at heart. However this\r\nmay be, there is no necessary conflict between Bonapartism and the\r\nrevolutionary ardour which Willette has displayed too often and too\r\nunequivocally to admit of any misunderstanding regarding his attitude\r\ntowards the actual condition of things.\r\n\r\n[136] M. Bérenger, familiarly known as _Père-la-Pudeur_, is an\r\nuncompromising censor of public morals.\r\n\r\n[137] Steinlen is also a painter, but his works in this field, with the\r\nexception of certain fascinating studies of cats, are little known\r\noutside the circle of his friends, and are not equal to his drawings.\r\n\r\n[138] Recently deceased.\r\n\r\n[139] _L’assiette au beurre_ = the plate of butter. To have an _assiette\r\nau beurre_ is to belong to the wealthy; that is, to be able to eat\r\nbutter on one’s bread (or as the French more often say) on one’s\r\nspinach.\r\n\r\n[140] The artistic merit of the _Assiette au Beurre_ has sadly fallen\r\noff of late.\r\n\r\n[141] Even these have made important concessions, as did Verdi in Italy.\r\n\r\n[142] Produced at the _Grand Opéra_.\r\n\r\n[143] Béranger.\r\n\r\n[144] Compare the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n   Abélard, 177, 178, 180.\r\n\r\n   Abruti, L’, 126, 127.\r\n\r\n
