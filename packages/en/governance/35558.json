BURGESS, PH.D., LL.D.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND DEAN OF THE\r\nFACULTY OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, IN COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WITH MAPS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\nCHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS\r\n\r\n1910\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1897, BY CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the memory of my former teacher, colleague, and friend,\r\n\r\nJULIUS HAWLEY SEELYE,\r\n\r\nphilosopher, theologian, statesman, and educator, this volume is\r\nreverently and affectionately inscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no more serious and delicate task in literature and morals\r\nthan that of writing the history of the United States from 1816 to\r\n1860. The periods which precede this may be treated without fear of\r\narousing passion, prejudice, and resentment, and with little danger of\r\nbeing misunderstood. Even the immaculateness of Washington may be\r\nattacked without exciting anything worse than a sort of uncomfortable\r\nadmiration for the reckless courage of the assailant. But when we pass\r\nthe year 1820, and especially when we approach the year 1860, we find\r\nourselves in a different world. We find ourselves in the midst of the\r\nideas, the motives, and the occurrences which, and of the men who,\r\nhave, in large degree, produced the animosities, the friendships, and\r\nthe relations between parties and sections which prevail to-day.\r\n\r\nSerious and delicate as the task is, however, the time has arrived\r\nwhen it should be undertaken in a thoroughly impartial spirit. The\r\ncontinued misunderstanding between the North and the South is an ever\r\npresent menace to the welfare of both sections and of the entire\r\nnation. It makes it almost impossible to decide any question of our\r\npolitics upon its merits. It offers an almost insuperable obstacle to\r\nthe development of a national opinion upon the fundamental principles\r\nof our polity. If we would clear up this confusion in the common\r\nconsciousness, we must do something to dispel this misunderstanding;\r\nand I know of no means of accomplishing this, save the rewriting of\r\nour history from 1816 to 1860, with an open mind and a willing spirit\r\nto see and to represent truth and error, and right and wrong, without\r\nregard to the men or the sections in whom or where they may appear.\r\n\r\nI am by no means certain that I am able to do this. I am old enough to\r\nhave been a witness of the great struggle of 1861-65, and to have\r\nparticipated, in a small way, in it. My early years were embittered by\r\nthe political hatreds which then prevailed. I learned before my\r\nmajority to regard secession as an abomination, and its chief cause,\r\nslavery, as a great evil; and I cannot say that these feelings have\r\nbeen much modified, if any at all, by longer experiences and maturer\r\nthought. I have, therefore, undertaken this work with many misgivings.\r\n\r\nKeenly conscious of my own prejudices, I have exerted my imagination\r\nto the utmost to create a picture in my own mind of the environment of\r\nthose who held the opposite opinion upon these fundamental subjects,\r\nand to appreciate the processes of their reasoning under the\r\ninfluences of their own particular situation. And I have with sedulous\r\ncare avoided all the histories written immediately after the close of\r\nthe great contest of arms, and all rehashes of them of later date. In\r\nfact I have made it an invariable rule to use no secondary material;\r\nthat is, no material in which original matter is mingled with\r\nsomebody's interpretation of its meaning. If, therefore, the facts in\r\nmy narration are twisted by prejudices and preconceptions, I think I\r\ncan assure my readers that they have suffered only one twist. I have\r\nalso endeavored to approach my subject in a reverent spirit, and to\r\ndeal with the characters who made our history, in this almost tragic\r\nperiod, as serious and sincere men having a most perplexing and\r\nmomentous problem to solve, a problem not of their own making, but a\r\nfatal inheritance from their predecessors.\r\n\r\nI have been especially repelled by the flippant superficiality of the\r\nforeign critics of this period of our history, and their evident\r\ndelight in representing the professions and teachings of the \"Free\r\nRepublic\" as canting hypocrisy. It has seemed to me a great misfortune\r\nthat the present generation and future generations should be taught to\r\nregard so lightly the earnest efforts of wise, true, and honorable men\r\nto rescue the country from the great catastrophe which, for so long,\r\nimpended over it. The passionate onesidedness of our own writers is\r\nhardly more harmful, and is certainly less repulsive.\r\n\r\nI recently heard a distinguished professor of history and politics say\r\nthat he thought the history of the United States, in this period,\r\ncould be truthfully written only by a Scotch-Irishman. I suppose he\r\nmeant that the Scotch element in this ideal historian would take the\r\nNorthern point of view, and the Irish element the Southern; but I\r\ncould not see how this would produce anything more than another pair\r\nof narratives from the old contradictory points of view; and he did\r\nnot explain how it would.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is, on the contrary, that this history must be written by\r\nan American and a Northerner, and from the Northern point of\r\nview--because an American best understands Americans, after all;\r\nbecause the victorious party can be and will be more liberal,\r\ngenerous, and sympathetic than the vanquished; and because the\r\nNorthern view is, in the main, the correct view. It will not improve\r\nmatters to concede that the South had right and the North might, or,\r\neven, that both were equally right and equally wrong. Such a doctrine\r\ncan only work injury to both, and more injury to the South than to the\r\nNorth. Chewing the bitter cud of fancied wrong produces both spiritual\r\nmisery and material adversity, and tempts to foolish and reckless\r\naction for righting the imagined injustice. Moreover, any such\r\ndoctrine is false, and acquiescence in it, however kindly meant, is\r\nweak, and can have no other effect than the perpetuation of error and\r\nmisunderstanding. The time has come when the men of the South should\r\nacknowledge that they were in error in their attempt to destroy the\r\nUnion, and it is unmanly in them not to do so. When they appealed the\r\ngreat question from the decision at the ballot-box to the \"trial by\r\nbattle,\" their leaders declared, over and over again, in calling their\r\nfollowers to arms, that the \"God of battles\" would surely give the\r\nvictory to the right. In the great movements of the world's history\r\nthis is certainly a sound philosophy, and they should have held to it\r\nafter their defeat. Their recourse to the crude notion that they had\r\nsuccumbed only to might was thus not only a bitter, false, and\r\ndangerous consolation, but it was a stultification of themselves when\r\nat their best as men and heroes.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, great care has been taken, in the following pages,\r\nto attribute to the Southern leaders and the Southern people sincerity\r\nof purpose in their views and their acts, while their ideas and their\r\nreasoning have been, I think, duly appreciated, and patiently\r\nexplained, while the right has been willingly acknowledged to them and\r\nhonor accorded them whenever and wherever they have had the right and\r\nhave merited honor, and while unbounded sympathy for personal\r\nsuffering and misfortune has been expressed, still not one scintilla\r\nof justification for secession and rebellion must be expected. The\r\nSouth must acknowledge its error as well as its defeat in regard to\r\nthese things, and that, too, not with lip service, but from the brain\r\nand the heart and the manly will, before any real concord in thought\r\nand feeling, any real national brotherhood, can be established. This\r\nis not too much to demand, simply because it is right, and nothing can\r\nbe settled, as Mr. Lincoln said, until it is settled right. Any\r\ninterpretation of this period of American history which does not\r\ndemonstrate to the South its error will be worthless, simply because\r\nit will not be true; and unless we are men enough to hear and accept\r\nand stand upon the truth, it is useless to endeavor to find a bond of\r\nreal union between us. In a word, the conviction of the South of its\r\nerror in secession and rebellion is absolutely indispensable to the\r\nestablishment of national cordiality; and the history of this period\r\nwhich fails to do this will fail in accomplishing one of the highest\r\nworks of history, the reconciliation of men to the plans of Providence\r\nfor their perfection.\r\n\r\nI have not, in the following pages, undertaken to treat _all_ of the\r\nevents of our experience from 1816 to 1860. The space allowed me would\r\nnot admit of that. And even if it had, I still would have selected\r\nonly those events which, in my opinion, are significant of our\r\nprogress in civilization, and, as I am writing a political history,\r\nonly those which are significant of our progress in political\r\ncivilization. The truthful record, connection, and interpretation of\r\nsuch events is what I call history in the highest sense, as\r\ndistinguished from chronology, narrative, and romance. Both necessity\r\nand philosophy have confined me to these.\r\n\r\nI cannot close these prefatory sentences without a word of grateful\r\nacknowledgment to my friend and colleague, Dr. Harry A. Cushing, for\r\nthe important services which he has rendered me in the preparation of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nJOHN W.

I take up the threads of the narrative at the beginning\r\nof the year 1816, and my problem in this chapter will be to expound\r\nthe acts and policies of the Fourteenth Congress in the light of the\r\nexperiences of that War.\r\n\r\n{2} [Sidenote: General character of the acts of the Fourteenth\r\nCongress.]\r\n\r\nThose acts and policies were shaped and adopted under the influence of\r\nthose experiences, and this influence was so predominant, at the\r\nmoment, in the minds of the leading men in the Government and\r\nthroughout the country as to exclude, or at least to overbalance, all\r\nother influences. This is especially manifest in the attitude of the\r\nstatesmen of the slave-holding Commonwealths, and most especially in\r\nthe attitude of their great leader, Mr. Calhoun, who was the chief\r\nchampion of some of the most national measures voted by that Congress.\r\nA clear appreciation of his views and his acts at that period of his\r\ncareer will enable us far better than anything else to understand the\r\nterrible seriousness of the slavery question, which subsequently drove\r\nhim into lines of thought and action so widely divergent from those\r\nupon which he set out in early life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madison's message of December 5th, 1815.]\r\n\r\nIt was the President himself, however, one of the chief founders of\r\nthe \"States' rights\" party, Mr. Madison, who set the direction toward\r\ncentralization in the Congressional legislation of 1815-17. In his\r\nannual message of December 5th, 1815, he recommended the increase and\r\nbetter organization of the army and the navy, the enlargement of the\r\nexisting Military Academy and the founding of such academies in the\r\ndifferent sections of the country, the creation of a national\r\ncurrency, the protection of manufactures, the construction of roads\r\nand canals, and the establishment of a national university.\r\n\r\nThis is a very different political creed from that promulgated by\r\nPresident Jefferson when the Republican party first gained possession\r\nof the Government at Washington. Then, decrease in all the elements of\r\npower in the hands of the central Government, and careful maintenance\r\nof all the rights and powers of the {3} \"States,\" were recommended and\r\nurged upon the attention of the national lawgivers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Change in the principles of the Republican party.]\r\n\r\nFrom a \"States'-sovereignty\" party in 1801, the Republican party had\r\nmanifestly become a strong national party in 1816; that is, if we are\r\nto take the two Presidential messages, to which we have referred, as\r\ncontaining the political principles of that party at these two periods\r\nof its existence.\r\n\r\nAs the Congress of 1801 showed itself, in its legislation, to be in\r\nsubstantial accord with President Jefferson's views and sentiments, so\r\ndid the Congress of 1815 manifest, in its legislation, the same\r\ngeneral harmony with the views and sentiments of President Madison. In\r\norder that the latter part of this statement may be set down as an\r\nestablished fact of history, we will review with some particularity\r\nthe two cardinal acts of this Congress--the United States Bank Act and\r\nthe Tariff Act.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The United States Bank Act of 1816.]\r\n\r\nSo soon as the reading of President Madison's message before the House\r\nof Representatives was completed, that body resolved to refer that\r\npart of the message which related to the establishment of an uniform\r\nnational currency to a select committee. The committee chosen was\r\ncomposed of Mr. Calhoun, Mr. Macon, Mr. Pleasants, Mr. Tucker, Mr.\r\nRobertson, Mr. Hopkinson, and Mr. Pickering. The first five of these\r\ngentlemen were from Commonwealths south of the Pennsylvania line, and\r\nonly two, therefore, from what began now to be called the\r\n\"non-slave-holding States.\" In other words, it was a Southern\r\ncommittee, and the great South Carolinian was its chairman. It is,\r\ntherefore, just to regard the bill which this committee brought in,\r\nand the arguments with which they supported it, as containing the\r\nviews and the sentiments of the leading Southern Republicans in the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n{4} [Sidenote: Report of the Bank Bill by Mr. Calhoun.]\r\n\r\nThis committee came speedily to the conclusion that the\r\nnationalization of the monetary system was the most pressing need of\r\nthe country, and within a month from the date of the appointment of\r\nits members the chairman of the committee reported a bill for the\r\ncreation of an United States Bank, a mammoth national banking\r\ncorporation, which should have a capital of thirty-five millions of\r\ndollars; in which the central Government should own one-fifth of the\r\nstock and be represented by one-fifth of the directors; the president\r\nof which should always be selected from among the Government's\r\ndirectors; the demand notes and bills of which should be received in\r\nall payments to the United States; and the chartered privileges of\r\nwhich should be made a monopoly for twenty years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Calhoun's argument in favor of the Bill.]\r\n\r\nIn his great argument in support of the bill, delivered on February\r\n26th, Mr. Calhoun dismissed at the outset any consideration of the\r\nconstitutionality of the bill. That is, he simply assumed that\r\nCongress had the power to pass the bill, and declared that the public\r\nmind was entirely made up and settled upon that point.\r\n\r\nOnly five years before this, even the national-minded Clay had\r\npronounced the dictum that Congress had no power to grant a national\r\nbank charter, and the fact that Congress then declined to grant such a\r\ncharter is good evidence that the majority of the people of the\r\ncountry held the same view. There can be little question that the\r\nRepublican party, down to 1812, regarded the establishment of an\r\nUnited States bank by Congress as an usurpation of power not granted\r\nby the Constitution.\r\n\r\nFive years constitute a short period of time for the accomplishment of\r\nso important a change in the public {5} opinion. Five years of\r\nordinary experience would not have produced it. It was, without doubt,\r\nthe strain brought upon the finances of the country by the necessities\r\nof the War that had developed a powerful national opinion upon the\r\nsubject of the financial system of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun also declined to discuss the question whether banks were\r\nfavorable or unfavorable to \"public liberty and prosperity.\" He\r\nassumed, here again, that public experience had settled that question,\r\nand said that such an inquiry was now purely metaphysical. This\r\nstatement is certainly prime evidence that the practical experiences,\r\nmade in conducting the Government under the pressure of war, had about\r\nknocked the metaphysics of the year 1800 out of the Republican party,\r\nand had led the party on to a much more positive stage of political\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun furthermore dismissed the question whether a \"national\r\nbank would be favorable to the administration of the finances of the\r\nGovernment,\" since there was not enough doubt, he said, in the public\r\nmind upon that point to warrant a discussion of it.\r\n\r\nHe declared, finally, that the only questions which demanded\r\nconsideration were those relative to the existing disorders of the\r\ncurrency, and the efficiency of a national bank in working their cure.\r\nUpon these two points he was distinct, decided, and thoroughly\r\nnational. He said that the Constitution had without doubt placed the\r\nmonetary system of the country entirely within the control of\r\nCongress; that the \"States\" had usurped the power of making money by\r\nchartering banks of issue in the face of the constitutional provision\r\nforbidding the \"States\" to emit bills of credit; that the two hundred\r\nmillions of dollars of irredeemable bank-notes, paper, and credits,\r\nissued by these banks, were the cause of the {6} financial disorders\r\nof the country; and that the remedy for this condition of things was,\r\nin his opinion, to be found in a great specie-paying national bank,\r\nsustained by the power of the general Government in the work of\r\nbringing such a pressure upon these \"State\" banks as would force them\r\neither to pay specie or go into liquidation. This was clear, generous,\r\nand patriotic. No one made a fairer statement of the case, and no one\r\nadvocated a more national remedy in its treatment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Webster's objections to the Bank Bill.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was Webster who, at this time, appeared narrow\r\nand particularistic. He objected to the large amount of the capital,\r\nand to the stock feature of the proposed bank, and expressed alarm at\r\nthe proposition to place it under such strong governmental control. He\r\nthought that the bills and paper of the \"State\" banks would be good\r\nenough, if the general Government would only force them to redeem\r\ntheir currency in specie by refusing to accept for Government dues the\r\nbills of banks which did not pay specie on demand.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of Webster's attitude from the point of view\r\nof political economy, it was certainly, from the point of view of\r\npolitical science, the attitude of a \"States'-rights\" man rather than\r\nthat of a nationalist. Webster did not, however, call the\r\nconstitutionality of the bill in question. That was conceded upon all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the measure felt more anxiety in regard to Mr. Clay. He\r\nhad, only five years before, as we have seen, pronounced a similar\r\nbill unconstitutional in his opinion, and he was now the Speaker of\r\nthe House, with all the power over the procedure in the House which\r\nthat position involved. It was generally felt that the fate of the\r\nmeasure would be largely determined by his attitude toward it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Clay's support of the Bank Bill.]\r\n\r\nMr. Clay did not leave the House long in doubt {7} concerning his\r\nviews. He quickly revealed and avowed that noted change of opinion\r\nupon this subject, which has been commonly accounted one of his\r\ngreatest inconsistencies, but which may be very properly considered as\r\nsimply manifesting that growth in patriotism and national spirit\r\nexperienced by almost all the leading men of the country, outside of\r\nNew England, in consequence of the vicissitudes of the period of war\r\nunder which the nation suffered between the dates of Mr. Clay's two\r\nutterances. He frankly confessed that he had changed his opinion, and\r\nexplained the change by saying that the power of Congress in respect\r\nto the matter was contained in the clause of the Constitution which\r\nconferred upon Congress the authority to make all laws necessary and\r\nproper for carrying the powers of the Government into operation; that,\r\nin the interpretation of the words \"necessary and proper,\" reference\r\nmust always be had to existing circumstances; that, when conditions\r\nchange, the interpretation must be so modified as to meet and satisfy\r\nsuch change; and that the conditions obtaining in the country in 1816\r\nwere so changed from those obtaining in 1811 as to require the\r\nenlarged interpretation of the powers of Congress under this clause\r\nupon the subject of the monetary system of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the Bank Bill by the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nThe eloquence and the influence of Mr. Clay counted heavily in favor\r\nof the measure, and it was passed by a substantial majority of votes.\r\nIn fact, the privileges of the proposed Bank had been increased by\r\namendment during the progress of the bill through the House. The Bank\r\nand its branches were made the depositories of the funds of the\r\nGovernment. This great advantage was, at least, a substantial offset\r\nto the other modifications of the original bill, whereby the clauses\r\nrequiring that the president of {8} the Bank should always be chosen\r\nfrom among the Government directors, and reserving to Congress the\r\npower to permit a temporary suspension of specie payment by the Bank,\r\nwere stricken out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the Bank Bill through the Senate.]\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of the bill through the Senate only a single\r\nSenator expressed any doubts of its constitutionality, Mr. Wells, of\r\nDelaware. Mr. Wells did not deny the power of Congress to charter a\r\nnational bank, but simply contended that the particular Bank proposed\r\nin the bill exceeded what was \"necessary and proper\" for carrying into\r\neffect the powers of Congress, and was therefore unconstitutional. On\r\nthe other hand, Senators Barbour, of Virginia, Taylor, of South\r\nCarolina, and Bibb, of Georgia, supported the measure, both in\r\nprinciple and in details, and carried it with a larger relative\r\nmajority through the Senate than it had received in the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The United States Bank of 1816 a Southern measure.]\r\n\r\nThe United States Bank of 1816 was thus a Southern measure, and\r\nCalhoun was its chief author. It was in principle a great national\r\nmeasure, and its creation by Congress is strong evidence of the great\r\ngrowth in national opinion and sentiment throughout the country, away\r\nfrom the national indifference of the Jeffersonian metapolitics of\r\n1800.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff of 1816.]\r\n\r\nA review of the Tariff Act of 1816 will bring us to the same\r\nconclusions concerning the great nationalizing influence of the War.\r\n\r\nThe rate of duty upon the principal articles of imported goods was,\r\nbefore the War, twelve and one-half per centum ad valorem. From a rate\r\nof five per centum upon these articles, imposed by the first Customs\r\nAct, that of July, 1789, the duty had been increased by about a dozen\r\nacts, passed by both Federal and Republican Congresses, until, in\r\n1812, it had reached the {9} above-mentioned per centum. Twelve and\r\none-half per centum was, as a fact, nothing more than a revenue duty,\r\nand was intended for nothing more by the party in power at that date.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the War double duties were imposed by the Act of\r\nJuly 1st, 1812, as a war measure, that is, as a measure for obtaining\r\nadditional revenue for the prosecution of the War. It was not intended\r\nas a measure for the protection of manufacturers. This Act was to\r\nexpire in one year, at the farthest, after the conclusion of peace\r\nwith England.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the Treaty of Ghent were exchanged on February\r\n17th, 1815. At the meeting of Congress, in December, 1815, the war\r\nduties were, therefore, still in force, but the Act establishing them\r\nwould expire by its own limitation in less than three months. This\r\nCongress was obliged, therefore, to deal with the tariff anew.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bill framed by the Committee on Ways and Means.]\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the President in regard to the matter were\r\nreferred to the committee of the House on Ways and Means, the regular\r\nrevenue committee. At that moment this committee was composed of seven\r\nmembers, four from Commonwealths south of Maryland, and three from\r\nthose north of Maryland. Mr. Lowndes, of South Carolina, was its\r\nchairman. It is fair, therefore, to call it a Southern committee, and\r\nto regard the bill which it produced as a Southern measure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff Bill reported.]\r\n\r\nThe committee first asked for a continuation of the existing duties\r\nuntil the thirtieth day of the following June, in order to give proper\r\ntime to mature the bill, which request was voted by both houses of\r\nCongress; and on March 20th, Mr. Lowndes announced that he was\r\nprepared to report the draft of the new Act. The measure contained\r\nvirtually the continuation of the war {10} tariff as the permanent\r\nrule and policy in time of peace. It was now manifestly a protective\r\ntariff, and it was intended to be such. Mr. Ingham of the committee\r\nsaid, at the beginning of the debate upon it, that \"its great primary\r\nobject was to make such a modification of duties upon the various\r\narticles of importation as would give the necessary and proper\r\nprotection and support to the agriculture, manufactures, and commerce\r\nof the country.\" He went so far as to say that revenue considerations\r\nought not to have any influence in the decision of the House upon the\r\ncommittee's propositions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The character of the Tariff Bill.]\r\n\r\nIt is entirely evident, however, that the committee did not regard the\r\nbill as proposing advantages for the manufacturers only, or as having\r\nfor its principal aim the increase of the wages of the employees in\r\nthe manufacturing establishments, but considered it a great national\r\nmeasure, a measure necessary to the industrial independence of the\r\ncountry. It is also evident that the bill was not thought by anybody\r\nto rest upon a perfect and permanent principle. Mr. Clay himself said\r\nof it, \"that the object of protecting manufacturers was, that we might\r\neventually get articles of necessity made as cheap at home as they\r\ncould be imported, and thereby to produce an independence of foreign\r\ncountries;\" that \"in three years we could judge of the ability of our\r\nestablishments to furnish those articles as cheap as they were\r\nobtained from abroad, and could then legislate with the lights of\r\nexperience;\" and that \"he believed that three years would be\r\nsufficient to place our manufacturers on this desirable footing.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Calhoun's speech upon the Tariff Bill.]\r\n\r\nIt was Calhoun again, however, who surpassed them all in broadness of\r\nview and in patriotic devotion to the interests of the nation. The\r\nimmediate occasion of {11} his speech was a motion made by John\r\nRandolph, which seemed to Mr. Calhoun to attack the principle of the\r\nbill. He said, that so long as the debate had been confined to\r\nquestions of detail he had refrained from joining in it; but now that\r\nthe general policy of the measure had been attacked he felt obliged to\r\ncome forward in support of that policy, which he could do with all the\r\nmore grace and sincerity since his own private interests were\r\nprimarily subserved by the advancement of agriculture, as were those\r\nof his section. He began his argument with the assertions that\r\ncommerce and agriculture were the chief sources of the wealth of the\r\ncountry at the moment, almost the only sources, and that manufactures\r\nmust be added to these in order to accomplish industrial independence.\r\nIn proof of this latter proposition he referred to the well known\r\neffect of war between a maritime power and the United States upon the\r\nprosperity of the latter. He simply pointed to the historic facts that\r\nsuch a war destroyed the commerce of the country with foreign powers,\r\nand that the destruction of commerce caused the products of\r\nagriculture, usually exported to pay for manufactured goods imported\r\nfrom foreign countries, to perish in the hands of the producers.\r\nDomestic manufactures, he contended, would not only relieve us from\r\ndependence upon foreign countries for manufactured goods, but would\r\ncreate home markets for agricultural products. Encouragement to\r\nmanufactures was, therefore, a sound national, a truly American,\r\npolicy. As Mr. Calhoun proceeded in his speech, his strong patriotism\r\nbecame more manifest. He affirmed that the policy of protection to\r\nmanufactures was calculated to bind more closely together the\r\ndifferent parts of our widely extended country, since it would\r\nincrease the mutual dependence of these different sections on each\r\n{12} other in proportion as it decreased their dependence on foreign\r\nmarkets. And he declared that he considered the production of this\r\nresult to be the most fundamental of all our policies, for the reason\r\nthat the absence of such mutual dependence would tend toward disunion,\r\nand disunion comprehended almost the sum and substance of our\r\npolitical dangers, against which, therefore, we ought to be\r\nperpetually guarded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the Tariff Bill.]\r\n\r\nCalhoun was in his thirty-fifth year when he advanced these views. The\r\nsentiments which they revealed cannot, therefore, be ascribed to the\r\nenthusiasm of youth and inexperience. They rested upon the settled\r\nconvictions of a mature man. They stand in need of no comment. They\r\nspeak for themselves. We shall search the reports of the debate in\r\nvain for anything wiser, nobler, or more patriotic. In comparison with\r\nthem the views pronounced by the New Englanders upon the subject\r\nappear narrow and selfish. They were willing to sacrifice the\r\nindustrial independence of the nation to their own interests in the\r\ncarrying trade upon the sea. Even the name of Webster is not to be\r\nfound among those who voted for the final passage of the bill. The\r\nmajority in its favor was, however, nearly two to one. In the Senate,\r\nthe vote was nearly four to one for it. Though Southern in its\r\nimmediate origin, it certainly had the support of the nation, and was\r\nregarded as a great measure of national independence. The opposition\r\nmade to it by Randolph and Telfair, and by the remnant of the New\r\nEngland Federalists, was regarded as unnational and unpatriotic. It\r\ncontributed to the complete disappearance of the Federal party from\r\nthe arena of national politics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Army and Navy Bills.]\r\n\r\nThis Congress gave, however, an even surer test of the growth of the\r\nnational spirit among the people than either the Bank Act or the\r\nTariff Act. It was the {13} series of acts for the increase of the\r\nArmy and the Navy, and for their thorough reorganization. The\r\nRepublican doctrine of 1800 was, that there was no need of a national\r\narmy; that the militias of the Commonwealths were a sufficient\r\nmilitary force; and that a standing army was dangerous to liberty. By\r\nthe Act of March 16th, 1802, Congress fixed the peace establishment at\r\ntwo regiments of infantry, and one regiment of artillerists, not more\r\nthan thirty-five hundred men. No increase of this force had been\r\npermitted between 1802 and 1812.\r\n\r\nDuring the War of 1812-15, the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, and Connecticut taught the nation how much, or rather how\r\nlittle, reliance was to be placed upon the militias of the\r\nCommonwealths in the defence of the country against foreign attack. In\r\nspite of the plain provision of the Constitution, and the Act of\r\nCongress in accordance therewith, empowering the President to call the\r\nmilitias of the Commonwealths into the service of the United States,\r\nthe Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut disputed the\r\nPresident's authority in this respect and refused compliance with his\r\norders. Well might the President complain that, even upon this most\r\nessential point, the military organization, the United States was not\r\na nation. With such an experience as this, Congress and the people\r\nwere thoroughly converted from the particularistic doctrinism of 1800,\r\nand now manifested their strong national spirit in the willingness to\r\nplace a large standing military force in the hands of the central\r\nGovernment in times of peace.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of March 3rd, 1816, Congress fixed the peace footing of the\r\nArmy at ten thousand men, excluding the corps of engineers; and by the\r\nAct of April 24th, of the same year, it reorganized, or rather {14}\r\nre-created, the general staff, upon the principle that the staff\r\nshould be as complete in time of peace as in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe Navy received similar attention and favor. By the Act of April\r\n29th, 1816, Congress appropriated eight millions of dollars for the\r\nconstruction of nine seventy-four-gun ships, twelve forty-four-gun\r\nships, and three steam batteries.\r\n\r\nEvidently the fear that the President would, by virtue of his power as\r\ncommander-in-chief of a large standing army and navy, declare himself\r\nemperor, and make the military and naval officers his dukes and\r\ncounts, had vanished in the smoke of the burned Capitol, and, in place\r\nof this silly terror of crowns and diadems, a thoroughgoing confidence\r\nin the national Government had established itself in the brain and\r\nheart of the people and of their leaders.\r\n\r\nThese great national measures occupied the attention of Congress to\r\nsuch a degree, during the session of 1815-16, as to delay the\r\nconsideration of the question of a system of national internal\r\nimprovements to the second session, that of 1816-17.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bill for National Improvements.]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of this session, Mr. Calhoun, again, came forward with\r\na motion for the appointment of a committee, which should consider the\r\nquestion of setting aside the bonus to be paid by the United States\r\nBank to the Government for its charter, and the net annual proceeds\r\nreceived by the Government upon its shares in the Bank, as a permanent\r\nfund for internal improvements. The motion was quickly carried, and\r\nthe committee, consisting of two members from the North and two from\r\nthe South, with Mr. Calhoun for chairman, was appointed. This was\r\nDecember 16th, 1816. In a week from this date the committee presented\r\na bill providing for the setting {15} apart of the funds above\r\nindicated for the construction of roads and canals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Calhoun's advocacy of this Bill.]\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun opened the debate upon the bill, and his speech abounded\r\nwith the same national ideas and patriotic sentiments which\r\ncharacterized his arguments in support of the Bank and Tariff\r\nmeasures. After asserting that the moment was most opportune for the\r\nconsideration of the question, on account of the fact that all party\r\nand sectional feelings had given way to \"a liberal and an enlightened\r\nregard for the general concerns of the nation,\" Mr. Calhoun again\r\npronounced his warning concerning the greatest danger to which the\r\ncountry was exposed, namely, disunion, and declared it to be the\r\nhighest duty of American statesmen so to form the policies of the\r\nGovernment as to counteract all tendencies toward sectionalism and\r\ndisunion. He contended that from this point of view nothing could be\r\nmore necessary or more advantageous than a large national system of\r\ninternal improvements, establishing the great lines of commerce and\r\nintercourse for binding together all the parts of the country in\r\ninterests, ideas, and sentiments.\r\n\r\nNo part of his argument, however, is so instructive to the student of\r\nAmerican constitutional history as the observations upon the question\r\nof the constitutionality of the bill. He said that he was no advocate\r\nof refined reasoning upon the Constitution; that \"the instrument was\r\nnot intended as a thesis for the logician to exercise his ingenuity\r\non; that it ought to be construed with plain good sense; and that when\r\nso construed nothing could be more express than the Constitution upon\r\nthis very point.\" The clause to which he referred was that which\r\nconfers upon Congress the power \"to levy and collect taxes, duties,\r\nimposts, and excises; to pay the {16} debts and provide for the common\r\ndefence and general welfare of the United States.\" Mr. Calhoun claimed\r\nthat these words were to be interpreted as vesting in Congress the\r\npower to appropriate money for the common defence and general welfare\r\nof the country at its own discretion, both as to object and amount. He\r\ninsisted that a generous interpretation of the power to raise and\r\nappropriate money was absolutely required, in order to avoid the\r\nnecessity of placing a forced construction upon other powers. It was\r\nall in his best strain, and showed Mr. Calhoun still as the chief\r\nadvocate of national union and national development. No other person\r\nseemed to equal him in breadth of view and purity of patriotism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The opposition to the Internal Improvements Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe measure met, however, with more opposition than the Bank Bill or\r\nthe Tariff Bill had experienced. Two years of peace had cooled the\r\nardor of the national spirit somewhat, and the people were dropping\r\nback into the narrow spheres of ordinary life and business routine.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the great hue and cry raised by the demagogues and the press\r\nover the bill, passed at the previous session, changing the pay of the\r\nmembers of Congress from a per diem of six dollars during attendance\r\nto an annual salary of fifteen hundred dollars, had made the members\r\ntimid about the appropriation of money, and disinclined to obligate\r\nthe Treasury to anything beyond absolutely necessary expenses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the Bill by Congress.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the great power and earnestness with which Mr. Calhoun\r\naddressed himself to the task of carrying the bill through its\r\ndifferent stages were crowned with success. It finally passed both\r\nHouses, in a slightly modified form, during the last week of the\r\nFourteenth Congress and of President Madison's second term.\r\n\r\n{17} [Sidenote: Veto of the Bill by the President.]\r\n\r\nTo the great surprise of the friends of the measure, the President\r\nreturned the bill to Congress on March 3rd, with his objections. These\r\nwere, summed up in a single sentence, that there was no warrant in the\r\nConstitution for the exercise of the power by Congress to pass such a\r\nbill. The President held that Congress could appropriate money only to\r\nsuch objects as were placed by the Constitution under the jurisdiction\r\nof the general Government. He, therefore, repudiated Calhoun's\r\nlatitudinarian view that Congress was referred to its own discretion\r\nmerely in the appropriation of money for the advancement of the\r\ngeneral welfare. He acknowledged the desirability of attaining the\r\nobject contemplated by the bill, and indicated that an amendment to\r\nthe Constitution, expressly conferring upon Congress the power in\r\nquestion, was the proper way to deal with the subject. He had, as we\r\nhave seen, recommended the consideration of the question of internal\r\nimprovements in both of his annual messages to the Fourteenth\r\nCongress, and it was chiefly for this reason that the veto was so\r\nunexpected. It is true that, in both of these messages, he had\r\nexpressed some doubt in regard to the power of Congress over the\r\nsubject, but it was supposed that this was only his cautious way of\r\napproaching a new thing, and that he would certainly defer to the\r\nviews of the Congressional majority.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that Mr. Madison belonged to the first\r\ngeneration of the Republicans, and that the principle of the party, in\r\nthe period of its origin, was strict construction of the Constitution\r\nin regard to the powers of the general Government. He had been driven\r\nby the younger men into the War, and into the national policies which\r\nit occasioned and produced, and it is at least intelligible that he\r\nreturned to his earlier {18} creed as the country settled down again\r\ninto the humdrum of ordinary life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of Congress to override the veto.]\r\n\r\nThe national Republicans looked upon his act, however, as an apostasy,\r\nand the House of Representatives repassed the bill by an increased\r\nmajority and with considerable feeling. The majority was still,\r\nhowever, not sufficient to overcome the veto, and thus the first\r\nearnest attempt to commit the nation to a general system of internal\r\nimprovements failed, failed through the resurrection of a spirit in\r\nthe retiring President, which was destined soon to take possession of\r\nmany who denounced it then as mean and narrow, and to lead the whole\r\ncountry back into those cramping tenets of particularism from which\r\nwar and bloodshed alone could deliver it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{19}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ACQUISITION OF FLORIDA\r\n\r\nThe Influence of Physical Geography upon Political Development--Defect\r\nin the Southern Boundary of the United States before 1819--The Treaty\r\nof Paris of 1763--The Boundary between Louisiana and\r\nFlorida--Occupation of Florida by the United States Forces during the\r\nWar of 1812--The Hold of the Spaniards on Florida Weakened by the War\r\nof 1812--The British Troops in Florida during and after the War of\r\n1812--Nicholls and his Buccaneer State in Florida--The British\r\nGovernment's Repulse of Nicholls' Advances--Destruction of the\r\nNicholls Fort by the United States Forces--The Seminole War--The Fight\r\nat Fowltown--The Seminole War Defensive--McGregor on Amelia\r\nIsland--General Gaines sent to Amelia Island--General Jackson placed\r\nin Command in Florida--His Orders--Jackson's Letter to President\r\nMonroe--Jackson's Operations in Florida--The First Treaty for the\r\nCession of Florida to the United States--Jackson's Popularity in\r\nconsequence of the Seminole War--The Attempt in Congress to Censure\r\nJackson--The same Attempt in the Cabinet--The Failure of the Attempt\r\nto Censure Jackson in Congress--Assumption of the Responsibility for\r\nJackson's Acts by the Administration--Jackson Triumphant--The Treaty\r\nof Cession Attacked in Congress, but Ratified by the Senate--Rejection\r\nof the Treaty by the Spanish Government--Resumption of\r\nNegotiations--The New Treaty Ratified by the Senate and by the Spanish\r\nGovernment--Political Results of the Seminole War.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was entirely natural that the quickening of the national spirit and\r\nthe growth of the national consciousness throughout the United States,\r\nin the decade between 1810 and 1820, had, for one of their results,\r\nthe {20} extension of the territory of the United States, at some\r\npoint or other, to its natural limits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The influence of physical geography upon political\r\ndevelopment.]\r\n\r\nThe element of physical geography always plays a large part in\r\nnational political development. The natural territorial basis of a\r\nnational state is a geographical unity. That is, it is a territory\r\nseparated by broad bodies of water, or high mountain ranges, or broad\r\nbelts of uninhabitable country, or climatic extremes, from other\r\nterritory, and possessing a fair degree of coherence within. If a\r\nnational state develops itself on any part of such a territory, it\r\nwill inevitably tend to spread to the natural limits of the same. It\r\nwill not become a completely national state until it shall have\r\nattained such boundaries, for a completely national state is the\r\nsovereign organization of a people having an ethnic unity upon a\r\nterritory which is a geographic unity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defect in the southern boundary of the United States before\r\n1819.]\r\n\r\nIn the second decade of this century, and down to the latter part of\r\nit, the United States had not acquired the territory of the country as\r\nfar as to the natural southern boundary east of Louisiana. This\r\nboundary was, of course, the Gulf of Mexico; but Spain held in quasi\r\npossession a broad strip, and then a long peninsula, of land along and\r\nwithin this boundary. In other words, the territory called Florida, or\r\nthe Floridas, was, politically, a colony of Spain, but geographically\r\na part of the United States. It was inhabited chiefly by Indian\r\ntribes. Spanish rule in this territory was, therefore, foreign rule,\r\nboth from the geographical point of view and the ethnical. Indian rule\r\nwas not to be thought of in the nineteenth century. There was but one\r\nnatural solution of the question. It was that the United States should\r\nannex this territory and extend the jurisdiction of the general\r\nGovernment over it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of Paris of 1763.]\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Paris of 1763 was the first great {21} international\r\nagreement which gave a fair degree of definiteness to the claims of\r\nEngland, France, and Spain, upon the North American continent. In this\r\nTreaty, France surrendered Canada, Cape Breton, and all claims to\r\nterritory east of the Mississippi River, from the source of the river\r\nto the point of confluence of the Iberville with it, to Great Britain.\r\nFrom this latter point, the boundary between the two powers was\r\ndeclared to be the middle line of the Iberville, and of the Lakes\r\nMaurepas and Pontchartrain, to the Gulf of Mexico. It is also\r\nexpressly stated in this Treaty that France cedes the river and port\r\nof Mobile to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn this same instrument, Spain surrendered to Great Britain Florida\r\nand every claim to territory east and southeast of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The boundary between Louisiana and Florida.]\r\n\r\nThe boundary between Louisiana and Florida had, to that time, been the\r\nRiver Perdido. After the cessions above mentioned to Great Britain,\r\nthe British Government united the part of Louisiana received from\r\nFrance with Florida, and then divided Florida into two districts by\r\nthe line of the River Appalachicola. That part lying to the west of\r\nthis river was named West Florida, and the part east of it was called\r\nEast Florida.\r\n\r\nBy a secret Treaty of the year 1762, which became known to the world\r\nsome eighteen months later, but whose terms were not executed until\r\n1769, France ceded Louisiana to Spain. After this, therefore, the\r\nNorth American continent was divided between Great Britain and Spain,\r\nand the line of division was, so far as it was fixed, the Mississippi\r\nRiver to the confluence of the Iberville with it, then the Iberville\r\nand the middle line of the Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the\r\nGulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n{22} The Treaty of 1762 between France and Spain, having been\r\nconcluded before the Treaty of 1763 between France and Great Britain,\r\ngave Spain a certain show of title to the territory between the\r\nMississippi and the Perdido; but the Treaty of 1763, in which France\r\nceded this same territory to Great Britain, was, as we have just seen,\r\nknown first, and was the Treaty which France executed in respect to\r\nthis territory. The conflict of claims between Great Britain and\r\nSpain, which was thus engendered, continued to be waged for twenty\r\nyears, and was settled in the year 1783, in so far as these two powers\r\nwere concerned, by the recession of Florida to Spain.\r\n\r\nIn this same year, Great Britain recognized the independence of the\r\nUnited States, with a southern boundary extending from the point where\r\nthe Mississippi River is intersected by the thirty-first parallel of\r\nlatitude, along this parallel to the River Appalachicola, thence down\r\nthe Appalachicola to its confluence with Flint River, thence on the\r\nline of shortest distance to the source of the River St. Mary, and\r\nthence by the course of this stream to the Atlantic. Spain thus held,\r\nas the result of these several treaties, all of the territory south of\r\nthis line, unless England reserved in her recession of Florida that\r\nportion of Louisiana lying between the Iberville and the Perdido,\r\nceded by France to Great Britain in the Treaty of 1763, and united by\r\nGreat Britain with Florida. There is no evidence in the text of the\r\nTreaty of 1783 that Great Britain made any such reservation, or in the\r\nsubsequent actions of the British Government.\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of St. Ildefonso, of October 1st, 1800, also a secret\r\ntreaty, Spain receded Louisiana to France. The description of the\r\nterritory thus receded was very vague. It reads in the official\r\ntranslation of the treaty, {23} \"His Catholic Majesty promises and\r\nengages, on his part, to cede to the French Republic, six months after\r\nthe full and entire execution of the conditions and stipulations\r\nherein relative to his Royal Highness the Duke of Parma, the Colony or\r\nProvince of Louisiana, with the same extent that it now has in the\r\nhands of Spain, and that it had when France possessed it; and such as\r\nit should be after the treaties subsequently entered into between\r\nSpain and other states.\"\r\n\r\nThere was here certainly opportunity for a dispute between Spain and\r\nFrance as to the correct boundary between Louisiana and Florida.\r\nFrance could claim with some reason the Perdido as the eastern\r\nboundary of Louisiana, and Spain could meet this with a counterclaim\r\nthat, after the cession in 1763 of all Louisiana east of the Iberville\r\nand the Lakes to Great Britain, and its union by Great Britain with\r\nFlorida, the line of the Iberville and the Lakes Maurepas and\r\nPontchartrain was the eastern boundary of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, any actual contest arose over the question, France\r\nsold Louisiana to the United States, with the same vague description\r\nof boundary contained in the cession of the territory from Spain to\r\nFrance by the Treaty of St. Ildefonso. The question of boundary became\r\nnow one which must be settled between Spain and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe United States claimed at once that Louisiana reached to the\r\nPerdido. Spain disputed the claim, and held that Florida extended to\r\nthe Iberville and the Lakes. Spain could make out the better abstract\r\nof title. Spain certainly did not intend to recede to France in 1800\r\nanything more as Louisiana than France had ceded to her in 1762. But\r\nthe United States had a show of legal title. It could be held that the\r\nancient boundary of Louisiana was the one intended both in the Treaty\r\n{24} of St. Ildefonso and in that of 1803, in which France passed the\r\npossession of Louisiana to the United States. The reasons of physical\r\ngeography and of national development certainly favored the annexation\r\nof the whole of Florida to the United States; and with such forces to\r\nback the apparent legal claim to a large part of it, the result of the\r\ndispute could not well have been otherwise than it was.\r\n\r\nThe United States enforced its claim by military occupation of the\r\ndisputed district before the close of the War of 1812.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occupation of Florida by the United States forces during\r\nthe War of 1812.]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the war, the British forces had occupied\r\nPensacola. The Spanish governor either could not, or would not,\r\nprevent them from doing so. Florida became thus, in spite of its\r\nnominal neutral status, a base of operations for the enemy of the\r\nUnited States. No more convincing evidence of the necessity for its\r\nannexation to the United States could have been offered. It was thus\r\nseen that not only the geography and the national growth of the Union\r\ndemanded it, but that the safety of the Union, in case of war with any\r\npower, required it. The sea is the natural boundary of the United\r\nStates on the south, and it was the \"manifest destiny\" of the Union to\r\nreach it.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Florida would have been a sound and justifiable\r\npolicy for the United States, had the Government commanded a\r\nsufficient military force for the purpose, when the British troops\r\ntook possession of Pensacola. General Jackson did expel the British\r\nfrom Pensacola, but restored the place to the Spanish authorities, in\r\norder to avoid a conflict with Spain while engaged in war with Great\r\nBritain. We know now that the Congress of the United States had, by\r\nsecret acts passed before the beginning of the War, authorized the\r\n{25} President to occupy Florida _east_ of the Perdido temporarily.\r\nThe President did not deem it wise, under the circumstances which\r\nprevailed, to make use of this power; but the readiness of the\r\nCongress to intrust the President with the authority to take\r\npossession of the territory of a friendly power certainly shows that a\r\nstrong feeling existed among the representatives of the people that\r\nFlorida must be acquired by the United States upon the first fair\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hold of the Spaniards on Florida weakened by the War of\r\n1812.]\r\n\r\nThe occasion was destined soon to appear. The power of Spain upon the\r\nAmerican continents was everywhere in rapid decline. At the close of\r\nthe War of 1812, the Spanish occupation in Florida was confined\r\nsubstantially to three points--Pensacola, St. Mark's, and St.\r\nAugustine. The remainder of the province, by far the greater part of\r\nit, was a free zone, in which desperate adventurers of every race and\r\nland might congregate, from which they might make their raids for\r\nmurder and pillage into the United States, and into which they might\r\nescape again with their prisoners and plunder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The British troops in Florida during and after the War of\r\n1812.]\r\n\r\nWe have noticed the occupation of Pensacola by the British troops\r\nduring the War of 1812, and their expulsion by General Jackson from\r\nthis position in November of 1814. After this, they concentrated upon\r\nthe Appalachicola and established a fort some fifteen miles above the\r\nmouth of this stream for their head-quarters and base of operations.\r\nThe British commander, one Colonel Nicholls, pursued from this point\r\nthe policy which he had already inaugurated at Pensacola. This policy\r\nwas the collection and organization of fugitive negroes, Indians, and\r\nadventurers of every character, and their employment in raids into the\r\nterritory, and attacks upon the inhabitants, of the United States.\r\n\r\n{26} It appears that Colonel Nicholls did not regard the Treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain concluding the War as\r\nputting an end necessarily to his hostile movements. He remained in\r\ncommand at his fort on the Appalachicola for several months after the\r\nratification of the Treaty, and then went to London, taking with him\r\nthe Indian priest Francis, for the purpose of securing a treaty of\r\nalliance between the British Government and his band of outlaws in\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nicholls and his buccaneer state in Florida.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Appalachicola, he had incited the Indians and their\r\nnegro auxiliaries to continue hostilities against the United States,\r\nby representing to them that the ninth article of the Treaty of Ghent\r\ncontained a pledge on the part of the United States to reinstate the\r\nIndians in all lands held by them in the year 1811. He represented to\r\nthem that this provision restored to the Creeks the lands in southern\r\nGeorgia surrendered by them to the United States in the Treaty between\r\nthe Creeks and the United States made at Fort Jackson in August of\r\n1814, although it was well understood by both of the high contracting\r\nparties to the Treaty of Ghent that only those lands were intended\r\nunder this provision whose seizure by the United States had not been\r\nconfirmed by an agreement with the Indians; and the pledge as to these\r\nonly was conditioned upon the immediate cessation of hostilities on\r\nthe part of the Indians when the Treaty of Ghent should be announced\r\nto them. This announcement had been made, and the actual continuation\r\nof hostilities, therefore, after the announcement, made this whole\r\narticle nugatory.\r\n\r\nNicholls left the fort, with all its munitions, in the hands of the\r\nnegroes and Indians. The garrison {27} consisted of some three hundred\r\nnegroes and about twenty Indians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The British Government's repulse of Nicholls' advances.]\r\n\r\nThe British Government would not listen to Nicholls' proposition for\r\nan alliance between Great Britain and the buccaneering state which he\r\nwas endeavoring to establish upon territory belonging politically to\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destruction of the Nicholls Fort by the United States\r\nforces.]\r\n\r\nThe United States Government waited a year and a half for the\r\ndisbanding of this hostile force, or for its dispersion by the Spanish\r\nauthorities, and then, when forbearance had ceased to be a virtue, did\r\nthe work itself. The fort was destroyed by the explosion of its\r\nmagazine, which was pierced by a red-hot shot from the batteries of\r\nthe assailants, and almost the whole garrison perished. It was claimed\r\nthat the attack was made by the United States forces with the consent\r\nof the Spanish authorities, whatever the significance of that may have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nProfessor von Holst, in his great work, has designated the expedition\r\nagainst the Nicholls Fort as a hunt by the United States army for\r\nfugitive slaves. He does not seem to have recognized the danger to the\r\npeace and civilization of the United States of the growth of a\r\ncommunity of pirates and buccaneers upon its borders. It does not\r\nappear to have occurred to him that the most humane attitude toward\r\nthe slaves of Georgia may have been to prevent them from being drawn\r\ninto any such connection. He does not seem to have comprehended that\r\nany public interest was subserved by disposing of the negroes captured\r\nin this expedition in such a way as to prevent any future attempts on\r\ntheir part at co-operation with the Indians in their barbarous warfare\r\nupon the frontiers of the United States. In a sentence, he seems to\r\nhave regarded the entire incident as a prostitution of the military\r\npower of the United States to the private greed of {28} slave-hunters,\r\nand to have discovered in it a most convincing proof of the canting\r\nhypocrisy of the free Republic. In view of all the facts of the case,\r\nthis certainly appears to be a very crude appreciation of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seminole War.]\r\n\r\nThis same historian calls the attack upon the Nicholls Fort the\r\nbeginning of the Seminole War. It appears, however, more like the\r\ntermination of the War of 1812, so far as the negro outlaws of Florida\r\nwere participant in that War, than like the beginning of a new war.\r\nGenerals Gaines and Jackson and the War Department of the Government\r\nseem to have so comprehended the event.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the Nicholls Fort, or the Negro Fort, as it\r\nwas then called, there was comparative peace, for a few months, on the\r\nfrontier. With the beginning of the year 1817, however, hostilities\r\nwere renewed. It is not known which party gave the first offence.\r\nEx-Governor Mitchell of Georgia, then holding the office of Indian\r\nagent for these parts, thought both parties equally at fault. The\r\npoint is a matter of little moment. The conflict between civilization\r\nand barbarism is irrepressible, and arises as often from the\r\nencroachments of civilization as from the onslaughts of barbarism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fight at Fowltown.]\r\n\r\nIn November of 1817, General Gaines endeavored to secure an interview\r\nwith the chief of the hostile Indians, but the chief refused to visit\r\nthe General, whereupon the General sent a detachment of soldiers to\r\nthe chief's village, called Fowltown, to repeat his invitation, and to\r\nconduct the chief and his warriors to a parley-ground. The soldiers\r\nwere fired upon by the Indians as they approached the village. They\r\nnaturally returned the fire, and then seized and destroyed the\r\nvillage. A few Indians were killed in the conflict.\r\n\r\n{29} The Indian agent, Mitchell, called this event the beginning of\r\nthe Seminole War. It was certainly something more like it than was the\r\ncapture of the Negro Fort. Still it will be more correct to consider\r\nit as being only the continuation of the War of 1812, in so far as the\r\nparticipation in that War of Great Britain's Indian allies on the\r\nsouthern border of the United States was concerned. They had never\r\nreally resumed the status of peace after acting during that War, at\r\nthe instigation of the British officers in Florida, against the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seminole War defensive.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the fight at Fowltown hostilities became much more active.\r\nFowltown was situated north of the Florida line, upon territory ceded\r\nby the Creeks to the United States in the Treaty of Fort Jackson. If,\r\ntherefore, the incident of November 20th was the beginning of the\r\nSeminole War, it stamps that War as defensive in its character. The\r\ntroops of the United States were attacked upon the territory of the\r\nUnited States. If the further prosecution of the War should, in the\r\njudgment of the President, or of the officer whom he might vest with\r\ndiscretionary power in the execution of his will, require the crossing\r\nof the Florida line and the pursuit of the enemy upon Florida\r\nterritory, the character of the War could not be changed thereby. This\r\ncould not be regarded as making war on Spain. Spain could meet and\r\nsatisfy the right of the United States to do this only by dispersing\r\nthe Indians herself, and preventing Florida from becoming a base of\r\nhostile operations against the United States. Spain could claim the\r\nrights of neutrality for Florida only when she discharged these duties\r\nof neutrality. The general principles of international custom required\r\nthat of her. When, now, we add to this the consideration that Spain\r\nhad pledged {30} herself in a specific agreement with the United\r\nStates to do these very things, and that Florida, nevertheless, was\r\nactually a free zone, over which no civilized state had any efficient\r\ncontrol, then it certainly appears that the right of the United States\r\nto pursue its enemy into Florida was clearly in keeping with the\r\nrecognized law of nations. The President, therefore, ordered the\r\npursuit of the enemy into Florida, under the qualification that if\r\nthey took refuge in a Spanish fortification the fortress should not be\r\nattacked, but the situation should be reported to the War Department\r\nand further orders awaited. This order was issued on December 16th,\r\n1817, to General Gaines, who was then in command of the forces on the\r\nFlorida frontier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McGregor on Amelia Island.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an adventurer by the name of McGregor had, with a band of\r\nfreebooters, taken possession of Amelia Island, which lies off the\r\ncoast of Florida, just below the mouth of the St. Mary's River, and\r\nhad, in the name of the Governments of Buenos Ayres and Venezuela,\r\nproclaimed the independence of Florida against Spain. They made the\r\nisland an entrepot for the smuggling of slaves into the United States,\r\na storehouse for the results of their robberies, and head-quarters\r\ngenerally for piratical expeditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Gaines sent to Amelia Island.]\r\n\r\nBy a secret act of the year 1811, the Congress of the United States\r\nhad declared its unwillingness to have Florida, or any part of it,\r\npass from the hands of Spain into those of any other power, and had\r\nauthorized the President to prevent it. Acting upon this authority,\r\nthe President instructed General Gaines to go to Amelia Island and\r\ntake possession of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Jackson placed in command in Florida. His orders.]\r\n\r\nAbout ten days later, December 26th, 1817, the President assigned\r\nGeneral Jackson to the command of the {31} troops acting against the\r\nIndians. The day before the issue of the order to General Jackson, the\r\nWar Department had received the news of the Indian attack upon\r\nLieutenant Scott's boat while ascending the Appalachicola with\r\nsupplies for the United States troops at Fort Scott. The cold-blooded\r\nmassacre of almost the entire crew of the boat apparently moved the\r\nWar Department to more energetic measures. The order to General\r\nJackson, besides investing him with the command, empowered him to call\r\non the Governors of the adjacent Commonwealths for such military\r\nforces as he might deem necessary, with those already in the field, to\r\novercome the Indians, and informed him that General Gaines had been\r\ninstructed \"to penetrate from Amelia Island, through Florida, to the\r\nSeminole towns, if his force would justify his engaging in offensive\r\noperations.\" \"With this view,\" the order to Jackson continues, \"you\r\nmay be prepared to concentrate your forces, and to adopt the necessary\r\nmeasures to terminate a conflict which it has ever been the desire of\r\nthe President to avoid, but which is now made necessary by their\r\nsettled hostilities.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's letter to President Monroe.]\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson received these orders he was in Tennessee. He wrote\r\nimmediately to the President: \"Let it be signified to me through any\r\nchannel (say Mr. J. Rhea) that the possession of the Floridas would be\r\ndesirable to the United States and in sixty days it will be\r\naccomplished.\" General Jackson naturally supposed that this letter was\r\nduly received and read by President Monroe, and that a subsequent\r\norder, giving him discretionary powers in the prosecution of the\r\ncampaign, contained the answer to it. As we shall see, however, the\r\nPresident claimed later that he did not read Jackson's letter until a\r\nyear after it was written and sent to him. It was certainly {32} the\r\nPresident's fault if he did not. General Jackson certainly could not\r\nbe held accountable for the President's strange negligence in\r\nexamining official correspondence, and he had good reason to think,\r\nfrom the tone of the order issued to him after his letter had had due\r\ntime to be received and read, that the Administration desired him to\r\noccupy Florida.\r\n\r\nUpon taking command Jackson called his Tennessee veterans to him, and\r\nreached with them the Florida frontier in March of 1818.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's operations in Florida.]\r\n\r\nWhen he advanced into Florida he found that the Spanish officials in\r\nFlorida were in collusion with the Indians, and that the instigators\r\nof the hostilities were an Englishman, named Ambrister, and a\r\nScotchman, named Arbuthnot, together with two Indian chiefs named\r\nHillis Hajo and Himallemico.\r\n\r\nAn order from the War Department, of January 16th, 1818, instructed\r\nthe commander of the United States forces in Florida that the honor of\r\nthe nation required a speedy termination of the War with the\r\nSeminoles, \"with exemplary punishment for hostilities so unprovoked.\"\r\nJackson naturally considered himself empowered to do speedy and\r\nthorough work. He felt it necessary to seize St. Mark's and Pensacola,\r\nin order to destroy the base of operations and the places of refuge of\r\nthe enemy, and he caused the four ringleaders of the enemy to be\r\nexecuted. By the end of May (1818) the campaign was ended, and Florida\r\nwas in the military possession of the United States. The President\r\nassumed the responsibility for Jackson's deeds, but offered to restore\r\nSt. Mark's and Pensacola, and therewith the nominal possession of\r\nFlorida, to Spain, so soon as Spain would garrison these points with\r\nforces able to maintain peace with the United States and {33} disposed\r\nto do so. Spain accepted the offer, fulfilled in a way the conditions,\r\nand the places were restored to her jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLORIDA, at the Time of Acquisition.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first Treaty for the cession of Florida to the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nIt was now manifest to Spain, however, that she could not control\r\nFlorida, and that her possession of the province was, and could be,\r\nonly nominal. She now, therefore, agreed to cede it to the United\r\nStates. The treaty bears date of February 22nd, 1819. Its important\r\nprovisions are contained in the second and third articles. By these\r\narticles Spain ceded the Floridas, with the adjacent islands dependent\r\nthereon, to the United States; and agreed with the United States that\r\nthe boundary between the two powers in North America should be the\r\nwest bank of the Sabine River from its mouth to the thirty-second\r\nparallel of north latitude, thence the line of longitude to the Red\r\nRiver, thence up the course of the Red River to the one-hundredth\r\nparallel of longitude from London, or the twenty-third from\r\nWashington, thence the line of longitude to the Arkansas River, thence\r\nthe south bank of the Arkansas to its source, thence the line of\r\nlongitude to the forty-second parallel of north latitude, and thence\r\nthis line of latitude to the South Sea.\r\n\r\nThis settlement of boundary included that of all other claims, of\r\nwhatever character, of the Government, citizens, or subjects of either\r\npower against the Government, citizens, or subjects of the other. All\r\nsuch were mutually renounced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's popularity in consequence of the Seminole War.]\r\n\r\nThe results of the Seminole War raised General Jackson to a still\r\nhigher plane of popularity than he possessed as the hero of the War of\r\n1812. It was evident that here was a character who would have to be\r\nreckoned with in future presidential contests. It is possible that\r\nJackson's chief mentor, William B. Lewis, had {34} conceived, at this\r\ndate, the idea of Jackson's candidacy for the highest place in the\r\ngift of the nation. And it is highly probable that the fears of all\r\nthe existing aspirants for the presidency were excited by the\r\nappearance of this new and popular rival for public favor. It is\r\ndifficult to explain upon any other theory the attempt made in\r\nCongress, during the session of 1818-19, to suppress Jackson by a vote\r\nof censure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attempt in Congress to censure Jackson.]\r\n\r\nThis procedure certainly had no connection whatsoever with the\r\nquestion of slavery extension through the acquisition of Florida. When\r\nwe find Tallmadge, of New York, the self-same person who introduced,\r\nat the same session, the proposition for restricting slavery in\r\nMissouri, defending Jackson's course in every particular, while Cobb,\r\nof Georgia, attacked it, and when we consider that John Quincy Adams,\r\nthe life-long opponent of slavery, sustained Jackson in the cabinet,\r\nwhile Calhoun moved to bring him to account for disobedience to\r\norders, we are bound to conclude that we have here nothing whatsoever\r\nto do with the question of slavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The same attempt in the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nCrawford, of Georgia, the Secretary of the Treasury, was the prime\r\naspirant for presidential honors, after Monroe should have completed\r\nhis two terms, and Cobb was Crawford's right-hand man. Clay was also\r\nworking up his plans. These two men felt it necessary to discredit\r\nJackson in every possible way. Clay made a great bugbear out of\r\nJackson's military heroship, and so threatening did he make it appear\r\nto the principle of civil government and republican institutions that\r\nhe really seemed frightened at it himself. Crawford set up the same\r\nstrain, through Cobb, in a feebler key. Calhoun seems to have been\r\nanimated rather by wrath at what he {35} conceived to be the violation\r\nof his orders, or, at least, the exceeding of his orders, than by\r\njealousy of a presidential rival. His presidential fever had not, at\r\nthat moment, reached a high degree. But what shall we say of Adams,\r\nwho undoubtedly then considered himself a candidate for the\r\nsuccessorship to Monroe, and who stood against the whole Cabinet in\r\nJackson's defence, and carried the day against both Crawford and\r\nCalhoun combined. Of course it may be said that Adams thought his own\r\nturn would come before that of Jackson, and that he would gain\r\nJackson's support by his attitude. But against such a supposition must\r\nstand the fact that the Cabinet pledged itself to secrecy in regard to\r\nall that was proposed on the subject, and that for ten years Jackson\r\nsupposed that Calhoun was the friend in the Cabinet who had\r\nsuccessfully defended him against the other members under the lead of\r\nCrawford. The attitude of Adams in the question was noble and\r\ndisinterested, as well as patriotic, and had Jackson known of it in\r\n1824, it is altogether probable that he would never have charged an\r\nunfair bargain with Clay upon Adams for his own defeat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of the attempt to censure Jackson in Congress.]\r\n\r\nClay and Cobb represented that every movement made by Jackson, from\r\nthe moment of his appointment to the command of the expedition to the\r\nend of hostilities, was illegal and in defiance of the orders of the\r\nWar Department. They said he had no right to call upon his old\r\nsoldiers instead of asking the Governor of Tennessee for the militia.\r\nThey claimed that he waged an offensive war upon his own\r\nresponsibility against Spain, when the War Department had expressly\r\nforbidden him to attack the Spanish forts, and they accused him of\r\nmurdering two prisoners of war. The House of Representatives showed\r\nwhat it thought of these accusations by voting {36} down the\r\nresolutions which contained the censure by a majority of nearly two to\r\none, while the resolutions of like effect introduced into the Senate\r\nwere laid on the table and never taken up for consideration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assumption of the responsibility for Jackson's acts by the\r\nAdministration.]\r\n\r\nThe Administration had, under the influence of the Secretary of State,\r\nMr. Adams, already assumed the responsibility for Jackson's acts, had\r\nupheld their legality, and was even then bringing its negotiations\r\nwith Spain, in regard to the cession of Florida, to a successful\r\nclose; while the British Government had refrained from any\r\ninterference on account of the treatment of Ambrister and Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson triumphant.]\r\n\r\nThe attempt to suppress Jackson broke down thus upon all sides, and he\r\nemerged from the assaults of his rivals with a greater popularity than\r\nhe had ever before enjoyed, and with improved prospects as a\r\npresidential candidate. With the worship accorded to a hero he now\r\nenjoyed the sympathy extended to a martyr.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of Cession attacked in Congress, but ratified by\r\nthe Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe Treaty itself, ceding the Floridas, did not escape attack. Adams\r\nregarded it as a great diplomatic triumph for the United States, but\r\nClay expressed great disappointment with it, because it sacrificed, as\r\nhe viewed it, the claims of the United States to the territory between\r\nthe Sabine and the Rio del Norte. And Crawford, who was seizing every\r\nopportunity to discredit the Administration, by encouraging it to\r\nfalse measures from his place in the Cabinet, and then professing\r\npublicly his disapprobation of them, also saw in the point emphasized\r\nby Clay a prime occasion for making political capital.\r\n\r\nThe Senate showed what its members thought of such manoeuvres by a\r\nspeedy and unanimous vote in ratification of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n{37} [Sidenote: Rejection of the Treaty by the Spanish Government.]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government, on the other hand, rejected the Treaty. Mr.\r\nAdams felt, at the moment, that this was a blow to his reputation as a\r\ndiplomatist, and perhaps to his chances for the presidency. But it did\r\nnot prove to be such. Had the Treaty been then ratified three large\r\nland grants made by the Spanish King to certain Spanish nobles, at a\r\ndate earlier than Mr. Adams had supposed, would not have been\r\nextinguished by it. The rejection of the Treaty by the Spanish\r\nGovernment, which at the same time sent another Ambassador, General\r\nVives, to take the place of Don Onis, and to renew negotiations on the\r\nsubject, gave Mr. Adams the opportunity to insist upon the cession of\r\nFlorida with the extinguishment of the above mentioned grants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resumption of negotiations.]\r\n\r\nWhen the new Ambassador arrived, the country was in the midst of the\r\nexcitement over the question of slavery extension in the Louisiana\r\nterritory, the history of which will be related in a succeeding\r\nchapter. The effect of this agitation was to arouse some doubt in the\r\nminds of those opposed to the extension of slavery in regard to the\r\nexpediency of any addition to the territory of the United States\r\nsouthward. Mr. Adams himself felt the influence of this doubt, and was\r\nprompted, in part at least, by it to assume an attitude of\r\nindifference toward the new propositions of the Spanish Ambassador. He\r\ngave the Ambassador to understand that Spain could make such a treaty\r\nwith the United States in regard to the subject as would be\r\nsatisfactory to the latter, or take the consequences of leaving things\r\nas they were. The unshakable determination of Mr. Adams won the day,\r\nand the old Treaty, with a new provision extinguishing the above\r\nmentioned land grants, was finally ratified by both Governments, two\r\nyears after the date of {38} the original agreement between Mr. Adams\r\nand Don Onis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new Treaty ratified by the Senate and by the Spanish\r\nGovernment.]\r\n\r\nThe vote of ratification by the Senate of the United States was again\r\npractically unanimous. Only four votes were recorded against it; and\r\nof these four one was cast by a brother-in-law of Mr. Clay, one by a\r\nsubservient friend of the same gentleman, and one by a bitter personal\r\nenemy of General Jackson. The province was soon transferred to the\r\nUnited States and Jackson became its first territorial governor. With\r\nthis the United States attained its natural boundary on the south,\r\neastward from the mouth of the Mississippi, and a source of chronic\r\nirritation was removed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political results of the Seminole War.]\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that this territory would be erected into a\r\nCommonwealth in which the institution of slavery would be legalized;\r\nbut this did not deter the statesmen of the North from securing the\r\ngreat advantages just indicated. Radical abolitionism had not yet\r\nblinded them to the general and paramount interests of the Union. In\r\nfact, the results of the Seminole War and of the diplomacy of the\r\nAdministration in connection with it had the immediate effect of\r\ndiminishing the ultra-Southern influence in the Government. They\r\nbrought Adams and Jackson to the front, and set Crawford and Calhoun\r\nback in the course of their careers. They had, indeed, much to do, as\r\nwe shall see later, with the development of the era of personal\r\npolitics, which prevailed from 1824 to 1832, and which terminated\r\nfinally in the separation of the all-comprehending Republican party\r\ninto the Whig party and the Democratic party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{39}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE 1820\r\n\r\nFirst Appearance of Slavery in the British North American\r\nColonies--Early Theory of the Benefits of Slavery--The Earliest Legal\r\nRecognition of Slavery in the Colonies--Northern Colonies not well\r\nAdapted to Negro Labor--The Southern Colonies well Adapted to Negro\r\nLabor--Negro Slavery a Temporary Necessity in the South--Was Negro\r\nSlavery an Error and an Evil from the first?--Slavery Legislation in\r\nthe Southern Colonies--Partus Sequitur Ventrem--Definitions of the\r\nSlave Class--The Test of the Slave Status as Fixed by the Virginia\r\nStatute--The Legal Position of the Slave--Tendency Toward Serfage in\r\nthe Code of 1705--Public Relations of the Slave System--The General\r\nObject of the Laws in respect to Slaves--Slavery and the Revolutionary\r\nIdeas of the Rights of Man--First Prohibition upon Slave\r\nImportation--Abolition of Slavery in the Northern Commonwealths after\r\nthe Beginning of the Revolution--Slavery and the Constitution of\r\n1787--Reaction against the Humanitarian Principles of the\r\nRevolution--Abolition of the Foreign Slave-trade by Congress--Cotton\r\nCulture and the Cotton-gin--The Effect of the Return to the Arts of\r\nPeace upon the Ideas Concerning Slavery--Slavery During the War of\r\n1812 and the Years just before and just after this War--Slavery in the\r\nLouisiana Territory--Slavery in the territory West of North Carolina\r\nand Georgia--Slavery in Louisiana a Different Question from Slavery in\r\nthe North Carolina and Georgia Cessions--Interest in Slavery in\r\nMaryland and Virginia Increased by the Acquisition of Louisiana--The\r\nDomestic Slave-trade--The Relation of Slavery to the Diplomacy of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to define the term slavery in the abstract without\r\nunfitting it for application to the great majority {40} of the systems\r\nof servitude which have ever existed. Especially will it be difficult\r\nto gain a correct conception of the relation between the white man and\r\nthe negro in North America previous to 1860 by means of such a\r\ndefinition.\r\n\r\nThe institution of negro slavery in the United States was an\r\nhistorical growth, which was in some respects unique. We shall,\r\ntherefore, do better to follow the main stages of that development\r\nthan to attempt at the outset any definition whatsoever. We may, in\r\nthis manner, build up a true description of it, and escape the error\r\nfrequently contained in the brevity of a definition and in the nature\r\nof an abstract proposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First appearance of slavery in the British North American\r\ncolonies.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early theory of the benefits of slavery.]\r\n\r\nIt began its existence, like most institutions and relations, as a\r\nsocial custom. Most of the historians record the appearance of a Dutch\r\nmerchant ship at Jamestown, in the year 1619, having negroes on board,\r\nand inform us that twenty of them were sold to the colonists. What\r\ntitle the Dutch traders had to such property, exactly what they sold\r\nto the colonists, and what rights the colonists acquired in or over\r\nsuch property, were defined, guaranteed, and secured by no existing\r\nstatutes. If any of the parties to the transaction reflected upon\r\nthese subjects at all, they must have supposed that the right of\r\npossession and the freedom of contract covered the whole case. There\r\nis certainly no evidence that any of these parties, or anybody else,\r\nhad the faintest conception that the law of any state, or any\r\nprinciple of natural justice, or of reason, was violated or impaired\r\nby the procedure or the results of the procedure. It was a firmly and\r\nuniversally established opinion of the time that the attachment of\r\ninfidels to Christians in a relation of servant to master was vastly\r\nbeneficial to the infidel, certainly so when {41} the infidel was also\r\na barbarian, and was taken out of slavery to a barbarian master, as\r\nwas the case in respect to almost all of the negroes brought to the\r\nEnglish colonies in North America.\r\n\r\nWe cannot dismiss this opinion as one of the errors of the dark ages.\r\nIt lives to-day as a principle of modern political science and\r\npractical politics, under the form of statement that civilized people\r\nhave the right and duty to impose civilization upon uncivilized\r\npopulations by whatever means they may deem to be just and proper.\r\n\r\nThere can be no reasonable doubt that the negroes transferred from\r\nslavery in Africa to slavery in the English-American colonies\r\nthemselves felt the amelioration of their condition, and were, in\r\ngeneral, entirely contented with their new lot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The earliest legal recognition of slavery in the colonies.]\r\n\r\nThe relation was established in the Northern colonies, as well as in\r\nthe Southern, in the early years of their existence, and it was in\r\nMassachusetts rather than in Virginia that it first received legal\r\nrecognition, and began to be changed from a purely domestic\r\ninstitution by suffering governmental regulation. In the Massachusetts\r\n\"Fundamentals,\" or \"Body of Liberties,\" passed by the General Court in\r\n1641, the slavery of negroes and Indians, and the slave-trade, were\r\nexpressly legalized. In fact, so far as the colonists themselves were\r\nresponsible for the introduction of negro slavery among them, the\r\nimpartial historian must place the greater blame upon a Northern\r\ncolony. Its citizens were first to develop commerce, and it was their\r\nships which brought the slave cargoes from the coasts of Africa to all\r\nof the colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Northern colonies not well adapted to negro labor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Southern colonies well adapted to negro labor.]\r\n\r\nThe negroes were not, however, fitted for labor in the Northern\r\ncolonies. In the first place, it was too cold for them to thrive\r\nthere. A warm, moist air is the natural climate for the negro. In the\r\nsecond place, the {42} work to be done in these sections was not\r\nsuited to his capacity. The Northern colonies had not, indeed, at that\r\nearly day, developed the finer forms of industry which have\r\nsubsequently distinguished that part of the country. They were then,\r\nas to their internal pursuits, almost as completely agricultural as\r\nthe colonies of the South. But their farming required a great deal\r\nmore of intelligence, thrift, and industry in the laborer than the\r\nnegro of that day possessed. The country was broken, the good soil was\r\nlimited in amount, the weather was capricious, and the management of\r\nthe crops demanded judgment and discretion. On the other hand, the\r\nvast level areas of good soil, the warm, uniform climate, and the\r\nsimple crops of the Southern colonies furnished the conditions\r\nfavorable to the employment of negro labor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Negro slavery a temporary necessity in the South.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to see how the rich swamp-lands of these colonies could\r\never have been reclaimed and made tributary to the civilization of the\r\nworld in any way but by the employment of negro labor. And it is no\r\neasier to see how the pure negro could then have been brought to do\r\nthis great work save through slavery to the white race, save by being\r\nforced to contribute the muscular effort, under the direction of the\r\nsuperior intelligence of the white race, to the realization of objects\r\ndetermined by that superior intelligence. The negro is proof against\r\nmalaria, and thrives under the burning sun. The white man is destroyed\r\nby the former and greatly disabled by the latter. And the pure negro\r\nwould not at that period of his development labor voluntarily. These\r\nwere the elements of the problem which confronted those who undertook\r\nto subject the vast marshes of the Southern colonies to cultivation\r\nand to prepare them for the {43} production of their most valuable\r\ncontributions to the comforts of civilized man. The solution of the\r\nproblem was negro slavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was negro slavery an error and an evil from the first?]\r\n\r\nWe are most of us inclined, at this day, to hold that this was an\r\nerroneous solution, and that we could have discovered a better one;\r\nbut it was the solution which was reached, and we shall be wiser if we\r\nseek to understand it clearly, instead of wasting our energies in its\r\ncondemnation, remembering that many of the things of the past, which,\r\nfrom the point of view of the present, we are prone to regard as\r\nerror, and even as sin, are only anachronisms. In fact, those who\r\nfounded the colony of Georgia thought _then_ that they had a better\r\nsolution of the problem. They prohibited slavery at the outset from\r\nthat colony. In fourteen years they came to regard this act as a great\r\nmistake, and the noblest spirits among them acknowledged themselves in\r\nerror, and joined in the movement for the introduction of negro\r\nslave-labor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery legislation in the Southern colonies.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions above mentioned were undoubtedly the chief causes of\r\nthe more rapid and pronounced development of negro slavery in the\r\nSouthern colonies. And that more rapid and pronounced development\r\ndirects us rather to the legislation of the Southern colonies than to\r\nthat of the Northern, in following the legalization of the relation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Partus sequitur ventrem.]\r\n\r\nVirginia naturally took the lead, and furnished the precedents for the\r\nothers. The first question, both as to time and importance, which\r\nrequired legislative treatment, was the question of the status of the\r\nchildren of slaves. Where legalized marriage does not exist, the only\r\ncertainty in respect to parentage is attained by regarding the mother.\r\nRights and status in such a condition of society are, therefore,\r\ntransmitted through the female line. _Partus sequitur ventrem_ is the\r\nrule {44} not only of the civil law, but of every system of law\r\nregulating the accidents of descent among people where the mingling of\r\nthe sexes is not controlled by civilized marriage. Insuperable\r\nobstacles present themselves in the attempt to apply any other rule.\r\nIt was no unusual or arbitrary enactment of the Virginia legislature\r\nwhich, in 1662, prescribed the rule that the status of the slave\r\nmother should determine that of her offspring. This rule was followed\r\nin all the colonies, and many of them enacted it into statute law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definitions of the slave class.]\r\n\r\nSo long as the slaves were few in number and were not Christians the\r\nnecessity for legislation defining the slave class was not felt; but\r\nso soon as the slave-trade became more active, and slaves began to\r\nreceive Christian baptism, the old customary test in regard to this\r\nmatter, that of infidelity or heathenism, would no longer suffice. The\r\ncolonists of that day were too conscientious to cut the knot of this\r\ndifficulty by denying Christian baptism to any one seeking it. They\r\nconsidered it their prime duty to lead the heathen to the knowledge of\r\nChrist. It is evident that their consciences were greatly troubled\r\nover the question of the effect of Christian baptism upon the slave\r\nstatus. The colonial legislatures, the Home Government, and the Bishop\r\nof London were appealed to for counsel in the dilemma. The answers\r\nreceived from all of these were to the effect that the status of the\r\nslave was not changed by Christian baptism or conversion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The test of the slave status as fixed by the Virginia\r\nstatute.]\r\n\r\nThe test of the slave status was then necessarily fixed by\r\nlegislation. The Virginia statute declared all servants brought into\r\nthe country by land or sea, who were not Christians in their native\r\ncountry at the time when they were purchased or procured, nor free in\r\n{45} England or some other Christian country, to be slaves. Exception\r\nwas made of Turks and Moors in amity with the King. This statute,\r\ntaken together with the rule _partus sequitur ventrem_, which rule was\r\nre-enacted, became the test of the slave class. At the same time heavy\r\npenalties were attached to the marriage or cohabitation of white women\r\nwith slaves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The legal position of the slave.]\r\n\r\nOf course it very soon became necessary that the legal position of the\r\nslave should be definitely fixed. The legislature of Virginia again\r\nset the precedents. Concisely stated, this legislation provided that a\r\nslave could have no standing in the ordinary courts, either as party\r\nor witness; that a slave could own no property; that a slave owed\r\nobedience to the master, who might force the slave to labor, and\r\nchastise the slave even to the extreme of so injuring the slave that\r\nthe slave might die in consequence thereof, without incurring the\r\npenalties of felony; that the slave could be sold or inherited as\r\npersonal property; and that the offspring of the female slave belonged\r\nto the master owning her at the time of its birth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tendency toward serfage in the Code of 1705.]\r\n\r\nThe wilful killing of a slave by anyone, even the master, was\r\naccounted murder, and extraordinary tribunals, without a jury, were\r\nconstituted for the protection of his person. The Code of 1705 even\r\ncontained regulations which indicated that the trend of thought and of\r\nlegislation, at that juncture, was toward attaching the slave to the\r\nsoil, which would have been a step upward in a course, which, if\r\nconsistently followed, would have made the slave a serf. But the still\r\nprevailing rules, which allowed the slave to be seized and sold for\r\nthe debts of the master, and regulated the inheritance of slaves\r\naccording to the {46} law governing the descent of personal property,\r\nseem to have completely neutralized that tendency before the middle of\r\nthe century had been reached.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public relations of the slave system.]\r\n\r\nNaturally the private law accidents of the relation were first\r\ndeveloped and fixed, but very soon the rights and powers of the\r\ncommunity in regard to the institution began to claim attention. The\r\npublic peace and welfare must be safeguarded against the possible\r\nconduct of the slave, on the one hand, and of the master, on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of Virginia set the example in these respects also.\r\nThat legislation provided that no slave should have, or carry arms, or\r\ngo outside of the plantation of his master without a pass from his\r\nmaster, or lift his hand against a Christian; that a sheriff should\r\narrest a runaway slave on the warrant of two justices, and might\r\nlawfully kill any slave who resisted arrest; and that no slave should\r\nbe emancipated without the consent of the Governor and Council.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it provided that the master should be responsible\r\nfor all damage done by his slave at any place where there was no\r\nChristian overseer, and required that any master giving freedom to his\r\nslave should pay the cost of his transportation out of the colony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The general object of the laws in respect to slaves.]\r\n\r\nSuch was substantially the law of negro slavery in all of the colonies\r\nat the beginning of the decade before the Revolution. It was perhaps\r\nmore severe than this in South Carolina, and it was certainly less so\r\nin Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe objects which it had in view were to secure the master's property\r\nin the slave, to enable the master to hold the slave in obedience and\r\nforce him, if necessary, to labor, and to protect the public peace and\r\nwelfare against the abuse of the relation by the master, and against\r\nthe vicious nature of the slave.\r\n\r\n{47} It does certainly appear that the century of law-making upon the\r\nsubject had not ameliorated the condition of the slave. We must\r\nremember, however, that the first stages in the legalization of any\r\nrelation sometimes make the situation appear worse than what obtained\r\nbefore the movement began, although it may not be worse in fact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery and the Revolutionary ideas of the rights of man.]\r\n\r\nBut the period of the Revolution brought with it a great change of\r\nview in regard to the morality of slavery, and this change of idea\r\nproduced great modifications in the law of slavery, all of which\r\ntended not only toward an improvement of the condition of the slave,\r\nbut also toward the ultimate extinction of slavery.\r\n\r\nWhen we regard the Revolution of the colonies against the motherland\r\nfrom the point of view of the present, we can easily see that its\r\npurpose was very different from that of the French Revolution. What it\r\nreally sought and accomplished was national independence against\r\nforeign rule. Those, however, who formulated the creed of the\r\nRevolution sought its justification in the doctrine of human rights\r\nrather than in that of national rights. The philosophy of the\r\neighteenth century was a humanitarian outburst. Politically and\r\nlegally it is summed up in the very misleading propositions that all\r\nmen are born equal and are endowed with freedom, and that the people\r\nhave the right to change or abolish existing government at their\r\npleasure. Whatever we may think of these doctrines now, our ancestors\r\nprofessed to believe in them, and there is no reason to doubt the\r\nsincerity of their profession, so far as their own consciousness went.\r\nThey saw also the inconsistency of slavery with these doctrines, and\r\nquickly came to regard slavery as an evil which should be removed as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\n{48} [Sidenote: First prohibition upon slave importation.]\r\n\r\nThe Continental Congress took the first step in this direction. Two\r\nyears before it declared independence it prohibited any further\r\nimportation of slaves, and repeated the prohibition two years later.\r\nThese acts are good evidence that, at the moment, the question of\r\nslavery was regarded as a matter of national concern.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was, however, so occupied with the duties pertaining to\r\nthe prosecution of the war, that it failed to go forward in this\r\nmatter, as well as in many other matters of national concern; and when\r\nthe Confederate Congress succeeded the Continental Congress, it did so\r\nupon the basis of a written constitution, or rather articles of union,\r\nwhich vested no powers whatsoever in it over the subject of slavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abolition of slavery in the Northern Commonwealths after\r\nthe beginning of the Revolution.]\r\n\r\nThe separate colonies, now become \"States\" by the theory of the\r\nArticles of Confederation, took up the question. Massachusetts\r\nabolished slavery substantially by her constitution of 1780.\r\nPennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation by a statute of the\r\nsame year. Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire followed the\r\nexample of Pennsylvania. And New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,\r\nand Virginia forbade any further importation of slaves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ordinance of 1787.]\r\n\r\nUnder such impulses and influences the Confederate Congress, in spite\r\nof the fact that no power in respect to slavery had been conferred\r\nupon it, assumed to pass the famous Ordinance of 1787, decreeing the\r\nfree status exclusively in all of the territory then belonging to the\r\nUnited States north of the Ohio River. The power to enact the\r\nOrdinance could not even be derived by the most generous principles of\r\nimplication from any provision in the Articles of Confederation. To\r\njustify the exercise of it by the Confederate {49} Congress it is\r\nnecessary to go back to the general principle of political science\r\nthat, as there was no government for this territory but the\r\nConfederate Congress, and as there were no limitations in the Articles\r\nof Confederation upon the powers of the Congress in this territory,\r\nthe powers of that Congress must have extended in this territory to\r\nall subjects usually regulated by government.\r\n\r\nThe claim sometimes made that this Ordinance was a treaty between the\r\n\"States\" forming the Confederation, or between them and the \"States\"\r\nto be formed out of that territory in the future, is altogether\r\nuntenable. It was nothing more nor less than a legislative act of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt is an incontrovertible proof of the universality and intensity of\r\nthe opposition to the farther spread of slavery that the common\r\nconsciousness of the age acquiesced in this most latitudinarian\r\nconstruction of the powers of the Confederate Congress, and that the\r\nCongress itself voted the measure with but a single dissenting voice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery and the Constitution of 1787.]\r\n\r\nAt the same moment that this measure was being considered in the\r\nCongress, the Constitutional Convention, sitting at Philadelphia, was\r\nframing the national Constitution of 1787. The attitude which the\r\nnation would assume in this new instrument of its organic law toward\r\nthe subject of slavery was one of the most, if not the most, important\r\nof the questions which the Convention was called upon to consider.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the men of 1787 had come to regard the\r\nquestion of the rights of man a little more calmly than they did\r\nduring the heat of the battle with the motherland. In Luther Martin's\r\nfamous letter to the legislature of Maryland upon the work of the {50}\r\nConvention of 1787, a very significant passage concerning the existing\r\nviews upon slavery occurs. He wrote: \"At this time we do not generally\r\nhold this commerce\" (the slave-trade) \"in so great abhorrence as we\r\nhave done. When our liberties were at stake we warmly felt for the\r\ncommon rights of men. The danger being thought to be past which\r\nthreatened ourselves we are daily growing more insensible to those\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1787 contains evidence of the correctness of this\r\nstatement. Among its provisions were to be found three most important\r\ncompromises with the slavery interest, three most important\r\nrecognitions of slavery. The first was political in its nature. It\r\ncounted the negro for three-fifths of the white man in the\r\ndistribution of the representation in the House of Representatives and\r\nin the Presidential Electoral Colleges. The second was commercial in\r\nits nature. It forbade the Congress to prohibit, before the year 1808,\r\nthe migration or importation of such persons as the existing \"States\"\r\nmight see fit to admit. The third was a direct guarantee of slave\r\nproperty. It required the surrender to his master of an escaped slave\r\nwherever found in the United States. These were most momentous\r\nprovisions. They secured slave property, increased slave property, and\r\nmade slavery a vast political power in the hands of the slave-masters.\r\nThere is no doubt that the clock of the ages was turned back full half\r\na century in regard to this great question by the Constitution of\r\n1787.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reaction against the humanitarian principles of the\r\nRevolution.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1787 to 1808 the reactionary course was pursued almost without a\r\nsingle break. Kentucky was made a Commonwealth with the slave status.\r\nThe Congress accepted from North Carolina and Georgia cessions of the\r\nterritory which lay to the west of them, and which they claimed as\r\nbelonging to them, with a condition {51} that slavery should not be\r\nforbidden therein by Congress. The slave Commonwealth of Tennessee was\r\nimmediately formed out of a part of this territory. The vast territory\r\nof Louisiana, in which slavery existed wherever it was inhabited, was\r\nadded to the domain of the Union. The District of Columbia, the seat\r\nof the general Government, was made a slave-holding community, through\r\nthe adoption by Congress of the laws of Maryland as the code of the\r\nDistrict. A fugitive slave-law was passed by Congress, which enabled\r\nany white man to seize, as his slave, any man of color, and bring him\r\nbefore any magistrate, and, upon proof satisfactory to the latter, to\r\ndemand such papers and certificates as would legally warrant him in\r\nreclaiming the slave and transporting him to the place whence he was\r\nsaid to have escaped; and petitions to Congress complaining of the\r\nabuse of this arbitrary power were laid aside without consideration.\r\nEven the Territory of Indiana prayed Congress to suspend for it that\r\npart of the Ordinance of 1787 which forbade slavery within its limits.\r\nAnd South Carolina abolished her law against the importation of\r\nslaves, and opened the way wide for a vast increase of the slave\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abolition of the foreign slave-trade by Congress.]\r\n\r\nThese last acts seem to have aroused the consciousness of the Congress\r\nto the rapidity with which the whole country was becoming again\r\nsubject to the slave-holding interests. The Congress resisted the\r\nimportunities of the Indiana leaders, and after giving South Carolina\r\na reasonable time to re-enact her law abolishing the foreign\r\nslave-trade, without effect, proceeded itself to abolish the trade\r\nfrom the first moment that the Constitution permitted this to be done,\r\nfrom January 1st, 1808.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cotton culture and the cotton-gin.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The effect of the return to the arts of peace upon the\r\nideas concerning slavery.]\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to ascribe the great revulsion {52} of view in\r\nregard to slavery, which certainly manifested itself everywhere in the\r\nUnited States between 1790 and 1807, to cotton culture and the\r\ncotton-gin. The invention of the cotton-gin, in the first part of the\r\nlast decade of the eighteenth century, and the increased demand for\r\ncotton fabrics throughout the world, had made the cultivation of\r\ncotton highly profitable. An increase in cotton culture was naturally\r\nencouraged by such enhanced profits, and this tendency produced an\r\nincreased demand for negro labor and for new lands, since the cotton\r\ncrop requires a warm climate and low lands, and exhausts the soil very\r\nrapidly. Those parts of the country adapted to cotton-raising felt,\r\ntherefore, a renewed interest in the increase of negro labor and in\r\nterritorial extension. And those parts not so adapted felt an indirect\r\ninterest in the same, since the increased and still increasing profits\r\nof the cotton culture made a market for their slaves and a carrying\r\ntrade for their shipowners. There is no doubt that such was the main\r\ncause of the great change of view in regard to the question of negro\r\nslavery which the country experienced between 1790 and 1810, but it\r\nwas not the sole cause. It was inevitable that, when the men of that\r\nera passed out of the excited state of mind and feeling produced by\r\nthe War with the motherland, and came to the task of re-establishing\r\nthe relations of peace and every-day life and business, they should\r\nregain a calmness of judgment, a respect for vested rights, and a\r\nregard for customary relations, which placed the political philosophy\r\nof 1776 under many limitations and qualifications, some of which,\r\ncertainly, were sound and valuable. It is only when we take all of\r\nthese considerations together that we comprehend the reasoning of the\r\nmen of the first decade of this {53} century upon the great question.\r\nThey saw a great interest developing which was bringing wealth and\r\ncomfort into an impoverished country. They knew that it could be then\r\nsustained only by negro labor. They did not believe that the negro\r\nwould work unless forced to it by the white man. They thought it was\r\nbetter for the negro himself to have food, clothing, and shelter, in\r\nslavery, than to starve, or become a robber, in liberty. They felt, on\r\nthe other hand, that the slavery of one human being to another was an\r\nexceptional relation in a political system which rested its own right\r\nto independent existence upon the doctrine of human freedom. It was\r\nnot, then, unnatural that they arrived at the conclusion that to\r\nprohibit further importations of the barbarians from Africa was the\r\nonly remedy for which the time was ripe. They sincerely believed that\r\nthey would place themselves and their slaves in a far more\r\nadvantageous position for the gradual elevation of the latter by\r\nhaving to deal only with negroes born and reared amid civilized\r\nsurroundings, and that freedom would finally be attained by all, as\r\nthe result of a gradual advancement in intelligence, morals, and\r\nindustry, and would be thus attained without any shock to the\r\ncivilization and welfare of the country.\r\n\r\nThis appeared to the men of that day, both of the North and of the\r\nSouth, to be the only safe way to proceed in solving the question of\r\nthe relation between the highly civilized Anglo-American race and the\r\ngrossly barbaric negro race in the United States. We think now that\r\nthey might have done better, and some of the more unsympathetic\r\ncritics of our history affirm that they did nothing of any\r\nconsequence, and that in what they did do they acted with a\r\nconsciously deceptive purpose. There may have been a few to whom this\r\ncriticism can be justly applied, but there is no {54} sufficient\r\nevidence that the mass of them were insincere either in act or\r\nthought. The contention that they were is more partisan than truly\r\nhistorical.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery during the War of 1812, and the years just before\r\nand just after this war.]\r\n\r\nThe decade between 1807 and 1817 was filled with the questions of\r\nforeign relations, of foreign war, and of the results of foreign war.\r\nThe suspension, and then the almost entire destruction, of foreign\r\ncommerce by the British Orders in Council, the Napoleonic decrees, the\r\nJeffersonian embargo, and the War of 1812, reduced the exportation in\r\ncotton from about fifty millions of pounds in 1807 to less than twenty\r\nmillions of pounds in 1814. The pecuniary interest in the maintenance\r\nof slavery declined thus quite materially, and the majority of the\r\nleading men, both North and South, still regarded negro slavery as\r\nonly a temporary status, which would be gradually modified in the\r\ndirection of freedom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery in the Louisiana territory.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, however, the slavery interest was steadily\r\nwaxing in influence and power throughout this period. First of all the\r\nexistence and the extension of slavery in the vast territory purchased\r\nfrom France was secured. The custom of slave-holding had been\r\nintroduced into this territory by the French and Spanish immigrants,\r\nwhile it was in the possession of France and Spain, before the year\r\n1800. In that year Spain, as we have seen, receded it to France. Nine\r\nyears before this date, slavery had been abolished in France by the\r\nNational Assembly. It is certainly a question, then, whether the\r\nre-establishment of French supremacy over Louisiana in 1800 did not\r\nproduce the abolition of slavery there. It will be remembered that\r\nFrance was at that moment subject to the consular government of\r\nBonaparte, and that the Consul was not an enthusiast for the\r\nrevolutionary ideals. He did not disturb the custom of slave-holding\r\n{55} in Louisiana, and when he ceded this vast territory to the United\r\nStates, in 1803, the custom existed in all its inhabited parts. The\r\nTreaty of cession contained a provision which pledged the Government\r\nof the United States to uphold the rights of property of the\r\ninhabitants of the province. It can be fairly said, therefore, that\r\nthe United States Government obligated itself to France to maintain\r\nslavery within the territory ceded until it should be erected into a\r\nCommonwealth, or into Commonwealths, of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government might have violated the Treaty, if it had\r\nchosen to do so, and the question then raised would have been one of a\r\npurely diplomatic or international character. There would have been no\r\nquestion of constitutional power involved. The act of the United\r\nStates Government breaking the Treaty would have been the law of the\r\nland for the inhabitants of this territory.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government, however, not only permitted the\r\ncontinuance of the custom of slave-holding in Louisiana, but when, in\r\n1804, Congress divided this vast region into two parts by the\r\nthirty-third parallel of latitude, and organized the southern portion\r\nas the Territory of Orleans, and placed the northern portion under the\r\njurisdiction of the Governor and judges of the Territory of Indiana,\r\nit, at the same time, authorized citizens of the United States\r\nimmigrating into the Territory of Orleans, for the purpose of actual\r\nsettlement, to take their slaves with them, and provided that the\r\nFrench laws in force at the date of the division should continue in\r\nthe northern part until repealed or modified by the Governor and\r\njudges of Indiana Territory. Any danger to slavery in this district of\r\nLouisiana, which might be contained in the power vested by Congress in\r\nthe Governor and judges of the Territory of Indiana to {56} repeal or\r\nmodify the French laws which Congress had allowed to continue in the\r\ndistrict, was overcome, the following year, by the independent\r\norganization of this district as the Territory of Louisiana, and by a\r\nprovision in the Act of Congress effecting this organization, which\r\nprovided for the continuance in force of the laws of the district,\r\nuntil repealed or modified by the legislature of the Territory.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, in 1812, the Territory of Orleans was erected into\r\nthe Commonwealth of Louisiana, and the name of the Territory of\r\nLouisiana was changed to Missouri, there was no question about the\r\nstatus of the new Commonwealth. It was, both in fact and in law, a\r\nslave-holding Commonwealth; and the custom of slave-holding was\r\nperpetuated in the newly named Territory by the provision in the Act\r\nof Congress that the laws and regulations of the Territory of\r\nLouisiana should remain in force in the Territory of Missouri until\r\nrepealed or modified by the legislature of the Territory of Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery in the territory west of North Carolina and\r\nGeorgia.]\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States had entered into obligations with\r\nNorth Carolina and Georgia, as we have seen, not to prohibit slavery\r\nin the territory ceded by them to the United States. Whatever we may\r\nthink of the binding force of any such agreement from a legal point of\r\nview, certainly from an ethical point of view it could have been urged\r\nthat the Government would have broken faith with some of the citizens\r\nof the United States had the Congress disregarded this understanding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery in Louisiana a different question from slavery in\r\nthe North Carolina and Georgia cessions.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be contended that there was any obligation, legal\r\nor moral, resting upon the Government of the United States toward any\r\nof the citizens of the United States, or any of the Commonwealths, to\r\nmaintain slavery in the province of Louisiana and in the {57}\r\nTerritories carved out of it. There was, as we have seen, a provision\r\nin the Treaty of cession of 1803, by which the United States\r\nGovernment obligated itself to France to protect the property of the\r\ninhabitants of the province. But the Government of the United States\r\nwas under no obligation to any citizen of the United States, or to any\r\nCommonwealth of the Union, to keep this Treaty inviolate. It may be\r\naffirmed, then, that the United States Government had, in the case of\r\nLouisiana, for the first time, permitted and maintained slavery in\r\nterritory where it was perfectly free to act in regard to this subject\r\nas it would, in so far as its own citizens were concerned. This\r\ncertainly manifested a great increase in the power of the\r\nslave-holders over the general Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interest in slavery in Maryland and Virginia increased by\r\nthe acquisition of Louisiana.]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this vast territorial extension of slavery the\r\ninterest of the more Northern of the old slave-holding Commonwealths\r\nin slavery was, during this period, greatly re-enlivened. Maryland and\r\nVirginia were already, in 1807, overstocked with slaves. The opening\r\nup of the virgin lands of the Southwest to the immigration of masters\r\nand slaves from the older Commonwealths, and the abolition of the\r\nforeign slave-trade, now made the Southwest an excellent market for\r\nthe surplus slave population of these older Commonwealths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The domestic slave-trade.]\r\n\r\nThe domestic slave-trade began now to be one of the chief sources of\r\nthe wealth of Maryland and Virginia especially. Those who participated\r\nin this traffic justified it by the claim that it was better for the\r\nslaves themselves to be removed to new homes, where they could be\r\nbetter supported, than to be kept in their old homes and suffer for\r\nthe want of the necessaries of life, and that the distribution of the\r\nslave {58} population over a larger area would make future\r\nemancipation easier, and less dangerous to the supremacy of the white\r\nrace. There was a certain force in this reasoning. The mass of the\r\nslave-holders seem to have been fully convinced of its soundness,\r\nalthough it did not entirely quiet the consciences of the best men\r\namong them to the many painful incidents connected with the separation\r\nof the slaves, made subject to this traffic, from their old homes and\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see, however, that the raising of negro slaves, having\r\nbecome a most profitable industry in the older Commonwealths, acted as\r\na vast bribe upon the ideas of men in regard to the questions of the\r\nperpetuation and extension of slavery, and beclouded their consciences\r\nin respect thereto.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The relation of slavery to the diplomacy of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the capture and abduction of negro slaves by the British\r\nforces during the War of 1812, and the demand of the slave-holders\r\nthat the United States Government should secure the restitution of\r\ntheir slaves, or compensation for the loss of them, from the British\r\nGovernment, moved the United States Government to assume its attitude\r\ntoward slavery in the administration of the international affairs of\r\nthe country. The cardinal political principle of the slave-holding\r\nstatesmen, at that period, was that slavery was a \"State\" matter with\r\nwhich the United States Government had no concern, and in regard to\r\nwhich it had no powers. This appeal to the Government to voice and\r\nenforce their demands against Great Britain in respect to their slave\r\nproperty has seemed, therefore, to some of the later and more radical\r\ncritics of American history to have been a gross inconsistency, and\r\nthey have represented it as a proof of the insincerity of the\r\nslave-holders wherever their pecuniary interests were involved.\r\n\r\n{59} This criticism is rather taking, but a sound view of the\r\nConstitution will hardly support it. In making the United States\r\nGovernment the _exclusive_ organ for dealing with foreign countries,\r\nthe Constitution impliedly confers upon that Government a protectorate\r\nagainst foreign states over interests which are regulated, internally,\r\nonly by the powers of the respective Commonwealths of the Union. It is\r\ntrue that this doctrine rests upon a national view of the federal\r\nsystem of government in the United States, a view which the\r\nslave-holding statesmen did not later share. From their later\r\nparticularistic principle of the fundamental character of the Union,\r\nsuch a general protectorate over \"State\" interests by the United\r\nStates Government against foreign countries could hardly be inferred\r\nfrom the Constitution. If this principle could be assumed by these\r\ncritics as having been held at that time by the slave-holding\r\nstatesmen, their charge of inconsistency, if not of insincerity, would\r\nbe fairly made out. But such, as we have seen, was not the case. Many\r\nof the slave-holding statesmen of 1816 were stronger in the national\r\nview of the character of the Union than were the statesmen of New\r\nEngland itself.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government recognized its duty to extend the\r\nprotection demanded in the case, and it secured from the British\r\nGovernment compensation to the masters for the loss of slave property\r\noccasioned by the acts of the British officers during the War.\r\n\r\nSuch was the status of the slavery question at the close of the War of\r\n1812-15, at the commencement, therefore, of the period when,\r\nwithdrawing themselves from foreign complications, the people of the\r\nUnited States began to adjust the different parts of their political\r\nsystem, chiefly if not solely, to the demands of their internal\r\ninterests, and to solve the problems of their {60} polity from the\r\npoint of view of their domestic institutions. It is not strange, then,\r\nthat from this point of time onward the powerful institution of negro\r\nslavery recognized more and more clearly its natural relations to all\r\nof these questions of internal policy and law, and sought more and\r\nmore determinedly to bring the political system and the policies of\r\nthe United States into accord with its own exclusive interests. For\r\nthe first three or four years after the close of the War this tendency\r\ndid not, as has been pointed out, appear upon the surface, but it was\r\nworking in the depths. From 1820 to 1861, certainly, it furnishes the\r\npoint of view for the correct elucidation of the majority of the great\r\nproblems of the history of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{61}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE CREATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MISSOURI\r\n\r\nThe Growth of Slavery not Seriously Checked by the Prohibition of the\r\nForeign Slave-trade--The General Government Powerless Against Slavery\r\nin the Existing Commonwealths--The Powers of the General Government in\r\nRespect to Slavery in the Territories--The Powers of Congress in the\r\nAdmission of new \"States\" into the Union--Slavery in the Missouri\r\nTerritory--The First Petition from Missouri Territory for the\r\nPermission to form a Commonwealth--The Second Petition, and the First\r\nBill in Congress, for the Admission of Missouri--The Tallmadge\r\nAmendment to the Bill--Passage of the Amendment by the House of\r\nRepresentatives--Passage of the Original Bill by the Senate--The\r\nMissouri Bill during the Session of 1819-20--Mr. Taylor's\r\nProposition--The Bill for the Admission of Maine Reported and Passed\r\nby the House of Representatives--The Failure of Mr. Taylor's Plan--The\r\nMissouri Bill again before the House of Representatives--Mr. Taylor's\r\nAmendment to the Bill--The Independent Missouri Bill of the\r\nSenate--The Refusal of the Senate to Disconnect the two Measures--The\r\nConference on the Subject, and the First Missouri\r\nCompromise--President Monroe's Approval of the Compromise--Review of\r\nthe Points Involved in the Contest--The Revival of the Missouri\r\nStruggle--The Missouri Constitution in Congress--Mr. Lowndes' Bill for\r\nthe Admission of Missouri with the Instrument Unchanged--Defeat of the\r\nLowndes Bill in the House--Passage of the Senate Bill with a Proviso\r\nby the Senate--The Senate Bill Tabled by the House--Mr. Clay and the\r\nSecond Missouri Compromise--Passage of the Second Missouri Compromise\r\nAct--The General Effects of the Decisions Reached in the Missouri\r\nQuestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The growth of slavery not seriously checked by the\r\nprohibition of the foreign slave-trade.]\r\n\r\nAlready before the year 1819, as we have seen in the preceding\r\nchapter, had it become manifest that the {62} influences and measures\r\nrelied upon by the forefathers for the ultimate extirpation of negro\r\nslavery were not effecting the desired result in the Commonwealths\r\nsouth of the line of Pennsylvania and of the Ohio. It was evident that\r\nthe revolutionary enthusiasm for universal liberty and the rights of\r\nman was not so strongly felt by the generation which grew up after\r\n\"'76\" as by the generation of \"'76,\" that the laws against the\r\nimportation of slaves were being evaded, and that the slaves were\r\nincreasing by birth many times more rapidly than they were decreasing\r\nby emancipation and removal to the colonies of the American Society\r\nfor Emancipation. Moreover, four new Commonwealths had been\r\nestablished--Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mississippi--in which\r\nslavery was legalized, and a fifth--Alabama--was even then in process\r\nof creation. It was manifest from all sides to the friends of\r\nuniversal freedom that other means than those hitherto relied upon\r\nmust be found, if any progress was to be made in the advancement of\r\nliberty, yea if the evident retrogression in respect to this prime\r\nelement of political civilization was to be checked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The general Government powerless against slavery in the\r\nexisting Commonwealths.]\r\n\r\nAll had been done by the United States Government, however, against\r\nslavery within the existing Commonwealths that the Constitution\r\nallowed. Before anything more could be undertaken, the Constitution\r\nitself would have to be so amended as to authorize it. The\r\nextraordinary majorities required for the initiation and adoption of\r\namendments made it practically impossible to effect anything by such\r\nmeans. Of the thirteen original Commonwealths, seven had abolished\r\nslavery and six had retained it. To these had now been added\r\nfour--Vermont, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois--in {63} which slavery was\r\nforbidden, and five in which it was permitted--Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--making thus the number upon each\r\nside the same. And although the population in the Commonwealths north\r\nof the line of Pennsylvania and the Ohio had outstripped, in increase,\r\nthat in those south of this line by near half a million of souls in\r\nthirty years, and the representation in the national House of\r\nRepresentatives stood consequently in favor of the former section in\r\nthe ratio of 104 to 79, still the method of representation in the\r\nSenate, and the equality in the number of the Commonwealths\r\npermitting, with those prohibiting, slavery, stood firmly in the way\r\nof any amendment of the Constitution, either favorable or unfavorable\r\nto the slavery interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The powers of the general Government in respect to slavery\r\nin the Territories.]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution furnished, however, an indirect way of reaching the\r\ndesired result. It gave the Congress general powers within the\r\nTerritories and did not restrict these powers in behalf of slavery.\r\nCongress might thus prohibit slavery in the Territories, and the\r\nTerritories would thus become settled by a free population, an\r\nanti-slavery population, which would form Commonwealths at the proper\r\ntime, in which the free status would be perpetuated by Commonwealth\r\nlaw. And when a sufficient number of free Commonwealths had been thus\r\ncreated to give the necessary majorities to amend the Constitution in\r\nthe direction of abolition, slavery might be extinguished in the\r\nCommonwealths which had already legalized it. But the first difficulty\r\nin the way of the effectiveness of this line of action was the fact\r\nthat Congress had already forfeited, in part, the opportunity, by\r\nfailing to keep the southern portion of Louisiana Territory under a\r\nTerritorial organization until slavery could have been eradicated in\r\nit. And it was probably, in {64} 1819, already too late to attempt to\r\nkeep the remaining parts of this vast region, so far as it had been\r\nsettled at all, under Territorial organization until this result could\r\nhave been effected. At least, the advocates of freedom in 1819\r\nevidently thought so, for they searched the Constitution to find some\r\nother power in the general Government by which to deal with the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The powers of Congress in the admission of new \"States\"\r\ninto the Union.]\r\n\r\nThere was another provision which had been already several times\r\napplied to this very subject and to other subjects. It was the\r\nprovision which conferred upon Congress the power to create, or\r\nco-operate in creating, new Commonwealths out of the Territories of\r\nthe United States. This power is expressed in general terms, and in\r\nits employment Congress had imposed a number of limitations upon the\r\npowers of the new Commonwealths which the Constitution did not impose\r\nupon those of the original Commonwealths. Here, then, was a possible\r\nway for those seeking the advancement of liberty to effect their\r\npurpose. If their interpretation of the Constitution, in regard to the\r\nextent of this power, was correct, and they could only command the\r\nPresident and a simple majority in both branches of Congress, they\r\ncould abolish slavery in every new Commonwealth at the time of its\r\ncreation, and make the continuance of the free status the perpetual\r\ncondition of its continued existence as a Commonwealth. It would then\r\nbe only a question of time when sufficient majorities would be secured\r\nfor so amending the Constitution of the United States as to expel\r\nslavery from the old Commonwealths through the regular forms for\r\nconstitutional development. It was an attractive scheme, and appeared\r\nto provide the means for ridding the country peaceably of its great\r\nevil at no very far distant day. It was the last possible means which\r\nthe Constitution afforded. It was {65} tried in the creation of the\r\nCommonwealth of Missouri and it failed. It is this which constitutes\r\nthe significance of the great movement. The result attained made the\r\nabolition of slavery by the United States Government, through legal\r\nand peaceable means, an utter impossibility. It contributed, at least,\r\ntoward making the War of 1861 an historical necessity.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in the preceding chapter, slaveholding had become\r\nestablished by custom in the vast region known as the Louisiana\r\nprovince, wherever it was inhabited, during the periods when it\r\nbelonged to Spain and France, and had been permitted to continue after\r\nits acquisition by the United States; and that in 1812 this province\r\nwas divided into one slave-holding Commonwealth, Louisiana, and one\r\nslave-holding Territory, Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery in the Missouri Territory.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1812 to 1818 Congress did nothing toward the extinction of\r\nslavery in the Missouri Territory, or preventing the free immigration\r\nof masters with their slaves into the Territory. Neither had the\r\nlegislature of the Territory done anything touching these subjects. It\r\nmay, therefore, be assumed that in the year 1818, the holding of\r\nnegroes as slaves was legal by custom, if not by positive law, in the\r\nwhole of the Missouri Territory, so far as it had been settled, and\r\nthat unless something should thereafter be done, either by the United\r\nStates Government or by the Territorial government, forbidding it,\r\nslavery would be likewise legal wherever the Territory might become\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first petition from Missouri Territory for the\r\npermission to form a Commonwealth.]\r\n\r\nBefore the beginning of the year 1818, the population in the Territory\r\nwhich looked to the town of St. Louis as its centre had begun to\r\nagitate the question of the establishment of Commonwealth government.\r\nDuring the Congressional session of 1817-18, petitions {66} appeared\r\nin the House of Representatives from this population, praying for the\r\nerection of that part of Missouri Territory, bounded roughly by the\r\nthirty-sixth parallel of latitude on the south, the line of longitude\r\npassing through the point of confluence of the Kansas River and the\r\nMissouri River on the west, the Falls of the Des Moines River and the\r\ncourse of that river on the north, and the Mississippi on the east,\r\ninto a Commonwealth of the Union. The petitions were referred and\r\nreported on, and the bill presented reached the stage for debate in\r\nthe committee of the Whole House, but was not taken up during the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second petition, and the first bill in Congress, for\r\nthe admission of Missouri.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the following session, that of 1818-19, the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives presented a memorial from the Territorial\r\nlegislature of Missouri which contained substantially the same prayer\r\nas the petitions presented at the preceding session. This memorial was\r\nimmediately referred to a committee for report, but the bill which\r\ngrew out of the petitions and the memorial was not brought forward for\r\ndebate in the committee of the Whole House until February 13th, 1819.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tallmadge amendment to the bill.]\r\n\r\nIt was upon this day, and during this first debate, that Mr. James\r\nTallmadge, of New York, offered the famous amendment to the bill,\r\nwhich precipitated a discussion, that lasted for more than a year,\r\nupon the great subject of the distribution of powers between the\r\nUnited States Government and the Commonwealths, a discussion in which\r\nall the great legal lights of both Houses of Congress participated,\r\nand during the course of which the whole country hung with painful\r\nanxiety upon the outcome. It was the first great trial of the\r\nConstitution under the issue of a domestic question, a question which\r\nthreatened to {67} divide the country upon geographic lines, a\r\nquestion which, therefore, threatened the dissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe exact words of this amendment are essential to a correct\r\ncomprehension of the question involved. It reads: \"And provided that\r\nthe further introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude be\r\nprohibited, except for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party\r\nshall have been duly convicted; and that all children born within the\r\nsaid State, after the admission thereof into the Union, shall be free\r\nat the age of twenty-five years.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The debate upon the Tallmadge amendment.]\r\n\r\nThe debate upon this motion is not fully reported in the annals of\r\nCongress, but it is sufficiently reported to give a correct idea of\r\nthe constitutional questions involved. The discussion proceeded from\r\nthe two points of view of constitutional powers and public policy. Of\r\ncourse the first point for the restrictionists, as those who favored\r\nthe amendment were termed, to establish was the constitutionality of\r\nthe power of Congress to impose this restriction in erecting a\r\nTerritory into a Commonwealth. If Congress has, or had, no such power,\r\nthe question of policy need not have been considered. They claimed the\r\npower, and based it upon that paragraph of Article IV. section three,\r\nwhich reads: \"New States may be admitted by the Congress into this\r\nUnion.\" It will be readily seen that this is a very loose statement\r\nconcerning the powers of Congress in establishing this most\r\nfundamental relation. Taken apart from all connections, its most\r\nnatural meaning is that foreign states may become politically joined\r\nwith the United States by an Act of Congress, in so far as this\r\ncountry is concerned. On the other hand, taken with the context, it\r\nappears to mean that Congress may establish Commonwealth governments,\r\nor, in the language {68} of the Constitution, \"States,\" upon the\r\nterritory belonging to the United States, or to some \"State\" or\r\n\"States\" already within the Union. This is, without any reasonable\r\ndoubt, its only meaning. For if it had any reference to the connection\r\nof foreign states with the United States, it would confer the most\r\nimportant diplomatic power of the United States Government upon the\r\nCongress, while the Constitution certainly confers the whole of this\r\nclass of powers upon the President and the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The exact question at issue in the first debate on the\r\nMissouri question.]\r\n\r\nThis was not, however, the point at issue in the Missouri question.\r\nThat point was, whether, in the creation of new Commonwealths by\r\nCongress upon territory already within the Union, and subject to the\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of the general Government, Congress had the\r\nconstitutional power to impose restrictions upon the new Commonwealths\r\nthus created, which the Constitution did not impose upon the original\r\nCommonwealths. The restrictionists, led by Mr. Tallmadge and Mr.\r\nTaylor, of New York, and Mr. Fuller, of Massachusetts, contended that\r\nCongress possessed this power. Their argument, reduced to a pair of\r\npropositions, was, that the Constitution did not _require_ Congress to\r\n\"admit new States into this Union,\" but only _empowered_ Congress to\r\ndo so at its discretion; that therefore Congress could _refuse_ to\r\nadmit at its discretion, and that if Congress could admit or refuse to\r\nadmit at its own discretion, it could admit upon conditions, upon such\r\nconditions as it might deem wise to impose, and could make the\r\ncontinued existence of the new Commonwealth, as a Commonwealth, depend\r\nupon the continued observance by it of these conditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The precedents cited in support of the Tallmadge\r\namendment.]\r\n\r\nThey pointed to the precedents of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, upon\r\nall of which Congress had imposed, as a {69} condition of their\r\nassumption of Commonwealth powers and government as \"States of the\r\nUnion,\" the requirement that their constitutions should not be\r\nrepugnant to the \"Ordinance of the Northwest Territory of 1787,\" the\r\nsixth article of which provided that there should be neither slavery\r\nnor involuntary servitude, except as a criminal penalty, in the\r\nTerritory, from which these Commonwealths were carved out. They\r\ncontended that Congress thus prohibited slavery in these new\r\nCommonwealths as the condition of its assent to their assumption of\r\nthe status of Commonwealths of the Union and of their continued\r\nexistence with that status.\r\n\r\nThey further pointed to the precedent of Louisiana, upon whose\r\n\"admission into the Union as a State,\" Congress imposed the conditions\r\nthat the new Commonwealth should use the English language as its\r\nofficial language, should guarantee the writ of _habeas corpus_ and\r\ntrial by jury in all criminal cases, and should incorporate in its\r\norganic law the fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Argument for the amendment from the duty of the United\r\nStates to guarantee a republican form of government to every\r\nCommonwealth.]\r\n\r\nThey went so far as to assert that the Constitution not only permitted\r\nCongress to lay the prohibition of slavery upon every new Commonwealth\r\nwhich it might \"admit into the Union,\" but obligated Congress to do so\r\nby the constitutional provision which makes it the duty of the United\r\nStates Government to guarantee a republican form of government to\r\nevery Commonwealth of the Union. That is, they claimed that slavery\r\nwas incompatible with the republican form of government, and that\r\nCongress was therefore bound by the Constitution to prohibit slavery\r\nwhenever called upon to act in regard to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Argument from morals and policy.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus, from their point of view, vindicated the {70}\r\nconstitutional power and duty of Congress to enact the restriction,\r\nthey claimed the personal liberty of every human being to be a\r\nself-evident principle of ethics, specifically recognized in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and therefore a principle of the\r\npolitical system of the United States. And, finally, they demonstrated\r\nthe ruinous policy of the system of slave labor in the economy of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that Mr. Tallmadge and his friends had taken\r\nstrong ground, and that it would require extraordinary efforts to\r\ndislodge them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Replies to the arguments of the restrictionists.]\r\n\r\nDuring the first debate upon the subject, the opponents of the\r\nrestriction do not seem to have been so clear in their own minds in\r\nreference to the principles involved as they became later, and their\r\narguments do not appear so convincing. Nevertheless, they touched the\r\npoint which was the real gist of the contention, and dealt with it\r\nably from the first. Mr. Scott, the delegate from Missouri Territory,\r\nand Mr. P. P. Barbour, of Virginia, made a vigorous attack upon the\r\nclaim of a power in Congress to enact the restriction, as a condition\r\nof admitting Missouri, \"as a State,\" into the Union. They demonstrated\r\nquite clearly that the interpretation which the restrictionists placed\r\nupon the constitutional provision empowering Congress \"to admit new\r\nStates into the Union\" would enable Congress to establish inequalities\r\n_ad libitum_ between the original Commonwealths and the new ones;\r\nwould, in principle, enable Congress to make mere provinces of the new\r\nCommonwealths. They showed conclusively that the real question of the\r\ncontroversy was not whether slavery should exist in Missouri or not,\r\nbut was whether the Commonwealth of Missouri should be allowed to\r\ndetermine that matter for herself or should have it determined for her\r\nby the {71} Congress of the United States. They pointed to the facts\r\nthat the original Commonwealths exercised, before the formation of the\r\nexisting Constitution of the United States, exclusive power over this\r\nmatter, each for itself; that the Constitution had not withdrawn this\r\npower from them, nor prohibited it to them; and that the Constitution\r\ndeclared all powers not delegated to the United States Government, nor\r\nprohibited to the \"States,\" to be reserved to the \"States\"\r\nrespectively or to the people. They, therefore, claimed that the\r\ndetermination of the question whether slavery should exist in any\r\nCommonwealth or not was a power reserved by the Constitution to each\r\nCommonwealth for itself, and that the attempt to introduce a\r\ndistinction between the old Commonwealths and the new, in regard to\r\nthe possession of this power, was an attack upon the first principle\r\nof federal liberty, the principle of equality in powers and duties\r\nbetween the members of the Union, an attack which could be justified\r\nlegally only by an express warrant from the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\nThey disputed outright the constitutionality of the restrictions in\r\nregard to slavery which Congress had imposed upon the Commonwealths of\r\nOhio, Indiana, and Illinois, and held that these Commonwealths might,\r\nat any time, so amend their organic law as to introduce slavery; and\r\nthey justified the restrictions imposed upon Louisiana as having\r\nexpress warrant from the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThey did not deny the claims of the restrictionists that slavery was\r\nethically wrong and economically destructive, but they contended that\r\nthe evil and the impolicy of it would be mitigated by allowing the\r\nslaves to be spread over a larger extent of territory, reducing thus\r\ntheir numerical ratio to the white population in the older\r\nCommonwealths, and enabling their masters {72} to emigrate with them\r\nfrom poor and exhausted lands to rich virgin soil, instead of being\r\nobliged to keep them in want, or sell them to new and, therefore, less\r\nconsiderate masters. They argued, upon this point, that all\r\nimportation of slaves from foreign countries having been strictly\r\nprohibited, not one slave could be added to the number already\r\nexisting by allowing their movement into new territory, but that their\r\ncondition would be vastly improved by the increased products of their\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pledge to maintain slave property in Louisiana in the\r\nTreaty of cession.]\r\n\r\nThey contended, finally, that the treaty with France by which\r\nLouisiana was ceded to the United States contained an express\r\nprovision pledging the United States Government to protect all the\r\nexisting property rights of the inhabitants of the province, and to\r\nadmit these inhabitants, so soon as consistent with the principles of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, to the enjoyment of\r\nCommonwealth powers on an equality with those of the other\r\nCommonwealths of the Union.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that hostility to slavery colored the views of\r\nthe restrictionists in regard to the constitutional powers of\r\nCongress, and there is also no question that the anxiety of the\r\nslaveholders to maintain the security of their property led them to\r\nexaggerate all of the defences of the Constitution in its behalf. It\r\nmust, however, be conceded that the opponents of the restriction had,\r\nfrom the outset, the better of the argument in the question of\r\nconstitutional law, and maintained it throughout the debate. They did\r\nnot express themselves as clearly and as exactly as the political\r\nscientist of this age would do, but they demonstrated quite\r\nconvincingly that the questions of political ethics and public policy\r\nwere, at the moment, entirely impertinent, unless it could be\r\nsatisfactorily established that Congress possessed the constitutional\r\npower to act in the {73} premises. And they showed that no federal\r\nsystem of government could exist, as to the new Commonwealths, if\r\nCongress had the unlimited authority to distribute powers between the\r\ngeneral Government and these Commonwealths, which the interpretation\r\nthat the restrictionists placed upon the clause of the Constitution\r\nvesting Congress with the authority to \"admit new States into this\r\nUnion\" involved.\r\n\r\nThe ethical and economical influences and considerations weighed more\r\nheavily in the minds of the Northern members than the arguments from\r\nconstitutional law, although they asserted that the Constitution also\r\nwas upon their side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the Tallmadge amendment by the House of\r\nRepresentatives.]\r\n\r\nThey carried the first part of Mr. Tallmadge's amendment, the\r\nprohibition upon the further introduction of slavery into Missouri, by\r\na majority of eleven votes, and the second part, the provision for the\r\nemancipation of all slaves born in Missouri, after its admission as a\r\nCommonwealth, when they should have reached the age of twenty-five\r\nyears, by a majority of four votes.\r\n\r\nThe leading men from the North who voted against the amendment were\r\nParrot, of New Hampshire, Holmes, Mason, and Shaw, of Massachusetts,\r\nStorrs, of New York, Bloomfield, of New Jersey, Harrison, of Ohio, and\r\nMcLean, of Illinois. They were strong and fearless men and no friends\r\nto slavery, but they were good constitutional lawyers, and they felt\r\nthat it was better to stand by the Constitution with slavery than to\r\nexpose it to the strain of exaggerated interpretations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Missouri bill in the Senate.]\r\n\r\nIt was upon February 17th, 1819, that the Missouri bill was finally\r\npassed by the House and sent to the Senate. It was immediately read\r\ntwice in the Senate and referred to the committee in charge of the\r\nbill for admitting Alabama.\r\n\r\n{74} On the 22nd, Mr. Tait, of Georgia, in behalf of the committee,\r\nreported the bill to the Senate, with the recommendation that the\r\nTallmadge amendment be stricken out.\r\n\r\nThe annals of Congress state that \"a long and animated debate\" took\r\nplace upon this recommendation, but the speeches are not reported. It\r\nmay be safely concluded, however, that the argument against the power\r\nof Congress to pass the amendment prevailed very decidedly in the\r\nminds of the members of this more calm and judicial body. They voted,\r\ntwenty-two to sixteen, against the first part of the amendment, and\r\nthirty-one to seven against the second part. Such men as Otis, of\r\nMassachusetts, and Lacock, of Pennsylvania, voted against the entire\r\namendment, and Daggett, of Connecticut, and even Rufus King, of New\r\nYork, recorded their voices against the second part of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the original bill by the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe bill admitting Missouri, without the Tallmadge amendment, passed\r\nthe Senate on March 2nd, and was returned to the House substantially\r\nin this form. The House immediately refused to agree to the striking\r\nout of the amendment, and the Senate resolved thereupon to adhere to\r\nits own act. The bill was thus lost for the session, and the Missouri\r\nquestion became the firebrand with which to light up fanatical and\r\nincendiary passions, both at the North and at the South, during the\r\nfollowing recess of the Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Missouri bill during the session of 1819-20.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the session of 1819-20, Mr. Scott secured the\r\nreference of the memorials concerning the admission of Missouri,\r\npresented at the preceding session, to a select committee. On the\r\nfollowing day, December 9th, Mr. Scott reported a bill from this\r\ncommittee, which authorized the inhabitants of that part of Missouri\r\nTerritory already described to form a constitution and Commonwealth\r\n{75} government. This new bill was read twice and referred to the\r\ncommittee of the Whole House for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The policy of the restrictionists to delay the admission of\r\nany new Commonwealths.]\r\n\r\nWarned by the experiences of the preceding session, the\r\nrestrictionists now took another tack. They developed the plan of\r\ndelaying the formation of any more Commonwealths in the Missouri\r\nTerritory until Congress could abolish slavery in the whole of it.\r\n\r\nDuring the debate of the preceding session upon the power of Congress\r\nto impose upon new Commonwealths, at the time of their creation,\r\nlimitations not prescribed by the Constitution, it had been asserted\r\nby the restrictionists, and not denied by their opponents, that\r\nCongress could control the status of the Territories, and keep slavery\r\nout of them or abolish it in them, at its own discretion, during the\r\nperiod before the Territories should be permitted to assume\r\nCommonwealth government. This seems to have been considered by nearly\r\nall, if not quite all, as a fair interpretation of that provision of\r\nthe Constitution which vests in Congress the power to make all needful\r\nrules and regulations respecting the Territories of the United States.\r\nThe friends of slavery restriction now determined to take advantage of\r\nthis possibility, even at this late day, and go back to the work of\r\nclearing all the Territories west of the Mississippi of slavery by a\r\nCongressional Act; after which the formation of new Commonwealths in\r\nthese Territories might be delayed until they could be settled by a\r\npopulation, which would, by local law, maintain the free status. Mr.\r\nJohn W. Taylor, of New York, seems to have formulated the plan. On the\r\n14th of December he moved the appointment of a committee to consider\r\nthe question of prohibiting the further introduction of slavery into\r\nthe Territories of the United States west of the Mississippi. The\r\nproposition was voted, and Mr. Taylor himself was {76} appointed the\r\nchairman of the committee. Mr. Taylor then moved that the\r\nconsideration of the Missouri bill be postponed to the first Monday of\r\nthe following February. The friends of this bill objected most\r\nstrenuously to this proposition, and Mr. Taylor's party compromised\r\nwith them by agreeing to shorten the period of the proposed\r\npostponement to the second Monday of January.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Taylor's proposition.]\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor's plan was moderate in its character. He did not propose to\r\nemancipate slaves already held within these Territories or their issue\r\nborn therein, but simply to prevent any further increase by\r\nimmigration or importation. It is difficult to see how the\r\nslaveholders themselves could have opposed this proposition with much\r\nvigor. They had, nearly all of them, professed to regard slavery as an\r\nevil, though they had suggested that the evil would be mitigated by\r\nthe spreading of the slaves over more territory. It was at any rate to\r\nbe expected that those Representatives and Senators from the North,\r\nwho had voted against the Tallmadge amendment from legal scruples\r\nonly, would join with the restrictionists in the support of Mr.\r\nTaylor's measure, since they all regarded slavery restriction as sound\r\npolicy wherever the Constitution would permit it. There certainly\r\nseemed to be a fair chance for the passage of a law which would\r\nprotect the Territories from, at least, any considerable increase of\r\nthe slave population which might already be within them, and give\r\nwhite immigration a chance to occupy and fill them, and form free\r\nCommonwealths in them. But this passing hope was dashed by a\r\nconjunction of events, the elements of which had already presented\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The petition from the convention in Maine for the admission\r\nof Maine.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill for the admission of Maine reported and passed by\r\nthe House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nThe people resident in that part of Massachusetts known as the\r\ndistrict of Maine had, through delegates in convention assembled,\r\nframed a Commonwealth constitution and government. The assent of\r\nMassachusetts {77} had been regularly given to the division of the old\r\nCommonwealth. And on December 8th, 1819, Mr. Holmes, of Massachusetts,\r\npresented to the House of Representatives a petition from the\r\nconstitutional convention in the district of Maine, praying for the\r\nadmission of Maine, as a Commonwealth, into the Union, on an equality\r\nwith the Commonwealths already existing. The people of this district\r\nhad not asked the permission of Congress to form a constitution and\r\ngovernment, for the reason afterwards alleged that they were already\r\nin the enjoyment of this status as a part of Massachusetts. The reason\r\noffered was not, however, entirely satisfactory, and the people of the\r\ndistrict were hardly able to clear themselves from the charge of an\r\nundue assumption of powers. The petition was, however, immediately\r\nreferred to a committee, with Mr. Holmes as chairman. On the 21st, Mr.\r\nHolmes reported a bill to the House providing for the admission of the\r\ndistrict as a Commonwealth. On the 30th, the House, in committee of\r\nthe Whole, took up the bill for consideration, and in the course of\r\nthe debate upon it Mr. Clay suggested the connection of the Missouri\r\nbill with the Maine bill. Mr. Clay did not, however, put his\r\nsuggestion into the form of a motion, and therefore the House came to\r\nno vote upon the point at this juncture. The bill for the admission of\r\nMaine was passed on January 3rd, 1820, without any connection with the\r\nMissouri bill, and without any restrictions or limitations upon the\r\npowers of the new Commonwealth beyond what the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States placed upon those of the original Commonwealths. Mr.\r\nClay's suggestion was not, however, lost upon the Senate, as will be\r\nseen later.\r\n\r\n{78} [Sidenote: The failure of Mr. Taylor's plan for preventing\r\nslavery extension.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Taylor's committee had not been able to come to any\r\nagreement. On December 28th, 1819, before the final passage of the\r\nMaine bill, Mr. Taylor stated to the House that the committee had\r\ninstructed him to ask for its discharge. The House agreed to his\r\nrequest, and he immediately moved that a new committee be appointed,\r\nand \"instructed to report a bill\" prohibiting the further admission of\r\nslaves into the Territories of the United States west of the\r\nMississippi River. This motion evidently appeared to the House to be a\r\nprejudgment of the whole question, since it postponed the\r\nconsideration of it indefinitely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Missouri bill again before the House of\r\nRepresentatives.]\r\n\r\nThe Missouri bill was, however, also allowed to rest until January\r\n24th, 1820, and when, upon that day, the Speaker announced the bill as\r\nthe first order, Mr. Taylor moved for another week's delay, and the\r\nmotion was lost by only a single vote. On the next day the House, in\r\ncommittee of the Whole, proceeded to consider the bill. On the 26th,\r\nMr. Storrs, of New York, undertook to connect the prohibition of\r\nslavery in the region north of the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude\r\nand west of the Mississippi River and the proposed Missouri boundary\r\nwith the grant of the permission to form a Commonwealth in Missouri.\r\nThe opponents of slavery extension did not, however, regard this as\r\nsufficient compensation for their support of the bill, and Mr. Storrs'\r\nmotion was lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Taylor's amendment to the bill.]\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mr. Taylor moved that the people of Missouri should be\r\nrequired to ordain and establish in their constitution the prohibition\r\nof slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\r\ncrime, in the proposed Commonwealth. Conceding, as the result of the\r\ndiscussions, and {79} the action of the Congress during the preceding\r\nsession, that Congress had no constitutional authority to impose\r\nrestrictions upon new Commonwealths, as the condition of their\r\nadmission into the Union, which the Constitution did not impose upon\r\nthe original Commonwealths, the new question involved in Mr. Taylor's\r\nmotion, from the point of view of constitutional law, now was, whether\r\nCongress could require of a new Commonwealth, as the condition of its\r\nadmission to the Union, that it should impose any limitations upon\r\nitself which the Constitution of the United States did not impose upon\r\nthe original Commonwealths. Could Congress effect indirectly what it\r\ncould not do directly?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Taylor's argument in support of his amendment.]\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor's argument rested substantially upon the proposition,\r\nupheld by the restrictionists during the preceding session, that if\r\nCongress could admit, it could refuse to admit, and if it could admit\r\nor refuse to admit, it could admit upon conditions. He, however,\r\nadvanced other propositions and suggestions. He held that the\r\nadmission of a new Commonwealth into the Union was a procedure in the\r\nnature of a contract between the United States Government and the\r\npeople of the new Commonwealth, and, therefore, admitted of any terms\r\naccepted by both parties. He further held that the provision of the\r\nConstitution, which impliedly vested in Congress the power to\r\nprohibit, after 1808, the importation or migration of slaves, covered\r\nthe case, in that the word migration meant passage from one\r\nCommonwealth into another, in distinction from importation, which\r\nmeant the bringing of slaves into the United States from foreign\r\ncountries. And he suggested that territory acquired by the United\r\nStates subsequent to the formation of the Constitution need not be\r\ntreated with the same consideration, as to the rights of its\r\ninhabitants, as that which {80} belonged to the United States at the\r\ntime of the formation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Replies to Mr. Taylor's reasoning.]\r\n\r\nOf course the members from the South resisted Mr. Taylor's\r\nconclusions. But they were not alone in their position. Some of the\r\nstrongest opponents of slavery from the North stood up with them in\r\nresisting what they considered to be an attack upon the principle of\r\nfederal government. Mr. Holmes, of Massachusetts, was again chief\r\namong them, and it is to his argument that one must look for the most\r\nscientific and unprejudiced view of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Holmes' argument against the amendment.]\r\n\r\nAfter demonstrating most convincingly that the clauses of the\r\nConstitution which vested in Congress the power to prohibit the\r\nmigration of persons into the United States after 1808 and to regulate\r\ncommerce between the Commonwealths could not be interpreted as giving\r\nCongress the power to prevent the transportation of slaves from one\r\nCommonwealth into another, Mr. Holmes attacked the fundamental\r\nproposition upon which Mr. Taylor relied, the proposition that if\r\nCongress could admit, it could refuse to admit, and if it could admit\r\nor refuse to admit at pleasure, it could admit upon conditions. Mr.\r\nHolmes contended that the power to determine whether slavery should\r\nexist or not in any community was possessed by each Colony before the\r\nRevolution, and by each \"State\" after the Revolution, and that the\r\nConstitution of 1787 had not deprived the \"States\" of it, but had\r\nrecognized it as belonging to each of them exclusively; that new\r\n\"States\" admitted by Congress into the Union must have all the rights,\r\nand be subject to all the duties, which the original \"States\"\r\npossessed, on the one side, and were obligated to discharge, on the\r\nother; that Congress could not increase the powers of the general {81}\r\nGovernment within the new Commonwealths by selling the Territories a\r\nlicense to the Commonwealth status, and taking the pay for it in\r\npowers to be exercised by the general Government in the new\r\nCommonwealths, which that Government could not, by the Constitution,\r\nexercise within the original Commonwealths; and that if Congress\r\nassumed to exercise such power, and the people of the Territory\r\nseeking the Commonwealth status should even accept the imposed\r\ncondition, the new Commonwealth had the right and the power to free\r\nitself from the condition, and the Congress was powerless to prevent\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. McLane's argument against the amendment.]\r\n\r\nMr. McLane, of Delaware, a Commonwealth whose legislature had\r\ninstructed the representatives from the Commonwealth in Congress to\r\nsupport all measures for preventing the spread of slavery in the\r\nTerritories of the Union west of the Mississippi, presented the\r\nquestion with even greater clearness and conciseness. He simply\r\nanalyzed the words of the Constitution which make up the clause\r\nconferring power on Congress \"to admit new States into this Union.\" He\r\nsaid that the power to admit was not the power to create; that the\r\nvery use of the word presupposed that the power to create the \"State\"\r\nresided elsewhere than in Congress; that Congress must admit a\r\n_\"State,\"_ not a Territory or a province or anything but a _\"State;\"_\r\nthat a \"State,\" in the system of federal government of the United\r\nStates, was an organization whose powers and duties had been\r\ndetermined by the Constitution of the United States itself, and could\r\nnot be altered by Congressional definitions and limitations; that\r\nCongress must admit the \"State\" into _this Union_, not into some other\r\nunion; and that _this Union_ was a system of federal government, in\r\nwhich the relations between the general Government {82} and the\r\n\"States\" had been fixed by the Constitution of the United States, and\r\ncould not be altered by a mere Congressional act. This was strong\r\nreasoning, and it had a powerful effect upon the minds of all who\r\nheard it and of all who read it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The independent Missouri bill of the Senate.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events were occurring in the Senate which were to exercise a\r\ncontrolling influence over the fate of the bill in the House. On\r\nDecember 29th, 1819, a memorial from the Territorial legislature of\r\nMissouri, praying for the admission of that part of the Territory\r\nalready described in the memorial to the House, had been presented in\r\nthe Senate, and referred to the Judiciary committee. On January 3rd,\r\n1820, the House bill admitting Maine was sent into the Senate. Mr.\r\nJames Barbour, of Virginia, immediately gave notice of his intention\r\nto move the connection of the two subjects in the same bill, and on\r\nthe same terms. As we have seen, Mr. Clay had already made this\r\nsuggestion in the House, but had not formally proposed it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The connection of the House bill admitting Maine with the\r\nSenate's bill admitting Missouri.]\r\n\r\nThe House bill admitting Maine was immediately referred to the\r\nJudiciary committee, which committee already had the Missouri bill in\r\nits charge, and on January 6th, Mr. Smith, of South Carolina, the\r\nchairman of this committee, reported from it to the Senate the House\r\nbill admitting Maine, with an amendment authorizing the people of\r\nMissouri, within the general geographical boundaries already\r\ndescribed, to form a constitution and Commonwealth government. The\r\namendment contained no restrictions or conditions with regard to\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nOn January 13th, the day fixed for considering the report of the\r\ncommittee, Mr. Roberts, of Pennsylvania, moved the recommitment of the\r\nMaine bill to the {83} Judiciary committee, with the instruction that\r\nthe bill should be divested of the amendment in regard to Missouri.\r\nThe vote upon this motion would, therefore, reveal the attitude of the\r\nSenate upon the question of tacking the two subjects together. Such\r\nmen as Mr. Roberts, Mr. Mellen, Mr. Burrill, and Mr. Otis argued that\r\nthey should be disconnected, on the ground of the discordance of the\r\ntwo provisions. The people of Maine, they said, had already formed\r\ntheir constitution and government, and were simply asking for\r\nadmission, while the Missouri bill was a measure for enabling the\r\npeople of a part of the Missouri Territory to form a constitution and\r\ngovernment, under which they might be admitted later, provided that\r\nconstitution should prove satisfactory to Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, such men as Mr. Barbour, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Macon\r\ncontended that the two subjects were entirely germane, and that any\r\ncontrary appearance was caused by the unwarranted action of the people\r\nof Maine in proceeding so far as they had done without asking the\r\nconsent of Congress, for which wrongful procedure presumptuous Maine\r\nshould not be rewarded and respectful Missouri punished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The refusal of the Senate to disconnect the two measures.]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, the vote was taken upon the motion to recommit, and it\r\nwas lost by a majority of seven votes in forty-three. A number of the\r\nSenators from the Northern Commonwealths voted with the Southerners in\r\nrefusing to separate the two subjects.\r\n\r\nThe question then came upon the contents of the bill as reported by\r\nthe Judiciary committee. Mr. Roberts immediately moved to amend the\r\nbill by a provision prohibiting the further introduction of slavery\r\ninto Missouri. The arguments upon this motion were substantially a\r\nrepetition of what had already been said {84} upon the subject in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. The amendment was voted down, on February\r\n1st, by a large majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Thomas' amendment to the joint measure.]\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd, Mr. Thomas, of Illinois, offered an amendment, which was\r\ndestined to play a very important part in the further development of\r\nthe subject. It was the proposition to exclude slavery from the\r\nLouisiana territory above thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes,\r\nexcept within the limits of the proposed Commonwealth of Missouri. The\r\nSenate was not yet prepared, however, to consider this, the question\r\nbefore it, at the moment, being the question of procedure, the\r\nquestion whether the two subjects should be united in one bill. The\r\nSenate had only voted not to recommit the bill to the Judiciary\r\ncommittee with instructions, and it was thought necessary to take a\r\nformal vote upon the question of the connection of the two subjects as\r\nproposed by the committee before considering any further amendments to\r\nit. Mr. Thomas, therefore, withdrew his motion for the moment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Pinkney's great argument against the power of Congress\r\nto lay restrictions on new Commonwealths not imposed by the\r\nConstitution on the original Commonwealths.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage of the proceedings, when apparently there was\r\nnothing before the Senate but the question of the union of the two\r\nsubjects, that Mr. Pinkney of Maryland made his brilliant and\r\nunanswerable argument upon the question of the powers of Congress in\r\nthe premises. It differed logically very little from Mr. McLane's\r\npowerful analysis of the subject in the House, but it was elaborated\r\nand embellished as only Mr. Pinkney's beautiful diction could do it.\r\nThe gist of the reasoning was, however, contained in a few sentences\r\nwhich ran as follows: \"What, then, is the professed result? To admit a\r\nState into this Union. What is this Union? A confederation of States,\r\nequal {85} in sovereignty, capable of everything which the\r\nConstitution does not forbid, or authorize Congress to forbid. It is\r\nan equal union between parties equally sovereign. They were sovereign,\r\nindependent of the Union. The object of the Union was common\r\nprotection for the exercise of already existing sovereignty. The\r\nparties gave up a portion of that sovereignty to insure the remainder.\r\nAs far as they gave it up by the common compact, they have ceased to\r\nbe sovereign. The Union provides the means for securing the residue;\r\nand it is into _that_ Union that a new State is to come. By acceding\r\nto it, the new State is placed on the same footing with the original\r\nStates. It accedes for the same purpose, that is, protection for its\r\nunsurrendered sovereignty. If it comes in shorn of its beams, crippled\r\nand disparaged beyond the original States, it is not into the original\r\nUnion that it comes. For it is a different sort of Union. The first\r\nwas a Union _inter pares_. This is a Union _inter disparates_, between\r\ngiants and a dwarf, between power and feebleness, between full\r\nproportioned sovereignties and a miserable image of power--a thing\r\nwhich that very Union has shrunk and shrivelled from its just size\r\ninstead of preserving it in its true dimensions. It is into _this_\r\nUnion, that is the Union of the Federal Constitution, that you are to\r\nadmit or refuse to admit. You can admit into no other. You cannot make\r\nthe Union, as to the new States, what it is not as to the old; for\r\nthen it is not _this_ Union that you open for the entrance of a new\r\nparty. If you make it enter into a new and additional compact is it\r\nany longer the same Union?... But it is a State which you are to\r\nadmit. What is a _State_ in the sense of the Constitution? It is not a\r\nState in general, but a State as you find it in the Constitution....\r\nAsk the Constitution. It shows you {86} what it means by a State by\r\nreference to the parties to it. It must be such a State as\r\nMassachusetts, Virginia, and the other members of the American\r\nConfederacy--a State with full sovereignty except as the Constitution\r\nrestricts it. The whole amount of the argument on the other side is,\r\nthat you may refuse to admit a new State, and that, therefore, if you\r\nadmit, you may prescribe the terms. The answer to that argument is,\r\nthat even if you can refuse, you can prescribe no terms which are\r\ninconsistent with the act you are to do. You can prescribe no\r\nconditions which, if carried into effect, would make the new State\r\nless a sovereign State than, under the Union as it stands, it would\r\nbe. You can prescribe no terms which will make the compact of Union\r\nbetween it and the original States essentially different from that\r\ncompact among the original States. You may admit or refuse to admit,\r\nbut if you admit, you must admit a State in the sense of the\r\nConstitution--a State with all such sovereignty as belongs to the\r\noriginal parties; and it must be into _this_ Union that you are to\r\nadmit it, not into a Union of your own dictating, formed out of the\r\nexisting Union by qualifications and new compacts, altering its\r\ncharacter and effect, and making it fall short of its protecting\r\nenergy in reference to the new State, whilst it requires an energy of\r\nanother sort--the energy of restraint and destruction.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the old-fashioned political and rhetorical way of saying what\r\nthe modern publicist would state in such language as this: In a\r\nfederal system of government, all powers are distributed by the state,\r\nthe nation, the ultimate sovereignty, through the Constitution,\r\nbetween the central Government and the Commonwealths. The assumption\r\nby the central Government of the authority to redistribute these\r\npowers in a different manner, in any {87} given case, is an assumption\r\nof sovereignty, the Constitution-making power, and the possession of\r\nany such power by the central Government makes a federal system of\r\ngovernment impossible. It makes the Commonwealths only creatures and\r\nagencies of the central Government. It changes the whole system from\r\nfederal government to centralized government. In the federal system of\r\ngovernment as it existed, in 1820, in the United States, the\r\ndetermination of the question whether slavery should exist or not in\r\nany Commonwealth was reserved through the Constitution to each\r\nCommonwealth for itself, since this power was neither vested in the\r\ncentral Government nor denied to the Commonwealths. If Congress could\r\nassume this power, it could assume any and every other power and right\r\nwhich the Commonwealths possessed. Such authority in the central\r\nGovernment would destroy in principle the federal system, at once, and\r\nmake the government a centralized form.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pinkney's argument successful.]\r\n\r\nThere was nobody in the Senate who did, or could, answer this\r\nargument. The amendments proposed after this to the bill as reported\r\nfrom the Judiciary committee contained no further restrictions upon\r\nthe Commonwealth powers of Missouri, but had reference only to what\r\nremained of the Louisiana territory north and west of the boundaries\r\nof the proposed Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The adoption of Mr. Thomas' amendment by the Senate, and\r\nthe passage of the Maine-Missouri bill thus amended.]\r\n\r\nThe formal vote connecting the two subjects of Maine and Missouri was\r\ntaken in the Senate on February 16th, and after this was resolved\r\nupon, Mr. Thomas immediately renewed his motion to amend the bill by\r\nthe addition of a clause prohibiting slavery in the Louisiana\r\nterritory above thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes, outside of the\r\nboundaries of the proposed Commonwealth of Missouri. After an attempt,\r\non the {88} one side, to carry this line up to the fortieth parallel,\r\nand a counter attempt on the other to make the prohibition extend to\r\nall the territory west of the Mississippi, except that already under\r\nCommonwealth government, or in process of being put under Commonwealth\r\ngovernment by the existing bill--the result of which would have been\r\nthe prohibition of slavery in the just organized Territory of\r\nArkansas--Mr. Thomas' amendment was adopted as the fair compromise.\r\nThe bill, as thus amended, passed the Senate on February 18th, 1820,\r\nand was sent immediately to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House of Representatives' refusal to agree to the\r\ncombination.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The conference on the subject, and the first Missouri\r\ncompromise.]\r\n\r\nThe form of the bill was now the House bill in regard to Maine, with\r\nthe Missouri bill and the Thomas proposition attached to it as\r\namendments. The House voted to disagree to these amendments, and sent\r\nthe bill, stripped of them, back to the Senate. The Senate voted\r\nimmediately to insist upon its amendments, and the House answered with\r\na vote insisting upon its position. Thereupon, the Senate requested a\r\nconference with the House upon the subject, and appointed Mr. Pinkney,\r\nMr. Barbour, and Mr. Thomas as its representatives. The House acceded\r\nto the request and appointed Mr. Holmes, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Lowndes, Mr.\r\nParker, and Mr. Kinsey as its representatives. These gentlemen met and\r\nagreed without much difficulty to the following points: That the\r\nSenate should withdraw its amendments to the House bill for the\r\nadmission of Maine; that both the Senate and the House should pass the\r\nMissouri bill, without the condition in reference to the restriction\r\nof slavery in the proposed Commonwealth; and that both the Senate and\r\nthe House should add a provision to the Missouri bill prohibiting\r\nslavery in the remainder of the Louisiana territory north of\r\nthirty-six degrees and thirty {89} minutes. That is, the House should\r\ngain its point of order in the separation of the two subjects; the\r\nSenate should gain its point of constitutional law in defending the\r\nnew Commonwealth against restrictions not imposed by the Constitution\r\nupon the original Commonwealths; and the two should compromise upon a\r\nfair division of the remaining parts of the Louisiana territory\r\nbetween the interests of the North and those of the South. The Senate\r\naccepted the recommendations of the committee without much difficulty,\r\nand voted the measures contained in them. The House also accepted the\r\nrecommendations and voted the necessary provisions upon its part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Monroe's approval of the Compromise.]\r\n\r\nWhen the measures were placed before President Monroe for his\r\napproval, he called a meeting of the Cabinet to consider the subject.\r\nThere was no difficulty except upon a single point, the prohibition of\r\nslavery in the remainder of the Louisiana territory above thirty-six\r\ndegrees and thirty minutes north latitude. Was this to be taken as\r\nprohibiting slavery in the Commonwealths which might be formed upon\r\nthis territory in the future, or did the Congress only intend to lay\r\nthis restriction upon this territory merely for the period during\r\nwhich it might continue subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\ngeneral Government, the period of Territorial organization? If the\r\nformer, the Missouri question would have to be fought over again\r\nwhenever a new Commonwealth should be formed in this territory. The\r\nCabinet interpreted the prohibition as applying only during the period\r\nbefore the Commonwealth organization should be established, and upon\r\nthe basis of this interpretation advised the President that the\r\nmeasure was constitutional. The President signed the Maine bill on the\r\n3rd of March and the Missouri bill on the 6th (1820).\r\n\r\n{90} [Sidenote: Review of the points involved in the contest.]\r\n\r\nSo far as the questions of constitutional and parliamentary law were\r\nconcerned, the settlement reached was in accordance with right\r\nprinciples. It was right that the two subjects, which the Senate\r\nunited in one bill, should be separated. The only justification for\r\nthis act of the Senate was the manifest determination on the part of\r\nthe House to impose an unconstitutional restriction as the condition\r\nupon which the people of Missouri should be allowed to assume the\r\nstatus and the powers of a Commonwealth of the Union. It was the only\r\nweapon left to the more conservative Senate, by which to defend the\r\nConstitution against the rashness of the more radical House. It need\r\nastonish no impartial student of our history that the Senate used it.\r\nNo such momentous question was involved in this point of parliamentary\r\nprocedure as there was in the exaggerated interpretation of the powers\r\nof Congress by the House. The Senate showed its willingness to yield\r\nits position upon this point so soon as the House would return to\r\nsound constitutional principle in the Missouri question. It was\r\nfortunate for the development of the parliamentary practice of\r\nCongress that the House so changed its position in reference to the\r\ngreater question of constitutional law as to enable the Senate to\r\nreturn to the true parliamentary principle of the separation of\r\nsubjects which differ in essence or in circumstances in the slightest\r\ndegree. While, therefore, the Senate should not be too strongly\r\ncriticised for using its power over its own rules of procedure, as a\r\nmeans of retaliation, it is a matter of great satisfaction that\r\nexpedients were at last found for maintaining right principle and\r\nsound parliamentary custom in the case. And it was surely right that\r\nthe attempt to make Congress the distributor of powers between the\r\ngeneral Government and the Commonwealths {91} was abandoned. The power\r\nwhich _made_ the Constitution can alone set up the metes and bounds\r\nbetween the realm of authority of the general Government and that of\r\nthe Commonwealths. This is the indispensable condition of federal\r\ngovernment. If the general Government possesses such power, the system\r\nis centralized in theory, and may become so in fact at the pleasure of\r\nthe general Government. If, on the other hand, the Commonwealths\r\npossess such power, the system is the loosest form of confederation,\r\nan international league.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Constitution may authorize the general Government\r\nto limit the powers of the Commonwealths in regard to certain\r\nspecified points and the federal system be still preserved, but a\r\ngeneral authority in the general Government to do so, such as was\r\nclaimed by the restrictionists from the vague provision vesting in\r\nCongress the power to \"admit new States into this Union,\" amounts to\r\nnothing less than a claim of sovereignty by Congress over the new\r\nCommonwealths. Such was not the system which those who framed and\r\nratified the Constitution intended to establish. Such is not the\r\nsystem which comports with the vast territorial extent and the\r\nclimatic differences of the United States, and with the ethnical\r\nvariety of the population of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that those who resisted the restriction upon Missouri\r\nused terms and propositions, in reference to the genesis of the Union\r\nand the relation of the general Government to the Commonwealths, which\r\nwill hardly bear the test of correct history and exact political\r\nscience, but they had the true principle in respect to the point at\r\nissue, when they held that \"the State,\" in the sense of the\r\nConstitution, is defined in the Constitution; that its powers are the\r\nresidue after what the Constitution vests exclusively in the general\r\n{92} Government and denies to the \"States\" shall have been subtracted\r\nfrom sovereignty; and that Congress cannot vary these relations under\r\nan interpretation of a general provision. They conceded that Congress\r\nmight, as the general principle, admit or not admit, as it might judge\r\nproper, with all that this involved in reference to geographical\r\nboundaries and ripeness of the population for self-government, but\r\nthey held that the thing admitted was created by the Constitution,\r\nthrough the people inhabiting the district to be formed into a\r\nCommonwealth, and not by Congress. And they repudiated the idea that\r\nthe Declaration of Independence is any part of the constitutional law\r\nof the country, or that Congress can define the republican form of\r\ngovernment which the United States is obligated by the Constitution to\r\nguarantee to every Commonwealth, in any other sense than that\r\nconcretely expressed in the original Commonwealths.\r\n\r\nThey held this ground under enormous strain and pressure brought from\r\nwithout. Cross-roads assemblies, town and city meetings, and\r\nCommonwealth legislatures poured petitions and memorials in upon them\r\nin behalf of slavery restriction. The excitement, throughout the\r\nNortheast especially, was intense. They had to fight their battle\r\nunder an ignoble issue. But it will not be denied by any impartial\r\nconstitutional lawyer that they were, for this time, the upholders of\r\nthe Constitution against an unwarranted attempt to stretch\r\nCongressional power.\r\n\r\nFinally, the compromise provision, drawing the line of thirty-six\r\ndegrees and thirty minutes through the Louisiana territory, and\r\nsecuring all north of it, which was by far the greater part, against\r\nthe introduction of slavery during the period that it might remain\r\nunder the exclusive jurisdiction of the general Government, was {93}\r\ntantamount to a surrender, forever, of this vast domain to immigration\r\nfrom the North almost exclusively, and to the creation therein of new\r\nCommonwealths into which slaveholders could not take their slave\r\nproperty. Many American historians treat the express exclusion of\r\nslavery north of this line as no concession to the North, but as a\r\nmask under which the real concession, the concession to the South, was\r\nhidden. This they claim to have been the implied concession to hold\r\nslaves south of that line. But slavery was legal by custom in the\r\nwhole of the province of Louisiana, when the United States received it\r\nfrom France. That is, a master might have taken slaves into any part\r\nof it, into which he might have gone himself, and would not thereby\r\nhave violated any law, and the United States Government had not, down\r\nto 1820, changed this state of things by any act of its own.\r\n\r\nThe compromise upon the line of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes\r\nwas, therefore, a very decided limitation upon the existing rights of\r\nslave-masters. And even if slavery had not already penetrated into\r\nthis region, it can hardly be claimed that the balance of advantage\r\ncreated by the compromise provision lay with the South, except upon\r\nthe principle that the South ought not to have had anything, and the\r\nNorth ought to have had everything. Ethically, perhaps, this is the\r\ncorrect principle from which to judge the question, but politically\r\nand legally it was not, at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe Union consisted of Commonwealths, in all of which slavery existed\r\nat the time of and during the War for Independence, in almost all of\r\nwhich it existed when the Constitution of 1787 was framed and adopted,\r\nand in about half of which it existed, as the most important\r\ninstitution, at the period of the Missouri controversy. Further, it\r\ncan hardly be denied that the Constitution contained recognition and\r\nguarantees of slave property. {94} The vague phrases of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, even if intended to touch the relation of\r\nmaster and slave within the country, were not law. It is true that\r\nslavery was regarded both in the North and in the South as an evil,\r\nbut men differed in opinion as to whether confining the slaves to a\r\nparticular section was a better means for its mitigation than\r\nspreading them over a larger area, and reducing thus their number\r\nrelative to the white population in any particular section.\r\n\r\nSurrounded in thought with the ideas and conditions of 1820, it is\r\ndifficult to see why the balance of advantage contained in the\r\ncompromise provision of the Missouri bill did not lie with the North.\r\nCompromise or no compromise about the remainder of the Louisiana\r\nterritory, Missouri was bound to be admitted without restriction as to\r\nslavery. The customary law of the region seeking to become a\r\nCommonwealth permitted slaveholding. The population was sufficient to\r\nwarrant the assumption of Commonwealth powers. The Constitution did\r\nnot authorize Congress to impose the slavery restriction, and the\r\npeople of the region had protested against it. The admission of\r\nMissouri was, therefore, no legitimate element in the compromise.\r\nNeither was the agreement on the part of the Senate to separate Maine\r\nfrom Missouri any proper element in the compromise. The restriction\r\nplaced by the House on Missouri rested on a false interpretation of\r\nconstitutional law, and the connection of the two subjects in the same\r\nbill rested on a false interpretation of parliamentary law. In\r\nprinciple both had to be abandoned. The compromise was in reality only\r\nabout the remainder of the Louisiana territory after the admission of\r\nMissouri, in no part of which had slavery, to that moment, been\r\nprohibited. How much of it should continue open to the further\r\nintroduction of slavery by the immigration of {95} masters with their\r\nslaves, and how much should be given over to practically exclusive\r\nimmigration from the North--these were the only proper terms of the\r\ncompromise. What the South finally obtained out of it was one\r\nCommonwealth, while the vast region from which slavery was excluded\r\nhas produced eight or nine Commonwealths. In the light of these\r\nconsiderations it certainly appears that the cause of free labor won a\r\nsubstantial triumph in the Missouri compromise, and that, in place of\r\nthat shameful surrender of freedom to slavery, so emphasized by\r\ncertain historians, a mighty step forward in the progress of liberty\r\nwas taken.\r\n\r\nIt was confidently hoped and believed that the compromise had solved\r\nthe slavery problem, in so far as Congress could solve it. The whole\r\ncountry breathed more easily and the thoughts of men were turned to\r\nother subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The revival of the Missouri struggle.]\r\n\r\nBut the peace proved to be only an armistice. In less than twelve\r\nmonths the battle was raging again with more than its former fury.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri convention, which drew up and voted, in the middle of the\r\nyear 1820, the organic law for the new Commonwealth, inserted a\r\nparagraph therein which made it the duty of the legislature, proposed\r\nto be established by that law, to enact measures for preventing\r\nmulattoes and free negroes from immigrating into and settling within\r\nthe Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Missouri constitution in Congress.]\r\n\r\nOn November 14th, 1820, this instrument was presented to the Senate of\r\nthe United States, and on the 16th to the House of Representatives,\r\nfor the purpose of moving these bodies to pass an act admitting\r\nMissouri into the Union as a Commonwealth. The instrument was\r\nimmediately referred by each House to a committee; and on the 23rd,\r\nMr. Lowndes, the chairman of the House Committee, {96} reported a bill\r\nfor effecting this result, and, on the 29th, Mr. Smith reported a bill\r\nof like tenor to the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Lowndes' bill for the admission of Missouri with the\r\ninstrument unchanged.]\r\n\r\nMr. Lowndes' bill was prefaced by a statement of views, which\r\npresented the questions of constitutional interpretation to which the\r\nprovision referred to in the Missouri instrument gave rise. He alluded\r\nto the possible repugnance of the provision to that clause in the\r\nConstitution of the United States which guarantees to the citizens of\r\neach Commonwealth all the privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\nevery other Commonwealth; but said that the provision in the Missouri\r\ninstrument could be interpreted to mean only such mulattoes and free\r\nnegroes as were not citizens in any Commonwealth. And he held that,\r\nwhether this be the true interpretation or not, the judiciary of the\r\nUnited States, and not the Congress, should determine the question of\r\nrepugnance between the Missouri instrument and the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. He finally took the ground that Missouri was now\r\nalready a Commonwealth by virtue of the Act of Congress giving her\r\npeople permission to form Commonwealth government, and by virtue of\r\nthe act of her people in forming a Commonwealth constitution, and he\r\ndeclared that the refusal or failure of Congress, at this time, to\r\npass a formal act of admission could not reduce her again to the\r\nTerritorial status.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Serious opposition to the Lowndes bill.]\r\n\r\nMr. Sergeant, the spokesman of the opposition to Mr. Lowndes' report,\r\nmet these propositions with the counter-propositions, that a Territory\r\nbecomes a Commonwealth of the Union only by a Congressional Act\r\nadmitting it to that status; that no other kind of a Commonwealth than\r\na Commonwealth in the Union is known to the political {97} system of\r\nthe United States; that all the acts done by Congress and by the\r\npeople resident within a Territory before the Congressional Act of\r\nadmission are nothing more than preliminaries, and that a Territory\r\nremains a Territory until the passage of this latter act; that the\r\nprovision in the Missouri instrument in regard to the exclusion of\r\nmulattoes and free negroes was repugnant to that clause in the\r\nConstitution of the United States which guarantees to the citizens of\r\nany Commonwealth the privileges and immunities of citizens in every\r\nother Commonwealth of the Union into which they may go; and that\r\nCongress, not the Judiciary, is the body which should determine\r\nwhether such repugnance exists, and, if so, correct it.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that, from the point of view of a correct political\r\nlogic, the opponents of Mr. Lowndes' propositions in regard to the\r\nmaking of a Commonwealth of the Union stood upon the firmer ground,\r\ndespite the fact that the precedents did not sustain fully their\r\nclaims. As a fact, Congress had been guilty of such irregularities in\r\nthe admission of some of the Commonwealths as to give much support to\r\nthe notion that there could be a Commonwealth in the political system\r\nof the United States before its formal admission into the Union. But\r\nthe argument is unanswerable, that a Commonwealth not in the Union is\r\na foreign state; that in order that a Territory shall attain this\r\nlatter position and status its constitutional right to secede from the\r\nUnited States must be recognized, which is absurd; and that,\r\ntherefore, the Congressional Act of admission is what makes a\r\nTerritory of the Union into a Commonwealth of the Union, the only kind\r\nof a Commonwealth known to the political system of the United States.\r\n\r\nThey also stood upon the firmer ground in holding {98} that it is the\r\nduty of Congress to scrutinize closely the measures proposed for\r\nenactment by it from the point of view of their constitutionality, and\r\nto pass no act, of the constitutionality of which it is not reasonably\r\nconvinced, under the pretext that the Judiciary is the proper body to\r\ncorrect the usurpation. The members of Congress take the same oath to\r\nuphold the Constitution as the judges do. The revisory powers of the\r\nJudiciary over the acts of Congress were not given in order to excuse\r\nthe Congress from exercising its preliminary judgment upon the\r\nconstitutionality of its own acts. They were given simply to correct\r\nerrors in judgment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The protection of the rights of citizens of one\r\nCommonwealth within the territory of another by the United States.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when a citizen of one Commonwealth immigrated into\r\nand settled in another, it was a question whether he did not lose the\r\nright to be treated as a citizen in the latter Commonwealth, in so far\r\nas the Constitution of the United States, as it was in 1820, was\r\nconcerned, and become subject to the laws of the latter Commonwealth\r\nas to his status. If he were only passing through, or sojourning\r\ntemporarily in, the latter Commonwealth, it was clear that the\r\nConstitution of the United States protected him as a citizen of\r\nanother Commonwealth, but when he changed his residence and\r\ncitizenship to the latter Commonwealth, the question became much more\r\ncomplicated. It was now whether the laws of one Commonwealth were, by\r\nvirtue of the Constitution of the United States, valid in another\r\nCommonwealth for the protection of persons against the laws of the\r\nlatter Commonwealth, who had become citizens and residents of the\r\nlatter Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that the immediate question involved\r\nin the provision of the Missouri instrument was whether a Commonwealth\r\ncould prohibit the citizens of other Commonwealths from immigrating\r\n{99} into, and gaining residence and citizenship within, itself. How\r\nit might treat such persons after these things had been accomplished\r\nwas a subsequent matter. But even limiting the question to this point,\r\nit was certainly a startling thing to the Southerners to be told that,\r\nby virtue of the Constitution of the United States, a negro citizen of\r\nMassachusetts had the right to immigrate into, and become a citizen\r\nof, South Carolina, when the laws of South Carolina did not admit\r\nnegroes to citizenship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of the Lowndes bill in the House.]\r\n\r\nOn December 13th (1820), after a long, earnest, and, at times,\r\nacrimonious debate, the Lowndes measure for the admission of Missouri\r\nwas defeated by a vote of ninety-three to seventy-nine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the Senate bill with a proviso by the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe bill presented by Mr. Smith in the Senate was taken up for\r\nconsideration on December 4th. The arguments pro and con were about\r\nthe same as those offered in the House, but the bitterness of feeling\r\nwhich seemed to animate the members of the opposition to the measure\r\nin the House was not manifested by those adverse to it in the Senate.\r\nNevertheless, there was a majority in the Senate against passing a\r\nsimple measure for admission without any limitations. They finally\r\nvoted the bill, with the proviso attached: \"That nothing herein\r\ncontained shall be so construed as to give the assent of Congress to\r\nany provision in the constitution of Missouri, if any such there be,\r\nwhich contravenes that clause in the Constitution of the United States\r\nwhich declares that 'the citizens of each State shall be entitled to\r\nall the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate bill tabled by the House.]\r\n\r\nThe House tabled this bill on the same day that it rejected the\r\nmeasure offered by its own committee. But what now was the status of\r\nMissouri? Her people had {100} elected a governor and members of the\r\nlegislature under the organic law formed in July, and it was\r\nconsidered doubtful whether there still existed any Territorial\r\nofficials exercising governmental powers. The House, however, would\r\nnot even inquire into this fact. They said the question before them\r\nwas one of law and not of fact at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Clay and the second Missouri Compromise.]\r\n\r\nAfter some futile attempts made by Mr. Eustis, of Massachusetts, for\r\nthe admission of Missouri upon a future day, provided the obnoxious\r\nclause should be expunged from her organic law before that day, Mr.\r\nClay came forward and assumed the management of the question.\r\n\r\nOn January 29th, 1821, he asked the House to go into committee of the\r\nWhole to consider the Senate bill admitting Missouri. This proposition\r\nwas naturally agreed to, and, after several unsuccessful attempts made\r\nby others at an immediate amendment of the Senate bill in the\r\ncommittee of the Whole House, Mr. Clay moved the reference of the bill\r\nto a select committee of thirteen persons. This motion was passed, and\r\nthe committee was chosen, with Mr. Clay as its chairman.\r\n\r\nOn February 10th, 1821, Mr. Clay reported the recommendations of the\r\ncommittee. They were expressed in the proposition: That Missouri\r\nshould be \"admitted into this Union on an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States, in all respects whatever, upon the fundamental\r\ncondition that the said State shall never pass any law preventing any\r\ndescription of persons from coming to and settling in the said State,\r\nwho may now be or hereafter become citizens of any of the States of\r\nthis Union; _and provided also_, that the legislature of the said\r\nState, by a solemn public act, shall declare the assent of the said\r\nState to the said fundamental condition, and shall transmit to the\r\nPresident of the United States, on or before the fourth {101} Monday\r\nof November next, an authentic copy of the said act: upon the\r\nreception whereof, the President, by proclamation, shall announce the\r\nfact: whereupon, and without any further proceedings on the part of\r\nCongress, the admission of the said State shall be considered as\r\ncomplete: _and provided_ further, that nothing herein contained shall\r\nbe construed to take from the said State of Missouri, when admitted\r\ninto this Union, the exercise of any right or power, which can now be\r\nconstitutionally exercised by any of the original States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of Mr. Clay's first attempt.]\r\n\r\nMr. Tomlinson, of the committee, took the floor against the report,\r\nand showed so conclusively that the legislature of a Commonwealth\r\ncould not bind the makers of the organic law of the Commonwealth, and\r\nthat, therefore, any obligation which the legislature of Missouri\r\nmight assume toward Congress might prove nugatory, that the Senate\r\nbill, with the amendment offered by Mr. Clay's committee, was voted\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Clay's second attempt to secure a compromise.]\r\n\r\nMr. Clay waited ten days after this in order to let the feelings of\r\nthe members become mollified, and on February 22nd, one of the most\r\nsignificant days in American history, made his final attempt to secure\r\na compromise. He moved that members to a conference committee be\r\nappointed by the House. The motion was carried, and on the next day\r\nthe members of the House contingent of the committee, consisting of\r\ntwenty-three persons, under the lead of Mr. Clay, were appointed. The\r\nSenate met the advance promptly and appointed seven members to\r\nrepresent it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second Missouri Compromise.]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, Mr. Clay reported the results of the conference, in the\r\nform of a resolution of the following tenor: \"Resolved, by the Senate\r\nand House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress {102}\r\nassembled, that Missouri shall be admitted into this Union on an equal\r\nfooting with the original States in all respects whatever, upon the\r\nfundamental condition, that the fourth clause of the twenty-sixth\r\nsection of the third article of the constitution submitted on the part\r\nof said State to Congress shall never be construed to authorize the\r\npassage of any law, and that no law shall be passed in conformity\r\nthereto, by which any citizen of either of the States of this Union\r\nshall be excluded from the enjoyment of any of the privileges and\r\nimmunities to which such citizen is entitled under the Constitution of\r\nthe United States: Provided that the legislature of the said State, by\r\na solemn public act, shall declare the assent of the said State to the\r\nsaid fundamental condition, and shall transmit to the President of the\r\nUnited States, on or before the fourth Monday in November next, an\r\nauthentic copy of the said act; upon the receipt whereof the\r\nPresident, by proclamation, shall announce the fact; whereupon, and\r\nwithout any further proceeding on the part of Congress, the admission\r\nof the said State into this Union shall be considered as complete.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the second Missouri Compromise Act.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this recommendation contained the same\r\nobjectionable feature as did that of the committee of Thirteen of the\r\nHouse, that is, the proposition to rely upon the Missouri legislature\r\nto enter into an obligation to Congress, which should bind all future\r\nlegislatures and also the constituent power of the Commonwealth. It\r\nwas, therefore, attacked upon the same ground, but the supporters\r\nurged so strongly that Congress should put a reasonable faith in the\r\nhonor of Missouri to keep the pledge made by her first legislature,\r\nthat the resolution was finally adopted by the House, by a very small\r\nmajority, on the same day that it was reported. It was immediately\r\nsent to the {103} Senate for concurrence, and, after a brief debate,\r\nwas voted by that body on the 28th, by a large majority.\r\n\r\nThe great struggle was at last over, and it was sincerely hoped that\r\nthe \"era of good feeling,\" so suddenly interrupted by it, had been\r\nrestored. Apparently it was so, but while the decision finally reached\r\nsaved the country from one great danger, it sowed the seeds of\r\nanother. A brief review of the effects of that decision upon the\r\nconstitutional law, political science, and social conditions of the\r\nRepublic will make this apparent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The general effects of the decisions reached in the\r\nMissouri question.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the decision involved the constitutional and\r\npolitical principle that, in the federal system of government\r\ngenerally, and in the system of the United States in particular, the\r\npowers of government are, and must be, distributed by the sovereignty\r\nbehind, and supreme over, both the general Government and the\r\nCommonwealths, and not by either of the two governments, unless\r\nexpressly empowered to do so, in specific cases, by the sovereignty\r\nthrough the Constitution. This is undoubtedly a sound principle, both\r\nof political science and constitutional law, but it taught the\r\nSoutherners that protection of their property in slaves would depend\r\nupon strict construction of the Constitution. It caused their leaders\r\nto desert the broad national ground in the interpretation of the\r\nConstitution which they had occupied since 1812, and to seek more and\r\nmore to limit and restrict the powers of Congress, in which the\r\nmajority of the members of one House, at least, must always come from\r\nthe North, and in the other House of which no more than an exact\r\nbalance could be maintained.\r\n\r\nIt introduced, therefore, the principle which led necessarily to a\r\ndivision of the all-comprehending Republican party into two branches,\r\nthe one branch holding {104} to the latitudinarian and national views\r\nof the party from 1812 to 1819, and the other to the earlier creed of\r\n1798 to 1812. The former finally coalesced with the remnants of the\r\nFederal party and formed the National Republican or Whig party, while\r\nthe latter called itself the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to keep clearly in mind the cause of the division of\r\nthe Republican party into its two branches in order to understand the\r\nprinciples which distinguished them, for their names are somewhat\r\nmisleading. For example, it is quite difficult to understand, upon\r\ngeneral principles, why the slaveholders of the South should be called\r\nDemocrats, while many of the little farmers and the artisans of the\r\nNorth should be called Whigs. The element of democracy which was to be\r\nfound in the political creed of the Southern masters was strict\r\nconstruction of governmental powers, the least possible interference\r\nof government in private affairs, and the largest possible individual\r\nautonomy--in a word, individual immunity against government. The\r\nmaster could take care of himself, if left free to rule his slaves.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the Missouri decision involved the principle of\r\nconstitutional law that the Congress has general powers of legislation\r\nin the Territories, and may do anything therein not forbidden by the\r\nConstitution. This is also a sound and valuable principle. It was this\r\nwhich won the great Northwest for free labor, so far as government\r\ncould affect the question, and gave the Union the strength to meet the\r\ncrisis of 1861-65. The Southerners eventually saw what they had lost\r\nin conceding this interpretation of the powers of Congress, and, as\r\nwill be seen further on, sought to repudiate it; but their long\r\nacquiescence in it had allowed it to gain the power of constitutional\r\nprecedent, too strong to be successfully overcome.\r\n\r\n{105} In the third place, the Missouri decision involved the principle\r\nthat there was, before the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, an United\r\nStates citizenship which carried with it immunities and privileges\r\nwhich no Commonwealth could lawfully deny or abridge, and which the\r\nUnited States Government was bound to protect and defend against any\r\nCommonwealth seeking to impair them. It demonstrated the difficulties\r\nwhich could arise by allowing a Commonwealth to confer United States\r\ncitizenship, and thereby bind the United States Government to sustain\r\nthe acts of one Commonwealth within the jurisdiction of another\r\nCommonwealth, whose laws might be directly contradictory to those of\r\nthe first Commonwealth upon the subject in point. It did not undertake\r\nto solve the difficulty. It only held firmly to the principle, while\r\nit made many of the best minds aware that this most national provision\r\nof the Constitution would, sooner or later, certainly require an\r\nadvance all along the line in the further development of the\r\ngovernmental system of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, the Missouri decision taught the inhabitants of\r\nthe older Commonwealths that the West could not be held in a\r\nprovincial or quasi-provincial status; that it must be carved up and\r\nformed into Commonwealths having the same powers and privileges as the\r\nolder Commonwealths; and that, therefore, the political centre of the\r\nUnited States was bound to move westward, and the East was ultimately\r\nto come, in large degree, under the influence of the West. It was this\r\nwhich has helped powerfully to carry the brain and the money of the\r\nEast to the West, and is making in the West a new, and, in some\r\nrespects, more enterprising, East.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Missouri decision taught the South that there was a\r\nprovision in the Constitution of the United {106} States which\r\nprobably made it possible for the Northern Commonwealths to force,\r\nthrough the power of the general Government, a class of persons upon\r\nthe Southern Commonwealths, in the enjoyment of the full rights of\r\ncitizenship, whom these Commonwealths did not and would not recognize\r\nas citizens in any respect; and that there was a growing disposition\r\nat the North to make an advance against slavery at every possible\r\npoint. The effect of this conviction was most baleful both upon the\r\nspirit of the masters and the status of the slaves. It created that\r\nresentment in the minds of the Southerners against interference in\r\ntheir domestic affairs, which closed their ears to all arguments\r\nagainst slavery, and it moved them to the enactment of measures in\r\ntheir several Commonwealths for the purpose of keeping the slaves\r\nunder stricter discipline and in denser ignorance. It increased\r\nvastly, if it did not introduce, that utter misunderstanding of each\r\nother's feelings and motives between the people of the two sections,\r\nwhich made it possible for the people of the North to believe,\r\nfinally, that the story of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the sober truth,\r\nand the general rule of conduct of master toward slave in the South,\r\nand for the people of the South to believe that jealousy of riches and\r\ncomfort was the sole spirit which prompted the attacks of the North\r\nupon slavery--a misunderstanding, therefore, which proved\r\nirreconcilable so long as the subject of it remained.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri decision made thus both for good and for evil--for good,\r\nsurely, in that it produced clearer ideas upon the character of\r\nfederal government, and preserved the East from an illiberal political\r\npolicy toward the West; and in that it secured the great Northwest for\r\nfree labor;--for evil, possibly, in that it estranged the two sections\r\nof the Union, and put a stop to any movement in the South for the\r\ngradual and {107} peaceable emancipation of the slaves, or for the\r\nsubstantial amelioration of their condition. It is not very likely,\r\nhowever, that any such movement would have proved successful, and it\r\nis, therefore, probable that what appears on the outside to have been\r\nan evil was in reality a good, in that it drove the disease in the\r\nbody politic of the South onward toward the crisis, which must be\r\npassed in order that the permanent cure might be effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{108}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE PARTICULARISTIC REACTION\r\n\r\nSlavery and the Industrial Policies of the Union--President Monroe and\r\nProtection after 1820--The Committee on Manufactures--The Tariff Bill\r\nof 1823--The General Character of the Bill, and its Failure to\r\nPass--President Monroe's Message of 1823, and Protection--The Tariff\r\nBill of 1824--Mr. Clay's Argument in its Support--Mr. Clay's Argument\r\nAnswered--The First Expression of the Doctrine that Protection and\r\nSlavery were Hostile Interests--The Bill Amended and Passed--The\r\nTariff of 1824 not yet Considered Sectional Legislation--South\r\nCarolina and the Tariff of 1824--The Historical Development of the\r\nDoctrine of Internal Improvements--Madison's Ideas upon Internal\r\nImprovements--The Bill of 1822 for Internal Improvements--Passage of\r\nthe Bill, and Analysis of the Vote upon it--The Bill in the Interests\r\nof the West--President Monroe's Veto, and Communication of May 4th,\r\n1822--President Monroe's Argument, and the Vote upon the\r\nVeto--Congressional Act of 1824 for Distinguishing National from Local\r\nImprovements--Foreign Relations During Monroe's Second Term--Russia\r\nand the Northwest Coast of America--The Holy Alliance--The Congress at\r\nVerona--Mr. Adams' Declaration to Baron Tuyl--Mr. Canning's Proposal\r\nto Mr. Rush--Mr. Canning's Declaration to Prince Polignac--The \"Monroe\r\nDoctrine\"--The Meaning of the Monroe Propositions in 1824--Failure to\r\nCommit Congress to these Propositions--The Particularistic Reaction\r\nScarcely Discoverable before 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery and the industrial policies of the Union.]\r\n\r\nIt was hoped and believed that the settlement of the Missouri question\r\nand the compromise in reference to the remainder of the Louisiana\r\ncession had put the problem of negro slavery out of the realm of\r\nnational politics. In fact, however, the struggle over these questions\r\nhad introduced it into that realm, and had {109} first opened the eyes\r\nof the slaveholders to the bearings of the slavery interest upon all\r\nthe questions of constitutional law and public policy. From the point\r\nof view of that interest their attitude toward all these questions was\r\nmore and more determined as they came to understand more and more\r\nclearly the relation of these questions to that interest. While,\r\ntherefore, the settlement and the compromise served to withdraw the\r\nquestion of slavery from the direct and immediate issue, they, at the\r\nsame time, left it the secret influence over views and actions in\r\nmany, if not most, directions.\r\n\r\nAt the next session, beginning in December of 1821, propositions were\r\nintroduced into the Senate to limit and decrease the admiralty\r\njurisdiction of the United States courts, to make the Senate itself a\r\ncourt of appeal from the regular Judiciary in cases where a \"State\"\r\nshould be a party, and to limit to two hundred the number of members\r\nin the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of all these projects is apparent. Indeed, their proposers\r\nsaid openly and frankly that their purpose was to lessen and limit the\r\npowers of the general Government in the interests of \"States'-rights.\"\r\n\r\nIt was natural, however, that the new spirit of particularism should\r\nattack the policies of the Government rather than the structure of the\r\npolitical system, or, more correctly, should undertake to control\r\nthese policies before it sought to transform that system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Monroe and protection after 1820.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen with what unanimity and national enthusiasm the\r\nprotection of home industries was regarded, in the half decade between\r\n1815 and 1820, as a measure indispensable to the attainment and\r\nmaintenance of industrial independence. Not even Calhoun then\r\nunderstood the relation between this policy and the interests of\r\nslavery. The Presidents, Madison and {110} Monroe, were utterly\r\noblivious to it. Even after the Missouri struggle, Mr. Monroe\r\ncontinued to recommend the protection of manufactures for the\r\nattainment of industrial independence as the true national policy. His\r\nannual messages of 1821 and of 1822 contain this recommendation. He\r\neither did not comprehend the relation of the slavery interests to the\r\nprotective system or disregarded it. It could hardly have been the\r\nlatter, for, although he was no radical supporter of slavery, he was a\r\nslaveholder and a very conservative man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The committee on Manufactures.]\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, the body which had upheld even radically\r\nnational views of the character of the political system during the\r\nMissouri struggle, very naturally responded to Mr. Monroe's\r\nrecommendation, and referred it to its committee on Manufactures for\r\nconsideration and support. Heretofore this subject had been referred\r\nto the committee on Ways and Means, the regular revenue-raising\r\ncommittee. Its reference now to the committee on Manufactures is good\r\nevidence that the House of Representatives regarded a protective\r\ntariff as a subject which Congress might deal with independently, and\r\nwithout any necessary connection with the subject of the revenue. Such\r\na view is radically national. It rests upon the doctrine that Congress\r\nmay do anything in the regulation of foreign trade and commerce which,\r\nin its own opinion, is conducive to the general welfare, regardless of\r\nthe pecuniary needs of the Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff Bill of 1823.]\r\n\r\nOn January 9th, 1823, Mr. Tod, of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the\r\ncommittee on Manufactures, reported a tariff bill. It proposed to\r\nnearly double the existing duty upon iron, quadruple that upon coarse\r\nwoollens, and to increase the custom-house valuation of dyed cotton\r\ngoods by some forty per centum.\r\n\r\n{111} Moreover, the bill made no provision for the future reduction of\r\nthese duties. It therefore indicated that protection was to be the\r\npermanent policy, protection so high as to amount to the prohibition\r\nof the importation of coarse cottons and woollens and bar iron. In\r\nfact, Mr. Tod conceded that the prohibition of the importation of\r\ncoarse woollens was intended. He said that the tariff of 1816 on\r\ncoarse cotton goods had given a monopoly of the domestic markets for\r\nsuch goods to the home manufacturers, while the price of the goods had\r\nbeen reduced through home competition by one-half, and that his\r\ncommittee desired to bring about the same result in regard to the\r\nmanufacture of coarse woollens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The general character of the bill, and its failure to\r\npass.]\r\n\r\nMr. Tod was not able to get a vote upon his bill at this session of\r\nthe Congress. Three significant facts, however, were elicited in the\r\ncourse of the debate upon it, facts which indicated the trend of\r\npolitical history. These facts were that the bill was a Pennsylvania\r\nmeasure, that the South would oppose it, and that Massachusetts and\r\nNew York City would unite with the South in this opposition. It was,\r\nin fact, a Massachusetts man, Mr. Gorham, who denounced the bill as\r\nsectional legislation, and advised the South to resist it to the\r\nutmost. Cotton and commerce, and that meant slavery and commerce, were\r\nbeginning to discover their affinity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Monroe's Message of 1823, and protection.]\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe, however, does not seem to have shared this view of\r\nthe subject. In his message of December 2nd, 1823, he again\r\nrecommended additional protection to \"those articles which we are\r\nprepared to manufacture, or which are more immediately connected with\r\nthe defence and independence of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged by the President, the House of {112} Representatives\r\nagain referred the question of increasing the tariff to Mr. Tod's\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff Bill of 1824.]\r\n\r\nOn January 9th, 1824, Mr. Tod brought in his new bill. It was a more\r\nmoderate proposition than that of the preceding session; still it\r\nprovided for a substantial increase of the duties on woollens and\r\niron.\r\n\r\nMr. Tod assumed the constitutionality of the bill to be a settled\r\nquestion, and supported the policy of it by arguments from the\r\nnecessity of attaining industrial independence in the manufacture of\r\nthe necessaries of life, from the necessity of creating new and more\r\nremunerative employments for labor, and from the policy of developing\r\nbetter home markets for agricultural products. He predicted that an\r\nultimate reduction of the prices of manufactured goods would be the\r\nresult of the increased home competition produced by higher duties. He\r\ndid not, however, make out any very satisfactory prospects for\r\ncommerce. This branch of the national pursuits was to make the\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Clay's argument in its support.]\r\n\r\nMr. Clay made the great argument in defence of the measure. He\r\nelaborated the patriotic reason in every direction. He pointed out the\r\nutter dependence of the country upon foreign markets, both for the\r\nsale of its agricultural products and for the purchase of manufactured\r\ngoods. He demonstrated that these relations had been created by the\r\nquarter of a century of war in Europe, forcing the European countries\r\nto buy the agricultural products of the United States to an unusual\r\namount, and at high prices, and showed how the restoration of general\r\npeace in Europe had reduced the demand for, and the price of, these\r\nproducts, while it left the United States dependent upon Europe for\r\nmanufactured articles. And he urged the accomplishment of industrial\r\nindependence {113} as a necessary corollary of political independence.\r\nHe contended that the aid granted to the manufacturing interests would\r\nimpose no sacrifice upon the agricultural and commercial interests;\r\nthat by the establishment of new manufacturing centres new home\r\nmarkets for the products of agriculture would be created, which would\r\nnot only emancipate the country from the necessity of foreign markets\r\nfor these products, but would give the country steady and certain\r\nmarkets, under its own control; and that the growth of manufactures\r\nwould speedily result in the establishment of an export trade in\r\nmanufactured goods to all parts of the world, and especially to South\r\nAmerica, which would ultimately more than compensate the commercial\r\ninterests for the temporary losses they might incur by reason of the\r\nincreased duties. This was a strongly tinted picture upon both sides.\r\nIt represented the distress of the country too darkly, and it painted\r\nthe speculative benefits of the high tariff in too vivid colors.\r\nMoreover, Mr. Clay now omitted any reference to the temporary\r\ncharacter of protection. It now appeared to be a permanent article of\r\nhis creed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Clay's argument answered.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first expression of the doctrine that protection and\r\nslavery were hostile interests.]\r\n\r\nWebster for Massachusetts, Cambreleng for the city of New York, and\r\nBarbour for the South, denied Mr. Clay's statement in regard to the\r\nintense and general financial distress throughout the country, and\r\ndemonstrated the destructive effects of a high tariff upon agriculture\r\nand commerce, and upon the existing manufacturing interests\r\nthemselves. They contended that such a tariff would so prohibit\r\nimportation of foreign products as to make it impossible for Europe to\r\nbuy the agricultural products of the United States, since Europe would\r\nnot be able to pay for them; that the promised increase of domestic\r\nmarkets would not at all compensate for the loss of {114} foreign\r\nmarkets; that commerce would thus be destroyed both ways; and that\r\neven the manufacturing industries already established would suffer\r\nfrom the unnatural competition which would be created by the\r\ninducements which the high tariff would hold out to capital otherwise\r\nemployed. Mr. Barbour frankly declared that the slave labor of the\r\nSouth could not be used in the development of manufactures, and that,\r\ntherefore, the high tariff must inure to the benefit of the North, by\r\nmaking the South tributary to the North for all manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nThe theory accepted by all parties, however, at the moment, was, that\r\nthe duties were paid ultimately by the consumers of the imported\r\ngoods. Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, pronounced this doctrine\r\nhimself. Upon this view the North must pay the duties equally, at\r\nleast, with the South. So long, then, as this idea was held, and so\r\nlong as the commercial interests of Massachusetts, Maine, and the city\r\nof New York made common cause with the agricultural interests of the\r\nSouth against the bill, it could not be strictly regarded as sectional\r\nlegislation, it could not develop into a political and constitutional\r\nquestion between the North and the South.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill amended and passed.]\r\n\r\nWhile this combination of interests was not able to prevent the House\r\nfrom finally passing the bill by a narrow majority, it did succeed in\r\nimposing several very substantial modifications upon it in the\r\ndirection of more moderate protection.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the bill suffered still further modification in the same\r\ndirection. The burden of the Senate's amendments fell, however, on the\r\nwool- and hemp-growing and liquor-distilling West. It was for this\r\nreason that the House of Representatives refused to concur in {115}\r\nthem. Recourse was then had to a conference committee, which arranged\r\na compromise that gave a little less protection than the House had\r\nvoted, and a little more than the Senate had voted.\r\n\r\nThe tariff of May, 1824, was still only a moderately protective\r\ntariff. It was certainly in only one particular anything like\r\nprohibitory; it preserved the high tariff of 1816 on coarse cotton\r\ngoods. In other respects it was not much more than a continuation of\r\nthe reasonable duties already imposed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tariff of 1824 not yet considered sectional\r\nlegislation.]\r\n\r\nSo long as the tariff remained moderately protective, and was approved\r\nin Kentucky and Missouri, and disapproved in Massachusetts, New\r\nHampshire, Maine, and the city of New York, and so long as its burdens\r\nwere generally believed to fall ultimately upon the consumers of the\r\ndutiable articles, it could not take on the form of a sectional issue,\r\ndominated by the question of slavery. Some of the Southerners had,\r\nindeed, discovered that slave labor could not be employed in the\r\nmills, and that, therefore, protection of manufactures would not\r\nsecure the establishment of these industries in the South, and had\r\nbegun to treat the tariff question in a manner to develop a party\r\nissue out of it. But this tendency had not advanced far enough in 1824\r\nto produce a division of the all-comprehending Republican party. It\r\nneeded another four years of personal differences among the leaders,\r\nanother revision of the tariff in the direction of higher duties, and\r\na more complete consolidation of the North for protection, before this\r\nresult could be attained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South Carolina and the tariff of 1824.]\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of the bill public meetings had been held\r\nthroughout South Carolina protesting against it, and the year\r\nsubsequent to its enactment the South Carolina legislature denounced\r\nit as unconstitutional, but the people {116} of the Commonwealth\r\nacquiesced, though with very bad temper, in the execution of the law.\r\n\r\nThe other question of internal policy, to which certain of the\r\nhistorians refer as suffering under the baleful influences of the\r\nslavery interest immediately after 1820, was the question of national\r\ninternal improvements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The historical development of the doctrine of internal\r\nimprovements.]\r\n\r\nThis question became a definite issue in Congress for the first time\r\non December 19th, 1805, when a committee of the Senate, charged with\r\nthe duty of reporting to the Senate an opinion as to how the money\r\nappropriated in the Enabling Act for Ohio ought to be applied,\r\nrecommended the use of it for the building of a road across the\r\nAlleghanies from Cumberland, in Maryland, to a point upon the Ohio\r\nRiver, near Wheeling, in Virginia.\r\n\r\nIf we may take the first Act passed by Congress, that of March 29th,\r\n1806, in regard to the matter as expressing the views of the\r\nGovernment and the people upon the subject, we must conclude that the\r\nfirst matured ideas were that the general Government had the power to\r\nlay out and construct roads within and through the Commonwealths, by\r\nand with the consent of the Commonwealths through which they might\r\npass. The Cumberland road was originally built by the general\r\nGovernment, after the consent thereto of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and\r\nVirginia had been obtained. The appropriations for subsequent repairs\r\nupon the road were, however, not considered as requiring the consent\r\nof those Commonwealths before being made or expended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madison's ideas upon internal improvements.]\r\n\r\nThe second stage in the evolution of opinion upon the subject was\r\nattained in the year 1817, when Mr. Madison vetoed Mr. Calhoun's bill\r\nfor setting aside the bonus and the dividends to be paid to the\r\nGovernment by the United States Bank as a fund for constructing roads\r\nand canals, and {117} improving the navigation of water-courses in the\r\nseveral Commonwealths. This bill proposed to authorize the general\r\nGovernment to expend the money, thus appropriated, only with the\r\nconsent of the Commonwealth, or Commonwealths, in which the proposed\r\nimprovement might lay, antecedently given, and distributed the sum to\r\nbe spent among the Commonwealths according to the ratio of their\r\nrepresentation in the national House of Representatives. As has been\r\npointed out, Madison vetoed this bill on the ground that the power to\r\nenact it was not to be found among the enumerated powers of Congress,\r\nand could not be regarded as a necessary and proper means for carrying\r\nout any of the enumerated powers.\r\n\r\nThe President drew no distinction between the power to construct\r\ninternal improvements and the power to appropriate money for their\r\nconstruction, nor between such powers and the power to administer\r\nthem, or to exercise jurisdiction over them. He regarded all, or any\r\nof these things, as unwarranted by the Constitution. He furthermore\r\ndeclared that the consent of the several Commonwealths to the exercise\r\nof such powers by the general Government could not make the exercise\r\nof them constitutional, unless that consent should be given in the\r\nform of an amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon the vetoed bill in the House of Representatives\r\nmanifested the fact that a substantial majority of that body remained\r\nunconvinced by the President's argument. It is reasonably certain that\r\nMr. Madison's views were not the views of the country at that moment.\r\nA large majority of the people felt that he had abandoned his earlier\r\nfaith in regard to this subject. An analysis of the vote upon the\r\nvetoed bill shows that New England was almost unanimous in opposing\r\nthe measure; that Virginia and North {118} Carolina also opposed it,\r\nthough less decidedly; that New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the\r\nNorthwest, together with South Carolina and Georgia, favored it; and\r\nthat Kentucky and Tennessee inclined to favor it. Certainly, down to\r\n1817, no influence of the slavery interest upon the question of\r\ninternal improvements is discoverable. It was evident that the general\r\nopinion was, that the middle Atlantic section and the Northwest would\r\nreceive the larger share of the benefits of a national system of\r\ninternal improvements. It was also evident that New England viewed the\r\nmatter purely in that light, and that Virginia was impelled wholly by\r\nher ancient principle of strict construction of the powers of the\r\ngeneral Government. It was South Carolina and Georgia whose actions\r\nappeared at this juncture to spring from unselfish and patriotic\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill of 1822 for internal improvements.]\r\n\r\nThe third stage in the development of constitutional interpretation in\r\nreference to this subject was attained in the year 1822. In May of\r\nthat year Congress passed a bill appropriating money for the repair of\r\nthe Cumberland road, and authorizing the President to cause the\r\nerection of toll-gates upon it, and to appoint toll-gatherers. The\r\ntoll charges, and penalties for attempting to avoid paying them, and\r\nfor not keeping to the left in passing, were fixed in the bill itself.\r\nThat is, this bill assumed for the general Government not only the\r\npowers of appropriating and expending money for the construction of\r\nthe road, but the power of operating the road and jurisdiction over\r\nit. The passage of such a bill is certainly very good evidence that\r\nPresident Madison's views, as expressed in his veto message of March\r\n3rd, 1817, were not the views of the country in 1822 upon the subject\r\nof internal improvements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the bill, and analysis of the vote upon it.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting and instructive to analyze the vote upon this bill.\r\nIn the House of Representatives the {119} members from the New England\r\nsection were nearly evenly divided, pro and con. The majority of the\r\nNew Yorkers voted against it. The Pennsylvanians were nearly balanced.\r\nThe Marylanders voted for it. The Virginians were against it by a\r\ndecided majority. The North Carolinians were indifferent. The South\r\nCarolinians and Georgians abandoned their high national ground of\r\n1817, and voted unanimously against it. The Representatives from the\r\nNorthwest went unanimously for it; and those from Kentucky now wheeled\r\ninto line with them. Lastly, while the Tennesseeans still maintained\r\ntheir attitude of indifference, the members from the Commonwealths\r\nsouth of Tennessee, and west of Georgia, all voted for the bill.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the majority in favor of the measure was very large.\r\nOnly the Senators from the Carolinas and Alabama, and one Senator from\r\nMissouri, voted against it.\r\n\r\nThere is somewhat more of an appearance of slavery influence in the\r\nvote upon this bill than upon the bill of 1817, in that South Carolina\r\nshowed herself practically a unit against this bill. Still it is\r\nprobable that this opposition rested upon other grounds. Certainly\r\nwhen we read in the \"Annals of Congress,\" that so stanch a friend of\r\nfree labor, so eminent a lawyer, and so honorable a man as John W.\r\nTaylor, of New York, said of this bill that it was so important in its\r\ncharacter, and proposed such a violation of the Constitution, that he\r\nfelt obliged to call for the yeas and nays upon it, we must concede\r\nthat other motives may have influenced the statesmen of South Carolina\r\nthan such as might have sprung from subserviency to the interests of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill in the interests of the West.]\r\n\r\nIf we review the analysis of the vote in the House of Representatives\r\nwe shall see that the entire {120} West--taking the Appalachian range\r\nas the dividing line, for that period, between the East and the\r\nWest--was for the bill, while the whole East, with the exception of\r\nMaryland, which was specially interested in the road, was either\r\nagainst it or indifferent to it. The Eastern Commonwealths had made\r\ntheir roads with Commonwealth money, and did not wish to assist the\r\nWestern Commonwealths to make theirs by giving them national money\r\nwith which to do it. The West, on the other hand, was new and\r\ncomparatively poor, and wanted the nation to help it out of the mud.\r\nThis is unquestionably the plain statement of the situation from the\r\npoint of view of interests. The interests of slavery played but little\r\npart, if any at all, in the distribution of the vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Monroe's veto, and communication of May 4th,\r\n1822.]\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe promptly vetoed the bill, on the ground that it was\r\nin excess of the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution. He\r\nalso sent a communication, of the same date as the veto, to the House\r\nof Representatives, explaining his views upon those principles of the\r\nConstitution generally, and upon those provisions specially, which\r\ncould be regarded as vesting powers in the general Government\r\nconcerning internal improvements. The paper is prolix, confused, and\r\nconfusing, but, upon the specific question at issue, the propositions\r\nadvanced are definite and intelligible. He held that the power of\r\nCongress in regard to internal improvements was to be found in the\r\nConstitution only by implication, by implication from the power to\r\nappropriate money, and that, therefore, its nature and limitations\r\nwere to be drawn from the character of the power to appropriate money.\r\nHe contended, on the one side, that the power of Congress to\r\nappropriate money was not limited to the objects enumerated in the\r\n{121} Constitution, but was, on the other side, limited by the spirit\r\nof the Constitution to national purposes. He concluded, therefore,\r\nthat Congress was empowered to appropriate money to internal\r\nimprovements of a national character. But he asserted that Congress\r\ncould not, under the power to appropriate money, establish\r\njurisdiction over such improvements, or authorize the executive\r\ndepartment of the Government to administer them. The bill in question\r\ndid just that, and it was for this reason that the President returned\r\nit with his objections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Monroe's argument, and the vote upon the veto.]\r\n\r\nThe President's views were apparently convincing to many who had voted\r\nfor the bill. Upon its passage, the vote in the House of\r\nRepresentatives was eighty-seven for, and sixty-eight against, the\r\nmeasure. After the veto, it stood sixty-eight yeas and seventy-two\r\nnays.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely assumed that the view expressed by President Monroe\r\nin the paper accompanying the veto of this bill was the view which\r\nprevailed throughout the country in the year 1824. It may be also said\r\nthat the power of Congress to authorize the President to expend the\r\nappropriation by causing the improvements to be planned and\r\nconstructed was generally regarded, in 1824, as a necessary\r\nconsequence of the power to appropriate money for the same. The acts\r\nof Congress appropriating money for the construction and repair of\r\nroads, canals, etc., after, as well as before, that date, seem to\r\nproceed upon this theory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congressional Act of 1824 for distinguishing national from\r\nlocal improvements.]\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty which lay in the way of the realization of\r\nPresident Monroe's principle of the appropriation of national money\r\nfor internal improvements of a national character was the proper\r\ndetermination of the question as to what improvements were really of\r\nthat character. The danger was that the {122} appropriation bills\r\nwould become log-rolling measures for the purpose of obtaining\r\nnational money for matters of local concern. This difficulty was\r\ndistinctly felt, and Congress undertook to meet it by the Act of April\r\n30th, 1824, which authorized the President to cause \"surveys, plans,\r\nand estimates to be made of the routes of such roads and canals as he\r\nmight deem of national importance,\" and required him to lay the same\r\nbefore Congress.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it is apparent that, down to the presidential election\r\nof 1824, the development of a pro-slavery, strict-constructionist,\r\n\"States' rights\" party is hardly to be discovered in the attitude of\r\nthe different sections of the country toward the question of internal\r\nimprovements. Despite the fact that the slaveholders had become\r\nconscious during the Missouri struggle that their interests demanded\r\nthe establishment of a particularistic view of the Constitution and a\r\nparticularistic practice in the working of the governmental system of\r\nthe country, not much progress had been made, in the period between\r\n1820 and 1824, in the way of twisting the policies developed during\r\nthe previous eight years into line with such a view. In fact the\r\nforeign relations of the United States were again, in 1822, of a\r\nsomewhat threatening character, and the consideration of these\r\nrelations was acting as a certain hindrance to the development of\r\nparties upon internal issues.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign relations during Monroe's second term.]\r\n\r\nThe menace, or perhaps it would be more correct to say the apparent\r\nmenace, came from two quarters; but in neither case did it relate\r\nimmediately to the territory or interests of the United States. In\r\nboth cases it was consequential and more or less remote.\r\n\r\n{123} [Sidenote: Russia and the northwest coast of America.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the movements of Russia in the North Pacific had\r\ncreated grave apprehensions. At the close of the first decade of the\r\ncentury the Russian American Company put forward a claim to the\r\nterritory of the North American continent along the Pacific coast from\r\nBehring's Strait to the mouth of the Columbia River, and even to\r\npoints south of the Columbia. Really this claim came into conflict\r\nonly with the rights of Great Britain and Spain, but the United\r\nStates, having the presentiment of its future, if not a legal claim to\r\nany part of this territory as a part of Louisiana, regarded the\r\nRussian movement with jealous discontent. And when, on September 16th,\r\nthe Russian Czar issued an edict, asserting Russia's rights to the\r\nNorth Pacific territory from Behring's Strait to the fifty-first\r\nparallel of north latitude, it was natural that this discontent should\r\nbecome hostile in its nature. The Government of the United States\r\ndeclared its dissent from the Russian pretensions, and the matter\r\nrested momentarily with that.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Holy Alliance.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the other danger was developing. The European\r\nreaction against the terrible excesses of the Revolution and the\r\ndespotism of Bonaparte had assumed the form of an alliance between the\r\nGovernments of the great continental states, Russia, Austria, Prussia,\r\nand France, for the purpose of maintaining each by the power of all\r\nagainst the reappearance of revolutionary movements anywhere. Great\r\nBritain had scented in this Holy Alliance a combination of continental\r\npowers which might prove, in some degree at least, as dangerous to her\r\ncontinental relations as the commercial system of Bonaparte had been.\r\nThere is no doubt, too, that there was a large party in England which\r\nrepudiated the fundamental {124} political doctrine of the Holy\r\nAlliance Powers, the doctrine of the _jure divino_ monarchy. England\r\nhad, in fact, repudiated that doctrine at the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. For these reasons the British Government had declined to\r\nenter the Holy League, and regarded it with suspicion and\r\nill-concealed hostility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Congress at Verona.]\r\n\r\nThe United States Government paid little attention to its workings so\r\nlong as they were confined to purely European relations, but when, in\r\n1822, at the congress of these powers at Verona, which had been\r\nassembled to consider the question of aiding the Spanish Government to\r\nsuppress the insurrection against its authority in Spain, the subject\r\nof aiding that Government to re-establish its authority over Spain's\r\nrevolting colonies in North and South America was discussed, serious\r\napprehensions were roused in both Great Britain and the United States.\r\nIt was stated, and generally believed, in the United States, that the\r\nplan was the re-establishment of the Spanish power over all of Spain's\r\nAmerican possessions, except Mexico and California, and the cession of\r\nMexico to France, and of California to Russia, in consideration of the\r\nmilitary aid to be rendered to Spain by these two great powers in the\r\nwork of restoration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Adams' declaration to Baron Tuyl.]\r\n\r\nTo the United States the supposed intentions of Russia in respect to\r\nthe Pacific coast appeared the more immediate danger, and the United\r\nStates Government addressed its diplomacy to this question first. On\r\nJuly 17th, 1823, the Secretary of State, Mr. John Quincy Adams,\r\ndeclared to the Russian Minister at Washington, Baron Tuyl, that \"we\r\nshould contest the right of Russia to any territorial establishment on\r\nthis continent, and that we should assume distinctly the principle\r\nthat the American {125} continents are no longer subjects for any new\r\nEuropean colonial establishments.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Canning's proposal to Mr. Rush.]\r\n\r\nThe following month, the British Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr.\r\nGeorge Canning, proposed to the Minister of the United States at the\r\nCourt of St. James, Mr. Richard Rush, a joint declaration by the\r\nBritish Government and the Government of the United States to Europe,\r\nthat the two Governments would not remain indifferent to an\r\nintervention by the Holy Alliance Powers to restore the Spanish\r\nauthority over Spain's revolting American colonies. Both commercial\r\ninterests and political principles moved the British Government to\r\nmake this proposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Canning's declaration to Prince Polignac.]\r\n\r\nMr. Rush had not been instructed by his Government in anticipation of\r\nthe British advances, but he offered to assume the responsibility of\r\njoining for the United States in the declaration, provided the British\r\nGovernment would acknowledge the independence of the revolting Spanish\r\ncolonies in America, as the Government of the United States had\r\nalready done. The British minister was not then prepared to go so far,\r\nand the plan of the joint declaration fell through. But Mr. Canning\r\ndeclared for his Government to the French ambassador at St. James,\r\nPrince Polignac, that Great Britain would resist any intervention on\r\nthe part of the Holy Alliance Powers in the question between Spain and\r\nher revolting American colonies, and the President of the United\r\nStates, in his annual message of December 2nd, 1823, stated the\r\nposition which the United States Government and the people of the\r\nUnited States ought, in his opinion, to assume, and would, in his\r\nopinion, assume, in regard to the whole subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Monroe Doctrine.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Monroe dealt first with the question of Russian {126} colonization\r\nupon the Pacific coast. After informing Congress of the instructions\r\nwhich had been given to the Minister representing the United States at\r\nSt. Petersburg for negotiating with the Czar's Government, he said:\r\n\"In the discussions to which this interest has given rise, and in the\r\narrangements by which they may terminate, the occasion has been judged\r\nproper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and interests\r\nof the United States are involved, that the American continents, by\r\nthe free and independent condition which they have assumed and\r\nmaintained, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future\r\ncolonization by any European powers.\"\r\n\r\nToward the close of the message Mr. Monroe addressed himself to the\r\nother question, the question of intervention by the Holy Alliance\r\nPowers in the contest between Spain and her revolting American\r\ncolonies in the following language: \"In the wars of European powers,\r\nin matters relating to themselves, we have never taken any part, nor\r\ndoes it comport with our policy so to do. It is only when our rights\r\nare invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make\r\npreparations for our defence. With the movements in this hemisphere we\r\nare, of necessity, more immediately connected, and by causes which\r\nmust be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The\r\npolitical system of the allied powers is essentially different in this\r\nrespect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that which\r\nexists in their respective governments, and to the defence of our own,\r\nwhich has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and\r\nmatured by the wisdom of our most enlightened citizens, and under\r\nwhich we have enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is\r\ndevoted. We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations\r\nexisting between the United {127} States and those powers, to declare\r\nthat we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their\r\nsystem to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and\r\nsafety. With the existing colonies of any European power we have not\r\ninterfered and shall not interfere, but with the Governments who have\r\ndeclared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence\r\nwe have on great consideration and on just principles acknowledged, we\r\ncould not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them,\r\nor controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European\r\npower, in any other light than as a manifestation of an unfriendly\r\ndisposition toward the United States.... It is impossible that the\r\nallied powers should extend their political system to any portion of\r\neither continent without endangering our peace and happiness; nor can\r\nanyone believe that our Southern brethren, if left to themselves,\r\nwould adopt it of their own accord. It is equally impossible,\r\ntherefore, that we should behold such interposition, in any form, with\r\nindifference. If we look to the comparative strength and resources of\r\nSpain and these new Governments, and their distance from each other,\r\nit must be obvious that she can never subdue them. It is still the\r\ntrue policy of the United States to leave the parties to themselves,\r\nin the hope that other powers will pursue the same course.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The meaning of the Monroe propositions in 1824.]\r\n\r\nThese statements by Mr. Monroe of his opinion as to what the diplomacy\r\nof the United States ought to be, and would be, upon the subjects of\r\nthe establishment of new European colonies in America, the\r\nintervention of the Holy Alliance Powers in the question between Spain\r\nand her revolting American colonies, and the forcible imposition by\r\nthese powers of the _jure divino_ monarchy {128} upon these peoples,\r\nwho had established republican forms of government for themselves,\r\nhave had the name fixed upon them by a later generation of \"The Monroe\r\nDoctrine.\" There is no difficulty in understanding these statements as\r\nMr. Monroe understood them.\r\n\r\nNeither he nor his Secretary of State ever called them a \"Doctrine.\"\r\nWith them they were simply the opinions of the Administration in\r\nregard to the course which the United States ought to pursue, and\r\nwould probably pursue, in meeting certain exigencies, the possibility\r\nof the arising of which passed entirely away before the close of the\r\nfirst half of this century. These opinions were simply that the United\r\nStates ought to resist, and would resist, the planting of any new\r\ncolonial establishments in America, or the intervention of the Holy\r\nAlliance Powers in the question between Spain and her revolting\r\nAmerican colonies, or the forcible imposition of the _jure divino_\r\nmonarchy, the political system of these powers, upon the new\r\nrepublican governments of South and Middle America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure to commit Congress to these propositions.]\r\n\r\nThe month following the publication of this message, January, 1824,\r\nMr. Clay attempted to move Congress to indorse that part of the\r\nPresident's opinions which referred to the intervention of the Allied\r\nPowers in the conflict between Spain and her revolting colonies, but\r\nthe resolution which he offered to that effect was laid on the table,\r\nand never called up. Mr. Poinsett, of South Carolina, made a like\r\nattempt later, but with no more success. The Congress of that day had\r\naltogether too much intelligence to make diplomatic opinions, advanced\r\nby the Administration, either laws of the land, or joint or concurrent\r\nresolutions of the legislative department of the Government.\r\n\r\n{129} [Sidenote: The particularistic reaction scarcely discoverable\r\nbefore 1824.]\r\n\r\nThus neither in the question of the tariff, nor in that of internal\r\nimprovements, nor, naturally, in the diplomatic questions, is anything\r\nmore than the faint beginnings of the particularistic reaction to be\r\ndiscovered in the period between 1820 and 1824. In fact, it may be\r\nsaid that the year 1820 marks roughly the date of the extinction of\r\nthe old Federal party, and of the almost complete absorption of the\r\nwhole voting population in the Republican party. In the presidential\r\nelection of that year the candidate of the Republican party, Mr.\r\nMonroe, received two hundred and thirty-one of the two hundred and\r\nthirty-two electoral votes cast, and the one elector who did not vote\r\nfor him was a Republican. The Federal party did not even undertake to\r\npresent a ticket. From the point of view of the preservation of its\r\nown dominance, the Federal party had committed two grave errors, one\r\nof principle and one of policy. It had held to the principle that the\r\nmass of men are not fit to govern themselves, but should be governed\r\nby the few who are wise and good; and it had adopted the policy of too\r\nclose alliance with the commercial interests of the country. The\r\nlevelling, not to say debasing, influences of the French political\r\nphilosophy, which rolled like a tidal wave over the country during the\r\nlast decade of the eighteenth century, and was worked up into a\r\npolitical dogma by Jefferson and his disciples, together with the\r\nreflex influence of the practical equality which established itself\r\namong the first adventurers who settled the lands beyond the\r\nAlleghanies, destroyed the Federal party, upon the side of principle;\r\nwhile the great extension of the agricultural interests, produced by\r\nthese same settlements, made it intolerable upon the side of policy.\r\nThe earlier advantage which the Federal party, as the upholder of\r\ncentralization, enjoyed {130} over the Republican party, as the\r\nchampion of \"States'-rights,\" had been lost by the nationalization of\r\nthe Republican party through the War of 1812, and the\r\ndenationalization of the Federal party through the same experiences.\r\nIn 1820, therefore, there was only one party in fact and in principle.\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that the struggle of the years 1819 and 1820\r\nover the Missouri question had sowed the seeds of dissension in this\r\nall-comprehending party; but four years did not constitute a period of\r\ntime sufficient for their completed growth and fructification. The\r\npresidential contest of 1824 could not, therefore, he fought under the\r\nissues of party principles. It was little more, and, under the\r\ncircumstances, it could be little more, than a personal contest\r\nbetween the leaders of the Republican party. The result of it,\r\nhowever, contributed very largely to the development of political\r\ndifferences, and to the organization of parties upon the basis of\r\nthese differences. It must, therefore, be described with some\r\nparticularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{131}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1824\r\n\r\nGeneral Character of the Presidential Contest of 1824--John Quincy\r\nAdams--DeWitt Clinton--William H.

The \"Virginia dynasty\" became\r\nextinct with the expiration of Monroe's second term, and the way was\r\nopen for anyone to enter the lists who was willing to risk the shocks\r\nof the encounter.\r\n\r\nAt no time in our history has the roll of our political nobility been\r\nmore full of brilliant names and characters.\r\n\r\n{132} [Sidenote: John Quincy Adams.]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there was John Quincy Adams, the Secretary of State, the\r\n\"knight without fear and without reproach,\" blunt, grim, almost rude,\r\nthrough an unconscious suspicion that politeness might encourage the\r\napproach of temptation; now fifty-seven years old, and trained in\r\nstatecraft and diplomacy almost from childhood; the best equipped\r\nstatesman and the most experienced statesman that America had up to\r\nthat time produced; ready to serve his country in any honorable\r\ncapacity to which that country might freely call him, and just as\r\nready to withdraw from that service when his country indicated the\r\ndesire to dispense with him; puritanic, austere, and to the last\r\ndegree patriotic, his one qualification for the presidential office\r\nwas the capacity to discharge its duties wisely, honestly, and\r\nloyally, a qualification which too rarely wins in popular elections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DeWitt Clinton.]\r\n\r\nThen, there was DeWitt Clinton, noble in personal appearance,\r\ndignified in manners, eloquent in debate, sagacious and far-sighted in\r\nbusiness, a lover of science and a scientist himself; the great\r\npromoter of the Erie Canal, which was now on the point of completion,\r\nand which was destined to revolutionize the commerce of the country;\r\nstill only fifty-five years of age, although he had been considered\r\nmore than twenty years before as the most promising man of the nation,\r\nand had within that period been United States Senator, mayor of New\r\nYork City, candidate for the presidency against Mr. Madison, and twice\r\nGovernor of New York.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William H. Crawford.]\r\n\r\nThen, there was William H. Crawford, a Virginian by birth and a\r\nGeorgian by education; a man of large wealth and of imposing bearing;\r\nenjoying a very great reputation for statesmanship without any easily\r\ndiscoverable foundation therefor; now {133} fifty-two years of age,\r\nand having already been United States Senator, Minister to France,\r\nSecretary of War, and Secretary of the Treasury, which latter office\r\nhe still held; with the exception, perhaps, of Martin Van Buren, the\r\nmost astute politician among the great men of his time. He had the\r\npolitical friendship and support of Van Buren. The two seem to have\r\nbeen attracted to each other by the similarity of their methods. He\r\nwas the author of the law of 1820, limiting the term of the officials\r\nof the Treasury to four years, the first step in the direction of\r\nmaking the United States civil service a political machine, such as\r\nVan Buren and his fellows in the \"Regency\" had made out of the civil\r\nservice of the Commonwealth of New York. It is not astonishing that\r\nhe, rather than any of the other aspirants for the presidency,\r\nprocured the assembling of a caucus of the members of Congress, and\r\nsecured a nomination from it, thus making himself the \"regular\"\r\ncandidate. Not a third of the members, however, appeared at the\r\ncaucus, and the nomination did him more harm than good.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John C. Calhoun.]\r\n\r\nThen, there was Calhoun, grave, pure, and patriotic as Adams himself,\r\nand almost as puritanic; South Carolinian by birth, Scotch-Irish by\r\nblood, Presbyterian in religion, and New Englander by education;\r\ngreat, both in dialectics and in the administration of affairs; rather\r\nmore given to introspection than to objective research; speculative,\r\ntherefore, rather than inductive in his mental processes; most\r\nfascinating in conversation, kind and generous in his feelings, and a\r\ngentleman everywhere and upon all occasions; a personality to be\r\nlooked up to with reverence, admiration, and confidence. He was still\r\nonly forty-two years of age, and yet he had already passed fourteen\r\nyears in public service, first as member of the South Carolina\r\nLegislature, then as member of Congress, and {134} then as Monroe's\r\nSecretary of War for both terms, which office he still held.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daniel Webster.]\r\n\r\nThen, there was Webster, of the same age with Calhoun, though as yet\r\nonly five years in public service; the most majestic personality which\r\nAmerica has ever produced, though born of the hardy yeomanry of New\r\nEngland; profound in thought, grandly eloquent in speech, and royally\r\nimpressive in bearing; full of good cheer, in spite of the puritanism\r\nof his ancestry, enjoying his friends and adored by his friends; a\r\nsplendid lawyer, a great statesman, and an incomparable orator--in a\r\nword, a demigod; by no means so austere in character as in appearance;\r\nliable, as genius too often is, to sometimes break over the restraints\r\nof customary morality, but doing it in so grand and natural a manner\r\nas to make the rule which he had broken seem narrow, insignificant,\r\nand mean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry Clay.]\r\n\r\nAnd then, there was Clay, the most genuine American of them all;\r\nrather superficial in thought, entrancing in his oratory, with a voice\r\nas winning as the siren's song, elegant and gallant in his manners,\r\nperfectly irresistible in conversation, jovial and cheery and happy,\r\nthe prince of good fellows, loved and worshipped by everybody who knew\r\nhim; enthusiastic in his patriotism, seeking to make his country not\r\nonly independent of the world in all its policies but the leader of\r\nthe world in civilization, a zealous propagandist of American\r\nrepublicanism, the \"lion-hearted knight\" of American statesmen. He was\r\nnow in the prime of his manhood, forty-seven years of age. He had been\r\na member of the Senate of the United States at thirty, but it was upon\r\nthe floor of the House of Representatives, and as Speaker of the\r\nHouse, which office he again held, that he had won his most brilliant\r\nlaurels. He was at the moment the great champion of the {135} tariff,\r\nof national internal improvements, and of the cause of the South\r\nAmerican States in their struggle for independence against Spain and\r\nPortugal--of what he called the American system of political and\r\nindustrial independence. Of his competitors only Crawford differed\r\nwith him in regard to these principles in anything more than a slight\r\ndegree. Crawford was considered as rather more particularistic,\r\nespecially in his views on the question of internal improvements. But\r\nClay, with his genial self-confidence and irresistible self-assertion,\r\nhad assumed in the popular mind, as well as in the Congress, the part\r\nof the leading representative of these policies. He had the advantage\r\nor the disadvantage of that, whichever it might prove to be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Andrew Jackson.]\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, Jackson, the noblest Roman of them all; ignorant and\r\nirascible indeed, but virtuous, brave, and patriotic beyond any cavil\r\nor question; faithful and devoted in his domestic life, absolutely\r\nunapproachable by pecuniary inducements; the best of friends and the\r\nmost implacable of enemies; quick, hasty in forming his judgments and\r\ntenacious beyond expression in holding to them; prone to elevate every\r\nwhim and impulse to a behest of conscience; earnest, terrible in the\r\ninflexibility of his purposes; excited by opposition to an\r\never-increasing degree of determination; unflinching and recklessly\r\ndaring in the performance of what he felt to be his duty; restless\r\nunder the legal restraints which might appear to hinder him in the\r\ndischarge of duty and the accomplishment of any great enterprise\r\nintrusted to him; hostile to all gradations of power and privilege,\r\nand inclined to break through any official net-work interposed between\r\nhimself and the rank and file subject to his command; a great soldier,\r\nand yet a man of the people; the military hero of the country and a\r\nmartyr to the persecutions of the {136} politicians--here were\r\ncertainly qualities calculated to rouse the enthusiasm of the masses,\r\nif not of the classes. He was now fifty-seven years of age, and was\r\nnot in strong health. He had shown no qualities of statesmanship,\r\nalthough he had been twice a member of the Senate of the United\r\nStates, and was at the moment holding that most advantageous position\r\nfor a display of civic talent; but he had the fortune to live at a\r\ntime and in a country when and where the lower strata of society were\r\njust coming to a full participation in political power, and when and\r\nwhere high qualifications simply to discharge the duties of an office\r\nwere beginning to be regarded by the majority of the people as\r\ndisqualifications for holding the office.\r\n\r\nThese were by no means all of the great characters from among whom the\r\nnation had its choice in 1824, but they were unquestionably the first\r\non the list. Different as they were in personal qualities, they were\r\nnot yet far apart in political opinions. Crawford leaned more toward\r\n\"States' rights\" than the others. Clay was more pronounced in the\r\nopposite direction. While Jackson was rather more uncommitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nomination of presidential candidates in 1824.]\r\n\r\nWebster was not put forward by anybody, and did not offer himself as a\r\ncandidate. Clay was nominated by the legislature of Kentucky. Jackson\r\nwas nominated by the legislature of Tennessee, and by two Pennsylvania\r\nconventions. While Adams had the advantage of the precedent which, for\r\nnearly a quarter of a century, had pointed to the Secretary of State\r\nas the natural successor to the presidential office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of the electors to elect the President.]\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the electors did not choose any one of the\r\nfour, since the Constitution requires a majority of the whole number\r\nof the electors for a choice. Jackson led with ninety-nine votes;\r\nAdams was next with eighty-four; {137} Crawford followed with\r\nforty-one; and Clay came last with thirty-seven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Territorial distribution of the electoral vote.]\r\n\r\nThe electoral vote was distributed territorially as might have been\r\nnaturally anticipated, except in two particulars. These were, the\r\nfailure of Van Buren to secure the electoral vote of New York for\r\nCrawford, and the solid vote of Pennsylvania and South Carolina for\r\nJackson. These facts had some significance in connection with\r\nsubsequent developments, and require a little explanation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New York in the Election of 1824.]\r\n\r\nNew York was one of the Commonwealths which, down to 1824, permitted\r\nthe legislature to choose the presidential electors. In 1823 the\r\nlegislature was still under the control of Van Buren and his\r\ncolleagues in the \"Regency,\" the Albany machine, and had the election\r\ntaken place in 1823 he could doubtless have delivered the electoral\r\nvote entire to Crawford. But one of Jackson's shrewdest supporters,\r\nprobably Clinton, started the scheme for transferring the choice of\r\nthe electors from the legislature to the voters. This, if successful,\r\nwould destroy the control of the \"Regency\" over the electoral vote.\r\nThe opposition of the \"Regency\" to the bill, when it appeared in the\r\nlegislature, caused its rejection by that body; but the popular\r\nindignation was roused to such a pitch against the \"Regency\" and its\r\nadherents in the legislature, in consequence of this act, that, in the\r\nCommonwealth elections of 1824, the \"Regency\" party was driven from\r\npower, and the new legislature chose electors who cast the electoral\r\nvote of the Commonwealth chiefly for Adams, as the Northern candidate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South Carolina in the Election of 1824.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that South Carolina cast her electoral vote for Jackson\r\ninstead of for Crawford is good evidence that there was still no\r\nquestion of \"States' rights\" versus the powers of the Union at issue,\r\nor that South {138} Carolina was still nationally disposed; and that,\r\neither there was no tariff question at issue, or South Carolina had\r\nnot yet clearly discovered the hostility of the tariff to her\r\ninterests, or she believed Jackson to be opposed to the tariff.\r\n\r\nJackson, or rather his manager, William B. Lewis, a most astute\r\npolitician, had written a letter to a Dr. Coleman, of Warrenton, Va.,\r\nupon the subject of the tariff. The letter was ostensibly a reply to\r\none from Dr. Coleman, inquiring of Jackson his views upon this\r\nquestion. Very probably, however, Dr. Coleman's letter was also\r\ndictated by Mr. Lewis. Jackson's reply contained nothing definite in\r\nregard to the subject. It was a first-class political document, that\r\nis, it was a document which could be interpreted to mean anything\r\nwhich might be made necessary or desirable by time, place, and\r\ncircumstances. In a word, Lewis had made for Jackson a sort of _tabula\r\nrasa_ record on the subject of the tariff. In such a state of things\r\nit is certainly reasonable to ascribe South Carolina's preference for\r\nJackson to the facts that he claimed to be her son by birth, and that\r\nCalhoun, rightly discerning Jackson to be the coming man, withdrew\r\nfrom the race for the presidency, and was regarded as running for the\r\nvice-presidency on the Jackson ticket.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pennsylvania in the Election of 1824.]\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat more difficult to account for the attitude of\r\nPennsylvania. We are now so accustomed to consider Pennsylvania the\r\n\"tariff State\" _par excellence_, that it is difficult to conceive of a\r\ntime when she was not such. She was indeed, in 1824, for the tariff,\r\nbut her interests had not then become so completely linked together\r\nwith it as after 1840. In 1824 her vast beds of anthracite had not\r\nbeen applied to the preparation of her iron ores, in fact {139} had\r\nhardly been discovered. Pennsylvania west of the Alleghanies was then\r\nan agricultural country, and was filled with a population intensely\r\ndemocratic and almost lawless. So far as they had any political\r\nscience it was based upon the most radical postulates of the French\r\nphilosophy. The principal \"plank\" of the platform of the Harrisburg\r\nconvention of March 4th, 1824, which nominated Jackson, read as\r\nfollows: \"This artificial system of cabinet succession to the\r\npresidency is little less dangerous and anti-republican than the\r\nhereditary monarchies of Europe. If a link in this chain of successive\r\nsecretary dynasties be not broken now, then may we be fettered by it\r\nforever. Andrew Jackson comes pure, untrammelled, and unpledged from\r\nthe people.\" Adams, Crawford, and Calhoun were then members of\r\nPresident Monroe's cabinet, and Clay was Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Jackson alone of all the candidates seemed to possess\r\nthe qualifications required by the Harrisburg doctrine. While this may\r\nexplain the attachment of the Pennsylvania Republicans to Jackson, we\r\nmust not forget that the remnant of the Pennsylvania Federalists were\r\nalso for him. In 1816 Jackson had written some letters to President\r\nMonroe advising him not to ignore the Federalists in his appointments\r\nto office, but to unite the country by showing himself superior to the\r\ndistinctions of party in his Administration. These letters were now\r\ndrawn forth and published by Jackson's manager, and the inference\r\nwhich they conveyed was that Jackson would follow this policy, in case\r\nhe should be chosen to the presidency. Even Webster was inclined to\r\nhim, and Mrs. Webster was entirely won by his gallantry. Jackson in\r\nthe role of a fascinating gentleman and a popular ladies' man is\r\nhardly the usual character under which the imagination of this\r\ngeneration pictures him. It is, {140} nevertheless, strictly true that\r\nthe \"Old Hero\" knew how to make himself very acceptable to the ladies.\r\nPennsylvania was, chiefly, by this conjunction of influences, carried\r\nfor Jackson by an overwhelming majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Election in the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the electors to give a majority to any one of the\r\ncandidates threw the election into the House of Representatives, which\r\nis empowered by the Constitution to choose, in such a case, one of the\r\nthree who shall have received the highest number of electoral votes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clay master of the situation.]\r\n\r\nFrom the day when it became known that the new President must be\r\nchosen in this manner to the day of the election by the House, that\r\nis, from about the middle of December to the ninth day of February,\r\nthe politicians in Washington were \"laying pipe,\" \"pulling wires,\" and\r\n\"making deals.\" It soon became manifest that Clay, while he could not\r\nbe chosen himself, since he could not be legally voted for, was the\r\nmaster of the situation. So great was his popularity with the House\r\nthat, it is almost certain, he would have been chosen to the great\r\noffice himself had he been among the three having the highest number\r\nof electoral votes. Everybody reasoned, therefore, that not only the\r\nRepresentatives from the Commonwealths which had given their electoral\r\nvotes to Clay would follow his lead in voting in the House, but that\r\nmany others from other Commonwealths would act under inspiration from\r\nhim. After a good deal of talk among the members of the House and the\r\npoliticians generally as to whether the members were bound to vote as\r\nthe electors from their respective Commonwealths had voted, and as to\r\nwhether the legislatures of the respective Commonwealths possessed any\r\npower to instruct the members of the House of Representatives from the\r\nseveral Commonwealths in regard to {141} the casting of their votes,\r\nthe opinion finally prevailed that each Representative was entirely\r\nfree to vote according to his own judgment and preference; and that\r\nmeant that the popular and persuasive Speaker would be able to carry\r\nenough votes with him to elect the candidate upon whom his favor might\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clay's support of Adams, and Kremer's charge of bargain and\r\ncorruption.]\r\n\r\nPropositions were made to him from the friends of the different\r\ncandidates, but he held them all at arm's length. It might have been\r\neasily foreseen that he would support Adams. Crawford was a man of\r\nexhausted powers, unfit physically and mentally to discharge the\r\nduties of the great office. Jackson was only a military chieftain,\r\naccording to Clay's view a very dangerous character for the\r\npresidency. There remained only Adams, probably the best-fitted man in\r\nthe country for the office. It was generally felt, for several days\r\nbefore the election, that these considerations would determine Clay's\r\ncourse of action. There were those, however, who were ready to ascribe\r\nClay's supposed attitude to other, and more selfish, motives. An\r\ninsignificant member from Pennsylvania, Kremer by name, gave it out in\r\npublic print that there was a bargain between Adams and Clay,\r\naccording to which Clay was to support Adams, and to receive in return\r\nthe secretaryship of State. This happened on January 28th, 1825, just\r\nafter the delegations from Ohio and Kentucky in the House had declared\r\ntheir intention of supporting Adams. The small mind of Kremer could\r\nnot conceive of this attitude on the part of Clay save from the point\r\nof view of selfish interests. Clay immediately called for an\r\ninvestigation of the charge by the House, but Kremer sneaked out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The election of Adams by the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nOn February 9th, 1825, the two Houses of Congress met in joint\r\nassembly to count the electoral vote. It {142} was immediately found\r\nthat no candidate had a majority, and that, therefore, the choice lay\r\nwith the House. The House, on the same day, and on the first ballot,\r\nelected Adams. The delegations from thirteen of the twenty-four\r\nCommonwealths voted for him. The delegations from seven voted for\r\nJackson; and those from four for Crawford. Adams received the votes of\r\nthe delegations from all of the Commonwealths which had given their\r\nelectoral votes, or the majority of their electoral votes, to himself\r\nand to Clay, and from three of the Commonwealths which had given the\r\nmajority of their electoral vote to Jackson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clay and the Secretaryship of State.]\r\n\r\nThe twelfth day of February, 1825, is the date in Mr. Adams' diary\r\nunder which he recorded his offer of the secretaryship of State to Mr.\r\nClay. We find in the diary, for the day before this, an account of a\r\nvisit from a Mr. G. Sullivan, who told Mr. Adams \"that the Calhounites\r\nsaid that if Mr. Clay should be appointed Secretary of State, a\r\ndetermined opposition to the administration would be organized from\r\nthe outset; that the opposition would use the name of General Jackson\r\nas its head; and that the administration would be supported only by\r\nthe New England States--New York being doubtful, the West much\r\ndivided, and strongly favoring Jackson as a Western man, Virginia\r\nalready in opposition, and all the South decidedly adverse.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Threats of the organization of an anti-administration\r\nparty.]\r\n\r\nExactly who the Calhounites were at that moment, as distinct from the\r\nfollowers of Adams and Clay, is difficult to determine, since all the\r\nelectors who voted for Adams for President also voted for Calhoun for\r\nVice-President, except eight electors from Connecticut and one from\r\nNew Hampshire, and of the thirty-seven electors who voted {143} for\r\nClay, at least seven of them voted also for Calhoun. It was Crawford's\r\nsupporters who had opposed Calhoun for the second place, not one of\r\nthem having voted for him. This declaration made by Mr. Sullivan\r\nmeant, therefore, that Jackson's friends were going to organize an\r\nopposition party to the Adams-Clay Administration and that the\r\nVice-President was going to cast his lot with them.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a threat of danger, but Adams was not the man to be\r\nfrightened from the course which he had chosen as just and politic. He\r\nimmediately offered the first position in the cabinet to Clay, and,\r\nafter some six days of reflection and of consultation with friends,\r\nClay accepted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bargain between Clay and Adams a mere suspicion.]\r\n\r\nNo sufficient evidence has ever been produced to convince a judicial\r\nmind that Adams and Clay had come to any understanding in regard to\r\nthis matter either before Clay announced publicly that he should\r\nsupport Adams, or afterward. But men generally do not have judicial\r\nminds. \"Diffused distrust and indiscriminate suspicion\" mark the\r\nattitude of the vulgar mind toward personages in high station.\r\nPoliticians know only too well that this is one of the most potent\r\nforces which can be called into play, and they know only too well how\r\nto take advantage of it. Conscious as both Adams and Clay doubtless\r\nwere of their own rectitude, they did not sufficiently appreciate the\r\nproneness of the masses to believe in the corruption of their\r\nsuperiors. Neither did they correctly appreciate the ungenerous and\r\nuncandid spirit of the leaders among their opponents in clinging to\r\nthis charge, and reiterating it, after they had failed to substantiate\r\nit by any credible evidence. They certainly did not comprehend that\r\nthey had given their opponents a shibboleth which would lead them to\r\ncertain victory.\r\n\r\n{144} [Sidenote: Clay's nomination to the secretaryship of State in\r\nthe Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe opposition began at once their attack in the Senate under the\r\nissue of Clay's appointment. Fifteen of the forty-one Senators present\r\nvoted against it. Among the fifteen was Jackson, who, upon his way, a\r\nfew days later, from Washington to his home in Tennessee, repeated and\r\nre-enlivened the charge of \"bargain and corruption.\" It is more than\r\nprobable that Jackson believed in it himself. He was so convinced of\r\nhis own honesty that he believed every one who differed with him to be\r\ndishonest. This is a trait of character frequently met with, and it is\r\na most dangerous force with which to deal. The \"Old Hero\" possessed it\r\nin an extraordinary degree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The composition of the new Anti-administration party.]\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that there were no material differences in political\r\nprinciples, and the further fact that Adams retained Monroe's cabinet\r\nso far as he could, appointing new members only to positions made\r\nvacant therein by his own and Calhoun's promotion to the presidency\r\nand the vice-presidency, and by Crawford's refusal to accept the\r\nTreasury for another term, it was now perfectly evident that Jackson,\r\nCalhoun, and Crawford, with their followers, were determined upon an\r\norganized opposition to the Adams-Clay Administration, no matter what\r\nprinciples and policies that Administration should follow; that\r\nJackson would, on account of his popularity with the masses, be put\r\nforward as the head of the new party; and that the cry of \"bargain and\r\ncorruption\" between the President and the chief officer of his\r\nAdministration, for robbing the \"Old Hero\" of his rights and the\r\npeople of their choice, was to be their watchword in the conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{145}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\r\n\r\nPersonal Differences, and Party Division--Military Confederation of\r\nthe Spanish-American States--Invitation to the United States to send\r\nRepresentatives to the Congress at Panama--The Acceptance of the\r\nInvitation--Opposition in the Senate to the sending of Representatives\r\nto Panama--Popular Sympathy in the United States for the\r\nSouth-American States--The President's Nominations Confirmed--The\r\nHaytian Question at the Congress--Cuba and Porto Rico--Real Nature of\r\nthe Opposition to the Panama Mission--The Failure of the Panama\r\nCongress--Adams on Internal Improvements in his Message of December\r\n6th, 1825--Van Buren's Resolution against Internal Improvements--The\r\nPractices of the Adams Administration in respect to Internal\r\nImprovements--The Chief Practical Difficulty in the way of a National\r\nSystem of Internal Improvements--The Tariff of 1824 a Failure--The\r\nTariff Bill of 1827--Development of the Industrial Antithesis between\r\nthe North and the South--Hostility to the Measure in South\r\nCarolina--The Tariff of 1828--The Character of the Bill as Reflected\r\nin the Analysis of the Vote Upon It--The Tariff of 1828 not a Complete\r\nParty Measure--The Presidential Campaign of 1828 still Dominated by\r\nPersonal Considerations--Election of Jackson--Advent of the\r\nParvenus--Foreign Affairs under Jackson's Administration--The\r\nDemocratic Party and its Divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal differences, and party division.]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any well defined differences in political opinions,\r\nand in the state of determined {146} personal hostility between the\r\nleaders developed by the election of 1824, the fact that Adams and\r\nClay took broad national views, placed a liberal construction upon the\r\nConstitution, and insisted upon the employment of all the powers\r\nvested by it in the general Government to the highest point of their\r\nusefulness in the promotion of the general welfare, had the natural\r\neffect of forcing the opposition upon the opposite grounds, and,\r\ntherefore, tended to make a particularistic party, the so-called\r\n\"States' rights\" party, out of the Jackson-Calhoun-Crawford faction.\r\n\r\nOne of the most patent indications of the correctness of the\r\nproposition that the opposition in principle between the National\r\nRepublican party and the Democratic party, as the Administrationists\r\nand the Anti-administrationists were soon termed, took its rise\r\nlargely in the personal hostility of the leaders, is to be found in\r\nthe history of the chief question of the foreign relations with which\r\nthe Adams Administration had to deal in the years 1825 and 1826.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish-American interpretations of \"the Monroe Doctrine.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Americans had taken the cautious utterances of President\r\nMonroe, in his December message of 1823, for much more than he meant\r\nthem. They thought, or professed to think, that the Government had\r\npledged itself to meet any intervention of the Allied Powers of Europe\r\nin American affairs by any resistance necessary to defeat it. They\r\nwere also acquainted with the fact that both Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay\r\nwere more pronounced than President Monroe in favor of going to the\r\nsupport of the new republics of South and Middle America. Naturally\r\nthen, when these two men came to the head of the Government, on March\r\n4th, 1825, the Spanish Americans felt encouraged to expect some {147}\r\nsubstantial aid from the United States in the further course of their\r\nstruggle with Spain and her possible allies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Confederation of the Spanish-American states.]\r\n\r\nAlready in the summer of 1822 the Republic of Colombia had initiated\r\nthe plan of a Confederation of the Spanish-American states. By a\r\ntreaty with Peru, bearing date of July 12th, 1823, by another with\r\nChili of the same date, by another with the United Provinces of\r\nCentral America, of April 12th, 1825, and by another with Mexico, of\r\nSeptember 20th, 1825, the Republic of Colombia had established a\r\nmilitary confederation between these five states, and had pledged them\r\nto send plenipotentiaries to a \"general assembly of American states\r\n... with the charge of cementing, in the most solid and stable manner,\r\nthe intimate relations which ought to exist between all and every one\r\nof them.\" According to this agreement the assembly of\r\nplenipotentiaries was to serve as a council in conflicts, as a\r\nrallying-point in common dangers, as a faithful interpreter of\r\ntreaties between their respective states, and as an umpire and\r\nconciliator in the disputes and differences which might arise between\r\ntheir respective states.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invitation to the United States to send representatives to\r\nthe congress at Panama.]\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of the year 1825 the Ministers of Colombia and\r\nMexico sought Mr. Clay, and communicated to him the desires of their\r\nrespective governments to have the United States send representatives\r\nto this proposed congress; but before giving the formal invitation\r\nthey asked to know if it would be accepted. They stated to Mr. Clay\r\nthat they did not expect the United States to abandon the attitude of\r\nneutrality, or to take part in those deliberations of the congress\r\nwhich might relate to the prosecution of the existing war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's hesitation to accept the invitation.]\r\n\r\nClay's genial spirit was much excited by the grand prospect of a\r\nleague of the American states under the {148} hegemony of the United\r\nStates. It satisfied the plan of his daring imagination. It filled the\r\nbounds of his far-reaching vision. He immediately communicated the\r\npropositions of the two ministers, Mr. Salazar and Mr. Obregon, to\r\nPresident Adams, and urged the President to allow him to give them the\r\nassurance that the invitation to send representatives to the congress,\r\nto be held the following October at Panama, would be accepted by the\r\nUnited States. The President, however, proceeded rather cautiously. He\r\nwas, indeed, very friendly in his feelings toward the Spanish-American\r\nstates, and was ready to aid their cause in any manner consistent with\r\nthe duties of a neutral. But he had a calmer way of regarding things\r\nthan his brilliant Secretary of State, and, moreover, upon him rested\r\nthe ultimate responsibility. He required Mr. Clay to procure from\r\nMessrs. Salazar and Obregon some information in regard to the subjects\r\nwhich would be considered by the congress, the nature and form of the\r\npowers to be given to the diplomatic agents which were to compose it,\r\nand the mode of its organization and procedure. At the same time he\r\nallowed Mr. Clay to encourage them to believe that, if satisfactory\r\nanswers should be returned to these inquiries, their invitation would\r\nbe accepted. He also caused Mr. Clay to warn them that the United\r\nStates could not become a party to the existing war with Spain, or\r\ngive any counsel in regard to its further prosecution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The acceptance of the invitation.]\r\n\r\nThe answers to these inquiries were not received until the following\r\nNovember, and in Mr. Clay's letter acknowledging their receipt, they\r\nwere said to be not entirely satisfactory to the President. The\r\nministers were informed, however, that the President had resolved to\r\nsend {149} commissioners to the congress at Panama, in case the\r\nSenate, which was to assemble in a few days, should assent to it; but\r\nthat the commissioners would not be empowered to do or say anything\r\nwhich would compromise the neutrality of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President too hasty after all.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the replies from the Governments of Colombia and\r\nMexico to President Adams' questions would have been regarded as\r\nhighly unsatisfactory by any judicious mind, entirely uncommitted;\r\nfor, while they left the President's second and third questions\r\nentirely unanswered, they suggested a joint resistance of all the\r\nAmerican states to European interference in American affairs, and to\r\nany further European colonization upon the American continents, as the\r\nprincipal subjects in the discussion and determination of which the\r\nUnited States would be expected to take part. They referred to the\r\nfact that President Monroe in his noted message had characterized\r\nthese things as being matters of common interest to both North and\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition in the Senate to the sending of representatives\r\nto Panama.]\r\n\r\nHere was certainly a fine opportunity for all sorts of entanglements;\r\nand it is not at all astonishing that, when the subject was brought\r\nbefore the Senate of the United States by the President's message of\r\nDecember 26th, 1825, asking the Senate to approve his nominations of\r\nRichard C. Anderson and John Sergeant as ministers from the United\r\nStates to the \"Assembly of American Nations at Panama,\" a very strong\r\nopposition to the project was developed in that body. The Senate\r\nreferred the nominations to a committee, and called for the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence and other papers relating to the subject, which, upon\r\nexamination, revealed the facts briefly stated above.\r\n\r\nThe committee, which was the regular committee on {150} Foreign\r\nRelations, reported against the nominations, or rather against the\r\npolicy of having representatives at the congress at all, on the ground\r\nthat it might compromise the neutrality of the United States, and\r\ninvolve the United States in entangling connections with foreign\r\npowers. This report was made to the Senate on January 16th, 1826. The\r\nSenate debated, in secret session, the questions involved in the\r\nreport during the latter half of February and the first half of March.\r\nThe view held by those who favored the report was that the Panama\r\ncongress was to have the character of a military confederation, and\r\nthat membership in it would be inconsistent with a status of\r\nneutrality toward Spain and her revolting American colonies. The view\r\nof those who opposed the report and desired to send representatives to\r\nthe congress was, that the congress was only a meeting, in one place,\r\nof the plenipotentiaries of the different states for an interchange of\r\nopinions, and would not necessarily alter the attitude of any of the\r\npowers taking part in it upon any subject, or toward any other power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular sympathy in the United States for the\r\nSouth-American states.]\r\n\r\nThe strong sympathy of the people of the United States for the cause\r\nof independence in Middle and South America really violated the spirit\r\nof neutrality, and the influence of this sympathy upon the Senators\r\nand Representatives in Congress was very disturbing to a cool and\r\njudicial consideration of the attitude which the Government should\r\npreserve in the matter of the Panama mission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's nominations confirmed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No influence of slavery perceptible in the vote upon the\r\nnominations.]\r\n\r\nThe friends of the mission at last won the day by a vote of\r\ntwenty-four to nineteen. Fifteen Northern Senators voted to send\r\nrepresentatives to the congress, and seven voted against doing so.\r\nNine Southern Senators voted to send representatives, and twelve voted\r\nagainst doing so. This {151} vote hardly sustains the claim of certain\r\nof the historians, that the slavery interest was the primal cause of\r\nthe opposition to the Panama mission. One of the most eminent among\r\nthese says that the historical significance of the contest over the\r\nquestion was that slavery threw aside its municipal character, its\r\ncharacter as a Commonwealth institution, and demanded to prescribe\r\nboth the internal and external policies of the nation. This sounds\r\ndramatic, but if it means, as it appears to mean, that when, in a\r\nfederal system of government, any interest or institution regulated by\r\nCommonwealth law asks protection from the general Government against\r\nforeign influence and interference it thereby asserts command over the\r\nnation, it is a proposition which also sounds decidedly _outre_ to an\r\nAmerican lawyer. The Constitution of the United States imposed the\r\ninternational protection of all such interests and institutions upon\r\nthe general Government when it reserved such interests and\r\ninstitutions to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealths and gave the\r\ngeneral Government alone international standing. When, then, such\r\ninterests and institutions claim that protection, they are only asking\r\nfor a right guaranteed to them by the Constitution, and are by no\r\nmeans asserting an authority over the Constitution and the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Haytian question at the congress.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that Mr. Salazar said in his communication something about\r\nthe status of Hayti being a subject of deliberation for the congress.\r\nIt was also true that Hayti had been for thirty years in a state of\r\nchronic insurrection and revolution, and that the former negro slave\r\npopulation had, by the assassination of their former masters and\r\nmistresses, freed themselves from bondage, taken possession of the\r\ncountry, and were reducing it to barbarism at a rapid {152} pace. It\r\nis furthermore true that the slaveholders in the United States did not\r\nwish their own homes to be made the scenes of any such ruin and\r\nsavagery, or themselves or their families to be made subject to any\r\nsuch fate; and, it may be confidently hazarded, that no Northerner, at\r\nthat day, viewed such possibilities with anything but aversion and\r\nhorror. It required a quarter of a century of radical abolition\r\nrecklessness, the blunder-crime of secession, and the desperation of\r\nlong-continued, and at first unsuccessful, war, to make the men of the\r\nNorth regard without sympathy such dangers to their Southern brethren.\r\nThe North and the South simply could not have divided, at that time,\r\nupon the question of the relation to Hayti. There was only one view\r\nupon that subject, and that was that the example and influence of\r\nHayti must be held far away from these shores. This could have been\r\naccomplished, however, as well by attending the congress as by staying\r\naway, perhaps better. At least, the Haytian question was no chief\r\nground of opposition to the mission, and certainly no chief ground in\r\nfavor of the mission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cuba and Porto Rico.]\r\n\r\nIt is more probable that one of the reasons which moved President\r\nAdams and Mr. Clay to urge attendance upon the congress was to be in a\r\nposition to restrain the Spanish-American states from attempting to\r\nseize Cuba and Porto Rico. During the latter half of the year 1825, at\r\nthe very moment when the Government was communicating with the\r\nSpanish-American states in regard to the congress, Mr. Clay was urging\r\nthe Czar of Russia, on the one side, to exercise his influence upon\r\nthe Spanish court for the cessation of hostilities on the part of\r\nSpain against the revolting American colonies, on the ground that\r\nSpain could never resubjugate them, and would by a continuance of\r\nhostilities exasperate them and excite them to attack {153} Cuba and\r\nPorto Rico with the purpose of expelling the Spanish power from these\r\nislands, and was urging the Spanish-American states, on the other\r\nside, to refrain from such an attack, on the ground that if they did\r\nattempt to seize these islands the Czar would not only cease his good\r\noffices with the Spanish King to end the war, but might bring the\r\nentire power of the Holy Alliance to the aid of the Spanish King for\r\nthe resubjection of his former American colonies. The policy of\r\nPresident Adams' Administration was clearly opposed to the occupation\r\nof Cuba and Porto Rico, either by the Spanish Americans or by any\r\nEuropean state other than Spain herself. In this matter, also, the\r\nAdministration and the opposition held the same view.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Real nature of the opposition to the Panama mission.]\r\n\r\nThe only natural explanations of the determined opposition to the\r\nPanama mission were, thus, either the dread of embarrassing\r\nentanglements with the Spanish-American states, and the consequent\r\ncompromise of the status of neutrality toward them and their\r\nmotherland, or the spirit of personal hostility to the Administration.\r\nFrom the merits of the question the former would seem the more likely.\r\nIt was certainly, to any candid mind, a sufficient reason. On the\r\nother hand, an expression uttered by Mr. Van Buren as he left the\r\nSenate chamber, after having just made a most earnest appeal against\r\nthe mission and cast his vote against it, would indicate that the\r\nopposition fought the Administration in this matter from factional\r\nmotives purely. He is reported to have said: \"They have beaten us by a\r\nfew votes, after a hard battle; but if they had only taken the other\r\nside and refused the mission, we should have had them.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of the Panama congress.]\r\n\r\nThe debate continued so long, however, that the congress at Panama\r\nadjourned to Tacubaya before the {154} representatives from the United\r\nStates appeared. Spain ceased to wage war against her former colonies.\r\nThe Holy Alliance did not interfere. The Spanish-American states\r\nsuspended their operations against Cuba and Porto Rico. Hayti remained\r\nin isolated barbarism. And the congress of the American nations never\r\nreassembled.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the jingo policy of the Administration may have\r\nhelped to produce all these results. It is probable that the same\r\nresults would have followed had the Senate refused the mission to\r\nPanama. It is certainly most fortunate that these results were\r\nattained without the attendance of the representatives of the United\r\nStates upon the congress. All possible entanglements were thus\r\navoided, while the purposes of the Administration, in so far at least\r\nas they subserved the true interests of the country, were\r\nsubstantially accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the special commercial advantages which Clay had hoped\r\nfor were not secured, nor his dream of an American Confederacy under\r\nthe protectorate of the United States realized. Neither were the\r\nPresident's ideas in regard to methods for settling mooted questions\r\nof international relations, nor those in regard to the advancement of\r\nreligious liberty, fulfilled. But these things were all premature, to\r\nsay the least, and none of them would, probably, have been helped\r\nonward by any discussion in the congress of the American nations. With\r\nthe exception of the United States, those nations were altogether too\r\nimmature to deal with such problems; and the United States itself was\r\nnot sufficiently consolidated and powerful to assume the duties of\r\ninstructor and guardian over them. It is not probable that any\r\nopportunity for doing good or receiving good was lost by the\r\nnon-attendance of representatives {155} from the United States upon\r\nthe deliberations of the Panama congress. It is far more probable that\r\nboth the doing and the suffering of injury were escaped.\r\n\r\nWhile the question of the relation of the United States to the other\r\nstates upon the American continents is by no means transitory, the\r\nquestion of the Panama mission was so, at least so much so as not to\r\nserve well as an issue for the division of the Republican party into\r\ntwo permanently hostile forces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adams on internal improvements in his message of December\r\n6th, 1825.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Van Buren's resolution against internal improvements.]\r\n\r\nThe question of internal improvements was a better issue, from this\r\npoint of view. In his first annual message President Adams took high\r\nnational ground upon this subject. He seemed to attribute to the\r\ngeneral Government unlimited power to construct roads and canals,\r\nestablish universities and observatories, and to do any and every\r\nthing conducive to the improvement of the people. Clay himself, it is\r\nsaid, was a little staggered by the exceeding broadness of Mr. Adams'\r\nideas. While Mr. Van Buren, the leader of the opposition in the\r\nSenate, offered a resolution in that body, a fortnight after the\r\nmessage, which declared that Congress did not possess the power to\r\nmake roads and canals within the respective Commonwealths, and\r\nproposed the formation of an amendment to the Constitution, which\r\nshould prescribe the powers that the general Government should have\r\nover the subject of internal improvements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The practices of the Adams Administration in respect to\r\ninternal improvements.]\r\n\r\nMr. Adams seems to have yielded before the opposition in this matter,\r\nand to have thus avoided making it a further issue. In his subsequent\r\nmessages he confined himself chiefly to observations upon the work\r\ndone by the engineers appointed under the Congressional Act of April\r\n30th, 1824, for making surveys, plans, {156} and estimates for\r\nnational routes. The Administration and Congress simply put into\r\npractice the Monroe ideas upon the subject. Money was appropriated by\r\nCongress for the construction and repair of roads, and was expended\r\nunder the supervision of the President, and stock was taken by the\r\nGovernment in private corporations, organized under Commonwealth law,\r\nand subject to Commonwealth jurisdiction, for the construction of\r\ncanals; but no jurisdiction and no administrative powers were\r\nexercised or asserted by the general Government over such\r\nimprovements, except, perhaps, the power of eminent domain.\r\n\r\nThe opposition, however, which had been excited at first by Mr. Adams'\r\nproposition to make a large advance upon Mr. Monroe's principles, was\r\nnot satisfied with his return in practice to those principles. They\r\nprofessed to entertain the fear that the Administration had a settled\r\npolicy of encroachment upon the reserved rights and powers of the\r\nCommonwealths, and they now began to watch and combat the movements of\r\nthe Administration chiefly from this point of view. This attitude must\r\nnot yet, however, be ascribed wholly or chiefly to the conscious\r\ninfluences of the slavery interest. Factional hostility to the\r\nAdministration, and the general settling back into the \"States'\r\nrights\" view of the Constitution, which manifests itself all through\r\nthe history of the United States as a reaction from the tension of war\r\nand the enthusiasm of strong national exertion, did more to determine\r\nit than the views of the slaveholders in regard to the interests of\r\ntheir peculiar institution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The chief practical difficulty in the way of a national\r\nsystem of internal improvements.]\r\n\r\nThe great practical difficulty in regard to the subject was in making\r\nsuch determinations as to the national or local character of the\r\nproposed improvements as would be satisfactory to the mass of the\r\npeople. {157} Naturally every Congressman considered the roads of his\r\ndistrict as matters of national concern; and, in spite of the law of\r\n1824 vesting in the President and his board of engineers the laying\r\nout of such routes as the President might decide to be required by the\r\ngeneral welfare, the scramble for national money to be expended for\r\nlocal purposes increased from one session to another.\r\n\r\nIt was the question of the tariff which showed more clearly than\r\nanything else the influence of the interests of slavery in the\r\nattitude which the slaveholders would finally take toward the\r\nindustrial policies of the nation, and which would contribute more\r\nthan anything else to the division of the Republican party from the\r\npoint of view of principle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff of 1824 a failure.]\r\n\r\nThe great purpose of the Tariff of 1824 was to give the American\r\nmanufacturers of coarse woollens a substantial control of the home\r\nmarkets. In two years of trial this result had not been realized. A\r\nvast amount of capital had been transferred from other enterprises to\r\nbuild new woollen mills, and the markets were so glutted with their\r\nfabrics that sale for them could only be found by virtually excluding\r\nforeign goods of the same material and grade. It was claimed that the\r\nforeign goods were sold upon foreign account, and not by _bona fide_\r\nAmerican merchants, and that the goods were thus undervalued by the\r\nfictitious parties to the importation, and the duty thus so largely\r\navoided as to make the importation practically free. It was,\r\ntherefore, contended that the agent of the foreign manufacturer or\r\nmerchant was ruining the American manufacturer, on the one hand, and\r\nthe American merchant, on the other. President Adams himself, in his\r\nmessage of December 5th, 1826, referred to the frauds thus committed\r\non the revenue. The {158} manufacturers of woollens in New England and\r\nPennsylvania memorialized Congress, during the latter part of the year\r\n1826, representing themselves to be in dire distress and praying for\r\naid. These memorials were referred to the Committee on Manufactures of\r\nthe House of Representatives for report. On January 10th, 1827, the\r\nchairman of this committee, Mr. Mallary, of Vermont, introduced a bill\r\nto meet the difficulties above described.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff Bill of 1827.]\r\n\r\nThis bill proposed to introduce a system of minimal valuations at the\r\ncustom-house instead of taking the foreign invoice as the basis for\r\nthe levy of the duty, as was the existing practice, and it placed the\r\nvaluation of coarse woollens so high as practically to prohibit their\r\nimportation. The bill proposed, however, to raise the tariff on wool\r\nto such a rate as would deprive the manufacturers very largely of the\r\nbenefit to be secured by the system of minimal valuations. It was\r\nquestionable whether the manufacturers would get any very material aid\r\nout of this bill, which contained so high a rate of duty upon the raw\r\nmaterial, but it was necessary to incorporate the provision in order\r\nto secure the support of the West to the measure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of the industrial antithesis between the North\r\nand the South.]\r\n\r\nThe industrial antithesis between the North and the South became more\r\nexactly organized under the issue presented by this bill.\r\nMassachusetts joined the high protection ranks, and Kentucky went over\r\nto the side of the South. Missouri, however, still voted for the\r\ntariff, while New York City still preserved its attitude of\r\nopposition, and Maine's Representatives were evenly divided in the\r\nfinal vote on the bill. The protection phalanx from Pennsylvania was\r\nbroken, too, by the defection of her two most important\r\nRepresentatives, Ingham and Buchanan. The attitude of {159} Buchanan\r\nwas a matter of especial note. He held that the constitutionality of\r\nthe tariff and the policy of a moderate protection had been completely\r\nsettled by the founders of the Constitution and by the uniform\r\npractice of the Government, but that so high a tariff as the one now\r\nproposed on woollens was impolitic, from the point of view of the\r\ngeneral welfare, and unjust, from that of an equal distribution of the\r\nburdens of taxation. Mr. Buchanan owed much of his subsequent success\r\nto the moderate views which he advanced and adhered to at this\r\njuncture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill passed by the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, however, that the support of, and the opposition to,\r\nthe tariff respectively had not yet become entirely sectional, though\r\nan advance had been made since 1824 toward that result. The bill\r\npassed the House on February 10th, 1827, but the Senate did not reach\r\nits consideration before the conclusion of the session.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hostility to the measure in South Carolina.]\r\n\r\nIt had the effect, however, of arousing most intense excitement and\r\nbitter opposition in South Carolina. In fact, it is from this date and\r\nissue that we must trace the history of nullification in South\r\nCarolina. In the summer following the Congressional session of 1826-27\r\nthe chief personages of the Commonwealth assembled at Columbia. The\r\nGovernor, Mr. Taylor, presided, and the principal orator of the\r\noccasion was the President of the College of the Commonwealth, Dr.\r\nCooper, a man of rare powers and great learning, an Englishman by\r\nbirth and education, a free-trader in his political economy, and a\r\n\"States' rights\" man in his political science. In his speech he\r\nsuggested disunion as preferable to submission to the tariff\r\nlegislation of Congress. The resolutions passed by the assembly were\r\nnot so inflammatory as the Doctor's speech, but they declared that\r\nsuch legislation {160} was calculated to give rise to the inquiry\r\nwhether the Union was of any benefit, under such conditions, to the\r\nSouthern Commonwealths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill neglected by the Senate.]\r\n\r\nCopies of these resolutions were sent to the legislative bodies of the\r\nseveral Southern Commonwealths, but they evoked no response\r\nwhatsoever. The proposed tariff had, by the inaction of the Senate,\r\nbeen virtually abandoned, and it was therefore unnecessary to protest\r\nagainst its passage as law, or make threats against its execution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff of 1828.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the next session of Congress, that of 1827-28, the\r\ncommittee on Manufactures brought in another bill. It advanced the\r\nduty on iron by from ten to fifteen per centum; it advanced the duty\r\non wool by from about fifty to more than one hundred per centum,\r\nimposing both a specific and an _ad valorem_ duty upon it. It changed\r\nthe duty upon woollen goods costing less than $2.50 a square yard from\r\nan _ad valorem_ to a specific duty, and increased the duty by about\r\ntwenty per centum. It retained the _ad valorem_ duty on woollens\r\ncosting more than $2.50 a square yard, and increased the same by about\r\ntwenty per centum, and in addition thereto it imposed a minimum\r\nvaluation of $4 a square yard upon all such goods costing between\r\n$2.50 and $4 a square yard, which would effect an additional increase\r\nof duty of about fifty per centum on the average. It finally increased\r\nthe duty on hemp by about twenty-five per centum immediately, and by\r\nabout eighty per centum in three years.\r\n\r\nThis was a far more moderate protection upon woollen fabrics than that\r\nproposed at the previous session, on account of the fact that the duty\r\non the raw material was so greatly increased. It was at least\r\nquestionable whether the manufacturers would receive any substantial\r\nbenefit out of the measure. Mr. Mallary, the {161} chairman of the\r\ncommittee, felt so dubious about this that he dissented from the\r\ncommittee's report in regard to woollen fabrics, and offered an\r\namendment to the bill for the purpose of curing this defect. He could\r\nnot, however, bring the House to accept his proposition, but his\r\nopposition to the committee's report opened the way for some\r\nmodification of the bill to the advantage of the manufacturers. It was\r\nstill, however, no great boon to the manufacturers. It was about as\r\nmuch a wool- and hemp-grower's bill as a manufacturer's bill. Nobody\r\ncould tell whether it would be more beneficial to the manufacturers\r\nthan to the wool- and hemp-growers.\r\n\r\nOne thing alone was certain, and that was, that the cotton-planters\r\nand those engaged in foreign commerce would have no direct share in\r\nthe benefits of the measure. And it was also very difficult to figure\r\nout any indirect benefits for them. It would not widen the domestic\r\nmarket for raw cotton. It would increase the price of woollen fabrics.\r\nIt would increase the domestic demand for the products of Western\r\nagriculture, and thereby increase the price of these products to the\r\nSouthern consumers of them. And it would discourage the importation of\r\nwoollen goods. These were all the results easily discernible, and\r\nevery one of them bore hard upon the planting and shipping interests.\r\nThe representatives from the Southern Commonwealths pointed out these\r\nthings, but they were told to establish manufactures themselves, and\r\nthen they would be tributary to nobody.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Southerners not yet agreed that slave labor could not\r\nbe employed in manufacture.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Southerners, like Colonel Hayne, frankly replied that they\r\ncould not establish manufactures with slave labor; while others, like\r\nMr. McDuffie, threatened ruin to the Northern manufacturers if they\r\nsucceeded in having the duties raised so high as to drive the South,\r\nwith its cheap slave labor, into manufactures.\r\n\r\n{162} [Sidenote: The character of the bill as reflected in the\r\nanalysis of the vote upon it.]\r\n\r\nThe vote in the House of Representatives reflects quite perfectly the\r\ncharacter of the bill. The members from the wool- and hemp-growing\r\nsections supported the bill; those from the manufacturing section were\r\nindifferent; those from the shipping and commercial sections opposed\r\nit; and those from the planting section opposed it unanimously.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, amendments were made to the bill which altered it in\r\nthe direction of a slightly increased protection to the manufacturers.\r\nStill, Mr. Webster, who had become a champion of protection since his\r\nsection had become a manufacturing section, claimed that the bill was\r\nof little worth to the manufacturers, while the increased duty on hemp\r\nwould bear heavily on the shipping interests of New England. He voted\r\nfor the bill, however, while his colleague, Mr. Silsbee, voted against\r\nit. The vote in the Senate differed only slightly, as regards\r\nsectional distribution, from that in the House. It was finally passed\r\nby both Houses as amended by the Senate, and was signed by the\r\nPresident on the nineteenth day of May, 1828; and opposition to it\r\nthereafter must take on the form of petition for its repeal, or that\r\nof resistance to its execution. Before it could come to the latter,\r\nhowever, three things must be accomplished. The first was the\r\ninvention of the morale of such resistance. The second was the\r\ncreation of the party of resistance. And the last was the capture of\r\nsome existing governmental organization by that party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff of 1828 not a complete party measure.]\r\n\r\nWhile thus it cannot be said that the \"Jackson men\" voted against this\r\nbill and the Administration men for it, still there was something\r\nwhich looked like an approach toward this relation. Certainly the\r\nSouthern wing of the Jacksonians, or of the Democratic party, as the\r\nJacksonians now called {163} themselves in distinction from the\r\nNational Republicans, opposed the measure with something like\r\nunanimity. Many of Jackson's Northern supporters, however, voted for\r\nthe bill, and it may be said that the Democratic party of the North\r\nwas then in favor of moderate protection to all the interests of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe party divisions of 1828 were still largely dominated by\r\nconsiderations of personal partisanship, and the organization of the\r\ntwo parties, which had now emerged from the all-comprehending\r\nRepublican party, upon the basis of different political creeds, still\r\nlacked much of completion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The presidential campaign of 1828 still dominated by\r\npersonal considerations.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1828 was not fought upon the issues of any well\r\nestablished differences in political and economic policies. Jackson\r\nand his followers simply appealed to the mass of the people,\r\nespecially to the lower classes, \"to turn the rascals out,\" on the\r\nground that the \"Old Hero,\" the friend of the people, had been\r\ncheated, by a corrupt bargain between the two chiefs of the\r\nAdministration, out of his rights in 1824, and that the whole pack of\r\nofficials serving under them had been corrupted by the venality of\r\ntheir superiors. The people must take possession of their Government\r\nand send the wicked aristocracy of office holders to the right about,\r\nwas the chief demand of the Democracy of 1828, and it was with the\r\nempty phrases, with which they rang the changes upon this demand, that\r\nthey won the battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election of Jackson.]\r\n\r\nJackson and Calhoun were elected by an electoral vote of more than two\r\nto one. Every Commonwealth west of the Alleghanies, and every one\r\nsouth of Mason and Dixon's line, except Delaware and Maryland, gave\r\nits electoral vote entire to Jackson and Calhoun; and in addition\r\nthereto Pennsylvania {164} gave them its entire vote, New York gave\r\nthem twenty of its thirty-six votes, Maine one of its nine, and\r\nMaryland five of its eleven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advent of the parvenus.]\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous _bouleversement_. The mob of malcontents had\r\ngotten together, had pulled together, and had accomplished their\r\npurpose. The old ruling class in American society was driven from\r\nplace and power, and a new, untried, and inexperienced set of men\r\nseized the reins of Government. It looked something like a combination\r\nof the South and West against the East. They had, however, secured the\r\ntwo most important Eastern Commonwealths through Van Buren's activity\r\nin New York and Jackson's own popularity in Pennsylvania. It was not\r\nyet, however, a socialistic uprising against the wealth of the East.\r\nIt was a political uprising against the monopoly of office-holding by\r\nthe old official aristocracy. It was the introduction of a new class\r\nof eligibles into the official positions. Whether the subsequent\r\neffects of this change would be a modification of the structure of the\r\nUnion or the policies of the Government remained to be seen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign affairs under Jackson's Administration.]\r\n\r\nJackson placed Van Buren at the head of the Department of State, and\r\nunder the influence of this most astute politician started out upon\r\nhis presidential career. The foreign diplomacy of the Administration\r\nwas naturally successful. The disputes with Great Britain in regard to\r\nthe northeast boundary of the United States, and in regard to trade\r\nbetween the United States and the British colonies, and the dispute\r\nwith France in regard to indemnity for the spoliations committed by\r\nthe French upon American commerce in the first years of the century,\r\nwere successfully dealt with, by a judicious admixture of shrewdness,\r\nconciliatoriness, and firmness. These questions were not, however, of\r\nsufficient importance to {165} turn the attention from the internal\r\nquestions of constitutional interpretation and governmental policies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Democratic party and its divisions.]\r\n\r\nThe Jackson party, or the Democratic party, must make its creed, both\r\npolitical and economic, and it must adjust that creed both to the\r\nConstitution and to the working of the Government. The party was\r\ncomposed of three tolerably distinct divisions, which may be termed\r\nthe Southern, the Western, and the Eastern divisions. Of these, the\r\nWestern division alone was a real democracy. The Southern and Eastern\r\ndivisions were rather aristocracies. The Southern division was\r\nemphatically so. And when it came to policies, the Western division\r\nfavored internal improvements, and the Eastern and Southern divisions\r\nopposed them; the Western division favored a tariff on wool and hemp,\r\nthe Eastern favored moderate protection of manufactures, and the\r\nSouthern division wanted as nearly free trade as the revenues of the\r\nGovernment would allow. It was a great task for the Administration to\r\nmaintain the combination, and keep a reliable majority in Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{166}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION TO INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS AND PROTECTION\r\n\r\nJackson's Ideas Concerning Internal Improvements--The Maysville Road\r\nBill--The Slavery Question not Involved in the Vote on the Bill or in\r\nthe Veto--Railway Building Begun--The Commencement of the Struggle for\r\nthe Repeal of the Tariff of 1828--Jackson on the Tariff of 1828, in\r\nhis First Annual Message--George McDuffie as South Carolina's\r\nPolitical Economist--Dr. Thomas Cooper--Mr. McDuffie's Tariff\r\nBill--The Tariff Bill of 1830--McDuffie's Amendment--McDuffie's\r\nDoctrine that the Producers of Exports Pay Finally the Duties on the\r\nImports--The Acceptance of Mr. McDuffie's Doctrine at the\r\nSouth--Growing Belief in the Incapacity of Slave Labor for\r\nManufacture--The Tariff Pronounced Unconstitutional--Growth of the\r\nProtection Idea--Jackson on the Tariff and the Surplus Revenue Derived\r\ntherefrom, in the Message of December, 1830--Southern\r\nDisappointment--\"The South Carolina Exposition\"--Calhoun's Doctrine of\r\n\"States' rights\"--Nullification in Theory--The Nullification and\r\nAnti-nullification Parties in South Carolina--First Attempt to try the\r\nValidity of the Tariff in the United States Courts--Nullification and\r\nRebellion--Jackson's Message of December, 1831, on the Tariff\r\nIssue--The Bill from the Committee on Ways and Means--The Tariff Bill\r\nof 1832 from the Committee on Manufactures--Passage of the Tariff of\r\n1832 by the House of Representatives--The \"American System.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's ideas concerning internal improvements.]\r\n\r\nIn his first annual message President Jackson referred to the general\r\ndissatisfaction with the manner of {167} dealing with the question of\r\ninternal improvements which had prevailed to that time, and proposed\r\nthat the general Government should abandon the subject entirely and\r\nshould distribute the surplus of the revenue, above the wants of the\r\nGovernment, among the Commonwealths, and leave to them the expenditure\r\nof the money upon internal improvements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Maysville Road Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe Congress, however, paid no regard to the President's\r\nrecommendation. In May, 1830, it sent up to the President for his\r\napproval a bill authorizing and requiring the Government to take stock\r\nin a Kentucky turnpike, running from Maysville on the Ohio River to\r\nLexington, some sixty miles inward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto of the Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe President vetoed the bill, May 27th. His special reason was that\r\nthe road was not a national, but a local, matter. He did not attack\r\nthe Monroe principle upon the general subject of internal\r\nimprovements, but he referred to the recommendation contained in his\r\nannual message as still expressing his view of the manner in which the\r\nGovernment should rid itself of the embarrassments into which it was\r\nbeing farther and farther drawn by the practice of voting national\r\nmoney for internal improvements. He argued that the subject must be\r\nconsidered upon its own merits, and not brought into connection with\r\nthe tariff policy. He thus saw the prospect of the expenditure of\r\nmillions of national money upon internal improvements in order to\r\nrelieve the protectionists of the embarrassment of a great surplus,\r\nand denounced it. He contended that the Government should adopt its\r\npolicy upon each of these subjects as if the other did not exist. He\r\nurged, finally, that, if the people wanted the general Government to\r\nundertake internal improvements, they should {168} so amend the\r\nConstitution as to give the Government sufficient jurisdiction over\r\nthe roads and canals, which it might build, to protect them against\r\nwanton injury, and to collect the tolls necessary to keep them in\r\nrepair. This he declared to be necessary to any satisfactory exercise\r\nof powers upon the general subject by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe veto certainly exerted some influence upon the minds of the\r\nRepresentatives. A majority still voted for the bill, but it was a\r\nmuch reduced majority. The vote upon the vetoed bill stood ninety-six\r\nto ninety. The bill was therefore lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The slavery question not involved in the vote on the bill\r\nor in the veto.]\r\n\r\nThe exact question at issue was not, as we have seen, the general\r\npolicy of internal improvements, but it was whether the Maysville road\r\nwas a national improvement. An analysis of the vote upon the subject\r\nmay not, therefore, have any significance, from the point of view of\r\nthe general question. Roughly, we may say that a majority of the\r\nRepresentatives from the South voted against the bill, a large\r\nmajority of those from the Northwest voted for it, a majority of those\r\nfrom Pennsylvania and New Jersey voted for it, while a majority of\r\nthose from New York voted against it, and, lastly, the Representatives\r\nfrom New England were divided. It thus appears rather far fetched to\r\nascribe the attitude of the opponents of the bill, in any section, to\r\nthe influence of the slavery interest. Those who voted against the\r\nbill said they did so because the object for which the appropriation\r\nwas sought was a local affair, managed by a private corporation, for\r\nprivate gain. That uncompromising enemy of slavery, Mr. John W.\r\nTaylor, of New York, was prominent among those who took this position\r\nand voted against the bill. He even pronounced it unconstitutional,\r\nand was inclined to the {169} view, as we have seen, that internal\r\nimprovements generally were left by the Constitution for the\r\nCommonwealths to construct and control.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Too much influence in determining the national policy\r\ntoward internal improvements usually ascribed to the veto.]\r\n\r\nIt is usual to attribute to the veto of this bill the overthrow of the\r\npolicy of internal improvements by the general Government. This\r\nproposition will hardly bear close examination. Congress continued to\r\nmake appropriations for internal improvements, which the President\r\nusually vetoed, if they were in separate bills, and usually approved,\r\nif they were included in the general appropriation bills. It is\r\ncalculated that while Adams signed appropriations for internal\r\nimprovements to the amount of less than two millions and a half of\r\ndollars, Jackson approved disbursements for these purposes to the\r\namount of more than ten millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Railway building begun.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the building of railways was the chief force which\r\nput an end to road- and canal-making by the general Government. The\r\nconstruction of the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, the parent of the New\r\nYork Central system, was begun in 1825. In 1827 the survey of the\r\nBoston and Albany line was begun. The same year the Pennsylvania\r\nsystem had its origin. One year later the Baltimore and Ohio system\r\nwas founded. The year of the veto of the Maysville road bill forty-one\r\nmiles of railroad were being operated in the United States, and at the\r\nclose of the decade more than two thousand miles. As the railway\r\nsystem spread over the country, through private enterprise, the\r\nappropriations of national money for internal improvements became more\r\nand more confined to the specific improvements of rivers and harbors.\r\nThe roads and canals of a national character were being made\r\nunnecessary by the extension of {170} the railways. It is undoubtedly,\r\nthen, far more plausible and natural to attribute the overthrow of the\r\npolicy of internal improvements by the general Government to the\r\ngrowth of the railways, constructed and operated by private\r\ncorporations under Commonwealth charters, on the one side, and, on the\r\nother, to the settled conviction that the general Government did not\r\nhave the constitutional powers adequate to the successful\r\nestablishment and protection of a system of works based upon that\r\npolicy, and to the unsatisfactory experience which the country had had\r\nin attempting to distinguish local from national enterprises and to\r\nconfine appropriations to those of the latter character.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see any special connection of the interests of\r\nslavery with the decline of the policy. It is true that the\r\nslaveholders were becoming strict constructionists generally. They had\r\nlearned from the Missouri struggle that Congress must not be allowed\r\nto magnify its powers when forming the Territories into Commonwealths,\r\nand they had learned from the tariff struggles that Congress must not\r\nbe allowed to magnify its powers in regard to the regulation of\r\nforeign commerce and the raising of revenue, but, as to internal\r\nimprovements, no reliable evidence of a consciousness, on the part of\r\nthe slaveholders, of any particular connection between their peculiar\r\ninterest and a policy upon this subject by the general Government is\r\ndiscoverable.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, in the struggle for the repeal of the Tariff of 1828\r\nthe influence of the slavery interest is easily remarked, and is\r\nclearly seen to have been controlling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The commencement of the struggle for the repeal of the\r\nTariff of 1828.]\r\n\r\nOn February 10th, 1829, Mr. William Smith, the senior Senator from\r\nSouth Carolina, presented to the Senate the protest of the legislature\r\nof South {171} Carolina against Congressional protection to domestic\r\nmanufactures. This memorial pronounced all such acts to be\r\nunconstitutional, except as incidental to raising the revenue or\r\nregulating commerce, and impolitic even then, when their operation\r\nwould be unequal upon the different sections of the country, and felt\r\nby any section to be oppressive. The language of the paper was\r\nrespectful, moderate, dignified, and forcible, and it contained no\r\nthreats of disunion, or of violent or unlawful resistance. The\r\nlegislature asked that the protest should be entered on the journal of\r\nthe Senate. The Senate, however, only ordered it to be printed.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolinians promised themselves, nevertheless, some measure\r\nof relief from what they supposed would be the policy of the newly\r\nelected President. Being a Southern man, it was naturally supposed\r\nthat he would recognize Southern interests in the policy upon this\r\nsubject which he would recommend. But, while Jackson had not committed\r\nhimself to protection for the sake of the manufacturers or of the\r\nproducers of raw material, he was a strong Union man and an American,\r\nand the argument for the tariff from the point of view of national\r\nindustrial independence exercised a prevailing influence in\r\ndetermining his attitude toward the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson on the Tariff of 1828, in his first annual\r\nmessage.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's views on the Tariff as a general policy.]\r\n\r\nIn his message of December 8th, 1829, he wrote that the Tariff of 1828\r\nhad not proved itself so beneficial to the manufacturers or so\r\ninjurious to commerce and agriculture as had been anticipated; that he\r\nregretted that all nations would not abolish restrictions, and refer\r\nthe management of trade to individual enterprise; that since, however,\r\nthey would not do so, a tariff was the necessary policy of the United\r\nStates; but that in the {172} face of the fact that the national debt\r\nwould soon be paid, and the sinking fund would not be much longer\r\nrequired, a modification of the existing tariff in the direction of a\r\nreduction of duties would soon be the true and necessary policy; and\r\nthat the principle to be followed in making such a modification ought\r\nto be to reduce the duties upon such articles as might come into\r\ncompetition with home products no further than would leave to the\r\nlatter a fair chance in such competition; and that from the general\r\nprinciple of a reduction to this point must be excepted the duties on\r\nthe implements and prime necessities of war, all of which should enjoy\r\na higher protection than that accorded to other articles. Evidently,\r\naccording to this doctrine, the chief reductions should fall upon\r\narticles not coming into competition with home products, such articles\r\nas tea, coffee, etc., at that time termed the unprotected articles.\r\nJackson had thus anticipated Clay's American system of the tariff by\r\nnearly three years, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolinians were greatly disappointed by this expression of\r\nthe President's views, although they claimed that the message\r\nrecommended substantial tariff reduction. This part of the message was\r\nreferred to the committee on Manufactures, according to the rule of\r\nprocedure which had prevailed in the House of Representatives for\r\nnearly a decade, and which showed that the matter of the tariff was\r\nnot regarded as something purely incidental to the raising of revenue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: George McDuffie as South Carolina's political economist.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Thomas Cooper.]\r\n\r\nThe claim was now put forward, however, that the subject properly\r\nbelonged to the domain of the committee on Ways and Means. Mr. George\r\nMcDuffie, of South Carolina, was at this moment the chairman of this\r\ncommittee. He was a man of keen intelligence, strong {173} courage,\r\nand great persistence. He was the political economist of the\r\nslave-labor system, as Calhoun was its political scientist and\r\nconstitutional lawyer. It is to be surmised, at least, that he learned\r\nmuch of his political economy from the notorious, if not famous, Dr.\r\nThomas Cooper, the British President of South Carolina College. It is\r\ntrue that Mr. McDuffie's college days had passed before Dr. Cooper\r\ntaught in the institution, but the Doctor wrote and published much\r\nupon economic and political subjects between 1820 and 1830. In fact,\r\nhe set the direction of thought upon such subjects in South Carolina\r\nand throughout a large portion of the South during that period. As has\r\nbeen already mentioned, he was an Englishman by birth. He had spent a\r\npart of his earlier life in France, and had imbibed the doctrines of\r\nFrench republicanism. For this reason he was disliked and shunned by\r\nconservative men in England to such a degree as to make longer\r\nresidence in his native country uncomfortable to him. He came to the\r\nUnited States in the last decade of the eighteenth century. His\r\nradical views and his violent expressions of them soon drew attention\r\nto him here. He was one of the men prosecuted under the Alien and\r\nSedition laws of 1798. He made his way to South Carolina about the\r\nbeginning of the third decade of this century, and found there a well\r\nprepared soil for his Girondist views of federal Government and his\r\nfree-trade views in political economy. A true estimate of\r\nresponsibilities for the events of 1832 in South Carolina would\r\nprobably hold him more culpable than Calhoun himself. It was from such\r\na thinker, and he was a keen and vigorous thinker, that Mr. McDuffie\r\nreceived impulse, if not actual instruction, in his reasoning.\r\n\r\nMr. McDuffie argued that the power to impose a tariff {174} was not\r\nexpressly vested by the Constitution in the Government; that,\r\ntherefore, if it existed at all, as a power of the Government, it must\r\nbe incidental to some express provision; and that it could be\r\nincidental only to the power for raising the revenue. He, therefore,\r\ncontended further that all tariff bills must originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and in the regular revenue committee of that House,\r\nthe committee of Ways and Means.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. McDuffie's Tariff Bill.]\r\n\r\nCongress had disregarded the protest of the South Carolina Legislature\r\nof the previous February. It was well known that the committee on\r\nManufactures in the House was favorable to the maintenance of the\r\nexisting duties. It seemed, therefore, to Mr. McDuffie, and those who\r\nthought with him, both natural and necessary that the committee of\r\nWays and Means should claim their constitutional prerogative, and make\r\nan effort to get the ear of Congress to their representations.\r\nConsequently, on February 5th, 1830, Mr. McDuffie reported a tariff\r\nbill from his committee, without having had the subject specifically\r\nreferred to them by the House. The bill provided for a moderate\r\nreduction of the tariff all around, but still left a duty of\r\nthirty-three and one-third per centum _ad valorem_ upon woollen\r\nfabrics.\r\n\r\nThe interest attaching to this proposition lies in the fact that it\r\ncontains substantially the terms upon which the South Carolinians were\r\nwilling to compromise the tariff question. It shows them to have been\r\nstill moderate tariff men, rather than out and out free-traders. To\r\nthe unprejudiced mind of the present day it certainly appears to have\r\nbeen an offer which merited some consideration, but, after a single\r\nreading, it was ordered to lie on the table, from which it was never\r\ntaken up.\r\n\r\n{175} [Sidenote: The Tariff Bill of 1830.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the committee on Manufactures were very deliberately\r\nmaturing a measure. It was reported to the House early in April, and\r\ntaken up for consideration on the 15th. It was nothing more than an\r\nadministrative measure for the purpose of securing a stricter\r\nexecution of the existing tariff.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McDuffie's Amendment.]\r\n\r\nMr. McDuffie made another effort to move the House to consider a\r\nreduction of duties, in the form of an amendment to this bill. He\r\noffered such an amendment, which provided for a return to the duties\r\nimposed before 1824 upon woollens, cottons, iron, hemp, etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McDuffie's doctrine that the producers of exports pay\r\nfinally the duties on the imports.]\r\n\r\nIt was in support of this amendment that he made his famous argument\r\nof April 29th, 1830, in which he developed, for the first time, the\r\ndoctrine in regard to the final payment of the duties which furnished\r\nthe economic basis of nullification. That doctrine was that the\r\nproducers of the exports, which are exchanged in the foreign markets\r\nfor the imports, pay, finally, the duty upon the imports. His course\r\nof reasoning in the establishment of this doctrine was as follows: He\r\nreduced all trade ultimately to barter between producers, and then\r\ndeclared it to be self-evident that when a producer of exports should\r\nbe obliged to pay a duty of twenty-five per centum upon the imports,\r\nwhich he had received in pay for his exports, before he could bring\r\nthem into the country of his residence, he had received finally\r\ntwenty-five per centum less for his exports than he would have\r\nreceived had he not been compelled to pay any duty upon his imports.\r\n\r\nMr. McDuffie then drew from the statistics of the foreign trade of the\r\nUnited States the fact that the sections cultivating cotton and rice,\r\nconstituting less than {176} one-fifth of the Union, both in territory\r\nand population, produced thirty of the fifty-eight millions' worth of\r\nannual exports; and finally drew the conclusion from these premises\r\nthat one-fifth of the people, the population of the planting sections,\r\npaid more than one-half of the duties on the imports of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The danger in Mr. McDuffie's conclusions.]\r\n\r\nIf this were true it was indeed a grievous burden. And if the people\r\nof the South, or that part of the South devoted to the production of\r\nthese staples, believed it to be true, then would the reason for one\r\ngreat scruple against resistance to the execution of the tariff laws\r\nbe removed, namely, the general belief theretofore prevailing, from\r\nthe doctrine that the consumers of the imports ultimately pay the\r\nduties, that the burden of the duties fell nearly equally upon the\r\ndifferent sections. So long as this belief was general the sense of\r\noppression in any particular part or section of the country could not\r\nbecome very keen. Substitute for this old idea, however, the new\r\ndoctrine advanced by Mr. McDuffie, and, under the existing\r\ndistribution of the articles of export, there could not fail to be\r\ndeveloped a most bitter sense of wrong and oppression on the part of\r\nthe producers of the Southern staples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The acceptance of Mr. McDuffie's doctrine at the South.]\r\n\r\nThe Southerners, especially the South Carolinians, did embrace the new\r\ndoctrine, apparently, at least, with all sincerity. It was utterly\r\nfutile that Mr. Gorham and Mr. Everett pointed out to them the fact\r\nthat they consumed only a comparatively small portion of the imports\r\nreceived in exchange for their exports, and sold the rest to the\r\npeople of the other sections with the duties added on, thus shifting\r\nthe duties upon the other sections. They clung to the new doctrine as\r\nif it were something for which they had long been seeking, and to\r\nwhich their {177} hearts were already too much attached to be drawn\r\naway by argument.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growing belief in the incapacity of slave labor for\r\nmanufacture.]\r\n\r\nIt was in this speech, furthermore, that Mr. McDuffie abandoned his\r\nformer view of the capacity of slave labor for manufacturing industry,\r\nand embraced and enounced the doctrine held before this by Colonel\r\nHayne upon that subject, which was that slave labor could only be\r\nemployed successfully in agriculture. This was, of course, another\r\nnecessary element in the consolidation of the interests of the South\r\nagainst the tariff.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff pronounced unconstitutional.]\r\n\r\nIt was in this speech, also, that Mr. McDuffie, for the first time,\r\npronounced the tariff unconstitutional. He did not yet declare any and\r\nevery tariff unconstitutional, but only such a tariff as sacrificed\r\none interest to another, or the interests of one section to those of\r\nanother. This he claimed the existing tariff did do. The belief in the\r\nunconstitutionality of the tariff was, of course, another necessary\r\nelement in the preparation for resistance to its execution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McDuffie's threat of resistance to the execution of the\r\nTariff laws.]\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. McDuffie uttered, in this speech, the threat of\r\nresistance to the execution of the tariff laws, the threat of\r\nnullification. It was ill timed, as threats generally are, and it had\r\nthe effect of producing the large majority by which Mr. McDuffie's\r\namendment was voted down.\r\n\r\nThe bill suffered some modification in the course of its passage, but\r\nits principle remained the same. It reduced the duty on no article\r\nwhatever, but only provided for a stricter enforcement of the existing\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of the protection idea.]\r\n\r\nBy another bill, which received the President's approval on May 20th\r\n(1830), eight days before this administrative bill was signed, the\r\nduties on tea, coffee, and cocoa had been reduced. This meant that the\r\nprotectionists were very {178} willing to free those articles from\r\nduty which did not come into competition with home productions, in\r\norder to preserve and increase the duties on those that did. This was\r\nthe direction in which the tariff system was growing. It became, two\r\nyears later, the pronounced principle of the \"American system,\" as we\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson on the Tariff and the surplus revenue derived\r\ntherefrom, in the message of December, 1830.]\r\n\r\nIn the message of December 7th, 1830, President Jackson defended the\r\nconstitutionality of the protective system, said that the existing\r\ntariff needed some corrections in details, and expressed the opinion\r\nthat no law reducing duties could be made which would be satisfactory\r\nto the American people that would not leave a considerable surplus in\r\nthe Treasury. He suggested the employment of such surplus upon\r\ninternal improvements under the direction of the legislatures of the\r\nseveral Commonwealths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern disappointment.]\r\n\r\nThis was a stunning blow to the hopes of the Southerners. The\r\nextinction of the debt and the existence of an unemployed surplus were\r\nthe conditions to which they had looked forward as necessitating in\r\nall conservative minds the reduction of the duties. But here was a\r\nplan, suggested by a Southern President, for relieving the Treasury of\r\nany amount of surplus for an indefinite period, without the reduction\r\nof a single penny of duty upon a single article. Thus encouraged the\r\nprotectionists in both Houses of Congress refused, during the session\r\nof 1830-31, to consider any propositions looking toward a reduction of\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly a cause of wonder that the South Carolinians began to\r\ndespair of obtaining through Congress any relief from what they\r\nregarded as dire oppression, and that some of them were reviewing the\r\nConstitution, and the political principles upon which it was founded,\r\nwith {179} the purpose of finding other means with which to meet the\r\ngreat emergency. It was in this part of the work that Mr. Calhoun took\r\nthe lead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The South Carolina Exposition.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calhoun's doctrine of \"States' rights.\"]\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1828, just after the enactment of the tariff measure\r\nwhich was giving so much offence, Mr. Calhoun had started out in this\r\ndirection in the paper which he furnished the South Carolina\r\nlegislature, which served as the basis of the first pronunciamento\r\nfrom that body upon the subject, the so-called South Carolina\r\nExposition. This document by Mr. Calhoun was comparatively temperate\r\nin its language and not very clear in its political doctrines and its\r\nconstitutional interpretation. The great debate between Hayne and\r\nWebster on the floor of the Senate, over which body Mr. Calhoun, as\r\nVice-President, presided, in regard to the fundamental principles of\r\nthe Union, taught Mr. Calhoun several very important points in the\r\nevolution of his doctrine of \"States' rights.\" Especially was he\r\nwarned against the great error, made by Mr. Hayne, of representing the\r\nUnited States Government as one of the parties to the \"constitutional\r\npact\" and the \"States\" as the other. Mr. Webster so completely\r\ndemolished this theory that Mr. Calhoun was preserved from introducing\r\nthis fallacy or any of its corollaries into his reasoning, if he had\r\never been inclined to do so. In his \"Address on the Relations of the\r\nStates and Federal Government,\" and in his \"Address to the People of\r\nSouth Carolina,\" both published in the summer of 1831, he shows that\r\nhe had maturely reflected upon all that had been said and written upon\r\nthe fundamental question of the relation of the \"States\" to the Union\r\nand to the general Government. He had given up his hope both in the\r\nCongress and in the President. With him the question of the tariff had\r\nnow, {180} therefore, been removed from the domain of governmental\r\npolicy into that of constitutional powers and political principle.\r\nThis was the point of view which he took in the documents just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nHe began, as innovators generally do, with the assertion that his\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution was no new invention of his own,\r\nbut was the ancient principle of the Constitution. That principle was,\r\nhe contended, that the Constitution was made by the \"States,\" as\r\nsovereign bodies, and that through it the \"States\" created only a\r\ngovernmental agent for their general affairs. The term or phrase\r\nUnited States was only the name of the general governmental agent of\r\nthe \"States.\" Sovereignty was in the \"States\" only. Consequently, when\r\nthe United States assumed powers not conferred by the \"States\" in the\r\nConstitution, the \"States,\" by virtue of the sovereign attribute,\r\nmight and should interpose, interpose individually, not collectively\r\nas they, of course, might do constitutionally through the regular form\r\nof procedure for amending the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nullification in theory.]\r\n\r\nCalhoun, like every other real statesman of his day, held that there\r\nis a domain of liberty secured not only to the minority, but to the\r\nindividual, by the Constitution, upon which the majority shall not\r\nencroach. The practical question was how to prevent the majority, in\r\npossession of the powers and machinery of the Government, from doing\r\nso. The answer to this question developed by precedent, and formulated\r\nclearly by Webster at that very moment, was that it could be done only\r\nby invoking the aid of the judicial power of the United States. But\r\nCalhoun said in reply to this, that the United States courts were a\r\npart of the Government, substantially under the control of Congress\r\nand the President, through the power of Congress to constitute\r\njudgeships at pleasure, and of the President and the {181} Senate to\r\nfill them, and that they were interested, therefore, in the\r\nusurpations of power by the Government. He further held that these\r\ncourts could not decide political questions, although these questions\r\nmight incidentally involve the most sacred rights of individuals, and\r\nthat, anyhow, they were as much subject to the \"States,\" acting in\r\ntheir sovereign capacities, as any other part of the Government. He\r\ncould see no way for preserving the rights of the minority and of\r\nindividuals, in last resort, against governmental usurpation, save\r\nthrough the power of \"_each of the parties_ to the compact\" to prevent\r\nthe execution within the territory subject to its jurisdiction of such\r\ngovernmental measures as it might deem usurpations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nullification and anti-nullification parties in South\r\nCarolina.]\r\n\r\nDown to the time of these utterances of Calhoun the party in South\r\nCarolina opposed to any resistance, by force, to the execution of the\r\ntariff laws, had been able to prevent the outbreak of nullification.\r\nThe leaders of this party were among the most distinguished and\r\ninfluential men of the Commonwealth. They were Mr. Drayton, the member\r\nof Congress from the Charleston district, Judge Johnson of the United\r\nStates Supreme Court, Mr. Petigru, Mr. Grimke, the Lowndes, and others\r\nof scarcely less note. In the first half of the year 1831 they still\r\nheld control of the municipal government of Charleston, and of the\r\nlegislature of the Commonwealth, although the \"States' rights\" men had\r\nobtained the governorship. Nearly all of the opponents of\r\nnullification denounced the tariff laws as unjust and oppressive to\r\nthe South, but they also denounced the doctrine that the execution of\r\nany law of the United States could be constitutionally resisted,\r\nexcept by means of the judicial processes provided for the case by the\r\nConstitution itself. Resistance in any other {182} manner, they\r\ndeclared, would be rebellion at the outset, revolution if successful.\r\nThey said that they were not willing to assume any such\r\nresponsibilities in opposing the tariff laws, and that they regarded\r\nthe blessings of the Union as too great and manifold to hazard\r\ndisunion, even if it could be successfully and peaceably accomplished.\r\n\r\nTheir views were so candid and reasonable that, in spite of the\r\nintense excitement which prevailed during the legislative session\r\nfollowing the failure of the attempt to modify the tariff, they\r\nprevented the nullifiers from securing a sufficient majority in the\r\nlegislature to order the call of a convention. The nullifiers had\r\ncommitted themselves to the doctrine that the nullifying power was a\r\npower of sovereignty, not of government, and that it resided,\r\ntherefore, in the convention, not in the legislature. So long, then,\r\nas the assembly of the convention could be prevented, nullification\r\ncould be certainly thwarted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of the municipal government of Charleston by the\r\nnullifiers.]\r\n\r\nBut the publication of Calhoun's new doctrine in the summer of 1831\r\ngave great strength to the nullifiers, and in the municipal election\r\nof the latter part of the year they captured the mayorship of\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First attempt to try the validity of the Tariff in the\r\nUnited States courts.]\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest moral forces in the hands of the opponents of\r\nnullification against which the nullifiers had to contend was the\r\ngenerally received doctrine that the constitutional means for meeting\r\nCongressional usurpation in any given case was a process in the United\r\nStates courts. Unless they could say that they had tried this means in\r\nvain, they would still have to suffer the imputation of too hasty\r\naction, if nothing more. In order to escape this, two Charleston\r\nlawyers imported a package of dutiable goods, gave bonds for the\r\npayment of the duty, {183} refused payment, and were sued upon their\r\nbonds in the United States District Court. The plan was to have the\r\nquestion of the constitutionality of the tariff submitted to the jury,\r\nbut the court refused to allow the jury to decide any question except\r\nthat which pertained to the due execution of the bond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nullification and rebellion.]\r\n\r\nThe nullifiers could now declare that every means suggested by their\r\nopponents as regular and lawful had been tried and had failed, and\r\nthat there now remained only submission to oppression, or\r\nnullification, or rebellion. They said that no true South Carolinian\r\ncould accept the first, and that, therefore, the choice lay between\r\nnullification and rebellion. Calhoun taught that there was a vast\r\ndifference between the two; that the former was a constitutional, as\r\nwell as a sovereign, method of resistance. He asserted that it was the\r\ngreat conservative principle of the Constitution, and defined it to be\r\nthat reserved right whereby a \"State,\" in convention assembled, might\r\nsuspend the operation of a Congressional act upon its citizens which\r\nit considered unconstitutional, until conventions in three-fourths of\r\nthe \"States\" should pronounce the Congressional act to be\r\nconstitutional. He did not claim that this right was reserved\r\nspecifically, but by implication from the general language of the\r\nTenth Amendment. He was doubtless sincere, or at least thought he was.\r\nMany of his followers certainly were, and the masses, who could not\r\nunderstand the doctrine, but took it on faith, were so certain of its\r\ntruth that they were ready to risk anything for its vindication.\r\n\r\nThe Unionists, however, branded the doctrine as a deception. An\r\neditorial in one of their principal newspapers contained this\r\nsentence: \"But this everlasting cant of devotion to the Union,\r\naccompanied by a recommendation to do those acts that must necessarily\r\ndestroy {184} it, is beyond patient endurance from a people not\r\nabsolutely confined in their own mad-houses.\" It was clear to them, at\r\nthe outset, that nullification was piecemeal secession and rebellion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's message of December, 1831, on the Tariff issue.]\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things in South Carolina when Congress assembled\r\non the first Monday of December, 1831. On the 6th the President's\r\nannual message was laid before the two Houses. It contained a much\r\nmore distinct and decided recommendation for the reduction of duties\r\nthan he had ever before expressed. He called attention to the prospect\r\nof the early extinguishment of the public debt, when the annual\r\ninstalment to the sinking fund would be no longer needed, and\r\nrecommended that Congress should at once deal with the question of the\r\nreduction of the duties to a point where they would produce no more\r\nrevenue than would be necessary for an economical administration of\r\nthe Government. He farther recommended the readjustment of the duties\r\nwith a view to equal justice to all national interests, and said that\r\nthe interests of both merchant and manufacturer required that the\r\nchange should be prospective.\r\n\r\nThere was no suggestion in the message of increasing the expenditures\r\nof the Government for internal improvements, or for any other purpose.\r\nThe plain inference from the message was that by March 4th, 1833, the\r\ndebt would all be paid, and the revenue could then be reduced by ten\r\nor twelve millions a year, and should be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The question of the proper committee to frame Tariff\r\nBills.]\r\n\r\nThis was all that the South Carolinians had asked, and it would have\r\nbeen the height of folly for them to have pursued extraordinary means\r\nto relieve themselves when regular methods promised at last a prospect\r\nof success. This part of the message was referred to the committee on\r\nManufactures, of which ex-President John Quincy Adams was then\r\nchairman. Mr. Adams {185} had far more moderate views in regard to the\r\ntariff than the majority of his protectionist brethren, and it could\r\nbe reasonably hoped that he would report a bill from his committee\r\nwhich would be conciliatory in character. The Southerners were not\r\nquite willing, however, to rest entirely on his own good will, and\r\nraised the contention that the subject of the tariff ought to be\r\nreferred either to the committee on Ways and Means, or to the\r\ncommittee on Commerce, since the power to impose duties was incident\r\neither to the raising of revenue or to the regulation of commerce. The\r\nresult of the contention was that a resolution was introduced, and\r\ntaken up, requesting the committee on Commerce to make a report on the\r\nworking of the tariff, and the committee on Ways and Means was allowed\r\nto report a tariff bill, which was read twice and referred to the\r\ncommittee of the Whole House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill from the Committee on Ways and Means.]\r\n\r\nThe bill from the committee on Ways and Means provided for the\r\nreduction of the duty to twelve and one-half per centum _ad valorem_\r\non all articles; on some, immediately and totally, but on the more\r\nimportant articles gradually, and in a period of a little more than\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nThis was undoubtedly an ill digested measure. It was not only a\r\nradical reduction of duties, but it was an indiscriminate reduction.\r\nMr. McDuffie's own committee were not unanimous in recommending it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff Bill of 1832 from the Committee on\r\nManufactures.]\r\n\r\nOn May 23rd Mr. Adams reported the bill from the committee on\r\nManufactures. Mr. Adams based his bill on the report of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, of December 7th, 1831, and proposed the repeal of the\r\nexisting system of minimal valuations and the duty on coarse wool\r\naltogether, and a slight reduction of the duties on fine wool and\r\nwoollen fabrics.\r\n\r\n{186} It was calculated that Mr. Adams' bill would reduce the receipts\r\nfrom the customs by about five or six millions of dollars, leaving\r\nthus still an annual surplus of some five or six millions after the\r\nextinguishment of the debt.\r\n\r\nMr. McDuffie's bill was taken up first in the committee of the Whole\r\nHouse. Mr. McDuffie defended it with his argument, already stated,\r\nthat the producers of the exports pay finally the duties on the\r\nimports for which the exports are exchanged in the foreign markets,\r\nand cited recent utterances of Professor Senior, the noted political\r\neconomist of Oxford University, in support of his position. He could\r\nnot, however, convince the House, and his bill was finally disposed of\r\nin less than a week. Mr. Adams' bill was then taken up. It was\r\nunderstood as proposing a slight reduction all around. It was intended\r\nto do so. But Mr. McDuffie made an argument against it, in which he\r\nundertook to prove, and declared that he did prove, that it\r\ndiscriminated still further against the South, and imposed a heavier\r\nburden upon that section than it was even then bearing, grievous as\r\nthat was. He declared, finally, that he would not submit to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the Tariff of 1832 by the House of\r\nRepresentatives.]\r\n\r\nThe House, however, was neither convinced by his argument nor\r\nintimidated by his threat. It passed the bill on June 28th, by a large\r\nmajority, a majority of more than two to one.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Senate had been occupying itself with an exhaustive\r\ndiscussion of the principle of the tariff. On January 9th, 1832, Mr.\r\nClay introduced the famous resolution for making the tariff upon\r\narticles coming into competition with home manufactures a system of\r\npermanent high duties, and for abolishing, or greatly reducing, the\r\nduties upon all other articles.\r\n\r\n{187} Senator Hayne immediately grasped the import of this\r\nproposition. He declared that it marked a new era in the tariff\r\nsystem. He demonstrated that down to that time the protection of\r\nmanufactures had been regarded by all persons and parties as a\r\ntemporary policy and had been justified as such, while this\r\nproposition looked to its establishment as a permanent principle of\r\nthe policy of the country, which neither revenue surplus nor\r\nmanufacturing experience should affect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"American System.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Clay, who had himself spoken of protection before this as only a\r\ntemporary policy, acknowledged the truth of Colonel Hayne's criticism,\r\nand proceeded, in his famous three days' speech, to develop the\r\narguments for the permanent protective system, the \"American System,\"\r\nas he termed it, which made up the text-book for the later supporters\r\nof that system. His idea was simply to collect the duties from those\r\nforeign products which come into competition in the home markets with\r\ndomestic products, and prevent the accumulation of a Treasury surplus\r\nby fixing the duties so high in rate as to make them largely\r\nprohibitory. As we have seen, this idea had been already foreshadowed\r\nin one of President Jackson's earlier messages. It now received its\r\ncomplete formulation and its economic justification.\r\n\r\nBut it was a sad prospect for the South. The South had looked forward\r\nto the extinguishment of the debt as necessarily bringing in its train\r\nthe decrease of duties to the gross amount of at least ten millions of\r\ndollars per annum, and now it was called upon to consider the plan for\r\na decrease of revenue by an increase of duties. It is hardly\r\nastonishing that the disappointment should have been bitter, and that\r\npassionate men should have thought of resistance to what appeared to\r\nthem so grievously unjust.\r\n\r\n{188} The Senate referred Mr. Clay's resolution, together with an\r\namendment to it, proposed by Colonel Hayne, for a general reduction of\r\nduties, to its committee on Manufactures. The committee reported a\r\nbill based on Mr. Clay's principle. The Constitution does not,\r\nhowever, allow the Senate to originate a bill for raising revenue, and\r\nthe majority of the Senators voted to lay the bill on the table, and\r\nawait the movements in the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill in the Senate.]\r\n\r\nOn June 29th the House bill appeared in the Senate, and was referred\r\nby that body to its committee on Manufactures. On July 2nd Mr.\r\nDickerson reported from this committee the House bill, with a series\r\nof amendments to it, proposed by the committee. These amendments were\r\nall in the direction of Mr. Clay's idea, and were adopted by the\r\nSenate. The bill as thus amended passed the Senate on July 9th, the\r\nSenators from every Northern Commonwealth voting for it, and those\r\nfrom every Southern Commonwealth, except Kentucky, Missouri, and\r\nLouisiana, voting against it. Missouri was hardly to be then classed\r\nas a Southern Commonwealth. Louisiana was won by an increase of the\r\nduty on sugar. And only one of the Senators from Kentucky voted\r\nagainst the measure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill as finally passed.]\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives refused to concur in some of the\r\namendments, and the measure was sent to a Conference committee. This\r\ncommittee patched up a compromise, and the bill became a law on July\r\n14th.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it was doubtful if the bill, with the changes imposed\r\nupon it by the Senate, would prove to be any relief to the South. Many\r\nof the Southerners claimed that it would increase the burden upon that\r\nsection, while none of them appeared to think it would lighten it.\r\n\r\n{189} What now were the planters to do? They had waited for the\r\nextinguishment of the debt, and for the period when the Treasury would\r\nno longer require the sixteen millions of dollars per annum applied to\r\nits cancellation, hoping for a general reduction of duties by\r\nsomething like this sum as the necessary result; but instead of this\r\nthey were now offered, as a final solution of the tariff question, a\r\nslight reduction of duties on articles coming into competition with\r\nhome products, a practical abolition of the duties on those which did\r\nnot come into competition with home products, and an increase in the\r\nexpenses of the Government to the amount of the receipts whatever they\r\nmight be. This was to be the permanent policy of the country, the\r\n\"American System.\"\r\n\r\nThey were indeed wofully disappointed, not to say deceived. There\r\nseemed now no further hope of aid to them, from either Congress, the\r\nPresident, or the courts. They must yield unconditionally and\r\nhopelessly, or resist the execution of the law. The former course was\r\ntoo much to expect from the proud barons of South Carolina. The only\r\nquestion was whether some legal basis for the resistance could be\r\nfound, or whether it must take on the form of rebellion. We have\r\nalready considered Calhoun's doctrine of nullification, and his claim\r\nthat it was a constitutional remedy; it now remains for us to trace\r\nbriefly the history of the attempt to apply it. Before, however, we\r\ncan do this intelligently, we must consider the other political\r\ndevelopments of the year 1832, occasioned chiefly by the presidential\r\nelection of that year, but affecting directly or indirectly the\r\nattitude of the Administration toward events in South Carolina, and\r\nthe attitude of Congress toward the President in dealing with\r\nnullification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{190}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES BANK AND THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST OF 1832\r\n\r\nJackson and the Bank in his First Annual Message--Jackson's Relations\r\nto the Portsmouth Branch of the Bank--Jackson's Opposition in\r\nPrinciple to the Bank--The Political Science of the Constitution of\r\n1787--Western Democracy--The West and the \"Money Power\" of the\r\nEast--\"States' rights\" and the Bank--The Case of Brown and\r\nMaryland--Democracy and Socialism--Benton's Attack on the Bank--Benton\r\nRepulsed--Jackson and Benton--The Bank and the People--The Existence\r\nof the Bank made a Political Issue--Jackson's Second Attack on the\r\nBank--Jackson's Plan for a Bank--Benton's Resolution against the\r\nRe-charter of the Bank--Jackson's Challenge to make the Continued\r\nExistence of the Bank the Issue in the Campaign of 1832--The Challenge\r\nAccepted--The Bank's Petition for Re-charter--Benton's Charge of\r\nIllegal Practices--Passage of the Bill for Re-charter--The Veto of the\r\nBank Bill--The Bank and Foreign Powers--The Bank and the West--The\r\nBank and the Rich--Structure and Powers of the Bank--Jackson on\r\nExecutive Independence--Von Holst's Criticism of the Veto Message--The\r\nPresident's Real Meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson and the Bank in his first annual message.]\r\n\r\nIn his first annual message, that of December 8th, 1829, President\r\nJackson began his war upon the United States Bank. He declared in it\r\nthat the constitutionality and expediency of the law creating the Bank\r\nwere well questioned by a large portion of the people, and that its\r\nfailure to establish a sound and uniform currency, the great end of\r\nits existence, must be admitted by all.\r\n\r\n{191} [Sidenote: Jackson's relations to the Portsmouth branch of the\r\nBank.]\r\n\r\nBasing themselves chiefly upon an individual report made by Mr. John\r\nQuincy Adams on May 14th, 1832, in regard to the condition of the\r\nBank, and upon documents referred to in that report, recent historians\r\nattribute President Jackson's first attack upon the United States Bank\r\nto a personal feud between his friends in New Hampshire and Mr.\r\nWebster's friends there.\r\n\r\nSenator Levi Woodbury, of New Hampshire, the leader of the Jackson\r\nparty in New Hampshire, endeavored, in the summer of 1829, to have\r\nJeremiah Mason, Mr. Webster's great friend, removed from the\r\npresidency of the branch of the United States Bank at Portsmouth, N.\r\nH., and Isaac Hill, another New Hampshire friend of the President,\r\nattempted at the same time to have the United States pension agency,\r\nconnected with the Portsmouth branch of the United States Bank,\r\nremoved to Concord, and connected with a little bank there of which\r\nHill had been president, and in which he was still interested.\r\nJackson's Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Ingham, asked Mr. Biddle, the\r\npresident of the United States Bank, to have Mason removed, and his\r\nSecretary of War, Mr. Eaton, ordered Mason to transfer the pension\r\nagency to Hill's bank in Concord. Mr. Biddle looked into the matter,\r\nand being convinced that the whole thing was a political scheme,\r\nrefused to have Mason removed from office, and prevented the execution\r\nof Eaton's order in regard to the transfer of the pension agency.\r\n\r\nThese are, very briefly stated, the facts upon which some of the\r\nAmerican historians found the theory that Jackson, entertaining no\r\nopposition in principle to the Bank at the beginning of his\r\nAdministration, became so enraged at its managers, because of their\r\nsuccess in these petty bouts with his Cabinet officers, that he {192}\r\nresolved upon its destruction. The treatment which Adams and Clay had\r\nreceived at the hands of Jackson and his friends from 1824 onward had\r\nled them to feel that Jackson's whole nature was full of personal\r\nrancor, and that he could see nothing except from a personal point of\r\nview. There is little doubt that this feeling largely determined\r\nAdams' ideas of Jackson's attitude in the Bank question, and that the\r\nhistorians have written the account of the Bank controversy under the\r\ninfluence of Adams' representations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's opposition in principle to the Bank.]\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly some truth in this view of the matter, but it is\r\nfar from being the whole truth. It is not even that part of the truth\r\nwhich is most valuable to the student of American history. There was\r\nan opposition in principle to the United States Bank, as well as a\r\npersonal conflict between leaders in regard to it. That opposition in\r\nprinciple was the opposition of \"States' rights\" democracy to\r\ncentralized privilege.\r\n\r\nIn all political systems there is a political science as well as a\r\npublic, or constitutional, law. The political science of a state is\r\nbased chiefly upon the actual social conditions and relations of its\r\npopulation, and its public or constitutional law ought to be based\r\nupon its political science. In fact, however, we seldom see social\r\nconditions, political theory, and public law in a state of perfect\r\nharmony. It is the prime problem of political and legal progress to\r\nwork out this great result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The political science of the Constitution of 1787.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Western Democracy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The West and the \"money power\" of the East.]\r\n\r\nThe political science or theory upon which the Constitution of 1787\r\nwas founded was thoroughly English. It recognized social distinctions,\r\nand its most fundamental principle was compromise between conflicting\r\ninterests. It was substantially in harmony with social conditions, on\r\nthe one side, {193} and was fairly expressed through the Constitution\r\nof 1787, on the other. Without the interposition of other forces it\r\nwould have made out of the United States a new England. But French\r\npolitical science had already gained a foothold in the country. It was\r\ncontained in the Declaration of Independence, and its prime postulate\r\nwas \"the equality of all men.\" It did not then comport with the social\r\ncondition of the country, and the Constitution did not make its\r\nprinciple into positive law. It was, therefore, at the beginning,\r\nabstract, and theoretical. The man who taught it, however, became\r\nPresident, and the party which embraced it became the governing party.\r\nBut their practice was not made consistent with their theory, and\r\ncould not be, so long as the social conditions of the country\r\ncontradicted their theory. It was the settlement of the country west\r\nof the Alleghanies which first created social conditions in harmony\r\nwith their theory. The distinction between master and slave was not\r\npermitted to enter the larger portion of it; the distinction between\r\nthe rich and the poor could not at first exist, or be, for many years,\r\ndeveloped; and the distinction between the cultivated and the ignorant\r\nwas likewise obliged to remain long in abeyance; while the dangers and\r\nthe hardships of frontier life developed, speedily, a strong sense of\r\nself-reliance and self-esteem. General equality and practical\r\nself-help were the first social results of the levelling experiences\r\nof the camp, the wilderness, and the prairie. With such influences\r\noperating upon such characters as undertook the making of the West,\r\nthe most adventurous part of the population of the East, that bold and\r\nboastful Democracy was produced, which began after 1820 to make itself\r\npowerfully felt in modifying the original conservative principles of\r\nthe institutions of the country. Connect with these new social\r\nconditions, and the {194} political principles evolved out of them,\r\nthe fact that the West, like all new countries, had little money or\r\ncapital, and was a constant borrower from the East, in order to\r\nfurnish itself with roads, implements, means of transportation, and\r\nmanufactured articles, and we have the forces and the interests which\r\nwere bound, under the first general financial pressure, to make an\r\nonslaught upon the \"money power and privilege\" of the East, as\r\nembodied in the United States Bank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"States' rights\" and the Bank.]\r\n\r\nThe \"States' rights\" opposition to the Bank had been aroused more than\r\na decade before Jackson's message of 1829. The Bank and its branches\r\nwere the sole depositories of the funds of the Government. By refusing\r\nto accept on deposit the bills of Commonwealth banks which did not\r\nredeem their bills in specie on demand, the Bank could prevent the\r\nofficers of the Government from accepting such bills for dues to the\r\nGovernment. The Bank used this power to force the Commonwealth banks\r\nto specie payment. It was one of the purposes for which Congress\r\ncreated the Bank. It made the Bank, however, very unpopular with the\r\nofficers and stockholders of the banks chartered by the Commonwealths.\r\nThese persons were, as a rule, men of influence in their respective\r\ncommunities, and they succeeded in persuading many of the people that\r\nthe United States Bank was a centralized monopoly, and was using its\r\npowers and privileges to oppress the institutions of the\r\nCommonwealths.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 the legislatures of Ohio and Maryland imposed a heavy tax on\r\nthe branches of the Bank located within their respective\r\njurisdictions. The purpose was to drive them out. The Bank resisted\r\npayment, and was sustained by the United States courts.\r\n\r\n{195} [Sidenote: The case of Brown and Maryland.]\r\n\r\nIn the February term of 1819 the Supreme Court of the United States\r\ndecided the famous case of McCulloch and Maryland, declaring the act\r\nof Congress creating the Bank constitutional, and the act of the\r\nMaryland legislature undertaking to tax it unconstitutional. Maryland\r\nsubmitted at once, but the officers of the government of Ohio forced\r\ntheir way into the branch of the Bank in that State, at Chillicothe,\r\nand took one hundred thousand dollars out of the vault, and that too\r\nin the face of an injunction issued by the United States Circuit\r\nCourt. The directors sued the officers of the Commonwealth for\r\ntrespass, and the Commonwealth refused the use of its jails to confine\r\nthe persons arrested. At the same time the Commonwealth reduced the\r\ntax to ten thousand dollars, and refunded ninety thousand, and finally\r\nreceded entirely from its unlawful demand.\r\n\r\nThis defeat of the \"States' rights\" attack, and the excellent\r\nmanagement of the Bank by Langdon Cheves, and then by Nicholas Biddle,\r\nseem to have silenced the complaints against the Bank from 1823 to\r\n1828.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Democracy and Socialism.]\r\n\r\nIt was during this period, however, that the \"State socialistic\"\r\ncharacteristic of radical democracy received a strong development in\r\nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, through the relief measures for debtors;\r\nwhich measures threatened to destroy the constitutional guarantees of\r\nprivate property. The \"relief party\" secured the legislature and the\r\nexecutive of the Commonwealth. The judiciary, however, stood out\r\nagainst them, and they did not have the necessary two-thirds majority\r\nin the legislature to remove the judges. The legislature, however,\r\npassed a new judiciary act, and created another supreme court of the\r\nCommonwealth. This scandal of judicial anarchy existed for nearly two\r\nyears, when, at last, in 1826, the {196} \"anti-relief\" party elected a\r\nmajority of the legislative members, and the new legislature repealed\r\nthe act establishing the new court.\r\n\r\nJackson's friends in Kentucky belonged almost exclusively to the\r\n\"relief party,\" and it is hardly fanciful to attribute to this\r\nmovement in Kentucky some influence in the formation of Jackson's\r\nideas in regard to the United States Bank, and in regard to his plan\r\nfor a Government bank, responsible to the people and managed for the\r\nbenefit of the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Benton's attack on the Bank.]\r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, 1828, Senator Benton began his warfare upon the Bank. He\r\nattacked its privilege of being the depository of Government money. He\r\nclaimed that there were two or three millions of dollars of Government\r\nmoney used in loans by the Bank, which earned about one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand dollars a year of interest, all of which went to the\r\nstockholders of the Bank and none of it to the Government, while the\r\nGovernment was all the time paying interest on the public debt and\r\ntaxing the people for the purpose. He wanted to take the surplus\r\ndeposits out of the Bank and pay a part of the public debt with them.\r\nThis was the first charge of the Western Democracy upon privilege, as\r\nbeing opposed to the principle of universal equality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Benton repulsed.]\r\n\r\nThere were, however, enough practical men in the Senate who considered\r\nthis privilege as only a fair compensation for the service rendered by\r\nthe Bank to the Government in transporting the Government funds\r\nwithout any specific return therefor, and who knew that it is not good\r\nbanking to pay interest on deposits, to reject Mr. Benton's\r\nresolution. Benton repeated his motion on January 1st, 1829, but with\r\nno greater success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson and Benton.]\r\n\r\nAfter March 4th, 1829, the leadership of the party was {197} in the\r\nhands of the President, and Benton became Jackson's lieutenant in the\r\nSenate. There had been personal feuds between the two men, but they\r\nnow harmonized politically, and in no point did that harmony become\r\nmore complete than in the war against the Bank.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that at the moment of his accession to power Jackson\r\nhad not thought out the relation of the democratic principle to the\r\nBank, but he undoubtedly felt it, and the feeling guided him to the\r\nposition which he assumed, first toward the questions of detail in the\r\nBank's policy and management, and then toward the general question of\r\nits existence. The controversy between his Secretaries and the Bank's\r\nofficers, upon which Mr. Adams laid so much stress, probably\r\nprecipitated matters, but the crisis would have developed under other\r\ncircumstances had not these existed. The social and political forces\r\nat play were bound to bring it about under one issue or another. It\r\nmay have astonished the politicians and statesmen of the East then,\r\nand it may astonish the casual reader of American history now, that\r\nJackson attacked the question of the future existence of the Bank in\r\nhis first annual message, but there is nothing surprising in it to the\r\ncareful student of American history, who comprehends the development\r\nof the democratic spirit of the West during the third decade of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bank and the people.]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the President was correct in saying, as he did\r\nin his message of 1829, that a large portion of the people questioned\r\nthe constitutionality and expediency of the law creating the Bank, and\r\nit is certain that the Bank was not considered by all to have failed\r\nin the establishment of a sound and uniform currency. It is far more\r\nprobable that the people generally acquiesced in {198} the decision of\r\nthe Court pronouncing the Bank law constitutional, and that the\r\nmajority of the people, at that moment, regarded it as good policy,\r\nand believed that the Bank had fairly fulfilled the purpose of its\r\ncreation. The President was simply assuming that the people thought as\r\nhe did, as democratic leaders usually do. Taken in that sense there\r\nwas nothing extraordinary in what he said. He had a right to disagree\r\nin opinion with the Court, and to say so, and to make any\r\nrecommendation to Congress which seemed wise to him, in regard to the\r\nre-charter of the Bank. That an expiring law is constitutional is not\r\nalways a convincing argument for its re-enactment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The existence of the Bank made a political issue.]\r\n\r\nThe President's criticism occasioned an investigation into the\r\nprinciple and status of the Bank, and brought the Bank question into\r\nthe politics of the day.\r\n\r\nThe committee on Finance of the Senate, and the committee on Ways and\r\nMeans of the House, made reports, in March and April of 1830,\r\nvigorously defending the constitutionality, the expediency, and the\r\nmanagement of the Bank, and demonstrating the great political and\r\nfinancial dangers of such a Government bank as the President\r\nsuggested. The chairman of the committee on Ways and Means was, it\r\nwill be remembered, Mr. McDuffie, the political economist of the\r\nslavery interest. To his mind the Bank question had evidently little\r\nconnection with the slavery question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's second attack on the Bank.]\r\n\r\nThe President, however, returned to the attack in his message of\r\nDecember 10th, 1830. He also presented, in this message, an\r\nelaboration of his idea of a Government bank. His proposition was for\r\na bank as a branch of the Treasury Department, based on the deposits\r\nof the funds of the Government and also on those made by individuals,\r\nbut {199} having no power to issue notes or make loans or purchase\r\nproperty. Its chief purpose would be to do the business of the\r\nGovernment, and its expenses might be met by selling exchange to\r\nprivate persons at a small rate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's plan for a bank.]\r\n\r\nThe President thought that this scheme avoided all the objections to\r\nthe existing Bank, and yet preserved all of the latter's advantages.\r\nIt would require no charter of incorporation, would have neither\r\nstockholders, nor debtors, nor property, would require few officers,\r\nand would leave to the Commonwealths the creation of their own local\r\npaper currency through their own banks, while the new Government bank\r\nwould be able to check the issues of the Commonwealth banks through\r\nits power to refuse to take their bills on deposit or for exchange,\r\nunless they redeemed them with specie. In a sentence, his doctrine now\r\nwas that banking must be left as far as possible to Commonwealth law,\r\nand that such powers as the general Government had received from the\r\nConstitution over the subject should be exercised by the Government,\r\nif at all, through its own officials, for the benefit of the people,\r\nand not be conferred as privileges upon a corporation of private\r\npersons, to be exercised for their private gain. This will be at once\r\nrecognized as a democratic, \"States' rights,\" socialistic scheme in\r\nthe essential elements of its composition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Benton's resolution against the re-charter of the Bank.]\r\n\r\nBefore the report of the Finance committee of the Senate upon this\r\npart of the message was presented Senator Benton offered a resolution,\r\non February 2nd, 1831, which provided that the charter of the Bank\r\nought not to be renewed. In his speech supporting the resolution the\r\nsenator developed the whole \"States' rights,\" socialistic, democratic\r\nargument against the Bank with great elaboration, both in principle\r\nand in detail.\r\n\r\n{200} It is true that Benton did not go so far as Jackson in the\r\nsocialistic direction. He said that he was willing to vote for the\r\nPresident's Government bank scheme, since it would substitute for the\r\nexisting Bank an institution which would be divested of the essential\r\nfeatures of a bank, the power to make loans and discounts, but that he\r\nwould prefer to see the charter of the Bank expire without any\r\nsubstitute being created for it.\r\n\r\nThe Senate was not, however, convinced by Mr. Benton's argument, and\r\nrefused to allow him to introduce his resolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's challenge to make the continued existence of the\r\nBank the issue in the campaign of 1832.]\r\n\r\nIn his message of December 6th, 1831, President Jackson referred to\r\nwhat he had said in former messages concerning the Bank, and closed\r\nhis allusion with the following significant words: \"Having thus\r\nconscientiously discharged a constitutional duty, I deem it proper, on\r\nthis occasion, without a more particular reference to the views of the\r\nsubject then expressed, to leave it for the present to the\r\ninvestigation of an enlightened people and their representatives.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The challenge accepted.]\r\n\r\nThis language certainly seemed to imply that the President would, so\r\nfar as he was able, make the question of the re-charter of the Bank\r\none of the issues of the election campaign of 1832. His opponents so\r\ninterpreted him, and they gladly accepted the challenge, for they\r\nbelieved the Bank to be popular with the voters. They thought that the\r\nSenators and Representatives in Congress, a majority of whom favored\r\nthe Bank, truly represented the views of their constituencies, and\r\nthey calculated to be able to split the Democratic party itself on the\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nThe president and directors of the Bank, however, were most reluctant\r\nto have the existence of the Bank made a party question. The leaders\r\nof the National {201} Republicans, on the other hand, insisted upon\r\nit. Clay, who, six days after the appearance of the President's\r\nmessage, had been nominated by a national convention at Baltimore as\r\nthe candidate of the National Republicans for the presidency, was\r\ncertain that under the issue of the renewal of the Bank's charter\r\nJackson would be signally defeated. The Bank's officers yielded to his\r\nadvice, enforced by that of Mr. Webster, and on January 9th, 1832,\r\nsent in the memorial for a re-charter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bank's petition for re-charter.]\r\n\r\nSenator Dallas presented the memorial, but said that he personally had\r\ndiscouraged its presentation at that juncture out of apprehension that\r\nthe question of the re-charter of the Bank might, at the moment, be\r\ndrawn into real or imagined conflict with \"some higher, some more\r\nfavorite, some more immediate wish or purpose of the American people.\"\r\nSenator Dallas was a Bank Democrat. The more favorite wish to which he\r\nreferred was the re-election of Jackson, and the inference to be drawn\r\nfrom his words was that the Bank Democrats did not want to be obliged\r\nto choose between the Bank and Jackson at the next election.\r\n\r\nThe Senate referred the petition for re-charter to a committee\r\ncomposed of Mr. Dallas, Mr. Webster, Mr. Ewing, Mr. Hayne, and Mr.\r\nJohnston.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Benton's charge of illegal practices.]\r\n\r\nBefore the committee made its report Mr. Benton made another attack\r\nupon the Bank. This time he charged it with illegal practices in\r\nissuing drafts which passed as currency. The Senate, however, repelled\r\nthe attack and refused to allow Mr. Benton to introduce his resolution\r\ndeclaring such drafts illegal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the bill for re-charter.]\r\n\r\nOn March 13th Mr. Dallas brought in the bill from his committee for\r\nthe re-charter of the Bank for fifteen years from the expiration of\r\nits existing charter in 1836.\r\n\r\n{202} While the bill was passing through the Senate a demonstration\r\nagainst the Bank was in progress in the House. Mr. Clayton, of\r\nGeorgia, an enemy of the Bank, secured the appointment of a committee\r\nby the Speaker of the House, Mr. Stevenson, another enemy of the Bank,\r\nto inquire into the affairs of the Bank, and make report thereof to\r\nthe House. A majority report was offered by Mr. Clayton severely\r\ncriticising the Bank, and a minority report by Mr. McDuffie defending\r\nthe Bank most ably and vigorously, and, if we may judge from the vote\r\nof the House upon the Senate bill for re-charter, which had passed the\r\nSenate, and appeared at this moment in the House for concurrence, most\r\nsuccessfully. The House passed the Senate bill, with a few immaterial\r\nchanges, by a vote of one hundred and seven to eighty-five.\r\n\r\nThe National Republicans felt sure that they had driven Jackson into a\r\nblind alley. But the \"Old Hero\" stood his ground and hurled a veto at\r\nthe bill, which both killed it and conquered the National Republican\r\nparty in the election of 1832 with its own chosen weapon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto of the Bank Bill.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bank and foreign powers.]\r\n\r\nThe veto message was a curious _pot-pourri_ of strength and weakness,\r\nof sound statesmanship and cheap demagogism, of shrewd politics and\r\nsilly commonplaces. We may arrange its score of points under five\r\nprincipal heads, or rather ends in view. The first was the attempt to\r\nrouse the national spirit against the Bank, on account of the fact\r\nthat some eight millions of dollars' worth of the stock was in the\r\nhands of foreigners. The President made out that this was a great\r\ndanger to the United States, both in war and peace. In war, he said,\r\nthe Bank would be an internal enemy, more terrible than the army and\r\nnavy of the external foe. Just how the possession of the certificates\r\nof stock by foreigners, whose money, which had been paid for {203}\r\nthem, was in the United States, and therefore under the control of the\r\nUnited States Government, could endanger the United States in case of\r\na war between the United States and the country or countries to which\r\nthese foreign stockholders belonged, the President failed to explain.\r\nIt would seem to the ordinary mind that this would be an advantage to\r\nthe United States, in that the Government of the United States would\r\nhave within its grasp a part of the money power of the enemy.\r\nMoreover, the Bank law prevented the foreign stockholders from voting\r\nin the election of the directors of the Bank. How these stockholders\r\ncould possibly exercise any hostile influence then, except by selling\r\ntheir stock to citizens of the United States, and taking the money\r\nwhich they might receive for it out of the country, was not only not\r\nexplained but is inexplicable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bank and the West.]\r\n\r\nThe second object was apparently the excitement of the West against\r\nthe East. The President declared that the West was being made\r\nfinancially tributary to the East by the Bank. He presented the\r\nstatistics of stockholding and interest-paying throughout the\r\ndifferent sections of the country in proof of this statement. He\r\naffirmed that thirteen millions five hundred and twenty-two thousand\r\ndollars' worth of the stock was owned in the Northeastern and Middle\r\nCommonwealths, that five millions six hundred and twenty-three\r\nthousand dollars' worth of it was held in Virginia, the Carolinas, and\r\nGeorgia, and that only one hundred and forty thousand and two hundred\r\ndollars' worth of it was held in the nine Western Commonwealths; while\r\none million six hundred and forty thousand and forty-eight dollars of\r\nthe profits of the Bank came from these Western Commonwealths, one\r\nmillion four hundred and sixty-three thousand and forty-one dollars of\r\nthem {204} from the Northeastern and Middle Commonwealths, and three\r\nhundred and fifty-two thousand and five hundred and seven dollars of\r\nthem from the Southern Commonwealths. This seems to ordinary\r\nintelligence to prove that the Bank was accommodating Western\r\nborrowers with Eastern money; and as the Bank was limited by its\r\ncharter to a maximum of six per centum interest on its loans, it seems\r\nthat the accommodation was being rendered upon quite moderate\r\nconsideration. But the President said it proved that the \"Eastern\r\nmoney power\" was oppressing the West, and the West was quite willing\r\nto believe anything against the persons or institutions to whom or to\r\nwhich it owed money.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bank and the rich.]\r\n\r\nThe third object to which the President addressed himself in the\r\nmessage was to call the attention of the poor to the proposition that\r\nthe Government was favoring the rich through the Bank. The President\r\ncalled the Bank a monopoly, which means privilege conferred by\r\nGovernment on a few at the expense of the many. He calculated that the\r\nprivilege to be granted to the existing stockholders by the re-charter\r\nof the Bank was worth seventeen millions of dollars, while the bonus\r\nwhich they would be required to pay was but three millions. Fourteen\r\nmillions of dollars would thus be presented by the Government to the\r\nBank, which sum the Government must take by taxation from the people.\r\nHe arrived at these statistics and results by assuming that the Bank\r\nstock, after the re-charter and in consequence of it, would be worth\r\nabout one hundred and fifty dollars for one hundred par, that some\r\nother body of stockholders could be found who would pay seventeen\r\nmillions for the charter, and that the money thus acquired from the\r\nsupposed stockholders by the Government would effect the remission of\r\njust so much taxation upon the people. The President saw also, {205}\r\nwith Senator Benton, that the use of the Government deposits by the\r\nBank was a source of income to the stockholders at the popular\r\nexpense. And he denounced the feature in the new bill, which allowed\r\nthe Commonwealth banks to pay their indebtedness to any branch of the\r\nUnited States Bank with the notes of any other branch, but did not\r\naccord the same privilege to individuals, as favoring the rich and\r\npowerful against the poor and weak.\r\n\r\nThe entire argumentation in this part of the message seems extravagant\r\nand exaggerated, to say the least, but it sounded convincing and\r\nsympathetic to the masses. It was something which brought the question\r\nhome to each one of them, and made it appear related to each one's\r\npersonal interest. The statement was a powerful vote-catcher. It took\r\nwonderfully.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Structure and powers of the Bank.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth proposition, as we have arranged them, was the criticism on\r\nthe structure and powers of the Bank provided in the new bill. The\r\nPresident objected to the unnecessarily large amount of the capital\r\nstock, to the right to be given the Bank to locate its own branches,\r\nto the power of the Government, as a stockholder, to own real estate\r\nfor general purposes, and to the power of the Bank to coin money, as\r\nhe called the power to issue its notes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson on executive independence.]\r\n\r\nThe final division of the message, according to our arrangement,\r\ncontains the disquisition upon the relation of the departments of the\r\nGovernment to each other in operating the Constitution, and the\r\nrelation of the general Government to the Commonwealths in regard to\r\njurisdiction over the business of banking. The President held, upon\r\nthe first of these points, that \"if the opinion of the Supreme Court,\"\r\nin the case of McCulloch and Maryland, \"covered the whole ground of\r\nthis act, it ought not to control the {206} co-ordinate authorities of\r\nthe Government.\" \"The Congress, the Executive, and the Court,\" he\r\nsaid, \"must each for itself be guided by its own opinion of the\r\nConstitution. Each public officer who takes an oath to support the\r\nConstitution swears that he will support it as he understands it, and\r\nnot as it is understood by others. It is as much the duty of the House\r\nof Representatives, of the Senate, and of the President, to decide\r\nupon the constitutionality of any bill or resolution which may be\r\npresented to them for passage or approval, as it is of the Supreme\r\nJudges when it may be brought before them for decision. The opinion of\r\nthe Judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of\r\nCongress has over the Judges; and, on that point, the President is\r\nindependent of both. The authority of the Supreme Court must not,\r\ntherefore, be permitted to control the Congress or the Executive when\r\nacting in their legislative capacities, but to have only such\r\ninfluence as the force of their reasoning may deserve.\"\r\n\r\nThe President also said that he could have furnished a plan for a\r\nbank, had it been requested of him, which would have been equal to all\r\nthe duties required by the Government, a plan which might have been\r\nenacted by Congress without straining or overstepping its powers, and\r\nwithout infringing the powers of the Commonwealths; and he complained\r\nthat the Bank, as an agent of the Executive Department, should be\r\nthrust upon the Department without the Department being consulted as\r\nto whether it needed or wanted any such agent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Von Holst's criticism of the veto message.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's real meaning.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated historians of American politics has\r\nindulged in a very severe criticism upon this part of the message,\r\nclaiming that President Jackson virtually asserted therein the power\r\nto initiate legislation, full co-ordination with the Houses of\r\nCongress in legislation, and an {207} independence of Congress, and\r\nespecially of the Judiciary, which, in practice, would render\r\nconstitutional law an impossibility. An impartial examination of the\r\ntext of the message in all its parts will hardly warrant any such\r\nconclusions. It is quite clear, from such examination, that the\r\nPresident meant that in the formation of administrative measures by\r\nthe Congressional committees in charge of the same, the views of the\r\nAdministration ought to be obtained; that the President is not limited\r\nby the Constitution to any class of subjects in the use of his veto\r\npower upon proposed legislation; and that when the Congress and the\r\nPresident are legislating they are not obliged to re-enact a law\r\nsimply because the Judiciary have declared it constitutional, nor even\r\nprevented from repealing a law, simply because the Judiciary have\r\ndeclared it constitutional, and certainly not prohibited from\r\ndiffering in opinion with the Judiciary in regard to the\r\nconstitutionality of any law already on the statute book, or any\r\nproposed measure. Conservative American lawyers, jurists, and\r\npublicists approve all of this as not only the letter but also the\r\nspirit of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's vindication of executive independence.]\r\n\r\nInstead of destroying the Constitution in theory by the doctrine of\r\nthis veto, it looks more as if the President did something to rescue\r\nthe \"check and balance\" system of government, provided in the\r\nConstitution, from the threatened domination of a single department\r\nover the others in it. The fact is, Congress had succeeded, during the\r\nregime of the old Republican party in American politics, in winning a\r\npower over the President which the Constitution did not authorize. The\r\nmembers of Congress had selected all of the Presidents, from Jefferson\r\nto Jackson, either by nomination or by actual election. {208} The\r\nmachinery constructed by the Constitution for the election of the\r\nPresident was wanting in its most necessary part. It contained no\r\nmeans of connection between the electoral colleges in the several\r\nCommonwealths in voting for the President and Vice-President, at the\r\nsame time that it required a majority of all the electoral votes to\r\nelect. The members of Congress being the only national assembly of\r\npersons in the country, and being the chosen political leaders from\r\nthe different Commonwealths, naturally glided into the habit of\r\nconstituting themselves, in caucus, the connecting link between the\r\nelectoral colleges in the several Commonwealths, and thus the\r\nCongressional caucus, or caucuses, as the case might be, became the\r\nnominating body or bodies to the electoral colleges. If the caucus\r\nnominated anybody, it left to the electors the alternative of\r\nratifying the nomination, or of so scattering their votes as to give\r\nno person a majority, in which latter case the election of the\r\nPresident passed into the hands of the members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. If, on the other hand, the caucus did not nominate\r\nanybody, the electors were nearly sure to fail to unite a majority of\r\ntheir votes upon the same person, in which case again the House of\r\nRepresentatives obtained possession of the election. With such an\r\nincreasing control over the tenure of the President, it is not\r\nastonishing that the Congress, and even the individual members of\r\nCongress, exercised an ever increasing control over his acts and his\r\npolicy. The encroaching legislature was fast developing the principle\r\nof parliamentary government as the principle of the American system,\r\nwhile the Constitution provides the principle of executive\r\nindependence and presidential administration.\r\n\r\nAgain, the judicial department had appeared to assume the position\r\nthat it possessed the supreme {209} interpreting power of the\r\nConstitution upon every point. It had not then, as it has now, clearly\r\nconfined itself to questions immediately involving questions of\r\nprivate rights. It appeared to be claiming jurisdiction in regard to\r\nquestions primarily of political science, public law, and even public\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe President's Bank veto called a halt in these tendencies, and\r\nexerted an influence for the restoration of executive independence,\r\nand of the \"check and balance\" system, provided in the Constitution;\r\nand it called the people into a closer and more immediate relation to\r\nthe President than they had before occupied, in that the President now\r\nappealed to them to decide the question between him and the Congress,\r\nin the election which was then about to take place.\r\n\r\nThese were the political principles contained in the Bank veto, and\r\nwhether they, or the more democratic principle of anti-monopoly, or\r\nthe more socialistic principle of government banking, moved the\r\nmasses, certainly they were profoundly moved. Had the popular vote\r\nbeen taken, the day before the appearance of the veto, upon the\r\nquestion of the Bank's re-charter, it is altogether probable that an\r\noverwhelming majority would have been found in its favor. Against the\r\nveto, however, no sufficient majority could be united in Congress, and\r\nwhen the results of the presidential election became known, it was\r\nfound that Jackson had carried the country with him in the unequal\r\ncontest, and that the people had made the principles of the Jacksonian\r\ndemocracy the ruling spirit of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{210}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nNULLIFICATION\r\n\r\nThe Indian Question in Georgia--The Indian Springs Convention--The\r\nRepudiation of the Agreement--The Controversy between the\r\nAdministration and Georgia--The Creek Convention of 1826--The Governor\r\nof Georgia Repudiates the Convention of 1826--The President Submits\r\nthe Matter to Congress--Georgia and the Cherokees--Jackson and the\r\nIndian Question--Indian Policy before Jackson--The Case of the\r\nCherokee Nation--The Case of Worcester against Georgia--The Failure of\r\nthe President to Execute the Decision in the Worcester Case--Jackson\r\nand Calhoun--The Call of the Convention of 1832 in South Carolina--The\r\nNullification Ordinance--The Addresses Issued by the Convention--The\r\nActs of the Legislature of South Carolina for the Execution of the\r\nOrdinance--The Meaning of Nullification as Understood by the\r\nNullifiers--Jackson's View of Nullification--The President's\r\nProclamation of December 10th--The President's Military\r\nPreparations--The President's Instructions to the Customs Officers in\r\nSouth Carolina--The Popular Approval of the President's Course--The\r\nVerplanck Tariff Bill--Governor Hayne's Counter-Proclamation--The\r\nPresident's Message of January 16th, 1833--Calhoun's Explanations in\r\nthe Senate--The \"Force Bill\"--The Postponement of the Execution of\r\nNullification--The Compromise Tariff--Mr. Calhoun's Support of Mr.\r\nClay's Bill--The Opposition to the Bill--Passage of the \"Force Bill\"\r\nby the Senate--Passage of the Compromise Tariff Bill and the \"Force\r\nBill\" by Congress--The Nullification Ordinance Withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Indian question in Georgia.]\r\n\r\nBefore nullification was resolved upon in South Carolina, something\r\nlike it had been applied in Georgia. {211} In the year 1802 Georgia\r\nformally ceded the lands claimed by the Commonwealth west of the\r\nChattahoochee River to the United States for the sum of one million\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and upon the condition that\r\nthe United States Government would, at its own expense, extinguish the\r\nIndian claims to any lands in Georgia so soon as this could be done\r\npeacefully and upon reasonable terms.\r\n\r\nBetween 1802 and 1820 the Government made some advance in the\r\ndischarge of this obligation. By this latter date, however, designing\r\nwhite men had joined with the Indian tribes located within the\r\nCommonwealth, and were seeking to organize an Indian State for the\r\npurposes of their own political ambition, and many well disposed white\r\npersons were aiding them from humanitarian motives. The Georgians even\r\naccused the Government of doing things that would contribute to the\r\nsame result. The Georgians were forced to face a very serious\r\nquestion, the question of an Indian State, controlled chiefly by white\r\nadventurers and sentimentalists, within the legal limits of the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nUnder this pressure the Georgians reviewed the whole question of\r\nIndian organization, and rights to territory. They advanced the\r\npropositions, that the Indian tribal organizations were not States and\r\ncould not, therefore, exercise dominion, and give title to real\r\nproperty; that the Indians living within the legal limits of the\r\nCommonwealth were subject to its jurisdiction in the same manner as\r\nother persons, and to the same extent; that the original title to all\r\nland within the limits of Georgia was in the Commonwealth, and every\r\nvalid title must be derived from the Commonwealth; that the claim of\r\nthe Indians to the lands on which the tribes lived was simply an\r\nincumbrance upon Georgia's {212} title, an incumbrance which the\r\ngeneral Government was obligated to remove; and that, after the\r\nGovernment should discharge this duty, Georgia's title would be\r\nperfect, without any formal transfer of these lands to Georgia by the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The demand of Georgia for the extinguishment of the Indian\r\nclaims.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Indian Springs Convention.]\r\n\r\nIn 1819 the legislature of Georgia memorialized President Monroe to\r\nhasten the work of the Government in extinguishing the Indian claims.\r\nIn the year 1824 the Creek chiefs in council resolved that not a foot\r\nof the lands claimed by the Creeks should be relinquished.\r\nNevertheless, President Monroe's administration succeeded, in February\r\nof 1825, in negotiating an agreement with certain of the Creek\r\nchieftains according to which they relinquished to the United States\r\nthe Creek claims to all lands lying within the limits of Georgia, and\r\nalso to lands lying to the northwest and to the west of the\r\nCommonwealth. This agreement was ratified by the Senate of the United\r\nStates in March of the same year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The repudiation of the agreement.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Georgia, Mr. Troup, immediately despatched the public\r\nsurveyors to lay out the relinquished territory. They were resisted by\r\nthe Indians, who declared their repudiation of the agreement of\r\nFebruary 12th with the general Government.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a number of the chiefs were representing to the new\r\nPresident, Mr. Adams, that that agreement was a fraud upon the\r\nIndians, and that the chiefs who signed were not properly authorized\r\nto do so. The agent of the Government to the Creeks supported their\r\nprotest, despite the fact that he was present at the execution of the\r\nagreement. Under these circumstances the Secretary of War, Mr. James\r\nBarbour, wrote to Governor Troup that the President {213} expected him\r\nto abandon the survey until it could be made in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the agreement which allowed the Indians until September\r\n1st, 1826, for their removal, and guaranteed them against all\r\nencroachments before that date.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Controversy between the Administration and Georgia.]\r\n\r\nThe communication from Secretary Barbour gave rise to a spirited\r\ncontroversy between the Governor of Georgia and himself, in which the\r\nGovernor assumed an extreme \"States' rights\" attitude in defence of\r\nhis position. He claimed that Georgia's jurisdiction over, and title\r\nto, the lands formally relinquished by the Creeks to the United States\r\nwere not originated by this act, but were only relieved by it of an\r\nincumbrance, and that, therefore, no additional act was necessary on\r\nthe part of the Government to authorize Georgia to take possession and\r\nexercise jurisdiction. He declared that he would not postpone the\r\nsurvey, and advised the legislature of the Commonwealth to defend\r\nGeorgia's rights by armed resistance, which recommendation the\r\nlegislature seemed about to approve.\r\n\r\nThe President sent General Gaines to the scene of action, and\r\nauthorized him to place the militia of the Commonwealths adjoining\r\nGeorgia in readiness for service. The Governor was highly excited by\r\nthe approach of the military power of the United States, and wrote to\r\nSecretary Barbour virtually accusing the Government of inciting the\r\nIndians to violence against Georgia and her people, and demanding to\r\nbe informed of the purposes of the Administration. Mr. Barbour replied\r\nthat the President had decided that the survey should not proceed, and\r\nhad sent General Gaines with orders to prevent it, with military power\r\nif necessary. The Governor now turned to the President himself, with\r\nboth protest and threat, but the President remained {214} firm, and\r\nthe Governor was obliged to yield for the moment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Creek Convention of 1826.]\r\n\r\nThe Administration was apparently convinced that the agreement of 1825\r\nwas not fairly obtained, and, in January of 1826, entered into another\r\nagreement with the Creeks, which, while recognizing the nullity of the\r\nagreement of 1825, secured the extinguishment of their claims to all\r\nlands in Georgia lying east of the Chattahoochee, and to a\r\nconsiderable tract north and west of this river. The Administration\r\nasserted that all the Creek lands lying within the limits of Georgia\r\nwere secured. Senator Berrien of Georgia, who represented the\r\ninterests of his Commonwealth when the agreement came before the\r\nSenate for ratification, said, on the contrary, that it failed by a\r\nmillion of acres of having done so.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Governor of Georgia repudiates the Convention of 1826.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Troup declared that the general Government could not by an\r\nagreement with the Creeks rob Georgia of vested rights, which had\r\nbeen, once for all, perfected by the agreement of 1825. He ordered the\r\npublic surveyors to include in their surveys the lands claimed by\r\nGeorgia west of the line designated in the agreement of 1826. The\r\nIndians resisted them, and appealed to the President to protect their\r\nrights as recognized by the latter agreement. The President ordered\r\nthe United States District Attorney and Marshal for Georgia to arrest\r\nany one caught in the act of surveying the lands west of the line\r\nfixed by the agreement of 1826. The Governor was informed of this\r\norder, and was given to understand that the President would uphold the\r\nagreement of 1826 by any and all power necessary. The Governor,\r\nhowever, defied the Administration, ordered the law officers of the\r\nCommonwealth to effect, by any means necessary, the release of the\r\narrested surveyors, and to {215} secure the arrest and trial of those\r\npersons who had taken or held them in custody, ordered the commanders\r\nof the militia of the Commonwealth to hold their forces in readiness\r\nto resist the threatened invasion by the military power of the United\r\nStates, and sent a message to the legislature informing that body of\r\nwhat he had done in the premises. In this message he took the ground\r\nthat questions of jurisdiction--he called them questions of\r\nsovereignty--between the general Government and the Commonwealths\r\ncould not be determined by the judicial power of that Government, but\r\nmust be settled by agreement between the two parties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President submits the matter to Congress.]\r\n\r\nPresident Adams was deeply impressed with the seriousness of the\r\nsituation. He felt that he must uphold the dignity and authority of\r\nthe Government at all hazards and by all the means intrusted to him by\r\nthe Constitution and the laws; and yet he was unwilling to provoke\r\ncivil war, if it could be avoided, or to enter upon the work of\r\ncoercion without the practically unanimous support of the country. He\r\nresolved, therefore, to lay the matter before Congress, and await its\r\naction. Congress did practically nothing, and the President was\r\nconvinced that the nation was not prepared to have the Indian problem\r\nfought out under the issue of \"States' rights\" versus the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Georgia and the Cherokees.]\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this success the Georgians now resolved to subject the\r\nCherokees living within the limits of the Commonwealth to the laws\r\nthereof or force them to emigrate. In December of 1827, the\r\nlegislature passed a law extending the criminal jurisdiction of the\r\nCommonwealth over a part of the lands occupied by the Cherokees. The\r\nIndians appealed to the President. The appeal came before the\r\nPresident during the last month of his official term, and he {216}\r\ndiscreetly and courteously resolved not to embarrass the new\r\nAdministration by committing the Government to any position in the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson and the Indian question.]\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson was even less inclined than his predecessor to allow\r\nthe Indian question to resolve itself into the question of the\r\nconstitutional spheres of authority between the Union and the\r\nCommonwealths. Moreover, he believed that Georgia was in the right in\r\nthe Indian question. He replied to the Cherokee memorial that he knew\r\nof no alternative to submission to the jurisdiction of Georgia except\r\nemigration beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. His view was that\r\nthe general Government could not hinder a Commonwealth from exercising\r\njurisdiction over every person within its limits, except in such cases\r\nas were reserved from that jurisdiction by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and could not lend its countenance to the creation of a\r\nnew political organization within these limits against the will of the\r\nCommonwealth. This was the latter part of April, 1829. The Cherokees,\r\ninfluenced largely by the whites among them, resented the President's\r\nadvice, and the council of chiefs resolved that no lands claimed by\r\nthe Cherokees should be relinquished, except by consent of the tribe\r\nor tribes, under penalty of death for violation of their resolve, and\r\nrejected the overtures of the Government for the relinquishment of\r\ntheir claims.\r\n\r\nIn his message of December 8th, 1829, President Jackson devoted much\r\nspace to the Indian problem in general, and to it, as it affected\r\nGeorgia and Alabama, in particular. He repeated to Congress the views\r\nwhich he had expressed to the Cherokees themselves, which were, as we\r\nhave seen, that the general Government could not lend its countenance\r\nto the creation of an {217} Indian State within the confines of any\r\nCommonwealth of the Union against the will of that Commonwealth, and\r\nthat the only alternative to subjection to the laws of the\r\nCommonwealth on the part of the Indians was emigration beyond the\r\nlimits of the same. He also suggested the setting apart of a district\r\nin the far West for the permanent home of such Indian tribes as should\r\nprefer to continue in tribal organization, independent of the\r\njurisdiction of any Commonwealth of the Union, where they might work\r\nout their own customs unmolested.\r\n\r\nThis was the democratic, \"States' rights\" view of the subject. It\r\ndenied all exemptions from the supremacy of the laws, and it also\r\ndenied to the general Government any power to restrain a Commonwealth\r\nfrom the assertion of its jurisdiction over all persons within its\r\nlegal limits, except in cases specially reserved by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indian policy before Jackson.]\r\n\r\nThe Administration of Mr. Adams, and the Administrations of all of his\r\npredecessors, had apparently inclined to the view that the Indian\r\ntribes were already states, having dominion over, and property in, the\r\nterritory of the continent when the Europeans arrived upon it; that\r\nthe titles of the European states to it were only valid as against\r\neach other, and meant, in relation to the aborigines, only a right of\r\npre-emption; and that after the Constitution was established no\r\ngovernment except the general Government of the United States could\r\nhave anything to do with them.\r\n\r\nThis was a crude and an impracticable view of the relation. It\r\ncontained more of sentiment and humanitarianism than of common sense\r\nand inductive wisdom. The theory broke down completely in the Georgia\r\ncase, and could not be re-enlivened for practical purposes {218} even\r\nby judicial decisions. The necessities of civilization have forced the\r\ncountry to follow the course outlined by President Jackson, and that\r\nis certainly good evidence of its correctness.\r\n\r\nThe Georgians must have been encouraged by his message, for the\r\nlegislature of Georgia immediately passed an act connecting the\r\nCherokee lands with the counties which they adjoined, and imposing the\r\nfull jurisdiction of the Commonwealth upon all persons living or being\r\nwithin the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of the Cherokee Nation.]\r\n\r\nThe Indians then caused an original bill to be filed in the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States against Georgia, together with a\r\nsupplemental bill praying for a temporary injunction to restrain the\r\nCommonwealth from enforcing its jurisdiction, and for the issuing of a\r\nsubpoena to Georgia to appear before the Court. The Court issued its\r\nsummons, but the Commonwealth made no answer, and the Court decided,\r\nin its January term of 1831, that the Cherokee nation was not a\r\n\"State\" in the sense of that provision of the Constitution which\r\ndesignates the parties qualified to sue in the United States Courts.\r\nThis decision was pronounced immediately after the execution of the\r\nCherokee Tassells by the Georgia authorities, in defiance of a writ of\r\nerror addressed to the Commonwealth by a United States court,\r\nrequiring the Commonwealth to show cause why he should not be\r\ndischarged from custody. It is probable that the Supreme Court was\r\nimpressed by this demonstration of the impotence of the judiciary to\r\ninterfere successfully with the political policy of a Commonwealth,\r\neven in behalf of personal liberty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of Worcester against Georgia.]\r\n\r\nA year later the Court took a more national view and stand. A\r\nPresbyterian missionary to the Cherokees, the Rev. Samuel A.\r\nWorcester, of Vermont, had {219} violated the Georgia statute, which\r\nmade it a criminal offence to reside among the Cherokees after March\r\n1st, 1831, without a license from the Governor, and without having\r\ntaken an oath to support and defend the laws of the Commonwealth. He\r\nwas indicted and tried by a Georgia court, found guilty, and condemned\r\nto imprisonment in the penitentiary of the Commonwealth. A writ of\r\nerror was issued by one of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, requiring the Commonwealth of Georgia to show cause why\r\nthe prisoner should not be discharged. The writ was served on the\r\nGovernor and the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. The only answer\r\nwhich the Commonwealth gave to the summons was the sending up of the\r\nrecord of the case, signed by the clerk of the court which pronounced\r\nthe judgment, and authenticated by the seal of the court. The judge of\r\nthe Georgia court did not sign the record. Nevertheless the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States decided that the record of the Georgia\r\ncourt was properly before it, and the Chief Justice proceeded to make,\r\nin the Court's opinion of the case, an exhaustive review of the Indian\r\nrelations of the United States, in accord with the principles of the\r\nAdams Administration, and to pronounce the statute of Georgia,\r\nasserting the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth over the Cherokee lands\r\nand over all persons residing or being on them, unconstitutional,\r\nnull, and void, and the arrest, trial, and sentence of Mr. Worcester\r\nunder the same to have been, therefore, without warrant of law.\r\n\r\nBut the Georgia authorities paid no attention to the decision. They\r\ndid not liberate the prisoner or accord him a new trial. Later on, the\r\nGovernor of the Commonwealth pardoned him as his own act of grace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of the President to execute the decision in the\r\nWorcester case.]\r\n\r\nIt was certainly the duty of the President of the {220} United States\r\nto have executed this decision of the Court with all the power\r\nnecessary for the purpose which the Constitution conferred upon him.\r\nHe did not do it. It is said on very good authority that he intimated,\r\nat least, that he would not do it. The Commonwealth simply defied the\r\nCourt successfully, and the President and Congress acquiesced in the\r\nresult. The President agreed in opinion with the Georgians upon the\r\nsubject, and the doctrine which here triumphed was one more plank in\r\nthe platform of the Jacksonian democracy, a real \"States' rights\"\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson and Calhoun.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the South Carolinians were encouraged by the\r\ncourse of events in Georgia to believe that they would have something\r\nlike the same experiences and results in their contest with the\r\nGovernment. In this they do not seem to have fully realized the fact\r\nthat President Jackson did not agree with them in their view of the\r\nunconstitutionality of the tariff, as he agreed with the Georgians in\r\ntheir view of the Indian question. Moreover, there was a personal\r\nelement in the controversy which they do not seem to have appreciated\r\nat all. Jackson had, down to 1830, supposed that Mr. Crawford was the\r\nmember of the Cabinet of Mr. Monroe, in 1819, who wanted to have him\r\narrested and tried by a court-martial for disobeying orders, or acting\r\nin excess of orders, during the Seminole War, and that Mr. Calhoun was\r\nhis defender. Jackson's hatred of Crawford had been intense during\r\nthese years for this reason. In 1830 Governor Forsyth, of Georgia,\r\nrevealed to Jackson the truth in regard to this matter, which was that\r\nCalhoun was for arraigning him and Adams was his defender. Jackson\r\nimmediately demanded an explanation of Calhoun, but the reply did not\r\nat all satisfy him, and the hostility which he had {221} felt for\r\nCrawford was now turned with redoubled force against Calhoun. Calhoun\r\nwas now regarded by Jackson as a traitor to Jackson, and that meant,\r\nin Jackson's mind, that he was a traitor to his country. Any movement\r\nagainst the Government or the laws of the United States headed by\r\nCalhoun would be considered by Jackson as rebellion, most surely so\r\nwhile Jackson was President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The call of the Convention of 1832 in South Carolina.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the principles developed in Mr. Calhoun's letter of August\r\n28th, 1832, Governor Hamilton issued a call for a special session of\r\nthe legislature of South Carolina, in the autumn of 1832, for the\r\npurpose of effecting through it the assembly of the convention of the\r\nCommonwealth. The party in favor of nullification had at last secured\r\nboth branches of the legislature, and on October 24th, 1832, the\r\nassembled legislature voted to issue the call for the convention, and\r\nappointed November 19th as the day upon which it should meet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The work of the Nullification Convention.]\r\n\r\nThe convention assembled at the time designated, elected Governor\r\nHamilton as its chairman, and appointed a committee of twenty-one\r\nmembers to consider the situation and report a proposition to meet it.\r\nIn due time this committee made its report to the convention, in which\r\nwas contained, first, a review of the development of the tariff from a\r\nrevenue measure to a measure for the protection of manufactures, of\r\nthe ten years of fruitless struggle in Congress by the South against\r\nthe oppression inflicted by the protective system upon that section,\r\nand of the theories advanced by the fathers of the Republic for\r\nmeeting, in last instance, such a condition of affairs; and, second,\r\nthe famous Ordinance of Nullification as the remedy of last resort.\r\nThe convention voted to receive the report and to adopt its\r\nrecommendations. {222} On November 24th the convention passed, in\r\nsolemn form, the Ordinance of Nullification of the existing tariff\r\nlaws of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nullification Ordinance.]\r\n\r\nThe convention declared and ordained in this instrument, that \"the\r\nseveral acts and parts of acts of the Congress of the United States,\r\npurporting to be laws for the imposing of duties and imposts on the\r\nimportation of foreign commodities, and now having actual operation\r\nand effect within the United States, and, more especially,\" the Act of\r\nMay 19th, 1828, and that of July 14th, 1832, \"are unauthorized by the\r\nConstitution of the United States and violate the true meaning and\r\nintent thereof, and are null and void and no law, nor binding upon\r\nthis State, its officers or citizens; and all promises, contracts, and\r\nobligations made or entered into, or to be made or entered into, with\r\npurpose to secure the duties imposed by the said acts, and all\r\njudicial proceedings which shall be hereafter had in affirmance\r\nthereof, are and shall be held utterly null and void.\"\r\n\r\nIt further ordained that no appeal should be allowed from the\r\ndecisions of the courts of the Commonwealth to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States in questions involving the validity of the aforesaid\r\nActs of Congress, or of the Ordinance of the convention annulling\r\nthem, or of the acts of the legislature giving effect to the\r\nOrdinance, and that no copy of the proceedings in the courts of the\r\nCommonwealth should be allowed for any such purpose, but that the\r\ncourts of the Commonwealth should proceed to execute their decisions\r\nupon such issues without regard to any attempts to appeal therefrom,\r\nand should deal with any person making such attempt as being guilty of\r\ncontempt of court. It then commanded that all the officers of the\r\nCommonwealth, civil and military, and the jurors empanelled in the\r\ncourts should take the {223} oath to obey, execute, and enforce the\r\nOrdinance, under penalty of dismissal and disqualification; and\r\nfinally, it declared that South Carolina would regard her connection\r\nwith the Union as absolved, in case Congress should pass any act\r\nauthorizing the employment of military force to reduce her to\r\nobedience to the nullified acts, or any act abolishing or closing the\r\nports, or obstructing the free ingress and egress of vessels, or in\r\ncase the United States should undertake to coerce the Commonwealth, or\r\nenforce the nullified acts otherwise than through the civil tribunals\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nFor the execution of the provisions of the Ordinance the convention\r\ncommanded the legislature to pass such measures as would prevent the\r\nenforcement of the nullified acts, and give full effect to the\r\nnullifying Ordinance, from and after February 1st, 1833, and commanded\r\nthe obedience of all persons within the limits of the Commonwealth to\r\nthe Ordinance and the legislative acts passed for its execution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Addresses issued by the Convention.]\r\n\r\nWith the Ordinance the convention issued two addresses, one to the\r\npeople of South Carolina, and the other to the peoples of the other\r\nCommonwealths, naming each separately. The one to the people of South\r\nCarolina contained the theory of nullification, as elaborated by\r\nCalhoun, and the justification of its employment in the existing\r\nsituation. It closed with an appeal to their love of liberty and a\r\ndemand of obedience. The address to the peoples of the several\r\nCommonwealths contained an announcement of the passage of the\r\nnullifying Ordinance, the theory upon which it was based, an assertion\r\nof the unconstitutionality of the protective tariff, and its\r\noppression upon the people of South Carolina, and a declaration of the\r\nspirit and feeling of the convention, and of the people it\r\nrepresented, toward the Union, the {224} Constitution and the people\r\nof the manufacturing Commonwealths. The latter part of this address\r\ncontained the only new point to be noticed. It was the offer of a plan\r\nfor a compromise tariff which would satisfy the South Carolinians. The\r\nplan was the imposition of the same rate of duty upon all articles,\r\nthose not coming into competition with the products of the country and\r\nthose coming into such competition, and the raising of no more revenue\r\nthan should be necessary to meet the demands of the Government for\r\nconstitutional purposes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ordinance communicated to the Legislature of South\r\nCarolina.]\r\n\r\nIn a message of November 27th, Governor Hamilton communicated to the\r\nlegislature of the Commonwealth the Ordinance of Nullification and\r\nrecommended the enactment of measures by that body for the execution\r\nof the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nOn December 13th, the new Governor, Colonel Hayne, who had resigned\r\nhis seat in the Senate in order that Mr. Calhoun, who had himself\r\nresigned the vice-presidency, might be made South Carolina's\r\nrepresentative in the Senate, or, as the South Carolinians now\r\nconsidered it, South Carolina's ambassador to the Government of the\r\nUnited States, pronounced his inaugural address before the\r\nlegislature, dedicating himself to the service of the Commonwealth in\r\nthe execution of her Ordinance of Nullification.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Acts of the Legislature for the execution of the\r\nOrdinance.]\r\n\r\nThe legislature immediately passed the acts required by the convention\r\nand recommended by the Governor.\r\n\r\nThe first act, termed the Replevin Act, authorized any consignee of\r\nmerchandise, or any person lawfully entitled to the possession of\r\nmerchandise, held or detained for the payment of the duties imposed\r\nupon the same by the nullified Acts of Congress, to recover possession\r\nof the same, with {225} damages for its detention, by a writ of\r\nreplevin, that is, by a summary procedure executed by an officer of\r\nthe Commonwealth; and the Act authorized this officer, on initiation\r\nof the plaintiff in replevin, to seize the private property of the\r\nperson detaining the merchandise to double the value of the latter, in\r\ncase this person should refuse to deliver the detained merchandise to\r\nthe sheriff, or should put it out of the sheriff's way, and to hold\r\nthe property so seized until the merchandise in question should be\r\nproduced and delivered to the sheriff.\r\n\r\nThis Act also authorized any person paying the nullified duties to\r\nrecover the money paid, with interest on the same, by an action, in a\r\ncourt of the Commonwealth, for money had and received; and it\r\nauthorized any person suffering arrest or imprisonment by order of any\r\nUnited States court, in execution of the nullified Acts, to demand the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and to maintain an action for\r\nunlawful arrest and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIt declared the sale of any property seized by a United States court,\r\nin execution of the nullified Acts, to be illegal, and ordained that\r\nsuch sale should convey no title to the purchaser. It forbade any\r\nofficer of a court of the Commonwealth to furnish the record, or a\r\ncopy of the record, or allow a copy of the record to be taken, of any\r\ncase in which the validity of the nullified Acts or the nullifying\r\nActs should be drawn in question, under penalty of both fine and\r\nimprisonment, and it forbade any person to attempt to recapture the\r\ngoods delivered by the sheriff to the plaintiff in replevin, under\r\nthreat of the same punishment.\r\n\r\nIt further forbade the keepers of the jails to receive and detain any\r\nperson arrested or committed by virtue of any proceeding for enforcing\r\nthe nullified Acts, under penalty of both fine and imprisonment; and\r\nit imposed {226} a similar penalty upon the offence of hiring,\r\nletting, or procuring any place to be used as a place of confinement\r\nfor such person.\r\n\r\nFinally, it forbade any person to disobey, obstruct, prevent, or\r\nresist any process allowed by this Act, under penalty of both fine and\r\nimprisonment; and it threatened every plaintiff, who should bring suit\r\nagainst any officer or person executing or aiding in the execution of\r\nthe provisions of this Act, with adverse judgment and double costs.\r\n\r\nThe second Act of the legislature was a measure to provide for the\r\nevent of the employment of military power by the general Government to\r\nenforce the nullified Acts in South Carolina. It authorized the\r\nGovernor of the Commonwealth to resist the same; and for this purpose\r\nto order into service the whole military power of the Commonwealth at\r\nhis discretion, to purchase arms, accoutrements, and ammunitions, and\r\nto appoint his military staff; and it authorized and obligated the\r\nGovernor to use military power in suppressing opposition to the laws\r\nof the Commonwealth by combinations too powerful to be controlled by\r\nthe civil officers.\r\n\r\nThe third Act was the test oath, the oath to obey, execute, and\r\nenforce the Ordinance of Nullification, and all the acts of the\r\nlegislature for its enforcement, which every officer of the\r\nCommonwealth must take before dealing with any question touching the\r\nnullified Acts or the nullifying Acts, and which the Governor might\r\nrequire of any officer whatever.\r\n\r\nThese were the details and the forms of the issue which South Carolina\r\nnow offered to the United States. Was it rebellion, or was it\r\nconstitutional and legal opposition?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The meaning of Nullification as understood by the\r\nNullifiers.]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Calhoun and the members of the {227} nullifying\r\nconvention held it to be the latter. They argued that the reserved\r\npowers of the Commonwealths are recognized by the Constitution; that\r\nevery conceivable power is reserved to the Commonwealths, except such\r\nas are vested by the Constitution in the general Government\r\nexclusively, or are denied by the Constitution to the Commonwealths;\r\nthat the power to pronounce an act of the general Government null and\r\nvoid had been neither so vested nor so denied; that this was,\r\ntherefore, a reserved power of the Commonwealths, and was, like all\r\nother reserved powers, a constitutional power; that South Carolina\r\nproposed to use this power through judicial means only, which means\r\nwere legally and constitutionally at her disposal through the\r\nprinciple of the governmental system of the United States that general\r\ncriminal jurisdiction belongs exclusively to the Commonwealths; and\r\nthat the employment of military power by the Commonwealth, indicated\r\nin the Ordinance and the legislative acts for its enforcement, was to\r\nbe resorted to only in self-defence, only to repel the possible attack\r\nof the military power of the general Government upon South Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely evident that the South Carolina statesmen and lawyers\r\nthought they had so fashioned the laws of the Commonwealth as to force\r\nthe general Government to the first violation of legal order in\r\nattempting to execute the nullified Acts of Congress--that is, they\r\nthought they had made it impossible for the general Government to\r\nexecute these Acts by regular legal methods; and that they had done so\r\nwithout themselves violating any rule or principle of American\r\njurisprudence. They repeated the assertion, again and again, that they\r\ndid not rest their case on moral, or on revolutionary, principles, but\r\non strict constitutional {228} right; and it is impossible to prove\r\nthat they were insincere.\r\n\r\nThe great question now was, what attitude the general Government would\r\ntake toward the attempt of a Commonwealth to defeat the supremacy of\r\nits laws. Naturally the Executive Department must act first, since\r\nnullification was directed against the execution of existing laws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's view of Nullification.]\r\n\r\nIn his message of December 4th (1832), President Jackson referred\r\nbriefly to the events of the preceding month in South Carolina, but\r\ndid not seem to have fully appreciated their purport. He said he hoped\r\nthe United States courts would be able to cope successfully with the\r\ndifficulties in South Carolina, and that, if they were not, he thought\r\nthat the existing laws gave the President sufficient power to suppress\r\nany attempts which might be immediately made against the supremacy of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tariff in the Annual Message of 1832.]\r\n\r\nHe devoted a much larger portion of the message to a consideration of\r\nthe tariff, and declared that the time had arrived for the United\r\nStates to enter upon the realization of the policy of a tariff for\r\nrevenue only, and of the ultimate limitation of protection to those\r\narticles of domestic manufacture indispensable to the country in time\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the President did, after all, understand the\r\nserious nature of the situation from the outset, and hoped, by his\r\npronounced recommendations in regard to the tariff, and his very mild\r\nutterances concerning nullification, to influence the South\r\nCarolinians to a reconsideration of their hasty acts, and give them a\r\nloophole of escape from their very dubious and embarrassing position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's Proclamation of December 10th.]\r\n\r\nHe waited for six days, and then issued the noted proclamation of\r\nDecember 10th, which presented the {229} President's idea of the\r\nrelation of the United States, as a nation, and of the general\r\nGovernment, to the Commonwealths, asserted the supremacy of United\r\nStates law over Commonwealth law, demonstrated the true character of\r\nnullification as rebellion, and declared the President's intention to\r\nexecute the laws of the United States against any and all opposition.\r\n\r\nThe President assumed as his cardinal principle that the Union\r\npreceded independence, and that by a joint act the people of the\r\nunited colonies declared themselves a nation; that, as a nation, the\r\npeople of the United States established the Constitution of 1787, and\r\nplaced in that instrument the provision that the Constitution, and the\r\nlaws and treaties made in accordance therewith, are \"the supreme law\"\r\nof the land, and that \"the judges in every State shall be bound\r\nthereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.\" From these principles the President derived\r\nthe conclusions that no legal processes, which South Carolina could\r\ncontrive, could prevent the execution of the laws of the United States\r\nin South Carolina; that to accomplish this South Carolina would be\r\nobliged to have recourse to violence; and that this necessity stamped\r\nnullification as rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe President stopped the loophole of escape from this reasoning, made\r\nby the claim of the nullifiers that the nullified Acts were not laws\r\nmade in accordance with the Constitution, by the declaration that the\r\nJudicial Department of the general Government was the body designated\r\nby the Constitution to determine that question, and not a Commonwealth\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nAfter warning the nullifiers to desist from their unlawful enterprise,\r\nthe President closed his message with an eloquent appeal to the people\r\nof South Carolina to {230} withdraw from their unjustifiable and\r\ndangerous position, and an equally eloquent appeal to the people of\r\nthe United States for aid and support in preserving the Union and\r\nmaintaining the supremacy of the Government and the laws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's military preparations.]\r\n\r\nAlready before the passage of the Ordinance of Nullification, the\r\nPresident had caused the United States military officers stationed in\r\nand about Charleston to be informed of their danger, had ordered two\r\nartillery companies from Fort Monroe to Fort Moultrie, had commanded\r\nGeneral Scott to go to Charleston and do what might be necessary for a\r\nsuccessful defence of the forts and places held by the Army of the\r\nUnited States, and had directed all the officers in command to defend\r\ntheir possession of these forts and places to the last extremity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's instructions to the customs officers in\r\nSouth Carolina.]\r\n\r\nThe President had also caused the collectors of the customs at\r\nCharleston, Georgetown, and Beaufort to be reminded of their powers\r\nunder the laws of the United States, and had authorized them to make\r\nuse of all the revenue cutters in the harbors, and of such other\r\nvessels as they could secure, and to call to their assistance the\r\nofficers of the cutters, and to appoint a number of inspectors\r\nsufficient to execute successfully the laws of the United States for\r\nthe collection of the duties. The collector at Charleston was\r\nspecially authorized to remove the custom-house to Castle Pinckney, at\r\nhis discretion; and the United States District Attorney at Charleston\r\nwas ordered to aid the collector with counsel and advice.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the Ordinance, the President ordered five more\r\ncompanies of artillery from Fort Monroe to Fort Moultrie, commanded\r\nthe removal of the custom-house from Charleston to Castle Pinckney,\r\nand sent General Scott to Charleston Harbor to take command, {231} on\r\nthe spot, of all the forts and garrisons there, instructing him to\r\navoid collision with the forces of the Commonwealth so long as\r\npossible, but, in case the exigency should arise requiring the\r\nexercise of military power, to act with firmness and decision, and to\r\nhold possession of the forts by all means and at every hazard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The popular approval of the President's course.]\r\n\r\nThe brave, loyal, and patriotic, yet wise and considerate, stand taken\r\nby the President was supported with great unanimity and enthusiasm\r\nthroughout the North; and though the people of the Southern\r\nCommonwealths felt more sympathy with their South Carolina brethren,\r\nyet the dissent from the President's views and attitude in that\r\nsection was rare and feeble. The nation was with the President, and\r\nthe President had done his duty nobly and fearlessly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Verplanck Tariff Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe turn now came upon Congress. Would Congress sustain the President,\r\nand give him all the means necessary to conquer nullification and\r\nsecession in fact, and destroy them in principle? Unfortunately, so\r\nfar as finite reason can judge, the first movements made in Congress\r\nwere in the opposite direction. That part of the President's message\r\nwhich dealt with the question of the tariff was referred by the House\r\nof Representatives to its committee on Ways and Means, and on December\r\n27th, 1832, the chairman of that committee, Mr. Verplanck, of New\r\nYork, reported a bill from the committee which proposed to reduce and\r\nequalize duties largely, and in the direction of the South Carolina\r\nprinciple. If this bill should pass, the nullifiers could well assume\r\nthat their Ordinance had accomplished its purpose without being\r\napplied, and could with triumphant dignity desist from the application\r\nof it; and they could defer with almost equal dignity the application\r\nof the Ordinance, {232} so long as there was any probability of the\r\npassage of this bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Governor Hayne's Counter-proclamation.]\r\n\r\nSeven days before the introduction of this bill, Governor Hayne had\r\nissued a counter-proclamation to the President's proclamation of\r\nDecember 10th, in which he went over again the ground of nullification\r\nand secession, warned the citizens of South Carolina against the\r\nPresident's \"pernicious\" doctrines, and accused the President of\r\nindulging in unwarrantable imputations upon South Carolina. He gave\r\nnotice, on the same day, that he would accept the service of\r\nvolunteers. The legislature supported the Governor in defiant\r\nresolutions, which it sent to Congress, and caused to be read in that\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's Message of January 16th, 1833.]\r\n\r\nThe President was much ruffled by the arrogant language of the\r\nGovernor and legislature, and when the Verplanck bill appeared, it\r\nmust have looked to him too much like surrendering the entire field,\r\nwhich he was not now in any mood to do. He felt that something more\r\nmust be done to vindicate the authority and the dignity of the\r\nGovernment. On January 16th, 1833, he sent another message to\r\nCongress, demonstrating and denouncing again the pernicious character\r\nof the nullification doctrine, informing Congress that he had removed\r\nthe custom-house from Charleston to Castle Pinckney, and asking\r\nCongress for the power to change the customs districts and ports of\r\nentry, to exact the payment of duties in cash, and to use the land and\r\nnaval forces when necessary for the execution of the revenue laws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calhoun's explanations in the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe message was referred by the Houses of Congress to their respective\r\ncommittees on the Judiciary; but immediately upon the reading of the\r\nmessage, and before the Senate had passed the motion to refer, Mr.\r\nCalhoun said, in that body, that there was no foundation whatever for\r\nthe {233} statement in the message that the movements made by South\r\nCarolina were intended as hostile to the Union, or were so. He called\r\nthe attention of the Senate to the fact that before the Ordinance of\r\nNullification was passed, before the convention had assembled, United\r\nStates troops had been sent to Charleston Harbor; and he declared\r\nthat, previous to this circumstance, South Carolina had looked to\r\nnothing beyond a civil process, and had intended to give effect to her\r\nopposition merely in the form of a suit at law, and that it was only\r\nwhen a military force had been displayed on her borders, and in her\r\nlimits, and when a menace was thrown out against the lives of her\r\ncitizens, that they found themselves driven to an attitude of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Force Bill.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of the month (January), Mr. Wilkins, the chairman of the\r\nJudiciary committee of the Senate, reported from his committee the\r\nbill for the collection of the revenue. This bill provided for\r\nextending the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the United States\r\nover all cases in law or equity arising under the revenue laws of the\r\nUnited States; for making all property taken or detained by any\r\nofficer or person under authority of any law of the United States\r\nirrepleviable by any order or process of the tribunals of a\r\nCommonwealth; for effecting the removal of suits commenced in a\r\nCommonwealth court against any officer or person for any act done\r\nunder the laws of the United States, or on account of any right,\r\nauthority, or title claimed under those laws, to the Circuit Courts of\r\nthe United States, by means of proof laid before the Circuit Court\r\nthat the defendant had petitioned the Commonwealth court for the\r\nremoval of the cause. The bill provided, further, for substituting for\r\na copy of the record of the proceedings in the {234} Commonwealth\r\ncourt, in case of the failure of that court to furnish a copy, an\r\naffidavit, or other evidence, as the circumstances of the case might\r\nrequire; for giving to the United States judges the power to grant\r\nwrits of habeas corpus in all cases where persons were in confinement\r\nfor acts done in pursuance of a law of the United States, or of an\r\norder, process, or decree of any United States court or judge; for\r\nempowering the United States marshals, under direction of the United\r\nStates judges, to provide places of confinement for persons arrested\r\nor committed under the laws of the United States, where any\r\nCommonwealth should refuse the use of its jails for the confinement of\r\nsuch persons; for allowing the President to change the custom-house\r\nfrom one place in a collection district to another, and to require the\r\nduties to be paid in cash; and for empowering the President to use the\r\nland and naval forces for suppressing any resistance to the execution\r\nof the revenue laws too powerful to be overcome by the civil officers\r\nof the general Government.\r\n\r\nIt was a good, stiff measure, but it was constitutional at every\r\npoint, and it was demanded by the exigencies of the situation. It was\r\na complete answer to the Replevin Act of South Carolina, and it would\r\ninevitably throw the responsibility for committing the first act of\r\nviolence upon the Commonwealth in any resistance to the collection of\r\nthe duties. It pricked the bubble completely of South Carolina's\r\nproposed legal resistance to the execution of the laws of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOf course the bill was denounced at once by the South Carolinians as a\r\n\"Force Bill.\" Calhoun attacked it as a measure for coercing a\r\nsovereign \"State,\" and offered a series of \"States' rights\"\r\npropositions, which he declared to be indisputable, and which must,\r\ntherefore, prevent the passage of the bill. The discussion upon {235}\r\nthese resolutions, and upon the bill which they were meant to destroy,\r\ndragged on from day to day in the Senate, while that upon the\r\nVerplanck bill in the House proceeded even more slowly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The postponement of the execution of nullification.]\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of the nullifiers, professing to feel that the Government\r\nwas yielding, reassembled in convention in the last days of January,\r\nand postponed the execution of their Ordinance until the end of the\r\nexisting Congressional session.\r\n\r\nOn February 8th, Mr. Bell, the chairman of the Judiciary committee of\r\nthe House of Representatives, reported to that body that his committee\r\ndid not recommend vesting the President with any further powers for\r\nthe execution of the revenue laws than those already possessed by him,\r\nand that they could not approve of the employment of military force\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Compromise Tariff.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when, on February 12th, Mr. Clay astonished the\r\nSenate with the noted proposition for compromise. This was his bill\r\nfor the gradual reduction of the duties to a revenue basis. The\r\nrevenue basis was fixed in the bill at twenty per centum _ad valorem_\r\non all articles then paying a higher duty, and the excess was to be\r\nremitted in biennial instalments, and entirely abolished from and\r\nafter June 30th, 1842. The free list was slightly extended, and cash\r\npayments, from and after June 30th, 1842, were provided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Clay on the situation.]\r\n\r\nMr. Clay said, in introducing this bill, that he had two purposes in\r\nview: one to save what could be saved of the protective tariff, and\r\nthe other to allow South Carolina to withdraw with dignity from the\r\nposition which she had rashly assumed. He claimed that his feeling\r\ntoward the action of South Carolina had changed since her\r\nRepresentatives and Senators in Congress had disavowed rebellion and\r\nhad {236} asserted that they were only trying to invent legal methods\r\nfor protecting themselves against the oppression of the tariff Acts.\r\nHe demonstrated very clearly the error of supposing that they could do\r\nany such thing, and then urged his brother Senators to join him in the\r\nproposed measure of conciliation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Calhoun's support of Mr. Clay's bill.]\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun immediately indicated that the bill would have his\r\nsupport, and would solve the difficulties between South Carolina and\r\nthe general Government. He professed to see in it the concession of\r\nabout all that South Carolina had asked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The opposition to the bill.]\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the bill came from three quarters--from the\r\nprotectionists, who clung to the existing law, from the strong\r\nnationalists, who were against any show of compromise with\r\nnullification, and from the strict parliamentarians, who held that any\r\nbill touching the tariff must originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe protectionists were answered, and many of them won over, by the\r\nargument that the Verplanck bill would pass if they did not accept Mr.\r\nClay's bill. The strong nationalists were told that if Congress should\r\npass the Wilkins bill before the Clay bill a sufficient vindication of\r\ntheir position would be attained. They were inclined to accept that\r\nview, but the South Carolinians set themselves against this order of\r\nprocedure with all their strength. Mr. Calhoun came forward again with\r\nhis \"States' sovereignty\" exposition of the Constitution, and\r\ndenounced the Wilkins bill in the most vehement language as \"utterly\r\nunconstitutional, as an attempt to enforce robbery by murder, an\r\nattempt to decree the massacre of the citizens of South Carolina,\" and\r\ndeclared that the citizens of South Carolina would, should it become\r\nlaw, resist its execution \"at every hazard, even that of death\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\n{237} [Sidenote: Passage of the \"Force Bill\" by the Senate.]\r\n\r\nOn the following day Mr. Webster answered Mr. Calhoun's argument, and\r\ndemonstrated so clearly the nationality of the Constitution, the\r\nsupremacy of the laws of the United States, and the rebellious\r\ncharacter of nullification, that the Senate was convinced of the\r\nnecessity of passing the Wilkins bill before voting upon Mr. Clay's\r\nbill. On the 20th of the month (February), the Senate passed the\r\nWilkins bill by a vote of thirty-two to one. The objections of the\r\nstrong nationalists to Mr. Clay's bill were now substantially\r\nsatisfied; but the high protectionists still held out in considerable\r\nnumber for some modification of the bill in their favor, and on the\r\nday after the passage of the Wilkins bill by the Senate, Mr. Clay\r\nmoved to amend his own bill by the proposition to base the duties on\r\nhome valuation instead of on the foreign invoice. The protectionists\r\nwere satisfied by this, but Mr. Calhoun immediately declared that\r\nSouth Carolina would not accept the bill with this change. The\r\nprotectionists, in sufficient number to defeat the bill, declared that\r\nthey would not accept it without the change. Mr. Calhoun had at last\r\ncome to see the peril which lay in South Carolina's course, and to\r\nunderstand the feeling of the nation toward her. He wisely concluded\r\nto abandon his opposition to the amendment, and to vote for the bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the Compromise Tariff bill and the \"Force Bill\"\r\nby Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the strict parliamentarians, on the ground that the\r\nSenate could not originate a revenue bill, was overcome by the action\r\nof the House of Representatives in substituting the Clay bill for the\r\nVerplanck bill, and passing it on the 26th, and sending it to the\r\nSenate for concurrence. The Senate now passed the House bill on March\r\n1st, and the House immediately passed the Wilkins bill, against the\r\nprotest of {238} the South Carolinians that it could now have no\r\npurpose since every member of Congress from South Carolina had voted\r\nfor the new Tariff Act.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nullification ordinance withdrawn.]\r\n\r\nThe President signed both bills at the same time, March 2nd, and South\r\nCarolina rescinded the Nullification Ordinance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Motives and general results.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to see what principles or what party finally triumphed\r\nin this contest, or to comprehend all the motives of the chief actors\r\nin it. It has been said, or hinted, that Mr. Calhoun, chagrined and\r\ndisappointed at not gaining the presidency in 1832, was induced to\r\ntake the course which he followed in reference to nullification by the\r\nhope of breaking up the Union and winning, thus, the presidency of a\r\nSouthern confederacy; that President Jackson was largely influenced,\r\nin the decided attitude which he assumed, by the desire to take\r\nrevenge on Mr. Calhoun and South Carolina for Mr. Calhoun's attempt to\r\ncourt-martial him more than a dozen years before, and for South\r\nCarolina's slight upon him in the election of 1832; and that Mr. Clay\r\nwas moved far more by his jealousy of President Jackson, and his fear\r\nof trusting him with extraordinary powers, than by any dread of the\r\ndestruction of the Union.\r\n\r\nThere is probably some truth in certain, if not in all, of these\r\nspeculations, but such things are not the matters of chief value in\r\nthe search for the line of development of the constitutional history\r\nof this country. They do indeed help us to appreciate the motives for\r\nthe particular form of adjustment put upon that development at any\r\nstage of its course; but our chief concern must be with the advance or\r\nretrogression in principle of that development, our question must be\r\nwhether the Union and the Constitution were strengthened or weakened\r\nby {239} the events of 1832 and 1833, whether the political\r\nnationality of the country was cemented or suffered disintegration,\r\nand whether strength was gathered, or the seeds of weakness were sown,\r\nin the results attained.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the present, a point so much more national\r\nthan any reached before 1860, the settlement of 1833 is usually\r\nregarded as a great misfortune, as a fateful error, which led the\r\ncountry finally into civil war. It is now usually said that the\r\nnational cause lost everything in principle, and that nullification\r\nwas virtually acknowledged by the Act of Congress in repealing the\r\nnullified laws, at the same moment that it enacted the measure for\r\nupholding the supremacy of the laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nFrom a purely historical view of the development of the constitutional\r\nlaw of the country, this proposition does not seem to be true, at\r\nleast not without great modification. From such a point of view it\r\nseems more correct to say, that the doctrine formulated by Mr. Calhoun\r\nand his colleagues in South Carolina was only the exact logical\r\nstatement of the principles advanced by Mr. Jefferson in 1798,\r\nprinciples through the advocacy of which Mr. Jefferson and the\r\nRepublicans turned the Federalists out of power and captured the\r\nGovernment; that under the pressure of foreign war and through its\r\nresults, the Republican practice in administering the Government had\r\nbeen driven into lines almost, if not quite, contradictory to the\r\nRepublican doctrine; that in the gradual relapse, after 1815, into the\r\nhumdrum of peace and business, the conditions were being revived for\r\nthe reassertion of the principles of 1800; and that, under such\r\nconditions and in such a period, the doctrines advanced by President\r\nJackson, doctrines of a far more completely national system of\r\nsovereignty, government, and liberty than were ever expressed {240} by\r\nany preceding President, certainly mark a great advance in the\r\ndevelopment of the national theory of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolinians said that John Quincy Adams invented these\r\ndoctrines, and that Jackson first essayed their application. Even Clay\r\ndeclared that they were an advance upon his own views. And some of\r\nJackson's friends undertook, it was said with authority from Jackson\r\nhimself, to explain them away, so startled were they by their strong\r\nnationalism.\r\n\r\nBut the spoken word cannot be recalled. It had gone forth, and the\r\nnation had approved it. The politicians might split hairs in its\r\ninterpretation, but the people had heard from the highest authority\r\nwhich they recognized that the United States was a sovereign nation,\r\nand that the attempt of any combination of persons, whether calling\r\nthemselves a \"State\" or not, to resist by violence the execution of\r\nthe laws of the United States, or to withdraw themselves from their\r\noperation, was rebellion, which the President was empowered and\r\nrequired by the Constitution to suppress with the whole physical power\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nAnd besides the Proclamation there was the \"Force Bill,\" which rested\r\nupon the same theory of the political system of the country as the\r\nProclamation. The Congress as well as the President was now\r\ninculcating the national doctrine. Calhoun and his friends knew what\r\nan influence this would exert. He said that he and they would never\r\nrest content until this measure was expunged from among the Acts of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the passage of the new Tariff Act appeared to take the\r\nvirtue out of the Proclamation and the \"Force Bill;\" but it is not at\r\nall probable that the nullifiers would have retreated from their\r\nground so promptly, to say the least, except for the determined {241}\r\nwords of the President and the Congress, and the popular approval with\r\nwhich they were received; and it is almost certain that, when it came\r\nto the great crisis, twenty-eight years later, the people would not\r\nhave understood and supported the great principle that the general\r\nGovernment has the right of self-preservation, in the exercise of all\r\nits powers, throughout the whole territory of the Union, against\r\neverything and everybody but the sovereign nation itself, except for\r\nthe great education in national principles which they received from\r\nthe Proclamation, and through the enactment of the law which gave the\r\nsanction of Congress to the enforcement of its principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{242}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nABOLITION\r\n\r\nThe Philosophy of Abolition--William Lloyd Garrison--The Civil Status\r\nunder the Constitution of 1787--Points at which Slavery Could be\r\nLegally Attacked--Garrison's Methods--The Southampton Massacre--The\r\nAttempt to Suppress the Abolition Movement at the North--Growth of the\r\nAbolition Movement--The Methods of the Moderate Abolitionists--The\r\nAbolition Petitions--The Earlier Method of Dealing with the\r\nPetitions--Beginning of the Conflict over the Abolition Petitions--The\r\nNew Method for Dealing with Petitions in the House of\r\nRepresentatives--True View of the Right of Petition--Mr. Polk's Fatal\r\nError in Regard to the Right of Petition--The Pinckney\r\nResolutions--The New Rule of the House of Representatives in Regard to\r\nthe Abolition Petitions--The Increase of Petitions, and the\r\nDenunciation of the Pinckney Rule--The Final Denial of the Right of\r\nPetition on the Subject of Slavery by the House of\r\nRepresentatives--The Abolition Petitions in the Senate--Mr. Rives and\r\nMr. Calhoun in Regard to the Morality of Slavery--Mr. Calhoun's\r\nResolutions in Regard to the Political Relations of Slavery--The\r\nAnti-Slavery Petition from the Vermont Legislature--The Abolition\r\nDocuments and the United States Mails--The Postmaster-General's Ruling\r\nin Regard to the Abolition Documents in the Mails--Jackson on the Use\r\nof the Mails by the Abolitionists--Mr. Calhoun's Report and Bill on\r\nthe Subject--Clay's Criticism of Calhoun's Proposition--The Act of\r\nCongress Protecting the Abolition Documents in the Mails--General\r\nResults of the Struggle over the Right of Petition and the Freedom of\r\nthe Mails.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ends of the state.]\r\n\r\nWhen a state has fairly accomplished the primal end of establishing\r\nits governmental system, its {243} public policy will be found to be\r\npursuing, in ultimate generalization, two great all-comprehending\r\npurposes, namely, national development and universal human progress.\r\nRarely, if ever, will any state be found to have succeeded in so\r\nbalancing these two principal objects of its public policy as to make\r\nthe resultant of its two main lines of progress follow an unchanging\r\nangle. At one period, the principle of national development will\r\nprevail, even to the point of national exclusiveness; at another, an\r\nenthusiastic humanism will almost threaten the existence of national\r\ndistinctions. But in all the convulsions of political history,\r\ndescribed as advance and reaction, the scientific student of history\r\nis able to discover that the zigzags of progress are ever bearing in\r\nthe general direction which the combined impulses toward nationalism\r\nand humanism compel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The purposes of the state, as seen in the history of the\r\nUnited States.]\r\n\r\nAfter the humanitarian outburst of the revolutionary period in the\r\nlatter part of the eighteenth century had expended its force, the\r\nstates of the world veered in their policies toward the line of\r\nnational development. The United States, which had been excessively\r\nhumanitarian during that period, both in its doctrine of rights and in\r\nits policy, became, in the succeeding period, the first three decades\r\nof the nineteenth century, more and more national in disposition and\r\nin practice, until industrial exclusiveness and race domination\r\nappeared, at the close of the period, to be the sole principles of the\r\npolicy of the country.\r\n\r\nHad the two elements of this policy been equally, or almost equally,\r\nsustained throughout the whole country, there is little question that\r\nthe human purpose, the world-purpose, as Hegel calls it, of state\r\nexistence, would have been ignored to a higher degree, and for a {244}\r\nlonger period, than it was. But curiously and fortunately, the race\r\ndomination in the South produced economic conditions which demanded\r\ntrade and commerce with the world, and which finally forced upon the\r\nNorth the conviction that the cause of those conditions--race\r\ndomination, slavery--must be removed, in order to secure the\r\nindustrial interests of the North against the competition of the\r\nworld's markets. The destruction of that domination must proceed,\r\nhowever, upon a humanitarian principle, namely, the right of man to\r\npersonal liberty. Thus it clearly appears that the two elements of the\r\nnational exclusiveness of the United States in 1830 were, in the\r\npeculiar relation which finally obtained between them, preparing the\r\nnation for a new advance in the direction of world intercourse and\r\nhuman rights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Revolution of 1830.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1830 the wave of revolution rolled again over Europe.\r\nThe rights of man, the brotherhood of man, and the sovereignty of the\r\npeople, were the principles which pressed again to the front. While no\r\nactual connection can be established between the Revolution of 1830 in\r\nEurope and the rise of Abolition in the United States, yet they belong\r\nto the same period of time, and harmonize in principle. The impulses\r\nwhich move the human race, or those parts of the human race which\r\nstand upon the same plane of civilization, are not broken by mountain\r\nheights or broad seas. Their manifestations appear spontaneously and\r\ncoetaneously in widely separated places.\r\n\r\nBefore 1830, indeed, as we have so often seen, slavery in the United\r\nStates had been regarded as a grievous evil by most of the great\r\nspirits of the age and country, and schemes for gradual emancipation\r\nhad been invented, and, in some slight degree, had been put into {245}\r\noperation. It was, however, the humanitarian outburst of 1830, and the\r\nsucceeding years, which represented slavery as a sin and a crime\r\nagainst the universal principle of human liberty and the rights of\r\nman, a sin which called for immediate expiation by instantaneous,\r\nunqualified, and uncompensated abolition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The philosophy of Abolition.]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing strange about the philosophy of Abolition. It is\r\nsimply the idealistic view of the beginning and the progress of human\r\nhistory. It assumes liberty as the original state of man, condemns\r\nevery species of modification of liberty suffered by any human being,\r\nor any class of human beings, as resulting from the unrighteous act of\r\nsome other human being, or class or race of human beings, and demands\r\nthe immediate discontinuance of the tyranny as the only approximately\r\nadequate satisfaction which can be made to those who have suffered\r\nthat tyranny. It is the orthodox, paradisaical view of the origin,\r\nunity, and primal perfection of the human race. It is the literal\r\ninterpretation of the Declaration of Independence. It is\r\nthorough-going, radical humanitarianism. Its political principle, in\r\nthe language of its chief exponent, was: \"The world our country, and\r\nall mankind our countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nOver against it stands the pessimistic view of man and of\r\ncivilization, which divides the human race into the few intelligent\r\nand good, and the great mass of the ignorant and vicious, and\r\nconsiders the permanent subjection of the latter to the former as the\r\ndivinely constituted, and therefore the permanent, order of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd between the two lies the true historical view, which regards\r\nliberty, equality, and brotherhood as the products of civilization, as\r\nthe final, not the primal, status of the human race, and determines\r\nthe character of every stage of development from barbarism to {246}\r\ncivilization, not by its distance from the perfect condition, but by\r\nthe fact of its advance upon, or its retrogression from, the stage\r\nimmediately antecedent.\r\n\r\nThe latter is, unquestionably, the true philosophy of history, but the\r\nformer has its uses as well as its abuses. It contains those forces of\r\nmystical enthusiasm, self-sacrifice, and reckless disregard of\r\nconsequences so necessary, at times, to drag the world out of the ruts\r\nof materialism and the love of peace. Such was its mission in the\r\nfourth decade of the nineteenth century in American history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Lloyd Garrison.]\r\n\r\nIf we must give a name, a date, and a place to the first open\r\nappearance of a movement which was a product of the age, that name is\r\nGarrison; the date, the beginning of the year 1831; and the place,\r\nBoston. The character of William Lloyd Garrison, whether noble or\r\nvulgar; his purposes, whether generous or selfish; and the motives\r\nwhich impelled him, whether narrow and personal or grandly humane, are\r\nnot subjects for treatment in a work upon constitutional history.\r\nConstitutional history has to do only with the doctrines of political\r\nethics and public jurisprudence which he formulated, and with the\r\nmeans proposed by him, and those who thought and acted with him, for\r\ntheir realization; and the historian does neither him nor them any\r\ninjustice in saying that, while those doctrines are to be justified\r\nfrom the point of view of an extreme idealism, the means for their\r\nrealization, at first only indicated, but later boldly and rudely\r\nexpressed, were revolutionary, almost anarchic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The civil status under the Constitution of 1787.]\r\n\r\nThere is now certainly little question that the determination of the\r\ncivil status of all persons is, from an ethical point of view, a\r\nmatter of national concern, and that that status must be fixed, in\r\ngeneral principle, by a national act. There is just as little question\r\nthat {247} the denial of personal liberty to any human being of adult\r\nyears does not comport with the civilization of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In espousing these principles the Abolitionists were only\r\nprophets ahead of their time, and must be accorded the honor which\r\nbelongs to such. On the other hand, it is entirely unquestionable that\r\nthe Constitution of the United States recognized to the Commonwealths,\r\nrespectively, the exclusive control of the civil status of persons\r\nbelonging within their several jurisdictions, and it is entirely\r\nimprobable that the Constitution of 1787 could ever have been\r\nestablished without the guarantees, expressed and implied in it, of\r\nsuch power to the Commonwealths. There is no question at all that the\r\nslavery or freedom of the negro race within the several Commonwealths\r\nwas, under the Constitution of 1787, not only left, as it had been\r\nbefore, a matter for each Commonwealth to determine for itself, but\r\nthat the exclusive power of determination in regard to it was\r\nguaranteed by the Constitution to the several Commonwealths. The\r\nCommonwealths in which slaveholding generally and extensively\r\nprevailed regarded the guarantee as the principal consideration for\r\ntheir assent to the \"compact.\" The attempt to violate, or weaken, or\r\neven to cast doubt upon, these guarantees appeared to them to be an\r\nattack upon the fundamental covenants of the Union. The Constitution\r\nmight, indeed, be so amended as to withdraw these powers and\r\nguarantees from the Commonwealths, by the regular procedure provided\r\nin the Constitution itself; and the general Government was vested by\r\nthe Constitution with the general powers of exclusive government in\r\nthe Territories, the District of Columbia, and the places owned by the\r\nUnited States within Commonwealths and used by the general Government\r\nfor {248} governmental purposes. But so long as the Constitution\r\nremained what it was, there was no constitutional power in the general\r\nGovernment to attack slavery in the Commonwealths; and the\r\nslaveholders could certainly claim that, in the exercise of its powers\r\nin the Territories, the District, and other places where those powers\r\nwere exclusive, the general Government should act fairly toward all\r\nthe members of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Points at which slavery could be legally attacked.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Garrison's methods.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, here were legal points of attack for the Abolitionists.\r\nThey might memorialize Congress for the abolition of slavery in the\r\nTerritories and in the District, and for the initiation of an\r\namendment which would abolish slavery in the Commonwealths or would\r\ngive Congress the power to do so, and they might appeal to the\r\nlegislatures of the Commonwealths to demand of Congress the calling of\r\na constitutional convention of the United States to initiate such an\r\namendment. But Garrison would have nothing to do with the\r\nConstitution, or with existing legal methods. He denounced the\r\nConstitution, \"as a covenant with death and an agreement with hell,\"\r\nand declared that he wanted \"no union with slaveholders.\" His violent\r\nlanguage, his repudiation of vested rights and constitutional\r\nagreements, and his fanatical disregard of other men's opinions and\r\nfeelings, led the people both of the North and the South to believe\r\nthat his methods were incendiary and his morals loose; that he and his\r\nco-workers were planning and plotting slave insurrection, and thereby\r\nthe wholesale massacre of slaveholders; and that he and they were\r\nendeavoring to attain, through violence and anarchy, a leadership\r\nwhich they could not otherwise reach.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Southampton massacre.]\r\n\r\nIn August of 1831, a slave insurrection broke out in Southampton\r\nCounty, Va., under the leadership of a {249} negro named Nat Turner,\r\nand more than sixty white persons, most of them women and children,\r\nwere massacred in cold blood. The Southerners said, no doubt believed,\r\nthat the insurrection was incited by the Abolitionists in the North.\r\nGovernor Floyd, of Virginia, declared, in his message to the\r\nlegislature upon the subject, that there was ample proof of it in the\r\ndocuments accompanying the message. The great mass of the people at\r\nthe North believed the same thing. The Abolitionist historians assert,\r\non the contrary, that there was no connection between the work of the\r\nAbolitionists and this event. We shall probably never know whether\r\nthere was or not. This much we can say, that the radical character of\r\nthe Abolition doctrines and the violence of the language in which they\r\nwere expressed--not so much before as after this event,\r\nindeed--produced the universal feeling, both in the North and in the\r\nSouth, that these doctrines and this event were in perfect harmony,\r\nand that the latter might very naturally be the outcome of the former.\r\nThe moral sentiment of the North was not prepared for the destruction\r\nof slavery by any such means. It considered these methods as\r\ncontaining ten times more evil and barbarism than slavery itself. It\r\nis just to say that what appeared to be the methods of the\r\nAbolitionists were revolting to the moral feelings of all the decent\r\npeople of the North, and to ninety-nine one-hundredths of all the\r\npeople of the North, while the Southerners saw in them nothing but the\r\ndestruction of all law and order, the plunder of their property, the\r\nburning of their firesides, and the massacre of their families. The\r\npronounced and determined manner in which the people of the North went\r\nabout the work of suppressing the agitation occasioned by the\r\nAbolitionists is ample evidence to any sane mind that the indignation\r\nof a {250} righteous conscience was fully aroused, and not the fury of\r\na guilty conscience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attempt to suppress the Abolition movement at the\r\nNorth.]\r\n\r\nThe details of the breaking up of the Abolition meetings and of the\r\ndestruction of the Abolition printing-presses by the citizens of the\r\nNorthern Commonwealths, as well as those of the Southampton massacre,\r\nmay be passed over, in a work like this, with a single remark that\r\nonly one person, the Rev. Mr. Lovejoy, was murdered in these\r\ncollisions; that this happened under circumstances of some\r\naggravation; and that, if the excitement at the South over the\r\nmassacre of sixty-one innocent persons was out of proportion with the\r\nevent, then not too much should be made out of the killing of a single\r\nperson, who was not entirely guiltless on his part of giving\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nThe things of importance to the student of constitutional history in\r\nconnection with these events are the increase of the Abolitionists in\r\nnumber, their organization into societies, the dissatisfaction of the\r\nSoutherners with the unofficial, merely popular, way of dealing with\r\nthe agitation at the North, and their demands upon the governments of\r\nthe Northern Commonwealths to deal with the Abolitionists through the\r\nprocesses of their criminal law.\r\n\r\nSo long as men only talk and write, it is the impulse of our\r\nAnglo-Saxon character to place no further restraint upon them than the\r\nlaw of slander and libel of private character imposes, no matter what\r\nmay be, or may be thought to be, the ultimate consequences of acting\r\naccording to what they may say or write. To deny this privilege to\r\nanybody appears like a deprivation of the liberty of speech and of the\r\npress, appears like persecution. There is no country in the world in\r\nwhich the making of martyrs is an easier procedure than in {251} the\r\nUnited States. Persecution is the soil in which new movements grow\r\nbest, no matter what may be the character of the movement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of the Abolition movement.]\r\n\r\nIn a single year from the date of the first number of Garrison's\r\nnewspaper, _The Liberator_, that is, in January of 1832, the New\r\nEngland Anti-slavery Society was formed, and in December of 1833 the\r\nAmerican Anti-slavery Society was organized, which soon established\r\nbranches in many quarters. The exaggerated demands of the Southerners,\r\nthat the Northern Commonwealths should forbid Abolition agitation by\r\nlaw, thus identifying the interests of slavery with the denial of the\r\nfreedom of speaking and writing in the Northern Commonwealths, helped\r\ngreatly to swell the ranks of the Abolitionists, and to mollify public\r\nopinion in the North against them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The methods of the moderate Abolitionists.]\r\n\r\nThe new Abolitionists were naturally of a more moderate type than\r\nGarrison, and most of them would listen only to regular legal methods\r\nfor the accomplishment of their purposes. The quickening of the public\r\nopinion in the North, the conviction of the slaveholders themselves of\r\nthe error, if not the sin, of slavery, and the appeal to the\r\nGovernment to do all within its constitutional powers against slavery,\r\nwere the only means which many of them were willing to employ. Their\r\npetitions to Congress, and the transmission of their literature of\r\nAbolition to the Southerners through the United States mails, brought\r\nthe whole question of their rights and purposes before the Government,\r\nand before the nation, for which that Government was bound to act with\r\nimpartial justice to all its parts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Abolition petitions.]\r\n\r\nPetitions for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia had\r\nbeen sent to Congress, generally from {252} Quaker sources, almost\r\nfrom the day that the capital of the country was established there,\r\nbut they were not numerous and were not pushed by any anti-slavery\r\norganization. In the session of 1826-27, a petition from citizens of\r\nBaltimore, probably instigated by Benjamin Lundy, was presented, which\r\ncontained the same prayer; and in the session of 1827-28, one of like\r\ntenor from citizens of the District itself was presented. Such\r\npetitions were usually read and referred to the committee on the\r\nDistrict. They were irritating to the slaveholders from the first, but\r\nit was not until after the excitement of the Southampton massacre that\r\nthey were angrily resented as an interference with the domestic\r\ninstitutions of the slaveholding Commonwealths.\r\n\r\nIt was in the session of 1831-32, that the first mutterings of the\r\npetition storm were heard. On December 12th, 1831, Mr. John Quincy\r\nAdams presented, in the House of Representatives, fifteen petitions\r\nfrom sundry inhabitants of Pennsylvania, the chief prayer of all of\r\nwhich was for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\r\nMr. Adams said that he would give no countenance to that prayer, but\r\nthat there was a prayer in the petitions for the abolition of the\r\nslave-trade in the District, which, he thought, might properly be\r\nconsidered, and he moved the reference of the petitions, for this\r\npurpose, to the regular committee of the House for the District.\r\n\r\nThere was in this little to indicate the terrible earnestness which\r\nMr. Adams later displayed in behalf of the Abolition petitions. He\r\nseemed at this time to be annoyed at being asked to present them, and\r\nto feel that there were superior moral reasons why a slavery agitation\r\nshould not be excited within the halls of Congress. But all this was\r\nsoon to change. Mr. Adams's advance {253} toward radical Abolitionism\r\nis as marked a feature of the struggle over the right of petition as\r\nMr. Calhoun's declaration of the righteousness of slavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The earlier method of dealing with the petitions.]\r\n\r\nThe committee on the District reported, on December 19th, that as the\r\nDistrict was composed of cessions of territory from Maryland and\r\nVirginia, it would, in the opinion of the members of the committee, be\r\nunwise, if not unjust, for Congress to interfere in the question of\r\nthe relation of slave to master in the District, until Virginia and\r\nMaryland should take steps to eradicate the evil from their respective\r\nterritories. This report seemed to settle the question for the\r\nsession, and no more petitions appeared in either House.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the next session, Mr. Hiester, of Pennsylvania,\r\npresented a petition to the House of Representatives from sundry\r\ncitizens of Pennsylvania praying for the abolition of slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. This was again a Quaker petition, as were the\r\npetitions presented by Mr. Adams. Mr. Hiester moved to refer the\r\npetition to the committee on the District, and Mr. Mason, of Virginia,\r\nrashly called for the yeas and nays, which opened the question to\r\ndebate. Mr. Adams immediately pointed out this fact to Mr. Mason, and\r\nadvised him to withdraw his motion, which advice Mr. Mason wisely\r\nadopted. The petition went to the Committee, and nothing further was\r\nheard of it.\r\n\r\nIt was first in the session of 1833-34, that petitions for the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District from others than Quakers,\r\npresumably from the members of the new anti-slavery societies,\r\nappeared in both Houses of Congress. Those presented in the Senate\r\nwere referred to the committee of the Senate for the District, and\r\nnothing more was heard of them. Those presented in the House of\r\nRepresentatives were dealt with in the same manner.\r\n\r\n{254} It was not until the session of 1834-35, that the first real\r\nnote of the conflict was sounded. On January 26th, 1835, Mr. Dickson,\r\nof New York, presented several petitions praying for the abolition of\r\nthe slave-trade and of slavery in the District. They were laid over\r\nuntil February 2nd, when Mr. Dickson called them up, made a rather\r\nirritating speech, in which he said that the committee on the District\r\nhad smothered all such petitions referred to it, and moved the\r\nreference of those offered by him to a select committee.\r\n\r\nMr. Chinn, of Virginia, the chairman of the regular committee on the\r\nDistrict, resented Mr. Dickson's rude assault, and moved to lay the\r\npetitions and Mr. Dickson's motion on the table. The House voted Mr.\r\nChinn's motion by a large majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginning of the conflict over the Abolition petitions.]\r\n\r\nAt length, in the session of 1835-36, the storm broke in all its fury,\r\nin both the Senate and the House. It began in the House, December\r\n16th, 1835, upon the presentation of a petition, containing the usual\r\nprayer in regard to slavery in the District, by Mr. Fairfield, of\r\nMaine. Mr. Cramer, of New York, moved to lay the petition on the\r\ntable, and the motion was voted. Mr. Fairfield immediately presented\r\nanother petition of like purport, and himself moved that it be laid\r\nupon the table. Mr. Boon, of Indiana, asked that the petition be read,\r\nwhich was done. Thereupon Mr. Slade, of Vermont, moved that it be\r\nprinted. This meant, of course, that Mr. Slade was determined to have\r\nthe slavery question agitated in Congress, if he could. Upon him\r\nrather than upon Mr. Adams rests the honor, or the blame, whichever it\r\nmay be, of provoking the excitement over the Abolition petitions, and\r\nof upholding the right of petition in the most extreme degree.\r\n\r\nThe House first voted to lay the petition on the table. {255} The\r\nSpeaker, Mr. James K. Polk, then put Mr. Slade's motion to print.\r\nWhereupon Mr. Slade attempted to debate the whole question of slavery\r\nin the District under the motion. The Speaker ruled that the contents\r\nof the petition could not be debated under the motion to print. Mr.\r\nVanderpoel, of New York, then moved to lay Mr. Slade's motion on the\r\ntable, and the House voted to do so by a large majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hammond's motion involving the denial of the right of\r\npetition.]\r\n\r\nTwo days later the play was on again. Mr. Jackson, of Massachusetts,\r\npresented a petition from sundry citizens of Massachusetts, containing\r\nthe usual prayer, and moved its reference to a select committee.\r\nWhereupon Mr. Hammond, South Carolina, moved that the petition should\r\nnot be received. This was the ultra-Southern position in regard to the\r\nanti-slavery petitions, and Mr. Hammond's enunciation of it in the\r\nHouse antedates Mr. Calhoun's in the Senate by more than a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution guarantees the right of the people to assemble\r\npeaceably and petition the Government for redress of grievances. The\r\nright to petition certainly includes the right to have the petitions\r\nheard by the body petitioned. If the body refuses to receive the\r\npetition, it prevents its being heard, and by preventing its being\r\nheard it makes the right itself a mockery. On the other hand, the\r\nConstitution vests in each House of Congress the power to make its own\r\nrules of procedure. This power must, of course, be so used as not to\r\nviolate any other clause of the Constitution. Under this power,\r\nhowever, each House may and should protect itself against all\r\nobstacles thrown by outsiders in the way of the discharge of its\r\nduties in legislating for the country. If any number of people\r\nundertake, by an abuse of the right of petition, to obstruct the\r\nlegitimate work of the Congress for the whole people, each House {256}\r\ncertainly has the right to meet this attempt in any way which will not\r\ndeny the right of petition, the right of any one or any number of the\r\npeople to be heard in asking for a redress of grievances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new method for dealing with petitions in the House of\r\nRepresentatives.]\r\n\r\nDown to 1834, the custom of procedure in Congress had been to receive,\r\nhear, and refer all petitions. That was going one step farther than\r\nwas required by the constitutional right of petition; still it was the\r\nregular course, and such men as Mr. Adams thought it unwise to depart\r\nfrom the custom in the case of the Abolition petitions. At any rate,\r\nMr. Hammond's motion was a new proposition. The Speaker said that he\r\nwas \"not aware that such a motion had ever been sustained by the\r\nformer practice of the House,\" and appeared to rule Mr. Hammond's\r\nmotion out of order. A confused wrangle ensued over the attitude\r\nassumed by the Speaker, during which Mr. Hammond made a motion to\r\nreject the petition, and the Speaker, becoming confused by the two\r\nmotions, the one not to receive, and the other to reject, and knowing\r\nthat the House could of course reject the prayer of a petition,\r\nyielded to the representations of Mr. Hammond, and put Mr. Hammond's\r\nmotion not to _receive_ the petition to the House. The House voted not\r\nto refuse to receive the petition, but the ruling of the Speaker in\r\nputting the motion implied that the House possessed the power to\r\nrefuse to receive, that is, to refuse to hear, a petition. Another\r\nconfused wrangle ensued over the question whether the House had voted\r\nmerely not to refuse to receive the petition, or had voted to consider\r\nits contents at once. After a day of heated debate and three days of\r\nadjournment, during which excited feelings were somewhat calmed, the\r\nHouse reversed all former action, and voted to lay the petition and\r\nall the motions relating to it on the table.\r\n\r\n{257} [Sidenote: True view of the right of petition.]\r\n\r\nAnother petition, which, during this wrangle had been inadvertently\r\nreferred to the committee on the District, was now recalled by a\r\nmotion to reconsider the vote of reference. It was upon this motion\r\nthat Mr. Adams made his first great appeal for the right of petition.\r\nAs we have seen, his view before this was that petitions must be\r\nreceived, heard, and referred. In this speech, however, he indicated\r\nthat there should be a report from the committee, and a vote upon the\r\nreport. Mr. Jones, of Virginia, met Mr. Adams' assertions quite\r\nsuccessfully, and showed conclusively that, if the right of petition\r\nshould be interpreted to reach any farther than the right to have the\r\npetition received and heard, it would so modify the constitutional\r\nright of the House to establish its own rules of procedure as to put\r\nit in the power of a few determined obstructionists outside the House,\r\nacting with a single member of the House, to prevent the House from\r\ndoing anything but consider petitions upon a single subject,\r\nsacrificing thus the interests of the whole people to the obstinacy of\r\na small number of the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The power of Congress over slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia.]\r\n\r\nMr. Jones' argument was so sound and rational that it would probably\r\nhave settled the minds of almost all of the members in regard to the\r\ncomplicated questions of the right of petition, and the powers of the\r\nHouse over its rules of procedure, had not Mr. Granger, of New York,\r\nand Mr. Ingersoll, of Pennsylvania, thrown another firebrand into the\r\nHouse during this debate, in the form of an intimation that Congress\r\nhad the constitutional power to abolish slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia. The Southerners now advanced to the position of denying that\r\npower to Congress, and Mr. Wise, of Virginia, in a long and violent\r\nspeech, demanded that Congress {258} should pass a resolution\r\ndisclaiming the possession of any such power. Mr. Slade immediately\r\naccepted the challenge of Mr. Wise, and delivered an anti-slavery\r\nspeech in reply, such as had never before been heard upon the floors\r\nof Congress. He not only vindicated the power of Congress over the\r\nquestion of slavery in the District, but he discussed the whole\r\nquestion of slavery upon its merits. His words were simply a\r\ndeclaration of relentless war upon slavery in the halls of Congress.\r\nThey created indescribable consternation in all parts of the House,\r\nand roused the resentment and anger of the slaveholders to a veritable\r\nfury. In the midst of the confusion, Mr. Garland, of Virginia, gained\r\nthe Speaker's recognition, and made a good argument against some of\r\nMr. Slade's more radical statements. So soon as he had finished, Mr.\r\nMann, of New York, moved to stop the debate with the previous\r\nquestion. This was voted, and the Speaker then put the motion for the\r\nreconsideration of the reference of the petition, under which motion\r\nthis debate had proceeded. This was voted, and immediately the motion\r\nwas made to lay the recalled petition, with the reconsidered motion to\r\nrefer it, on the table. This was voted by a majority of more than two\r\nto one.\r\n\r\nEvidently the House thought that, in receiving and hearing the\r\npetitions and then laying them on the table, it had found the solution\r\nof the question, which neither violated the right of petition in the\r\npeople, nor encroached upon the power of the House over its rules of\r\nprocedure, nor opened the way for anti-slavery agitation in Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Polk's fatal error in regard to the right of petition.]\r\n\r\nIt would have been wise for the slaveholders to have left this\r\nsolution of the question undisturbed, but they did not see it so. On\r\nJanuary 4th, 1836, Mr. Adams presented a petition from sundry citizens\r\nof {259} Massachusetts containing the usual prayer, and said that \"in\r\nconformity with the course heretofore adopted, he should move that the\r\npetition, without reading, be laid on the table.\" Mr. Patton\r\ninterrupted Mr. Adams with an inquiry addressed to the Speaker as to\r\nwhether the petition had been received by the House, and the Speaker\r\nreplied that it had not. He said that, upon looking up the\r\nauthorities, he \"had formed the opinion that the first question to be\r\ndecided, upon the motion of a member, was whether the petition be\r\nreceived or not.\" The Speaker, Mr. Polk, had now come out of his\r\nuncertainty about the right of petition including the reception of the\r\npetition by the House, as a constitutional obligation, and now\r\ndefinitely denied that the right of petition included the right to\r\nhave the petition received by the House. This was a fatal move, a\r\nfatal mistake upon his part. The object professedly sought by all\r\nparties, except such Abolitionists as Mr. Slade, was the prevention of\r\nagitation upon the slavery question in the halls of Congress. Whether\r\nall were sincere in this profession is questionable. It had been\r\ninsinuated that there were agitators upon this question from both\r\nsections of the country, who were disingenuously claiming to be\r\nclassed with the maintainers of peace. It does really seem that the\r\ninnuendo was justified as to certain of the Southerners by the\r\nposition now assumed by Mr. Patton and Mr. Polk, and then by Mr.\r\nGlascock, who, immediately after the ruling of the Speaker, moved that\r\nthis petition be not received. While Mr. Adams, who sincerely believed\r\nthat reference as well as reception was a necessary consequence of the\r\nright of petition, had accommodated himself to the decision which the\r\nHouse had made a fortnight before, these Southern gentlemen were now\r\nproposing to drive the House from {260} the solid middle ground, then\r\noccupied, toward a position which the majority considered to be an\r\nencroachment upon the constitutional right of petition, a movement\r\nupon their part which was certain, and known by all to be certain, to\r\nprovoke an excited debate upon the question of slavery. It may be that\r\nthey thought the refusal to receive one of these anti-slavery\r\npetitions would prevent any more from being presented, and that it was\r\nbetter to have it out once for all than to be continually receiving,\r\nand listening to the reading of, these petitions. If so, they were\r\nwofully mistaken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Adams' futile attempt to prevent slavery agitation in\r\nCongress.]\r\n\r\nMr. Adams now made one more effort to preserve the Southerners against\r\nthe consequences of their own folly. He undertook to arrest the debate\r\nby calling for the application of the forty-fifth rule of the House,\r\nwhich required that no petition should be debated or decided on the\r\nday of its presentation. But the Speaker now decided that this rule\r\ncould not apply to a petition until it had been received. The gates of\r\nJanus were flung wide open, and the House went into an agitation upon\r\nthe subject, to which all that had gone before was only a prelude. The\r\nstruggle lasted for more than four months, during which period\r\npetitions for the abolition of slavery in the District, signed by over\r\nthirty thousand persons, were poured into the House. The slavery\r\nquestion was at last brought before the people of the United States in\r\na way most highly satisfactory to the most radical Abolitionist, and\r\nno matter what the immediate compromise upon the subject might be, it\r\nwas evident to all farseeing minds then that a death-blow had been\r\nstruck at slavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pinckney resolutions.]\r\n\r\nThere is not space in this work to recount the scenes enacted on the\r\nfloor of the House during these four exciting months, or even to give\r\na resume of the debate. {261} The conflict was ended for the moment by\r\nthe adoption, on May 25th (1836), of a series of resolutions reported\r\nby a committee appointed for the purpose, of which Mr. Pinckney, of\r\nSouth Carolina, was the chairman. These resolutions provided: \"That\r\nCongress possesses no constitutional authority to interfere in any way\r\nwith the institution of slavery in any of the States of this\r\nConfederacy; that Congress ought not to interfere with slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia; and whereas it is extremely important and\r\ndesirable that the agitation of this subject should be finally\r\narrested, for the purpose of restoring tranquillity to the public\r\nmind, ... that all petitions, memorials, propositions, or papers,\r\nrelating in any way, or to any extent whatsoever, to the subject of\r\nslavery, or the abolition of slavery, shall, without being printed or\r\nreferred, be laid upon the table, and that no further action whatever\r\nshall be had thereon.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new rule of the House of Representatives in regard to\r\nthe Abolition petitions.]\r\n\r\nThe solution thus reached by the House of the question of the power of\r\nthe House to control its procedure, over against the right of a number\r\nof individuals to excite interminable discussions and paralyze the\r\nbusiness of the House by flooding it with petitions upon one and the\r\nsame subject, was the laying of all such petitions on the table _as a\r\nrule of the House_.\r\n\r\nOf course this rule must be readopted at the beginning of each\r\nsession, and a debate upon the readoption might be thus precipitated,\r\nbut, so long as a majority supported the rule, the previous question\r\ncould be voted after giving a reasonable opportunity to discuss the\r\nquestion of readoption, and such discussion was then not likely to be\r\nrenewed during the session. It was possible also for petitions to be\r\n{262} presented, at the beginning of the session, before the\r\nreadoption of the rule, and these could be disposed of only by a\r\nspecial vote in each case to lay upon the table. There were thus still\r\nopportunities for the Abolitionists to cause the House to resolve\r\nitself into something more like a bear-garden than an assembly of\r\nWitan, as was evident from the scenes which were enacted on February\r\n6th, 1837, when Mr. Adams came into the House with a petition in\r\nregard to slavery signed by some twenty slaves, and asked the Speaker\r\nif it came under the rule for laying such petitions on the table.\r\nEverybody supposed that the petition contained the usual prayer for\r\nthe abolition of slavery, and that the Abolitionists had incited the\r\nslaves to the act. Mr. Adams allowed the excitement produced by this\r\nsupposition to rage for a time, and then coolly and derisively\r\ninformed the House that the prayer of the petition was not for\r\nabolition but against it. The members now felt that Mr. Adams was\r\nplaying with the peace, order, and dignity of the House in a\r\nscandalous way, and for several days the question of censuring him was\r\nconsidered, but the matter was finally disposed of by a resolution\r\ndeclaring: \"That slaves do not possess the right of petition secured\r\nto the people of the United States by the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the next session, that of 1837-38, Mr. Slade\r\nseized the opportunity to present an abolition petition before the\r\nre-enactment of the Pinckney rule, and to provoke a debate on the\r\nsubject of slavery. He was substantially foiled, however, by a vote to\r\nadjourn, and, upon reassembly, by a suspension of the rules and a\r\nre-enactment of the resolution to lay everything in reference to\r\nslavery on the table. This rule covered all matters relating to\r\nslavery in the Territories as well as in the Commonwealths and the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\n{263} [Sidenote: The increase of petitions, and the denunciation of\r\nthe Pinckney rule.]\r\n\r\nThe more the House did to discourage the petitions the more they\r\nincreased. In two years from the adoption of the Pinckney resolutions\r\nthe number of petitioners was tenfold greater than it was before their\r\nenactment. At the same time the legislatures of the New England\r\nCommonwealths were passing resolutions declaring the rule of the House\r\nof Representatives in regard to the abolition petitions to be a\r\nviolation of the people's constitutional right, and also declaring\r\nthat Congress possessed the power to abolish slavery in the District\r\nof Columbia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The final denial of the right of petition on the subject of\r\nSlavery by the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nTo meet these demonstrations of increasing strength and increasing\r\ndetermination on the part of the Abolitionists, the House not only\r\nrepeated its rule, but made it more stringent, until, at last,\r\nirritated beyond measure at the persistence of the petitioners, it\r\ntook the fatal step, and, on January 8th, 1840, enacted as a standing\r\nrule of the House: \"That no petition, memorial, resolution, or other\r\npaper, praying the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\nor any State or Territory, or the slave-trade between the States or\r\nTerritories of the United States in which it now exists, _shall be\r\nreceived by this House, or entertained in any way whatever_.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the House had encroached upon the most essential part of the\r\nright of petition, the right to have the petition heard. The moderate\r\nmen of the South and twenty-eight members from the North had given way\r\nbefore the radical men of the South, and had fallen into the ranks\r\nunder their lead. The Southern radicals thought that they had won a\r\ngreat victory, but it was not so. They had only identified the denial\r\nof the right of petition with the interests of slavery. They {264} had\r\nonly demonstrated that slavery was a matter of national concern, since\r\nits interests required that limitations should be placed upon the well\r\nunderstood rights of the people in the non-slaveholding Commonwealths.\r\nThey only made it manifest that, sooner or later, the nation must deal\r\nwith the question. Their most violent enemies could not have wished\r\nthem a more disastrous result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Abolition petitions in the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in the Senate in regard to the Abolition petitions\r\nmust be even more concisely stated. The course pursued and the result\r\nreached were similar to what has been described in the account of the\r\nexperiences of the House. The Senate first received and heard the\r\npetitions, and voted immediately to deny their prayer. Then, when it\r\nbecame evident that this would not prevent anti-slavery agitation on\r\nthe floor of the Senate, the body adopted the custom of hearing a\r\nmotion not to receive a petition, and voting immediately to lay the\r\nmotion not to receive, and along with it the petition itself, on the\r\ntable. This practice was modified a little later, by a ruling of the\r\npresiding officer, to the effect that an objection to the petition by\r\nany member would raise the question of the reception of the petition\r\nwithout a formal motion. Mr. Calhoun had contended for this method of\r\nraising the question in regard to the reception of the petitions from\r\nthe beginning of the struggle over the subject, in January of 1836. He\r\nseemed, however, to desire to dispose of them by simply voting not to\r\nreceive them. In fact, he made a motion to this effect, at the very\r\noutset of the contest, but without success. While thus the Senate did\r\nnot formally adopt the practice finally reached in the House of\r\nrefusing to receive the petitions, it arrived at about the same result\r\nin practice. It is true that the presiding officer of the Senate\r\nallowed the petitions to be {265} read before putting the motion upon\r\ntheir reception, which seems to have been an illogical practice\r\nindeed, and that any member might move to call up the motion not to\r\nreceive, and with it the petition or petitions to which that motion\r\nreferred; but the reading before the motion not to receive, or before\r\nthe objection to receiving, was perfunctory, and there was no member\r\nof the Senate who desired to call up the tabled petitions or persisted\r\nin so doing. As a matter of fact, the public opinion which the\r\nAbolitionists succeeded in creating in the North concerning the\r\nattitude of the Senate toward the Abolition petitions was that the\r\nSenate had done the same violence to the people's constitutional right\r\nof petition that the House had done. It was held and believed\r\nthroughout the North, in 1840, that the Congress of the United States,\r\nin both of its branches, had set the interests of slavery above the\r\nliberties of the people of the North.\r\n\r\nThere were two incidents which happened during the course of the\r\nproceedings in the Senate upon the subject to which brief reference\r\nshould be made. One was the noted passage of words between Mr. Calhoun\r\nand Mr. Rives, of Virginia, in regard to the morality of slavery, and\r\nthe other was the petition from the legislature of Vermont for the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Rives and Mr. Calhoun in regard to the morality of\r\nslavery.]\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists had assumed to have the ethical principle entirely\r\nupon their side, and this had not, down to 1836, been clearly disputed\r\nby the slaveholders. The slaveholders had, themselves, as we have so\r\noften seen, acknowledged slavery to be an evil, and had, therefore,\r\ndefended it chiefly from the point of view of positive law. Of course\r\nso profound a thinker as Mr. Calhoun knew that positive law cannot\r\npermanently withstand the {266} assaults of ethical principle. He knew\r\nthat the moral arguments against slavery must be met upon moral\r\ngrounds, as well as upon legal grounds. The discussion was carried\r\nover upon ethical premises by the remark of Mr. Rives that he, though\r\na slaveholder, was not in favor of slavery in the abstract, and\r\ndiffered on that point with the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr.\r\nCalhoun immediately denied that he had expressed any opinion in regard\r\nto the question of slavery in the abstract, and said he had spoken of\r\nslavery only \"as existing where two races of men, of different color,\r\nand striking dissimilarity in conformation, habits, and a thousand\r\nother particulars, were placed in immediate juxtaposition.\" Mr.\r\nCalhoun elaborated his argument in many directions, but the gist of it\r\nwas that where a civilized race and a barbarous race, nearly equal\r\nnumerically, must live together, the civilized race must, in the\r\ninterests of the civilization of both races, control the barbarous\r\nrace, through the relation of the slavery of the latter to the former,\r\nand that the only alternative to this would be the barbarizing of the\r\nwhole society by the uncontrolled deeds and passions of the barbarous\r\nrace, if the two races are left to themselves, or the establishment of\r\na barbaric despotism over the civilized race, if the barbaric race be\r\naided by successful interference from without. In contrast with either\r\nof these conditions, Mr. Calhoun contended that the slavery of the\r\nbarbarous race to the civilized race was a moral good.\r\n\r\nFrom a metaphysical point of view the only question between Mr. Rives\r\nand Mr. Calhoun was whether every departure from the perfect good must\r\nbe considered an evil, or whether a nearer approximation to the\r\nperfect good may be called a good in contrast with a lower\r\napproximation. Mr. Rives was looking at the subject {267} from an\r\nabstract, transcendental point of view, while Mr. Calhoun was\r\nregarding it from the historical point of view. Mr. Rives was with the\r\nAbolitionists upon the abstract principle, but against them as to the\r\ntime and means of applying it. Mr. Calhoun was not against the\r\nAbolitionists upon the abstract principle, but the time of its\r\npossible application appeared to him so far distant, and the\r\nimpropriety and unfairness of interference by outsiders in the matter\r\nand the disastrous consequences which must flow from such interference\r\nseemed to him so plain and so certain, that he almost lost sight of\r\nthe abstract height upon which the Abolitionists stood behind the many\r\nintervening elevations, which must be first attained and traversed in\r\norder to reach their position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The moral ground upon which Calhoun and the Abolitionists\r\ncould have met.]\r\n\r\nThere was a possible moral ground upon which Mr. Calhoun and the\r\nAbolitionists might have met. Could the Abolitionists have conceived\r\nthat the existence of certain conditions would justify domestic\r\nslavery as a relation which could _temporarily_ produce a better state\r\nof morals in a particularly constituted society than any other\r\nrelation, that is, could they have taken the historical view of\r\nethics, the evolutionary view of morals, and could Mr. Calhoun have\r\nseen that the time had come for a modification of the existing form of\r\nnegro slavery in the South, for a step toward a greater degree of\r\npersonal liberty for the slave, an approach between him and them might\r\nhave been, at least, begun; but their implacable dogmatism, and his\r\nstern resentment at their persistent interference in what he thought\r\nno concern of theirs, widened the gulf between him and them from day\r\nto day. They regarded him as a sinner and a criminal because he held\r\npersons to service and labor who had not freely agreed to the same,\r\nand he {268} considered them to be greater sinners and criminals\r\nbecause they would overturn the existing order of society in\r\ncommunities where they had no personal interests to be affected, and\r\nwould introduce into these communities the reign of plunder, rapine,\r\nand murder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Calhoun's resolutions in regard to the political\r\nrelations of slavery.]\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Calhoun saw that he could not bring the Senate to refuse\r\nformally to receive the Abolition petitions, he undertook to bring the\r\nSenate over to his views of the \"States' sovereignty\" character of the\r\nUnion, of the obligation of the general Government to protect slavery\r\nin the slaveholding Commonwealths, of the ethical obligation of the\r\npeople of the non-slaveholding Commonwealths not to attack the\r\ninstitution of slavery, and of the practical impotence of Congress to\r\ndeal with slavery in the District of Columbia and in the Territories.\r\nHe did not, however, succeed. The Senate did not repudiate his\r\n\"States' sovereignty\" view of the Union, but, while it was willing to\r\nsay that neither the Northern Commonwealths nor the Northern people\r\nhad any legal right to attack slavery under moral or religious\r\npretexts, it would not say that they were under moral or religious\r\nobligations to abstain from the attack. Neither would the Senate say\r\nthat the general Government must so exercise its powers as to give\r\nincreased security to slavery, nor that the general Government had no\r\npower over the subject of slavery in the District and the Territories.\r\nIt modified these demands of Mr. Calhoun so as to make them read, that\r\nthe general Government should not so exercise its powers as to\r\ninterfere with the security of the domestic institutions of the\r\nCommonwealths, and that the general Government ought not in good faith\r\nto undertake to abolish slavery in the District or in the Territories,\r\nexcept under certain conditions.\r\n\r\n{269} [Sidenote: The anti-slavery petition from the Vermont\r\nlegislature.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate occasion of the presentation of these resolutions of\r\nDecember 27th, 1837, by Mr. Calhoun, was probably the other incident\r\nto which reference has been made, the introduction, by Senator Swift,\r\nof Vermont, of a petition from the legislature of Vermont praying for\r\nthe abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. This shaft had\r\nstruck Mr. Calhoun in his most vulnerable part. Here was, according to\r\nhis own doctrine, a \"sovereign State\" instructing its governmental\r\nagent for general affairs. Could that agent refuse to receive the\r\ninstructions of one of his principals? There certainly was no\r\nprecedent for any such procedure as that in any system of\r\njurisprudence known to the world. Mr. Calhoun recognized fully the\r\nembarrassment of his position. He begged that the communication from\r\nthe Vermont legislature might lay upon the table until he could\r\nprepare his mind for action upon the subject, and pledged himself to\r\ncall it up very shortly, if no one else should do so. Mr. Swift helped\r\nthe Senate, and Mr. Calhoun especially, out of the dilemma by\r\nwithdrawing the petition for the time being. This incident occurred on\r\nDecember 19th.\r\n\r\nMr. Swift assumed that Mr. Calhoun's resolutions of the 27th contained\r\nthe results of his preparation of mind to meet the Vermont memorial,\r\nand after the consideration of them by the Senate, Mr. Swift\r\nreintroduced the memorial on January 16th (1838). The Southerners had\r\nbeen thrown into such confusion by the _coup de surprise_ sprung upon\r\nthem by the Vermonters that they had not been able to agree upon any\r\nplan for meeting the exigency. Some of them denounced the action of\r\nthe Vermont legislature as incendiary, outrageous, and degrading. Mr.\r\nKing gave his \"States' sovereignty\" creed entirely away in saying: \"We\r\n{270} defend the legitimate rights of the States, but we do not defend\r\na sovereign State when she asserts calumny and falsehood.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun was measured in his language, but evidently greatly\r\ndisturbed in mind. He said that as a \"States' rights\" man, in the\r\nstrongest sense, he believed that the \"State\" of Vermont had a right\r\nto come there and be heard; that, on the best reflection he could give\r\nto the matter, he could not vote against receiving the petition; but\r\nthat, on the other hand, he considered the language of the memorial so\r\nobjectionable that he could not vote to receive it.\r\n\r\nIt does seem as if this incident should have taught Mr. Calhoun the\r\nfallacy of his logic in insisting upon the power of the Senate to\r\nrefuse to receive a petition. Here was a case in which his doctrine of\r\nparliamentary procedure had absolutely broken down, according to his\r\nown acknowledgment. Mr. Strange, of North Carolina, committed the\r\nfolly of objecting to the reception of the petition, and moving that\r\nthe question of reception, and with it the petition, be laid on the\r\ntable. The motion was defeated by a vote of twenty-six to twelve. The\r\nmemorial was received and the debate upon it was in order. The\r\nSoutherners were helpless, and had not Mr. Swift himself come to their\r\nrescue, no man can say what would have happened. Mr. Swift moved that\r\nthe papers from the Vermont legislature be laid upon the table,\r\nwithout being printed. They had accomplished their immediate purpose,\r\nand it was wise as well as patriotic to let them rest in dignity and\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Abolition documents and the United States mails.]\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists were more successful in their attempt to use the\r\nUnited States mails for the distribution of their literature\r\nthroughout the South. During the course of the year 1835, it became\r\nknown that {271} their opinions and doctrines were being disseminated\r\nby this means. The Southerners considered these opinions to be\r\nincendiary and dangerous to the peace and safety of their communities\r\nand their firesides. They thought that they had the legal right to\r\nprevent the delivery of such mail matter in their respective\r\ncommunities. They did not wait, however, to deal with the subject\r\nthrough legal forms. On the night of July 29th, 1835, a mob of\r\nrespectables broke into the post-office at Charleston, S. C., in\r\nsearch of Abolition documents. They found a sack full of them, took it\r\naway with them, and publicly burned its contents. On August 4th\r\nfollowing, a meeting of the citizens took place, at which a committee\r\nof public safety was elected, which should, in understanding with the\r\npostmaster, determine what mail matter should not be delivered by him\r\nto the addressees. The postmaster apparently acquiesced in this\r\narrangement, but he wrote, upon his own responsibility, a letter to\r\nthe postmaster of New York City, whence the Abolition pamphlets had\r\ncome, requesting him not to forward any more such documents. The\r\npostmaster at New York endeavored to induce the Abolitionists not to\r\nput any more of their literature into the mails until he could receive\r\ninstructions from the Postmaster-General at Washington in regard to\r\nthe question; and when the Abolitionists repelled his request, he\r\nrefused to forward their documents, pending his conference with the\r\nPostmaster-General.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Postmaster-General's ruling in regard to the Abolition\r\ndocuments in the mails.]\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General, Mr. Amos Kendall, one of the shrewdest of\r\npoliticians, though no great constitutional lawyer, answered the\r\nappeal from the postmaster at New York immediately. He instructed his\r\nsubordinate that the executive power of the Government had no legal\r\nauthority to exclude mail matter, as defined by {272} Congress, from\r\nthe mails on account of the character of its contents, real or\r\nsupposed. If Mr. Kendall had stopped with this he would have been\r\nentirely correct; but he went on to say that he would not direct the\r\npostmaster at New York to forward the Abolition documents or the\r\npostmaster at Charleston to deliver them, commended their assumption\r\nof the responsibility of withholding them from the addressees, and\r\ndeclared that the United States officials owed an obligation to the\r\nlaws of the United States, but a higher one to the communities in\r\nwhich they lived. Mr. Kendall probably meant this part of his\r\ncommunication as the advice of one private citizen to another. Looked\r\nat in the most charitable light possible, however, it was\r\nunjustifiable and pernicious. It was nothing less than an\r\nencouragement to his subordinates to suspend the execution of the laws\r\nwhich they were appointed to execute and sworn to execute, when in\r\ntheir several opinions the welfare of the communities in which they\r\nmight live should require it. This was nullification, not by a \"State\"\r\nconvention, but by an individual United States officer. How the\r\nPresident, who had always so sternly denounced any attempt to prevent\r\nthe execution of the laws, could approve this is difficult to\r\nunderstand. His indignation at the Abolitionists in persisting in what\r\nhe considered an abuse of the freedom of the mails probably blinded\r\nhim to the real significance of the matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson on the use of the mails by the Abolitionists.]\r\n\r\nIn his message of the following December, the President denounced the\r\nmethods of the Abolitionists in sending their incendiary literature\r\ninto the South as calculated and intended to excite a servile war with\r\nall its horrors, and recommended Congress to pass a law prohibiting,\r\n\"under severe penalties, the circulation in the Southern States, {273}\r\nthrough the mail, of incendiary publications intended to instigate the\r\nslaves to insurrection.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun himself moved the reference of this part of the\r\nPresident's message to a select committee in the Senate. Mr. Calhoun\r\nwas appointed the chairman of the committee, and on February 4th,\r\n1836, he brought in a report and a bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Calhoun's report and bill on the subject.]\r\n\r\nIn the report Mr. Calhoun took the ground that the freedom of the\r\nmails was a necessary part of the freedom of the press, and argued\r\nthat, as Congress was prohibited by the first amendment to the\r\nConstitution from passing any law abridging the freedom of the press,\r\nso Congress possessed no power to pass any law excluding mail matter\r\nfrom the mails on account of the character of its contents or\r\nauthorizing such matter to be withheld from the addressees. Mr.\r\nCalhoun's conclusion was that only the \"States\" could make such laws\r\nas would effect these things. He proposed in his bill, therefore, that\r\nno deputy postmaster in any \"State,\" Territory, or district of the\r\nUnion should knowingly receive and put into the mail any printed or\r\nwritten paper or pictorial representation touching the subject of\r\nslavery, addressed to a person or a post-office within any \"State,\"\r\nTerritory, or district in which the circulation of such papers and\r\nrepresentations was forbidden by the local laws; that the officers and\r\nagents of the Post-Office Department should co-operate with the local\r\nofficials in preventing the circulation of such papers and\r\nrepresentations where their circulation was prohibited by the local\r\nlaws; that the matter so detained from transmission by a post-office\r\nofficial should be burned, after one month's notice, if the person\r\ndepositing the same should not claim it within that period; and that\r\nthe post-office officials who should violate these duties should not\r\nbe {274} protected by the laws of the United States against the\r\njurisdiction of the local law and government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clay's criticism of Calhoun's proposition.]\r\n\r\nMr. Clay immediately pointed out the fatal weaknesses of this\r\nproposition. He argued that it attributed to Congress either the power\r\nto adopt the laws of the \"States\" upon subjects in regard to which\r\nCongress itself had not the power to legislate, or the power to pass\r\nlaws in execution of laws which it had no power to make. The argument\r\nwas unanswerable, and the conclusion was unavoidable that if Congress\r\ncould not itself pass a law excluding the Abolition papers and\r\ndocuments from the mail, or forbidding their delivery to the\r\naddressees, it could not enact Mr. Calhoun's proposition. After four\r\nmonths of deliberation the Senate rejected the proposed bill by a vote\r\nof twenty-five to nineteen. Mr. Calhoun thus lost the aid of the\r\ngeneral Government in his contest with the Abolitionists over the use\r\nof the mails chiefly through his exaggerated \"States' rights\"\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The act of Congress protecting the Abolition documents in\r\nthe mails.]\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this victory, the friends of free mails succeeded in\r\nhaving a provision incorporated into the Act of July 2nd, 1836, for\r\nchanging the organization of the Post-Office Department, which ordains\r\nthat any postmaster intentionally detaining any mail matter from the\r\naddressees shall be fined and imprisoned, and incapacitated to hold\r\nthereafter the office of a postmaster in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General results of the struggle over the right of petition\r\nand the freedom of the mails.]\r\n\r\nIt would not be extravagant to say that the whole course of the\r\ninternal history of the United States from 1836 to 1861 was more\r\nlargely determined by the struggle in Congress over the Abolition\r\npetitions and the use of the mails for the distribution of the\r\nAbolition literature than by anything else.\r\n\r\n{275} In the first place, it did more than anything else to make a\r\npolitical party out of the Abolitionists, through the conviction which\r\nit produced throughout the North that the demands of the slavery\r\nsystem in the South would ultimately destroy civil and political\r\nliberty in the North, and it increased the strength of the\r\nAbolitionists an hundredfold in less than four years. The development\r\nand ultimate triumph of this party in the North became inevitable from\r\nthe moment that it was clearly recognized that the preservation of\r\nslavery at the South required and demanded the denial of the freedom\r\nof speech and of the press, and of the right of petition, to the\r\npeople of the North.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it taught the South that there was a growing\r\nparty in the North which was determined to attack slavery at every\r\npossible legal point, and prosecute its warfare at every hazard, and\r\nthat the only safety for the South, with its slavery system, in the\r\nUnion, was to hold at least equal power in the Congress with the\r\nrepresentation from the North. In self-defence the South must secure,\r\ntherefore, the formation of new slaveholding Commonwealths. At the\r\nmoment the representation in the Senate was evenly balanced, but in\r\nthe House it stood against the South, one hundred and forty-one to\r\nninety-nine. One more non-slaveholding Commonwealth, without an offset\r\non the other side, would destroy the balance in the Senate and enable\r\nthe North to undertake legislation hostile to slavery. The extension\r\nof slavery to new Commonwealths was thus manifestly a necessity to its\r\npermanent security, and even continuance, in the Commonwealths where\r\nit already existed. The policy of the slaveholders must be to allow no\r\nnew non-slaveholding Commonwealth to be formed without another\r\nslaveholding Commonwealth to match it, and to secure the {276}\r\nextension of the territory of the United States toward the South.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, it aroused the apprehension of slave insurrection,\r\nby Abolition incitement, throughout the South, and caused thereby two\r\nmarked movements in the South, the one legal and the other social. The\r\nfirst was the legislation sharpening and increasing the police power\r\nof the public authorities over the slaves, for the purpose of\r\npreventing the access of the Abolition doctrines to their minds, and\r\nof preventing communication and intercourse between strangers and\r\nslaves, and between the slaves themselves. The control of the slave by\r\nthe master was thus more and more interfered with by the public\r\nauthorities, for the purpose indeed of aiding the master, which,\r\nhowever, did not alter the fact that from being primarily for the most\r\npart a household affair, slavery was becoming more and more an affair\r\nof the community. This meant no improvement to the condition of the\r\nslave; quite the contrary. The intervention of the whites in the South\r\nwho owned no slaves in the control of the slaves marks an increase of\r\nrigor in the treatment of the slaves. In fact much of the cruelty\r\ninflicted upon the slaves during the twenty years between 1840 and\r\n1860 was executed by non-slaveholders, by virtue of the increased\r\ncontrol assumed by the public authorities over the relation between\r\nmaster and slave, through the local legislation of that period. The\r\nother movement was toward the development of a military caste in the\r\nsociety. The slaveholders, and especially the sons of the\r\nslaveholders, now began to understand that they must unite in military\r\norganization and make themselves the exclusive military class. The\r\nspirit of chivalry and the practices of knighthood were largely\r\ndeveloped during this period, with both their good and their bad\r\nconsequences. On the one side they produced {277} a high-toned society\r\nof proud, noble women, and courtly, haughty men, among the\r\nslaveholders. On the other, they degraded all other classes, both\r\nwhite and black. In fact they degraded the poor whites more than they\r\ndid the blacks. The blacks felt, and were proud of, the increased\r\nimportance of their masters. And, naturally, this spirit and life\r\namong the slaveholding class made the generation which grew up under\r\nthem eager for adventure and war, intensely tenacious of rights,\r\nsensitive to every only apparent discourtesy, and resentful of every\r\nsemblance of interference from without. The War with Mexico, the\r\nfilibustering expeditions, and the Civil War itself, were all national\r\nconsequences of the social development in the South after 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{278}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE BANK, THE SUB-TREASURY, AND PARTY DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN 1832 AND\r\n1842\r\n\r\nJackson and the Bank after the Election of 1832--The Power of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury over the Government Deposits--Removal of\r\nMcLane and Duane--Taney's Report to Congress of December 3rd,\r\n1835--Abuses of Power by Jackson and Taney--The Senate's Censure of\r\nthe President and Secretary of the Treasury--National Republicans Take\r\nthe Name of Whigs--The Cardinal Doctrine of the Whigs--The Change of\r\nthe Deposits, and the Specie Order of 1836--Van Buren's Election and\r\nthe Panic of \"'37\"--The Sub-Treasury Idea--The Establishment of the\r\nSub-Treasury System--The Election of 1840--Whig Legislative Projects\r\nin Regard to the Bank and the Tariff--The Party Treason of Tyler and\r\nthe Whig War upon the President's Veto Power--The Whigs Unable to\r\nEncounter the Questions of Territorial Extension and Slavery\r\nExtension.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the violent agitation of the slavery question, in the middle of\r\nthe fourth decade, came so suddenly upon the nation, it found the\r\ngreat political parties divided upon issues which partook more of the\r\ncharacter of economic policies than that of rights, or of governmental\r\nforms and powers. It is true that the protective tariff, the Bank, and\r\ninternal improvements had been denounced by some persons as\r\nunconstitutional, but neither party held this view of these subjects\r\nat the beginning of the fourth decade of the century. They were\r\nregarded by the two great parties from the point {279} of view of\r\neconomic policy, and were supported or opposed by them on the ground\r\nof conduciveness or lack of conduciveness to the public welfare. More\r\nexactly, the Bank was the chief political issue between 1832 and 1840.\r\nIt was in the conflict between Congress and the President in regard to\r\nthe Bank that the national Republicans took the title of Whigs,\r\nanti-prerogative men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson and the Bank after the election of 1832.]\r\n\r\nAfter the election of 1832 upon the Bank issue, President Jackson,\r\nnaturally for him, regarded himself as the only representative of the\r\npresent will of the people in the Government. The Congress, at the\r\ntime of the election, was, as we know, favorable to the Bank. The\r\nnewly elected members of the House of Representatives would not\r\nassemble for a year probably, and the Senate would probably sustain\r\nthe Bank after that. The President, therefore, resolved to do by edict\r\nwhat Congress would not do by statute--destroy the Bank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The power of the Secretary of the Treasury over the\r\nGovernment deposits.]\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth section of the Bank Act provided that the funds of the\r\nUnited States should be deposited in the Bank or its branches, unless\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury should at any time otherwise order and\r\ndirect. The Secretary of the Treasury was thus impliedly authorized by\r\nCongress to cease depositing these funds in the Bank or its branches\r\nat his own discretion, and was made directly responsible to Congress\r\nin the exercise of this authority, by the provision that he must\r\nreport, so soon as possible, to Congress his reasons for making use of\r\nthe power. The President thus had no direct authority in the matter.\r\nHe could exercise only an indirect control through his power over the\r\ntenure of the Secretary. At this period in the history of the tenure\r\nof office in the United States, the power of removal was regarded as a\r\nprerogative of the President alone.\r\n\r\n{280} [Sidenote: Removal of McLane and Duane.]\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson was within the letter of his prerogative when, in\r\nthe spring of 1833, he removed Mr. McLane, and later, Mr. Duane, from\r\nthe secretaryship of the Treasury. That he did this because of their\r\nrefusal to be controlled by him in regard to the deposit of the funds\r\nof the United States in the Bank and its branches was, legally, no\r\nconcern of anybody else.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taney's report to Congress of December 3rd, 1835.]\r\n\r\nThe new Secretary, Mr. Taney, appointed to succeed Mr. Duane, was also\r\nacting within the letter of his authority when he ceased to make\r\ndeposit of the Government funds in the Bank and its branches, and\r\nreported his action to Congress at the commencement of the session\r\nfollowing the recess of Congress during which he made this change.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abuses of power by Jackson and Taney.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was very questionable whether the President was\r\nnot abusing his power of dismissal from office, in spirit, by\r\nrequiring the obedience of the Secretary of the Treasury to himself in\r\nregard to a subject concerning which Congress had vested discretionary\r\npower in the Secretary, and in the use of which power Congress had\r\nmade the Secretary directly and exclusively responsible to itself. And\r\nit was likewise very questionable whether the Secretary was not\r\nabusing his authority, in spirit, in ceasing, during a recess of\r\nCongress, to deposit the funds of the United States in the Bank and\r\nits branches, when, less than a year before this, Congress had made a\r\nfull investigation of the condition of the Bank and had disapproved,\r\nby large majorities in both Houses, of the President's recommendation\r\nthat the deposits be made elsewhere than in the Bank and its branches.\r\n\r\nSecretary Taney, afterward Chief Justice, to whose legal opinions,\r\ntherefore, great respect must be paid, {281} contended that Congress\r\nitself could not have caused the removal of the deposits without\r\nviolating the contract with the Bank, as expressed in the Bank's\r\ncharter, and that the Secretary of the Treasury alone was exempted\r\nfrom this obligation by the provisions of the contract. The Secretary\r\nalone, he said, could, therefore, act for the welfare of the people in\r\nthe matter, and by the oath which he had sworn upon the Constitution\r\nhe must so act. He declared it to be his conviction that the public\r\nwelfare would suffer by his continuing to deposit the funds of the\r\nGovernment in the Bank and its branches, and that he felt, therefore,\r\nin duty bound to make the order discontinuing the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate's censure of the President and Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate, however, took a different view of the subject. It\r\nconsidered the act of the Secretary to have been done under the order\r\nof the President, and in condemnatory resolutions held the President\r\nresponsible therefor. These resolutions of censure connected the\r\nSecretary with the President, however, by declaring the reasons\r\noffered by the Secretary for the change in regard to the deposits to\r\nbe \"unsatisfactory and insufficient.\" The President made a vigorous\r\nprotest against the Senate's resolution charging him with usurpation,\r\nand flung the accusation back at the body. He certainly showed that\r\nthe Senate had no constitutional power to make any such charge against\r\nthe President; and Senator Benton immediately gave notice that he\r\nshould move the expunging of the resolutions from the journal at every\r\nsession of Congress until it should be accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National Republicans take the name of Whigs.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this conflict, and in consequence of it, a\r\nconflict in principle between the legislative and executive\r\ndepartments of the Government, in regard to the extent of their\r\nrespective powers, that Mr. James Watson {282} Webb, the editor of the\r\n_New York Courier and Enquirer_, began, about February, 1834, to\r\ndenominate, in his newspaper articles, the opposition party to the\r\nPresident, led by Mr. Clay, Whigs. This title signified opposition to\r\nhigh executive prerogative, and approval of strong Congressional\r\ncontrol over the President. The name was gradually substituted for\r\nthat of National Republicans, as the different members and factions of\r\nthe party came together upon the principle involved in the name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cardinal doctrine of the Whigs.]\r\n\r\nIt seemed, for the moment, as if the parties had returned to the\r\ncondition of bands of retainers under the lead of Clay and Jackson\r\nrespectively, but this was more apparent than real. There was a real\r\nand comprehensive question at issue, one of the most fundamental\r\nquestions of political science, the question of parliamentary\r\ngovernment or presidential government in the United States. The\r\ntriumph of President Jackson in this conflict--for the Bank was not\r\nrechartered, the deposits were not restored, and the President was not\r\nimpeached, but the Senate's resolutions of censure were\r\nexpunged--settled that question, and preserved the American system of\r\ngovernment from further following the tendency which, from the\r\naccession of Jefferson to that of Jackson, had been slowly asserting\r\nitself, the tendency toward Congressional control over the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nThe original character of the Whig party explains many important\r\nthings in its composition and subsequent history. In the first place,\r\nit explains why the party was composed, as to its leading element, of\r\nhigh-toned, courteous gentlemen--the larger part of the aristocracy of\r\nthe land--since it is the instinct of the aristocracy to control the\r\nexecutive through the legislature. It explains further why the Whig\r\nparty was unable to {283} cope with the problem of slavery, since its\r\nfundamental principle was not a doctrine of rights, but of\r\ngovernmental form. It explains, lastly, why, in the development of the\r\ncountry's history, the defeat of the Whig party was necessary to the\r\nvery existence of the country, when the great struggle should come,\r\nsince its principle of Congressional control of the Administration\r\nwould, if realized, have greatly weakened that executive independence,\r\npower, and unity, without which victory could hardly have been won.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The change of the deposits, and the specie order of 1836.]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Whigs in the campaign of 1836, and their momentary\r\ntriumph in that of 1840, were experienced under the true issue of the\r\nWhig principle. The modification of the tariff by the Act of 1833, and\r\nthe change of the place of deposit of the funds of the Government,\r\nafter October 1st, 1833, from the United States Bank and its branches\r\nto certain Commonwealth banks, designated by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, had brought about much business embarrassment, since the one\r\ndepressed the manufacturing interests, and the other forced the United\r\nStates Bank and its branches to call in the loans made upon the\r\nstrength of the Government's deposits. This embarrassment was greatly\r\nincreased by the issue of the executive order of July 11th, 1836,\r\ndirecting that only specie should be taken at the land offices for\r\npublic lands. At the moment there was a general speculation in Western\r\nlands, and only those banks which held Government deposits could\r\nfurnish their customers with specie; the others, when called upon for\r\ngold and silver in exchange for their notes, were compelled to\r\nsuspend.\r\n\r\nThe Congress, disapproving the favoritism shown by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, and, probably foreseeing that a financial crisis of some\r\nsort was impending, had, {284} on June 23rd preceding, passed an Act\r\nordering a more general distribution of the deposits than the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury had made. After the specie order, and a\r\nlittle experience with its effect, the demand was raised from every\r\nquarter for an immediate execution of the Act of Congress of June\r\n23rd. The Secretary hastened to carry out the provision, with the\r\nresult of driving those banks into insolvency which had been able to\r\nstand, the existing deposit banks, since they had loaned the money of\r\nthe Government deposited in them, and were compelled to call in these\r\nloans in the proportion that they were called upon to give up these\r\ndeposits, and were left also without the gold and silver of the\r\nGovernment to redeem their own notes. The sudden calling in of the\r\nloans also forced a great number of the borrowers into insolvency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Van Buren's election and the panic of \"'37.\"]\r\n\r\nHad the full force of the financial distress come in 1836, instead of\r\na year later, it might have turned the election against Jackson's\r\nheir, Mr. Van Buren; but as things were, the Van Buren Administration\r\nwas established, and had had an opportunity to get a little foothold,\r\nwhen the financial panic spread over the land. Mr. Van Buren and his\r\nadvisers decided very properly not to involve the Government, but to\r\nlet the people work themselves through the disaster by the natural\r\ncourse of business. This, as is usual in such cases, turned hosts of\r\nsupporters into opponents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sub-Treasury idea.]\r\n\r\nThe Administration, however, pursued the even tenor of its way, and\r\nendeavored to draw the lesson of the experiences with banks as places\r\nof deposit for the funds of the Government. In his message of\r\nSeptember 4th, 1837, President Van Buren recommended that the\r\nGovernment should cut loose entirely from banks, and should keep its\r\nfunds in the {285} United States Treasury, and in branches of the\r\nTreasury, under the control of the officers of the Treasury. The idea\r\nwas not original with Mr. Van Buren. Mr. Gordon, of Virginia, had\r\nsuggested it in the House of Representatives, during the session of\r\n1834-35, and had offered a plan for its realization, in the form of an\r\namendment to the bill, then before the House, for regulating the\r\ndeposits. Mr. Gordon's amendment was rejected on February 11th, 1835.\r\nThe significant thing about it was that the plan was then supported by\r\nWhigs almost exclusively, only one Democrat voting in favor of it. It\r\nis true that only about one-half of the Whigs in the House supported\r\nit, and that it could hardly, therefore, be called a Whig party\r\nmeasure in 1835. On the other hand, it was certainly then opposed by\r\nthe Democratic party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The establishment of the Sub-Treasury system.]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it was a courageous thing in Mr. Van Buren\r\nto take up the idea anew and recommend it to Congress. Not until the\r\nsession of 1839-40, however, was Congress brought to approve the plan\r\nand pass the law of July 4th, 1840, establishing the Sub-Treasury\r\nsystem for the keeping of the funds of the Government. During the\r\ndiscussion of the bill in Congress, its principle developed into a\r\nstrict party question, the Democrats supporting it and the Whigs\r\nopposing it. The Whigs represented the scheme as an attempt to break\r\ndown all the banks in the country, to keep the people's money locked\r\nup in the vaults of the Treasury, instead of maintaining it in\r\ncirculation for their benefit, and to make the President the arbiter\r\nof the business of the country, and thus develop still further his\r\nautocratic power. The Whig protest was a capital piece of demagogism,\r\nand it proved immediately and immensely attractive to the people.\r\nBefore the summer of 1840 wore {286} away it was entirely clear that\r\nthe people had made up their minds to try a Whig administration, and\r\nhad arrived at this resolution under the issue of the financial\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The election of 1840.]\r\n\r\nThe Whig National Convention had met in December, 1839, and had\r\nadopted no platform of principles. It had conciliated the factional\r\ndifferences in the Whig ranks by dropping Clay and nominating General\r\nHarrison, the military hero of the party, and the Whigs were now,\r\ntherefore, free to strike any note in the campaign which would please\r\nthe popular ear. The victory was a clean sweep, and the Whigs\r\nimmediately set about the financial legislation, which was, as they\r\nthought, to redeem the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whig legislative projects in regard to the Bank and the\r\ntariff.]\r\n\r\nThey had attributed the distress in the country chiefly to the failure\r\nto re-charter the Bank and to the reduction of the tariff.\r\nConsequently, they immediately passed a bill for the incorporation of\r\na bank, when, to their dismay and confusion, Mr. Tyler, elected\r\nVice-President, and, upon the sudden death of Mr. Harrison, successor\r\nto the presidential office, vetoed the bill. The leaders of the party\r\nin Congress consulted with the President in regard to a bank bill\r\nwhich would be acceptable to him, and drafted one which followed his\r\nsuggestions in all essential principles, and contained only a few\r\ndivergent details, put in probably for the purpose of preserving a\r\nshow of legislative independence, but the President considered these\r\ndifferences essential and vetoed the second bill. The bills for\r\nsuspending the reductions of the duties met with the same fate, two of\r\nthem being successively vetoed.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bank vetoes all the members of the Cabinet, except the\r\nSecretary of State, Mr. Webster, resigned, and after the tariff vetoes\r\nMr. Webster retired, so soon {287} as the diplomatic negotiations with\r\nGreat Britain, then in progress, permitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The party treason of Tyler and the Whig war upon the\r\nPresident's veto power.]\r\n\r\nThe Whigs regarded Mr. Tyler as a traitor to the party and began a war\r\nupon the veto power of the President. They had come back again to\r\ntheir original principle of government--the supremacy of the\r\nlegislature over the executive.\r\n\r\nFrom this account, it is clearly manifest that the Whig party did not\r\nstand upon any fundamental principle which would enable it to meet\r\nsuccessfully those questions which, after the final settlement given\r\nto the bank and tariff issues by the vetoes of President Tyler, came\r\nto the front--the questions of territorial extension and of slavery\r\nextension.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Whigs unable to encounter the questions of territorial\r\nextension and slavery extension.]\r\n\r\nIt might be thought, at first view, that the Democratic party of that\r\nday was no better prepared than the Whig party to encounter these\r\nquestions, since it, too, had reached its distinctive position through\r\nits attitude in economic issues. But the strength of the Democratic\r\nparty lay in the South, and the South had a strong interest in\r\nterritorial extension for the purpose of slavery extension, which, so\r\nlong as the Southern wing of the Democratic party ruled the party,\r\nwould furnish a clear and definite aim to the policy of the party, and\r\nwould, thereby, give it great advantage over the Whigs, whose Northern\r\nand Southern contingents were much more evenly balanced, and,\r\ntherefore, as to these questions, less able, or, rather, entirely\r\nunable, to gain a position upon which they might make a common stand.\r\nIn a word, as to the Whig party, there was, after 1842, nothing to\r\ntake the place of their overthrown economic policies, while, as to the\r\nDemocratic party, there was territorial extension for the sake of\r\nslavery extension. When {288} these latter questions came to the\r\nfront, therefore, they were destined, sooner or later, to disrupt the\r\nWhig party and destroy it altogether. The whole South would be for\r\nterritorial extension, chiefly for the sake of slavery extension, and\r\na large party at the North would be for territorial extension _per\r\nse_. The opposition to territorial extension must, therefore, become\r\nsectional, and as that opposition came chiefly from the Whig party it\r\nwas the Whig party which would be degraded from its national character\r\nby this question, and then destroyed by it and its attendant question\r\nof slavery extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{289}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTEXAS\r\n\r\nArkansas and Michigan--Florida and Iowa--Texas--The Austin\r\nGrant--Local Government in Texas--The Attempts by the United States to\r\nPurchase Texas--The Texan Revolution--General Sam Houston--San Jacinto\r\nand Independence--The Recognition of the Independence of\r\nTexas--Calhoun's frank Declaration in Regard to the Annexation of\r\nTexas--The Mission of Mr. Morfit to Texas, His Report and\r\nAdvice--Jackson's Recommendation to Delay the Recognition of Texan\r\nIndependence--Jackson's Request of Congress for Authority to Issue an\r\nUltimatum to Mexico in the Claims Question--Texan Independence\r\nRecognized by the United States--The Question of Annexation--Texan\r\nProposition for Annexation--The Mexican Claims Commission and its\r\nWork--Tyler as an Advocate of Annexation--Mr. Webster in the Way of\r\nAnnexation--The Adams Address on Annexation--The Retirement of\r\nWebster--The Promotion of Upshur, and His Negotiations with the\r\nTexans--The Threat of the Mexican Government to Consider the\r\nAnnexation of Texas a Cause of War--The Administration Proposes\r\nAnnexation to the Texan Agent--The Difficulty in the Way of Acceptance\r\nof the Proposition--The Demand of the Texans for Protection in the\r\nInterim--Mr. Calhoun in the State Department--The Treaty of Annexation\r\nSigned--The Treaty in the Senate and its Rejection--Mr. Archer's\r\nOpposition to the Treaty--The New Plan for Annexation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the admission of Missouri there remained as territory, upon\r\nwhich, according to existing law, it was {290} probable that\r\nslaveholding Commonwealths would be established, only Arkansas and\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arkansas and Michigan.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Florida and Iowa.]\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Arkansas was admitted as a slaveholding Commonwealth, and\r\nMichigan as a non-slaveholding Commonwealth, thus keeping the exact\r\nbalance in the Senate. By a compact of the year 1832, the Seminoles in\r\nFlorida had agreed to emigrate within three years to the west bank of\r\nthe Mississippi. At the end of this period, one of their chiefs,\r\nOsceola, repudiated the agreement, and with a large following began\r\nhostilities. By a long and expensive war the Indians were at last\r\nexpelled; and the white inhabitants immediately chose delegates to a\r\nconvention, who met, in December of 1838, formed a Commonwealth\r\nconstitution, one of the provisions of which legalized slavery, and\r\ndemanded of Congress admission into the Union. Congress kept Florida\r\nwaiting, however, for six years, until Iowa was ready, and then\r\nadmitted the two at the same time and by the same Act.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texas.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the events in the Southwest had been so shaping themselves\r\nas to open up prospects for the long desired territorial extension in\r\nthat quarter. The long dispute between Spain and France, and then\r\nafter 1803, between Spain and the United States, in regard to the\r\nterritory between the Rio Grande del Norte and the Sabine Rivers,\r\ncalled Texas, was first definitely settled in 1819, or rather in the\r\nTreaty of that year, between the United States and Spain, which Treaty\r\nwas not executed, as we have seen, until a little later. In it this\r\nterritory was recognized by the United States as belonging to Spain.\r\nIt seems that a few persons from the United States had settled upon\r\nthis territory, while it was disputed ground, and raised some\r\ncomplaint at having been left unprotected by the Government in the\r\nTreaty with Spain.\r\n\r\n{291} [Sidenote: The Austin grant.]\r\n\r\nThe successful rebellion of Mexico against Spain made this territory a\r\npart of the new Mexican state, and before Mexico had had time to\r\nconsolidate its powers or estimate the value of its northern\r\npossessions, a shrewd Yankee from Connecticut, who had removed to\r\nMissouri, and had become well skilled in the arts and practices of\r\nborder life, Moses Austin, went to Mexico, and representing himself,\r\nit is said, as the leader of a company of Roman Catholics, who had\r\nsuffered persecution in the United States, for their religion's sake,\r\nsolicited a grant of land from the Catholic government of Mexico, and\r\npermission to make a settlement upon it. The Mexicans gave ready ear\r\nto his complaints and petition, and made him a large grant of land in\r\nthe central part of Texas on the Colorado River. Mr. Austin died\r\nbefore effecting the settlement, and left the work to his son, S. F.\r\nAustin, who, in 1822, colonized the grant, and received a ratification\r\nof the same from the Mexican Government, the following year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Local government in Texas.]\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Texas and Coahuila formed a single Mexican province,\r\nand, after the establishment of the federal system of government in\r\nMexico, the province became, in 1827, a Commonwealth. In the Coahuila\r\npart the population was Mexican, and as it was much larger than the\r\nAnglo-American population in the Texas part, the government of the\r\nCommonwealth was practically in the hands of Mexican officials. The\r\nrule of these officials was arbitrary and uncertain, and the race\r\nprejudice between Spaniard and Anglo-Saxon was immediately excited by\r\nit. It was pretty evident that the expulsion of the Americans from\r\nTexas was intended. In 1830, came at last the decree from the Mexican\r\nPresident, Bustamente, prohibiting further immigration into Texas from\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n{292} The Texan colonists now numbered some twenty thousand, mostly\r\nbold and hardy men, and it was not to be expected that they would\r\neither give up their lands, or assist in preventing further\r\nimmigration, or submit much longer to the foreign rule, as they felt\r\nit to be, of Mexico or Coahuila.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attempts by the United States to purchase Texas.]\r\n\r\nBoth in 1827 and in 1829, the United States Government attempted to\r\npurchase Texas, and in the latter year the proposition was actually\r\nmade to the Mexican Government to sell to the United States the\r\nterritory lying to the northwest of the watershed of the River Nueces.\r\nIt was, however, promptly rejected by that Government.\r\n\r\nNaturally these attempts encouraged the colonists in Texas to feel\r\nthat the United States sympathized with them in their desire for\r\nemancipation from Mexican rule, and to hope that this sympathy might,\r\nat some future time, lead to positive assistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Overthrow of the federal system in Mexico.]\r\n\r\nThe Texans were, however, for the moment, left to their own devices.\r\nThey first tried to have Texas separated from Coahuila and made a\r\nseparate Commonwealth of the Mexican Union, but the Mexican central\r\ngovernment refused to assent to this. This was in 1833. Two years\r\nlater Santa Anna, the Mexican President, forcibly displaced the\r\nfederal system of government established in Mexico by the constitution\r\nof 1824, and instituted the centralized system, virtually by a\r\npresidential edict.\r\n\r\nSome of the Commonwealths of the Mexican Union resisted this\r\nusurpation of the President, and among them, naturally, was\r\nCoahuila-Texas. Moreover, some of the Coahuila members of the\r\nlegislature of the Commonwealth, partisans of Santa Anna, withdrew\r\nfrom that body, and the Texan members found themselves, for the first\r\ntime, in a majority in it. Of course the feeling {293} of resistance\r\nto the overthrow of the right of local self-government became now a\r\nsettled and resolute purpose with them, and Santa Anna, upon learning\r\ntheir attitude, resolved to reduce them to obedience by military\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Texan revolution.]\r\n\r\nIn September of 1835, a Mexican war-ship appeared upon the Texan\r\ncoast, and its commander declared the Texan ports in a state of\r\nblockade. About the same time, the Mexican General Cos appeared, with\r\na force of some fifteen hundred soldiers, at the Texan village of\r\nGonzales. The resistance of the inhabitants of the town to Cos' order\r\nto surrender their arms precipitated the struggle. The Texans\r\nimmediately organized a temporary government, drove the Mexicans out\r\nof the country before the close of the year, and, on March 2nd, 1836,\r\ndeclared their independence of Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhile the Texan convention, which had declared independence and was\r\nframing the constitution for the state of Texas, was still in session,\r\nthe Mexican soldiery, under the command of Santa Anna himself,\r\nreturned to Texas and committed the atrocities of the Alamo and of\r\nGoliad. After these barbarous deeds there could no longer be any hope\r\nof an accommodation between the Mexicans and the Texans. It was\r\nindependence or extermination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Sam Houston.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: San Jacinto and independence.]\r\n\r\nHappily for the Texans they had now found their proper leader, General\r\nSam Houston. Many of the descriptions of this hero are caricatures. Of\r\nthose which approach the truth, that given by Senator Benton is\r\nperhaps most nearly correct. Benton was the lieutenant-colonel of the\r\nregiment in which Houston served during the war with the Creeks; and\r\nsaid later of his old comrade, \"I then marked in him the same\r\nsoldierly and gentlemanly qualities which {294} have since\r\ndistinguished his eventful career; frank, generous, and brave, ready\r\nto do, or to suffer, whatever the obligations of civil or military\r\nduty imposed; and always prompt to answer the call of honor,\r\npatriotism, and friendship.\" He was a Virginian by birth, but an early\r\nresident of Tennessee, and had been Governor of Tennessee before\r\nattaining his thirty-fifth year. He appeared in Texas in 1833, and in\r\n1835 was made commander of the Texan army. It was chiefly his skill\r\nand bravery, which effected the expulsion of Cos and his army in the\r\nwinter of 1835-36. After the disasters at the Alamo and at Goliad, he,\r\nin command of the remnants of the Texan army, retreated slowly before\r\nSanta Anna's comparatively large force, until Santa Anna made the\r\nblunder of dividing his army by the swollen waters of the San Jacinto,\r\nwhen he turned suddenly upon the Mexicans, and inflicted upon them the\r\ncrushing defeat known as the battle of San Jacinto, in which the\r\nMexican loss was double the number of Houston's army, some sixteen\r\nhundred men, including Santa Anna himself among the captives. The part\r\nof the Mexican army which had not crossed the river retreated\r\nprecipitately from Texan soil, and the new state had won its\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texas as a constitutional Republic.]\r\n\r\nThe battle of San Jacinto was fought on April 21st, 1836. The\r\nconvention had finished the constitution more than a month before. In\r\nSeptember following, General Houston was elected President of the new\r\nrepublic, and the constitution was almost immediately put into\r\noperation. This constitution legalized the existence of slavery in\r\nTexas, as a constitutional right of the masters, prohibited the\r\nresidence of free negroes within the State without special official\r\npermission, and interdicted the importation of negro slaves, except\r\nfrom the United States.\r\n\r\n{295} [Sidenote: The recognition of the independence of Texas.]\r\n\r\nA little more than a month after the battle of San Jacinto, the\r\nlegislature of Connecticut set the ball in motion for the recognition\r\nof the independence of Texas by the Government of the United States.\r\nOn May 27th, 1836, the two Houses of that body passed a resolution\r\ninstructing the Senators, and requesting the Representatives, in\r\nCongress from Connecticut \"to use their best endeavors to procure the\r\nacknowledgment, on the part of the United States, of the independence\r\nof Texas.\" Evidently the Yankee Commonwealth considered itself, in an\r\nespecial degree, the motherland of the new state. The founder of the\r\ncolony, which had now become an independent state, was one of its\r\nchildren, and it hastened to anticipate Virginia, the birthplace of\r\nHouston, in owning its offspring. A careful perusal of the whole of\r\nthis Connecticut document will certainly leave the impression upon the\r\nmind of the impartial reader, at this day, that the people of the\r\nNorth then considered the Texan revolution to have been provoked by\r\nMexican misrule and barbarism, and to have been fully justified in\r\npolitical ethics as well as by practical success.\r\n\r\nOn June 13th, Senator Niles, of Connecticut, presented the Connecticut\r\nmemorial to the Senate, and it was immediately referred to the\r\ncommittee on Foreign Relations. On the 18th, Mr. Clay, the chairman of\r\nthe committee, reported a resolution: \"That the independence of Texas\r\nought to be acknowledged by the United States whenever satisfactory\r\ninformation shall be received that it has, in successful operation, a\r\ncivil government capable of performing the duties and fulfilling the\r\nobligations of an independent Power.\" The resolution was adopted by\r\nthe Senate, on July 1st, without a dissenting voice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calhoun's frank declaration in regard to the annexation of\r\nTexas.]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the debate upon it, Mr. Calhoun {296} frankly\r\ntold the Senate that he regarded the great importance of the\r\nrecognition of the independence of Texas to consist in the fact that\r\nit prepared the way for the speedy admission of Texas into the Union,\r\nwhich would be a necessity to the proper balance of power in the Union\r\nbetween the slaveholding and the non-slaveholding Commonwealths, upon\r\nwhich the preservation of the Union and the perpetuation of its\r\ninstitutions rested. After such a statement it is difficult to see how\r\nanybody could speak of the annexation of Texas being a slaveholders'\r\nsecret intrigue. Mr. Calhoun, the great leader of the slaveholders,\r\nthe director of their policy, here at the very outset openly\r\nproclaimed their purpose. The fact is that, at the time of the Texan\r\ndeclaration of independence, almost everybody would have favored the\r\nannexation of Texas to the United States, out of race sympathy with\r\nthe Texans and desire for territorial extension, except for the\r\ninternational complications with Mexico, which must inevitably result.\r\nIt was the struggle over the Abolition petitions in 1836, 1837, and\r\n1838 which turned the thoughts of men upon the internal questions\r\ninvolved in the movement, and caused the North generally to reconsider\r\nits attitude upon the question.\r\n\r\nOn July 4th, 1836, the House of Representatives passed a resolution of\r\nthe same tenor, and expressed in nearly the same words, as the Senate\r\nresolution of July 1st. It seems to have been called forth by\r\nmemorials from citizens of Ohio and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEXAS, at the Time of Annexation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mission of Mr. Morfit to Texas, his report and advice.]\r\n\r\nAssured thus of the feeling of Congress, the President sent an agent,\r\nMr. Henry M. Morfit, to Texas during the summer of 1836, in order to\r\nprocure exact information of the state of affairs there. Mr. Morfit\r\nwrote to the Secretary of State, Mr. Forsyth, that the {297}\r\nconstitution of March 17th was soon to be put into operation; that\r\nGeneral Houston had been elected President; that the constitution was\r\nfashioned after that of the United States; that the desire for\r\nannexation to the United States was universal; that the boundaries\r\nasserted by the new state were the Rio Grande del Norte on the south\r\nand southwest, the longitude from the source of the Rio Grande to the\r\nboundary of the United States on the west, the southern boundary of\r\nthe United States on the north and northeast, and the Gulf of Mexico\r\non the east; that the population amounted to about sixty-five thousand\r\nsouls, of whom about fifty thousand were Anglo-Americans; that the\r\nstanding army numbered about twenty-two hundred men, and could be\r\nincreased to seven or eight thousand in an emergency; that the navy\r\nconsisted of four vessels, carrying twenty-nine guns; that the funds\r\nof the State consisted of from fifty to one hundred millions of acres\r\nof public lands, worth, at least, ten millions of dollars, and that\r\ncontributions were flowing in from private individuals in the United\r\nStates; that the debt was about twelve hundred and fifty thousand\r\ndollars; that the supplies for the winter campaign were already\r\nprovided; and that there was not a Mexican soldier north of the Rio\r\nGrande, although there were rumors that the Mexican government was\r\nmaking preparations for a new invasion in the winter, which were not,\r\nhowever, credited by the Texans.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a good showing for Texas. If with an army of seven\r\nhundred men, under a provisory government, the Texans drove the\r\nMexicans out of Texas, they could, under well established government,\r\nand with an army ten times as large, most surely keep them out. It\r\nmust also be remembered that Santa Anna was still a prisoner in their\r\nhands. Mr. Morfit, {298} however, expressed the belief that most of\r\nthe men and money for the army came from the United States, and,\r\ntherefore, advised delay in assuming a definite attitude toward the\r\nnew state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's recommendation to delay the recognition of Texan\r\nindependence.]\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson transmitted this information to Congress, in his\r\nmessage of December 21st, 1836, and recommended delay in recognizing\r\nthe independence of Texas. On January 11th, 1837, however, Senator\r\nWalker, of Mississippi, offered a resolution in the Senate to the\r\neffect that it would be expedient and proper to recognize the\r\nindependence of Texas, and stated that he had information that the\r\nprojected invasion of Texas by a new Mexican army, the rumors of which\r\nwere reported by Mr. Morfit, had most probably been abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The question of Mexico's obligations to the United States.]\r\n\r\nBefore the resolution offered by Mr. Walker was taken up for\r\ndiscussion, a message from the President was communicated to Congress\r\nrecommending the passage of an act, authorizing the President to make\r\nreprisals upon Mexico, in case Mexico should refuse another demand\r\nmade upon her for an amicable adjustment of the matters in controversy\r\nbetween her and the United States. The citizens and the Government of\r\nthe United States had many claims against Mexico and the Mexicans for\r\ndepredating the commerce, seizing the seamen, and insulting the flag\r\nof the United States, and the demands for the satisfaction of these\r\nclaims had been almost uniformly disregarded. The relations between\r\nthe two Governments were already greatly strained on this account, and\r\nwhen, in the autumn of 1836, President Jackson authorized General\r\nGaines to advance his troops into northwestern Texas, if he should\r\ndeem it necessary for the protection of the frontiers of the United\r\nStates against the Indians in Texas, who, on account of the {299} War\r\nbetween Mexico and Texas, had been thrown into a great state of\r\nexcitement and unrest, the Mexican Minister, Senor Gorastiza, demanded\r\nhis passports, issued a sort of manifesto to the people of the United\r\nStates, and left Washington.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's request of Congress for authority to issue an\r\nultimatum to Mexico in the claims question.]\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be expected that President Jackson would quietly\r\nbrook such defiance from a half civilized state and its agents. He\r\nimmediately caused Mr. Ellis, the Charge d'Affaires of the Government\r\nat the Mexican capital, to make a final demand on the Mexican\r\ngovernment. Mr. Ellis made his demand in writing, on September 26th.\r\nAfter much delay the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs replied,\r\nadmitting the justice of some of the claims, and requiring more\r\ninformation about others, but offering no reparation at all for\r\ninsults to the flag and to the consular officers of the United States.\r\nThe President's patience was exhausted, and he sent the message of\r\nFebruary 6th, 1837, to Congress, asking for authority to make a final\r\ndemand from the decks of a war-ship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texan independence recognized by the United States.]\r\n\r\nCongress was not, however, willing to invest the President with the\r\ncontingent power to make offensive war. The recommendation of the\r\nPresident in the case had, nevertheless, considerable influence in\r\ndetermining the minds of the Senators in regard to the question of\r\nrecognizing the independence of Texas. On March 1st, 1837, the Senate\r\nadopted Mr. Walker's resolution. On the previous day the House of\r\nRepresentatives had voted to insert in the civil and diplomatic\r\nappropriation bill an item for the expenses of a diplomatic agent to\r\nTexas, whenever the President should receive satisfactory evidence\r\nthat Texas was an independent Power and should consider it expedient\r\nto appoint such a minister. President Jackson had invited this\r\nexpression of the {300} views of Congress in his message of the\r\nprevious December, in which he expressed the view that Congress ought\r\nto determine the expediency of recognizing the independence of Texas,\r\nand, although the resolutions of the two Houses of February 28th and\r\nMarch 1st, 1837, did not formally assume to recognize that\r\nindependence, the President evidently attributed to them some virtue,\r\nsince he soon opened diplomatic intercourse with the Texan agent at\r\nWashington. The resolutions of the two Houses of Congress and this act\r\nof the President, taken together, were regarded by the people of the\r\nUnited States and by foreign Powers as a recognition of Texan\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The question of annexation.]\r\n\r\nIt was clear to all thinking minds that the next step after\r\nindependence would be annexation to the United States. There is little\r\nquestion that Texas was big enough and strong enough to stand alone\r\nagainst Mexico, certainly with the aid which she was sure to receive\r\nfrom without and with the growth which she was destined to enjoy; but\r\nthere was no natural boundary between the United States and Texas, and\r\nthe inhabitants of Texas were chiefly Anglo-Americans. The natural\r\nboundary of the United States on the southwest is the desert between\r\nthe Nueces and the Rio Grande, and the territorial extension of the\r\nUnited States to that limit was simply the fulfilment of the moral\r\norder of the world, which tends to make the lines of states correspond\r\nwith the lines of physical geography and of ethnical differences.\r\nExcept for the connection of the question of slavery extension with\r\nthat of territorial extension after 1836, the question of the\r\nannexation of Texas would have been generally viewed in this natural\r\nand national light. That connection, however, made the North generally\r\nassume the attitude {301} of opposition to annexation, while it\r\ngreatly excited the desires of the South in favor of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Webster on annexation.]\r\n\r\nOn his way homeward from the Congress which voted in favor of\r\nannexation, Mr. Webster made a great speech in New York, in which he\r\ndeclared himself opposed to annexation on the ground that it would\r\nextend slavery. Mr. Calhoun had, nearly a year before, as we have\r\nseen, declared himself in favor of it for the same reason. After these\r\ntwo declarations, from such leaders, the eyes of the people were open\r\nto every feature of the question, and it could not have been any\r\nlonger a matter of intrigue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texan proposition for annexation.]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1837, the Texan agent at Washington, General Hunt, proposed\r\nto President Van Buren the annexation of Texas to the United States.\r\nThe President promptly and firmly declined, and the matter rested\r\nduring the remainder of his Administration.\r\n\r\nThe sudden and unexpected accession of Vice-President Tyler to the\r\npresidency, in 1841, was the event which opened the way for the\r\ncommencement of negotiations for annexation. The new President was\r\nknown to be favorable to the project.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mexican Claims Commission and its work.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the diplomatic relations between the United States and\r\nMexico, so suddenly broken off in the latter part of President\r\nJackson's Administration, had been renewed in the early part of\r\nPresident Van Buren's Administration, and, after considerable\r\nnegotiation in regard to the claims against Mexico, a convention\r\nbetween the two Powers had been arranged, and, on April 8th, 1840,\r\nproclaimed by the President as definitely concluded. The convention\r\nprovided that the claims of the citizens of the United States against\r\nMexico should be submitted to, and decided by, a commission, which\r\nshould be {302} composed of two members appointed by the President of\r\nthe United States, and of two other members appointed by the President\r\nof Mexico; that the commissioners should meet in Washington within\r\nthree months from the date of the exchange of ratifications of the\r\nconvention; that the commission should terminate its duties within\r\neighteen months from the time of its first meeting; and that when the\r\ncommissioners could not come to any decision, the question upon which\r\nthey might disagree should be referred to an arbiter appointed by the\r\nKing of Prussia, etc. With this the question of the private claims\r\nagainst Mexico, already submitted, was, momentarily, put at rest. The\r\nclaim of satisfaction for public injuries and affronts remained\r\nunsettled, and no provision was made for the consideration of private\r\nclaims which had not been submitted before the ratification of the\r\nconvention, or of those which might arise after the same date. Plenty\r\nof opportunities were thus left for the rise of difficulties in the\r\nclaims question which might lead to hostile relations between the two\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tyler as an advocate of annexation.]\r\n\r\nAs early as the winter of 1841-42, it was suspected that President\r\nTyler's Administration was preparing to move in the matter of\r\nannexation. In fact, Mr. Wise, of Virginia, the President's bosom\r\nfriend, and his organ in the House of Representatives, reiterated upon\r\nthe floor of the House, on January 26th, 1842, Mr. Calhoun's doctrine\r\nabout annexation, pronounced in 1836, that the annexation of Texas was\r\nessential to slavery extension, that slavery extension was necessary\r\nto preserve the balance of power between the North and the South in\r\nthe Union, and that the preservation of this balance of power was the\r\nnecessary condition of the perpetuity of the Union.\r\n\r\n{303} Mr. Wise expressed this opinion in the midst of an acrimonious\r\ndebate, and whether he, in an unguarded moment, betrayed the policy of\r\nthe President, or simply gave vent to his own excited feelings, is\r\nstill one of the speculations of American history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Webster in the way of annexation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Adams address on annexation.]\r\n\r\nSo long, however, as Mr. Webster remained at the head of the State\r\nDepartment it was impossible for the President to make any progress\r\nwith a definite plan for annexation, even if he entertained one.\r\nNevertheless, thirteen anti-slavery Whig members of Congress, led by\r\nMr. John Quincy Adams, issued, on March 3rd, 1843, an address to the\r\npeople of the non-slaveholding Commonwealths, declaring that there was\r\na definite plan of annexation already settled upon, and about to be\r\nconsummated, and denouncing the execution of it as being tantamount to\r\na dissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The retirement of Webster.]\r\n\r\nOn May 8th, 1843, Mr. Webster resigned the secretaryship of State. It\r\nwas said by some that the President drove him out, in order to appoint\r\na Secretary who would carry out his plans for the annexation of Texas;\r\nbut Mr. Webster himself indicated by his acts and words that he had\r\ndetermined to resign more than a year before, and had remained in\r\noffice only for the purpose of concluding the negotiations with Great\r\nBritain which culminated in the Ashburton Treaty, an agreement in\r\nwhich Mr. Webster's section had an especial interest.\r\n\r\nThere is little question, however, that President Tyler was glad to\r\nhave him go, for the President placed the annexation of Texas before\r\nevery other policy of his Administration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The promotion of Upshur, and his negotiations with the\r\nTexans.]\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Webster's resignation the President transferred Mr.\r\nUpshur from the secretaryship of the {304} Navy to that of State. Mr.\r\nUpshur was the man whom suspicion had already marked as the confidant\r\nof the President in the annexation scheme. This suspicion was speedily\r\nconfirmed by his entering, almost immediately, upon negotiations with\r\nthe Texan agent at Washington, Mr. Van Zandt, for annexation.\r\n\r\nSoon after the recognition of the independence of Texas by the United\r\nStates, Great Britain, France, and Belgium took the same step,\r\npresumably for the purpose of establishing commercial relations with\r\nthe new state. But, in the summer of 1843, the British Government\r\nappeared in the character of the most favored mediator between Mexico\r\nand Texas for the recognition of the independence of Texas by Mexico;\r\nand a friend of President Tyler's Administration wrote, from London,\r\nthat a representative of the anti-slavery men in Texas was in London,\r\nnegotiating a loan of money from an English company, with which to pay\r\nfor the liberation of all the slaves in Texas, and that the interest\r\nupon the loan was to be guaranteed by the British Government, on the\r\ncondition that the Texan Government would abolish slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Administration professed to credit this story, and Mr. Upshur\r\nwrote to General Murphy, the diplomatic agent of the United States in\r\nTexas, informing him of this communication from London, and arguing\r\nthe double danger to the United States of British interference in\r\nTexas, and of the abolition of slavery there. This letter bears date\r\nof August 8th, 1843, and is considered as marking the beginning of the\r\nactual negotiations for annexation. It was certainly intended to\r\nprompt General Murphy to sound the Texan Government upon the question\r\nof annexation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The threat of the Mexican Government to consider the\r\nannexation of Texas a cause of war.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration proposes annexation to the Texan agent.]\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Government evidently discovered the {305} movement\r\nimmediately, for, on August 23rd, the Mexican Secretary of State\r\ndeclared to Mr. Thompson, the Minister of the United States to Mexico,\r\nthat the Mexican Government would consider any act of the United\r\nStates to annex Texas as a declaration of war on Mexico. For seven\r\nyears Mexico had made no war on Texas, though professing to regard the\r\nnew state as only a rebellious province. In September of 1842, several\r\nmarauding expeditions had crossed the Rio Grande, raided around for a\r\nfew days, and then returned to Mexico. The Mexican Government called\r\nthis a continuance of the war, and demanded that the states of the\r\nworld should observe the attitude of neutrals toward a friendly Power\r\nengaged in suppressing a rebellion on the part of certain of its\r\nlawful subjects. This was absurd. From the point of view of\r\ninternational law Texas had won her independence, and might make what\r\nagreements she pleased with any other Power. The President paid no\r\nattention to the Mexican threat. On October 16th, 1843, Mr. Upshur\r\nformally proposed annexation to Mr. Van Zandt, and in his message to\r\nCongress, at the beginning of the session of 1843-44, the President\r\nindicated to Congress that the negotiations for annexation were in\r\nprogress, and referred to the fact that Mexico threatened war in case\r\nthe United States should resolve to annex Texas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The difficulty in the way of acceptance of the\r\nproposition.]\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty in the way of the negotiations was the fear on\r\nthe part of the Texans that, upon the signature of the Treaty by the\r\nPresidents of the two countries, and before its ratification by the\r\nrespective Senates, as required by the respective Constitutions, the\r\nMexicans would collect all their forces and make one supreme effort to\r\nreconquer Texas. The Texans wanted the {306} protection of the United\r\nStates in this interim, and the embarrassing question for Mr. Tyler's\r\nAdministration was whether the President of the United States had the\r\nconstitutional power to extend it. Would not war, undertaken in\r\ndefence of one foreign Power against another, be offensive war, in the\r\nsense of the Constitution of the United States, such war as Congress\r\nalone can authorize? Or, could Texas be considered a part of the\r\nUnited States from the moment that the two Presidents signed the\r\nTreaty of annexation, and before its ratification by the respective\r\nSenates, thus making war in her defence defensive war, such war as the\r\nPresident of the United States may, of his own power, undertake?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The demand of the Texans for protection in the interim.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January, 1844, Mr. Van Zandt demanded of Mr.\r\nUpshur whether, in case the President of Texas should agree to the\r\nproposition of the President of the United States for annexation, the\r\nPresident of the United States would protect Texas, from the moment of\r\nthis agreement between the two Presidents, against all foreign attack.\r\nMr. Upshur seems to have been greatly perplexed by the question, for\r\nhe made no reply.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of February, the President of Texas caused the same\r\nquestion to be put to the United States agent in Texas, General\r\nMurphy. Murphy was a blunt, brave man, full of chivalry, but quite\r\nempty of constitutional and international law. He immediately returned\r\nan affirmative answer, whereupon President Houston sent a special\r\nenvoy to Washington, armed with plenary power to conclude a treaty of\r\nannexation.\r\n\r\nWhether Secretary Upshur, and, of course, the President, knew of the\r\npromise which Murphy had made for his Government to Texas, before the\r\nsudden death of Mr. Upshur, on February 28th, has never been\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n{307} During the second week of March, Mr. John Nelson, the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, was temporarily transferred to the State Department, and\r\none of his first acts was to officially disavow Murphy's promise to\r\nPresident Houston. He very nearly informed Murphy, however, that\r\nPresident Tyler was personally pleased with what he had done. The\r\nTexan agents at Washington refused, however, to proceed with the\r\nnegotiations until President Tyler would ratify Murphy's promise. Mr.\r\nNelson would not risk his reputation as a constitutional lawyer by\r\ninventing an interpretation of the Constitution which would warrant\r\nthis. At the end of the month Mr. Calhoun was put in his place, and he\r\nwas remanded to the Department of the Navy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Calhoun in the State Department.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of annexation signed.]\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after taking possession of his office, Mr. Calhoun\r\nofficially informed the Texan agents at Washington that the President\r\nhad ordered the concentration of a strong squadron of war-vessels in\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, and had commanded the movement of land forces to\r\nthe southwestern boundary of the United States to meet all\r\neventualities, and that the President would use \"all the means placed\r\nwithin his power by the Constitution\" to protect Texas against foreign\r\ninvasion during the pendency of the Treaty of annexation. On the day\r\nfollowing this communication, the Treaty of annexation was signed by\r\nthe President of the United States and by the Texas plenipotentiary\r\nfor the President of Texas.\r\n\r\nTen days after this, the Treaty was sent to the Senate of the United\r\nStates for ratification. In the message accompanying the Treaty the\r\nPresident informed the Senate of the disposition he had made of the\r\ntroops and naval vessels, and justified the same by the claim that the\r\nPresident _makes_ the treaties, that the Senate only ratifies {308}\r\nthem, that the validity of the treaties, therefore, dates from the\r\nPresident's agreement, and that, therefore, in this case, Texas was,\r\nfrom and after April 12th, 1844, a part of the territory of the United\r\nStates, all of which the President was bound to defend against foreign\r\nattack. Whether this was President Tyler's constitutional law or Mr.\r\nCalhoun's we do not know. If this doctrine is to be ascribed to Mr.\r\nCalhoun it certainly marks a great departure from the general\r\nprinciples taught by him after 1830. One would think that his \"States'\r\nsovereignty\" theory of the Union would have led him to attribute as\r\nlittle power as possible to the general Government, and as much of\r\nthat little as possible to the Senate, but here were both nationalism\r\nand Caesarism combined.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty in the Senate and its rejection.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Archer's opposition to the Treaty.]\r\n\r\nThe Treaty was before the Senate, in secret session, from April 22nd\r\nuntil June 8th, when it was rejected by a vote of thirty-five to\r\nsixteen. It is not necessary to examine the reasons which moved the\r\nNorthern Senators to vote against it, but it is important to\r\nunderstand some of the grounds upon which Senators from the\r\nslaveholding Commonwealths opposed it. Senator Benton declared that\r\nthe Treaty annexed not only Texas but parts of four other Mexican\r\nprovinces, which would be an international outrage upon Mexico. Most\r\nof the Southern Senators, however, were influenced by the fear of war\r\nwith Mexico. But the most significant objection to it, from the point\r\nof view of subsequent events, was that urged by Mr. Archer, of\r\nVirginia, the chairman of the Senate committee for Foreign Affairs. He\r\nclaimed that a foreign state could not be annexed to the United States\r\nby means of a treaty, and that, if a foreign state could become\r\nconnected with the Union at all, it must be by means of an act of\r\nCongress. A large number of the Senators approved of this {309}\r\ndoctrine. It was a pregnant idea to the President and Mr. Calhoun. It\r\nindicated that there was another way to accomplish annexation.\r\n\r\nWhile the Treaty was under consideration in the Senate, the national\r\nconventions for the nomination of presidential candidates had\r\nassembled. The Whigs had nominated Mr. Clay, who was regarded as\r\nopposed to annexation. The friends to annexation in the Democratic\r\nparty had been able to put Mr. Van Buren aside, and had nominated\r\nJames K. Polk, of Tennessee, an outspoken advocate of immediate\r\nannexation, and had made the \"re-occupation of Oregon and the\r\nre-annexation of Texas\" the chief plank in the party platform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new plan for annexation.]\r\n\r\nHere now were all the elements of a new plan for annexation, which\r\npromised more success. They were, the doctrine unwittingly advanced by\r\nMr. Archer, and as unwittingly approved by many of the Senators, that\r\nTexas could be connected with the United States only by means of an\r\nact of Congress admitting her as a Commonwealth into the Union, the\r\nplank of the platform making annexation the chief issue of the\r\ncampaign for the election of a new President and a new House of\r\nRepresentatives, and the connection of the Oregon question with that\r\nof annexation, in order to get votes in the North for both projects at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nOn June 11th, President Tyler took the first step in the combination\r\nof these elements. He sent a copy of the rejected Treaty, and all the\r\npapers connected with it, to the House of Representatives, together\r\nwith a message, in which he reviewed the subject and justified his\r\nposition in regard to it, and declared, finally, that while he had\r\nregarded a treaty as the most suitable means for accomplishing\r\nannexation, he would {310} co-operate with Congress in the use of any\r\nother means compatible with the Constitution and likely to accomplish\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, following the history of the annexation of Texas\r\nfurther, we must present briefly the main points in the development of\r\nthe Oregon question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{311}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nOREGON\r\n\r\nExtent of Oregon and Claims to it--The Nootka Convention--Louisiana\r\nand Oregon--Astoria--The Joint Occupation Agreement of 1818--Spain's\r\nClaims on Oregon Ceded to the United States--Renewal of the Convention\r\nof 1818--The British Policy in Reference to Oregon--The Ignorance of\r\nOregon in the United States--Dr. Marcus Whitman--Dr. Whitman's Mission\r\nto the United States Government--Dr. Whitman's Colony--The Democratic\r\nParty on the Oregon Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extent of Oregon and claims to it.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the eighteenth century, Oregon was universally\r\nrecognized as the territory lying along the North Pacific Ocean from\r\nthe forty-second parallel of latitude to that of fifty-four degrees\r\nand forty minutes, and reaching inward to the Rocky Mountains. At that\r\ntime it was claimed by Spain both by discovery and first settlement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nootka Convention.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1790, Great Britain advanced claims upon it. A diplomatic\r\ndiscussion arose between the two Powers, which ended temporarily in an\r\nagreement called the Nootka Convention, by which no territorial or\r\nsovereign rights or powers were recognized by Spain to Great Britain,\r\nbut only certain easements, so to speak, in and upon this territory,\r\nsuch as the right to navigate the waters and to fish in them, to trade\r\nwith the natives, and to make such temporary {312} settlements as\r\nmight be necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of these rights.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1796, war was waged between Spain and Great Britain, and,\r\naccording to the British principles of that day, every agreement\r\nbetween the two Powers was abrogated in consequence thereof; so that\r\nSpain, while retaining her sovereignty over Oregon, was now relieved\r\nof the encumbrance of the British rights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louisiana and Oregon.]\r\n\r\nThis was the status of Oregon when Spain ceded Louisiana to France in\r\n1800, and when France ceded the same territory to the United States in\r\n1803; and the matter of first concern to the United States was the\r\nquestion whether Louisiana contained Oregon or any part of it. It is\r\nprobable that President Jefferson thought it did, since the Lewis and\r\nClark expedition, sent out by him to examine the new purchase, crossed\r\nthe Rockies, discovered the sources of the Columbia River, followed\r\nthis stream to the Pacific, and made report thereof to the President.\r\nBut if he did, he was certainly mistaken. It is true that Louisiana\r\nhad no western boundary positively fixed by any agreement between the\r\nPowers, but the general principles of international law, to which\r\nrecourse must always be had in the absence of specific agreements,\r\nmade the water shed of the Mississippi the western boundary, and the\r\nTreaty of Utrecht, of 1713, to which France and Great Britain were\r\nparties, made the forty-ninth parallel of latitude the northern\r\nboundary, westward from the Lake of the Woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OREGON, as Determined by the Treaty of 1846.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astoria.]\r\n\r\nThe founding of Astoria, in 1811, on the south bank of the Columbia\r\nRiver, about nine miles from its mouth, is also evidence that the\r\nGovernment of the United States thought it had a claim upon Oregon as\r\na part of Louisiana, since the undertaking {313} proceeded upon an\r\nunderstanding between Mr. John Jacob Astor and the Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The joint occupation agreement of 1818.]\r\n\r\nThe British Government now did a thing which seemed to acknowledge a\r\nclaim of some sort by the United States upon Oregon, so far as Great\r\nBritain could do so. Having taken forcible possession of Astoria in\r\nthe War of 1812, it restored the place, at the close of the War, to\r\nthe possession of the United States; and in a convention, concluded on\r\nOctober 18th, 1818, the two Powers agreed upon the forty-ninth\r\nparallel of north latitude as the boundary between their territories,\r\nfrom the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains, and upon joint\r\noccupation, as it was termed, in all territories and waters claimed by\r\neither party in North America west of the Rocky Mountains, without\r\nprejudice to any claims which either party might have to any part of\r\nthe said territory, or to any claims which any other Power might have\r\nto it, or to any part of it. This agreement was to run for ten years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain's claims on Oregon ceded to the United States.]\r\n\r\nAn event happened the following year which made the Washington\r\nGovernment doubt the wisdom of basing its claims upon the Louisiana\r\ncession. It was the Treaty with Spain ceding the Floridas. As we have\r\nseen in one of the earlier chapters of this work, this Treaty\r\ncontained a provision ceding to the United States all the rights and\r\nsovereignty of Spain in and over the territory lying west of the Rocky\r\nMountains and north of the forty-second parallel of north latitude.\r\nHere was a much better claim, both as to quantity of territory and\r\nquality of right, than could be founded on the Louisiana cession. If\r\nthe United States had possessed this claim in 1803, it is doubtful if\r\nwe should ever have heard of the notion that Oregon was a part of\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\n{314} [Sidenote: Continuation of the convention of 1818.]\r\n\r\nIn 1828, the agreement of 1818 was indefinitely continued, but might\r\nbe terminated by a twelvemonth's notice by either party, at any time.\r\nThe United States, was, however, in a better position than before, on\r\naccount of having now the Spanish claims to all territory above the\r\nforty-second parallel on the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe element of greatest importance in the settlement of the question\r\nwas, of course, colonization within the territory, and neither party\r\nhad really undertaken that. The hunters and trappers and agents of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company had temporary abodes within the territory,\r\nespecially north of the Columbia, and there was one settlement on the\r\nsouth bank under the protection of the United States, and that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The British policy in reference to Oregon.]\r\n\r\nFor some fourteen years longer, now, this indefinite status continued.\r\nIn the negotiations between Mr. Webster and Lord Ashburton, in 1841\r\nand 1842, Mr. Webster sounded Lord Ashburton on the Oregon question,\r\nand found that the Queen's agent had received no power to deal with\r\nthe matter, but drew the conclusion that the British policy in regard\r\nto Oregon was to prolong the existing _modus vivendi_, give the\r\nHudson's Bay Company time to settle the country north of the Columbia,\r\nand then agree to a division on the line of that river.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ignorance of Oregon in the United States.]\r\n\r\nIt was well for the United States that the Oregon question did not\r\nenter into those negotiations, for down to that moment the Government\r\nat Washington knew almost nothing about the character of Oregon north\r\nof the Columbia. The officers of the Hudson's Bay Company had\r\ncontinually represented it as a worthless waste, fit only for hunting\r\nand trapping ground, and almost worn out even for those purposes. It\r\nis more than probable that the {315} Government at Washington credited\r\nthese statements, and it is quite possible that, in 1842, it would\r\nhave compromised with England on the line of the Columbia. The delay\r\nin the settlement of the question now gave the Government the\r\nopportunity to learn something more about Oregon from one who knew the\r\nregion better than any other living man, and whose interests did not\r\nlie with those of the Hudson's Bay Company and Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Marcus Whitman.]\r\n\r\nThe actor who now came upon the scene was Dr. Marcus Whitman, a man of\r\ngreat intelligence, courage, energy, and high purpose. He had been\r\nsent out by the American Board of Missions, in the year 1835, as one\r\nof the exploring delegates among the Indians in Oregon. Dr. Whitman\r\nsoon made up his mind in regard to his life work. He returned to the\r\nEast in the summer of 1836, married, and went back to Oregon,\r\naccompanied by his bride and by the Rev. H. H. Spaulding and wife.\r\nThis was the beginning of the settlement of Northern Oregon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Whitman's mission to the United States Government.]\r\n\r\nIn some way, we know not exactly how, Dr. Whitman learned that the\r\nUnited States Government might be induced to sacrifice Northern Oregon\r\nin ignorance of its true value; and, in the latter part of the year\r\n1842, he set out from the mission on the Walla Walla to go to\r\nWashington and inform the Government of the real character of the\r\ncountry which he had explored. He arrived in Washington in March of\r\n1843, and gave President Tyler such full and truthful information\r\nconcerning the great value of Oregon north of the Columbia as settled\r\nthe fate of that region.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Whitman's colony.]\r\n\r\nDr. Whitman had come also for another purpose. He saw clearly that the\r\nway to get Oregon was to colonize it. President Tyler's Administration\r\nsupported him {316} in this view and purpose. The Administration\r\ncaused Dr. Whitman's descriptions of Oregon to be printed and\r\ndistributed throughout the United States, and also his offer to lead a\r\ncolony to take possession of the country. The place of rendezvous\r\nappointed by him was Westport, near the site of the present Kansas\r\nCity, and the time was June of 1843. Nearly a thousand people, with\r\ntwo hundred wagons, met him there, and were successfully led by him\r\nback to the Walla Walla. He arrived there with this large colony in\r\nOctober of 1843; and news of his safe arrival reached Washington in\r\nJanuary of 1844.\r\n\r\nThe decisive movement for the possession of Oregon was thus made.\r\nClaims based upon discovery, or treaty, or privileges for hunting,\r\ntrapping, or trading, must all give way before actual colonization.\r\nBritish diplomacy was confused by the success of the movement, while\r\nthe people of the United States were filled with pride and enthusiasm\r\nat the achievement.\r\n\r\nThe moment had come, at last, when the United States could deal with\r\nGreat Britain from the basis of actual conditions, instead of from the\r\npoint of view of international theory. The connection of the Oregon\r\nquestion with the question of the annexation of Texas in the\r\nDemocratic platform of 1844, was, therefore, by no means far fetched\r\nor artificial. It was, indeed, a clever stroke of practical politics,\r\nbut it was suggested by existing conditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Democratic party on the Oregon question.]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats had struck a high note in the international questions,\r\none which was bound to catch the ear of the younger men throughout the\r\ncountry. Moreover, the policy in both cases rested upon sound national\r\nprinciples. Texas, at least to the Nueces, and Oregon, at least to the\r\nnorthern water shed of the Columbia, belonged {317} geographically to\r\nthe United States, and they were settled, so far as they were settled\r\nat all, by Anglo-Americans. On the other hand, the slaveholders of the\r\nSouth were not particularly pleased with the connection of the two\r\nquestions. Some of them had already come to doubt whether the\r\nannexation of Texas alone would subserve their interests, since the\r\nslave population might be thereby drawn away from the border\r\nslaveholding Commonwealths, and these Commonwealths might then abolish\r\nslavery by their own several acts; and now that it must be paid for by\r\nthe addition of a region to the Northern side, large enough to hold a\r\ndozen such Commonwealths as New York, the price appeared to them too\r\ngreat. Mr. Waddy Thompson, of South Carolina, the Minister to the\r\nMexican Government, was decidedly of this opinion; and from an\r\noriginal friend of annexation he became a determined opponent. To the\r\nfar-seeing mind, it was certainly very questionable whether the\r\nannexation of Texas would prove any advantage to the slavery interest,\r\nand it was certain that the possession of Oregon would not.\r\n\r\nBut they would subserve, they have subserved, the interests of a true\r\nnational development. The Democrats of 1844 builded better than they\r\nknew, when they made the \"re-annexation of Texas and the re-occupation\r\nof Oregon\" the issues of the campaign of that year. In the platform\r\nthe Oregon question was given the precedence. The country, however,\r\nunderstood the stratagem, and the question of annexation assumed the\r\nforemost place in the great contest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{318}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE \"RE-ANNEXATION OF TEXAS AND THE RE-OCCUPATION OF OREGON\"\r\n\r\nThe Popularity of the Democratic Position, and Mr. Clay's Letter of\r\nAugust 16th--The Abolitionists Declare against Mr. Clay--The Triumph\r\nof Polk--Tyler's Recommendation to Annex Texas by a Joint Resolution\r\nor an Act--The Resolution for Annexation in the House of\r\nRepresentatives--Passage of an Enabling Act for Texas by the House of\r\nRepresentatives--The Resolution in the Senate, and Mr. Archer's\r\nInconsistencies--The Senate's Amendment to the Resolution of the\r\nHouse--The Concurrence of the House in the Senate's Amendment, and the\r\nPassage of the Act for Admission--The British Proposition in Regard to\r\nOregon--The American Proposition--Polk's recommendation in Regard to\r\nthe Matter--The Debate upon the President's Recommendation--The\r\nConclusion Reached by Congress--The President's Retort upon\r\nCongress--The Oregon Treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe language of the Democratic platform signified that Texas had been\r\nonce annexed to the United States, as a part of Louisiana, by the\r\nTreaty of 1803 with France, and had been sacrificed by the Treaty of\r\n1819 with Spain, and that Oregon had been once occupied by the United\r\nStates, either under the Treaty of 1803, or under that of 1819, or by\r\nthe right of the prior discovery of the Columbia River and the\r\nestablishment of a settlement upon its banks. It is thus that mortal\r\nmen always seek to purge any movement which they undertake of the\r\ntaint of innovation, no matter how justifiable in reason that movement\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n{319} [Sidenote: The popularity of the Democratic position, and Mr.\r\nClay's letter of August 16th.]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of June, the election of Mr. Clay seemed a certainty.\r\nAs the campaign wore on it became manifest that annexation was rapidly\r\ngrowing in the popular favor, and that Mr. Clay would lose some of his\r\nSouthern support, unless the opinion which prevailed in that section\r\nconcerning his opposition to annexation should be modified. With this\r\nin view, and under the belief that the state of feeling upon the\r\nsubject at the North had become less hostile, Mr. Clay caused to be\r\npublished in an Alabama newspaper, on August 16th, a letter defining\r\nagain his attitude toward annexation.\r\n\r\nNo sane and impartial mind can, at this day, see any material\r\ndifference between the opinion expressed by Mr. Clay in his letter of\r\nApril 17th, and that in his letter of August 16th. In the former, he\r\ntook the ground that the United States ought not to annex Texas\r\nwithout the consent of Mexico, or against the decided opposition of a\r\nconsiderable and respectable portion of the Union. In the latter, he\r\nsaid he should be glad to see Texas annexed, if it could be done\r\n\"without dishonor, without war, with the common consent of the Union,\r\nand upon just and fair terms.\" He added that he did not think the\r\nslavery question ought to enter into the consideration at all, that\r\nslavery was destined to become extinct in the United States, and that\r\nits duration would neither be lengthened nor shortened by the\r\nacquisition of Texas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Abolitionists declare against Mr. Clay.]\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists, however, could see the question only from a single\r\npoint of view. They wanted Mr. Clay to say that the annexation of\r\nTexas meant permanent slavery extension, and that he opposed it upon\r\nthat ground. They were not satisfied by Mr. Clay's causing another\r\nletter to be published, in the _National Intelligencer_, declaring\r\nthat {320} his two former letters were entirely consistent with each\r\nother, and that he held inflexibly to the principles of the first one.\r\nThey even went so far in their extravagant fanaticism as to represent\r\nto the people that Mr. Clay's election would be more favorable to\r\nannexation than that of Mr. Polk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The triumph of Polk.]\r\n\r\nIt is usually said that Mr. Clay's Alabama letter turned a sufficient\r\nnumber of votes to the Abolitionist candidate, Mr. Birney, to cause\r\nMr. Clay to lose the electoral votes of New York and Michigan, and\r\nthus insured the election of Mr. Polk, and consequently the annexation\r\nof Texas and the War with Mexico. It is probably true that it did\r\ncause the loss of New York and Michigan, but it is possible that it\r\nheld North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee in line. The failure of\r\nMr. Clay is, therefore, more probably to be ascribed to Abolitionist\r\nfanaticism than to his own blundering. At any rate, this was the view\r\nheld by Mr. Greeley, a very competent observer. He said that \"the\r\ntriumph of annexation was secured by the indirect aid of the more\r\nintense partisans of abolition.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tyler's recommendation to annex Texas by a joint resolution\r\nor an act.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the election was regarded as the plebiscite upon the\r\nquestion of annexation, and also upon the Oregon question, but more\r\nespecially upon the former. In his message to Congress at the opening\r\nof the session of 1844-45, President Tyler informed Congress that,\r\nsince the rejection of the Treaty for annexation by the Senate, Mexico\r\nhad threatened to renew war against Texas, and prosecute the same by\r\nbarbarous means and methods, and that he had caused the Minister of\r\nthe United States to Mexico to inform the Mexican Government that the\r\nquestion of annexation was still before the American people, and that,\r\nuntil their decision had been pronounced, any serious invasion of\r\nTexas could not be {321} regarded by them with indifference. He\r\ndeclared that, in the late general election, the people had pronounced\r\nfor immediate annexation; and he recommended that Congress should\r\nincorporate the terms of the late agreement for annexation into the\r\nform of an act or a joint resolution, which should be binding upon\r\nboth parties when adopted in like manner by the Texan Congress. He\r\nalso informed Congress that negotiations had been opened with Great\r\nBritain relative to the respective rights of the two Powers in, and\r\nover, the Oregon territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The resolution for annexation in the House of\r\nRepresentatives.]\r\n\r\nThat part of the message relating to the question of annexation was\r\nreferred, in the House of Representatives, to the committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs, and, on December 12th, Mr. Ingersoll, of Pennsylvania,\r\nreported from that committee the draft of a joint resolution for the\r\nannexation of Texas. It was simply the articles of the agreement of\r\nApril 12th preceding put into that form. The principal points of it\r\nwere, the cession of the territory of Texas to the United States, the\r\ntransfer of the public lands of Texas to the Government of the United\r\nStates, the pledge of the United States to assume the debt of Texas up\r\nto ten millions of dollars, the guarantee of liberty and property to\r\nthe citizens of Texas, now to be citizens of the United States, and\r\nthe accordance of Commonwealth local government to Texas as soon as\r\nconsistent with the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the President and Mr. Calhoun had thought that the\r\nproper way to annex a foreign state to the United States was by means\r\nof a treaty, in which the foreign state should cede its territory to\r\nthe United States; and that the matter of local government for the\r\nceded territory and its population would then be a question of\r\nlegislation. We have also seen that the {322} opponents of the\r\nproposed Treaty in the Senate took the ground, among other things,\r\nthat Texas was already a state, seeking admission into the Union as a\r\n\"State\" (Commonwealth), and that this could be effected only by an act\r\nof Congress. But now the opposition in the House of Representatives to\r\nthe joint resolution, expressed in the very words of the proposed\r\nTreaty, declared that the resolution provided for a cession of\r\nterritory by a foreign state to the United States, which cession could\r\nbe made and accepted only through the form of a treaty. The House had\r\nnever, however, committed itself to the view of the Senate, and the\r\nfriends of the resolution wasted no time in demonstrating the\r\ninconsistency, but sought to so amend the resolution as to make it an\r\nact for the formation of a new Commonwealth, or, as it is usually\r\nphrased, an act for the admission of a new \"State\" into this Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of an enabling act for Texas by the House of\r\nRepresentatives.]\r\n\r\nOn January 25th, 1845, the House passed a substitute for the\r\ncommittee's resolution, which substitute was a resolution for enabling\r\nthe people of Texas to form a Commonwealth constitution and\r\ngovernment, preparatory to admission into this Union, and prescribing\r\ncertain conditions for the assent of Congress to the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The resolution in the Senate, and Mr. Archer's\r\ninconsistencies.]\r\n\r\nWhen this resolution reached the Senate, it was referred to the\r\ncommittee of that body for Foreign Affairs, and on February 4th, Mr.\r\nArcher, the chairman of the committee, presented a report from his\r\ncommittee, and a recommendation that the proposition from the House be\r\nrejected. The ground for this recommendation, as contained in the\r\nreport, was that the House had undertaken to do by an act of Congress\r\nwhat could be done only by means of a treaty. And this was from that\r\nsame Mr. Archer, who, on June 8th preceding, had opposed the {323}\r\nratification of the Treaty, on the ground that what was proposed to be\r\neffected by a treaty could be done only by means of an act of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate's amendment to the resolution of the House.]\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that the Senate or the country would put up\r\nwith any such inconsistent trifling. The Senators were, however, much\r\nconcerned in preserving the treaty-making power of the Senate, and\r\nhesitated long, attempting to find the way out of the embarrassment,\r\nwhich they had prepared for themselves, by their attitude, during the\r\npreceding session, toward the proposed Treaty. At last, on February\r\n27th, Mr. Walker, of Mississippi, offered an apparent method of\r\nescape. He moved to amend the resolution sent from the House by the\r\nprovision that, if the President should deem it more advisable to\r\nnegotiate with Texas for her admission into the Union than to submit\r\nthe joint resolution as an overture to her, he might do so, and then\r\nmight submit the agreements, which might thus be made, either to the\r\nSenate to be approved of as a treaty, or to both Houses to be approved\r\nof as an act. Everybody knew, of course, that this was a mere\r\nsubterfuge to save appearances, and that the President would\r\nimmediately communicate the joint resolution to the Texan authorities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The concurrence of the House in the Senate's amendment, and\r\nthe passage of the measure for Admission.]\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives concurred in the Senate's amendment, and\r\nthe President signed the measure on March 1st, 1845. He immediately\r\nsubmitted the resolution to the Texan authorities, and on December\r\n29th, 1845, Texas was formally admitted as a \"State\" into this Union.\r\n\r\nThere is little question that the President and Mr. Calhoun were\r\ncorrect as regards the manner in which a foreign state should be\r\nannexed to the United States, but they can hardly be justly blamed or\r\ncriticised for {324} following the method insisted upon by Congress as\r\nthe constitutional form and prescript.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The British proposition in regard to Oregon.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The American proposition.]\r\n\r\nIn his first annual message President Polk informed Congress that when\r\nhe came into office he found that Great Britain had proposed to settle\r\nthe Oregon question by making the divisional line between the\r\npossessions of the two Powers, west of the Rocky Mountains, the\r\nforty-ninth parallel of latitude to the northeasternmost branch of the\r\nColumbia River, and, from this point, the course of the river to the\r\nPacific; that his predecessor had refused this; that he himself had,\r\nupon invitation from the British plenipotentiary to make a\r\nproposition, offered the forty-ninth parallel from the Rocky Mountains\r\nto the Pacific, although he believed the claim of the United States to\r\nthe territory up to the parallel of fifty-four degrees and forty\r\nminutes to be good; and that this proposition had been rejected by the\r\nBritish minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polk's recommendation in regard to the matter.]\r\n\r\nThe President further declared that all attempts to compromise with\r\nGreat Britain had failed, and he recommended that Congress should give\r\nthe notice, required by the convention of joint occupancy, for the\r\ntermination of that agreement, as the first step toward asserting the\r\npower of the Government over the whole of Oregon. He also recommended\r\nthe establishment of a line of posts along the Oregon route for the\r\nprotection of emigrants to Oregon, and the immediate extension of the\r\njurisdiction of the United States Government over the citizens of the\r\nUnited States in Oregon.\r\n\r\nThis was distinct enough and belligerent enough. The Abolitionists and\r\nanti-slavery Whigs, who had been twitting the Administration with\r\nindifference about Oregon, now that Texas had been secured, could\r\n{325} certainly find no fault with the President's attitude toward the\r\nquestion. At any rate, it was a challenge to them which could not be\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The debate upon the President's recommendation.]\r\n\r\nBoth Houses entered immediately upon the discussion of the question of\r\ngiving the notice. As the debate progressed the war fever became\r\nallayed, and the conviction grew that the claim to the line of\r\nfifty-four forty was extravagant. The majority, at least, saw that the\r\nclaim by occupation and settlement was the right basis for the\r\ndetermination of the dispute, and that this claim would give the\r\nUnited States the territory only to the line of the northern watershed\r\nof the Columbia.\r\n\r\nThis line does, indeed, reach at points above the forty-ninth\r\nparallel, but the fact that this parallel was already the divisional\r\nline between the possessions of the two Powers from the Great Lakes to\r\nthe Rockies, and that the United States had already proposed to Great\r\nBritain the continuation of this line to the Pacific, produced the\r\ngeneral feeling that the United States should be satisfied with the\r\nforty-ninth parallel as the northern boundary of Oregon, rather than\r\nrisk war for the more northern line. Still, the opponents of the\r\nAdministration had been so quick to charge the President with\r\nindifference to the acquisition of territory, upon which\r\nnon-slaveholding Commonwealths would be established, that they were\r\nnow fairly ashamed to lag behind him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The conclusion reached by Congress.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the course taken by the Senate, Congress did not, however,\r\ncome to any conclusion upon the recommendation of the President until\r\nApril 23rd, 1846, and then, in the resolution finally passed, it\r\nalmost emasculated the President's proposition. It empowered the\r\nPresident to give the notice, but explained that the purpose of the\r\nsame was {326} to direct the attention of the two Governments toward\r\nthe adoption of more earnest measures for the amicable settlement of\r\nthe question, and it threw upon the President the responsibility as to\r\nthe time of giving the notice, by placing that matter entirely within\r\nhis discretion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's retort upon Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe President had already reopened negotiations with Great Britain\r\nupon the subject, and, on June 10th, he laid before the Senate a\r\nproposal, from the British Envoy, of the forty-ninth parallel for the\r\nboundary, and asked the Senate to advise him as to whether he should\r\nclose with the offer. It was not customary to consult the Senate at\r\nthis point of the negotiations, but there was precedent for it, and\r\nthe letter of the Constitution appears to warrant it, and the\r\nPresident was determined to retort upon the Senate, for its action in\r\nthe matter of the notice, by throwing the responsibility upon that\r\nbody of sacrificing the claims of the United States to territory above\r\nthe forty-ninth parallel. He plainly informed the Senate that he would\r\nreject the offer unless advised by it to accept.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Oregon Treaty.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate was fairly caught in its own net, and had the good sense to\r\nrefrain from a resistance which would have been only an undignified\r\nfloundering in meshes prepared by itself. On the 12th, the Senate\r\nadvised the President to accept the British overture. On the 15th, the\r\nPresident signed the treaty, and, on the 18th, the Senate ratified it\r\nby a large majority.\r\n\r\nNot many realized, at the moment, that the extension of the\r\nsovereignty of the United States to the Pacific above the forty-second\r\nparallel of north latitude would require the like extension to the\r\nsouth of it. Once across the Rockies it was inevitable that the\r\nnatural boundary in the southwest, as well as in the northwest, should\r\nbe ultimately attained. It came sooner than anybody expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{327}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR WITH MEXICO\r\n\r\nSlidell's Mission to Mexico--The Failure of the Mission--The\r\nConcentration of the Mexican Forces at Matamoras--The United States\r\nForces Ordered to the Rio Grande--Hostilities Opened--The Battles of\r\nPalo Alto and Resaca de la Palma--The Attitude of Congress toward the\r\nWar--Congressional Approval of the War--The Occupation of New Mexico\r\nand Upper California, and the Advance into Mexico--California's\r\nImportance--The Battle of Buena Vista--Vera Cruz and Cerro\r\nGordo--Contreras, San Antonio, and Cherubusco--The Plan for a Cession\r\nof Territory from Mexico--The Wilmot Proviso--The Fate of the Wilmot\r\nProviso in the Senate--The Proviso Again Voted by the House of\r\nRepresentatives--The Upham Amendment in the Senate--The Amendment\r\nDefeated by the Efforts of Mr. Cass--The Wilmot Proviso Dropped in the\r\nHouse--The Mission of Mr. Trist--Rejection of Mr. Trist's Propositions\r\nby the Mexicans--Negotiations Broken off--Molino del Rey, Chapultepec,\r\nMexico--The Recall of Mr. Trist, and the Treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo--Ratification of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slidell's mission to Mexico.]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the Mexican Government had announced to the\r\nGovernment of the United States that the annexation of Texas would be\r\nregarded by Mexico as a _casus belli_. Consequently, as soon as the\r\nmatter was concluded, the Mexican Envoy left Washington, and all\r\ndiplomatic relations between the two Powers were suspended. Some six\r\nmonths later, President Polk made overtures for the resumption of\r\nthese relations, and, upon meeting a somewhat friendly response,\r\ncommissioned Mr. John Slidell, of Louisiana, to go to Mexico and\r\nnegotiate a treaty, which should settle all the differences between\r\nthe two Powers.\r\n\r\n{328} Mr. Slidell arrived at Vera Cruz on November 30th, 1845, and\r\nfound that President Herrera's Administration was afraid to receive\r\nhim, because the military or war party in Mexico, led by General\r\nParedes, was greatly excited by the attitude of the Administration\r\ntoward the United States, and threatened revolution. The Mexican\r\nGovernment actually refused audience to Mr. Slidell, on December 21st.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of the mission.]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year, President Herrera gave way to General\r\nParedes, who assumed the presidency of the Republic, and, under\r\ndirection from President Polk, Mr. Slidell announced himself to the\r\nnew Administration. This was March 1st, 1846. On the 12th, he received\r\nthe refusal of the Paredes Government to give him audience, and\r\nimmediately left Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The concentration of the Mexican forces at Matamoras.]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1845, the Mexican Government had begun to collect\r\ntroops and munitions of war at Matamoras, on the south bank of the Rio\r\nGrande near its mouth. The purpose of all this was without question an\r\nexpedition across the Rio Grande, and into the region north of it.\r\n\r\nBy an act of the Texan Congress, of December 19th, 1836, the Rio\r\nGrande was designated as the southwestern boundary of Texas. The\r\nUnited States took Texas with this boundary, reserving in the\r\nresolution of annexation the right of adjusting the Texan boundaries\r\nwith foreign states. This meant, of course, that the United States\r\nmight change the boundary which Texas had given herself, as the result\r\nof her successful rebellion, her revolution, against Mexico, by an\r\nagreement with Mexico, in so far as Texas was concerned. It further\r\nmeant that any such change must be made either by an act of the\r\nCongress of the United States or by a treaty between the United States\r\nand Mexico. Until, {329} however, this adjustment should take place,\r\nit was the duty of the President of the United States to defend the\r\nboundary with which Texas came into the Union. Moreover, Congress had\r\npassed an act, on December 31st, 1845, in which Corpus Christi, a town\r\nsituated on the south side of the river Nueces, was made an United\r\nStates port of delivery. The town was, also, the head-quarters of the\r\nUnited States army in Texas, and had been so from the period of\r\nannexation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The United States forces ordered to the Rio Grande.]\r\n\r\nWhen now the Mexican Government refused to receive Mr. Slidell, and\r\ncontinued to increase the forces at Matamoras, President Polk felt it\r\nto be his duty to defend the line of the Rio Grande. On January 13th,\r\nhe ordered General Taylor, then in command at Corpus Christi, to\r\nadvance to the northern bank of the Rio Grande. The General, with his\r\nlittle army of about 2,000 men, arrived upon the Rio Grande, at a\r\npoint opposite Matamoras, on March 28th, and began fortifying his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hostilities opened.]\r\n\r\nOn April 12th, the Mexican commander, General Ampudia, demanded the\r\nwithdrawal of Taylor's forces within twenty-four hours, and their\r\nretirement across the Nueces, under threat of the appeal to arms.\r\nTaylor paid no attention to the demand, and, on the 24th, he received\r\nnotice from General Arista, the successor of Ampudia, that hostilities\r\nwere opened.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, a reconnoitring party of United States dragoons\r\nencountered a large detachment of Mexican soldiers, who had just\r\ncrossed the river farther up, and were all killed or captured. General\r\nTaylor moved out from Fort Brown, opposite Matamoras, in order to\r\ncover his base of supplies at Point Isabel, and, having accomplished\r\nthis, faced about again to relieve Fort Brown against assault from\r\nMatamoras. {330} While executing this movement he found himself, on\r\nMay 8th, face to face with a Mexican army numbering three times as\r\nmany men as his own. Nevertheless, he inflicted a crushing defeat upon\r\nthe Mexicans in this battle of Palo Alto, and struck them again the\r\nnext day at Resaca de la Palma, routing them completely, and driving\r\nthe remnants of this once apparently formidable force across the Rio\r\nGrande.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of these events reached Washington, the President\r\ninformed Congress of them, claimed that war existed by the act of\r\nMexican invasion, and asked for the means for its successful\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attitude of Congress toward the war.]\r\n\r\nFrom the reception of this message to the end of the War, the Whigs in\r\nboth Houses condemned the War, but only a few of them voted against\r\nfurnishing the means for its prosecution. Strangely enough, they were\r\naided by Mr. Calhoun, who opposed the whole war policy from the\r\nbeginning to the end. He even opposed recognizing the existence of\r\nwar. He was getting old and more peaceable in disposition, and also\r\nhad probably seen, with Mr. Thompson, that any further slavery\r\nextension toward the Southwest meant the extinction of slavery in the\r\nborder Commonwealths, and the greater exposure of the planting section\r\nto the influences of Abolition. Some of the Whigs claimed that if war\r\nexisted at all, it was offensive war, and that the President had\r\nexceeded his constitutional powers in bringing it on, and should be\r\nimpeached for so doing.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this proposition depended, of course, upon the\r\nrecognition by the United States of Mexico's title to the territory\r\nbetween the Rio Grande and the Nueces, or, at least, upon the\r\nrecognition of it as a free zone, a proposition difficult to reconcile\r\nwith the Acts {331} of Congress annexing Texas, and extending the\r\nrevenue laws of the United States over this very district. The fact\r\nis, it was a defensive war at the outset, and if the Mexicans were\r\nexcited to their move across the Rio Grande by the appearance of\r\nUnited States troops on the northern bank, they had only to thank\r\nthemselves for bringing them there by previously massing their own\r\ntroops on the south bank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congressional approval of the war.]\r\n\r\nOf course the Abolitionists could see nothing in the matter but a\r\nwicked scheme for the extension of slavery. Their attitude was,\r\nhowever, too narrow and bigoted to win much attention. And, as the\r\ndebate on the President's message progressed, it became manifest that\r\nall the elements of the opposition were getting deeper and deeper into\r\nthe quicksands. The bill for recognizing the existence of war, and\r\nauthorizing the President to call for 50,000 volunteers, and for\r\nappropriating $10,000,000 to defray the expenses of the campaign, was\r\npassed by an overwhelming majority, in both Houses, on May 11th and\r\n12th, and approved by the President on the 13th.\r\n\r\nThe President was now, certainly, authorized to carry the War into\r\nMexico, if, indeed, he needed Congressional authority, at all, after\r\nthe war had been once begun as defensive war. At any rate, General\r\nTaylor's occupation of Matamoras did not occur until May 18th, six\r\ndays after Congress had recognized war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The occupation of New Mexico and Upper California, and the\r\nadvance into Mexico.]\r\n\r\nThe President now ordered General Kearny to occupy New Mexico,\r\nCommodores Sloat and Stockton to make sure of Upper California, and\r\nGeneral Taylor to prosecute the war upon Mexican soil. Kearny, Sloat,\r\nand Stockton quickly accomplished the work assigned them, and without\r\nmuch difficulty, and Taylor advanced, in September, from Matamoras\r\nupon Monterey. After a {332} three days siege, he captured the place,\r\non the 24th, and established winter-quarters within its walls.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, General Kearny sent Colonel Doniphan with a\r\ndetachment of his army to Monterey, by way of Chihuahua, and marched\r\nhimself with another detachment to San Diego in California. Doniphan's\r\ncapture of Chihuahua brought the entire southern valley of the upper\r\nRio Grande under the military control of the United States, and\r\nKearny's successful march into California secured that territory\r\nagainst all eventualities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: California's importance.]\r\n\r\nThe occupation of California was the matter of most vital importance\r\nto the United States. It is the way to Asia. Its government by Mexico\r\nwas a farce. It would have been purchased or seized by Great Britain,\r\nor some other commercial Power, if the United States had not taken\r\npossession of it. Nothing was known of its vast mineral wealth at the\r\ntime. Mere greed, therefore, did not prompt the movement. It was a\r\ngreat and correct stroke of public policy, supported by geographical,\r\ncommercial, and political reasons.\r\n\r\nStill Mexico would not yield, and the Administration at Washington now\r\ndetermined to carry the war into the very vitals of the Mexican state.\r\nThe campaign against the Mexican capital, by way of Vera Cruz, was now\r\nresolved on, and General Scott was directed to execute it.\r\n\r\nSanta Anna, who had now arrived in Mexico again from Cuba, and had\r\nagain taken up the reins of government, thought that the army of\r\nGeneral Scott would be unable to capture Vera Cruz without a long and\r\npainful siege, and planned to advance rapidly from the capital with\r\nthe main body of his army to the north, crush Taylor, and return to\r\nthe capital before Scott could pass Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle of Buena Vista.]\r\n\r\nOn February 20th, 1847, General Taylor, whose advance was now some\r\nhundred miles to the southwest of {333} Monterey, suddenly discovered\r\na large Mexican force in front of him. It was Santa Anna, with about\r\ntwenty thousand of his best troops. Taylor ordered his little army of\r\nabout five thousand men to retire for a few miles, and take position\r\non the rising ground at Buena Vista. The Mexicans soon caught up, and\r\non the 23rd, Santa Anna demanded unconditional surrender. Taylor\r\npromptly declined, and the battle immediately opened. Both sides knew\r\nthe serious character of the wager. California, New Mexico, and,\r\nperhaps, a large part of Texas were staked upon the issue. Before the\r\nday closed, Taylor and his little army had won a complete victory, and\r\nthe Mexicans were in full retreat, after the loss of some two thousand\r\nmen. Taylor lost about eight hundred men. With this the campaign in\r\nthe north was closed, and attention turned almost exclusively to the\r\noperations of General Scott.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vera Cruz and Cerro Gordo.]\r\n\r\nOn March 9th, General Scott effected a landing near Vera Cruz, and on\r\nthe 29th captured that city. He immediately took up his line of march\r\nfor the city of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe first great difficulty which he was compelled to encounter was,\r\nnaturally, the forcing of the mountain pass of Cerro Gordo, through\r\nwhich the national road from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico led.\r\nSanta Anna had gathered here an army of some fifteen thousand men, and\r\nhad thrown up strong earthworks commanding the defile. On the morning\r\nof April 18th, General Scott stormed the heights of Cerro Gordo, and\r\nin a sanguinary battle routed the Mexicans completely. Some three\r\nthousand Mexicans were captured, with five thousand muskets and\r\nforty-three pieces of artillery. Scott's loss was not over four\r\nhundred men. Jalapa, Perote, and Puebla fell into his hands as the\r\nimmediate consequences of this victory.\r\n\r\n{334} General Scott rested his army for two months at Puebla, and in\r\nthe beginning of August resumed his march upon the capital, with an\r\narmy of about eleven thousand men. On the 18th, he arrived within ten\r\nmiles of the city, and found himself confronted by an army of nearly\r\nthirty thousand men, commanded by President Santa Anna himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contreras, San Antonio, and Cherubusco.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 19th, the struggle began, and lasted through the\r\n20th. Three distinct battles were fought--Contreras, San Antonio, and\r\nCherubusco. The Mexicans outnumbered Scott's army three to one, and\r\nfought desperately to save their capital, but all to no avail. After\r\nkilling, wounding, and capturing between seven and eight thousand\r\nMexicans, General Scott dispersed the remainder of their army and\r\nopened his way into the city. The General was willing, however, to\r\nsave the proud Mexicans from the humiliation of seeing their capital\r\nin the hands of the invader, and agreed to an armistice for the\r\npurpose of negotiating a peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The plan for a cession of territory from Mexico.]\r\n\r\nOn August 8th, 1846, President Polk had asked of Congress that two\r\nmillions of dollars be placed at his disposal for use in negotiating a\r\ntreaty of peace with Mexico. It was quite evident from this that the\r\nPresident was going to demand a large cession of territory from\r\nMexico. Mexico had not yet paid any of the claims awarded by the\r\nClaims Commission of 1840 to the citizens of the United States. There\r\nwere also millions of dollars of claims unadjudged. And then there was\r\nthe war indemnity, which would undoubtedly be required. Two millions\r\nof dollars, in addition to all this, to be paid by the victorious\r\nparty for peace, could mean nothing less, or other, than a vast\r\nterritorial cession from the vanquished. It was evident to all that\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico, already in the possession of {335} the\r\nUnited States, must constitute the sacrifice which Mexico must make.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wilmot Proviso.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fate of the Wilmot Proviso in the Senate.]\r\n\r\nMr. McKay, of North Carolina, immediately introduced into the House of\r\nRepresentatives a bill making the appropriation asked by the\r\nPresident. Discussion upon the bill was scarcely under way, when a\r\nNorthern Democrat, a supporter of the War and of the policy of\r\nterritorial extension, Mr. David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, moved to\r\namend the bill by inserting in it the condition that neither slavery\r\nnor involuntary servitude should exist in any territory acquired by\r\ntreaty from Mexico. The House passed the bill, with the Wilmot\r\nproviso, as it was termed, on the day of its introduction, August 8th.\r\nTerritorial extension, but not slavery extension, was its principle,\r\nand therefore the South voted almost solidly against it. The bill\r\nappeared in the Senate on the 10th, which was the last day of the\r\nsession, and was still under discussion when the hour for the\r\nadjournment of the body _sine die_ arrived. It was thought by some\r\ncompetent judges that the Senate would have passed the bill, if it had\r\nthen come to a vote, and would have thus settled, at the outset, the\r\nquestion of slavery extension; but this is at least doubtful. At the\r\nmoment, the South had four more votes in the Senate than the North,\r\nand it is probable that the Whig Senators from the South would have\r\nunited with their Democratic brethren upon this question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Proviso again voted by the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the session of 1846-47, the President again\r\npreferred his request for an appropriation for the same purpose, and\r\nduring the month of January, 1847, bills were introduced into the two\r\nHouses, providing an appropriation of three millions of dollars for\r\nthe President's use in his negotiations with Mexico.\r\n\r\n{336} When the House took up its bill for consideration, on February\r\n1st, Mr. Wilmot immediately asked permission to move the attachment of\r\nhis proviso to the appropriation, and made a strong argument in favor\r\nof the same. On the 15th, the proviso was again voted, but by a\r\nreduced majority. The members from the South voted, this time, solidly\r\nagainst it. A few Northern Democrats voted with them; among these was\r\nStephen A. Douglas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Upham amendment in the Senate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The amendment defeated by the efforts of Mr. Cass.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wilmot Proviso dropped in the House.]\r\n\r\nOn March 1st, Senator Upham, of Vermont, introduced an amendment to\r\nthe Senate bill, of the same tenor as the Wilmot proviso in the House,\r\nand urged its adoption in a strong and convincing argument. It really\r\nseemed as if the victory for Free-soil in the new acquisitions,\r\nwhatever they might be, was about to be won, when, to the surprise of\r\nat least a considerable number of the Senators, General Cass, of\r\nMichigan, who was thought to have indicated his favor to the Wilmot\r\nproviso at the last session, made a determined effort against Mr.\r\nUpham's motion. Mr. Cass declared the measure premature, and contended\r\nthat its only effect, if passed, at the moment would be to weaken the\r\nGovernment by internal dissensions upon the slavery question, and\r\nconsequently encourage the Mexicans to continue the War. He urged the\r\nSenators to stand solidly together for the vigorous prosecution of the\r\nWar to its successful close, and then, after the peace, take up the\r\ninternal questions arising out of the settlement. The Senate rejected\r\nMr. Upham's amendment, passed the bill without it, and, on the last\r\nday of the session, the House accepted the bill as it passed the\r\nSenate. Mr. Cass's idea that the anti-slavery proviso would embarrass\r\nthe President in his negotiations with Mexico, and would {337}\r\nencourage the Mexicans to continue the War seems to have convinced the\r\nHouse as well as the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALIFORNIA AND NEW MEXICO in 1850.]\r\n\r\nThe President had now the tacit consent of Congress to the acquisition\r\nof California and New Mexico, and the means to pay for them in hand.\r\nAnd the greater military successes of General Scott from Vera Cruz to\r\nthe Mexican capital prepared the way for the President to make use of\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mission of Mr. Trist.]\r\n\r\nThe President sent Mr. N. P. Trist, of Virginia, to the head-quarters\r\nof General Scott with the draft of a treaty to be offered the Mexican\r\nGovernment. It designated the Rio Grande from the Gulf to the point\r\nwhere the River touched the line of New Mexico as the boundary between\r\nMexico and the United States from the Gulf to that point, and provided\r\nfor the cession of New Mexico and the Californias to the United\r\nStates, and the privilege of the right of way across the Isthmus of\r\nTehuantepec. Mr. Trist was instructed, however, that he might withdraw\r\nthe demands for Lower California and for the right of way across the\r\nIsthmus, and might also offer a payment of money, if he should find\r\nthese things necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rejection of Mr. Trist's propositions by the Mexicans.]\r\n\r\nAfter the armistice of August 24th, the Mexican Government sent\r\ncommissioners to meet Mr. Trist. They promptly rejected Mr. Trist's\r\npropositions, and offered, as their ultimatum, the Nueces boundary,\r\nthe cession of Upper California above the thirty-seventh parallel of\r\nlatitude for a pecuniary consideration, the payment by the United\r\nStates of an indemnity for private injuries inflicted by the United\r\nStates troops during the invasion, etc. Nothing, moreover, was said in\r\ntheir offer concerning the claims of the citizens of the United States\r\nagainst Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Negotiations broken off. Molino del Rey, Chapultepec,\r\nMexico.]\r\n\r\nThe proposals were so far apart, and the Mexicans {338} bore\r\nthemselves with so much arrogance, that the negotiations were broken\r\noff, the armistice was terminated, and General Scott resumed military\r\noperations. On September 8th, he inflicted a crushing defeat upon the\r\nMexicans at Molino del Rey. On the 13th, he stormed successfully the\r\nheights of Chapultepec and two gates of the city. And on the 14th, he\r\ncaptured the city.\r\n\r\nPresident Polk now recalled Mr. Trist, and informed Congress of the\r\nfailure of the negotiations, at the same time intimating that the\r\npolicy of the Administration would be war _a outrance_. The opposition\r\nto the Administration in Congress declared that the total\r\ndismemberment of the Mexican Republic was intended, and raised their\r\nvoices against it. The outcry helped the Administration, in that it\r\ncalled the attention of the Mexicans to the great danger they were\r\nincurring in not accepting the terms of peace which had been offered\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The recall of Mr. Trist, and the Treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo.]\r\n\r\nMr. Trist did not, however, return to the United States, but waited in\r\nand around the City of Mexico for something to turn up. It seems that\r\nhe did not even acquaint the Mexican Government with the fact of his\r\nrecall. In the latter part of January, 1848, the Mexican commissioners\r\napproached him, and, on February 2nd, they signed with him, at\r\nGuadalupe Hidalgo, a treaty of peace, which provided for the Rio\r\nGrande boundary between the two Powers, the cession of New Mexico and\r\nUpper California to the United States, the payment of $15,000,000 by\r\nthe United States to Mexico, and the assumption by the United States\r\nof all the obligations of Mexico to citizens of the United States\r\nincurred before the conclusion of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ratification of the Treaty.]\r\n\r\nMr. Trist immediately took the proposed Treaty to {339} Washington,\r\nand President Polk immediately laid it before the Senate for\r\nratification. After three weeks of determined opposition by Senators\r\nfrom both parties and both sections, ratification was voted by the\r\nrequisite two-thirds majority, on March 16th, 1848. With this the\r\nwhole political energy of the nation was turned away from the\r\ninternational question to the internal questions involved in the\r\norganization of the vast territorial empire upon the Pacific, which\r\nhad now been added to the United States by the Treaties with Great\r\nBritain and Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{340}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF OREGON TERRITORY AND THE COMPROMISE OF 1850\r\n\r\nBills for Oregon Territory--Thirty-six Degrees and Thirty Minutes to\r\nthe Pacific--Mr. Rhett on the Rights of the South in the\r\nTerritories--The Third Oregon Bill--The Party Platforms of 1848--The\r\nPresident Urges the Organization of California and New Mexico--Mr.\r\nClayton's Attempt at Compromise--Passage of the Oregon Bill by\r\nCongress--The Free-soil Party in 1848--The President's Approval of the\r\nOregon Bill--Gold and Silver in California--The Election of Taylor,\r\nand the Disaffection of the Northern Democrats--Plans for the\r\nOrganization of California and New Mexico--The House Bill for the\r\nTerritorial Organization of Upper California--Mr. Walker's Scheme in\r\nthe House--Mr. Webster and Mr. Berrien on the Status of Slavery in the\r\nTerritory Acquired from Mexico--Emigration to California--President\r\nTaylor's Scheme--The Convention at Monterey--The Policy of the\r\nAdministration--The Policy of the Slavery Extensionists--The Elements\r\nof the Slavery Question in Congress--Mr. Clay's Plan of\r\nCompromise--Objections to Mr. Clay's Plan--California's Application\r\nfor Admission--Mr. Calhoun's Last Speech--Mr. Webster's March 7th\r\nSpeech--Mr. Bell's Proposition--The Death of Mr. Calhoun--Mr. Foote's\r\nMotion and the Committee of Thirteen--The Report and Recommendations\r\nof the Committee--The Debate Upon the Bills Proposed by the Committee,\r\nand the Failure to Pass Them--The Temper of the Country--The\r\nSuccession of Fillmore and His Message of August 6th--The Passage of\r\nBills, Separately, Covering All Questions Contained in Mr. Clay's\r\nCompromise Measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First bill for Oregon Territory.]\r\n\r\nOn August 6th, 1846, Mr. Douglas, of Illinois, chairman of the\r\ncommittee on Territories, asked the House {341} of Representatives to\r\nconsider a bill prepared by that committee for the organization of\r\nOregon as a Territory. The House consented, and immediately upon the\r\nsecond reading of the bill, Mr. Thompson, of Pennsylvania, a Democrat\r\nand friend of the Administration, moved to amend the bill by the\r\nprovision \"that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever\r\nexist in said Territory, except for crimes, whereof the party shall\r\nhave been duly convicted.\" The amendment was adopted by a very large\r\nmajority, and the bill, as thus amended, was passed. On the following\r\nday, the bill was presented in the Senate, and referred by that body\r\nto its Judiciary committee, which committee did not report the bill\r\nduring the session.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second bill.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the next session, Mr. Douglas introduced a new\r\nbill for the same purpose. This bill virtually contained the Thompson\r\namendment in the proviso that all the restrictions in the Ordinance of\r\n1787, in regard to the Northwest Territory, should apply to Oregon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes to the Pacific.]\r\n\r\nOn January 12th, 1847, Mr. Burt, of South Carolina, moved to insert\r\nbefore this proviso the words, \"inasmuch as the whole of the said\r\nTerritory lies north of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north\r\nlatitude, known as the line of the Missouri Compromise.\" The purpose\r\nof this was, of course, to commit Congress and the North to that line\r\nto the Pacific. This was so evident that the Northern members voted\r\nthe amendment down. We can, however, hardly charge the invention of\r\nthis idea to the South Carolinian. On August 8th preceding, Mr. Wick,\r\nof Indiana, had moved to amend the Wilmot proviso, so as to make it\r\nread, that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should exist, in\r\nany territory {342} acquired from Mexico _north of thirty-six degrees\r\nand thirty minutes_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Rhett on the rights of the South in the Territories.]\r\n\r\nIt was during the debate on this bill, just after Mr. Burt's amendment\r\nhad been rejected, that Mr. Rhett, of South Carolina, made his noted\r\nspeech, in which the new view, which the South was now beginning to\r\ntake upon the rights of the two sections in the Territories, was first\r\npronounced. That view was, briefly expressed, that the \"States\" were\r\njoint owners of the Territories, and \"co-Sovereigns\" in them; that the\r\ngeneral Government was only the agent of the \"States\" therein, and had\r\nonly the power \"to dispose of, and make all needful rules and\r\nregulations respecting the territory, or other property of the United\r\nStates,\" from which power, the power to determine in what property\r\nshould consist within the Territories could not be derived; and that\r\nthe \"ingress of the citizen\" of any \"State\" into any Territory, \"is\r\nthe ingress of his Sovereign,\" his \"State,\" who is bound to protect\r\nhim in his settlement.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhett qualified this conclusion by saying that it did not mean\r\nthat each \"State\" should set up government in the Territories over its\r\ncitizens immigrating into them, but that it meant that the citizens of\r\neach \"State\" should have equal right to enter the Territories and\r\nsettle and occupy them with their property, with whatever was\r\nrecognized as property by their respective \"States.\" Stated more\r\nclearly, it meant that the general Government must execute the laws of\r\neach \"State;\" defining and protecting property, in each Territory of\r\nthe Union--of each \"State\" from which citizens had emigrated into the\r\nTerritory concerned--and must execute these several \"State\" laws over\r\nthe immigrants from the several \"States\" separately.\r\n\r\n{343} In plain, blunt Anglo-Saxon, it meant that the general\r\nGovernment must recognize and protect, as property, in any Territory,\r\nanything which was so recognized and protected by any \"State\" of the\r\nUnion. It meant the establishment of slavery in every Territory of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThis was a new doctrine in 1847, and it could not immediately prevail,\r\nbut its appearance is a mark of the progress which the political\r\nsystem of the United States was making toward confederatism and\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of the bill in the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the House on January 16th, 1847, by a vote of nearly\r\nfour to one, and was immediately sent to the Senate. The Senate\r\nreferred it to its Judiciary committee. The committee reported on it,\r\nand the bill was laid on the table, the last day of the session.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The third Oregon bill.]\r\n\r\nDuring the next session, bills were introduced into both Houses for\r\norganizing Oregon as a Territory. On January 10th, 1848, Mr. Douglas,\r\nwho had been transferred from the House to the Senate, presented in\r\nthe Senate a bill for the organization of a Territorial government for\r\nOregon, which provided, among other things, that the laws which the\r\nOregon settlers had constructed for themselves should, in so far as\r\nthey were compatible with the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, remain in force until the Territorial legislature should\r\nchange them. These laws excluded slavery. Here was the germ of\r\n\"squatter-sovereignty,\" afterward developed by Mr. Douglas in his\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill.\r\n\r\nThe House bill, containing substantially the same provision as the\r\nbill of the preceding session, was introduced on February 9th, 1848,\r\nbut this time it met with much more opposition, and the discussion on\r\nit revealed the fact that Mr. Rhett's doctrine had, within the year,\r\nmade many converts.\r\n\r\n{344} [Sidenote: The President urging action on the bill.]\r\n\r\nThe bills were dragging along slowly in both Houses, when, on May\r\n29th, the President sent a special message to Congress urging\r\nimmediate action on the subject. This gave some impetus to the\r\nproceedings in both Houses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hale's amendment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Davis' amendment.]\r\n\r\nOn May 21st, Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, moved to amend the Senate\r\nbill by a provision excluding slavery, and insisted upon the power and\r\nthe duty of Congress to settle the question of slavery in the\r\nTerritories, and to settle it in the interest of freedom. The debate\r\nin the Senate upon Mr. Hale's motion was long and acrimonious, during\r\nwhich the Southerners advanced to more and more radical ground, until\r\nMr. Calhoun and his disciple, Mr. Jefferson Davis, expressed the same\r\nconstitutional doctrine upon the subject of the extension of slavery\r\nto the Territories as Mr. Rhett had done, which was, in brief, that\r\nneither Congress nor the inhabitants of a Territory had any\r\nconstitutional power to abolish slavery in, or exclude it from, a\r\nTerritory. On June 23rd, Mr. Davis moved to amend the Oregon bill by\r\nthe provision that nothing in the bill should be so construed as to\r\nauthorize the prohibition of domestic slavery in said Territory while\r\nit remained in the condition of a Territory. The direct contradiction\r\nbetween the two amendments expressed, at last, the difference of\r\nattitude now assumed between the North and the South upon the question\r\nof the extension of slavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The party platforms of 1848.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said, however, that it represented the difference of\r\nattitude of the two great parties upon the subject. The National\r\nconventions of these parties for the nominations of candidates for the\r\npresidency had just been held. The convention of the Democratic party\r\nhad refused to insert the declaration in its platform that Congress\r\nhad no {345} power to interfere with slavery in the Territories, in\r\nspite of the fact that the candidate nominated by it, General Cass,\r\nhad acknowledged a leaning to something akin to that view, some five\r\nmonths previous, in a letter to Mr. Nicholson, of Tennessee, which was\r\nprobably intended for circulation in the South. The exact wording of\r\nMr. Cass' letter does not warrant us in representing him as holding to\r\nanything more, at that time, than that it was sound policy for\r\nCongress to leave the matter of the admission of slavery to, or its\r\nexclusion from, the Territories to the people of the Territories\r\nthemselves. It was hardly time for Northern men to take the view of\r\nCongressional impotence in the matter held by Messrs. Rhett, Calhoun,\r\nand Davis.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the convention of the Whig party had refused to\r\nmake the principle of the Wilmot proviso a plank in its platform, in\r\nfact had dodged the whole question of principles by adopting no\r\nplatform at all, and by nominating a military man, with no political\r\nrecord at all, for its candidate, the old hero of Buena Vista, General\r\nTaylor.\r\n\r\nThe contradiction of view upon the question of the extension of\r\nslavery to the Territories was, thus, not one between the parties, but\r\none between the sections. The parties were yet to be transformed by\r\nthe differences between the sections. That this was to be the outcome\r\nno far-seeing eye ought then to have failed to perceive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President urges the organization of California and New\r\nMexico.]\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight more the confusion produced by the contradictory\r\npropositions of Mr. Hale and Mr. Davis paralyzed the efforts of the\r\nSenate to pass the Oregon bill, when, on July 6th, 1848, the President\r\nsent a special message to Congress urging the immediate organization\r\nof Territorial governments for California and New Mexico, {346} which\r\nwere still under the military regime established at the time of their\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Clayton's attempt at compromise.]\r\n\r\nIt appeared to some of the Senators that here was now offered the\r\nopportunity for settling the whole question of the extension of\r\nslavery to the Territories, by compromise; and, on July 12th, Mr.\r\nBright, of Indiana, moved to refer the whole matter of the\r\norganization of Territorial governments in Oregon, California, and New\r\nMexico, to a select committee, composed of four Whigs and four\r\nDemocrats, two of each party from the North and the South,\r\nrespectively. Mr. Bright's motion was in the form of an amendment or\r\nsuggestion to a motion made by Mr. Clayton, that the Oregon bill be\r\nreferred to such a committee. Mr. Clayton accepted Mr. Bright's\r\nmodification of his motion, and the Senate immediately voted the\r\nresolution, and appointed the committee, with Mr. Clayton as chairman.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, Mr. Clayton reported the bill from his committee, which\r\nprovided for the organization of Oregon, with its existing\r\nanti-slavery laws, and with the recognition of the power to the\r\nTerritorial legislature to change them; and for the organization of\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico, referring the question of the legality of\r\nslavery in them to the Territorial courts, with appeal to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, as a constitutional question. That is, the\r\nproposition with reference to slavery in California and New Mexico\r\nwas, that slaveholders might take their slaves into these Territories\r\nupon their own responsibility, and that if any slaveholder should be\r\ndisturbed in the possession of his slave, he might bring an action in\r\nthe Territorial courts against the party disturbing him, with the\r\nright of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which final\r\ntribunal should determine the question as a matter {347} of\r\nconstitutional law, and, therefore, upon its own independent\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of Mr. Clayton's bill in the Senate, and rejection\r\nof it in the House.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate debated this bill for a week, during which time the flimsy\r\ncharacter of the makeshifts became painfully apparent. The Senate\r\npassed the bill, however, on the 26th, and sent it to the House.\r\n\r\nThe House rejected it, and proceeded with its own bill, and, on August\r\n2nd, passed the latter by a strict sectional vote, and sent it to the\r\nSenate for concurrence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House bill in the Senate, and Mr. Douglas' amendment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the Oregon bill by Congress.]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, the Senate passed this bill, with an amendment, proposed\r\nby Mr. Douglas, extending the Missouri Compromise line of thirty-six\r\ndegrees and thirty minutes to the Pacific. The House immediately\r\nrejected the amendment, and the Senate was compelled to recede, or let\r\nOregon go without Territorial government. It wisely voted, on the\r\n12th, to recede from its amendment, and passed the bill, with the\r\nCongressional prohibition of slavery, and without compromise as to the\r\nsettlement of the slavery question in California and New Mexico. Among\r\nthe Senators who changed their votes upon the amendment were Douglas\r\nfrom the North, and Benton and Houston from the South.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Free-soil party in 1848.]\r\n\r\nThe feeling aroused outside of Congress by the contest within the body\r\nwas most intense, and had, for its permanent result the organization\r\nof the Anti-slavery-extension party. It called itself then the\r\n\"Free-soil\" party. It held a National convention at Buffalo, New York,\r\non August 9th, and nominated Mr. Van Buren for the presidency, on a\r\nplatform which distinctly affirmed the power of Congress to exclude\r\nslavery from the Territories, and its duty to exercise the power. Here\r\nwas, at last, the {348} principle and the party of the future. Those\r\nwho composed it held to the Union and the Government, vindicated the\r\nnational character of both, and while they denied none of the\r\nconstitutional rights of the Southern Commonwealths, and none of the\r\ncompromises of the Constitution with the slaveholders, yet they\r\nrefused to allow the great evil under which the country suffered to\r\nspread into regions uncontaminated by it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's approval of the Oregon bill.]\r\n\r\nThe President signed the Oregon bill, on August 14th, for the reason,\r\nhe said, among other reasons, that it preserved the principle of the\r\nMissouri Compromise, making the territory north of thirty-six degrees\r\nand thirty minutes free soil. And in his message of December 5th,\r\nfollowing, he urged the speedy organization of California and New\r\nMexico, either upon that principle, or upon the principle of\r\nnon-interference by Congress with the question of slaveholding in\r\nthem, or upon the basis of an appeal of the question to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, which body should interpret the\r\nConstitution upon the subject. He said he believed the first way\r\ncontained the true principle, and was the fair thing, but that he was\r\nwilling to proceed in either of the other two ways.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gold and silver in California.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the President gave official verification to the\r\nrumors of the discovery of great quantities of gold and silver in\r\nCalifornia, which quickened the emigration of the bold and adventurous\r\nspirits from all parts of the country to the new El Dorado.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The election of Taylor, and the disaffection of the\r\nNorthern Democrats.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plans for the organization of California and New Mexico.]\r\n\r\nThe temper of Congress against slavery extension was even stronger in\r\nthe session of 1848-49, than in the preceding session. The Whig\r\nmajority in the House of Representatives remained, and now came a\r\nsupport to the anti-slavery-extension principle of the Northern {349}\r\nWhigs from Northern Democrats, which had not been before accorded. The\r\nelections of 1848 had greatly surprised the Northern Democrats. The\r\nWhig candidate, General Taylor, carried a majority of the Southern\r\nCommonwealths, and was chosen President. The Democrats of the North\r\nconsidered that they had been left in the lurch by the Democrats of\r\nthe South, and came to the session of 1848-49 with revenge in their\r\nhearts. They were disposed to join hands with the Northern Whigs\r\nagainst the extension of slavery into any more of the Territories of\r\nthe Union. This spirit was, however, far more manifest in the House of\r\nRepresentatives than in the Senate. On December 11th, 1848, Mr.\r\nDouglas brought into the Senate a plan for avoiding the question in\r\nrespect to slavery in California and New Mexico, by immediately\r\nerecting the whole of the territory acquired from Mexico into a single\r\nCommonwealth, and reserving the right to Congress to create new\r\nCommonwealths in that part of this territory lying east of the Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains. This proposition was referred to the Judiciary\r\ncommittee for report; but before the report was presented Mr. Smith,\r\nof Indiana, chairman of the committee on Territories, brought in bills\r\nfor the organization of Upper California and New Mexico, with the\r\nslavery restriction of the Ordinance of 1787 in them. On January 9th,\r\n1849, Mr. Berrien, chairman of the Judiciary committee, reported\r\nadversely upon Mr. Douglas' proposition, on the grounds, alleged by\r\nhim, that Congress could not create a Commonwealth, but could only\r\nadmit a Commonwealth into the Union after it had been created by the\r\nsovereign act of the people residing in it, for the performance of\r\nwhich act the status of Territorial organization was necessary, and\r\nthat Congress could never {350} constitutionally disconnect from any\r\nCommonwealth any portion of its territory for the purpose of forming\r\nit into another Commonwealth, without the consent of the Commonwealth\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Douglas' plan.]\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas immediately modified his bill so as to meet the latter\r\nobjection; and on January 24th, offered a substitute for his former\r\nproposition, which provided for a Commonwealth of California that\r\nwould not quite cover the territory which the Mexicans included under\r\nthe title of the Province of Upper California. On Mr. Douglas' own\r\nmotion, this proposition was referred to a select committee, of which\r\nhe was appointed chairman; and, on the 29th, he reported a bill from\r\nthe committee for forming the territory acquired from Mexico into two\r\nCommonwealths, to be called California and New Mexico; but the Senate\r\nshowed so much opposition to the project that it was dropped. More\r\nthan half the session had now passed, and the Senate appeared to be\r\nfarther than ever from any consensus in regard to what should be done\r\nfor California and New Mexico. It was a serious condition of things.\r\nThe inhabitants of these Territories were importunately demanding the\r\nestablishment of civil government over them for the protection of\r\nlife, liberty, and property, and Congress was apparently to do nothing\r\nfor them during the current session.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Walker's expedient.]\r\n\r\nOn February 19th, Mr. Walker, of Wisconsin, came forward in the Senate\r\nwith an expedient. He moved to attach to the Civil and Diplomatic\r\nAppropriation Bill a provision for extending the Constitution, and the\r\nlaws of the United States naturally applicable, over all the territory\r\nacquired from Mexico, and for authorizing the President to make all\r\nneedful rules and regulations, and to appoint civil officials, for\r\ntheir execution. The Senate passed this amendment, {351} and sent the\r\nAppropriation Bill thus modified back to the House for concurrence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House bill for the Territorial organization of Upper\r\nCalifornia.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the bill in the House for the Territorial organization of\r\nUpper California, with the slavery prohibition clause in it, was\r\nproceeding through a most exciting debate, but with increasing\r\nprospect of final passage. On February 27th, it was passed, by an\r\nalmost sectional vote, and sent to the Senate. The Senate referred it\r\nto its committee on Territories, and there it slept as in \"the tomb of\r\nall the Capulets.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Walker's scheme in the House.]\r\n\r\nOn March 1st, the House took up the Senate's amendment to the Civil\r\nand Diplomatic Appropriation Bill, and referred it to the committee on\r\nWays and Means. This committee reported, on March 2nd, an amendment to\r\nthe Senate's amendment, which provided for the continuance of the\r\nstatus of military possession and of the Mexican laws in all the\r\nterritory acquired from Mexico, until six months after the close of\r\nthe next session of Congress. The purpose of this amendment was the\r\ncontinuance of the Mexican law excluding slavery. The House did not,\r\nhowever, adopt this proposition, but sent the Appropriation Bill back\r\nto the Senate stripped of the Senate's amendment. The Senate asked a\r\nconference upon the subject, which was granted by the House, but the\r\nConference committee could come to no agreement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Webster and Mr. Berrien on the status of slavery in the\r\nterritory acquired from Mexico.]\r\n\r\nThe House now passed the proposition of the Ways and Means committee,\r\nslightly modified in form, and sent it to the Senate. Mr. Webster\r\nmoved concurrence with the House in this proposition, and said that it\r\nmeant no more than the existing status, which would continue if\r\nnothing were done. Mr. Berrien contended, on the contrary, that only\r\nthe private law of the ceding country, {352} the law regulating the\r\nrelations between individuals, remains in force in the territory\r\nceded, until changed by the positive acts of the country receiving the\r\ncession; that the public law of the receiving country is extended at\r\nonce, by virtue of the occupation, over the cession; and that slavery\r\nwas a part of the public law of the United States, since both the\r\nsystem of taxation and that of representation rested in part upon it.\r\nMr. Berrien concluded from these postulates of international and\r\nconstitutional law that, if Congress did nothing in the premises, the\r\nPresident would continue to administer, by means of his military\r\nofficials, the private law of Mexico, and the public law of the United\r\nStates, in the territory acquired from Mexico, and that this would\r\nallow slaveholders to take their slaves into this territory, and hold\r\nthem in slavery; but that if Congress, by a positive enactment, should\r\nadopt the Mexican laws, _en bloc_, for this territory, slavery would\r\nbe thereby excluded from it. In a word, he demonstrated, or thought he\r\ndid, that the proposition of the House of Representatives contained\r\nthe principle of the Wilmot proviso. The Senate was so deeply\r\nimpressed by Mr. Berrien's argument, and so much opposition to the\r\nproposition of the House was manifested, that Mr. Webster offered to\r\nwithdraw his motion, if the Southerners would agree to recede from the\r\nSenate's amendment. The bargain was struck, and the Thirtieth Congress\r\nexpired without having done anything for the governmental organization\r\nof California and New Mexico, and without having advanced, in the\r\nslightest measure, toward the solution of the fateful question of\r\nslavery extension in the vast empire conquered from Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emigration to California.]\r\n\r\nThe official announcement made by President Polk of the mineral wealth\r\nof California had increased the excitement for emigration thither to a\r\nfever, and by the {353} close of the spring of 1849, California had a\r\npopulation within her provincial limits numerous enough, according to\r\nprevailing conceptions, to make a Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Taylor's scheme.]\r\n\r\nThe new President, Taylor, thought that all further controversy about\r\nthe Territorial organization of California might now be avoided, by\r\nskipping the Territorial period and status altogether, and organizing\r\nCalifornia immediately as a Commonwealth. He sent a commissioner to\r\nexamine the situation on the ground and make report. Whether the\r\ncommissioner imparted the President's scheme to General Riley, the\r\nmilitary Governor, or not, we are not informed. We have good reason,\r\nhowever, to suspect it, since Riley immediately issued a call for a\r\nconvention of the people of California to frame a Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The convention at Monterey.]\r\n\r\nThe people quickly responded by choosing delegates, and the delegates\r\nmet at Monterey on September 1st, 1849. By October 13th, their work\r\nwas completed, and the organic law which they drafted was ratified by\r\nthe people, on November 13th. One of its provisions was the\r\nprohibition of slavery. The filling up of California by immigration\r\nhad been too sudden for the holders of slaves to take part in the\r\nmovement. It was accomplished, it could be accomplished, only by bold,\r\nalert, shrewd adventurers, untrammelled by families or stupid African\r\nretainers. It was reported that every delegate in the convention voted\r\nfor the prohibition of slavery, and the people ratified the instrument\r\ncontaining it by a vote of fifteen to one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The policy of the Administration.]\r\n\r\nThe President informed Congress, in his message of December 4th, 1849,\r\nof the proceedings in California, and manifested his desire to admit\r\nCalifornia into the Union at once. He also predicted that the people\r\nof {354} New Mexico would soon follow the example of the Californians.\r\nThe policy of the Administration in reference to this question was\r\nthus clearly defined, and was, whether intentional or not, a policy\r\nfavorable to the prohibition of slavery in both California and New\r\nMexico. The slaveholders, or rather the slavery extensionists,\r\nregarded the President's position as treachery to his section.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The policy of the slavery extensionists.]\r\n\r\nThe policy of the slavery extensionists was to organize California and\r\nNew Mexico as Territories, without the prohibition of slavery in them,\r\ngiving thus time and opportunity for slaveholders to settle in them,\r\nwith their slaves, and, when the time should come for the formation of\r\nCommonwealth governments in them, to vote an organic law perpetuating\r\nslavery. This policy was manifested anew in the bill introduced into\r\nthe Senate, on the last day of December, 1849, by Mr. Foote, of\r\nMississippi, for the organization of the entire Mexican cession into\r\nthree Territories--California, Deseret or Utah, and New Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The elements of the slavery question in Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe slavery question in Congress had now come, however, to include\r\nmore than the matter of the governmental organization of the territory\r\nacquired from Mexico. There was, in the first place, the question of\r\nthe Texas boundary, in that, by the Joint Resolution annexing Texas,\r\nthe adjustment of that boundary, as regarded foreign states, at least,\r\nwas reserved to Congress. Texas, as we know, claimed the Rio Grande\r\nfrom mouth to source, and thence the longitude to the forty-second\r\nparallel of latitude as her southwestern and western boundary. She\r\ncame into the Union with a law on her statute book asserting this\r\nboundary. The Treaty with Mexico, recognizing the line of the Rio\r\nGrande to the {355} limits of New Mexico, and ceding New Mexico, made\r\nthe question of the Texan boundary a purely internal question for the\r\nUnited States, if it was any longer a question. The Abolitionists and\r\nanti-slavery-extensionists wanted to reduce Texas in area, since\r\nslavery was established by the law of the Commonwealth throughout its\r\nentire extent. They therefore interpreted the Resolution of annexation\r\nas reserving that power to Congress, even after the question had\r\nbecome purely internal. The slavery extensionists, on the contrary,\r\ncontended that the power reserved to Congress in reference to the\r\nTexan boundary was now obsolete, since it expressly related only to\r\nthe adjustment of the same with Mexico, and that had been accomplished\r\nby the Treaty. Then, there was the war debt of Texas, which was justly\r\na charge upon the United States--although the Resolution of annexation\r\nrepudiated it--since it was hypothecated upon revenue, the proceeds\r\nfrom which were being covered into the United States Treasury, the\r\ncustoms collected in the Texan ports. And, then, there was the\r\nquestion of the rendition of fugitive slaves, since the execution of\r\nthe existing law, that of 1793, in regard to this matter, had been\r\nrendered so difficult by the movements of the Abolitionists, after\r\n1835, as to make a more strenuous measure necessary, unless the\r\nslaveholders would abandon their constitutional rights to the\r\nrendition of their escaped slaves. And, lastly, there was the\r\never-recurring question of slavery and the slave-trade in the District\r\nof Columbia, which was still clamoring for a hearing.\r\n\r\nAlready, before the closing week of January, 1850, had bills been\r\nbrought forward, both in the Senate and in the House, touching all of\r\nthese subjects, except, perhaps, the last, when, on the 29th, Mr. Clay\r\ncame forward with his famous proposition for the adjustment of them\r\nall in one grand scheme.\r\n\r\n{356} [Sidenote: Mr. Clay's plan of compromise.]\r\n\r\nThis proposition provided, in the first place, for the immediate\r\nadmission of California as a Commonwealth, with suitable boundaries,\r\nand without any restrictions as to slavery; in the second place, for\r\nthe establishment of Territorial governments in all of the remainder\r\nof the Mexican cession, without any restrictions as to slavery; in the\r\nthird place, for fixing the western boundary of Texas, so as to\r\nexclude any portion of New Mexico; in the fourth place, for the\r\nassumption of the Texan debt contracted before annexation and\r\nhypothecated upon the Texan customs, on condition of the\r\nrelinquishment by Texas of all claims on New Mexico; in the fifth\r\nplace, for the abolition of the slave-trade in the District of\r\nColumbia, in slaves brought into the District from the outside for the\r\npurpose of sale; and in the sixth place, for a more effective law for\r\nthe rendition of fugitive slaves. The resolutions also contained\r\ndeclarations that slavery did not then exist in any of the territory\r\nacquired from Mexico, and that Congress had no power to prohibit or\r\nobstruct trade in slaves between the slaveholding Commonwealths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slaveholders' objections to Mr. Clay's plan.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Mr. Clay asked the Senators to consider his\r\npropositions carefully before committing themselves, and suggested\r\nthat they should lay over for a week, the Southern Senators\r\nimmediately proceeded to attack the plan at several points. They\r\nobjected to California being allowed to jump the Territorial period of\r\nprobation and preparation for Commonwealth government. They declared\r\nMr. Clay's dictum about the existing illegality of slavery in the\r\nterritory acquired from Mexico to be an assumption, and asserted that\r\nslavery was legal everywhere in the United States, unless a positive\r\nlaw forbade it. They vindicated the claims of Texas to the boundaries\r\ndesignated by the Act of the Texan {357} Congress in 1836. And while\r\nsome of them were not decidedly opposed to the abolition of the\r\nslave-trade in the District of Columbia, most of them deprecated\r\nmeddling with the subject at all, and wanted to substitute for Mr.\r\nClay's proposition on the subject a declaration of the lack of any\r\npower in Congress to deal with slavery in the District. The\r\nimprovement of the fugitive slave-law was about the only thing in the\r\nentire plan which met with their approval. Mr. Jefferson Davis said\r\noutright that he wanted a positive recognition from Congress of the\r\nlegality of slavery in the new territory south of the parallel of\r\nthirty-six degrees and thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-slavery objections to Mr. Clay's plan.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Abolitionists and the\r\nanti-slavery-extensionists insisted upon the immediate admission of\r\nCalifornia, with its anti-slavery constitution; upon the insertion of\r\nthe principle of the Wilmot proviso in the Territorial organization of\r\nthe remainder of the acquisition from Mexico; upon the contraction of\r\nthe Texan limits, without any compensation to Texas; upon the\r\nabolition of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia, and a\r\ndeclaration of the power of Congress to deal with slavery in the\r\nDistrict; and upon a jury trial, at the place of apprehension, for\r\nevery claimed fugitive from labor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: California's application for admission.]\r\n\r\nThe contradiction between these views appeared irreconcilable. We may\r\nsay, however, that a start toward an approach was caused by the\r\ntransmission of California's application to Congress for admission, as\r\na Commonwealth, into the Union.\r\n\r\nThis happened on February 13th. On the following day, Mr. Douglas\r\nmoved to take up the President's message accompanying the application,\r\nand thus to consider the California question separately from the\r\nothers. Mr. Clay agreed to this. Mr. Foote, of Mississippi, scolded\r\nMr. Clay for thus betraying the South, but the {358} Southerners were\r\nmade to feel that they must modify their opposition to Mr. Clay's\r\nplan, if they desired to avoid something like this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Calhoun's last speech.]\r\n\r\nOn March 4th, Mr. Calhoun made his last great speech upon the whole\r\npolitical situation, its threatening character, and its possible\r\nrectification. He was too feeble to pronounce it himself, and it was\r\nread for him by Senator Mason. Mr. Calhoun's propositions were, that\r\nthe Union was endangered; that the immediate cause of the danger was\r\nthe universal discontent prevailing in the South from the feeling that\r\nthe South could no longer remain with safety and honor in the Union;\r\nand that the cause of this feeling was the fact that the balance of\r\npower between the two sections of the country in the Government was\r\ngone, and the stronger section was endeavoring to make the Government\r\nan unlimited centralized democracy, and use it for interfering in the\r\ninternal affairs of the weaker, and for absorbing the substance, as\r\nwell as destroying the rights, of the weaker.\r\n\r\nHe suggested as remedies for the evils, which he thought existed and\r\nimpended, an equal division of the territory to the Pacific between\r\nthe North and the South, an amendment to the Constitution restoring\r\nthe balance of power between the two sections, proper laws for the\r\nrendition of fugitives from labor, and cessation of the agitation of\r\nthe slavery question.\r\n\r\nWhat should be the provisions of the amendment, restoring the balance\r\nof power in the Government, and how the cessation of the agitation\r\ncould be compelled, were not explained. It was not easy to see how\r\nthese points could be advanced beyond the position of general\r\npropositions. It was, however, a great and solemn presentation of the\r\nwhole question, and it made a great impression.\r\n\r\n{359} [Sidenote: Mr. Webster's March 7th speech.]\r\n\r\nOn March 7th, Mr. Webster made his famous speech, giving his great\r\ninfluence to pacification and compromise, and to the preservation of\r\nthe Constitution. He told the Northerners that they were bound by the\r\nagreement with Texas to admit four new Commonwealths from Texan\r\nterritory, under the usual conditions; that they were bound by the\r\nConstitution to deliver up fugitive slaves; and that since nature had\r\nmade slavery impossible in California and New Mexico, they ought not\r\nto irritate the Southerners by demanding a Congressional prohibition\r\nof slavery therein. He told the Southerners, on the other hand, that\r\nthey should desist from denying to citizens from Northern\r\nCommonwealths, temporarily within the jurisdiction of Southern\r\nCommonwealths, the rights of citizens. And he told the Abolitionists\r\nthat they should measure their ideas of right, in some degree at\r\nleast, by the standard of the common consciousness of the country, and\r\nmodify them, in some degree, thereby. His words were received with\r\ngreat satisfaction by all moderate and prudent men. Of course, they\r\ndid not satisfy the extremists, either in the North or the South, but\r\nthey settled the minds of many who were wavering, and moved the work\r\nof temporary pacification, at least, several stages onward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Bell's proposition.]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the debate upon Mr. Clay's resolutions, and\r\nbefore the great efforts either of Mr. Calhoun or Mr. Webster, Mr.\r\nBell, of Tennessee, had offered some propositions, looking to the\r\nadmission of California as a Commonwealth, and to the formation of\r\nTerritorial government for New Mexico. On the day after Mr. Webster's\r\ngreat speech, Mr. Foote moved the reference of Mr. Bell's resolutions\r\nto a select committee of thirteen members. No vote, however, was\r\nimmediately taken, but the debate upon {360} both sets of resolutions\r\ndragged on from day to day, and was made more complicated by the\r\nintroduction of a bill from the committee on Territories, providing\r\nfor the immediate admission of California, and the formation of\r\nTerritorial governments for New Mexico and Utah.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The death of Mr. Calhoun.]\r\n\r\nOn March 31st, Mr. Calhoun passed away. The announcement of his death,\r\nthe eulogies pronounced upon his memory, and the funeral rites, were\r\nmost solemn and impressive occasions. The influence of the sad event\r\nseemed, for the moment, to soften the hearts of those who had\r\nassociated with him toward one another. It seemed as if political foes\r\nwould be willing to join hands across his bier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Foote's motion and the Committee of Thirteen.]\r\n\r\nOn April 11th, Mr. Mangum, of North Carolina, moved to refer the\r\nresolutions of Mr. Clay, along with those of Mr. Bell, to the\r\ncommittee suggested by Mr. Foote. Mr. Foote accepted Mr. Mangum's\r\nmotion as an amendment to his own. After a most determined opposition\r\nby Senator Benton to Mr. Foote's motion, during which temper rose so\r\nhigh that Mr. Benton threatened to cudgel Mr. Foote, and Mr. Foote\r\nactually drew a pistol upon Mr. Benton, both in the course of the\r\ndebate in the Senate chamber, Mr. Foote's motion was passed. On the\r\nnext day, April 19th, the members of the committee were chosen by\r\nballot. They were Mr. Clay, Mr. Bell, Mr. Berrien, Mr. Bright, Mr.\r\nCass, Mr. Cooper, Mr. Dickinson, Mr. Downs, Mr. King, Mr. Mason, Mr.\r\nMangum, Mr. Phelps, and Mr. Webster. Seven members, including the\r\nchairman, Mr. Clay, were from the South and six from the North.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The report and recommendations of the committee.]\r\n\r\nOn May 8th, Mr. Clay made the report, and offered the bills, from the\r\ngrand committee, covering all the {361} subjects referred. The first\r\nbill provided for the admission of California, with the Commonwealth\r\norganization formed by her people the preceding autumn; for the\r\nTerritorial organization of Utah and New Mexico, without any slavery\r\nrestriction, and with restrictions upon the Territorial legislatures\r\nagainst passing any acts in regard to slavery; for fixing the northern\r\nboundary of Texas upon a line drawn from a point on the Rio Grande\r\ntwenty miles above El Paso to the point on the Red River where the\r\nline of the one hundredth degree of longitude intersects this river;\r\nfor quit-claiming, so to speak, to Texas the claims of the United\r\nStates to the country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande; and for\r\npaying Texas a sum of money, in consideration of the discharge of the\r\nUnited States from all obligations to pay the Texan debt, and of the\r\nsurrender of all claims by Texas to country north of the northern\r\nboundary as fixed in the bill.\r\n\r\nThe second bill provided that a fugitive from labor must be delivered\r\nup on the order of any judge or commissioner of the United States\r\nauthorized by the laws of the United States so to act, and that such\r\njudge or commissioner was authorized to issue such order on\r\npresentation to him, by the claimant of the fugitive, of a copy of the\r\nrecord of a competent court in the Commonwealth, Territory, or\r\nDistrict from which the fugitive was said to have escaped, before\r\nwhich the facts of ownership, identity, and escape had been\r\nsatisfactorily proven. The judge or commissioner issuing such order\r\nwas required, in case the fugitive declared himself to be a free man,\r\nto demand of the claimant of the fugitive a bond, with surety, for\r\n$1,000, pledging the claimant to accord the fugitive a trial by jury\r\nof the question of his freedom, in a competent court of the\r\nCommonwealth, {362} Territory, or District from which he was said to\r\nhave escaped.\r\n\r\nThe third bill provided for the abolition of the slave-trade in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and for the liberation of any slave brought into\r\nthe District for the purposes of sale or depot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The debate upon the bills proposed by the committee, and\r\nthe failure to pass them.]\r\n\r\nThe debate began immediately upon the first bill, and the opposition\r\nto it from both sections advanced about the same arguments as were\r\nemployed against these same subjects when presented in the form of Mr.\r\nClay's resolutions. The discussion continued through May, June, and\r\nJuly, until, at the end of July, nothing remained of the bill but that\r\npart of it which provided for the Territorial organization of Utah.\r\nThe general plan of the compromise was lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The temper of the country.]\r\n\r\nThe whole country was amazed, disappointed, and angry. The Senators\r\nwere quickly and decidedly made to feel that they dare not separate\r\nwithout doing something to heal the distractions of the land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The succession of Fillmore and his message of August 6th.]\r\n\r\nThe death of President Taylor, on July 9th, and the accession of Mr.\r\nFillmore, made the Administration more favorable to the measures\r\nincluded in the compromise plan. On August 6th, he communicated to\r\nCongress the fact that the Governor of Texas, P. H. Bell, in execution\r\nof an act of the Texas legislature, was extending the jurisdiction of\r\nTexas over the disputed territory on the eastern border of New Mexico,\r\nand that the President, as military Governor, in highest instance, of\r\nNew Mexico, felt obliged to resist the movement, and that he had\r\ninformed the Governor of Texas of his purpose. He besought Congress to\r\navert the calamity which now threatened, by attending at once {363} to\r\nthe matter of the boundary between Texas and New Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of bills, separately, covering all the\r\nquestions contained in Mr. Clay's compromise measures.]\r\n\r\nUnder this pressure, the Senate took up the Texan boundary bill,\r\nintroduced by Mr. Pierce, of Maryland, which provided that the\r\nnorthern boundary of Texas should be the parallel of thirty-six\r\ndegrees and thirty minutes from the one hundredth degree of longitude\r\nto the one hundred and third degree; that the western and southwestern\r\nboundary should be the one hundred and third parallel of longitude\r\nfrom the northern line to latitude thirty-two degrees, thence along\r\nthis parallel westward to the Rio Grande, thence the Rio Grande to the\r\nGulf; and that ten millions of dollars should be paid Texas for\r\nagreeing to this boundary, and for relinquishing all claims on the\r\nUnited States in regard to the payment of her public debt. On August\r\n9th, the bill passed the Senate.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, the Senate took up the bill for the immediate admission\r\nof California, reported from the committee on Territories, and passed\r\nit by a large majority.\r\n\r\nOn August 15th, the Senate passed the bill from the committee on\r\nTerritories for the Territorial organization of New Mexico, without\r\nany provision as to slavery. The bill for the organization of Utah had\r\npassed, it will be remembered, on August 1st, as the remnant of the\r\ncompromise plan.\r\n\r\nThe Senate then took up the Fugitive Slave Bill reported in March from\r\nthe Judiciary committee. Inasmuch as the United States Supreme Court\r\nhad given its opinion, in the case of Prigg versus Pennsylvania, that\r\nCommonwealth officers were not required by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States to render any assistance in the rendition of fugitive\r\nslaves, the Judiciary {364} committee had so constructed its bill as\r\nto make use of the machinery of the central Government alone in the\r\nexecution of the proposed law. The bill was a somewhat more stringent\r\nmeasure than that proposed by Mr. Clay's committee. It did away with\r\nthe right of a fugitive claiming to be a freeman to a trial by jury of\r\nthe question of his freedom in a competent court of the Commonwealth,\r\nTerritory, or District from which he was said to have escaped. It made\r\nit the duty of the marshals and deputy marshals of the United States\r\ncourts to obey and execute all of the warrants and precepts issued\r\nunder the provisions of the Act. It imposed a penalty of fine and\r\nimprisonment upon any person knowingly hindering the arrest of a\r\nfugitive, or attempting to rescue one from custody, or harboring one,\r\nor aiding one to escape. And it made the fee of the commissioner $10\r\nin case he should issue the certificate of arrest to the claimant of\r\nthe fugitive, and only $5 in case he should not. Otherwise it was\r\nsubstantially the same as the bill proposed by the Clay committee. The\r\nSenate passed this bill, on August 26th.\r\n\r\nAt last, on September 16th, the Senate passed the bill recommended by\r\nMr. Clay's committee, for the abolition of the slave-trade in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nOne after another, all these bills passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives, against great opposition, but with no material\r\nalteration, except the connection of the bill for the organization of\r\nTerritorial government in New Mexico with that for the adjustment of\r\nthe Texan boundary, in which change the Senate acquiesced, and were\r\nall signed by the President; and before the first session of the\r\nThirty-first Congress expired, on September 30th, 1850, the great work\r\nof pacification, as it was hoped and believed to be, had been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{365}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTION OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW, AND THE ELECTION OF 1852\r\n\r\nChange of Attitude of the Slaveholders by the Fugitive Slave Law of\r\n1850--The First Cases Under the New Law--The Opposition to the\r\nExecution of the Law--Establishment of the \"Underground\"--The Support\r\nof the Law by the Political Leaders--The President's Support of the\r\nLaw--Joshua R.

Before 1787, slavery had been regarded as a\r\ntemporary relation, demanded by the moral and intellectual degradation\r\nof the Africans, and by the necessities of the social structure in\r\nwhich Anglo-Saxon and negro were brought together. It had been\r\nconsidered that the rise of the negro in civilization, by his contact\r\nwith the white race, {366} would gradually change this relation in the\r\ndirection of freedom. In fact it had done so, in a considerable\r\ndegree. But the formation of the Constitution of 1787, the invention\r\nand use of the cotton-gin, the acquisition of Louisiana, and the\r\ngeneral subsidence of the revolutionary spirit of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, were all unfavorable to further progress in this only proper\r\nand correct direction. Between 1830 and 1840, a strong retrogressive\r\nmovement set in, as we have seen, provoked indeed, in a considerable\r\ndegree, by the Abolition propaganda; and in consequence of it, the\r\nslaveholders abandoned the only moral principle upon which slavery\r\ncould be justified, and began to adopt the idea of the permanency of\r\nthe relation, and to undertake the adjustment of the laws, customs,\r\ninstitutions, and policies of the country to this idea. And, at last,\r\nby the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, they committed the whole country to\r\nthis course. In a word, they made slavery by this law a national\r\nmatter, and they did it from the property point of view of slavery,\r\nthe point of view which exhibits it in its most hateful light, and\r\nfrom which no moral justification whatsoever for its existence can be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Constitution commanded the return of fugitive\r\nslaves, and that the Supreme Court of the United States had\r\ninterpreted the provision as vesting the power of executing this\r\ncommand in, and imposing the duty of its execution exclusively upon,\r\nthe general Government, but it was a fatal policy for the slaveholders\r\nto insist upon the realization of this right through the general\r\nGovernment. In fact, it was a fatal policy to insist upon its\r\nrealization at all. There was no way to effect it without requiring\r\nthe aid of the North in the perpetuation of slavery. The attempt to\r\neffect it was, therefore, the assumption of an offensive attitude on\r\nthe part of the slaveholders, an attitude which was bound to {367}\r\nprovoke a general hostility to slavery throughout the North, instead\r\nof the indifference which had prevailed under the idea that slavery\r\nwas an institution of the Southern Commonwealths, with which the North\r\nand the general Government had no concern. Calhoun and Rhett and Davis\r\nhad seen this danger, and they were not supporters of a national\r\nfugitive slave law. They preferred to consider the matter of the\r\nrendition of fugitive slaves as a special compact between the\r\n\"States,\" and treat its non-fulfilment as a rupture of the Union.\r\nPossibly, protected as their \"States\" were by the border slaveholding\r\nCommonwealths, they did not feel the necessity of such a law. At any\r\nrate, it was the border slaveholding Commonwealths which wanted the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first cases under the new law.]\r\n\r\nThe first apprehension of an escaped slave, under the new Act, was\r\nmade in the city of New York. One James Hamlet, who had three years\r\nbefore left his mistress, Mary Brown, of Baltimore, was the victim. He\r\nhad a wife and children in New York. He was surprised at his work,\r\nhastily tried, and delivered to Mrs. Brown's agent, who conducted him\r\nback to Baltimore. When the news of the event spread abroad it created\r\ngreat excitement among the negro population throughout the North, and\r\ngreat indignation on the part of the white citizens in many quarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The opposition to the execution of the law.]\r\n\r\nIt was calculated that there were from fifteen to twenty thousand\r\nescaped slaves living at that time in the non-slaveholding\r\nCommonwealths who were liable to apprehension under the law; and every\r\nperson having any negro blood, whether escaped from slavery or not,\r\nfelt the insecurity created by the law. Meetings of persons belonging\r\nto these classes were immediately held in Boston and New York, and\r\nresolutions were passed at them, praying the white people to move for\r\nthe repeal of the law.\r\n\r\n{368} In answer, so to speak, to these appeals, mass-meetings of white\r\npeople were held in Lowell, Syracuse, and Boston, at which the law was\r\ndenounced, its repeal demanded, and aid pledged to the negroes in the\r\nNorth in resisting the execution of the law. Ministers of the Gospel,\r\nsuch as Beecher, Storrs, Furness, Spear, and Cheever, rained down\r\ndenunciations upon the law from their pulpits, declared it to be in\r\ndirect contravention of the law of God, and counselled resistance to\r\nits execution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Establishment of the \"Underground.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this excitement two Georgia slaves, named William and\r\nEllen Crafts, had succeeded in reaching Boston, and were concealed by\r\nsome of the most high-toned people of that city, the Hillards,\r\nLorings, and Parkers, from their pursuers, and aided in a successful\r\nescape to England. The first branch of the \"Underground,\" established\r\nafter the passage of the law, ran through very respectable quarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The support of the law by the political leaders.]\r\n\r\nThe lawyers, politicians, and statesmen now felt that it was high time\r\nfor them to call the people back to the proper comprehension and\r\nobservance of their constitutional duties. Clay, Webster, Cass,\r\nDouglas, Buchanan, Shields, Curtis, Choate, and many others,\r\ninstructed the people, both in speeches and written articles, in\r\nregard to the constitutionality of the law, and their duty to obey its\r\nrequirements. With this the tide of public opinion began to change,\r\nand the idea that it was the constitutional duty of the North to the\r\nSouth to secure the execution of the law began to prevail. Such was\r\nthe state of feeling when the Congressional session of 1850-51 opened,\r\non December 2nd.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's support of the law.]\r\n\r\nIn his message to Congress President Fillmore proclaimed his adherence\r\nto the Compromise Measures, as a {369} final settlement of the\r\nsubjects to which they related, said that he believed the great mass\r\nof the American people sympathized with him, indicated that he would\r\nveto any measure for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law, and\r\ndeclared that he would execute the laws to the utmost of his ability\r\nand to the extent of the power vested in him.\r\n\r\nThis bold and determined language on the part of the President, who\r\nhad been considered in the North as personally hostile to the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, took the North somewhat by surprise, painfully so in some\r\nquarters, while it was highly approved at the South. It undoubtedly\r\ncontributed, ultimately and in large degree, to the suppression of the\r\nresistance in the North to the execution of the law. At the moment,\r\nhowever, it drew out some of the bitterest denunciations of the law\r\nwhich were ever pronounced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joshua R. Giddings.]\r\n\r\nMr. Joshua R. Giddings, of Ohio, moved the reference of this part of\r\nthe message to the Judiciary committee in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and made a speech in support of his motion, which was\r\nan anti-slavery harangue of the most radical and violent character,\r\nand in the course of which he denounced the President and Mr. Webster\r\nin unmeasured language as apostates from principle and suitors for\r\nSouthern favor. The reckless outburst of radical extravagance,\r\nalthough somewhat balanced by many points of sound sense, disgusted\r\nthe House, and it voted down Mr. Giddings' motion by a large majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petitions for the repeal of the law.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Shadrach case.]\r\n\r\nPetitions began now to flow into Congress for the repeal of the law.\r\nGenerally they were laid upon the table, but more than once a fierce\r\ndebate was opened, which threatened to precipitate another contest\r\nover the right of petition. It was about the time that the Senate was\r\nconsidering what {370} to do with one of these petitions, offered by\r\nMr. Hamlin, of Maine, in February of 1851, that the news of the\r\nfailure of the law in the Shadrach case reached Washington. Shadrach,\r\nclaimed slave of John DeBree, of Norfolk, Va., was rescued by a negro\r\nmob, while held in custody in the court-house in Boston under a\r\nwarrant from the United States Commissioner, Mr. George T. Curtis, and\r\nwas spirited away to Canada. The mob seems to have had no difficulty\r\nin accomplishing its purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The investigation of the case by Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate, on motion of Mr. Clay, passed a resolution, on February\r\n18th, 1851, calling upon the President for information concerning the\r\nfailure of the law in the Shadrach case, and the means he had adopted\r\nto meet the occurrence, and asking the President if, in his opinion,\r\nfurther means should be placed at his disposal by Congress for\r\nenabling him to execute the laws with more success.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, the reply of the President was received. It contained an\r\naccount of the occurrence in Boston; a summary of the laws of the\r\nUnited States and of Massachusetts on the subject of confining United\r\nStates prisoners in the jails of the Commonwealth, which demonstrated\r\nthe fact that Massachusetts had forbidden the use of her jails and the\r\naid of her officials in fugitive slave cases; a declaration of opinion\r\nthat the President was authorized by the Constitution to use the\r\nregular army and navy, when, in his judgment, it was necessary for the\r\nsuppression of violence and the execution of the laws, and without\r\ngiving warning of his intention by any proclamation; and a suggestion\r\nto Congress to confirm this opinion by a positive act, which would\r\ninclude the militia as well as the regular army and navy, and would\r\nauthorize a marshal or commissioner of the {371} United States to\r\nsummon an organized militia force as a part of the posse comitatus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The question of increasing the power of the President to\r\nexecute the law.]\r\n\r\nMr. Clay immediately moved the reference of the communication to the\r\nJudiciary committee. This motion called out a three days debate in the\r\nSenate, during which it became manifest that the extremists, from both\r\nthe North and the South, had little faith in the power of the\r\nGovernment to execute the law, and were unfavorable to the policy of\r\nusing the military power in its execution. Mr. Chase and Mr. Hale, on\r\nthe one side, and Mr. Butler, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Rhett, on the other,\r\ncontended that the provision of the Constitution guaranteeing the\r\nrendition of fugitive slaves did not require a Congressional act, even\r\nif it authorized one. Mr. Davis said that he would see Massachusetts\r\nquit the Union rather than execute the law by military power within\r\nher limits. It was evident that these men were not anxious to have the\r\nlaw executed at all. Their motives for the same must have been very\r\ndifferent, but it would hardly be an unfair speculation if one should\r\nimagine that the slaveholders were not averse to having the failure of\r\nthe law for another count in their indictment against the Union.\r\n\r\nThe moderate men, however, of both the North and the South, claimed\r\nthat the law was constitutional, that it was politic and necessary,\r\nthat it had been successfully executed in a number of cases, that it\r\ncould be executed in practically all cases, that it must be, even\r\nthough it should require the whole military power of the country, and\r\nthat the great mass of the people would sustain it as carrying out the\r\npledges of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay's motion was finally unanimously voted, and, on March 3rd,\r\ntwo reports were presented to the {372} Senate, one signed by all the\r\nmembers of the Judiciary committee except Mr. Butler, of South\r\nCarolina, and the other by Mr. Butler alone. The former expressed the\r\nopinion that the President already possessed full and adequate powers\r\nto execute the laws, and that no further legislation upon the subject\r\nwas necessary. It also held that the organized military could be\r\nsummoned and used by a civil officer as a part of the posse comitatus.\r\nMr. Butler, while agreeing with the other members in recommending no\r\nfurther legislation for the execution of the law, denied that the\r\nPresident had the power from the Constitution to use the regular army\r\nand navy at his own discretion in suppressing insurrections and\r\nexecuting the laws, and held that the President could employ these\r\nforces for such purposes in the same manner only that he could employ\r\nthe militia, that is, under the Congressional Acts of 1795 and 1807,\r\nwhich required, among other things, that a proclamation should precede\r\nthe actual employment of military power in such cases.\r\n\r\nCongress closed its session, on the next day, without having changed\r\nor modified the law, and without having given the President any\r\nadditional means for its execution. The thoughts of men were turned\r\nagain upon the incidents of its execution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sims case.]\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1851, several cases of slave apprehension\r\noccurred, the most exciting of which was that of Thomas Sims, claimed\r\nin Boston by Mr. James Potter, of Georgia. He was arrested by the City\r\nMarshal on the charge of having committed a larceny, and put under\r\nguard in the Court House. Charles G. Loring, Robert Rantoul, Jr., and\r\nSamuel E. Sewall, lawyers of much ability and men of high social\r\nstanding, offered their services in defence of the negro. After\r\napplying to several judges of the {373} supreme court of the\r\nCommonwealth, without success, for a writ of habeas corpus, they\r\nfinally obtained one from Judge Woodbury, and argued the case before\r\nhim. The Judge finally refused to interfere with the possession of the\r\nnegro by the United States Marshal. The United States Commissioner,\r\nMr. George T. Curtis, then heard the case, and issued the certificate\r\nfor the rendition of the fugitive to his master. In the early morning\r\nof the next day, the negro was conducted by three hundred armed\r\npolicemen to the wharf and placed on board a vessel bound for\r\nSavannah. The vessel sailed safely out of port, and the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw was, at last, executed in Boston.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excitement in Boston over the rendition of Sims.]\r\n\r\nDuring the trial, and for a week afterward, the city was in a fever of\r\nexcitement. Meetings of the citizens were held in Tremont Temple and\r\nWashington Hall, and on the Common, at which the eloquence of\r\nPhillips, Channing, Edmund Quincy, and Horace Mann, and the violent\r\nwords of Garrison and Parker, stirred the indignation of their hearers\r\nand lashed it into an almost rebellious fury. A very large part of the\r\ninhabitants felt that a stain had been put upon the city, which must\r\nbe wiped out by any means necessary to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThe summer months of 1851 now passed without any notable instances of\r\nresistance to the law, and conservative men, of both the North and the\r\nSouth, began to hope that the worst was over, and that the North would\r\nacquiesce without further opposition in the execution of the odious\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Jerry rescue.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the early autumn, however, violence again appeared. The minor\r\noutbreaks were soon overshadowed by an event which occurred at\r\nSyracuse, N. Y., in October, 1851. A negro, named Jerry McHenry, who\r\nhad lived for several years in Syracuse, was suddenly {374} seized and\r\ncarried before the United States Commissioner. In the course of the\r\nhearing he eluded the officer having him in charge, and bounded out of\r\nthe court-room. He was, however, overtaken and, after a fierce\r\nstruggle, recaptured and brought back. A little later, a party of\r\nhighly respectable men, led by Gerrit Smith and the Rev. S. J. May,\r\nbroke into the court-room, rescued the negro, and smuggled him safely\r\nacross the Canadian boundary. Eighteen of these gentlemen were\r\nindicted and ordered to appear for trial. But the whole community\r\nmanifested so much active sympathy with them that the matter was\r\nquietly dropped.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's rebuke.]\r\n\r\nIn his message to Congress, of December 2nd, 1851, President Fillmore\r\nreferred to these cases of resistance to the execution of the law;\r\ndeclared the law to be required by the Constitution; denounced the\r\nopposition to its execution as directed against the Constitution and\r\nthe Union itself; repeated his dictum that the Compromise Measures\r\nwere a final settlement of the subjects embraced in them; and\r\ncongratulated the country upon the general acquiescence in these\r\nMeasures manifested throughout the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Foote's finality resolutions.]\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Mr. Foote introduced into the Senate a resolution\r\ndeclaring these Measures to be a definite settlement of the questions\r\nembraced in them, and recommending acquiescence in them by all good\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of the resolutions to pass the Senate, but\r\ntheir success in the House.]\r\n\r\nThe debate upon this proposition, which began December 8th, and\r\nlasted, off and on, until February 28th, was, in the main, a\r\ndiscussion between four Southern members--Mr. Foote, Mr. Butler, Mr.\r\nRhett, and Mr. Clemens--during which the history of the movements of\r\nthe Southern leaders in 1850 and 1851 were brought to light, beginning\r\nwith the Southern Address, issued {375} from Washington before the\r\npassage of the Compromise Measures, for the purpose of producing a\r\nunited action on the part of the South in behalf of Southern rights,\r\nand the call of the Nashville convention by the Mississippi\r\nlegislature, and ending with the demand of the convention for the line\r\nof thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes to the Pacific Ocean, and the\r\ndeclaration by the convention and by conventions in Mississippi,\r\nGeorgia, and South Carolina, of the abstract right of secession as a\r\nprinciple of the political system of the Union. It was evident that\r\nthese movements had approached dangerously near to an attempt at\r\nsomething like practical secession, and that the Southern leaders were\r\nnow anxious to underrate their significance. The Northern Senators\r\nallowed these Southern brethren to proceed with criminations and\r\nrecriminations against each other, until they themselves were\r\nconvinced that they would lose more by the continuance of the debate\r\nthan they could gain by the passage of the resolution. After a fiery\r\nspeech by Mr. Clemens, on February 28th, 1852, the attempt to pass the\r\nresolution was abandoned in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, on the other hand, incited by memorials\r\nsent into it by the legislatures of New Jersey and Iowa, actually\r\npassed resolutions, on April 5th, 1852, by a large majority, declaring\r\nthe finality of the Measures.\r\n\r\nPetitions began again to pour into the Senate for the repeal of the\r\nlaw. Mr. Seward, Mr. Hale, and Mr. Sumner presented such petitions and\r\ntried to get a hearing upon them, but the Senate voted to lay them all\r\non the table.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The National conventions of 1852 and the finality of the\r\ncompromise measures.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when the two great parties assembled in their\r\nNational conventions for the {376} nomination of their respective\r\ncandidates for the presidency and vice-presidency. It was indicated\r\nfrom the first day of the Congressional session of 1851-52, that the\r\nfinality of the Compromise Acts would be a plank in the platforms of\r\nboth parties, although it was soon revealed that the Whig party\r\nleaders were divided upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic convention met June 1st, at Baltimore, and, on account\r\nof the three-cornered fight between Buchanan, Cass, and Douglas, was\r\nobliged to produce a \"dark horse.\" This proved to be General Franklin\r\nPierce, of New Hampshire, a good lawyer, a brave soldier, a fine\r\norator, and a courtly gentleman. He was known to be a true friend to\r\nthe Compromise Acts, and was entirely acceptable to the South. The\r\nplatform contained the finality plank.\r\n\r\nThe Whig convention met fifteen days later, at the same place. The\r\nNorthern Whigs, under the lead of Seward, were determined to defeat\r\nboth Fillmore and Webster, chiefly on account of their fidelity in the\r\nexecution of the Fugitive Slave Law. The Southerners were for Fillmore\r\nfirst, and then Webster, for the same reason. A sufficient number of\r\nthe Northern delegates voted with the Southerners to put the finality\r\nplank into the platform, and then offered the Southerners one of their\r\nown fellow-citizens, General Scott, the military hero of the country.\r\nThe Southerners finally accepted the offer.\r\n\r\nIf Seward desired the defeat and destruction of the Whig party, he\r\ncould not have acted more adroitly. It was to be foreseen that the\r\nNorthern Whigs would not be wholly faithful to their own choice upon\r\nthat platform, and that many of the Southern Whigs would arrive at the\r\nconclusion that the Democratic platform and the Democratic candidate\r\nfurnished stronger guarantees for {377} the finality of the Compromise\r\nMeasures than the Whig platform and candidate did.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The deaths of Clay and of Webster, and the appearance of a\r\nFree-soil candidate.]\r\n\r\nClay died at the beginning of the campaign, and Webster at the end of\r\nit; and, in the midst of it, Sumner succeeded in getting in his\r\nferocious attack on the Fugitive Slave Law, in a four hours speech\r\nbefore the Senate, and the Free-soilers set up a candidate, Mr. Hale,\r\nfor the suffrages of the Abolitionists and the\r\nanti-slavery-extensionists. All of these events were unfavorable to\r\nthe Whigs; still, they did not probably determine the result. The\r\npeople were determined to have peace in regard to the slavery\r\nquestion, and they felt that the Democratic party was more likely to\r\ngive them the peace they desired than the Whig party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The overwhelming Democratic victory of 1852.]\r\n\r\nThe Democratic victory was overwhelming. Twenty-seven Commonwealths\r\ngave their electoral vote for General Pierce, and only four gave\r\ntheirs for General Scott; while the popular vote cast for Mr. Hale was\r\nonly about one-half as large as that cast for Mr. Van Buren in 1848.\r\nThe Democrats themselves were surprised. Since the \"era of good\r\nfeeling,\" no presidential candidate had received such a vote, either\r\npopular or electoral, as that now given to General Pierce. The country\r\naccepted the decision, and settled down into universal acquiescence in\r\nthe Compromise Measures, and in the execution of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, in most sections cheerfully, but in some sullenly and with\r\nbitterness of heart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The true policy of the slaveholders, and their failure to\r\ndiscern it.]\r\n\r\nHad the slaveholders made a wise use of this, to them, most favorable\r\nturn in affairs, there is little question that they might have\r\npreserved indefinitely their peculiar institution where it existed.\r\nBut wisdom in the case meant that the slaveholders should themselves\r\ngive no further {378} occasion for slavery agitation. It meant that\r\nthey should cease to claim the rendition of their fugitive slaves by\r\nthe general Government; that they should turn their attention to\r\nperfecting the police administration in the slaveholding Commonwealths\r\nfor preventing the escape of their slaves, and let the few slaves who\r\nmight have cleverness enough to elude the police of these\r\nCommonwealths go; and that they should, above all things, abstain from\r\nany attempt to extend slavery beyond the limits placed upon it by\r\nexisting law. The status of every inch of the territory of the United\r\nStates, in reference to the legality or illegality of slavery, was now\r\nfixed, and the public opinion of the country, of the world, and of the\r\nage, would never permit that status to be altered to the advantage of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting, though by no means an inexplicable, fact that\r\nthe slaveholders in the Commonwealths south of Virginia, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri, showed more tendency to follow this view of their best\r\npolicy than those within these border Commonwealths. These latter were\r\nan efficient protection to the former in preventing the escape of\r\nslaves, while they were themselves exposed in much higher degree to\r\nloss. Still, it would have been the true policy for the slaveholders\r\nin these also to have looked to their own police administration for\r\nthe recapture of their runaways before the latter had reached free\r\nsoil, and to have considered that a slave having sufficient\r\nintelligence to elude this had already attained the point of mental\r\nactivity and of courage which required in good morals his liberation,\r\nand made his further retention in slavery both a wrong to himself and\r\na danger to the peace of the slaveholding community in which he might\r\nbe held in bondage.\r\n\r\nWe may fairly say that the slaveholders in the more southern\r\nCommonwealths sustained the Fugitive Slave {379} Law more out of\r\nconsideration for their brothers in the border Commonwealths than for\r\nthe sake of their own immediate interests, or from their own\r\nconvictions of its policy, while they would have greatly preferred the\r\nrestriction of slavery to the territory south of the line of\r\nthirty-six degrees and thirty minutes to the Pacific, with some sort\r\nof a guarantee of its existence there during the Territorial period,\r\nto any chance of extending slavery north of that line by the repeal of\r\nthe prohibitions already existing. It is not at all surprising, in\r\nview of this state of feeling in 1852, that, ten years later, the\r\nConfederates considered themselves left in the lurch by the border\r\nCommonwealths, in the support of whose views and interests they had\r\ndone so much to provoke the North to the contest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{380}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE\r\n\r\nThe Connection of California with the Mississippi\r\nValley--Nebraska--Mr. Douglas' Nebraska Bill and Report--The\r\nSurprising Assumptions in the Report--Mr. Douglas' Purpose--The Report\r\nand Bill Together in Conflict with the Act of 1820--The New\r\nSection--Mr. Dixon's Proposed Amendment--Mr. Blair's Letter in\r\nReference to Mr. Seward's Connection with Dixon's Proposition--Douglas\r\nand Dixon--Mr. Douglas' New Bill--The Free-soil Protest Against the\r\nBill--Mr. Douglas' Reply to the Address--Mr. Chase's First Amendment\r\nto the Bill--The Southern Whigs Aroused by Mr. Wade's Accusations--Mr.\r\nChase's Amendment Lost--Mr. Douglas' Last Change in the Wording of the\r\nClause--Mr. Everett's Views--Mr. Houston's Opposition to the Bill--Mr.\r\nBell's Attitude Toward the Bill--Mr. Douglas' Amendment Passed by the\r\nSenate--Mr. Chase's Amendments--Mr. Bell's Argument Against the\r\nBill--Mr. Douglas' Final Argument--The Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nBill by the Senate--Analysis of the Vote Upon the Bill--Development of\r\nPopular Opposition to the Bill--The Kansas-Nebraska Bill in the\r\nHouse--The Relation of the Administration to the Bill--President\r\nPierce and Mr. Davis--The Bill Taken up in the Committee of the Whole\r\nof the House of Representatives--Mr. A.

Evidently the people\r\nbelieved that the Measures of 1850, and their cordial endorsement in\r\nthe elections just passed, had finally solved the great question, in\r\nso far as the Congress could solve it at all. But never was there a\r\nmore deceptive peace. It was merely the dead calm before the dread\r\ncyclone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The connection of California with the Mississippi valley.]\r\n\r\nThis time the storm came from the Northwest. After the acquisitions of\r\nthe territory upon the Pacific coast, it was immediately apparent that\r\nthese new possessions must be connected, so soon as possible, with the\r\nline of Commonwealths on the west bank of the Mississippi by the\r\nTerritorial organization of the country lying between. Mr. Douglas had\r\nconceived this idea as far back as 1847, and had endeavored from that\r\ntime forward to secure the attention of Congress for its realization.\r\nThe seemingly more important questions involved in the Compromise\r\nMeasures gave little room for the consideration of other subjects\r\nbetween 1848 and 1850. Now, however, that these questions had\r\napparently received their final settlement, the moment seemed\r\nopportune for the solution of the problem of binding the Pacific slope\r\nwith the settled country of the west valley of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nebraska.]\r\n\r\nIn the Congressional session of 1852-53, a bill passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives for organizing the region lying between Missouri and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and between the latitudes thirty-six degrees,\r\nthirty minutes, and forty-three degrees, into the Territory of\r\nNebraska. A vote upon the measure was, however, not reached in the\r\nSenate before the close of the session.\r\n\r\nDuring the consideration of the bill in the House, Mr. Howe, of\r\nPennsylvania, asked Mr. Giddings, of Ohio, {382} who was a member of\r\nthe committee on Territories, from which the bill had come, why there\r\nwas no clause in the bill prohibiting slavery. Mr. Giddings replied\r\nthat the Act of 1820 did that for all of this territory. Whereupon Mr.\r\nHowe used these significant words: \"I should like to know of the\r\ngentleman of Ohio, if he has not some recollection of a compromise\r\nmade since that time.\" Mr. Giddings quietly replied: \"That does not\r\naffect this question.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion of the bill in the Senate, Mr. Atchison, of\r\nMissouri, said that one of his objections to the organization of this\r\nTerritory was that Missouri would be surrounded on three sides by free\r\nsoil, into which the slaves of the citizens of Missouri could easily\r\nescape, but that, as he could see no prospect of a repeal of the Act\r\nof 1820 making this region free soil, he would not be willing to delay\r\nthe organization of the Territory on that account.\r\n\r\nThere is no explanation of the language used by these three gentlemen,\r\nexcept that Mr. Howe had conceived that, in some way or other, the\r\nMeasures of 1850 had modified the Act of 1820 prohibiting slavery in\r\nthe Louisiana territory above thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes,\r\nand that Mr. Giddings and Mr. Atchison had never thought of such a\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nOn December 14th, 1853, Mr. Dodge, of Iowa, introduced a bill into the\r\nSenate for the organization of Nebraska Territory. It was referred to\r\nthe committee on Territories, of which Mr. Douglas was chairman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Douglas' Nebraska bill and report.]\r\n\r\nOn January 4th, 1854, Mr. Douglas presented a bill from the committee,\r\nwith a special report, in which latter document the principles of the\r\nlaws of the United States in respect to slavery in the Territories, as\r\nunderstood by the committee, or rather as Mr. Douglas {383} understood\r\nthem, were stated. The report was a more important document than the\r\nbill, since the bill, drawn in vague terms upon this subject, was to\r\nbe interpreted by the principles declared in the report. The first\r\nparagraph of the report read: \"The principal amendments which your\r\ncommittee deem it their duty to commend to the favorable action of the\r\nSenate, in a special report, are those in which the principles\r\nestablished by the Compromise Measures of 1850, so far as they are\r\napplicable to Territorial organization, are proposed to be affirmed\r\nand carried into practical operation within the limits of the new\r\nTerritory.\" The report then declares these principles to be: \"That all\r\nquestions pertaining to slavery in the Territories, and in the new\r\nStates to be formed therefrom, are to be left to the decision of the\r\npeople residing therein, by their appropriate representatives, to be\r\nchosen by them for that purpose: That all cases involving title to\r\nslaves, and questions of personal freedom, are to be referred to the\r\nadjudication of the local tribunals, with the right of appeal to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States: That the provisions of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, in respect to fugitives from\r\nservice, are to be carried into faithful execution in all the\r\norganized Territories the same as in the States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The surprising assumptions in the report.]\r\n\r\nThese were most astonishing and confusing propositions in a variety of\r\nrespects. In the first place, the claim that the Compromise Acts of\r\n1850 contained any general principles of Territorial organization in\r\nrespect to slavery, which were applicable to any other Territories\r\nthan those organized under these Acts, was a surprising assumption. It\r\nwas an induction from one precedent when there were half a dozen\r\nprecedents against it. The fact was that the Acts of 1850 only set up\r\na rule for a single case, a rule patched {384} up by compromise, and\r\nnot derived from any general principle. This claim was also, if\r\nadmitted, highly confusing. Was it a principle of the Constitution,\r\nand therefore supreme over all Congressional policies in the case? Or\r\nwas it simply a principle of Congressional policy? If the former, then\r\nit had already rendered the prohibition upon slavery in the Louisiana\r\nterritory, by the Act of 1820, nugatory. If it was the latter, then it\r\nwould require a new act of Congress to apply it to any other Territory\r\nthan Utah and New Mexico. In the second place, the statement, also\r\ncontained in the report, that there was a pronounced conflict of\r\nopinion in the country upon the question of the constitutional\r\nvalidity of the Act of 1820, prohibiting slavery in the Louisiana\r\nterritory above thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes, was equally\r\nsurprising. Nobody had heard the noise of any such conflict. The fact\r\nis, that conflict was yet to be aroused. And, lastly, it was most\r\nhighly surprising and confusing that the attempt to rouse this\r\nconflict should proceed from the bosom of the party which had won its\r\nsplendid victory under the peace issue upon the subject of slavery,\r\nand should be inaugurated by a member of that party from the North.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Douglas' purpose.]\r\n\r\nWhat was, or what could have been, Mr. Douglas' purpose? It is held by\r\nmost historians that it was simply a reckless and dishonest bid for\r\nSouthern support, in his ambitious plans to gain the presidency. Most\r\nof Mr. Douglas' political opponents at the time believed that he was\r\nanimated solely by that desire. His character was, according to their\r\nview, that of a scheming politician, who would sacrifice anything and\r\nanybody for his own advancement. While we can understand this radical\r\nestimate of him by those with whom he was in daily conflict, it does\r\nseem that the historians, with his subsequent career before them,\r\nmight {385} suspect, at least, that some conviction of the\r\nrightfulness of his views may have aided in moving him to the position\r\nwhich he took. Mr. Douglas was a Western Democrat; that is, he was a\r\nradical Democrat. He had, therefore, an exaggerated notion of the\r\nvirtues of the people, and of the importance of local autonomy. He\r\nresented the idea that the sturdy adventurers who accomplished the\r\nfirst settlement of a Western Territory were not as fully capable of\r\nlocal self-government, from the very outset, as the \"effeminate\"\r\ninhabitants of an Eastern Commonwealth. He repudiated the notion that\r\nthey needed any pupilage from the general Government in the management\r\nof public affairs. He was not alone in such views. It is safe to say\r\nthat the mass of the people in his section held the same views at that\r\ntime. They have not progressed much beyond them now. Is it not, then,\r\nfair to say that Mr. Douglas, in all probability, really believed that\r\nthe reference of the questions in regard to slavery to the residents\r\nof each Territory, as well as to those of each \"State,\" was the true\r\nprinciple of the political science of the Republic, and the true\r\npolicy of its legislation? If his convictions and his ambition went\r\nhand in hand, and if his convictions were not the product of his\r\nambition, should he be so harshly criticised for declaring them? It is\r\ntrue that his announcement of them filled the land with clamor and\r\nangry dispute, and that their adoption by Congress led to violence,\r\nbloodshed, and war; but can we conclude that he had any conception\r\nwhatsoever that this could be the result of them? Is it not far more\r\nprobable that he thought the quiet of the country would be confirmed\r\nand forever established by their general acceptance? There is\r\ncertainly ground for this view of his motives. It is certainly very\r\nimprobable that there was ever any balancing, in his mind, of risks to\r\nhis country's peace {386} and safety against his ambition for the\r\npresidency. It is much more probable that he believed his principles,\r\nwithout his presidency, would contribute, in high degree, to the peace\r\nand welfare of his country, but that, taken together with his\r\npresidency, they would shed untold blessings upon the land. This is no\r\nunusual psychology. It is decidedly common.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The doctrines of the report at first not inserted in the\r\nbill.]\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas did not, however, insert his doctrine of popular\r\nsovereignty in the Territories, and his dictum as to the repeal of the\r\nslavery prohibition in the Act of 1820 by the principles of the Acts\r\nof 1850, in the bill. Possibly he thought it unnecessary. Possibly he\r\ndid not venture to do so. Possibly he did intend to leave things in\r\nsuch an ambiguous shape that one interpretation might be put upon them\r\nin one section, and a somewhat different one in another. He would\r\nhardly have been an American politician if he had not, at some time or\r\nother in his life, practised something of this kind. This is what they\r\ncall feeling the public pulse, which is a main point in the practice\r\nof democratic statesmanship. It is not particularly edifying to the\r\nacademic statesman, but it is business, and Americans are a business\r\npeople. Mr. Douglas simply modelled the bill after the Utah and New\r\nMexico bills, in respect to slavery, that is, he made no mention of\r\nthe subject in that part of the bill which provided for the\r\nTerritorial period, but added a clause which read: \"When admitted as a\r\nState, the said Territory, or any portion of the same, shall be\r\nreceived into the Union, with or without slavery, as its Constitution\r\nmay prescribe at the time of its admission.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The report and bill together in conflict with the Act of\r\n1820.]\r\n\r\nTaken apart from the report, the bill might be interpreted as not in\r\nconflict with the Act of 1820, but taken with the report, it meant the\r\nrepeal of the Act of 1820, and the attribution of all power over the\r\nquestion of {387} slavery in the Territory to those who might squat\r\nupon its soil. Of course it was entirely within the power of Congress\r\nto repeal the Act of 1820. The restraints resting upon Congress in\r\nregard to this matter were moral, not legal. If Congress would,\r\nnevertheless, do it, it must do it in the form of a statute, and not\r\nin that of a report doubting the constitutionality of the Act, or even\r\ndeclaring it unconstitutional. It was entirely natural that the demand\r\nshould be made for clearing the bill of its ambiguities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new section.]\r\n\r\nBefore the demand came, however, the committee itself did something in\r\nthis direction. When the bill was printed, on January 7th, it\r\ncontained twenty sections. On the 10th, a revised edition of it\r\nappeared, which contained twenty-one sections. The last section was\r\nthe dictum of the report in regard to the principles of the Measures\r\nof 1850 upon the subject of slavery in the Territories. The committee\r\nexplained that it had been left out of the first draft by a clerical\r\nerror. This change did not, however, clear the bill of all ambiguity.\r\nThe added provision was declaratory only, and did not expressly repeal\r\nthe Act of 1820.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Dixon's proposed amendment.]\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 16th, Mr. Dixon, of Kentucky, gave notice to the\r\nSenate that he should move, as an amendment to the bill, a provision\r\nexpressly repealing the Act of 1820 in so far as it prohibited slavery\r\nin any of the Territories of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Blair's letter in reference to Mr. Seward's connection\r\nwith Dixon's proposition.]\r\n\r\nIn a letter of May 17th, 1873, to Mr. Gideon Welles, Mr. Montgomery\r\nBlair wrote of Mr. Seward: \"I shall never forget how shocked I was at\r\nhis telling me that he was the man who put Archy Dixon, the Whig\r\nSenator from Kentucky in 1854, up to moving the repeal of the {388}\r\nMissouri compromise, as an amendment to Douglas' first Kansas\r\n[Nebraska?] bill, and had himself forced the repeal by that movement,\r\nand had thus brought to life the Republican Party. Dixon was to\r\nout-Herod Herod at the South, and he was to out-Herod Herod at the\r\nNorth.\"\r\n\r\nIf this be true, it was a most reprehensible trick of unscrupulous\r\npolitics. Mr. Seward scoffed at the doctrine of \"popular sovereignty\"\r\nin the Territories as arrant nonsense, and knew that the assertion of\r\nany such doctrine as a principle of the law of the country in respect\r\nto Territorial organization would rouse the North to angry and bitter\r\nresistance. What he did, he did with his eyes open. His vision did not\r\nprobably reach so far as to civil war, but he knew that the risks of\r\nanother slavery agitation were very grave. Neither could the ambiguity\r\nin Mr. Douglas' bill, and the necessity for relieving it of this\r\nobscurity, palliate such an offense. If he desired to make Mr.\r\nDouglas' bill entirely plain he should have done this, not by holding\r\nout a temptation to the South to enter upon a new course of slavery\r\nextension, but by an amendment asserting the continuing validity of\r\nthe slavery prohibition in the Act of 1820. Mr. Sumner did this very\r\nthing on the next day. It was, however, too late to chain the spirit\r\nwhich Dixon's fatal move had loosed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Douglas and Dixon.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mr. Douglas was surprised and disconcerted by Mr.\r\nDixon's notice, and endeavored to dissuade him from carrying out his\r\nexpressed intention, but was finally convinced by Mr. Dixon that the\r\nproposed amendment was only the fair and honest statement of\r\nconstitutional principles, and of the legal results of the Compromise\r\nof 1850, and only made distinct and express what was unclear, though\r\nimplied, in the bill.\r\n\r\n{389} [Sidenote: Mr. Douglas' new bill.]\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd, Mr. Douglas brought in a new bill, and offered it as a\r\nsubstitute for the original bill. The new bill contained a clause\r\ndeclaring that that part of the Act of 1820 prohibiting slavery in the\r\nLouisiana territory above thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes was\r\ninoperative, being contrary to, and superseded by, the principles of\r\nthe legislation of 1850. Mr. Douglas' new bill changed the southern\r\nboundary from thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes to thirty-seven\r\ndegrees, made the northern boundary run up to the forty-ninth parallel\r\nwest of Minnesota Territory, and cut this vast domain of nearly five\r\nhundred thousand square miles in area into two Territories by the\r\nfortieth parallel of latitude, the one to the north of it to be called\r\nNebraska, and the one to the south of it Kansas. Mr. Dixon immediately\r\nexpressed himself as satisfied with the provisions of the new bill,\r\nand said that they fulfilled the purposes of the amendment which he\r\nhad intended to offer, and that he should, therefore, withhold the\r\nsame. The Senate agreed to take up the bill on the following Monday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Free-soil protest against the bill.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Douglas' reply to the address.]\r\n\r\nOn the same day that Mr. Douglas presented this second bill, there\r\nappeared in the _National Era_, the Abolition journal at Washington,\r\nand in several New York City papers, the noted address, signed by\r\nMessrs. Chase, Sumner, Wade, Smith, and De Witt, in which the Douglas\r\nbill was denounced in the most trenchant language as \"a gross\r\nviolation of a sacred pledge, as a criminal betrayal of precious\r\nrights, as a part and parcel of an atrocious plot to exclude from a\r\nvast unoccupied region immigrants from the Old World and free laborers\r\nfrom our own States, and convert it into a dreary region of despotism\r\ninhabited by masters and slaves.\" The contents of this celebrated\r\npaper constituted, it may be said, the {390} first draft of the creed\r\nof the party to be founded on the doctrine of resistance to slavery\r\nextension, the Republican party. The propositions contained in it\r\ndrove Mr. Douglas to a fierce diatribe against their authors, in which\r\nhe included an elaborate argument in defence of his dictum, that the\r\nMeasures of 1850 had rendered the slavery prohibition in the Act of\r\n1820 inoperative. He contended that the fact that Congress had, in the\r\njoint resolution admitting Texas, provided that in Texan territory\r\nnorth of the line of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes slavery\r\nshould be prohibited, proved that Congress and the people of the\r\nUnited States understood the legislation of 1820 to mean that the line\r\nof thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes was to be run through any and\r\nall territory that might be subsequently acquired by the United\r\nStates; that the refusal of Congress to do this in regard to the\r\nterritory acquired from Mexico had made the establishment of a new\r\nprinciple in regard to slavery in the Territories necessary; that that\r\nprinciple, as established by the legislation of 1850, was the\r\nneutrality of Congress in the question, and the right of the residents\r\nin each Territory to settle the question for themselves; and that this\r\nnew principle had superseded the old principle and rendered all\r\nlegislation under the old principle inoperative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chase's amendment to the bill.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Southern Whigs aroused by Mr. Wade's accusations.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Douglas doctrine convincing to many.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chase's amendment lost.]\r\n\r\nSuch jurisprudence in respect to the effect upon each other of\r\nstatutes relating to different and distinct Territories had never been\r\nheard before, and it was easy to show it to be a tissue of sophistries\r\nfrom beginning to end. It was entirely evident that Mr. Douglas and\r\nhis committee shrank from proposing a bare and bald repeal of the\r\nslavery prohibition in the Act of 1820, and sought to avoid the\r\nresponsibility of doing so under the convenient claim that it had\r\nalready been repealed. But {391} Mr. Chase was determined to make them\r\ntake this responsibility, and to expose their fallacies in their\r\nattempts to escape it. On February 3rd, Mr. Chase moved to remove from\r\nthe bill the words referring to the Measures of 1850, and their effect\r\nupon the Act of 1820, and make the bill simply repeal the slavery\r\nprohibition of the Act of 1820, in so far as it applied to the\r\nTerritories to be organized by the bill. Mr. Chase supported his\r\namendment in a powerful speech, in which he demonstrated most clearly\r\nthe fallacy and the duplicity of the doctrine which held that the\r\nlegislation of 1850 in regard to Utah and New Mexico had repealed the\r\nlegislation of 1820 in regard to the Louisiana territory north of\r\nthirty-six degrees and thirty minutes. Both he and his colleague, Mr.\r\nWade, went, however, too far in denouncing the subterfuge as a\r\nconspiracy between the Southerners and the friends of Douglas to\r\nextend slavery. It was especially imprudent, to say the least, in Mr.\r\nWade to do so. The Southern Whigs were highly incensed at the charge\r\nof conspiring with Northern Democrats, made by one of their own party,\r\nand they repudiated the accusation with great earnestness. Besides\r\nthis, the Douglas idea of \"popular sovereignty,\" or, as we now call\r\nit, home rule, in the Territories, had won many adherents. There is no\r\nquestion that a great many men, in both the North and the South, now\r\nbegan to feel that Mr. Douglas had discovered the true principle in\r\nregard to slavery in the Territories. Mr. Chase's amendment was lost\r\nby a vote of thirty to thirteen. The thirteen voting in favor of the\r\namendment were all from the North. Of those voting against it, ten\r\nwere from the North, and twenty from the South. Nineteen Senators, ten\r\nof whom were from the South, did not vote at all. The {392} vote meant\r\nthat the large majority of those voting held that, in some way or\r\nother, the legislation of 1850 had repealed the slavery prohibition in\r\nthe legislation of 1820. This was execrable jurisprudence, and even\r\nMr. Cass, who was really the father of the idea of home rule in the\r\nTerritories, dissented from it, and voted for Mr. Chase's amendment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Douglas' last change in the wording of the clause.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this support by the majority, Mr. Douglas was apparently\r\ndisquieted by the attitude of Mr. Cass, and by the arguments against\r\nthe correctness of his doctrine. He, himself, now moved to strike out\r\nof the bill the words: \"which was superseded by the principles of the\r\nlegislation of 1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures, and is\r\nhereby declared inoperative,\" and to insert instead thereof the words:\r\n\"which being inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention by\r\nCongress with slavery in the States and Territories, as recognized by\r\nthe legislation of 1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures, is\r\nhereby declared inoperative and void, it being the true intent and\r\nmeaning of this Act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or\r\nState, nor exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof\r\nperfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in\r\ntheir own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Everett's views.]\r\n\r\nIn a most able argument, remarkable both for its strong logic and its\r\nadmirable temper, Mr. Everett demonstrated the weakness of Mr.\r\nDouglas' proposition in its last form, the declaration of\r\ninconsistency between the legislation of 1820 and that of 1850. He\r\nshowed conclusively that, in place of an inconsistency, here were\r\nsimply two policies in reference to different Territories, in which\r\ndifferent conditions and relations obtained. He predicted that the\r\n{393} insistence upon the same policy for all the Territories would\r\nlead to the struggle for determining whether they should be all slave\r\nor all free, and he demonstrated that \"popular sovereignty\" in the\r\nTerritories was an illusion, since Congress could not by any act of\r\nits own divest itself of its duty, laid upon it by the Constitution,\r\nto legislate for the Territories. Mr. Everett was a member of the\r\ncommittee on Territories, from which the bill had proceeded, and his\r\nviews should, on this account, have possessed an added weight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Houston's opposition to the bill.]\r\n\r\nMr. Houston, of Texas, another member of the committee, now declared\r\nhimself against the bill, on the ground, among other reasons, that it\r\nwould reopen the slavery question by the destruction of one of the\r\ngreat measures upon which the settlement of that question rested.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Bell's attitude toward the bill.]\r\n\r\nIt was furthermore suspected that Mr. Bell, of Tennessee, another\r\nmember of the committee, was opposed to the bill. This suspicion\r\nturned out to be true. The bill can hardly be regarded therefore as\r\nhaving been reported by the committee at all. The committee consisted\r\nof six Senators, and it was at last found that it had, at no time,\r\nreceived the support of more than three. Of these three, two were from\r\nthe North, Douglas, of Illinois, and Jones, of Iowa, and one was from\r\nthe South, Johnson, of Arkansas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Douglas' amendment passed by the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe vote upon this amendment was taken on February 15th. Thirty-five\r\nSenators voted for it, and ten against it. Of those voting for it,\r\ntwenty-four were from the North and eleven from the South. Of those\r\nvoting against it, nine were from the North and one, Mr. Houston, was\r\nfrom the South. Mr. Bell voted for the amendment for the reason, as he\r\nafterwards explained, that he thought Mr. Douglas ought to be allowed\r\nto perfect his bill.\r\n\r\n{394} [Sidenote: Mr. Chase's second amendment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Pratt's amendment to Mr. Chase's amendment.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chase now suspected that there might be some catch concealed in\r\nthe last words of the amendment just adopted. These words, it will be\r\nremembered, were: \"subject only to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\" Mr. Chase, therefore, moved to add the words: \"under which\r\nthe people of the Territory, through their appropriate\r\nrepresentatives, may, if they see fit, prohibit the existence of\r\nslavery therein.\" Mr. Chase now put the home rule principle in regard\r\nto slavery in the Territories to the test, for if the people of a\r\nTerritory could not, under the Constitution of the United States,\r\nprohibit slavery in the Territories, then was the Douglas doctrine a\r\nmere deception, a mere jugglery of words. Mr. Chase put his\r\nproposition, however, in a form which appeared one-sided, and Mr.\r\nBadger, of North Carolina, the best constitutional lawyer from the\r\nSouth in the Senate, contended that Mr. Chase's amendment would have\r\nthe effect of denying to the Territories the power to admit slavery,\r\nand thus destroy, from that side, the home rule principle of the bill.\r\nTo remedy this defect, Mr. Pratt moved to amend Mr. Chase's\r\nproposition so as to make it read that the people might introduce or\r\nprohibit slavery in the Territories. But this was an amendment to Mr.\r\nChase's amendment to Mr. Douglas' amendment, and was held to be\r\nunparliamentary, unless Mr. Chase would accept it, and incorporate it\r\ninto his amendment. This he refused to do, on the ground, first, that\r\nhe did not believe that the Territories could, under the Constitution,\r\nintroduce slavery, and, second, on the ground that the union of his\r\nproposition and that of Mr. Pratt in a single amendment would unite\r\nthose who did not believe that the people of a Territory could\r\nintroduce slavery with those who did not believe they could prohibit\r\nslavery {395} against the entire amendment, and probably defeat it,\r\nwhile, if the two propositions could be voted on separately, they\r\nwould both probably pass, and the bill would be cleared of all\r\nambiguity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chase's amendment lost.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chase's attitude toward Mr. Pratt's motion compelled the Senate to\r\nvote upon his proposition separately, and the amendment was lost by a\r\nvote of thirty-six to ten.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Badger's amendment.]\r\n\r\nJust before the close of the debate on Mr. Chase's motion, Mr. Walker,\r\nof Wisconsin, startled the Senate by the declaration that the repeal\r\nof the Act of 1820 prohibiting slavery would revive the old French law\r\nlegitimizing slavery in all of the territory acquired from France.\r\nBoth Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Badger said it would not have that effect,\r\nbut on different grounds. In order to quiet apprehension on this\r\npoint, and remove the difficulty out of the way of the passage of the\r\nbill, Mr. Badger gave notice that so soon as the vote should be taken\r\non Mr. Chase's motion, he should move an amendment to the bill\r\nproviding that \"nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to\r\nrevive or put in force any law or regulation, which may have existed\r\nprior to 1820, either protecting, establishing, prohibiting, or\r\nabolishing slavery.\" After the vote upon Mr. Chase's motion, Mr.\r\nBadger offered this amendment, and it was voted, without debate, by a\r\nvery large majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chase's third amendment.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chase now turned his assaults upon other points of the bill. Mr.\r\nDouglas had been impressed by the taunts of the opponents of the bill\r\nthat home rule was to be granted to the people of the Territories only\r\nupon the subject of slavery, but that they were to continue in all\r\nother respects subject to the control of the general Government, and\r\nhe now moved to strike out the veto power of {396} Congress over\r\nTerritorial legislation, in the cases in hand, and to so modify the\r\nusual veto power of the Territorial governors as to allow a two-thirds\r\nmajority of the Territorial legislatures to overcome it. These\r\npropositions were voted without debate. Whereupon Mr. Chase moved that\r\nthe governors, secretaries, and judges of the two Territories be\r\nelected by the people instead of being appointed by the President.\r\nThis was logical, but it made the \"squatter-sovereignty\" doctrine\r\nridiculous. It was, therefore, rejected with a considerable show of\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chase's fourth amendment.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chase now moved that the whole country should be organized as one\r\nTerritory instead of two. He seemed to anticipate that if two should\r\nbe established at the same time, the slaveholders would claim one.\r\nThis proved to be a correct suspicion. It was subsequently declared\r\nthroughout the South that the purpose in forming two Territories was\r\nto give one to the North and the other to the South. And when the\r\nNorth made the fight for Kansas, it was really felt in the South by\r\nthe mass of the people that a tacit agreement had been violated. The\r\nSenators in favor of the bill had now come to think that Mr. Chase was\r\nsimply endeavoring to discredit the bill, and they quickly voted this\r\nmotion down by a large majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Bell's argument against the bill.]\r\n\r\nDown to this juncture, the bill had been considered in the Senate as a\r\ncommittee of the Whole. It was now reported to the Senate as amended\r\nby this committee, and, on March 3rd, it came to the vote upon its\r\nfinal passage. It was at this point that Mr. Bell revealed his\r\nopposition to the bill, and made his great argument, the greatest\r\neffort of his long and useful life, against it. The speech was chiefly\r\na logical and an eloquent elaboration of the three propositions, that\r\npopular sovereignty could not be {397} established in the Territories\r\nby an Act of Congress, that the passage of the bill before the Senate\r\nattempting it would produce a vast development of the anti-slavery\r\nsentiment at the North, and that no practical benefits whatsoever\r\ncould accrue to the South by the repeal of the restriction upon\r\nslavery extension in the Act of 1820. But the Southerners would not\r\nlisten to these words of wisdom from their own greatest colleague.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Douglas' final argument.]\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas is generally represented as having closed the debate,\r\nalthough Mr. Houston spoke briefly after him in opposition to the\r\nmeasure. Mr. Douglas' argument was masterful from every point of view\r\nbut the highest. His chief proposition was, that, when his committee\r\nwere charged with the duty of framing the bill, they were forced to\r\nchoose between the principle of Congressional intervention in the\r\nTerritories, in the matter of slavery, on the one hand, the principle\r\nof 1820, the principle which had, for thirty years, filled the land\r\nwith agitation and conflict, and had been a standing menace to the\r\nexistence of the Union, and the principle of Congressional\r\nnon-intervention, on the other hand, the principle of the Measures of\r\n1850, the principle which had tranquillized the country and cemented\r\nanew the Union, the principle which both of the two great political\r\nparties had unequivocally approved in their platforms of 1852, and\r\nwhich the people of the whole country had just as unequivocally\r\napproved in the elections of 1852. And his conclusion from this\r\nproposition was, that, as servants of the people who had established\r\nthis principle of Congressional non-intervention, his committee were\r\nmorally obligated to make it the principle of the bill presented by\r\nthem for the organization of the new Territories, and that whoever\r\narraigned him and his committee for so doing virtually arraigned the\r\npeople of the United States. It was a {398} most excellent and refined\r\nbit of demagogy, and it fell upon an audience whose mental _niveau_\r\nwas not quite high enough to distinguish between it and sound\r\nreasoning. He enforced this argument by another piece of catching\r\ndemagogism, which, though not quite so refined, was equally effective.\r\nIt was the proud and boastful assertion that American citizens were\r\ncapable of self-government anywhere, whether in \"States\" or\r\nTerritories, and under all conditions, whether aided by long\r\nestablished customs, or without any such guides to steady them in\r\ntheir progress. It was evident that his opponents preferred to avoid\r\nthis point, and that he was sure he had them upon it. He was so\r\nthoroughly democratic in his own feelings that he entertained no doubt\r\nas to the triumph of his argument when stated in this form.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska bill by the Senate.]\r\n\r\nA few minutes before five o'clock on the morning of March 4th, after a\r\ncontinuous session of seventeen hours, the vote upon the bill was\r\ntaken, resulting in thirty-seven voices in its favor and fourteen\r\nagainst it. Eleven Senators had not voted. Of these, three sent word\r\nthat, if they could have been present, they would have voted for the\r\nbill, and one that he would have voted against it. There were also two\r\nvacancies at the moment, one in the Vermont delegation, and one in\r\nthat of North Carolina. This reduced the number of those who actually\r\nrefrained from voting, though present, to five. These gentlemen were\r\nMr. Everett, of Massachusetts, Mr. Wright, of New Jersey, Mr. Cooper,\r\nof Pennsylvania, Mr. Clayton, of Delaware, and Mr. Pearce, of\r\nMaryland, all Whigs with the exception of Mr. Wright.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Analysis of the vote upon the bill.]\r\n\r\nCounting the names of those who announced how they would have voted\r\nhad they been able to be present, and considering the Commonwealths in\r\nwhose delegations there were vacancies as represented fully by the one\r\n{399} member from each, we may say that, in the Senate, New Hampshire,\r\nMichigan, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, California, Virginia, Kentucky,\r\nMissouri, North Carolina, Arkansas, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Florida, and Louisiana voted for the bill; that Maine,\r\nVermont, Rhode Island, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin voted against the\r\nbill; that Connecticut, Tennessee, and Texas were divided; and that\r\nMassachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland were\r\ndoubtful. Not a single Northern Whig voted for the bill, and only two\r\nNorthern Whigs failed to vote against it. One Southern Whig, Mr. Bell,\r\nvoted against it, and two Southern Whigs, Mr. Clayton and Mr. Pearce,\r\nfailed to vote for it. Every Southern Democrat, except only Mr.\r\nHouston, voted for the bill, while, even if we count Mr. Chase and Mr.\r\nSumner as Democrats, only six Northern Democrats voted against it. The\r\nbill may thus be fairly considered to have been a Western and Southern\r\nmeasure, and a Democratic measure. The Western Democracy, with its\r\ncrude and radical notions about local self-government, invited the\r\nSouth into a position which turned out to be a snare and a pitfall. It\r\nis not meant by this that the Western Democracy was insincere, but\r\nonly that it was crude and vulgarly over self-confident. And it is not\r\nmeant that the South was insincere, but only too eager to vindicate\r\nits honor and dignity, by obliterating the inequality with the North\r\nin regard to the common territory of the Union, under which it fancied\r\nit had suffered since the restriction placed upon slavery extension by\r\nthe Act of 1820.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of popular opposition to the bill.]\r\n\r\nIf the bill had been subjected to the plebiscite on February 1st, it\r\nis very probable that the people in the Northern Commonwealths would\r\nhave sustained the positions taken by their respective Senators. Had\r\nthis been {400} done on March 1st, it is probable that this would not\r\nhave been the case in some of the Northern Commonwealths, whose\r\nSenators voted for the measure. And had it been done on April 1st, it\r\nis practically certain that it would not have been. After February\r\n1st, there was developed throughout the North a very strong opposition\r\nto the bill among the people. The most influential newspapers\r\ndenounced it. Numerous meetings, largely attended, protested against\r\nit. The legislatures of several of the Commonwealths passed\r\nresolutions condemning it. And the clergy generally arraigned it as\r\nimmoral, inhuman, and irreligious. The movements against it seem to\r\nhave been spontaneous and to have been connected with each other only\r\nby the common sentiment against the extension of slavery. It is,\r\nhowever, probable that the Address to the people, issued by Mr. Chase\r\nand his Free-soil friends in the latter part of January, furnished the\r\nnecessary excitant. The Address seems to have been the text from which\r\nmost of these articles, protests, memorials, speeches, and sermons\r\nwere drawn. When the bill was sent to the House of Representatives, it\r\nwas thus evident to all impartial observers that its growing\r\nunpopularity at the North would be a very great obstacle to its\r\npassage by the House. Its friends felt that they must get it through\r\nspeedily or see it lost altogether.\r\n\r\nAlready, on January 31st, Mr. Richardson, of Illinois, Mr. Douglas'\r\nlieutenant in the House of Representatives, had reported from the\r\nHouse committee on Territories a bill for the organization of the\r\nTerritories of Kansas and Nebraska, which was the same in substance\r\nand language as that reported by Mr. Douglas to the Senate. It had\r\nbeen discussed a little in the committee of the Whole House, but had\r\nslumbered there after February 15th.\r\n\r\n{401} [Sidenote: The Kansas-Nebraska bill in the House.]\r\n\r\nOn March 7th, the Senate bill was sent into the House for concurrence.\r\nIt was taken up for consideration on the twenty-first, and, after some\r\nparliamentary passes, was referred to the House committee on\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The relation of the Administration to the bill.]\r\n\r\nSome of the historians teach that this would have been the end of the\r\nbill, except for the interference of President Pierce and his two most\r\ntrusted advisers, Mr. Caleb Cushing and Mr. Jefferson Davis. Mr. Davis\r\nrelates his connection with the matter in his own book. He says that,\r\non Sunday morning, January 22nd, gentlemen from the two Congressional\r\ncommittees on Territories called at his house and asked his aid in\r\nobtaining an interview with the President; that he went with them to\r\nthe executive mansion, and secured for them the desired access to the\r\nPresident; that the President listened patiently to the reading of the\r\nbill for organizing Kansas and Nebraska; and that the President\r\ndecided that the bill \"rested upon sound constitutional principles,\r\nand recognized in it only a return to that rule which had been\r\ninfringed by the Compromise of 1820, and the restoration of which had\r\nbeen foreshadowed by the legislation of 1850.\" Mr. Davis furthermore\r\nspecifically denies that the measure was inspired by President Pierce\r\nor any member of his Cabinet. Of course, though not inspired, it may\r\nhave been aided on the way of its passage through Congress by the\r\nAdministration. The proof upon which these historians chiefly rely, in\r\ntheir assertion that it was so aided, was the fact that the editorials\r\nin the Washington _Union_ supported the bill, and the claim that this\r\npaper was the organ of the Administration. But Mr. Sidney Webster,\r\nPresident Pierce's private secretary at the time, has recently\r\ndeclared that the Washington _Union_ was not President {402} Pierce's\r\norgan in the Kansas-Nebraska matter, or in any other matter; that\r\nPresident Pierce had no organ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Pierce and Mr. Davis.]\r\n\r\nThe character of President Pierce was that of a punctilious gentleman.\r\nMr. Davis resembled him much in this general trait. In fact, it was\r\nsaid to have been this likeness which drew them so closely together in\r\ntheir friendship for each other. Men of such character are not\r\ninclined to meddle, and a strong positive evidence is necessary to\r\nsubstantiate any such charge against them. There is no doubt that the\r\nPresident's view of the doctrine of the bill was well known. There is\r\nno doubt that there were members of Congress who made a chief point of\r\ncoinciding with the Administration upon every subject, and who thought\r\nthat such servility would give weight to their recommendations for\r\nofficial positions. And there is no doubt that the President appointed\r\nsome persons to office recommended by such members. But no\r\nsatisfactory evidence has been as yet produced to prove that President\r\nPierce gave or promised any patronage to any member for supporting the\r\nbill, or withheld any to punish any member for not supporting it. In\r\nfact, the President's attitude toward the two factions of the\r\nDemocratic party in New York in the matter of appointments, making\r\nselections from both in almost equal numbers, without regard to the\r\nFree-soil sentiments of the \"Softs,\" manifests a quite different\r\nspirit from that with which these historians represent him to have\r\nbeen animated in meddling with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nbill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's consistency.]\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the inconsistency which these historians find between\r\nthe President's message of December preceding and his attitude toward\r\nthe Kansas-Nebraska bill can be so explained as to appear a perfect\r\nconsistency. What the President said in his message was that the {403}\r\nacquiescence of distinguished citizens in the Compromise Measures of\r\n1850 had given renewed vigor to our institutions, and restored a sense\r\nof repose and security to the public mind throughout the Union, and\r\nthat this repose should suffer no shock during his official term. If,\r\nnow, we consider these measures of 1850 as containing the principle of\r\nhome rule in the Territories in regard to the question of slavery, and\r\nif we attribute the repose of the public mind upon this subject to\r\nthat principle, would it not be maintaining that repose to apply this\r\nprinciple in the organization of the new Territories, and would it not\r\nbe destructive of that repose to undertake to settle the slavery\r\nquestion in the new Territories by an act of Congress, either original\r\nor confirmatory? This view is certainly intelligible. It was professed\r\nand advanced by all the supporters of the bill. It was unquestionably\r\nthe view which the President took of the matter. It proved to be an\r\nerroneous view, but the views which mortal men hold, and\r\nconscientiously hold, are very frequently erroneous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill taken up in the committee of the Whole of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. A. H. Stephens' management of the bill.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill passed and signed by the President.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate bill slept in the committee of the Whole of the House of\r\nRepresentatives from March 21st until May 8th. During this period its\r\nfriends were undoubtedly working for it, and its opponents against it.\r\nBy the latter date the leaders in favor of the bill knew that they had\r\na reliable majority in the House, and, on that day, Mr. Richardson\r\nmoved that the House go into committee of the Whole, for the purpose\r\nof taking up the House Kansas-Nebraska bill for consideration. After\r\nmuch parliamentary fencing, this was accomplished. Mr. Richardson then\r\nproposed to substitute the Senate bill, shorn of the provision in it\r\nconfining suffrage and office-holding in these Territories {404} to\r\nAmerican citizens, for the House bill. The opponents of the bill now\r\nentered upon a course of obstruction, and, although there was a safe\r\nmajority of about twenty in favor of the bill, they prevented such a\r\nvote being taken in the committee of the Whole, as would bring the\r\nmatter to a crisis, for about two weeks. By this time Mr. Richardson\r\nseems to have been completely demoralized, and Mr. Alexander H.\r\nStephens came forward and took the management of the bill into his own\r\nhands. He moved to strike out the enacting clause of the House bill.\r\nAccording to the rules of the House, this motion took the precedence\r\nof all motions to amend, and the effect of it would be, if passed,\r\nequivalent to the rejection of the bill, upon the happening of which\r\nthe committee must rise and report its action to the House. The House\r\ncould then refuse to concur with the report of the committee of the\r\nWhole, upon the happening of which Mr. Richardson could then offer the\r\nSenate bill, as a substitute, in the House, and in the House the\r\nobstructive tactics of the opposition could be dealt with as they\r\ncould not be in the committee of the Whole. Mr. Stephens explained his\r\ntactics to the committee, in order that the friends of the bill might\r\nknow how to vote. The opponents of the bill called this procedure a\r\nnew \"gag,\" but Mr. Stephens remained firm, and drove the Senate bill\r\nin this manner through the House by a vote of one hundred and thirteen\r\nto one hundred. The Senate concurred in the omission of the provision\r\nlimiting suffrage and office-holding in the Territories to American\r\ncitizens; and the President signed the bill, on May 30th.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Analysis of the vote on the bill in the House.]\r\n\r\nEighty-seven members from the North, of whom forty-five were Whigs,\r\ncounting the Free-soilers as Whigs, and forty-two of whom were\r\nDemocrats, voted against {405} the bill; while only forty-four members\r\nfrom the North, all Democrats, voted for it. Sixty-nine members from\r\nthe South, of whom fifty-seven were Democrats and twelve were Whigs,\r\nvoted for the bill; while seven Whigs and two Democrats from the South\r\nvoted against it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What the figures taught.]\r\n\r\nThese figures pretty well disposed of the claim that the bill was a\r\ntender from the North to the South. It was simply a Western and\r\nSouthern Democratic measure. Taken together with the vote in the\r\nSenate, these figures also showed that the Whig party was a party\r\nopposed to slavery extension, unanimously so in the North, and in some\r\ndegree in the South. They revealed that the Whig party in the North\r\nwas to be merged in a Northern party with the Free-soil element of the\r\nDemocratic party, and was to be overwhelmed in the South by the union\r\nof the proslavery-extension Whigs with the Democrats. They indicated\r\nthat one sectional party was soon to hold the majority in the North,\r\nand another in the South; and gave thus the fearful warning that the\r\nNorth was, at last, to be arrayed against the South upon the subject\r\nwhich was of greater interest to the South, in the minds of the\r\nslaveholders, than the Union itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Kansas-Nebraska Act a stupendous fallacy.]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the present, we are compelled to regard the\r\npassage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act as probably the greatest error\r\nwhich the Congress of the United States ever committed, and the\r\narguments by which it was supported as among the most specious\r\nfallacies that have ever misled the minds of men. We must take this\r\nground, unless we assume that we could not have solved the slavery\r\nproblem in any other way than we did, and at any less cost. If we make\r\nthis assumption, we may then consider this Act as providential, in\r\n{406} that it precipitated a crisis, which was bound to come, and\r\nwhich would only have been made more terrible by delay. While,\r\nhowever, we of the succeeding generation may explain the place of this\r\nAct in our history in this way, no considerations of this kind can\r\njustify the men who produced it, and placed it upon the statute-book.\r\nThat God should \"make the wrath of man to praise him\" does not excuse\r\nthe wrath of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{407}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR KANSAS\r\n\r\nEli Thayer and His Emigrant Aid Scheme--Reports in Regard to its\r\nCharacter and Purposes--The Missouri \"Border Ruffian\" of\r\n1854--Nebraska for the North and Kansas for the South--General\r\nAtchison--Dr. Charles Robinson--The First Party of Emigrants--The\r\n\"Platte County Self-defensive Association\"--The Founding of\r\nLawrence--First Invasion of the Missourians--Governor A.

Buchanan, Mason, and Soule, advising the acquisition of\r\nCuba by the United States, together with the preparation of\r\nfilibustering expeditions in the South for the execution of this and\r\nsimilar designs, all coming within the same year, 1854, seemed to be\r\nsufficient evidence of a fixed plan among the slaveholders for the\r\nextension of slavery and the increase of the number of slaveholding\r\nCommonwealths in the Union, and roused the people of the North to an\r\nappreciation of the impending danger and to extraordinary exertions\r\nfor meeting the same and warding it off.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eli Thayer and his emigrant aid scheme.]\r\n\r\nDuring the debate upon the Kansas-Nebraska bill in Congress, it does\r\nnot seem to have been generally appreciated that it might, after all,\r\nturn out to be a Free-soil measure, and that the question whether it\r\nwould be such or not in a specific case resolved itself into the\r\nproblem of immigration. There lived, however, in the town of\r\nWorcester, Mass., a shrewd, far seeing business man, with whose\r\nshrewdness, however, ideality and patriotism were mingled in an\r\nuncommon degree, who immediately comprehended the situation from this\r\npoint of view. This man was the now well known and universally honored\r\nEli Thayer. Before the Kansas-Nebraska bill had become law, the idea\r\nin his mind had ripened into a wide-reaching plan. This plan was the\r\norganization of an emigrant aid society, with an immense capital, the\r\npurpose of which should be to foster emigration from the Northern\r\nCommonwealths and the European states into the Territories and the\r\nslaveholding Commonwealths of the Union, to the end that a Free-soil\r\npopulation should gain control of them, and prohibit or abolish\r\nslavery in them by their {409} own local acts. Mr. Thayer reasoned\r\nwith himself that masters would be very timid about immigrating into a\r\nTerritory with their slaves until the question should be determined\r\nwhether slavery should have a legal existence in the Territory, while\r\nmen without such impediments would go boldly forward and occupy the\r\ncountry, and vote the free status for the Territory; and again, that\r\nwith only about one-fourth of the white population of the slaveholding\r\nCommonwealths pecuniarily interested in slavery, the immigration of a\r\nfew thousand active anti-slavery men into these would finally turn the\r\nbalance at the polls against the further existence of the institution\r\nin the slaveholding Commonwealths themselves. The plan was so\r\ncomprehensive that most of Mr. Thayer's friends thought it visionary,\r\nand he modified it, after having obtained his charter from the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts, limiting it to the settlement of the\r\nTerritories, and especially to that of Kansas Territory, by\r\nanti-slavery men. The organization, as thus finally effected, counted\r\namong its directors some of the purest, most patriotic, and most\r\ncapable men of the country--Mr. A. A. Lawrence, Dr. Samuel Cabot, Mr.\r\nJohn Lowell, Mr. Moses H. Grinnell, Rev. Edward E. Hale, Rev. Horace\r\nBushnell, Professor Benjamin Silliman, and others of the like fame and\r\nfortune. The way in which they proposed to accomplish their purpose\r\nwas by lessening the hardships of the journey to the distant country,\r\nand the hardships of life in the new country. They proposed to\r\norganize the emigrants into companies, procure transportation for them\r\nat the most favorable rates, build hotels, boarding-houses, mills,\r\nschool-houses, churches--in a word to send capital in advance of\r\npopulation, in order to attract a good, law-abiding population by\r\nplanting for them the advantages and conveniences of civilization in\r\nthe new country. It was a {410} noble scheme, and none the less so\r\nbecause of the idea of making it pay ultimately as a business venture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not an entirely new thing in American history.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Denunciations of it as an odious innovation.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that it was a movement entirely new in American\r\nhistory, although this was charged by many of the politicians, both of\r\nthe North and of the South. A number of the American colonies were\r\noriginally planted under the auspices of corporations in the\r\nmotherland, and others were formed by companies of immigrants for the\r\npurpose of securing more freedom than the Old World afforded. It is\r\ndifficult to see how any objection could have been found to such an\r\nassociation, animated with such motives and purposes, and operating\r\nthrough such means, and yet it was charged, even by Northern men, with\r\nthe responsibility for all the outrages perpetrated in Kansas during\r\nthe stormy period of 1855-56. Even the President of the United States\r\ndenounced it with great severity.\r\n\r\nThe view held by the President and his friends, both of the North and\r\nof the South, was that no aid should be allowed to be given, and no\r\nincentive offered, by any person or organization to any other person,\r\nto go to, and settle in, the common Territories of the Union, but that\r\nevery emigrant should go entirely upon his own impulse, and be\r\nsustained entirely by his own means. This they regarded as the only\r\nnatural and fair method for carrying into effect the principle of\r\npopular sovereignty in the Territories. Such a view was a perfect\r\ntravesty of popular liberty, and manifests the tyranny which slavery\r\nwas imposing upon the minds of freemen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The organization of Mr. Thayer's company.]\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer's company was never organized under its original charter,\r\nbut under a charter obtained in 1855. During the period when the\r\ncounter movements, to be described, were set on foot against it in\r\nMissouri, it had no corporate existence at all, but was a movement\r\n{411} conducted by three private gentlemen, Mr. Thayer, Mr. Lawrence,\r\nand Mr. J. M. S. Williams. Moreover, the establishments which they\r\nfounded in Kansas were open to use by immigrants from any and every\r\npart of the Union, or of the world, without distinction. Such was the\r\norganization which was made the justification, or better the\r\nsubterfuge, for excesses, which had never before been committed in the\r\nhistory of the building of the Commonwealths of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reports in regard to its character and purposes.]\r\n\r\nDuring the early summer of 1854, exaggerated and false reports in\r\nregard to the character, purposes, and means of the proposed Emigrant\r\nAid Company were circulated through Missouri and the entire South. It\r\nwas said that an organization, chartered by the legislature of\r\nMassachusetts, possessing an immense capital, was preparing to\r\nabolitionize Kansas by means of military colonies, recruited from the\r\nslums of the Eastern cities, and planted in Kansas with all the\r\nmunitions of war, to be used not only when necessary for their own\r\ndefence, but for keeping out immigrants from the South. The notorious\r\nB. F. Stringfellow, co-editor with one Kelly of the _Squatter\r\nSovereign_, a paper published at Atchison, which professed to be the\r\norgan of the Washington Government in western Missouri, rang the\r\nchanges upon these misrepresentations in his newspaper, and advised\r\nthat the emigrants sent out by the Aid Society be met with the weapons\r\nof their choice, which he charged were those of violence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Missouri \"border ruffian\" of 1854.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nebraska for the North and Kansas for the South.]\r\n\r\nThe population of western Missouri was then such as to receive ready\r\nimpression from such representations, and respond heartily to such\r\ncounsel. This region was then the frontier between civilization and\r\nsavagery, and into it had gathered a horde of desperate characters,\r\n{412} vulgar, fearless, brutal, without respect for civilization or\r\nreverence for God, usually inflamed with whiskey and stained with\r\ntobacco, gambling by day and jayhawking by night, always ready for any\r\nadventure which promised fun, blood, or booty. It is true that they\r\nhad no special interest in slavery. They were simply the ready\r\nmaterial out of which the slaveholders of Missouri might recruit their\r\nmercenaries for any villainous work which might be found necessary.\r\nSuch was the Missouri \"border ruffian\" of 1854. It must not be\r\nunderstood that western Missouri contained no other sort of people.\r\nThere were many generous-hearted, fair-minded, upright men there,\r\namong both the slaveholders and the non-slaveholders, who would no\r\nsooner have done wrong than suffered wrong. Most of them felt,\r\nhowever, that Kansas for the South and slavery, and Nebraska for the\r\nNorth, was the fair thing, the only fair thing, the thing understood\r\nand intended in the organization of the two Territories by one Act,\r\nand that any attempt on the part of the North to make Kansas a\r\nnon-slaveholding Territory was a breach of faith, which ought to be\r\nresisted by the South, and especially by Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Atchison.]\r\n\r\nGeneral D. R. Atchison was such a man, and such was his view of the\r\ncase. He was, at the time, the leading man of western Missouri, had\r\nrepresented Missouri in the Senate of the United States, and had been\r\npresident _pro tem._ of the Senate. His opinion and his advice\r\nnaturally determined the course which the people of western Missouri\r\nwould pursue toward Kansas. In justice to his memory, however, it must\r\nbe said that, while he was resolved to make Kansas a slaveholding\r\nTerritory, and then a slaveholding Commonwealth, his presence and\r\ncounsel exerted a moderating influence upon his fierce and reckless\r\nfollowers. He {413} left Washington soon after the passage of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Act, and repaired to the scene of the coming conflict,\r\nfor the purpose of organizing and conducting his forces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Charles Robinson.]\r\n\r\nIn June of 1854, Mr. Thayer, Mr. Lawrence, and Mr. Williams invited\r\nDr. Charles Robinson, of Fitchburg, Mass., to meet them in council, in\r\nregard to the projects of the Emigrant Aid Company. Dr. Robinson was a\r\nprominent \"forty-niner,\" and the leader of the California squatters in\r\nthe war against the Sutter land claims. He was shrewd, calm,\r\ncourageous, and full of expedients. These qualities, together with his\r\nlarge experience in organizing the forces of an embryonic\r\nCommonwealth, fitted him exactly for the work which Mr. Thayer and his\r\ncolleagues were seeking to accomplish. Dr. Robinson was not an\r\nAbolitionist, and neither was Thayer, Lawrence, nor Williams. They\r\nwere simply working to prevent the extension of slavery. They were all\r\nWhigs or Free-soil Democrats. They were thus by their moderation in\r\nprinciples and their conservatism in character admirably fitted to\r\nundertake the great work of making Kansas a free Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. C. H. Branscomb.]\r\n\r\nThe conference resulted in the sending of Dr. Robinson to the front to\r\ninspect the Territory of Kansas and make arrangements for settlements.\r\nAccompanied by Mr. C. H. Branscomb, a young lawyer, of Holyoke, Mass.,\r\nhe started for Kansas in the last days of June, 1854. They went by way\r\nof St. Louis and Kansas City. When they arrived in Missouri they found\r\nthe excitement in reference to the reported doings of the Emigrant Aid\r\nCompany already at a high pitch. They heard threats that no\r\nanti-slavery man would be allowed to settle in Kansas, and they heard\r\nof rewards offered for the head of Eli Thayer. They found also that a\r\ngoodly number of pro-slavery Missourians had already {414} immigrated\r\ninto the Territory, had held a popular convention or assembly at Salt\r\nCreek Valley, at which they had declared slavery to be an existing\r\ninstitution in the Territory, and called upon its friends to aid in\r\nits firmer establishment and its wider extension.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Robinson and Mr. Branscomb in Kansas.]\r\n\r\nFrom Kansas City Mr. Branscomb proceeded alone up the Kansas River to\r\nFort Riley, while Dr. Robinson went up the Missouri to Fort\r\nLeavenworth. The Doctor found surveyors laying off a town near Fort\r\nLeavenworth, despite the fact that the Government at Washington had\r\nnot yet opened the country for purchase. He immediately returned to\r\nKansas City, where he received a letter from Boston informing him that\r\nthe first party of emigrants was on the eve of starting for Kansas,\r\nand instructing him to join them at St. Louis. Upon meeting them at\r\nSt. Louis, a letter was handed him asking for his immediate presence\r\nin Boston. He wrote to Mr. Branscomb to join the party at Kansas City\r\nand lead them to a settlement, while he himself hurried to Boston.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first party of emigrants.]\r\n\r\nMr. Branscomb and a Colonel Blood, of Wisconsin, who had also been\r\nsent out by Mr. Lawrence, met the emigrants at Kansas City, and, after\r\na good deal of deliberation, led them to the spot on the Kansas River,\r\nabove the confluence of the Wakarusa with the Kansas, on which the\r\ntown of Lawrence was afterward built.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Platte County self-defensive association.\"]\r\n\r\nA few days before this first party of emigrants had arrived from the\r\nEast, a meeting of residents of Platte County in Missouri took place\r\nat Weston, and, under the lead of B. F. Stringfellow, an organization\r\nwas formed, which called itself the \"Platte County Self-defensive\r\nAssociation,\" with the declared purpose of aiding in the removal of\r\nall persons from the soil of Kansas who might go there through {415}\r\nthe aid or protection or guidance of emigrant aid societies in the\r\nNorth. Other such associations were formed in other localities of\r\nwestern Missouri, and before the autumn of 1854 had hardly opened,\r\nfrom five to ten thousand persons, mostly desperate and reckless\r\ncharacters, were organized in the border counties of western Missouri,\r\nand ready to invade Kansas for the purpose of protecting the settlers\r\nin the Territory from Missouri and the South generally in the\r\nexclusive possession of the Territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The founding of Lawrence.]\r\n\r\nIn September, the little party of about thirty men, who had pitched\r\ntheir tents upon the site of the present city of Lawrence, were joined\r\nby Dr. Robinson and S. C. Pomeroy, with the second party from the\r\nEast, numbering some two hundred men. Upon the arrival of these the\r\nwork of laying out and building the town was begun, and the place was\r\nnamed, in honor of the strong financial supporter of the Emigrant Aid\r\nenterprise, Lawrence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First invasion of the Missourians.]\r\n\r\nWhen the first party arrived at the site they found it occupied by a\r\nsingle settler, named Stearns. Mr. Branscomb immediately purchased\r\nStearns' claim and improvements for the company. The Missourians had,\r\nhowever, rushed into the Territory, at the earliest moment after the\r\npassage of the organic Act, and marked all the best lands as taken,\r\nleaving very little for bona fide settlers. As the result of this\r\nprocedure, another claimant to the site of Lawrence soon appeared, one\r\nJohn Baldwin, and ordered the Yankees to decamp. Robinson proposed\r\nthat each settler be left in possession until some authorized tribunal\r\ncould pass upon the claims, and declared that his party would hold\r\npossession until removed by a legal act. Baldwin and his party\r\nrejected the proposition, and summoned their Missouri friends to\r\nassist them. Some came, {416} but not enough to overcome the Yankees.\r\nThe Yankees stood firm and the Missourians retired, declaring that\r\nthey would come again, and breathing out threats of war and bloodshed\r\nupon their return. This was October 6th, 1854, and such was the first\r\ninvasion of the Missourians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Governor A. H. Reeder.]\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the Governor of the Territory, the President's\r\nrepresentative, the Hon. A. H. Reeder, of Pennsylvania, arrived at\r\nFort Leavenworth, and began his regime in the Territory. From this\r\ntime forward the history of the Territory is the resultant of four\r\nelemental forces in contact with each other--the general Government,\r\nthe pro-slavery inhabitants, the anti-slavery inhabitants, and the\r\nMissourians.\r\n\r\nGovernor Reeder was a genial, intelligent, upright man, a good lawyer\r\nand a fine orator. He was a Union-loving Democrat, and a firm believer\r\nin the doctrine of home rule in the Territories. He declared that he\r\nwould maintain peace and order in the Territory, and immediately set\r\nout on a tour of inspection through the Territory. After having\r\nfinished this, he caused the Territory to be districted, and ordered\r\nthe election of a delegate to Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second invasion of the Missourians and the election of\r\nthe delegate to Congress.]\r\n\r\nThere is little question that at the moment a majority of the bona\r\nfide settlers in the Territory were pro-slavery, and would have\r\nelected the delegate to Congress without any outside aid, but the\r\npro-slavery men in Kansas and Missouri had become excited by the\r\nrumors of the vast schemes in the East for planting anti-slavery\r\nmilitary colonies in the Territories, and also in the slaveholding\r\nCommonwealths, and were in no state of mind to think quietly and act\r\ncalmly. They felt that they must make sure of all of the elements of\r\ngovernment in {417} Kansas at the outset. The Missourians consequently\r\ncommitted the fatal and unnecessary blunder of going over into Kansas,\r\nto the number of some seventeen hundred or more, and voting for the\r\npro-slavery candidate for Congress, J. W. Whitfield, who was thus\r\nelected by a large majority. Without the vote of the Missourians,\r\nWhitfield had still a substantial majority, but this travesty of the\r\nprinciple of home rule in the Territories, this pollution of\r\nrepublican principles at the very fountain-head, roused the North to\r\nthe highest pitch of indignation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The indignation of the North.]\r\n\r\nThis election took place on November 29th, 1854. Had it occurred\r\nbefore the Congressional elections of that year, it would most\r\nprobably have caused a much more rapid development of the Republican\r\nparty than happened, and the election of the Republican candidate for\r\nthe presidency two years later. As it was, the struggle over the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill, and its final passage, had started the\r\namalgamation of the Northern Whigs, the Free-soilers, and the Northern\r\nDemocrats who opposed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, into the\r\nRepublican party, and had, in the Congressional elections of 1854,\r\nbeen the chief cause in changing a Democratic majority of more than\r\neighty in the House of Representatives into a minority by more than\r\nseventy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Republican party.]\r\n\r\nOf course the disintegration of the two old parties would, under\r\nordinary conditions, proceed slowly. The members of neither were\r\nwilling to enter the organization, or bear the name, of the other. As\r\nthe Northern Whigs had unanimously opposed the repeal of the\r\nrestriction of 1820 upon slavery in the Territories, it was not\r\nunnatural that they should at first feel that they were already the\r\nanti-slavery-extension party, and that all persons holding to that\r\nprinciple should be {418} willing to march under their banner. Some of\r\nthe more liberal minds among them in the Northwest, especially in\r\nWisconsin and Michigan, had, already in the summer of 1854, joined\r\nwith the Free-soilers, and the Democrats who opposed the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise, to form a new party, under a new name, the\r\nRepublican party, which, indeed, had no other principle than that\r\nalready represented by the Northern Whigs, but which did not repel the\r\nDemocrats by requiring them to desert to their old enemy. The great\r\nmajority of both Whigs and Democrats were, however, rather waiting to\r\nsee how home rule in the Territories would work, and were in the\r\nmeantime busying themselves, in large degree, with other questions,\r\nchief among which was the question whether the country ought not to be\r\npreserved against foreign Roman Catholic immigration, the question\r\nwhich gave rise to the short-lived Know-nothing party, with its\r\nprinciple of America for Americans, the only real service of which\r\nmovement was the aid which it lent to the dissolution of the Whig\r\nparty, and to the preparation of the way for the union of the Northern\r\nWhigs with the anti-slavery-extension elements of the other parties\r\ninto the Republican party.\r\n\r\nThe interference of the Missourians in the first election in Kansas,\r\ndemonstrating the impracticability of \"popular sovereignty\" in the\r\nTerritories, was the very thing necessary to hasten the development of\r\nthe Republican party, but it came too late to influence the elections\r\nof 1854, and the shock which it caused lost some of the sharpness of\r\nits effect before the autumn of 1856.\r\n\r\nThe Congress to which Whitfield presented his credentials was the one\r\nwhose House of Representatives had been chosen in 1852. His claim to\r\nhis seat was at first not resisted, and the first step in the\r\nprogramme for making Kansas a slaveholding Territory was thus\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n{419} [Sidenote: The Territorial legislature.]\r\n\r\nOf far more importance, however, than the election of the delegate to\r\nCongress was the election of the members of the first Territorial\r\nlegislature, since, according to the principle of \"popular\r\nsovereignty\" in the Territories, it would have the power probably of\r\ndetermining primarily the legality or illegality of slavery in Kansas.\r\n\r\nIn February of 1855, the Territorial authorities took a census of the\r\ninhabitants of the Territory, and it was estimated that there were\r\nbetween eight and nine thousand bona fide settlers in the Territory,\r\nabout three thousand of whom were voters. It was also found that about\r\nfour-sevenths of the legal voters had emigrated from the South. It is\r\nnot probable, however, that all of these were pro-slavery men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The third invasion of the Missourians.]\r\n\r\nMarch 13th following was the day appointed for the election. All\r\nthrough the month the Missourians of the border counties were\r\nassembling in their \"Blue Lodges,\" arming, organizing and drilling. On\r\nthe day of the election some four or five thousand of them marched,\r\nfully armed, to the voting places in the more eastern districts of the\r\nTerritory, and compelled the acceptance of their ballots by the\r\nregular judges of the elections, or by judges appointed by themselves.\r\nAbout six thousand three hundred votes were cast at this election, and\r\nit was estimated that three-fourths of them were cast by the Missouri\r\ninvaders. Some of them pretended to be residents of the Territory, but\r\nmost of those who thought it necessary to justify the procedure at all\r\nclaimed that the Emigrant Aid Company had sent out men for the sole\r\npurpose of voting, and that their own action was retaliatory. The\r\ninvasion was a notoriously public deed. The Missourians came in\r\ncompanies, with music and banners, and made no attempt at concealment.\r\nThe {420} Governor of the Territory resided, at the time, near the\r\nMissouri border, and probably had ocular proof of the outrage. The\r\nanti-slavery men thought that he would set the entire election aside.\r\nHe did call for protests, and appointed April 5th as the time for\r\nhearing the same and canvassing the returns.\r\n\r\nWhen the day arrived protests had been received from only six or seven\r\nof the eighteen election districts, and affected the elections of not\r\nmore than three of the thirteen persons returned as elected to the\r\nupper house, and of not more than nine of the twenty-six persons\r\nreturned as elected to the lower house, of the Territorial\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Governor Reeder and the Territorial elections.]\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson and the anti-slavery men who had gathered about the\r\nGovernor as a sort of body-guard wanted the Governor to declare the\r\nentire election null and void, but the Governor was a good lawyer, and\r\nhe quickly determined that he could not pronounce an election null and\r\nvoid in a district from which no charges of fraud were presented, on\r\naccount of fraud charged in some other district, and that he could not\r\nrefuse his certificate to any one elected on the face of the returns,\r\nif nobody disputed the regularity of his election. Upon examining the\r\ndisputed cases he decided to refuse his certificate to eight of the\r\ntwelve persons chosen on the face of the disputed returns. Thirty-one\r\nmembers were thus duly qualified to take their seats, and new\r\nelections for eight seats were ordered. Of these thirty-one,\r\ntwenty-eight were counted as pro-slavery men, a large majority in both\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson and the anti-slavery men found great fault with the\r\nGovernor, and charged him with being frightened out of his original\r\npurpose to set the entire election aside, but it is difficult to see\r\nhow he could have done this without protests against the return of\r\neach {421} and every person. It would certainly have been an arbitrary\r\nprocedure to have done so. If the anti-slavery men were not brave\r\nenough to protest, it certainly did not become them to taunt the\r\nGovernor with backing down, when they gave him nothing upon which to\r\nbase the refusal to issue his certificates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new elections to the legislative seats unfilled at the\r\nfirst elections.]\r\n\r\nThe 22nd day of the following month (May) was appointed for holding\r\nthe elections for the seats declared unfilled by the Governor. The\r\nanti-slavery candidates were elected to all of them. The pro-slavery\r\nmen ignored the election. This meant that those holding the Governor's\r\ncertificate by virtue of this election would be rejected by the\r\nlegislature itself, and those returned as elected at the first\r\nelection would be seated, under the power of the legislature to\r\ndetermine finally upon the legitimacy of its members. This happened as\r\nsoon as the legislature assembled and organized itself in the first\r\ndays of July.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The organization of the first legislature of Kansas\r\nTerritory.]\r\n\r\nThe legislature as thus organized contained only a single anti-slavery\r\nman, a Mr. Houston, and he voluntarily vacated his seat a few weeks\r\nlater in great disgust. From a technical point of view this\r\nlegislature was a legitimate body, but from a moral and a political\r\npoint of view it did not represent the people of the Territory. It\r\nrepresented simply the pro-slavery party, and used its powers in utter\r\ndisregard of justice and right reason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The problem for the anti-slavery men. Dr. Robinson's plan.]\r\n\r\nThe great problem for the anti-slavery men now was to repudiate the\r\njurisdiction of this legislature without rebelling against the general\r\nGovernment and its agent in the Territory, the Governor. Dr. Robinson\r\nhad had the experience in California of aiding to make a Commonwealth\r\nin the Union, without the transitional period of {422} Territorial\r\norganization. He now applied this experience to the solution of the\r\nKansas question.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Dr. Robinson and his colleagues was, to hold a convention\r\nof the people of the Territory for the purpose of framing an organic\r\nstatute for Commonwealth government, which, after adoption by the\r\npeople, should be sent to Congress, with a petition for the admission\r\nof Kansas into the Union as a Commonwealth. They proposed in the\r\nmeantime to get on without any Territorial government as best they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nTheir idea was, in the second place, to ignore the Territorial\r\ngovernment altogether as bogus, but to yield obedience to the\r\nofficials of the general Government in the Territory. This distinction\r\nmight be made, so far as the Territorial legislature was concerned,\r\nupon the \"popular sovereignty\" principle. The difficulty was in\r\napplying it to the Governor and the Territorial judges appointed by\r\nthe President. To distinguish between their functions in such a way as\r\nto deny their authority when administering the acts of the Territorial\r\nlegislature, and yield to it when administering the acts of Congress\r\nin the Territory, was certainly a very delicate procedure, if possible\r\nat all. Such distinctions would have to be very clearly understood,\r\nand very correctly applied in each case, in order to avoid the charge\r\nof rebellion and treason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflict between the Governor and the Territorial\r\nlegislature.]\r\n\r\nHad the Governor remained true to the legislature it is possible that\r\nthis plan of rebellion against the Territorial government might have\r\nbeen suppressed at the outset, but such was not to be the course of\r\nhistory. He called the legislature to assemble at Pawnee on July 2nd.\r\nIt remained in session there only four days. It did little more than\r\nunseat the persons holding the Governor's certificate by virtue of the\r\nsecond election, and seat {423} those to whom he had denied his\r\ncertificate on account of fraud at the first election. It then\r\nadjourned itself to Shawnee Mission, a place nearer the Missouri\r\nborder. The Governor denied the power of the legislature to do this,\r\nsince by the Act organizing the Territory, the legislature must first\r\nmeet at the time and place appointed by the Governor, and was vested\r\nby the Act with power, thereafter, only over the time of commencing\r\nits regular sessions. The Governor vetoed the proposition of the\r\nlegislature to change its place of meeting. The legislature passed the\r\nproject over his veto, and removed to Shawnee Mission; after which the\r\nGovernor broke off all official connection with it. There is little\r\ndoubt that the pro-slavery legislature wanted to be where it could be\r\neasily supported by the Missourians, and that the Governor considered\r\nthis a menace to his own independence, and an outrage upon the people\r\nof Kansas, and upon the principle of \"popular sovereignty\" in the\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sharpe's riles.]\r\n\r\nThe attitude now assumed by the Governor toward the legislature at\r\nShawnee Mission was a great encouragement to the anti-slavery men. Dr.\r\nRobinson had already sent to Mr. Thayer for Sharpe's rifles, and, at\r\nthe time of the Governor's quarrel with the legislature, a sufficient\r\nnumber of these had arrived to furnish almost every anti-slavery man\r\nwith a good outfit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Factional movements among the anti-slavery men suppressed.]\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson had, at the same time, overcome the attempts of James S.\r\nLane to separate the anti-slavery men into parties, by the\r\norganization of a Democratic party in Kansas. In a powerful speech at\r\nLawrence, on July 4th, 1855, the Doctor convinced his hearers of the\r\nnecessity for all anti-slavery men standing together until Kansas\r\nshould be admitted into the Union as a {424} non-slaveholding\r\nCommonwealth. It was in this address that the Doctor repudiated the\r\nexisting legislature as a Missouri institution, advising resistance to\r\nthe execution of its acts, and made his noted declaration, that, if\r\nslavery in Missouri was impossible with freedom in Kansas, then\r\nslavery in Missouri must die in order that freedom in Kansas might\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excitement in Missouri and throughout the country over the\r\n\"Free-state\" movement.]\r\n\r\nThese bold utterances startled the North and the South, the people of\r\nKansas and, especially, the people of Missouri. This speech, together\r\nwith the letter of M. F. Conway to Governor Reeder, resigning his seat\r\nin the legislature and repudiating that body \"as derogatory to the\r\nrespectability of popular government and insulting to the virtue and\r\nintelligence of the age,\" set the \"Free-state\" scheme in motion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The enactments of the Territorial legislature.]\r\n\r\nThe enactments of the Territorial legislature greatly aided the\r\nmovement by demonstrating to the people what they had to expect from\r\nthe dominance of that body. They made the decoying, or aiding therein,\r\nof a slave away from his master in the Territory grand larceny,\r\npunishable by death. They made the decoying into Kansas of any slave\r\naway from his master in any other place, for the purpose of effecting\r\nhis freedom, grand larceny, punishable by death. And they made the\r\ndenial of the right to hold slaves in Kansas, either by word of mouth\r\nor in writing or printing, a felony, punishable by imprisonment at\r\nhard labor for not less than two years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The North aroused by this legislation.]\r\n\r\nWhen the knowledge of this infamous legislation spread throughout the\r\nNorth, it roused that section of the country to new efforts for\r\npeopling Kansas with anti-slavery men, who would rescue the Territory\r\nfrom the reign of such laws and such law-makers. The necessary\r\nreinforcements {425} were being assembled in the North when the\r\ncreation of the \"Free-state\" government was begun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Topeka constitution.]\r\n\r\nA series of conventions, beginning with the convention at Lawrence on\r\nAugust 14th, and culminating with that assembled at Topeka on the 23rd\r\nday of October, 1855, consolidated the anti-slavery men in the\r\nTerritory into the \"Free-state\" party, constructed a temporary\r\nelection machinery, and produced, finally, a proposed Commonwealth\r\nconstitution, which, in addition to the provisions for the structure\r\nof a Commonwealth government for Kansas, contained a clause\r\nprohibiting slavery in Kansas after July 4th, 1857, and excluding\r\nnegroes from residence in Kansas after that date.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The removal of Governor Reeder; and his election as\r\nCongressional delegate.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Governor Reeder had been removed by the President from\r\nthe governorship of the Territory, and the Secretary of the Territory,\r\none Daniel Woodson, a pro-slavery man, had become acting Governor for\r\nthe time being. Ex-Governor Reeder now went over to the anti-slavery\r\nmen, and was chosen by them on October 9th, at the same election at\r\nwhich the delegates to the Topeka convention were chosen, as delegate\r\nto Congress. Over twenty-seven hundred votes were cast at this\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ratification of the Topeka constitution; and the\r\nestablishment of the \"Free-state\" government.]\r\n\r\nOn December 15th, the Topeka constitution was submitted to the\r\nsuffrages of the people. Seventeen hundred and thirty-one votes were\r\ncast in favor of its adoption, and forty-six votes against it. The\r\npro-slavery men took no part in the voting. It is probable, however,\r\nthat a majority of the legal voters in Kansas ratified this\r\nconstitution. On January 5th, 1856, the elections for the legislative\r\nmembers and officials of the government provided by this constitution\r\nwere held, and Dr. Robinson was chosen Governor.\r\n\r\n{426} [Sidenote: The first violence.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this election that the conflict of arms between the\r\n\"Free-state\" government and the Territorial government began. A\r\nTerritorial military company, called the Kickapoo Rangers, threatened\r\nto interfere with the elections at the town of Easton. A captain, R.\r\nP. Brown, organized a company of \"Free-state\" men at Leavenworth, and\r\nwent to Easton to protect the ballot box. As the evening drew on a\r\nfight ensued, in which a Territorial man was killed. The next day the\r\nLeavenworth company was attacked, on their return, by the Kickapoo\r\ncompany, and Captain Brown was taken prisoner. Some movements were in\r\nprogress for trying him, when one of the ruffians put an end to the\r\nmatter by striking him on the head with a hatchet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Free-state\" government and the Administration.]\r\n\r\nTwo local governments of Kansas were now in existence. One, the\r\nTerritorial, had been recognized as legitimate by the Washington\r\nGovernment. What, then, was the other? Was it a body of\r\ninsurrectionists? If so, must the general Government suppress it? And,\r\nif the general Government must suppress it, must it do so at once, or\r\nshould it wait until the insurrectionists should undertake to exercise\r\nsome governmental power? These were knotty problems for the\r\nAdministration at Washington, but they were problems which had to be\r\nsolved. From the inaction of the Washington authorities we must\r\nconclude that the prevailing view with them was that the new\r\ngovernment in Kansas must do something before it could be dealt with.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The acts of the \"Free-state\" legislature.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Free-state\" legislature met March 4th, 1856. It prepared a\r\nmemorial to Congress, praying for the entrance of Kansas as a\r\nCommonwealth into the Union, under the Topeka constitution. It elected\r\nReeder and Lane United States Senators. It appointed a committee to\r\nput the {427} legislative business into shape for the next session.\r\nAnd it passed a few laws.\r\n\r\nNone of these acts were treasonable. Treason, by the Constitution, is\r\nlevying war against the United States or any of the \"States,\" or\r\nadhering to those who are doing so, giving them aid and comfort; and\r\nlevying war has been defined by the Supreme Court to be the actual\r\nassembly of armed men for the treasonable purpose. Not even the\r\nvoluntary submission to the laws passed by the \"Free-state\"\r\nlegislature was treason or rebellion. The danger point would be\r\nreached when the \"Free-state\" government should undertake to enforce\r\nits laws, or should interpose armed resistance to the enforcement of\r\nthe laws of the United States, or of the acts of the Territorial\r\ngovernment, which government had been recognized as legitimate by the\r\ngeneral Government, which was, in fact, but the local agent of the\r\ngeneral Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Governor Robinson's message.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Robinson understood the situation. In his message to the\r\nlegislature he recommended \"no course to be taken in opposition to the\r\ngeneral Government, or to the Territorial government, while it shall\r\nremain with the sanction of Congress.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new Governor, Shannon, and the \"law and order\" party.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these movements by the \"Free-state\" men, the\r\npro-slavery men organized themselves more closely for aggressive\r\naction. The new Governor appointed by the President, Wilson Shannon,\r\nex-Governor of Ohio, a man of intelligence and high character, arrived\r\nat Shawnee Mission on September 3rd, 1855. The pro-slavery men did not\r\nlike his appointment. They wanted the acting Governor, Woodson, to be\r\nmade Governor. However, they received the new Governor with much pomp\r\nand ceremony, and succeeded in imposing upon him, at the outset, their\r\nview of the situation. On {428} November 14th, they held a pro-slavery\r\nconvention at Leavenworth. They called it an assembly of \"the lovers\r\nof law and order.\" The Governor presided over it, and made a rather\r\nviolent speech, in which he declared that the Territorial government\r\nhad the support of the Administration at Washington. The practical\r\nwork of this convention was the organization of the \"law and order\"\r\nparty; that is, the party for enforcing the acts and authority of the\r\nTerritorial government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attempt to enforce the Territorial laws upon the\r\n\"Free-state\" men.]\r\n\r\nNaturally a dispute about a land claim furnished the occasion for\r\ntrying the powers of the Territorial government. In the course of this\r\nquarrel, which took place in the latter part of November, 1855, a\r\npro-slavery man, named Coleman, killed a \"Free-state\" man, named Dow.\r\nThe friends of Dow gathered about the spot where his dead body was\r\nfound, and indulged in threats of vengeance. Among them was one Jacob\r\nBranson, who uttered threats against one Buckley, as the instigator of\r\nthe murder of his friend. Buckley secured a peace warrant against\r\nBranson, and put it in the hands of one S. J. Jones, the sheriff,\r\nunder the Territorial government, of Douglas County. The arrest of\r\nBranson under this warrant inaugurated the contest for imposing the\r\nauthority of the Territorial government upon the \"Free-state\" men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Branson rescue.]\r\n\r\nSheriff Jones arrested Branson, and started for Lecompton with him, by\r\nway of Lawrence. His purpose in going through the head-quarters of the\r\n\"Free-state\" men was undoubtedly to tempt them to the rescue of\r\nBranson. But Branson was rescued several miles away from Lawrence by a\r\ncompany of \"Free-state\" men, under the lead of a Captain Abbott. This\r\nparty, however, immediately repaired to Lawrence, while the sheriff\r\nwent to Franklin, and from {429} this place summoned his Missouri\r\nfriends to his aid, and then reported his trouble to the Governor, and\r\nasked for his support.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The advance of the Missourians on Lawrence.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor immediately ordered the officers of the Territorial\r\nmilitia to collect the forces, and march to Lawrence. Although the\r\nsheriff asked for three thousand men, not one hundred residents of the\r\nTerritory answered the call of the militia officers; but a great horde\r\ncame from Missouri. By December 5th, 1855, more than a thousand\r\nMissourians had arrived, and had encamped upon the Wakarusa, a few\r\nmiles to the east of Lawrence. General Atchison was with them.\r\n\r\nNaturally the people of Lawrence were much excited, and set about\r\npreparing for defence. They constructed several small forts, and\r\norganized a military force of some six or seven hundred men, pretty\r\nwell armed and equipped. They stood a very good chance to win in the\r\ntrial of battle, but they resolved, most wisely, to rely upon the\r\njustice of their cause more than upon the power of their arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lawrence's demand of protection from Governor Shannon.]\r\n\r\nThe committee of safety, which was directing matters in Lawrence, sent\r\ncommissioners to Governor Shannon to enlighten him, from the point of\r\nview of the \"Free-state\" men, in regard to the situation. They made\r\ntheir way to Shawnee Mission, where they were coldly received by the\r\nGovernor, who charged the \"Free-state\" men with rebellion against his\r\ngovernment. The commissioners disputed his charge, told him that\r\nnobody in Lawrence had had anything to do with the rescue of Branson,\r\nthat his rescuers had been warned out of the town as soon as they came\r\ninto it, and had obeyed the warning, and gave him the committee's\r\nmessage demanding his protection against the invaders.\r\n\r\n{430} [Sidenote: Shannon at Lawrence, and his agreement with the\r\n\"Free-state\" men.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor was somewhat staggered by these statements, and decided\r\nto go to Lawrence himself, and examine affairs on the spot. This was\r\njust what the \"Free-state\" men wanted. He arrived in Lawrence on\r\nDecember 7th. Dr. Robinson and Colonel Lane immediately stated the\r\nsituation and the views of the \"Free-state\" men to him. The Governor\r\nsaw, at once, that they were in the right, and could not be attacked.\r\nHe recognized, at once, that his task was to send the Missourians out\r\nof the Territory. He entered into a sort of written agreement with the\r\ncitizens of Lawrence, in which the people of Lawrence pledged\r\nthemselves not to resist the legal service of any criminal process,\r\nbut to aid in the execution of the laws, when called on by proper\r\nauthority, and the Governor declared that he had no authority to call\r\nupon non-residents of Kansas to aid him in the execution of the laws,\r\nhad not done so, and would not do so. The last clause provided that\r\nnothing in the agreement should be taken as a recognition of the\r\nvalidity of the acts of the Territorial legislature by the\r\n\"Free-state\" men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The retreat of the Missourians.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor felt that he would have difficulty in reconciling the\r\nMissourians to his agreement, and insisted that Dr. Robinson and\r\nColonel Lane should accompany him to Franklin, and aid him in his\r\ntask. The calm statements of the Governor and of Dr. Robinson\r\nprevailed, and the Missourians saw the error into which they had been\r\nbetrayed by the inconsiderate pro-slavery zeal of Sheriff Jones.\r\nGeneral Atchison told his followers plainly that Dr. Robinson's\r\nposition was impregnable, and that if they should persist in an attack\r\nupon Lawrence, contrary to the Governor's orders, they were only a\r\nmob. He added, that such a movement was not only without show of\r\nlegality, but would ruin the Democratic {431} party, and cause the\r\nelection of an Abolitionist President the next year. By these efforts\r\nand representations on the part of the Governor, Dr. Robinson, and\r\nGeneral Atchison, the Missourians were induced to break camp and turn\r\ntheir faces homeward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Brown.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment of this victory of the \"Free-state\" men, won by moral\r\nforces and diplomatic address, appeared the Loki of Kansas\r\n\"Free-state\" history, John Brown. He mounted a box in one of the\r\nstreets of Lawrence, railed and ranted against the settlement which\r\nhad been reached, and breathed out words of slaughter and pillage,\r\nuntil some man of common sense pulled him down, and stopped his\r\nmurderous canting babble.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shannon's report to the President.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor reported the affair to the President, expressed to him\r\nhis forebodings as to the future, and suggested that he be allowed to\r\ncall upon the United States troops stationed at Fort Leavenworth at\r\nhis discretion, as a call for the militia would only end in a party\r\nstruggle. This communication seems to have opened the eyes of the\r\nPresident, for the first time, to the true situation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The appeal of the \"Free-state\" men to the President.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Free-state\" men now addressed the President and demanded his\r\nprotection against another invasion from Missouri, which they claimed\r\nwas in preparation. On January 23rd, 1856, the leaders at Lawrence\r\ntelegraphed the President that the outrage was on the point of\r\nconsummation, and besought the President to issue his proclamation, at\r\nonce, forbidding the invasion. At the same time, they informed certain\r\nmembers of Congress and the Governors of certain Northern\r\nCommonwealths of the impending danger; and they sent commissioners\r\ninto the Northern Commonwealths to inform the people of the {432}\r\nNorth in regard to the situation in Kansas, and to appeal to them to\r\nemigrate thither in sufficient numbers to save the Territory against\r\nthe pro-slavery movement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's proclamation.]\r\n\r\nThe agitation became now so general throughout the country, that the\r\nPresident felt constrained to interfere. On February 11th, he issued\r\nhis proclamation, in which he warned all persons concerned that \"an\r\nattempted insurrection\" in the Territory of Kansas or \"an aggressive\r\nintrusion into the same\" would be resisted by the employment of the\r\nUnited States troops in Kansas, as well as the local militia; and\r\ncalled upon all good citizens outside of Kansas to abstain from\r\nintermeddling with the local affairs of the Territory, and upon all\r\ngood citizens in Kansas to render obedience to the laws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The situation made more embarrassing for the \"Free-state\"\r\nmen.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Free-state\" men did not regard the proclamation as particularly\r\nfriendly to them. While it forbade invasion, it commanded obedience to\r\nthe existing Territorial government within. They were afraid that they\r\nwould not be allowed to organize their \"Free-state\" government,\r\ncreated by the Topeka constitution. But, as we have seen, the day came\r\nand went for this, without any interference on the part of the\r\nPresident or the Governor against the movement, although the President\r\nhad authorized the Governor to call upon the United States troops at\r\nFort Leavenworth at his discretion. Under these circumstances it was\r\ncertainly the part of wisdom for the \"Free-state\" men to do nothing\r\nsuperfluous or sensational in the organization of the new government,\r\nand to delay operations under it for the time being. The question of\r\nthe recognition of the \"Free-state\" movement was before Congress,\r\nunder the issue of the contest between Whitfield and Reeder for the\r\nseat in the House of Representatives. The policy, therefore, {433} of\r\nrepresenting the organization of the new government as tentative, and\r\nas conditioned upon the presumption of Congressional recognition, and\r\nas holding its powers in abeyance until that recognition should be\r\nsecured, was wise and necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Congressional committee to the Territory.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion of Kansas affairs in the House of Representatives\r\nrevolved about the question of the admission of Whitfield or Reeder\r\nfrom the middle of February to March 19th, 1856, when it was voted to\r\nsend a special committee of investigation to the Territory. The\r\ngentlemen selected were Mr. Howard, of Michigan, Mr. Sherman, of Ohio,\r\nand Mr. Oliver, of Missouri. They proceeded to the Territory and\r\nopened their investigations about the middle of April.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Application for admission.]\r\n\r\nA week before this, the memorial from the \"Free-state\" legislature\r\npraying for the admission of Kansas, as a Commonwealth, under the\r\nTopeka constitution, was presented in both Houses of Congress, and\r\nplaced upon the calendar in each. The slavery question was herewith\r\nagain before Congress in both principle and detail. The measure which\r\nwas intended to put its discussion out of the halls of Congress had\r\nthus, in less than two years, proved itself an utter fiasco.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sheriff Jones again at Lawrence; and the attempts to\r\nassassinate him.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The outrage repudiated by the \"Free-state\" men.]\r\n\r\nIn the Territory the pro-slavery men pursued their policy of bringing\r\nthe \"Free-state\" men into conflict with the general Government. The\r\n\"Free-state\" men sought just as diligently to avoid it. Both sides\r\nrecognized this as the crucial test. By the middle of April, some of\r\nthe men who participated in the rescue of Branson had made their way\r\nback to Lawrence, and Sheriff Jones laid his plans for arresting them.\r\nOn April 19th, he rode into Lawrence and served a writ upon S. N.\r\nWood, but the crowd jostled them apart, and Wood escaped. The {434}\r\nSheriff returned on the next day with more writs, and undertook to\r\narrest S. F. Tappan. Tappan resisted and struck the Sheriff. Jones\r\nwent at once to the Governor, and the Governor gave him a detachment\r\nof United States soldiers. With these he returned to Lawrence, but\r\nthey could find no one for whom the Sheriff had a writ. The party\r\npitched tent at Lawrence to spend the night. After darkness came on,\r\nsome wretch, then unknown to the \"Free-state\" leaders, approached the\r\ntent and shot the Sheriff, wounding him dangerously. This was an\r\nalmost irreparable blow to the \"Free-state\" cause. The very thing\r\nwhich the \"Free-state\" leaders had sought most earnestly to avoid had\r\nbeen thrust upon them by the criminal deed of some meddlesome crank.\r\nThe \"Free-state\" men recognized at once the seriousness of the\r\nsituation, and, on the morning following the event, held a meeting, at\r\nwhich the outrage was repudiated and denounced, and a reward of five\r\nhundred dollars offered for the apprehension of the criminal. Colonel\r\nSumner, the commander of the United States troops in Kansas, wrote to\r\nDr. Robinson, urging him to use every effort to move the citizens of\r\nLawrence to bring the assassin to justice, as his act would be charged\r\nby the pro-slavery men upon the whole community. The Doctor replied at\r\nonce that the community repudiated the foul deed, and would certainly\r\nbring the guilty party to justice if he could be found. There was no\r\nmunicipal government in Lawrence at the time, and Dr. Robinson acted,\r\nin his reply to Colonel Sumner, as a sort of self-constituted\r\nrepresentative of the citizens. He certainly represented the views of\r\nthe large majority of them, but there were some who, at the time, knew\r\nwho the guilty person was, and gave no sign which would aid in his\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n{435} [Sidenote: Judge Lecompte's charge to the Grand Jury.]\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff's wound was not fatal, but it was reported that he was\r\ndead, and the Missourians began to organize for another invasion.\r\nBefore they were ready, the Territorial judiciary came to their\r\nassistance. Chief Justice Lecompte charged the Grand Jury of Douglas\r\nCounty, in the early part of May, that resistance to the Territorial\r\nlaws was high treason against the United States, and that entering\r\ninto combinations for the purpose of making such resistance was\r\nconstructive treason, and instructed the body to find true bills\r\nagainst all persons guilty of such offences. This was a most\r\nastounding piece of jurisprudence. It looked like nothing but a trick\r\nto deprive the \"Free-state\" men of their leaders, since one arrested\r\nfor treason was considered as not having the privilege of bail.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"treason indictments.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jury found indictments against nine or ten persons, among\r\nthem Robinson, Reeder, and Lane, and also against two newspapers\r\npublished in Lawrence, and the Emigrant Aid Company's hotel there. The\r\nindictments were put in the hands of the United States Marshal for the\r\nTerritory, J. B. Donaldson. On May 11th, Donaldson issued a\r\nproclamation, declaring that the service of these writs by his deputy\r\nhad been resisted in Lawrence, and calling \"the law-abiding citizens\r\nof the Territory to appear at Lecompton, as soon as possible, and in\r\nnumbers sufficient for the proper execution of the law.\" As a matter\r\nof fact, only Reeder had resisted service, and had succeeded in\r\nescaping. All the others, except Lane and Wood, were taken into\r\ncustody without difficulty. Reeder's justification was that he was at\r\nthe moment in attendance, as a witness, upon the Congressional\r\ncommittee sent to the Territory, and was, therefore, legally exempt\r\nfrom arrest at the time.\r\n\r\n{436} [Sidenote: The Marshal's proclamation in Lawrence.]\r\n\r\nThe Marshal did not publish his proclamation in Lawrence, but a copy\r\nof it fell into the hands of a Lawrence citizen, who hastened to make\r\nknown to the people the peril which was impending. The citizens\r\nalready knew of forces being organized, both in the Territory and in\r\nMissouri, against Lawrence, and had demanded the Governor's protection\r\nagainst them. The Governor had replied that he knew of no force near\r\nor approaching Lawrence, except the posse under the orders of the\r\nUnited States Marshal and the Sheriff of Douglas County, who had writs\r\nto serve in Lawrence, and that he should not interfere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The action of the citizens of Lawrence.]\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Lawrence now held a meeting and passed formal\r\nresolutions, declaring that the charges contained in the Marshal's\r\nproclamation were untrue, and that the citizens were not only ready to\r\nacquiesce in the service of any judicial writs against them by the\r\nUnited States Marshal, but to furnish him a posse, if required, to aid\r\nhim in the discharge of his duty. And after receiving the Governor's\r\nreply, they appealed to the Marshal, asking him to state his demands,\r\npromising not to resist the service of his processes, but to aid him\r\nin the discharge of his legal duties, and praying his protection\r\nagainst the lawless bands collecting about their town for the purpose\r\nof its destruction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Marshal's reply.]\r\n\r\nThe Marshal replied in a flippant and sarcastic manner, saying that\r\nhis correspondents must be strangers in Lawrence if they were ignorant\r\nof the demands against the citizens of the town, referring in\r\nexaggerated language to the shooting of Jones, and Reeder's resistance\r\nto his deputy, and to the military organization and equipment of the\r\npeople of Lawrence, and declaring that he should execute all processes\r\nin his hands in his own time and way.\r\n\r\n{437} [Sidenote: Appeal of the citizens to the Marshal and the\r\nGovernor.]\r\n\r\nThree days later, on May 17th, the citizens communicated again with\r\nthe Marshal, calling his attention to the depredations committed by\r\nthe bands around Lawrence, asking if he was responsible for these\r\nbodies, and demanding protection from him against them. At the same\r\ntime, the managers of the hotel appealed to the Governor to protect\r\ntheir property, and carried with them an offer from the citizens to\r\ngive up their arms to Colonel Sumner, if he would station a detachment\r\nof United States soldiers in the town for their protection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hotel and the printing offices.]\r\n\r\nThe Marshal and the Governor thought favorably of this proposition.\r\nThey were willing to guarantee the safety of the citizens and their\r\nindividual property, but they thought they must consult with the\r\ncaptains of the squads composing the posse before they could give such\r\nassurances in regard to the hotel and the printing offices. These\r\npersons were found to be determined on the destruction of the printing\r\noffices, certainly, and of the hotel, probably. Colonel Titus, of\r\nFlorida, declared that the South Carolina boys in the posse would be\r\nsatisfied with nothing short of the destruction of the printing\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nThe hotel managers and the representatives of the citizens turned\r\nagain to the Governor and implored him to send the United States\r\nsoldiers for the protection of the town, but he again refused to\r\ninterfere; and, finally, when they said to him that they feared the\r\ncitizens would be compelled to defend themselves by armed power, and\r\nprecipitate the horrors of civil war, he answered angrily, while\r\nstriding out of their presence: \"War then it is, by God!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sacking of Lawrence.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 21st, the Marshal's armed force appeared upon\r\none of the heights overlooking the town, displaying first a white\r\nflag, then a red one, and, lastly, {438} the flag of the United\r\nStates. The Deputy-marshal then entered the town with a small posse,\r\nand called the managers of the hotel and several of the citizens to\r\njoin his posse and assist him in the service of his writs. They\r\nobeyed, and two persons were arrested. The Deputy, with his force and\r\nhis prisoners, returned to the camp. Colonel C. W. Topliff, a\r\nprominent citizen, went with them, bearing a communication from the\r\ncommittee of safety of Lawrence to the Marshal, in which the promise\r\nof obedience to his processes was again made, and his protection\r\nclaimed.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the crisis was now passed. The Marshal dismissed his\r\nposse. But the Sheriff immediately reorganized the bands as _his_\r\nposse. This was most ominous of evil. The Sheriff was burning with\r\npassion for personal revenge. In the middle of the afternoon (May\r\n21st), he rode into the town at the head of his army, and, in spite of\r\nevery plea and remonstrance, caused the contents of the printing\r\noffices to be scattered through the streets and the hotel to be\r\nburned, and allowed the pillage, and even the burning, of private\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repudiation of the deed by Atchison and others.]\r\n\r\nThe atrocious and disgraceful deed of sacking Lawrence was denounced\r\nby many of the persons who had joined the Marshal's posse. General\r\nAtchison tried to prevent the Sheriff from thus wreaking his\r\nvengeance, and denounced his deed afterward. Jackson, the leader of\r\nthe Georgians, and Buford, the captain of the Alabama squad, also\r\ndenounced the vile procedure, and declared that they had not come to\r\nKansas to destroy property.\r\n\r\nAtchison knew well enough that a great blow had been given to the\r\nprospects of the Democratic party in the now approaching presidential\r\nelection. What, then, must have been his despair upon learning that an\r\nattack, {439} even more outrageous than the sacking of Lawrence, had\r\nbeen made, at the same time, upon the defender of \"Free-state\" Kansas\r\nin the Senate chamber at Washington?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attack on Senator Sumner.]\r\n\r\nThe debate on the bills for the admission of \"Free-state\" Kansas had\r\nprogressed from day to day, in both Houses of Congress, with\r\nincreasing earnestness and excitement. At length, on May 19th and\r\n20th, Mr. Sumner delivered his fierce philippic on the \"Crime against\r\nKansas.\" It was not only an unvarnished statement of the case from the\r\nAbolitionist point of view, but it was a personal arraignment of\r\nseveral of the Senators. The attack contained in it upon Senator\r\nButler, of South Carolina, a gentleman of great refinement and\r\npoliteness, and much honored and esteemed by his associates, was\r\nespecially coarse and brutal. Almost all the Senators felt the attack\r\nto be more than a discourtesy. Senator Butler was in ill health and\r\nwas absent from his seat, both of which circumstances made the affair\r\nall the more exasperating. For two days the Capital rang with\r\ndenunciations of the insulting speech, when Preston S. Brooks, a\r\nnephew of Senator Butler, and a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, demanded and took satisfaction of Mr. Sumner for the\r\nattack upon his kinsman. Had he carried out his purpose in a brave and\r\nmanly way, he would have been generally applauded for it, but being no\r\nmatch physically for Sumner, Brooks had recourse to a method which\r\nstamped him as a coward, and his attack upon Sumner as a brutal\r\noutrage. He entered the Senate chamber on May 22nd, after the\r\nadjournment of the body, and approaching Mr. Sumner, who was seated\r\nand bending over his desk, charged him with libel on South Carolina\r\nand her sons, and struck him with a cane upon the head {440} until the\r\nSenator became helpless and unconscious. With this, Sumner's outrage\r\nupon Butler was entirely lost sight of in Brooks's far more brutal\r\noutrage upon Sumner.\r\n\r\nThe cowardly deed was looked upon everywhere in the North as the fit\r\ncompanion-piece to the sacking of Lawrence. The indignation of the\r\nNorth was roused to the highest pitch, and it seemed as if the\r\nelections of 1856 must bring the anti-slavery party into the seats of\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pottawattomie massacres.]\r\n\r\nBut just at this most critical juncture, when everything depended on\r\ncalmness and moderation on the part of the \"Free-state\" men to secure\r\nimmediate victory, and when immediate victory, thus pursued, was, so\r\nfar as human eye can discern, within their grasp, an outrage was\r\nperpetrated by a gang of men, or rather fiends, who claimed some sort\r\nof relation to the \"Free-state\" party, which so far overshadowed in\r\ncruel atrocity all that had gone before as to produce a revulsion of\r\nfeeling most damaging to the \"Free-state\" cause. On May 23rd, John\r\nBrown, with six or seven others, all, except two, members of his own\r\nfamily, went to the settlement about Dutch Henry's Crossing on the\r\nPottawattomie Creek, and, on the night of the 24th, took five men,\r\ninnocent of anything which could even justify arrest by proper\r\nauthorities, from their cabins, and murdered them, cutting and\r\nslashing their bodies with cutlasses, until their savage thirst for\r\nblood was partially satiated. So barbarously atrocious was the deed,\r\nso calculated to rouse the sentiment of the whole country against the\r\n\"Free-state\" cause in Kansas, that the Republican members of the\r\nCongressional committee of investigation in the Territory refused to\r\nmake the event a part of their inquiry. The Democratic member, Mr.\r\nOliver, investigated it, and reported it to Congress and to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n{441} No sane mind can find the slightest justification, excuse, or\r\npalliation for this atrocious crime. It was murder, pure and simple.\r\nAnd when we consider the purpose for which, as well as the mind with\r\nwhich, it was committed, it became, in addition to common crime, also\r\npublic crime of the most grievous nature. Dr. Robinson says it was\r\ndone for the purpose of involving the North and the South in war\r\nagainst each other. Thus to the murderous mind was added the seditious\r\npurpose. Some men have professed to find virtue in this noxious\r\ncompound, but such minds have lost their moorings, and are roaming\r\nwithout star or compass over the border lands between reason and\r\ninsanity. To murder, Brown and his vile brood added robbery; but this\r\nwas so slight a crime in comparison with the other that it may be\r\npassed without further notice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The excitement produced by them.]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the region were thrown into the greatest\r\nconsternation and excitement. The pro-slavery and the anti-slavery men\r\nassembled together, denounced the horrible deed as foulest murder, and\r\nresolved to act together as men of reason and common sense for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and order and the suppression of crime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle at Black Jack.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Governor's proclamation, enforced by United States\r\nsoldiers.]\r\n\r\nFor a few days it was not known who the authors of these murders were,\r\nbut suspicion soon pointed to Brown and his gang, and steps were taken\r\nto procure warrants for their arrest. The Governor, also, sent down a\r\nbody of troops to the scene of the massacre. The troops were\r\nvolunteers, chiefly Missourians, commanded by a Captain Pate. Pate's\r\nforce met Brown's at Black Jack, and Brown captured Pate and his men.\r\nThis was June 2nd. With nothing to hinder him for the moment, Brown\r\nnow robbed and pillaged all around. By the 3rd, however, the\r\nMissourians, led by Whitfield, were rallying to the aid of their\r\npro-slavery friends in {442} Kansas, and by the 5th, battle was\r\nimpending between the Missourians and the \"Free-state\" men, who had\r\ngathered in the neighborhood of the excitement. The Governor had at\r\nlast comprehended the serious character of the situation. He issued\r\nhis proclamation warning invaders to retire, and commanding armed and\r\nillegal organizations to disperse. And he sent Colonel Sumner with a\r\ncompany of regular cavalry to the scene of action.\r\n\r\nSumner rescued Pate and his men, dispersed Brown's gang, and ordered\r\nthe Missourians to get out of Kansas. He did not arrest Brown, because\r\nhe had no warrant for his apprehension, and did not know, at the time,\r\nthat he was the author of the Pottawattomie murders. Sumner remained a\r\nfortnight or more in southern Kansas until the excitement was somewhat\r\nspent, and then returned to Fort Leavenworth. Brown disappeared, and a\r\nmeasure of peace was momentarily restored.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Free-state\" cause greatly injured by Brown's deeds.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the bill for the admission of Kansas by the\r\nHouse.]\r\n\r\nThe Pottawattomie murders, and the robberies succeeding them, had,\r\nhowever, greatly damaged the \"Free-state\" cause. The great advantage\r\nwhich had accrued to it through the sacking of Lawrence and the\r\noutrage upon Senator Sumner was now largely lost again. Still,\r\nemigration from the Northern Commonwealths to Kansas continued in\r\ngreat activity, and the House of Representatives at Washington was\r\nsteadily advancing toward the passage of the resolution for the\r\nadmission of \"Free-state\" Kansas into the Union, although the flight\r\nof its committee of investigation from the Territory, in consequence\r\nof the excitement following the murders on the Pottawattomie, and the\r\ntwo reports which its members made of the situation in Kansas,\r\nexercised an unfavorable influence on the movement. The House passed\r\nthe bill, {443} however, on July 3rd, by a majority of two votes, but\r\nit would admit neither of the claimants to a seat in the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dispersal of the \"Free-state\" legislature by Colonel\r\nSumner.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Colonel Sumner, while personally in sympathy with\r\nthe \"Free-state\" cause, felt it to be his official duty to disperse\r\nthe \"Free-state\" legislature which assembled at Topeka on July 4th.\r\nThe President and the Secretary of War, Mr. Jefferson Davis,\r\nsubsequently disapproved of this act, and denied that the authority\r\nfor it was either expressed or implied in any of their instructions to\r\nColonel Sumner. The Colonel thought the contrary, and felt that the\r\nunpopularity of the procedure throughout the North had caused the\r\nPresident and the Secretary to disavow a responsibility for it which\r\nwas rightfully their own. A careful reading of the dispatches leads to\r\nthe conclusion that the Colonel did exceed his powers. He was,\r\ndoubtless, led to do so unconsciously by the violent deeds of men\r\nprofessing connection with the \"Free-state\" party. The\r\nmisunderstanding led finally to the retirement of Colonel Sumner from\r\nthe command of the United States forces in Kansas, and the assignment\r\nof General P. F. Smith to that duty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Free-state\" Directory.]\r\n\r\nAfter the dispersion of the \"Free-state\" legislature, the \"Free-state\"\r\nmen, who were gathered in Lawrence, held a convention, and elected a\r\ncommittee, whose duty it should be to look after the interests of the\r\npeople. This committee selected from among its members a sub-committee\r\nof five, and transferred all of its powers and duties to this\r\nsub-committee. The \"Free-state\" government had now become a\r\ndirectorial board of five persons, chief among whom were William\r\nHutchinson and James Blood. The seat of this Directory was Lawrence.\r\n\r\n{444} [Sidenote: The organization of the \"Free-state\" military.]\r\n\r\nThe Directory organized a strong military force under the command of\r\nColonel Walker. This force attacked and broke up three pro-slavery\r\nbands during the month of August, the last one at Fort Titus, near\r\nLecompton, and commanded by the noted Colonel Titus himself. Titus and\r\nhis men were captured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of August 17th.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resignation of Shannon.]\r\n\r\nThe Governor now became alarmed for his own safety. Accompanied by\r\nMajor Sedgwick, he went to Lawrence, on August 17th, and concluded\r\nwith the Directory the noted agreement of that date, the terms of\r\nwhich were, that the \"Free-state\" men should keep the arms which they\r\nhad captured from the pro-slavery bands; that the howitzer taken from\r\nLawrence should be returned to the town; that all persons arrested by\r\nthe United States Marshal, under charge of participating in the attack\r\nupon the pro-slavery band at Franklin, should be delivered unharmed to\r\nthe Directory; that the Governor should disband the Territorial\r\nmilitia, order all bands of armed men to disperse, and command all\r\narmed bands of nonresidents to leave the Territory. The Directory\r\nengaged, upon its side, to release Titus and his men. The Governor\r\nvirtually surrendered to the Directory. He then returned to Lecompton,\r\nresigned his office, and made his way back to Ohio.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Woodson's proclamation, and the new invasion from\r\nMissouri.]\r\n\r\nSecretary Woodson was now again in the Governor's chair, and this, of\r\nitself, was notice to the Missourians to come on. They had already\r\ngathered on the border. On August 25th, Woodson published a\r\nproclamation, in which he declared the Territory to be \"in a state of\r\nopen insurrection and rebellion,\" called \"upon all law-abiding\r\ncitizens of the Territory to rally to the support of their country and\r\nits laws,\" and commanded \"all officers, {445} civil and military, and\r\nall other citizens of the Territory, to aid and assist by all means in\r\ntheir power in putting down the insurrectionists.\"\r\n\r\nThe Missourians took this as an invitation to advance. They entered\r\nthe Territory again, on the 29th, and pitched their camp on Bull\r\nCreek. Atchison was in command. On the 13th, a detachment of them\r\nattacked and destroyed Ossawattomie. About a dozen men were killed in\r\nthe fight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Smith's attitude toward invaders.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith now issued instructions that the United States troops\r\nshould not \"interfere with persons who may have come from a distance\r\nto give protection to their friends or others, and who may be behaving\r\nthemselves in a peaceable and lawful manner.\" This attitude seemed at\r\nfirst view to be friendly to the pro-slavery men; but the friends of\r\nthe \"Free-state\" men were now pouring into the Territory by way of\r\nIowa and Nebraska, and Smith's order worked ultimately to their\r\nadvantage. Unquestionably the General intended to be impartial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marching and counter-marching.]\r\n\r\nThe attack on Ossawattomie roused the \"Free-state\" men to new\r\nexertions. Three hundred of them, commanded by Lane, advanced upon the\r\ncamp at Bull Creek. The two forces drew up in battle array, but, after\r\na slight skirmish, they both drew off.\r\n\r\nActing Governor Woodson now ordered Colonel Cooke to attack Topeka\r\nwith United States troops, but the Colonel refused to obey the order,\r\nand General Smith sustained him.\r\n\r\nThe \"Free-state\" men now planned an attack upon Lecompton. They moved\r\nin two separate columns, one commanded by Harvey and the other by\r\nLane. The attack was to be made on September 4th, but the failure of\r\nLane's column to arrive until the 5th enabled the {446} United States\r\nsoldiers to reach the town first. When the \"Free-state\" men learned\r\nthat the regulars were in the town, they returned to Lawrence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The failure of \"Popular Sovereignty\" in the Territories.]\r\n\r\nThe Missourians were now roused to serious and decided action. An army\r\nof some three thousand of them had gathered on the border, and was on\r\nthe point of marching in for the purpose of destroying every\r\n\"Free-state\" settlement in the Territory. Only one thing could now\r\nsave the Territory from thoroughgoing and relentless civil war, and\r\nthat was the interference of the United States army. The fiasco of\r\n\"popular sovereignty\" in the Territories was at last complete. The\r\ngeneral Government must assume control.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Release of the \"treason prisoners,\" and appointment of\r\nGeary.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new Governor establishes peace by means of the army of\r\nthe United States.]\r\n\r\nThe President's eyes had at last been opened to the fact, that if he\r\nallowed things to drift any farther in Kansas, the Republicans would\r\nwin the presidential election in November. He, therefore, resolved to\r\nput the government of the Territory into impartial hands. He ordered\r\nthe United States Marshal to release Robinson and his colleagues;\r\nappointed J. W. Geary, of Pennsylvania, a man of strong character,\r\nGovernor of the Territory; and authorized Geary to call the United\r\nStates troops to his assistance. Geary arrived at Lecompton on\r\nSeptember 10th. On the 12th, he went to Lawrence, and, after promising\r\nthe \"Free-state\" men protection against the Missourians, returned to\r\nLecompton. On the 14th, the force advancing on Lawrence arrived in the\r\nneighborhood of the town. Word was immediately sent to the Governor.\r\nThe Governor summoned a detachment of United States soldiers, and set\r\nout for the scene of action. On the morning of the 15th, he met the\r\narmy of Missourians and interposed the United States army between\r\n{447} them and Lawrence. The Governor informed the Missouri leaders\r\nthat they must leave the Territory. They dared not put themselves in\r\nan attitude of hostility to the military power of the Union, and\r\nquickly retreated back to Missouri. With this the warfare inaugurated\r\nby the murders on the Pottawattomie ended. The Governor had at last\r\nbrought peace to the distracted Territory, but at the expense of the\r\nprinciple of home rule in the Territory, and upon the point of the\r\nsword of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geary and the Administration.]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of order in Kansas saved the Democratic party,\r\naccording to the general opinion, from the threatened defeat in the\r\nNovember election, and made Buchanan, instead of Fremont, President.\r\nAfter the danger was over, the Administration became less hearty in\r\nits support of Geary; and when Geary virtually espoused the\r\n\"Free-state\" cause, as he did during the winter of 1856-57, the\r\nAdministration became largely estranged from him. He resigned in\r\ndisgust on the day of Buchanan's inauguration to power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The judicial contribution to Kansas history.]\r\n\r\nThe next contribution to the history of the struggle for Kansas was to\r\ncome from an entirely new quarter. The new President indicated, in his\r\ninaugural, whence it was to come, if not what it was to be. He said:\r\n\"A difference of opinion has arisen in regard to the point of time\r\nwhen the people of a Territory shall decide this question\"--the\r\nquestion of slavery--\"for themselves. This is, happily, a matter of\r\nbut little practical importance. Besides it is a judicial question,\r\nwhich legitimately belongs to the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nbefore whom it is now pending, and will, it is understood, be speedily\r\nand finally settled.\" The President referred to the Dred Scott case,\r\nwhich had been twice argued before the {448} Supreme Court, and\r\ndecision upon which, it was understood, would be published to the\r\nworld in a few days. We must, therefore, break the thread of Kansas\r\nhistory here for a moment, and trace the history of this case down to\r\nthe point where it becomes connected with the further history of the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{449}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE DRED SCOTT CASE\r\n\r\nThe Origin of the Dred Scott Case--Two Dred Scott Cases--The Facts of\r\nthe Cases--The Case in the Missouri Courts--The Case in the United\r\nStates Courts--The Case a Genuine Proceeding--The Decision by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States--The Dissenting Opinion of Mr.\r\nJustice Curtis--Criticism of the Court's Opinion--The Obiter\r\nDictum--The Chief Justice and the President--Justice Curtis' Dissent\r\nContinued--The Printing and Distribution of the Decision and the\r\nDissenting Opinion--The Doctrine of Popular Sovereignty in the\r\nTerritories Overthrown by the Opinion of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The origin of the Dred Scott case.]\r\n\r\nThe time has come when the correct story of the Dred Scott case may be\r\ntold, and should be told. The author of this volume has been so\r\nfortunate as to obtain from A. C. Crane, Esq., of St. Louis, an\r\naccount of the early history of the case, which is entirely original\r\nand authentic. Mr. Crane was, at the time that the case was brought in\r\nthe Circuit Court of the United States, a clerk in the law office of\r\nthe great lawyer who espoused Dred Scott's case, and who freely gave\r\nhis legal services to the work of securing the negro's freedom,\r\nRoswell M. Field. Mr. Field was a native of Vermont, and a strong\r\nanti-slavery man. He was utterly incapable of any collusion with\r\nslaveholders for the getting up of a case, through which the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States might be brought to support the cause of\r\nslavery in the Territories, the purpose charged by many of the\r\nanti-slavery {450} men of the North for which this case was created.\r\nMr. Crane most emphatically declares that Mr. Field was influenced to\r\nundertake the case only by humanitarian motives of the highest order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two Dred Scott cases.]\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, two Dred Scott cases, one in the courts of\r\nMissouri, and one in the United States courts, but they had no\r\nconnection with each other. The case decided by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States originated in the Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates, and did not come up on a writ of error from the Missouri\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The facts of the cases.]\r\n\r\nThe facts in the two cases were, however, the same. One Dr. Emerson,\r\nthe owner of Dred Scott, had taken Dred, as his slave, into Illinois,\r\na Commonwealth in which slavery was forbidden, and then into the\r\nLouisiana territory above the latitude thirty-six degrees and thirty\r\nminutes, where slavery was prohibited by the Congressional Act of\r\n1820; had allowed Dred to marry in the free territory; had purchased\r\nthe woman he married from an army officer at a post within the same;\r\nand had taken Dred back to Missouri, with his wife and a child born to\r\nthem on free territory, and held them as slaves in Missouri. Dr.\r\nEmerson's return to Missouri was in 1838. In 1844 the Doctor died,\r\nleaving Dred and his wife and child to Mrs. Emerson. According to the\r\nstatement of facts recited by the Chief Justice of the United States,\r\nDr. Emerson sold Dred and his family to a Mr. Sandford, a citizen of\r\nNew York, the defendant in the case before the Supreme Court, but Mr.\r\nCrane says that Dr. Emerson's will, in the Probate Office at St.\r\nLouis, shows that Dred and his family belonged to the Doctor at the\r\ntime of the latter's death, and that Dred told him that such was the\r\ncase. Mr. Crane also says that Dred told him that, after the Doctor's\r\ndeath, Mrs. {451} Emerson hired him out to different persons, and that\r\nhe became dissatisfied with this treatment, and resolved to sue for\r\nhis freedom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case in the Missouri courts.]\r\n\r\nThis first suit was brought in one of the inferior courts of Missouri,\r\nand was decided in Dred's favor. Mrs. Emerson appealed the case to the\r\nsupreme court of Missouri, and two of the three judges upon that bench\r\nheld that the condition of slavery reattached to the negro upon his\r\nbeing brought back into Missouri, and reversed the decision of the\r\nlower court.\r\n\r\nWhile the case in the Missouri courts was in progress Mrs. Emerson\r\nmade over the control of the Scotts to a relative of hers, a Mr.\r\nSandford, then a citizen of New York, who hired them out to residents\r\nof Missouri. It was then, and for this reason, that Dred appealed to\r\nRoswell M. Field for his powerful aid in bringing suit against\r\nSandford in the Courts of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case in the United States courts.]\r\n\r\nThe case in the Circuit Court of the United States was begun before\r\nthe case in the Missouri court was concluded. The defendant in the\r\nCircuit Court of the United States first pleaded that Dred was not a\r\ncitizen of Missouri, and could not be, since he was a negro and\r\ndescended from slaves held in the United States, but the court\r\noverruled the plea, that is, decided that Dred Scott could be party in\r\na suit in the courts of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in the case consisted simply of a statement of facts\r\nagreed upon by the two parties. The pleas then put forward by the\r\ndefendant in bar of the action were argued, on the basis of this\r\nstatement, and the court ordered the jury to find for the defendant.\r\nJudgment was rendered in his favor in the month of April, 1854.\r\n\r\nMr. Field then carried the case to the Supreme Court {452} of the\r\nUnited States, upon a writ of error, and secured the services of his\r\nfriend, the Hon. Montgomery Blair, for the negro. Mr. Blair undertook\r\nthe management of the case at Washington, and, like Mr. Field, gave\r\nhis time and labor without pecuniary reward. The court costs incurred\r\nby Dred in both cases were paid by Taylor Blow, son of the man who\r\nsold Dred to Doctor Emerson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case a genuine proceeding.]\r\n\r\nThere is certainly not the slightest evidence in this history of the\r\ncase that the case was anything but a genuine proceeding from\r\nbeginning to end, conducted by anti-slavery men, for the purpose of\r\nsecuring the freedom of an intelligent and worthy African, who had\r\nbeen taken voluntarily by his master upon free soil, and had thus been\r\nmade, by the principles of the common law, a free man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The decision by the Supreme Court of the United States.]\r\n\r\nThe case was argued twice with great learning before the Supreme\r\nCourt, and the decision finally reached was virtually acquiesced in by\r\nseven of the nine Justices, although Justice Nelson did not give his\r\nassent to any part of the opinion except that which decided that, on\r\nthe return of Dred to Missouri with his master, any effect upon his\r\nslavery, which the taking of him into Illinois and the Louisiana\r\nterritory above the latitude thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes\r\nmight have had, disappeared. This seemed to Justice Nelson sufficient\r\nto the decision of the case, and he was unwilling to go farther, but\r\nsome of his brethren, especially Justice Wayne, thought that the\r\nentire record of the case in the Circuit Court was brought up for\r\nexamination by the Supreme Court, and that the Supreme Court ought to\r\ndecide every point contained in the record. Justice Nelson had been,\r\nat first, selected by his colleagues to write the opinion, and it is\r\nthought that this attitude of his was what moved the Chief Justice to\r\nwrite the opinion himself.\r\n\r\n{453} Justice Catron also thought that there was nothing before the\r\nSupreme Court but the question whether, after the return of the Scotts\r\nto Missouri, their temporary sojourn on free territory could be held\r\nto have worked their emancipation. Justice Catron presided at the\r\ntrial in the Circuit Court and ruled, as we have seen, in favor of\r\nDred Scott on the point of his having a standing in the United States\r\nCourts, and the Justice thought that Scott could not bring up to the\r\nSupreme Court, on a writ of error, a point decided in his favor in the\r\ncourt below.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice, Mr. Taney, held that there were two leading\r\nquestions presented by the record from the Circuit Court. The first\r\nwas the question whether the Circuit Court had jurisdiction over the\r\ncase, and the second was whether the judgment it gave was correct or\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice was right in holding that the writ of error brought\r\nup the entire record for examination by the Supreme Court, but it was\r\nnot necessary that the Supreme Court should include every point of the\r\nrecord in its decision. And he was certainly wrong when he extended,\r\nas is now generally conceded he did, the opinion of the court beyond\r\nthe points in the record of the case in the Circuit Court. The form of\r\nthe judgment pronounced by the Chief Justice as the opinion of the\r\nCourt, that is, of the majority of the Justices, was that the Circuit\r\nCourt did not have jurisdiction of the case, since the Scotts were not\r\ncitizens of Missouri, in the meaning of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court for the defendant\r\nmust, therefore, be set aside, and a mandate be issued, directing the\r\nsuit to be dismissed by the Circuit Court for want of jurisdiction.\r\nThe Chief Justice undertook to sustain his opinion by a long argument,\r\n{454} the principal propositions of which were, that negroes descended\r\nfrom negro slaves held in this country were not citizens in any of the\r\n\"States\" of the Union at the time of the formation of the Constitution\r\nof 1787; that by that Constitution the \"States\" transferred all power\r\nto make new classes of persons citizens to the Congress of the United\r\nStates, and limited the power of Congress in this respect to the\r\nnaturalization of persons born outside of the dominion of the United\r\nStates; and that, consequently, negroes born of negro slave parents in\r\nthe United States were not only not citizens of any of the \"States\" at\r\nthe time of the formation of the Constitution of 1787, but could not\r\nbe made such, either by the \"States\" or by Congress, subsequent to the\r\nadoption of that Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Curtis.]\r\n\r\nIn his powerful dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Curtis demolished this\r\nargument completely, by simply showing from the statute books and the\r\njudicial decisions of several of the \"States\" that, at the time of the\r\nformation of the Constitution of 1787, negroes descended from\r\nAfricans, who had been held as slaves in the country, were citizens,\r\neven to the point of possessing the suffrage, in several of the\r\n\"States\" of the Union. The great argument of the Chief Justice turned\r\nout to be only a political essay, without fact, law, or jurisprudence\r\nto sustain it. Mr. Justice Curtis, therefore, held that, as nothing\r\nagainst Dred Scott's citizenship had been alleged by the defendant in\r\nthe Circuit Court, except that he was a negro, and descended from\r\nnegroes who had been held as slaves in this country, the jurisdiction\r\nassumed by the Circuit Court ought to be sustained by the Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of the Court's opinion.]\r\n\r\nBut if the opinion of the Court should be accepted as correct upon\r\nthis point, it is difficult to see why the opinion should not have\r\nended with the decision upon {455} this point. Nothing further was\r\nnecessary in the determination of the case. And it is certainly most\r\ndifficult to see what connection the Act of 1820, prohibiting slavery\r\nin the Louisiana territory, north of the latitude thirty-six degrees\r\nand thirty minutes, had with the case. No decision upon that point was\r\nrendered by the Circuit Court, whose record the Supreme Court was\r\nreviewing.\r\n\r\nIf the Supreme Court had confirmed the jurisdiction of the Circuit\r\nCourt in the case, and had then ruled that the Circuit Court was in\r\nerror in holding that slavery reattached to the Scotts by Missouri\r\nlaw, upon their return to Missouri, even if they had been made free by\r\ntheir temporary sojourn upon free soil, probably the Supreme Court\r\nshould have decided the question as to what effect that sojourn may\r\nhave had, and, in this way, included the question of the\r\nconstitutionality of the slavery prohibition clause in the Act of\r\n1820. But the majority of the Supreme Court approved the view of the\r\nCircuit Court upon this point.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the majority of the Justices thought that a\r\ndeclaration from the Supreme Court in regard to the mooted question of\r\nslavery in the Territories would aid in bringing quiet to the country,\r\nand that they had persuaded themselves that it was necessary to the\r\ndecision of the point in issue. But they were certainly in error, as\r\nto the first consideration, and it is difficult to see that they were\r\nnot as to the second.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The obiter dictum.]\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice advanced to his conclusion in this part of the\r\nopinion through a most labored argument. He started with the dictum\r\nthat there was no clause in the Constitution which gave Congress any\r\npower over territory acquired subsequently to the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, interpreting the provision which vests in Congress \"the\r\npower to make {456} all needful rules and regulations concerning the\r\nterritory and other property of the United States,\" as applying only\r\nto territory held by the United States at the time of the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution. He then founded the power to govern the territory\r\nsubsequently acquired upon the right to acquire territory; and\r\ndeclared that in governing such territory, or providing for its\r\ngovernment, Congress was limited by all those provisions of the\r\nConstitution which protect private rights against governmental power.\r\nHe claimed, finally, that that one of these provisions which ordains\r\nthat no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without\r\ndue process of law protected property in slaves, taken into the\r\nTerritories by their masters, against both the power of Congress and\r\nof the agents of Congress in the Territories, the Territorial\r\ngovernments, to free them. The conclusion from this reasoning was that\r\nanybody could take slaves into a Territory of the United States, and\r\nhold them there in slavery, no matter what might be the disposition of\r\nCongress or of the Territorial government in regard to the subject,\r\nand that the question whether slavery was to be permanently\r\nestablished in a Territory or not could not be determined until the\r\nTerritory should become a \"State,\" and then only by an act of the\r\n\"State.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chief Justice and the President.]\r\n\r\nThis was the point which the Kansas-Nebraska Act had not covered, and\r\nwhich the President said, in his inaugural address, would be decided\r\nin the forthcoming opinion on the Dred Scott case. The opinion was\r\npronounced several days after the inaugural, and it was later charged\r\nby Mr. Seward, and intimated by Mr. Lincoln, and believed by a large\r\nnumber of persons, that the Chief Justice imparted the opinion of the\r\nCourt to the President before it was pronounced. But this point,\r\nthough {457} not necessarily involved in the case, had been argued by\r\ncounsel, and the newspapers had declared that it would be decided, and\r\nboth Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Taney were men of the highest personal and\r\nofficial integrity, and possessed the most delicate sense of the\r\nrequirements and proprieties of the great stations which they\r\noccupied. It is almost certain that the charge was an unfounded\r\nsuspicion. The prevalence of the suspicion was, however, an ominous\r\nsign of the danger impending over the land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justice Curtis's dissent continued.]\r\n\r\nJustice Curtis found no more difficulty in controverting these\r\npropositions than those upon the first point treated in the opinion of\r\nthe Chief Justice. He first referred to the undoubted facts that not\r\nall the territory claimed by the several \"States\" had been ceded to\r\nthe United States at the time that the Constitution of 1787 was\r\nadopted, but that it was expected that what remained would soon be so\r\nceded, and that therefore the clause vesting in Congress \"the power to\r\nmake all needful rules and regulations concerning the territory of the\r\nUnited States\" must have been framed with these future acquisitions in\r\nview, and intended to apply to them also. He then demanded to know\r\nwhy, if the Court could derive the power of Congress to govern\r\nterritory acquired from foreign states from a right which is not\r\nexpressed in the Constitution, but is itself implied, the right to\r\nacquire, should it hesitate to derive it from a power in respect to\r\nthe territory of the United States which is expressed in the\r\nConstitution. He contended that until Congress or the Territorial\r\nlegislature had legalized slavery in a Territory, no one could be said\r\nto be deprived of his property in slaves in the given Territory,\r\neither by a Congressional act forbidding the existence of such\r\nproperty, or by the failure of Congress or the Territorial {458}\r\nlegislature to enact laws for the security of such property. He\r\nrepudiated the idea that a holder of slaves could take the law of the\r\nplace from which he emigrated, securing such property, into a\r\nTerritory with him as a monstrosity in jurisprudence, since it would\r\nintroduce into a given Territory as many slave codes as there were\r\nslaveholding Commonwealths represented therein by their slaveholding\r\nemigrants, and he indicated, finally, that the reasoning of the Court\r\nmust reach ultimately the proposition that Congress was required by\r\nthe Constitution to establish slavery in every Territory of the Union,\r\nand consequently to make every new \"State\" a slaveholding \"State.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The printing and distribution of the decision and the\r\ndissenting opinion.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The doctrine of popular sovereignty in the Territories\r\noverthrown by the opinion of the Court.]\r\n\r\nThe slaveholders and the Douglas Democrats of the North were in high\r\nglee over the decision, and hardly stopped to read the powerful\r\ndissenting opinion which had shattered it to atoms. They caused\r\nthousands upon thousands of copies of the decision to be printed and\r\ndistributed among the masses of the people. The Free-soilers did the\r\nsame thing with the opinion of Justice Curtis. It was not many weeks\r\nbefore it became entirely manifest that the cause of slavery had lost\r\nimmensely by the decision, and the cause of free-soilism had gained in\r\nthe same degree. Justice Curtis had demonstrated that the decision had\r\ncast the responsibility for the further extension of slavery upon the\r\nnation, and the nation now began to show its resolution to meet its\r\nresponsibility by acquitting itself of any participation in this great\r\nwrong, in the only manner now left to it, that is, by preventing it.\r\nThe nation could no longer deceive itself with the idea that it could\r\nstand neutral. The Court had actually swept away the dogma of \"popular\r\nsovereignty\" in the Territories. The nation must now {459} neither\r\nprohibit, nor allow the Territorial governments to prohibit, slavery\r\nwithin the Territories, as the decision would have it, or the nation\r\nmust itself prohibit it, as the dissenting opinion would have it. When\r\nthese alternatives were distinctly recognized as necessary and\r\nexhaustive, it did not take the nation long to decide which course it\r\nmust pursue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{460}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR KANSAS CONCLUDED\r\n\r\nThe Lecompton Convention Ordered--Robert J.

This election was appointed for June 15th, 1857.\r\n\r\nIt was certain that the \"Free-State\" men now outnumbered the\r\npro-slavery men, and that upon a fair census, registration, and\r\ndistribution of seats, and with a fair election and count, they would\r\nbe able to secure the majority in the convention. But could they\r\nconsistently participate in an election ordered by, and under the\r\ncontrol of, the Territorial government? Many of them felt that they\r\ncould not. Others, however, were inclined to do so, if the regulations\r\nwere impartial. They examined the provisions made by the Territorial\r\nlegislature for the machinery of the registration and the election,\r\nand found that they were grossly favorable to the pro-slavery party.\r\nThey also found that the legislature had made no provision for\r\nsubmitting the constitution which might be framed to the vote of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robert J. Walker, and F. P. Stanton.]\r\n\r\nWhile the \"Free-state\" men were deliberating upon this matter, the new\r\nTerritorial officials appointed by the new President appeared.\r\nPresident Buchanan had selected Robert J. Walker, of Mississippi, to\r\nbe Governor, and F. P. Stanton, of Tennessee, to be Secretary, of the\r\nTerritory. Both of these men were capable, honest, and resolute.\r\nWalker was a shrewd politician, indeed, but he was fair-minded and\r\nfaithful to his plighted word. Stanton arrived on the scene about the\r\nmiddle of April. Walker came a month later. Stanton, therefore, was\r\nActing Governor during the first month of his residence in the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stanton and the \"Free-state\" men.]\r\n\r\nStanton went to Lawrence, on the 24th, and urged the {462}\r\n\"Free-state\" men to take part in the approaching election. He had,\r\nhowever, already apportioned the representation in the convention on\r\nthe basis of the existing census. It was evident that he was unaware\r\nthat this was unjust to the \"Free-state\" men. Seeing this, the\r\n\"Free-state\" men made a counter proposition for a new census and\r\napportionment, and for an impartial control of the elections. Stanton\r\ndid not think he had the power to conclude an agreement with them on\r\nthis basis, and the negotiations fell through.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Walker's address.]\r\n\r\nThe new Governor now arrived, and bent all his energies to induce the\r\n\"Free-state\" men to participate in the election. He issued an address,\r\nin which he solemnly declared that he would secure honest elections\r\nand returns, and pledged himself that the constitution, which the\r\nconvention might form, should be submitted to the people for\r\nratification or rejection. He also threatened that he would enforce\r\nthe laws of the Territory. His idea seems to have been to create an\r\nAdministration party, which would win a majority of the seats in the\r\nconvention and make Kansas a Democratic non-slaveholding Commonwealth.\r\nThe pro-slavery men discovered the plan at once, and accused the\r\nGovernor of leaning toward the \"Free-state\" party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Free-state\" legislature and mass-meeting.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Free-state\" men were not yet, however, ready to trust the\r\nGovernor. They thought it wisest to maintain their own organization,\r\nand make the Governor feel their power. On June 9th the \"Free-state\"\r\nlegislature assembled, to provide for the election of successors to\r\nthe existing members and officials. Along with it was convoked a sort\r\nof mass-meeting of citizens. The legislature was at first without a\r\nquorum, and never had an honest quorum. {463} This fact was sedulously\r\nconcealed from the Governor, while the orators at the mass-meeting\r\nraised enough dust and smoke to cover up the real condition of\r\naffairs. They made the place fairly blue with their bluster and their\r\nthreats, and the little Governor was greatly impressed by the apparent\r\nseriousness of the situation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The plan to capture the Territorial legislature by the\r\n\"Free-state\" men.]\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the \"Free-state\" men had become considerably\r\ndiscouraged in regard to the admission of Kansas into the Union under\r\nthe Topeka constitution. The Senate had given the application the cold\r\nshoulder, and had, apparently, laid it aside permanently. The\r\nprevarications of Lane were said to have produced this result. As\r\nmatters now stood, Robinson and the more conservative men of the\r\n\"Free-state\" party began to consider the advisability of attempting to\r\ncapture the Territorial legislature, by participating in the election\r\nof members, which was to take place in the following October. They\r\nfelt certain that upon a true census and a fair apportionment, and\r\nwith an honest election, they could win a majority of the seats in the\r\nlegislature, and would then be in a position to nullify the work of\r\nthe Lecompton convention, which, on account of the abstention of the\r\n\"Free-state\" men from the election of the delegates, would be packed\r\nwith pro-slavery representatives.\r\n\r\nThe matter of first importance was to obtain a true census. Senator\r\nWilson, of Massachusetts, was at the moment in Lawrence, conferring\r\nwith Robinson and his friends concerning the state of affairs, and he\r\nstrongly advised these gentlemen to take a correct census under the\r\nauspices of the \"Free-state\" government, and to nominate candidates\r\nfor seats in the Territorial legislature, and elect them. He felt so\r\ndecidedly about the matter that he offered to secure the funds\r\nnecessary to defray the expenses of taking the new census.\r\n\r\n{464} Robinson and his friends were now convinced that this was the\r\nwise course, but they knew that it would be difficult to persuade the\r\nradical elements in their party to go with them. The mass-meeting at\r\nTopeka of June 9th had voted to stick to the \"Free-state\" government,\r\nand a convention of the \"Free-state\" men had assembled on July 15th to\r\nprovide for its continuance. This convention, after nominating\r\ncandidates for the legislative seats and for the offices, and\r\nresolving to adhere to the \"Free-state\" government, recommended the\r\npeople to assemble in mass convention, at Grasshopper Falls, on the\r\n26th of the following August, to take action in regard to the\r\nparticipation of the \"Free-state\" men in the October election of\r\nmembers of the Territorial legislature, since Governor Walker had\r\ndeclared that this election would be held under the laws of Congress,\r\nand not under the acts of the Territorial legislature, and had pledged\r\nhimself to secure an honest election. It was evident from this that\r\nthe conservative element in the \"Free-state\" party had won the day.\r\n\r\nBefore the day appointed for the Grasshopper Falls convention had\r\narrived, the new census had been completed under the direction of the\r\n\"Free-state\" government, and it was morally certain that the\r\n\"Free-state\" men could elect a majority of the members of the new\r\nTerritorial legislature. When the convention assembled, it therefore\r\nresolved, by a large majority, that the \"Free-state\" men should\r\nparticipate in the October election, warning the people, however, of\r\nthe seriousness of the undertaking, and cautioning them against\r\nover-confidence in success.\r\n\r\nThe Lecompton convention assembled on the seventh day of September,\r\nand, after organizing, adjourned to October 19th, as if to await the\r\nresult of the election of the members of the Territorial legislature.\r\n\r\n{465} [Sidenote: The \"Free-state\" men in majority in the Territorial\r\nlegislature.]\r\n\r\nThis election came off on October 5th. The Governor remained true to\r\nhis pledge of protecting the ballot-box. The presence of United States\r\nsoldiers discouraged any movements from Missouri, and peace reigned at\r\nthe polls. The returns from the counties of McGee and Johnson were,\r\nhowever, so manipulated by the pro-slavery election officers as to\r\ngive the majority of the seats in the legislature to the pro-slavery\r\nparty. These returns, as well as those from the other counties, were,\r\nhowever, to be canvassed finally by the Governor and Secretary. The\r\n\"Free-state\" men now demanded of them the fulfilment of their pledge\r\nof pure elections. The \"Free-state\" men had their newly taken census,\r\nand they convinced the Governor and Secretary that about ten times as\r\nmany votes had been returned from these localities as there were\r\nresidents in them. Walker and Stanton threw out the fraudulent\r\nreturns, and gave, thus, the Territorial legislature to the\r\n\"Free-state\" men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lecompton convention.]\r\n\r\nTwo days before the Governor announced his intention of purging the\r\nreturns of the frauds committed by the pro-slavery men in regard to\r\nthem, and while the excitement about them was intense, it was suddenly\r\ndiscovered by the conservative \"Free-state\" men that Lane was working\r\nup a conspiracy for using violence against the members of the\r\nLecompton convention. He, as commander-in-chief, had ordered the\r\n\"Free-state\" forces to assemble in Lawrence on October 19th for that\r\npurpose. The conservative men at once set themselves against this\r\nmovement, and after a serious struggle happily won the day. They\r\nappointed a mass-meeting of the party at Lecompton for the following\r\nweek, as much to protect the members of the convention against any\r\nsudden attack by {466} Lane and his reckless adherents as to watch\r\ntheir constitution-framing work. Before the meeting took place the\r\nGovernor had announced the rejection of the fraudulent returns, and\r\nhad thus deprived the \"Free-state\" men of all excuse for violence.\r\nSome boisterous speeches were, nevertheless, indulged in at the\r\nmeeting, but the convention was allowed to complete its work in peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lecompton constitution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Only the Slavery article to be submitted fully to the\r\npeople.]\r\n\r\nThe convention framed an instrument after the Missouri model, and\r\nincorporated in it an article guaranteeing the property in slaves\r\nalready within the Territory. The convention then framed an\r\nindependent provision in regard to slavery as a permanent institution\r\nof the new Commonwealth. This provision alone was to be fully\r\nsubmitted to the vote of the people. The people must take the\r\nLecompton constitution with slavery as a permanent institution, or the\r\nLecompton constitution without slavery as a permanent institution but\r\ncontaining a guarantee of the slave property already in the Territory.\r\nThe day appointed by the convention for the voters to signify their\r\napproval or disapproval of the provision in regard to slavery as a\r\npermanent institution was December 21st, 1857, and the day designated\r\nfor the election of members and officers under the new constitution\r\nwas January 4th following.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protest of the \"Free-state\" men.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Free-state\" men regarded this submission of only a single article\r\nof the constitution to popular vote as a fraud upon the principle of\r\n\"popular sovereignty,\" and demanded of Stanton, who was then\r\ndischarging the Governor's duties, in the temporary absence of the\r\nlatter, that the Governor's pledge as to the full submission of the\r\nproposed constitution to the people at the polls should be redeemed.\r\nStanton bravely resolved to keep the Governor's word of {467} honor,\r\nalthough he believed it would cost him his position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The extra session of the new Territorial legislature.]\r\n\r\nWhat the \"Free-state\" men asked of him was to convene at once the new\r\nTerritorial legislature, in which the \"Free-state\" men now had a\r\nmajority of the seats, for the purpose of giving it the opportunity to\r\norder the full submission of the Lecompton constitution to the\r\nsuffrages of the people. Stanton yielded to their request, and called\r\nthe legislature to meet at Lecompton on December 7th. This body at\r\nonce resolved to submit the proposed constitution fully and in all its\r\nparts to the people, to be adopted or rejected by them at their\r\npleasure, and appointed the 4th day of the following January as the\r\ntime for taking the vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stanton removed.]\r\n\r\nStanton was immediately removed from office by the Administration, and\r\nGeneral John W. Denver, of Virginia, at the moment Indian\r\nCommissioner, was assigned to the duties of Acting Governor in the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lecompton constitution with slavery adopted.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Free-state\" men resolved to take no part in voting upon the\r\nslavery article of the Lecompton constitution, since they must take\r\nthis constitution either with or without slavery as a permanent\r\ninstitution, and could not vote against the constitution as a whole.\r\nConsequently the Lecompton constitution with slavery as a permanent\r\ninstitution was, so far as the returns of the voting on December 21st\r\nwere concerned, adopted. According to these returns six thousand two\r\nhundred and sixty-six votes were cast for it. Of these, nearly three\r\nthousand were afterward shown to be fraudulent. Between five and six\r\nhundred votes were cast for this constitution without slavery as a\r\npermanent institution. None were counted against it _in toto_. That is\r\nto say, out of a {468} voting population of about fifteen thousand,\r\nless than four thousand were in favor of this constitution in either\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe more prudent of the \"Free-state\" men now thought, however, that it\r\nwould be wise to participate in the election of members and officers\r\nof the Lecompton \"State\" government on the day fixed by the Lecompton\r\nconstitution, January 4th, 1858. They were to vote fully at that time,\r\nas we have seen, upon the Lecompton constitution, by order of the\r\nTerritorial legislature, now in their hands. They felt certain of\r\ndefeating the constitution, and they knew that they could win in the\r\nelection of the officers and members. They nominated a ticket with G.\r\nW. Smith at its head, as their candidate for Governor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Free-state\" men capture the Lecompton government and\r\nreject the Lecompton constitution.]\r\n\r\nOn January 4th, more than ten thousand votes were cast against the\r\nLecompton constitution entire, and only about one hundred and fifty\r\nvotes were cast in its favor. The \"Free-state\" men also elected their\r\ncandidates for the offices and seats in the government created by the\r\nLecompton constitution.\r\n\r\nThe \"Free-state\" men now had possession of the Topeka \"Free-state\"\r\ngovernment, of the Territorial legislature, and of the Lecompton\r\n\"State\" government, and had rejected the Lecompton constitution by an\r\nundoubted majority of the suffrages of the citizens of Kansas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEBRASKA & KANSAS, 1854-61.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Denver advises the President against the admission of\r\nKansas under the Lecompton instrument.]\r\n\r\nAs yet the Lecompton constitution had not been presented by the\r\nPresident to Congress, and Acting Governor Denver hastened to give him\r\na truthful statement of the condition of affairs in the Territory, and\r\nto urge him not to recommend to Congress the admission of Kansas under\r\nthis constitution, but to suggest to that body the passage simply of\r\nan enabling {469} act, under which the people of Kansas might begin\r\nagain the work of forming a Commonwealth constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's message of February 2nd (1858).]\r\n\r\nBut the President did not heed this wise warning. On February 2nd,\r\n1858, he sent the Lecompton constitution, with the provision making\r\nslavery a permanent institution in Kansas, to Congress, and\r\nrecommended the admission of the distracted Territory into the Union,\r\nas a \"State,\" under it. His line of argument was that every step in\r\nthe procedure of framing and adopting this constitution had been\r\nregularly and legally taken, and that all the voters could have\r\nparticipated in the work if they had chosen to do so. He claimed that\r\nthe act of the Territorial legislature, after it came under the\r\ncontrol of the \"Free-state\" men, in ordering another vote, and a\r\ndifferent sort of vote, upon the constitution, than and from that\r\nappointed and required by the convention, was irregular; and he\r\nundertook to comfort the \"Free-state\" men with the suggestion that,\r\nKansas once admitted, they could change its constitution to suit\r\nthemselves, if they were really in majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the Lecompton bill by the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThe President's argument carried the Senate with him despite the\r\npowerful opposition of Mr. Douglas, who bravely antagonized the\r\nAdministration, and held firmly that his great principle of \"popular\r\nsovereignty\" required the unreserved submission of every part of the\r\nconstitution to the free suffrages of the people, in order to\r\nestablish its validity. He declared that unless this should be done\r\nCongress could not know whether the people of Kansas had made a\r\nconstitution or not, and that without that knowledge the admission of\r\nKansas under the constitution before the Senate was tantamount to\r\nmaking a {470} constitution for Kansas by Congressional act. The\r\nhonest and manly stand taken by Mr. Douglas upon this great subject\r\ncertainly presents him in the role of a patriotic statesman, rather\r\nthan in his usual character of the shrewd politician.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rejection of the bill by the House.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate passed the Lecompton bill on March 23rd, 1858, by a\r\nsubstantial majority, but the House promptly rejected it. The House\r\npassed a measure, instead, for referring the Lecompton constitution\r\nback to the people of Kansas, who should vote freely upon it in all\r\nits parts, and for admitting Kansas, without further Congressional\r\naction, under this constitution, if it should receive the popular\r\nratification; but the Senate rejected this substitute for its bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The English bill.]\r\n\r\nThe matter was then sent to a conference committee of the two Houses.\r\nAfter long deliberation a measure was matured by this committee which\r\nappeared to deal with a subsidiary question only, but which, by some\r\nsort of an understanding, was held to give the people of Kansas the\r\nchance to reject the Lecompton constitution _in toto_ at the polls.\r\nThe measure is known as the English bill from its projector, Mr. W. H.\r\nEnglish, a member of the conference committee from the House of\r\nRepresentatives. It provided for a reduction of the land grants from\r\ntwenty-three millions of acres, asked for by Kansas under the\r\nLecompton constitution, to about four millions of acres, and proposed\r\nthe submission of this change to a vote of the people of Kansas. If\r\nthe people adopted the change, they would be considered as having\r\nadopted the Lecompton constitution _in toto_. If, on the other hand,\r\nthey rejected this change, they would be considered as having rejected\r\nthis constitution _in toto_.\r\n\r\n{471} [Sidenote: The rejection of the Lecompton constitution by the\r\npeople of Kansas.]\r\n\r\nThe English bill was agreed to by both Houses; and on August 2nd,\r\n1858, the people of Kansas voted upon the measure. They rejected it,\r\nand with it the Lecompton constitution, by a vote of more than eleven\r\nthousand in a total vote of about thirteen thousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A fourth government for Kansas.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, fearing that Congress might pass the bill for\r\nadmitting Kansas under the Lecompton constitution, the Territorial\r\nlegislature, now in the hands of the \"Free-state\" men, passed a bill\r\nordering a new constitutional convention. The bill was passed within a\r\nfew days of the end of the session, and Governor Denver, thinking that\r\nKansas had about enough governments already, pocketed the measure. The\r\nconvention was, however, held, and a constitution was framed and\r\nsubmitted to the people which received some three thousand votes in\r\nfavor of its adoption, while none were cast against it. Officers were\r\nchosen under it, and thus a fourth government for Kansas was created.\r\nAll of these governments were now, however, in the hands of the\r\nconservative men of the \"Free-state\" party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The struggle for Kansas closed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Robinson.]\r\n\r\nWith the rejection of the Lecompton constitution by the people of\r\nKansas, on August 2nd, the struggle for Kansas was closed. It was to\r\nbe a non-slaveholding Commonwealth and a Republican Commonwealth. The\r\nrecord of this struggle is certainly one of the most remarkable\r\nchapters in the history of the United States. There is much to admire\r\nin it, much to be ashamed of, and much to be repudiated as foul and\r\ndevilish. The prudence, moderation, tact, and bravery of Dr. Robinson\r\nand his friends have rarely been excelled by the statesmen and\r\ndiplomatists of the New World or of the Old. They were placed in a\r\nmost trying situation {472} both by their foes and by those who,\r\nprofessing to be their friends, endangered the cause more by violent\r\nand brutal deeds than did their open enemies. Their triumph over all\r\nthese difficulties is a marvel of shrewd, honest, and conservative\r\nmanagement, which may well serve as one of the best object-lessons of\r\nour history for succeeding generations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The general Government.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Jefferson Davis.]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the general Government was also honorable and\r\npraiseworthy. It did its best to hold the balance even and impartial\r\nbetween the contending forces. It sent out intelligent, honest, and\r\nresolute men as Governors; and it used the army to maintain the peace,\r\nand protect person and property from violence. Even President Pierce's\r\nSecretary of War, Mr. Jefferson Davis, who was considered the very\r\nhigh-priest of the slavery interest, sent a military commander,\r\nColonel E. V. Sumner, to Kansas, whom he knew to be in sympathy with\r\nFree-soil principles, and instructed him only to do what was just\r\nbetween all parties; and when Colonel Sumner, fearing that, from\r\npersonal sympathy with the cause of the \"Free-state\" men, he might\r\nunconsciously act too favorably toward them, really went farther than\r\nhis duty required against them, in dispersing their legislature, Mr.\r\nDavis expressed the opinion that the United States forces ought not to\r\nhave interfered with the \"Free-state\" government until it had\r\nundertaken to execute some of its measures. It was said at the time\r\nthat Mr. Davis' quasi disavowal of Colonel Sumner's act was caused by\r\nits unpopularity throughout the North; but Mr. Davis was not to any\r\nsuch degree sensitive to Northern opinion. Personally and officially\r\nMr. Davis was a remarkably upright man, and was accustomed to take\r\ncounsel chiefly of his own judgment and conscience, and to disturb\r\nhimself very little about the views of {473} others concerning his\r\nduties and acts. Governor Robinson has recently testified to the\r\nimpartial attitude of the military power of the United States in\r\nKansas, and has declared that \"had it not been for the officers of the\r\nUnited States army, the 'Free-state' struggle would have ended in\r\ndisaster on more than one occasion.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The beginning of error and wrong.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brown's atrocities.]\r\n\r\nError began, unquestionably, with the repeal of the Act prohibiting\r\nslavery in the Louisiana territory above thirty-six degrees and thirty\r\nminutes north latitude, and wrong began, just as unquestionably, with\r\nthe incursion of the Missourians, and their fraudulent voting at the\r\nTerritorial election in March of 1855. A bogus legislature was thus\r\nthrust upon Kansas Territory at the outset. It was a political outrage\r\nof the first degree, and it would have justified rebellion against the\r\nexecution of the enactments of this body. But it does not excuse, or\r\neven palliate, the criminal atrocities inaugurated by John Brown at\r\nDutch Henry's Crossing, and the wild reign of murder and robbery which\r\nfollowed in their train. All this was common crime of the blackest and\r\nmost villainous sort, and the men who engaged in it were cutthroats\r\nand highwaymen, who took advantage of the confusion in Kansas to\r\nprosecute their nefarious work.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the Civil War began in Kansas, and simply spread\r\nfrom there over the country. It is true that violence began there, and\r\nin its degeneration into savagery developed those devilish\r\ndispositions that carried murder and robbery into Virginia, and\r\nthereby helped mightily to create that intensely hostile feeling\r\nbetween the North and the South which resulted in Civil War, but we\r\naffront good morals and common sense when we dignify those Kansas\r\natrocities by the title of war; and we obliterate moral distinctions\r\nwhen {474} we attempt to justify them by the end which their authors\r\nprofessed to have in view, the extermination of African slavery\r\nthroughout the country. Such deeds are not means to anything except\r\nthe establishment of the reign of hell on earth, and the maudlin\r\nadoration sometimes accorded their doers is evidence of an unbalanced\r\nmoral sense. It is a source of congratulation that the juristic sense\r\nof the last decades of the nineteenth century refuses to place the\r\ncrank who kills or robs for what he considers, or professes to\r\nconsider, the welfare of society under any other class than that of\r\nthe most dangerous criminals. It remains for the ethical sense of the\r\ntwentieth century to sweep the hero-worship too often accorded such\r\ncharacters out of the world's literature.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The forerunners of war.]\r\n\r\nBut if the murders, and robberies, and arson committed in Kansas were\r\nnot war, they were the forerunners of war. The last expedient which\r\nthe minds of men could invent for putting the slavery question in the\r\nposition of a purely local matter had been tried, and had utterly and\r\nmiserably failed. The nation must now settle the question, by\r\npeaceable means if it could, but if it could not, then by force. The\r\nrecord of its attempts, first upon the one line, and then upon the\r\nother, will be the chief subject of the next and last volume of this\r\nseries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n
