Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nWhy should we fetch Taine's work up from its dusty box in the basement\r\nof the national library? First of all because his realistic views of our\r\nhuman nature, of our civilization and of socialism as well as his dark\r\npremonitions of the 20th century were proven correct. Secondly because\r\nwe may today with more accuracy call his work:\r\n\r\n\"The Origins of Popular Democracy and of Communism.\"\r\n\r\nHis lucid analysis of the current ideology remains as interesting\r\nor perhaps even more interesting than when it was written especially\r\nbecause we cannot accuse him of being part in our current political and\r\nideological struggle.\r\n\r\nEven though I found him wise, even though he confirmed my own\r\nimpressions from a rich and varied life, even though I considered that\r\nour children and the people at large should benefit from his insights\r\ninto the innermost recesses of the political Man, I still felt it would\r\nbe best to find out why his work had been put on the index by the\r\nFrench and largely forgotten by the Anglo-Saxon world. So I consulted\r\na contemporary French authority, Jean-François Revel who mentions Taine\r\nworks in his book, \"La Connaissance Inutile.\" (Paris 1988). Revel notes\r\nthat a socialist historian, Alphonse Aulard methodically and dishonestly\r\nattacked \"Les Origines..\", and that Aulard was specially recruited by\r\nthe University of Sorbonne for this purpose. Aulard pretended that Taine\r\nwas a poor historian by finding a number of errors in Taine's work. This\r\nwas done, says Revel, because the 'Left' came to see Taine's work as \"a\r\nvile counter-revolutionary weapon.\" The French historian Augustin Cochin\r\nproved, however, that Aulard and not Taine had made the errors but by\r\nthat time Taine had been defamed and his works removed from the shelves\r\nof the French universities.\r\n\r\nNow Taine was not a professional historian. Perhaps this was as\r\nwell since most professional historians, even when conscientious and\r\naccurate, rarely are in a position to be independent. They generally\r\nwork for a university, for a national public or for the ministry of\r\neducation and their books, once approved, may gain a considerable income\r\nonce millions of pupils are compelled to acquire these.\r\n\r\nTaine initially became famous, not as a professional historian but as a\r\nliterary critic and journalist. His fame allowed him to sell his books\r\nand articles and make a comfortable living without cow-towing to any\r\ngovernment or university. He wrote as he saw fit, truthfully, even\r\nthough it might displease a number of powerful persons.\r\n\r\nTaine did not pretend to be a regular historian, but rather someone\r\nenquiring into the history of Public Authorities and their supporters.\r\nThrough his comments he appears not only as a decent person but also as\r\na psychologist and seer. He describes mankind, as I know it from my\r\nlife in institutions, at sea and abroad in a large international\r\norganization. He describes mankind as it was, as it was seen by Darwin\r\nin 'THE EXPRESSIONS OF EMOTIONS IN MAN AND ANIMALS. Taine described\r\nthe human being as he was and is and had the courage to tell the French\r\nabout themselves, their ancient rulers, and the men of the Revolution,\r\neven if it went against the favorable opinion so many of his countrymen\r\nhad of this terrible period. His understanding of our evolution, of\r\nmankind and of the evolution of society did not find favor with men who\r\nbelieved that they in the socialist ideology had found the solution to\r\nall social ills. Only recently has science begun to return to Darwin\r\nin order to rediscover the human being as Taine knew him. You can find\r\nTaine's views of humanity confirmed in Robert Wright's book 'THE MORAL\r\nANIMAL.' (Why we are the way we are.)\r\n\r\nTaine had full access to the files of the French National archives\r\nand these and other original documents. Taine had received a French\r\nclassical education and, being foremost among many brilliant men, had a\r\ncapacity for study and work which we no longer demand from our young.\r\nHe accepted Man and society, as they appeared to him, he described\r\nhis findings without compassion for the hang-ups of his prejudiced\r\ncountrymen. He described Man as a gregarious animal living for a brief\r\nspell in a remote corner of space, whose different cultures and nations\r\nhad evolved haphazardly in time, carried along by forces and events\r\nexceeding our comprehension, blindly following their innate drives.\r\nThese drives were followed with cunning but rarely with far-sighted\r\nwisdom. Taine, the prophet, has more than ever something to tell us.\r\nHe warned his countrymen against themselves, their humanity, and hence\r\nagainst their fears, anxieties, greed, ambitions, conceit and excessive\r\nimagination. His remarks and judgments exhort us to be responsible,\r\nmodest and kind and to select wise and modest leaders. He warns us\r\nagainst young hungry men's natural desire to mass behind a tribune and\r\nfollow him onwards, they hope, along the high road to excitement, fame,\r\npower and riches. He warns us against our readiness to believe in myth\r\nand metaphysics, demonstrating how Man will believe anything, even the\r\nmost mystical or incomprehensible religion or ideology, provided it is\r\npreached by his leaders. History, as seen by Taine, is one long series\r\nof such adventures and horrors and nowhere was this more evident than in\r\nFrance before, during and after the Revolution in 1789.\r\n\r\nTaine became, upon reading 'On the Origins of the Species' a convinced\r\nDarwinian and was, the year after Darwin, honored by the University of\r\nOxford with the title of doctor honoris causa in jure civili for his\r\n'History of English Literature'. Taine was not a methodical ideologist\r\ncreating a system. He did not defend any particular creed or current. He\r\nwas considered some kind of positivist but he did not consider himself\r\nas belonging to any particular school.\r\n\r\nThe 6 volumes of \"Les Origines de la France Contemporaine\" appeared one\r\nafter the other in Paris between 1875 and 1893. They were translated\r\ninto English and published in New York soon afterwards. They were also\r\ntranslated into German. Taine's direct views displeased many in France,\r\nas the Royalists, the bonapartist and the Socialists felt hurt. Still,\r\nthe first edition of Volume II of \"LE RÉGIME MODERNE\" published by\r\nHachette in 1894 indicated that \"L'ANCIEN REGIME\" at that time had been\r\nprinted in 18 editions, \"LA RÉVOLUTION\" volume I in 17 editions, volume\r\nII in 16 editions and volume III in 13 editions. \"LE RÉGIME MODERNE\"\r\nvolume I had been printed in only 8 editions. Photographic reprints\r\nappeared in the US in 1932 and 1962.\r\n\r\nTaine's description and analysis of events in France between 1750 and\r\n1870 are, as you will see colorful, lucid, and sometimes intense. His\r\nstyle might today appear dated since he writes in rather long sentences,\r\nusing parables to drive his points firmly home. His books were widely\r\nread in academic circles and therefore influenced a great many political\r\nstudents in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lenin, who came to\r\nParis around 1906, might well have profited by Taine's analysis. Hitler\r\nis also likely to have profited by his insights. Lenin was like so many\r\nother socialists of his day a great admirer of Robespierre and his party\r\nand would undoubtedly have tried to find out how Robespierre got into\r\npower and why he lost his hold on France the way he did. Part of Taine's\r\nart was to place himself into the place of the different people and\r\nparties who took part in the great events. When pretends to speak for\r\nthe Jacobins, it so convincingly done, that it is hard to know whether\r\nhe speaks on 'their' behalf or whether he is, in fact, quoting one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTaine, like the Napoleon he described, believed that in order to\r\nunderstand people you are aided if you try to imagine yourself in their\r\nplace. This procedure, as well as his painstaking research, make his\r\ndescriptions of the violent events of the past ring true.\r\n\r\nTaine knew and described the evil inherent in human nature and in\r\nthe crowd. His warnings and explanations did not prevent Europe from\r\nrepeating the mistakes of the past. The 20th century saw a replay of the\r\nFrench Revolution repeated in all its horror when Lenin, Mao, Hoxa, and\r\nPol Pot followed the its script and when Stalin and Hitler made good use\r\nof Napoleon's example.\r\n\r\nTaine irritated the elite of the 3rd French republic as well as everyone\r\nwho believed in the popular democracy based on one person one vote. You\r\ncan understand when you read the following preface which was actually\r\nplaced in front of \"The Revolution\" volume II. Since it clarifies\r\nTaine's aims and justifications, I have moved and placed it below.\r\n\r\nNot long before his death Taine, sensing that his wisdom and deep\r\ninsights into human nature and events, no longer interested the élite,\r\nremarked to a friend that \"the scientific truth about the human animal\r\nis perhaps unacceptable except for a very few\".[0001] Now, 100 years\r\nlater, after a century of ideological wars between ambitious men, I am\r\nafraid that the situation remains unchanged. Mankind remains reluctant\r\nto face the realities of our uncontrolled existence! A few men begin,\r\nhowever, to share my misgivings about the future of a system which has\r\ncompletely given up the respect for wisdom and experience preferring\r\na system of elaborate human rights and new morals. There is reason to\r\nrecall Macchiavelli's words:\r\n\r\n\"In times of difficulty men of merit are sought after, but in easy times\r\nit is not men of merit, but such as have riches and powerful relations,\r\nthat are most in favor.\"\r\n\r\nAnd let me to quote the Greek historian Polybius' observations[0002]\r\nabout the cyclic evolution of the Greek city states:\r\n\r\n\". . . What then are the beginnings I speak of and what is the first\r\norigin of political societies? When owing to floods, famines, failure of\r\ncrops or other such causes there occurs such a destruction of the human\r\nrace as tradition tells us has more than once happened, and as we must\r\nbelieve will often happen again, all arts and crafts perishing at the\r\nsame time, when in the course of time, when springing from the survivors\r\nas from seeds men have again increased in numbers and just like other\r\nanimals form herds--it being a matter of course that they too\r\nshould herd together with those of their kind owing to their natural\r\nweakness--it is a necessary consequence that the man who excels in\r\nbodily strength and in courage will lead and rule over the rest. We\r\nobserve and should regard as a most genuine work of nature this very\r\nphenomenon in the case of the other animals which act purely by instinct\r\nand among who the strongest are always indisputable the masters--I speak\r\nof bulls, boars, cocks, and the like. It is probable then that at the\r\nbeginning men lived thus, herding together like animals and following\r\nthe lead of the strongest and bravest, the ruler's strength being here\r\nthe sole limit to his power and the name we should give his rule being\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nBut when in time feelings of sociability and companionship begin to grow\r\nin such gatherings of men, then kingship has truck root; and the notions\r\nof goodness, justice, and their opposites begin to arise in men.\r\n\r\n6. The manner in which these notions come into being is as follows. Men\r\nbeing all naturally inclined to sexual intercourse, and the consequence\r\nthis being the birth of children, whenever one of those who have been\r\nreared does not on growing up show gratitude to those who reared him\r\nor defend them, but on the contrary takes to speaking ill of them or\r\nill-treating them, it is evident that he will displease and offend those\r\nwho have been familiar with his parents and have witnessed the care and\r\npains they spent on attending to and feeding their children. For seeing\r\nthat men are distinguished from the other animals possessing the faculty\r\nof reason, it is obviously improbable that such a difference of conduct\r\nshould escape them, as it escapes the other animals: they will notice\r\nthe thing and be displeased at what is going on, looking to the future\r\nand reflecting that they may all meet with the same treatment. Again\r\nwhen a man who has been helped or succored when in danger by another\r\ndoes not show gratitude to his preserver, but even goes to the length of\r\nattempting to do him injury, it is clear that those who become aware of\r\nit will naturally be displeased and offended by such conduct, sharing\r\nthe resentment of their injured neighbor and imagining themselves in the\r\nsame situation. From all this there arises in everyone a notion of the\r\nmeaning and theory of duty, which is the beginning and end of justice.\r\nSimilarly, again, when any man is foremost in defending his fellows from\r\ndanger, and braves and awaits the onslaught of the most powerful beasts,\r\nit is natural that he should receive marks of favor and honor from the\r\npeople, while the man who acts in the opposite manner will meet with\r\nreprobation and dislike. From this again some idea of what is base and\r\nwhat is noble and of what constitutes the difference is likely to arise\r\namong the people; and noble conduct will be admired and imitated because\r\nadvantageous, while base conduct will be avoided. Now when the leading\r\nand most powerful man among people always throws the weight of his\r\nauthority the side of the notions on such matters which generally\r\nprevail, and when in the opinion of his subjects he apportions rewards\r\nand penalties according to desert, they yield obedience to him no longer\r\nbecause they fear his force, but rather because their judgment approves\r\nhim; and they join in maintaining his rule even if he is quite enfeebled\r\nby age, defending him with one consent and battling against those who\r\nconspire to overthrow his rule. Thus by insensible degrees the monarch\r\nbecomes a king, ferocity and force having yielded the supremacy to\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n7. Thus is formed naturally among men the first notion of goodness and\r\njustice, and their opposites; this is the beginning and birth of true\r\nkingship. For the people maintain the supreme power not only in the\r\nhands of these men themselves, but in those of their descendants, from\r\nthe conviction that those born from and reared by such men will also\r\nhave principles like to theirs. And if they ever are displeased with the\r\ndescendants, they now choose their kings and rulers no longer for their\r\nbodily strength and brute courage, but for the excellency of their\r\njudgment and reasoning powers, as they have gained experience from\r\nactual facts of the difference between the one class of qualities and\r\nthe other. In old times, then, those who had once been chosen to the\r\nroyal office continued to hold it until they grew old, fortifying and\r\nenclosing fine strongholds with walls and acquiring lands, in the one\r\ncase for the sake of the security of their subjects and in the other\r\nto provide them with abundance of the necessities of life. And while\r\npursuing these aims, they were exempt from all vituperation or jealousy,\r\nas neither in their dress nor in their food and drink did they make any\r\ngreat distinction, but lived very much like everyone else, not keeping\r\napart from the people. But when they received the office by hereditary\r\nsuccession and found their safety now provided for, and more than\r\nsufficient provision of food, they gave way to their appetites owing\r\nto this superabundance, and came to think that the rulers must be\r\ndistinguished from their subjects by a peculiar dress, that there should\r\nbe a peculiar luxury and variety in the dressing and serving of their\r\nviands, and that they should meet with no denial in the pursuit of their\r\namours, however lawless. These habits having given rise in the one\r\ncase to envy and offence and in the other to an outburst of hatred and\r\npassionate resentment, the kingship changed into a tyranny; the first\r\nsteps towards its overthrow were taken by the subjects, and conspiracies\r\nbegan to be formed. These conspiracies were not the work of the worst\r\nmen, but of the noblest, most high-spirited, and most courageous,\r\nbecause such men are least able to brook the insolence of princes.\r\n\r\n8. The people now having got leaders, would combine with them against\r\nthe ruling powers for the reasons I stated above; king-ship and monarchy\r\nwould be utterly abolished, and in their place aristocracy would begin\r\nto grow. For the commons, as if bound to pay at once their debt of\r\ngratitude to the abolishers of monarchy, would make them their leaders\r\nand entrust their destinies to them. At first these chiefs gladly\r\nassumed this charge and regarded nothing as of greater importance than\r\nthe common interest, administering the private and public affairs of the\r\npeople with paternal solicitude. But here again when children inherited\r\nthis position of authority from their fathers, having no experience of\r\nmisfortune and none at all of civil equality and liberty of speech, and\r\nhaving been brought up from the cradle amid the evidences of the power\r\nand high position of their fathers, they abandoned themselves some to\r\ngreed of gain and unscrupulous money-making, others to indulgence in\r\nwine and the convivial excess which accompanies it, and others again\r\nto the violation of women and the rape of boys; and thus converting the\r\naristocracy info an oligarchy aroused in the people feelings similar\r\nto those of which I just spoke, and in consequence met with the same\r\ndisastrous end as the tyrant.\r\n\r\n9. For whenever anyone who has noticed the jealousy and hatred with\r\nwhich they are regarded by the citizens, has the courage to speak or\r\nact against the chiefs of the state he has the whole mass of the people\r\nready to back him. Next, when they have either killed or banished the\r\noligarchs, they no longer venture to set a king over them, as they still\r\nremember with terror the injustice they suffered from the former ones,\r\nnor can they entrust the government with confidence to a select few,\r\nwith the evidence before them of their recent error in doing so. Thus\r\nthe only hope still surviving unimpaired is in themselves, and to this\r\nthey resort, making the state a democracy instead of an oligarchy and\r\nassuming the responsibility for the conduct of affairs. Then as long\r\nas some of those survive who experienced the evils of oligarchical\r\ndominion, they are well pleased with the present form of government,\r\nand set a high value on equality and freedom of speech. But when a\r\nnew generation arises and the democracy falls into the hands of the\r\ngrandchildren of its founders, they have become so accustomed to\r\nfreedom and equality that they no longer value them, and begin to aim\r\nat pre-eminence; and it is chiefly those of ample fortune who fall into\r\nthis error. So when they begin to lust for power and cannot attain it\r\nthrough themselves or their own good qualities, they ruin their estates,\r\ntempting and corrupting the people in every possible way. And hence\r\nwhen by their foolish thirst for reputation they have created among the\r\nmasses an appetite for gifts and the habit of receiving them, democracy\r\nin its turn is abolished and changes into a rule of force and violence.\r\nFor the people, having grown accustomed feed at the expense of others\r\nand to depend for their livelihood on the property of others, as soon as\r\nthey find a leader who is enterprising but is excluded from the honors\r\nof office by his poverty, institute the rule of violence; and now\r\nuniting their forces massacre, banish, and plunder, until they\r\ndegenerate again into perfect savages and find once more a master and\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\nSuch is the cycle of political revolution, the course pointed by nature\r\nin which constitutions change, disappear, and finally return to the\r\npoint from which they started. Anyone who clearly perceives this may\r\nindeed in speaking of the future of any state be wrong in his estimate\r\nof the time the process will take, but if his judgment is not tainted by\r\nanimosity or jealousy, he will very seldom be mistaken to the stage of\r\ngrowth or decline it has reached, and as to the form into which it will\r\nchange. And especially in the case of the Roman state will this method\r\nenable us to arrive at a knowledge of its formation, growth, and\r\ngreatest perfection, and likewise of the change for the worse which is\r\nsure follow some day. For, as I said, this state, more than any other,\r\nhas been formed and has grown naturally, and will undergo a natural\r\ndecline and change to its contrary. The reader will be able to judge of\r\nthe truth of this from the subsequent parts this work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern reader may think that all this is irrelevant to him, that the\r\nnatural sciences will solve all his problems. He would be wise to recall\r\nthat the great Roman republic in which Polybius lived more than 2200\r\nyears ago, did indeed become transformed into tyranny and, in the end,\r\ninto anarchy and oblivion. No wonder that the makers of the American\r\nconstitution keenly studied Polybius. Not only has Taine's comments and\r\nfactual description of the cyclic French political history much to teach\r\nus about ourselves and the dangers which lie ahead, but it also shows us\r\nthe origins and weakness of our political theories. It is obvious that\r\nshould ask ourselves the question of where, in the political evolution\r\nwe are now? Are we still ruled by the corrupt oligarchs or have we\r\nreached the stage where the people has become used to be fed on the\r\nproperty of others? If so dissolution and anarchy is just around the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\"The Revolution, Vol. II, 8th ed.\r\n\r\nSvend Rom. Hendaye, France. February 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE:\r\n\r\nIn this volume, as in those preceding it and in those to come, there\r\nwill be found only the history of Public Authorities. Others will write\r\nthat of diplomacy, of war, of the finances, of the Church; my subject\r\nis a limited one. To my great regret, however, this new part fills an\r\nentire volume; and the last part, on the revolutionary government, will\r\nbe as long.\r\n\r\nI have again to regret the dissatisfaction I foresee this work will\r\ncause to many of my countrymen. My excuse is, that almost all of them,\r\nmore fortunate than myself, have political principles which serve them\r\nin forming their judgments of the past. I had none; if indeed, I had\r\nany motive in undertaking this work, it was to seek for political\r\nprinciples. Thus far I have attained to scarcely more than one; and this\r\nis so simple that will seem puerile, and that I hardly dare express it.\r\nNevertheless I have adhered to it, and in what the reader is about to\r\nperuse my judgments are all derived from that; its truth is the measure\r\nof theirs. It consists wholly in this observation: that\r\n\r\n     HUMAN SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY A MODERN SOCIETY, IS A VAST AND\r\n     COMPLICATED THING.\r\n\r\nHence the difficulty in knowing and comprehending it. For the same\r\nreason it is not easy to handle the subject well. It follows that a\r\ncultivated mind is much better able to do this than an uncultivated\r\nmind, and a man specially qualified than one who is not. From these two\r\nlast truths flow many other consequences, which, if the reader deigns to\r\nreflect on them, he will have no trouble in defining.\r\n\r\nParis 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 0001: Page XLVI of the Introduction to the Edition by Robert\r\nLafont in 1986 by \"Les Origines de la France Contemporaine\".]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 0002: From \"HISTORIES\", BOOK VI. 3. 3-4. 1 FROM LOEB'S\r\nCLASSICAL LIBRARY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT REGIME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE BY THE AUTHOR: ON POLITICAL IGNORANCE AND WISDOM.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, being twenty-one years of age, and an elector, I was very\r\nmuch puzzled, for I had to nominate fifteen or twenty deputies, and,\r\nmoreover, according to French custom, I had not only to determine what\r\ncandidate I would vote for, but what theory I should adopt. I had to\r\nchoose between a royalist or a republican, a democrat or a conservative,\r\na socialist or a bonapartist; as I was neither one nor the other, nor\r\neven anything, I often envied those around me who were so fortunate\r\nas to have arrived at definite conclusions. After listening to various\r\ndoctrines, I acknowledged that there undoubtedly was something wrong\r\nwith my head. The motives that influenced others did not influence me; I\r\ncould not comprehend how, in political matters, a man could be governed\r\nby preferences. My assertive countrymen planned a constitution just like\r\na house, according to the latest, simplest, and most attractive plan;\r\nand there were several under consideration--the mansion of a marquis,\r\nthe house of a common citizen, the tenement of a laborer, the barracks\r\nof a soldier, the kibbutz of a socialist, and even the camp of savages.\r\nEach claimed that his was \"the true habitation for Man, the only one\r\nin which a sensible person could live.\" In my opinion, the argument was\r\nweak; personal taste could not be valid for everyone. It seemed to me\r\nthat a house should not be built for the architect alone, or for itself,\r\nbut for the owner who was to live in it. Referring to the owner for his\r\nadvice, that is submitting to the French people the plans of its future\r\nhabitation, would evidently be either for show or just to deceive them;\r\nsince the question, obviously, was put in such a manner that it provided\r\nthe answer in advance. Besides, had the people been allowed to reply\r\nin all liberty, their response was in any case not of much value since\r\nFrance was scarcely more competent than I was; the combined ignorance of\r\nten millions is not the equivalent of one man's wisdom. A people may be\r\nconsulted and, in an extreme case, may declare what form of government\r\nit would like best, but not that which it most needs. Nothing but\r\nexperience can determine this; it must have time to ascertain whether\r\nthe political structure is convenient, substantial, able to withstand\r\ninclemency, and adapted to customs, habits, occupations, characters,\r\npeculiarities and caprices. For example, the one we have tried has never\r\nsatisfied us; we have during eighty years demolished it thirteen times,\r\neach time setting it up anew, and always in vain, for never have we\r\nfound one that suited us. If other nations have been more fortunate, or\r\nif various political structures abroad have proved stable and enduring,\r\nit is because these have been erected in a special way. Founded on some\r\nprimitive, massive pile, supported by an old central edifice, often\r\nrestored but always preserved, gradually enlarged, and, after numerous\r\ntrials and additions, they have been adapted to the wants of its\r\noccupants. It is well to admit, perhaps, that there is no other way\r\nof erecting a permanent building. Never has one been put up\r\ninstantaneously, after an entirely new design, and according to the\r\nmeasurements of pure Reason. A sudden contrivance of a new, suitable,\r\nand enduring constitution is an enterprise beyond the forces of the\r\nhuman mind.\r\n\r\nIn any event, I came to the conclusion that if we should ever discover\r\nthe one we need it would not be through some fashionable theory. The\r\npoint is, if it exists, to discover it, and not to put it to a vote. To\r\ndo that would not only be pretentious it would be useless; history and\r\nnature will do it for us; it is for us to adapt ourselves to them, as\r\nit is certain they will not accommodate themselves to us. The social and\r\npolitical mold, into which a nation may enter and remain, is not\r\nsubject to its will, but determined by its character and its past. It\r\nis essential that, even in its least traits, it should be shaped on the\r\nliving material to which it is applied; otherwise it will burst and fall\r\nto pieces. Hence, if we should succeed in finding ours, it will only be\r\nthrough a study of ourselves, while the more we understand exactly what\r\nwe are, the more certainly shall we distinguish what best suits us.\r\nWe ought, therefore, to reverse the ordinary methods, and form some\r\nconception of the nation before formulating its constitution. Doubtless\r\nthe first operation is much more tedious and difficult than the second.\r\nHow much time, how much study, how many observations rectified one by\r\nthe other, how many researches in the past and the present, over all\r\nthe domains of thought and of action, what manifold and age-long labors\r\nbefore we can obtain an accurate and complete idea of a great people. A\r\npeople which has lived a people's age, and which still lives! But it is\r\nthe only way to avoid the unsound construction based on a meaningless\r\nplanning. I promised myself that, for my own part, if I should some day\r\nundertake to form a political opinion, it would be only after having\r\nstudied France.\r\n\r\nWhat is contemporary France? To answer this question we must know how\r\nthis France is formed, or, what is still better, to act as spectator at\r\nits formation. At the end of the last century (in 1789), like a molting\r\ninsect, it underwent a metamorphosis. Its ancient organization is\r\ndissolved; it tears away its most precious tissues and falls into\r\nconvulsions, which seem mortal. Then, after multiplied throes and a\r\npainful lethargy, it re-establishes itself. But its organization is no\r\nlonger the same: by silent interior travail a new being is substituted\r\nfor the old. In 1808, its leading characteristics are decreed and\r\ndefined: departments, arondissements, cantons and communes, no change\r\nhave since taken place in its exterior divisions and functions.\r\nConcordat, Code, Tribunals, University, Institute, Prefects, Council of\r\nState, Taxes, Collectors, Cours des Comptes, a uniform and centralized\r\nadministration, its principal organs, are still the same. Nobility,\r\ncommoners, artisans, peasants, each class has henceforth the position,\r\nthe sentiments, the traditions which we see at the present day (1875).\r\nThus the new creature is at once stable and complete; consequently its\r\nstructure, its instincts and its faculties mark in advance the circle\r\nwithin which its thought and its action will be stimulated. Around\r\nit, other nations, some more advanced, others less developed, all\r\nwith greater caution, some with better results, attempt similarly a\r\ntransformation from a feudal to a modern state; the process takes place\r\neverywhere and all but simultaneously. But, under this new system as\r\nbeneath the ancient, the weak is always the prey of the strong. Woe to\r\nthose (nations) whose retarded evolution exposes them to the neighbor\r\nsuddenly emancipated from his chrysalis state, and is the first to go\r\nforth fully armed! Woe likewise to him whose too violent and too abrupt\r\nevolution has badly balanced his internal economy. Who, through the\r\nexaggeration of his governing forces, through the deterioration of his\r\ndeep-seated organs, through the gradual impoverishment of his vital\r\ntissues is condemned to commit inconsiderate acts, to debility,\r\nto impotency, amidst sounder and better-balanced neighbors! In the\r\norganization, which France effected for herself at the beginning of the\r\n(19th) century, all the general lines of her contemporary history were\r\ntraced. Her political revolutions, social Utopias, division of classes,\r\nrole of the church, conduct of the nobility, of the middle class, and of\r\nthe people, the development, the direction, or deviation of philosophy,\r\nof letters and of the arts. That is why, should we wish to understand\r\nour present condition our attention always reverts to the terrible and\r\nfruitful crisis by which the ancient regime produced the Revolution, and\r\nthe Revolution the new regime.\r\n\r\nAncient régime, Revolution, new régime, I am going to try to describe\r\nthese three conditions with exactitude. I have no other object in\r\nview. A historian may be allowed the privilege of a naturalist; I\r\nhave regarded my subject the same as the metamorphosis of an insect.\r\nMoreover, the event is so interesting in itself that it is worth the\r\ntrouble of being observed for its own sake, and no effort is required\r\nto suppress one's ulterior motives. Freed from all prejudice, curiosity\r\nbecomes scientific and may be completely concentrated on the secret\r\nforces, which guide the wonderful process. These forces are the\r\nsituation, the passions, the ideas, the wills of each group of actors,\r\nand which can be defined and almost measured. They are in full view; we\r\nare not reduced to conjectures about them, to uncertain divination,\r\nto vague indications. By singular good fortune we perceive the men\r\nthemselves, their exterior and their interior. The Frenchmen of the\r\nancient régime are still within visual range. All of us, in our youth,\r\n(around 1840-50), have encountered one or more of the survivors of this\r\nvanished society. Many of their dwellings, with the furniture, still\r\nremain intact. Their pictures and engravings enable us to take part in\r\ntheir domestic life, see how they dress, observe their attitudes and\r\nfollow their movements. Through their literature, philosophy, scientific\r\npursuits, gazettes, and correspondence, we can reproduce their feeling\r\nand thought, and even enjoy their familiar conversation. The multitude\r\nof memoirs, issuing during the past thirty years from public and private\r\narchives, lead us from one drawing room to another, as if we bore with\r\nus so many letters of introduction. The independent descriptions by\r\nforeign travelers, in their journals and correspondence, correct\r\nand complete the portraits, which this society has traced of itself.\r\nEverything that it could state has been stated, except,\r\n\r\n* what was commonplace and well-known to contemporaries,\r\n\r\n* whatever seemed technical, tedious and vulgar,\r\n\r\n* whatever related to the provinces, to the bourgeoisie, the peasant, to\r\nthe laboring man, to the government, and to the household.\r\n\r\nIt has been my aim to fill this void, and make France known to others\r\noutside the small circle of the literary and the cultivated. Owing\r\nto the kindness of M. Maury[0011] and the precious indications of M.\r\nBoutaric, I have been able to examine a mass of manuscript documents.\r\nThese include the correspondence of a large number of intendants, (the\r\nRoyal governor of a large district), the directors of customs and tax\r\noffices, legal officers, and private persons of every kind and of every\r\ndegree during the thirty last years of the ancient regime. Also included\r\nare the reports and registers of the various departments of the royal\r\nhousehold, the reports and registers of the States General in 176\r\nvolumes, the dispatches of military officers in 1789 and 1790, letters,\r\nmemoirs and detailed statistics preserved in the one hundred boxes of\r\nthe ecclesiastical committee, the correspondence, in 94 bundles, of the\r\ndepartment and municipal authorities with the ministries from 1790 to\r\n1799, the reports of the Councilors of State on their mission at the end of\r\n1801, the reports of prefects under the Consulate, the Empire, and\r\nthe Restoration down to 1823. There is such a quantity of unknown and\r\ninstructive documents besides these that the history of the Revolution\r\nseems, indeed, to be still unwritten. In any event, it is only such\r\ndocuments, which can make all these people come alive. The lesser\r\nnobles, the curates, the monks, the nuns of the provinces, the aldermen\r\nand bourgeoisie of the towns, the attorneys and syndics of the country\r\nvillages, the laborers and artisans, the officers and the soldiers.\r\nThese alone enable us to contemplate and appreciate in detail the\r\nvarious conditions of their existence, the interior of a parsonage, of\r\na convent, of a town-council, the wages of a workman, the produce of a\r\nfarm, the taxes levied on a peasant, the duties of a tax-collector, the\r\nexpenditure of a noble or prelate, the budget, retinue and ceremonial of\r\na court. Thanks to such resources, we are able to give precise figures,\r\nto know hour by hour the occupations of a day and, better still, read\r\noff the bill of fare of a grand dinner, and recompose all parts of\r\na full-dress costume. We have even, on the one hand, samples of the\r\nmaterials of the dresses worn by Marie Antoinette, pinned on paper and\r\nclassified by dates. And on the other hand, we can tell what clothes\r\nwere worn by the peasant, describe the bread he ate, specify the\r\nflour it was made of, and state the cost of a pound of it in sous and\r\ndeniers.[0012] With such resources one becomes almost contemporary with\r\nthe men whose history one writes and, more than once, in the Archives,\r\nI have, while tracing their old handwriting on the time-stained paper\r\nbefore me, been tempted to speak aloud with them.\r\n\r\nH. A. Taine, August 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 0011: Taine's friend who was the director of the French\r\nNational Archives.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE ANCIENT SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE ORIGIN OF PRIVILEGES.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 three classes of persons, the Clergy, the Nobles and the\r\nKing, occupied the most prominent position in the State with all the\r\nadvantages pertaining thereto namely, authority, property, honors,\r\nor, at the very least, privileges, immunities, favors, pensions,\r\npreferences, and the like. If they occupied this position for so long a\r\ntime, it is because for so long a time they had deserved it. They had,\r\nin short, through an immense and secular effort, constructed by degrees\r\nthe three principal foundations of modern society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Services and Recompenses of the Clergy.\r\n\r\nOf these three layered foundations the most ancient and deepest was the\r\nwork of the clergy. For twelve hundred years and more they had labored\r\nupon it, both as architects and workmen, at first alone and then\r\nalmost alone.--In the beginning, during the first four centuries, they\r\nconstituted religion and the church. Let us ponder over these two words;\r\nin order to weigh them well. On the one hand, in a society founded on\r\nconquest, hard and cold like a machine of brass, forced by its very\r\nstructure to destroy among its subjects all courage to act and all\r\ndesire to live, they had proclaimed the \"glad tidings,\" held forth the\r\n\"kingdom of God,\" preached loving resignation in the hands of a Heavenly\r\nFather, inspired patience, gentleness, humility, self-abnegation, and\r\ncharity, and opened the only issues by which Man stifling in the Roman\r\n'ergastulum' could again breathe and see daylight: and here we\r\nhave religion. On the other hand, in a State gradually undergoing\r\ndepopulation, crumbling away, and fatally becoming a prey, they had\r\nformed a living society governed by laws and discipline, rallying around\r\na common aim and a common doctrine, sustained by the devotion of chiefs\r\nand by the obedience of believes, alone capable of subsisting beneath\r\nthe flood of barbarians which the empire in ruin suffered to pour in\r\nthrough its breaches: and here we have the church.--It continues to\r\nbuild on these two first foundations, and after the invasion, for over\r\nfive hundred years, it saves what it can still save of human culture.\r\nIt marches in the van of the barbarians or converts them directly after\r\ntheir entrance, which is a wonderful advantage. Let us judge of it by\r\na single fact: In Great Britain, which like Gaul had become Latin, but\r\nwhereof the conquerors remain pagan during a century and a half, arts,\r\nindustries, society, language, all were destroyed; nothing remained\r\nof an entire people, either massacred or fugitive, but slaves. We have\r\nstill to divine their traces; reduced to the condition of beasts of\r\nburden, they disappear from history. Such might have been the fate of\r\nEurope if the clergy had not promptly tamed the fierce brutes to which\r\nit belonged.\r\n\r\nBefore the bishop in his gilded cope or before the monk, the converted\r\nGerman \"emaciated, clad in skins,\" wan, \"dirtier and more spotted than a\r\nchameleon,\"[1101] stood fear-stricken as before a sorcerer. In his\r\ncalm moments, after the chase or inebriety, the vague divination of\r\na mysterious and grandiose future, the dim conception of an unknown\r\ntribunal, the rudiment of conscience which he already had in his forests\r\nbeyond the Rhine, arouses in him through sudden alarms half-formed,\r\nmenacing visions. At the moment of violating a sanctuary he asks himself\r\nwhether he may not fall on its threshold with vertigo and a broken\r\nneck.[1102] Convicted through his own perplexity, he stops and spares\r\nthe farm, the village, and the town, which live under the priest's\r\nprotection. If the animal impulse of rage, or of primitive lusts, leads\r\nhim to murder or to rob, later, after satiety, in times of sickness or\r\nof misfortune, taking the advice of his concubine or of his wife, he\r\nrepents and makes restitution twofold, tenfold, a hundredfold, unstinted\r\nin his gifts and immunities.[1103] Thus, over the whole territory the\r\nclergy maintain and enlarge their asylums for the oppressed and the\r\nvanquished.--On the other hand, among the warrior chiefs with long hair,\r\nby the side of kings clad in furs, the mitered bishop and abbot, with\r\nshaven brows, take seats in the assemblies; they alone know how to use\r\nthe pen and how to discuss. Secretaries, councilors, theologians, they\r\nparticipate in all edicts; they have their hand in the government;\r\nthey strive through its agency to bring a little order out of\r\nimmense disorder; to render the law more rational and more humane, to\r\nre-establish or preserve piety, instruction, justice, property, and\r\nespecially marriage. To their ascendancy is certainly due the police\r\nsystem, such as it was, intermittent and incomplete, which prevented\r\nEurope from falling into a Mongolian anarchy. If, down to the end of\r\nthe twelfth century, the clergy bears heavily on the princes, it is\r\nespecially to repress in them and beneath them the brutal appetites,\r\nthe rebellions of flesh and blood, the outbursts and relapses\r\nof irresistible ferocity which are undermining the social\r\nfabric.--Meanwhile, in its churches and in its convents, it preserves\r\nthe ancient acquisitions of humanity, the Latin tongue, Christian\r\nliterature and theology, a portion of pagan literature and science,\r\narchitecture, sculpture, painting, the arts and industries which aid\r\nworship. It also preserved the more valuable industries, which provide\r\nman with bread, clothing, and shelter, and especially the greatest of\r\nall human acquisitions, and the most opposed to the vagabond humor of\r\nthe idle and plundering barbarian, the habit and taste for labor. In the\r\ndistricts depopulated through Roman exactions, through the revolt of\r\nthe Bagaudes, through the invasion of the Germans, and the raids of\r\nbrigands, the Benedictine monk built his cabin of boughs amid briers and\r\nbrambles.[1104] Large areas around him, formerly cultivated, are nothing\r\nbut abandoned thickets. Along with his associates he clears the ground\r\nand erects buildings; he domesticates half-tamed animals, he establishes\r\na farm, a mill, a forge, an oven, and shops for shoes and clothing.\r\nAccording to the rules of his order, he reads daily for two hours. He\r\ngives seven hours to manual labor, and he neither eats nor drinks more\r\nthan is absolutely essential. Through his intelligent, voluntary labor,\r\nconscientiously performed and with a view to the future, he produces\r\nmore than the layman does. Through his temperate, judicious, economical\r\nsystem he consumes less than the layman does. Hence it is that where\r\nthe layman had failed he sustains himself and even prospers.[1105] He\r\nwelcomes the unfortunate, feeds them, sets them to work, and unites them\r\nin matrimony; and beggars, vagabonds, and fugitive peasants gather around\r\nthe sanctuary. Their camp gradually becomes a village and next a small\r\ntown; man plows as soon as he can be sure of his crops, and becomes the\r\nfather of a family as soon as he considers himself able to provide for\r\nhis offspring. In this way new centers of agriculture and industry are\r\nformed, which likewise become new centers of population.[1106]\r\n\r\nTo food for the body add food for the soul, not less essential. For,\r\nalong with nourishment, it was still necessary to furnish Man with\r\ninducements to live, or, at the very least, with the resignation that\r\nmakes life endurable, and also with the poetic daydreams taking the\r\nplace of missing happiness.[1107] Down to the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury the clergy stands almost alone in furnishing this. Through\r\nits innumerable legends of saints, through its cathedrals and their\r\nconstruction, through its statues and their expression, through its\r\nservices and their still transparent meaning, it rendered visible \"the\r\nkingdom of God.\" It finally sets up an ideal world at the end of the\r\npresent one, like a magnificent golden pavilion at the end of a miry\r\nmorass.[1108] The saddened heart, athirst for tenderness and serenity,\r\ntakes refuge in this divine and gentle world. Persecutors there, about\r\nto strike, are arrested by an invisible hand; wild beasts become docile;\r\nthe stags of the forest come of their own accord every morning to draw\r\nthe chariots of the saints; the country blooms for them like a new\r\nParadise; they die only when it pleases them. Meanwhile they comfort\r\nmankind; goodness, piety, forgiveness flows from their lips with\r\nineffable sweetness; with eyes upturned to heaven, they see God, and\r\nwithout effort, as in a dream, they ascend into the light and seat\r\nthemselves at His right hand. How divine the legend, how inestimable in\r\nvalue, when, under the universal reign of brute force, to endure this\r\nlife it was necessary to imagine another, and to render the second as\r\nvisible to the spiritual eye as the first was to the physical eye. The\r\nclergy thus nourished men for more than twelve centuries, and in the\r\ngrandeur of its recompense we can estimate the depth of their gratitude.\r\nIts popes, for two hundred years, were the dictators of Europe. It\r\norganized crusades, dethroned monarchs, and distributed kingdoms. Its\r\nbishops and abbots became here, sovereign princes, and there, veritable\r\nfounders of dynasties. It held in its grasp a third of the territory,\r\none-half of the revenue, and two-thirds of the capital of Europe. Let us\r\nnot believe that Man counterfeits gratitude, or that he gives without a\r\nvalid motive; he is too selfish and too envious for that. Whatever may\r\nbe the institution, ecclesiastic or secular, whatever may be the clergy,\r\nBuddhist or Christian, the contemporaries who observe it for forty\r\ngenerations are not bad judges. They surrender to it their will and\r\ntheir possessions, just in proportion to its services, and the excess of\r\ntheir devotion may measure the immensity of its benefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Services and Recompenses of the Nobles.\r\n\r\nUp to this point no aid is found against the power of the sword and\r\nthe battle-ax except in persuasion and in patience. Those States\r\nwhich, imitating the old empire, attempted to rise up into compact\r\norganizations, and to interpose a barrier against constant invasion,\r\nobtained no hold on the shifting soil; after Charlemagne everything\r\nmelts away. There are no more soldiers after the battle of Fontanet;\r\nduring half a century bands of four or five hundred outlaws sweep over\r\nthe country, killing, burning, and devastating with impunity. But, by\r\nway of compensation, the dissolution of the State raises up at this very\r\ntime a military generation. Each petty chieftain has planted his feet\r\nfirmly on the domain he occupies, or which he withholds; he no longer\r\nkeeps it in trust, or for use, but as property, and an inheritance. It\r\nis his own manor, his own village, his own earldom; it no longer belongs\r\nto the king; he contends for it in his own right. The benefactor, the\r\nconservator at this time is the man capable of fighting, of defending\r\nothers, and such really is the character of the newly established class.\r\nThe noble, in the language of the day, is the man of war, the soldier\r\n(miles), and it is he who lays the second foundation of modern society.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century his extraction is of little consequence. He is\r\noftentimes a Carlovingian count, a beneficiary of the king, the sturdy\r\nproprietor of one of the last of the Frank estates. In one place he is\r\na martial bishop or a valiant abbot in another a converted pagan, a\r\nretired bandit, a prosperous adventurer, a rude huntsman, who long\r\nsupported himself by the chase and on wild fruits.[1109] The ancestors\r\nof Robert the Strong are unknown, and later the story runs that the\r\nCapets are descended from a Parisian butcher. In any event the noble of\r\nthat epoch is the brave, the powerful man, expert in the use of arms,\r\nwho, at the head of a troop, instead of flying or paying ransom, offers\r\nhis breast, stands firm, and protects a patch of the soil with his\r\nsword. To perform this service he has no need of ancestors; all that\r\nhe requires is courage, for he is himself an ancestor; security for the\r\npresent, which he insures, is too acceptable to permit any quibbling\r\nabout his title. Finally, after so many centuries, we find each district\r\npossessing its armed men, a settled body of troops capable of resisting\r\nnomadic invasion; the community is no longer a prey to strangers. At the\r\nend of a century this Europe, which had been sacked by the Vikings, is\r\nto throw 200,000 armed men into Asia. Henceforth, both north and south,\r\nin the face of Moslems and of pagans, instead of being conquered it is\r\nto conquer. For the second time an ideal figure becomes apparent\r\nafter that of the saint,[1110] the hero; and the newborn sentiment,\r\nas effective as the old one, thus groups men together into a stable\r\nsociety.--This consists of a resident corps of men-at-arms, in which,\r\nfrom father to son, one is always a soldier. Each individual is born\r\ninto it with his hereditary rank, his local post, his pay in landed\r\nproperty, with the certainty of never being abandoned by his chieftain,\r\nand with the obligation of giving his life for his chieftain in time of\r\nneed. In this epoch of perpetual warfare only one set-up is valid, that\r\nof a body of men confronting the enemy, and such is the feudal system;\r\nwe can judge by this trait alone of the perils which it wards off,\r\nand of the service which it enjoins. \"In those days,\" says the Spanish\r\ngeneral chronicle, \"kings, counts, nobles, and knights, in order to be\r\nready at all hours, kept their horses in the rooms in which they slept\r\nwith their wives.\" The viscount in his tower defending the entrance to a\r\nvalley or the passage of a ford, the marquis thrown as a forlorn hope\r\non the burning frontier, sleeps with his hand on his weapon, like an\r\nAmerican lieutenant among the Sioux behind a western stockade. His\r\ndwelling is simply a camp and a refuge. Straw and heaps of leaves cover\r\nthe pavement of the great hall, here he rests with his troopers, taking\r\noff a spur if he has a chance to sleep. The loopholes in the wall\r\nscarcely allow daylight to enter; the main thing is not to be shot\r\nwith arrows. Every taste, every sentiment is subordinated to military\r\nservice; there are certain places on the European frontier where a child\r\nof fourteen is required to march, and where the widow up to sixty is\r\nrequired to remarry. Men to fill up the ranks, men to mount guard, is\r\nthe call, which at this moment issues from all institutions like the\r\nsummons of a brazen horn.--Thanks to these braves, the peasant(villanus)\r\nenjoys protection. He is no longer to be slaughtered, no longer to be\r\nled captive with his family, in herds, with his neck in the yoke. He\r\nventures to plow and to sow, and to rely upon his crops; in case of\r\ndanger he knows that he can find an asylum for himself, and for\r\nhis grain and cattle, in the circle of palisades at the base of the\r\nfortress. By degrees necessity establishes a tacit contract between\r\nthe military chieftain of the donjon and the early settlers of the\r\nopen country, and this becomes a recognized custom. They work for him,\r\ncultivate his ground, do his carting, pay him quittances, so much for\r\nhouse, so much per head for cattle, so much to inherit or to sell; he is\r\ncompelled to support his troop. But when these rights are discharged he\r\nerrs if, through pride or greed, he takes more than his due.--As to the\r\nvagabonds, the wretched, who, in the universal disorder and devastation,\r\nseek refuge under his guardianship, their condition is harder. The soil\r\nbelongs to the lord because without him it would be uninhabitable. If\r\nhe assigns them a plot of ground, if he permits them merely to encamp\r\non it, if he sets them to work or furnishes them with seeds it is on\r\nconditions, which he prescribes. They are to become his serfs, subject\r\nto the laws on mainmorte.[1111] Wherever they may go he is to have\r\nthe right of fetching them back. From father to son they are his born\r\ndomestics, applicable to any pursuit he pleases, taxable and workable\r\nat his discretion. They are not allowed to transmit anything to a child\r\nunless the latter, \"living from their pot,\" can, after their death,\r\ncontinue their service. \"Not to be killed,\" says Stendhal, \"and to\r\nhave a good sheepskin coat in winter, was, for many people in the tenth\r\ncentury, the height of felicity\"; let us add, for a woman, that of not\r\nbeing violated by a whole band. When we clearly represent to ourselves\r\nthe condition of humanity in those days, we can comprehend how men\r\nreadily accepted the most obnoxious of feudal rights, even that of the\r\ndroit du seigneur. The risks to which they were daily exposed were even\r\nworse.[1112] The proof of it is that the people flocked to the feudal\r\nstructure as soon as it was completed. In Normandy, for instance, when\r\nRollo had divided off the lands with a line, and hung the robbers,\r\nthe inhabitants of the neighboring provinces rushed in to establish\r\nthemselves. The slightest security sufficed to repopulate a country.\r\n\r\nPeople accordingly lived, or rather began to live once more, under the\r\nrude, iron-gloved hand which used them roughly, but which afforded\r\nthem protection. The seignior, sovereign and proprietor, maintains for\r\nhimself under this double title, the moors, the river, the forest, all\r\nthe game. It is no great evil, since the country is nearly a desert,\r\nand he devotes his leisure to exterminating large wild beasts. He alone\r\npossessed the resources. He is the only one that is able to construct\r\nthe mill, the oven, and the winepress; to establish the ferry, the\r\nbridge, or the highway, to dike in a marsh, and to raise or purchase a\r\nbull. To indemnify himself he taxes for these, or forces their use. If\r\nhe is intelligent and a good manager of men, if he seeks to derive the\r\ngreatest profit from his ground, he gradually relaxes, or allows to\r\nbecome relaxed, the meshes of the net in which his peasants and serfs\r\nwork unprofitably because they are too tightly drawn. Habits, necessity,\r\na voluntary or forced conformity, have their effect. Lords, peasants,\r\nserfs, and bourgeois, in the end adapted to their condition, bound\r\ntogether by a common interest, form together a society, a veritable\r\ncorporation. The seigniory, the county, the duchy becomes a patrimony\r\nwhich is loved through a blind instinct, and to which all are devoted.\r\nIt is confounded with the seignior and his family; in this relation\r\npeople are proud of him. They narrate his feats of arms; they cheer\r\nhim as his cavalcade passes along the street; they rejoice in his\r\nmagnificence through sympathy.[1113] If he becomes a widower and has\r\nno children, they send deputations to him to entreat him to remarry,\r\nin order that at his death the country may not fall into a war of\r\nsuccession or be given up to the encroachment of neighbors. Thus there\r\nis a revival, after a thousand years, of the most powerful and the most\r\nvivacious of the sentiments that support human society. This one is\r\nthe more precious because it is capable of expanding. In order that the\r\nsmall feudal patrimony to become the great national patrimony, it now\r\nsuffices for the seigniories to be combined in the hands of a single\r\nlord, and that the king, chief of the nobles, should overlay the work of\r\nthe nobles with the third foundation of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Services and Recompenses of the King.\r\n\r\nKings built the whole of this foundation, one stone after another.\r\nHugues Capet laid the first one. Before him royalty conferred on the\r\nKing no right to a province, not even Laon; it is he who added his\r\ndomain to the title. During eight hundred years, through conquest,\r\ncraft, inheritance, the work of acquisition goes on; even under Louis XV\r\nFrance is augmented by the acquisition of Lorraine and Corsica. Starting\r\nfrom nothing, the King is the maker of a compact State, containing\r\nthe population of twenty-six millions, and then the most powerful in\r\nEurope.--Throughout this interval he is at the head of the national\r\ndefense. He is the liberator of the country against foreigners,\r\nagainst the Pope in the fourteenth century, against the English in the\r\nfifteenth, against the Spaniards in the sixteenth. In the interior, from\r\nthe twelfth century onward, with the helmet on his brow, and always\r\non the road, he is the great justiciary, demolishing the towers of the\r\nfeudal brigands, repressing the excesses of the powerful, and protecting\r\nthe oppressed.[1114] He puts an end to private warfare; he establishes\r\norder and tranquility. This was an immense accomplishment, which,\r\nfrom Louis le Gros to St. Louis, from Philippe le Bel to Charles VII,\r\ncontinues uninterruptedly up to the middle of the eighteenth century in\r\nthe edict against duels and in the \"Grand Jours.\"[1115] Meanwhile all\r\nuseful projects carried out under his orders, or developed under his\r\npatronage, roads, harbors, canals, asylums, universities, academies,\r\ninstitutions of piety, of refuge, of education, of science, of\r\nindustry, and of commerce, bears his imprint and proclaim the public\r\nbenefactor. Services of this character challenge a proportionate\r\nrecompense; it is allowed that from father to son he is wedded to\r\nFrance; that she acts only through him; that he acts only for her;\r\nwhile every souvenir of the past and every present interest combine to\r\nsanction this union. The Church consecrates it at Rheims by a sort\r\nof eighth sacrament, accompanied with legends and miracles; he is the\r\nanointed of God.[1116] The nobles, through an old instinct of military\r\nfealty, consider themselves his bodyguard, and down to August 10, 1789,\r\nrush forward to die for him on his staircase; he is their general by\r\nbirth. The people, down to 1789, regard him as the redresser of abuses,\r\nthe guardian of the right, the protector of the weak, the great almoner\r\nand the universal refuge. At the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI\r\n\"shouts of Vive le roi, which began at six o'clock in the morning,\r\ncontinued scarcely interrupted until after sunset.\"[1117] When the\r\nDauphin was born the joy of France was that of a whole family.\r\n\"People stopped each other in the streets, spoke together without any\r\nacquaintance, and everybody embraced everybody he knew.\"[1118] Every\r\none, through vague tradition, through immemorial respect, feels\r\nthat France is a ship constructed by his hands and the hands of his\r\nancestors. In this sense, the vessel is his property; it is his right\r\nto it is the same as that of each passenger to his private goods. The\r\nking's only duty consists in being expert and vigilant in guiding\r\nacross the oceans and beneath his banner the magnificent ship upon which\r\neveryone's welfare depends. Under the ascendancy of such an idea he was\r\nallowed to do everything. By fair means or foul, he so reduced ancient\r\nauthorities as to make them a fragment, a pretense, a souvenir. The\r\nnobles are simply his officials or his courtiers. Since the Concordat\r\nhe nominates the dignitaries of the Church. The States-General were\r\nnot convoked for a hundred and seventy-five years; the provincial\r\nassemblies, which continue to subsist, do nothing but apportion the\r\ntaxes; the parliaments are exiled when they risk a remonstrance. Through\r\nhis council, his intendants, his sub-delegates, he intervenes in\r\nthe most trifling of local matters. His revenue is four hundred and\r\nseventy-seven millions.[1119] He disburses one-half of that of\r\nthe Clergy. In short, he is absolute master, and he so declares\r\nhimself.[1120]--Possessions, freedom from taxation, the satisfactions\r\nof vanity, a few remnants of local jurisdiction and authority, are\r\nconsequently all that is left to his ancient rivals; in exchange for\r\nthese they enjoy his favors and marks of preference. Such, in brief, is\r\nthe history of the privileged classes, the Clergy, the Nobles, and\r\nthe King. It must be kept in mind to comprehend their situation at the\r\nmoment of their fall; having created France, they enjoy it. Let us see\r\nclearly what becomes of them at the end of the eighteenth century; what\r\nportion of their advantages they preserved; what services they still\r\nrender, and what services they do not render.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1101: \"Les Moines d'Occident,\" by Montalembert, I. 277.

THE PRIVILEGED CLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Number of the Privileged Classes.\r\n\r\nThe privileged classes number about 270,000 persons, comprising of\r\nthe nobility, 140,000 and of the clergy 130,000.[1201] This makes from\r\n25,000 to 30,000 noble families; 23,000 monks in 2,500 monasteries, and\r\n37,000 nuns in 1,500 convents, and 60,000 curates and vicars in as\r\nmany churches and chapels. Should the reader desire a more distinct\r\nimpression of them, he may imagine on each square league of\r\nterritory[1202], and to each thousand of inhabitants, one noble family\r\nin its weathercock mansion. In each village there is a curate and his\r\nchurch, and, every six or seven leagues, a community of men or of\r\nwomen. We have here the ancient chieftains and founders of France; thus\r\nentitled, they still enjoy many possessions and many rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Their Possessions, Capital, and Revenue.\r\n\r\nLet us always keep in mind what they were, in order to comprehend what\r\nthey are. Great as their advantages may be, these are merely the remains\r\nof still greater advantages. This or that bishop or abbot, this or\r\nthat count or duke, whose successors make their bows at Versailles, was\r\nformerly the equals of the Carlovingians and the first Capets. A Sire de\r\nMontlhéry held King Philippe I in check.[1203] The abbey of St. Germain\r\ndes Prés possessed 430,000 hectares of land (about 900,000 acres),\r\nalmost the extent of an entire department. We need not be surprised that\r\nthey remained powerful, and, especially, rich; no stability is greater\r\nthan that of an associative body. After eight hundred years, in spite\r\nof so many strokes of the royal ax, and the immense change in the\r\nculture of society, the old feudal root lasts and still vegetates. We\r\nremark it first in the distribution of property.[1204] A fifth of the\r\nsoil belongs to the crown and the communes, a fifth to the Third-Estate,\r\na fifth to the rural population, a fifth to the nobles and a fifth to\r\nthe clergy. Accordingly, if we deduct the public lands, the privileged\r\nclasses own one-half of the kingdom. This large portion, moreover, is\r\nat the same time the richest, for it comprises almost all the large and\r\nimposing buildings, the palaces, castles, convents, and cathedrals,\r\nand almost all the valuable movable property, such as furniture, plate,\r\nobjects of art, the accumulated masterpieces of centuries.--We can\r\njudge of it by an estimate of the portion belonging to the clergy. Its\r\npossessions, capitalized, amount to nearly 4,000,000,000 francs.[1205]\r\nIncome from this amounts to 80 or 100 millions. To this must be added\r\nthe dime (or tithes), 123 millions per annum, in all 200 millions, a sum\r\nwhich must be doubled to show its equivalent at the present day. We\r\nmust also add the chance contributions and the usual church\r\ncollections.[1206] To fully realize the breadth of this golden stream\r\nlet us look at some of its affluents. 399 monks at Prémontré estimate\r\ntheir revenue at more than 1,000,000 livres, and their capital at\r\n45,000,000. The Provincial of the Dominicans of Toulouse admits, for his\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-six monks, \"more than 200,000 livres net revenue,\r\nnot including the convent and its enclosure; also, in the colonies,\r\nreal estate, Negroes and other effects, valued at several millions.\"\r\nThe Benedictines of Cluny, numbering 298, enjoy an income of 1,800,000\r\nlivres. Those of Saint-Maur, numbering 1672, estimate the movable\r\nproperty of their churches and houses at 24,000,000, and their net\r\nrevenue at 8 millions, \"without including that which accrues to\r\nMessieurs the abbots and priors commendatory,\" which means as much\r\nand perhaps more. Dom Rocourt, abbot of Clairvaux, has from 300,000 to\r\n400,000 livres income; the Cardinal de Rohan, archbishop of Strasbourg,\r\nmore than 1,000,000.[1207] In Franche-Comté, Alsace and Roussillon\r\nthe clergy own one-half of the territory, in Hainaut and Artois,\r\nthree-quarters, in Cambrésis fourteen hundred plow-areas out of\r\nseventeen hundred.[1208] Almost the whole of Le Velay belongs to\r\nthe Bishop of Puy, the abbot of La Chaise-Dieu, the noble chapter of\r\nBrionde, and to the seigniors of Polignac. The canons of St. Claude, in\r\nthe Jura, are the proprietors of 12,000 serfs or 'mainmorts.'[1209]\r\nThrough fortunes of the first class we can imagine those of the second.\r\nAs along with the noble it comprises the ennobled. As the magistrates\r\nfor two centuries, and the financiers for one century had acquired or\r\npurchased nobility, it is clear that here are to be found almost all the\r\ngreat fortunes of France, old or new, transmitted by inheritance,\r\nobtained through court favors, or acquired in business. When a class\r\nreaches the summit it is recruited out of those who are mounting or\r\nclambering up. Here, too, there is colossal wealth. It has been\r\ncalculated that the possessions of the princes of the royal family, the\r\nComtés of Artois and of Provence, the Ducs d'Orléans and de Penthiévre\r\nthen covered one-seventh of the territory.[1210] The princes of the\r\nblood have together a revenue of from 24 to 25 millions; the Duc\r\nd'Orléans alone has a rental of 11,500,000.[1211]--These are the\r\nvestiges of the feudal régime. Similar vestiges are found in England, in\r\nAustria, in Germany and in Russia. Proprietorship, indeed, survives a\r\nlong time survives the circumstances on which it is founded. Sovereignty\r\nhad constituted property; divorced from sovereignty it has remained in\r\nthe hands formerly sovereign. In the bishop, the abbot and the count,\r\nthe king respected the proprietor while overthrowing the rival, and, in\r\nthe existing proprietor a hundred traits still indicate the annihilated\r\nor modified sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Their Immunities.\r\n\r\nSuch is the total or partial exemption from taxation. The tax-collectors\r\nhalt in their presence because the king well knows that feudal property\r\nhas the same origin as his own; if royalty is one privilege seigniory\r\nis another; the king himself is simply the most privileged among the\r\nprivileged. The most absolute, the most infatuated with his rights,\r\nLouis XIV, entertained scruples when extreme necessity compelled him to\r\nenforce on everybody the tax of the tenth.[1212] Treaties, precedents,\r\nimmemorial custom, reminiscences of ancient rights again restrain\r\nthe fiscal hand. The clearer the resemblance of the proprietor to the\r\nancient independent sovereign the greater his immunity.--In some places\r\na recent treaty guarantees him by his position as a stranger, by his\r\nalmost royal extraction. \"In Alsace foreign princes in possession, with\r\nthe Teutonic order and the order of Malta, enjoy exemption from all real\r\nand personal contributions.\" \"In Lorraine the chapter of Remiremont\r\nhas the privilege of assessing itself in all state impositions.\"[1213]\r\nElsewhere he is protected by the maintenance of the provincial\r\nAssemblies, and through the incorporation of the nobility with the\r\nsoil: in Languedoc and in Brittany the commoners alone paid the\r\ntaille[1214]--Everywhere else his quality preserved him from it, him,\r\nhis chateau and the chateau's dependencies; the taille reaches him only\r\nthrough his farmers. And better still, it is sufficient that he himself\r\nshould work, or his steward, to communicate to the land his original\r\nindependence. As soon as he touches the soil, either personally or\r\nthrough his agent, he exempts four plowing-areas (quatre charrues),\r\nthree hundred arpents,[1215] which in other hands would pay 2,000 francs\r\ntax. Besides this he is exempt on \"the woods, the meadows, the vines,\r\nthe ponds and the enclosed land belonging to the chateau, of whatever\r\nextent it may be.\" Consequently, in Limousin and elsewhere, in regions\r\nprincipally devoted to pasturage or to vineyards, he takes care to\r\nmanage himself, or to have managed, a certain portion of his domain; in\r\nthis way he exempts it from the tax collector.[1216] There is yet more.\r\nIn Alsace, through an express covenant he does not pay a cent of tax.\r\nThus, after the assaults of four hundred and fifty years, taxation, the\r\nfirst of fiscal instrumentalities, the most burdensome of all, leaves\r\nfeudal property almost intact.[1217]--For the last century, two new\r\ntools, the capitation-tax and the vingtièmes, appear more effective,\r\nand yet are but little more so.--First of all, through a masterstroke of\r\necclesiastical diplomacy, the clergy diverts or weakens the blow. As it\r\nis an organization, holding assemblies, it is able to negotiate with the\r\nking and buy itself off. To avoid being taxed by others it taxes itself.\r\nIt makes it appear that its payments are not compulsory contributions,\r\nbut a \"free gift.\" It obtains then in exchange a mass of concessions,\r\nis able to diminish this gift, sometimes not to make it, in any event\r\nto reduce it to sixteen millions every five years, that is to say to a\r\nlittle more than three millions per annum. In 1788 it is only 1,800,000\r\nlivres, and in 1789 it is refused altogether.[1218] And still better: as\r\nit borrows to provide for this tax, and as the décimes which it raises\r\non its property do not suffice to reduce the capital and meet the\r\ninterest on its debt, it has the adroitness to secure, besides, a\r\ngrant from the king. Out of the royal treasury, each year, it receives\r\n2,500,000 livres, so that, instead of paying, it receives. In 1787 it\r\nreceives in this way 1,500,000 livres. As for the nobles, they, being\r\nunable to combine together, to have representatives, and to act in a\r\npublic way, operate instead in a private way. They contact ministers,\r\nintendants, sub-delegates, farmer-generals, and all others clothed with\r\nauthority, their quality securing attentions, consideration and favors.\r\nIn the first place, this quality exempts themselves, their dependents,\r\nand the dependents of their dependents, from drafting in the militia,\r\nfrom lodging soldiers, from (la corvée) laboring on the highways. Next,\r\nthe capitation being fixed according to the tax system, they pay little,\r\nbecause their taxation is of little account. Moreover, each one brings\r\nall his credit to bear against assessments. \"Your sympathetic heart,\"\r\nwrites one of them to the intendant, \"will never allow a father of my\r\ncondition to be taxed for the vingtiémes rigidly like a father of low\r\nbirth.\"[1219] On the other hand, as the taxpayer pays the capitation-tax\r\nat his actual residence, often far away from his estates, and no one\r\nhaving any knowledge of his personal income, he may pay whatever seems\r\nto him proper. There are no proceedings against him, if he is a noble;\r\nthe greatest circumspection is used towards persons of high rank. \"In\r\nthe provinces,\" says Turgot, \"the capitation-tax of the privileged\r\nclasses has been successively reduced to an exceedingly small matter,\r\nwhilst the capitation-tax of those who are liable to the taille is\r\nalmost equal to the aggregate of that tax.\" And finally, \"the\r\ncollectors think that they are obliged to act towards them with marked\r\nconsideration\" even when they owe; \"the result of which,\" says\r\nNecker, \"is that very ancient, and much too large amounts, of their\r\ncapitation-tax remain unpaid.\" Accordingly, not having been able to\r\nrepel the assault of the revenue services in front they evaded it or\r\ndiminished it until it became almost unobjectionable. In Champagne, on\r\nnearly 1,500,000 livres provided by the capitation-tax, they paid in\r\nonly 14,000 livres,\" that is to say, \"2 sous and 2 deniers for the\r\nsame purpose which costs 12 sous per livre to those chargeable with the\r\ntaille.\" According to Calonne, \"if concessions and privileges had been\r\nsuppressed the vingtièmes would have furnished double the amount.\"\r\nIn this respect the most opulent were the most skillful in protecting\r\nthemselves. \"With the intendants,\" said the Duc d'Orleans, \"I settle\r\nmatters, and pay about what I please,\" and he calculated that the\r\nprovincial administration, rigorously taxing him, would cause him to\r\nlose 300,000 livres rental. It has been proved that the princes of\r\nthe blood paid, for their two-twentieths, 188,000 instead of 2,400,000\r\nlivres. In the main, in this régime, exception from taxation is the last\r\nremnant of sovereignty or, at least, of independence. The privileged\r\nperson avoids or repels taxation, not merely because it despoils him,\r\nbut because it belittles him; it is a mark of the commoner, that is to\r\nsay, of former servitude, and he resists the fisc (the revenue services)\r\nas much through pride as through interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Their Feudal Rights.\r\n\r\nThese advantages are the remains of primitive sovereignty.\r\n\r\nLet us follow him home to his own domain. A bishop, an abbé, a chapter\r\nof the clergy, an abbess, each has one like a lay seignior; for, in\r\nformer times, the monastery and the church were small governments like\r\nthe county and the duchy.--Intact on the other bank of the Rhine, almost\r\nruined in France, the feudal structure everywhere discloses the same\r\nplan. In certain places, better protected or less attacked, it has\r\npreserved all its ancient externals. At Cahors, the bishop-count of\r\nthe town had the right, on solemnly officiating, \"to place his helmet,\r\ncuirass, gauntlets and sword on the altar.\"[1220] At Besançon, the\r\narchbishop-prince has six high officers, who owe him homage for their\r\nfiefs, and who attend at his coronation and at his obsequies. At\r\nMende,[1221] the bishop, seignior-suzerain for Gévaudan since the\r\neleventh century, appoints \"the courts, ordinary judges and judges of\r\nappeal, the commissaries and syndics of the country.\" He disposes of\r\nall the places, \"municipal and judiciary.\" Entreated to appear in the\r\nassembly of the three orders of the province, he \"replies that his\r\nplace, his possessions and his rank exalting him above every individual\r\nin his diocese. He cannot sit under the presidency of any person; that,\r\nbeing seignior-suzerain of all estates and particularly of the baronies,\r\nhe cannot give way to his vassals.\" In brief that he is king, or but\r\nlittle short of it, in his own province. At Remiremont, the noble\r\nchapter of canonesses has, \"inferior, superior, and ordinary judicature\r\nin fifty-two bans of seigniories,\" nominates seventy-five curacies and\r\nconfers ten male canonships. It appoints the municipal officers of the\r\ntown, and, besides these, three lower and higher courts, and everywhere\r\nthe officials in the jurisdiction over woods and forests. Thirty-two\r\nbishops, without counting the chapters, are thus temporal seigniors, in\r\nwhole or in part, of their episcopal town, sometimes of the surrounding\r\ndistrict, and sometimes, like the bishop of St. Claude, of the entire\r\ncountry. Here the feudal tower has been preserved. Elsewhere it is\r\nplastered over anew, and more particularly in the appanages. In these\r\ndomains, comprising more than twelve of our departments, the princes of\r\nthe blood appoint to all offices in the judiciary and to all clerical\r\nlivings. Being substitutes of the king they enjoy his serviceable and\r\nhonorary rights. They are almost delegated kings, and for life; for they\r\nnot only receive all that the king would receive as seignior, but again\r\na portion of that which he would receive as monarch. For example, the\r\nhouse of Orleans collects the excises,[1222] that is to say the duty on\r\nliquors, on works in gold or silver, on manufactures of iron, on steel,\r\non cards, on paper and starch, in short, on the entire sum-total of one\r\nof the most onerous indirect taxes. It is not surprising, if, having\r\na nearly sovereign situation, they have a council, a chancellor, an\r\norganized debt, a court,[1223] a domestic ceremonial system, and that\r\nthe feudal edifice in their hands should put on the luxurious and formal\r\ntrappings which it had assumed in the hands of the king.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to its inferior personages, to a seignior of medium rank,\r\non his square league of ground, amidst the thousand inhabitants who were\r\nformerly his villeins or his serfs, within reach of the monastery, or\r\nchapter, or bishop whose rights intermingle with his rights. Whatever\r\nmay have been done to abase him his position is still very high. He is\r\nyet, as the intendants say, \"the first inhabitant;\" a prince whom\r\nthey have half despoiled of his public functions and consigned to\r\nhis honorary and available rights, but who nevertheless remains\r\na prince.[1224]--He has his bench in the church, and his right of\r\nsepulture in the choir; the tapestry bears his coat of arms; they bestow\r\non him incense, \"holy water by distinction.\" Often, having founded the\r\nchurch, he is its patron, choosing the curate and claiming to control\r\nhim; in the rural districts we see him advancing or retarding the hour\r\nof the parochial mass according to his fancy. If he bears a title he\r\nis supreme judge, and there are entire provinces, Maine and Anjou,\r\nfor example, where there is no fief without the judge. In this case\r\nhe appoints the bailiff; the registrar, and other legal and judicial\r\nofficers, attorneys, notaries, seigniorial sergeants, constabulary on\r\nfoot or mounted, who draw up documents or decide in his name in\r\ncivil and criminal cases on the first trial. He appoints, moreover, a\r\nforest-warden, or decides forest offenses, and enforces the penalties,\r\nwhich this officer inflicts. He has his prison for delinquents of\r\nvarious kinds, and sometimes his forked gibbets. On the other hand, as\r\ncompensation for his judicial costs, he obtains the property of the man\r\ncondemned to death and the confiscation of his estate. He succeeds to\r\nthe bastard born and dying in his seigniory without leaving a testament\r\nor legitimate children. He inherits from the possessor, legitimately\r\nborn, dying intestate in his house without apparent heirs. He\r\nappropriates to himself movable objects, animate or inanimate, which are\r\nfound astray and of which the owner is unknown; he claims one-half or\r\none-third of treasure-trove, and, on the coast, he takes for himself the\r\nwaif of wrecks. And finally, what is more fruitful, in these times of\r\nmisery, he becomes the possessor of abandoned lands that have remained\r\nuntilled for ten years. Other advantages demonstrate still more clearly\r\nthat he formerly possessed the government of the canton. Such are, in\r\nAuvergne, in Flanders, in Hainaut, in Artois, in Picardy, Alsace, and\r\nLorraine, the dues de poursoin ou de sauvement (care or safety within\r\nthe walls of a town), paid to him for providing general protection.\r\nThe dues of de guet et de garde (watch and guard), claimed by him for\r\nmilitary protection; of afforage, are exacted of those who sell beer,\r\nwine and other beverages, whole-sale or retail. The dues of fouage,\r\ndues on fires, in money or grain, which, according to many common-law\r\nsystems, he levies on each fireside, house or family. The dues of\r\npulvérage, quite common in Dauphiny and Provence, are levied on passing\r\nflocks of sheep. Those of the lods et ventes (lord's due), an almost\r\nuniversal tax, consist of the deduction of a sixth, often of a fifth or\r\neven a fourth, of the price of every piece of ground sold, and of\r\nevery lease exceeding nine years. The dues for redemption or relief are\r\nequivalent to one year's income, aid that he receives from collateral\r\nheirs, and often from direct heirs. Finally, a rarer due, but the most\r\nburdensome of all, is that of acapte ou de plaid-a-merci, which is a\r\ndouble rent, or a year's yield of fruits, payable as well on the death\r\nof the seignior as on that of the copyholder. These are veritable\r\ntaxes, on land, on movables, personal, for licenses, for traffic, for\r\nmutations, for successions, established formerly on the condition of\r\nperforming a public service which he is no longer obliged to perform.\r\n\r\nOther dues are also ancient taxes, but he still performs the service for\r\nwhich they are a quittance. The king, in fact, suppresses many of the\r\ntolls, twelve hundred in 1724, and the suppression is kept up. A\r\ngood many still remain to the profit of the seignior,--on bridges, on\r\nhighways, on fords, on boats ascending or descending, several being very\r\nlucrative, one of them producing 90,000 livres[1225]. He pays for the\r\nexpense of keeping up bridge, road, ford and towpath. In like manner,\r\non condition of maintaining the market-place and of providing scales and\r\nweights gratis, he levies a tax on provisions and on merchandise brought\r\nto his fair or to his market.--At Angoulême a forty-eighth of the grain\r\nsold, at Combourg near Saint-Malo, so much per head of cattle, elsewhere\r\nso much on wine, eatables and fish[1226] Having formerly built the\r\noven, the winepress, the mill and the slaughterhouse, he obliges the\r\ninhabitants to use these or pay for their support, and he demolishes all\r\nconstructions, which might enter into competition with him[1227]. These,\r\nagain, are evidently monopolies and octrois going back to the time when\r\nhe was in possession of public authority.\r\n\r\nNot only did he then possess the public authority but also possessed the\r\nsoil and the men on it. Proprietor of men, he is so still, at least\r\nin many respects and in many provinces. \"In Champagne proper, in\r\nthe Sénonais, in la Marche, in the Bourbonnais, in the Nivernais, in\r\nBurgundy, in Franche-Comté, there are none, or very few domains, no\r\nsigns remaining of ancient servitude. . . . A good many personal\r\nserfs, or so constituted through their own gratitude, or that of their\r\nprogenitors, are still found.\"[1228] There, man is a serf, sometimes by\r\nvirtue of his birth, and again through a territorial condition. Whether\r\nin servitude, or as mortmains, or as cotters, one way or another,\r\n1,500,000 individuals, it is said, wore about their necks a remnant of\r\nthe feudal collar; this is not surprising since, on the other side\r\nof the Rhine, almost all the peasantry still wear it. The seignior,\r\nformerly master and proprietor of all their goods and chattels and of\r\nall their labor, can still exact of them from ten to twelve corvées per\r\nannum and a fixed annual tax. In the barony of Choiseul near Chaumont in\r\nChampagne, \"the inhabitants are required to plow his lands, to sow and\r\nreap them for his account and to put the products into his barns. Each\r\nplot of ground, each house, every head of cattle pays a quit-claim;\r\nchildren may inherit from their parents only on condition of remaining\r\nwith them; if absent at the time of their decease he is the inheritor.\"\r\nThis is what was styled in the language of the day an estate \"with\r\nexcellent dues.\"--Elsewhere the seignior inherits from collaterals,\r\nbrothers or nephews, if they were not in community with the defunct\r\nat the moment of his death, which community is only valid through his\r\nconsent. In the Jura and the Nivernais, he may pursue fugitive serfs,\r\nand demand, at their death, not only the property left by them on\r\nhis domain, but, again, the pittance acquired by them elsewhere. At\r\nSaint-Claude he acquires this right over any person that passes a year\r\nand a day in a house belonging to the seigniory. As to ownership of the\r\nsoil we see still more clearly that he once had entire possession of it.\r\nIn the district subject to his jurisdiction the public domain remains\r\nhis private domain; roads, streets and open squares form a part of it;\r\nhe has the right to plant trees in them and to take trees up. In many\r\nprovinces, through a pasturage rent, he obliges the inhabitants to pay\r\nfor permits to pasture their cattle in the fields after the crop, and\r\nin the open common lands, (les terres vaines et vagues). Unnavigable\r\nstreams belong to him, as well as islets and accumulations formed in\r\nthem and the fish that are found in them. He has the right of the chase\r\nover the whole extent of his jurisdiction, this or that commoner being\r\nsometimes compelled to throw open to him his park enclosed by walls.\r\n\r\nOne more trait serves to complete the picture. This head of the State, a\r\nproprietor of man and of the soil, was once a resident cultivator on his\r\nown small farm amidst others of the same class, and, by this title, he\r\nreserved to himself certain working privileges which he always retained.\r\nSuch is the right of banvin, still widely diffused, consisting of the\r\nprivilege of selling his own wine, to the exclusion of all others,\r\nduring thirty or forty days after gathering the crop. Such is, in\r\nTouraine, the right of préage, which is the right to send his horses,\r\ncows and oxen \"to browse under guard in his subjects' meadows.\" Such\r\nis, finally, the monopoly of the great dove-cot, from which thousands\r\nof pigeons issue to feed at all times and seasons and on all grounds,\r\nwithout any one daring to kill or take them. Through another effect of\r\nthe same qualification he imposes quit-claims on property on which he\r\nhas formerly given perpetual leases, and, under the terms cens, censives\r\n(quit-rents), carpot (share in wine), champart (share in grain), agrier\r\n(a cash commission on general produce), terrage parciere (share of\r\nfruits). All these collections, in money or in kind, are as various as\r\nthe local situations, accidents and transactions could possibly be. In\r\nthe Bourbonnais he has one-quarter of the crop; in Berry twelve sheaves\r\nout of a hundred. Occasionally his debtor or tenant is a community: one\r\ndeputy in the National Assembly owned a fief of two hundred casks\r\nof wine on three thousand pieces of private property.[1229] Besides,\r\nthrough the retrait censuel (a species of right of redemption), he\r\ncan \"retain for his own account all property sold on the condition of\r\nremunerating the purchaser, but previously deducting for his benefit the\r\nlord's dues (lods and ventes).\" The reader, finally, must take note\r\nthat all these restrictions on property constitute, for the seignior, a\r\nprivileged credit as well on the product as on the price of the\r\nground, and, for the copyholders, an unprescriptive, indivisible and\r\nirredeemable debt. Such are the feudal. To form an idea of them in their\r\ntotality we must always imagine the count, bishop or abbot of the tenth\r\ncentury as sovereign and proprietor in his own canton. The form which\r\nhuman society then takes grows out of the exigencies of near and\r\nconstant danger with a view to local defense. By subordinating all\r\ninterests to the necessities of living, in such a way as to protect the\r\nsoil by fixing on the soil, through property and its enjoyment, a troop\r\nof brave men under the leadership of a brave chieftain. The danger\r\nhaving passed away the structure became dilapidated. For a pecuniary\r\ncompensation the seigniors allowed the economical and tenacious peasant\r\nto pick off it a good many stones. Through constraint they suffered\r\nthe king to appropriate to himself the public portion. The primitive\r\nfoundation remains, property as organized in ancient times, the fettered\r\nor exhausted land supporting a social conformation that has melted away,\r\nin short, an order of privileges and of thralldom of which the cause and\r\nthe purpose have disappeared. [1230]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. They may be justified by local and general services.\r\n\r\nAll this does not suffice to render this order detrimental or even\r\nuseless. In reality, the local chief who no longer performs his ancient\r\nservice may perform a new one in exchange for it. Instituted for war\r\nwhen life was militant, he may serve in quiet times when the régime\r\nis pacific, while the advantage to the nation is great in which this\r\ntransformation is accomplished; for, retaining its chiefs, it is\r\nrelieved of the uncertain and perilous operation which consists in\r\ncreating others. There is nothing more difficult to establish than\r\na government, that is to say, a stable government: this involves the\r\ncommand of some and the obedience of all, which is against nature. That\r\na man in his study, often a feeble old person, should dispose of the\r\nlives and property of twenty or thirty million men, most of whom he has\r\nnever seen; that he should order them to pay away a tenth or a fifth of\r\ntheir income and they should do it; that he should order them to go and\r\nslaughter or be slaughtered and that they should go; that they should\r\nthus continue for ten years, twenty years, through every kind of trial,\r\ndefeat, misery and invasion, as with the French under Louis XIV, the\r\nEnglish under Pitt, the Prussians under Frederick II., without either\r\nsedition or internal disturbances, is certainly a marvelous thing. And,\r\nfor a people to remain free it is essential that they should be ready to\r\ndo this always. Neither this fidelity nor this concord is due to sober\r\nreflection (la raison raisonnante); reason is too vacillating and too\r\nfeeble to bring about such a universal and energetic result. Abandoned\r\nto itself and suddenly restored to a natural condition, the human flock\r\nis capable only of agitation, of mutual strife until pure force at\r\nlength predominates, as in barbarous times, and until, amidst the dust\r\nand outcry, some military leader rises up who is, generally, a butcher.\r\nHistorically considered it is better to continue so than to begin\r\nover again. Hence, especially when the majority is uncultivated, it is\r\nbeneficial to have chiefs designated beforehand through the hereditary\r\ncustom by which people follow them, and through the special education\r\nby which they are qualified. In this case the public has no need to\r\nseek for them to obtain them. They are already at hand, in each canton,\r\nvisible, accepted beforehand; they are known by their names, their\r\ntitle, their fortune, their way of living; deference to their authority\r\nis established. They are almost always deserving of this authority; born\r\nand brought up to exercise it they find in tradition, in family example\r\nand in family pride, powerful ties that nourish public spirit in them;\r\nthere is some probability of their comprehending the duties with which\r\ntheir prerogative endows them.\r\n\r\nSuch is the renovation, which the feudal régime admits of. The ancient\r\nchieftain can still guarantee his pre-eminence by his services, and\r\nremain popular without ceasing to be privileged. Once a captain in his\r\ndistrict and a permanent gendarme, he is to become the resident and\r\nbeneficent proprietor, the voluntary promoter of useful undertakings,\r\nobligatory guardian of the poor, the gratuitous administrator and judge\r\nof the canton, the unsalaried deputy of the king, that is to say, a\r\nleader and protector as previously, through a new system of patronage\r\naccommodated to new circumstances. Local magistrate and central\r\nrepresentative, these are his two principal functions, and, if we extend\r\nour observation beyond France we find that he exercises either one or\r\nthe other, or both together.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1201: See note 1 at the end of the volume]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1202: One league (lieu) ca. 4 km.

LOCAL SERVICES DUE BY THE PRIVILEGED CLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Examples in Germany and England.--These services are not rendered by\r\nthe privileged classes in France.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the first one, local government. There are countries at\r\nthe gates of France in which feudal subjection, more burdensome than\r\nin France, seems lighter because, in the other scale, the benefits\r\ncounterbalance disadvantages. At Munster, in 1809, Beugnot finds a\r\nsovereign bishop, a town of convents and a large seigniorial mansion,\r\na few merchants for indispensable trade, a small bourgeoisie, and, all\r\naround, a peasantry composed of either colons or serfs. The seignior\r\ndeducts a portion of all their crops in provisions or in cattle, and,\r\nat their deaths, a portion of their inheritances. If they go away their\r\nproperty revert to him. His servants are chastised like Russian moujiks,\r\nand in each outhouse is a trestle for this purpose \"without prejudice to\r\ngraver penalties,\" probably the bastinado and the like. But \"never did\r\nthe culprit entertain the slightest idea of complaint or appeal.\" For if\r\nthe seignior whips them as the father of family he protects them \"as\r\nthe father of a family, ever coming to their assistance when misfortune\r\nbefalls them, and taking care of them in their illness.\" He provides an\r\nasylum for them in old age; he looks after their widows, and rejoices\r\nwhen they have plenty of children. He is bound to them by common\r\nsympathies they are neither miserable nor uneasy; they know that, in\r\nevery extreme or unforeseen necessity, he will be their refuge.[1301] In\r\nthe Prussian states and according to the code of Frederick the Great, a\r\nstill more rigorous servitude is atoned for by similar obligations. The\r\npeasantry, without their seignior's permission, cannot alienate a field,\r\nmortgage it, cultivate it differently, change their occupation or marry.\r\nIf they leave the seigniory he can pursue them in every direction and\r\nbring them back by force. He has the right of surveillance over their\r\nprivate life, and he chastises them if drunk or lazy. When young they\r\nserve for years as servants in his mansion; as cultivators they owe him\r\ncorvees and, in certain places, three times a week. But, according to\r\nboth law and custom, he is obliged \"to see that they are educated, to\r\nsuccor them in indigence, and, as far as possible, to provide them with\r\nthe means of support.\" Accordingly he is charged with the duties of the\r\ngovernment of which he enjoys the advantages, and, under the heavy hand\r\nwhich curbs them, but which sustains them, we do not find his subjects\r\nrecalcitrant. In England, the upper class attains to the same result\r\nby other ways. There also the soil still pays the ecclesiastic tithe,\r\nstrictly the tenth, which is much more than in France.[1302] The squire,\r\nthe nobleman, possesses a still larger portion of the soil than his\r\nFrench neighbor and, in truth, exercises greater authority in his\r\ncanton. But his tenants, the lessees and the farmers, are no longer his\r\nserfs, not even his vassals; they are free. If he governs it is through\r\ninfluence and not by virtue of a command. Proprietor and patron, he is\r\nheld in respect. Lord-lieutenant, officer in the militia, administrator,\r\njustice, he is visibly useful. And, above all, he lives at home, from\r\nfather to son; he belongs to the district. He is in hereditary and\r\nconstant relation with the local public through his occupations and\r\nthrough his pleasures, through the chase and caring for the poor,\r\nthrough his farmers whom he admits at his table, and through his\r\nneighbors whom he meets in committee or in the vestry. This shows how\r\nthe old hierarchies are maintained: it is necessary, and it suffices,\r\nthat they should change their military into a civil order of things and\r\nfind modern employment for the chieftain of feudal times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Resident Seigniors.\r\n\r\n     Remains of the beneficent feudal spirit.--They are not\r\n     rigorous with their tenants but no longer retain the local\r\n     government.--Their isolation.--Insignificance or mediocrity\r\n     of their means of subsistence.--Their expenditure.--Not in a\r\n     condition to remit dues.--Sentiments of peasantry towards\r\n     them.\r\n\r\nIf we go back a little way in our history we find here and there similar\r\nnobles.[1303] Such was the Duc de Saint-Simon, father of the writer,\r\na real sovereign in his government of Blaye, and respected by the king\r\nhimself. Such was the grandfather of Mirabeau, in his chateau of Mirabeau\r\nin Provence, the haughtiest, most absolute, most intractable of men,\r\n\"demanding that the officers whom he appointed in his regiment should\r\nbe favorably received by the king and by his ministers,\" tolerating the\r\ninspectors only as a matter of form, but heroic, generous, faithful,\r\ndistributing the pension offered to himself among six wounded captains\r\nunder his command, mediating for poor litigants in the mountain, driving\r\noff his grounds the wandering attorneys who come to practice their\r\nchicanery, \"the natural protector of man even against ministers and the\r\nking. A party of tobacco inspectors having searched his curate's house,\r\nhe pursues them so energetically on horseback that they hardly escape\r\nhim by fording the Durance. Whereupon, \"he wrote to demand the dismissal\r\nof the officers, declaring that unless this was done every person\r\nemployed in the Excise should be driven into the Rhine or the sea;\r\nsome of them were dismissed and the director himself came to give him\r\nsatisfaction.\" Finding his canton sterile and the settlers on it idle\r\nhe organized them into groups, women and children, and, in the foulest\r\nweather, puts himself at their head, with his twenty severe wounds and\r\nneck supported by a piece of silver. He pays them to work making them\r\nclear off the lands, which he gives them on leases of a hundred years,\r\nand he makes them enclose a mountain of rocks with high walls and plant\r\nit with olive trees. \"No one, under any pretext could be excused from\r\nworking unless he was ill, and in this case under treatment, or occupied\r\non his own property, a point in which my father could not be deceived,\r\nand nobody would have dared to do it.\" These are the last offshoots of\r\nthe old, knotty, savage trunk, but still capable of affording shelter.\r\nOthers could still be found in remote cantons, in Brittany and in\r\nAuvergne, veritable district commanders, and I am sure that in time of\r\nneed the peasants would obey them as much out of respect as from fear.\r\nVigor of heart and of body justifies its own ascendancy, while the\r\nsuperabundance of energy, which begins in violence, ends in beneficence.\r\n\r\nLess independent and less harsh a paternal government subsists\r\nelsewhere, if not in the law at least through custom. In Brittany, near\r\nTréguier and Lannion, says the bailiff of Mirabeau,[1304] \"the entire\r\nstaff of the coast-guard is composed of people of quality and of stock\r\ngoing back a thousand years. I have not seen one of them get irritated\r\nwith a peasant-soldier, while, at the same time, I have seen on the\r\npart of the latter an air of filial respect for them. . . . It is a\r\nterrestrial paradise with respect to patriarchal manners, simplicity\r\nand true grandeur; the attitude of the peasants towards the seigniors\r\nis that of an affectionate son with his father; and the seigniors in\r\ntalking with the peasants use their rude and coarse language, and speak\r\nonly in a kind and genial way. We see mutual regard between masters and\r\nservants.\" Farther south, in the Bocage, a wholly agricultural region,\r\nand with no roads, where ladies are obliged to travel on horseback and\r\nin ox-carts, where the seignior has no farmers, but only twenty-five or\r\nthirty métayers who work for him on shares, the supremacy of the great\r\nis no offense to their inferiors. People live together harmoniously\r\nwhen living together from birth to death, familiarly, and with the same\r\ninterests, occupations and pleasures; like soldiers with their\r\nofficers, on campaigns and under tents, in subordination although in\r\ncompanionship, familiarity never endangering respect. \"The seignior\r\noften visits them on their small farms,[1305] talks with them about\r\ntheir affairs, about taking care of their cattle, sharing in the\r\naccidents and mishaps which likewise seriously affect him. He attends\r\ntheir children's weddings and drinks with the guests. On Sunday there\r\nare dances in the chateau court, and the ladies take part in them.\" When\r\nhe is about to hunt wolves or boars the curate gives notice of it in the\r\nsermon; the peasants, with their guns gaily assemble at the rendezvous,\r\nfinding the seignior who assigns them their posts, and strictly\r\nobserving the directions he gives them. Here are soldiers and a captain\r\nready made. A little later, and of their own accord, they will choose\r\nhim for commandant in the national guard, mayor of the commune, chief of\r\nthe insurrection, and, in 1792, the marksmen of the parish are to march\r\nunder him against \"the blues\" as, at this epoch against the wolves. Such\r\nare the remnants of the good feudal spirit, like the scattered remnants\r\nof a submerged continent. Before Louis XIV., the spectacle was similar\r\nthroughout France. \"The rural nobility of former days,\" says the Marquis\r\nde Mirabeau, \"spent too much time over their cups, slept on old chairs\r\nor pallets, mounted and started off to hunt before daybreak, met\r\ntogether on St. Hubert's, and did not part until after the octave of\r\nSt. Martin's. . . . These nobles led a gay and hard life, voluntarily,\r\ncosting the State very little, and producing more through its residence\r\nand manure than we of today with our tastes, our researches, our cholics\r\nand our vapors. . The custom, and it may be said, the obsession of\r\nmaking presents to the seigniors, is well known. I have, in my lifetime,\r\nseen this custom everywhere disappear, and rightly so. . . . The\r\nseigniors are no longer of any consequence to them; is quite natural\r\nthat they should be forgotten by them as they forget. . . . The seignior\r\nbeing no longer known on his estates everybody pillages him, which is\r\nright.\"[1306] Everywhere, except in remote corners, the affection and\r\nunity of the two classes has disappeared; the shepherd is separated\r\nfrom his flock, and pastors of the people end in being considered its\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\nLet us first follow them into the provinces. We here find only the minor\r\nclass of nobles and a portion of those of medium rank; the rest are\r\nin Paris.[1307] There is the same line of separation in the church:\r\nabbés-commendatory, bishops and archbishops very seldom live at home.\r\nThe grand-vicars and canons live in the large towns; only priors and\r\ncurates dwell in the rural districts. Ordinarily the entire ecclesiastic\r\nor lay staff is absent; residents are furnished only by the secondary or\r\ninferior grades. What are their relations with the peasant? One point\r\nis certain, and that is that they are not usually hard, nor even\r\nindifferent, to him. Separated by rank they are not so by distance;\r\nneighborhood is of itself a bond among men. I have read in vain, but\r\nI have not found them the rural tyrants, which the declaimers of the\r\nRevolution portray them. Haughty with the bourgeois they are generally\r\nkind to the villager. \"Let any one travel through the provinces,\" says a\r\ncontemporary advocate, \"over the estates occupied by the seigniors.\r\nOut of one hundred one may be found tyrannizing his dependents; all\r\nthe others, patiently share the misery of those subject to their\r\njurisdiction. . . They give their debtors time, remit sums due, and\r\nafford them every facility for settlement. They mollify and temper the\r\nsometimes over-rigorous proceedings of the fermiers, stewards and other\r\nmen of business.\"[1308] An Englishwoman, who observes them in Provence\r\njust after the Revolution, says that, detested at Aix, they are much\r\nbeloved on their estates. \"Whilst they pass the first citizens with\r\ntheir heads erect and an air of disdain, they salute peasants with\r\nextreme courtesy and affability.\" One of them distributes among the\r\nwomen, children and the aged on his domain wool and flax to spin during\r\nthe bad season, and, at the end of the year, he offers a prize of one\r\nhundred livres for the two best pieces of cloth. In numerous instances\r\nthe peasant-purchasers of their land voluntarily restore it for the\r\npurchase money. Around Paris, near Romainville, after the terrible storm\r\nof 1788 there is prodigal alms-giving; \"a very wealthy man immediately\r\ndistributes forty thousand francs among the surrounding unfortunates.\"\r\nDuring the winter, in Alsace and in Paris, everybody is giving; \"in\r\nfront of each hotel belonging to a well-known family a big log is\r\nburning to which, night and day, the poor can come and warm themselves.\"\r\nIn the way of charity, the monks who remain on their premises and\r\nwitness the public misery continue faithful to the spirit of their\r\ninstitution. On the birth of the Dauphin the Augustins of Montmorillon\r\nin Poitou pay out of their own resources the tailles and corvées of\r\nnineteen poor families. In 1781, in Provence, the Dominicans of Saint\r\nMaximin support the population of their district in which the tempest\r\nhad destroyed the vines and the olive trees. \"The Carthusians of Paris\r\nfurnish the poor with eighteen hundred pounds of bread per week. During\r\nthe winter of 1784 there is an increase of alms-giving in all the\r\nreligious establishments; their farmers distribute aid among the poor\r\npeople of the country, and, to provide for these extra necessities, many\r\nof the communities increase the rigor of their abstinences.\" When at\r\nthe end of 1789, their suppression is in question, I find a number of\r\nprotests in their favor, written by municipal officers, by prominent\r\nindividuals, by a crowd of inhabitants, workmen and peasants, and these\r\ncolumns of rustic signatures are eloquent. Seven hundred families of\r\nCateau-Cambrésis[1309] send in a petition to retain \"the worthy\r\nabbés and monks of the Abbey of St. Andrew, their common fathers and\r\nbenefactors, who fed them during the tempest.\" The inhabitants of\r\nSt. Savin, in the Pyrénées, \"portray with tears of grief their\r\nconsternation\" at the prospect of suppressing their abbey of\r\nBenedictines, the sole charitable organization in this poor country. At\r\nSierk, Thionville, \"the Chartreuse,\" say the leading citizens, \"is, for\r\nus, in every respect, the Ark of the Lord; it is the main support of\r\nfrom more than twelve to fifteen hundred persons who come to it every day\r\nin the week. This year the monks have distributed amongst them their\r\nown store of grain at sixteen livres less than the current price.\" The\r\nregular canons of Domiévre, in Lorrraine, feed sixty poor persons twice\r\na week; it is essential to retain them, says the petition, \"out of pity\r\nand compassion for poor beings whose misery cannot be imagined; where\r\nthere no regular convents and canons in their dependency, the poor cry\r\nwith misery.\"[1310] At Moutiers-Saint-John, near Sémur in Burgundy, the\r\nBenedictines of Saint-Maur support the entire village and supply it this\r\nyear with food during the famine. Near Morley in Barrois, the abbey of\r\nAuvey, of the Cistercian order, \"was always, for every village in\r\nthe neighborhood, a bureau of charity.\" At Airvault, in Poitou, the\r\nmunicipal officers, the colonel of the national guard, and numbers of\r\n\"peasants and inhabitants\" demand the conservation of the regular canons\r\nof St. Augustin. \"Their existence,\" says the petition, \"is absolutely\r\nessential, as well for our town as for the country, and we should\r\nsuffer an irreparable loss in their suppression.\" The municipality\r\nand permanent council of Soissons writes that the establishment of\r\nSaint-Jean des Vignes \"has always earnestly claimed its share of the\r\npublic charges. This is the institution which, in times of calamity,\r\nwelcomes homeless citizens and provides them with subsistence. It alone\r\nbears the expenses of the assembly of the bailiwick at the time of the\r\nelection of deputies to the National Assembly. A company of the regiment\r\nof Armagnac is actually lodged under its roof. This institution is\r\nalways found wherever sacrifices are to be made.\" In scores of places\r\ndeclarations are made that the monks are \"the fathers of the poor.\" In\r\nthe diocese of Auxerre, during the summer of 1789, the Bernardines\r\nof Rigny \"stripped themselves of all they possessed in favor of the\r\ninhabitants of neighboring villages: bread, grain, money and other\r\nsupplies, have all been lavished on about twelve hundred persons who,\r\nfor more than six weeks, never failed to present themselves at their\r\ndoor daily. . . Loans, advances made on farms, credit with the purveyors\r\nof the house, all has contributed to facilitating their means for\r\nrelieving the people.\" I omit many other traits equally forcible; we see\r\nthat the ecclesiastical and lay seigniors are not simple egoists\r\nwhen they live at home. Man is compassionate of ills of which he is a\r\nwitness; absence is necessary to deaden their vivid impression; they\r\nmove the heart when the eye contemplates them. Familiarity, moreover,\r\nengenders sympathy; one cannot remain insensible to the trials of a poor\r\nman to whom, for over twenty years, one says good-morning every day on\r\npassing him, with whose life one is acquainted, who is not an abstract\r\nunit in the imagination, a statistical cipher, but a sorrowing soul and\r\na suffering body.--And so much the more because, since the writings\r\nof Rousseau and the economists, a spirit of humanity, daily growing\r\nstronger, more penetrating and more universal, has arisen to soften the\r\nheart. Henceforth the poor are thought of, and it is esteemed an\r\nhonor to think of them. We have only to read the registers of the\r\nStates-General[1311] to see that spirit of philanthropy spreads from\r\nParis even to the chateaux and abbeys of the provinces. I am satisfied\r\nthat, except for a few country squires, either huntsmen or drinkers,\r\ncarried away by the need of physical exercise, and confined through\r\ntheir rusticity to an animal life, most of the resident seigniors\r\nresembled, in fact or in intention, the gentry whom Marmontel, in his\r\nmoral tales, then brought on the stage. Fashion took this direction, and\r\npeople in France always follow the fashion. There is nothing feudal\r\nin their characters; they are \"sensible\" people, mild, very courteous,\r\ntolerably cultivated, fond of generalities, and easily and quickly\r\nroused, and very much in earnest. For instance like that amiable\r\nlogician the Marquis de Ferrières, an old light-horseman, deputy from\r\nSaumur in the National Assembly, author of an article on Theism, a moral\r\nromance and genial memoirs of no great importance; nothing could be more\r\nremote from the ancient harsh and despotic temperament. They would be\r\nglad to relieve the people, and they try to favor them as much as they\r\ncan.[1312] They are found detrimental, but they are not wicked; the evil\r\nis in their situation and not in their character. It is their situation,\r\nin fact, which, allowing them rights without exacting services, debars\r\nthem from the public offices, the beneficial influence, the effective\r\npatronage by which they might justify their advantages and attach the\r\npeasantry to them.\r\n\r\nBut on this ground the central government has taken their place. For a\r\nlong time now have they been rather feeble against the intendant,\r\nunable to protect their parish. Twenty gentlemen cannot not assemble\r\nand deliberate without the king's special permission.[1313] If those of\r\nFranche-Comté happen to dine together and hear a mass once a year, it is\r\nthrough tolerance, and even then this harmless group may assemble\r\nonly in the presence of the intendant. Separated from his equals, the\r\nseignior, again, is further away from his inferiors. The administration\r\nof the village is of no concern to him; he is not even tasked with its\r\nsupervision. The apportionment of taxes, the militia contingent,\r\nthe repairs of the church, the summoning and presiding over a parish\r\nassembly, the making of roads, the establishment of charity workshops,\r\nall this is the intendant's business or that of the communal officers\r\nwhom the intendant appoints or directs.[1314] Except through his\r\njusticiary rights, so much curtailed, the seignior is an idler in public\r\nmatters.[1315] If, by chance, he should desire to act in an official\r\ncapacity, to make some reclamation for the community, the bureaus of\r\nadministration would soon make him shut up. Since Louis XIV, the higher\r\nofficials have things their own way; all legislation and the entire\r\nadministrative system operate against the local seignior to deprive\r\nhim of his functional efficiency and to confine him to his naked title.\r\nThrough this separation of functions and title his pride increases, as\r\nhe becomes less useful. His vanity deprived of its broad pasture-ground,\r\nfalls back on a small one; henceforth he seeks distinctions and not\r\ninfluence. He thinks only of precedence and not of government.[1316]\r\nIn short, the local government, in the hands of peasants commanded by\r\nbureaucrats, has become a common, offensive lot of red tape. \"His\r\npride would be wounded if he were asked to attend to it. Raising taxes,\r\nlevying the militia, regulating the corvées, are servile acts, the works\r\nof a secretary.\" He accordingly abstains, remains isolated on his manor\r\nand leaves to others a task from which he is excluded and which he\r\ndisdains. Far from protecting his peasantry he is scarcely able to\r\nprotect himself or to preserve his immunities. Or to avoid having his\r\npoll-tax and vingtiémes reduced. Or to obtain exemption from the militia\r\nfor his domestics, to keep his own person, dwelling, dependents, and\r\nhunting and fishing rights from the universal usurpation which places\r\nall possessions and all privileges in the hands of \"Monseigneur\r\nl'intendant\" and Messieurs the sub-delegates. And the more so because he\r\nis often poor. Bouillé estimates that all the old families, save two or\r\nthree hundred, are ruined.[1317] In Rouergue several of them live on an\r\nincome of fifty and even twenty-five louis, (1000 and 500 francs). In\r\nLimousin, says an intendant at the beginning of the century, out of\r\nseveral thousands there are not fifteen who have twenty thousand livres\r\nincome. In Berry, towards 1754, \"three-fourths of them die of hunger.\"\r\nIn Franche-Comté the fraternity to which we have alluded appears in a\r\nhumorous light, \"after the mass each one returning to his domicile, some\r\non foot and others on their Rosinantes.\" In Brittany \"lots of gentlemen\r\nfound as excisemen, on the farms or in the lowest occupations.\" One M.\r\nde la Morandais becomes the overseer of an estate. A certain family with\r\nnothing but a small farm \"attests its nobility only by the pigeon-house;\r\nit lives like the peasants, eating nothing but brown bread.\" Another\r\ngentleman, a widower, \"passes his time in drinking, living licentiously\r\nwith his servants, and covering butter-pots with the handsomest\r\ntitle-deeds of his lineage.\" All the chevaliers de Châteaubriand,\" says\r\nthe father, \"were drunkards and beaters of hares.\" He himself just makes\r\nshift to live in a miserable way, with five domestics, a hound and two\r\nold mares \"in a chateau capable of accommodating a hundred seigniors\r\nwith their suites.\" Here and there in the various memoirs we see these\r\nstrange superannuated figures passing before the eye, for instance,\r\nin Burgundy, \"gentlemen huntsmen wearing gaiters and hob-nailed shoes,\r\ncarrying an old rusty sword under their arms dying with hunger and\r\nrefusing to work.\"[1318] Elsewhere we encounter \"M. de Pérignan, with\r\nhis red garments, wig and ginger face, having dry stone wails built on\r\nhis domain, and getting intoxicated with the blacksmith of the\r\nplace;\" related to Cardinal Fleury, he is made the first Duc de\r\nFleury. Everything contributes to this decay, the law, habits and\r\ncustoms, and, above all, the right of primogeniture. Instituted for the\r\npurpose of maintaining undivided sovereignty and patronage it ruins the\r\nnobles since sovereignty and patronage have no material to work on. \"In\r\nBrittany,\" says Châteaubriand, \"the elder sons of the nobles swept away\r\ntwo-thirds of the property, while the younger sons shared in one-third\r\nof the paternal heritage.\"[1319] Consequently, \"the younger sons of\r\nyounger sons soon come to the sharing of a pigeon, rabbit, hound and\r\nfowling-piece. The entire fortune of my grandfather did not exceed five\r\nthousand livres income, of which his elder son had two-thirds, three\r\nthousand three hundred livres, leaving one thousand six hundred and\r\nsixty-six livres for the three younger ones, upon which sum the elder\r\nstill had a préciput claim.\"[1320] This fortune, which crumbles away and\r\ndies out, they neither know how, nor are they disposed, to restore\r\nby commerce, manufactures or proper administration of it; it would\r\nbe derogatory. \"High and mighty seigniors of dove-cote, frog-pond and\r\nrabbit-warren,\" the more substance they lack the more value they set\r\non the name. Add to all this winter sojourn in town, the ceremonial and\r\nexpenses caused by vanity and social requirements, and the visits to\r\nthe governor and the intendant. A man must be either a German or an\r\nEnglishman to be able to pass three gloomy, rainy months in a castle\r\nor on a farm, alone, in companionship with peasants, at the risk of\r\nbecoming as awkward and as fantastic as they.[1321] They accordingly\r\nrun in debt, become involved, sell one piece of ground and then another\r\npiece. A good many alienate the whole, excepting their small manor\r\nand their seigniorial dues, the cens and the lods et ventes, and their\r\nhunting and justiciary rights on the territory of which they were\r\nformerly proprietors.[1322] Since they must support themselves on these\r\nprivileges they must necessarily enforce them, even when the privilege\r\nis burdensome, and even when the debtor is a poor man. How could they\r\nremit dues in grain and in wine when these constitute their bread and\r\nwine for the entire year? How could they dispense with the fifth and the\r\nfifth of the fifth (du quint et du requint) when this is the only coin\r\nthey obtain? Why, being needy should they not be exacting? Accordingly,\r\nin relation to the peasant, they are simply his creditors; and to this\r\nend come the feudal régime transformed by the monarchy. Around the\r\nchateau I see sympathies declining, envy raising its head, and hatreds\r\non the increase. Set aside in public matters, freed from taxation, the\r\nseignior remains isolated and a stranger among his vassals; his extinct\r\nauthority with his unimpaired privileges form for him an existence\r\napart. When he emerges from it, it is to forcibly add to the public\r\nmisery. From this soil, ruined by the tax-man, he takes a portion of its\r\nproduct, so much it, sheaves of wheat and so many measures of wine. His\r\npigeons and his game eat up the crops. People are obliged to grind in\r\nhis mill, and to leave with him a sixteenth of the flour. The sale of a\r\nfield for the sum of six hundred livres puts one hundred livres into\r\nhis pocket. A brother's inheritance reaches a brother only after he has\r\ngnawed out of it a year's income. A score of other dues, formerly\r\nof public benefit, no longer serve but to support a useless private\r\nindividual. The peasant, then as today, is eager for gain, determined\r\nand accustomed to do and to suffer everything to save or gain a crown.\r\nHe ends by looking angrily on the turret in which are preserved the\r\narchives, the rent-roll, the detested parchments by means of which a Man\r\nof another species, favored to the detriment of the rest, a universal\r\ncreditor and paid to do nothing, grazes over all the ground and feeds\r\non all the products. Let the opportunity come to enkindle all this\r\ncovetousness, and the rent-roll will burn, and with it the turret, and\r\nwith the turret, the chateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Absentee Seigniors.\r\n\r\n     Vast extent of their fortunes and rights.--Possessing\r\n     greater advantages they owe greater services.-Reasons for\r\n     their absenteeism.--Effect of it.--Apathy of the provinces.--\r\n     Condition of their estates.--They give no alms.--Misery of\r\n     their tenants.--Exactions of their agents.--Exigencies of\r\n     their debts.--State of their justiciary.--Effects of their\r\n     hunting rights.--Sentiments of the peasantry towards them.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle becomes still gloomier, on passing from the estates on\r\nwhich the seigniors reside to those on which they are non-residents.\r\nNoble or ennobled, lay and ecclesiastic, the latter are privileged among\r\nthe privileged, and form an aristocracy inside of an aristocracy. Almost\r\nall the powerful and accredited families belong to it whatever may be\r\ntheir origin and their date.[1323] Through their habitual or frequent\r\nresidence near the court, through their alliances or mutual visits,\r\nthrough their habits and their luxuries, through the influence which\r\nthey exercise and the enmities which they provoke, they form a group\r\napart, and are those who possess the most extensive estates, the leading\r\nsuzerainties, and the most complete and comprehensive jurisdictions.\r\nOf the court nobility and of the higher clergy, they number perhaps,\r\na thousand in each order, while their small number only brings out in\r\nhigher relief the enormity of their advantages. We have seen that\r\nthe appanages of the princes of the blood comprise a seventh of the\r\nterritory; Necker estimates the revenue of the estates enjoyed by the\r\nking's two brothers at two millions.[1324] The domains of the Ducs de\r\nBouillon, d'Aiguillon, and some others cover entire leagues, and,\r\nin immensity and continuity, remind one of those, which the Duke of\r\nSutherland and the Duke of Bedford now possess in England. With nothing\r\nelse than his forests and his canal, the Duke of Orleans, before\r\nmarrying his wife, as rich as himself, obtains an income of a million.\r\nA certain seigniory, le Clermontois, belonging to the Prince de Condé,\r\ncontains forty thousand inhabitants, which is the extent of a German\r\nprincipality; \"moreover all the taxes or subsidies occurring in le\r\nClermontois are imposed for the benefit of His Serene Highness, the king\r\nreceiving absolutely nothing.\"[1325] Naturally authority and wealth go\r\ntogether, and, the more an estate yields, the more its owner resembles\r\na sovereign. The archbishop of Cambray, Duc de Cambray, Comte de\r\nCambrésis, possesses the suzerainty over all the fiefs of a region which\r\nnumbers over seventy-five thousand inhabitants. He appoints one-half of\r\nthe aldermen of Cambray and the whole of the administrators of Cateau.\r\nHe nominates the abbots to two great abbeys, and presides over the\r\nprovincial assemblies and the permanent bureau, which succeeds them. In\r\nshort, under the intendant, or at his side, he maintains a pre-eminence\r\nand better still, an influence somewhat like that to day maintained over\r\nhis domain by grand duke incorporated into the new German empire. Near\r\nhim, in Hainaut, the abbé of Saint-Armand possesses seven-eighths of\r\nthe territory of the provostship while levying on the other eighth the\r\nseigniorial taxes of the corvées and the dime. He nominates the provost\r\nof the aldermen, so that, in the words of the grievances, \"he composes\r\nthe entire State, or rather he is himself the State.\"[1326] I should\r\nnever end if I were to specify all these big prizes. Let us select only\r\nthose of the prelacy, and but one particular side, that of money. In\r\nthe \"Almanach Royal,\" and in \"La France Ecclésiastique\" for 1788, we\r\nmay read their admitted revenues. The veritable revenue, however, is\r\none-half more for the bishoprics, an double and triple for the abbeys;\r\nand we must again double the veritable revenue in order to estimate\r\nits value in the money of to day.[1327]. The one hundred and thirty-one\r\nbishops and arch-bishops possess in the aggregate 5, 600, 000 livres of\r\nepiscopal income and 1,200,000 livres in abbeys, averaging 50,000 livres\r\nper head as in the printed record, and in reality 100,000. A bishop\r\nthus, in the eyes of his contemporaries, according to the statement of\r\nspectators cognizant of the actual truth, was \"a grand seignior, with\r\nan income of 100,000 livres.\"[1328] Some of the most important sees are\r\nmagnificently endowed. That of Sens brings in 70,000 livres; Verdun,\r\n74,000; Tours, 82,000; Beauvais, Toulouse and Bayeux, 90,000; Rouen,\r\n100,000; Auch, Metz and Albi, 120,000; Narbonne, 160,000; Paris and\r\nCambray, 200,000 according to official reports, and probably half as\r\nmuch more in sums actually collected. Other sees, less lucrative, are,\r\nproportionately, still better provided. Imagine a small provincial town,\r\noftentimes not even a petty sub-prefecture of our times,--Conserans,\r\nMirepoix, Lavaur, Rieux, Lombez, Saint-Papoul, Comminges, Luçon,\r\nSarlat, Mende, Fréjus, Lescar, Belley, Saint-Malo, Tréguier, Embrun,\r\nSaint-Claude,--and, in the neighborhood, less than two hundred, one\r\nhundred, and sometimes even less than fifty parishes, and, as recompense\r\nfor this slight ecclesiastical surveillance, a prelate receiving from\r\n25,000 to 70,000 livres, according to official statements; from 37,000\r\nto 105,000 livres in actual receipts; and from 74,000 to 210,000 livres\r\nin the money of to day. As to the abbeys, I count thirty-three of them\r\nproducing to the abbé from 25,000 to 120,000 livres, and twenty-seven\r\nwhich bring from 20,000 to 100,000 livres to the abbess. Weigh these\r\nsums taken from the Almanach, and bear in mind that they must be\r\ndoubled, and more, to obtain the real revenue, and be quadrupled,\r\nand more, to obtain the actual value. It is evident, that, with such\r\nrevenues, coupled with the feudal rights, police, justiciary and\r\nadministrative, which accompany them, an ecclesiastic or lay grand\r\nseignior is, in fact, a sort of prince in his district. He bears too\r\nclose a resemblance to the ancient sovereign to be entitled to live as\r\nan ordinary individual. His private advantages impose on him a public\r\ncharacter. His rank, and his enormous profits, makes it incumbent on him\r\nto perform proportionate services, and that, even under the sway of the\r\nintendant, he owes to his vassals, to his tenants, to his feudatories\r\nthe support of his mediation, of his patronage and of his gains.\r\n\r\nTo do this he must be in residence, but, generally, he is an absentee.\r\nFor a hundred and fifty years a kind of all-powerful attraction diverts\r\nthe grandees from the provinces and impels them towards the capital.\r\nThe movement is irresistible, for it is the effect of two forces,\r\nthe greatest and most universal that influence mankind, one, a social\r\nposition, and the other the national character. A tree is not to\r\nbe severed from its roots with impunity. Appointed to govern, an\r\naristocracy frees itself from the land when it no longer rules.\r\nIt ceases to rule the moment when, through increasing and constant\r\nencroachments, almost the entire justiciary, the entire administration,\r\nthe entire police, each detail of the local or general government, the\r\npower of initiating, of collaboration, of control regarding taxation,\r\nelections, roads, public works and charities, passes over into the hands\r\nof the intendant or of the sub-delegate, under the supreme direction of\r\nthe comptroller-general or of the king's council.[1329] Civil servants,\r\nmen \"of the robe and the quill,\" colorless commoners, perform the\r\nadministrative work; there is no way to prevent it. Even with the king's\r\ndelegates, a provincial governor, were he hereditary, a prince of the\r\nblood, like the Condés in Burgundy, must efface himself before the\r\nintendant; he holds no effective office; his public duties consist of\r\nshowing off and providing entertainment. Besides he would badly perform\r\nany others. The administrative machine, with its thousands of hard,\r\ncreaking and dirty wheels, as Richelieu and Louis XIV, fashioned it,\r\ncan work only in the hands of workmen who may be dismissed at any time\r\ntherefore unscrupulous and prompt to give way to the judgment of the\r\nState. It is impossible to allow oneself to get mixed up with rogues of\r\nthat description. He accordingly abstains, and abandons public affairs\r\nto them. Unemployed, bored, what could he now do on his domain, where he\r\nno longer reigns, and where dullness overpowers him? He betakes himself\r\nto the city, and especially to the court. Moreover, only here can he\r\npursue a career; to be successful he has to become a courtier. It is the\r\nwill of the king, one must frequent his apartments to obtain his favors;\r\notherwise, on the first application for them the answer will be, \"Who is\r\nhe? He is a man that I never see.\" In the king's eyes there is no excuse\r\nfor absence, even should the cause is a conversion, with penitence for\r\na motive. In preferring God to the king, he has deserted. The ministers\r\nwrite to the intendants to ascertain if the gentlemen of their province\r\n\"like to stay at home,\" and if they \"refuse to appear and perform their\r\nduties to the king.\" Imagine the grandeur of such attractions\r\navailable at the court, governments, commands, bishoprics, benefices,\r\ncourt-offices, survivor-ships, pensions, credit, favors of every kind\r\nand degree for self and family. All that a country of 25 millions men\r\ncan offer that is desirable to ambition, to vanity, to interest, is\r\nfound here collected as in a reservoir. They rush to it and draw from\r\nit.--And the more readily because it is an agreeable place, arranged\r\njust as they would have it, and purposely to suit the social aptitudes\r\nof the French character. The court is a vast permanent drawing room to\r\nwhich \"access is easy and free to the king's subjects;\" where they\r\nlive with him, \"in gentle and virtuous society in spite of the almost\r\ninfinite distance of rank and power;\" where the monarch prides himself\r\non being the perfect master of a household.[1330] In fact, no drawing\r\nroom was ever so well kept up, nor so well calculated to retain its\r\nguests by every kind of enjoyment, by the beauty, the dignity and the\r\ncharm of its decoration, by the selection of its company and by the\r\ninterest of the spectacle. Versailles is the only place to show oneself\r\noff; to make a figure, to push one's way, to be amused, to converse or\r\ngossip at the head-quarters of news, of activity and of public matters,\r\nwith the élite of the kingdom and the arbiters of fashion, elegance and\r\ntaste. \"Sire,\" said M. de Vardes to Louis XIV, \"away from Your Majesty\r\none not only feels miserable but ridiculous.\" None remain in the\r\nprovinces except the poor rural nobility; to live there one must be\r\nbehind the age, disheartened or in exile. The king's banishment of a\r\nseignior to his estates is the highest disgrace; to the humiliation\r\nof this fall is added the insupportable weight of boredom. The finest\r\nchateau on the most beautiful site is a frightful \"desert\"; nobody\r\nis seen there save the grotesques of a small town or the village\r\npeasants.[1331]\r\n\r\n\"Exile alone,\" says Arthur Young, \"can force the French nobility to do\r\nwhat the English prefer to do, and that is to live on their estates and\r\nembellish them.\"\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon and other court historians, on mentioning a ceremony,\r\nrepeatedly state that \"all France was there\"; in fact, every one of\r\nconsequence in France is there, and each recognizes the other by this\r\nsign. Paris and the court become, accordingly, the necessary sojourn\r\nof all fine people. In such a situation departure begets departure; the\r\nmore a province is forsaken the more they forsake it. \"There is not in\r\nthe kingdom,\" says the Marquis de Mirabeau, \"a single estate of any size\r\nof which the proprietor is not in Paris and who, consequently, neglects\r\nhis buildings and chateaux.\"[1332] The lay grand seigniors have\r\ntheir hotels in the capital, their entresol at Versailles, and their\r\npleasure-house within a circuit of twenty leagues; if they visit\r\ntheir estates at long intervals, it is to hunt. The fifteen hundred\r\ncommendatory abbés and priors enjoy their benefices as if they were\r\nso many remote farms. The two thousand seven hundred vicars and canons\r\nvisit each other and dine out. With the exception of a few apostolic\r\ncharacters the one hundred and thirty-one bishops stay at home as\r\nlittle as they can; nearly all of them being nobles, all of them men of\r\nsociety, what could they do out of the world, confined to a provincial\r\ntown? Can we imagine a grand seignior, once a gay and gallant abbé and\r\nnow a bishop with a hundred thousand livres income, voluntarily\r\nburying himself for the entire year at Mende, at Comminges, in a paltry\r\ncloister? The interval has become too great between the refined, varied\r\nand literary life of the great center, and the monotonous, inert,\r\npractical life of the provinces. Hence it is that the grand seignior who\r\nwithdraws from the former cannot enter into the latter, and he remains\r\nan absentee, at least in feeling.\r\n\r\nA country in which the heart ceases to impel the blood through its veins\r\npresents a somber aspect. Arthur Young, who traveled over France between\r\n1787 and 1789, is surprised to find at once such a vital center and\r\nsuch dead extremities. Between Paris and Versailles the double file of\r\nvehicles going and coming extends uninterruptedly for five leagues from\r\nmorning till night.[1333] The contrast on other roads is very great.\r\nLeaving Paris by the Orleans road, says Arthur Young, \"we met not one\r\nstage or diligence for ten miles; only two messageries and very few\r\nchaises, not a tenth of what would have been met had we been leaving\r\nLondon at the same hour.\" On the highroad near Narbonne, \"for thirty-six\r\nmiles,\" he says, \"I came across but one cabriolet, half a dozen carts\r\nand a few women leading asses.\" Elsewhere, near St. Girons, he notices\r\nthat in two hundred and fifty miles he encountered in all, \"two\r\ncabriolets and three miserable things similar to our old one-horse post\r\nchaise, and not one gentleman.\" Throughout this country the inns are\r\nexecrable; it is impossible to hire a wagon, while in England, even in\r\na town of fifteen hundred or two thousand inhabitants, there are\r\ncomfortable hotels and every means of transport. This proves that in\r\nFrance \"there is no circulation.\" It is only in very large towns that\r\nthere is any civilization and comfort. At Nantes there is a superb\r\ntheater \"twice as large as Drury-Lane and five times as magnificent. Mon\r\nDieu! I cried to myself, do all these wastes, moors, and deserts, that I\r\nhave passed for 300 miles lead to this spectacle?. . . In a single leap\r\nyou pass from misery to extravagance,...the country deserted, or if a\r\ngentleman in it, you find him in some wretched hole to save that money\r\nwhich is lavished with profusion in the luxuries of a capital.\" \"A\r\ncoach,\" says M. de Montlosier, \"set out weekly from the principal towns\r\nin the provinces for Paris and was not always full, which tells us about\r\nthe activity in business. There was a single journal called the Gazette\r\nde France, appearing twice a week, which represents the activity of\r\nminds.\"[1334] Some magistrates of Paris in exile at Bourges in 1753 and\r\n1754 give the following picture of that place:\r\n\r\n \"A town in which no one can be found with whom you can talk at\r\nyour ease on any topic whatever, reasonably or sensibly. The nobles,\r\nthree-fourths of them dying of hunger, rotting with pride of birth,\r\nkeeping apart from men of the robe and of finance, and finding it\r\nstrange that the daughter of a tax-collector, married to a counselor of\r\nthe parliament of Paris, should presume to be intelligent and entertain\r\ncompany. The citizens are of the grossest ignorance, the sole support of\r\nthis species of lethargy in which the minds of most of the inhabitants\r\nare plunged. Women, bigoted and pretentious, and much given to play and\r\nto gallantry.\"[1335]\r\n\r\nIn this impoverished and benumbed society, among these Messieurs\r\nThibaudeau, the counselor, and Harpin, the tax-collector, among\r\nthese vicomtes de Sotenville and Countesses d'Escarbagnas, lives the\r\nArchbishop, Cardinal de Larochefoucauld, grand almoner to the king,\r\nprovided with four great abbeys, possessing five hundred thousand livres\r\nincome, a man of the world, generally an absentee, and when at home,\r\nfinding amusement in the embellishing of his gardens and palace,\r\nin short, the golden pheasant of an aviary in a poultry yard of\r\ngeese.[1336] Naturally there is an entire absence of political thought.\r\n\"You cannot imagine,\" says the manuscript, \"a person more indifferent to\r\nall public matters.\" At a later period, in the very midst of events of\r\nthe gravest character, and which most nearly concern them, there is the\r\nsame apathy. At Chateau-Thierry on the 4th of July, 1789,[1337] there is\r\nnot a café in which a new paper can be found; there is but one at Dijon;\r\nat Moulins, the 7th of August, \"in the best café in the town, where I\r\nfound near twenty tables set for company, but as for a newspaper I might\r\nas well have demanded an elephant.\" Between Strasbourg and Besançon\r\nthere is not a gazette. At Besançon there is \"nothing but the Gazette de\r\nFrance, for which, this period, a man of common sense would not give one\r\nsol,. . . and the Courier de l'Europe a fortnight old; and well-dressed\r\npeople are now talking of the news of two or three weeks past, and\r\nplainly by their discourse know nothing of what is passing. At Clermont\r\n\"I dined, or supped, five times at the table d'hôte with from twenty to\r\nthirty merchants, trade men, officers, etc., and it is not easy for\r\nme to express the insignificance,--the inanity of their conversation.\r\nScarcely any politics are mentioned at a moment when every bosom\r\nought to beat with none but political sensations. The ignorance or the\r\nstupidity of these people must be absolutely incredible; not a week\r\npasses without their country abounding with events[1338] that are\r\nanalyzed an debated by the carpenters and blacksmiths of England.\" The\r\ncause of this inertia is manifest; interrogated on their opinions, all\r\nreply: \"We are of the provinces and we must wait to know what is going\r\non in Paris.\" Never having acted, they do no know how to act. But,\r\nthanks to this inertia, they let themselves be driven. The provinces\r\nform an immense stagnant pond, which, by a terrible inundation, may be\r\nemptied exclusively on one side, and suddenly; the fault lies with the\r\nengineers who failed to provide it with either dikes or outlets.\r\n\r\nSuch is the languor or, rather, the prostration, into which local life\r\nfalls when the local chiefs deprive it of their presence, action or\r\nsympathy. I find only three or four grand seigniors taking a part in it,\r\npractical philanthropists following the example of English noblemen;\r\nthe Duc d'Harcourt, who settles the lawsuits of his peasants; the Duc\r\nde Larochefoucauld-Liancourt who establishes a model farm on his domain,\r\nand a school of industrial pursuits for the children of poor soldiers;\r\nand the Comte de Brienne, whose thirty villages are to demand liberty\r\nof the Convention.[1339] The rest, for the most part liberals, content\r\nthemselves with discussions on public affairs and on political economy.\r\nIn fact, the difference in manners, the separation of interests, the\r\nremoteness of ideas are so great that contact between those most exempt\r\nfrom haughtiness and their immediate tenantry is rare, and at long\r\nintervals. Arthur Young, needing some information at the house of the\r\nDuc de Larochefoucauld himself, the steward is sent for. \"At an English\r\nnobleman's, there would have been three or four farmers asked to meet\r\nme, who would have dined with the family amongst the ladies of the first\r\nrank. I do not exaggerate when I say that I have had this at least an\r\nhundred times in the first houses of our islands. It is, however, a\r\nthing that in the present style of manners in France would not be met\r\nwith from Calais to Bayonne except, by chance, in the house of some\r\ngreat lord that had been much in England, and then not unless it was\r\nasked for. The nobility in France have no more idea of practicing\r\nagriculture, and making it a subject of conversation, except on the mere\r\ntheory, as they would speak of a loom or a bowsprit, than of any\r\nother object the most remote from their habits and pursuits.\" Through\r\ntradition, fashion and deliberation, they are, and wish only to be,\r\npeople of society; their sole concern is to talk and to hunt. Never have\r\nthe leaders of men so unlearned the art of leading men; the art which\r\nconsists of marching along the same pathway with them, but at the\r\nhead, and directing their labor by sharing in it.--Our Englishman,\r\nan eye-witness and competent, again writes: \"Thus it is whenever you\r\nstumble on a grand seignior, even one that was worth millions, you are\r\nsure to find his property desert. Those of the Duc de Bouillon and of\r\nthe Prince de Soubise are two of the greatest properties in France;\r\nand all the signs I have yet seen of their greatness are heaths, moors,\r\ndeserts, and brackens. Go to their residence, wherever it may be, and\r\nyou would probably find them in the midst of a forest very well peopled\r\nwith deer, wild boars and wolves.\" \"The great proprietors,\" says another\r\ncontemporary,[1340] \"attracted to and kept in our cities by luxurious\r\nenjoyments know nothing of their estates,\" save \"of their agents\r\nwhom they harass for the support of a ruinous ostentation. How can\r\nameliorations be looked for from those who even refuse to keep things up\r\nand make indispensable repairs?\" A sure proof that their absence is the\r\ncause of the evil is found in the visible difference between the domain\r\nworked under absent abbé-commendatory and a domain superintended by\r\nmonks living on the spot \"The intelligent traveler recognizes it\"\r\nat first sight by the state of cultivation. \"If he finds fields well\r\nenclosed by ditches, carefully planted, and covered with rich crops,\r\nthese fields, he says to himself; belong to the monks. Almost always,\r\nalongside of these fertile plains, is an area of ground badly tilled and\r\nalmost barren, presenting a painful contrast; and yet the soil is the\r\nsame, being two portions of the same domain; he sees that the latter\r\nis the portion of the abbé-commendatory.\" \"The abbatial manse.\"\r\nsaid Lefranc de Pompignan, \"frequently looks like the property of a\r\nspendthrift; the monastic manse is like a patrimony whereon nothing is\r\nneglected for its amelioration,\" to such an extent that \"the two-thirds\"\r\nwhich the abbé enjoys bring him less than the third reserved by his\r\nmonks.--The ruin or impoverishment of agriculture is, again, one of the\r\neffects of absenteeism. There was, perhaps, one-third of the soil in\r\nFrance, which, deserted as in Ireland, was as badly tilled, as little\r\nproductive as in Ireland in the hands of the rich absentees, the English\r\nbishops, deans and nobles.\r\n\r\nDoing nothing for the soil, how could they do anything for men? Now and\r\nthen, undoubtedly, especially with farms that pay no rent, the steward\r\nwrites a letter, alleging the misery of the farmer. There is no doubt,\r\nalso, that, especially for thirty years back, they desire to be humane;\r\nthey descant among themselves about the rights of man; the sight of the\r\npale face of a hungry peasant would give them pain. But they never\r\nsee him; does it ever occur to them to fancy what it is like under the\r\nawkward and complimentary phrases of their agent? Moreover, do they know\r\nwhat hunger is? Who amongst them has had any rural experiences? And how\r\ncould they picture to themselves the misery of this forlorn being? They\r\nare too remote from him to that, too ignorant of his mode of life. The\r\nportrait they conceive of him is imaginary; never was there a falser\r\nrepresentation of the peasant; accordingly the awakening is to be\r\nterrible. They view him as the amiable swain, gentle, humble and\r\ngrateful, simple-hearted and right-minded, easily led, being conceived\r\naccording to Rousseau and the idylls performed at this very epoch in all\r\nprivate drawing rooms.[1341] Lacking a knowledge him they overlook him;\r\nthey read the steward's letter and immediately the whirl of high life\r\nagain seizes them and, after a sigh bestowed on the distress of the\r\npoor, they make up their minds that their income for the year will\r\nbe short. A disposition of this kind is not favorable to charity.\r\nAccordingly, complaints arise, not against the residents but against the\r\nabsentees.[1342] \"The possessions of the Church, says a letter, serve\r\nonly to nourish the passions of their holders.\" \"According to the\r\ncanons, says another memorandum, every beneficiary must give a quarter\r\nof his income to the poor; nevertheless in our parish there is a revenue\r\nof more than twelve thousand livres, and none of it is given to the poor\r\nunless it is some small matter at the hands of the curate.\" \"The abbé\r\nde Conches gets one-half of the tithes and contributes nothing to the\r\nrelief of the parish.\" Elsewhere, \"the chapter of Ecouis, which owns the\r\nbenefice of the tithes is of no advantage to the poor, and only seeks\r\nto augment its income.\" Nearby, the abbé of Croix-Leufroy, \"a heavy\r\ntithe-owner, and the abbé de Bernay, who gets fifty-seven thousand\r\nlivres from his benefice, and who is a non-resident, keep all and\r\nscarcely give enough to their officiating curates to keep them alive.\"\r\n\"I have in my parish, says a curate of Berry,[1343] six simple benefices\r\nof which the titularies are always absent. They enjoy together an\r\nincome of nine thousand livres; I sent them in writing the most urgent\r\nentreaties during the calamity of the past year; I received from one\r\nthem two louis only, and most of them did not even answer me.\" Stronger\r\nis the reason for a conviction that in ordinary times they will make no\r\nremission of their dues. Moreover, these dues, the censives, the lods et\r\nventes, tithes, and the like, are in the hands of a steward, and he is a\r\ngood steward who returns a large amount of money. He has no right to be\r\ngenerous at his master's expense, and he is tempted to turn the subjects\r\nof his master to his own profit. In vain might the soft seignorial hand\r\nbe disposed to be easy or paternal; the hard hand of the proxy bears\r\ndown on the peasants with all its weight, and the caution of a chief\r\ngives place to the exactions of a clerk.--How is it then when, instead\r\nof a clerk on the domain, a fermier is found, an adjudicator who, for\r\nan annual sum, purchases of seignior the management and product of his\r\ndues? In election of Mayenne,[1344] and certainly also in many others,\r\nthe principal domains are rented in this way. Moreover there are a\r\nnumber of dues, like the tolls, the market-place tax, that on the flock\r\napart, the monopoly of the oven and of the mill which can scarcely be\r\nmanaged otherwise; the seignior must necessarily employ an adjudicator\r\nwho spares him the disputes and trouble of collecting.[1345] This\r\nhappens often and the demands and the greed of the contractor, who is\r\ndetermined to gain or, at least, not to lose, falls on the peasantry:\r\n\r\n\"He is a ravenous wolf,\" says Renauldon, \"let loose on the estate. He\r\ndraws upon it to the last sou, he crushes the subjects, reduces them\r\nto beggary, forces the cultivators to desert. The owner, thus rendered\r\nodious, finds himself obliged to tolerate his exactions to able to\r\nprofit by them.\"\r\n\r\nImagine, if you can, the evil which a country usurer exercises, armed\r\nagainst them with such burdensome rights; it is the feudal seigniory\r\nin the hands of Harpagon, or rather of old Grandet. When, indeed, a tax\r\nbecomes insupportable we see, by the local complaints, that it is nearly\r\nalways a fermier who enforces it.[1346] It is one of these, acting for\r\na body of canons, who claims Jeanne Mermet's paternal inheritance on the\r\npretense that she had passed her wedding night at her husband's house.\r\nOne can barely find similar exactions in the Ireland of 1830, on those\r\nestates where, the farmer-general renting to sub-farmers and the latter\r\nto others still below them. The poor tenant at the foot of the ladder\r\nhimself bore the full weight of it, so much the more crushed because his\r\ncreditor, crushed himself measured the requirements he exacted by those\r\nhe had to submit to.\r\n\r\nSuppose that, seeing this abuse of his name, the seignior is desirous\r\nof withdrawing the administration of his domains from these mercenary\r\nhands. In most cases he is unable to do it: he too deeply in debt,\r\nhaving appropriated to his creditors a certain portion of his land, a\r\ncertain branch of his income. For centuries, the nobles are involved\r\nthrough their luxury, their prodigality, their carelessness, and through\r\nthat false sense of honor, which consists in looking upon attention to\r\naccounts as the occupation of an accountant. They take pride in their\r\nnegligence, regarding it, as they say, living nobly.[1347] \"Monsieur the\r\narchbishop,\" said Louis XVI. to M. de Dillon, \"they say that you are\r\nin debt, and even largely.\" \"Sire,\" replied the prelate, with the irony\r\nof a grand seignior, \"I will ask my intendant and inform Your Majesty.\"\r\nMarshal de Soubise has five hundred thousand livres income, which is not\r\nsufficient for him. We know the debts of the Cardinal de Rohan and of\r\nthe Comte Artois;[1348] their millions of income were vainly thrown\r\ninto this gulf. The Prince de Guémenée happens to become bankrupt on\r\nthirty-five millions. The Duke of Orleans, the richest proprietor in the\r\nkingdom, owed at his death seventy-four millions. When became necessary\r\nto pay the creditors of the emigrants out of the proceeds of their\r\npossessions, it was proved that most of the large fortunes were eaten up\r\nwith mortgages.[1349] Readers of the various memoirs know that, for\r\ntwo hundred years, the deficiencies had to be supplied by marriages for\r\nmoney and by the favors of the king.--This explains why, following\r\nthe king's example, the nobles converted everything into money, and\r\nespecially the places at their disposition, and, in relaxing authority\r\nfor profit, why they alienated the last fragment of government remaining\r\nin their hands. Everywhere they thus laid aside the venerated character\r\nof a chief to put on the odious character of a trafficker. \"Not only,\"\r\nsays a contemporary,[1350] \"do they give no pay to their officers of\r\njustice, or take them at a discount, but, what is worse, the greater\r\nportion of them make a sale of these offices.\" In spite of the edict of\r\n1693, the judges thus appointed take no steps to be admitted into the\r\nroyal courts and they take no oaths. \"What is the result? Justice, too\r\noften administered by knaves, degenerates into brigandage or into a\r\nfrightful impunity.\"--Ordinarily the seignior who sells the office on a\r\nfinancial basis, deducts, in addition, the hundredth, the fiftieth, the\r\ntenth of the price, when it passes into other hands; and at other\r\ntimes he disposes of the survivorship. He creates these offices and\r\nsurvivorships purposely to sell them. \"All the seigniorial courts,\r\nsay the registers, are infested with a crowd of officials of every\r\ndescription, seigniorial sergeants, mounted and unmounted officers,\r\nkeepers of the provostship of the funds, guards of the constabulary. It\r\nis by no means rare to find as many as ten in an arrondissement which\r\ncould hardly maintain two if they confined themselves within the limits\r\nof their duties.\" Also \"they are at the same time judges, attorneys,\r\nfiscal-attorneys, registrars, notaries,\" each in a different place,\r\neach practicing in several seigniories under various titles, all\r\nperambulating, all in league like thieves at a fair, and assembling\r\ntogether in the taverns to plan, prosecute and decide. Sometimes the\r\nseignior, to economize, confers the title on one of his own dependents:\r\n\"At Hautemont, in Hainaut, the fiscal-attorney is a domestic.\" More\r\nfrequently he nominates some starveling advocate of a petty village in\r\nthe neighborhood on wages which would not suffice to keep him alive\r\na week.\" He indemnifies himself out of the peasants. Processes of\r\nchicanery, delays and willful complications in the proceedings, sittings\r\nat three livres the hour for the advocate and three livres the hour for\r\nthe bailiff. The black brood of judicial leeches suck so much the more\r\neagerly, because the more numerous, a still more scrawny prey, having\r\npaid for the privilege of sucking it.[1351] The arbitrariness, the\r\ncorruption, the laxity of such a régime can be divined. \"Impunity,\" says\r\nRenauldon, \"is nowhere greater than in the seigniorial tribunals. . . .\r\nThe foulest crimes obtain no consideration there,\" for the seignior\r\ndreads supplying the means for a criminal trial, while his judges\r\nor prosecuting attorneys fear that they will not be paid for their\r\nproceedings. Moreover, his jail is often a cellar under the chateau;\r\n\"there is not one tribunal out of a hundred in conformity with the law\r\nin respect of prisons;\" their keepers shut their eyes or stretch out\r\ntheir hands. Hence it is that \"his estates become the refuge of all the\r\nscoundrels in the canton.\" The effect of his indifference is terrible\r\nand it is to react against him: to-morrow, at the club, the attorneys\r\nwhom he has multiplied will demand his head, and the bandits whom he has\r\ntolerated will place it on the end of a pike.\r\n\r\nOne-point remains, the chase, wherein the noble's jurisdiction is still\r\nactive and severe, and it is just the point which is found the most\r\noffensive. Formerly, when one-half of the canton consisted of forest,\r\nor waste land, while the other half was being ravaged by wild beasts, he\r\nwas justified in reserving the right to hunt them; it entered into his\r\nfunction as local captain. He was the hereditary gendarme, always armed,\r\nalways on horseback, as well against wild boars and wolves as against\r\nrovers and brigands. Now that nothing is left to him of the gendarme\r\nbut the title and the epaulettes he maintains his privilege through\r\ntradition, thus converting a service into an annoyance. Hunt he must,\r\nand he alone must hunt; it is a physical necessity and, it the same\r\ntime, a sign of his blood. A Rohan, a Dillon, chases the stag although\r\nbelonging to the church, in spite of edicts and in spite of the canons.\r\n\"You hunt too much,\" said Louis XV.[1352] to the latter; \"I know\r\nsomething about it. How can you prohibit your curates from hunting\r\nif you pass your life in setting them such an example?--Sire, for\r\nmy curates the chase is a fault, for myself it is the fault of my\r\nancestors.\" When the vanity and arrogance of caste thus mounts guard\r\nover a right it is with obstinate vigilance. Accordingly, their\r\ncaptains of the chase, their game-keepers, their wood-rangers, their\r\nforest-wardens protect brutes as if they were men, and hunt men as\r\nif they were brutes. In the bailiwick of Pont-l'Evèque in 1789\r\nfour instances are cited \"of recent assassinations committed by the\r\ngame-keepers of Mme. d'A----,--Mme. N----, a prelate and a marshal of\r\nFrance, on commoners caught breaking the game laws or carrying guns. All\r\nfour publicly escape punishment.\" In Artois, a parish makes declaration\r\nthat \"on the lands of the Chattellany the game devours all the avêtis\r\n(pine saplings) and that the growers of them will be obliged to abandon\r\ntheir business.\" Not far off; at Rumancourt, at Bellone, \"the hares,\r\nrabbits and partridges entirely devour them, Count d'Oisy never hunting\r\nnor having hunts.\" In twenty villages in the neighborhood around\r\nOisy where he hunts it is on horseback and across the crops. \"His\r\ngame-keepers, always armed, have killed several persons under the\r\npretense of watching over their master's rights. . . . The game, which\r\ngreatly exceeds that of the royal captaincies, consumes annually all\r\nprospects of a crop, twenty thousand razières of wheat and as many of\r\nother grains.\" In the bailiwick of Evreux \"the game has just destroyed\r\neverything up to the very houses. . . . On account of the game the\r\ncitizen is not free to pull up the weeds in summer which clog the\r\ngrain and injure the seed sown. . . . How many women are there without\r\nhusbands, and children without fathers, on account of a poor hare or\r\nrabbit!\" The game-keepers of the forest of Gouffray in Normandy \"are\r\nso terrible that they maltreat, insult and kill men. . . . I know of\r\nfarmers who, having pleaded against the lady to be indemnified for the\r\nloss of their wheat, not only lost their time but their crops and the\r\nexpenses of the trial. . . . Stags and deer are seen roving around our\r\nhouses in open daylight.\" In the bailiwick of Domfront, \"the inhabitants\r\nof more than ten parishes are obliged to watch all night for more than\r\nsix months of the year to secure their crops.[1353]--This is the effect\r\nof the right of the chase in the provinces. It is, however, in the\r\nIle-de-France, where captaincies abound, and become more extensive,\r\nthat the spectacle is most lamentable. A procés-verbal shows that in\r\nthe single parish of Vaux, near Meulan, the rabbits of warrens in the\r\nvicinity ravage eight hundred cultivated arpents (acres) of ground and\r\ndestroy the crops of two thousand four hundred setiers (three acres\r\neach), that is to say, the annual supplies of eight hundred persons.\r\nNear that place, at la Rochette, herds of deer and of stags devour\r\neverything in the fields during the day, and, at night, they even invade\r\nthe small gardens of the inhabitants to consume vegetables and to break\r\ndown young trees. It is found impossible in a territory subjected to a\r\ncaptaincy to retain vegetables safe in gardens, enclosed by high walls.\r\nAt Farcy, of five hundred peach trees planted in a vineyard and browsed\r\non by stags, only twenty remain at the end of three years. Over the\r\nwhole territory of Fontainebleau, the communities, to save their vines,\r\nare obliged to maintain, with the assent always of the captaincy, a gang\r\nof watchmen who, with licensed dogs, keep watch and make a hubbub all\r\nnight from the first of May to the middle of October. At Chartrettes\r\nthe deer cross the Seine, approach the doors of the Comtesse de\r\nLarochefoucauld and destroy entire plantations of poplars. A domain\r\nrented for two thousand livres brings in only four hundred after the\r\nestablishment of the captaincy of Versailles. In short, eleven regiments\r\nof an enemy's cavalry, quartered on the eleven captaincies near\r\nthe capital, and starting out daily to forage, could not do more\r\nmischief.--We need not be surprised if, in the neighborhood of these\r\nlairs, the people become weary of cultivating.[1354] Near Fontainebleau\r\nand Melun, at Bois-le-Roi, three-quarters of the ground remains waste.\r\nAlmost all the houses in Brolle are in ruins, only half-crumbling gables\r\nbeing visible; at Coutilles and at Chapelle-Rablay, five farms are\r\nabandoned; at Arbonne, numerous fields are neglected. At Villiers, and\r\nat Dame-Marie, where there were four farming companies and a number of\r\nspecial cultures, eight hundred arpents remain untilled.--Strange to\r\nsay, as the century becomes more easygoing the enforcement of the chase\r\nbecomes increasingly harsh. The officers of the captaincy are zealous\r\nbecause they labor under the eye and for the \"pleasures\" of their\r\nmaster. In 1789, eight hundred preserves had just been planted in one\r\nsingle canton of the captaincy of Fontainebleau, and in spite of the\r\nproprietors of the soil. According to the regulations of 1762 every\r\nprivate individual domiciled on the reservation of a captaincy is\r\nforbidden from enclosing his homestead or any ground whatever with\r\nhedges or ditches, or walls without a special permit.[1355] In case of\r\na permit being given he must leave a wide, open and continuous space in\r\norder to let the huntsmen easily pass through. He is not allowed to keep\r\nany ferret, any fire-arm, any instrument adapted to the chase, nor to be\r\nfollowed by any dog even if not adapted to it, except the dog be held\r\nby a leash or clog fastened around its neck. And better still. He is\r\nforbidden to reap his meadow or his Lucerne before St. John's day, to\r\nenter his own field between the first of May and the twenty-fourth of\r\nJune, to visit any island in the Seine, to cut grass on it or osiers,\r\neven if the grass and osiers belong to him. The reason is, that now the\r\npartridge is hatching and the legislator protects it; he would take less\r\npains for a woman in confinement; the old chroniclers would say of him,\r\nas with William Rufus, that his bowels are paternal only for animals.\r\nNow, in France, four hundred square leagues of territory are subject to\r\nthe control of the captaincies,[1356] and, over all France, game, large\r\nor small, is the tyrant of the peasant. We may conclude, or rather\r\nlisten to the people's conclusion. \"Every time,\" says M. Montlosier,\r\nin 1789,[1357] \"that I chanced to encounter herds of deer or does on my\r\nroad my guides immediately shouted: 'Make room for the gentry!' in\r\nthis way alluding to the ravages committed by them on their land.\"\r\nAccordingly, in the eyes of their subjects, they are wild animals.--This\r\nshows to what privileges can lead when divorced from duties. In this\r\nmanner an obligation to protect degenerates into a right of devastation.\r\nThus do humane and rational beings act, unconsciously, like irrational\r\nand inhuman beings. Divorced from the people they misuse them; nominal\r\nchiefs, they have unlearned the function of an effective chief;\r\nhaving lost all public character they abate nothing of their private\r\nadvantages. So much the worse for the canton, and so much worse for\r\nthemselves. The thirty or forty poachers whom they prosecute to day on\r\ntheir estates will march to-morrow to attack their chateaux at the\r\nhead of an insurrection. The absence of the masters, the apathy of the\r\nprovinces, the bad state of cultivation, the exactions of agents,\r\nthe corruption of the tribunals, the vexations of the captaincies,\r\nindolence, the indebtedness and exigencies of the seignior, desertion,\r\nmisery, the brutality and hostility of vassals, all proceeds from the\r\nsame cause and terminates in the same effect.\r\n\r\nWhen sovereignty becomes transformed into a sinecure it becomes\r\nburdensome without being useful, and on becoming burdensome without\r\nbeing useful it is overthrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1301: Beugnot, \"Mémoires,\" V.

PUBLIC SERVICES DUE BY THE PRIVILEGED CLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. England compared to France.\r\n\r\n     An English example.--The Privileged class renders no service\r\n     in France.--The influence and rights which remain to them.--\r\n     They use it only for themselves.\r\n\r\nUseless in the canton, they might have been useful at the Center of the\r\nState, and, without taking part in the local government, they might have\r\nserved in the general government. Thus does a lord, a baronet, a\r\nsquire act in England, even when not a \"justice\" of his county or a\r\ncommittee-man in his parish. Elected a member of the Lower House, a\r\nhereditary member of the upper house, he holds the strings of the public\r\npurse and prevents the sovereign from spending too freely. Such is the\r\nrégime in countries where the feudal seigniors, instead of allowing\r\nthe sovereign to ally himself with the people against them, allied\r\nthemselves with the people against the sovereign. To protect their own\r\ninterests better they secured protection for the interests of others,\r\nand, after having served as the representatives of their compeers they\r\nbecame the representatives of the nation. Nothing of this kind takes\r\nplace in France. The States-General are fallen into desuetude, and\r\nthe king may with truth declare himself the sole representative of the\r\ncountry. Like trees rendered lifeless under the shadow of a gigantic\r\noak, other public powers perish through his growth; whatever still\r\nremains of these encumbers the ground, and forms around him a circle of\r\nclambering briers or of decaying trunks. One of them, the Parliament,\r\nan offshoot simply of the great oak, sometimes imagined itself\r\nin possession of a root of its own; but its sap was too evidently\r\nderivative for it to stand by itself and provide the people with an\r\nindependent shelter. Other bodies, surviving, although stunted, the\r\nassembly of the clergy and the provincial assemblies, still protect an\r\norder, and four or five provinces; but this protection extends only\r\nto the order itself or to the province, and, if it protects a special\r\ninterest it is commonly at the expense of the general interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Clergy\r\n\r\n     Assemblies of the clergy.--They serve only ecclesiastical\r\n     interests.--The clergy exempted from taxation.--Solicitation\r\n     of its agents.--Its zeal against the Protestants.\r\n\r\nLet us observe the most vigorous and the best-rooted of these bodies,\r\nthe assembly of the clergy. It meets every five years, and, during the\r\ninterval, two agents, selected by it, watch over the interests of the\r\norder. Convoked by the government, subject to its guidance, retained or\r\ndismissed when necessary, always in its hands, used by it for political\r\nends, it nevertheless continues to be a refuge for the clergy, which it\r\nrepresents. But it is an asylum solely for that body, and, in the series\r\nof transactions by which it defends itself against fiscal demands,\r\nit eases its own shoulders of the load only to make it heavier on the\r\nshoulders of others. We have seen how its diplomacy saved clerical\r\nimmunities, how it bought off the body from the poll-tax and the\r\nvingtièmes, how it converted its portion of taxation into a \"free gift,\"\r\nhow this gift is annually applied to refunding the capital which it has\r\nborrowed to obtain this exemption, by which delicate art it succeeds,\r\nnot only in not contributing to the treasury, but in withdrawing from\r\nit every year about 1,500,000 livres, all of which is so much the better\r\nfor the church but so much the worse for the people. Now run through\r\nthe file of folios in which from one period of five years to another\r\nthe reports of its agents follow each other,--so many clever men thus\r\npreparing themselves for the highest positions in the church, the abbés\r\nde Boisgelin, de Périgord, de Barral, de Montesquiou; at each moment,\r\nowing to their solicitations with judges and the council, owing to the\r\nauthority which the discontent of the powerful order felt to be behind\r\nthem gives to their complaints, some ecclesiastic matter is decided in\r\nan ecclesiastical sense; so feudal right is maintained in favor of a\r\nchapter or of a bishop; some public demand is thrown out.[1401] In 1781,\r\nnotwithstanding decision of the Parliament of Rennes, the canons of St.\r\nMalo are sustained in their monopoly of the district baking oven.\r\nThis is to the detriment of the bakers who prefer to bake at their own\r\ndomiciles as well as of the inhabitants who would have to pay less for\r\nbread made by the bakers. In 1773, Guénin, a schoolmaster, discharged\r\nby the bishop of Langres, and supported in vain by inhabitants, is\r\ncompelled to hand his place over to a successor appointed by the\r\nbishop. In 1770, Rastel, a Protestant, having opened a public school\r\nat Saint-Affrique, is prosecuted at the demand of the bishop and of\r\nclerical agents; his school is closed and he is imprisoned. When an\r\norganized body keeps purse strings in its own hands it secures many\r\nfavors; these are the equivalent for the money it grants. The commanding\r\ntone of the king and the submissive air of the clergy effect no fun\r\nmental change; with both of them it is a bargain,[1402] giving and\r\ntaking on both sides, this or that law against the Protestants going for\r\none or two millions added to the free gift. In this way the revocation\r\nof the Edict of Nantes is gradually brought about, article by article,\r\none turn of the rack after another turn, each fresh persecution\r\npurchased by a fresh largess, the clergy helping the State on condition\r\nthat the State becomes an executioner. Throughout the eighteenth\r\ncentury the church sees that this operation continues.[1403] In 1717, an\r\nassemblage of seventy-four persons having been surprised at Andure the\r\nmen are sent to the galleys and the women are imprisoned. In 1724, an\r\nedict declares that all who are present at any meeting, or who shall\r\nhave any intercourse, direct or indirect, with preachers, shall be\r\ncondemned to the confiscation of their property, the women to have their\r\nheads shaved and be shut up for life, and the men to sent to the galleys\r\nfor life. In 1745 and 1746, in Dauphiny, 277 Protestants are condemned\r\nto the galleys, and numbers of women are whipped. Between 1744 and 1752,\r\nin the east and in the south, six hundred Protestants are imprisoned and\r\neight hundred condemned to various penalties. In 1774, the two children\r\nof Roux, a Calvinist of Nimes, are carried off. Up to nearly the\r\nbeginning of the Revolution, in Languedoc, ministers are hung, while\r\ndragoons are dispatched against congregations assembled to worship God\r\nin deserted places. The mother of M. Guizot here received shots in\r\nthe skirts of her dress. This is owing to the fact that, in Languedoc,\r\nthrough the provincial States-Assembly \"the bishops control temporal\r\naffairs more than elsewhere, their disposition being always to dragoon\r\nand make converts at the point of the bayonet.\" In 1775, at the\r\ncoronation of the king, archbishop Loménie of Brienne, a well-known\r\nunbeliever, addresses the young king: \"You will disapprove of the\r\nculpable systems of toleration... Complete the work undertaken by Louis\r\nthe Great. To you is reserved the privilege of giving the final blow to\r\nCalvinism in your kingdom.\" In 1780, the assembly of the clergy declares\r\n\"that the altar and the throne would equally be in danger if heresy\r\nwere allowed to throw off its shackles.\" Even in 1789, the clergy in its\r\nregisters, while consenting to the toleration of non-Catholics, finds\r\nthe edict of 1788 too liberal. They desire that non-Catholics should\r\nbe excluded from judicial offices, that they should never be allowed\r\nto worship in public, and that mixed marriages should be forbidden. And\r\nmuch more than this; they demand preliminary censure of all works sold\r\nby the bookshops, an ecclesiastical committee to act as informers,\r\nand ignominious punishment to be awarded to the authors of irreligious\r\nbooks. Lastly they claim for their body the direction of public schools\r\nand the oversight of private schools.--There is nothing strange in this\r\nintolerance and selfishness. A collective body, as with an individual,\r\nthinks of itself first of all and above all. If, now and then, it\r\nsacrifices some one of its privileges it is for the purpose of securing\r\nthe alliance of some other body. In that case, which is that of England,\r\nall these privileges, which compound with each other and afford each\r\nother mutual support, form, through their combination, the public\r\nliberties.--In this case, only one body being represented, its deputies\r\nare neither directed nor tempted to make concession to others; the\r\ninterest of the body is their sole guide; they subordinate the common\r\ninterest to it and serve it at any cost, even to criminal attacks on the\r\npublic welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Influence of the Nobles..\r\n\r\n     Regulations in their favor.--Preferment obtained by them in\r\n     the Church.--Distribution of bishoprics and abbeys.\r\n     --Preferment obtained from them from the State.--Governments,\r\n     offices, sinecures, pensions, gratuities.--Instead of being\r\n     useful they are an expense.\r\n\r\nThus do public bodies work when, instead of being associated together,\r\nthey are separate. The same spectacle is apparent on contemplating\r\ncastes and associations; their isolation is the cause of their egoism.\r\nFrom the top to the bottom of the scale the legal and moral powers which\r\nshould represent the nation represent themselves only, while each one\r\nis busy in its own behalf at the expense of the nation. The nobility,\r\nin default of the right to meet together and to vote, exercises its\r\ninfluence, and, to know how it uses this, it is sufficient to read\r\nover the edicts and the Almanac. A regulation imposed on Marshal de\r\nSégur[1404]has just restored the old barrier, which excluded commoners\r\nfrom military rank, and thenceforward, to be a captain, it is necessary\r\nto prove four degrees of nobility. In like manner, in late days,\r\none must be a noble to be a master of requests, and it is secretly\r\ndetermined that in future \"all ecclesiastical property, from the\r\nhumblest priory to the richest abbeys, shall be reserved to the\r\nnobility.\" In fact, all the high places, ecclesiastic or laic, are\r\ntheirs; all the sinecures, ecclesiastic or laic, are theirs, or for\r\ntheir relations, adherents, protégés, and servitors. France[1405] is\r\nlike a vast stable in which the blood-horses obtain double and\r\ntriple rations for doing nothing, or for only half-work, whilst the\r\ndraft-horses perform full service on half a ration, and that often not\r\nsupplied. Again, it must be noted, that among these blood-horses is a\r\nprivileged circle which, born near the manger, keeps its fellows away\r\nand feeds bountifully, fat, shining, with their skins polished, and up\r\nto their bellies in litter, and with no other occupation than that of\r\nappropriating everything to themselves. These are the court nobles, who\r\nlive within reach of favors, brought up from infancy to ask for them,\r\nto obtain and to ask again, solely attentive to royal condescension and\r\nfrowns, for whom the OEil de boeuf[1406] forms the universe. They are\r\nas \"indifferent to the affairs of the State as to their own affairs,\r\nallowing one to be governed by provincial intendants as they allowed he\r\nother to be governed by their own intendants.\"\r\n\r\nLet us contemplate them at work on the budget. We know how large that\r\nof the church is; I estimate that they absorb at east one-half of it.\r\nNineteen chapters of male nobles, twenty-five chapters of female\r\nnobles, two hundred and sixty commanderies of Malta belong to them by\r\ninstitution. They occupy, by favor, all the archbishoprics, and,\r\nexcept five, all the bishoprics.[1407] They furnish three out of four\r\nabbés-commendatory and vicars-general. If, among the abbeys of females\r\nroyally nominated, we set apart those bringing in twenty thousand livres\r\nand more, we find that they all have ladies of rank for abbesses. One\r\nfact alone shows the extent of these favors: I have counted eighty-three\r\nabbeys of men possessed by the almoners, chaplains, preceptors or\r\nreaders to the king, queen, princes, and princesses; one of them, the\r\nabbé de Vermont, has 80,000 livres income in benefices. In short, the\r\nfifteen hundred ecclesiastical sinecures under royal appointment, large\r\nor small, constitute a flow of money for the service of the great,\r\nwhether they pour it out in golden rain to recompense the assiduity\r\nof their intimates and followers, or keep it in large reservoirs to\r\nmaintain the dignity of their rank. Besides, according to the fashion\r\nof giving more to those who have already enough, the richest prelates\r\npossess, above their episcopal revenues, the wealthiest abbeys.\r\nAccording to the Almanac, M. d'Argentré, bishop of Séez,[1408] thus\r\nenjoys an extra income of 34,000 livres; M. de Suffren, bishop\r\nof Sisteron, 36,000; M. de Girac, bishop of Rennes, 40,000; M. de\r\nBourdeille, bishop of Soissons, 42,000; M. d'Agout de Bonneval, bishop\r\nof Pamiers, 45,000; M. de Marboeuf bishop of Autun, 50,000; M. de\r\nRohan, bishop of Strasbourg, 60,000; M. de Cicé, archbishop of Bordeaux,\r\n63,000; M. de Luynes, archbishop of Sens, 82,000; M. de Bernis,\r\narchbishop of Alby, 100,000; M. de Brienne, archbishop of Toulouse,\r\nl06,000; M. de Dillon, archbishop of Narbonne, 120,000; M. de\r\nLarochefoucauld, archbishop of Rouen, 130,000; that is to say, double\r\nand sometimes triple the sums stated, and quadruple, and often six times\r\nas much, according to the present standard. M. de Rohan derived from\r\nhis abbeys, not 60,000 livres but 400,000, and M. de Brienne, the most\r\nopulent of all, next to M. de Rohan, the 24th of August, 1788, at the\r\ntime of leaving the ministry,[1409] sent to withdraw from the treasury\r\n\"the 20,000 livres of his month's salary which had not yet fallen due,\r\na punctuality the more remarkable that, without taking into account the\r\nsalary of his place, with the 6,000 livres pension attached to his blue\r\nribbon, he possessed, in benefices, 678,000 livres income, and that,\r\nstill quite recently, a cutting of wood on one of his abbey domains\r\nyielded him a million.\"\r\n\r\nLet us pass on to the lay budget; here also are prolific sinecures,\r\nand almost all belong to the nobles. Of this class there are in the\r\nprovinces the thirty-seven great governments-general, the seven small\r\ngovernments-general, the sixty-six lieutenancies-general, the four\r\nhundred and seven special governments, the thirteen governorships of\r\nroyal palaces, and a number of others, all of them for ostentation and\r\nempty honors. They are all in the hands of the nobles, all lucrative,\r\nnot only through salaries paid by the treasury, but also through\r\nlocal profits. Here, again, the nobility allowed itself to evade\r\nthe authority, the activity and the usefulness of its charge on the\r\ncondition of retaining its title, pomp and money.[1410] The intendant is\r\nreally the governor; \"the titular governor, exercising a function with\r\nspecial letters of command,\" is only there to give dinners; and again he\r\nmust have permission to do that, \"the permission to go and reside at\r\nhis place of government.\" The place, however, yields fruit. The\r\ngovernment-general of Berry is worth 35,000 livres income, that of\r\nGuyenne 120,000, that of Languedoc 160,000; a small special government,\r\nlike that of Havre, brings in 35,000 livres, besides the accessories;\r\na medium lieutenancy-general, like that of Roussillon, 13,000 to 14,000\r\nlivres; one special government from 12,000 to 18,000 livres; and observe\r\nthat, in the Isle of France alone, there are thirty-four, at Vervins,\r\nSenlis, Melun, Fontainebleau, Dourdan, Sens, Limours, Etampes, Dreux,\r\nHoudan and other towns as insignificant as they are pacific; it is the\r\nstaff of the Valois dynasty which, since the time of Richelieu, has\r\nceased to perform any service, but which the treasury continues to\r\npay.--Consider these sinecures in one province alone, in Languedoc, a\r\ncountry with its own provincial assembly, which ought to provide some\r\nprotection the taxpayer's purse. There are three sub-commandants at\r\nTournon, Alais, and Montpelier, \"each one paid 16,000 livres, although\r\nwithout any functions since their places were established at the time of\r\nthe religious wars and troubles, to keep down the Protestants.\" Twelve\r\nroyal lieutenants are equally useless, and only for parade. The same\r\nwith three lieutenants-general, each one \"receiving in his turn, every\r\nthree years, a gratuity of 30,000 livres, for services rendered in the\r\nsaid province. These are vain and chimerical, they are not specified\"\r\nbecause none of them reside there, and, if they are paid, it is to\r\nsecure their support at the court. \"Thus the Comte de Caraman, who has\r\nmore than 600,000 livres income as proprietor of the Languedoc canal,\r\nreceives 30,000 livres every three years, without legitimate cause, and\r\nindependently of frequent and ample gifts which the province awards\r\nto him for repairs on his canal.\"--The province likewise gives to the\r\ncommandant, Comte de Périgord, a gratuity of 12,000 livres in addition\r\nto his salary, and to his wife another gratuity of 12,000 livres on her\r\nhonoring the states for the first time with her presence. It again pays,\r\nfor the same commandant, forty guards, \"of which twenty-four only\r\nserve during his short appearance at the Assembly,\" and who, with their\r\ncaptain, annually cost 15,000 livres. It pays likewise for the Governor\r\nfrom eighty to one hundred guards, \"who each receive 300 or 400 livres,\r\nbesides many exemptions, and who are never on service, since the\r\nGovernor is a non-resident.\" The expense of these lazy subalterns is\r\nabout 24,000 livres, besides 5,000 to 6,000 for their captain, to which\r\nmust be added 7,500 for gubernatorial secretaries, besides 60,000 livres\r\nsalaries, and untold profits for the Governor himself. I find everywhere\r\nsecondary idlers swarming in the shadow of idlers in chief,[1411] and\r\nderiving their vigor from the public purse which is the common nurse.\r\nAll these people parade and drink and eat copiously, in grand style; it\r\nis their principal service, and they attend to it conscientiously. The\r\nsessions of the Assembly are junketings of six weeks' duration, in which\r\nthe intendant expends 25,000 livres in dinners and receptions.[1412]\r\n\r\nEqually lucrative and useless are the court offices[1413], so many\r\ndomestic sinecures, the profits and accessories of which largely exceed\r\nthe emoluments. I find in the printed register 295 cooks, without\r\ncounting the table-waiters of the king and his people, while \"the head\r\nbutler obtains 84,000 livres a year in billets and supplies,\" without\r\ncounting his salary and the \"grand liveries\" which he receives in money.\r\nThe head chambermaids to the queen, inscribed in the Almanac for 150\r\nlivres and paid 12,000 francs, make in reality 50,000 francs by the sale\r\nof the candles lighted during the day. Augeard, private secretary, and\r\nwhose place is set down at 900 livres a year, confesses that it is worth\r\nto him 200,000. The head huntsman at Fontainebleau sells for his own\r\nbenefit each year 20,000 francs worth of rabbits. \"On each journey to\r\nthe king's country residences the ladies of the bedchamber gain eighty\r\nper cent on the expenses of moving; it is said that the coffee and bread\r\nfor each of these ladies costs 2,000 francs a year, and so on with other\r\nthings.\" \"Mme. de Tallard made 115,000 livres income out of her place\r\nof governess to the children of France, because her salary was increased\r\n35,000 livres for each child.\" The Duc de Penthièvre, as grand admiral,\r\nreceived an anchorage due on all vessels \"entering the ports and rivers\r\nof France,\" which produced annually 91,484 francs. Mme. de Lamballe,\r\nsuperintendent of the queen's household, inscribed for 6,000 francs,\r\ngets 50,000.[1414] The Duc de Gèvres gets 50,000 crowns[1415] by one\r\nshow of fireworks out of the fragments and scaffolding which belong\r\nto him by virtue of his office.[1416]--Grand officers of the\r\npalace, governors of royal establishments, captains of captaincies,\r\nchamberlains, equerries, gentlemen in waiting, gentlemen in ordinary,\r\npages, governors, almoners, chaplains, ladies of honor, ladies of the\r\nbedchamber, ladies in waiting on the King, the Queen, on Monsieur, on\r\nMadame, on the Comte D'Artois, on the Comtesse D'Artois, on Mesdames, on\r\nMadame Royale, on Madame Elisabeth, in each princely establishment and\r\nelsewhere, hundreds of places provided with salaries and accessories are\r\nwithout any service to perform, or simply answer a decorative purpose.\r\n\"Mme. de Laborde has just been appointed keeper of the queen's bed, with\r\n12,000 francs pension out of the king's privy purse; nothing is known\r\nof the duties of this position, as there has been no place of this kind\r\nsince Anne of Austria.\" The eldest son of M. de Machault is appointed\r\nintendant of the classes. \"This is one of the employments called\r\ncomplimentary: it is worth 18,000 livres income to sign one's name twice\r\na year.\" And likewise with the post of secretary-general of the Swiss\r\nguards, worth 30,000 livres a year and assigned to the Abbé Barthélemy;\r\nand the same with the post of secretary-general of the dragoons, worth\r\n20,000 livres a year, held in turn by Gentil Bernard and by Laujon, two\r\nsmall pocket poets.?--It would be simpler to give the money without the\r\nplace. There is, indeed, no end to them. On reading various memoirs\r\nday after day it seems as if the treasury was open to plunder. The\r\ncourtiers, unremitting in their attentions to the king, force him to\r\nsympathize with their troubles. They are his intimates, the guests of\r\nhis drawing-room; men of the same stamp as himself, his natural clients,\r\nthe only ones with whom he can converse, and whom it is necessary\r\nto make contented; he cannot avoid helping them. He must necessarily\r\ncontribute to the dowries of their children since he has signed\r\ntheir marriage contracts; he must necessarily enrich them since their\r\nprofusion serves for the embellishment of his court. Nobility being one\r\nof the glories of the throne, the occupant of the throne is obliged\r\nto regild it as often as is necessary.[1417] In this connection\r\na few figures and anecdotes among a thousand speak most\r\neloquently.[1418]--\"The Prince de Pons had a pension of 25,000 livres,\r\nout of the king's bounty, on which his Majesty was pleased to give 6,000\r\nto Mme. de Marsan, his daughter, Canoness of Remiremont. The family\r\nrepresented to the king the bad state of the Prince de Pons's affairs,\r\nand his Majesty was pleased to grant to his son Prince Camille, 15,000\r\nlivres of the pension vacated by the death of his father, and 5,000\r\nlivres increase to Mme. de Marsan.\"--M. de Conflans espouses Mlle.\r\nPortail. \"In honor of this marriage the king was pleased to order\r\nthat out of the pension of 10,000 livres granted to Mme. la Presidente\r\nPortail, 6,000 of it should pass to M. de Conflans after the death of\r\nMme. Portail.\"--M. de Séchelles, a retiring minister, \"had 12,000 livres\r\non an old pension which the king continued; he has, besides this, 20,000\r\nlivres pension as minister; and the king gives him in addition to\r\nall this a pension of 40,000 livres.\" The motives, which prompt these\r\nfavors, are often remarkable. M. de Rouillé has to be consoled for\r\nnot having participated in the treaty of Vienna; this explains why \"a\r\npension of 6,000 livres is given to his niece, Mme. de Castellane,\r\nand another of 10,000 to his daughter, Mme. de Beuvron, who is very\r\nrich.\"--\"M. de Puisieux enjoys about 76,000 or 77,000 livres income from\r\nthe bounty of the king; it is true that he has considerable property,\r\nbut the revenue of this property is uncertain, being for the most part\r\nin vines.\"--\"A pension of 10,000 livres has just been awarded to the\r\nMarquise de Lède because she is disagreeable to Mme. Infante, and to\r\nsecure her resignation.\"--The most opulent stretch out their hands and\r\ntake accordingly. \"It is estimated that last week 128,000 livres in\r\npensions were bestowed on ladies of the court, while for the past two\r\nyears the officers have not received the slightest pension: 8,000 livres\r\nto the Duchesse de Chevreuse, whose husband has an income of 500,000\r\nlivres; 12,000 livres to Mme. de Luynes, that she may not be jealous;\r\n10,000 to the Duchesse de Brancas; 10,000 to the dowager Duchesse de\r\nBrancas, mother of the preceding,\" etc. At the head of these leeches\r\ncome the princes of the blood. \"The king has just given 1,500,000 livres\r\nto M. le Prince de Conti to pay his debts, 1,000,000 of which is under\r\nthe pretext of indemnifying him for the injury done him by the sale of\r\nOrange, and 500,000 livres as a gratuity.\" \"The Duc d'Orléans formerly\r\nhad 50,000 crowns pension, as a poor man, and awaiting his father's\r\ninheritance. This event making him rich, with an income of more than\r\n3,000,000 livres, he gave up his pension. But having since represented\r\nto the king that his expenditure exceeded his income, the king gave him\r\nback his 50,000 crowns.\"--Twenty years later, in 1780, when Louis XVI.,\r\ndesirous of relieving the treasury, signs \"the great reformation of the\r\ntable, 600,000 livres are given to Mesdames for their tables.\" This is\r\nwhat the dinners, cut down, of three old ladies, cost the public! For\r\nthe king's two brothers, 8,300,000 livres, besides 2,000,000 income\r\nin appanages; for the Dauphin, Madame Royale, Madame Elisabeth, and\r\nMesdames 3,500,000 livres; for the queen, 4,000,000: such is the\r\nstatement of Necker in 1784. Add to this the casual donations, admitted\r\nor concealed; 200,000 francs to M. de Sartines, to aid him in paying his\r\ndebts; 200,000 to M. Lamoignon, keeper of the seals; 100,000 to M. de\r\nMiromesnil for expenses in establishing himself; 166,000 to the widow of\r\nM. de Maurepas; 400,000 to the Prince de Salm; 1,200,000 to the Duc de\r\nPolignac for the pledge of the county Fenestranges; 754,337 to Mesdames\r\nto pay for Bellevue.[1419] M. de Calonne,\" says Augeard, a reliable\r\nwitness,[1420] \"scarcely entered on his duties, raised a loan of\r\n100,000,000 livres, one-quarters of which did not find its way into\r\nthe royal treasury; the rest was eaten up by people at the court; his\r\ndonations to the Comte Artois are estimated at 56,000,000; the portion\r\nof Monsieur is 5,000,000; he gave to the Prince de Condé, in exchange\r\nfor 300,000 livres income, 12,000,000 paid down and 600,000 livres\r\nannuity, and he causes the most burdensome acquisition to be made for\r\nthe State, in exchanges of which the damage is more than five to one.\"\r\nWe must not forget that in actual rates all these donations, pensions,\r\nand salaries are worth double the amount.--Such is the use of the great\r\nin relation to the central power; instead of constituting themselves\r\nrepresentatives of the people, they aimed to be the favorites of the\r\nSovereign, and they shear the flock which they ought to preserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n     Isolation of the Chiefs--Sentiments of subordinates\r\n     --Provincial nobility--The Curates.\r\n\r\nThe fleeced flock is to discover finally what is done with its wool.\r\n\"Sooner or later,\" says a parliament of 1764,[1421] \"the people will\r\nlearn that the remnants of our finances continue be wasted in donations\r\nwhich are frequently undeserved; in excessive and multiplied pensions\r\nfor the same persons; in dowries and promises of dowry, and in useless\r\noffices and salaries.\" Sooner or later they will thrust back \"these\r\ngreedy hands which are always open and never full; that insatiable\r\ncrowd which seems to be born only to seize all and possess nothing,\r\nand pitiless as it is shameless.\"--And when this day arrives the\r\nextortioners will find that they stand alone. For the characteristic of\r\nan aristocracy which cares only for itself is to live aloof in a closed\r\ncircle. Having forgotten the public, it also neglects its subordinates;\r\nafter being separated from the nation it separates itself from its own\r\nadherents. Like a group of staff-officers on furlough, it indulges in\r\nSports without giving itself further concern about inferior officers;\r\nwhen the hour of battle comes nobody will march under its orders, and\r\nchieftains are sought elsewhere. Such is the isolation of the seigniors\r\nof the court and of the prelates among the lower grades of the nobility\r\nand the clergy; they appropriate to themselves too large a share, and\r\ngive nothing, or almost nothing, to the people who are not of their\r\nsociety. For a century a steady murmur against them rising, and goes on\r\nexpanding until it becomes an uproar, which the old and the new spirit,\r\nfeudal ideas and philosophic ideas, threaten in unison. \"I see,\" said\r\nthe bailiff of Mirabeau,[1422] \"that the nobility is demeaning\r\nitself and becoming a wreck. It is extended to all those children of\r\nbloodsuckers, the vagabonds of finance, introduced by La Pompadour,\r\nherself the spring of this foulness. One portion of it demeans itself in\r\nits servility to the court; the other portion is amalgamated with that\r\nquill-driving rabble who are converting the blood of the king's subjects\r\ninto ink; another perishes stifled beneath vile robes, the ignoble atoms\r\nof cabinet-dust which an office drags up out of the mire;\" and all,\r\nparvenus of the old or of the new stock, form a band called the court,\r\n'The court!\" exclaims D'Argenson. \"The entire evil is found in this\r\nword, The court has become the senate of the nation; the least of\r\nthe valets at Versailles is a senator; chambermaids take part in\r\nthe government, if not to legislate, at least to impede laws and\r\nregulations; and by dint of hindrance there are no longer either laws,\r\nor rules, or law-makers. . . . Under Henry IV courtiers remained each\r\none at home; they had not entered into ruinous expenditure to belong to\r\nthe court; favors were not thus due to them as at the present day. . .\r\nThe court is the sepulcher of the nation.\" Many noble officers, finding\r\nthat high grades are only for courtiers, abandon the service, and betake\r\nthemselves with their discontent to their estates. Others, who have\r\nnot left their domains, brood there in discomfort, idleness, and ennui,\r\ntheir ambition embittered by their powerlessness. In 1789, says the\r\nMarquis de Ferrières, most of them \"are so weary of the court and of the\r\nministers, they are almost democrats.\" At least, \"they want to withdraw\r\nthe government from the ministerial oligarchy in whose hands it is\r\nconcentrated;\" there are no grand seigniors for deputies; they set them\r\naside and \"absolutely reject them, saying that they would traffic with\r\nthe interests of the nobles;\" they themselves, in their registers,\r\ninsist that there be no more court nobility.\r\n\r\nThe same sentiments prevail among the lower clergy, and still more\r\nactively; for they are excluded from the high offices, not only as\r\ninferiors, but also as commoner.[1423] Already, in 1766, the Marquis\r\nde Mirabeau writes: \"It would be an insult to most of our pretentious\r\necclesiastics to offer them a curacy. Revenues and honors are for the\r\nabbés-commendatory, for tonsured beneficiaries not in orders, for the\r\nnumerous chapters (of nobility).\" On the contrary, \"the true pastors\r\nof souls, the collaborators in the holy ministry, scarcely obtain a\r\nsubsistence.\" The first class \"drawn from the nobility and from the\r\nbest of the bourgeoisie have pretensions only, without being of the true\r\nministry. The other, only having duties to fulfill without expectations\r\nand almost without income. . . can be recruited only from the lowest\r\nranks of civil society,\" while the parasites who despoil the laborers\r\n\"affect to subjugate them and to degrade them more and more.\" \"I pity,\"\r\nsaid Voltaire, \"the lot of a country curate, obliged to contend for a\r\nsheaf of wheat with his unfortunate parishioner, to plead against him,\r\nto exact the tithe of peas and lentils, to waste his miserable existence\r\nin constant strife. . . . I pity still more the curate with a fixed\r\nallowance to whom monks, called gros decimateurs[1424] dare offer a\r\nsalary of forty ducats, to go about during the year, two or three miles\r\nfrom his home, day and night, in sunshine and in rain, in the snow and\r\nin the ice, exercising the most trying and most disagreeable functions.\"\r\nAttempts are made for thirty years to secure their salaries and raise\r\nthem a little; in case of their inadequacy the beneficiary, collator\r\nor tithe-owner of the parish is required to add to them until the curê\r\nobtains 500 livres (1768), then 700 livres (1785), the vicar 200 livres\r\n(1768), then 250 (1778), and finally 350 (1785). Strictly, at the prices\r\nat which things are, a man may support himself on that.[1425] But he\r\nmust live among the destitute to whom he owes alms, and he cherishes at\r\nthe bottom of his heart a secret bitterness towards the indolent Dives\r\nwho, with full pockets, dispatches him, with empty pockets, on a mission\r\nof charity. At Saint-Pierre de Barjouville, in the Toulousain, the\r\narchbishop of Toulouse appropriates to himself one-half of the tithes\r\nand gives away eight livres a year in alms. At Bretx, the chapter\r\nof Isle Jourdain, which retains one-half of certain tithes and\r\nthree-quarters of others, gives ten livres; at Croix Falgarde, the\r\nBenedictines, to whom a half of the tithes belong, give ten livres\r\nper annum.[1426] At Sainte-Croix de Bernay in Normandy,[1427] the\r\nnon-resident abbé, who receives 57,000 livres gives 1,050 livres to the\r\ncurate without a parsonage, whose parish contains 4,000 communicants. At\r\nSaint-Aubin-sur-Gaillon, the abbé, a gros décimateur, gives 350\r\nlivres to the vicar, who is obliged to go into the village and obtain\r\ncontributions of flour, bread and apples. At Plessis Hébert, \"the\r\nsubstitute deportuaire,[1428] not having enough to live on is obliged\r\nto get his meals in the houses of neighboring curates.\" In Artois, where\r\nthe tithes are often seven and a half and eight per cent. on he product\r\nof the soil, a number of curates have a fixed rate and no parsonage;\r\ntheir church goes to ruin and the beneficiary gives nothing to the poor.\r\n\"At Saint-Laurent, in Normandy, the curacy is worth not more than 400\r\nlivres, which the curate shares with an obitier,[1429] and there are 500\r\ninhabitants, three quarters of whom receive alms.\" As the repairs on a\r\nparsonage or on a church are usually at the expense of a seignior or of\r\na beneficiary often far off, and in debt or indifferent, it sometimes\r\nhappens that the priest does not know where to lodge, or to say mass. \"I\r\narrived,\" says a curate of the Touraine, \"in the month of June, 1788. .\r\n. . The parsonage would resemble a hideous cave were it not open to all\r\nthe winds and the frosts. Below there are two rooms with stone floors,\r\nwithout doors or windows, and five feet high; a third room six feet\r\nhigh, paved with stone, serves as parlor, hall, kitchen, wash-house,\r\nbakery, and sink for the water of the court and garden. Above are three\r\nsimilar rooms, the whole cracking and tumbling in ruins, absolutely\r\nthreatening to fail, without either doors and windows that hold.\" And,\r\nin 1790, the repairs are not yet made. See, by way of contrast, the\r\nluxury of the prelates possessing half a million income, the pomp of\r\ntheir palaces, the hunting equipment of M. de Dillon, bishop of Evreux,\r\nthe confessionals lined with satin of M. de Barral, bishop of Troyes,\r\nand the innumerable culinary utensils in massive silver of M. de Rohan,\r\nbishop of Strasbourg.--Such is the lot of curates at the established\r\nrates, and there are \"a great many\" who do not get the established\r\nrates, withheld from them through the ill-will of the higher clergy;\r\nwho, with their perquisites, get only from 400 to 500 livres, and who\r\nvainly ask for the meager pittance to which they are entitled by the\r\nlate edict. \"Should not such a request,\" says a curate, \"be willingly\r\ngranted by Messieurs of the upper clergy who suffer monks to enjoy from\r\n5 to 6,000 livres income each person, whilst they see curates, who are\r\nat least as necessary, reduced to the lighter portion, as little for\r\nthemselves as for their parish?\"--And they yet gnaw on this slight\r\npittance to pay the free gift. In this, as in the rest, the poor are\r\ncharged to discharge the rich. In the diocese of Clermont, \"the curates,\r\neven with the simple fixed rates, are subject to a tax of 60, 80, 100,\r\n120 livres and even more; the vicars, who live only by the sweat of\r\ntheir brows, are taxed 22 livres.\" The prelates, on the contrary, pay\r\nbut little, and \"it is still a custom to present bishops on New-Year's\r\nday with a receipt for their taxes.\"[1430]--There is no escape for\r\nthe curates. Save two or three small bishoprics of \"lackeys,\" all the\r\ndignities of the church are reserved to the nobles; \"to be a bishop\r\nnowadays,\" says one of them, \"a man must be a gentleman.\" I regard them\r\nas sergeants who, like their fellows in the army, have lost all hope of\r\nbecoming officers.--Hence there are some whose anger bursts its bounds:\r\n\"We, unfortunate curates at fixed rates; we, commonly assigned to the\r\nlargest parishes, like my own which, for two leagues in the woods,\r\nincludes hamlets that would form another; we, whose lot makes even\r\nthe stones and beams of our miserable dwellings cry aloud,\" we have\r\nto endure prelates \"who would still, through their forest-keepers,\r\nprosecute a poor curate for cutting a stick in their forests, his sole\r\nsupport on his long journeys over the road.\" On their passing, the poor\r\nman \"is obliged to jump close against a slope to protect himself from\r\nthe feet and the spattering of the horses, as likewise from the wheels\r\nand, perhaps, the whip of an insolent coachman,\" and then, \"begrimed\r\nwith dirt, with his stick in one hand and his hat, such as it is, in\r\nthe other, he must salute, humbly and quickly, through the door of the\r\nclose, gilded carriage, the counterfeit hierophant who is snoring on\r\nthe wool of the flock the poor curate is feeding, and of which he merely\r\nleaves him the dung and the grease.\" The whole letter is one long cry of\r\nrage; it is rancor of this stamp which is to fashion Joseph Lebons and\r\nFouchés.--In this situation and with these sentiments it is evident\r\nthat the lower clergy will treat its chiefs as the provincial nobility\r\ntreated theirs.[1431] They will not select \"for representatives those\r\nwho swim in opulence and who have always regarded their sufferings with\r\ntranquility.\" The curates, on all sides \"will confederate together\"\r\nto send only curates to the States-General, and to exclude \"not only\r\ncanons, abbés, priors and other beneficiaries, but again the principal\r\nsuperiors, the heads of the hierarchy,\" that is to say, the bishops. In\r\nfact, in the States-General, out of three hundred clerical deputies we\r\ncount two hundred and eight curates, and, like the provincial nobles,\r\nthese bring along with them the distrust and the ill-will which they\r\nhave so long entertained against their chiefs. Events are soon to prove\r\nthis. If the first two orders are constrained to combine against the\r\ncommunes it is at the critical moment when the curates withdraw. If\r\nthe institution of an upper chamber is rejected it is owing to the\r\ncommonalty of the gentry (la plèbe des gentilshommes) being unwilling to\r\nallow the great families a prerogative which they have abused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The King's Incompetence and Generosity.\r\n\r\n     The most privileged of all--Having monopolized all powers,\r\n     he takes upon himself their functional activity--The burden\r\n     of this task--He evades it or is incompetent--His\r\n     conscience at ease--France is his property--How he abuses\r\n     it--Royalty the center of abuses.\r\n\r\nOne privilege remains the most considerable of all, that of the king;\r\nfor, in his staff of hereditary nobles he is the hereditary general.\r\nHis office, indeed, is not a sinecure, like their rank; but it involves\r\nquite as grave disadvantages and worse temptations. Two things are\r\npernicious to Man, the lack of occupation and the lack of restraint;\r\nneither inactivity nor omnipotence are in harmony with his nature. The\r\nabsolute prince who is all-powerful, like the listless aristocracy with\r\nnothing to do, in the end become useless and mischievous.--In grasping\r\nall powers the king insensibly took upon himself all functions; an\r\nimmense undertaking and one surpassing human strength. For it is\r\nthe Monarchy, and not the Revolution, which endowed France with\r\nadministrative centralization [1432]. Three functionaries, one above\r\nthe other, manage all public business under the direction of the king's\r\ncouncil; the comptroller-general at the center, the intendant in\r\neach generalship,[1433] the sub-delegate in each election, fixing,\r\napportioning and levying taxes and the militia, laying out and building\r\nhighways, employing the national police force, distributing succor,\r\nregulating cultivation, imposing their tutelage on the parishes,\r\nand treating municipal magistrates as valets. \"A village,\" says\r\nTurgot,[1434] \"is simply an assemblage of houses and huts, and of\r\ninhabitants equally passive. . . . Your Majesty is obliged to decide\r\nwholly by yourself or through your mandataries. . . . Each awaits your\r\nspecial instructions to contribute to the public good, to respect the\r\nrights of others, and even sometimes to exercise his own.\" Consequently,\r\nadds Necker, \"the government of France is carried on in the bureaux.\r\n. . .The clerks, relishing their influence, never fail to persuade\r\nthe minister that he cannot separate himself from command in a single\r\ndetail.\" Bureaucratic at the center, arbitrariness, exceptions and\r\nfavors everywhere, such is a summary of the system. \"Sub-delegates,\r\nofficers of elections, receivers and comptrollers of the vingtièmes,\r\ncommissaires and collectors of the tailles, officers of the salt-tax,\r\nprocess-servers, voituriers-buralistes, overseers of the corvées, clerks\r\nof the excise, of the registry, and of dues reserved, all these men\r\nbelonging to the tax-service. Each of these will, aided by his\r\nfiscal knowledge and petty authority, so overwhelm the ignorant and\r\ninexperienced tax payer that he does not recognize that he is being\r\ncheated.\" [1435] A rude species of centralization with no control over\r\nit, with no publicity, without uniformity, thus installs over the whole\r\ncountry an army of petty pashas who, as judges, decide causes in which\r\nthey are themselves contestants, ruling by delegation, and, to sanction\r\ntheir theft or their insolence, always having on their lips the name of\r\nthe king, who is obliged to let them do as they please.--In short, the\r\nmachine, through its complexity, irregularity, and dimensions, escapes\r\nfrom his grasp. A Frederick II. who rises at four o'clock in the\r\nmorning, a Napoleon who dictates half the night in his bath, and who\r\nworks eighteen hours a day, would scarcely suffice for its needs. Such\r\na régime cannot operate without constant strain, without indefatigable\r\nenergy, without infallible discernment, without military rigidity,\r\nwithout superior genius; on these conditions alone can one convert\r\ntwenty-five millions of men into automatons and substitute his own will,\r\nlucid throughout, coherent throughout and everywhere present, for the\r\nwills of those he abolishes. Louis XV lets \"the good machine\" work by\r\nitself, while he settles down into apathy. \"They would have it so,\r\nthey thought it all for the best,\"[1436] is his manner of speaking when\r\nministerial measures prove unsuccessful. \"If I were a lieutenant of\r\nthe police,\" he would say again, \"I would prohibit cabs.\" In vain is\r\nhe aware of the machine being dislocated, for he can do nothing and he\r\ncauses nothing to be done. In the event of misfortune he has a private\r\nreserve, his purse apart. \"The king,\" said Mme. de Pompadour, \"would\r\nsign away a million without thinking of it, but he would scarcely bestow\r\na hundred louis out of his own little treasury.\"--Louis XVI strives for\r\nsome time to remove some of the wheels, to introduce better ones and to\r\nreduce the friction of the rest; but the pieces are too rusty, and too\r\nweighty. He cannot adjust them, or harmonize them and keep them in their\r\nplaces; his hand falls by his side wearied and powerless. He is content\r\nto practice economy himself; he records in his journal the mending of\r\nhis watch, and leaves the State carriage in the hands of Calonne to be\r\nloaded with fresh abuses that it may revert back to the old rut from\r\nwhich it is to issue only by breaking down.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the wrong they do, or which is done in their name,\r\ndissatisfies the kings and upsets them, but, at the bottom, their\r\nconscience is not disturbed. They may feel compassion for the people,\r\nbut they do not feel guilty; they are its sovereigns and not its\r\nrepresentatives. France, to them, is as a domain to its lord, and a lord\r\nis not deprived of honor in being prodigal and neglectful. He merely\r\ngambles away his own property, and nobody has a right to call him\r\nto account. Founded on feudal society, royalty is like an estate, an\r\ninheritance. It would be infidelity, almost treachery in a prince,\r\nin any event weak and base, should he allow any portion of the trust\r\nreceived by him intact from his ancestors for transmission to his\r\nchildren, to pass into the hands of his subjects. Not only according\r\nto medieval traditions is he proprietor-commandant of the French and of\r\nFrance, but again, according to the theory of the jurists, he is,\r\nlike Caesar, the sole and perpetual representative of the nation,\r\nand, according to the theological doctrine, like David, the sacred and\r\nspecial delegate of God himself. It would be astonishing, if, with all\r\nthese titles, he did not consider the public revenue as his personal\r\nrevenue, and if, in many cases, he did not act accordingly. Our point of\r\nview, in this matter, is so essentially opposed to his, we can scarcely\r\nput ourselves in his place; but at that time his point of view was\r\neverybody's point of view. It seemed, then, as strange to meddle with\r\nthe king's business as to meddle with that of a private person. Only\r\nat the end of the year 1788[1437] the famous salon of the Palais-Royal\r\n\"with boldness and unimaginable folly, asserts that in a true monarchy\r\nthe revenues of the State should not be at the sovereign's disposition;\r\nthat he should be granted merely a sum sufficient to defray the expenses\r\nof his establishment, of his donations, and for favors to his servants\r\nas well as for his pleasures, while the surplus should be deposited\r\nin the royal treasury to be devoted only to purposes sanctioned by the\r\nNational Assembly. To reduce the sovereign to a civil list, to seize\r\nnine-tenths of his income, to forbid him cash on demand, what an\r\noutrage! The surprise would be no greater if at the present day it were\r\nproposed to divide the income of each millionaire into two portions, the\r\nsmallest to go for the owner's support, and the largest to be placed in\r\nthe hands of a government to be expended in works of public utility.\r\nAn old farmer-general, an intellectual and unprejudiced man, gravely\r\nattempts to justify the purchase of Saint-Cloud by calling it \"a ring\r\nfor the queen's finger.\" The ring cost, indeed, 7,700,000 francs, but\r\n\"the king of France then had an income of 447,000,000. What could be\r\nsaid of any private individual who, with 477,000 livres income, should,\r\nfor once in his life, give his wife diamonds worth 7,000 or 8,000\r\nlivres?\"[1438] People would say that the gift is moderate, and that the\r\nhusband is reasonable.\r\n\r\nTo properly understand the history of our kings, let the fundamental\r\nprinciple be always recognized that France is their land, a farm\r\ntransmitted from father to son, at first small, then slowly enlarged,\r\nand, at last, prodigiously enlarged, because the proprietor, always\r\nalert, has found means to make favorable additions to it at the expense\r\nof his neighbors; at the end of eight hundred years it comprises\r\nabout 27,000 square leagues of territory. His interests and his vanity\r\nharmonize, certainly, in several areas with public welfare; he is, all\r\nin all, not a poor administrator, and, since he has always expanded his\r\nterritory, he has done better than many others. Moreover, around him,\r\na number of expert individuals, old family councilors, withdrawn from\r\nbusiness and devoted to the domain, with good heads an gray beards,\r\nrespectfully remonstrate with him when he spends too freely; they often\r\ninterest him in public improvements, in roads, canals, homes for\r\nthe invalids, military schools, scientific institutions and charity\r\nworkshops; in the control of trust-funds and foundations, in the\r\ntolerance of heretics, in the postponement of monastic vows to the age\r\nof twenty-one, in provincial assemblies, and in other reforms by which\r\na feudal domain becomes transformed into a modern domain. Nevertheless,\r\nthe country, feudal or modern, remains his property, which he can abuse\r\nas well as use; however, whoever uses with full sway ends by abusing\r\nwith full license. If, in his ordinary conduct, personal motives do not\r\nprevail over public motives, he might be a saint like Louis IX, a stoic\r\nlike Marcus Aurelius, while remaining a seignior, a man of the\r\nworld like the people of his court, yet more badly brought up, worse\r\nsurrounded, more solicited, more tempted and more blindfolded. At the\r\nvery least he has, like them, his own vanity, his own tastes, his\r\nown relatives, his mistress, his wife, his friends, all intimate and\r\ninfluential solicitors who must first be satisfied, while the nation\r\nonly comes after them.--The result is, that, for a hundred years, from\r\n1672 to 1774, whenever he makes war it is through wounded pride, through\r\nfamily interest, through calculation of private advantages, or\r\nto gratify a woman. Louis XV maintains his wars yet worse than in\r\nundertaking them;\"[1439] while Louis XVI, during the whole of his\r\nforeign policy, finds himself hemmed in by the marriage he has made.--At\r\nhome the king lives like other nobles, but more grandly, because he is\r\nthe greatest lord in France; I shall describe his court presently, and\r\nfurther on we shall see by what exactions this pomp is made possible.\r\nIn the meantime let us note two or three details. According to authentic\r\nstatements, Louis XV expended on Mme. de Pompadour thirty-six millions\r\nof livres, which is at least seventy-two millions nowadays[1440]\r\nAccording to d'Argenson,[1441] in 1751, he has 4,000 horses in his\r\nstable, and we are assured that his household alone, or his person,\r\n\"cost this year 68,000,000,\" almost a quarter of the public revenue. Why\r\nbe astonished if we look upon the sovereign in the manner of the day,\r\nthat is to say, as a lord of the manor enjoying of his hereditary\r\nproperty? He constructs, he entertains, he gives festivals, he hunts,\r\nand he spends money according to his station. Moreover, being the\r\nmaster of his own funds, he gives to whomsoever he pleases, and all\r\nhis selections are favors. Abbé de Vermond writes to Empress Maria\r\nTheresa[1442]\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty knows better than myself, that, according to immemorial\r\ncustom, three-fourths of the places honors and pensions are awarded\r\nnot on account of services but out of favor and through influence. This\r\nfavor was originally prompted by birth, alliance and fortune; the\r\nfact is that it nearly always is based on patronage and intrigue. This\r\nprocedure is so well established, that is respected as a sort of justice\r\neven by those who suffer the most from it. A man of worth not able to\r\ndazzle by his court alliances, nor through a brilliant expenditure,\r\nwould not dare to demand a regiment, however ancient and illustrious\r\nhis services, or his birth. Twenty years ago, the sons of dukes and\r\nministers, of people attached to the court, of the relations and\r\nprotégés of mistresses, became colonels at the age of sixteen. M. de\r\nChoiseul caused loud complaints on extending this age to twenty-three\r\nyears. But to compensate favoritism and absolutism he assigned to\r\nthe pure grace of the king, or rather to that of his ministers, the\r\nappointment to the grades of lieutenant-colonel and major which, until\r\nthat time, belonged of right to priority of services in the government;\r\nalso the commands of provinces and of towns. You are aware that these\r\nplaces have been largely multiplied, and that they are bestowed through\r\nfavor and credit, like the regiments. The cordon bleu and the cordon\r\nrouge are in the like position, and abbeys are still more constantly\r\nsubject to the régime of influence. As to positions in the finances,\r\nI dare not allude to them. Appointments in the judiciary are the most\r\nconditioned by services rendered; and yet how much do not influence and\r\nrecommendation affect the nomination of intendants, first presidents\"\r\nand the others?\r\n\r\nNecker, entering on his duties, finds twenty-eight millions in pensions\r\npaid from the royal treasury, and, at his fall, there is an outflow of\r\nmoney showered by millions on the people of the court. Even during\r\nhis term of office the king allows himself to make the fortunes of his\r\nwife's friends of both sexes; the Countess de Polignac obtains 400,000\r\nfrancs to pay her debts, 100,000 francs dowry for her daughter, and,\r\nbesides, for herself, the promise of an estate of 35,000 livres income,\r\nand, for her lover, the Count de Vaudreil, a pension of 30,000 livres;\r\nthe Princess de Lamballe obtains 100,000 crowns per annum, as much for\r\nthe post of superintendent of the queen's household, which is revived\r\non her behalf, as for a position for her brother.[1443] The king is\r\nreproached for his parsimony; why should he be sparing of his purse?\r\nStarted on a course not his own, he gives, buys, builds, and exchanges;\r\nhe assists those belonging to his own society, doing everything in a\r\nstyle becoming to a grand seignior, that is to say, throwing money away\r\nby handfuls. One instance enables us to judge of this: in order to assist\r\nthe bankrupt Guéménée family, he purchases of them three estates for\r\nabout 12,500,000 livres, which they had just purchased for 4,000,000;\r\nmoreover, in exchange for two domains in Brittany, which produce 33,758\r\nlivres income, he makes over to them the principality of Dombes which\r\nproduces nearly 70,000 livres income.[1444]--When we come to read the\r\nRed Book further on we shall find 700,000 livres of pensions for the\r\nPolignac family, most of them revertible from one member to another, and\r\nnearly 2,000,000 of annual benefits to the Noailles family.--The king\r\nhas forgotten that his favors are mortal blows, \"the courtier\r\nwho obtains 6,000 livres pension, receiving the taille of six\r\nvillages.\"[1445] Each largess of the monarch, considering the state of\r\nthe taxes, is based on the privation of the peasants, the sovereign,\r\nthrough his clerks, taking bread from the poor to give coaches to the\r\nrich.--The center of the government, in short, is the center of the\r\nevil; all the wrongs and all the miseries start from it as from the\r\ncenter of pain and inflammation; here it is that the public abscess\r\ncomes to the head, and here will it break.[1446]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Latent Disorganization in France.\r\n\r\nSuch is the just and fatal effect of privileges turned to selfish\r\npurposes instead of being exercised for the advantage of others. To him\r\nwho utters the word, \"Sire or Seignior\" stands for the protector who\r\nfeeds, the ancient who leads.\"[1447] With such a title and for this\r\npurpose too much cannot be granted to him, for there is no more\r\ndifficult or more exalted post. But he must fulfill its duties;\r\notherwise in the day of peril he will be left to himself. Already,\r\nand long before the day arrives, his flock is no longer his own; if\r\nit marches onward it is through routine; it is simply a multitude of\r\npersons, but no longer an organized body. Whilst in Germany and in\r\nEngland the feudal régime, retained or transformed, still composes a\r\nliving society, in France[1448] its mechanical framework encloses only\r\nso many human particles. We still find the material order, but we\r\nno longer find the moral order of things. A lingering, deep-seated\r\nrevolution has destroyed the close hierarchical union of recognized\r\nsupremacies and of voluntary deference. It is like an army in which\r\nthe attitudes of chiefs and subordinates have disappeared; grades are\r\nindicated by uniforms only, but they have no hold on consciences. All\r\nthat constitutes a well-founded army, the legitimate ascendancy of\r\nofficers, the justified trust of soldiers, the daily interchange of\r\nmutual obligations, the conviction of each being useful to all, and\r\nthat the chiefs are the most useful all, is missing. How could it be\r\notherwise in an army whose staff-officers have no other occupation but\r\nto dine out, to display their epaulettes and to receive double pay? Long\r\nbefore the final crash France is in a state of dissolution, and she is\r\nin a state of dissolution because the privileged classes had forgotten\r\ntheir characters as public men.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1401: \"Rapport de l'agence du clergé,\" from 1775 to 1780, pp.\r\n31-34.--Ibid. from 1780 to 1785, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1402: Lanfrey, \"L'Eglise et les philosophes,\" passim.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1403: Boiteau, \"Etat de la France en 1789,\" pp. 205,\r\n207.--D'Argenson \"Mémoires,\" May 5, 1752, September 3, 22, 25, 1753;\r\nOctober 17, 1753, and October 26, 1775.--Prudhomme, \"Résumé général des\r\ncahiers des Etats-Généraux,\" 1789, (Registers of the Clergy).--\"Histoire\r\ndes églises du désert,\" par Charles Coquerel, I. 151 and those\r\nfollowing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1404: De Ségur, \"Mémoires,\" vol.

MORAL PRINCIPLES UNDER THE ANCIENT REGIME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court and a life of pomp and parade.\r\n\r\nA military staff on furlough for a century and more, around a\r\ncommander-in-chief who gives fashionable entertainment, is the principle\r\nand summary of the habits of society under the ancient régime. Hence, if\r\nwe seek to comprehend them we must first study them at their center\r\nand their source, that is to say, in the court itself. Like the whole\r\nancient régime the court is the empty form, the surviving adornment of\r\na military institution, the causes of which have disappeared while the\r\neffects remain, custom surviving utility. Formerly, in the early times\r\nof feudalism, in the companionship and simplicity of the camp and the\r\ncastle, the nobles served the king with their own hands. One providing\r\nfor his house, another bringing a dish to his table, another disrobing\r\nhim at night, and another looking after his falcons and horses. Still\r\nlater, under Richelieu and during the Fronde,[2101] amid the sudden\r\nattacks and the rude exigencies of constant danger they constitute the\r\ngarrison of his lodgings, forming an armed escort for him, and a retinue\r\nof ever-ready swordsmen. Now as formerly they are equally assiduous\r\naround his person, wearing their swords, awaiting a word, and eager\r\nto his bidding, while those of highest rank seemingly perform domestic\r\nservice in his household. Pompous parade, however, has been substituted\r\nfor efficient service; they are elegant adornments only and no longer\r\nuseful tools; they act along with the king who is himself an actor,\r\ntheir persons serving as royal decoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Versailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Physical aspect and the moral character of Versailles.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the decoration is successful, and, that since\r\nthe fêtes of the Italian Renaissance, more magnificent displays have\r\nnot been seen. Let us follow the file of carriages which, from Paris\r\nto Versailles, rolls steadily along like a river. Certain horses\r\ncalled \"des enragés,\" fed in a particular way, go and come in three\r\nhours.[2102] One feels, at the first glance, as if he were in a city\r\nof a particular stamp, suddenly erected and at one stroke, like a\r\nprize-medal for a special purpose, of which only one is made, its form\r\nbeing a thing apart, as well as its origin and use. In vain is it one\r\nof the largest cities of the kingdom, with its population of 80,000\r\nsouls;[2103] it is filled, peopled, and occupied by the life of a single\r\nman; it is simply a royal residence, arranged entirely to provide for\r\nthe wants, the pleasures, the service, the guardianship, the society,\r\nthe display of a king. Here and there, in corners and around it,\r\nare inns, stalls, taverns, hovels for laborers and for drudges, for\r\ndilapidated soldiers and accessory menials. These tenements necessarily\r\nexist, since technicians are essential to the most magnificent\r\napotheosis. The rest, however, consists of sumptuous hotels and\r\nedifices, sculptured façades, cornices and balustrades, monumental\r\nstairways, seigniorial architecture, regularly spaced and disposed, as\r\nin a procession, around the vast and grandiose palace where all this\r\nterminates. Here are the fixed abodes of the noblest families; to the\r\nright of the palace are the hôtels de Bourbon, d'Ecquervilly, de la\r\nTrémoille, de Condé, de Maurepas, de Bouillon, d'Eu, de Noailles, de\r\nPenthièvre, de Livry, du Comte de la Marche, de Broglie, du Prince de\r\nTingry, d'Orléans, de Chatillon, de Villerry, d'Harcourt, de Monaco;\r\non the left are the pavilions d'Orléans, d'Harcourt, the hôtels\r\nde Chevreuse, de Babelle, de l'Hôpital, d'Antin, de Dangeau, de\r\nPontchartrain--no end to their enumeration. Add to these those of Paris,\r\nall those which, ten leagues around. At Sceaux, at Génevilliers,\r\nat Brunoy, at Ile-Adam, at Rancy, at Saint-Ouen, at Colombes, at\r\nSaint-Germain, at Marly, at Bellevue, in countless places, they form a\r\ncrown of architectural flowers, from which daily issue as many gilded\r\nwasps to shine and buzz about Versailles, the center of all luster and\r\naffluence. About a hundred of these are \"presented each year, men and\r\nwomen, which makes about 2 or 3,000 in all;[2104] this forms the king's\r\nsociety, the ladies who courtesy before him, and the seigniors who\r\naccompany him in his carriage; their hotels are near by, or within\r\nreach, ready to fill his drawing room or his antechamber at all hours.\r\n\r\nA drawing room like this calls for proportionate dependencies; the\r\nhotels and buildings at Versailles devoted to the private service of the\r\nking and his attendants count by hundreds. No human existence since that\r\nof the Caesars has so spread itself out in the sunshine. In the Rue\r\ndes Reservoirs we have the old hotel and the new one of the governor\r\nof Versailles, the hotel of the tutor to the children of the\r\nComte d'Artois, the ward-robe of the crown, the building for the\r\ndressing-rooms and green-rooms of the actors who perform at the palace,\r\nwith the stables belonging to Monsieur.--In the Rue des Bon-Enfants\r\nare the hotel of the keeper of the wardrobe, the lodgings for the\r\nfountain-men, the hotel of the officers of the Comtesse de Provence.\r\nIn the Rue de la Pompe, the hotel of the grand-provost, the Duke of\r\nOrleans's stables, the hotel of the Comte d'Artois's guardsmen, the\r\nqueen's stables, the pavilion des Sources.--In the Rue Satory the\r\nComtesse d'Artois's stables, Monsieur's English garden, the king's\r\nice-houses, the riding-hall of the king's light-horse-guards, the garden\r\nbelonging to the hotel of the treasurers of the buildings.--Judge of\r\nother streets by these four. One cannot take a hundred steps without\r\nencountering some accessory of the palace: the hotel of the staff of the\r\nbody-guard, the hotel of the staff of light-horse-guards, the immense\r\nhotel of the body-guard itself, the hotel of the gendarmes of the guard,\r\nthe hotel of the grand wolf-huntsman, of the grand falconer, of the\r\ngrand huntsman, of the grand-master, of the commandant of the canal, of\r\nthe comptroller-general, of the superintendent of the buildings, and of\r\nthe chancellor; buildings devoted to falconry, and the vol de cabinet,\r\nto boar-hunting, to the grand kennel, to the dauphin kennel, to\r\nthe kennel for untrained dogs, to the court carriages, to shops and\r\nstorehouses connected with amusements, to the great stable and the\r\nlittle stables, to other stables in the Rue de Limoges, in the Rue\r\nRoyale, and in the Avenue Saint-Cloud; to the king's vegetable garden,\r\ncomprising twenty-nine gardens and four terraces; to the great dwelling\r\noccupied by 2,000 persons, with other tenements called \"Louises\" in\r\nwhich the king assigned temporary or permanent lodgings,--words on paper\r\nrender no physical impression of the physical enormity.--At the present\r\nday nothing remains of this old Versailles, mutilated and appropriated\r\nto other uses, but fragments, which, nevertheless, one should go and\r\nsee. Observe those three avenues meeting in the great square. Two\r\nhundred and forty feet broad and twenty-four hundred long, and not too\r\nlarge for the gathering crowds, the display, the blinding velocity\r\nof the escorts in full speed and of the carriages running \"at death's\r\ndoor.\"[2105] Observe the two stables facing the chateau with their\r\nrailings one hundred and ninety-two feet long. In 1682 they cost three\r\nmillions, that is to say, fifteen millions to day. They are so ample and\r\nbeautiful that, even under Louis XIV himself, they sometimes served as a\r\ncavalcade circus for the princes, sometimes as a theater, and sometimes\r\nas a ball-room. Then let the eye follow the development of the gigantic\r\nsemi-circular square which, from railing to railing and from court to\r\ncourt, ascends and slowly decreases, at first between the hotels of the\r\nministers and then between the two colossal wings, terminating in\r\nthe ostentatious frame of the marble court where pilasters, statues,\r\npediments, and multiplied and accumulated ornaments, story above story,\r\ncarry the majestic regularity of their lines and the overcharged mass of\r\ntheir decoration up to the sky. According to a bound manuscript bearing\r\nthe arms of Mansart, the palace cost 153 million, that is to say, about\r\n750 million francs of to day;[2106] when a king aims at imposing display\r\nthis is the cost of his lodging. Now turn the eye to the other side,\r\ntowards the gardens, and this self-display becomes the more impressive.\r\nThe parterres and the park are, again, a drawing room in the open\r\nair. There is nothing natural of nature here; she is put in order and\r\nrectified wholly with a view to society; this is no place to be alone\r\nand to relax oneself, but a place for promenades and the exchange of\r\npolite salutations. Those formal groves are walls and hangings; those\r\nshaven yews are vases and lyres. The parterres are flowering carpets. In\r\nthose straight, rectilinear avenues the king, with his cane in his hand,\r\ngroups around him his entire retinue. Sixty ladies in brocade dresses,\r\nexpanding into skirts measuring twenty-four feet in circumference,\r\neasily find room on the steps of the staircases.[2107] Those verdant\r\ncabinets afford shade for a princely collation. Under that circular\r\nportico, all the seigniors enjoying the privilege of entering it witness\r\ntogether the play of a new jet d'eau. Their counterparts greet them even\r\nin the marble and bronze figures which people the paths and basins, in\r\nthe dignified face of an Apollo, in the theatrical air of a Jupiter, in\r\nthe worldly ease or studied nonchalance of a Diana or a Venus. The\r\nstamp of the court, deepened through the joint efforts of society for a\r\ncentury, is so strong that it is graven on each detail as on the whole,\r\nand on material objects as on matters of the intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The King's Household.\r\n\r\n     Its officials and expenses.--His military family, his\r\n     stable, kennel, chapel, attendants, table, chamber,\r\n     wardrobe, outhouses, furniture, journeys.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is but the framework; before 1789 it was completely filled\r\nup. \"You have seen nothing,\" says Châteaubriand, \"if you have not\r\nseen the pomp of Versailles, even after the disbanding of the king's\r\nhousehold; Louis XIV was always there.\"[2108] It is a swarm of liveries,\r\nuniforms, costumes and equipages as brilliant and as varied as in a\r\npicture. I should be glad to have lived eight days in this society.\r\nIt was made expressly to be painted, being specially designed for the\r\npleasure of the eye, like an operatic scene. But how can we of to day\r\nimagine people for whom life was wholly operatic? At that time a grandee\r\nwas obliged to live in great state; his retinue and his trappings formed\r\na part of his personality; he fails in doing himself justice if these\r\nare not as ample and as splendid as he can make them; he would be as\r\nmuch mortified at any blank in his household as we with a hole in our\r\ncoats. Should he make any curtailment he would decline in reputation;\r\non Louis XVI undertaking reforms the court says that he acts like a\r\nbourgeois. When a prince or princess becomes of age a household is\r\nformed for them; when a prince marries, a household is formed for his\r\nwife; and by a household it must be understood that it is a\r\npompous display of fifteen or twenty distinct services: stables, a\r\nhunting-train, a chapel, a surgery, the bedchamber and the wardrobe,\r\na chamber for accounts, a table, pantry, kitchen, and wine-cellars, a\r\nfruitery, a fourrière, a common kitchen, a cabinet, a council;[2109] she\r\nwould feel that she was not a princess without all this. There are\r\n274 appointments in the household of the Duc d'Orléans, 210 in that of\r\nMesdames, 68 in that of Madame Elisabeth, 239 in that of the Comtesse\r\nd'Artois, 256 in that of the Comtesse de Provence, and 496 in that of\r\nthe Queen. When the formation of a household for Madame Royale, one\r\nmonth old, is necessary, \"the queen,\" writes the Austrian ambassador,\r\n\"desires to suppress a baneful indolence, a useless affluence of\r\nattendants, and every practice tending to give birth to sentiments of\r\npride. In spite of the said retrenchment the household of the young\r\nprincess is to consist of nearly eighty persons destined to the sole\r\nservice of her Royal Highness.\"[2110] The civil household of Monsieur\r\ncomprises 420 appointments, his military household, 179; that of the\r\nComte d'Artois 237 and his civil household 456.--Three-fourths of them\r\nare for display; with their embroideries and laces, their unembarrassed\r\nand polite expression, their attentive and discreet air, their easy way\r\nof saluting, walking and smiling, they appear well in an antechamber,\r\nplaced in lines, or scattered in groups in a gallery; I should have\r\nliked to contemplate even the stable and kitchen array, the figures\r\nfilling up the background of the picture. By these stars of inferior\r\nmagnitude we may judge of the splendor of the royal sun.\r\n\r\nThe king must have guards, infantry, cavalry, body-guards, French\r\nguardsmen, Swiss guardsmen, Cent Suisses, light-horse guards, gendarmes\r\nof the guard, gate-guardsmen, in all, 9,050 men,[2111] costing annually\r\n7,681,000 livres. Four companies of the French guard, and two of the\r\nSwiss guard, parade every day in the court of the ministers between the\r\ntwo railings, and when the king issues in his carriage to go to Paris or\r\nFontainebleau the spectacle is magnificent. Four trumpeters in front and\r\nfour behind, the Swiss guards on one side and the French guards on the\r\nother, form a line as far as it can reach.[2112] The Cent Suisses march\r\nahead of the horsemen in the costume of the sixteenth century, wearing\r\nthe halberd, ruff, plumed hat, and the ample parti-colored striped\r\ndoublet; alongside of these are the provost-guard with scarlet facings\r\nand gold frogs, and companies of yeomanry bristling with gold and\r\nsilver. The officers of the various corps, the trumpeters and the\r\nmusicians, covered with gold and silver lace, are dazzling to look at;\r\nthe kettledrum suspended at the saddle-bow, overcharged with painted\r\nand gilded ornaments, is a curiosity for a glass case; the Negro\r\ncymbal-player of the French guards resembles the sultan of a fairy-tale.\r\nBehind the carriage and alongside of it trot the body-guards, with sword\r\nand carbine, wearing red breeches, high black boots, and a blue coat\r\nsewn with white embroidery, all of them unquestionable gentlemen; there\r\nwere twelve hundred of these selected among the nobles and according to\r\nsize; among them are the guards de la manche, still more intimate, who\r\nat church and on ceremonial occasions, in white doublets starred with\r\nsilver and gold spangles, holding their damascene partisans in their\r\nhands, always remain standing and turned towards the king \"so as to\r\nsee his person from all sides.\" Thus is his protection ensured. Being\r\na gentleman the king is a cavalier, and he must have a suitable\r\nstable,[2113] 1,857 horses, 217 vehicles, 1,458 men whom he clothes,\r\nthe liveries costing 540,000 francs a year; besides these there were\r\n20 tutors and sub-tutors, almoners, professors, cooks, and valets to\r\ngovern, educate and serve the pages; and again about thirty physicians,\r\napothecaries, nurses for the sick, intendants, treasurers, workmen, and\r\nlicensed and paid merchants for the accessories of the service; in\r\nall more than 1,500 men. Horses to the amount of 250,000 francs are\r\npurchased yearly, and there are stock-stables in Limousin and in\r\nNormandy to draw on for supplies. 287 horses are exercised daily in the\r\ntwo riding-halls; there are 443 saddle-horses in the small stable, 437\r\nin the large one, and these are not sufficient for the \"vivacity of the\r\nservice.\" The whole cost 4,600,000 livres in 1775, which sum reaches\r\n6,200,000 livres in 1787.[2114] Still another spectacle should be seen\r\nwith one's own eyes,--the pages,[2115] the grooms, the laced pupils,\r\nthe silver-button pupils, the boys of the little livery in silk, the\r\ninstrumentalists and the mounted messengers of the stable. The use\r\nof the horse is a feudal art; no luxury is more natural to a man of\r\nquality. Think of the stables at Chantilly, which are palaces. To\r\nconvey an idea of a well-educated and genteel man he was then called an\r\naccomplished cavalier;\" in fact his importance was fully manifest only\r\nwhen he was in the saddle, on a blood-horse like himself.--Another\r\ngenteel taste, an effect of the preceding, is the chase. It costs the\r\nking from 1,100,000 to 1,200,000 livres a year, and requires 280\r\nhorses besides those of the two stables. A more varied or more complete\r\nequipment could not be imagined: a pack of hounds for the boar, another\r\nfor the wolf another for the roe-buck, a cast (of hawks) for the crow,\r\na cast for the magpie, a cast for merlins, a cast for hares, a cast for\r\nthe fields. In 1783, 179,194 livres are expended for feeding horses, and\r\n53,412 livres for feeding dogs.[2116] The entire territory, ten leagues\r\naround Paris, is a game-preserve; \"not a gun could be fired there;[2117]\r\naccordingly the plains are seen covered with partridges accustomed to\r\nman, quietly picking up the grain and never stirring as he passes.\" Add\r\nto this the princes' captaincies, extending as far as Villers-Cotterets\r\nand Orleans; these form an almost continuous circle around Paris,\r\nthirty leagues in circumference, where game, protected, replaced and\r\nmultiplied, swarms for the pleasure of the king. The park of Versailles\r\nalone forms an enclosure of more than ten leagues. The forest\r\nof Rambouillet embraces 25,000 arpents (30,000 acres). Herds of\r\nseventy-five and eighty stags are encountered around Fontainebleau. No\r\ntrue hunter could read the minute-book of the chase without feeling an\r\nimpulse of envy. The wolf-hounds run twice a week, and they take forty\r\nwolves a year. Between 1743 and 1744 Louis XV runs down 6,400 stags.\r\nLouis XVI writes, August 30th, 1781: \"Killed 460 head to day.\" In 1780\r\nhe brings down 20,534 head; in 1781, 20,291; in fourteen years, 189,251\r\nhead, besides 1,254 stags, while boars and bucks are proportionate; and\r\nit must be noted that this is all done by his own hand, since his\r\nparks approach his houses.--Such, in fine, is the character of\r\na \"well-appointed household,\" that is to say, provided with its\r\ndependencies and services. Everything is within reach; it is a complete\r\nworld in itself and self-sufficient. One exalted being attaches to and\r\ngathers around it, with universal foresight and minuteness of detail,\r\nevery appurtenance it employs or can possibly employ.--Thus, each\r\nprince, each princess has a professional surgery and a chapel;[2118] it\r\nwould not answer for the almoner who says mass or the doctor who looks\r\nafter their health to be obtained outside. So much stronger is the\r\nreason that the king should have ministrants of this stamp; his chapel\r\nembraces seventy-five almoners, chaplains, confessors, masters of the\r\noratory, clerks, announcers, carpet-bearers, choristers, copyists,\r\nand composers of sacred music; his faculty is composed of forty-eight\r\nphysicians, surgeons, apothecaries, oculists, operators, bone-setters,\r\ndistillers, chiropodists and spagyrists (a species of alchemists).\r\nWe must still note his department of profane music, consisting of one\r\nhundred and twenty-eight vocalists, dancers, instrumentalists, directors\r\nand superintendents; his library corps of forty-three keepers, readers,\r\ninterpreters, engravers, medallists, geographers, binders and printers;\r\nthe staff of ceremonial display, sixty-two heralds, sword-bearers,\r\nushers and musicians; the staff of housekeepers, consisting of\r\nsixty-eight marshals, guides and commissaries. I omit other services in\r\nhaste to reach the most important,--that of the table; a fine house and\r\ngood housekeeping being known by the table.\r\n\r\nThere are three sections of the table service;[2119] the first for the\r\nking and his younger children; the second, called the little ordinary,\r\nfor the table of the grand-master, the grand-chamberlain and the\r\nprinces and princesses living with the king; the third, called the great\r\nordinary, for the grand-master's second table, that of the butlers of\r\nthe king's household, the almoners, the gentlemen in waiting, and that\r\nof the valets-de-chambre, in all three hundred and eighty-three officers\r\nof the table and one hundred and three waiters, at an expense of\r\n2,177,771 livres; besides this there are 389,173 livres appropriated\r\nto the table of Madame Elisabeth, and 1,093,547 livres for that\r\nof Mesdames, the total being 3,660,491 livres for the table. The\r\nwine-merchant furnished wine to the amount of 300,000 francs per annum,\r\nand the purveyor game, meat and fish at a cost of 1,000,000 livres. Only\r\nto fetch water from Ville-d'Avray, and to convey servants, waiters and\r\nprovisions, required fifty horses hired at the rate of 70,591 francs per\r\nannum. The privilege of the royal princes and princesses \"to send to the\r\nbureau for fish on fast days when not residing regularly at the court,\"\r\namounts in 1778 to 175,116 livres. On reading in the Almanach the titles\r\nof these officials we see a Gargantua's feast spread out before us.\r\nThe formal hierarchy of the kitchens, so many grand officials of the\r\ntable,--the butlers, comptrollers and comptroller-pupils, the clerks and\r\ngentlemen of the pantry, the cup-bearers and carvers, the officers and\r\nequerries of the kitchen, the chiefs, assistants and head-cooks, the\r\nordinary scullions, turnspits and cellarers, the common gardeners\r\nand salad gardeners, laundry servants, pastry-cooks, plate-changers,\r\ntable-setters, crockery-keepers, and broach-bearers, the butler of the\r\ntable of the head-butler,--an entire procession of broad-braided backs\r\nand imposing round bellies, with grave countenances, which, with order\r\nand conviction, exercise their functions before the saucepans and around\r\nthe buffets.\r\n\r\nOne step more and we enter the sanctuary, the king's apartment. Two\r\nprincipal dignitaries preside over this, and each has under him about\r\na hundred subordinates. On one side is the grand chamberlain with his\r\nfirst gentlemen of the bedchamber, the pages of the bedchamber, their\r\ngovernors and instructors, the ushers of the antechamber, with the four\r\nfirst valets-de-chambre in ordinary, sixteen special valets serving in\r\nturn, his regular and special cloak-bearers, his barbers, upholsterers,\r\nwatch-menders, waiters and porters; on the other hand is the\r\ngrand-master of the wardrobe, with the masters of the wardrobe and the\r\nvalets of the wardrobe regular and special, the ordinary trunk-carriers,\r\nmail-bearers, tailors, laundry servants, starchers, and common waiters,\r\nwith the gentlemen, officers and secretaries in ordinary of the cabinet,\r\nin all 198 persons for domestic service, like 50 many domestic utensils\r\nfor every personal want, or as sumptuous pieces of furniture for the\r\ndecoration of the apartment. Some of them fetch the mall and the balls,\r\nothers hold the mantle and cane, others comb the king's hair and dry him\r\noff after a bath, others drive the mules which transport his bed, others\r\nwatch his pet greyhounds in his room, others fold, put on and tie his\r\ncravat, and others fetch and carry off his easy chair.[2120] Some there\r\nare whose sole business it is to fill a corner which must not be left\r\nempty. Certainly, with respect to ease of deportment and appearance\r\nthese are the most conspicuous of all; being so close to the master they\r\nare under obligation to appear well; in such proximity their bearing\r\nmust not create a discord.--Such is the king's household, and I have\r\nonly described one of his residences; he has a dozen of them besides\r\nVersailles, great and small, Marly, the two Trianons, la Muette,\r\nMeudon, Choisy, Saint-Hubert, Saint-Germain, Fontainebleau, Compiègne,\r\nSaint-Cloud, Rambouillet,[2121] without counting the Louvre, the\r\nTuileries and Chambord, with their parks and hunting-grounds, their\r\ngovernors, inspectors, comptrollers, concierges, fountain tenders,\r\ngardeners, sweepers, scrubbers, mole-catchers, wood-rangers, mounted\r\nand foot-guards, in all more than a thousand persons. Naturally he\r\nentertains, plans and builds, and, in this way expends 3 or 4 millions\r\nper annum.[2122] Naturally, also, he repairs and renews his furniture;\r\nin 1778, which is an average year, this costs him 1,936,853 livres.\r\nNaturally, also, he takes his guests along with him and defrays their\r\nexpenses, they and their attendants; at Choisy, in 1780, there are\r\nsixteen tables with 345 seats besides the distributions; at Saint-Cloud,\r\nin 1785, there are twenty-six tables; \"an excursion to Marly of\r\ntwenty-one days is a matter of 120,000 livres extra expense;\" the\r\nexcursion to Fontainebleau has cost as much as 400,000 and 500,000\r\nlivres. His removals, on the average, cost half a million and more per\r\nannum.[2123]--To complete our idea of this immense paraphernalia it\r\nmust be borne in mind that the artisans and merchants belonging to these\r\nvarious official bodies are obliged; through the privileges they enjoy,\r\nto follow the court \"on its journeys that it may be provided on the spot\r\nwith apothecaries, armorers, gunsmiths, sellers of silken and\r\nwoollen hosiery, butchers, bakers, embroiderers, publicans, cobblers,\r\nbelt-makers, candle-makers, hatters, pork-dealers, surgeons, shoemakers,\r\ncurriers, cooks, pinkers, gilders and engravers, spur-makers,\r\nsweetmeat-dealers, furbishers, old-clothes brokers, glove-perfumers,\r\nwatchmakers, booksellers, linen-drapers, wholesale and retail\r\nwine-dealers, carpenters, coarse-jewelry haberdashers, jewellers,\r\nparchment-makers, dealers in trimmings, chicken-roasters, fish-dealers,\r\npurveyors of hay, straw and oats, hardware-sellers, saddlers, tailors,\r\ngingerbread and starch-dealers, fruiterers, dealers in glass and in\r\nviolins.\"[2124] One might call it an oriental court which, to be set\r\nin motion, moves an entire world: \"when it is to move one must, if one\r\nwants to travel anywhere, take the post in well in advance.\" The total\r\nis near 4,000 persons for the king's civil household, 9,000 to 10,000\r\nfor his military household, at least 2,000 for those of his relatives,\r\nin all 15,000 individuals, at a cost of between forty and fifty million\r\nlivres, which would be equal to double the amount to day, and which, at\r\nthat time, constituted one-tenth of the public revenue.[2125] We have\r\nhere the central figure of the monarchical show. However grand and\r\ncostly it may be, it is only proportionate to its purpose, since the\r\ncourt is a public institution, and the aristocracy, with nothing to do,\r\ndevotes itself to filling up the king's drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The King's Associates.\r\n\r\n     The society of the king.--Officers of the household.\r\n     --Invited guests.\r\n\r\nTwo causes maintain this affluence, one the feudal form still preserved,\r\nand the other the new centralization just introduced; one placing the\r\nroyal service in the hands of the nobles, and the other converting the\r\nnobles into place-hunters.--Through the duties of the palace the highest\r\nnobility live with the king, residing under his roof; the grand-almoner\r\nis M. de Montmorency-Laval, bishop of Metz; the first almoner is M. de\r\nBussuéjouls, bishop of Senlis; the grand-master of France is the Prince\r\nde Condé; the first royal butier is the Comte d'Escars; the second\r\nis the Marquis de Montdragon; the master of the pantry is the Duke\r\nde Brissac; the chief cup-bearer is the Marquis de Vemeuil; the chief\r\ncarver is the Marquis de la Chesnaye; the first gentlemen of the\r\nbedchamber are the Ducs de Richelieu, de Durfort, de Villequier, and\r\nde Fleury; the grand-master of the wardrobe is the Duc de la\r\nRochefoucauld-Liancourt; the masters of the wardrobe are the Comte de\r\nBoisgelin and the Marquis de Chauvelin. The captain of the falconry is\r\nthe Chevalier du Forget; the captain of the boar-hunt is the Marquis\r\nd'Ecquevilly; the superintendent of edifices is the Comte d'Angevillier;\r\nthe grand-equerry is the Prince de Lambesc; the master of the hounds is\r\nthe Duc de Penthièvre; the grand-master of ceremonies is the Marquis de\r\nBrèze; the grand-master of the household is the Marquis de la Suze;\r\nthe captains of the guards are the Ducs d'Agen, de Villery, de Brissac,\r\nd'Aguillon, and de Biron, the Princes de Poix, de Luxembourg and\r\nde Soubise. The provost of the hotel is the Marquis de Tourzel; the\r\ngovernors of the residences and captains of the chase are the Duc de\r\nNoailles, Marquis de Champcenetz, Baron de Champlost, Duc de Coigny,\r\nComte de Modena, Comte de Montmorin, Duc de Laval, Comte de Brienne,\r\nDuc d'Orléans, and the Duc de Gèsvres.[2126] All these seigniors are\r\nthe king's necessary intimates, his permanent and generally hereditary\r\nguests, dwelling under his roof; in close and daily intercourse with\r\nhim, for they are \"his folks\" (gens)[2127] and perform domestic service\r\nabout his person. Add to these their equals, as noble and nearly as\r\nnumerous, dwelling with the queen, with Mesdames, with Mme. Elisabeth,\r\nwith the Comte and Comtesse de Provence and the Comte and Comtesse\r\nd'Artois.--And these are only the heads of the service; if; below them\r\nin rank and office, I count the titular nobles, I find, among others,\r\n68 almoners or chaplains, 170 gentlemen of the bedchamber or in waiting,\r\n117 gentlemen of the stable or of the hunting-train, 148 pages, 114\r\ntitled ladies in waiting, besides all the officers, even to the lowest\r\nof the military household, without counting 1,400 ordinary guards who,\r\nverified by the genealogist, are admitted by virtue of their title to\r\npay their court.[2128] Such is the fixed body of recruits for the royal\r\nreceptions; the distinctive trait of this régime is the conversion\r\nof its servants into guests, the drawing room being filled from the\r\nanteroom.\r\n\r\nNot that the drawing room needs all that to be filled. Being the source\r\nof all preferment and of every favor, it is natural that it should\r\noverflow[2129]. It is the same in our leveling society (in 1875), where\r\nthe drawing room of an insignificant deputy, a mediocre journalist, or\r\na fashionable woman, is full of courtiers under the name of friends and\r\nvisitors. Moreover, here, to be present is an obligation; it might be\r\ncalled a continuation of ancient feudal homage; the staff of nobles is\r\nmaintained as the retinue of its born general. In the language of the\r\nday, it is called \"paying one's duty to the king.\" Absence, in the\r\nsovereign's eyes, would be a sign of independence as well as of\r\nindifference, while submission as well as regular attention is his due.\r\nIn this respect we must study the institution from the beginning.\r\nThe eyes of Louis XIV go their rounds at every moment, \"on arising or\r\nretiring, on passing into his apartments, in his gardens,. . . nobody\r\nescapes, even those who hoped they were not seen; it was a demerit with\r\nsome, and the most distinguished, not to make the court their ordinary\r\nsojourn, to others to come to it but seldom, and certain disgrace to\r\nthose who never, or nearly never, came.\"[2130] Henceforth, the\r\nmain thing, for the first personages in the kingdom, men and women,\r\necclesiastics and laymen, the grand affair, the first duty in life,\r\nthe true occupation, is to be at all hours and in every place under the\r\nking's eye, within reach of his voice and of his glance. \"Whoever,\" says\r\nLa Bruyère, \"considers that the king's countenance is the courtier's\r\nsupreme felicity, that he passes his life looking on it and within sight\r\nof it, will comprehend to some extent how to see God constitutes the\r\nglory and happiness of the saints.\" There were at this time prodigies of\r\nvoluntary assiduity and subjection. The Duc de Fronsac, every morning\r\nat seven o'clock, in winter and in summer, stationed himself, at his\r\nfather's command, at the foot of the small stairway leading to the\r\nchapel, solely to shake hands with Mme. de Maintenon on her leaving for\r\nSt. Cyr.[2131] \"Pardon me, Madame,\" writes the Duc de Richelieu to her,\r\n\"the great liberty I take in presuming to send you the letter which\r\nI have written to the king, begging him on my knees that he will\r\noccasionally allow me to pay my court to him at Ruel, for I would rather\r\ndie than pass two months without seeing him.\" The true courtier follows\r\nthe prince as a shadow follows its body; such, under Louis XIV, was the\r\nDuc de la Rochefoucauld, the master of the hounds. \"He never missed the\r\nking's rising or retiring, both changes of dress every day, the hunts\r\nand the promenades, likewise every day, for ten years in succession,\r\nnever sleeping away from the place where the king rested, and yet on a\r\nfooting to demand leave, but not to stay away all night, for he had not\r\nslept out of Paris once in forty years, but to go and dine away from the\r\ncourt, and not be present on the promenade.\"--If; later, and under less\r\nexacting masters, and in the general laxity of the eighteenth century,\r\nthis discipline is relaxed, the institution nevertheless subsists;[2132]\r\nin default of obedience, tradition, interest and amour-propre suffice\r\nfor the people of the court. To approach the king, to be a domestic in\r\nhis household, an usher, a cloak-bearer, a valet, is a privilege that\r\nis purchased, even in 1789, for thirty, forty, and a hundred thousand\r\nlivres; so much greater the reason why it is a privilege to form a\r\npart of his society, the most honorable, the most useful, and the most\r\ncoveted of all.--In the first place, it is a proof of noble birth. A\r\nman, to follow the king in the chase, and a woman, to be presented to\r\nthe queen, must previously satisfy the genealogist, and by authentic\r\ndocuments, that his or her nobility goes back to the year 1400.--In the\r\nnext place, it ensures good fortune. This drawing room is the only\r\nplace within reach of royal favors; accordingly, up to 1789, the great\r\nfamilies never stir away from Versailles, and day and night they lie in\r\nambush. The valet of the Marshal de Noaillles says to him one night on\r\nclosing his curtains,\r\n\r\n\"At what hour will Monseigneur be awakened?\" \"At ten o'clock, if no one\r\ndies during the night.\"[2133]\r\n\r\nOld courtiers are still found who, \"at the age of eighty, have passed\r\nforty-five on their feet in the antechambers of the king, of the\r\nprinces, and of the ministers. . .\r\n\r\n\"You have only three things to do,\" says one of them to a debutant,\r\n\"speak well of everybody, ask for every vacancy, and sit down when you\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\nHence, the king always has a crowd around him. The Comtesse du Barry\r\nsays, on presenting her niece at court, the first of August, 1773, \"the\r\ncrowd is so great at a presentation, one can scarcely get through the\r\nantechambers.\"[2134] In December, 1774, at Fontainebleau, when the queen\r\nplays at her own table every evening, \"the apartment, though vast, is\r\nnever empty. . . . The crowd is so great that one can talk only to the\r\ntwo or three persons with whom one is playing.\" The fourteen apartments,\r\nat the receptions of ambassadors are full to overflowing with seigniors\r\nand richly dressed women. On the first of January, 1775, the queen\r\n\"counted over two hundred ladies presented to her to pay their court.\"\r\nIn 1780, at Choisy, a table for thirty persons is spread every day for\r\nthe king, another with thirty places for the seigniors, another with\r\nforty places for the officers of the guard and the equerries, and one\r\nwith fifty for the officers of the bedchamber. According to my estimate,\r\nthe king, on getting up and on retiring, on his walks, on his hunts,\r\nat play, has always around him at least forty or fifty seigniors and\r\ngenerally a hundred, with as many ladies, besides his attendants on\r\nduty. At Fontainebleau, in 1756, although \"there were neither fêtes nor\r\nballets this year, one hundred and six ladies were counted.\" When the\r\nking holds a \"grand apartement,\" when play or dancing takes place in the\r\ngallery of mirrors, four or five hundred guests, the elect of the nobles\r\nand of the fashion, range themselves on the benches or gather around the\r\ncard and cavanole tables.[2135] This is a spectacle to be seen, not by\r\nthe imagination, or through imperfect records, but with our own eyes\r\nand on the spot, to comprehend the spirit, the effect and the triumph of\r\nmonarchical culture. In an elegantly furnished house, the drawing\r\nroom is the principal room; and never was one more dazzling than this.\r\nSuspended from the sculptured ceiling peopled with sporting cupids,\r\ndescend, by garlands of flowers and foliage, blazing chandeliers, whose\r\nsplendor is enhanced by the tail mirrors; the light streams down in\r\nfloods on gilding, diamonds, and beaming, arch physiognomies, on fine\r\nbusts, and on the capacious, sparkling and garlanded dresses. The skirts\r\nof the ladies ranged in a circle, or in tiers on the benches, \"form\r\na rich espalier covered with pearls, gold, silver, jewels, spangles,\r\nflowers and fruits, with their artificial blossoms, gooseberries,\r\ncherries, and strawberries,\" a gigantic animated bouquet of which the\r\neye can scarcely support the brilliancy. There are no black coats, as\r\nnowadays, to disturb the harmony. With the hair powdered and dressed,\r\nwith buckles and knots, with cravats and ruffles of lace, in silk coats\r\nand vests of the hues of fallen leaves, or of a delicate rose tint, or\r\nof celestial blue, embellished with gold braid and embroidery, the men\r\nare as elegant as the women. Men and women, each is a selection; they\r\nall are of the accomplished class, gifted with every grace which good\r\nblood, education, fortune, leisure and custom can bestow; they are\r\nperfect of their kind. There is no toilet, no carriage of the head, no\r\ntone of the voice, no expression in language which is not a masterpiece\r\nof worldly culture, the distilled quintessence of all that is\r\nexquisitely elaborated by social art. Polished as the high society of\r\nParis may be, it does not approach this;[2136] compared with the court,\r\nit seems provincial. It is said that a hundred thousand roses are\r\nrequired to make an ounce of the unique perfume used by Persian kings;\r\nsuch is this drawing-room, the frail vial of crystal and gold containing\r\nthe substance of a human vegetation. To fill it, a great aristocracy\r\nhad to be transplanted to a hot-house and become sterile in fruit and\r\nflowers, and then, in the royal alembic, its pure sap is concentrated\r\ninto a few drops of aroma. The price is excessive, but only at this\r\nprice can the most delicate perfumes be manufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Everyday Life In Court.\r\n\r\n     The king's occupations.--Rising in the morning, mass,\r\n     dinner, walks, hunting, supper, play, evening receptions.\r\n     --He is always on parade and in company.\r\n\r\nAn operation of this kind absorbs him who undertakes it as well as those\r\nwho undergo it. A nobility for useful purposes is not transformed with\r\nimpunity into a nobility for ornament;[2137] one falls himself into the\r\nostentation which is substituted for action. The king has a court which\r\nhe is compelled to maintain. So much the worse if it absorbs all his\r\ntime, his intellect, his soul, the most valuable portion of his active\r\nforces and the forces of the State. To be the master of a house is\r\nnot an easy task, especially when five hundred persons are to be\r\nentertained; one must necessarily pass one's life in public and all the\r\ntime being on exhibition. Strictly speaking it is the life of an actor\r\nwho is on the stage the entire day. To support this load, and work\r\nbesides, required the temperament of Louis XIV, the vigor of his body,\r\nthe extraordinary firmness of his nerves, the strength of his digestion,\r\nand the regularity of his habits; his successors who come after him grow\r\nweary or stagger under the same load. But they cannot throw it off; an\r\nincessant, daily performance is inseparable from their position and it\r\nis imposed on them like a heavy, gilded, ceremonial coat. The king is\r\nexpected to keep the entire aristocracy busy, consequently to make a\r\ndisplay of himself, to pay back with his own person, at all hours, even\r\nthe most private, even on getting out of bed, and even in his bed. In\r\nthe morning, at the hour named by himself beforehand,[2138] the head\r\nvalet awakens him; five series of persons enter in turn to perform their\r\nduty, and, \"although very large, there are days when the waiting-rooms\r\ncan hardly contain the crowd of courtiers.\"--The first admittance is\r\n\"l'entrée familière,\" consisting of the children of France, the princes\r\nand princesses of the blood, and, besides these, the chief physician,\r\nthe chief surgeon and other serviceable persons.[2139] Next, comes the\r\n\"grande entrée;' which comprises the grand-chamberlain, the grand-master\r\nand master of the wardrobe, the first gentlemen of the bedchamber, the\r\nDucs d'Orleans and de Penthièvre, some other highly favored seigniors,\r\nthe ladies of honor and in waiting of the queen, Mesdames and other\r\nprincesses, without enumerating barbers tailors and various descriptions\r\nof valets. Meanwhile spirits of wine are poured on the king's hands from\r\na service of plate, and he is then handed the basin of holy water; he\r\ncrosses himself and repeats a prayer. Then he gets out of bed before\r\nall these people and puts on his slippers. The grand-chamberlain and the\r\nfirst gentleman hand him his dressing-gown; he puts this on and seats\r\nhimself in the chair in which he is to put on his clothes. At this\r\nmoment the door opens and a third group enters, which is the \"entrée\r\ndes brevets;\" the seigniors who compose this enjoy, in addition, the\r\nprecious privilege of assisting at the \"petite coucher,\" while, at the\r\nsame moment there enters a detachment of attendants, consisting of the\r\nphysicians and surgeons in ordinary, the intendants of the amusements,\r\nreaders and others, and among the latter those who preside over physical\r\nrequirements; the publicity of a royal life is so great that none of\r\nits functions can be exercised without witnesses. At the moment of\r\nthe approach of the officers of the wardrobe to dress him the first\r\ngentleman, notified by an usher, advances to read to the king the names\r\nof the grandees who are waiting at the door: this is the fourth entry\r\ncalled \"la chambre,\" and larger than those preceding it; for, not to\r\nmention the cloak-bearers, gun-bearers, rug-bearers and other valets\r\nit comprises most of the superior officials, the grand-almoner, the\r\nalmoners on duty, the chaplain, the master of the oratory, the captain\r\nand major of the body-guard, the colonel-general and major of the French\r\nguards, the colonel of the king's regiment, the captain of the Cent\r\nSuisses, the grand-huntsman, the grand wolf-huntsman, the grand-provost,\r\nthe grand-master and master of ceremonies, the first butler, the\r\ngrand-master of the pantry, the foreign ambassadors, the ministers and\r\nsecretaries of state, the marshals of France and most of the seigniors\r\nand prelates of distinction. Ushers place the ranks in order and, if\r\nnecessary, impose silence. Meanwhile the king washes his hands and\r\nbegins his toilet. Two pages remove his slippers; the grand-master of\r\nthe wardrobe draws off his night-shirt by the right arm, and the first\r\nvalet of the wardrobe by the left arm, and both of them hand it to an\r\nofficer of the wardrobe, whilst a valet of the wardrobe fetches the\r\nshirt wrapped up in white taffeta. Things have now reached the solemn\r\npoint, the culmination of the ceremony; the fifth entry has been\r\nintroduced, and, in a few moments, after the king has put his shirt on,\r\nall that is left of those who are known, with other house hold officers\r\nwaiting in the gallery, complete the influx. There is quite a formality\r\nin regard to this shirt. The honor of handing it is reserved to the sons\r\nand grandsons of France; in default of these to the princes of the blood\r\nor those legitimized; in their default to the grand-chamberlain or to\r\nthe first gentleman of the bedchamber;--the latter case, it must be\r\nobserved, being very rare, the princes being obliged to be present at\r\nthe king's lever, as were the princesses at that of the queen.[2140]\r\nAt last the shirt is presented and a valet carries off the old one;\r\nthe first valet of the wardrobe and the first valet-de-chambre hold the\r\nfresh one, each by a right and left arm respectively,[2141] while two\r\nother valets, during this operation, extend his dressing-gown in front\r\nof him to serve as a screen. The shirt is now on his back and the toilet\r\ncommences. A valet-de-chambre supports a mirror before the king while\r\ntwo others on the two sides light it up, if occasion requires, with\r\nflambeaux. Valets of the wardrobe fetch the rest of the attire; the\r\ngrand-master of the wardrobe puts the vest on and the doublet, attaches\r\nthe blue ribbon, and clasps his sword around him; then a valet assigned\r\nto the cravats brings several of these in a basket, while the master\r\nof the wardrobe arranges around the king's neck that which the king\r\nselects. After this a valet assigned to the handkerchiefs brings three\r\nof these on a silver salver, while the grand-master of the wardrobe\r\noffers the salver to the king, who chooses one. Finally the master of\r\nthe wardrobe hands to the king his hat, his gloves and his cane. The\r\nking then steps to the side of the bed, kneels on a cushion and says his\r\nprayers, whilst an almoner in a low voice recites the orison Quoesumus,\r\ndeus omnipotens. This done, the king announces the order of the day, and\r\npasses with the leading persons of his court into his cabinet, where he\r\nsometimes gives audience. Meanwhile the rest of the company await him in\r\nthe gallery in order to accompany him to mass when he comes out.\r\n\r\nSuch is the lever, a piece in five acts.--Nothing could be contrived\r\nbetter calculated to fill up the void of an aristocratic life; a hundred\r\nor thereabouts of notable seigniors dispose of a couple of hours in\r\ncoming, in waiting, in entering, in defiling, in taking positions, in\r\nstanding on their feet, in maintaining an air of respect and of ease\r\nsuitable to a superior class of walking gentlemen, while those\r\nbest qualified are about to do the same thing over in the queen's\r\napartment.[2142]--The king, however, as an indirect consequence, suffers\r\nthe same torture and the same inaction as he imposes. He also is\r\nplaying a part; all his steps and all his gestures have been determined\r\nbeforehand; he has been obliged to arrange his physiognomy and his\r\nvoice, never to depart from an affable and dignified air, to award\r\njudiciously his glances and his nods, to keep silent or to speak only of\r\nthe chase, and to suppress his own thoughts, if he has any. One cannot\r\nindulge in reverie, meditate or be absent-minded when one is before the\r\nfootlights; the part must have due attention. Besides, in a drawing\r\nroom there is only drawing room conversation, and the master's thoughts,\r\ninstead of being directed in a profitable channel, must be scattered\r\nabout like the holy water of the court. All hours of his day are passed\r\nin a similar manner, except three or four during the morning, during\r\nwhich he is at the council or in his private room; it must be\r\nnoted, too, that on the days after his hunts, on returning home from\r\nRambouillet at three o'clock in the morning, he must sleep the few hours\r\nhe has left to him. The ambassador Mercy,[2143] nevertheless, a man of\r\nclose application, seems to think it sufficient; he, at least, thinks\r\nthat \"Louis XVI is a man of order, losing no time in useless things;\"\r\nhis predecessor, indeed, worked much less, scarcely an hour a day.\r\nThree-quarters of his time is thus given up to show. The same retinue\r\nsurrounds him when he puts on his boots, when he takes them off; when\r\nhe changes his clothes to mount his horse, when he returns home to dress\r\nfor the evening, and when he goes to his room at night to retire. \"Every\r\nevening for six years, says a page,[2144] either myself or one of my\r\ncomrades has seen Louis XVI get into bed in public,\" with the ceremonial\r\njust described. \"It was not omitted ten times to my knowledge, and\r\nthen accidentally or through indisposition.\" The attendance is yet more\r\nnumerous when he dines and takes supper; for, besides men there are\r\nwomen present, duchesses seated on the folding-chairs, also others\r\nstanding around the table. It is needless to state that in the evening\r\nwhen he plays, or gives a ball, or a concert, the crowd rushes in and\r\noverflows. When he hunts, besides the ladies on horses and in\r\nvehicles, besides officers of the hunt, of the guards, the equerry, the\r\ncloak-bearer, gun-bearer, surgeon, bone-setter, lunch-bearer and I\r\nknow not how many others, all the gentlemen who accompany him are\r\nhis permanent guests. And do not imagine that this suite is a small\r\none;[2145] the day M. de Châteaubriand is presented there are four fresh\r\nadditions, and \"with the utmost punctuality\" all the young men of high\r\nrank join the king's retinue two or three times a week. Not only the\r\neight or ten scenes which compose each of these days, but again the\r\nshort intervals between the scenes are besieged and carried. People\r\nwatch for him, walk by his side and speak with him on his way from his\r\ncabinet to the chapel, between his apartment and his carriage, between\r\nhis carriage and his apartment, between his cabinet and his dining room.\r\nAnd still more, his life behind the scenes belongs to the public. If he\r\nis indisposed and broth is brought to him, if he is ill and medicine\r\nis handed to him, \"a servant immediately summons the 'grande entrée.'\"\r\nVerily, the king resembles an oak stifled by the innumerable creepers\r\nwhich, from top to bottom, cling to its trunk. Under a régime of this\r\nstamp there is a want of air; some opening has to be found; Louis XV\r\navailed himself of the chase and of suppers; Louis XVI of the chase\r\nand of lock-making. And I have not mentioned the infinite detail\r\nof etiquette, the extraordinary ceremonial of the state dinner, the\r\nfifteen, twenty and thirty beings busy around the king's plates and\r\nglasses, the sacramental utterances of the occasion, the procession of\r\nthe retinue, the arrival of \"la nef\" \"l'essai des plats,\" all as if in\r\na Byzantine or Chinese court.[2146] On Sundays the entire public, the\r\npublic in general, is admitted, and this is called the \"grand couvert,\"\r\nas complex and as solemn as a high mass. Accordingly to eat, to\r\ndrink, to get up, to go to bed, is to a descendant of Louis XIV,\r\nto officiate.[2147] Frederick II, on hearing an explanation of this\r\netiquette, declared that if he were king of France his first edict would\r\nbe to appoint another king to hold court in his place. In effect, if\r\nthere are idlers to salute there must be an idler to be saluted. Only\r\none way was possible by which the monarch could have been set free, and\r\nthat was to have recast and transformed the French nobles, according\r\nto the Prussian system, into a hard-working regiment of serviceable\r\nfunctionaries. But, so long as the court remains what it is, that is to\r\nsay, a pompous parade and a drawing room decoration, the king himself\r\nmust likewise remain a showy decoration, of little or no use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Royal Distractions.\r\n\r\n     Diversions of the royal family and of the court.--Louis XV.\r\n     --Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nIn short, what is the occupation of a well-qualified master of a\r\nhouse? He amuses himself and he amuses his guests; under his roof a\r\nnew pleasure-party comes off daily. Let us enumerate those of a week.\r\n\"Yesterday, Sunday,\" says the Duc de Luynes, \"I met the king going to\r\nhunt on the plain of St. Denis, having slept at la Muette, where he\r\nintends to remain shooting to day and to-morrow, and to return here\r\non Tuesday or Wednesday morning, to run down a stag the same day,\r\nWednesday.\"[2148] Two months after this, \"the king,\" again says M. de\r\nLuynes, \"has been hunting every day of the past and of the present\r\nweek, except to day and on Sundays, killing, since the beginning, 3,500\r\npartridges.\" He is always on the road, or hunting, or passing from one\r\nresidence to another, from Versailles to Fontainebleau, to Choisy,\r\nto Marly, to la Muette, to Compiègne, to Trianon, to Saint-Hubert, to\r\nBellevue, to Rambouillet, and, generally, with his entire court.[2149]\r\nAt Choisy, especially, and at Fontainebleau this company all lead\r\na merry life. At Fontainebleau \"Sunday and Friday, play; Monday and\r\nWednesday, a concert in the queen's apartments; Tuesday and Thursday,\r\nthe French comedians; and Saturday it is the Italians;\" there\r\nis something for every day in the week. At Choisy, writes the\r\nDauphine,[2150] \"from one o'clock (in the afternoon) when we dine, to\r\none o'clock at night we remain out. . . After dining we play until six\r\no'clock, after which we go to the theater, which lasts until half-past\r\nnine o'clock, and next, to supper; after this, play again, until one,\r\nand sometimes half-past one, o'clock.\" At Versailles things are more\r\nmoderate; there are but two theatrical entertainments and one ball a\r\nweek; but every evening there is play and a reception in the\r\nking's apartment, in his daughters', in his mistress's, in his\r\ndaughter-in-law's, besides hunts and three petty excursions a week.\r\nRecords show that, in a certain year, Louis XV slept only fifty-two\r\nnights at Versailles, while the Austrian Ambassador well says that\r\n\"his mode of living leaves him not an hour in the day for attention to\r\nimportant matters.\"--As to Louis XVI, we have seen that he reserves a\r\nfew hours of the morning; but the machine is wound up, and go it must.\r\nHow can he withdraw himself from his guests and not do the honors of his\r\nhouse? Here propriety and custom are tyrants and a third despotism must\r\nbe added, still more absolute: the imperious vivacity of a lively\r\nyoung queen who cannot endure an hour's reading.--At Versailles, three\r\ntheatrical entertainments and two balls a week, two grand suppers\r\nTuesday and Thursday, and from time to time, the opera in Paris.[2151]\r\nAt Fontainebleau, the theater three times a week, and on other days,\r\nplay and suppers. During the following winter the queen gives a\r\nmasked ball each week, in which \"the contrivance of the costumes, the\r\nquadrilles arranged in ballets, and the daily rehearsals, take so much\r\ntime as to consume the entire week.\" During the carnival of 1777 the\r\nqueen, besides her own fêtes, attends the balls of the Palais-Royal and\r\nthe masked balls of the opera; a little later, I find another ball at\r\nthe abode of the Comtesse Diana de Polignac, which she attends with\r\nthe whole royal family, except Mesdames, and which lasts from half-past\r\neleven o'clock at night until eleven o'clock the next morning.\r\nMeanwhile, on ordinary days, there is the rage of faro; in her drawing\r\nroom \"there is no limit to the play; in one evening the Duc de Chartres\r\nloses 8,000 louis. It really resembles an Italian carnival; there is\r\nnothing lacking, neither masks nor the comedy of private life; they\r\nplay, they laugh, they dance, they dine, they listen to music, they don\r\ncostumes, they get up picnics (fêtes-champêtres), they indulge in gossip\r\nand gallantries.\" \"The newest song,\"[2152] says a cultivated, earnest\r\nlady of the bedchamber, \"the current witticism and little scandalous\r\nstories, formed the sole subjects of conversation in the queen's circle\r\nof intimates.\"--As to the king, who is rather dull and who requires\r\nphysical exercise, the chase is his most important occupation.\r\nBetween 1755 and 1789,[2153] he himself, on recapitulating what he had\r\naccomplished, finds \"104 boar-hunts, 134 stag-hunts, 266 of bucks, 33\r\nwith hounds, and 1,025 shootings,\" in all 1,562 hunting-days, averaging\r\nat least one hunt every three days; besides this there are a 149\r\nexcursions without hunts, and 223 promenades on horseback or in\r\ncarriages. \"During four months of the year he goes to Rambouillet twice\r\na week and returns after having supped, that is to say, at three o'clock\r\nin the morning.\"[2154] This inveterate habit ends in becoming a mania,\r\nand even in something worse. \"The nonchalance,\" writes Arthur Young,\r\nJune 26, 1789, \"and even stupidity of the court, is unparalleled;\r\nthe moment demands the greatest decision, and yesterday, while it was\r\nactually a question whether he should be a doge of Venice or a king\r\nof France, the king went a hunting!\" His journal reads like that of a\r\ngamekeeper's. On reading it at the most important dates one is amazed at\r\nits entries. He writes nothing on the days not devoted to hunting, which\r\nmeans that to him these days are of no account:\r\n\r\nJuly 11, 1789, nothing; M. Necker leaves.\r\n\r\nJuly 12th vespers and benediction; Messieurs de Montmorin, de\r\nSaint-Priest and de la Luzerne leave.\r\n\r\nJuly 13th, nothing.\r\n\r\nJuly 14th, nothing.\r\n\r\nJuly 29th, nothing; M. Necker returns.....\r\n\r\nAugust 4th, stag-hunt in the forest at Marly; took one; go and come on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\nAugust 13th, audience of the States in the gallery; Te Deum during the\r\nmass below; one stag taken in the hunt at Marly. . .\r\n\r\nAugust 25th, complimentary audience of the States; high mass with\r\nthe cordons bleus; M. Bailly sworn in; vespers and benediction; state\r\ndinner....\r\n\r\nOctober 5th, shooting near Chatillon; killed 81 head; interrupted by\r\nevents; go and come on horseback.\r\n\r\nOctober 6th, leave for Paris at half-past twelve; visit the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville; sup and rest at the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nOctober 7th nothing; my aunts come and dine.\r\n\r\nOctober 8th, nothing. . .\r\n\r\nOctober 12th, nothing; the stag hunted at Port Royal.\r\n\r\nShut up in Paris, held by the crowds, his heart is always with the\r\nhounds. Twenty times in 1790 we read in his journal of a stag-hunt\r\noccurring in this or that place; he regrets not being on hand. No\r\nprivation is more intolerable to him; we encounter traces of his chagrin\r\neven in the formal protest he draws up before leaving for Varennes;\r\ntransported to Paris, shut up in the Tuileries, \"where, far from finding\r\nconveniences to which he is accustomed, he has not even enjoyed the\r\nadvantages common to persons in easy circumstances,\" his crown to him\r\nhaving apparently lost its brightest jewel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Upper Class Distractions.\r\n\r\n     Other similar lives.--Princes and princesses.--Seigniors of\r\n     the court.--Financiers and parvenus.--Ambassadors,\r\n     ministers, governors, general officers.\r\n\r\nAs is the general so is his staff; the grandees imitate their monarch.\r\nLike some costly colossal effigy in marble, erected in the center\r\nof France, and of which reduced copies are scattered by thousands\r\nthroughout the provinces, thus does royal life repeat itself, in minor\r\nproportions, even among the remotest gentry. The object is to make a\r\nparade and to receive; to make a figure and to pass away time in good\r\nsociety.--I find, first, around the court, about a dozen princely\r\ncourts. Each prince or princess of the blood royal, like the king, has\r\nhis house fitted up, paid for, in whole or in part, out of the treasury,\r\nits service divided into special departments, with gentlemen, pages, and\r\nladies in waiting, in brief, fifty, one hundred, two hundred, and even\r\nfive hundred appointments. There is a household of this kind for the\r\nqueen, one for Madame Victoire, one for Madame Elisabeth, one for\r\nMonsieur, one for Madame, one for the Comte d'Artois, and one for the\r\nComtesse d'Artois. There will be one for Madame Royale, one for the\r\nlittle Dauphin, one for the Duc de Normandie, all three children of the\r\nking, one for the Duc d'Angoulême, one for the Duc de Berry, both sons\r\nof the Comte d'Artois: children six or seven years of age receive and\r\nmake a parade of themselves. On referring to a particular date, in\r\n1771,[2155] I find still another for the Duc d'Orléans, one for the Duc\r\nde Bourbon, one for the Duchesse, one for the Prince de Condé, one for\r\nthe Comte de Clermont, one for the Princess dowager de Conti, one for\r\nthe Prince de Conti, one for the Comte de la Marche, one for the Duc\r\nde Penthièvre.--Each personage, besides his or her apartment under\r\nthe king's roof has his or her chateau and palace with his or her own\r\ncircle, the queen at Trianon and at Saint-Cloud, Mesdames at Bellevue,\r\nMonsieur at the Luxembourg and at Brunoy, the Comte d'Artois at Meudon\r\nand at Bagatelle, the Duc d'Orléans at the Palais Royal, at Monceaux, at\r\nRancy and at Villers-Cotterets, the Prince de Conti at the Temple and at\r\nIle-Adam, the Condés at the Palais-Bourbon and at Chantilly, the Duc de\r\nPenthièvre at Sceaux, Anet and Chateauvilain. I omit one-half of these\r\nresidences. At the Palais-Royal those who are presented may come to the\r\nsupper on opera days. At Chateauvilain all those who come to pay court\r\nare invited to dinner, the nobles at the duke's table and the rest at\r\nthe table of his first gentleman. At the Temple one hundred and fifty\r\nguests attend the Monday suppers. Forty or fifty persons, said the\r\nDuchesse de Maine, constitute \"a prince's private company.\"[2156] The\r\nprinces' train is so inseparable from their persons that it follows them\r\neven into camp. \"The Prince de Condé,\" says M. de Luynes, \"sets out\r\nfor the army to-morrow with a large suite: he has two hundred and\r\ntwenty-five horses, and the Comte de la Marche one hundred. M. le duc\r\nd'Orléans leaves on Monday; he has three hundred and fifty horses for\r\nhimself and suite.\"[2157] Below the rank of the king's relatives all the\r\ngrandees who figure at the court figure as well in their own residences,\r\nat their hotels at Paris or at Versailles, also in their chateaux a\r\nfew leagues away from Paris. On all sides, in the memoirs, we obtain a\r\nforeshortened view of some one of these seignorial existences. Such is\r\nthat of the Duc de Gèvres, first gentleman of the bedchamber, governor\r\nof Paris, and of the Ile-de-France, possessing besides this the special\r\ngovernorships of Laon, Soissons, Noyon, Crespy and Valois, the captainry\r\nof Mousseaux, also a pension of 20,000 livres, a veritable man of the\r\ncourt, a sort of sample in high relief of the people of his class, and\r\nwho, through his appointments, his airs, his luxury, his debts, the\r\nconsideration he enjoys, his tastes, his occupations and his turn of\r\nmind presents to us an abridgment of the fashionable world.[2158] His\r\nmemory for relationships and genealogies is surprising; he is an adept\r\nin the precious science of etiquette, and on these two grounds he is an\r\noracle and much consulted. \"He greatly increased the beauty of his house\r\nand gardens at Saint-Ouen. At the moment of his death,\" says the Duc de\r\nLuynes, \"he had just added twenty-five arpents to it which he had begun\r\nto enclose with a covered terrace. . . . He had quite a large household\r\nof gentlemen, pages, and domestic of various kinds, and his expenditure\r\nwas enormous. . . . He gave a grand dinner every day. . . . He gave\r\nspecial audiences almost daily. There was no one at the court, nor in\r\nthe city, who did not pay his respects to him. The ministers, the royal\r\nprinces themselves did so. He received company whilst still in bed. He\r\nwrote and dictated amidst a large assemblage. . . . His house at Paris\r\nand his apartment at Versailles were never empty from the time be arose\r\ntill the time he retired.\" 2 or 300 households at Paris, at Versailles\r\nand in their environs, offer a similar spectacle. Never is there\r\nsolitude. It is the custom in France, says Horace Walpole, to burn\r\nyour candle down to its snuff in public. The mansion of the Duchesse\r\nde Gramont is besieged at day-break by the noblest seigniors and the\r\nnoblest ladies. Five times a week, under the Duc de Choiseul's roof, the\r\nbutler enters the drawing room at ten o'clock in the evening to bestow\r\na glance on the immense crowded gallery and decide if he shall lay the\r\ncloth for fifty, sixty or eighty persons;[2159] with this example before\r\nthem all the rich establishments soon glory in providing an open\r\ntable for all comers. Naturally the parvenus, the financiers who have\r\npurchased or taken the name of an estate, all those traffickers and\r\nsons of traffickers who, since Law, associate with the nobility, imitate\r\ntheir ways. And I do not allude to the Bourets, the Beaujons, the St.\r\nJameses and other financial wretches whose paraphernalia effaces that\r\nof the princes; but take a plain associé des fermes, M. d'Epinay, whose\r\nmodest and refined wife refuses such excessive display.[2160] He had\r\njust completed his domestic arrangements, and was anxious that his\r\nwife should take a second maid; but she resisted; nevertheless, in this\r\ncurtailed household.\r\n\r\n\"The officers, women and valets, amounted to sixteen. . . . When M.\r\nd'Epinay gets up his valet enters on his duties. Two lackeys stand\r\nby awaiting his orders. The first secretary enters for the purpose of\r\ngiving an account of the letters received by him and which he has to\r\nopen; but he is interrupted two hundred times in this business by all\r\nsorts of people imaginable. Now it is a horse-jockey with the finest\r\nhorses to sell. . . . Again some saucy girl who calls to bawl out a\r\npiece of music, and on whose behalf some influence has been exerted to\r\nget her into the opera, after giving her a few lessons in good taste and\r\nteaching her what is proper in French music. This young lady has been\r\nmade to wait to ascertain if I am still at home. . . . I get up and go\r\nout. Two lackeys open the folding doors to let me make it through\r\nthis eye of a needle, while two servants bawl out in the ante-chamber,\r\n'Madame, gentlemen, Madame!' All form a line, the gentlemen consisting\r\nof dealers in fabrics, in instruments, jewellers, hawkers, lackeys,\r\nshoeblacks, creditors, in short everything imaginable that is most\r\nridiculous and annoying. The clock strikes twelve or one before this\r\ntoilet matter is over, and the secretary, who, doubtless, knows by\r\nexperience the impossibility of rendering a detailed statement of his\r\nbusiness, hands to his master a small memorandum informing him what he\r\nmust say in the assembly of fermiers.\"\r\n\r\nIndolence, disorder, debts, ceremony, the tone and ways of the patron,\r\nall seems a parody of the real thing. We are beholding the last\r\nstages of aristocracy. And yet the court of M. d'Epinay is a miniature\r\nresemblance of that of the king.\r\n\r\nSo much more essential is it that the ambassadors, ministers and general\r\nofficers who represent the king should display themselves in a grandiose\r\nmanner. No circumstance rendered the ancient régime so brilliant and\r\nmore oppressive; in this, as in all the rest, Louis XIV is the principal\r\noriginator of evil as of good. The policy which fashioned the court\r\nprescribed ostentation.\r\n\r\n\"A display of dress, table, equipages, buildings and play was made\r\npurposely to please; these afforded opportunities for entering into\r\nconversation with him. The contagion had spread from the court into the\r\nprovinces and to the armies, where people of any position were esteemed\r\nonly in proportion to their table and magnificence.\"[2161]\r\n\r\nDuring the year passed by the Marshal de Belle-Isle at Frankfort, on\r\naccount of the election of Charles VI, he expended 750,000 livres in\r\njourneys, transportations, festivals and dinners, in constructing\r\na kitchen and dining-hall, and besides all this, 150,000 livres in\r\nsnuff-boxes, watches and other presents; by order of Cardinal Fleury, so\r\neconomical, he had in his kitchens one hundred and one officials.[2162]\r\nAt Vienna, in 1772, the ambassador, the Prince de Rohan, had two\r\ncarriages costing together 40,000 livres, forty horses, seven noble\r\npages, six gentlemen, five secretaries, ten musicians, twelve footmen,\r\nand four grooms whose gorgeous liveries each cost 4,000 livres, and the\r\nrest in proportion.[2163] We are familiar with the profusion, the good\r\ntaste, the exquisite dinners, and the admirable ceremonial display of\r\nthe Cardinal de Bernis in Rome. \"He was called the king of Rome, and\r\nindeed he was such through his magnificence and in the consideration he\r\nenjoyed. . . . His table afforded an idea of what is possible. . .\r\nIn festivities, ceremonies and illuminations he was always beyond\r\ncomparison.\" He himself remarked, smiling, \"I keep a French inn on the\r\ncross-roads of Europe.\"[2164] Accordingly their salaries and indemnities\r\nare two or three times more ample than at the present day. \"The king\r\ngives 50,000 crowns to the great embassies. The Duc de Duras received\r\neven 200,000 livres per annum for that of Madrid, also, besides this,\r\n100,000 crowns gratuity, 50,000 livres for secret service; and he had\r\nthe loan of furniture and effects valued at 400,000 and 500,000 livres,\r\nof which he kept one-half.\"[2165] The outlays and salaries of the\r\nministers are similar. In 1789, the Chancellor gets 120,080 livres\r\nsalary and the Keeper of the Seals 135,000. \"M. de Villedeuil,\r\nas Secretary of State, was to have had 180,670 livres, but as he\r\nrepresented that this sum would not cover his expenses, his salary was\r\nraised to 226,000 livres, everything included.\"[2166] Moreover, the\r\nrule is, that on retiring from office the king awards them a pension of\r\n20,000 livres and gives a dowry of 200,000 livres to their daughters.\r\nThis is not excessive considering the way they live. \"They are obliged\r\nto maintain such state in their households, for they cannot enrich\r\nthemselves by their places. All keep open table at Paris three days in\r\nthe week, and at Fontainebleau every day.\"[2167] M. de Lamoignon being\r\nappointed Chancellor with a salary of 100,000 livres, people at\r\nonce declare that he will be ruined;[2168] \"for he has taken all the\r\nofficials of M. d'Aguesseau's kitchen, whose table alone cost 80,000\r\nlivres. The banquet he gave at Versailles to the first council held\r\nby him cost 6,000 livres, and he must always have seats at table, at\r\nVersailles and at Paris, for twenty persons.\" At Chambord,[2169] Marshal\r\nde Saxe always has two tables, one for sixty, and the other for eighty\r\npersons; also four hundred horses in his stables, a civil list of more\r\nthan 100,000 crowns, a regiment of Uhlans for his guard, and a theater\r\ncosting over 600,000 livres, while the life he leads, or which is\r\nmaintained around him, resembles one of Rubens's bacchanalian scenes. As\r\nto the special and general provincial governors we have seen that, when\r\nthey reside on the spot, they fulfill no other duty than to entertain;\r\nalongside of them the intendant, who alone attends to business,\r\nlikewise receives, and magnificently, especially for the country of\r\na States-General. Commandants, lieutenants-general, the envoys of\r\nthe central government throughout, are equally induced by habit and\r\npropriety, as well as by their own lack of occupation, to maintain a\r\ndrawing-room; they bring along with them the elegance and hospitality of\r\nVersailles. If the wife follows them she becomes weary and \"vegetates\r\nin the midst of about fifty companions, talking nothing but commonplace,\r\nknitting or playing lotto, and sitting three hours at the dinner table.\"\r\nBut \"all the military men, all the neighboring gentry and all the ladies\r\nin the town,\" eagerly crowd to her balls and delight in commending\r\n\"her grace, her politeness, her equality.\"[2170] These sumptuous\r\nhabits prevail even among people of secondary position. By virtue of\r\nestablished usage colonels and captains entertain their subordinates\r\nand thus expend \"much beyond their salaries.\"[2171] This is one of the\r\nreasons why regiments are reserved for the sons of the best families,\r\nand companies in them for wealthy gentlemen. The vast royal tree,\r\nexpanding so luxuriantly at Versailles, sends forth its offshoots to\r\noverrun France by thousands, and to bloom everywhere, as at Versailles,\r\nin bouquets of finery and of drawing room sociability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Provincial Nobility.\r\n\r\n     Prelates, seigniors and minor provincial nobles.--The feudal\r\n     aristocracy transformed into a drawing room group.\r\n\r\nFollowing this pattern, and as well through the effect of temperature,\r\nwe see, even in remote provinces, all aristocratic branches having a\r\nflourishing social life. Lacking other employment, the nobles exchange\r\nvisits, and the chief function of a prominent seignior is to do the\r\nhonors of his house creditably. This applies as well to ecclesiastics as\r\nto laymen. The one hundred and thirty-one bishops and archbishops, the\r\nseven hundred abbés-commendatory, are all men of the world; they behave\r\nwell, are rich, and are not austere, while their episcopal palace or\r\nabbey is for them a country-house, which they repair or embellish with\r\na view to the time they pass in it, and to the company they welcome to\r\nit.[2172] At Clairvaux, Dom Rocourt, very affable with men and still\r\nmore gallant with the ladies, never drives out except with four horses,\r\nand with a mounted groom ahead; his monks do him the honors of a\r\nMonseigneur, and he maintains a veritable court. The chartreuse of Val\r\nSaint-Pierre is a sumptuous palace in the center of an immense domain,\r\nand the father-procurator, Dom Effinger, passes his days in entertaining\r\nhis guests.[2173] At the convent of Origny, near Saint-Quentin,[2174]\r\n\"the abbess has her domestics and her carriage and horses, and receives\r\nmen on visits, who dine in her apartments.\" The princess Christine,\r\nabbess of Remiremont, with her lady canonesses, are almost always\r\ntraveling; and yet \"they enjoy themselves in the abbey,\" entertaining\r\nthere a good many people \"in the private apartments of the princess, and\r\nin the strangers' rooms.\"[2175] The twenty-five noble chapters of\r\nwomen, and the nineteen noble chapters of men, are as many permanent\r\ndrawing-rooms and gathering places incessantly resorted to by the fine\r\nsociety which a slight ecclesiastical barrier scarcely divides from the\r\ngreat world from which it is recruited. At the chapter of Alix, near\r\nLyons, the canonesses wear hoopskirts into the choir, \"dressed as in the\r\nworld outside,\" except that their black silk robes and their mantles are\r\nlined with ermine.[2176] At the chapter of Ottmarsheim in Alsace, \"our\r\nweek was passed in promenading, in visiting the traces of Roman roads,\r\nin laughing a good deal, and even in dancing, for there were many\r\npeople visiting the abbey, and especially talking over dresses.\" Near\r\nSarrebuis, the canonesses of Loutre dine with the officers and are\r\nanything but prudish.[2177] Numbers of convents serve as agreeable and\r\nrespectable asylums for widowed ladies, for young women whose husbands\r\nare in the army, and for young ladies of rank, while the superior,\r\ngenerally some noble damsel, wields, with ease and dexterity, the\r\nscepter of this pretty feminine world. But nowhere is the pomp of\r\nhospitality or the concourse greater, than in the episcopal palaces.\r\nI have described the situation of the bishops; with their opulence,\r\npossessors of the like feudal rights, heirs and successors to the\r\nancient sovereigns of the territory, and besides all this, men of the\r\nworld and frequenters of Versailles, why should they not keep a court?\r\nA Cicé, archbishop of Bordeaux, a Dillon, archbishop of Narbonne, a\r\nBrienne, archbishop of Toulouse, a Castellane, bishop of Mende and\r\nseignior-suzerain of the whole of Gévaudan, an archbishop of Cambrai,\r\nduke of Cambray, seignior-suzerain of the whole of Cambrésis, and\r\npresident by birth of the provincial States-General, are nearly all\r\nprinces; why not parade themselves like princes? Hence, they build,\r\nhunt and have their clients and guests, a lever, an antechamber, ushers,\r\nofficers, a free table, a complete household, equipages, and, oftener\r\nstill, debts, the finishing touch of a grand seignior. In the almost\r\nregal palace which the Rohans, hereditary bishops of Strasbourg and\r\ncardinals from uncle to nephew, erected for themselves at Saverne,[2178]\r\nthere are 700 beds, 180 horses, 14 butlers, and 25 valets. \"The whole\r\nprovince assembles there;\" the cardinal lodges as many as two hundred\r\nguests at a time, without counting the valets; at all times there are\r\nfound under his roof \"from twenty to thirty ladies the most agreeable of\r\nthe province, and this number is often increased by those of the court\r\nand from Paris. . . . The entire company sup together at nine o'clock in\r\nthe evening, which always looks like a fête,\" and the cardinal himself\r\nis its chief ornament. Splendidly dressed, fine-looking, gallant,\r\nexquisitely polite, the slightest smile is a grace. \"His face, always\r\nbeaming, inspired confidence; he had the true physiognomy of a man\r\nexpressly designed for pompous display.\"\r\n\r\nSuch likewise is the attitude and occupation of the principal lay\r\nseigniors, at home, in summer, when a love of the charms of fine weather\r\nbrings them back to their estates. For example, Harcourt in Normandy and\r\nBrienne in Champagne are two chateaux the best frequented. \"Persons of\r\ndistinction resort to it from Paris, eminent men of letters, while the\r\nnobility of the canton pay there an assiduous court.\"[2179] There is\r\nno residence where flocks of fashionable people do not light down\r\npermanently to dine, to dance, to hunt, to gossip, to unravel,[2180]\r\n(parfiler) to play comedy. We can trace these birds from cage to cage;\r\nthey remain a week, a month, three months, displaying their plumage and\r\ntheir prattle. From Paris to Ile-Adam, to Villers-Cotterets, to Frétoy,\r\nto Planchette, to Soissons, to Rheims, to Grisolles, to Sillery, to\r\nBraine, to Balincourt, to Vaudreuil, the Comte and Comtesse de Genlis\r\nthus bear about their leisure, their wit, their gaiety, at the domiciles\r\nof friends whom, in their turn, they entertain at Genlis. A glance at\r\nthe exteriors of these mansions suffices to show that it was the chief\r\nduty in these days to be hospitable, as it was a prime necessity to\r\nbe in society.[2181] Their luxury, indeed, differs from ours. With the\r\nexception of a few princely establishments it is not great in the matter\r\nof country furniture; a display of this description is left to the\r\nfinanciers. \"But it is prodigious in all things which can minister to\r\nthe enjoyment of others, in horses, carriages, and in an open table, in\r\naccommodations given even to people not belonging to the house, in boxes\r\nat the play which are lent to friends, and lastly, in servants, much\r\nmore numerous than nowadays.\" Through this mutual and constant attention\r\nthe most rustic nobles lose the rust still encrusting their brethren in\r\nGermany or in England. We find in France few Squire Western and Barons\r\nde Thunder-ten-Troenck; an Alsatian lady, on seeing at Frankfort\r\nthe grotesque country squires of Westphalia, is struck with the\r\ncontrast.[2182] Those of France, even in distant provinces, have\r\nfrequented the drawing-rooms of the commandant and intendant, and have\r\nencountered on their visits some of the ladies from Versailles; hence\r\nthey always show some familiarity with superior manners and some\r\nknowledge of the changes of fashion and dress.\" The most barbarous will\r\ndescend, with his hat in his hand, to the foot of his steps to escort\r\nhis guests, thanking them for the honor they have done him. The greatest\r\nrustic, when in a woman's presence, dives down into the depths of his\r\nmemory for some fragment of chivalric gallantry. The poorest and most\r\nsecluded furbishes up his coat of royal blue and his cross of St.\r\nLouis that he may, when the occasion offers, tender his respects to his\r\nneighbor, the grand seignior, or to the prince who is passing by.\r\n\r\nThus is the feudal staff wholly transformed, from the lowest to the\r\nhighest grades. Taking in at one glance its 30 or 40,000 palaces,\r\nmansions, manors and abbeys, what a brilliant and engaging scene France\r\npresents! She is one vast drawing-room, and I detect only drawing room\r\ncompany. Everywhere the rude chieftains once possessing authority have\r\nbecome the masters of households administering favors. Their society is\r\nthat in which, before fully admiring a great general, the question is\r\nasked, \"is he amiable?\" Undoubtedly they still wear swords, and are\r\nbrave through pride and tradition, and they know how to die, especially\r\nin duels and according to form. But worldly traits have hidden the\r\nancient military groundwork; at the end of the eighteenth century their\r\ngenius is to be wellbred and their employment consists in entertaining\r\nor in being entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2101: \"Mémoires de Laporte\" (1632). \"M. d'Epernon came to\r\nBordeaux, where he found His Eminence very ill.

The Versailles Almanach of 1775, for instance, states that\r\nthere were only 335 men in the stables while we see that in reality the\r\nnumber was four or five times as many.--\"Previous to all the reforms,\r\nsays a witness, I believe that the number of the king's horses amounted\r\nto 3,000.\" (D'Hézecques, \"Souvenirs d'un page de Louis XVI.,\" p. 121.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2114: La Maison du Roi justifiée par un soldat citoyen,\" (1786)\r\naccording to Statements published by the government.--\"La future maison\r\ndu roi\" (1790). \"The two stables cost in 1786, the larger one 4,207,606\r\nlivres, and the smaller 3,509,402 livres, a total of 7,717,058 livres,\r\nof which 486,546 were for the purchase of horses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2115: On my arrival at Versailles (1786), there were 150 pages,\r\nnot including those of the princes of the blood who lived at Paris.

DRAWING ROOM LIFE.[2201]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n     Perfect only in France.--Reasons for this derived from the\r\n     French character.--Reasons derived from the tone of the\r\n     court.--This life becomes more and more agreeable and\r\n     absorbing.\r\n\r\nSimilar circumstances have led other aristocracies in Europe to nearly\r\nsimilar ways and habits. There also the monarchy has given birth to the\r\ncourt and the court to a refined society. But the development of this\r\nrare plant has been only partial. The soil was unfavorable and the\r\nseed was not of the right sort. In Spain, the king stands shrouded\r\nin etiquette like a mummy in its wrappings, while a too rigid pride,\r\nincapable of yielding to the amenities of the worldly order of things,\r\nends in a sentiment of morbidity and in insane display.[2202] In\r\nItaly, under petty despotic sovereigns, and most of them strangers, the\r\nconstant state of danger and of hereditary distrust, after having tied\r\nall tongues, turns all hearts towards the secret delights of love and\r\ntowards the mute gratification of the fine arts. In Germany and in\r\nEngland, a cold temperament, dull and rebellious to culture, keeps\r\nman, up to the close of the last century, within the Germanic habits\r\nof solitude, inebriety and brutality. In France, on the contrary,\r\nall things combine to make the social sentiment flourish; in this\r\nthe national genius harmonizes with the political regime, the plant\r\nappearing to be selected for the soil beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman loves company through instinct, and the reason is that he\r\ndoes well and easily whatever society calls upon him to do. He has not\r\nthe false shame which renders his northern neighbors awkward, nor the\r\npowerful passions which absorb his neighbors of the south. Talking is\r\nno effort to him, having none of the natural timidity which begets\r\nconstraint, and with no constant preoccupation to overcome. He\r\naccordingly converses at his ease, ever on the alert, and conversation\r\naffords him extreme pleasure. For the happiness which he requires is of\r\na peculiar kind: delicate, light, rapid, incessantly renewed and varied,\r\nin which his intellect, his vanity, all his emotional and sympathetic\r\nfaculties find nourishment; and this quality of happiness is provided\r\nfor him only in society and in conversation. Sensitive as he is,\r\npersonal attention, consideration, cordiality, delicate flattery,\r\nconstitute his natal atmosphere, outside which he breathes with\r\ndifficulty. He would suffer almost as much in being impolite as in\r\nencountering impoliteness in others. For his instincts of kindliness and\r\nvanity there is an exquisite charm in the habit of being amiable, and\r\nthis is all the greater because it proves contagious. When we afford\r\npleasure to others there is a desire to please us, and what we bestow\r\nin deference is returned in attentions. In company of this kind one\r\ncan talk, for to talk is to amuse another in being oneself amused, a\r\nFrenchman finding no pleasure equal to it.[2203] Lively and sinuous,\r\nconversation to him is like the flying of a bird; he wings his way\r\nfrom idea to idea, alert, excited by the inspiration of others, darting\r\nforward, wheeling round and unexpectedly returning, now up, now down,\r\nnow skimming the ground, now aloft on the peaks, without sinking into\r\nquagmires, or getting entangled in the briers, and claiming nothing of\r\nthe thousands of objects he slightly grazes but the diversity and the\r\ngaiety of their aspects.\r\n\r\nThus endowed, and thus disposed, he is made for a régime which, for ten\r\nhours a day, brings men together; natural feeling in accord with the\r\nsocial order of things renders the drawing room perfect. The king, at\r\nthe head of all, sets the example. Louis XIV had every qualification\r\nfor the master of a household: a taste for pomp and hospitality,\r\ncondescension accompanied with dignity, the art of playing on the\r\nself-esteem of others and of maintaining his own position, chivalrous\r\ngallantry, tact, and even charms of intellectual expression. \"His\r\naddress was perfect;[2204] whether it was necessary to jest, or he\r\nwas in a playful humor, or deigned to tell a story, it was ever with\r\ninfinite grace, and a noble refined air which I have found only in\r\nhim.\" \"Never was man so naturally polite,[2205] nor of such circumspect\r\npoliteness, so powerful by degrees, nor who better discriminated age,\r\nworth, and rank, both in his replies and in his deportment. . . .\r\nHis salutations, more or less marked, but always slight, were of\r\nincomparable grace and majesty. . . . He was admirable in the different\r\nacknowledgments of salutes at the head of the army and at reviews. . . .\r\nBut especially toward women, there was nothing like it. . . . Never did\r\nhe pass the most insignificant woman without taking off his hat to her;\r\nand I mean chambermaids whom he knew to be such. . . Never did he chance\r\nto say anything disobliging to anybody. . . . Never before company\r\nanything mistimed or venturesome, but even to the smallest gesture, his\r\nwalk, his bearing, his features, all were proper, respectful, noble,\r\ngrand, majestic, and thoroughly natural.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the model, and, nearly or remotely, it is imitated up to the end\r\nof the ancient régime. If it undergoes any change, it is only to become\r\nmore sociable. In the eighteenth century, except on great ceremonial\r\noccasions, it is seen descending step by step from its pedestal. It\r\nno longer imposes \"that stillness around it which lets one hear a fly\r\nwalk.\" \"Sire,\" said the Marshal de Richelieu, who had seen three reigns,\r\naddressing Louis XVI, \"under Louis XIV no one dared utter a word; under\r\nLouis XV people whispered; under your Majesty they talk aloud.\" If\r\nauthority is a loser, society is the gainer; etiquette, insensibly\r\nrelaxed, allows the introduction of ease and cheerfulness. Henceforth\r\nthe great, less concerned in overawing than in pleasing, cast off\r\nstateliness like an uncomfortable and ridiculous garment, \"seeking\r\nrespect less than applause. It no longer suffices to be affable; one\r\nhas to appear amiable at any cost with one's inferiors as with one's\r\nequals.\"[2206] The French princes, says again a contemporary lady, \"are\r\ndying with fear of being deficient in favors.\"[2207] Even around the\r\nthrone \"the style is free and playful.\" The grave and disciplined court\r\nof Louis XIV became at the end of the century, under the smiles of the\r\nyouthful queen, the most seductive and gayest of drawing-rooms. Through\r\nthis universal relaxation, a worldly existence gets to be perfect.\r\n\"He who has not lived before 1789,\" says Talleyrand at a later period,\r\n\"knows nothing of the charm of living.\" It was too great; no other way\r\nof living was appreciated; it engrossed man wholly. When society becomes\r\nso attractive, people live for it alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Social Life Has Priority.\r\n\r\n     Subordination of it to other interests and duties.\r\n     --Indifference to public affairs.--They are merely a subject\r\n     of jest.--Neglect of private affairs.--Disorder in the\r\n     household and abuse of money.\r\n\r\nThere is neither leisure nor taste for other matters, even for things\r\nwhich are of most concern to man, such as public affairs, the household,\r\nand the family.--With respect to the first, I have already stated that\r\npeople abstain from them, and are indifferent; the administration of\r\nthings, whether local or general, is out of their hands and no longer\r\ninterests them. They only allude to it in jest; events of the most\r\nserious consequence form the subject of witticisms. After the edict of\r\nthe Abbé Terray, which half ruined the state creditors, a spectator, too\r\nmuch crowded in the theater, cried out, \"Ah, how unfortunate that our\r\ngood Abbé Terray is not here to cut us down one-half!\" Everybody laughs\r\nand applauds. All Paris the following day, is consoled for public\r\nruin by repeating the phrase.--Alliances, battles, taxation, treaties,\r\nministries, coups d'état, the entire history of the country, is put\r\ninto epigrams and songs. One day,[2208] in an assembly of young people\r\nbelonging to the court, one of them, as the current witticism was\r\npassing around, raised his hands in delight and exclaimed, \"How can one\r\nhelp being pleased with great events, even with disturbances, when\r\nthey provide us with such amusing witticisms!\" Thereupon the sarcasms\r\ncirculate, and every disaster in France is turned into nonsense. A song\r\non the battle of Hochstaedt was pronounced poor, and some one in\r\nthis connection said \"I am sorry that battle was lost--the song is\r\nso worthless.\"[2209]--Even when eliminating from this trait all that\r\nbelongs to the sway of impulse and the license of paradox, there remains\r\nthe stamp of an age in which the State is almost nothing and society\r\nalmost everything. We may on this principle divine what order of talent\r\nwas required in the ministers. M. Necker, having given a magnificent\r\nsupper with serious and comic opera, \"finds that this festivity is\r\nworth more to him in credit, favor, and stability than all his financial\r\nschemes put together. . . . His last arrangement concerning the\r\nvingtième was only talked about for one day, while everybody is\r\nstill talking about his fête; at Paris, as well as in Versailles, its\r\nattractions are dwelt on in detail, people emphatically declaring that\r\nMonsieur and Mme. Necker are a grace to society.\"[2210] Good society\r\ndevoted to pleasure imposes on those in office the obligation of\r\nproviding pleasures for it. It might also say, in a half-serious,\r\nhalf-ironical tone, with Voltaire, \"that the gods created kings only to\r\ngive fêtes every day, provided they varied; that life is too short to\r\nmake any other use of it; that lawsuits, intrigues, warfare, and the\r\nquarrels of priests, which consume human life, are absurd and horrible\r\nthings; that man is born only to enjoy himself;\" and that among the\r\nessential things we must put the \"superfluous\" in the first rank.\r\n\r\nAccording to this, we can easily foresee that they will be as\r\nlittle concerned with their private affairs as with public affairs.\r\nHousekeeping, the management of property, domestic economy, are in\r\ntheir eyes vulgar, insipid in the highest degree, and only suited to an\r\nintendant or a butler. Of what use are such persons if we must have such\r\ncares? Life is no longer a festival if one has to provide the ways and\r\nmeans. Comforts, luxuries, the agreeable must flow naturally and greet\r\nour lips of their own accord. As a matter of course and without his\r\nintervention, a man belonging to this world should find gold always in\r\nhis pocket, a handsome coat on his toilet table, powdered valets in his\r\nantechamber, a gilded coach at his door, a fine dinner on his table, so\r\nthat he may reserve all his attention to be expended in favors on\r\nthe guests in his drawing-room. Such a mode of living is not to be\r\nmaintained without waste, and the domestics, left to themselves, make\r\nthe most of it. What matter is it, so long as they perform their duties?\r\nMoreover, everybody must live, and it is pleasant to have contented and\r\nobsequious faces around one.--Hence the first houses in the kingdom\r\nare given up to pillage. Louis XV, on a hunting expedition one day,\r\naccompanied by the Duc de Choiseul,[2211] inquired of him how much he\r\nthought the carriage in which they were seated had cost. M. de Choiseul\r\nreplied that he should consider himself fortunate to get one like it for\r\n5,000 or 6,000 francs; but, \"His Majesty paying for it as a king, and\r\nnot always paying cash, might have paid 8,000 francs for it.\"--\"You are\r\nwide of the mark,\" rejoined the king, \"for this vehicle, as you see it,\r\ncost me 30,000 francs. . . . The robberies in my household are enormous,\r\nbut it is impossible to put a stop to them.\"--So the great help\r\nthemselves as well as the little, either in money, or in kind, or in\r\nservices. There are in the king's household fifty-four horses for the\r\ngrand equerry, thirty-eight of them being for Mme. de Brionne, the\r\nadministratrix of the office of the stables during her son's minority;\r\nthere are two hundred and fifteen grooms on duty, and about as many\r\nhorses kept at the king's expense for various other persons, entire\r\nstrangers to the department.[2212] What a nest of parasites on this\r\none branch of the royal tree! Elsewhere I find Madame Elisabeth, so\r\nmoderate, consuming fish amounting to 30,000 francs per annum; meat and\r\ngame to 70,000 francs; candles to 60,000 francs; Mesdames burn white and\r\nyellow candles to the amount of 215,068 francs; the light for the\r\nqueen comes to 157,109 francs. The street at Versailles is still shown,\r\nformerly lined with stalls, to which the king's valets resorted to\r\nnourish Versailles by the sale of his dessert. There is no article from\r\nwhich the domestic insects do not manage to scrape and glean something.\r\nThe king is supposed to drink orgeat and lemonade to the value of 2,190\r\nfrancs. \"The grand broth, day and night,\" which Mme. Royale, aged six\r\nyears, sometimes drinks, costs 5,201 francs per annum. Towards the end\r\nof the preceding reign[2213] the femmes-de-chambre enumerate in the\r\nDauphine's outlay \"four pairs of shoes per week; three ells of ribbon\r\nper diem, to tie her dressing-gown; two ells of taffeta per diem, to\r\ncover the basket in which she keeps her gloves and fan.\" A few years\r\nearlier the king paid 200,000 francs for coffee, lemonade, chocolate,\r\nbarley-water, and water-ices; several persons were inscribed on the list\r\nfor ten or twelve cups a day, while it was estimated that the coffee,\r\nmilk and bread each morning for each lady of the bed-chamber cost 2,000\r\nfrancs per annum.[2214] We can readily understand how, in households\r\nthus managed, the purveyors are willing to wait. They wait so well that\r\noften under Louis XV they refuse to provide and \"hide themselves.\" Even\r\nthe delay is so regular that, at last; they are obliged to pay them five\r\nper cent. interest on their advances; at this rate, in 1778, after all\r\nTurgot's economic reforms, the king still owes nearly 800,000 livres\r\nto his wine merchant, and nearly three millions and a half to his\r\npurveyor.[2215] The same disorder exists in the houses which surround\r\nthe throne. \"Mme. de Guéménée owes 60,000 livres to her shoe-maker,\r\n16,000 livres to her paper-hanger, and the rest in proportion.\" Another\r\nlady, whom the Marquis de Mirabeau sees with hired horses, replies\r\nat his look of astonishment, \"It is not because there are not seventy\r\nhorses in our stables, but none of them are able to walk to day.\"[2216]\r\nMme. de Montmorin, on ascertaining that her husband's debts are greater\r\nthan his property, thinks she can save her dowry of 200,000 livres,\r\nbut is informed that she had given security for a tailor's bill,\r\nwhich, \"incredible and ridiculous to say, amounts to the sum of 180,000\r\nlivres.\"[2217] \"One of the decided manias of these days,\" says Mme.\r\nd'Oberkirk, \"is to be ruined in everything and by everything.\" \"The\r\ntwo brothers Villemer build country cottages at from 500,000 to 600,000\r\nlivres; one of them keeps forty horses to ride occasionally in the Bois\r\nde Boulogne on horseback.\"[2218] In one night M. de Chenonceaux, son of\r\nM. et Mme. Dupin, loses at play 700,000 livres. \"M. de Chenonceaux\r\nand M. de Francueil ran through seven or eight millions at this epoch.\r\n\"[2219] \"The Duc de Lauzun, at the age of twenty-six, after having run\r\nthrough the capital of 100,000 crowns revenue, is prosecuted by his\r\ncreditors for nearly two millions of indebtedness.\"[2220] \"M. le Prince\r\nde Conti lacks bread and wood, although with an income of 600,000\r\nlivres,\" for the reason that \"he buys and builds wildly on all\r\nsides.\"[2221] Where would be the pleasure if these people were\r\nreasonable? What kind of a seignior is he who studies the price of\r\nthings? And how can the exquisite be reached if one grudges money?\r\nMoney, accordingly, must flow and flow on until it is exhausted, first\r\nby the innumerable secret or tolerated bleedings through domestic\r\nabuses, and next in broad streams of the master's own prodigality,\r\nthrough structures, furniture, toilets, hospitality, gallantry, and\r\npleasures. The Comte d'Artois, that he may give the queen a fête,\r\ndemolishes, rebuilds, arranges, and furnishes Bagatelle from top to\r\nbottom, employing nine hundred workmen, day and night, and, as there is\r\nno time to go any distance for lime, plaster, and cut stone, he sends\r\npatrols of the Swiss guards on the highways to seize, pay for, and\r\nimmediately bring in all carts thus loaded.[2222] The Marshal de\r\nSoubise, entertaining the king one day at dinner and over night, in his\r\ncountry house, expends 200,000 livres.[2223] Mme. de Matignon makes\r\na contract to be furnished every day with a new head-dress at 24,000\r\nlivres per annum. Cardinal de Rohan has an alb bordered with point lace,\r\nwhich is valued at more than 100,000 livres, while his kitchen utensils\r\nare of massive silver.[2224]--Nothing is more natural, considering their\r\nideas of money; hoarded and piled up, instead of being a fertilizing\r\nstream, it is a useless marsh exhaling bad odors. The queen, having\r\npresented the Dauphin with a carriage whose silver-gilt trappings are\r\ndecked with rubies and sapphires, naively exclaims, \"Has not the king\r\nadded 200,000 livres to my treasury? That is no reason for keeping\r\nthem!\"[2225] They would rather throw it out of the window. Which was\r\nactually done by the Marshal de Richelieu with a purse he had given to\r\nhis grandson, and which the lad, not knowing how to use, brought back\r\nintact. Money, on this occasion, was at least of service to the passing\r\nstreet-sweeper that picked it up. But had there been no passer-by to\r\npick it up, it would have been thrown into the river. One day Mme.\r\nde B--, being with the Prince de Conti, hinted that she would like a\r\nminiature of her canary bird set in a ring. The Prince offers to have it\r\nmade. His offer is accepted, but on condition that the miniature be\r\nset plain and without jewels. Accordingly the miniature is placed in a\r\nsimple rim of gold. But, to cover over the painting, a large diamond,\r\nmade very thin, serves as a glass. Mme. de B--, having returned the\r\ndiamond, \"M. le Prince de Conti had it ground to powder which he used\r\nto dry the ink of the note he wrote to Mme. de B--on the subject.\" This\r\npinch of powder cost 4 or 5,000 livres, but we may divine the turn and\r\ntone of the note. The extreme of profusion must accompany the height\r\nof gallantry, the man of the world being so much the more important\r\naccording to his contempt for money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Universal Pleasure Seeking.\r\n\r\n     Moral divorce of husband and wife.--Gallantry.--Separation\r\n     of parents and children.--Education, its object and\r\n     omissions.--The tone of servants and purveyors.--Pleasure\r\n     seeking universal.\r\n\r\nIn a drawing room the woman who receives the least attention from a man\r\nis his own wife, and she returns the compliment. Hence at a time like\r\nthis, when people live for society and in society, there is no place for\r\nconjugal intimacy.--Moreover, when a married couple occupy an exalted\r\nposition they are separated by custom and decorum. Each party has his or\r\nher own household, or at least their own apartments, servants, equipage,\r\nreceptions and distinct society, and, as entertainment entails ceremony,\r\nthey stand towards each other in deference to their rank on the footing\r\nof polite strangers. They are each announced in each other's apartment;\r\nthey address each other \"Madame, Monsieur,\" and not alone in public,\r\nbut in private; they shrug their shoulders when, sixty leagues out from\r\nParis, they encounter in some old chateau a provincial wife ignorant\r\nenough to say \"my dear\" to her husband before company.[2226]--Already\r\nseparated at the fireside, the two lives diverge beyond it at an ever\r\nincreasing radius. The husband has a government of his own: his private\r\ncommand, his private regiment, his post at court, which keeps him absent\r\nfrom home; only in his declining years does his wife consent to follow\r\nhim into garrison or into the provinces.[2227] And rather is this the\r\ncase because she is herself occupied, and as seriously as himself; often\r\nwith a position near a princess, and always with an important circle\r\nof company which she must maintain. At this epoch woman is as active\r\nas man,[2228] following the same career, and with the same resources,\r\nconsisting of the flexible voice, the winning grace, the insinuating\r\nmanner, the tact, the quick perception of the right moment, and the art\r\nof pleasing, demanding, and obtaining; there is not a lady at court who\r\ndoes not bestow regiments and benefices. Through this right the wife has\r\nher personal retinue of solicitors and protégés, also, like her husband,\r\nher friends, her enemies, her own ambitions, disappointments, and\r\nrancorous feeling; nothing could be more effectual in the disruption\r\nof a household than this similarity of occupation and this division\r\nof interests.--The tie thus loosened ends by being sundered under the\r\nascendancy of opinion. \"It looks well not to live together,\" to grant\r\neach other every species of tolerance, and to devote oneself to society.\r\nSociety, indeed, then fashions opinion, and through opinion it creates\r\nthe morals which it requires.\r\n\r\nToward the middle of the century the husband and wife lodged under the\r\nsame roof, but that was all. \"They never saw each other, one never met\r\nthem in the same carriage; they are never met in the same house;\r\nnor, with very good reason, are they ever together in public.\" Strong\r\nemotions would have seemed odd and even \"ridiculous;\" in any event\r\nunbecoming; it would have been as unacceptable as an earnest remark\r\n\"aside\" in the general current of light conversation. Each has a duty to\r\nall, and for a couple to entertain each other is isolation; in company\r\nthere is no right to the tête-à-tête.[2229] It was hardly allowed for\r\na few days to lovers.[2230] And even then it was regarded unfavorably;\r\nthey were found too much occupied with each other. Their preoccupation\r\nspread around them an atmosphere of \"constraint and ennui; one had to\r\nbe upon one's guard and to check oneself.\" They were \"dreaded.\" The\r\nexigencies of society are those of an absolute king, and admit of no\r\npartition. \"If morals lost by this, society was infinitely the gainer,\"\r\nsays M. de Bezenval, a contemporary; \"having got rid of the annoyances\r\nand dullness caused by the husbands' presence, the freedom was extreme;\r\nthe coquetry both of men and women kept up social vivacity and daily\r\nprovided piquant adventures.\" Nobody is jealous, not even when in love.\r\n\"People are mutually pleased and become attached; if one grows weary\r\nof the other, they part with as little concern as they came together.\r\nShould the sentiment revive they take to each other with as much\r\nvivacity as if it were the first time they had been engaged. They may\r\nagain separate, but they never quarrel. As they have become enamored\r\nwithout love, they part without hate, deriving from the feeble desire\r\nthey have inspired the advantage of being always ready to oblige.\"[2231]\r\nAppearances, moreover, are respected. An uninformed stranger would\r\ndetect nothing to excite suspicion. An extreme curiosity, says Horace\r\nWalpole,[2232] or a great familiarity with things, is necessary to\r\ndetect the slightest intimacy between the two sexes. No familiarity is\r\nallowed except under the guise of friendship, while the vocabulary\r\nof love is as much prohibited as its rites apparently are. Even with\r\nCrébillon fils, even with Laclos, at the most exciting moments, the\r\nterms their characters employ are circumspect and irreproachable.\r\nWhatever indecency there may be, it is never expressed in words, the\r\nsense of propriety in language imposing itself not only on the outbursts\r\nof passion, but again on the grossness of instincts. Thus do the\r\nsentiments which are naturally the strongest lose their point and\r\nsharpness; their rich and polished remains are converted into playthings\r\nfor the drawing room, and, thus cast to and fro by the whitest hands,\r\nfall on the floor like a shuttlecock. We must, on this point, listen to\r\nthe heroes of the epoch; their free and easy tone is inimitable, and it\r\ndepicts both them and their actions. \"I conducted myself,\" says the Duc\r\nde Lauzun, \"very prudently, and even deferentially with Mme. de Lauzun;\r\nI knew Mme. de Cambis very openly, for whom I concerned myself very\r\nlittle; I kept the little Eugénie whom I loved a great deal; I played\r\nhigh, I paid my court to the king, and I hunted with him with great\r\npunctuality.\"[2233] He had for others, withal, that indulgence of which\r\nhe himself stood in need. \"He was asked what he would say if his wife\r\n(whom he had not seen for ten years) should write to him that she had\r\njust discovered that she was enceinte. He reflected a moment and then\r\nreplied, 'I would write, and tell her that I was delighted that heaven\r\nhad blessed our union; be careful of your health; I will call and pay my\r\nrespects this evening.'\" There are countless replies of the same sort,\r\nand I venture to say that, without having read them, one could not\r\nimagine to what a degree social art had overcome natural instincts.\r\n\r\n\"Here at Paris,\" writes Mme. d'Oberkirk, \"I am no longer my own\r\nmistress. I scarcely have time to talk with my husband and to answer my\r\nletters. I do not know what women do that are accustomed to lead this\r\nlife; they certainly have no families to look after, nor children\r\nto educate.\" At all events they act as if they had none, and the men\r\nlikewise. Married people not living together live but rarely with their\r\nchildren, and the causes that disintegrate wedlock also disintegrate the\r\nfamily. In the first place there is the aristocratic tradition, which\r\ninterposes a barrier between parents and children with a view to\r\nmaintain a respectful distance. Although enfeebled and about to\r\ndisappear,[2234] this tradition still subsists. The son says \"Monsieur\"\r\nto his father; the daughter comes \"respectfully\" to kiss her mother's\r\nhand at her toilet. A caress is rare and seems a favor; children\r\ngenerally, when with their parents, are silent, the sentiment that\r\nusually animates them being that of deferential timidity. At one time\r\nthey were regarded as so many subjects, and up to a certain point they\r\nare so still; while the new exigencies of worldly life place them or\r\nkeep them effectually aside. M. de Talleyrand stated that he had never\r\nslept under the same roof with his father and mother. And if they do\r\nsleep there, they are not the less neglected. \"I was entrusted,\" says\r\nthe Count de Tilly, \"to valets; and to a kind of preceptor resembling\r\nthese in more respects than one.\" During this time his father ran after\r\nwomen. \"I have known him,\" adds the young man, \"to have mistresses up\r\nto an advanced age; he was always adoring them and constantly abandoning\r\nthem.\" The Duc de Lauzun finds it difficult to obtain a good tutor for\r\nhis son; for this reason the latter writes, \"he conferred the duty on\r\none of my late mother's lackeys who could read and write tolerably well,\r\nand to whom the title of valet-de-chambre was given to insure greater\r\nconsideration. They gave me the most fashionable teachers besides; but\r\nM. Roch (which was my mentor's name) was not qualified to arrange their\r\nlessons, or to qualify me to benefit by them. I was, moreover, like\r\nall the children of my age and of my station, dressed in the handsomest\r\nclothes to go out, and naked and dying with hunger in the house,\"[2235]\r\nand not through unkindness, but through household oversight,\r\ndissipation, and disorder, attention being given to things elsewhere.\r\nOne might easily count the fathers who, like the Marshal de Belle-Isle,\r\nbrought up their sons under their own eyes, and themselves attended to\r\ntheir education methodically, strictly, and with tenderness. As to the\r\ngirls, they were placed in convents; relieved from this care, their\r\nparents only enjoy the greater freedom. Even when they retain charge\r\nof them they are scarcely more of a burden to them. Little Félicité de\r\nSaint-Aubin[2236] sees her parents \"only on their waking up and at meal\r\ntimes.\" Their day is wholly taken up; the mother is making or receiving\r\nvisits; the father is in his laboratory or engaged in hunting. Up to\r\nseven years of age the child passes her time with chambermaids who teach\r\nher only a little catechism, \"with an infinite number of ghost stories.\"\r\nAbout this time she is taken care of; but in a way which well portrays\r\nthe epoch. The Marquise, her mother, the author of mythological and\r\npastoral operas, has a theater built in the chateau; a great crowd of\r\ncompany resorts to it from Bourbon-Lancy and Moulins; after rehearsing\r\ntwelve weeks the little girl, with a quiver of arrows and blue wings,\r\nplays the part of Cupid, and the costume is so becoming she is allowed\r\nto wear it in common during the entire day for nine months. To finish\r\nthe business they send for a dancing-fencing master, and, still wearing\r\nthe Cupid costume, she takes lessons in fencing and in deportment. \"The\r\nentire winter is devoted to playing comedy and tragedy.\" Sent out of\r\nthe room after dinner, she is brought in again only to play on the\r\nharpsichord or to declaim the monologue of Alzire before a numerous\r\nassembly. Undoubtedly such extravagances are not customary; but the\r\nspirit of education is everywhere the same; that is to say, in the eyes\r\nof parents there is but one intelligible and rational existence, that\r\nof society, even for children, and the attentions bestowed on these are\r\nsolely with a view to introduce them into it or to prepare them for\r\nit. Even in the last years of the ancient régime[2237] little boys\r\nhave their hair powdered, \"a pomatumed chignon (bourse), ringlets, and\r\ncurls\"; they wear the sword, the chapeau under the arm, a frill, and a\r\ncoat with gilded cuffs; they kiss young ladies' hands with the air of\r\nlittle dandies. A lass of six years is bound up in a whalebone waist;\r\nher large hoop-petticoat supports a skirt covered with wreaths; she\r\nwears on her head a skillful combination of false curls, puffs, and\r\nknots, fastened with pins, and crowned with plumes, and so high that\r\nfrequently \"the chin is half way down to her feet\"; sometimes they put\r\nrouge on her face. She is a miniature lady, and she knows it; she is\r\nfully up in her part, without effort or inconvenience, by force of\r\nhabit; the unique, the perpetual instruction she gets is that on her\r\ndeportment; it may be said with truth that the fulcrum of education in\r\nthis country is the dancing-master.[2238] They could get along with him\r\nwithout any others; without him the others were of no use. For, without\r\nhim, how could people go through easily, suitably, and gracefully the\r\nthousand and one actions of daily life, walking, sitting down, standing\r\nup, offering the arm, using the fan, listening and smiling, before eyes\r\nso experienced and before such a refined public? This is to be the great\r\nthing for them when they become men and women, and for this reason it is\r\nthe thing of chief importance for them as children. Along with graces\r\nof attitude and of gesture, they already have those of the mind and\r\nof expression. Scarcely is their tongue loosened when they speak the\r\npolished language of their parents. The latter amuse themselves with\r\nthem and use them as pretty dolls; the preaching of Rousseau, which,\r\nduring the last third of the last century, brought children into\r\nfashion, produces no other effect. They are made to recite their lessons\r\nin public, to perform in proverbs, to take parts in pastorals. Their\r\nsallies are encouraged. They know how to turn a compliment, to invent\r\na clever or affecting repartee, to be gallant, sensitive, and even\r\nspirituelle. The little Duc d'Angoulême, holding a book in his hand,\r\nreceives Suffren, whom he addresses thus: \"I was reading Plutarch and\r\nhis illustrious men. You could not have entered more apropos.\"[2239]\r\nThe children of M. de Sabran, a boy and a girl, one eight and the other\r\nnine, having taken lessons from the comedians Sainval and Larive, come\r\nto Versailles to play before the king and queen in Voltaire's \"Oreste,\"\r\nand on the little fellow being interrogated about the classic authors,\r\nhe replies to a lady, the mother of three charming girls, \"Madame,\r\nAnacreon is the only poet I can think of here!\" Another, of the same\r\nage, replies to a question of Prince Henry of Prussia with an agreeable\r\nimpromptu in verse.[2240] To cause witticisms, trivialities, and\r\nmediocre verse to germinate in a brain eight years old, what a triumph\r\nfor the culture of the day! It is the last characteristic of the régime\r\nwhich, after having stolen man away from public affairs, from his own\r\naffairs, from marriage, from the family, hands him over, with all his\r\nsentiments and all his faculties, to social worldliness, him and all\r\nthat belong to him. Below him fine ways and forced politeness\r\nprevail, even with his servants and tradesmen. A Frontin has a gallant\r\nunconstrained air, and he turns a compliment.[2241] An Abigail needs\r\nonly to be a kept mistress to become a lady. A shoemaker is a \"monsieur\r\nin black,\" who says to a mother on saluting the daughter, \"Madame, a\r\ncharming young person, and I am more sensible than ever of the value of\r\nyour kindness,\" on which the young girl, just out of a convent, takes\r\nhim for a suitor and blushes scarlet. Undoubtedly less unsophisticated\r\neyes would distinguish the difference between this pinchbeck louis d'or\r\nand a genuine one; but their resemblance suffices to show the universal\r\naction of the central mint-machinery which stamps both with the same\r\neffigy, the base metal and the refined gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Enjoyment.\r\n\r\n     The charm of this life.--Etiquette in the 18th Century.--Its\r\n     perfection and its resources.--Taught and prescribed under\r\n     feminine authority.\r\n\r\nA society which obtains such ascendancy must possess some charm; in no\r\ncountry, indeed, and in no age has so perfect a social art rendered life\r\nso agreeable. Paris is the school-house of Europe, a school of urbanity\r\nto which the youth of Russia, Germany, and England resort to become\r\ncivilized. Lord Chesterfield in his letters never tires of reminding\r\nhis son of this, and of urging him into these drawing-rooms, which will\r\nremove \"his Cambridge rust.\" Once familiar with them they are never\r\nabandoned, or if one is obliged to leave them, one always sighs for\r\nthem. \"Nothing is comparable,\" says Voltaire,[2242] \"to the genial\r\nlife one leads there in the bosom of the arts and of a calm and refined\r\nvoluptuousness; strangers and monarchs have preferred this repose, so\r\nagreeably occupied in it and so enchanting to their own countries and\r\nthrones. The heart there softens and melts away like aromatics slowly\r\ndissolving in moderate heat, evaporating in delightful perfumes.\"\r\nGustavus III, beaten by the Russians, declares that he will pass his\r\nlast days in Paris in a house on the boulevards; and this is not merely\r\ncomplimentary, for he sends for plans and an estimate.[2243] A supper\r\nor an evening entertainment brings people two hundred leagues away. Some\r\nfriends of the Prince de Ligne \"leave Brussels after breakfast, reach\r\nthe opera in Paris just in time to see the curtain rise, and, after\r\nthe spectacle is over, return immediately to Brussels, traveling all\r\nnight.\"--Of this delight, so eagerly sought, we have only imperfect\r\ncopies, and we are obliged to revive it intellectually. It consists, in\r\nthe first place, in the pleasure of living with perfectly polite people;\r\nthere is no enjoyment more subtle, more lasting, more inexhaustible.\r\nMan's self-esteem or vanity being infinite, intelligent people are\r\nalways able to produce some refinement of attention to gratify it.\r\nWorldly sensibility being infinite there is no imperceptible shade of it\r\npermitting indifference. After all, Man is still the greatest source\r\nof happiness or of misery to Man, and in those days this everflowing\r\nfountain brought to him sweetness instead of bitterness. Not only was\r\nit essential not to offend, but it was essential to please; one was\r\nexpected to lose sight of oneself in others, to be always cordial and\r\ngood-humored, to keep one's own vexations and grievances in one's\r\nown breast, to spare others melancholy ideas and to supply them with\r\ncheerful ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Was any one old in those days? It is the Revolution which brought old\r\nage into the world, Your grandfather, my child,[2244] was handsome,\r\nelegant, neat, gracious, perfumed, playful, amiable, affectionate, and\r\ngood-tempered to the day of his death. People then knew how to live and\r\nhow to die; there was no such thing as troublesome infirmities. If\r\nany one had the gout, 'he walked along all the same and made no faces;\r\npeople well brought up concealed their sufferings. There was none of\r\nthat absorption in business which spoils a man inwardly and dulls his\r\nbrain. People knew how to ruin themselves without letting it appear,\r\nlike good gamblers who lose their money without showing uneasiness or\r\nspite. A man would be carried half dead to a hunt. It was thought better\r\nto die at a ball or at the play than in one's bed, between four wax\r\ncandles and horrid men in black. People were philosophers; they did not\r\nassume to be austere, but often were so without making a display of it.\r\nIf one was discreet, it was through inclination and without pedantry or\r\nprudishness. People enjoyed this life, and when the hour of departure\r\ncame they did not try to disgust others with living. The last request of\r\nmy old husband was that I would survive him as long as possible and live\r\nas happily as I could.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, especially, women are concerned it is not sufficient to be polite;\r\nit is important to be gallant. Each lady invited by the Prince de Conti\r\nto Ile-Adam \"finds a carriage and horses at her disposal; she is free to\r\ngive dinners every day in her own rooms to her own friends.\"[2245] Mme.\r\nde Civrac having to go to the springs, her friends undertake to divert\r\nher on the journey; they keep ahead of her a few posts, and, at every\r\nplace where she rests for the night, they give her a little féte\r\nchampêtre disguised as villagers and in bourgeois attire, with bailiff\r\nand scrivener, and other masks all singing and reciting verses. A lady\r\non the eve of Longchamp, knowing that the Vicomte de V--possesses two\r\ncalèches, makes a request for one of them; it is disposed of; but he is\r\ncareful not to decline, and immediately has one of the greatest elegance\r\npurchased to lend it for three hours; he is only too happy that anybody\r\nshould wish to borrow from him, his prodigality appearing amiable but\r\nnot astonishing.[2246] The reason is that women then were queens in\r\nthe drawing-room; it is their right; this is the reason why, in the\r\neighteenth century, they prescribe the law and the fashion in all\r\nthings.[2247] Having formed the code of usages, it is quite natural that\r\nthey should profit by it, and see that all its prescriptions are carried\r\nout. In this respect any circle \"of the best company\" is a superior\r\ntribunal, serving as a court of last appeal.[2248] The Maréchale de\r\nLuxembourg is an authority; there is no point of manners which she does\r\nnot justify with an ingenious argument. Any expression, any neglect of\r\nthe standard, the slightest sign of pretension or of vanity incurs her\r\ndisapprobation, from which there is no appeal, and the delinquent is\r\nfor ever banished from refined society. Any subtle observation, any\r\nwell-timed silence, an \"oh\" uttered in an appropriate place instead\r\nof an \"Ah,\" secures from her, as from M. Talleyrand, a diploma of good\r\nbreeding which is the commencement of fame and the promise of a fortune.\r\nUnder such an \"instructress\" it is evident that deportment, gesture,\r\nlanguage, every act or omission in this mundane sphere, becomes, like\r\na picture or poem, a veritable work of art; that is to say, infinite in\r\nrefinement, at once studied and easy, and so harmonious in its details\r\nthat its perfection conceals the difficulty of combining them.\r\n\r\nA great lady \"receives ten persons with one courtesy, bestowing on each,\r\nthrough the head or by a glance, all that he is entitled to;\"[2249]\r\nmeaning by this the shade of regard due to each phase of position,\r\nconsideration, and birth. \"She has always to deal with easily irritated\r\namour-propres; consequently the slightest deficiency in proportion\r\nwould be promptly detected,\"[2250] But she is never mistaken, and\r\nnever hesitates in these subtle distinctions; with incomparable tact,\r\ndexterity, and flexibility of tone, she regulates the degrees of her\r\nwelcome. She has one \"for women of condition, one for women of quality,\r\none for women of the court, one for titled women, one for women of\r\nhistoric names, another for women of high birth personally, but married\r\nto men beneath them; another for women who by marriage have changed a\r\ncommon into a distinguished name; another still for women of reputable\r\nnames in the law; and, finally, another for those whose relief consists\r\nchiefly of expensive houses and good suppers.\" A stranger would be\r\namazed on seeing with what certain and adroit steps she circulates among\r\nso many watchful vanities without ever hurting or being hurt. \"She knows\r\nhow to express all through the style of her salutations; a varied style,\r\nextending through imperceptible gradations, from the accessory of a\r\nsingle shrug of the shoulder, almost an impertinence, to that noble and\r\ndeferential reverence which so few women, even of the court, know how to\r\ndo well; that slow bending forward, with lowered eyes and straightened\r\nfigure, gradually recovering and modestly glancing at the person while\r\ngracefully raising the body up, altogether much more refined and more\r\ndelicate than words, but very expressive as the means of manifesting\r\nrespect.\"--This is but a single action, and very common; there are\r\na hundred others, and of importance. Imagine, if it is possible, the\r\ndegree of elegance and perfection to which they attained through good\r\nbreeding. I select one at random, a duel between two princes of the\r\nblood, the Comte d'Artois and the Duc de Bourbon; the latter being\r\nthe offended party, the former, his superior, had to offer him a\r\nmeeting[2251], \"As soon as the Comte d'Artois saw him he leaped to the\r\nground, and walking directly up to him, said to him smiling: 'Monsieur,\r\nthe public pretends that we are seeking each other.' The Duc de\r\nBourbon, removing his hat, replied, 'Monsieur, I am here to receive your\r\norders.'--'To execute your own,' returned the Comte d'Artois, 'but you\r\nmust allow me to return to my carriage.' He comes back with a sword, and\r\nthe duel begins. After a certain time they are separated, the seconds\r\ndeciding that honor is satisfied, 'It is not for me to express an\r\nopinion,' says the Comte d'Artois, 'Monsieur le Duc de Bourbon is to\r\nexpress his wishes; I am here only to receive his orders.'--'Monsieur,'\r\nresponds the Duc de Bourbon, addressing the Comte d'Artois, meanwhile\r\nlowering the point of his sword, 'I am overcome with gratitude for\r\nyour kindness, and shall never be insensible to the honor you have\r\ndone me.'\"--Could there be a more just and delicate sentiment of rank,\r\nposition, and circumstance, and could a duel be surrounded with more\r\ngraces? There is no situation, however thorny, which is not saved by\r\npoliteness. Through habit, and a suitable expression, even in the face\r\nof the king, they conciliate resistance and respect. When Louis XV,\r\nhaving exiled the Parliament, caused it to be proclaimed through Mme. Du\r\nBarry that his mind was made up and that it would not be changed, \"Ah,\r\nMadame,\" replied the Duc de Nivernais, \"when the king said that he\r\nwas looking at yourself.\"--\"My dear Fontenelle,\" said one of his lady\r\nfriends to him, placing her hand on his heart, \"the brain is there\r\nlikewise.\" Fontenelle smiled and made no reply. We see here, even\r\nwith an academician, how truths are forced down, a drop of acid in a\r\nsugar-plum; the whole so thoroughly intermingled that the piquancy\r\nof the flavor only enhances its sweetness. Night after night, in each\r\ndrawing-room, sugar-plums of this description are served up, two or\r\nthree along with the drop of acidity, all the rest not less exquisite,\r\nbut possessing only the sweetness and the perfume. Such is the art of\r\nsocial worldliness, an ingenious and delightful art, which, entering\r\ninto all the details of speech and of action, transforms them into\r\ngraces; which imposes on man not servility and falsehood, but civility\r\nand concern for others, and which, in exchange, extracts for him out of\r\nhuman society all the pleasure it can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Happiness.\r\n\r\n     What constitutes happiness in the 18th Century.--The\r\n     fascination of display.--Indolence, recreation, light\r\n     conversation.\r\n\r\nOne can very well understand this kind of pleasure in a summary way,\r\nbut how is it to be made apparent? Taken by themselves the pastimes of\r\nsociety are not to be described; they are too ephemeral; their charm\r\narises from their accompaniments. A narrative of them would be but\r\ntasteless dregs, does the libretto of an opera give any idea of the\r\nopera itself?--If the reader would revive for himself this vanished\r\nworld let him seek for it in those works that have preserved its\r\nexternals or its accent, and first in the pictures and engravings of\r\nWatteau, Fragonard and the Saint-Aubins, and then in the novels and\r\ndramas of Voltaire and Marivaux, and even in Collé and Crébillon\r\nfils;[2252] then do we see the breathing figures and hear their voices,\r\nWhat bright, winning, intelligent faces beaming with pleasure and with\r\nthe desire to please! What ease in bearing and in gesture! What piquant\r\ngrace in the toilet, in the smile, in vivaciousness of expression, in\r\nthe control of the fluted voice, in the coquetry of hidden meanings! How\r\ninvoluntarily we stop to look and listen! Attractiveness is everywhere,\r\nin the small spirituelle heads, in the slender hands, in the rumpled\r\nattire, in the pretty features, in the demeanor. The slightest gesture,\r\na pouting or mutinous turn of the head, a plump little wrist peering\r\nfrom its nest of lace, a yielding waist bent over an embroidery frame,\r\nthe rapid rustling of an opening fan, is a feast for the eyes and the\r\nintellect. It is indeed all daintiness, a delicate caress for delicate\r\nsenses, extending to the external decoration of life, to the sinuous\r\noutlines, the showy drapery, and the refinements of comfort in the\r\nfurniture and architecture. Fill your imagination with these accessories\r\nand with these figures and you will take as much interest in their\r\namusements as they did. In such a place and in such company it suffices\r\nto be together to be content. Their indolence is no burden to them\r\nfor they sport with existence.--At Chanteloup, the Duc de Choiseul, in\r\ndisgrace, finds the fashionable world flocking to see him; nothing is\r\ndone and yet no hours of the day are unoccupied.[2253] \"The Duchess has\r\nonly two hours' time to herself and these two hours are devoted to her\r\ntoilet and her letters; the calculation is a simple one: she gets up at\r\neleven; breakfasts at noon, and this is followed by conversation, which\r\nlasts three or four hours; dinner comes at six, after which there is\r\nplay and the reading of the memoirs of Mme. de Maintenon.\" Ordinarily\r\n\"the company remains together until two o'clock in the morning.\"\r\nIntellectual freedom is complete. There is no confusion, no anxiety.\r\nThey play whist and tric-trac in the afternoon and faro in the evening.\r\n\"They do to day what they did yesterday and what they will do to-morrow;\r\nthe dinner-supper is to them the most important affair in life, and\r\ntheir only complaint in the world is of their digestion. Time goes so\r\nfast I always fancy that I arrived only the evening before.\" Sometimes\r\nthey get up a little race and the ladies are disposed to take part in\r\nit, \"for they are all very agile and able to run around the drawing room\r\nfive or six times every day.\" But they prefer indoors to the open air;\r\nin these days true sunshine consists of candle-light and the finest sky\r\nis a painted ceiling; is there any other less subject to inclemencies or\r\nbetter adapted to conversation and merriment?--They accordingly chat and\r\njest, in words with present friends, and by letters with absent friends.\r\nThey lecture old Mme. du Deffant, who is too lively and whom they style\r\nthe \"little girl\"; the young Duchesse, tender and sensible, is \"her\r\ngrandmamma.\" As for \"grandpapa,\" M. de Choiseul, \"a slight cold keeping\r\nhim in bed he has fairy stories read to him all day long, a species of\r\nreading to which we are all given; we find them as probable as modern\r\nhistory. Do not imagine that he is unoccupied. He has had a tapestry\r\nframe put up in the drawing room at which he works, I cannot say with\r\nthe greatest skill, but at least with the greatest assiduity. . . . Now,\r\nour delight is in flying a kite; grandpapa has never seen this sight\r\nand he is enraptured with it.\" The pastime, in itself, is nothing; it is\r\nresorted to according to opportunity or the taste of the hour, now taken\r\nup and now let alone, and the abbé soon writes: \"I do not speak about\r\nour races because we race no more, nor of our readings because we do not\r\nread, nor of our promenades because we do not go out. What, then, do\r\nwe do? Some play billiards, others dominoes, and others backgammon. We\r\nweave, we ravel and we unravel. Time pushes us on and we pay him back.\"\r\n\r\nOther circles present the same spectacle. Every occupation being an\r\namusement, a caprice or an impulse of fashion brings one into favor.\r\nAt present, it is unraveling, every white hand at Paris, and in the\r\nchateaux, being busy in undoing trimmings, epaulettes and old stuffs, to\r\npick out the gold and silver threads. They find in this employment\r\nthe semblance of economy, an appearance of occupation, in any event\r\nsomething to keep them in countenance. On a circle of ladies being\r\nformed, a big unraveling bag in green taffeta is placed on the table,\r\nwhich belongs to the lady of the house; immediately all the ladies call\r\nfor their bags and \"voilà les laquais en l'air\"[2254] It is all the\r\nrage. They unravel every day and several hours in the day; some derive\r\nfrom it a hundred louis d'or per annum. The gentlemen are expected to\r\nprovide the materials for the work; the Duc de Lauzun, accordingly,\r\ngives to Madame de V--a harp of natural size covered with gold thread;\r\nan enormous golden fleece, brought as a present from the Comte de\r\nLowenthal, and which cost 2 or 3,000 francs, brings, picked to pieces,\r\n5 or 600 francs. But they do not look into matters so closely. Some\r\nemployment is essential for idle hands, some manual outlet for nervous\r\nactivity; a humorous petulance breaks out in the middle of the pretended\r\nwork. One day, when about going out, Madame de R--observes that the gold\r\nfringe on her dress would be capital for unraveling, whereupon, with a\r\ndash, she cuts one of the fringes off. Ten women suddenly surround a man\r\nwearing fringes, pull off his coat and put his fringes and laces\r\ninto their bags, just as if a bold flock of tomtits, fluttering and\r\nchattering in the air, should suddenly dart on a jay to pluck out its\r\nfeathers; thenceforth a man who enters a circle of women stands in\r\ndanger of being stripped alive. All this pretty world has the same\r\npastimes, the men as well as the women. Scarcely a man can be found\r\nwithout some drawing room accomplishment, some trifling way of keeping\r\nhis mind and hands busy, and of filling up the vacant hour; almost all\r\nmake rhymes, or act in private theatricals; many of them are musicians\r\nand painters of still-life subjects. M. de Choiseul, as we have just\r\nseen, works at tapestry; others embroider or make sword-knots. M. de\r\nFrancueil is a good violinist and makes violins himself; and besides\r\nthis he is \"watchmaker, architect, turner, painter, locksmith,\r\ndecorator, cook, poet, music-composer and he embroiders remarkably\r\nwell.\"[2255] In this general state of inactivity it is essential \"to\r\nknow how to be pleasantly occupied in behalf of others as well as in\r\none's own behalf.\" Madame de Pompadour is a musician, an actress, a\r\npainter and an engraver. Madame Adelaide learns watchmaking and plays\r\non all instruments from a horn to the jew's-harp; not very well, it is\r\ntrue, but as well as a queen can sing, whose fine voice is ever only\r\nhalf in tune. But they make no pretensions. The thing is to amuse\r\noneself and nothing more; high spirits and the amenities of the\r\nhour cover all. Rather read this capital fact of Madame de Lauzun at\r\nChanteloup: \"Do you know,\" writes the abbé, \"that nobody possesses in\r\na higher degree one quality you would never suspect of her, that of\r\npreparing scrambled eggs? This talent has been buried in the ground, she\r\ncannot recall the time she acquired it; I believe that she had it at\r\nher birth. Accident made it known, and immediately it was put to test.\r\nYesterday morning, an hour for ever memorable in the history of eggs,\r\nthe implements necessary for this great operation were all brought out,\r\na heater, some gravy, some pepper and eggs. Behold Madame de Lauzun, at\r\nfirst blushing and in a tremor, soon with intrepid courage, breaking the\r\neggs, beating them up in the pan, turning them over, now to the right,\r\nnow to the left, now up and now down, with unexampled precision and\r\nsuccess! Never was a more excellent dish eaten.\" What laughter and\r\ngaiety in the group comprised in this little scene. And, not long after,\r\nwhat madrigals and allusions! Gaiety here resembles a dancing ray of\r\nsunlight; it flickers over all things and reflects its grace on every\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Gaiety.\r\n\r\n     Gaiety in the 18th Century.--Its causes and effects.--\r\n     Toleration and license.--Balls, fêtes, hunts, banquets,\r\n     pleasures.--Freedom of the magistrates and prelates.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman's characteristic,\" says an English traveler in 1785, \"is\r\nto be always gay;\"[2256] and he remarks that he must be so because, in\r\nFrance, such is the tone of society and the only mode of pleasing the\r\nladies, the sovereigns of society and the arbiters of good taste. Add\r\nto this the absence of the causes which produce modern dreariness, and\r\nwhich convert the sky above our heads into one of leaden gloom. There\r\nwas no laborious, forced work in those days, no furious competition, no\r\nuncertain careers, no infinite perspectives. Ranks were clearly\r\ndefined, ambitions limited, there was less envy. Man was not habitually\r\ndissatisfied, soured and preoccupied as he is nowadays. Few free passes\r\nwere allowed where there was no right to pass; we think of nothing\r\nbut advancement; they thought only of amusing themselves. An officer,\r\ninstead of raging and storming over the army lists, busies himself in\r\ninventing some new disguise for a masked ball; a magistrate, instead of\r\ncounting the convictions he has secured, provides a magnificent supper.\r\nAt Paris, every afternoon in the left avenue of the Palais-Royal, \"fine\r\ncompany, very richly dressed, gather under the large trees;\" and in the\r\nevening \"on leaving the opera at half-past eight, they go back there and\r\nremain until two o'clock in the morning.\" They have music in the open\r\nair by moonlight, Gavat singing, and the chevalier de Saint-George\r\nplaying on the violin.[2257] At Moffontaine, \"the Comte de Vaudreuil,\r\nLebrun the poet, the chevalier de Coigny, so amiable and so gay,\r\nBrongniart, Robert, compose charades every night and wake each other\r\nup to repeat them.\" At Maupertuis in M. de Montesquiou's house, at\r\nSaint-Ouen with the Marshal de Noailles, at Genevilliers with the Comte\r\nde Vandreuil, at Rainay with the Duc d'Orléans, at Chantilly with the\r\nPrince de Condé, there is nothing but festivity. We read no biography\r\nof the day, no provincial document, no inventory, without hearing the\r\ntinkling of the universal carnival. At Monchoix,[2258] the residence of\r\nthe Comte de Bédé, Châteaubriand's uncle, \"they had music, dancing and\r\nhunting, rollicking from morning to night, eating up both capital and\r\nincome.\" At Aix and Marseilles, throughout the fashionable world, with\r\nthe Comte de Valbelle, I find nothing but concerts, entertainment,\r\nballs, gallantries, and private theatricals with the Comtesse de\r\nMirabeau for the leading performer. At Chateauroux, M. Dupin de\r\nFrancueil entertains \"a troop of musicians, lackeys, cooks, parasites,\r\nhorses and dogs, bestowing everything lavishly, in amusements and in\r\ncharity, wishing to be happy himself and everybody else around him,\"\r\nnever casting up accounts, and going to ruin in the most delightful\r\nmanner possible. Nothing arrests this gaiety, neither old age, exile,\r\nnor misfortune; in 1793 it still subsists in the prisons of the\r\nRepublic. A man in place is not then made uncomfortable by his official\r\ncoat, puffed up by his situation, obliged to maintain a dignified and\r\nimportant air, constrained under that assumed gravity which democratic\r\nenvy imposes on us as if a ransom. In 1753,[2259] the parliamentarians,\r\njust exiled to Bourges, get up three companies of private theatricals\r\nand perform comedies, while one of them, M. Dupré de Saint-Maur, fights\r\na rival with the sword. In 1787,[2260] when the entire parliament is\r\nbanished to Troyes the bishop, M. de Barral, returns from his chateau de\r\nSaint-Lye expressly to receive it, presiding every evening at a dinner\r\nof forty persons. \"There was no end to the fêtes and dinners in the\r\ntown; the president kept open house,\" a triple quantity of food being\r\nconsumed in the eating-houses and so much wood burned in the kitchens,\r\nthat the town came near being put on short allowance. Feasting and\r\njollity is but little less in ordinary times. A parliamentarian, like\r\na seignior, must do credit to his fortune. See the letters of the\r\nPresident des Brosses concerning society in Dijon; it reminds us of the\r\nabbey of Thélème; then contrast this with the same town today.[2261] In\r\n1744, Monseigneur de Montigny, brother of the President de Bourbonne,\r\napropos of the king's recovery, entertains the workmen, tradesmen and\r\nartisans in his employ to the number of eighty, another table being for\r\nhis musicians and comedians, and a third for his clerks, secretaries,\r\nphysicians, surgeons, attorneys and notaries; the crowd collects\r\naround a triumphal car covered with shepherdesses, shepherds and rustic\r\ndivinities in theatrical costume; fountains flow with wine \"as if it\r\nwere water,\" and after supper the confectionery is thrown out of the\r\nwindows. Each parliamentarian around him has his \"little Versailles, a\r\ngrand hotel between court and garden,\" This town, now so silent, then\r\nrang with the clatter of fine equipages. The profusion of the table is\r\nastonishing, \"not only on gala days, but at the suppers of each week,\r\nand I could almost say, of each day.\"--Amidst all these fête-givers,\r\nthe most illustrious of all, the President des Brosses, so grave on the\r\nmagisterial bench, so intrepid in his remonstrances, so laborious,[2262]\r\nso learned, is an extraordinary stimulator of fun (boute-entrain), a\r\ngenuine Gaul, with a sparkling, inexhaustible fund of salacious\r\nhumor: with his friends he throws off his perruque, his gown, and even\r\nsomething more. Nobody dreams of being offended by it; nobody conceives\r\nthat dress is an extinguisher, which is true of every species of dress,\r\nand of the gown in particular. \"When I entered society, in 1785,\" writes\r\na parliamentarian, \"I found myself introduced in a certain way, alike to\r\nthe wives and the mistresses of the friends of my family, passing Monday\r\nevening with one, and Tuesday evening with the other. And I was only\r\neighteen, and I belonged to a family of magistrates.\"[2263] At Basville,\r\nat the residence of M. de Lamoignon, during the autumnal vacation and\r\nthe Whitsuntide holidays, there are thirty persons at the table\r\ndaily; there are three or four hunts a week, and the most prominent\r\nmagistrates, M. de Lamoignon, M. Pasquier, M. de Rosambo, M. and Mme.\r\nd'Aguesseau, perform the \"Barber of Seville\" in the chateau theater.\r\n\r\nAs for the cassock, it enjoys the same freedom as the robe. At Saverne,\r\nat Clairvaux, at Le Mans and at other places, the prelates wear it as\r\nfreely as a court dress. The revolutionary upheaval was necessary\r\nto make it a fixture on their bodies, and, afterwards, the hostile\r\nsupervision of an organized party and the fear of constant danger. Up to\r\n1789 the sky is too serene and the atmosphere too balmy to lead them to\r\nbutton it up to the neck. \"Freedom, facilities, Monsieur l'Abbé,\" said\r\nthe Cardinal de Rohan to his secretary, \"without these this life would\r\nbe a desert.\"[2264] This is what the good cardinal took care to avoid;\r\non the contrary he had made Saverne an enchanting world according to\r\nWatteau, almost \"a landing-place for Cythera.\" Six hundred peasants and\r\nkeepers, ranged in a line a league long, form in the morning and beat\r\nup the surrounding country, while hunters, men and women, are posted at\r\ntheir stations. \"For fear that the ladies might be frightened if left\r\nalone by themselves, the man whom they hated least was always left with\r\nthem to make them feel at ease,\" and as nobody was allowed to leave his\r\npost before the signal \"it was impossible to be surprised.\"--About one\r\np.m. \"the company gathered under a beautiful tent, on the bank of a\r\nstream or in some delightful place, where an exquisite dinner was served\r\nup, and, as everybody had to be made happy, each peasant received a\r\npound of meat, two of bread and half a bottle of wine, they, as well as\r\nthe ladies, only asking to begin it all over again.\" The accommodating\r\nprelate might certainly have replied to scrupulous people along with\r\nVoltaire, that \"nothing wrong can happen in good society.\" In fact, so\r\nhe did and in appropriate terms. One day, a lady accompanied by a young\r\nofficer, having come on a visit, and being obliged to keep them over\r\nnight, his valet comes and whispers to him that there is no more\r\nroom.--\"'Is the bath-room occupied?'--'No, Monseigneur!'--'Are there\r\nnot two beds there?'--'Yes, Monseigneur, but they are both in the same\r\nchamber, and that officer. . . '--'Very well, didn't they come together?\r\nNarrow people like you always see something wrong. You will find that\r\nthey will get along well together; there is not the slightest reason to\r\nconsider the matter.'\" And really nobody did object, either the officer\r\nor the lady.--At Granselve, in the Gard, the Bernardines are still more\r\nhospitable.[2265] People resort to the fête of St. Bernard which lasts\r\na couple of weeks; during this time they dance, and hunt, and act\r\ncomedies, \"the tables being ready at all hours.\" The quarters of the\r\nladies are provided with every requisite for the toilet; they lack\r\nnothing, and it is even said that it was not necessary for any of them\r\nto bring their officer.--I might cite twenty prelates not less gallant,\r\nthe second Cardinal de Rohan, the hero of the necklace, M. de Jarente,\r\nbishop of Orleans, who keeps the record of benefices, the young M. de\r\nGrimaldi, bishop of Le Mans, M. de Breteuil, bishop of Montauban, M.\r\nde Cicé, archbishop of Bordeaux, the Cardinal de Montmorency,\r\ngrand-almoner, M. de Talleyrand, bishop of Autun, M. de Conzié, bishop\r\nof Arras,[2266] and, in the first rank, the Abbé de Saint-Germain des\r\nPrés, Comte de Clermont, prince of the blood, who, with an income\r\nof 370,000 francs succeeds in ruining himself twice, who performs in\r\ncomedies in his town and country residences, who writes to Collé in\r\na pompous style and, who, in his abbatial mansion at Berny, installs\r\nMademoiselle Leduc, a dancer, to do the honors of his table.--There\r\nis no hypocrisy. In the house of M. Trudaine, four bishops attend the\r\nperformance of a piece by Collé entitled \"Les accidents ou les Abbés,\"\r\nthe substance of which, says Collé himself, is so free that he did not\r\ndare print it along with his other pieces. A little later, Beaumarchais,\r\non reading his \"Marriage of Figaro\" at the Maréchal de Richelieu's\r\ndomicile, not expurgated, much more crude and coarse than it is today,\r\nhas bishops and archbishops for his auditors, and these, he says, \"after\r\nbeing infinitely amused by it, did me the honor to assure me that they\r\nwould state that there was not a single word in it offensive to good\r\nmorals\"[2267]: thus was the piece accepted against reasons of State,\r\nagainst the king's will, and through the connivance of all those most\r\ninterested in suppressing it. \"There is something more irrational than\r\nmy piece, and that is its success,\" said its author. The attraction\r\nwas too strong. People devoted to pleasure could not dispense with\r\nthe liveliest comedy of the age. They came to applaud a satire on\r\nthemselves; and better still, they themselves acted in it.--When a\r\nprevalent taste is in fashion, it leads, like a powerful passion, to\r\nextreme extravagance; the offered pleasure must, at any price, be had.\r\nFaced with a momentary pleasure gratification, it is as a child\r\ntempted by fruit; nothing arrests it, neither the danger to which it is\r\ninsensible, nor the social norms as these are established by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Theater, Parade And Extravagance.\r\n\r\n     The principal diversion, elegant comedy.--Parades and\r\n     extravagance.\r\n\r\nTo divert oneself is to turn aside from oneself, to break loose and to\r\nforget oneself; and to forget oneself fully one must be transported into\r\nanother, put himself in the place of another, take his mask and play his\r\npart. Hence the liveliest of diversions is the comedy in which one is\r\nan actor. It is that of children who, as authors, actors and audience,\r\nimprovise and perform small scenes. It is that of a people whose\r\npolitical régime excludes exacting manly tasks (soucis virile) and\r\nwho sport with life just like children. At Venice, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the carnival lasts six months; in France, under another form,\r\nit lasts the entire year. Less familiar and less picturesque, more\r\nrefined and more elegant, it abandons the public square where it lacks\r\nsunshine, to shut itself up in drawing-rooms where chandeliers are the\r\nmost suitable for it. It has retained of the vast popular masquerade\r\nonly a fragment, the opera ball, certainly very splendid and frequented\r\nby princes, princesses and the queen; but this fragment, brilliant as it\r\nis, does not suffice; consequently, in every chateau, in every mansion,\r\nat Paris and in the provinces, it sets up travesties on society and\r\ndomestic comedies.--On welcoming a great personage, on celebrating the\r\nbirthday of the master or mistress of the house, its guests or invited\r\npersons perform in an improvised operetta, in an ingenious, laudatory\r\npastoral, sometimes dressed as gods, as Virtues, as mythological\r\nabstractions, as operatic Turks, Laplanders and Poles, similar to the\r\nfigures then gracing the frontispieces of books, sometimes in the dress\r\nof peasants, pedagogues, peddlers, milkmaids and flower-girls like the\r\nfanciful villagers with which the current taste then fills the stage.\r\nThey sing, they dance, and come forward in turn to recite petty\r\nverses composed for the occasion consisting of so many well-turned\r\ncompliments.[2268]--At Chantilly \"the young and charming Duchesse de\r\nBourbon, attired as a voluptuous Naiad, guides the Comte du Nord, in\r\na gilded gondola, across the grand canal to the island of Love;\" the\r\nPrince de Conti, in his part, serves as pilot to the Grand Duchesse;\r\nother seigniors and ladies \"each in allegorical guise,\" form the\r\nescort,[2269] and on these limpid waters, in this new garden of\r\nAlcinous, the smiling and gallant retinue seems a fairy scene in\r\nTasso.--At Vaudreuil, the ladies, advised that they are to be carried\r\noff to seraglios, attire themselves as vestals, while the high-priest\r\nwelcomes them with pretty couplets into his temple in the park;\r\nmeanwhile over three hundred Turks arrive who force the enclosure to\r\nthe sound of music, and bear away the ladies in palanquins along the\r\nilluminated gardens. At the little Trianon, the park is arranged as a\r\nfair, and the ladies of the court are the saleswomen, \"the queen keeping\r\na café,\" while, here and there, are processions and theatricals; this\r\nfestival costs, it is said, 100,000 livres, and a repetition of it is\r\ndesigned at Choisy attended with a larger outlay.\r\n\r\nAlongside of these masquerades which stop at costume and require only\r\nan hour, there is a more important diversion, the private theatrical\r\nperformance, which completely transforms the man, and which for six\r\nweeks, and even for three months, absorbs him entirely at rehearsals.\r\nTowards 1770,[2270] \"the rage for it is incredible; there is not an\r\nattorney in his cottage who does not wish to have a stage and his\r\ncompany of actors.\" A Bernardine living in Bresse, in the middle of a\r\nwood, writes to Collé that he and his brethren are about to perform \"La\r\nPartie de Chasse de Henri IV,\" and that they are having a small theater\r\nconstructed \"without the knowledge of bigots and small minds.\" Reformers\r\nand moralists introduce theatrical art into the education of children;\r\nMme. de Genlis composes comedies for them, considering these excellent\r\nfor the securing of a good pronunciation, proper self-confidence and the\r\ngraces of deportment. The theater, indeed, then prepares man for\r\nsociety as society prepares him for the theater; in either case he is on\r\ndisplay, composing his attitude and tone of voice, and playing a part;\r\nthe stage and the drawing room are on an equal footing. Towards the end\r\nof the century everybody becomes an actor, everybody having been one\r\nbefore.[2271] \"We hear of nothing but little theaters set up in the\r\ncountry around Paris.\" For a long time those of highest rank set the\r\nexample. Under Louis XV. the Ducs d'Orléans, de Nivernais, d'Ayen, de\r\nCoigny, the Marquises de Courtenvaux, and d'Entraigues, the Comte de\r\nMaillebois, the Duchesse de Brancas, the Comtesse d'Estrades form, with\r\nMadame de Pompadour, the company of the \"small cabinets;\" the Due de la\r\nVallière is the director of them; when the piece contains a ballet the\r\nMarquis de Courtenvaux, the Duc de Beuvron, the Comtes de Melfort and\r\nde Langeron are the titular dancers.[2272] \"Those who are accustomed to\r\nsuch spectacles,\" writes the sedate and pious Duc de Luynes, \"agree in\r\nthe opinion that it would be difficult for professional comedians to\r\nplay better and more intelligently.\" The passion reaches at last still\r\nhigher, even to the royal family. At Trianon, the queen, at first before\r\nforty persons and then before a more numerous audience, performs Colette\r\nin \"Le Devin de Village,\" Gotte, in \"La Gageure imprévue,\" Rosine in\r\n\"Le Barbier de Seville,\" Pierette in \"Le Chasseur et la Laitière,\"[2273]\r\nwhile the other comedians consist of the principal men of the court, the\r\nComte d'Artois, the Comtes d'Adhémar and de Vaudreuil, the Comtesse de\r\nGuiche, and the Canoness de Polignac. A theater is formed in Monsieur's\r\ndomicile; there are two in the Comte d'Artois's house, two in that of\r\nthe Duc d'Orléans, two in the Comte de Clermont's, and one in the Prince\r\nde Condé's. The Comte de Clermont performs serious characters; the Duc\r\nd'Orléans represents, with completeness and naturalness, peasants and\r\nfinanciers; M. de Miromesnil, keeper of the seals, is the smartest and\r\nmost finished of Scapins; M. de Vaudreuil seems to rival Molé; the Comte\r\nde Pons plays the \"Misanthrope\" with rare perfection.[2274] \"More than\r\nten of our ladies of high rank,\" writes the Prince de Ligne, \"play and\r\nsing better than the best of those I have seen in our theaters.\" By\r\ntheir talent judge of their study, assiduity and zeal. It is evident\r\nthat for many of them it is the principal occupation. In a certain\r\nchateau, that of Saint-Aubin, the lady of the house, to secure a large\r\nenough troupe, enrolls her four chambermaids in it, making her little\r\ndaughter, ten years old, play the part of Zaire, and for over twenty\r\nmonths she has no vacation. After her bankruptcy, and in her exile,\r\nthe first thing done by the Princess de Guéménée was to send for\r\nupholsterers to arrange a theater. In short, as nobody went out in\r\nVenice without a mask so here nobody comprehended life without the\r\nmasqueradings, metamorphoses, representations and triumphs of the\r\nplayer.\r\n\r\nThe last trait I have to mention, yet more significant, is the\r\nafterpiece. Really, in this fashionable circle, life is a carnival\r\nas free and almost as rakish as that of Venice. The play commonly\r\nterminates with a parade borrowed from La Fontaine's tales or from the\r\nfarces of the Italian drama, which are not only pointed but more than\r\nfree, and sometimes so broad that they cant be played only before\r\nprinces and courtesans;\"[2275] a morbid palate, indeed, having no taste\r\nfor orgeat, instead demanding a dram. The Duc d'Orléans sings on the\r\nstage the most spicy songs, playing Bartholin in \"Nicaise,\" and Blaise\r\nin \"Joconde.\" \"Le Marriage sans Curé,\" \"Leandre grosse,\" \"L'amant\r\npoussif,\" \"Leandre Etalon,\" are the showy titles of the pieces composed\r\nby Collé \"for the amusement of His Highness and the Court.\" For one\r\nwhich contains salt there are ten stuffed with strong pepper. At Brunoy,\r\nat the residence of Monsieur, so gross are they[2276] the king regrets\r\nhaving attended; \"nobody had any idea of such license; two women in\r\nthe auditorium had to go out, and, what is most extraordinary, they\r\nhad dared to invite the queen.\"--Gaiety is a sort of intoxication which\r\ndraws the cask down to the dregs, and when the wine is gone it draws on\r\nthe lees. Not only at their little suppers, and with courtesans, but in\r\nthe best society and with ladies, they commit the follies of a bagnio.\r\nLet us use the right word, they are blackguards, and the word is no more\r\noffensive to them than the action. \"For five or six months,\" writes a\r\nlady in 1782,\"[2277] \"the suppers are followed by a blind man's buff\r\nor by a draw-dance, and they end in general mischievousness, (une\r\npolissonnerie générale).\" Guests are invited a fortnight in advance. \"On\r\nthis occasion they upset the tables and the furniture; they scattered\r\ntwenty caraffes of water about the room; I finally got away at half-past\r\none, wearied out, pelted with handkerchiefs, and leaving Madame de\r\nClarence hoarse, with her dress torn to shreds, a scratch on her arm,\r\nand a bruise on her forehead, but delighted that she had given such a\r\ngay supper and flattered with the idea of its being the talk the\r\nnext day.\"--This is the result of a craving for amusement. Under its\r\npressure, as under the sculptor's thumb, the face of the century becomes\r\ntransformed and insensibly loses its seriousness; the formal expression\r\nof the courtier at first becomes the cheerful physiognomy of the\r\nworldling, and then, on these smiling lips, their contours changed, we\r\nsee the bold, unbridled grin of the scamp.[2278]\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2201: \"LA VIE DE SALON\" is Taine's title.

DISADVANTAGES OF THIS DRAWING ROOM LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n     Its Barrenness and Artificiality.--Return to Nature and\r\n     sentiment.\r\n\r\nMere pleasure, in the long run, ceases to gratify, and however agreeable\r\nthis drawing room life may be, it ends in a certain hollowness.\r\nSomething is lacking without any one being able to say precisely what\r\nthat something is; the soul becomes restless, and slowly, aided by\r\nauthors and artists, it sets about investigating the cause of its\r\nuneasiness and the object of its secret longings. Barrenness and\r\nartificiality are the two traits of this society, the more marked\r\nbecause it is more complete, and, in this one, pushed to extreme,\r\nbecause it has attained to supreme refinement. In the first\r\nplace naturalness is excluded from it; everything is arranged and\r\nadjusted,--decoration, dress, attitude, tone of voice, words, ideas\r\nand even sentiments. \"A genuine sentiment is so rare,\" said M. de V--,\r\n\"that, when I leave Versailles, I sometimes stand still in the street\r\nto see a dog gnaw a bone.\"[2301] Man, in abandoning himself wholly to\r\nsociety, had withheld no portion of his personality for himself while\r\ndecorum, clinging to him like so much ivy, had abstracted from him the\r\nsubstance of his being and subverted every principle of activity.\r\n\r\n\"There was then,\" says one who was educated in this style,[2302] \"a\r\ncertain way of walking, of sitting down, of saluting, of picking up a\r\nglove, of holding a fork, of tendering any article, in short, a complete\r\nset of gestures and facial expressions, which children had to be taught\r\nat a very early age in order that habit might become a second nature,\r\nand this conventionality formed so important an item in the life of men\r\nand women in aristocratic circles that the actors of the present day,\r\nwith all their study, are scarcely able to give us an idea of it.\"\r\n\r\n Not only was the outward factitious but, again, the inward; there\r\nwas a certain prescribed mode of feeling and of thinking, of living and\r\nof dying. It was impossible to address a man without placing oneself at\r\nhis orders, or a woman without casting oneself at her feet, Fashion, 'le\r\nbon ton,' regulated every important or petty proceeding, the manner\r\nof making a declaration to a woman and of breaking an engagement, of\r\nentering upon and managing a duel, of treating an equal, an inferior and\r\na superior. If any one failed in the slightest degree to conform to this\r\ncode of universal custom, he is called \"a specimen.\" A man of heart\r\nor of talent, D'Argenson, for example, bore a surname of \"simpleton,\"\r\nbecause his originality transcended the conventional standard. \"That has\r\nno name, there is nothing like it!\" embodies the strongest censure.\r\nIn conduct as in literature, whatever departs from a certain type is\r\nrejected. The quantity of authorized actions is as great as the number\r\nof authorized words. The same super-refined taste impoverishes the\r\ninitiatory act as well as the initiatory expression, people acting as\r\nthey write, according to acquired formulas and within a circumscribed\r\ncircle. Under no consideration can the eccentric, the unforeseen, the\r\nspontaneous, vivid inspiration be accepted. Among twenty instances I\r\nselect the least striking since it merely relates to a simple gesture,\r\nand is a measure of other things. Mademoiselle de--obtains, through\r\nfamily influence, a pension for Marcel, a famous dancing-master, and\r\nruns off, delighted, to his domicile to convey him the patent. Marcel\r\nreceives it and at once flings it on the floor: \"Mademoiselle, did I\r\nteach you to offer an object in that manner? Pick up that paper and hand\r\nit to me as you ought to.\" She picks up the patent and presents it to\r\nhim with all suitable grace. \"That's very well, Mademoiselle, I accept\r\nit, although your elbow was not quite sufficiently rounded, and I thank\r\nyou.\"[2303] So many graces end in becoming tiresome; after having eaten\r\nrich food for years, a little milk and dry bread becomes welcome.\r\n\r\nAmong all these social flavorings one is especially abused; one which,\r\nunremittingly employed, communicates to all dishes its frigid and\r\npiquant relish, I mean insincerity (badinage). Society does not tolerate\r\npassion, and in this it exercises its right. One does not enter company\r\nto be either vehement or somber; a strained air or one of concentration\r\nwould appear inconsistent. The mistress of a house is always right\r\nin reminding a man that his emotional constraint brings on silence.\r\n\"Monsieur Such-a-one, you are not amiable to day.\" To be always\r\namiable is, accordingly, an obligation, and, through this training, a\r\nsensibility that is diffused through innumerable little channels never\r\nproduces a broad current. \"One has a hundred friends, and out of these\r\nhundred friends two or three may have some chagrin every day; but one\r\ncould not award them sympathy for any length of time as, in that\r\nevent, one would be wanting in consideration for the remaining\r\nninety-seven;\"[2304] one might sigh for an instant with some one of the\r\nninety-seven, and that would be all. Madame du Deffant, having lost her\r\noldest friend, the President Hénault, that very day goes to sup in a\r\nlarge assemblage: \"Alas,\" she exclaimed, \"he died at six o'clock this\r\nevening; otherwise you would not see me here.\" Under this constant\r\nrégime of distractions and diversions there are no longer any profound\r\nsentiments; we have nothing but an epidermic exterior; love itself is\r\nreduced to \"the exchange of two fantasies.\"--And, as one always falls on\r\nthe side to which one inclines, levity becomes deliberate and a matter\r\nof elegance.[2305] Indifference of the heart is in fashion; one would\r\nbe ashamed to show any genuine emotion. One takes pride in playing with\r\nlove, in treating woman as a mechanical puppet, in touching one inward\r\nspring, and then another, to force out, at will, her anger or her pity.\r\nWhatever she may do, there is no deviation from the most insulting\r\npoliteness; the very exaggeration of false respect which is lavished on\r\nher is a mockery by which indifference for her is fully manifested.--But\r\nthey go still further, and in souls naturally unfeeling, gallantry turns\r\ninto wickedness. Through ennui and the demand for excitement, through\r\nvanity, and as a proof of dexterity, delight is found in tormenting, in\r\nexciting tears, in dishonoring and in killing women by slow torture. At\r\nlast, as vanity is a bottomless pit, there is no species of blackness\r\nof which these polished executioners are not capable; the personages of\r\nLaclos are derived from these originals.[2306]--Monsters of this kind\r\nare, undoubtedly, rare; but there is no need of reverting to them to\r\nascertain how much egotism is harbored in the gallantry of society. The\r\nwomen who erected it into an obligation are the first to realize its\r\ndeceptiveness, and, amidst so much homage without heat, to pine for\r\nthe communicative warmth of a powerful sentiment.--The character of\r\nthe century obtains its last trait and \"the man of feeling comes on the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Return To Nature And Sentiment.\r\n\r\n     Final trait of the century, an increased sensitivity in the\r\n     best circles.--Date of its advent.--Its symptoms in art and\r\n     in literature.--Its dominion in private.--Its affectations.--\r\n     Its sincerity.--Its delicacy.\r\n\r\nIt is not that the groundwork of habits becomes different, for\r\nthese remain equally worldly and dissipated up the last. But fashion\r\nauthorizes a new affectation, consisting of effusions, reveries, and\r\nsensibilities as yet unknown. The point is to return to nature, to\r\nadmire the country, to delight in the simplicity of rustic manners, to\r\nbe interested in village people, to be human, to have a heart, to find\r\npleasure in the sweetness and tenderness of natural affections, to be\r\na husband and a father, and still more, to possess a soul, virtues,\r\nand religious emotions, to believe in Providence and immortality, to\r\nbe capable of enthusiasm. One wants to be all this, or at least show an\r\ninclination that way. In any event, if the desire does exist it is one\r\nthe implied condition, that one shall not be too much disturbed in his\r\nordinary pursuits, and that the sensations belonging to the new order of\r\nlife shall in no respect interfere with the enjoyments of the old one.\r\nAccordingly the exaltation which arises is little more than cerebral\r\nfermentation, and the idyll is to be almost entirely performed in the\r\ndrawing-rooms. Behold, then, literature, the drama, painting and all the\r\narts pursuing the same sentimental road to supply heated imaginations\r\nwith factitious nourishment.[2307] Rousseau, in labored periods,\r\npreaches the charms of an uncivilized existence, while other masters,\r\nbetween two madrigals, fancy the delight of sleeping naked in the\r\nprimeval forest. The lovers in \"La Nouvelle Héloise\" interchange\r\npassages of fine style through four volumes, whereupon a person \"not\r\nmerely methodical but prudent,\" the Comtesse de Blot, exclaims, at a\r\nsocial gathering at the Duchesse de Chartres', \"a woman truly sensitive,\r\nunless of extraordinary virtue, could refuse nothing to the passion\r\nof Rousseau.\"[2308] People collect in a dense crowd in the Exhibition\r\naround \"L'Accordée de Village,\" \"La Cruche Cassée,\" and the \"Retour\r\nde nourrice,\" with other rural and domestic idylls by Greuze; the\r\nvoluptuous element, the tempting undercurrent of sensuality made\r\nperceptible in the fragile simplicity of his artless maidens, is a\r\ndainty bit for the libertine tastes which are kept alive beneath\r\nmoral aspirations.[2309] After these, Ducis, Thomas, Parny, Colardeau,\r\nBoucher, Delille, Bernardin de St. Pierre, Marmontel, Florian, the mass\r\nof orators, authors and politicians, the misanthrope Champfort, the\r\nlogician La Harpe, the minister Necker, the versifiers and the imitators\r\nof Gessner and Young, the Berquins, the Bitaubés, nicely combed and\r\nbedizened, holding embroidered handkerchiefs to wipe away tears, are to\r\nmarshal forth the universal eclogue down to the acme of the Revolution.\r\nMarmontel's \"Moral Tales\" appear in the columns of the \"Mercure\"\r\nfor 1791 and 1792,[2310] while the number following the massacres of\r\nSeptember opens with verses \"to the manes of my canary-bird.\"\r\n\r\nConsequently, in all the details of private life, sensibility displays\r\nits magniloquence. A small temple to Friendship is erected in a park. A\r\nlittle altar to Benevolence is set up in a private closet. Dresses à\r\nla Jean-Jacques-Rousseau are worn \"analogous to the principles of that\r\nauthor.\" Head-dresses are selected with \"puffs au sentiment\" in which\r\none may place the portrait of one's daughter, mother, canary or dog,\r\nthe whole \"garnished with the hair of one's father or intimate\r\nfriend.\"[2311] People keep intimate friends for whom \"they experience\r\nsomething so warm and so tender that it nearly amounts to a passion\" and\r\nwhom they cannot go three hours a day without seeing. \"Every time female\r\ncompanions interchange tender ideas the voice suddenly changes into\r\na pure and languishing tone, each fondly regarding the other with\r\napproaching heads and frequently embracing,\" and suppressing a yawn a\r\nquarter of an hour after, with a nap in concert, because they have no\r\nmore to say. Enthusiasm becomes an obligation. On the revival of \"Le\r\npère de famille\" there are as many handkerchiefs counted as spectators,\r\nand ladies faint away. \"It is customary, especially for young women,\r\nto be excited, to turn pale, to melt into tears and, generally, to be\r\nseriously affected on encountering M. de Voltaire; they rush into his\r\narms, stammer and weep, their agitation resembling that of the most\r\npassionate love.\"[2312]--When a society-author reads his work in\r\na drawing-room, fashion requires that the company should utter\r\nexclamations and sob, and that some pretty fainting subject should be\r\nunlaced. Mme. de Genlis, who laughs at these affectations, is no less\r\naffected than the rest. Suddenly some one in the company is heard to say\r\nto the young orphan whom she is exhibiting: \"Pamela, show us Héloise,\"\r\nwhereupon Pamela, loosening her hair, falls on her knees and turns her\r\neyes up to heaven with an air of inspiration, to the great applause of\r\nthe assembly.[2313] Sensibility becomes an institution. The same Madame\r\nde Genlis founds an order of Perseverance which soon includes \"as many\r\nas ninety chevaliers in the very best society.\" To become a member it is\r\nnecessary to solve some riddle, to answer a moral question and pronounce\r\na discourse on virtue. Every lady or chevalier who discovers and\r\npublishes \"three well-verified virtuous actions\" obtains a gold medal.\r\nEach chevalier has his \"brother in arms,\" each lady has her bosom\r\nfriend and each member has a device, and each device, framed in a little\r\npicture, figures in the \"Temple of Honor,\" a sort of tent gallantly\r\ndecorated, and which M. de Lauzun causes to be erected in the middle\r\nof a garden.[2314]--The sentimental parade is complete, a drawing room\r\nmasquerade being visible even in this revival of chivalry.\r\n\r\nThe froth of enthusiasm and of fine words nevertheless leaves in\r\nthe heart a residuum of active benevolence, trustfulness, and even\r\nhappiness, or, at least, expansiveness and freedom. Wives, for the first\r\ntime, are seen accompanying their husbands into garrison; mothers desire\r\nto nurse their infants, and fathers begin to interest themselves in\r\nthe education of their children. Simplicity again forms an element of\r\nmanners. Hair-powder is no longer put on little boys' heads; many of the\r\nseigniors abandon laces, embroideries, red heels and the sword, except\r\nwhen in full dress. People appear in the streets \"dressed à la Franklin,\r\nin coarse cloth, with a knotty cane and thick shoes.\"[2315] The taste no\r\nlonger runs on cascades, statues and stiff and pompous decorations; the\r\npreference is for the English garden.[2316] The queen arranges a village for\r\nherself at the Trianon, where, \"dressed in a frock of white cambric\r\nmuslin and a gauze neck-handkerchief, and with a straw hat,\" she fishes\r\nin the lake and sees her cows milked. Etiquette falls away like the\r\npaint scaling off from the skin, disclosing the bright hue of natural\r\nemotions. Madame Adelaide takes up a violin and replaces an absent\r\nmusician to let the peasant girls dance. The Duchesse de Bourbon goes\r\nout early in the morning incognito to bestow alms, and \"to see the poor\r\nin their garrets.\" The Dauphine jumps out of her carriage to assist a\r\nwounded post-boy, a peasant knocked down by a stag. The king and the\r\nComte d'Artois help a carter to extract his cart from the mud. People no\r\nlonger think about self-constraint, and self-adjustment, and of\r\nkeeping up their dignity under all circumstances, and of subjecting the\r\nweaknesses of human nature to the exigencies of rank. On the death of\r\nthe first Dauphin,[2317] whilst the people in the room place themselves\r\nbefore the king to prevent him from entering it, the queen falls at\r\nhis knees, and he says to her, weeping, \"Ah, my wife, our dear child is\r\ndead, since they do not wish me to see him.\" And the narrator adds with\r\nadmiration; \"I always seem to see a good farmer and his excellent wife\r\na prey to the deepest despair at the loss of their beloved child.\" Tears\r\nare no longer concealed, as it is a point of honor to be a human being.\r\nOne becomes human and familiar with one's inferiors. A prince, on a\r\nreview, says to the soldiers on presenting the princess to them, \"My\r\nboys, here is my wife.\" There is a disposition to make people happy and\r\nto take great delight in their gratitude. To be kind, to be loved is the\r\nobject of the head of a government, of a man in place. This goes so\r\nfar that God is prefigured according to this model. The \"harmonies of\r\nnature\" are construed into the delicate attentions of Providence; on\r\ninstituting filial affection the Creator \"deigned to choose for our best\r\nvirtue our sweetest pleasure.\"[2318]--The idyll which is imagined to\r\ntake place in heaven corresponds with the idyll practiced on earth. From\r\nthe public up to the princes, and from the princes down to the public,\r\nin prose, in verse, in compliments at festivities, in official replies,\r\nin the style of royal edicts down to the songs of the market-women,\r\nthere is a constant interchange of graces and of sympathies. Applause\r\nbursts out in the theater at any verse containing an allusion to\r\nprinces, and, a moment after, at the speech which exalts the merits of\r\nthe people, the princes return the compliment by applauding in their\r\nturn.[2319]--On all sides, just as this society is vanishing, a mutual\r\ndeference, a spirit of kindliness arises, like a soft and balmy autumnal\r\nbreeze, to dissipate whatever harshness remains of its aridity and to\r\nmingle with the radiance of its last hours the perfume of dying roses.\r\nWe now encounter acts and words of infinite grace, unique of their kind,\r\nlike a lovely, exquisite little figure on old Sèvres porcelain. One day,\r\non the Comtesse Amélie de Boufflers speaking somewhat flippantly of her\r\nhusband, her mother-in-law interposes, \"You forget that you are speaking\r\nof my son.\"--\"True, mamma, I thought I was only speaking of your\r\nson-in-law.\" It is she again who, on playing \"the boat,\" and obliged to\r\ndecide between this beloved mother-in-law and her own mother, whom\r\nshe scarcely knew, replies, \"I would save my mother and drown with my\r\nmother-in-law.\"[2320] The Duchesse de Choiseul, the Duchesse de Lauzun,\r\nand others besides, are equally charming miniatures. When the heart and\r\nthe mind combine their considerations they produce masterpieces, and\r\nthese, like the art, the refinements and the society which surrounds\r\nthem, possess a charm unsurpassed by anything except their own\r\nfragility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Personality Defects.\r\n\r\n     The failings of character thus formed.--Adapted to one\r\n     situation but not to a contrary situation.--Defects of\r\n     intelligence.--Defects of disposition.--Such a character is\r\n     disarmed by good-breeding.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that, the better people have become adapted to a certain\r\nsituation the less prepared are they for the opposite situation. The\r\nhabits and faculties that serve them in the previous condition become\r\nprejudicial to them in the new one. In acquiring talents adapted to\r\ntranquil times they lose those suited to times of agitation, reaching\r\nthe extreme of feebleness at the same time with the extreme of urbanity.\r\nThe more polished an aristocracy becomes the weaker it becomes, and when\r\nno longer possessing the power to please it not longer possesses the\r\nstrength to struggle. And yet, in this world, we must struggle if we\r\nwould live. In humanity, as in nature, empire belongs to force. Every\r\ncreature that loses the art and energy of self-defense becomes so much\r\nmore certainly a prey according as its brilliancy, imprudence and even\r\ngentleness deliver it over in advance to the gross appetites roaming\r\naround it. Where find resistance in characters formed by the habits we\r\nhave just described? To defend ourselves we must, first of all, look\r\ncarefully around us, see and foresee, and provide for danger. How could\r\nthey do this living as they did? Their circle is too narrow and too\r\ncarefully enclosed. Confined to their castles and mansions they see only\r\nthose of their own sphere, they hear only the echo of their own ideas,\r\nthey imagine that there is nothing beyond the public seems to consist of\r\ntwo hundred persons. Moreover, disagreeable truths are not admitted into\r\na drawing-room, especially when of personal import, an idle fancy there\r\nbecoming a dogma because it becomes conventional. Here, accordingly, we\r\nfind those who, already deceived by the limitations of their accustomed\r\nhorizon, fortify their delusion still more by delusions about their\r\nfellow men. They comprehend nothing of the vast world, which envelops\r\ntheir little world; they are incapable of entering into the sentiments\r\nof a bourgeois, of a villager; they have no conception of the peasant as\r\nhe is but as they would like him to be. The idyll is in fashion, and no\r\none dares dispute it; any other supposition would be false because it\r\nwould be disagreeable, and as the drawing rooms have decided that all\r\nwill go well, all must go well. Never was a delusion more complete and\r\nmore voluntary. The Duc d'Orléans offers to wager a hundred louis that\r\nthe States-General will dissolve without accomplishing anything, not\r\neven abolishing the lettre-de-cachet.. After the demolition has begun,\r\nand yet again after it is finished, they will form opinions no more\r\naccurate. They have no idea of social architecture; they know nothing\r\nabout its materials, its proportions, or its harmonious balance; they\r\nhave had no hand in it, they have never worked at it. They are entirely\r\nignorant of the old building[2321] in which they occupy the first\r\nstory. They are not qualified to calculate either its pressure or its\r\nresistance.[2322] They conclude, finally, that it is better to let\r\nthe thing tumble in, and that the restoration of the edifice in their\r\nbehalf will follow its own course, and that they will return to their\r\ndrawing-room, expressly rebuilt for them, and freshly gilded, to begin\r\nover again the pleasant conversation which an accident, some tumult in\r\nthe street, had interrupted.[2323] Clear-sighted in society, they are\r\nobtuse in politics. They examine everything by the artificial light of\r\ncandles; they are disturbed and bewildered in the powerful light of open\r\nday. The eyelid has grown stiff through age. The organ so long bent on\r\nthe petty details of one refined life no longer takes in the popular\r\nlife of the masses, and, in the new sphere into which it is suddenly\r\nplunged, its refinement becomes the source of its blindness.\r\n\r\nNevertheless action is necessary, for danger is seizing them by the\r\nthroat. But the danger is of an ignoble species, while their education\r\nhas provided them with no arms suitable for warding it off. They have\r\nlearned how to fence, but not how to box. They are still the sons of\r\nthose at Fontenoy, who, instead of being the first to fire, courteously\r\nraised their hats and addressed their English antagonists, \"No,\r\ngentlemen, fire yourselves.\" Being the slaves of good-breeding they\r\nare not free in their movements. Numerous acts, and those the most\r\nimportant, those of a sudden, vigorous and rude stamp, are opposed to\r\nthe respect a well-bred man entertains for others, or at least to the\r\nrespect which he owes to himself. They do not consider these allowable\r\namong themselves; they do not dream of their being allowed, and, the\r\nhigher their position the more their rank fetters them. When the royal\r\nfamily sets out for Varennes the accumulated delays by which they are\r\nlost are the result of etiquette. Madame de Touzel insists on her place\r\nin the carriage to which she is entitled as governess of the Children of\r\nFrance. The king, on arriving, is desirous of conferring the marshal's\r\nbaton on M. de Bouillé, and after running to and fro to obtain a baton\r\nhe is obliged to borrow that of the Duc de Choiseul. The queen cannot\r\ndispense with a traveling dressing-case and one has to be made large\r\nenough to contain every imaginable implement from a warming-pan to a\r\nsilver porridge-dish, with other dishes besides; and, as if there were\r\nno shifts to be had in Brussels, there had to be a complete outfit in\r\nthis line for herself and her children.[2324]--A fervent devotion,\r\neven humanness, the frivolity of the small literary spirit, graceful\r\nurbanity, profound ignorance,[2325] the lack or rigidity of the\r\ncomprehension and determination are still greater with the princes\r\nthan with the nobles.--All are impotent against the wild and roaring\r\noutbreak. They have not the physical superiority that can master it, the\r\nvulgar charlatanism which can charm it away, the tricks of a Scapin to\r\nthrow it off the scent, the bull's neck, the mountebank's gestures, the\r\nstentor's lungs, in short, the resources of the energetic temperament\r\nand of animal cunning, alone capable of diverting the rage of the\r\nunchained brute. To find such fighters, they seek three or four men of\r\na different race and education, men having suffered and roamed about,\r\na brutal commoner like the abbé Maury, a colossal and dirty satyr like\r\nMirabeau, a bold and prompt adventurer like that Dumouriez who, at\r\nCherbourg, when, through the feebleness of the Duc de Beuvron, the\r\nstores of grain were given up and the riot began, hooted at and nearly\r\ncut to pieces, suddenly sees the keys of the storehouse in the hands of\r\na Dutch sailor, and, yelling to the mob that it was betrayed through\r\na foreigner having got hold of the keys, himself jumps down from the\r\nrailing, seizes the keys and hands them to the officer of the guard,\r\nsaying to the people, \"I am your father, I am the man to be responsible\r\nfor the storehouse!\"[2326] To entrust oneself with porters and brawlers,\r\nto be collared by a political club, to improvise on the highways, to\r\nbark louder than the barkers, to fight with the fists or a cudgel, as\r\nmuch later with the young and rich gangs, against brutes and lunatics\r\nincapable of employing other arguments, and who must be answered in\r\nthe same vein, to mount guard over the Assembly, to act as volunteer\r\nconstable, to spare neither one's own hide nor that of others, to be\r\none of the people to face the people, all these are simple and effectual\r\nproceedings, but so vulgar as to appear to them disgusting. The idea of\r\nresorting to such means never enters their head; they neither know how,\r\nnor do they care to make use of their hands in such business.[2327] They\r\nare skilled only in the duel and, almost immediately, the brutality of\r\nopinion, by means of assaults, stops the way to polite combats. Their\r\narms, the shafts of the drawing-room, epigrams, witticisms, songs,\r\nparodies, and other needle thrusts are impotent against the popular\r\nbull.[2328] Their personality lacks both roots and resources; through\r\nsuper-refinement it has weakened; their nature, impoverished by\r\nculture, is incapable of the transformations by which we are renewed\r\nand survive.--An all-powerful education has repressed, mollified, and\r\nenfeebled their very instincts. About to die, they experience none of\r\nthe reactions of blood and rage, the universal and sudden restoration of\r\nthe forces, the murderous spasm, the blind irresistible need of striking\r\nthose who strike them. If a gentleman is arrested in his own house by\r\na Jacobin we never find him splitting his head open.[2329] They allow\r\nthemselves to be taken, going quietly to prison; to make an uproar would\r\nbe bad taste; it is necessary, above all things, to remain what they\r\nare, well-bred people of society. In prison both men and women dress\r\nthemselves with great care, pay each other visits and keep up a\r\ndrawing-room; it may be at the end of a corridor, by the light of three\r\nor four candles; but here they circulate jests, compose madrigals, sing\r\nsongs and pride themselves on being as gallant, as gay and as gracious\r\nas ever: need people be morose and ill-behaved because accident has\r\nconsigned them to a poor inn? They preserve their dignity and their\r\nsmile before their judges and on the cart; the women, especially, mount\r\nthe scaffold with the ease and serenity characteristic of an evening\r\nentertainment. It is the supreme characteristic of good-breeding,\r\nerected into an unique duty, and become to this aristocracy a second\r\nnature, which is found in its virtues as well as in its vices, in its\r\nfaculties as well as in its impotencies, in its prosperity as at its\r\nfall, and which adorns it even in the death to which it conducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2301: Champfort, 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2302: George Sand, V. 59. \"I was rebuked for everything; I\r\nnever made a movement which was not criticized.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2303: \"Paris, Versailles, et les provinces,\" I. 162.--\"The\r\nking of Sweden is here; he wears rosettes on his breeches; all is\r\nover; he is ridiculous, and a provincial king.\" (\"Le Gouvernement de\r\nNormandie,\" by Hippeau, IV. 237, July 4, 1784.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2304: Stendhal, \"Rome, Naples and Florence,\" 379.

THE SPIRIT AND THE DOCTRINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. SCIENTIFIC ACQUISITION.\r\n\r\n     The composition of the revolutionary spirit.--Scientific\r\n     acquisition its first element.\r\n\r\nOn seeing a man with a somewhat feeble constitution, but healthy in\r\nappearance and of steady habits, greedily swallow some new kind of\r\ncordial and then suddenly fall to the ground, foam at the mouth, act\r\ndeliriously and writhe in convulsions, we at once surmise that this\r\nagreeable beverage contained some dangerous substance; but a delicate\r\nanalysis is necessary to detect and decompose the poison. The philosophy\r\nof the eighteenth century contained poison, and of a kind as potent as\r\nit was peculiar; for, not only is it a long historic elaboration,\r\nthe final and condensed essence of the tendency of the thought of the\r\ncentury, but again its two principal ingredients have this peculiarity,\r\nthat, separate, they are salutary, and in combination they form a\r\nvenomous compound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Scientific Progress.\r\n\r\n     The accumulation and progress of discoveries in science and\r\n     in nature.--They serve as a starting-point for the new\r\n     philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe first is scientific discovery, admirable on all sides, and\r\nbeneficent in its nature; it is made up of masses of facts slowly\r\naccumulated and then summarily presented, or in rapid succession. For\r\nthe first time in history the sciences expand and affirm each other to\r\nthe extent of providing, not, as formerly, under Galileo and Descartes,\r\nconstructive fragments, or provisional scaffolding, but a definite and\r\ndemonstrated system of the universe, that of Newton.[3101] Around this\r\ncapital fact, almost all the discoveries of the century, either as\r\ncomplementary or as prolongations, range themselves. In pure mathematics\r\nwe have the Infinitesimal Calculus discovered simultaneously by Leibnitz\r\nand Newton, mechanics reduced by d'Alembert to a single theorem, and\r\nthat superb collection of theories which, elaborated by the Bernouillis,\r\nEuler, Clairaut, d'Alembert, Taylor and Maclaurin, is finally completed\r\nat the end of the century by Monge, Lagrange, and Laplace.[3102] In\r\nastronomy, the series of calculations and observations which, from\r\nNewton to Laplace, transforms science into a problem of mechanics,\r\nexplains and predicts the movements of the planets and of their\r\nsatellites, indicating the origin and formation of our solar system,\r\nand, extending beyond this, through the discoveries of Herschel,\r\naffording an insight into the distribution of the stellar archipelagos,\r\nand of the grand outlines of celestial architecture. In physics, the\r\ndecomposition of light and the principles of optics discovered by\r\nNewton, the velocity of sound, the form of its undulations, and\r\nfrom Sauveur to Chladni, from Newton to Bernouilli and Lagrange, the\r\nexperimental laws and leading theorems of Acoustics, the primary laws of\r\nthe radiation of heat by Newton, Kraft and Lambert, the theory of latent\r\nheat by Black, the proportions of caloric by Lavoisier and Laplace, the\r\nfirst true conceptions of the source of fire and heat, the experiments,\r\nlaws, and means by which Dufay, Nollet, Franklin, and especially Coulomb\r\nexplain, manipulate and, for the first time, utilize electricity.--In\r\nChemistry, all the foundations of the science: isolated oxygen, nitrogen\r\nand hydrogen, the composition of water, the theory of combustion,\r\nchemical nomenclature, quantitative analysis, the indestructibility of\r\nmatter, in short, the discoveries of Scheele, Priestley, Cavendish\r\nand Stahl, crowned with the clear and concise theory of Lavoisier.--In\r\nMineralogy, the goniometer, the constancy of angles and the primary laws\r\nof derivation by Romé de Lisle, and next the discovery of types and\r\nthe mathematical deduction of secondary forms by Haüy.--In Geology,\r\nthe verification and results of Newton's theory, the exact form of the\r\nearth, the depression of the poles, the expansion of the equator,[3103]\r\nthe cause and the law of the tides, the primitive fluidity of the\r\nplanet, the constancy of its internal heat, and then, with Buffon,\r\nDesmarets, Hutton and Werner, the aqueous or igneous origin of rocks,\r\nthe stratifications of the earth, the structure of beds of fossils,\r\nthe prolonged and repeated submersion of continents, the slow growth\r\nof animal and vegetable deposits, the vast antiquity of life, the\r\nstripping, fracturing and gradual transformation of the terrestrial\r\nsurface,[3104] and, finally the grand picture in which Buffon describes\r\nin approximate manner the entire history of our globe, from the moment\r\nit formed a mass of glowing lava down to the time when our species,\r\nafter so many lost or surviving species, was able to inhabit it.--Upon\r\nthis science of inorganic matter we see arising at the same time the\r\nscience of organic matter. Grew, and then Vaillant had just demonstrated\r\nthe sexual system and described the fecundating of plants; Linnaeus\r\ninvents botanical nomenclature and the first complete classifications;\r\nthe Jussieus discover the subordination of characteristics and natural\r\nclassification. Digestion is explained by Réaumur and Spallanzani,\r\nrespiration by Lavoisier; Prochaska verifies the mechanism of reflex\r\nactions; Haller and Spallanzani experiment on and describe the\r\nconditions and phases of generation. Scientists penetrate to the lowest\r\nstages of animal life. Réaumur publishes his admirable observations\r\non insects and Lyonnet devotes twenty years to portraying the\r\nwillow-caterpillar; Spallanzani resuscitates his rotifers, Tremblay\r\ndissects his fresh-water polyps, and Needham reveals his infusoria.\r\nThe experimental conception of life is deduced from these various\r\nresearches. Buffon already, and especially Lamarck, in their great and\r\nincomplete sketches, outline with penetrating divination the leading\r\nfeatures of modern physiology and zoology. Organic molecules everywhere\r\ndiffused or everywhere growing, species of globules constantly in course\r\nof decay and restoration, which, through the blind and spontaneous\r\ndevelopment, transform themselves, multiply and combine, and which,\r\nwithout either foreign direction or any preconceived end, solely through\r\nthe effect of their structure and surroundings, unite together to\r\nform those masterly organisms which we call plants and animals: in the\r\nbeginning, the simplest forms, and next a slow, gradual, complex and\r\nperfected organization; the organ created through habits, necessity and\r\nsurrounding medium; heredity transmitting acquired modifications,[3105]\r\nall denoting in advance, in a state of conjecture and approximation,\r\nthe cellular theory of later physiologists[3106] and the conclusions of\r\nDarwin. In the picture which the human mind draws of nature, the\r\ngeneral outline is marked by the science of the eighteenth century, the\r\narrangement of its plan and of the principal masses being so correctly\r\nmarked, that to day the leading lines remain intact. With the exception\r\nof a few partial corrections we have nothing to efface.\r\n\r\nThis vast supply of positive or probable facts, either demonstrated or\r\nanticipated, furnishes food, substance and impulse to the intellect\r\nof the eighteenth century. Consider the leaders of public opinion,\r\nthe promoters of the new philosophy: they are all, in various degrees,\r\nversed in the physical and natural sciences. Not only are they familiar\r\nwith theories and authorities, but again they have a personal knowledge\r\nof facts and things. Voltaire[3108] is among the first to explain\r\nthe optical and astronomical theories of Newton, and again to make\r\ncalculations, observations and experiments of his own. He writes memoirs\r\nfor the Academy of Sciences \"On the Measure of Motive Forces,\" and \"On\r\nthe Nature and Diffusion of Heat.\" He handles Réamur's thermometer,\r\nNewton's prism, and Muschenbrock's pyrometer. In his laboratory at Cirey\r\nhe has all the known apparatus for physics and chemistry. He experiments\r\nwith his own hand on the reflection of light in space, on the increase\r\nof weight in calcified metals, on the renewal of amputated parts of\r\nanimals, and in the spirit of a true savant, persistently, with constant\r\nrepetitions, even to the beheading of forty snails and slugs, to verify\r\nan assertion made by Spallanzani.--The same curiosity and the same\r\npreparation prevails with all imbued with the same spirit. In the\r\nother camp, among the Cartesians, about to disappear, Fontenelle is an\r\nexcellent mathematician, the competent biographer of all eminent men of\r\nscience, the official secretary and true representative of the Academy\r\nof Sciences. In other places, in the Academy of Bordeaux, Montesquieu\r\nreads discourses on the mechanism of the echo, and on the use of the\r\nrenal glands; he dissects frogs, tests the effect of heat and cold\r\non animated tissues, and publishes observations on plants and\r\ninsects.--Rousseau, the least instructed of all, attends the lectures\r\nof the chemist Rouelle, botanizing and appropriating to himself all the\r\nelements of human knowledge with which to write his \"Emile.\"--Diderot\r\ntaught mathematics and devoured every science and art even to the\r\ntechnical processes of all industries. D'Alembert stands in the first\r\nrank of mathematicians. Buffon translated Newton's theory of flux, and\r\nthe Vegetable Statics of Hales; he is in turn a metallurgist, optician,\r\ngeographer, geologist and, last of all, an anatomist. Condillac, to\r\nexplain the use of signs and the relation of ideas, writes abridgments\r\nof arithmetic, algebra, mechanics and astronomy.[3109] Maupertuis,\r\nCondorcet and Lalande are mathematicians, physicists and astronomers;\r\nd'Holbach, Lamettrie and Cabanis are chemists, naturalists physiologists\r\nand physicians.--Prophets of a superior or inferior kind, masters or\r\npupils, specialists or simple amateurs, all draw directly or indirectly\r\nfrom the living source that has just burst forth. This is their basis\r\nwhen they begin to teach about Man, what he is, from whence he came,\r\nwhere he is going, what he may become and what he should be. A new point\r\nof departure leads to new points of view; so that the idea, which was\r\nthen entertained of the human being will become completely transformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Science Detached From Theology.\r\n\r\n     Change of the point of view in the science of man.--It is\r\n     detached from theology and is united with the natural\r\n     sciences.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a mind thoroughly imbued with these new truths, to be\r\nplaced on the orbit of Saturn, and let him observe[3110]. Amidst this\r\nvast and overwhelming space and in these boundless solar archipelagoes,\r\nhow small is our own sphere, and the earth, what a grain of sand! What\r\nmultitudes of worlds beyond our own, and, if life exists in them, what\r\ncombinations are possible other than those of which we are the result!\r\nWhat is life, what is organic substance in the monstrous universe but an\r\nindifferent mass, a passing accident, the corruption of a few epidermic\r\nparticles? And if this be life, what is that humanity which is so small\r\na fragment of it?--Such is Man in nature, an atom, and an ephemeral\r\nparticle; let this not be lost sight of in our theories concerning his\r\norigin, his importance, and his destiny.\r\n\r\n\"A mite that would consider itself as the center of all things would\r\nbe grotesque, and therefore it is essential that an insect\r\nalmost infinitely small should not show conceit almost infinitely\r\ngreat.\"[3111]--\r\n\r\nHow slow has been the evolution of the globe itself! What myriads\r\nof ages between the first cooling of its mass and the beginnings of\r\nlife![3112] Of what consequence is the turmoil of our ant-hill compared\r\nto the geological tragedy in which we have born no part, the strife\r\nbetween fire and water, the thickening of the earth's crust, formation\r\nof the universal sea, the construction and separation of continents!\r\nPrevious to our historical record what a long history of vegetable and\r\nanimal existence! What a succession of flora and fauna! What generations\r\nof marine organisms in forming the strata of sediment! What generations\r\nof plans in forming the deposits of coal! What transformations of\r\nclimate to drive the pachydermata away from the pole!--And now comes\r\nMan, the latest of all, he is like the uppermost bud on the top of a\r\ntall ancient tree, flourishing there for a while, but, like the tree,\r\ndestined to perish after a few seasons, when the increasing and foretold\r\ncongelation allowing the tree to live shall force the tree to die. He is\r\nnot alone on the branch; beneath him, around him, on a level with him,\r\nother buds shoot forth, born of the same sap; but he must not forget, if\r\nhe would comprehend his own being, that, along with himself, other lives\r\nexist in his vicinity, graduated up to him and issuing from the same\r\ntrunk. If he is unique he is not isolated, being an animal among other\r\nanimals;[3113] in him and with them, substance, organization and birth,\r\nthe formation and renewal of the functions, senses and appetites,\r\nare similar, while his superior intelligence, like their rudimentary\r\nintelligence, has for an indispensable organ a nervous matter whose\r\nstructure is the same with him as with them.--Thus surrounded, brought\r\nforth and borne along by nature, is it to be supposed that in nature he\r\nis an empire within an empire? He is there as the part of a whole, by\r\nvirtue of being a physical body, a chemical composition, an animated\r\norganism, a sociable animal, among other bodies, other compositions,\r\nother social animals, all analogous to him; and by virtue of these\r\nclassifications, he is, like them, subject to laws.--For, if the first\r\ncause is unknown to us, and we dispute among ourselves to know what it\r\nis, whether innate or external, we affirm with certainty the mode of its\r\naction, and that it operates only according to fixed and general\r\nlaws. Every circumstance, whatever it may be, is conditioned, and, its\r\nconditions being given, it never fails to conform to them. Of two links\r\nforming a chain, the first always draws on the second. There are laws:\r\n\r\n* for numbers, forms, and motions,\r\n\r\n* for the revolution of the planets and the fall of bodies,\r\n\r\n* for the diffusion of light and the radiation of heat,\r\n\r\n* for the attractions and repulsion of electricity,\r\n\r\n* for chemical combinations, and\r\n\r\n* for the birth, equilibrium and dissolution of organic bodies.\r\n\r\nThey exist for the birth, maintenance, and development of human\r\nsocieties, for the formation, conflict, and direction of ideas, passions\r\nand determinations of human individuals.[3114] In all this, Man is bound\r\nup with nature; hence, if we would comprehend him, we must observe him\r\nin her, after her, and like her, with the same independence, the same\r\nprecautions, and in the same spirit. Through this remark alone the\r\nmethod of the moral sciences is fixed. In history, in psychology, in\r\nmorals, in politics, the thinkers of the preceding century, Pascal,\r\nBossuet, Descartes, Fenelon, Malebrance, and La Bruyère, all based their\r\nthoughts on dogma; It is plain to every one qualified to read them that\r\ntheir base is predetermined. Religion provided them with a complete\r\ntheory of the moral order of things; according to this theory, latent or\r\nexposed, they described Man and accommodated their observations to the\r\npreconceived model. The writers of the eighteenth century rejected\r\nthis method: they dwell on Man, on the observable Man, and on his\r\nsurroundings; in their eyes, conclusions about the soul, its origin, and\r\nits destiny, must come afterwards and depend wholly, not on that which\r\nthe Revelation provided, but on that which observation does and will\r\nprovide. The moral sciences are now divorced from theology and attach\r\nthemselves, as if a prolongation of them, to the physical sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Transformation Of History.\r\n\r\n     Voltaire.--Criticism and conceptions of unity.--\r\n     Montesquieu.--An outline of social laws.\r\n\r\nThrough the separation from theology and the attachment to natural\r\nscience the humanities become science. In history, every foundation on\r\nwhich we now build, is laid. Compare Bossuet's \"Discours sur l'histoire\r\nuniverselle,\" with Voltaire's \"Essai sur les moeurs,\" and we at once see\r\nhow new and profound these foundations were.--The critics of religious\r\ndogma here establish their fundamental principle: in view of the fact\r\nthat the laws of nature are universal and permanent it follows that,\r\nin the moral world, as in the physical world, there can be no exception\r\nfrom them, and that no arbitrary or foreign force intervenes to disturb\r\nthe regular scientific procedures, which will provide a sure means of\r\ndiscerning myth from truth.[3115] Biblical exegesis is born out of this\r\nmaxim, and not alone that of Voltaire, but also the critical explanatory\r\nmethods of the future. [3116] Meanwhile they skeptically examine the\r\nannals of all people, carelessly cutting away and suppressing; too\r\nhastily, extravagantly, especially where the ancients are concerned,\r\nbecause their historical expedition is simply a scouting trip; but\r\nnevertheless with such an overall insight that we may still approve\r\nalmost all the outlines of their summary chart. The (newly discovered)\r\nprimitive Man was not a superior being, enlightened from above, but\r\na coarse savage, naked and miserable, slow of growth, sluggish in\r\nprogress, the most destitute and most needy of all animals, and, on this\r\naccount, sociable, endowed like the bee and the beaver with an instinct\r\nfor living in groups, and moreover an imitator like the monkey, but\r\nmore intelligent, capable of passing by degrees from the language of\r\ngesticulation to that of articulation, beginning with a monosyllabic\r\nidiom which gradually increases in richness, precision and\r\nsubtlety.[3117] How many centuries are requisite to attain to this\r\nprimitive language! How many centuries more to the discovery of the most\r\nnecessary arts, the use of fire, the fabrication of \"hatches of silex\r\nand jade\", the melting and refining of metals, the domestication of\r\nanimals, the production and modification of edible plants, the formation\r\nof early civilized and durable communities, the discovery of writing,\r\nfigures and astronomical periods.[3118] Only after a dawn of vast and\r\ninfinite length do we see in Chaldea and in China the commencement of\r\nan accurate chronological history. There are five or six of these great\r\nindependent centers of spontaneous civilization, China, Babylon, ancient\r\nPersia, India, Egypt, Phoenicia, and the two American empires. On\r\ncollecting these fragments together, on reading such of their books as\r\nhave been preserved, and which travelers bring to us, the five Kings of\r\nthe Chinese, the Vedas of the Hindus, the Zoroastrians of the\r\nancient Persians, we find that all contain religions, moral theories,\r\nphilosophies and institutions, as worthy of study as our own. Three of\r\nthese codes, those of India, China and the Muslims, still at the present\r\ntime govern countries as vast as our Europe, and nations of equal\r\nimportance. We must not, like Bossuet, \"overlook the universe in a\r\nuniversal history,\" and subordinate humanity to a small population\r\nconfined to a desolate region around the Dead Sea.[3119] Human history\r\nis a thing of natural growth like the rest; its direction is due to its\r\nown elements; no external force guides it, but the inward forces that\r\ncreate it; it is not tending to any prescribed end but developing a\r\nresult. And the chief result is the progress of the human mind. \"Amidst\r\nso many ravages and so much destruction, we see a love of order secretly\r\nanimating the human species, and forestalling its utter ruin. It is one\r\nof the springs of nature ever recovering its energy; it is the source\r\nof the formation of the codes of nations; it causes the law and the\r\nministers of the law to be respected in Tinquin and in the islands\r\nof Formosa as well as in Rome.\" Man thus possesses, said Voltaire,\r\na \"principle of Reason,\" namely, a \"an instinct for engineering\"\r\nsuggesting to him useful implements;[3120] also an instinct of right\r\nsuggesting to him his moral conceptions. These two instincts form a\r\npart of his makeup; he has them from his birth, \"as birds have their\r\nfeathers, and bears their hair. Hence he is perfectible through nature,\r\nand merely conforms to nature in improving his mind and in bettering\r\nhis condition. Extend the idea farther along with Turgot and\r\nCondorcet,[3121] and, with all its exaggerations, we see arising, before\r\nthe end of the century, our modern theory of progress, that which founds\r\nall our aspirations on the boundless advance of the sciences, on the\r\nincrease of comforts which their applied discoveries constantly bring\r\nto the human condition, and on the increase of good sense which their\r\ndiscoveries, popularized, slowly deposit in the human brain.\r\n\r\nA second principle has to be established to complete the foundations\r\nof history. Discovered by Montesquieu it still to-day serves as\r\na constructive support, and, if we resume the work, as if on the\r\nsubstructure of the master's edifice, it is simply owing to accumulated\r\nerudition placing at our disposal more substantial and more abundant\r\nmaterials. In human society all parts are interdependent; no\r\nmodification of one can take place without effecting proportionate\r\nchanges in the others. Institutions, laws and customs are not mingled\r\ntogether, as in a heap, through chance or caprice, but connected one\r\nwith the other through convenience or necessity, as in a harmony.[3122]\r\nAccording as authority is in all, in several or in one hand, according\r\nas the sovereign admits or rejects laws superior to himself, with\r\nintermediary powers below him, everything changes or tends to differ in\r\nmeaning and in importance:\r\n\r\n* public intelligence,\r\n\r\n* education,\r\n\r\n* the form of judgments,\r\n\r\n* the nature and order of penalties,\r\n\r\n* the condition of women,\r\n\r\n* military organization\r\n\r\n* and the nature and the extent of taxation.\r\n\r\nA multitude of subordinate wheels depend on the great central wheel. For\r\nif the clock runs, it is owing to the harmony of its various parts, from\r\nwhich it follows that, on this harmony ceasing, the clock gets out of\r\norder. But, besides the principal spring, there are others which, acting\r\non or in combination with it, give to each clock a special character and\r\na peculiar movement. Such, in the first place, is climate, that is to\r\nsay, the degree of heat or cold, humidity or dryness, with its infinite\r\neffects on man's physical and moral attributes, followed by its\r\ninfluence on political, civil and domestic servitude or freedom.\r\nLikewise the soil, according to its fertility, its position and its\r\nextent. Likewise the physical régime, according as a people is composed\r\nof hunters, shepherds or agriculturists. Likewise the fecundity of the\r\nrace, and the consequent slow or rapid increase of population, and also\r\nthe excess in number, now of males and now of females. And finally,\r\nlikewise, are national character and religion.--All these causes, each\r\nadded to the other, or each limited by the other, contribute together\r\nto form a total result, namely society. Simple or complex, stable or\r\nunstable, barbarous or civilized, this society contains within itself\r\nits explanations of its being. Strange as a social structure may be, it\r\ncan be explained; also its institutions, however contradictory. Neither\r\nprosperity, nor decline, nor despotism, nor freedom, is the result of\r\na throw of the dice, of luck or an unexpected turn of events caused by\r\nrash men. They are conditions we must live with. In any event, it is\r\nuseful to understand them, either to improve our situation or bear it\r\npatiently, sometimes to carry out appropriate reforms, sometimes to\r\nrenounce impracticable reforms, now to assume the authority necessary\r\nfor success, and now the prudence making us abstain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The New Psychology.\r\n\r\n     The transformation of psychology.--Condillac.--The theory of\r\n     sensation and of signs.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the core of moral science; the human being in general. The\r\nnatural history of the mind must be dealt with, and this must be done\r\nas we have done the others, by discarding all prejudice and adhering\r\nto facts, taking analogy for our guide, beginning with origins and\r\nfollowing, step by step, the development by which the infant, the\r\nsavage, the uncultivated primitive man, is converted into the rational\r\nand cultivated man. Let us consider life at the outset, the animal at\r\nthe lowest degree on the scale, the human being as soon as it is born.\r\nThe first thing we find is perception, agreeable or disagreeable, and\r\nnext a want, propensity or desire, and therefore at last, by means of\r\na physiological mechanism, voluntary or involuntary movements, more or\r\nless accurate and more or less appropriate and coordinated. And this\r\nelementary fact is not merely primitive; it is, again, constant and\r\nuniversal, since we encounter it at each moment of each life, and in\r\nthe most complicated as well as in the simplest. Let us accordingly\r\nascertain whether it is not the thread with which all our mental cloth\r\nis woven, and whether its spontaneous unfolding, and the knotting of\r\nmesh after mesh, is not finally to produce the entire network of our\r\nthought and passion.--Condillac (1715-1780)provides us here with\r\nan incomparable clarity and precision with the answers to all our\r\nquestions, which, however the revival of theological prejudice and\r\nGerman metaphysics was to bring into discredit in the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, but which fresh observation, the establishment\r\nof mental pathology, and dissection have now (in 1875) brought back,\r\njustified and completed.[3123] Locke had already stated that our ideas\r\nall originate in outward or inward experience. Condillac shows further\r\nthat the actual elements of perception, memory, idea, imagination,\r\njudgment, reasoning, knowledge are sensations, properly so called,\r\nor revived sensations; our loftiest ideas are derived from no other\r\nmaterial, for they can be reduced to signs which are themselves\r\nsensations of a certain kind. Sensations accordingly form the substance\r\nof human or of animal intelligence; but the former infinitely surpasses\r\nthe latter in this, that, through the creation of signs, it succeeds in\r\nisolating, abstracting and noting fragments of sensations, that is to\r\nsay, in forming, combining and employing general conceptions.--This\r\nbeing granted, we are able to verify all our ideas, for, through\r\nreflection, we can revive and reconstruct the ideas we had formed\r\nwithout any reflection. No abstract definitions exist at the outset;\r\nabstraction is ulterior and derivative; foremost in each science must\r\nbe placed examples, experiences, evident facts; from these we derive our\r\ngeneral idea. In the same way we derive from several general ideas of\r\nthe same degree another general idea, and so on successively, step by\r\nstep, always proceeding according to the natural order of things, by\r\nconstant analysis, using expressive signs, as with mathematicians in\r\npassing from calculation by the fingers to calculation by numerals, and\r\nfrom this to calculation by letters, and who, calling upon the eyes\r\nto aid Reason, depict the inward analogy of quantities by the outward\r\nanalogy of symbols. In this way science becomes complete by means of a\r\nproperly organized language.[3124]--Through this reversal of the\r\nusual method we summarily dispose of disputes about words, escape the\r\nillusions of human speech, simplify study, remodel education, enhance\r\ndiscoveries, subject every assertion to control, and bring all truths\r\nwithin reach of all understandings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The Analytical Method.\r\n\r\n     The analytical method.--Its principle.--The conditions\r\n     requisite to make it productive.--These conditions wanting\r\n     or inadequate in the 18th century.--The truth and survival\r\n     of the principle.\r\n\r\nSuch is the course to be pursued with all the sciences, and especially\r\nwith the moral and political sciences. To consider in turn each distinct\r\nprovince of human activity, to decompose the leading notions out\r\nof which we form our conceptions, those of religion, society and\r\ngovernment, those of utility, wealth and exchange, those of justice,\r\nright and duty. To revert to manifest facts, to first experiences,\r\nto the simple circumstances in which the elements of our ideas are\r\nincluded; to extricate from these the precious lode without omission\r\nor mixture; to recompose our idea with these, to define its meaning and\r\ndetermine its value; to substitute for the vague and vulgar notion with\r\nwhich we started out the precise scientific definition we arrive at,\r\nand for the impure metal we received the refined metal we recovered,\r\nconstituted the prevalent method taught by the philosophers under\r\nthe name of analysis, and which sums up the whole progress of the\r\ncentury.--Up to this point, and not farther, they are right; truth,\r\nevery truth, is found in observable things, and only from these can\r\nit be derived; there is no other pathway leading to discovery. The\r\noperation, undoubtedly, is productive only when the vein is rich, and\r\nwe possess the means of extracting the ore. To obtain a just notion of\r\ngovernment, of religion, of right, of wealth, a man must be a historian\r\nbeforehand, a jurisconsult and economist, and have gathered up myriad\r\nof facts; and, besides all this, he must possess a vast erudition, an\r\nexperienced and professional perspicacity. If these conditions are only\r\npartially complied with, the result will only be a half finished product\r\nor a doubtful alloy, a few rough drafts of the sciences, the rudiments\r\nof pedagogy as with Rousseau, of political economy with Quesnay, Smith,\r\nand Turgot, of linguistics with Des Brosses, and of arithmetical\r\nmorals and criminal legislation with Bentham. Finally, if none of these\r\nconditions are complied with, the same efforts will, in the hands of\r\nphilosophical amateurs and oratorical charlatans, undoubtedly only\r\nproduce mischievous compounds and destructive explosions.--Nevertheless\r\ngood procedure remains good even when ignorant and the impetuous men\r\nmake a bad use of it; and if we of to day resume the abortive effort of\r\nthe eighteenth century, it should be within the guidelines they set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3101: \"Philosophioe naturalis principia,\" 1687; \"Optics,\"\r\n1704.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3102: See concerning this development Comte's \"Philosophie\r\nPositive,\" vol.

THE CLASSIC SPIRIT, THE SECOND ELEMENT.\r\n\r\nThis grand and magnificent system of new truths resembles a tower of\r\nwhich the first story, quickly finished, at once becomes accessible to\r\nthe public. The public ascends the structure and is requested by its\r\nconstructors to look about, not at the sky and at surrounding space,\r\nbut right before it, towards the ground, so that it may at last become\r\nfamiliar with the country in which it lives. Certainly, the point of\r\nview is good, and the advice is well thought-out. The conclusion that\r\nthe public will have an accurate view is not warranted, for the state\r\nof its eyes must be examined, to ascertain whether it is near or\r\nfar-sighted, or if the retina naturally, or through habit, is sensitive\r\nto certain colors. In the same way the French of the eighteenth century\r\nmust be considered, the structure of their inward vision, that is to\r\nsay, the fixed form of their intelligence which they are bringing with\r\nthem, unknowingly and unwillingly, up upon their new tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Through Colored Glasses.\r\n\r\n     Its signs, duration and power.--Its origin and public\r\n     supporters.--Its vocabulary, grammar and style.--Its\r\n     method, merits and defects.\r\n\r\nThis fixed intelligence consists of the classic spirit, which applied\r\nto the scientific acquisitions of the period, produces the philosophy\r\nof the century and the doctrines of the Revolution. Various signs denote\r\nits presence, and notably its oratorical, regular and correct style,\r\nwholly consisting of ready-made phrases and contiguous ideas. It lasts\r\ntwo centuries, from Malherbe and Balzac to Delille and de Fontanes, and\r\nduring this long period, no man of intellect, save two or three, and\r\nthen only in private memoirs, as in the case of Saint-Simon, also in\r\nfamiliar letters like those of the marquis and bailly de Mirabeau,\r\neither dares or can withdraw himself from its empire. Far from\r\ndisappearing with the ancient regime it forms the matrix out of which\r\nevery discourse and document issues, even the phrases and vocabulary\r\nof the Revolution. Now, what is more effective than a ready-made mold,\r\nenforced, accepted, in which by virtue of natural tendency, of tradition\r\nand of education, everyone can enclose their thinking? This one,\r\naccordingly, is a historic force, and of the highest order; to\r\nunderstand it let us consider how it came into being.--It appeared\r\ntogether with the regular monarchy and polite conversation, and it\r\naccompanies these, not accidentally, but naturally and automatically.\r\nFor it is product of the new society, of the new regime and its customs:\r\nI mean of an aristocracy left idle due the encroaching monarchy, of\r\npeople well born and well educated who, withdrawn from public activity,\r\nfall back on conversation and pass their leisure sampling the different\r\nserious or refined pleasures of the intellect.[3201] Eventually, they\r\nhave no other role nor interest than to talk, to listen, to entertain\r\nthemselves agreeably and with ease, on all subjects, grave or gay, which\r\nmay interest men or even women of society, that's their great affair.\r\nIn the seventeenth century they are called \"les honnêtes gens\"[3202] and\r\nfrom now on a writer, even the most abstract, addresses himself to them.\r\n\"A gentleman,\" says Descartes, \"need not have read all books nor have\r\nstudiously acquired all that is taught in the schools;\" and he entitles\r\nhis last treatise, \"A search for Truth according to natural light, which\r\nalone, without aid of Religion or Philosophy, determines the truths\r\na gentleman should possess on all matters forming the subjects of his\r\nthoughts.\"[3203] In short, from one end of his philosophy to the other,\r\nthe only qualification he demands of his readers is \"natural good sense\"\r\nadded to the common stock of experience acquired by contact with the\r\nworld.--As these make up the audience they are likewise the judges. \"One\r\nmust study the taste of the court,\" says Molière,[3204] \"for in no place\r\nare verdicts more just. . . With simple common sense and intercourse\r\nwith people of refinement, a habit of mind is there obtained which,\r\nwithout comparison, forms a more accurate, judgment of things than the\r\nrusty attainments of the pedants.\" From this time forth, it may be said\r\nthat the arbiter of truth and of taste is not, as before, an\r\nerudite Scaliger, but a man of the world, a La Rochefoucauld, or a\r\nTréville.[3205] The pedant and, after him, the savant, the specialist,\r\nis set aside. \"True honest people,\" says Nicole after Pascal, \"require\r\nno sign. They need not be divined; they join in the conversation\r\ngoing on as they enter the room. They are not styled either poets\r\nor surveyors, but they are the judges of all these.\"[3206] In the\r\neighteenth century they constitute the sovereign authority. In the great\r\ncrowd of blockheads sprinkled with pedants, there is, says Voltaire,\r\n\"a small group apart called good society, which, rich, educated and\r\npolished, forms, you might say, the flower of humanity; it is for this\r\ngroup that the greatest men have labored; it is this group which accords\r\nsocial recognition.\"[3207] Admiration, favor, importance, belong not to\r\nthose who are worthy of it but to those who address themselves to this\r\ngroup. \"In 1789,\" said the Abbé Maury, \"the French Academy alone enjoyed\r\nany esteem in France, and it really bestowed a standing. That of the\r\nSciences signified nothing in public opinion, any more than that of\r\nInscriptions. . . The languages is considered a science for fools.\r\nD'Alembert was ashamed of belonging to the Academy of Sciences. Only a\r\nhandful of people listen to a mathematician, a chemist, etc. but the man\r\nof letters, the lecturer, has the world at his feet.\"[3208]--Under such\r\na strong pressure the mind necessarily follows a literary and verbal\r\nroute in conformity with the exigencies, the proprieties, the tastes,\r\nand the degree of attention and of instruction of its public.[3209]\r\nHence the classic mold,--formed out of the habit of speaking, writing\r\nand thinking for a drawing room audience.[3210]\r\n\r\nThis is immediately evident in its style and language. Between Amyot,\r\nRabelais and Montaigne on the one hand, and Châteaubriand, Victor Hugo\r\nand Honoré de Balzac on the other, classic French comes into being and\r\ndies. From the very first it is described at the language of \"honest\r\npeople.\" It is fashioned not merely for them, but by them, and\r\nVaugelas,[3211] their secretary, devotes himself for thirty years to\r\nthe registry of decisions according to the usages only of good society.\r\nHence, throughout, both in vocabulary and in grammar, the language\r\nis refashioned over and over again, according to the cast of their\r\nintellects, which is the prevailing intellect.--\r\n\r\nIn the first place the vocabulary is diminished:\r\n\r\n* Most of the words specially employed on erudite and technical\r\nsubjects, expressions that are too Greek or too Latin, terms peculiar to\r\nthe schools, to science, to occupations, to the household, are excluded\r\nfrom discourse;\r\n\r\n* those too closely denoting a particular occupation or profession are\r\nnot considered proper in general conversation.\r\n\r\n* A vast number of picturesque and expressive words are dropped, all\r\nthat are crude, gaulois or naifs, all that are local and provincial, or\r\npersonal and made-up, all familiar and proverbial locutions,[3212] many\r\nbrusque, familiar and frank turns of thought, every haphazard, telling\r\nmetaphor, almost every description of impulsive and dexterous utterance\r\nthrowing a flash of light into the imagination and bringing into\r\nview the precise, colored and complete form, but of which a too vivid\r\nimpression would run counter to the proprieties of polite conversation.\r\n\r\n\"One improper word,\" said Vaugelas, \"is all that is necessary to bring a\r\nperson in society into contempt,\"\r\n\r\nand, on the eve of the Revolution, an objectionable term denounced by\r\nMadame de Luxembourg still consigns a man to the rank of\r\n\"espèces,\" because correct expression is ever an element of good\r\nmanners.--Language, through this constant scratching, is attenuated and\r\nbecomes colorless: Vaugelas estimates that one-half of the phrases and\r\nterms employed by Amyot are set aside.[3213] With the exception of\r\nLa Fontaine, an isolated and spontaneous genius, who reopens the old\r\nsources, and La Bruyère, a bold seeker, who opens a fresh source, and\r\nVoltaire an incarnate demon who, in his anonymous and pseudonymous\r\nwritings, gives the rein to the violent, crude expressions of his\r\ninspiration,[3214] the terms which are most appropriate fall into\r\ndesuetude. One day, Gresset, in a discourse at the Academy, dares utter\r\nfour or five of these,[3215] relating, I believe, to carriages and\r\nhead-dresses, whereupon murmurs at once burst forth. During his long\r\nretreat he had become provincial and lost the touch.--By degrees,\r\ndiscourses are composed of \"general expressions\" only. These are even\r\nemployed, in accordance with Buffon's precept, to designate concrete\r\nobjects. They are more in conformity with the polished courtesy which\r\nsmoothes over, appeases, and avoids rough or familiar expressions, to\r\nwhich some views appear gross or rude unless partly hidden by a veil.\r\nThis makes it easier for the superficial listener; prevailing terms\r\nalone will immediately arouse current and common ideas; they are\r\nintelligible to every man from the single fact that he belongs to the\r\ndrawing-room; special terms, on the contrary, demand an effort of the\r\nmemory or of the imagination. Suppose that, in relation to Franks or\r\nto savages, I should mention \"a battle-ax,\" which would be at once\r\nunderstood; should I mention a \"tomahawk,\" or a \"francisque,\"[3216]\r\nmany would imagine that I was speaking Teuton or Iroquois.[3217] In this\r\nrespect the more fashionable and refined the style, the more punctilious\r\nthe effort. Every appropriate term is banished from poetry; if one\r\nhappens to enter the mind it must be evaded or replaced by a paraphrase.\r\nAn eighteenth century poet can hardly permit himself to employ more\r\nthan one-third of the dictionary, poetic language at last becomes\r\nso restricted as to compel a man with anything to say not to express\r\nhimself in verse.[3218]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the more you prune the more you thin out. Reduced to\r\na select vocabulary the Frenchman deals with fewer subjects, but he\r\ndescribes them more agreeably and more clearly. \"Courtesy, accuracy\",\r\n(Urbanité, exactitude!), these two words, born at the same time with the\r\nFrench Academy, describes in a nutshell the reform of which it is the\r\ntool, and which the drawing-room, by it, and alongside of it, imposes on\r\nthe public. Grand seigniors in retirement, and unoccupied fine ladies,\r\nenjoy the examination of the subtleties of words for the purpose\r\nof composing maxims, definitions and characters. With admirable\r\nscrupulousness and infinitely delicate tact, writers and people society\r\napply themselves to weighing each word and each phrase in order to\r\nfix its sense, to measure its force and bearing, to determine its\r\naffinities, use and connections This work of precision is carried on\r\nfrom the earliest academicians, Vaugelas, Chapelain and Conrart, to the\r\nend of the classic epoch, in the Synonymes by Bauzée and by Girard, in\r\nthe Remarque by Duclos, in the Commentaire by Voltaire on Corneille, in\r\nthe Lycée by la Harpe,[3219] in the efforts, the example, the practice\r\nand the authority of the great and the inferior writers of which all are\r\ncorrect. Never did architects, obliged to use ordinary broken highway\r\nstones in building, better understand each piece, its dimensions,\r\nits shape, its resistance, its possible connections and suitable\r\nposition.--Once this was learned, the task was to construct with the\r\nleast trouble and with the utmost solidity; the grammar was consequently\r\nchanged at the same time and in the same way as the dictionary. Hence no\r\nlonger permitting the words to reflect the way impressions and emotions\r\nwere felt; they now had to be regularly and rigorously assigned\r\naccording to the invariable hierarchy of concepts. The writer may no\r\nlonger begin his text with the leading figure or the main purpose of\r\nhis story; the setting is given and the places assigned beforehand. Each\r\npart of the discourse has its own place; no omission or transposition is\r\npermitted, as was done in the sixteenth century[3220]. All parts must\r\nbe included, each in its definite place: at first the subject of the\r\nsentence with its appendices, then the verb, then the object direct,\r\nand, finally, the indirect connections. In this way the sentence forms a\r\ngraduated scaffolding, the substance coming foremost, then the quality,\r\nthen the modes and varieties of the quality, just as a good architect\r\nin the first place poses his foundation, then the building, then the\r\naccessories, economically and prudently, with a view to adapt each\r\nsection of the edifice to the support of the section following after it.\r\nNo sentence demands any less attention than another, nor is there any in\r\nwhich one may not at every step verify the connection or incoherence of\r\nthe parts.[3221]--The procedure used in arranging a simple sentence also\r\ngoverns that of the period, the paragraph and the series of paragraphs;\r\nit forms the style as it forms the syntax. Each small edifice occupies\r\na distinct position, and but one, in the great total edifice. As the\r\ndiscourse advances, each section must in turn file in, never before,\r\nnever after, no parasitic member being allowed to intrude, and no\r\nregular member being allowed to encroach on its neighbor, while all\r\nthese members bound together by their very positions must move onward,\r\ncombining all their forces on one single point. Finally, we have for\r\nthe first time in a writing, natural and distinct groups, complete and\r\ncompact harmonies, none of which infringe on the others or allow others\r\nto infringe on them. It is no longer allowable to write haphazard,\r\naccording to the caprice of one's inspiration, to discharge one's ideas\r\nin bulk, to let oneself be interrupted by parentheses, to string along\r\ninterminable rows of citations and enumerations. An end is proposed;\r\nsome truth is to be demonstrated, some definition to be ascertained,\r\nsome conviction to be brought about; to do this we must march, and ever\r\ndirectly onward. Order, sequence, progress, proper transitions, constant\r\ndevelopment constitute the characteristics of this style. To such\r\nan extent is this pushed, that from the very first, personal\r\ncorrespondence, romances, humorous pieces, and all ironical and gallant\r\neffusions, consist of morsels of systematic eloquence.[3222] At the\r\nHôtel Rambouillet, the explanatory period is displayed with as much\r\nfullness and as rigorously as with Descartes himself. One of the words\r\nmost frequently occurring with Mme. de Scudéry is the conjunction for\r\n(in French car). Passion is worked out through close-knit arguments.\r\nDrawing room compliments stretch along in sentences as finished as\r\nthose of an academical dissertation. Scarcely completed, the instrument\r\nalready discloses its aptitudes. We are aware of its being made to\r\nexplain, to demonstrate, to persuade and to popularize. Condillac, a\r\ncentury later, is justified in saying that it is in itself a systematic\r\nmeans of decomposition and of recomposition, a scientific method\r\nanalogous to arithmetic and algebra. At the very least it possesses the\r\nincontestable advantage of starting with a few ordinary terms, and of\r\nleading the reader along with facility and promptness, by a series of\r\nsimple combinations, up to the loftiest.[3223] By virtue of this, in\r\n1789, the French tongue ranks above every other. The Berlin Academy\r\npromises a prize to for anyone who best can explain its pre-eminence. It\r\nis spoken throughout Europe. No other language is used in diplomacy. As\r\nformerly with Latin, it is international, and appears that, from now on,\r\nit is to be the preferred tool whenever men are to reason.\r\n\r\nIt is the organ only of a certain kind of reasoning, la raison\r\nraisonnante, that requiring the least preparation for thought, giving\r\nitself as little trouble as possible, content with its acquisitions,\r\ntaking no pains to increase or renew them, incapable of, or unwilling to\r\nembrace the plenitude and complexity of the facts of real life. In its\r\npurism, in its disdain of terms suited to the occasion, in its avoidance\r\nof lively sallies, in the extreme regularity of its developments, the\r\nclassic style is powerless to fully portray or to record the infinite\r\nand varied details of experience. It rejects any description of\r\nthe outward appearance of reality, the immediate impressions of the\r\neyewitness, the heights and depths of passion, the physiognomy, at once\r\nso composite yet absolute personal, of the breathing individual, in\r\nshort, that unique harmony of countless traits, blended together\r\nand animated, which compose not human character in general but one\r\nparticular personality, and which a Saint-Simon, a Balzac, or a\r\nShakespeare himself could not render if the rich language they used,\r\nand which was enhanced by their temerities, did not contribute its\r\nsubtleties to the multiplied details of their observation.[3224]\r\nNeither the Bible, nor Homer, nor Dante, nor Shakespeare[3225] could be\r\ntranslated with this style. Read Hamlet's monologue in Voltaire and see\r\nwhat remains of it, an abstract piece of declamation, with about as much\r\nof the original in it as there is of Othello in his Orosmane. Look at\r\nHomer and then at Fenelon in the island of Calypso; the wild, rocky\r\nisland, where \"gulls and other sea-birds with long wings,\" build their\r\nnests, becomes in pure French prose an orderly park arranged \"for the\r\npleasure of the eye.\" In the eighteenth century, contemporary novelists,\r\nthemselves belonging to the classic epoch, Fielding, Swift, Defoe,\r\nSterne and Richardson, are admitted into France only after excisions and\r\nmuch weakening; their expressions are too free and their scenes are to\r\nimpressive; their freedom, their coarseness, their peculiarities, would\r\nform blemishes; the translator abbreviates, softens, and sometimes,\r\nin his preface, apologizes for what he retains. Room is found, in this\r\nlanguage, only for a partial lifelikeness, for some of the truth, a\r\nscanty portion, and which constant refining daily renders still more\r\nscanty. Considered in itself, the classic style is always tempted to\r\naccept slight, insubstantial commonplaces for its subject materials.\r\nIt spins them out, mingles and weaves them together; only a fragile\r\nfiligree, however, issues from its logical apparatus; we may admire the\r\nelegant workmanship; but in practice, the work is of little, none, or\r\nnegative service.\r\n\r\nFrom these characteristics of style we divine those of the mind for\r\nwhich it serves as a tool.--Two principal operations constitute the\r\nactivity of the human understanding.--Observing things and events,\r\nit receives a more or less complete, profound and exact impression\r\nof these; and after this, turning away from them, it analyses its\r\nimpressions, and classifies, distributes, and more or less skillfully\r\nexpresses the ideas derived from them.--In the second of these\r\noperations the classicist is superior. Obliged to adapt himself to his\r\naudience, that is to say, to people of society who are not specialists\r\nand yet critical, he necessarily carries to perfection the art of\r\nexciting attention and of making himself heard; that is to say, the art\r\nof composition and of writing.--With patient industry, and multiplied\r\nprecautions, he carries the reader along with him by a series of easy\r\nrectilinear conceptions, step by step, omitting none, beginning with the\r\nlowest and thus ascending to the highest, always progressing with\r\nsteady and measured peace, securely and agreeably as on a promenade. No\r\ninterruption or diversion is possible: on either side, along the\r\nroad, balustrades keep him within bounds, each idea extending into the\r\nfollowing one by such an insensible transition, that he involuntarily\r\nadvances, without stopping or turning aside, until brought to the final\r\ntruth where he is to be seated. Classic literature throughout bears\r\nthe imprint of this talent; there is no branch of it into which the\r\nqualities of a good discourse do not enter and form a part.--They\r\ndominate those sort of works which, in themselves, are only\r\nhalf-literary, but which, by its help, become fully so, transforming\r\nmanuscripts into fine works of art which their subject-matter would\r\nhave classified as scientific works, as reports of action, as historical\r\ndocuments, as philosophical treatises, as doctrinal expositions, as\r\nsermons, polemics, dissertations and demonstrations. It transforms even\r\ndictionaries and operates from Descartes to Condillac, from Bossuet to\r\nBuffon and Voltaire, from Pascal to Rousseau and Beaumarchais, in short,\r\nbecoming prose almost entirely, even in official dispatches, diplomatic\r\nand private correspondence, from Madame de Sévigné to Madame du Deffant;\r\nincluding so many perfect letters flowing from the pens of women who\r\nwere unaware of it.--Such prose is paramount in those works which, in\r\nthemselves, are literary, but which derive from it an oratorical\r\nturn. Not only does it impose a rigid plan, a regular distribution of\r\nparts[3226] in dramatic works, accurate proportions, suppressions and\r\nconnections, a sequence and progress, as in a passage of eloquence,\r\nbut again it tolerates only the most perfect discourse. There is no\r\ncharacter that is not an accomplished orator; with Corneille and Racine,\r\nwith Molière himself, the confidant, the barbarian king, the young\r\ncavalier, the drawing room coquette, the valet, all show themselves\r\nadepts in the use of language. Never have we encountered such adroit\r\nintroductions, such well-arranged evidence, such just reflections, such\r\ndelicate transitions, such conclusive summing ups. Never have dialogues\r\nborne such a strong resemblance to verbal sparring matches. Each\r\nnarration, each portrait, each detail of action, might be detached and\r\nserve as a good example for schoolboys, along with the masterpieces of\r\nthe ancient tribune. So strong is this tendency that, on the approach\r\nof the final moment, in the agony of death, alone and without\r\nwitnesses, the character finds the means to plead his own frenzy and die\r\neloquently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Its Original Deficiency.\r\n\r\n     Its original deficiency.--Signs of this in the 17th\r\n     century.--It grows with time and success.--Proofs of this\r\n     growth in the 18th century.--Serious poetry, the drama,\r\n     history and romances.--Short-sighted views of man and of\r\n     human existence.\r\n\r\nThis excess indicates a deficiency. In the two operations which the\r\nhuman mind performs, the classicist is more successful in the second\r\nthan in the first. The second, indeed, stands in the way of the first,\r\nthe obligation of always speaking correctly makes him refrain from\r\nsaying all that ought to be said. With him the form is more important\r\nthan abundant contents, the firsthand observations which serve as\r\na living source losing, in the regulated channels to which they are\r\nconfined, their force, depth and impetuosity. Real poetry, able to\r\nconvey dream and illusion, cannot be brought forth. Lyric poetry proves\r\nabortive, and likewise the epic poem.[3227] Nothing sprouts on these\r\ndistant fields, remote and sublime, where speech unites with music and\r\npainting. Never do we hear the involuntary scream of intense torment,\r\nthe lonely confession of a distraught soul,[3228] pouring out his heart\r\nto relieve himself. When a creation of characters is imperative, as\r\nin dramatic poetry, the classic mold fashions but one kind, that which\r\nthrough education, birth, or impersonation, always speak correctly,\r\nin other words, like so many people of high society. No others are\r\nportrayed on the stage or elsewhere, from Corneille and Racine to\r\nMarivaux and Beaumarchais. So strong is the habit that it imposes\r\nitself even on La Fontaine's animals, on the servants of Molière, on\r\nMontesquieu's Persians, and on the Babylonians, the Indians and the\r\nMicromégas of Voltaire.--It must be stated, furthermore, that\r\nthese characters are only partly real. In real persons two kinds of\r\ncharacteristics may be noted; the first, few in number, which he or\r\nshe shares with others of their kind and which any reader readily\r\nmay identify; and the other kind, of which there are a great many,\r\ndescribing only one particular person and these are much more difficult\r\nto discover. Classic art concerns itself only with the former; it\r\npurposely effaces, neglects or subordinates the latter. It does not\r\nbuild individual persons but generalized characters, a king, a queen,\r\na young prince, a confidant, a high-priest, a captain of the guards,\r\nseized by some passion, habit or inclination, such as love, ambition,\r\nfidelity or perfidy, a despotic or a yielding temper, some species of\r\nwickedness or of native goodness. As to the circumstances of time and\r\nplace, which, amongst others, exercise a most powerful influence in\r\nshaping and diversifying man, it hardly notes them, even setting them\r\naside. In a tragedy the scene is set everywhere and any time, the\r\ncontrary, that the action takes place nowhere in no specific epoch, is\r\nequally valid. It may take place in any palace or in any temple,[3229]\r\nin which, to get rid of all historic or personal impressions, habits\r\nand costumes are introduced conventionally, being neither French nor\r\nforeign, nor ancient, nor modern. In this abstract world the address\r\nis always \"you\"(as opposed to the familiar thou),[3230] \"Seigneur\" and\r\n\"Madame,\" the noble style always clothing the most different characters\r\nin the same dress. When Corneille and Racine, through the stateliness\r\nand elegance of their verse, afford us a glimpse of contemporary figures\r\nthey do it unconsciously, imagining that they are portraying man in\r\nhimself; and, if we of the present time recognize in their pieces\r\neither the gentleman, the duelists, the bullies, the politicians or\r\nthe heroines of the Fronde, or the courtiers, princes and bishops, the\r\nladies and gentlemen in waiting of the regular monarchy, it is because\r\nthey have inadvertently dipped their brush in their own experience, some\r\nof its color having fallen accidentally on the bare ideal outline which\r\nthey wished to trace. We have simply a contour, a general sketch, filled\r\nup with the harmonious gray tone of correct diction.--Even in comedy,\r\nnecessarily employing current habits, even with Molière, so frank and\r\nso bold, the model is unfinished, all individual peculiarities being\r\nsuppressed, the face becoming for a moment a theatrical mask, and\r\nthe personage, especially when talking in verse, sometimes losing\r\nits animation in becoming the mouth-piece for a monologue or a\r\ndissertation.[3231] The stamp of rank, condition or fortune, whether\r\ngentleman or bourgeois, provincial or Parisian, is frequently\r\noverlooked.[3232] We are rarely made to appreciate physical externals,\r\nas in Shakespeare, the temperament, the state of the nervous system,\r\nthe bluff or drawling tone, the impulsive or restrained action, the\r\nemaciation or obesity of a character.[3233] Frequently no trouble is\r\ntaken to find a suitable name, this being either Chrysale, Orgon, Damis,\r\nDorante, or Valère. The name designates only a simple quality, that of\r\na father, a youth, a valet, a grumbler, a gallant, and, like an ordinary\r\ncloak, fitting indifferently all forms alike, as it passes from\r\nthe wardrobe of Molière to that of Regnard, Destouche, Lesage or\r\nMarivaux.[3234] The character lacks the personal badge, the unique,\r\nauthentic appellation serving as the primary stamp of an individual. All\r\nthese details and circumstances, all these aids and accompaniments of\r\na man, remain outside of the classic theory. To secure the admission\r\nof some of them required the genius of Molière, the fullness of his\r\nconception, the wealth of his observation, the extreme freedom of his\r\npen. It is equally true again that he often omits them, and that, in\r\nother cases, he introduces only a small number of them, because he\r\navoids giving to these general characters a richness and complexity that\r\nmight interfere with the story. The simpler the theme the clearer its\r\ndevelopment, the first duty of the author throughout this literature\r\nbeing to clearly develop the restricted theme of which he makes a\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThere is, accordingly, a radical defect in the classic spirit, the\r\ndefect of its qualities, and which, at first kept within proper bounds,\r\ncontributes towards the production of its purest master-pieces, but\r\nwhich, in accordance with the universal law, goes on increasing and\r\nturns into a vice through the natural effect of age, use, and success.\r\nContracted at the start, it is to become yet more so. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury the description of real life, of a specific person, just as he\r\nis in nature and in history, that is to say, an undefined unit, a rich\r\nplexus, a complete organism of peculiarities and traits, superposed,\r\nentangled and co-ordinated, is improper. The capacity to receive and\r\ncontain all these is wanting. Whatever can be discarded is cast aside,\r\nand to such an extent that nothing is left at last but a condensed\r\nextract, an evaporated residuum, an almost empty name, in short, what\r\nis called a hollow abstraction. The only characters in the eighteenth\r\ncentury exhibiting any life are the off-hand sketches, made in passing\r\nand as if contraband, by Voltaire, Baron de Thundertentronk and Milord\r\nWatthen, the lesser figures in his stories, and five or six portraits of\r\nsecondary rank, Turcaret, Gil Blas, Marianne, Manon Lescaut, Rameau, and\r\nFigaro, two or three of the rough sketches of Crébillon the younger\r\nand of Collé, all so many works in which sap flows through a familiar\r\nknowledge of things, comparable with those of the minor masters in\r\npainting, Watteau, Fragonard, Saint-Aubin, Moreau, Lancret, Pater, and\r\nBeaudouin, and which, accepted with difficulty, or as a surprise, by the\r\nofficial drawing room are still to subsist after the grander and soberer\r\ncanvases shall have become moldy through their wearisome exhalations.\r\nEverywhere else the sap dries up, and, instead of blooming plants, we\r\nencounter only flowers of painted paper. What are all the serious poems,\r\nfrom the \"la Henriade\" of Voltaire to the \"Mois\" by Roucher or the\r\n\"l'Imagination\" by Delille, but so many pieces of rhetoric garnished\r\nwith rhymes? Examine the innumerable tragedies and comedies of which\r\nGrimm and Collé gives us mortuary extracts, even the meritorious works\r\nof Voltaire and Crébillon, and later, those of authors of repute, Du\r\nBelloy, Laharpe, Ducis, and Marie Chénier? Eloquence, art, situations,\r\ncorrect verse, all exist in these except human nature; the personages\r\nare simply well-taught puppets, and generally mere mouthpieces by\r\nwhich the author makes his declamation public; Greeks, Romans, Medieval\r\nknights, Turks, Arabs, Peruvians, Giaours, or Byzantines, they have\r\nall the same declamatory mechanisms. The public, meanwhile, betrays\r\nno surprise. It is not aware of history. It assumes that humanity is\r\neverywhere the same. It establishes the success alike of the \"Incas\" by\r\nMarmontel, and of \"Gonsalve\" and the \"Nouvelles\" by Florian; also of the\r\npeasants, mechanics, Negroes, Brazilians, Parsees, and Malabarites\r\nthat appear before it churning out their exaggerations. Man is simply\r\nregarded as a reasoning being, alike in all ages and alike in all\r\nplaces; Bernardin de Saint-Pierre endows his pariah with this habit,\r\nlike Diderot, in his Tahitians. The one recognized principle is that\r\nevery human being must think and talk like a book.--And how inadequate\r\ntheir historical background! With the exception of \"Charles XII.,\" a\r\ncontemporary on whom Voltaire, thanks to eye eye-witnesses, bestows\r\nfresh life, also his spirited sketches of Englishmen, Frenchmen,\r\nSpaniards, Italians and Germans, scattered through his stories, where\r\nare real persons to be found? With Hume, Gibbon and Robertson, belonging\r\nto the French school, and who are at once adopted in France, in the\r\nresearches into our middle ages of Dubos and of Mably, in the \"Louis XI\"\r\nof Duclos, in the \"Anarcharsis\" of Barthélemy, even in the \"Essai sur\r\nles Moeurs,\" and in the \"Siecle de Louis XIV\" of Voltaire, even in the\r\n\"Grandeur des Romains,\" and the \"Esprit des Lois\" of Montesquieu, what\r\npeculiar deficiency! Erudition, criticism, common sense, an almost\r\nexact exposition of dogmas and of institutions, philosophic views of the\r\nrelationships between events and on the general run of these, nothing\r\nis lacking but the people! On reading these it seems as if the climates,\r\ninstitutions and civilizations which so completely modifies the human\r\nintellect, are simply so many outworks, so many fortuitous exteriors,\r\nwhich, far from reflecting its depths scarcely penetrate beneath its\r\nsurface. The vast differences separating the men of two centuries, or\r\nof two peoples, escape them entirely.[3235] The ancient Greek, the early\r\nChristian, the conquering Teuton, the feudal man, the Arab of Mahomet,\r\nthe German, the Renaissance Englishman, the puritan, appear in their\r\nbooks as in engravings and frontispieces, with some difference in\r\ncostume, but the same bodies, the same faces, the same countenances,\r\ntoned down, obliterated, proper, adapted to the conventionalities of\r\ngood manners. That sympathetic imagination by which the writer enters\r\ninto the mind of another, and reproduces in himself a system of habits\r\nand feelings so different from his own, is the talent the most absent in\r\nthe eighteenth century. With the exception of Diderot, who uses it badly\r\nand capriciously, it almost entirely disappears in the last half of\r\nthe century. Consider in turn, during the same period, in France and\r\nin England, where it is most extensively used, the romance, a sort of\r\nmirror everywhere transportable, the best adapted to reflect all phrases\r\nof nature and of life. After reading the series of English novelists,\r\nDefoe, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, and Goldsmith down to\r\nMiss Burney and Miss Austen, I have become familiar with England in the\r\neighteenth century; I have encountered clergymen, country gentlemen,\r\nfarmers, innkeepers, sailors, people of every condition in life, high\r\nand low; I know the details of fortunes and of careers, how much is\r\nearned, how much is expended, how journeys are made and how people eat\r\nand drink: I have accumulated for myself a file of precise biographical\r\nevents, a complete picture in a thousand scenes of an entire community,\r\nthe amplest stock of information to guide me should I wish to frame\r\na history of this vanished world. On reading a corresponding list of\r\nFrench novelists, the younger Crébillon, Rousseau, Marmontel, Laclos,\r\nRestif de la Breton, Louvet, Madame de Staël, Madame de Genlis and the\r\nrest, including Mercier and even Mme. Cottin, I scarcely take any\r\nnotes; all precise and instructive little facts are left out; I\r\nfind civilities, polite acts, gallantries, mischief-making, social\r\ndissertations and nothing else. They carefully abstain from mentioning\r\nmoney, from giving me figures, from describing a wedding, a trial, the\r\nadministration of a piece of property; I am ignorant of the situation\r\nof a curate, of a rustic noble, of a resident prior, of a steward, of an\r\nintendant. Whatever relates to a province or to the rural districts, to\r\nthe bourgeoisie or to the shop,[3236] to the army or to a soldier, to\r\nthe clergy or to convents, to justice or to the police, to business or\r\nto housekeeping remains vaguely in my mind or is falsified; to clear\r\nup any point I am obliged to recur to that marvelous Voltaire who, on\r\nlaying aside the great classic coat, finds plenty of elbow room\r\nand tells all. On the organs of society of vital importance, on the\r\npractices and regulations that provoke revolutions, on feudal rights and\r\nseigniorial justice, on the mode of recruiting and governing monastic\r\nbodies, on the revenue measures of the provinces, of corporations and of\r\ntrade-unions, on the tithes and the corvées,[3237] literature provides\r\nme with scarcely any information. Drawing-rooms and men of letters are\r\napparently its sole material. The rest is null and void. Outside\r\nthe good society that is able to converse France appears perfectly\r\nempty.--On the approach of the Revolution the elimination increases.\r\nLook through the harangues of the clubs and of the tribune, through\r\nreports, legislative bills and pamphlets, and through the mass of\r\nwritings prompted by passing and exciting events; in none of them do we\r\nsee any sign of the human creature as we see him in the fields and\r\nin the street; he is always regarded as a simple robot, a well\r\nknown mechanism. Among writers he was a moment ago a dispenser of\r\ncommonplaces, among politicians he is now a pliable voter; touch him in\r\nthe proper place and he responds in the desired manner. Facts are never\r\napparent; only abstractions, long arrays of sentences on nature,\r\nReason, and the people, on tyrants and liberty, like inflated balloons,\r\nuselessly conflicting with each other in space. Were we not aware that\r\nall this would terminate in terrible practical effects then we could\r\nregard it as competition in logic, as school exercises, academic\r\nparades, or ideological compositions. It is, in fact, Ideology, the last\r\nproduct of the century, which will stamp the classic spirit with its\r\nfinal formula and last word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Mathematical Method.\r\n\r\n     The philosophic method in conformity with the Classic Sprit.\r\n    --Ideology.--Abuse of the mathematical process.--Condillac,\r\n     Rousseau, Mably, Condorcet, Volney, Sieyès, Cabanis, and de\r\n     Tracy.--Excesses of simplification and boldness of\r\n     organization.\r\n\r\nThe natural process of the classic spirit is to pursue in every\r\nresearch, with the utmost confidence, without either reserve or\r\nprecaution, the mathematical method: to derive, limit and isolate a few\r\nof the simplest generalized notions and then, setting experience aside,\r\ncomparing them, combining them, and, from the artificial compound thus\r\nobtained, by pure reasoning, deduce all the consequences they involve.\r\nIt is so deeply implanted as to be equally encountered in both\r\ncenturies, as well with Descartes, Malebranche[3238] and the partisans\r\nof innate ideas as with the partisans of sensation, of physical needs\r\nand of primary instinct, Condillac, Rousseau, Helvétius, and later,\r\nCondorcet, Volney, Sieyès, Cabanis and Destutt de Tracy. In vain do\r\nthe latter assert that they are the followers of Bacon and reject (the\r\ntheory of) innate ideas; with another starting point than the Cartesians\r\nthey pursue the same path, and, as with the Cartesians, after borrowing\r\na little, they leave experience behind them. In this vast moral and\r\nsocial world, they only remove the superficial bark from the human tree\r\nwith its innumerable roots and branches; they are unable to penetrate\r\nto or grasp at anything beyond it; their hands cannot contain more. They\r\nhave no suspicion of anything outside of it; the classic spirit, with\r\nlimited comprehension, is not far-reaching. To them the bark is the\r\nentire tree, and, the operation once completed, they retire, bearing\r\nalong with them the dry, dead epidermis, never returning to the trunk\r\nitself. Through intellectual incapacity and literary pride they omit the\r\ncharacteristic detail, the animating fact, the specific circumstance,\r\nthe significant, convincing and complete example. Scarcely one of\r\nthese is found in the \"Logique\" and in the \"Traité des Sensations\" by\r\nCondillac, in the \"Idéologie\" by Destutt de Tracy, or in the \"Rapports\r\ndu Physique et du Morale\" by Cabanis.[3239] Never, with them, are we on\r\nthe solid and visible ground of personal observation and narration, but\r\nalways in the air, in the empty space of pure generalities. Condillac\r\ndeclares that the arithmetical method is adapted to psychology and that\r\nthe elements of our ideas can be defined by a process analogous \"to the\r\nrule of three.\" Sieyès holds history in profound contempt, and believes\r\nthat he had \"perfected the science of politics\"[3240] at one stroke,\r\nthrough an effort of the brain, in the style of Descartes, who thus\r\ndiscovers analytic geometry. Destutt de Tracy, in undertaking to\r\ncomment on Montesquieu, finds that the great historian has too servilely\r\nconfined himself to history, and attempts to do the work over again by\r\norganizing society as it should be, instead of studying society as it\r\nis.--Never were such systematic and superficial institutions built up\r\nwith such a moderate extract of human nature.[3241] Condillac, employing\r\nsensation, animates a statue, and then, by a process of pure reasoning,\r\nfollowing up its effects, as he supposes, on smell, taste, hearing,\r\nsight and touch, fashions a complete human soul. Rousseau, by means of a\r\ncontract, founds political association, and, with this given idea, pulls\r\ndown the constitution, government and laws of every balanced social\r\nsystem. In a book which serves as the philosophical testament of the\r\ncentury,[3242] Condorcet declares that this method is the \"final step of\r\nphilosophy, that which places a sort of eternal barrier between humanity\r\nand its ancient infantile errors.\" \"By applying it to morals, politics\r\nand political economy the moral sciences have progressed nearly as much\r\nas the natural sciences. With its help we have been able to discover\r\nthe rights of man.\" As in mathematics, they have been deduced from one\r\nprimordial statement only, which statement, similar to a first principle\r\nin mathematics, becomes a fact of daily experience, seen by all and\r\ntherefore self-evident.--This school of thought is to endure throughout\r\nthe Revolution, the Empire and even into the Restoration,[3243] together\r\nwith the tragedy of which it is the sister, with the classic spirit\r\ntheir common parent, a primordial, sovereign power, as dangerous as it\r\nis useful, as destructive as it is creative, as capable of propagating\r\nerror as truth, as astonishing in the rigidity of its code, the\r\nnarrow-mindedness of its yoke and in the uniformity of its works as in\r\nthe duration of its reign and the universality of its ascendancy.[3244]\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3201: Voltaire, \"Dict.

(SR.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. COMBINATION OF THE TWO ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Birth Of A Doctrine, A Revelation.\r\n\r\n     The doctrine, its pretensions, and its character.--A new\r\n     authority for Reason in the regulation of human affairs.--\r\n     Government thus far traditional.\r\n\r\nOUT of the scientific acquisitions thus set forth, elaborated by\r\nthe spirit we have just described, is born a doctrine, seemingly a\r\nrevelation, and which, under this title, was to claim the government of\r\nhuman affairs. On the approach of 1789 it is generally admitted that\r\nman is living in \"a century of light,\" in \"the age of Reason;\" that,\r\npreviously, the human species was in its infancy and that now it has\r\nattained to its \"majority.\" Truth, finally, is made manifest and, for\r\nthe first time, its reign on earth is apparent. The right is supreme\r\nbecause it is truth itself. It must direct all things because through\r\nits nature it is universal. The philosophy of the eighteenth century, in\r\nthese two articles of faith, resembles a religion, the Puritanism of the\r\nseventeenth century, and Islam in the seventh century. We see the same\r\noutburst of faith, hope and enthusiasm, the same spirit of propaganda\r\nand of dominion, the same rigidity and intolerance, the same ambition to\r\nrecast man and to remodel human life according to a preconceived type.\r\nThe new doctrine is also to have its scholars, its dogmas, its popular\r\ncatechism, its fanatics, its inquisitors and its martyrs. It is to speak\r\nas loudly as those preceding it, as a legitimate authority to which\r\ndictatorship belongs by right of birth, and against which rebellion is\r\ncriminal or insane. It differs, however, from the preceding religions\r\nin this respect, that instead of imposing itself in the name of God, it\r\nimposes itself in the name of Reason.\r\n\r\nThe authority, indeed, was a new one. Up to this time, in the control\r\nof human actions and opinions, Reason had played but a small and\r\nsubordinate part. Both the motive and its direction were obtained\r\nelsewhere; faith and obedience were an inheritance; a man was\r\na Christian and a subject because he was born Christian and\r\nsubject.--Surrounding the nascent philosophy and the Reason which\r\nenters upon its great investigation, is a system of recognized laws, an\r\nestablished power, a reigning religion; all the stones of this structure\r\nhold together and each story is supported by a preceding story. But\r\nwhat does the common cement consist of, and where is the basic\r\nfoundation?--Who sanctions all these civil regulations which control\r\nmarriages, testaments, inheritances, contracts, property and persons,\r\nthese fanciful and often contradictory regulations? In the first place\r\nimmemorial custom, varying according to the province, according to the\r\ntitle to the soil, according to the quality and condition of the person;\r\nand next, the will of the king who caused the custom to be inscribed and\r\nwho sanctioned it.--Who authorizes this will, this sovereignty of the\r\nprince, this first of public obligations? In the first place, eight\r\ncenturies of possession, a hereditary right similar to that by which\r\neach one enjoys his own field and domain, a property established in a\r\nfamily and transmitted from one eldest son to another, from the first\r\nfounder of the State to his last living successor; and, in addition to\r\nthis, a religion directing men to submit to the constituted powers.--And\r\nwho, finally, authorizes this religion? At first, eighteen centuries\r\nof tradition, the immense series of anterior and concordant proofs, the\r\nsteady belief of sixty preceding generations; and after this, at the\r\nbeginning of it, the presence and teachings of Christ, then, farther\r\nback, the creation of the world, the command and the voice of\r\nGod.--Thus, throughout the moral and social order of things the past\r\njustifies the present; antiquity provides its title, and if beneath all\r\nthese supports which age has consolidated, the deep primitive rock\r\nis sought for in subterranean depths, we find it in the divine\r\nwill.--During the whole of the seventeenth century this theory still\r\nabsorbs all souls in the shape of a fixed habit and of inward respect;\r\nit is not open to question. It is regarded in the same light as the\r\nheart of the living body; whoever would lay his hand upon it would\r\ninstantly draw back, moved by a vague sentiment of its ceasing to beat\r\nin case it were touched. The most independent, with Descartes at the\r\nhead, \"would be grieved\" at being confounded with those chimerical\r\nspeculators who, instead of pursuing the beaten track of custom, dart\r\nblindly forward \"in a direct line across mountains and over precipices.\"\r\nIn subjecting their belief to systematic investigation not only do they\r\nleave out and set apart \"the truths of faith,\"[3301] but again the dogma\r\nthey think they have thrown out remains in their mind latent and active,\r\nto guide them on unconsciously and to convert their philosophy into a\r\npreparation for, or a confirmation of, Christianity.[3302]--Summing it\r\nall up, faith, the performance of religious duties, with religious and\r\npolitical institutions, are at base of all thought of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Reason, whether she admits it or is ignorant of it, is only a\r\nsubaltern, an oratorical agency, a setter-in-motion, forced by religion\r\nand the monarchy to labor in their behalf. With the exception of La\r\nFontaine, whom I regard as unique in this as in other matters, the\r\ngreatest and most independent, Pascal, Descartes, Bossuet, La Bruyère,\r\nborrows from the established society their basic concepts of nature,\r\nman, society, law and government.[3303] So long as Reason is limited\r\nto this function its work is that of a councilor of State, an extra\r\npreacher dispatched by its superiors on a missionary tour in the\r\ndepartments of philosophy and of literature. Far from proving\r\ndestructive it consolidates; in fact, even down to the Regency, its\r\nchief employment is to produce good Christians and loyal subjects.\r\n\r\nBut now the roles are reversed; tradition descends from the upper to the\r\nlower ranks, while Reason ascends from the latter to the former.--On\r\nthe one hand religion and monarchy, through their excesses and misdeeds\r\nunder Louis XIV, and their laxity and incompetence under Louis XV,\r\ndemolish piece by piece the basis of hereditary reverence and filial\r\nobedience so long serving them as a foundation, and which maintained\r\nthem aloft above all dispute and free of investigation; hence the\r\nauthority of tradition insensibly declines and disappears. On the other\r\nhand science, through its imposing and multiplied discoveries, erects\r\npiece by piece a basis of universal trust and deference, raising itself\r\nup from an interesting subject of curiosity to the rank of a public\r\npower; hence the authority of Reason augments and occupies its place.--A\r\ntime comes when, the latter authority having dispossessed the former,\r\nthe fundamental ideas tradition had reserved to itself fall into the\r\ngrasp of Reason. Investigation penetrates into the forbidden sanctuary.\r\nInstead of deference there is verification, and religion, the state,\r\nthe law, custom, all the organs, in short, of moral and practical life,\r\nbecome subject to analysis, to be preserved, restored or replaced,\r\naccording to the prescriptions of the new doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Ancestral Tradition And Culture.\r\n\r\n     Origin, nature and value of hereditary prejudice.--How far\r\n     custom, religion and government are legitimate.\r\n\r\nNothing could be better had the new doctrine been complete, and if\r\nReason, instructed by history, had become critical, and therefore\r\nqualified to comprehend the rival she replaced. For then, instead of\r\nregarding her as an usurper to be repelled she would have recognized in\r\nher an elder sister whose part must be left to her. Hereditary prejudice\r\nis a sort of Reason operating unconsciously. It has claims as well as\r\nreason, but it is unable to present these; instead of advancing those\r\nthat are authentic it puts forth the doubtful ones. Its archives are\r\nburied; to exhume these it is necessary to make researches of which it\r\nis incapable; nevertheless they exist, and history at the present day\r\nis bringing them to light.--Careful investigations shows that, like\r\nscience, it issues from a long accumulation of experiences; a people,\r\nafter a multitude of gropings and efforts, has discovered that a certain\r\nway of living and thinking is the only one adapted to its situation, the\r\nmost practical and the most salutary, the system or dogma now seeming\r\narbitrary to us being at first a confirmed expedient of public safety.\r\nFrequently it is so still; in any event, in its leading features it\r\nis indispensable; it may be stated with certainty that, if the leading\r\nprejudices of the community should suddenly disappear, Man, deprived of\r\nthe precious legacy transmitted to him by the wisdom of ages, would at\r\nonce fall back into a savage condition and again become what he was at\r\nfirst, namely, a restless, famished, wandering, hunted brute. There was\r\na time when this heritage was lacking; there are populations to day with\r\nwhich it is still utterly lacking.[3304] To abstain from eating human\r\nflesh, from killing useless or burdensome aged people, from exposing,\r\nselling or killing children one does not know what to do with, to be\r\nthe one husband of but one woman, to hold in horror incest and unnatural\r\npractices, to be the sole and recognized owner of a distinct field, to\r\nbe mindful of the superior injunctions of modesty, humanity, honor\r\nand conscience, all these observances, formerly unknown and slowly\r\nestablished, compose the civilization of human beings. Because we accept\r\nthem in full security they are not the less sacred, and they become\r\nonly the more sacred when, submitted to investigation and traced\r\nthrough history, they are disclosed to us as the secret force which has\r\nconverted a herd of brutes into a society of men. In general, the older\r\nand more universal a custom, the more it is based on profound motives,\r\non physiological motives on those of hygiene, and on those instituted\r\nfor social protection. At one time, as in the separation of castes, a\r\nheroic or thoughtful stock must be preserved by preventing the\r\nmixtures by which inferior blood introduces mental debility and low\r\ninstincts.[3305] At another, as in the prohibition of spirituous\r\nliquors, and of animal food, it is necessary to conform to the climate\r\nprescribing a vegetable diet, or to the race-temperament for which\r\nstrong drink is pernicious.[3306]At another, as in the institution of\r\nthe right of first-born to inherit title and castle, it was important\r\nto prepare and designate beforehand the military commander who the\r\ntribe would obey, or the civil chieftain that would preserve the domain,\r\nsuperintend its cultivation, and support the family.[3307]--If there are\r\nvalid reasons for legitimizing custom there are reasons of higher import\r\nfor the consecration of religion Consider this point, not in general\r\nand according to a vague notion, but at the outset, at its birth, in\r\nthe texts, taking for an example one of the faiths which now rule in\r\nsociety, Christianity, Hinduism, the law of Mohammed or of Buddha. At\r\ncertain critical moments in history, a few men, emerging from their\r\nnarrow and daily routine of life, are seized by some generalized\r\nconception of the infinite universe; the august face of nature is\r\nsuddenly unveiled to them; in their sublime emotion they seem to have\r\ndetected its first cause; they have at least detected some of its\r\nelements. Through a fortunate conjunction of circumstances these\r\nelements are just those which their century, their people, a group of\r\npeoples, a fragment of humanity is in a state to comprehend. Their point\r\nof view is the only one at which the graduated multitudes below them are\r\nable to accept. For millions of men, for hundreds of generations, only\r\nthrough them is any access to divine things to be obtained. Theirs\r\nis the unique utterance, heroic or affecting, enthusiastic or\r\ntranquilizing; the only one which the hearts and minds around them and\r\nafter them will heed; the only one adapted to profound cravings,\r\nto accumulated aspirations, to hereditary faculties, to a complete\r\nintellectual and moral organism; Yonder that of Hindostan or of the\r\nMongolian; here that of the Semite or the European; in our Europe\r\nthat of the German, the Latin or the Slave; in such a way that its\r\ncontradictions, instead of condemning it, justify it, its diversity\r\nproducing its adaptation and its adaptation producing benefits.--This is\r\nno barren formula. A sentiment of such grandeur, of such comprehensive\r\nand penetrating insight, an idea by which Man, compassing the vastness\r\nand depth of things, so greatly oversteps the ordinary limits of his\r\nmortal condition, resembles an illumination; it is easily transformed\r\ninto a vision; it is never remote from ecstasy; it can express itself\r\nonly through symbols; it evokes divine figures.[3308]Religion in its\r\nnature is a metaphysical poem accompanied by faith. Under this title it\r\nis popular and efficacious; for, apart from an invisible select few,\r\na pure abstract idea is only an empty term, and truth, to be apparent,\r\nmust be clothed with a body. It requires a form of worship, a legend,\r\nand ceremonies in order to address the people, women, children, the\r\ncredulous, every one absorbed by daily cares, any understanding in which\r\nideas involuntarily translate themselves through imagery. Owing to this\r\npalpable form it is able to give its weighty support to the conscience,\r\nto counterbalance natural egoism, to curb the mad onset of brutal\r\npassions, to lead the will to abnegation and devotion, to tear Man away\r\nfrom himself and place him wholly in the service of truth, or of his\r\nkind, to form ascetics, martyrs, sisters of charity and missionaries.\r\nThus, throughout society, religion becomes at once a natural and\r\nprecious instrumentality. On the one hand men require it for the\r\ncontemplation of infinity and to live properly; if it were suddenly to\r\nbe taken away from them their souls would be a mournful void, and they\r\nwould do greater injury to their neighbors. Besides, it would be vain\r\nto attempt to take it away from them; the hand raised against it would\r\nencounter only its envelope; it would be repelled after a sanguinary\r\nstruggle, its germ lying too deep to be extirpated.\r\n\r\nAnd when, at length, after religion and custom, we regard the State,\r\nthat is to say, the armed power possessing both physical force and moral\r\nauthority, we find for it an almost equally noble origin. It has, in\r\nEurope at least, from Russia to Portugal and from Norway to the two\r\nSicilies, in its origin and essence, a military foundation in which\r\nheroism constitutes itself the champion of right. Here and there in\r\nthe chaos of tribes and crumbling societies, some man has arisen who,\r\nthrough his ascendancy, rallies around him a loyal band, driving\r\nout intruders, overcoming brigands, re-establishing order, reviving\r\nagriculture, founding a patrimony, and transmitting as property to\r\nhis descendants his office of hereditary justiciary and born general.\r\nThrough this permanent delegation a great public office is removed from\r\ncompetition, fixed in one family, sequestered in safe hands; thenceforth\r\nthe nation possesses a vital center and each right obtains a visible\r\nprotector. If the sovereign confines himself to his traditional\r\nresponsibilities, is restrained in despotic tendencies, and avoids\r\nfalling into egoism, he provides the country with the best government\r\nof which the world has any knowledge. Not alone is it the most stable,\r\ncapable of continuation, and the most suitable for maintaining together\r\na body of 20 or 30 million people, but again one of the most noble\r\nbecause devotion dignifies both command and obedience and, through the\r\nprolongation of military tradition, fidelity and honor, from grade\r\nto grade, attaches the leader to his duty and the soldier to his\r\ncommander.--Such are the strikingly valid claims of social traditions\r\nwhich we may, similar to an instinct, consider as being a blind form of\r\nreason. That which makes it fully legitimate is that reason herself,\r\nto become efficient, is obliged to borrow its form. A doctrine becomes\r\ninspiring only through a blind medium. To become of practical use,\r\nto take upon itself the government of souls, to be transformed into a\r\nspring of action, it must be deposited in minds given up to systematic\r\nbelief, of fixed habits, of established tendencies, of domestic\r\ntraditions and prejudice, and that it, from the agitated heights of the\r\nintellect, descends into and become amalgamated with the passive forces\r\nof the will; then only does it form a part of the character and become\r\na social force. At the same time, however, it ceases to be critical and\r\nclairvoyant; it no longer tolerates doubt and contradiction, nor admits\r\nfurther restrictions or nice distinctions; it is either no longer\r\ncognizant of, or badly appreciates, its own evidences. We of the present\r\nday believe in infinite progress about the same as people once believed\r\nin original sin; we still receive ready-made opinions from above, the\r\nAcademy of Sciences occupying in many respects the place of the ancient\r\ncouncils. Except with a few special savants, belief and obedience\r\nwill always be unthinking, while Reason would wrongfully resent the\r\nleadership of prejudice in human affairs, since, to lead, it must itself\r\nbecome prejudiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Reason At War With Illusion.\r\n\r\n     The classic intellect incapable of accepting this point of\r\n     view.--The past and present usefulness of tradition are\r\n     misunderstood.--Reason undertakes to set them aside.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the eighteenth century, reason was classic; not only\r\nthe aptitude but the documents which enable it to comprehend tradition\r\nwere absent. In the first place, there was no knowledge of history;\r\nlearning was, due to its dullness and tediousness, refused; learned\r\ncompilations, vast collections of extracts and the slow work of\r\ncriticism were held in disdain. Voltaire made fun of the Benedictines.\r\nMontesquieu, to ensure the acceptance of his \"Esprit des lois,\" indulged\r\nin wit about laws. Reynal, to give an impetus to his history of commerce\r\nin the Indies, welded to it the declamation of Diderot. The Abbé\r\nBarthélemy covered over the realities of Greek manners and customs with\r\nhis literary varnish. Science was expected to be either epigrammatic or\r\noratorical; crude or technical details would have been objectionable to\r\na public composed of people of the good society; correctness of style\r\ntherefore drove out or falsified those small significant facts\r\nwhich give a peculiar sense and their original relief to ancient\r\npersonalities.--Even if writers had dared to note them, their sense and\r\nbearing would not have been understood. The sympathetic imagination did\r\nnot exist[3309]; people were incapable of going out of themselves,\r\nof betaking themselves to distant points of view, of conjecturing\r\nthe peculiar and violent states of the human brain, the decisive and\r\nfruitful moment during which it gives birth to a vigorous creation,\r\na religion destined to rule, a state that is sure to endure. The\r\nimagination of Man is limited to personal experiences, and where in\r\ntheir experience, could individuals in this society have found the\r\nmaterial which would have allowed them to imagine the convulsions of a\r\ndelivery? How could minds, as polished and as amiable as these, fully\r\nadopt the sentiments of an apostle, of a monk, of a barbarian or feudal\r\nfounder; see these in the milieu which explains and justifies them;\r\npicture to themselves the surrounding crowd, at first souls in despair\r\nand haunted by mystic dreams, and next the rude and violent intellects\r\ngiven up to instinct and imagery, thinking with half-visions, their\r\nresolve consisting of irresistible impulses? A speculative reasoning of\r\nthis stamp could not imagine figures like these. To bring them within\r\nits rectilinear limits they require to be reduced and made over; the\r\nMacbeth of Shakespeare becomes that of Ducis, and the Mahomet of the\r\nKoran that of Voltaire. Consequently, as they failed to see souls, they\r\nmisconceived institutions. The suspicion that truth could have been\r\nconveyed only through the medium of legends, that justice could have\r\nbeen established only by force, that religion was obliged to assume the\r\nsacerdotal form, that the State necessarily took a military form, and\r\nthat the Gothic edifice possessed, as well as other structures, its own\r\narchitecture, proportions, balance of parts, solidity, and even beauty,\r\nnever entered their heads.--Furthermore, unable to comprehend the past,\r\nthey could not comprehend the present. They knew nothing about the\r\nmechanic, the provincial bourgeois, or even the lesser nobility; these\r\nwere seen only far away in the distance, half-effaced, and wholly\r\ntransformed through philosophic theories and sentimental haze. \"Two or\r\nthree thousand\"[3310] polished and cultivated individuals formed the\r\ncircle of ladies and gentlemen, the so-called honest folks, and they\r\nnever went outside of their own circle. If they fleeting had a glimpse\r\nof the people from their chateaux and on their journeys, it was in\r\npassing, the same as of their post-horses, or of the cattle on their\r\nfarms, showing compassion undoubtedly, but never divining their anxious\r\nthoughts and their obscure instincts. The structure of the still\r\nprimitive mind of the people was never imagined, the paucity and\r\ntenacity of their ideas, the narrowness of their mechanical, routine\r\nexistence, devoted to manual labor, absorbed with the anxieties\r\nfor daily bread, confined to the bounds of a visible horizon;\r\ntheir attachment to the local saint, to rites, to the priest, their\r\ndeep-seated rancor, their inveterate distrust, their credulity growing\r\nout of the imagination, their inability to comprehend abstract rights,\r\nthe law and public affairs, the hidden operation by which their brains\r\nwould transform political novelties into nursery fables or into ghost\r\nstories, their contagious infatuations like those of sheep, their\r\nblind fury like that of bulls, and all those traits of character the\r\nRevolution was about to bring to light. Twenty millions of men and more\r\nhad scarcely passed out of the mental condition of the middle ages;\r\nhence, in its grand lines, the social edifice in which they could dwell\r\nhad necessarily to be mediaeval. It had to be cleaned up, windows put\r\nin and walls pulled down, but without disturbing the foundations, or the\r\nmain building and its general arrangement; otherwise after demolishing\r\nit and living encamped for ten years in the open air like savages,\r\nits inmates would have been obliged to rebuild it on the same plan. In\r\nuneducated minds, those having not yet attained to reflection, faith\r\nattaches itself only to the corporeal symbol, obedience being brought\r\nabout only through physical restraint; religion is upheld by the priest\r\nand the State by the policeman.--One writer only, Montesquieu, the best\r\ninstructed, the most sagacious, and the best balanced of all the spirits\r\nof the age, made these truths apparent, because he was at once an\r\nerudite, an observer, a historian and a jurisconsult. He spoke, however,\r\nas an oracle, in maxims and riddles; and every time he touched matters\r\nbelonging to his country and epoch he hopped about as if upon red\r\nhot coals. That is why he remained respected but isolated, his fame\r\nexercising no influence. The classic reason refused[3311] to go so far\r\nas to make a careful study of both the ancient and the contemporary\r\nhuman being. It found it easier and more convenient to follow its\r\noriginal bent, to shut its eyes on man as he is, to fall back on its\r\nstores of current notions, to derive from these an idea of man in\r\ngeneral, and build in empty space.--Through this natural and complete\r\nstate of blindness it no longer heeds the old and living roots of\r\ncontemporary institutions; no longer seeing them makes it deny their\r\nexistence. Custom now appears as pure prejudice; the titles of tradition\r\nare lost, and royalty seems based on robbery. So from now on Reason is\r\narmed and at war with its predecessor to wrench away its control over\r\nthe minds and to replace a rule of lies with a rule of truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Casting Out The Residue Of Truth And Justice.\r\n\r\n     Two stages in this operation.--Voltaire, Montesquieu, the\r\n     deists and the reformers represent the first one.--What they\r\n     destroy and what they respect.\r\n\r\nIn this great undertaking there are two stages. Owing to common sense or\r\ntimidity many stop half-way. Motivated by passion or logic others go to\r\nthe end.--A first campaign results in carrying the enemy's out-works and\r\nhis frontier fortresses, the philosophical army being led by Voltaire.\r\nTo combat hereditary prejudice, other prejudices are opposed to it\r\nwhose empire is as extensive and whose authority is not less recognized.\r\nMontesquieu looks at France through the eyes of a Persian, and Voltaire,\r\non his return from England, describes the English, an unknown species.\r\nConfronting dogma and the prevailing system of worship, accounts\r\nare given, either with open or with disguised irony, of the various\r\nChristian sects, the Anglicans, the Quakers, the Presbyterians, the\r\nSocinians, those of ancient or of remote people, the Greeks, Romans,\r\nEgyptians, Muslims, and Guebers, of the worshippers of Brahma, of the\r\nChinese and of pure idolaters. In relation to established laws and\r\ncustoms, expositions are made, with evident intentions, of other\r\nconstitutions and other social habits, of despotism, of limited\r\nmonarchy, of a republic, here the church subject to the state, there the\r\nchurch free of the state, in this country castes, in another polygamy,\r\nand, from country to country, from century to century, the diversity,\r\ncontradiction and antagonism of fundamental customs which, each on its\r\nown ground, are all equally consecrated by tradition, all legitimately\r\nforming the system of public rights. From now on the charm is broken.\r\nAncient institutions lose their divine prestige; they are simply human\r\nworks, the fruits of the place and of the moment, and born out of\r\nconvenience and a covenant. Skepticism enters through all the breaches.\r\nWith regard to Christianity it at once enters into open hostility, into\r\na bitter and prolonged polemical warfare; for, under the title of a\r\nstate religion this occupies the ground, censuring free thought, burning\r\nwritings, exiling, imprisoning or disturbing authors, and everywhere\r\nacting as a natural and official adversary. Moreover, by virtue of being\r\nan ascetic religion, it condemns not only the free and cheerful ways\r\ntolerated by the new philosophy but again the natural tendencies it\r\nsanctions, and the promises of terrestrial felicity with which it\r\neverywhere dazzles the eyes. Thus the heart and the head both agree in\r\ntheir opposition.--Voltaire, with texts in hand, pursues it from one end\r\nto the other of its history, from the first biblical narration to the\r\nlatest papal bulls, with unflagging animosity and energy, as critic,\r\nas historian, as geographer, as logician, as moralist, questioning its\r\nsources, opposing evidences, driving ridicule like a pick-ax into every\r\nweak spot where an outraged instinct beats against its mystic walls,\r\nand into all doubtful places where ulterior patchwork disfigures the\r\nprimitive structure.--He respects, however, the first foundation, and,\r\nin this particular, the greatest writers of the day follow the same\r\ncourse. Under positive religions that are false there is a natural\r\nreligion that is true. This is the simple and authentic text of which\r\nthe others are altered and amplified translations. Remove the ulterior\r\nand divergent excesses and the original remains; this common essence, on\r\nwhich all copies harmonize, is deism.--The same operation is to be\r\nmade on civil and political law. In France, where so many survive their\r\nutility, where privileges are no longer paid for with service, where\r\nrights are changed into abuses, how incoherent is the architecture of\r\nthe old Gothic building! How poorly adapted to a modern nation! Of\r\nwhat use, in an unique and compact state, are those feudal compartments\r\nseparating orders, corporations and provinces? What a living paradox\r\nis the archbishop of a semi-province, a chapter owning 12,000 serfs,\r\na drawing room abbé well supported by a monastery he never saw, a lord\r\nliberally pensioned to figure in antechambers, a magistrate purchasing\r\nthe right to administer justice, a colonel leaving college to take the\r\ncommand of his inherited regiment, a Parisian trader who, renting a\r\nhouse for one year in Franche-Comté, alienates through this act alone\r\nthe ownership of his property and of his person. Throughout Europe\r\nthere are others of the same character. The best that can be said of\r\n\"a civilized nation\" [3312] is that its laws, customs and practices are\r\ncomposed \"one-half of abuses and one-half of tolerable usage\".--But,\r\nunderneath these concrete laws, which contradict each other, and of\r\nwhich each contradicts itself, a natural law exists, implied in the\r\ncodes, applied socially, and written in all hearts.\r\n\r\n\"Show me a country where it is honest to steal the fruits of my labor,\r\nto violate engagements, to lie for injurious purposes, to calumniate, to\r\nassassinate, to poison, to be ungrateful to one's benefactor, to strike\r\none's father and mother on offering you food\".--\"Justice and injustice\r\nis the same throughout the universe,\" and, as in the worst community\r\nforce always, in some respects, is at the service of right, so, in the\r\nworst religion, the extravagant dogma always in some fashion proclaims\r\na supreme architect.--Religions and communities, accordingly,\r\ndisintegrated under the investigating process, disclose at the bottom\r\nof the crucible, some residue of truth, others a residue of justice, a\r\nsmall but precious balance, a sort of gold ingot of preserved tradition,\r\npurified by Reason, and which little by little, freed from its alloys,\r\nelaborated and devoted to all usage, must solely provide the substance\r\nof religion and all threads of the social warp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The Dream Of A Return To Nature.\r\n\r\n     The second stage, a return to nature.--Diderot, d'Holbach\r\n     and the materialists.--Theory of animated matter and\r\n     spontaneous organization.--The moral of animal instinct and\r\n     self-interest properly understood.\r\n\r\nHere begins the second philosophic expedition. It consists of two\r\narmies: the first composed of the encyclopedists, some of them skeptics\r\nlike d'Alembert, others pantheists like Diderot and Lamarck, the second\r\nopen atheists and materialists like d'Holbach, Lamettrie and Helvétius,\r\nand later Condorcet, Lalande and Volney, all different and independent\r\nof each other, but unanimous in regarding tradition as the common enemy.\r\nAs a result of prolonged hostilities the parties become increasingly\r\nexasperated and feel a desire to be master of everything, to push the\r\nadversary to the wall, to drive him out of all his positions. They\r\nrefuse to admit that Reason and tradition can occupy and defend the\r\nsame citadel together; as soon as one enters the other must depart;\r\nhenceforth one prejudice is established against another prejudice.--In\r\nfact, Voltaire, \"the patriarch, does not desire to abandon his redeeming\r\nand avenging God;\"[3313] let us tolerate in him this remnant of\r\nsuperstition on account of his great services; let us nevertheless\r\nexamine this phantom in man which he regards with infantile vision. We\r\nadmit it into our minds through faith, and faith is always suspicious.\r\nIt is forged by ignorance, fear, and imagination, which are all\r\ndeceptive powers. At first it was simply the fetish of savages; in\r\nvain have we striven to purify and aggrandize it; its origin is always\r\napparent; its history is that of a hereditary dream which, arising in\r\na rude and doting brain, prolongs itself from generation to generation,\r\nand still lasts in the healthy and cultivated brain. Voltaire wanted\r\nthat this dream should be true because, otherwise, he could not explain\r\nthe admirable order of the world. Since a watch suggests a watchmaker\r\nhe had firstly to prove that the world is a watch and, then see if the\r\nhalf-finished arrangement, such as it is and which we have observed,\r\ncould not better be explained by a simpler theory, more in conformity\r\nwith experience, that of eternal matter in which motion is eternal.\r\nMobile and active particles, of which the different kinds are in\r\ndifferent states of equilibrium, these are minerals, inorganic\r\nsubstances, marble, lime, air, water and coal.[3314] I form humus out of\r\nthis, \"I sow peas, beans and cabbages;\" plants find their nourishment\r\nin the humus, and \"I find my nourishment in the plants.\" At every meal,\r\nwithin me, and through me, inanimate matter becomes animate; \"I convert\r\nit into flesh. I animalize it. I render it sensitive.\" It harbors\r\nlatent, imperfect sensibility rendered perfect and made manifest.\r\nOrganization is the cause, and life and sensation are the effects; I\r\nneed no spiritual monad to account for effects since I am in possession\r\nof the cause. \"Look at this egg, with which all schools of theology and\r\nall the temples of the earth can be overthrown. What is this egg? An\r\ninanimate mass previous to the introduction of the germ. And what is it\r\nafter the introduction of the germ? An insensible mass, an inert fluid.\"\r\nAdd heat to it, keep it in an oven, and let the operation continue\r\nof itself, and we have a chicken, that is to say, \"sensibility, life,\r\nmemory, conscience, passions and thought.\" That which you call soul\r\nis the nervous center in which all sensitive chords concentrate. Their\r\nvibrations produce sensations; a quickened or reviving sensation is\r\nmemory; our ideas are the result of sensations, memory and signs.\r\nMatter, accordingly, is not the work of an intelligence, but matter,\r\nthrough its own arrangement, produces intelligence. Let us fix\r\nintelligence where it is, in the organized body; we must not detach it\r\nfrom its support to perch it in the sky on an imaginary throne. This\r\ndisproportionate conception, once introduced into our minds, ends in\r\nperverting the natural play of our sentiments, and, like a monstrous\r\nparasite, abstracts for itself all our substance.[3315] The first\r\ninterest of a sane person is to get rid of it, to discard every\r\nsuperstition, every \"fear of invisible powers.\"[3316]--Then only can he\r\nestablish a moral order of things and distinguish \"the natural law.\" The\r\nsky consisting of empty space, we have no need to seek commands from on\r\nhigh. Let us look down to the ground; let us consider man in himself, as\r\nhe appears in the eyes of the naturalist, namely, an organized body, a\r\nsensitive animal possessing wants, appetites and instincts. Not only\r\nare these indestructible but they are legitimate. Let us throw open the\r\nprison in which prejudice confines them; let us give them free air and\r\nspace; let them be displayed in all their strength and all will go well.\r\nAccording to Diderot,[3317] a lasting marriage is an abuse, being\r\n\"the tyranny of a man who has converted the possession of a woman into\r\nproperty.\" Purity is an invention and conventional, like a dress;[3318]\r\nhappiness and morals go together only in countries where instinct is\r\nsanctioned; as in Tahiti, for instance, where marriage lasts but a\r\nmonth, often only a day, and sometimes a quarter of an hour, where, in\r\nthe evening and with hospitable intent, a host offers his daughters and\r\nwife to his guests, where the son espouses his mother out of politeness,\r\nwhere the union of the sexes is a religious festivity celebrated in\r\npublic.--And, pushing things to extremes, the logician ends with five\r\nor six pages calculated \"to make one's hair stand on end,\"[3319] himself\r\navowing that his doctrine is \"neither suited for children nor for\r\nadults.\"--With Diderot, to say the least, these paradoxes have their\r\ncorrectives. In his pictures of modern ways and habits, he is the\r\nmoralist. He not only is familiar with all the chords of the human\r\nkeyboard, but he classifies each according to its rank. He loves fine\r\nand pure tones, and is full of enthusiasm for noble harmonies; his\r\nheart is equal to his genius.[3320] And better still, on the question\r\nof primitive impulses arising, he assigns, side by side with vanity,\r\nan independent and superior position to pity, friendship, kindness and\r\ncharity; to every generous affection of the heart displaying sacrifice\r\nand devotion without calculation or personal benefit.--But associated\r\nwith him are others, cold and narrow, who form moral systems according\r\nto the mathematical methods of the ideologists, [3321] after the style\r\nof Hobbes. One motive alone satisfies these, the simplest and most\r\npalpable, utterly gross, almost mechanical, completely physiological,\r\nthe natural animal tendency of avoiding pain and seeking pleasure:\r\n\r\n\"Pain and pleasure,\" says Helvétius, \"form the only springs of the moral\r\nuniverse, while the sentiment of vanity is the only basis on which we\r\ncan lay the foundations of moral usefulness. What motive but that of\r\nself-interest could lead a man to perform a generous action? He can as\r\nlittle love good for the sake of good as evil for the sake of\r\nevil.\"[3322] \"The principles of natural law, say the disciples, are\r\nreduced to one unique and fundamental principle,\r\nself-preservation.\"[3323] \"To preserve oneself, to be happy,\" is instinct,\r\nright and duty. \"Oh, yea,\"[3324] says nature, \"who, through the\r\nimpulsion I bestow on you, tending towards happiness at every moment of\r\nyour being, resist not my sovereign law, strive for your own felicity,\r\nenjoy fearlessly and be happy!\" But to be happy, contribute to the\r\nhappiness of others; if you wish them to be useful to you, be useful to\r\nthem. \"every man, from birth to death, has need of mankind.\" \"Live then\r\nfor them, that they may live for you.\" \"Be good, because goodness links\r\nhearts together; be gentle, because gentleness wins affection; be\r\nmodest, because pride repels beings full of their self-importance. . . .\r\nBe citizens, because your country is necessary to ensure your safety and\r\nwell-being. Defend your country, because it renders you happy and\r\ncontains your possessions.\"\r\n\r\nVirtue thus is simply egotism furnished with a telescope; man has no\r\nother reason for doing good but the fear of doing himself harm, while\r\nself-devotion consists of self-interest.\r\n\r\nOne goes fast and far on this road. When the sole law for each person\r\nis to be happy, each wishes to be so immediately and in his own way;\r\nthe herd of appetites is let loose, rushing ahead and breaking down all\r\nbarriers. And the more readily because it has been demonstrated to\r\nthem that every barrier is an evil, invented by cunning and malicious\r\nshepherds, the better to milk and shear them:\r\n\r\n\"The state of society is a state of warfare of the sovereign against\r\nall, and of each member against the rest.[3325]. . We see on the face\r\nof the globe only incapable, unjust sovereigns, enervated by luxury,\r\ncorrupted by flattery, depraved through unpunished license, and without\r\ntalent, morals, or good qualities. . . . Man is wicked not because he is\r\nwicked, but because he has been made so.\"-\"Would you know the story,\r\nin brief, of almost all our wretchedness? Here it is. There existed\r\nthe natural man, and into this man was introduced an artificial man,\r\nwhereupon a civil war arose within him, lasting through life. [3326]. .\r\nIf you propose to become a tyrant over him,. . . do your best to poison\r\nhim with a theory of morals against nature; impose every kind of\r\nfetter on him; embarrass his movements with a thousand obstacles; place\r\nphantoms around him to frighten him. . . . Would you see him happy and\r\nfree? Do not meddle with his affairs. . . Remain convinced of this,\r\n(wrote Diderot) that these wise legislators have formed and shaped you\r\nas they have done, not for your benefit, but for their own. I appeal\r\nto every civil, religious, and political institution; examine these\r\nclosely, and, if I am not mistaken, you will find the human species,\r\ncentury after century, subject to a yoke which a mere handful of knaves\r\nchose to impose on it.... Be wary of him who seeks to establish order;\r\nto order is to obtain the mastery of others by giving them trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThere nothing any more to be ashamed of; the passions are good, and if\r\nthe herd would eat freely, its first care must be to trample under its\r\nwooden shoes the mitered and crowned animals who keep it in the fold for\r\ntheir own advantage.[3327]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The Abolition Of Society. Rousseau.\r\n\r\n     Rousseau and the spiritualists.--The original goodness of\r\n     man.--The mistake committed by civilization.--The injustice\r\n     of property and of society.\r\n\r\nA return to nature, meaning by this the abolition of society, is the\r\nwar-cry of the whole encyclopedic battalion. The same shout is heard\r\nin another quarter, coming the battalion of Rousseau and the socialists\r\nwho, in their turn, march up to the assault of the established régime.\r\nThe mining and the sapping of the walls practiced by the latter seems\r\nless extensive, but are nevertheless more effective, and the destructive\r\nmachinery it employs consists of a new conception of human nature. This\r\nRousseau has drawn exclusively from the spectacle in his own heart:\r\n[3328] Rousseau, a strange, original and superior man, who, from his\r\ninfancy, harbored within him a germ of insanity, and who finally became\r\nwholly insane; a wonderful, ill-balanced mind in which sensations,\r\nemotions and images are too powerful: at once blind and perspicacious,\r\na veritable poet and a morbid poet, who, instead of things and events\r\nbeheld reveries, living in a romance and dying in a nightmare of his own\r\ncreation; incapable of controlling and of behaving himself, confounding\r\nresolution with action, vague desire with resolution, and the role\r\nhe assumed with the character he thought he possessed; wholly\r\ndisproportionate to the ordinary ways of society, hitting, wounding\r\nand soiling himself against every hindrance on his way; at times\r\nextravagant, mean and criminal, yet preserving up to the end a delicate\r\nand profound sensibility, a humanity, pity, the gift of tears, the\r\nfaculty of living, the passion for justice, the sentiment of religion\r\nand of enthusiasm, like so many vigorous roots in which generous sap is\r\nalways fermenting, whilst the stem and the branches prove abortive and\r\nbecome deformed or wither under the inclemency of the atmosphere. How\r\nexplain such a contrast? How did Rousseau himself account for it? A\r\ncritic, a psychologist would merely regard him as a singular case, the\r\neffect of an extraordinarily discordant mental formation, analogous to\r\nthat of Hamlet, Chatterton, René or Werther, adopted to poetic spheres,\r\nbut unsuitable for real life. Rousseau generalizes; occupied with\r\nhimself, even to infatuation, and, seeing only himself, he imagines\r\nmankind to be like himself, and \"describes it as the feels it inside\r\nhimself\". His pride, moreover, finds this profitable; he is gratified at\r\nconsidering himself the prototype of humanity; the statue he erects of\r\nhimself becomes more important; he rises in his own estimation when,\r\nin confessing to himself, he thinks he is confessing the human species.\r\nRousseau convokes the assembly of generations with the trumpet of the\r\nday of judgment, and boldly stands up in the eyes of all men and of the\r\nSupreme Judge, exclaiming, \"Let anyone say, if he dares: 'I was a better\r\nman than Thou!'\"[3329] All his blemishes must be the fault of society;\r\nhis vices and his baseness must be attributed to circumstances:\r\n\r\n\"If I had fallen into the hands of a better master....I should have been\r\na good Christian, a good father, a good friend, a good workman, a good\r\nman in all things.\"\r\n\r\nThe wrong is thus all on the side of society.--In the same way, with Man\r\nin general, his nature is good.\r\n\r\n\"His first impulses are always right..... The fundamental principle of\r\nall moral questions which I have argued in all my writings, is that\r\nMan is naturally good, and loving justice and order..... 'Emile,'\r\nespecially, is a treatise on the natural goodness of Man, intended to\r\nshow how vice and error, foreign to his constitution, gradually find\r\ntheir way into it from without and insensibly change him.....Nature\r\ncreated Man happy and good, while society has depraved him and made him\r\nmiserable.\"[3330]\r\n\r\nImagine him divested of his factitious habits, of his superadded\r\nnecessities, of his false prejudices; put aside systems, study your own\r\nheart, listen to the inward dictates of feeling, let yourself be guided\r\nby the light of instinct and of conscience, and you will again find the\r\nfirst Adam, like an incorruptible marble statue that has fallen into\r\na marsh, a long time lost under a crust of slime and mud, but which,\r\nreleased from its foul covering, may be replaced on its pedestal in the\r\ncompleteness of its form and in the perfect purity of its whiteness.\r\n\r\nAround this central idea a reform occurs in the spiritualistic\r\ndoctrine.--A being so noble cannot possibly consist of a simple\r\ncollection of organs; he is something more than mere matter; the\r\nimpression he derives from his senses do not constitute his full being.\r\n\r\n\"I am not merely a sensitive and passive being, but an active and\r\nintelligent being, and, whatever philosophy may say, I dare claim the\r\nhonor of thinking.\"\r\n\r\nAnd better still, this thinking principle, in Man, at least, is of a\r\nsuperior kind.\r\n\r\n\"Show me another animal on the globe capable of producing fire and of\r\nadmiring the sun. What? I who am able to observe, to comprehend beings\r\nand their associations; who can appreciate order, beauty and virtue; who\r\ncan contemplate the universe and exalt myself to the hand which controls\r\nit; who can love the good and do good, should I compare myself to\r\nbrutes!\" Man is free, capable of deciding between two actions, and\r\ntherefore the creator of his actions; he is accordingly a first and\r\noriginal cause, \"an immaterial substance,\" distinct from the body, a\r\nsoul hampered by the body and which may survive the body.--This immortal\r\nsoul imprisoned within the flesh has conscience for its organ. \"O\r\nConscience, divine instinct, immortal and celestial voice, unfailing\r\nguide of an ignorant and finite but free and intelligent being,\r\ninfallible judge between good and evil, and rendering Man similar to\r\nGod, Thou foremost the superiority of his nature!\"\r\n\r\nAlongside of vanity, by which we subordinate everything to ourselves,\r\nthere is a love of order by which we subordinate ourselves to the whole.\r\nAlongside of egoism, by which Man seeks happiness even at the expense of\r\nothers, is sympathy, by which he seeks the happiness of others even\r\nat the expense of his own. Personal enjoyment does not suffice him;\r\nhe still needs tranquillity of conscience and the effusions of the\r\nheart.--Such is Man as God designed and created him; in his organization\r\nthere is no defect. Inferior elements are as serviceable as the superior\r\nelements; all are essential, proportionate, in proper place, not only\r\nthe heart, the conscience, the intellect, and the faculties by which we\r\nsurpass brutes, but again the inclinations in common with animals, the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation and of self-defense, the need of physical\r\nactivity, sexual appetite, and other primitive impulses as we observe\r\nthem in the child, the savage and the uncultivated Man.[3331] None\r\nof these in themselves are either vicious or injurious. None are too\r\nstrong, even the love of self. None come into play out of season. If we\r\nwould not interfere with them, if we would impose no constraint on them,\r\nif we would permit these sparkling fountains to flow according to their\r\nbent, if we would not confine them to our artificial and foul channels,\r\nwe should never see them boiling over and becoming turbid. We look with\r\nwonder on their ravages and on their stains; we forget that, in the\r\nbeginning, they were pure and undefiled. The fault is with us, in our\r\nsocial arrangements, in our encrusted and formal channels whereby we\r\ncause deviations and windings, and make them heave and bound. \"Your very\r\ngovernments are the cause of the evils which they pretend to remedy. Ye\r\nscepters of iron! ye absurd laws, ye we reproach for our inability to\r\nfulfill our duties on earth!\" Away with these dikes, the work of tyranny\r\nand routine! An emancipated nature will at once resume a direct and\r\nhealthy course and man, without effort, will find himself not only happy\r\nbut virtuous as well.[3332] On this principle the attack begins:\r\nthere is none that is pushed further, nor conducted with more bitter\r\nhostility. Thus far existing institutions are described simply as\r\noppressive and unreasonable; but now they are now they are accused of\r\nbeing unjust and corrupting as well. Reason and the natural desires were\r\nthe only insurgents; conscience and pride are now in rebellion. With\r\nVoltaire and Montesquieu all I might hope for is that fewer evils might\r\nbe anticipated. With Diderot and d'Holbach the horizon discloses only\r\na glowing El Dorado or a comfortable Cythera. With Rousseau I behold\r\nwithin reach an Eden where I shall immediately recover a nobility\r\ninseparable from my happiness. It is my right; nature and Providence\r\nsummon me to it; it is my heritage. One arbitrary institution alone\r\nkeeps me away from it, the creator of my vices as of my misery. With\r\nwhat rage and fury I will overthrow this ancient barrier!--We detect\r\nthis in the vehement tone, in the embittered style, and in the sombre\r\neloquence of the new doctrine. Fun and games are no longer in vogue,\r\na serious tone is maintained; people become exasperated, while the\r\npowerful voice now heard penetrates beyond the drawing-room, to the rude\r\nand suffering crowd to which no word had yet been spoken, whose\r\nmute resentment for the first time finds an interpreter, and whose\r\ndestructive instincts are soon to be set in motion at the summons of its\r\nherald.--Rousseau is a man of the people, and not a man of high\r\nsociety. He feels awkward in a drawing-room.[3333] He is not capable of\r\nconversing and of appearing amiable; the nice expressions only come into\r\nhis head too late, on the staircase as he leaves the house; he keeps\r\nsilent with a sulky air or utters stupidities, redeeming his awkwardness\r\nwith the sallies of a clown or with the phrases of a vulgar pedant.\r\nElegance annoys him, luxury makes him uncomfortable, politeness is\r\na lie, conversation mere prattle, ease of manner a grimace, gaiety a\r\nconvention, wit a parade, science so much charlatanry, philosophy an\r\naffection and morals utter corruption. All is factitious, false and\r\nunwholesome,[3334] from the make-up, toilet and beauty of women to the\r\natmosphere of the apartments and the ragouts on the dinner-table, in\r\nsentiment as in amusement, in literature as in music, in government as\r\nin religion. This civilization, which boasts of its splendor, is simply\r\nthe restlessness of over-excited, servile monkeys each imitating the\r\nother, and each corrupting the other to, through sophistication, end\r\nup in worry and boredom. Human culture, accordingly, is in itself bad,\r\nwhile the fruit it produces is merely excrescence or poison.--Of what\r\nuse are the sciences? Uncertain and useless, they afford merely a\r\npasture-ground for idlers and wranglers.[3335]\r\n\r\n\"Who would want to pass a lifetime in sterile observation, if they,\r\napart from their duties and nature's demands, had had to bestow their\r\ntime on their country, on the unfortunate and on their friends!\"--Of\r\nwhat use are the fine arts? They serve only as public flattery of\r\ndominant passions. \"The more pleasing and the more perfect the drama,\r\nthe more baneful its influence;\" the theater, even with Molière, is\r\na school of bad morals, \"inasmuch as it excites deceitful souls to\r\nridicule, in the name of comedy, the candor of artless people.\" Tragedy,\r\nsaid to be moralizing, wastes in counterfeit effusions the little virtue\r\nthat still remains. \"When a man has been admiring the noble feats in the\r\nfables what more is expected of him? After paying homage to virtue is\r\nhe not discharged from all that he owes to it? What more would they have\r\nhim do? Must he practice it himself? He has no part to play, he is not a\r\ncomedian.\"--The sciences, the fine arts, the arts of luxury, philosophy,\r\nliterature, all this serve only to effeminate and distract the mind;\r\nall that is only made for the small crowd of brilliant and noisy insects\r\nbuzzing around the summits of society and sucking away all public\r\nsubstance.--As regards the sciences, but one is important, that of our\r\nduties, and, without so many subtleties and so much study, our innermost\r\nconscience suffice to show us the way.--As regards the arts and the\r\nskills, only those should be tolerated which, ministering to our prime\r\nnecessities, provide us with bread to feed us, with a roof to shelter\r\nus, clothing to cover us, and arms with which to defend ourselves.--In\r\nthe way of existence that only is healthy which enables us to live in\r\nthe country, artlessly, without display, in family union, devoted to\r\ncultivation, living on the products of the soil and among neighbors that\r\nare equals and with servants that one trusts as friends.[3336]--As for\r\nthe classes, but one is respectable, that of laboring men, especially\r\nthat of men working with their own hands, artisans and mechanics,\r\nonly these being really of service, the only ones who, through their\r\nsituation, are in close proximity to the natural state, and who\r\npreserve, under a rough exterior, the warmth, the goodness and the\r\nintegrity of primitive instincts.--Accordingly, let us call by its true\r\nname this elegance, this luxury, this urbanity, this literary delicacy,\r\nthis philosophical eccentricity, admired by the prejudiced as the flower\r\nof the life of humanity; it is only mold and mildew. In like manner\r\nesteem at its just value the swarm that live upon it, namely, the\r\nindolent aristocracy, the fashionable world, the privileged who direct\r\nand make a display, the idlers of the drawing room who talk, divert\r\nthemselves and regard themselves as the elect of humanity, but who are\r\nsimply so many parasites. Whether parasitic or excretory, one attracts\r\nthe other, and the tree can only be well if we get rid of both.\r\n\r\nIf civilization is bad, society is worse. [3337] For this could not have\r\nbeen established except by destroying primitive equality, while its two\r\nprincipal institutions, property and government, are encroachments.\r\n\r\n\"He who first enclosed a plot of ground, and who took it into his to\r\nsay this belongs to me, and who found people simple enough to believe\r\nhim,[3338] was the true founder of civil society. What crimes, what\r\nwars, what murders, what misery and what horrors would have been spared\r\nthe human race if he who, pulling up the landmark and filling up the\r\nditch, had cried out to his fellows: Be wary of that impostor; you are\r\nlost if you forget that no one has a right to the land and that its\r\nfruits are the property of all!\"--The first ownership was a robbery\r\nby which an individual abstracted from the community a portion of the\r\npublic domain. Nothing could justify the outrage, nothing added by him\r\nto the soil, neither his industry, nor his trouble, nor his valor. \"In\r\nvain may he assert that he built this wall, and acquired this land by\r\nhis labor. Who marked it out for him, one might ask, and how do you come\r\nto be paid for labor which was never imposed on you? Are you not aware\r\nthat a multitude of your brethren are suffering and perishing with want\r\nbecause you have too much, and that the express and unanimous consent\r\nof the whole human species is requisite before appropriating to yourself\r\nmore than your share of the common subsistence?\"--\r\n\r\nUnderneath this theory we recognize the personal attitude, the grudge of\r\nthe poor embittered commoner, who, on entering society, finds the places\r\nall taken, and who is incapable of creating one for himself; who, in his\r\nconfessions, marks the day when he ceased to feel hungry; who, for\r\nlack of something better, lives in concubinage with a serving-woman and\r\nplaces his five children in an orphanage; who is in turn servant, clerk,\r\nvagabond, teacher and copyist, always on the look-out, using his wits to\r\nmaintain his independence, disgusted with the contrast between what he\r\nis outwardly and what he feels himself inwardly, avoiding envy only by\r\ndisparagement, and preserving in the folds of his heart an old grudge\r\n\"against the rich and the fortunate in this world as if they were so at\r\nhis expense, as if their assumed happiness had been an infringement on\r\nhis happiness.\" [3339]--Not only is there injustice in the origin of\r\nproperty but again there is injustice in the power it secures to itself,\r\nthe wrong increasing like a canker under the partiality of law.\r\n\r\n\"Are not all the advantages of society for the rich and for the\r\npowerful?[3340] Do they not absorb to themselves all lucrative\r\npositions? Is not the public authority wholly in their interest? If a\r\nman of position robs his creditors or commits other offenses is he not\r\ncertain of impunity? Are not the blows he bestows, his violent assaults,\r\nthe murders and the assassinations he is guilty of, matters that are\r\nhushed up and forgotten in a few months?--Let this same man be robbed\r\nand the entire police set to work, and woe to the poor innocents\r\nthey suspect!--Has he to pass a dangerous place, escorts overrun the\r\ncountry. If the axle of his coach breaks down everybody runs to\r\nhelp him.--Is a noise made at his gate, a word from him and all\r\nis silent.--Does the crowd annoy him, he makes a sign and order\r\nreigns.--Does a carter chance to cross his path, his attendants are\r\nready to knock him down, while fifty honest pedestrians might be crushed\r\nrather than delaying a rascal in his carriage.--All these considerations\r\ndo not cost him a penny.; they are a rich man's entitlements and not the\r\nprice for being rich.--What a different picture of the poor! The more\r\nhumanity owes them the more it refuses them. All doors are closed to\r\nthem even when they have the right to have them opened, and if they\r\nsometimes obtain justice they have more trouble than others in obtaining\r\nfavors. If there is statute labor to be carried out, a militia to raise,\r\nthe poor are the most eligible. It always bears burdens from which\r\nits wealthier neighbor with influence secures exemption. At the least\r\naccident to a poor man everybody abandons him. Let his cart topple over\r\nand I regard him as fortunate if he escapes the insults of the smart\r\ncompanions of a young duke passing by. In a word all assistance free of\r\ncharge is withheld from him in time of need, precisely because he cannot\r\npay for it. I regard him as a lost man if he is so unfortunate as to be\r\nhonest and have a pretty daughter and a powerful neighbor.--Let us sum\r\nup in a few words the social pact of the two estates:\r\n\r\nYou need me because I am rich and you are poor: let us then make\r\nan agreement together. I will allow you the honor of serving me on\r\ncondition that you give me the little that remains to you for the\r\ntrouble I have in governing you.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows the spirit, the aim and the effect of political society.--At\r\nthe start, according to Rousseau, it consisted of an unfair bargain,\r\nmade by an adroit rich man with a poor dupe, \"providing new fetters\r\nfor the weak and fresh power for the rich,\" and, under the title of\r\nlegitimate property, consecrating the usurpation of the soil.--To day\r\nthe contract is still more unjust \"by means of which a child may govern\r\nan old man, a fool lead the wise, and a handful of people live in\r\nabundance whilst a famished multitude lack the necessities for life.\"\r\nIt is the nature of inequality to grow; hence the authority of some\r\nincreases along with the dependence of the rest, so that the two\r\nconditions, having at last reached their extremes, the hereditary and\r\nperpetual objection of the people seems to be a divine right equally\r\nwith the hereditary and perpetual despotism of the king.--This is the\r\npresent situation and, any change, will be for the worse. \"For,[3341]\r\nthe occupation of all kings, or of those charged with their functions,\r\nconsists wholly of two objects, to extend their sway abroad and to\r\nrender it more absolute at home.\" When they plead some other cause it is\r\nonly a pretext. \"The terms public good, happiness of subjects, the glory\r\nof the nation, so heavily employed in government announcements, never\r\ndenote other than disastrous commands, and the people shudder beforehand\r\nwhen its masters allude to their paternal solicitude.\"--However,\r\nthis fatal point once reached, \"the contract with the government is\r\ndissolved; the despot is master only while remaining the most powerful,\r\nand, as soon as he can be expelled, it is useless for him to cry out\r\nagainst violence.\" Because right can only exist through consent, and no\r\nconsent nor right can exist between master and slave.\r\n\r\nWhether between one man and another man, or between one man and a\r\npeople, the following is an absurd address: 'I make an agreement with\r\nyou wholly at your expense and to my advantage which I shall respect\r\nas long as I please and which you shall respect as long as it pleases\r\nme.'\"--\r\n\r\nOnly madmen may sign such a treaty, but, as madmen, they are not in\r\na condition to negotiate and their signature is not binding. Only the\r\nvanquished on the ground, with swords pointed at their throats, may\r\naccept such conditions but, being under constraint, their promise is\r\nnull and void. Madmen and the conquered may for a thousand years have\r\nbound over all subsequent generations, but a contract for a minor is not\r\na contract for an adult, and on the child arriving at the age of Reason\r\nhe belongs to himself. We at last have become adults, and we have only\r\nto make use of our rights to reduce the pretensions of this self-styled\r\nauthority to their just value. It has power on its side and nothing\r\nmore. But \"a pistol in the hand of a brigand is also power,\" but do you\r\nthink that I should be morally obliged to give him my purse?--I obey\r\nonly compelled by force and I will have my purse back as soon as I can\r\ntake his pistol away from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII: The Lost Children.\r\n\r\n     The lost children of the philosophic party.--Naigeon,\r\n     Sylvain Maréchal, Mably, Morelly.--The entire discredit of\r\n     traditions and institutions derived from it.\r\n\r\nWe stop here. It is pointless to follow the lost children of the party,\r\nNaigeon and Sylvain Maréchal, Mably and Morelly, the fanatics that set\r\natheism up as an obligatory dogma and a superior duty; the socialists\r\nwho, to suppress egoism, propose a community of property, and who found\r\na republic in which any man that proposes to re-establish \"detestable\r\nownership\" shall be declared an enemy of humanity, treated as a \"raging\r\nmaniac\" and shut up in a dungeon for life. It is sufficient to have\r\nstudied the operations of large armies and of great campaigns.--With\r\ndifferent gadgets and opposite tactics, the various attacks have all had\r\nthe same results, all the institutions have been undermined from below.\r\nThe governing ideology has withdrawn all authority from custom, from\r\nreligion, from the State. Not only is it assumed that tradition in\r\nitself is false, but again that it is harmful through its works, that it\r\nbuilds up injustice on error, and that by rendering man blind it leads\r\nhim to oppress. Henceforth it is outlawed. Let this \"loathsome thing\"\r\nwith its supporters be crushed out. It is the great evil of the human\r\nspecies, and, when suppressed, only goodness will remain.\r\n\r\n\"The time will then come[3342] when the sun will shine only on free men\r\nrecognizing no other master than Reason; when tyrants and slaves, and\r\npriests with their senseless or hypocritical instruments will exist only\r\nin history and on the stage; when attention will no longer be bestowed\r\non them except to pity their victims and their dupes, keeping oneself\r\nvigilant and useful through horror of their excesses, and able to\r\nrecognize and extinguish by the force of Reason the first germs of\r\nsuperstition and of tyranny, should they ever venture to reappear.\"\r\n\r\nThe millennium is dawning and it is once more Reason, which should set\r\nit up. In this way we shall owe everything to its salutary authority,\r\nthe foundation of the new order of things as well as the destruction of\r\nthe old one.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3301: \"Discours de la Methode.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3302: This is evident with Descartes in the second step he\r\ntakes.

Liberty, Equality And Sovereignty Of The People.\r\n\r\n     The mathematical method.--Definition of man in the\r\n     abstract.--The social contract.--Independence and equality\r\n     of the contractors.--All equal before the law and each\r\n     sharing in the sovereignty.\r\n\r\nConsider future society as it appears at this moment to our legislators\r\nin their study, and bear in mind that it will soon appear under the same\r\naspect to the legislators of the Assembly.--In their eyes the decisive\r\nmoment has come. Henceforth two histories are to exist;[3401] one, that\r\nof the past, the other, that of the future, formerly a history of Man\r\nstill deprived of his reason, and at present the history of the rational\r\nhuman being. The rule of right is at last to begin. Of all that the\r\npast generations have founded and transmitted nothing is legitimate.\r\nOverlaying the natural Man they created an artificial Man, either\r\necclesiastic or laic, noble or commoner, sovereign or subject,\r\nproprietor or proletary, ignorant or cultivated, peasant or citizen,\r\nslave or master, all being phony qualities which we are not to heed,\r\nas their origin is tainted with violence and robbery. Strip off these\r\nsuperfluous garments; let us take Man in himself, the same under all\r\nconditions, in all situations, in all countries, in all ages, and strive\r\nto ascertain what sort of association is the best adapted to him. The\r\nproblem thus stated, the rest follows.--In accordance with the customs\r\nof the classic mentality, and with the precepts of the prevailing\r\nideology, a political system is now constructed after a mathematical\r\nmodel.[3402] A simple statement is selected, and set apart, very\r\ngeneral, familiar, readily apparent, and easily understood by the most\r\nignorant and inattentive schoolboy. Reject every difference, which\r\nseparates one man from other men; retain of him only the portion common\r\nto him and to others. The remainder constitutes Man in general, or in\r\nother words, \"a sensitive and rational being who, thus endowed, avoids\r\npain and seeks pleasure,\" and therefore aspiring to happiness, namely, a\r\nstable condition in which one enjoys greater pleasure than pain,\"[3403]\r\nor, again, \"a sensitive being capable of forming rational opinions and\r\nof acquiring moral ideas.\"[3404]\r\n\r\nAnyone (they say) may by himself experience this elementary idea, and can\r\nverify it at the first glance. Such is the social unit; let several of\r\nthese be combined, a thousand, a hundred thousand, a million, twenty-six\r\nmillions, and you have the French people. Men born at twenty-one years\r\nof age, without relations, without a past, without traditions, without\r\na country, are supposed to be assembled for the first time and, for the\r\nfirst time, to treat with each other. In this position, at the moment of\r\ncontracting together, all are equal: for, as the definition states, the\r\nextrinsic and spurious qualities through which alone all differ have\r\nbeen rejected. All are free; for, according to the definition, the\r\nunjust thralldom imposed on all by brute force and by hereditary\r\nprejudice has been suppressed.--But if all men are equal, no reason\r\nexists why, in this contract, any special advantage should be conceded\r\nto one more than to another. Accordingly all shall be equal before the\r\nlaw; no person, or family, or class, shall be allowed any privilege; no\r\none shall claim a right of which another might be deprived; no one shall\r\nbe subject to any duty from another is exempt.--On the other hand, all\r\nbeing free, each enters with a free will along with the group of\r\nwills constitute the new community; it is necessary that in the common\r\nresolutions he should fully concur. Only on these conditions does he\r\nbind himself; he is bound to respect laws only because he has assisted\r\nin making them, and to obey magistrates only because he has aided in\r\nelecting them. Underneath all legitimate authority his consent or his\r\nvote must be apparent, while, in the humblest citizen, the most exalted\r\nof public powers must recognize a member of their own sovereignty.\r\nNo one may alienate or lose this portion of his sovereignty; it is\r\ninseparable from his person, and, on delegating it to another, he\r\nreserves to himself full possession of it.--The liberty, equality and\r\nsovereignty of the people constitute the first articles of the social\r\ncontract. These are rigorously deduced from a primary definition; other\r\nrights of the citizen are to be no less rigorously deduced from it,\r\nthe main features of the constitution, the most important civil and\r\npolitical laws, in short, the order, the form and the spirit of the new\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Naive Convictions\r\n\r\n     The first result.--The theory easily applied.--Confidence in\r\n     it due to belief in man's inherent goodness and\r\n     reasonableness.\r\n\r\nHence, two consequences.--In the first place, a society thus organized\r\nis the only just one; for, the reverse of all others, it is not the\r\nresult of a blind subjection to traditions, but of a contract concluded\r\namong equals, examined in open daylight, and assented to in full\r\nfreedom.[3405] The social contract, composed of demonstrated theorems,\r\nhas the authority of geometry; hence an equal value at all times,\r\nin every place, and for every people; it is accordingly rightfully\r\nestablished. Those who put an obstacle in its way are enemies of the\r\nhuman race; whether a government, an aristocracy or a clergy, they must\r\nbe overthrown. Revolt is simply just defense; in withdrawing ourselves\r\nfrom their hands we only recover what is wrongfully held and which\r\nlegitimately belongs to us.--In the second place, this social code, as\r\njust set forth, once promulgated, is applicable without misconception\r\nor resistance; for it is a species of moral geometry, simpler than any\r\nother, reduced to first principles, founded on the clearest and most\r\npopular notions, and, in four steps, leading to capital truths. The\r\ncomprehension and application of these truths demand no preparatory\r\nstudy or profound reflection; Reason is enough, and even common sense.\r\nPrejudice and selfishness alone might impair the testimony; but never\r\nwill testimony be wanting in a sound brain and in an upright heart.\r\nExplain the rights of man to a laborer or to a peasant and at once he\r\nbecomes an able politician; teach children the citizen's catechism and,\r\non leaving school, they comprehend duties and rights as well as the four\r\nfundamental principles.--Thereupon hope spreads her wings to the fullest\r\nextent, all obstacles seem removed. It is admitted that, of itself, and\r\nthrough its own force, the theory engenders its own application, and\r\nthat it suffices for men to decree or accept the social compact to\r\nacquire suddenly by this act the capacity for comprehending it and the\r\ndisposition to carry it out.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful confidence, at first inexplicable, which assume with\r\nregard to man an idea which we no longer hold. Man, indeed, was regarded\r\nas essentially good and reasonable.--Rational, that is to say, capable\r\nof assenting to a plain obvious principle, of following an ulterior\r\nchain of argument, of understanding and accepting the final conclusion,\r\nof extracting for himself, on the occasion calling for it, the varied\r\nconsequences to which it leads: such is the ordinary man in the eyes of\r\nthe writers of the day; they judged him by themselves. To them the human\r\nintellect is their own, the classic intellect. For a hundred and fifty\r\nyears it ruled in literature, in philosophy, in science, in education,\r\nin conversation, by virtue of tradition, of usage and of good taste.\r\nNo other was tolerated and no other was imagined; and if, within this\r\nclosed circle, a stranger succeeds in introducing himself, it is on\r\ncondition of adopting the oratorical idiom which the raison raisonnante\r\nimposes on all its guests, on Greeks, Englishmen, barbarians, peasants\r\nand savages, however different from each other and however different\r\nthey may be amongst themselves. In Buffon, the first man, on narrating\r\nthe first hours of his being, analyses his sensations, emotions and\r\nimpulses, with as much subtlety as Condillac himself. With Diderot, Otou\r\nthe Tahitian, with Bernardin de St. Pierre, a semi-savage Hindu and\r\nan old colonist of the Ile-de-France, with Rousseau a country vicar,\r\na gardener and a juggler, are all accomplished conversationalists\r\nand moralists. In Marmontel and in Florian, in all the literature of\r\ninferior rank preceding or accompanying the Revolution, also in the\r\ntragic or comic drama, the chief talent of the personage, whoever he may\r\nbe, whether an uncultivated rustic, tattooed barbarian or naked savage,\r\nconsists in being able to explain himself, in arguing and in following\r\nan abstract discourse with intelligence and attention, in tracing for\r\nhimself, or in the footsteps of a guide, the rectilinear pathway of\r\ngeneral ideas. Thus, to the spectators of the eighteenth century, Reason\r\nis everywhere and she stands alone in the world. A form of intellect so\r\nuniversal necessarily strikes them as natural, they resemble people\r\nwho, speaking but one language, and one they have always spoken with\r\nfacility, cannot imagine another language being spoken, or that they may\r\nbe surrounded by the deaf and the dumb. And so much the more in as much\r\nas their theory authorizes this prejudice. According to the new ideology\r\nall minds are within reach of all truths. If the mind does not\r\ngrasp them the fault is ours in not being properly prepared; it will\r\ncomprehend if we take the trouble to guide it properly. For it has\r\nsenses the same as our own; and sensations, revived, combined and noted\r\nby signs, suffice to form \"not only all our conceptions but again\r\nall our faculties.\"[3406] An exact and constant relationship of ideas\r\nattaches our simplest perceptions to the most complex sciences, and,\r\nfrom the lowest to the highest degree, a scale is practicable; if the\r\nscholar stops on the way it is owing to our having left too great an\r\ninterval between two degrees of the scale; let no intermediary degrees\r\nbe omitted and he will mount to the top of it. To this exalted idea\r\nof the faculties of man is added a no less exalted idea of his heart.\r\nRousseau having declared this to be naturally good, the refined class\r\nplunge into the belief with all the exaggerations of fashion and all the\r\nsentimentality of the drawing-room. The conviction is widespread that\r\nman, and especially the man of the people, is sensitive and affectionate\r\nby nature; that he is immediately impressed by benefactions and disposed\r\nto be grateful for them, that he softens at the slightest sign of\r\ninterest in him, and that he is capable of every refinement. A series of\r\nengravings represents two children in a dilapidated cottage,[3407]\r\none five and the other three years old, by the side of an infirm\r\ngrandmother, one supporting her head and the other giving her drink; the\r\nfather and mother enter and, on seeing this touching incident, \"these\r\ngood people find themselves so happy in possessing such children they\r\nforget they are poor.\" \"Oh, my father,\" cries a shepherd youth of the\r\nPyrénées,[3408] \"accept this faithful dog, so true to me for seven\r\nyears; in future let him follow and defend you, thus serving me better\r\nthan in any other manner.\" It would require too much space to follow in\r\nthe literature of the end of the century, from Marmontel to Bernardin de\r\nSaint-Pierre, and from Florian to Berquin and Bitaubé, the interminable\r\nrepetition of these sweet insipidities. The illusion even reaches\r\nstatesmen. \"Sire,\" says Turgot, on presenting the king with a plan of\r\npolitical education,[3409] \"I venture to assert that in ten years your\r\nnation will no longer be recognizable, and through enlightenment and\r\ngood morals, in intelligent zeal for your service and for the country,\r\nit will rise above all other nations. Children who are now ten years\r\nof age will then be men prepared for the state, loving their country,\r\nsubmissive to authority, not through fear but through Reason, aiding\r\ntheir fellow-citizens, and accustomed to recognizing and respecting\r\njustice.\"--In the months of January, 1789,[3410] Necker, to whom M.\r\nde Bouillé pointed out the imminent danger arising from the unswerving\r\nefforts of the Third-Estate, \"coldly replied, turning his eyes upward,\r\n'reliance must be placed on the moral virtues of man.'\"--In the main, on\r\nthe imagination forming any conception of human society, this consists\r\nof a vague, semi-bucolic, semi-theatrical scene, somewhat resembling\r\nthose displayed on the frontispieces of illustrated works on morals and\r\npolitics. Half-naked men with others clothed in skins, assemble together\r\nunder a large oak tree; in the center of the group a venerable old man\r\narises and makes an address, using \"the language of nature and Reason,\"\r\nproposing that all should be united, and explaining how men are bound\r\ntogether by mutual obligations; he shows them the harmony of private and\r\nof public interests, and ends by making them appreciate of the beauty of\r\nvirtue.[3411] All utter shouts of joy, embrace each other, gather round\r\nthe speaker and elect him chief magistrate; dancing is going on under\r\nthe branches in the background, and henceforth happiness on earth is\r\nfully established.--This is no exaggeration. The National Assembly\r\naddresses the nation in harangues of this style. For many years\r\nthe government speaks to the people as it would to one of Gessner's\r\nshepherds. The peasants are entreated not to burn castles because it is\r\npainful for their good king to see such sights. They are exhorted \"to\r\nsurprise him with their virtues in order that he may be the sooner\r\nrewarded for his own.\"[3412] At the height of the Jacquerie tumults the\r\nsages of the day seem to think they are living in a state of pastoral\r\nsimplicity, and that with an air on the flute they may restore to its\r\nfold the howling pack of bestial animosities and unchained appetites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Our True Human Nature.\r\n\r\n     The inadequacy and fragility of reason in man.--The rarity\r\n     and inadequacy of reason in humanity.--Subordination of\r\n     reason in human conduct.--Brutal and dangerous forces.--The\r\n     nature and utility of government. Government impossible\r\n     under the new theory.\r\n\r\nIt is a sad thing to fall asleep in a sheep-shed and, on awakening,\r\nto find the sheep transformed into wolves; and yet, in the event of a\r\nrevolution that is what we may expect. What we call reason in Man is not\r\nan innate endowment, basic and enduring, but a tardy acquisition and a\r\nfragile composition. The slightest physiological knowledge will tell us\r\nthat it is a precarious act of balance, dependent on the no less greater\r\ninstability of the brain, nerves, circulation and digestion. Take women\r\nthat are hungry and men that have been drinking; place a thousand of\r\nthese together, and let them excite each other with their cries, their\r\nanxieties, and the contagious reaction of their ever-deepening emotions;\r\nit will not be long before you find them a crowd of dangerous maniacs.\r\nThis becomes evident, and abundantly so, after 1789.--Now, consult\r\npsychology. The simplest mental operation, a sensuous perception, is an\r\nact of memory, the appliance of a name, an ordinary act of judgment is\r\nthe play of complicated mechanism, the joint and final result of several\r\nmillions of wheels which, like those of a clock,[3413] turn and propel\r\nblindly, each for itself, each through its own force, and each kept\r\nin place and in functional activity by a system of balance and\r\ncompensation.[3414] If the hands mark the hour with any degree of\r\naccuracy it is due to a wonderful if not miraculous conjunction, while\r\nhallucination, delirium and monomania, ever at the door, are always\r\nready to enter it. Properly speaking Man is mad, as the body is sick, by\r\nnature; the health of our mind, like the health of our organs, is simply\r\na repeated achievement and a happy accident. If such happens to be the\r\ncase with the coarse woof and canvas, with the large and approximately\r\nstrong threads of our intellect, what are the chances for the ulterior\r\nand superadded embroidery, the subtle and complicated netting forming\r\nreason properly so called, and which is composed of general ideas?\r\nFormed by a slow and delicate process of weaving, through a long system\r\nof signs, amidst the agitation of pride, of enthusiasm and of dogmatic\r\nobstinacy, what risk, even in the most perfect brain, for these ideas\r\nonly inadequately to correspond with outward reality! All that we\r\nrequire in this connection is to witness the operation of the idyll in\r\nvogue with the philosophers and politicians.--These being the superior\r\nminds, what can be said of the masses of the people, of the uncultivated\r\nor semi-cultivated brains? According as reason is crippled in man so is\r\nit rare in humanity. General ideas and accurate reasoning are found only\r\nin a select few. The comprehension of abstract terms and the habit of\r\nmaking accurate deductions requires previous and special preparation, a\r\nprolonged mental exercise and steady practice, and besides this, where\r\npolitical matters are concerned, a degree of composure which, affording\r\nevery facility for reflection, enables a man to detach himself for\r\na moment from himself for the consideration of his interests as a\r\ndisinterested observer. If one of these conditions is wanting, reason,\r\nespecially in relation to politics, is absent.--In a peasant or a\r\nvillager, in any man brought up from infancy to manual labor, not only\r\nis the network of superior conceptions defective, but again the internal\r\nmachinery by which they are woven is not perfected. Accustomed to the\r\nopen air, to the exercise of his limbs, his attention flags if he stands\r\ninactive for a quarter of an hour; generalized expressions find their\r\nway into his mind only as sound; the mental combination they ought to\r\nexcite cannot be produced. He becomes drowsy unless a powerful vibrating\r\nvoice contagiously arouses in him the instincts of flesh and blood,\r\nthe personal cravings, the secret enmities which, restrained by outward\r\ndiscipline, are always ready to be set free.--In the half-cultivated\r\nmind, even with the man who thinks himself cultivated and who reads the\r\nnewspapers, principles are generally disproportionate guests; they are\r\nabove his comprehension; he does not measure their bearings, he does not\r\nappreciate their limitations, he is insensible to their restrictions and\r\nhe falsifies their application. They are like those preparations of the\r\nlaboratory which, harmless in the chemist's hands, become destructive\r\nin the street under the feet of passing people.--Too soon will this be\r\napparent when, in the name of popular sovereignty, each commune, each\r\nmob, shall regard itself as the nation and act accordingly; when Reason,\r\nin the hands of its new interpreters, shall inaugurate riots in the\r\nstreets and peasant insurrections in the fields.[3415]\r\n\r\nThis is owing to the philosophers of the age having been mistaken in two\r\nways. Not only is reason not natural to Man nor universal in humanity,\r\nbut again, in the conduct of Man and of humanity, its influence is\r\nsmall. Except with a few cool and clear intellects, a Fontenelle,\r\na Hume, a Gibbon, with whom it may prevail because it encounters no\r\nrivals, it is very far from playing a leading part; it belongs to other\r\nforces born within us, and which, by virtue of being the first comers,\r\nremain in possession of the field. The place obtained by reason is\r\nalways restricted; the office it fulfills is generally secondary. Openly\r\nor secretly, it is only a convenient subaltern, a domestic advocate\r\nconstantly suborned, employed by the proprietors to plead in their\r\nbehalf; if they yield precedence in public it is only through decorum.\r\nVainly do they proclaim it the recognized sovereign; they grant it only\r\na passing authority, and, under its nominal control, they remain the\r\ninward masters. These masters of Man consists of physical temperament,\r\nbodily needs, animal instinct, hereditary prejudice, imagination,\r\ngenerally the dominant passion, and more particularly personal or family\r\ninterest, also that of caste or party. We are making a big mistake were\r\nwe assume men to be naturally good, generous, pleasant, or at any rate\r\ngentle, pliable, and ready to sacrifice themselves to social interests\r\nor to those of others. There are several, and among them the strongest,\r\nwho, left to themselves, would only wreak havoc.--In the first place, if\r\nthere is no certainty of Man being a remote blood cousin of the monkey,\r\nit is at least certain that, in his structure, he is an animal closely\r\nrelated to the monkey, provided with canine teeth, carnivorous, formerly\r\ncannibal and, therefore, a hunter and bellicose. Hence there is in him\r\na steady substratum of brutality and ferocity, and of violent and\r\ndestructive instincts, to which must be added, if he is French, gaiety,\r\nlaughter, and a strange propensity to gambol and act insanely in the\r\nhavoc he makes; we shall see him at work.--In the second place, at the\r\noutset, his condition casts him naked and destitute on an ungrateful\r\nsoil, on which subsistence is difficult, where, at the risk of death, he\r\nis obliged to save and to economize. Hence a constant preoccupation and\r\nthe rooted idea of acquiring, accumulating, and possessing, rapacity and\r\navarice, more particularly in the class which, tied to the globe, fasts\r\nfor sixty generations in order to support other classes, and whose\r\ncrooked fingers are always outstretched to clutch the soil whose fruits\r\nthey cause to grow;-we shall see this class at work.--Finally, his more\r\ndelicate mental organization makes of him from the earliest days an\r\nimaginative being in which swarming fancies develop themselves into\r\nmonstrous chimeras to expand his hopes, fears and desires beyond all\r\nbounds. Hence an excess of sensibility, sudden outbursts of emotion,\r\ncontagious agitation, irresistible currents of passion, epidemics of\r\ncredulity and suspicion, in short, enthusiasm and panic, especially if\r\nhe is French, that is to say, excitable and communicative, easily thrown\r\noff his balance and prompt to accept foreign impulsion, deprived of\r\nthe natural ballast which a phlegmatic temperament and concentration\r\nof lonely meditations secure to his German and Latin neighbors; and all\r\nthis we shall see at work.--These constitute some of the brute forces\r\nthat control human life. In ordinary times we pay no attention to them;\r\nbeing subordinated they do not seem to us formidable. We take it for\r\ngranted that they are allayed and pacified; we flatter ourselves that\r\nthe discipline imposed on them has made them natural, and that by dint\r\nof flowing between dikes they are settled down into their accustomed\r\nbeds. The truth is that, like all brute forces, like a stream or a\r\ntorrent, they only remain in these under constraint; it is the dike\r\nwhich, through its resistance, produces this moderation. Another force\r\nequal to their force had to be installed against their outbreaks and\r\ndevastation, graduated according to their scale, all the firmer as they\r\nare more menacing, despotic if need be against their despotism, in any\r\nevent constraining and repressive, at the outset a tribal chief, later\r\nan army general, all modes consisting in an elective or hereditary\r\nman-at-arms, possessing vigilant eyes and vigorous arms, and who,\r\nwith blows, excites fear and, through fear, maintains order. In the\r\nregulation and limitation of his blows divers instrumentalities are\r\nemployed, a pre-established constitution, a division of powers, a code\r\nof laws, tribunals, and legal formalities. At the bottom of all these\r\nwheels ever appears the principal lever, the efficacious instrument,\r\nnamely, the policeman armed against the savage, brigand and madman each\r\nof us harbors, in repose or manacled, but always living, in the recesses\r\nof his own breast.[3416]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, in the new theory, every principle promulgated, every\r\nprecaution taken, every suspicion awaked is aimed against the policeman.\r\nIn the name of the sovereignty of the people all authority is\r\nwithdrawn from the government, every prerogative, every initiative, its\r\ncontinuance and its force. The people, being sovereign the government is\r\nsimply its clerk, and less than its clerk, merely its domestic.--Between\r\nthem \"no contract\" indefinite or at least enduring, \"and which may be\r\ncanceled only by mutual consent or the unfaithfulness of one of the two\r\nparties. It is against the nature of a political body for the sovereign\r\nto impose a law on himself which he cannot set aside.\"--There is no\r\nsacred and inviolable charter \"binding a people to the forms of an\r\nestablished constitution. The right to change these is the first\r\nguarantee of all rights. There is not, and never can be, any\r\nfundamental, obligatory law for the entire body of a people, not even\r\nthe social contract.\"--It is through usurpation and deception that\r\na prince, an assembly, and a body of magistrates declare themselves\r\nrepresentatives of the people. \"Sovereignty is not to be represented for\r\nthe same reason that it is not to be ceded. . . . The moment a people\r\ngives itself representatives it is no longer free, it exists no more. . .\r\nThe English people think themselves free but they deceive themselves;\r\nthey are free only during an election of members of parliament; on the\r\nelection of these they become slaves and are null. . . the deputies\r\nof the people are not, nor can they be, its representatives; they are\r\nsimply its commissioners and can sign no binding final agreement.\r\nEvery law not ratified by the people themselves is null and is no\r\nlaw.\"[3417]--\"A body of laws sanctioned by an assembly of the people\r\nthrough a fixed constitution of the State does not suffice; other fixed\r\nand periodical assemblies are necessary which cannot be abolished or\r\nextended, so arranged that on a given day the people may be legitimately\r\nconvoked by the law, no other formal conviction being requisite. . . The\r\nmoment the people are thus assembled the jurisdiction of the government\r\nis to cease, and the executive power is to be suspended,\" society\r\ncommencing anew, while citizens, restored to their primitive\r\nindependence, may reconstitute at will, for any period they determine,\r\nthe provisional contract to which they have assented only for a\r\ndetermined time. \"The opening of these assemblies, whose sole object\r\nis to maintain the social compact, should always take place with two\r\npropositions, never suppressed, and which are to be voted on separately;\r\nthe first one, whether the sovereign( people) is willing to maintain\r\nthe actual form of the government; the second, whether the people are\r\nwilling to leave its administration in the hands of those actually\r\nperforming its duties.\"--Thus, \"the act by which a people is subject\r\nto its chiefs is absolutely only a commission, a service in which, as\r\nsimple officers of their sovereign, they exercise in his name the power\r\nof which he has made them depositories, and which he may modify, limit\r\nand resume at pleasure.\"[3418] Not only does it always reserve to itself\r\n\"the legislative power which belongs to it and which can belong only to\r\nit,\" but again, it delegates and withdraws the executive power according\r\nto its fancy. Those who exercise it are its employees. \"It may establish\r\nand depose them when it pleases.\" In relation to it they have no rights.\r\n\"It is not a matter of contract with them but one of obedience;\"\r\nthey have \"no conditions\" to prescribe; they cannot demand of it the\r\nfulfillment of any engagement.--It is useless to raise the objection\r\nthat, according to this, every man of spirit or of culture will decline\r\nour offices, and that our chiefs will bear the character of lackeys.\r\nWe will not leave them the freedom of accepting or declining office;\r\nwe impose it on them authoritatively. \"In every true democracy the\r\nmagistrature is not an advantage but an onerous burden, not to\r\nbe assigned to one more than to another.\" We can lay hands on our\r\nmagistrates, take them by the collar and set them on their benches in\r\nspite of themselves. By fair means or foul they are the working subjects\r\n(corvéables) of the State, in a lower condition than a valet or a\r\nmechanic, since the mechanic does his work according to acceptable\r\nconditions, and the discharged valet can claim his eight days' notice\r\nto quit. As soon as the government throws off this humble attitude it\r\nusurps, while constitutions are to proclaim that, in such an event,\r\ninsurrection is not only the most sacred right but the most imperative\r\nduty.--The new theory is now put into practice, and the dogma of the\r\nsovereignty of the people, interpreted by the crowd, is to result in a\r\ncomplete anarchy, up to the moment when, interpreted by its leaders, it\r\nproduces perfect despotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Birth Of Socialist Theory, Its Two Sides.\r\n\r\n     The second result.--The new theory leads to despotism.--\r\n     Precedents for this theory.--Administrative centralization.--\r\n     The Utopia of the Economists.--Invalidity of preceding\r\n     rights.--Collateral associations not tolerated.--Complete\r\n     alienation of the individual from the community.--Rights of\r\n     the State in relation to property, education and religion.--\r\n     The State a Spartan convent.\r\n\r\nFor this theory has two aspects; whereas one side leads towards the\r\nperpetual demolition of government, the other results in the unlimited\r\ndictatorship of the State. The new social contract is not a historic\r\npact, like the English Declaration of Rights in 1688, or the Dutch\r\nfederation in 1579, entered into by actual and living individuals,\r\nadmitting acquired situations, groups already formed, established\r\npositions, and drawn up to recognize, define, guarantee and complete\r\nanterior rights. Antecedent to the social contract no veritable right\r\nexist; for veritable rights are born solely out of the social contract,\r\nthe only valid one, since it is the only one agreed upon between beings\r\nperfectly equal and perfectly free, so many abstract creatures, so many\r\nspecies of mathematical units, all of the same value, all playing the\r\nsame part and whose inequality or constraint never disturbs the common\r\nunderstanding. Hence at the moment of its completion, all other facts\r\nare nullified. Property, family, church, no ancient institution may\r\ninvoke any right against the new State. The area on which it is built\r\nup must be considered vacant; if old structures are partly allowed to\r\nremain it is only in its name and for its benefit, to be enclosed within\r\nits barriers and appropriated to its use; the entire soil of humanity\r\nis its property. On the other hand it is not, according to the American\r\ndoctrine, an association for mutual protection, a society like other\r\nsocieties, circumscribed in its purpose, restricted to its office,\r\nlimited in its powers, and by which individuals reserving to themselves\r\nthe better portion of their property and persons, assess each other for\r\nthe maintenance of an army, a police, tribunals, highways, schools, in\r\nshort, the major instruments of public safety and utility, at the same\r\ntime withholding the remainder of local, general, spiritual and material\r\nservices in favor of private initiative and of spontaneous associations\r\nthat may arise as occasion or necessity calls for them. Our State is not\r\nto be a simple utilitarian machine, a convenient, handy implement, of\r\nwhich the workman avails himself without abandoning the free use of his\r\nhand, or the simultaneous use of other implements. Being elder born, the\r\nonly son and sole representative of Reason it must, to ensure its sway,\r\nleave nothing beyond its grasp.--In this respect the old régime paves\r\nthe way for the new one, while the established system inclines minds\r\nbeforehand to the budding theory. Through administrative centralization\r\nthe State already, for a long time, has its hands everywhere.[3419]\r\n\r\n\"You must know,\" says Law to the Marquis d'Argenson, \"that the\r\nkingdom of France is governed by thirty intendants. You have neither\r\nparliaments, assemblies or governors, simply thirty masters of requests,\r\nprovincial clerks, on whom depends the happiness or misery, the\r\nfruitfulness or sterility of these provinces.\"\r\n\r\nThe king, in fact, sovereign, father, and universal guardian, manages\r\nlocal affairs through his delegates, and intervenes in private affairs\r\nthrough his favors or lettres-de-cachet (royal orders of imprisonment).\r\nSuch an example and such a course followed for fifty years excites\r\nthe imagination. No other instrument is more useful for carrying large\r\nreforms out at one time. Hence, far from restricting the central power\r\nthe economists are desirous of extending its action. Instead of setting\r\nup new dikes against it they interest themselves only in destroying\r\nwhat is left of the old dikes still interfering with it. \"The system of\r\ncounter-forces in a government,\" says Quesnay and his disciples, \"is a\r\nfatal idea. . . The speculations on which the system of counter-balance\r\nis founded are chimerical. . . . Let the government have a full\r\ncomprehension of its duties and be left free. . . The State must govern\r\naccording to the essential laws of order, and in this case unlimited\r\npower is requisite.\" On the approach of the Revolution the same doctrine\r\nreappears, except in the substitution of one term for another term.\r\nIn the place of the sovereignty of the king the \"Contrat social\"\r\nsubstitutes the sovereignty of the people. The latter, however, is much\r\nmore absolute than the former, and, in the democratic convent which\r\nRousseau constructs, on Spartan and Roman model, the individual is\r\nnothing and the State everything.\r\n\r\nIn effect, \"the clauses of the social contract reduce themselves to one,\r\nnamely, the total transfer of each associate with all his rights to the\r\ncommunity.\"[3420] Every one surrenders himself entirely, \"just as he\r\nstands, he and all his forces, of which his property forms a portion.\"\r\nThere is no exception nor reservation; whatever he may have been\r\npreviously and whatever may have belonged to him is no longer his own.\r\nHenceforth whatever he becomes or whatever he may possess devolves\r\non him only through the delegation of the social body, the universal\r\nproprietor and absolute master. All rights must be vested in the State\r\nand none in the individual; otherwise there would be litigation between\r\nthem, and, \"as there is no common superior to decide between them\"\r\ntheir litigation would never end. One the contrary, through the complete\r\ndonation which each one makes of himself, \"the unity is as perfect as\r\npossible;\" having renounced himself \"he has no further claim to make.\"\r\n\r\nThis being admitted let us trace the consequences.--\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I enjoy my property only through tolerance and at\r\nsecond-hand; for, according to the social contract, I have surrendered\r\nit;[3421] \"it now forms a portion of the national estate;\" If I retain\r\nthe use of its for the time being it is through a concession of the\r\nState which makes me a \"depositary\" of it. And this favor must not\r\nbe considered as restitution. \"Far from accepting the property\r\nof individuals society despoils them of it, simply converting\r\nthe usurpation into a veritable right, the enjoyment of it into\r\nproprietorship.\" Previous to the social contract I was possessor not\r\nby right but in fact and even unjustly if I had large possessions;\r\nfor, \"every man has naturally a right to whatever he needs,\" and I have\r\nrobbed other men of all that I possessed beyond my subsistence.\r\nHence, so far from the State being under obligation to me, I am under\r\nobligation to it, the property which it returns to me not being mine but\r\nthat with which the State favors me. It follows, accordingly, that the\r\nState may impose conditions on its gift, limit the use I may make of it,\r\naccording to its fancy, restrict and regulate my disposition of it, my\r\nright to bequeath it. \"According to nature,[3422] the right of property\r\ndoes not extend beyond the life of its owner; the moment he dies his\r\npossessions are no longer his own. Thus, to prescribe the conditions\r\non which he may dispose of it is really less to change his right in\r\nappearance than to extend it in effect.\" In any event as my title is an\r\neffect of the social contract it is precarious like the contract\r\nitself; a new stipulation suffices to limit it or to destroy it. \"The\r\nsovereign[3423] may legitimately appropriate to himself all property, as\r\nwas done in Sparta in the time of Lycurgus.\" In our lay convent whatever\r\neach monk possesses is only a revocable gift by the convent.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, this convent is a seminary. I have no right to\r\nbring up my children in my own house and in my own way.\r\n\r\n\"As the reason of each man[3424] must not be the sole arbiter of his\r\nrights, so much less should the education of children, which is of more\r\nconsequence to the State than to fathers, be left to the intelligence\r\nand prejudice of their fathers.\" \"If public authority, by taking the\r\nplace of fathers, by assuming this important function, then acquires\r\ntheir rights through fulfilling their duties, they have so much the less\r\nreason to complain inasmuch as they merely undergo a change of name,\r\nand, under the title of citizens, exercise in common the same authority\r\nover their children that they have separately exercised under the title\r\nof fathers.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words you cease to be a father, but, in exchange, become a\r\nschool inspector; one is as good as the other, and what complaint have\r\nyou to make? Such was the case in that perpetual army called Sparta;\r\nthere, the children, genuine regimental children, equally obeyed all\r\nproperly formed men.\r\n\r\n\"Thus public education, within laws prescribed by the government and\r\nunder magistrates appointed by sovereign will, is one of the fundamental\r\nmaxims of popular or legitimate government.\"\r\n\r\nThrough this the citizen is formed in Advance.\r\n\r\n\"The government gives the national form to souls.[3425] Nations, in the\r\nlong run, are what the government makes them--soldiers, citizens, men\r\nwhen so disposed, a populace, canaille if it pleases,\" being fashioned\r\nby their education. \"Would you obtain an idea of public education? Read\r\nPlato's 'Republic.'[3426].... The best social institutions are those the\r\nbest qualified to change man's nature, to destroy his absolute being, to\r\ngive him a relative being, and to convert self into the common unity,\r\nso that each individual may not regard himself as one by himself, but\r\na part of the unity, and no longer sensitive but through the whole. An\r\ninfant, on opening its eyes, must behold the common patrimony and, to\r\nthe day of its death, behold that only.... He should be disciplined so\r\nas never to contemplate the individual except in his relations with the\r\nbody of the State.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the practice of Sparta, and the sole aim of the \"great\r\nLycurgus.\" \"All being equal through the law, they must be brought up\r\ntogether and in the same manner.\" \"The law must regulate the subjects,\r\nthe order and the form of their studies.\" They must, at the very least,\r\ntake part in public exercises, in horse-races, in the games of\r\nstrength and of agility instituted \"to accustom them to law, equality,\r\nfraternity, and competition;\" to teach them how \"to live under the eyes\r\nof their fellow-citizens and to crave public applause.\"\r\n\r\nThrough these games they become democrats from their early youth, since,\r\nthe prizes being awarded, not through the arbitrariness of masters,\r\nbut through the cheers of spectators, they accustom themselves to\r\nrecognizing as sovereign the legitimate sovereignty, consisting of the\r\nverdict of the assembled people. The foremost interest of the State is,\r\nalways, to form the wills of those by which it lasts, to prepare the\r\nvotes that are to maintain it, to uproot passions in the soul that might\r\nbe opposed to it, to implant passions that will prove favorable to it,\r\nto fix firmly with the breasts of its future citizens the sentiments and\r\nprejudices it will at some time need.[3427] If it does not secure the\r\nchildren it will not possess the adults, Novices in a convent must be as\r\nmonks, otherwise, when they grow up, the convent will no longer exist.\r\n\r\nFinally, our lay convent has its own religion, a lay religion. If\r\nI possess any other it is through its condescension and under\r\nrestrictions. It is, by nature, hostile to other associations than its\r\nown; they are rivals, they annoy it, they absorb the will and pervert\r\nthe votes of its members.\r\n\r\n\"To ensure a full declaration of the general will it is an important\r\nmatter not to allow any special society in the State, and that each\r\ncitizen should pronounce according to it alone.\"[3428] \"Whatever breaks\r\nup social unity is worthless,\" and it would be better for the State if\r\nthere were no Church.--\r\n\r\nNot only is every church suspicious but, if I am a Christian, my belief\r\nis regarded unfavorably. According to this new legislator \"nothing is\r\nmore opposed to the social spirits than Christianity. . . . A society\r\nof true Christians would no longer form a society of men.\" For, \"the\r\nChristian patrimony is not of this world.\" It cannot zealously serve\r\nthe State, being bound by its conscience to support tyrants. Its law\r\n\"preaches only servitude and dependence. . . it is made for a slave,\"\r\nand never will a citizen be made out of a slave. \"Christian Republic,\r\neach of these two words excludes the other.\" Therefore, if the future\r\nRepublic assents to my profession of Christianity, it is on the\r\nunderstood condition that my doctrine shall be shut up in my mind,\r\nwithout even affecting my heart. If I am a Catholic, (and twenty-five\r\nout of twenty-six million Frenchmen are like me), my condition is worse.\r\nFor the social pact does not tolerate an intolerant religion; any sect\r\nthat condemns other sects is a public enemy; \"whoever presumes to say\r\nthat there is no salvation outside the church, must be driven out of the\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\nShould I be, finally, a free-thinker, a positivist or skeptic, my\r\nsituation is little better.\r\n\r\n\"There is a civil religion,\" a catechism, \"a profession of faith, of\r\nwhich the sovereign has the right to dictate the articles, not exactly\r\nas religious dogmas but as sentiments of social import without which\r\nwe cannot be a good citizen or a loyal subject.\" These articles embrace\r\n\"the existence of a powerful, intelligent, beneficent, foreseeing and\r\nprovident divinity, the future life, the happiness of the righteous, the\r\npunishment of the wicked, the sacredness of the social contract and of\r\nthe laws.[3429] Without forcing anyone to believe in this creed, whoever\r\ndoes not believe in it must be expelled from the State; it is necessary\r\nto banish such persons not on account of impiety, but as unsociable\r\nbeings, incapable of sincerely loving law and justice and, if need be,\r\nof giving up life for duty.\"\r\n\r\nTake heed that this profession of faith be not a vain one, for a new\r\ninquisition is to test its sincerity.\r\n\r\n\"Should any person, after having publicly recognized these dogmas, act\r\nas an unbeliever, let him be punished with death. He has committed the\r\ngreatest of crimes: he has lied before the law.\"\r\n\r\nTruly, as I said above, we are in a convent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Social Contract, Summary.\r\n\r\n     Complete triumph and last excesses of classic reason.--How\r\n     it becomes monomania.--Why its work is not enduring.\r\n\r\nThese articles are all inevitable consequences of the social contract.\r\nThe moment I enter the corporation I abandon my own personality; I\r\nabandon, by this act, my possessions, my children, my church, and my\r\nopinions. I cease to be proprietor, father, Christian and philosopher.\r\nThe state is my substitute in all these functions. In place of my will,\r\nthere is henceforth the public will, that is to say, in theory, the\r\nmutable absolutism of a majority counted by heads, while in fact, it is\r\nthe rigid absolutism of the assembly, the faction, the individual who\r\nis custodian of the public authority.--On this principle an outburst of\r\nboundless conceit takes place. The very first year Grégoire states in\r\nthe tribune of the Constituent Assembly, \"we might change religion if we\r\npleased, but we have no such desire.\" A little later the desire comes,\r\nand it is to be carried out; that of Holbach is proposed, then that of\r\nRousseau, and they dare go much farther. In the name of Reason, of which\r\nthe State alone is the representative and interpreter, they undertake\r\nto unmake and make over, in conformity with Reason and with Reason only,\r\nall customs, festivals, ceremonies, and costumes, the era, the calendar,\r\nweights and measures, the names of the seasons, months, weeks and days,\r\nof places and monuments, family and baptismal names, complimentary\r\ntitles, the tone of discourse, the mode of salutation, of greeting,\r\nof speaking and of writing, in such a fashion, that the Frenchman, as\r\nformerly with the puritan or the Quaker, remodeled even in his inward\r\nsubstance, exposes, through the smallest details of his conduct and\r\nexterior, the dominance of the all-powerful principle which refashions\r\nhis being and the inflexible logic which controls his thoughts. This\r\nconstitutes the final result and complete triumph of the classic spirit.\r\nInstalled in narrow brains, incapable of entertaining two related ideas,\r\nit is to become a cold or furious monomania, fiercely and unrelentingly\r\ndestroying a past it curses, and attempting to establish a millennium,\r\nand all in the name of an illusory contract, at once anarchical and\r\ndespotic, which unfetters insurrection and justifies dictatorship; all\r\nto end in a conflicting social order resembling sometimes a drunken orgy\r\nof demons, and sometimes a Spartan convent; all aimed at replacing the\r\nreal human being, slowly formed by his past with an improvised robot,\r\nwho, through its own debility, will collapse when the external and\r\nmechanical force that keeps it up will no longer sustain it.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3401: Barrère, \"Point du jour,\" No. 1, (June 15, 1789). \"You\r\nare summoned to give history a fresh start.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3402: Condorcet, ibid., \"Tableau des progrès de l'esprit\r\nhumain,\" the tenth epoch. \"The methods of the mathematical sciences,\r\napplied to new objects, have opened new roads to the moral and political\r\nsciences.\"--Cf.

To accuse oneself would amount to self-absolution. There\r\nnever was a street-porter or a silly woman who was not sure of having as\r\nmuch sense as was necessary. We readily recognize in others a\r\nsuperiority in courage, physical strength, experience, agility, or\r\nbeauty. But a superior judgment we concede to nobody.

THE PROPAGATION OF THE DOCTRINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--SUCCESS OF THIS PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE.--FAILURE OF THE SAME\r\nPHILOSOPHY IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nSeveral similar theories have in the past traversed the imagination of\r\nmen, and similar theories are likely do so again. In all ages and in all\r\ncountries, it sufficed that man's concept of his own nature changed for,\r\nas an indirect consequence, new utopias and discoveries would sprout in\r\nthe fields of politics and religion.[4101]--But this does not suffice\r\nfor the propagation of the new doctrine nor, more important, for theory\r\nto be put into practice. Although born in England, the philosophy of the\r\neighteenth century could not develop itself in England; the fever for\r\ndemolition and reconstruction remained but briefly and superficial\r\nthere. Deism, atheism, materialism, skepticism, ideology, the theory of\r\nthe return to nature, the proclamations of the rights of man, all the\r\ntemerities of Bolingbroke, Collins, Toland, Tindal and Mandeville,\r\nthe bold ideas of Hume, Hartley, James Mill and Bentham, all the\r\nrevolutionary doctrines, were so many hotbed plants produced here and\r\nthere, in the isolated studies of a few thinkers: out in the open, after\r\nblooming for a while, subject to a vigorous competition with the old\r\nvegetation to which the soil belonged, they failed[4102].--On the\r\ncontrary, in France, the seed imported from England, takes root and\r\nspreads with extraordinary vigor. After the Regency it is in full\r\nbloom[4103]. Like any species favored by soil and climate, it invades\r\nall the fields, appropriating light and air to itself, scarcely allowing\r\nin its shade a few puny specimens of a hostile species, a survivor of\r\nan antique flora like Rollin, or a specimen of an eccentric flora like\r\nSaint-Martin. With large trees and dense thickets, through masses of\r\nbrushwood and low plants, such as Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau,\r\nDiderot, d'Alembert and Buffon, or Duclos, Mably, Condillac, Turgot,\r\nBeaumarchais, Bernadin de Saint-Pierre, Barthélemy and Thomas, such as a\r\ncrowd of journalists, compilers and conversationalists, or the elite of\r\nthe philosophical, scientific and literary multitude, it occupies the\r\nAcademy, the stage, the drawing room and the debate. All the important\r\npersons of the century are its offshoots, and among these are some of\r\nthe grandest ever produced by humanity.--This was possible because the\r\nseed had fallen on suitable ground, that is to say, on the soil in\r\nthe homeland of the classic spirit. In this land of the raison\r\nraisonnante[4104] it no longer encounters the antagonists who impeded\r\nits growth on the other side of the Channel, and it not only immediately\r\nacquires vigor of sap but the propagating organ which it required as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Propagating Organ, Eloquence.\r\n\r\n     Causes of this difference.--This art of writing in France.--\r\n     Its superiority at this epoch.--It serves as the vehicle of\r\n     new ideas.--Books are written for people of the world.--\r\n     This accounts for philosophy descending to the drawing room.\r\n\r\nThis organ is the \"talent of speech, eloquence applied to the gravest\r\nsubjects, the talent for making things clear.\" [4105]\"The great writers\r\nof this nation,\" says their adversary, \"express themselves better than\r\nthose of any other nation. Their books give but little information to\r\ntrue savants,\" but \"through the art of expression they influence men\"\r\nand \"the mass of men, constantly repelled from the sanctuary of the\r\nsciences by the dry style and bad taste of (other) scientific writers,\r\ncannot resist the seductions of the French style and method.\" Thus the\r\nclassic spirit that furnishes the ideas likewise furnishes the means of\r\nconveying them, the theories of the eighteenth century being like those\r\nseeds provided with wings which float and distribute themselves on all\r\nsoils. There is no book of that day not written for people of the high\r\nsociety, and even for women of this class. In Fontenelle's dialogues\r\non the Plurality of worlds the principal person age is a marchioness.\r\nVoltaire composes his \"Métaphysique\" and his \"Essai sur les Moeurs\"\r\nfor Madame du Chatelet, and Rousseau his \"Emile\" for Madame d'Epinay.\r\nCondillac wrote the \"Traité des Sensations\" from suggestions of\r\nMademoiselle Ferrand, and he sets forth instructions to young ladies\r\nhow to read his \"Logique.\" Baudeau dedicates and explains to a lady his\r\n\"Tableau Economique.\" Diderot's most profound work is a conversation\r\nbetween Mademoiselle de l'Espinasse and d'Alembert and Bordeu[4106].\r\nMontesquieu had placed an invocation to the muses in the middle of the\r\n\"Esprit des Lois.\" Almost every work is a product of the drawing-room,\r\nand it is always one that, before the public, has been presented with\r\nits beginnings. In this respect the habit is so strong as to last up to\r\nthe end of 1789; the harangues about to be made in the National Assembly\r\nare also passages of bravura previously rehearsed before ladies at\r\nan evening entertainment. The American Ambassador, a practical man,\r\nexplains to Washington with sober irony the fine academic and literary\r\nparade preceding the political tournament in public[4107].\r\n\r\n\"The speeches are made beforehand in a small society of young men and\r\nwomen, among them generally the fair friend of the speaker is one, or\r\nelse the fair whom he means to make his friend,; and the society very\r\npolitely give their approbation, unless the lady who gives the tone to\r\nthat circle chances to reprehend something, which is of course altered,\r\nif not amended.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, with customs of this kind, that professional\r\nphilosophers should become men of society. At no time or in any place\r\nhave they been so to the same extent, nor so habitually. The great\r\ndelight of a man of genius or of learning here, says an English\r\ntraveler, is to reign over a brilliant assembly of people of\r\nfashion[4108]. Whilst in England they bury themselves morosely in\r\ntheir books, living amongst themselves and appearing in society only\r\non condition of \"doing some political drudgery,\" that of journalist or\r\npamphleteer in the service of a party, in France they dine out every\r\nevening, and constitute the ornaments and amusement of the drawing-rooms\r\nto which they resort to converse[4109]. There is not a house in which\r\ndinners are given that has not its titular philosopher, and, later on,\r\nits economist and man of science. In the various memoirs, and in the\r\ncollections of correspondence, we track them from one drawing room to\r\nanother, from one chateau to another, Voltaire to Cirey at Madame\r\ndu Chatelet's, and then home, at Ferney where he has a theater and\r\nentertains all Europe; Rousseau to Madame d'Epinay's, and M. de\r\nLuxembourg's; the Abbé Barthelemy to the Duchesse de Choiseul's;\r\nThomas, Marmontel and Gibbon to Madame Necker's; the encyclopedists to\r\nd'Holbach's ample dinners, to the plain and discreet table of Madame\r\nGeoffrin, and to the little drawing room of Mademoiselle de L'Espinasse,\r\nall belonging to the great central state drawing-room, that is to say,\r\nto the French Academy, where each newly elected member appears to parade\r\nhis style and obtain from a polished body his commission of master in\r\nthe art of discourse. Such a public imposes on an author the obligation\r\nof being more a writer than a philosopher. The thinker is expected to\r\nconcern himself with his sentences as much as with his ideas. He is not\r\nallowed to be a mere scholar in his closet, a simple erudite, diving\r\ninto folios in German fashion, a metaphysician absorbed with his own\r\nmeditations, having an audience of pupils who take notes, and, as\r\nreaders, men devoted to study and willing to give themselves trouble, a\r\nKant, who forms for himself a special language, who waits for a public\r\nto comprehend him and who leaves the room in which he labors only\r\nfor the lecture-room in which he delivers his lectures. Here, on\r\nthe contrary, in the matter of expression, all are experts and even\r\nprofessional. The mathematician d'Alembert publishes a small treatise on\r\nelocution; Buffon, the naturalist pronounces a discourse on Style;\r\nthe legist Montesquieu composes an essay on Taste; the psychologist\r\nCondillac writes a volume on the art of writing. In this consists their\r\ngreatest glory; philosophy owes its entry into society to them. They\r\nwithdrew it from the study, the closed-society and the school, to\r\nintroduce it into company and into conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Its Method.\r\n\r\nOwing to this method it becomes popular.\r\n\r\n\"Madame la Maréchale,\" says one of Diderot's personages,[4110]. \"I must\r\nconsider things from a somewhat higher point of view.\"--\"As high as you\r\nplease so long as I understand you.\"--\"If you do not understand me it\r\nwill be my fault.\"--\"You are very polite, but you must know that I have\r\nstudied nothing but my prayer book.\"--That makes no difference; the\r\npretty woman, ably led on, begins to philosophize without knowing\r\nit, arriving without effort at the distinction between good and evil,\r\ncomprehending and deciding on the highest doctrines of morality and\r\nreligion.--Such is the art of the eighteenth century, and the art of\r\nwriting. People are addressed who are perfectly familiar with life,\r\nbut who are commonly ignorant of orthography, who are curious in all\r\ndirections, but ill prepared for any; the object is to bring truth down\r\nto their level[4111]. Scientific or too abstract terms are inadmissible;\r\nthey tolerate only those used to ordinary conversation. And this is no\r\nobstacle; it is easier to talk philosophy in this language than to\r\nuse it for discussing precedence and clothes. For, in every abstract\r\nquestion there is some leading and simple conception on which the rest\r\ndepends, those of unity, proportion, mass and motion in mathematics;\r\nthose of organ, function and being in physiology; those of sensation,\r\npain, pleasure and desire in psychology; those of utility, contract\r\nand law in politics and morality; those of capital, production, value,\r\nexchange in political economy, and the same in the other sciences, all\r\nof these being conceptions derived from passing experience; from which\r\nit follows that, in appealing to common experience by means of a few\r\nfamiliar circumstances, such as short stories, anecdotes, agreeable\r\ntales, and the like, these conceptions are fashioned anew and rendered\r\nprecise. This being accomplished, almost everything is accomplished; for\r\nnothing then remains but to lead the listener along step by step, flight\r\nby flight, to the remotest consequences.\r\n\r\n\"Will Madame la Maréchale have the kindness to recall\r\nmy definition?\"--\"I remember it well-do you call that a\r\ndefinition?\"--\"Yes.\"--\"That, then, is philosophy!\"--\"Admirable!\"--\"And\r\nI have been philosophical?\"--\"As you read prose, without being aware of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest is simply a matter of reasoning, that is to say, of leading\r\non, of putting questions in the right order, and of analysis. With\r\nthe conception thus renewed and rectified the truth nearest at hand is\r\nbrought out, then out of this, a second truth related to the first one,\r\nand so on to the end, no other obligation being involved in this\r\nmethod but that of carefully advancing step by step, and of omitting no\r\nintermediary step.--With this method one is able to explain all, to make\r\neverything understood, even by women, and even by women of society. In\r\nthe eighteenth century it forms the substance of all talents, the\r\nwarp of all masterpieces, the lucidity, popularity and authority of\r\nphilosophy. The \"Eloges\" of Fontenelle, the \"Philosophe ignorant et le\r\nprincipe d'action\" by Voltaire, the \"Lettre à M. de Beaumont,\" and the\r\n\"Vicaire Savoyard\" by Rousseau, the \"Traité de l'homme\" and the \"Époques\r\nde la Nature\" by Buffon, the \"Dialogues sur les blés\" by Galiani, the\r\n\"Considérations\" by d'Alembert, on mathematics, the \"Langue des Calculs\"\r\nand the \"Logique\" by Condillac, and, a little later, the \"Exposition\r\ndu système du Monde\" by Laplace, and \"Discours généraux\" by Bichat and\r\nCuvier; all are based on this method[4112]. Finally, this is the method\r\nwhich Condillac erects into a theory under the name of ideology, soon\r\nacquiring the ascendancy of a dogma, and which then seems to sum up\r\nall methods. At the very least it sums up the process by which the\r\nphilosophers of the century obtained their audience, propagated their\r\ndoctrine and achieved their success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Its Popularity.\r\n\r\n     Owing to style it becomes pleasing.--Two stimulants peculiar\r\n     to the 18th century, coarse humor and irony.\r\n\r\nThanks to this method one can be understood; but, to be read, something\r\nmore is necessary. I compare the eighteenth century to a company of\r\npeople around a table; it is not sufficient that the food before them be\r\nwell prepared, well served, within reach and easy to digest, but it\r\nis important that it should be some choice dish or, better still,\r\nsome dainty. The intellect is Epicurean; let us supply it with savory,\r\ndelicate viands adapted to its taste; it will eat so much the more owing\r\nto its appetite being sharpened by sensuality. Two special condiments\r\nenter into the cuisine of this century, and, according to the hand that\r\nmakes use of them, they furnish all literary dishes with a coarse or\r\ndelicate seasoning. In an Epicurean society, to which a return to nature\r\nand the rights of instinct are preached, voluptuous images and ideas\r\npresent themselves involuntarily; this is the appetizing, exciting\r\nspice-box. Each guest at the table uses or abuses it; many empty its\r\nentire contents on their plate. And I do not allude merely to the\r\nliterature read in secret, to the extraordinary books Madame d'Audlan,\r\ngoverness to the French royal children, peruses, and which stray off\r\ninto the hands of the daughters of Louis XV,[4113] nor to other books,\r\nstill more extraordinary,[4114] in which philosophical arguments appear\r\nas an interlude between filth and the illustrations, and which are kept\r\nby the ladies of the court on their toilet-tables, under the title of\r\n\"Heures de Paris.\" I refer here to the great men, to the masters of the\r\npublic intellect. With the exception of Buffon, all put pimento into\r\ntheir sauces, that is to say, loose talk or coarseness of expression. We\r\nfind this even in the\" Esprit des Lois;\" there is an enormous amount of\r\nit, open and covered up, in the \"Lettres Persanes.\" Diderot, in his two\r\ngreat novels, puts it in by handfuls, as if during an orgy. The teeth\r\ncrunch on it like so many grains of pepper, on every page of Voltaire.\r\nWe find it, not only piquant, but strong and of burning intensity,\r\nin the \"Nouvelle Héloïse,\" scores of times in \"Emile,\" and, in the\r\n\"Confessions,\" from one end to the other. It was the taste of the day.\r\nM. de Malesherbes, so upright and so grave, committed \"La Pucelle\" to\r\nmemory and recited it. We have from the pen of Saint-Just, the gloomiest\r\nof the \"Mountain,\" a poem as lascivious as that of Voltaire, while\r\nMadame Roland, the noblest of the Girondins, has left us confessions as\r\nventuresome and specific as those of Rousseau[4115].--On the other hand\r\nthere is a second box, that containing the old Gallic salt, that is\r\nto say, humor and raillery. Its mouth is wide open in the hands of a\r\nphilosophy proclaiming the sovereignty of reason. Whatever is contrary\r\nto Reason is to it absurd and therefore open to ridicule. The moment the\r\nsolemn hereditary mask covering up an abuse is brusquely and adroitly\r\ntorn aside, we feel a curious spasm, the corners of our mouth stretching\r\napart and our breast heaving violently, as at a kind of sudden relief,\r\nan unexpected deliverance, experiencing a sense of our recovered\r\nsuperiority, of our revenge being gratified and of an act of justice\r\nhaving been performed. But it depends on the mode in which the mask is\r\nstruck off whether the laugh shall be in turn light or loud, suppressed\r\nor unbridled, now amiable and cheerful, or now bitter and sardonic.\r\nHumor (la plaisanterie) comports with all aspects, from buffoonery to\r\nindignation; no literary seasoning affords such a variety, or so\r\nmany mixtures, nor one that so well enters into combination with that\r\nabove-mentioned. The two together, from the middle ages down, form the\r\nprincipal ingredients employed by the French cuisine in the composition\r\nof its most agreeable dainties,--fables, tales, witticisms, jovial songs\r\nand waggeries, the eternal heritage of a good-humored, mocking\r\npeople, preserved by La Fontaine athwart the pomp and sobriety of the\r\nseventeenth century, and, in the eighteenth, reappearing everywhere at\r\nthe philosophic banquet. Its charm is great to the brilliant company at\r\nthis table, so amply provided, whose principal occupation is pleasure\r\nand amusement. It is all the greater because, on this occasion, the\r\npassing disposition is in harmony with hereditary instinct, and because\r\nthe taste of the epoch is fortified by the national taste. Add to all\r\nthis the exquisite art of the cooks, their talent in commingling, in\r\napportioning and in concealing the condiments, in varying and arranging\r\nthe dishes, the certainty of their hand, the finesse of their palate,\r\ntheir experience in processes, in the traditions and practices which,\r\nalready for a hundred years, form of French prose the most delicate\r\nnourishment of the intellect. It is not strange to find them skilled in\r\nregulating human speech, in extracting from it its quintessence and in\r\ndistilling its full delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Masters.\r\n\r\n     The art and processes of the masters.--Montesquieu.--\r\n     Voltaire.--Diderot.--Rousseau.--\"The Marriage of Figaro.\"\r\n\r\nIn this respect four among them are superior, Montesquieu, Voltaire,\r\nDiderot and Rousseau. It seems sufficient to mention their names. Modern\r\nEurope has no greater writers. And yet their talent must be closely\r\nexamined to properly comprehend their power.--In tone and style\r\nMontesquieu is the first. No writer is more master of himself, more\r\noutwardly calm, more sure of his meaning. His voice is never boisterous;\r\nhe expresses the most powerful thoughts with moderation. There is no\r\ngesticulation; exclamations, the abandonment of impulse, all that is\r\nirreconcilable with decorum is repugnant to his tact, his reserve, his\r\ndignity. He seems to be always addressing a select circle of people\r\nwith acute minds, and in such a way as to render them at every moment\r\nconscious of their acuteness. No flattery could be more delicate; we\r\nfeel grateful to him for making us satisfied with our intelligence.\r\nWe must possess some intelligence to be able to read him, for he\r\ndeliberately curtails developments and omits transitions; we are\r\nrequired to supply these and to comprehend his hidden meanings. He is\r\nrigorously systematic but the system is concealed, his concise completed\r\nsentences succeeding each other separately, like so many precious\r\ncoffers or caskets, now simple and plain in aspect, now superbly chased\r\nand decorated, but always full. Open them and each contains a treasure;\r\nhere is placed in narrow compass a rich store of reflections, of\r\nemotions, of discoveries, our enjoyment being the more intense because\r\nwe can easily retain all this for a moment in the palm of our hand.\r\n\"That which usually forms a grand conception,\" he himself says, \"is\r\na thought so expressed as to reveal a number of other thoughts, and\r\nsuddenly disclosing what we could not anticipate without patient study.\"\r\nThis, indeed, is his manner; he thinks with summaries; he concentrates\r\nthe essence of despotism in a chapter of three lines. The summary itself\r\noften bears the air of an enigma, of which the charm is twofold; we have\r\nthe pleasure of comprehension accompanying the satisfaction of divining.\r\nIn all subjects he maintains this supreme discretion, this art of\r\nindicating without enforcing, these reticences, the smile that never\r\nbecomes a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"In my defense of the 'Esprit des Lois,\"' he says, \"that which gratifies\r\nme is not to see venerable theologians crushed to the ground but to see\r\nthem glide down gently.\"\r\n\r\nHe excels in tranquil irony, in polished disdain,[4116] in disguised\r\nsarcasm. His Persians judge France as Persians, and we smile at\r\ntheir errors; unfortunately the laugh is not against them but against\r\nourselves, for their error is found to be a verity[4117]. This or\r\nthat letter, in a sober vein, seems a comedy at their expense\r\nwithout reflecting upon us, full of Muslim prejudices and of oriental\r\nconceit;[4118] reflect a moment, and our conceit, in this relation,\r\nappears no less. Blows of extraordinary force and reach are given in\r\npassing, as if thoughtlessly, against existing institutions, against the\r\ntransformed Catholicism which \"in the present state of Europe, cannot\r\nlast five hundred years,\" against the degenerate monarchy which causes\r\nuseful citizens to starve to fatten parasite courtiers[4119]. The entire\r\nnew philosophy blooms out in his hands with an air of innocence, in a\r\npastoral romance, in a simple prayer, in an artless letter[4120]. None\r\nof the gifts which serve to arrest and fix the attention are wanting\r\nin this style, neither grandeur of imagination nor profound sentiment,\r\nvivid characterization, delicate gradations, vigorous precision, a\r\nsportive grace, unlooked-for burlesque, nor variety of representation.\r\nBut, amidst so many ingenious tricks, apologues, tales, portraits and\r\ndialogues, in earnest as well as when masquerading, his deportment\r\nthroughout is irreproachable and his tone is perfect. If; as an author,\r\nhe develops a paradox it is with almost English gravity. If he\r\nfully exposes indecency it is with decent terms. In the full tide of\r\nbuffoonery, as well as in the full blast of license, he is ever the\r\nwell-bred man, born and brought up in the aristocratic circle in which\r\nfull liberty is allowed but where good-breeding is supreme, where\r\nevery idea is permitted but where words are weighed, where one has the\r\nprivilege of saying what he pleases, but on condition that he never\r\nforgets himself.\r\n\r\nA circle of this kind is a small one, comprising only a select few;\r\nto be understood by the multitude requires another tone of voice.\r\nPhilosophy demands a writer whose principal occupation is a diffusion of\r\nit, who is unable to keep it to himself; who pours it out like a gushing\r\nfountain, who offers it to everybody, daily and in every form, in broad\r\nstreams and in small drops, without exhaustion or weariness, through\r\nevery crevice and by every channel, in prose, in verse, in imposing and\r\nin trifling poems, in the drama, in history, in novels, in pamphlets, in\r\npleadings, in treatises, in essays, in dictionaries, in correspondence,\r\nopenly and in secret, in order that it may penetrate to all depths and\r\nin every soil; such was Voltaire.--\"I have accomplished more in my\r\nday,\" he says somewhere, \"than either Luther or Calvin,\" in which he is\r\nmistaken. The truth is, however, he has something of their spirit. Like\r\nthem he is desirous of changing the prevailing religion, he takes\r\nthe attitude of the founder of a sect, he recruits and binds together\r\nproselytes, he writes letters of exhortation, of direction and of\r\npredication, he puts watchwords in circulation, he furnishes \"the\r\nbrethren\" with a device; his passion resembles the zeal of an apostle or\r\nof a prophet. Such a spirit is incapable of reserve; it is militant and\r\nfiery by nature; it apostrophizes, reviles and improvises; it writes\r\nunder the dictation of impressions; it allows itself every species of\r\nutterance and, if need be, the coarsest. It thinks by explosions; its\r\nemotions are sudden starts, and its images so many sparks; it lets the\r\nrein go entirely; it gives itself up to the reader and hence it takes\r\npossession of him. Resistance is impossible; the contagion is too\r\noverpowering. A creature of air and flame, the most excitable that ever\r\nlived, composed of more ethereal and more throbbing atoms than those of\r\nother men; none is there whose mental machinery is more delicate, nor\r\nwhose equilibrium is at the same time more shifting and more exact. He\r\nmay be compared to those accurate scales that are affected by a breath,\r\nbut alongside of which every other measuring apparatus is incorrect and\r\nclumsy.--But, in this delicate balance only the lightest weights, the\r\nfinest specimen must be placed; on this condition only it rigorously\r\nweighs all substances; such is Voltaire, involuntarily, through the\r\ndemands of his intellect, and in his own behalf as much as in that of\r\nhis readers. An entire philosophy, ten volumes of theology, an abstract\r\nscience, a special library, an important branch of erudition, of human\r\nexperience and invention, is thus reduced in his hands to a phrase or to\r\na stanza. From the enormous mass of riven or compact scorioe he extracts\r\nwhatever is essential, a grain of gold or of copper as a specimen of the\r\nrest, presenting this to us in its most convenient and most manageable\r\nform, in a simile, in a metaphor, in an epigram that becomes a proverb.\r\nIn this no ancient or modern writer approaches him; in simplification\r\nand in popularization he has not his equal in the world. Without\r\ndeparting from the usual conversational tone, and as if in sport,\r\nhe puts into little portable phrases the greatest discoveries and\r\nhypotheses of the human mind, the theories of Descartes, Malebranche,\r\nLeibnitz, Locke and Newton, the diverse religions of antiquity and\r\nof modern times, every known system of physics, physiology, geology,\r\nmorality, natural law, and political economy,[4121] in short, all the\r\ngeneralized conceptions in every order of knowledge to which humanity\r\nhad attained in the eighteenth century.--Voltaire's inclination is\r\nso strong that it carries him too far; he belittles great things by\r\nrendering them accessible. Religion, legend, ancient popular poesy, the\r\nspontaneous creations of instinct, the vague visions of primitive tunes\r\nare not thus to be converted into small current coin; they are not\r\nsubjects of amusing and lively conversation. A piquant witticism is not\r\nan expression of all this, but simply a travesty. But how charming to\r\nFrenchmen, and to people of the world! And what reader can abstain from\r\na book containing all human knowledge summed up in piquant witticisms?\r\nFor it is really a summary of human knowledge, no important idea, as\r\nfar as I can see, being wanting to a man whose breviary consisted of the\r\n\"Dialogues,\" the \"Dictionary,\" and the \"Novels.\" Read them over and over\r\nfive or six times, and we then form some idea of their vast contents.\r\nNot only do views of the world and of man abound in them, but again\r\nthey swarm with positive and even technical details, thousands of little\r\nfacts scattered throughout, multiplied and precise details on astronomy,\r\nphysics, geography, physiology, statistics, and on the history of all\r\nnations, the innumerable and personal experiences of a man who has\r\nhimself read the texts, handled the instruments, visited the countries,\r\ntaken part in the industries, and associated with the persons, and\r\nwho, in the precision of his marvelous memory, in the liveliness of\r\nhis ever-blazing imagination, revives or sees, as with the eye itself,\r\neverything that he states and as he states it. It is a unique talent,\r\nthe rarest in a classic era, the most precious of all, since it\r\nconsists in the display of actual beings, not through the gray veil of\r\nabstractions, but in themselves, as they are in nature and in history,\r\nwith their visible color and forms, with their accessories and\r\nsurroundings in time and space, a peasant at his cart, a Quaker in\r\nhis meeting-house, a German baron in his castle, Dutchmen, Englishmen,\r\nSpaniards, Italians, Frenchmen, in their homes,[4122] a great lady, a\r\ndesigning woman, provincials, soldiers, prostitutes,[4123] and the\r\nrest of the human medley, on every step of the social ladder, each an\r\nabridgment of his kind and in the passing light of a sudden flash.\r\n\r\nFor, the most striking feature of this style is the prodigious rapidity,\r\nthe dazzling and bewildering stream of novelties, ideas, images, events,\r\nlandscapes, narratives, dialogues, brief little pictures, following\r\neach other rapidly as if in a magic-lantern, withdrawn almost as soon\r\nas presented by the impatient magician who, in the twinkling of an eye,\r\ngirdles the world and, constantly accumulating one on top of the other,\r\nhistory, fable, truth and fancy, the present time and times past, frames\r\nhis work now with a parade as absurd as that of a country fair, and\r\nnow with a fairy scene more magnificent than all those of the opera. To\r\namuse and be amused, \"to diffuse his spirit in every imaginable mode,\r\nlike a glowing furnace into which all substances are thrown by turns to\r\nevolve every species of flame, sparkle and odor,\" is his first instinct.\r\n\"Life,\" he says again, \"is an infant to be rocked until it goes\r\nto sleep.\" Never was a mortal more excited and more exciting, more\r\nincapable of silence and more hostile to ennui,[4124] better endowed for\r\nconversation, more evidently destined to become the king of a sociable\r\ncentury in which, with six pretty stories, thirty witticisms and some\r\nconfidence in himself, a man could obtain a social passport and\r\nthe certainty of being everywhere welcome. Never was there a writer\r\npossessing to so high a degree and in such abundance every qualification\r\nof the conversationalist, the art of animating and of enlivening\r\ndiscourse, the talent for giving pleasure to people of society.\r\nPerfectly refined when he chose to be, confining himself without\r\ninconvenience to strict decorum, of finished politeness, of exquisite\r\ngallantry, deferential without being servile, fond without being\r\nmawkish,[4125] and always at his ease, it suffices that he should be\r\nbefore the public, to fall naturally into the proper tone, the discreet\r\nways, the winning half-smile of the well-bred man who, introducing his\r\nreaders into his mind, does them the honors of the place. Are you on\r\nfamiliar terms with him, and of the small private circle in which he\r\nfreely unbends himself, with closed doors? You never tire of laughing.\r\nWith a sure hand and without seeming to touch it, he abruptly tears\r\naside the veil hiding a wrong, a prejudice, a folly, in short, any human\r\nidolatry. The real figure, misshapen, odious or dull, suddenly appears\r\nin this instantaneous flash; we shrug our shoulders. This is the\r\nrisibility of an agile, triumphant reason. We have another in that\r\nof the gay temperament, of the droll improvisator, of the man keeping\r\nyouthful, a child, a boy even to the day of his death, and who \"gambols\r\non his own tombstone.\" He is fond of caricature, exaggerating the\r\nfeatures of faces, bringing grotesques on the stage,[4126] walking them\r\nabout in all lights like marionettes, never weary of taking them up\r\nand of making them dance in new costumes; in the very midst of his\r\nphilosophy, of his propaganda and polemics, he sets up his portable\r\ntheater in full blast, exhibiting oddities, the scholar, the monk, the\r\ninquisitor, Maupertuis, Pompignan, Nonotte, Fréron, King David, and\r\ncountless others who appear before us, capering and gesticulating in\r\ntheir harlequin attire.--When a farcical talent is thus moved to tell\r\nthe truth, humor becomes all-powerful; for it gratifies the profound and\r\nuniversal instincts of human nature: to the malicious curiosity, to the\r\ndesire to mock and belitte, to the aversion to being in need or under\r\nconstraint, those sources of bad moods which task convention, etiquette\r\nand social obligation with wearing the burdensome cloak of respect and\r\nof decency; moments occur in life when the wisest is not sorry to throw\r\nthis half aside and even cast it off entirely.--On each page, now with\r\nthe bold stroke of a hardy naturalist, now with the quick turn of a\r\nmischievous monkey, Voltaire lets the solemn or serious drapery fall,\r\ndisclosing man, the poor biped, and in which attitudes![4127] Swift\r\nalone dared to present similar pictures. What physiological crudities\r\nrelating to the origin and end of our most exalted sentiments! What\r\ndisproportion between such feeble reason and such powerful instincts!\r\nWhat recesses in the wardrobes of politics and religion concealing their\r\nfoul linen! We laugh at all this so as not to weep, and yet behind this\r\nlaughter there are tears; he ends sneeringly, subsiding into a tone\r\nof profound sadness, of mournful pity. In this degree, and with such\r\nsubjects, it is only an effect of habit, or as an expedient, a mania of\r\ninspiration, a fixed condition of the nervous machinery rushing headlong\r\nover everything, without a break and in full speed. Gaiety, let it not\r\nbe forgotten, is still a incentive of action, the last that keeps man\r\nerect in France, the best in maintaining the tone of his spirit, his\r\nstrength and his powers of resistance, the most intact in an age when\r\nmen, and women too, believed it incumbent on them to die people of good\r\nsociety, with a smile and a jest on their lips[4128].\r\n\r\nWhen the talent of a writer thus accords with public inclinations it\r\nis a matter of little import whether he deviates or fails since he is\r\nfollowing the universal tendency. He may wander off or besmirch himself\r\nin vain, for his audience is only the more pleased, his defects serving\r\nhim as advantageously as his good qualities. After the first generation\r\nof healthy minds the second one comes on, the intellectual balance here\r\nbeing equally inexact. \"Diderot,\" says Voltaire, \"is too hot an oven,\r\neverything that is baked in it getting burnt.\" Or rather, he is an\r\neruptive volcano which, for forty years, discharges ideas of every order\r\nand species, boiling and fused together, precious metals, coarse scorioe\r\nand fetid mud; the steady stream overflows at will according to the\r\nroughness of the ground, but always displaying the ruddy light and acrid\r\nfumes of glowing lava. He is not master of his ideas, but his ideas\r\nmaster him; he is under submission to them; he has not that firm\r\nfoundation of common practical sense which controls their impetuosity\r\nand ravages, that inner dyke of social caution which, with Montesquieu\r\nand Voltaire, bars the way to outbursts. Everything with him rushes\r\nout of the surcharged crater, never picking its way, through the first\r\nfissure or crevice it finds, according to his haphazard reading, a\r\nletter, a conversation, an improvisation, and not in frequent small jets\r\nas with Voltaire, but in broad currents tumbling blindly down the most\r\nprecipitous declivities of the century. Not only does he descend thus\r\nto the very depths of anti-religious and anti-social doctrines,\r\nwith logical and paradoxical rigidity, more impetuously and more\r\nobstreperously than d'Holbach himself; but again he falls into and\r\nsports himself in the slime of the age, consisting of obscenity, and\r\ninto the beaten track of declamation. In his leading novels he dwells a\r\nlong time on salacious equivocation, or on a scene of lewdness. Crudity\r\nwith him is not extenuated by malice or glossed over by elegance. He\r\nis neither refined nor pungent; is quite incapable, like the younger\r\nCrébillon, of depicting the scapegrace of ability. He is a new-comer,\r\na parvenu in standard society; you see in him a commoner, a powerful\r\nreasoner, an indefatigable workman and great artist, introduced, through\r\nthe customs of the day, at a supper of fashionable livers. He engrosses\r\nthe conversation, directs the orgy, or in the contagion or on a wager,\r\nsays more filthy things, more \"gueulées,\" than all the guests put\r\ntogether[4129]. In like manner, in his dramas, in his \"Essays on\r\nClaudius and Nero,\" in his \"Commentary on Seneca,\" in his additions to\r\nthe \"Philosophical History\" of Raynal, he forces the tone of things.\r\nThis tone, which then prevails by virtue of the classic spirit and of\r\nthe new fashion, is that of sentimental rhetoric. Diderot carries it to\r\nextremes in the exaggeration of tears or of rage, in exclamations, in\r\napostrophes, in tenderness of feeling, in violences, indignation, in\r\nenthusiasms, in full-orchestra tirades, in which the fire of his brains\r\nfinds employment and an outlet.--On the other hand, among so many\r\nsuperior writers, he is the only genuine artist, the creator of souls,\r\nwithin his mind objects, events and personages are born and become\r\norganized of themselves, through their own forces, by virtue of natural\r\naffinities, involuntarily, without foreign intervention, in such a way\r\nas to live for and in themselves, safe from the author's intentions, and\r\noutside of his combinations. The composer of the \"Salons,\" the \"Petits\r\nRomans,\" the \"Entretien,\" the \"Paradoxe du Comédien,\" and especially\r\nthe \"Rêve de d'Alembert\" and the \"Neveu de Rameau \"is a man of an unique\r\nspecies in his time. However alert and brilliant Voltaire's personages\r\nmay be, they are always puppets; their action is derivative; always\r\nbehind them you catch a glimpse of the author pulling the strings. With\r\nDiderot, the strings are severed; he is not speaking through the lips of\r\nhis characters; they are not his comical loud-speakers or puppets,\r\nbut independent and detached persons, with an action of their own,\r\na personal accent, with their own temperament, passions, ideas,\r\nphilosophy, style and spirit, and occasionally, as in the \"Neveu de\r\nRameau,\" a spirit so original, complex and complete, so alive and so\r\ndeformed that, in the natural history of man, it becomes an incomparable\r\nmonster and an immortal document. He has expressed everything concerning\r\nnature,[4130] art morality and life[4131] in two small treatises of\r\nwhich twenty successive readings exhaust neither the charm nor the\r\nsense. Find elsewhere, if you can, a similar stroke of power\r\nand a greater masterpiece, \"anything more absurd and more\r\nprofound!\"[4132]--Such is the advantage of men of genius possessing\r\nno control over themselves. They lack discernment but they have\r\ninspiration. Among twenty works, either soiled, rough or nasty, they\r\nproduce a creation, and still better, an animated being, able to live by\r\nitself, before which others, fabricated by merely intellectual people,\r\nresemble simply well-dressed puppets.--Hence it is that Diderot is so\r\ngreat a narrator, a master of dialogue, the equal in this respect of\r\nVoltaire, and, through a quite opposite talent, believing all he says at\r\nthe moment of saying it; forgetful of his very self, carried away by his\r\nown recital, listening to inward voices, surprised with the responses\r\nwhich come to him unexpectedly, borne along, as if on an unknown\r\nriver, by the current of action, by the sinuosities of the conversation\r\ninwardly and unconsciously developed, aroused by the flow of ideas\r\nand the leap of the moment to the most unexpected imagery, extreme in\r\nburlesque or extreme in magnificence, now lyrical even to providing\r\nMusset with an entire stanza,[4133] now comic and droll with outbursts\r\nunheard of since the days of Rabelais, always in good faith, always at\r\nthe mercy of his subject, of his inventions, of his emotions; the most\r\nnatural of writers in an age of artificial literature, resembling a\r\nforeign tree which, transplanted to a parterre of the epoch, swells out\r\nand decays on one side of its stem, but of which five or six branches,\r\nthrust out into full light, surpass the neighboring underwood in the\r\nfreshness of their sap and in the vigor of their growth.\r\n\r\nRousseau also is an artisan, a man of the people, ill-adapted to elegant\r\nand refined society, out of his element in a drawing room and, moreover,\r\nof low birth, badly brought up, sullied by a vile and precocious\r\nexperience, highly and offensively sensual, morbid in mind and in body,\r\nfretted by superior and discordant faculties, possessing no tact, and\r\ncarrying the contamination of his imagination, temperament and past life\r\ninto his austere morality and into his purest idylls;[4134] besides this\r\nhe has no fervor, and in this he is the opposite of Diderot, avowing\r\nhimself\" that his ideas arrange themselves in his head with the utmost\r\ndifficulty, that certain sentences are turned over and over again in his\r\nbrain for five or six nights before putting them on paper, and that a\r\nletter on the most trifling subject costs him hours of fatigue,\" that he\r\ncannot fall into an easy and agreeable tone, nor succeed otherwise than\r\n\"in works which demand application.\"[4135] As an offset to this,\r\nstyle, in this ardent brain, under the influence of intense, prolonged\r\nmeditation, incessantly hammered and rehammered, becomes more concise\r\nand of higher temper than is elsewhere found. Since La Bruyère we\r\nhave seen no more ample, virile phrases, in which anger, admiration,\r\nindignation, studied and concentrated passion, appear with more rigorous\r\nprecision and more powerful relief. He is almost the equal of La Bruyère\r\nin the arrangement of skillful effects, in the aptness and ingenuity\r\nof developments, in the terseness of impressive summaries, in the\r\noverpowering directness of unexpected arguments, in the multiplicity of\r\nliterary achievements, in the execution of those passages of bravura,\r\nportraits, descriptions, comparisons, creations, wherein, as in a\r\nmusical crescendo, the same idea, varied by a series of yet more\r\nanimated expressions, attains to or surpasses, at the last note, all\r\nthat is possible of energy and of brilliancy. Finally, he has that which\r\nis wanting in La Bruyère; his passages are linked together; he is not\r\na writer of pages but of books; no logician is more condensed. His\r\ndemonstration is knitted together, mesh by mesh, for one, two and three\r\nvolumes like a great net without an opening in which, willingly or not,\r\nwe remain caught. He is a systematizer who, absorbed with himself; and\r\nwith his eyes stubbornly fixed on his own reverie or his own principle,\r\nburies himself deeper in it every day, weaving its consequences off one\r\nby one, and always holding fast to the various ends. Do not go near him.\r\nLike a solitary, enraged spider he weaves this out of his own substance,\r\nout of the most cherished convictions of his brain and the deepest\r\nemotions of his heart. He trembles at the slightest touch; ever on the\r\ndefensive, he is terrible,[4136] beside himself;[4137] even venomous\r\nthrough suppressed exasperation and wounded sensibility, furious against\r\nan adversary, whom he stifles with the multiplied and tenacious threads\r\nof his web, but still more redoubtable to himself than to his enemies,\r\nsoon caught in his own meshes,[4138] believing that France and the\r\nuniverse conspire against him, deducing with wonderful subtlety the\r\nproofs of this chimerical conspiracy, made desperate, at last, by his\r\nover-plausible romance, and strangling in the cunning toils which, by\r\ndint of his own logic and imagination, he has fashioned for himself.\r\n\r\nWith such weapons one might accidentally kill oneself, but one is\r\nstrongly armed. Rousseau was well equipped, at least as powerful as\r\nVoltaire; it may be said that the last half of the eighteenth century\r\nbelongs to him. A foreigner, a Protestant, original in temperament, in\r\neducation, in heart, in mind and in habits, at once misanthropic and\r\nphilanthropic, living in an ideal world constructed by himself, entirely\r\nopposed to the world as it is, he finds himself standing in a new\r\nposition. No one is so sensitive to the evils and vices of actual\r\nsociety. No one is so affected by the virtues and happiness of the\r\nsociety of the future. This accounts for his having two holds on the\r\npublic mind, one through satire and the other through the idyll.--These\r\ntwo holds are undoubtedly slighter at the present day; the substance\r\nof their grasp has disappeared; we are not the auditors to which it\r\nappealed. The famous discourse on the influence of literature and on the\r\norigin of inequality seems to us a collegiate exaggeration; an effort\r\nof the will is required to read the \"Nouvelle Héloïse.\" The author is\r\nrepulsive in the persistency of his spitefulness or in the exaggeration\r\nof his enthusiasm. He is always in extremes, now moody and with knit\r\nbrows, and now streaming with tears and with arms outstretched to\r\nHeaven. Hyperbole, prosopopaeia, and other literary machinery are too\r\noften and too deliberately used by him. We are tempted to regard him\r\nnow as a sophist making the best use of his arts, now as a rhetorician\r\ncudgeling his brains for a purpose, now as a preacher becoming excited,\r\nthat is to say, an actor ever maintaining a thesis, striking an attitude\r\nand aiming at effects. Finally, with the exception of the \"Confessions\"\r\nhis style soon wearies us; it is too studied, and too constantly\r\noverstrained. The author is always the author, and he communicates\r\nthe defect to his personages. His Julie argues and descants for\r\ntwenty successive pages on dueling, on love, on duty, with a logical\r\ncompleteness, a talent and phrases that would do honor to an academical\r\nmoralist. Commonplace exists everywhere, general themes, a raking fire\r\nof abstractions and arguments, that is to say, truths more or less\r\nempty and paradoxes more or less hollow. The smallest detail of fact, an\r\nanecdote, a trait of habit, would suit us much better, and hence we of\r\nto day prefer the precise eloquence of objects to the lax eloquence of\r\nwords. In the eighteenth century it was otherwise; to every writer this\r\noratorical style was the prescribed ceremonial costume, the dress-coat\r\nhe had to put on for admission into the company of select people. That\r\nwhich seems to us affectation was then only proper; in a classic epoch\r\nthe perfect period and the sustained development constitute decorum,\r\nand are therefore to be observed.--It must be noted, moreover, that this\r\nliterary drapery which, with us of the present day, conceals truth\r\ndid not conceal it to his contemporaries; they saw under it the exact\r\nfeature, the perceptible detail no longer detected by us. Every abuse,\r\nevery vice, every excess of refinement and of culture, all that social\r\nand moral disease which Rousseau scourged with an author's emphasis,\r\nexisted before them under their own eyes, in their own breasts, visible\r\nand daily manifested in thousands of domestic incidents. In applying\r\nsatire they had only to observe or to remember. Their experience\r\ncompleted the book, and, through the co-operation of his readers, the\r\nauthor possessed power which he is now deprived of. If we were to\r\nput ourselves in their place we should recover their impressions. His\r\ndenunciations and sarcasms, the harsh things of all sorts he says of the\r\ngreat, of fashionable people and of women, his rude and cutting tone,\r\nprovoke and irritate, but are not displeasing. On the contrary, after so\r\nmany compliments, insipidities and petty versification all this quickens\r\nthe blunted taste; it is the sensation of strong common wine after\r\nlong indulgence in orgeat and preserved citron. Accordingly, his first\r\ndiscourse against art and literature \"lifts one at once above the\r\nclouds.\" But his idyllic writings touch the heart more powerfully than\r\nhis satires. If men listen to the moralist that scolds them they throng\r\nin the footsteps of the magician that charms them; especially do women\r\nand the young adhere to one who shows them the promised land. All\r\naccumulated dissatisfactions, weariness of the world, ennui, vague\r\ndisgust, a multitude of suppressed desires gush forth, like subterranean\r\nwaters, under the sounding line that for the first time brings them to\r\nlight. Rousseau with his soundings struck deep and true through his own\r\ntrials and through genius. In a wholly artificial society where people\r\nare drawing room puppets, and where life consists in a graceful parade\r\naccording to a recognized model, he preaches a return to nature,\r\nindependence, earnestness, passion, and effusion, a manly, active,\r\nardent and happy existence in the open air and in sunshine. What an\r\nopening for restrained faculties, for the broad and luxurious fountain\r\never bubbling in man's breast, and for which their nice society provides\r\nno issue!--woman of the court is familiar with love as then practiced,\r\nsimply a preference, often only a pastime, mere gallantry of which\r\nthe exquisite polish poorly conceals the shallowness, coldness\r\nand, occasionally, wickedness; in short, adventures, amusements and\r\npersonages as described by Crébillion jr. One evening, about to go out\r\nto the opera ball, she finds the \"Nouvelle Heloïse\" on her toilet-table;\r\nit is not surprising that she keeps her horses and footmen waiting from\r\nhour to hour, and that at four o'clock in the morning she orders the\r\nhorses to be unharnessed, and then passes the rest of the night in\r\nreading, and that she is stifled with her tears; for the first time in\r\nher life she finds a man that loves[4139]. In like manner if you would\r\ncomprehend the success of \"Emile,\" call to mind the children we\r\nhave described, the embroidered, gilded, dressed-up, powdered little\r\ngentlemen, decked with sword and sash, carrying the chapeau under the\r\narm, bowing, presenting the hand, rehearsing fine attitudes before a\r\nmirror, repeating prepared compliments, pretty little puppets in which\r\neverything is the work of the tailor, the hairdresser, the preceptor\r\nand the dancing-master; alongside of these, little ladies of six years,\r\nstill more artificial, bound up in whalebone, harnessed in a heavy skirt\r\ncomposed of hair and a girdle of iron, supporting a head-dress two feet\r\nin height, so many veritable dolls to which rouge is applied, and with\r\nwhich a mother amuses herself each morning for an hour and then consigns\r\nthem to her maids for the rest of the day[4140]. This mother reads\r\n\"Emile.\" It is not surprising that she immediately strips the poor\r\nlittle thing, and determines to nurse her next child herself.--It is\r\nthrough these contrasts that Rousseau is strong. He revealed the dawn to\r\npeople who never got up until noon, the landscape to eyes that had thus\r\nfar rested only on palaces and drawing-rooms, a natural garden to men\r\nwho had never promenaded outside of clipped shrubs and rectilinear\r\nborders, the country, the family, the people, simple and endearing\r\npleasures, to townsmen made weary by social avidity, by the excesses and\r\ncomplications of luxury, by the uniform comedy which, in the glare of\r\nhundreds of lighted candles, they played night after night in their own\r\nand in the homes of others[4141]. An audience thus disposed makes no\r\nclear distinction between pomp and sincerity, between sentiment and\r\nsentimentality. They follow their author as one who makes a revelation,\r\nas a prophet, even to the end of his ideal world, much more through his\r\nexaggerations than through his discoveries, as far on the road to error\r\nas on the pathway of truth.\r\n\r\nThese are the great literary powers of the century. With inferior\r\nsuccesses, and through various combinations, the elements which\r\ncontributed to the formation of the leading talents also form the\r\nsecondary talents, like those below Rousseau,--Bernardin de St. Pierre,\r\nRaynal, Thomas, Marmontel, Mably, Florian, Dupaty, Mercier, Madame de\r\nStaël; and below Voltaire,--the lively and piquant intellects of Duclos,\r\nPiron, Galiani, President Des Brosses, Rivarol, Champfort, and to speak\r\nwith precision, all other talents. Whenever a vein of talent, however\r\nmeager, peers forth above the ground it is for the propagation and\r\ncarrying forward of the new doctrine; scarcely can we find two or three\r\nlittle streams that run in a contrary direction, like the journal of\r\nFreron, a comedy by Palissot, or a satire by Gilbert. Philosophy winds\r\nthrough and overflows all channels public and private, through manuals\r\nof impiety, like the \"Théologies portatives,\" and in the lascivious\r\nnovels circulated secretly, through epigrams and songs, through daily\r\nnovelties, through the amusements of fairs,[4142] and the harangues of\r\nthe Academy, through tragedy and the opera, from the beginning to the\r\nend of the century, from the \"OEdipe\" of Voltaire, to the \"Tarare\" of\r\nBeaumarchais. It seems as if there was nothing else in the world. At\r\nleast it is found everywhere and it floods all literary efforts;\r\nnobody cares whether it deforms them, content in making them serve as\r\na conduit. In 1763, in the tragedy of Manco-Capac[4143] the \"principal\r\npart,\" writes a contemporary, \"is that of a savage who utters in verse\r\nall that we have read, scattered through 'Emile' and the 'Contrat\r\nSocial,' concerning kings, liberty, the rights of man and the inequality\r\nof conditions.\" This virtuous savage saves a king's son over whom a\r\nhigh-priest raises a poniard, and then, designating the high-priest and\r\nhimself by turns, he cries,\r\n\r\n\"Behold the civilized man; here is the savage man!\"\r\n\r\nAt this line the applause breaks forth, and the success of the piece is\r\nsuch that it is demanded at Versailles and played before the court.\r\n\r\nThe same ideas have to be expressed with skill, brilliancy, gaiety,\r\nenergy and scandal, and this is accomplished in \"The Marriage of\r\nFigaro.\" Never were the ideals of the age displayed under a more\r\ntransparent disguise, nor in an attire that rendered them more\r\nattractive. Its title is the \"Folle journee,\" and indeed it is\r\nan evening of folly, an after-supper like those occurring in the\r\nfashionable world, a masquerade of Frenchmen in Spanish costumes, with\r\na parade of dresses, changing scenes, couplets, a ballet, a singing\r\nand dancing village, a medley of odd characters, gentlemen, servants,\r\nduennas, judges, notaries, lawyers, music-masters, gardeners,\r\npastoureaux; in short, a spectacle for the eyes and the ears, for all\r\nthe senses, the very opposite of the prevailing drama in which three\r\npasteboard characters, seated on classic chairs, exchange didactic\r\narguments in an abstract saloon. And still better, it is an imbroglio\r\ndisplaying a superabundance of action, amidst intrigues that cross,\r\ninterrupt and renew each other, through a pêle-mêle of travesties,\r\nexposures, surprises, mistakes, leaps from windows, quarrels and slaps,\r\nand all in sparkling style, each phrase flashing on all sides, where\r\nresponses seem to be cut out by a lapidary, where the eyes would forget\r\nthemselves in contemplating the multiplied brilliants of the dialogue\r\nif the mind were not carried along by its rapidity and the excitement\r\nof the action. But here is another charm, the most welcome of all in a\r\nsociety passionately fond of Parny; according to an expression of the\r\nComte d'Artois, which I dare not quote, this appeals to the senses, the\r\narousing of which constitutes the spiciness and savor of the piece.\r\nThe fruit that hangs ripening and savory on the branch never falls but\r\nalways seems on the point of falling; all hands are extended to catch\r\nit, its voluptuousness somewhat veiled but so much the more provoking,\r\ndeclaring itself from scene to scene, in the Count's gallantry, in the\r\nCountess's agitation, in the simplicity of Fanchette, in the jestings\r\nof Figaro, in the liberties of Susanne, and reaching its climax in the\r\nprecocity of Cherubino. Add to this a continual double sense, the author\r\nhidden behind his characters, truth put into the mouth of a clown,\r\nmalice enveloped in simple utterances, the master duped but saved from\r\nbeing ridiculous by his deportment, the valet rebellious but preserved\r\nfrom acrimony by his gaiety, and you can comprehend how Beaumarchais\r\ncould have the ancient regime played before its head, put political and\r\nsocial satire on the stage, publicly attach an expression to each wrong\r\nso as to become a by-word, and ever making a loud report,[4144] gather\r\nup into a few traits the entire polemics of the philosophers against the\r\nprisons of the State, against the censorship of literature, against\r\nthe venality of office, against the privileges of birth, against the\r\narbitrary power of ministers, against the incapacity of people in\r\noffice, and still better, to sum up in one character every public\r\ndemand, give the leading part to a commoner, bastard, bohemian and\r\nvalet, who, by dint of dexterity, courage and good-humor, keeps himself\r\nup, swims with the tide, and shoots ahead in his little skiff, avoiding\r\ncontact with larger craft and even supplanting his master, accompanying\r\neach pull on the oar with a shower of wit cast broadside at all his\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\nAfter all, in France at least, the chief power is intellect. Literature\r\nin the service of philosophy is all-sufficient. The public opposes but\r\na feeble resistance to their complicity, the mistress finding no trouble\r\nin convincing those who have already been won over by the servant\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4101: How right Taine was.

THE FRENCH PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Nobility.\r\n\r\n     The Aristocracy.--Novelty commonly repugnant to it.--\r\n     Conditions of this repugnance.--Example in England.\r\n\r\nThis public has yet to be made willing to be convinced and to be won\r\nover; belief occurs only when there is a disposition to believe, and,\r\nin the success of books, its share is often greater than that of their\r\nauthors. On addressing men about politics or religion their opinions\r\nare, in general already formed; their prejudices, their interests, their\r\nsituation have confirmed them beforehand; they listen to you only after\r\nyou have uttered aloud what they inwardly think. Propose to them to\r\ndemolish the great social edifice and to rebuild it anew on a quite an\r\nopposite plan: ordinarily you auditors will consist only of those who\r\nare poorly lodged or shelterless, who live in garrets or cellars, or who\r\nsleep under the stars, on the bare ground in the vicinity of houses.\r\nThe common run of people, whose lodgings are small but tolerable, dread\r\nmoving and adhere to their accustomed ways. The difficulty becomes\r\nmuch greater on appealing to the upper classes who occupy superior\r\nhabitations; their acceptance of your proposal depends either on their\r\ngreat delusions or on their great disinterestedness. In England they\r\nquickly foresee the danger.\r\n\r\nIn vain is philosophy there indigenous and precocious; it does not\r\nbecome acclimatized. In 1729, Montesquieu writes in his memorandum-book:\r\n\"No religion in England; four or five members of the House of Commons\r\nattend mass or preaching in the House. . . . When religion is mentioned\r\neverybody begins to laugh. A man having said: I believe that as an\r\narticle of faith, everybody laughed. A committee is appointed to\r\nconsider the state of religion, but it is regarded as absurd.\" Fifty\r\nyears later the public mind undergoes a reaction; all with a good\r\nroof over their heads and a good coat on their backs[4201] see the\r\nconsequence of the new doctrines. In any event they feel that closet\r\nspeculations are not to become street preaching. Impiety seems to them\r\nan indiscretion; they consider religion as the cement of public order.\r\nThis is owing to the fact that they are themselves public men, engaged\r\nin active life, taking a part in the government, and instructed through\r\ntheir daily and personal experience. Practical life fortifies them\r\nagainst the chimeras of theorists; they have proved to themselves how\r\ndifficult it is to lead and to control men. Having had their hand on the\r\nmachine they know how it works, its value, its cost, and they are not\r\ntempted to cast it aside as rubbish to try another, said to be superior,\r\nbut which, as yet, exists only on paper. The baronet, or squire, a\r\njustice on his own domain, has no trouble in discerning in the clergyman\r\nof his parish an indispensable co-worker and a natural ally. The duke\r\nor marquis, sitting in the upper house by the side of bishops, requires\r\ntheir votes to pass bills, and their assistance to rally to his party\r\nthe fifteen hundred curates who influence the rural conscience. Thus\r\nall have a hand on some social wheel, large or small, principal or\r\naccessory, and this endows them with earnestness, foresight and good\r\nsense. On coming in contact with realities there is no temptation to\r\nsoar away into the imaginary world; the fact of one being at work on\r\nsolid ground of itself makes one dislike aerial excursions in empty\r\nspace. The more occupied one is the less one dreams, and, to men of\r\nbusiness, the geometry of the 'Contrat Social' is merely intellectual\r\ngymnastics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Conditions In France.\r\n\r\n     The opposite conditions found in France.--Indolence of the\r\n     upper class.--Philosophy seems an intellectual drill.--\r\n     Besides this, a subject for conversation.--Philosophic\r\n     conversation in the 18th century.--Its superiority and its\r\n     charm.--The influence it exercises.\r\n\r\nIt is quite the reverse in France. \"I arrived there in 1774,\"[4202]\r\nsays an English gentleman, \"having just left the house of my father, who\r\nnever came home from Parliament until three o'clock in the morning, and\r\nwho was busy the whole morning correcting the proofs of his speech for\r\nthe newspapers, and who, after hastily kissing us, with an absorbed\r\nair, went out to a political dinner. . . . In France I found men of\r\nthe highest rank enjoying perfect leisure. They had interviews with the\r\nministers but only to exchange compliments; in other respects they knew\r\nas little about the public affairs of France as they did about those\r\nof Japan; and less of local affairs than of general affairs, having no\r\nknowledge of their peasantry other than that derived from the accounts\r\nof their stewards. If one of them, bearing the title of governor,\r\nvisited a province, it was, as we have seen, for outward parade; whilst\r\nthe intendant carried on the administration, he exhibited himself with\r\ngrace and magnificence by giving receptions and dinners. To receive, to\r\ngive dinners, to entertain guests agreeably is the sole occupation of a\r\ngrand seignior; hence it is that religion and government only serve him\r\nas subjects of conversation. The conversation, moreover, occurs between\r\nhim and his equals, and a man may say what he pleases in good company.\r\nMoreover the social system turns on its own axis, like the sun, from\r\ntime immemorial, through its own energy, and shall it be deranged by\r\nwhat is said in the drawing-room? In any event he does not control\r\nits motion and he is not responsible. Accordingly there is no uneasy\r\nundercurrent, no morose preoccupation in his mind. Carelessly and boldly\r\nhe follows in the track of his philosophers; detached from affairs he\r\ncan give himself up to ideas, just as a young man of family, on leaving\r\ncollege, lays hold of some principle, deduces its consequences,\r\nand forms a system for himself without concerning himself about its\r\napplication[4203].\r\n\r\nNothing is more enjoyable than this speculative inspiration. The mind\r\nsoars among the summits as if it had wings; it embraces vast horizons\r\nin a glance, taking in all of human life, the economy of the world,\r\nthe origin of the universe, of religions and of societies. Where,\r\naccordingly, would conversation be if people abstained from philosophy?\r\nWhat circle is that in which serious political problems and profound\r\ncriticism are not admitted? And what motive brings intellectual\r\npeople together if not the desire to debate questions of the highest\r\nimportance?--For two centuries in France the conversation has been\r\nrelated to all that, and hence its great charm. Strangers find it\r\nirresistible; nothing like it is found at home; Lord Chesterfield sets\r\nit forth as an example:\r\n\r\n\"It always turns, he says, on some point in history, on criticism or\r\neven philosophy which is much better suited to rational beings than our\r\nEnglish discussions about the weather and whist.\"\r\n\r\nRousseau, so querulous, admits \"that a moral subject could not be better\r\ndiscussed in a society of philosophers than in that of a pretty woman in\r\nParis.\" Undoubtedly there is a good deal of idle talk, but with all the\r\nchattering \"let a man of any authority make a serious remark or start a\r\ngrave subject and the attention is immediately fixed on this point;\r\nmen and women, the old and the young, all give themselves up to its\r\nconsideration on all its sides, and it is surprising what an amount of\r\nreason and good sense issues, as if in emulation, from these frolicsome\r\nbrains.\" The truth is that, in this constant holiday which this\r\nbrilliant society gives itself philosophy is the principal amusement.\r\nWithout philosophy the ordinary ironical chit-chat would be vapid. It\r\nis a sort of superior opera in which every grand conception that can\r\ninterest a reflecting mind passes before it, now in comic and now in\r\nsober attire, and each in conflict with the other. The tragedy of the\r\nday scarcely differs from it except in this respect, that it always\r\nbears a solemn aspect and is performed only in the theaters; the other\r\nassumes all sorts of physiognomies and is found everywhere because\r\nconversation is everywhere carried on. Not a dinner nor a supper is\r\ngiven at which it does not find place. One sits at a table amidst\r\nrefined luxury, among agreeable and well-dressed women and pleasant and\r\nwell-informed men, a select company, in which comprehension is prompt\r\nand the company trustworthy. After the second course the inspiration\r\nbreaks out in the liveliest sallies, all minds flashing and\r\nscintillating. When the dessert comes on what is to prevent the gravest\r\nof subjects from being put into witticisms? On the appearance of the\r\ncoffee questions on the immortality of the soul and on the existence of\r\nGod come up.\r\n\r\nTo form any idea of this attractive and bold conversation we must\r\nconsult the correspondence of the day, the short treatises and dialogues\r\nof Diderot and Voltaire, whatever is most animated, most delicate, most\r\npiquant and most profound in the literature of the century; and yet\r\nthis is only a residuum, a lifeless fragment. The whole of this written\r\nphilosophy was uttered in words, with the accent, the impetuosity, the\r\ninimitable naturalness of improvisation, with the versatility of malice\r\nand of enthusiasm. Even to day, chilled and on paper, it still excites\r\nand seduces us. What must it have been then when it gushed forth alive\r\nand vibrant from the lips of Voltaire and Diderot? Daily, in Paris,\r\nsuppers took place like those described by Voltaire,[4204].at which \"two\r\nphilosophers, three clever intellectual ladies, M. Pinto the famous Jew,\r\nthe chaplain of the Batavian ambassador of the reformed church, the\r\nsecretary of the Prince de Galitzin of the Greek church, and a Swiss\r\nCalvinist captain,\" seated around the same table, for four hours\r\ninterchanged their anecdotes, their flashes of wit, their remarks and\r\ntheir decisions \"on all subjects of interest relating to science and\r\ntaste.\" The most learned and distinguished foreigners daily visited, in\r\nturn, the house of the Baron d'Holbach,--Hume, Wilkes, Sterne, Beccaria,\r\nVeri, the Abbé Galiani, Garrick, Franklin, Priestley, Lord Shelburne,\r\nthe Comte de Creutz, the Prince of Brunswick and the future Elector\r\nof Mayence. With respect to society in general the Baron entertained\r\nDiderot, Rousseau, Helvétius, Duclos, Saurin, Raynal, Suard, Marmontel,\r\nBoulanger, the Chevalier de Chastellux, the traveler La Condamine, the\r\nphysician Barthèz, and Rouelle, the chemist. Twice a week, on Sundays\r\nand Thursdays, \"without prejudice to other days,\" they dine at his\r\nhouse, according to custom, at two o'clock; a significant custom which\r\nthus leaves to conversation and gaiety a man's best powers and the best\r\nhours of the day. Conversation, in those days, was not relegated to\r\nnight and late hours; a man was not forced, as at the present day, to\r\nsubordinate it to the exigencies of work and money, of the Assembly and\r\nthe Exchange. Talking is the main business. \"Entering at two o'clock,\"\r\nsays Morellet,[4205] \"we almost all remained until seven or eight\r\no'clock in the evening. . . . Here could be heard the most liberal, the\r\nmost animated, the most instructive conversation that ever took place.\r\n. . . There was no political or religious temerity which was not brought\r\nforward and discussed pro and con. . . . Frequently some one of the\r\ncompany would begin to speak and state his theory in full, without\r\ninterruption. At other times it would be a combat of one against one, of\r\nwhich the rest remained silent spectators. Here I heard Roux and Darcet\r\nexpose their theory of the earth, Marmontel the admirable principles he\r\ncollected together in his 'Elements de La Littérature,' Raynal, telling\r\nus in livres, sous and deniers, the commerce of the Spaniards with\r\nVera-Crux and of the English with their colonies.\" Diderot improvises on\r\nthe arts and on moral and metaphysical subjects, with that incomparable\r\nfervor and wealth of expression, that flood of logic and of\r\nillustration, those happy hits of style and that mimetic power which\r\nbelonged to him alone, and of which but two or three of his works\r\npreserve even the feeblest image. In their midst Galiani, secretary of\r\nthe Neapolitan Embassy, a clever dwarf; a genius, \"a sort of Plato or\r\nMachiavelli with the spirit and action of a harlequin,\" inexhaustible in\r\nstories, an admirable buffoon, and an accomplished skeptic, \"having no\r\nfaith in anything, on anything or about anything,\"[4206] not even in\r\nthe new philosophy, braves the atheists of the drawing-room, beats down\r\ntheir dithyrambs with puns, and, with his perruque in his hand, sitting\r\ncross-legged on the chair on which he is perched, proves to them in a\r\ncomic apologia that they raisonnent (reason) or résonnent (resound or\r\necho) if not as cruches (blockheads) at least as cloches (bells);\" in\r\nany event almost as poorly as theologians. One of those present says,\r\n\"It was the most diverting thing possible and worth the best of plays.\"\r\n\r\nHow can the nobles, who pass their lives in talking, refrain from the\r\nsociety of people who talk so well? They might as well expect their\r\nwives, who frequent the theater every night, and who perform at home,\r\nnot to attract famous actors and singers to their receptions,\r\nJelyotte, Sainval, Préville, and young Molé who, quite ill and needing\r\nrestoratives, \"receives in one day more than 2,000 bottles of wine\r\nof different sorts from the ladies of the court,\" Mlle. Clairon, who,\r\nconsigned to prison in Fort l'Eveque, attracts to it \"an immense crowd\r\nof carriages,\" presiding over the most select company in the best\r\napartment of the prison[4207]. With life thus regarded, a philosopher\r\nwith his ideas is as necessary in a drawing room as a chandelier with\r\nits lights. He forms a part of the new system of luxury. He is an\r\narticle of export. Sovereigns, amidst their splendor, and at the height\r\nof their success, invite them to their courts to enjoy for once in their\r\nlife the pleasure of perfect and free discourse. When Voltaire arrives\r\nin Prussia Frederic II. is willing to kiss his hand, fawning on him as\r\non a mistress, and, at a later period, after such mutual fondling,\r\nhe cannot dispense with carrying on conversations with him by letter.\r\nCatherine II. sends for Diderot, and, for two or three hours every day,\r\nshe plays with him the great game of the intellect. Gustavus III., in\r\nFrance, is intimate with Marmontel, and considers a visit from Rousseau\r\nas the highest honor[4208]. It is said with truth of Voltaire that \"he\r\nholds the four kings in his hand,\" those of Prussia, Sweden, Denmark and\r\nRussia, without mentioning lower cards, the princes, princesses, grand\r\ndukes and markgraves. The principal rôle in this society evidently\r\nbelongs to authors; their ways and doings form the subject of gossip;\r\npeople never weary of paying them homage. Here, writes Hume to\r\nRobertson,[4209] \"I feed on ambrosia, drink nothing but nectar, breathe\r\nincense only and walk on flowers. Every man I meet, and especially every\r\nwoman, would consider themselves as failing in the most indispensable\r\nduty if they did not favor me with a lengthy and ingenious discourse on\r\nmy celebrity.\" Presented at court, the future Louis XVI, aged ten years,\r\nthe future Louis XVIII, aged eight years, and the future Charles X, aged\r\nfour years, each recites a compliment to him on his works. I need not\r\nnarrate the return of Voltaire, his triumphant entry, [4210] the Academy\r\nin a body coming to welcome him, his carriage stopped by the crowd, the\r\nthronged streets, the windows, steps and balconies filled with admirers,\r\nan intoxicated audience in the theater incessantly applauding, outside\r\nan entire population carrying him off with huzzahs, in the drawing-rooms\r\na continual concourse equal to that of the king, grand seigniors pressed\r\nagainst the door with outstretched ears to catch a word, and great\r\nladies standing on tiptoe to observe the slightest gesture. \"To form\r\nany conception of what I experienced,\" says one of those present, \"one\r\nshould breathe the atmosphere of enthusiasm I lived in. I spoke with\r\nhim.\" This expression at that time converted any new-comer into\r\nan important character. He had, in fact, seen the wonderful\r\norchestra-leader who, for more than fifty years, conducted the\r\ntumultuous concert of serious or court-vêtues ideas, and who, always\r\non the stage, always chief, the recognized leader of universal\r\nconversation, supplied the motives, gave the pitch, marked the measure,\r\nstamped the inspiration, and drew the first note on the violin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. French Indolence.\r\n\r\n     Further effects of indolence.--The skeptical, licentious and\r\n     seditious spirit.--Previous resentment and fresh discontent\r\n     at the established order of things.--Sympathy for the\r\n     theories against it.--How far accepted.\r\n\r\nListen to the shouts that greet him: Hurrah for the author of the\r\nHenriade! the defender of Calas, the author of La Pucelle! Nobody of the\r\npresent day would utter the first, nor especially the last hurrah. This\r\nindicates the tendency of the century; not only were writers called upon\r\nfor ideas, but again for antagonistic ideas. To render an aristocracy\r\ninactive is to render it rebellious; people are more willing to submit\r\nto rules they have themselves helped to enforce. Would you rally them\r\nto the support of the government? Then let them take part in it. If\r\nnot they stand by as an onlooker and see nothing but the mistakes it\r\ncommits, feeling only its irritations, and disposed only to criticize\r\nand to hoot at it. In fact, in this case, they are as if in the theater,\r\nwhere they go to be amused, and, especially, not to be put to any\r\ninconvenience. What inconveniences in the established order of things,\r\nand indeed in any established order!--In the first place, religion.\r\nTo the amiable \"idlers\" whom Voltaire describes,[4211] to \"the 100,000\r\npersons with nothing to do but to play and to amuse themselves,\"\r\nreligion is the most disagreeable of pedagogues, always scolding,\r\nhostile to sensible amusement and free discussion, burning books\r\nwhich one wants to read, and imposing dogmas that are no longer\r\ncomprehensible. In plain terms religion is an eyesore, and whoever\r\nwishes to throw stones at her is welcome.--There is another bond, the\r\nmoral law of the sexes. It seems onerous to men of pleasure, to the\r\ncompanions of Richelieu, Lauzun and Tilly, to the heroes of Crebillon\r\nthe younger, and all others belonging to that libertine and gallant\r\nsociety for whom license has become the rule. Our fine gentlemen are\r\nquite ready to adopt a theory which justifies their practices.[4212]\r\nThey are very glad to be told that marriage is conventional and a thing\r\nof prejudice. Saint--Lambert obtains their applause at supper when,\r\nraising a glass of champagne, he proposes as a toast a return to\r\nnature and the customs of Tahiti[4213]. The last fetter of all is the\r\ngovernment, the most galling, for it enforces the rest and keeps man\r\ndown with its weight, along with the added weight of the others. It is\r\nabsolute, it is centralized, it works through favorites, it is backward,\r\nit makes mistakes, it has reverses: how many causes of discontent\r\nembraced in a few words! It is opposed by the vague and suppressed\r\nresentment of the former powers which it has dispossessed, the\r\nprovincial assemblies, the parliaments, the grandees of the provinces,\r\nthe old stock of nobles, who, like the Mirabeau, retain the old\r\nfeudal spirit, and like Châteaubriand's father, call the Abbé Raynal\r\na \"master-man.\" Against it is the spite of all those who imagine\r\nthemselves frustrated in the distribution of offices and of favors, not\r\nonly the provincial nobility who remain outside[4214] while the court\r\nnobility are feasting at the royal banquet, but again the majority\r\nof the courtiers who are obliged to be content with crumbs, while the\r\nlittle circle of intimate favorites swallow down the large morsels. It\r\nhas against it the ill-humor of those under its direction who, seeing\r\nit play the part of Providence and providing for all, accuses it\r\nof everything, the high price of bread as well as of the decay of a\r\nhighway. It has against it the new humanity which, in the most elegant\r\ndrawing-rooms, lays to its charge the maintenance of the antiquated\r\nremains of a barbarous epoch, ill-imposed, ill-apportioned and\r\nill-collected taxes, sanguinary laws, blind prosecutions, atrocious\r\npunishments, the persecution of the Protestants, lettres-de-cachet, and\r\nprisons of State. And I do not include its excesses, its scandals, its\r\ndisasters and its disgraces,--Rosbach, the treaty of Paris, Madame du\r\nBarry, and bankruptcy.--Disgust intervenes, for everything is decidedly\r\nbad. The spectators of the play say to each other that not only is\r\nthe piece itself poor, but the theater is badly built, uncomfortable,\r\nstifling and contracted, to such a degree that, to be at one's ease, the\r\nwhole thing must be torn down and rebuilt from cellar to garret.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the new architects appear, with their specious\r\narguments and their ready-made plans, proving that every great public\r\nstructure, religious and moral, and all communities, cannot be otherwise\r\nthan barbarous and unhealthy, since, thus far, they are built up out of\r\nbits and pieces, by degrees, and generally by fools and savages, in\r\nany event by common masons, who built aimlessly, feeling their way and\r\ndevoid of principles. As far as they are concerned, they are genuine\r\narchitects, and they have principles, that is to say, Reason, Nature,\r\nand the Rights of Man, straightforward and fruitful principles which\r\neverybody can understand, all that has to be done is to draw their\r\nconsequences making it possible to replace the imperfect tenements\r\nof the past with the admirable edifice of the future.--To irreverent,\r\nEpicurean and philanthropic malcontents the temptation is a great one.\r\nThey readily adopt maxims which seem in conformity with their secret\r\nwishes; at least they adopt them in theory and in words. The imposing\r\nterms of liberty, justice, public good, man's dignity, are so admirable,\r\nand besides so vague! What heart can refuse to cherish them, and what\r\nintelligence can foretell their innumerable applications? And all the\r\nmore because, up to the last, the theory does not descend from the\r\nheights, being confined to abstractions, resembling an academic oration,\r\nconstantly dealing with Natural Man (homme en soi) of the social\r\ncontract, with an imaginary and perfect society. Is there a courtier\r\nat Versailles who would refuse to proclaim equality in the lands of the\r\nFranks!--Between the two stories of the human intellect, the upper where\r\nabstract reasoning is spun and the lower where an active faith reposes,\r\ncommunication is neither complete nor immediate. A number of principles\r\nnever leave the upper stories; they remain there as curiosities, so many\r\nfragile, clever mechanisms, freely to be seen but rarely employed. If\r\nthe proprietor sometimes transfers them to the lower story he makes but\r\na partial use of them; established customs, anterior and more powerful\r\ninterests and instincts restrict their employment. In this respect he\r\nis not acting in bad faith, but as a man; each of us professing truths\r\nwhich he does not put in practice. One evening Target, a dull lawyer,\r\nhaving taken a pinch from the snuff-box of the Maréchale de Beauvau, the\r\nlatter, whose drawing room is a small democratic club, is amazed at such\r\nmonstrous familiarity. Later, Mirabeau, on returning home just after\r\nhaving voted for the abolition of the titles of nobility, takes his\r\nservant by the ear, laughingly proclaiming in his thunderous voice,\r\n\"Look here, you rascal, I trust that to you I shall always be Monsieur\r\nle Comte!\"--This shows to what extent new theories are admitted into an\r\naristocratic brain. They occupy the whole of the upper story, and there,\r\nwith a pleasing murmur, they weave the web of interminable conversation;\r\ntheir buzzing lasts throughout the century; never have the drawing-rooms\r\nseen such an outpouring of fine sentences and of fine words. Something\r\nof all this drops from the upper to the lower story, if only as dust,\r\nI mean to say, hope, faith in the future, belief in Reason, a love of\r\ntruth, the generous and youthful good intentions, the enthusiasm that\r\nquickly passes but which may, for a while, become self-abnegation and\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Unbelief.\r\n\r\n     The diffusion among the upper class.--Progress of\r\n     incredulity in religion.--Its causes.--It breaks out under\r\n     the Regency.--Increasing irritation against the clergy.--\r\n     Materialism in the drawing-room.--Estimate of the sciences.--\r\n     Final opinion on religion.--Skepticism of the higher clergy.\r\n\r\nLet us follow the progress of philosophy in the upper class. Religion is\r\nthe first to receive the severest attacks. The small group of skeptics,\r\nwhich is hardly perceptible under Louis XIV, has obtained its recruits\r\nin the dark; in 1698 the Palatine, the mother of the Regent, writes\r\nthat \"we scarcely meet a young man now who is not ambitious of being\r\nan atheist.\"[4215] Under the Regency, unbelief comes out into open\r\ndaylight. \"I doubt,\" says this lady again, in 1722, \"if; in all Paris,\r\na hundred individuals can be found, either ecclesiastics or laymen, who\r\nhave any true faith, or even believe in our Lord. It makes one tremble.\r\n. . .\" The position of an ecclesiastic in society is already difficult.\r\nHe is looked upon, apparently, as either a puppet or a dickey (a false\r\nshirt front)[4216]. \"The moment we appear,\" says one of them, \"we are\r\nforced into discussion; we are called upon to prove, for example, the\r\nutility of prayer to an unbeliever in God, and the necessity of fasting\r\nto a man who has all his life denied the immortality of the soul; the\r\neffort is very irksome, while those who laugh are not on our side.\" It\r\nis not long before the continued scandal of confession tickets and the\r\nstubbornness of the bishops in not allowing ecclesiastical property\r\nto be taxed, excites opinion against the clergy, and, as a matter of\r\ncourse, against religion itself. \"There is danger,\" says Barbier in\r\n1751, \"that this may end seriously; we may some day see a revolution in\r\nthis country in favor of Protestantism.\"[4217] \"The hatred against\r\nthe priests,\" writes d'Argenson in 1753, \"is carried to extremes. They\r\nscarcely show themselves in the streets without being hooted at. . . .As\r\nour nation and our century are quite otherwise enlightened (than in\r\nthe time of Luther), it will be carried far enough; they will expel the\r\npriests, abolish the priesthood and get rid of all revelation and all\r\nmystery. . . . One dare not speak in behalf of the clergy in\r\nsocial circles; one is scoffed at and regarded as a familiar of the\r\ninquisition. The priests remark that, this year, there is a diminution\r\nof more than one-third in the number of communicants. The College of\r\nthe Jesuits is being deserted; one hundred and twenty boarders have been\r\nwithdrawn from these so greatly defamed monks. It has been observed also\r\nthat, during the carnival in Paris, the number of masks counterfeiting\r\necclesiastical dress, bishops, abbés, monks and nuns, was never so\r\ngreat.\"--So deep is this antipathy, the most mediocre books become the\r\nrage so long as they are anti-Christian and condemned as such. In 1748\r\na work by Toussaint called \"Les Moeurs,\" in favor of natural religion,\r\nsuddenly becomes so famous, \"that there is no one among a certain\r\nclass of people,\" writes Barbier, \"man or woman, pretending to be\r\nintellectual, who is not eager to read it.\" People accost each other on\r\ntheir promenades, Have you read \"Les Moeurs\"?--Ten years later they\r\nare beyond deism. \"Materialism,\" Barbier further said, \"is the great\r\ngrievance. . . . \" \"Almost all people of erudition and taste, writes\r\nd'Argenson, \"inveigh against our holy religion. . . . It is attacked on\r\nall sides, and what animates unbelievers still more is the efforts made\r\nby the devout to compel belief. They publish books which are but little\r\nread; debates no longer take place, everything being laughed at, while\r\npeople persist in materialism.\" Horace Walpole, who returns to France in\r\n1765,[4218] and whose good sense anticipates the danger, is astonished\r\nat such imprudence: \"I dined to day with a dozen scholars and\r\nscientists, and although all the servants were around us and listening,\r\nthe conversation was much more unrestrained, even on the Old Testament,\r\nthan I would allow at my own table in England even if a single footman\r\nwas present.\" People dogmatize everywhere. \"Joking is as much out of\r\nfashion as jumping jacks and tumblers. Our good folks have no time to\r\nlaugh! There is God and the king to be hauled down first; and men and\r\nwomen, one and all, are devoutly employed in the demolition. They think\r\nme quite profane for having any belief left. . . . Do you know who the\r\nphilosophers are, or what the term means here? In the first place it\r\ncomprehends almost everybody; and in the next, means men, who, avowing\r\nwar against popery, take aim, many of them, at a subversion of\r\nall religion. . . . These savants,--I beg their pardons, these\r\nphilosophers--are insupportable, superficial, overbearing and fanatic:\r\nthey preach incessantly, and their avowed doctrine is atheism; you would\r\nnot believe how openly. Voltaire himself does not satisfy them. One of\r\ntheir lady devotees said of him, 'He is a bigot, a deist!'\"\r\n\r\nThis is very strong, and yet we have not come to the end of it; for,\r\nthus far, impiety is less a conviction than the fashion. Walpole, a\r\ncareful observer, is not deluded by it. \"By what I have said of their\r\nreligious or rather irreligious opinions, you must not conclude their\r\npeople of quality atheists--at least not the men. Happily for them, poor\r\nsouls! they are not capable of going so far into thinking. They assent\r\nto a great deal because it is the fashion, and because they don't know\r\nhow to contradict.\" Now that \"dandies are outmoded\" and everybody is \"a\r\nphilosopher,\" \"they are philosophers.\" It is essential to be like all\r\nthe rest of the world. But that which they best appreciate in the\r\nnew materialism is the pungency of paradox and the freedom given to\r\npleasure. They are like the boys of good families, fond of playing\r\ntricks on their ecclesiastical preceptor. They take out of learned\r\ntheories just what is wanted to make a dunce-cap, and derive the more\r\namusement from the fun if it is seasoned with impiety. A seignior of\r\nthe court having seen Doyen's picture of \"St. Genevieve and the\r\nplague-stricken,\" sends to a painter the following day to come to him at\r\nhis mistress's domicile: \"I would like,\" he says to him, \"to have Madame\r\npainted in a swing put in motion by a bishop; you may place me in such a\r\nway that I may see the ankles of that handsome woman, and even more, if\r\nyou want to enliven your picture.\"[4219] The licentious song \"Marotte\"\r\n\"spreads like wildfire;\" \"a fortnight after its publication,\" says\r\nCollé, \"I met no one without a copy; and it is the vaudeville, or\r\nrather, the clerical assembly, which gives it its popularity.\" The more\r\nirreligious a licentious book is the more it is prized; when it cannot\r\nbe printed it is copied in manuscript. Collé counts \"perhaps two\r\nthousand manuscript copies of' La Pucelle 'by Voltaire, scattered about\r\nParis in one month.\" The magistrates themselves burn it only for form's\r\nsake. \"It must not be supposed that the hangman is allowed to burn the\r\nbooks whose titles figure in the decree of the Court. Messieurs would be\r\nloath to deprive their libraries of the copy of those works which fall\r\nto them by right, and make the registrar supply its place with a few\r\npoor records of chicanery of which there is no scanty provision.\"[4220]\r\n\r\nBut, as the century advances, unbelief, less noisy, becomes more solid.\r\nIt invigorates itself at the fountain-head; the women themselves begin\r\nto be infatuated with the sciences. In 1782,[4221] one of Mme. de\r\nGenlis's characters writes,\r\n\r\nFive years ago I left them thinking only of their attire and the\r\npreparation of their suppers; I now find them all scientific and witty.\"\r\nWe find in the study of a fashionable woman, alongside of a small altar\r\ndedicated to Benevolence or Friendship, a dictionary of natural history\r\nand treatises on physics and chemistry. A woman no longer has herself\r\npainted as a goddess on a cloud but in a laboratory, seated amidst\r\nsquares and telescopes[4222]. The Marquise de Nesle, the Comtesse\r\nde Brancas, the Comtesse de Pons, the Marquise de Polignac, are\r\nwith Rouelle when he undertakes to melt and volatilize the diamond.\r\nAssociations of twenty or twenty-five persons are formed in the\r\ndrawing-rooms to attend lectures either on physics, applied chemistry,\r\nmineralogy or on botany. Fashionable women at the public meetings of\r\nthe Academy of Inscriptions applaud dissertations on the bull Apis, and\r\nreports on the Egyptian, Phoenician and Greek languages. Finally,\r\nin 1786, they succeed in opening the doors of the College de France.\r\nNothing deters them. Many of them use the lancet and even the scalpel;\r\nthe Marquise de Voyer attends at dissections, and the young Comtesse de\r\nCoigny dissects with her own hands. The current infidelity finds fresh\r\nsupport on this foundation, which is that of the prevailing philosophy.\r\nTowards the end of the century[4223] \"we see young persons who have\r\nbeen in society six or seven years openly pluming themselves on their\r\nirreligion, thinking that impiety makes up for wit, and that to be an\r\natheist is to be a philosopher.\" There are, undoubtedly, a good many\r\ndeists, especially after Rousseau appeared, but I question whether, out\r\nof a hundred persons, there were in Paris at this time ten Christian men\r\nor women. \"The fashionable world for ten years past,\" says Mercier[4224]\r\nin 1783, \"has not attended mass. People go only on Sundays so as not\r\nto scandalize their lackeys, while the lackeys well know that it is\r\non their account.\" The Duc de Coigny,[4225] on his estate near Amiens,\r\nrefuses to be prayed for and threatens his curate if he takes that\r\nliberty to have him cast out of his pulpit; his son becomes ill and\r\nhe prohibits the administering of the sacraments; the son dies and he\r\nopposes the usual obsequies, burying the body in his garden; becoming\r\nill himself he closes his door against the bishop of Amiens, who comes\r\nto see him twelve times, and dies as he had lived. A scandal of this\r\nkind is doubtless notorious and, therefore, rare. Almost everybody,\r\nmale and female, \"ally with freedom of ideas a proper observance of\r\nforms.\"[4226] When a maid appears and says to her mistress, \"Madame\r\nla Duchesse, the Host (le bon Dieu) is outside, will you allow him\r\nto enter? He desires to have the honor of administering to you,\"\r\nappearances are kept up. The troublesome individual is admitted and he\r\nis politely received. If they slip away from him it is under a decent\r\npretext; but if he is humored it is only out of a sense of decorum. \"At\r\nSura when a man dies, he holds a cow's tail in his hand.\" Society was\r\nnever more detached from Christianity. In its eyes a positive religion\r\nis only a popular superstition, good enough for children and innocents\r\nbut not for \"sensible people\" and the great. It is your duty to raise\r\nyour hat to the Host as it passes, but your duty is only to raise your\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nThe last and gravest sign of all! If the curates who work and who are of\r\nthe people hold the people's ideas, the prelates who talk, and who are\r\nof society hold the opinions of society. And I do not allude merely to\r\nthe abbés of the drawing-room, the domestic courtiers, bearers of news,\r\nand writers of light verse, those who fawn in boudoirs, and who, when\r\nin company, answer like an echo, and who, between one drawing room\r\nand another, serve as megaphone; an echo, a megaphone only repeats the\r\nphrase, whether skeptical or not, with which it is charged. I refer to\r\nthe dignitaries, and, on this point, the witnesses all concur. In the\r\nmonth of August, 1767, the Abbé Bassinet, grand vicar of Cahors, on\r\npronouncing the panegyric of St. Louis in the Louvre chapel,[4227]\r\n\"suppressed the sign of the cross, making no quotation from Scripture\r\nand never uttering a word about Christ and the Saints. He considered\r\nLouis IX merely on the side of his political, moral and military\r\nvirtues. He animadverted on the Crusades, setting forth their absurdity,\r\ncruelty and even injustice. He struck openly and without caution at the\r\nsee of Rome.\" Others \"avoid the name of Christ in the pulpit and merely\r\nallude to him as a Christian legislator.\"[4228] In the code which the\r\nprevailing opinions and social decency impose on the clergy a delicate\r\nobserver[4229] thus specifies distinctions in rank with their proper\r\nshades of behavior: \"A plain priest, a curate, must have a little faith,\r\notherwise he would be found a hypocrite; at the same time, he must\r\nnot be too well satisfied, for he would be found intolerant. On the\r\ncontrary, the grand vicar may smile at an expression against religion,\r\nthe bishop may laugh outright, and the cardinal may add something of his\r\nown to it.\" \"A little while ago,\" a chronicle narrates, \"some one put\r\nthis question to one of the most respectable curates in Paris: Do you\r\nthink that the bishops who insist so strenuously on religion have\r\nmuch of it themselves? The worthy pastor replied, after a moment's\r\nhesitation: There may be four or five among them who still believe.\"\r\nTo one who is familiar with their birth, their social relations, their\r\nhabits and their tastes, this does not appear at all improbable.\r\n\"Dom Collignon, a representative of the abbey of Mettach, seignior\r\nhigh-justiciary and curate of Valmunster,\" a fine-looking man, fine\r\ntalker, and an agreeable housekeeper, avoids scandal by having his two\r\nmistresses at his table only with a select few; he is in other respects\r\nas little devout as possible, and much less so than the Savoyard\r\nvicar, \"finding evil only in injustice and in a lack of charity,\" and\r\nconsidering religion merely as a political institution and for moral\r\nends. I might cite many others, like M. de Grimaldi, the young and\r\ngallant bishop of Le Mans, who selects young and gallant comrades of his\r\nown station for his grand vicars, and who has a rendezvous for pretty\r\nwomen at his country seat at Coulans[4230]. Judge of their faith by\r\ntheir habits. In other cases we have no difficulty in determining.\r\nScepticism is notorious with the Cardinal de Rohan, with M. de Brienne,\r\narchbishop of Sens, with M. de Talleyrand, bishop of Autun, and with the\r\nAbbé Maury, defender of the clergy. Rivarol,[4231] himself a skeptic,\r\ndeclares that at the approach of the Revolution, \"the enlightenment of\r\nthe clergy equaled that of the philosophers.\" \"Who would believe it, but\r\nbody with the fewest prejudices,\" says Mercier,[4232] \"is the clergy.\"\r\nAnd the Archbishop of Narbonne, explaining the resistance of the upper\r\nclass of the clergy in 1791 [4233] attributes it, not to faith but to\r\na point of honor. \"We conducted ourselves at that time like true\r\ngentlemen, for, with most of us, it could not be said that it was\r\nthrough religious feeling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Political Opposition.\r\n\r\n     Progress of political opposition.--Its origin.--The\r\n     economists and the parliamentarians.--They prepare the way\r\n     for the philosophers.--Political fault-finding in the\r\n     drawing-rooms.--Female liberalism.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the altar and the throne is a short one, and yet it\r\nrequires thirty years for opinion to overcome it. No political or social\r\nattacks are yet made during the first half of the century. The irony of\r\nthe \"Lettres Persanes\"is as cautious as it is delicate, and the \"Esprit\r\ndes Lois\" is conservative. As to the Abbé de Saint-Pierre his reveries\r\nprovoke a smile, and when he undertakes to censure Louis XIV the Academy\r\nstrikes him off its list. At last, the economists on one side and the\r\nparliamentarians on the other, give the signal.--Voltaire says[4234]\r\nthat \"about 1750 the nation, satiated with verse, tragedies, comedies,\r\nnovels, operas, romantic histories, and still more romantic moralizings,\r\nand with disputes about grace and convulsions, began to discuss\r\nthe question of corn.\" What makes bread dear? Why is the laborer so\r\nmiserable? What constitutes the material and limits of taxation? Ought\r\nnot all land to pay taxes, and should one piece pay more than its net\r\nproduct? These are the questions that find their way into drawing-rooms\r\nunder the king's auspices, by means of Quesnay, his physician, \"his\r\nthinker,\" the founder of a system which aggrandizes the sovereign to\r\nrelieve the people, and which multiplies the number of tax-payers to\r\nlighten the burden of taxation.--At the same time, through the opposite\r\ndoor, other questions enter, not less novel. \"Is France[4235] a mild\r\nand representative monarchy or a government of the Turkish stamp? Are\r\nwe subject to the will of an absolute master, or are we governed by a\r\nlimited and regulated power?. . . The exiled parliaments are studying\r\npublic rights at their sources and conferring together on these as in\r\nthe academies. Through their researches, the opinion is gaining ground\r\nin the public mind that the nation is above the king, as the universal\r\nchurch is above the pope.\"--The change is striking and almost immediate.\r\n\"Fifty years ago,\" says d'Argenson, again, \"the public showed no\r\ncuriosity concerning matters of the State. Today everybody reads his\r\nGazette de Paris, even in the provinces. People reason at random\r\non political subjects, but nevertheless they occupy themselves with\r\nthem.\"--Conversation having once provided itself with this diet holds\r\nfast to it, the drawing-rooms, accordingly, opening their doors to\r\npolitical philosophy, and, consequently, to the Social Contract, to the\r\nEncyclopedia, to the preachings of Rousseau, Mably, d'Holbach, Raynal,\r\nand Diderot. In 1759, d'Argenson, who becomes excited, already\r\nthinks the last hour has come. \"We feel the breath of a philosophical\r\nanti-monarchical, free government wind; the idea is current, and\r\npossibly this form of government, already in some minds, is to be\r\ncarried out the first favorable opportunity. Perhaps the revolution\r\nmight take place with less opposition than one supposes, occurring by\r\nacclamation.[4236]\r\n\r\nThe time is not yet come, but the seed is coming up. Bachaumont, in\r\n1762, notices a deluge of pamphlets, tracts and political discussions,\r\n\"a rage for arguing on financial and government matters.\" In 1765,\r\nWalpole states that the atheists, who then monopolize conversation,\r\ninveigh against kings as well as against priests. A formidable word,\r\nthat of citizen, imported by Rousseau, has entered into common speech,\r\nand the matter is settled on the women adopting it as they would a\r\ncockade. \"As a friend and a citoyenne could any news be more agreeable\r\nto me than that of peace and the health of my dear little one?\"[4237]\r\nAnother word, not less significant, that of energy, formerly ridiculous,\r\nbecomes fashionable, and is used on every occasion[4238]. Along with\r\nlanguage there is a change of sentiment, ladies of high rank passing\r\nover to the opposition. In 1771, says the scoffer Bezenval, after the\r\nexile of the Parliament \"social meetings for pleasure or other purposes\r\nhad become petty States-Generals in which the women, transformed into\r\nlegislators, established the premises and confidently propounded maxims\r\nof public right.\" The Comtesse d'Egmont, a correspondent of the King of\r\nSweden, sends him a paper on the fundamental law of France, favoring\r\nthe Parliament, the last defender of national liberty, against the\r\nencroachments of Chancellor Maupeou. \"The Chancellor,\" she says,[4239]\r\n\"within the last six months has brought people to know the history of\r\nFrance who would have died without any knowledge of it. . . . I have\r\nno doubt, sire,\" she adds, \"that you never will abuse the power an\r\nenraptured people have entrusted to you without limitation. . . .\r\nMay your reign prove the epoch of the re-establishment of a free and\r\nindependent government, but never the source of absolute authority.\"\r\nNumbers of women of the first rank, Mesdames de la Marck, de Boufflers,\r\nde Brienne, de Mesmes, de Luxembourg, de Croy, think and write in the\r\nsame style. \"Absolute power,\" says one of these, \"is a mortal malady\r\nwhich, insensibly corrupting moral qualities, ends in the destruction\r\nof states. . . . The actions of sovereigns are subject to the censure of\r\ntheir subjects as to that of the universe. . . . France is undone if\r\nthe present administration lasts.\"[4240]--When, under Louis XVI, a new\r\nadministration proposes and withdraws feeble measures of reform, their\r\ncriticism shows the same firmness: \"Childishness, weakness, constant\r\ninconsistency,\" writes another,[4241] \"incessant change; and always\r\nworse off than we were before. Monsieur and M. le Comte d'Artois have\r\njust made a journey through the provinces, but only as people of that\r\nkind travel, with a frightful expenditure and devastation along the\r\nwhole road, coming back extraordinarily fat; Monsieur is as big as a\r\nhogshead; as to M. le Comte d'Artois he is bringing about order by the\r\nlife he leads.\"--An inspiration of humanity animates these feminine\r\nbreasts along with that of liberty. They interest themselves in the\r\npoor, in children, in the people; Madame d'Egmont recommends Gustavus\r\nIII to plant Dalecarlia with potatoes. On the appearance of the\r\nengraving published for the benefit of Calas[4242] \"all France and even\r\nall Europe, hastens to subscribe for it, the Empress of Russia giving\r\n5,000 livres[4243]. \"Agriculture, economy, reform, philosophy,\" writes\r\nWalpole, \"are bon ton, even at the court.\"--President Dupaty having\r\ndrawn up a memorandum in behalf of three innocent persons, sentenced \"to\r\nbe broken on the wheel, everybody in society is talking about it;\" \"idle\r\nconversation no longer prevails in society,\" says a correspondent of\r\nGustavus III[4244] \"since it is that which forms public opinion.\r\nWords have become actions. Every sensitive heart praises with joy\r\na publication inspired by humanity and which appears full of talent\r\nbecause it is full of feeling.\" When Latude is released from the prison\r\nof Bicêtre Mme. de Luxembourg, Mme. de Boufflers, and Mme. de Staël dine\r\nwith the grocer-woman who \"for three years and a half moved heaven and\r\nearth\" to set the prisoner free. It is owing to the women, to their\r\nsensibility and zeal, to a conspiracy of their sympathies, that M. de\r\nLally succeeds in the rehabilitation of his father. When they take a\r\nfancy to a person they become infatuated with him; Madame de Lauzun,\r\nvery timid, goes so far as to publicly insult a man who speaks ill of M.\r\nNecker.--It must be borne in mind that, in this century, the women were\r\nqueens, setting the fashion, giving the tone, leading in conversation\r\nand naturally shaping ideas and opinions[4245]. When they take the lead\r\non the political field we may be sure that the men will follow them:\r\neach one carries her drawing room circle with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Well-Meaning Government.\r\n\r\n     Infinite, vague aspirations.--Generosity of sentiments and\r\n     of conduct.--The mildness and good intentions of the\r\n     government.--Its blindness and optimism.\r\n\r\nAn aristocracy imbued with humanitarian and radical maxims, courtiers\r\nhostile to the court, privileged persons aiding in undermining\r\nprivileges, presents to us a strange spectacle in the testimony of the\r\ntime. A contemporary states that it is an accepted principle \"to change\r\nand upset everything.\"[4246] High and low, in assemblages, in public\r\nplaces, only reformers and opposing parties are encountered among the\r\nprivileged classes.\r\n\r\n\"In 1787, almost every prominent man of the peerage in the Parliament\r\ndeclared himself in favor of resistance. . . . I have seen at the\r\ndinners we then attended almost every idea put forward, which, soon\r\nafterwards, produced such startling effects.\"[4247] Already in 1774,\r\nM. de Vaublanc, on his way to Metz, finds a diligence containing an\r\necclesiastic and a count, a colonel in the hussars, talking political\r\neconomy constantly[4248]. \"It was the fashion of the day. Everybody was\r\nan economist. People conversed together only about philosophy, political\r\neconomy and especially humanity, and the means for relieving the people,\r\n(le bon peuple), which two words were in everybody's mouth.\" To this\r\nmust be added equality; Thomas, in a eulogy of Marshal Saxe says, \"I\r\ncannot conceal it, he was of royal blood,\" and this phrase was admired.\r\nA few of the heads of old parliamentary or seigniorial families\r\nmaintain the old patrician and monarchical standard, the new generation\r\nsuccumbing to novelty. \"For ourselves,\" says one of them belonging to\r\nthe youthful class of the nobility,[4249] \"with no regret for the past\r\nor anxiety for the future, we marched gaily along over a carpet of\r\nflowers concealing an abyss. Mocking censors of antiquated ways, of the\r\nfeudal pride of our fathers and of their sober etiquette, everything\r\nantique seemed to us annoying and ridiculous. The gravity of old\r\ndoctrines oppressed us. The cheerful philosophy of Voltaire amused\r\nand took possession of us. Without fathoming that of graver writers we\r\nadmired it for its stamp of fearlessness and resistance to arbitrary\r\npower. . . . Liberty, what-ever its language, delighted us with its\r\nspirit, and equality on account of its convenience. It is a pleasant\r\nthing to descend so long as one thinks one can ascend when one pleases;\r\nwe were at once enjoying, without forethought, the advantages of the\r\npatriciate and the sweets of a commoner philosophy. Thus, although our\r\nprivileges were at stake, and the remnants of our former supremacy\r\nwere undermined under our feet, this little warfare gratified us.\r\nInexperienced in the attack, we simply admired the spectacle. Combats\r\nwith the pen and with words did not appear to us capable of damaging our\r\nexisting superiority, which several centuries of possession had made\r\nus regard as impregnable. The forms of the edifice remaining intact,\r\nwe could not see how it could be mined from within. We laughed at the\r\nserious alarm of the old court and of the clergy which thundered\r\nagainst the spirit of innovation. We applauded republican scenes in\r\nthe theater,[4250] philosophic discourses in our Academies, the bold\r\npublications of the literary class.\"--If inequality still subsists in\r\nthe distribution of offices and of places, \"equality begins to reign in\r\nsociety. On many occasions literary titles obtain precedence over titles\r\nof nobility. Courtiers and servants of the passing fashion, paid their\r\ncourt to Marmontel, d'Alembert and Raynal. We frequently saw in\r\ncompany literary men of the second and third rank greeted and\r\nreceiving attentions not extended to the nobles of the provinces. . . .\r\nInstitutions remained monarchical, but manners and customs became\r\nrepublican. A word of praise from d'Alembert or Diderot was more\r\nesteemed than the most marked favor from a prince. . . It was impossible\r\nto pass an evening with d'Alembert, or at the Hôtel de Larochefoucauld\r\namong the friends of Turgot, to attend a breakfast at the Abbé Raynal's,\r\nto be admitted into the society and family of M. de Malesherbes, and\r\nlastly, to approach a most amiable queen and a most upright king,\r\nwithout believing ourselves about to enter upon a kind of golden era of\r\nwhich preceding centuries afforded no idea. . . . We were bewildered\r\nby the prismatic hues of fresh ideas and doctrines, radiant with hopes,\r\nardently aglow for every sort of reputation, enthusiastic for all\r\ntalents and beguiled by every seductive dream of a philosophy that was\r\nabout to secure the happiness of the human species. Far from foreseeing\r\nmisfortune, excess, crime, the overthrow of thrones and of principles,\r\nthe future disclosed to us only the benefits which humanity was\r\nto derive from the sovereignty of Reason. Freedom of the press and\r\ncirculation was given to every reformative writing, to every project\r\nof innovation, to the most liberal ideas and to the boldest of systems.\r\nEverybody thought himself on the road to perfection without being under\r\nany embarrassment or fearing any kind of obstacle. We were proud of\r\nbeing Frenchmen and, yet again, Frenchmen of the eighteenth century\r\n. . . . Never was a more terrible awakening preceded by a sweeter\r\nslumber or by more seductive dreams.\"\r\n\r\nThey do not content themselves with dreams, with pure desires, with\r\npassive aspirations. They are active, and truly generous; a worthy\r\ncause suffices to secure their devotion. On the news of the American\r\nrebellion, the Marquis de Lafayette, leaving his young wife pregnant,\r\nescapes, braves the orders of the court, purchases a frigate, crosses\r\nthe ocean and fights by the side of Washington. \"The moment the quarrel\r\nwas made known to me,\" he says, \"my heart was enlisted in it, and my\r\nonly thought was to rejoin my regiment.\" Numbers of gentlemen follow in\r\nhis footsteps. They undoubtedly love danger; \"the chance of being\r\nshot is too precious to be neglected.\"[4251] But the main thing is to\r\nemancipate the oppressed; \"we showed ourselves philosophers by becoming\r\npaladins,\"[4252] the chivalric sentiment enlisting in the service\r\nof liberty. Other services besides these, more sedentary and less\r\nbrilliant, find no fewer zealots. The chief personages of the provinces\r\nin the provincial assemblies,[4253] the bishops, archbishops, abbés,\r\ndukes, counts, and marquises, with the wealthiest and best informed of\r\nthe notables in the Third-Estate, in all about a thousand persons, in\r\nshort the social elect, the entire upper class convoked by the\r\nking, organize the budget, defend the tax-payer against the fiscal\r\nauthorities, arrange the land-registry, equalize the taille, provide\r\na substitute for the corvée, provide public roads, multiply charitable\r\nasylums, educate agriculturists, proposing, encouraging and directing\r\nevery species of reformatory movement. I have read through the\r\ntwenty volumes of their procès-verbaux: no better citizens, no more\r\nconscientious men, no more devoted administrators can be found, none\r\ngratuitously taking so much trouble on themselves with no object but the\r\npublic welfare. Never was an aristocracy so deserving of power at the\r\nmoment of losing it; the privileged class, aroused from their indolence,\r\nwere again becoming public men, and, restored to their functions, were\r\nreturning to their duties. In 1778, in the first assembly of Berry,\r\nthe Abbé de Seguiran, the reporter, has the courage to state that \"the\r\ndistribution of the taxes should be a fraternal partition of public\r\nobligations.\"[4254] In 1780 the abbés, priors and chapters of the same\r\nprovince contribute 60,000 livres of their funds, and a few gentlemen,\r\nin less than twenty-four hours, contribute 17,000 livres. In 1787,\r\nin the assembly of Alençon the nobility and the clergy tax themselves\r\n30,000 livres to relieve the indigent in each parish subject to\r\ntaxation[4255]. in the month of April, 1787, the king, in an assembly\r\nof the notables, speaks of \"the eagerness with which archbishops and\r\nbishops come forward claiming no exemption in their contributions to\r\nthe public revenue.\" In the month of March, 1789, on the opening of the\r\nbailiwick assemblies, the entire clergy, nearly all the nobility, in\r\nshort, the whole body of the privileged class voluntarily renounce their\r\nprivileges in relation to taxation. The sacrifice is voted unanimously;\r\nthey themselves offer it to the Third-Estate, and it is worth while\r\nto see their generous and sympathetic tone in the manuscript\r\nprocès-verbaux.\r\n\r\n\"The nobility of the bailiwick of Tours,\" says the Marquis de\r\nLusignan,[4256] \"considering that they are men and citizens before being\r\nnobles, can make amends in no way more in conformity with the spirit of\r\njustice and patriotism that animates the body, for the long silence to\r\nwhich it has been condemned by the abuse of ministerial power, than in\r\ndeclaring to their fellow-citizens that, in future, they will claim none\r\nof the pecuniary advantages secured to them by custom, and that they\r\nunanimously and solemnly bind themselves to bear equally, each in\r\nproportion to his fortune, all taxes and general contributions which the\r\nnation shall prescribe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I repeat,\" says the Comte de Buzançois at the meeting of the\r\nThird-Estate of Berry, \"that we are all brothers, and that we are\r\nanxious to share your burdens. . . . We desire to have but one single\r\nvoice go up to the assembly and thus manifest the union and harmony\r\nwhich should prevail there. I am directed to make the proposal to you to\r\nunite with you in one memorandum.\"\r\n\r\n\"These qualities are essential in a deputy,\" says the Marquis de\r\nBarbancon speaking for the nobles of Chateauroux, \"integrity, firmness\r\nand knowledge; the first two are equally found among the deputies of\r\nthe three orders; but knowledge will be more generally found in the\r\nThird-Estate, which is more accustomed to public affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"A new order of things is unfolding before us,\" says the Abbé Legrand in\r\nthe name of the clergy of Chateauroux; \"the veil of prejudice is being\r\ntorn away and giving place to Reason. She is possessing herself of all\r\nFrench hearts, attacking at the root whatever is based on former opinion\r\nand deriving her power only from herself.\"\r\n\r\nNot only do the privileged classes make advances but it is no effort to\r\nthem; they use the same language as the people of the Third-Estate; they\r\nare disciples of the same philosophers and seem to start from the same\r\nprinciples. The nobility of Clermont in Beauvoisis[4257] orders its\r\ndeputies \"to demand, first of all, an explicit declaration of the rights\r\nbelonging to all men.\" The nobles of Mantes and Meulan affirm \"that\r\npolitical principles are as absolute as moral principles, since both\r\nhave reason for a common basis.\" The nobles of Rheims demand \"that the\r\nking be entreated to order the demolition of the Bastille.\" Frequently,\r\nafter such expressions and with such a yielding disposition, the\r\ndelegates of the nobles and clergy are greeted in the assemblies of the\r\n'Third-Estate with the clapping of hands, \"tears\" and enthusiasm. On\r\nwitnessing such effusions how can one avoid believing in concord? And\r\nhow can one foresee strife at the first turn of the road on which they\r\nhave just fraternally entered hand in hand?\r\n\r\nWisdom of this melancholy stamp is not theirs. They set out with the\r\nprinciple that man, and especially the man of the people, is good; why\r\nconjecture that he may desire evil for those who wish him well? They\r\nare conscientious in their benevolence and sympathy for him. Not only do\r\nthey utter these sentiments but they give them proof. \"At this moment,\"\r\nsays a contemporary,[4258] \"the most active pity animates all breasts;\r\nthe great dread of the opulent is to appear insensible.\" The archbishop\r\nof Paris, subsequently followed and stoned, is the donator of 100,000\r\ncrowns to the hospital of the Hôtel-Dieu. The intendant Berthier, who is\r\nto be massacred, draws up the new assessment-roll of the Ile-de-France,\r\nequalizing the taille, which act allows him to abate the rate, at first,\r\nan eighth, and next, a quarter[4259]. The financier Beaujon constructs a\r\nhospital. Necker refuses the salary of his place and lends the treasury\r\ntwo millions to re-establish public credit. The Duc de Charost, from\r\n1770[4260] down, abolishes seigniorial corvées on his domain and founds\r\na hospital in his seigniory of Meillant. The Prince de Beaufremont,\r\nthe presidents de Vezet, de Chamolles, de Chaillot, with many seigniors\r\nbeside in Franche-Comté, follow the example of the king in emancipating\r\ntheir serfs[4261]. The bishop of Saint-Claude demands, in spite of his\r\nchapter, the enfranchisement of his mainmorts. The Marquis de Mirabeau\r\nestablishes on his domain in Limousin a gratuitous bureau for the\r\nsettlement of lawsuits, while daily, at Fleury, he causes nine hundred\r\npounds of cheap bread to be made for the use of \"the poor people, who\r\nfight to see who shall have it.\"[4262] M. de Barral, bishop of Castres,\r\ndirects his curates to preach and to diffuse the cultivation of\r\npotatoes. The Marquis de Guerchy himself mounts on the top of a pile of\r\nhay with Arthur Young to learn how to construct a hay-stack. The\r\nMarquis de Lasteyrie imports lithography into France. A number of grand\r\nseigniors and prelates figure in the agricultural societies, compose or\r\ntranslate useful books, familiarize themselves with the applications of\r\nscience, study political economy, inform themselves about industries,\r\nand interest themselves, either as amateurs or promoters, in every\r\npublic amelioration. \"Never,\" says Lacretelle again, \"were the French\r\nso combined together to combat the evils to which nature makes us\r\npay tribute, and those which in a thousand ways creep into all social\r\ninstitutions.\" Can it be admitted that so many good intentions thus\r\noperating together are to end in destruction?--All take courage,\r\ngovernment as well as the higher class, in the thought of the good\r\naccomplished, or which they desire to accomplish. The king remembers\r\nthat he has restored civil rights to the Protestants, abolished\r\npreliminary torture, suppressed the corvée in kind, established the free\r\ncirculation of grains, instituted provincial assemblies, built up the\r\nmarine, assisted the Americans, emancipated his own serfs, diminished\r\nthe expenses of his household, employed Malesherbes, Turgot and Necker,\r\ngiven full play to the press, and listened to public opinion[4263]. No\r\ngovernment displayed greater mildness; on the 14th of July, 1789, only\r\nseven prisoners were confined in the Bastille, of whom one was an\r\nidiot, another kept there by his family, and four under the charge of\r\ncounterfeiting[4264]. No sovereign was more humane, more charitable,\r\nmore preoccupied with the unfortunate. In 1784, the year of inundations\r\nand epidemics, he renders assistance to the amount of three millions.\r\nAppeals are made to him direct, even for personal accidents. On the\r\n8th of June, 1785, he sends two hundred livres to the wife of a Breton\r\nlaboring-man who, already having two children, brings three at once\r\ninto the world[4265]. During a severe winter he allows the poor daily to\r\ninvade his kitchen. It is quite probable that, next to Turgot, he is\r\nthe man of his day who loved the people most.--His delegates under him\r\nconform to his views; I have read countless letters by intendants who\r\ntry to appear as little Turgots. \"One builds a hospital, another admits\r\nartisans at his table;\"[4266] a certain individual undertakes the\r\ndraining of a marsh. M. de la Tour, in Provence, is so beneficent during\r\na period of forty years that the Tiers-Etat vote him a gold medal in\r\nspite of himself[4267]. A governor delivers a course of lectures on\r\neconomical bread-making.--What possible danger is there for shepherds of\r\nthis kind amidst their flocks? On the king convoking the States-General\r\nnobody had \"any suspicion,\" nor fear of the future. \"A new State\r\nconstitution is spoken of as an easy performance, and as a matter\r\nof course.\"[4268]--\"The best and most virtuous men see in this the\r\nbeginning of a new era of happiness for France and for the whole\r\ncivilized world.

THE MIDDLE CLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Past.\r\n\r\n     The former spirit of the Third-Estate.--Public matters\r\n     concern the king only.--Limits of the Jansenist and\r\n     parliamentarian opposition.\r\n\r\nThe new philosophy, confined to a select circle, had long served as a\r\nmere luxury for refined society. Merchants, manufacturers, shopkeepers,\r\nlawyers, attorneys, physicians, actors, professors, curates, every\r\ndescription of functionary, employee and clerk, the entire middle class,\r\nhad been absorbed with its own cares. The horizon of each was limited,\r\nbeing that of the profession or occupation which each exercised, that\r\nof the corporation in which each one was comprised, of the town in which\r\neach one was born, and, at the utmost, that of the province which each\r\none inhabited[4301]. A dearth of ideas coupled with conscious diffidence\r\nrestrained the bourgeois within his hereditary barriers. His eyes seldom\r\nchanced to wander outside of them into the forbidden and dangerous\r\nterritory of state affairs; hardly was a furtive and rare glance\r\nbestowed on any of the public acts, on the matters which \"belonged to\r\nthe king.\" There was no critical irritability then, except with the\r\nbar, the compulsory satellite of the Parliament, and borne along in its\r\norbit. In 1718, after a session of the royal court (lit de justice), the\r\nlawyers of Paris being on a strike the Regent exclaims angrily and\r\nwith astonishment, \"What! those fellows meddling too!\"[4302] It must\r\nbe stated furthermore that many kept themselves in the background. \"My\r\nfather and myself,\" afterwards writes the advocate Barbier, \"took no\r\npart in the uproars, among those caustic and turbulent spirits.\" and\r\nhe adds this significant article of faith: \"I believe that one has to\r\nfulfill his duties honorably, without concerning oneself with state\r\naffairs, in which one has no mission and exercises no power.\" During\r\nthe first half of the eighteenth century I am able to discover but one\r\ncenter of opposition in the Third-Estate, the Parliament; and around it,\r\nfeeding the flame, the ancient Gallican or Jansenist spirit. \"The\r\ngood city of Paris,\" writes Barbier in 1733, \"is Jansenist from top to\r\nbottom,\" and not alone the magistrates, the lawyers, the professors, the\r\nbest among the bourgeoisie, \"but again the mass of the Parisians, men,\r\nwomen and children, all upholding that doctrine, without comprehending\r\nit, or understanding any of its distinctions and interpretations, out\r\nof hatred to Rome and the Jesuits. Women, the silliest, and even\r\nchambermaids, would be hacked to pieces for it. . .\" This party is\r\nincreased by the honest folks of the kingdom who detest persecutions\r\nand injustice. Accordingly, when the various chambers of magistrates, in\r\nconjunction with the lawyers, tender their resignations and file out of\r\nthe palace \"amidst a countless multitude, the crowd exclaims: Behold\r\nthe true Romans, the fathers of the country! and as the two counselors\r\nPucelle and Menguy pass along they fling them crowns.\" The quarrel\r\nbetween the Parliament and the Court, constantly revived, is one of the\r\nsparks which provokes the grand final explosion, while the Jansenist\r\nembers, smoldering in the ashes, are to be of use in 1791 when the\r\necclesiastical edifice comes to be attacked. But, within this old\r\nchimney-corner only warm embers are now found, firebrands covered\r\nup, sometimes scattering sparks and flames, but in themselves and by\r\nthemselves, not incendiary; the flame is kept within bounds by its\r\nnature, and its supplies limit its heat. The Jansenist is too good\r\na Christian not to respect powers inaugurated from above. The\r\nparliamentarian, conservative through his profession, would be horrified\r\nat overthrowing the established order of things. Both combat for\r\ntradition and against innovation; hence, after having defended the past\r\nagainst arbitrary power they are to defend it against revolutionary\r\nviolence, and to fall, the one into impotency and the other into\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. CHANGE IN THE CONDITION OF THE BOURGEOIS.\r\n\r\n     Change in the condition of the bourgeois.--He becomes\r\n     wealthy.--He makes loans to the State.--The danger of his\r\n     creditorship.--He interests himself in public matters.\r\n\r\nThe uprising is, however, late to catch on among the middle class, and,\r\nbefore it can take hold, the resistant material must gradually be made\r\ninflammable.--In the eighteenth century a great change takes place\r\nin the condition of the Third-Estate. The bourgeois has worked,\r\nmanufactured, traded, earned and saved money, and has daily become\r\nricher and richer.[4303] This great expansion of enterprises, of trade,\r\nof speculation and of fortunes dates from Law;[4304] arrested by war it\r\nreappears with more vigor and more animation at each interval of peace\r\nafter the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, and that of Paris in\r\n1763, and especially after the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI. The\r\nexports of France which amounted to\r\n\r\n 106 millions in 1720\r\n\r\n 124 millions in 1735\r\n\r\n 192 millions in 1748\r\n\r\n 257 millions in 1755\r\n\r\n 309 millions in 1776\r\n\r\n 354 millions in 1788.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 Saint Domingo alone ships back to France for 131 millions of its\r\nproducts, and in return receives 44 millions in merchandise. As a result\r\nof these exchanges we see, at Nantes, and at Bordeaux, the creation of\r\ncolossal commercial houses. \"I consider Bordeaux, says Arthur Young, as\r\nricher and doing more business than any city in England except London;\r\n. . . of late years the progress of maritime commerce has been more rapid\r\nin France than even in England.\"[4305] According to an administrator of\r\nthe day, if the taxes on the consumption of products daily increase the\r\nrevenue, this is because the industry since 1774 has developed a number\r\nof new products[4306]. And this progress is regular and constant. \"We\r\nmay calculate,\" says Necker in 1781, \"on an increase of two millions\r\na year on all the duties on consumption.\"--In this great exertion of\r\ninnovation, labor and engineering, Paris, constantly growing, is the\r\ncentral workshop. It enjoys, to a much greater extent than today,\r\nthe monopoly of all works of intelligence and taste, books, pictures,\r\nengravings, statues, jewelry, toilet details, carriages, furniture,\r\narticles of fashion and rarity, whatever affords pleasure and\r\nornamentation for an elegant worldly society; all Europe is supplied by\r\nit. In 1774 its trade in books is estimated at 45 millions, and that\r\nof London at only one-quarter of that sum[4307]. Upon the profits many\r\nimmense and even more numerous moderate fortunes were built up, and\r\nthese now became available for investment.--In fact, we see the noblest\r\nhands stretching out to receive them, princes of the blood, provincial\r\nassemblies, assemblies of the clergy, and, at the head of all, the king,\r\nwho, the most needy, borrows at ten percent and is always in search of\r\nadditional lenders. Already under Fleury, the debt has augmented to 18\r\nmillions in interests, and during the Seven years' War, to 34 millions.\r\nUnder Louis XVI., M. Necker borrows a capital of 530 millions; M.\r\nJoly de Fleury, 300 millions; M. de Calonne, 800 millions; in all 1630\r\nmillions over a period of ten years. The interest of the public debt,\r\nonly 45 millions in 1755, reaches 106 millions in 1776 and amounts to\r\n206 millions in 1789[4308]. What creditors which these few figures\r\ntell us about! As the Third-Estate, it must be noted, is the sole class\r\nmaking and saving money, nearly all these creditors belong it. Thousands\r\nof others must be added to these. In the first place, the financiers\r\nwho make advances to the government, advances that are indispensable,\r\nbecause, from time immemorial, it has eaten its corn on the blade, so\r\nthe present year is always gnawing into the product of coming years;\r\nthere are 80 millions of advances in 1759, and 170 millions in 1783. In\r\nthe second place there are so many suppliers, large and small, who, on\r\nall parts of the territory, keep accounts with the government for their\r\nsupplies and for public works, a veritable army and increasing\r\ndaily, since the government, impelled by centralization, takes sole\r\nresponsibility for all ventures, and, requested by public opinion, it\r\nincreases the number of undertakings useful to the public. Under Louis\r\nXV. the State builds six thousand leagues of roads, and under Louis XVI.\r\nin 1788, to guard against famine, it purchases grain to the amount of\r\nforty millions.\r\n\r\nThrough this increase of activity and its demands for capital the State\r\nbecomes the universal debtor; henceforth public affairs are no longer\r\nexclusively the king's business. His creditors become uneasy at his\r\nexpenditures; for it is their money he wastes, and, if he proves a bad\r\nadministrator, they will be ruined. They want to know something of his\r\nbudget, to examine his books: a lender always has the right to look\r\nafter his securities. We accordingly see the bourgeois raising his\r\nhead and beginning to pay close attention to the great machine whose\r\nperformances, hitherto concealed from vulgar eyes, have, up to the\r\npresent time, been kept a state secret. He becomes a politician, and, at\r\nthe same time, discontented. For it cannot be denied that these matters,\r\nin which he is interested, are badly conducted. Any young man of good\r\nfamily managing affairs in the same way would be checked. The expenses\r\nof the administration of the State are always in excess of the\r\nrevenue[4309]. According to official admissions[4310] the annual deficit\r\namounted to 70 in 1770, and 80 millions in 1783; when one has attempted\r\nto reduce this it has been through bankruptcies; one to the tune of two\r\nmilliards at the end of the reign of Louis XIV, and another almost equal\r\nto it in the time of Law, and another on from a third to a half of all\r\nthe interests in the time of Terray, without mentioning suppressions in\r\ndetail, reductions, indefinite delays in payment, and other violent and\r\nfraudulent means which a powerful debtor employs with impunity against\r\na feeble creditor. \"Fifty-six violations of public faith have occurred\r\nfrom Henry IV down to the ministry of M. de Loménie inclusive,\"[4311]\r\nwhile a last bankruptcy, more frightful than the others, loom up on the\r\nhorizon. Several persons, Bezenval and Linguet for instance, earnestly\r\nrecommend it as a necessary and salutary amputation. Not only are there\r\nprecedents for this, and in this respect the government will do no more\r\nthan follow its own example, but such is its daily practice, since it\r\nlives only from day to day, by dint of expedients and delays, digging\r\none hole to stop up another, and escaping failure only through the\r\nforced patience which it imposes on its creditors. With it, says a\r\ncontemporary, people were never sure of anything, being always obliged\r\nto wait[4312]. \"Were their capital invested in its loans, they could\r\nnever rely on a fixed date for the payment of interest. Did they build\r\nships, repair highways, or the soldiers clothed, they had no guarantees\r\nfor their advances, no certificates of repayment, being reduced to\r\ncalculate the chances involved in a ministerial contract as they would\r\nthe risks of a bold speculation.\" It pays if it can and only when it\r\ncan, even the members of the household, the purveyors of the table and\r\nthe personal attendants of the king. In 1753 the domestics of Louis XV\r\nhad received nothing for three years. We have seen how his grooms\r\nwent out to beg during the night in the streets of Versailles; how his\r\npurveyors \"hid themselves;\" how, under Louis XVI in 1778, there were\r\n792,620 francs due to the wine-merchant, and 3,467,980 francs to the\r\npurveyor of fish and meat[4313]. In 1788, so great is the distress,\r\nthe Minister de Loménie appropriates and expends the funds of a private\r\nsubscription raised for a hospital, and, at the time of his resignation,\r\nthe treasury is empty, save 450,000 francs, half of which he puts in\r\nhis pocket. What an administration!--In the presence of this debtor,\r\nevidently becoming insolvent, all people, far and near, interested in\r\nhis business, consult together with alarm, and debtors are innumerable,\r\nconsisting of bankers, merchants, manufacturers, employees, lenders of\r\nevery kind and degree, and, in the front rank, the capitalists, who have\r\nput all their means for life into his hands, and who are to beg\r\nshould he not pay them annually the 44 millions he owes them; the\r\nindustrialists and traders who have entrusted their commercial integrity\r\nto him and who would shrink with horror from failure as its issue; and\r\nafter these come their creditors, their clerks, their relations, in\r\nshort, the largest portion of the laboring and peaceable class which,\r\nthus far, had obeyed without a murmur and never dreamed of bringing the\r\nestablished order of things under its control. Henceforth this class\r\nwill exercise control attentively, distrustfully and angrily. Woe to\r\nthose who are at fault, for they well know that the ruin of the State is\r\ntheir ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Social Promotion.\r\n\r\n     He rises on the social ladder.--The noble draws near to him.\r\n    --He becomes cultivated.--He enters into society.--He\r\n     regards himself as the equal of the noble.--Privileges an\r\n     annoyance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile this class has climbed up the social ladder, and, through its\r\nélite, rejoined those in the highest position. Formerly between Dorante\r\nand M. Jourdain, between Don Juan and M. Dimanche,[4314] between M.\r\nSotenville himself and Georges Dandin, the distance was vast; everything\r\nwas different--dress, house, habits, characters, points of honor,\r\nideas and language. On the one hand the nobles are drawn nearer to the\r\nThird-Estate and, on the other, the Third-Estate is drawn nearer to the\r\nnobles, actual equality having preceded equality as a right.--On the\r\napproach of the year 1789 it was difficult to distinguish one from the\r\nother in the street. The sword is no longer worn by gentlemen in the\r\ncity; they have abandoned embroideries and laces, and walk about in\r\nplain frock-coats, or drive themselves in their cabriolets[4315]. \"The\r\nsimplicity of English customs,\" and the customs of the Third-Estate seem\r\nto them better adapted to ordinary life. Their prominence proves irksome\r\nto them and they grow weary of being always on parade. Henceforth\r\nthey accept familiarity that they may enjoy freedom of action, and\r\nare content \"to mingle with their fellow-citizens without obstacle\r\nor ostentation.----\"It is certainly a grave sign, and the old feudal\r\nspirits have reason to tremble. The Marquis de Mirabeau, on learning\r\nthat his son wishes to act as his own lawyer, consoles himself by seeing\r\nothers, of still higher rank, do much worse[4316].\r\n\r\n\"As it was difficult to accept the idea that the grandson of my father,\r\nwhom we just had seen pass by on the promenade, everybody, young and\r\nold, raising their hats to him from afar, would soon be seen at the\r\nbar of a lower tribunal, there to contest minor legal matters with\r\npettifoggers; but I said to myself, however, that Louis XIV would\r\nbe still more astonished had he seen the wife of his grand-successor\r\ndressed in a peasant's frock and apron, with no attendants, not a page\r\nor any one else, running about the palace and the terraces, requesting\r\nthe first scamp in a frock-coat she encountered to give her his hand,\r\nwhich he simply does, all the way down to the foot of the steps.\"\r\n\r\nBut the leveling of manners and appearances of life reflected, indeed,\r\nonly an equalization of minds and tempers. The antique scenery being\r\ntorn away indicates the disappearance of the sentiments to which it\r\nbelonged. It indicated gravity, dignity, custom of self-control and of\r\nexposed, in authority and command. It was the rigid and sumptuous\r\nparade of a social corps of staff-officers. At this time the parade is\r\ndiscontinued because the corps has been dissolved. If the nobles dress\r\nlike the bourgeoisie it is owing to their having become bourgeois, that\r\nis to say, idlers retired from business, with nothing to do but to talk\r\nand amuse themselves.--Undoubtedly they amuse themselves and converse\r\nlike people of refinement; but it is not very difficult to equal them in\r\nthis respect. Now that the Third-Estate has acquired its wealth a good\r\nmany commoners have become people of society. The successors of\r\nSamuel Bernard are no longer so many Turcarets, but Paris-Duverneys,\r\nSaint-Jameses, Labordes, refined men, people of culture and of feeling,\r\npossessing tact, literary and philosophical attainments, benevolent,\r\ngiving parties and knowing how to entertain[4317]. With them, slightly\r\ndifferent, we find the same company as with a grand lord, the same ideas\r\nand the same tone. Their sons, messieurs de Villemer, de Francueil,\r\nd'Epinay, throw money out of the window with as much elegance as the\r\nyoung dukes with whom they sup. A parvenu with money and intellect\r\nsoon learns the ropes, and his son, if not himself, is initiated: a few\r\nyears' exercises in an academy, a dancing-master, and one of the four\r\nthousand public offices which confer nobility, supply him with the\r\ndeficient appearances. Now, in these times, as soon as one knows how to\r\nconform to the laws of good-breeding, how to bow and how to converse,\r\none possesses a patent for admission everywhere. An Englishman[4318]\r\nremarks that one of the first expressions employed in praise of a man\r\nis, \"he has a very graceful address.\" The Maréchale de Luxembourg,\r\nso high-spirited, always selects Laharpe as her cavalier, because \"he\r\noffers his arm so well.\"--The commoner not only enters the drawing-room,\r\nif he is fitted for it, but he stands foremost in it if he has\r\nany talent. The first place in conversation, and even in public\r\nconsideration, is for Voltaire, the son of a notary, for Diderot, the\r\nson of a cutler, for Rousseau, the son of a watchmaker, for d'Alembert,\r\na foundling brought up by a glazier; and, after the great men have\r\ndisappeared, and no writers of the second grade are left, the leading\r\nduchesses are still content to have the seats at their tables occupied\r\nby Champfort, another foundling, Beaumarchais, the son of another\r\nwatchmaker, Laharpe, supported and raised on charity, Marmontel, the\r\nson of a village tailor, and may others of less note, in short, every\r\nparvenu possessing wit.\r\n\r\nThe nobility, to perfect their own accomplishments, borrow their pens\r\nand aspire to their successes. \"We have recovered from those old Gothic\r\nand absurd prejudices against literary culture,\" says the Prince de\r\nHénin;[4319] \"as for myself I would compose a comedy to-morrow if I had\r\nthe talent, and if I happened to be made a little angry, I would perform\r\nin it.\" And, in fact, \"the Vicomte de Ségur, son of the minister of war,\r\nplays the part of the lover in 'Nina' on Mlle. de Guimard's stage\r\nwith the actors of the Italian Comedy.\"[4320] One of Mme. de Genlis's\r\npersonages, returning to Paris after five years' absence, says that \"he\r\nleft men wholly devoted to play, hunting, and their small houses, and he\r\nfinds them all turned authors.\"[4321] They hawk about their tragedies,\r\ncomedies, novels, eclogues, dissertations and treatises of all kinds\r\nfrom one drawing room to another. They strive to get their pieces\r\nplayed; they previously submit them to the judgment of actors; they\r\nsolicit a word of praise from the Mercure; they read fables at the\r\nsittings of the Academy. They become involved in the bickering, in the\r\nvainglory, in the pettiness of literary life, and still worse, of the\r\nlife of the stage, inasmuch as they are themselves performers and play\r\nin company with real actors in hundreds of private theaters. Add to\r\nthis, if you please, other petty amateur talents such as sketching\r\nin water-colors, writing songs, and playing the flute.--After this\r\namalgamation of classes and this transfer of parts what remains of\r\nthe superiority of the nobles? By what special merit, through what\r\nrecognized capacity are they to secure respect of a member of the\r\nThird-Estate? Outside of fashionable elegance and a few points of\r\nbreeding, in what respect they differ from him? What superior education,\r\nwhat familiarity with affairs, what experience with government, what\r\npolitical instruction, what local ascendancy, what moral authority can\r\nbe alleged to sanction their pretensions to the highest places?--In the\r\nway of practice, the Third-Estate already does the work, providing the\r\nqualified men, the intendants, the ministerial head-clerks, the lay and\r\necclesiastical administrators, the competent laborers of all kinds and\r\ndegrees. Call to mind the Marquis of whom we have just spoken, a former\r\ncaptain in the French guards, a man of feeling and of loyalty, admitting\r\nat the elections of 1789 that \"the knowledge essential to a deputy\r\nwould most generally be found in the Third-Estate, the mind there being\r\naccustomed to business.\"--In the way of theory: the commoner is as\r\nwell-informed as the noble, and he thinks he is still better informed,\r\nbecause, having read the same books and arrived at the same principles,\r\nhe does not, like him, stop half-way on the road to their consequences,\r\nbut plunges headlong to the very depths of the doctrine, convinced that\r\nhis logic is clairvoyance and that he is more enlightened because he is\r\nthe least prejudiced.--Consider the young men who, about twenty years of\r\nage in 1780, born in industrious families, accustomed to effort and able\r\nto work twelve hours a day, a Barnave, a Carnot, a Roederer, a Merlin de\r\nThionville, a Robespierre, an energetic stock, feeling their strength,\r\ncriticizing their rivals, aware of their weakness, comparing their own\r\napplication and education to their levity and incompetence, and, at\r\nthe moment when youthful ambition stirs within them, seeing themselves\r\nexcluded in advance from any superior position, consigned for life to\r\nsubaltern employment, and subjected in every career to the precedence\r\nof superiors who they hardly recognize as their equals. At the artillery\r\nexaminations where Chérin, the genealogist, refuses commoners, and where\r\nthe Abbé Bosen, a mathematician, rejects the ignorant, it is discovered\r\nthat capacity is wanting among the noble pupils and nobility among the\r\ncapable pupils,[4322] the two qualities of gentility and intelligence\r\nseeming to exclude each other, as there are but four or five out of a\r\nhundred pupils who combine the two conditions. Now, as society at\r\nthis time is mixed, such tests are frequent and easy. Whether lawyer,\r\nphysician, or man of letters, a member of the Third-Estate with whom\r\na duke converses familiarly, who sits in a diligence alongside of a\r\ncount-colonel of hussars,[4323] can appreciate his companion or his\r\ninterlocutor, weigh his ideas, test his merit and esteem him at his\r\ncorrect value, and I am sure that he does not overrate him.--Now that\r\nthe nobles have lost their special capacities and the Third-Estate\r\nhave acquired general competence, and as they are on the same level in\r\neducation and competence, the inequality which separates them has become\r\noffensive because it has become useless. Nobility being instituted by\r\ncustom is no longer sanctified by conscience; the Third-Estate being\r\njustly excited against privileges that have no justification, whether in\r\nthe capacity of the noble or in the incapacity of the bourgeois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Rousseau's Philosophy Spreads And Takes HOLD.\r\n\r\n     Philosophy in the minds thus fitted for it.--That of\r\n     Rousseau prominent.--This philosophy in harmony with new\r\n     necessities.--It is adopted by the Third-Estate.\r\n\r\nDistrust and anger against a government putting all fortunes at risk,\r\nrancor and hostility against a nobility barring all roads to popular\r\nadvancement, are, then, the sentiments developing themselves among the\r\nmiddle class solely due to their advance in wealth and culture.--We\r\ncan imagine the effect of the new philosophy upon people with such\r\nattitudes. At first, confined to the aristocratic reservoir, the\r\ndoctrine filters out through numerous cracks like so many trickling\r\nstreams, to scatter imperceptibly among the lower class. Already, in\r\n1727, Barbier, a bourgeois of the old school and having little knowledge\r\nof philosophy and philosophers except the name, writes in his journal:\r\n\r\n\"A hundred poor families are deprived of the annuities on which they\r\nsupported themselves, acquired with bonds for which the capital is\r\nobliterated; 56,000 livres are given in pensions to people who have held\r\nthe best offices, where they have amassed considerable property, always\r\nat the expense of the people, and all this merely that they may rest\r\nthemselves and do nothing.\"[4324]\r\n\r\nOne by one, reformative ideas penetrate to his office of consulting\r\nadvocate; conversation has sufficed to propagate them, homely common\r\nsense needing no philosophy to secure their recognition.\r\n\r\n\"The tax on property,\" said he, in 1750, \"should be proportioned and\r\nequally distributed among all the king's subjects and the members of the\r\ngovernment, in proportion to the property each really possesses in\r\nthe kingdom; in England, the lands of the nobility, the clergy and the\r\nThird-Estate pay alike without distinction, and nothing is more just.\"\r\n\r\nIn the six years which follow the flood increases. People denounce the\r\ngovernment in the cafés, on their promenades, while the police dare not\r\narrest malcontents \"because they would have to arrest everybody.\" The\r\ndisaffection goes on increasing up to the end of the reign. In 1744,\r\nsays the bookseller Hardy, during the king's illness at Metz, private\r\nindividuals cause six thousand masses to be said for his recovery and\r\npay for them at the sacristy of Notre Dame; in 1757, after Damiens's\r\nattempt on the king's life, the number of masses demanded is only six\r\nhundred; in 1774, during the malady which carries him off, the number\r\nfalls down to three. The complete discredit of the government, the\r\nimmense success of Rousseau, these two events, occurring\r\nsimultaneously, afford a date for the conversion of the Third-Estate\r\nto philosophy[4325]. A traveler, at the beginning of the reign of Louis\r\nXVI, who returns home after some years' absence, on being asked what\r\nchange he noticed in the nation, replied, \"Nothing, except that\r\nwhat used to be talked about in the drawing-rooms is repeated in the\r\nstreets.\"[4326] And that which is repeated in the streets is Rousseau's\r\ndoctrine, the Discourse on Inequality, the Social Contract amplified,\r\npopularized and repeated by adherents in every possible way and in\r\nall their forms. What could be more fascinating for the man of the\r\nThird-Estate? Not only is this theory in vogue, and encountered by him\r\nat the decisive moment when, for the first time, he turns his attention\r\nto general principles, but again it provides him with arms against\r\nsocial inequality and political absolutism, and much sharper than he\r\nneeds. To people disposed to put restraints on power and to abolish\r\nprivileges, what guide is more sympathetic than the writer of genius,\r\nthe powerful logician, the impassioned orator, who establishes natural\r\nlaw, who repudiates historic law, who proclaims the equality of men, who\r\ncontends for the sovereignty of the people, who denounces on every page\r\nthe usurpation, the vices, the worthlessness, the malefactions of the\r\ngreat and of kings! And I omit the points by which he makes acceptable\r\nto a rigid and laborious bourgeoisie, to the new men that are working\r\nand advancing themselves, his steady earnestness, his harsh and bitter\r\ntone, his eulogy of simple habits, of domestic virtues, of personal\r\nmerit, of virile energy, the commoner addressing commoners. It is\r\nnot surprising that they should accept him as a guide and welcome\r\nhis doctrines with that fervor of faith called enthusiasm, and which\r\ninvariably accompanies the newborn idea as well as the first love.\r\n\r\nA competent judge, and an eye-witness, Mallet du Pan,[4327] writes in\r\n1799:\r\n\r\n\"Rousseau had a hundred times more readers among the middle and lower\r\nclasses than Voltaire. He alone inoculated the French with the doctrine\r\nof the sovereignty of the people and with its extremist consequences.\r\nIt would be difficult to cite a single revolutionary who was not\r\ntransported over these anarchical theories, and who did not burn\r\nwith ardor to realize them. That Contrat Social, the disintegrator of\r\nsocieties, was the Koran of the pretentious talkers of 1789, of the\r\nJacobins of 1790, of the republicans of 1791, and of the most atrocious\r\nof the madmen. . . . I heard Marat in 1788 read and comment on the\r\nContrat Social in the public streets to the applause of an enthusiastic\r\nauditory.\"\r\n\r\nThe same year, in an immense throng filling the great hall of the Palais\r\nde Justice, Lacretelle hears that same book quoted, its dogmas put\r\nforward by the clerks of la Bazoche, \"by members of the bar,[4328]\r\nby young lawyers, by the ordinary lettered classes swarming with\r\nnew-fledged specialist in public law.\" Hundreds of details show us that\r\nit is in every hand like a catechism. In 1784[4329] certain magistrates'\r\nsons, on taking their first lesson in jurisprudence of an assistant\r\nprofessor, M. Saveste, have the \"Contrat Social\" placed in their hands\r\nas a manual. Those who find this new political geometry too difficult\r\nlearn at least its axioms, and if these repel them they discover at\r\nleast their palpable consequences, so many handy comparisons, the\r\ntrifling common practice in the literature in vogue, whether drama,\r\nhistory, or romance[4330]. Through the \"Eloges\" by Thomas, the pastorals\r\nof Bernadin de Saint-Pierre, the compilation of Raynal, the comedies of\r\nBeaumarchais and even the \"Young Anarcharsis\" and the literature of\r\nthe resuscitated Greek and Roman antiquity, the dogmas of equality and\r\nliberty infiltrate and penetrate the class able to read[4331]. \"A few\r\ndays ago,\" says Métra,[4332] \"a dinner of forty ecclesiastics from the\r\ncountry took place at the house of curate of Orangis, five leagues from\r\nParis. At the dessert, and in the truth which came out over their\r\nwine, they all admitted that they came to Paris to see the 'Marriage of\r\nFigaro.'. . Up to the present time it seems as if comic authors intended\r\nto make sport for the great at the expense of the little, but here, on\r\nthe contrary, it is the little who laugh at the expense of the great.\"\r\nHence the success of the piece.--Hence a steward of a chateau has found\r\na Raynal in the library, the furious declamation of which so delights\r\nhim that he can repeat it thirty years later without stumbling, or a\r\nsergeant in the French guards embroiders waistcoats during the night\r\nto earn the money with which to purchase the latest books.--After the\r\ngallant picture of the boudoir comes the austere and patriotic picture;\r\n\"Belisarious\" and the \"Horatii\" of David reflect the new attitude both\r\nof the public and of the studios[4333] The spirit is that of Rousseau,\r\n\"the republican spirit;\"[4334] the entire middle class, artists,\r\nemployees, curates, physicians, attorneys, advocates, the lettered and\r\nthe journalists, all are won over to it; and it is fed by the worst as\r\nwell as the best passions, ambition, envy, desire for freedom, zeal for\r\nthe public welfare and the consciousness of right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Revolutionary Passions.\r\n\r\n     Its effects therein.--The formation of revolutionary\r\n     passions.--Leveling instincts.--The craving for dominion.--\r\n     The Third-Estate decides and constitutes the nation.--\r\n     Chimeras, ignorance, exaltation.\r\n\r\nAll these passions intensify each other. There is nothing like a wrong\r\nto quicken the sentiment of justice. There is nothing like the sentiment\r\nof justice to quicken the injury proceeding from a wrong[4335]. The\r\nThird-Estate, considering itself deprived of the place to which it\r\nis entitled, finds itself uncomfortable in the place it occupies and,\r\naccordingly, suffers through a thousand petty grievances it would not,\r\nformerly, have noticed. On discovering that he is a citizen a man is\r\nirritated at being treated as a subject, no one accepting an inferior\r\nposition alongside of one of whom he believes himself the equal. Hence,\r\nduring a period of twenty years, the ancient régime while attempting\r\nto grow easier, appear to be still more burdensome, and its pinpricks\r\nexasperate as if they were so many wounds. Countless instances might\r\nbe quoted instead of one.--At the theater in Grenoble, Barnave,[4336] a\r\nchild, is with his mother in a box which the Duc de Tonnerre, governor\r\nof the province, had assigned to one of his satellites. The manager of\r\nthe theater, and next an officer of the guard, request Madame Barnave to\r\nwithdraw. She refuses, whereupon the governor orders four fusiliers to\r\nforce her out. The audience in the stalls had already taken the matter\r\nup, and violence was feared, when M. Barnave, advised of the affront,\r\nentered and led his wife away, exclaiming aloud, \"I leave by order of\r\nthe governor.\" The indignant public, all the bourgeoisie, agreed among\r\nthemselves not to enter the theater again without an apology being\r\nmade; the theater, in fact, remaining empty several months, until Madame\r\nBarnave consented to reappear there. This outrage afterwards recurred to\r\nthe future deputy, and he then swore \"to elevate the caste to which he\r\nbelonged out of the humiliation to which it seemed condemned.\" In like\r\nmanner Lacroix, the future member of the Convention,[4337] on leaving\r\na theater, and jostled by a gentleman who was giving his arm to a lady,\r\nutters a loud complaint. \"Who are you?\" says the person. Still\r\nthe provincial, he is simple enough to give his name, surname, and\r\nqualifications in full. \"Very well,\" says the other man, \"good for\r\nyou--I am the Comte de Chabannes, and I am in a hurry,\" saying which,\r\n\"laughing heartily,\" he jumps into his vehicle. \"Ah, sir, exclaimed\r\nLacroix, still much excited by his misadventure, \"pride and prejudice\r\nestablish an awful gulf between man and man!\" We may rest assured that,\r\nwith Marat, a veterinary surgeon in the Comte d'Artois's stables,\r\nwith Robespierre, a protégé of the bishop of Arras, with Danton, an\r\ninsignificant lawyer in Mery-sur-Seine, and with many others beside,\r\nself-esteem, in frequent encounters, bled in the same fashion. The\r\nconcentrated bitterness with which Madame Roland's memoirs are imbued\r\nhas no other cause. \"She could not forgive society[4338] for the\r\ninferior position she had so long occupied in it.\"[4339] Thanks to\r\nRousseau, vanity, so natural to man, and especially sensitive with a\r\nFrenchman, becomes still more sensitive. The slightest discrimination, a\r\ntone of the voice, seems a mark of disdain. \"One day,[4340] on alluding,\r\nbefore the minister of war, to a general officer who had obtained his\r\nrank through his merit, he exclaimed, 'Oh, yes, an officer of luck.'\r\nThis expression, being repeated and commented on, does much mischief.\"\r\nIn vain do the grandees show their condescending spirit, \"welcoming with\r\nequal kindness and gentleness all who are presented to them.\" In the\r\nmansion of the Due de Penthièvre the nobles eat at the table of the\r\nmaster of the house, the commoners dine with his first gentleman and\r\nonly enter the drawing room when coffee is served. There they find \"in\r\nfull force and with a superior tone\" the others who had the honor\r\nof dining with His Highness, and \"who do not fail to salute the new\r\narrivals with an obliging civility indicating patronage.\"[4341] No more\r\nis required; in vain does the Duke \"carry his attentions to an extreme,\"\r\nBeugnot, so pliable, has no desire to return. They bear them ill-will,\r\nnot only on account of their slight bows but again on account of their\r\nover-politeness. Champfort acrimoniously relates that d'Alembert, at the\r\nheight of his reputation, being in Madame du Deffant's drawing room\r\nwith President Hénault and M. de Pont-de-Veyle, a physician enters named\r\nFournier, and he, addressing Madame du Deffant, says, \"Madame, I have\r\nthe honor of presenting you with my very humble respects;'' turning to\r\nPresident Hénault, \"I have the honor to be your obedient servant,\"\r\nand then to M. de Pont-de-Veyle, \"Sir, your most obedient,\" and to\r\nd'Alembert, \"Good day, sir.\"[4342] To a rebellious heart everything is\r\nan object of resentment. The Third-Estate, following Rousseau's example,\r\ncherishes ill-feeling against the nobles for what they do, and yet\r\nagain, for what they are, for their luxury, their elegance, their\r\ninsincerity, their refined and brilliant behavior. Champfort is\r\nembittered against them on account of the polite attentions with which\r\nthey overwhelm him. Sieyès bears them a grudge on account of a promised\r\nabbey which he did not obtain. Each individual, besides the general\r\ngrievances, has his personal grievance. Their coolness, like their\r\nfamiliarity, attentions and inattentions, is an offense, and, under\r\nthese millions of needle-thrusts, real or imaginary, the mind gets to be\r\nfull of gall. In 1789, it is full to overflowing.\r\n\r\n\"The most honorable title of the French nobility,\" writes Champfort, \"is\r\na direct descent from some 30,000 armed, helmeted, armletted and armored\r\nmen who, on heavy horses sheathed in armor, trod under foot 8 or 10\r\nmillions of naked men, the ancestors of the actual nation. Behold\r\nthese well-established claims to the respect and affection of their\r\ndescendants! And, to complete the respectability of this nobility, it\r\nis recruited and regenerated by the adoption of those who have acquired\r\nfortune by plundering the cabins of the poor who are unable to pay its\r\nimpositions.\"[4343]--\r\n\r\n\"Why should not the Third-Estate send back,\" says Sieyès, \"into the\r\nforests of Franconia every family that maintains its absurd pretension\r\nof having sprung from the loins of a race of conquerors, and of having\r\nsucceeded to the rights of conquest? [4344] I can well imagine, were\r\nthere no police, every Cartouche[4345] firmly establishing himself on\r\nthe high-road--would that give him a right to levy toll? Suppose him\r\nto sell a monopoly of this kind, once common enough, to an honest\r\nsuccessor, would the right become any more respectable in the hands of\r\nthe purchaser?. . . Every privilege, in its nature, is unjust, odious,\r\nand against the social compact. The blood boils at the thought of its\r\never having been possible to legally consecrate down to the eighteenth\r\ncentury the abominable fruits of an abominable feudal system. . . . The\r\ncaste of nobles is really a population apart, a fraudulent population,\r\nhowever, which, for lack of serviceable faculties, and unable to exist\r\nalone, fastens itself upon a living nation, like the vegetable tumors\r\nthat support themselves on the sap of the plants to which they are a\r\nburden, and which wither beneath the load.\"--They suck all, everything\r\nbeing for them. \"Every branch of the executive power has fallen into the\r\nhands of this caste, which staffed (already) the church, the robe and\r\nthe sword. A sort of confraternity or joint paternity leads the nobles\r\neach to prefer the other and all to the rest of the nation. . . . The\r\nCourt reigns, and not the monarch. The Court creates and distributes\r\noffices. And what is the Court but the head of this vast aristocracy\r\nthat covers all parts of France, and which, through its members, attains\r\nto and exercises everywhere whatever is requisite in all branches of the\r\npublic administration?\"--Let us put an end to \"this social crime, this\r\nlong parricide which one class does itself the honor to commit daily\r\nagainst the others. . . . Ask no longer what place the privileged shall\r\noccupy in the social order; it is simply asking what place in a sick\r\nman's body must be assigned to a malignant ulcer that is undermining and\r\ntormenting it. . . to the loathsome disease that is consuming the living\r\nflesh.\"--The solution is self-evident: let us eradicate the ulcer, or at\r\nleast sweep away the vermin. The Third-Estate, in itself and by itself,\r\nis \"a complete nation,\" requiring no organ, needing no aid to subsist or\r\nto govern itself, and which will recover its health on ridding itself of\r\nthe parasites infesting its skin.\r\n\r\n\"What is the Third-Estate?\" says Sieyès, \"everything. What, thus far, is\r\nit in the political body?[4346] Nothing. What does it demand? To become\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nNot something but actually everything. Its political ambition is as\r\ngreat as its social ambition, and it aspires to authority as well as to\r\nequality. If privileges are an evil that of the king is the worst for\r\nit is the greatest, and human dignity, wounded by the prerogative of the\r\nnoble, perishes under the absolutism of the king. Of little consequence\r\nis it that he scarcely uses it, and that his government, deferential\r\nto public opinion, is that of a hesitating and indulgent parent.\r\nEmancipated from real despotism, the Third-Estate becomes excited\r\nagainst possible despotism, imagining itself in slavery in consenting to\r\nremain subject. A proud spirit has recovered itself, become erect, and,\r\nthe better to secure its rights, is going to claim all rights. To the\r\npeople who since antiquity has been subject to masters, it is so sweet,\r\nso intoxicating to put themselves in their places, to put the former\r\nmasters in their place, to say to himself, they are my representatives,\r\nto regard himself a member of the sovereign power, king of France in his\r\nindividual sphere, the sole legitimate author of all rights and of all\r\nfunctions!--In conformity with the doctrines of Rousseau the registers\r\nof the Third-Estate unanimously insist on a constitution for France;\r\nnone exists, or at least the one she possesses is of no value. Thus far\r\n\"the conditions of the social compact have been ignored;\"[4347] now that\r\nthey have been discovered they must be written out. To say, with the\r\nnobles according to Montesquieu, that the constitution exists, that its\r\ngreat features need not be changed, that it is necessary only to reform\r\nabuses, that the States-General exercise only limited power, that they\r\nare incompetent to substitute another regime for the monarchy, is not\r\ntrue. Tacitly or expressly, the Third-Estate refuses to restrict its\r\nmandate and allows no barriers to be interposed against it. It requires\r\nits deputies accordingly to vote \"not by orders but each by himself and\r\nconjointly.\"--\"In case the deputies of the clergy or of the nobility\r\nshould refuse to deliberate in common and individually, the deputies\r\nof the Third-Estate, representing twenty-four millions of men, able and\r\nobliged to declare itself the National Assembly not-withstanding the\r\nscission of the representation of 400,000 persons, will propose to the\r\nKing in concert with those among the Clergy and the Nobility disposed\r\nto join them, their assistance in providing for the necessities of the\r\nState, and the taxes thus assented to shall be apportioned among all the\r\nsubjects of the king without distinction.\"[4348]--Do not object that\r\na people thus mutilated becomes a mere crowd, that leaders cannot be\r\nimprovised, that it is difficult to dispense with natural guides, that,\r\nconsidering all things, this Clergy and this Nobility still form a\r\nselect group, that two-fifths of the soil is in their hands, that\r\none-half of the intelligent and cultivated class of men are in their\r\nranks, that they are exceedingly well-disposed and that old historic\r\nbodies have always afforded to liberal constitutions their best\r\nsupports. According to the principle enunciated by Rousseau we are\r\nnot to value men but to count them. In politics numbers only are\r\nrespectable; neither birth, nor property, nor function, nor capacity, is\r\na title to be considered; high or low, ignorant or learned, a general, a\r\nsoldier, or a hod-carrier, each individual of the social army is a unit\r\nprovided with a vote; wherever a majority is found there is the right.\r\nHence, the Third-Estate puts forth its right as incontestable, and, in\r\nits turn, it proclaims with Louis XIV, \"I am the State.\"\r\n\r\nThis principle once admitted or enforced, they thought, all will go\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed,\" says an eye-witness,[4349] \"as if we were about to be\r\ngoverned by men of the golden age. This free, just and wise people,\r\nalways in harmony with itself, always clear-sighted in choosing its\r\nministers, moderate in the use of its strength and power, never could be\r\nled away, never deceived, never under the dominion of; or enslaved by,\r\nthe authority which it confided. Its will would fashion the laws and the\r\nlaw would constitute its happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe nation is to be regenerated, a phrase found in all writings and\r\nin every mouth. At Nangis, Arthur Young finds this the sub-stance of\r\npolitical conversation[4350]. The chaplain of a regiment, a curate in\r\nthe vicinity, keeps fast hold of it; as to knowing what it means that\r\nis another matter. It is impossible to find anything out through\r\nexplanations of it otherwise than \"a theoretic perfection of government,\r\nquestionable in its origin, hazardous in its progress, and visionary in\r\nits end.\" On the Englishman proposing to them the British constitution\r\nas a model they \"hold it cheap in respect of liberty\" and greet it with\r\na smile; it is, especially, not in conformity with \"the principles.\" And\r\nobserve that we are at the residence of a grand seignior, in a circle\r\nof enlightened men. At Riom, at the election assemblies,[4351] Malouet\r\nfinds \"persons of an ordinary stamp, practitioners, petty lawyers,\r\nwith no experience of public business, quoting the 'Contrat Social,'\r\nvehemently declaiming against tyranny, and each proposing his own\r\nconstitution.\" Most of them are without any knowledge whatever, mere\r\ntraffickers in chicane; the best instructed entertain mere schoolboy\r\nideas of politics. In the colleges of the University no history is\r\ntaught[4352]. \"The name of Henry IV., says Lavalette, was not once\r\nuttered during my eight years of study, and, at seventeen years of age,\r\nI was still ignorant of the epoch and the mode of the establishment\r\nof the Bourbons on the throne.\" The stock they carry away with them\r\nconsists wholly, as with Camille Desmoulins, of scraps of Latin,\r\nentering the world with brains stuffed with \"republican maxims,\" excited\r\nby souvenirs of Rome and Sparta, and \"penetrated with profound contempt\r\nfor monarchical governments.\" Subsequently, at the law school, they\r\nlearn something about legal abstractions, or else learn nothing. In the\r\nlecture-courses at Paris there are no students; the professor delivers\r\nhis lecture to copyists who sell their copy-books. If a pupil should\r\nattend himself and take notes he would be regarded with suspicion; he\r\nwould be charged with trying to deprive the copyists of the means of\r\nearning their living. A diploma, consequently, is worthless. At\r\nBourges one is obtainable in six months; if the young man succeeds in\r\ncomprehending the law it is through later practice and familiarity with\r\nit.--Of foreign laws and institutions there is not the least knowledge,\r\nscarcely even a vague or false notion of them. Malouet himself\r\nentertains a meager idea of the English Parliament, while many,\r\nwith respect to ceremonial, imagine it a copy of the Parliament of\r\nFrance.--The mechanism of free constitutions, or the conditions of\r\neffective liberty, that is too complicated a question. Montesquieu, save\r\nin the great magisterial families, is antiquated for twenty years past.\r\nOf what avail are studies of ancient France? \"What is the result of so\r\nmuch and such profound research? Laborious conjecture and reasons for\r\ndoubting.\"[4353] It is much more convenient to start with the rights of\r\nman and to deduce the consequences. Schoolboy logic suffices for that to\r\nwhich collegiate rhetoric supplies the tirades.--In this great void of\r\nenlightenment the vague terms of liberty, equality and the sovereignty\r\nof the people, the glowing expressions of Rousseau and his successors,\r\nall these new axioms, blaze up like burning coals, discharging clouds\r\nof smoke and intoxicating vapor. High-sounding and vague language is\r\ninterposed between the mind and objects around it; all outlines are\r\nconfused and the vertigo begins. Never to the same extent have men lost\r\nthe purport of outward things. Never have they been at once more blind\r\nand more chimerical. Never has their disturbed reason rendered them\r\nmore tranquil concerning real danger and created more alarm at imaginary\r\ndanger. Strangers with cool blood and who witness the spectacle, Mallet\r\ndu Pan, Dumont of Geneva, Arthur Young, Jefferson, Gouverneur Morris,\r\nwrite that the French are insane. Morris, in this universal delirium,\r\ncan mention to Washington but one sane mind, that of Marmontel, and\r\nMarmontel speaks in the same style as Morris. At the preliminary\r\nmeetings of the clubs, and at the assemblies of electors, he is the only\r\none who opposes unreasonable propositions. Surrounding him are none but\r\nthe excited, the exalted about nothing, even to grotesqueness[4354]. In\r\nevery act of the established régime, in every administrative measure,\r\n\"in all police regulations, in all financial decrees, in all the\r\ngraduated authorities on which public order and tranquility depend,\r\nthere was naught in which they did not find an aspect of tyranny. . .\r\nOn the walls and barriers of Paris being referred to, these were\r\ndenounced as enclosures for deer and derogatory to man.\"--\r\n\r\n\"I saw,\" says one of these orators, \"at the barrier Saint-Victor,\r\nsculptured on one of the pillars--would you believe it?----an enormous\r\nlion's head, with open jaws vomiting forth chains as a menace to those\r\nwho passed it. Could a more horrible emblem of slavery and of despotism\r\nbe imagined!\"--\"The orator himself imitates the roar of the lion.\r\nThe listeners were all excited by it and I, who passed the barrier\r\nSaint-Victor so often, was surprised that this horrible image had not\r\nstruck me. That very day I examined it closely and, on the pilaster, I\r\nfound only a small buckler suspended as an ornament by a little chain\r\nattached by the sculptor to a little lion's mouth, like those we see\r\nserving as door-knockers or as water-cocks.\"--Perverted sensations and\r\ndelirious conceptions of this kind would be regarded by physicians as\r\nthe symptoms of mental derangement, and we are only in the early\r\nmonths of the year 1789!--In such excitable and over-excited brains the\r\npowerful fascination of words is about to create phantoms, some of them\r\nhideous, the aristocrat and the tyrant, and others adorable, the friend\r\nof the people and the incorruptible patriot, so many disproportionate,\r\nimaginary figures, but which will replace actual living persons, and\r\nwhich the maniac is to overwhelm with his praise or pursue with his\r\nfury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Summary\r\n\r\nThus does the philosophy of the eighteenth century descend among the\r\npeople and propagate itself. Ideas, on the first story of the house, in\r\nhandsome gilded rooms, serve only as an evening illumination, as drawing\r\nroom explosives and pleasing Bengal lights, with which people amuse\r\nthemselves, and then laughingly throw from the windows into the\r\nstreet. Collected together in the story below and on the ground floor,\r\ntransported to shops, to warehouses and into business cabinets, they\r\nfind combustible material, piles of wood a long time accumulated, and\r\nhere do the flames enkindle. The conflagration seems to have already\r\nbegun, for the chimneys roar and a ruddy light gleams through the\r\nwindows; but \"No,\" say the people above, \"those below would take care\r\nnot to set the house on fire, for they live in it as we do. It is only a\r\nstraw bonfire and a burning chimney, and a little water will extinguish\r\nit; and, besides, these little accidents clear the chimney and burn out\r\nthe soot.\"\r\n\r\nTake care! Under the vast deep arches supporting it, in the cellars of\r\nthe house, there is a magazine of powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4301: I have verified these sentiments myself, in the\r\nnarration of aged people deceased twenty years ago.

Privations.\r\n\r\n     Under Louis XIV.--Under Louis XV.--Under Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nLa Bruyère wrote, just a century before 1789,[5101]:\r\n\r\n\"Certain savage-looking animals, male and female, are seen in the\r\ncountry, black, livid and sunburned, and attached to the soil which they\r\ndig and grub with invincible stubbornness. They seem capable of speech,\r\nand, when they stand erect, they display a human face. They are, in\r\nfact, men. They retire at night into their dens where they live on black\r\nbread, water and roots. They spare other human beings the trouble of\r\nsowing, plowing and harvesting, and thus should not be in want of the\r\nbread they have planted.\"\r\n\r\nThey are, however, in want during the twenty-five years after this,\r\nand die in droves. I estimate that in 1715 more than one-third of the\r\npopulation,[5102] six millions, perish with hunger and of destitution.\r\nThis description is, in respect of the first quarter of the century\r\npreceding the Revolution, far from being too vivid, it is rather too\r\nweak; we shall see that it, during more than half a century, up to the\r\ndeath of Louis XV. is exact; so that instead of weakening any of its\r\ndetails, they should be strengthened.\r\n\r\n\"In 1725,\" says Saint-Simon, \"with the profusion of Strasbourg and\r\nChantilly, the people, in Normandy, live on the grass of the fields. The\r\nfirst king in Europe could not be a great king if it was not for all the\r\nbeggars and the poor-houses full of dying from whom all had been taken\r\neven though it was peace-time.[5103]\r\n\r\nIn the most prosperous days of Fleury and in the finest region in\r\nFrance, the peasant hides \"his wine on account of the excise and his\r\nbread on account of the taille,\" convinced \"that he is a lost man if\r\nany doubt exists of his dying of starvation.\"[5104] In 1739 d'Argenson\r\nwrites in his journal[5105]:\r\n\r\n\"The famine has just caused three insurrections in the provinces, at\r\nRuffec, at Caen, and at Chinon. Women carrying their bread with them\r\nhave been assassinated on the highways. . . M. le Duc d'Orléans brought\r\nto the Council the other day a piece of bread, and placed it on the\r\ntable before the king 'Sire,' said he, 'there is the bread on which your\r\nsubjects now feed themselves.'\" \"In my own canton of Touraine men have\r\nbeen eating herbage more than a year.\" Misery finds company on all\r\nsides. \"It is talked about at Versailles more than ever. The king\r\ninterrogated the bishop of Chartres on the condition of his people; he\r\nreplied that 'the famine and the morality were such that men ate grass\r\nlike sheep and died like so many flies.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1740,[5106] Massillon, bishop of Clermont-Ferrand, writes to Fleury:\r\n\r\n\"The people of the rural districts are living in frightful destitution,\r\nwithout beds, without furniture; the majority, for half the year, even\r\nlack barley and oat bread which is their sole food, and which they are\r\ncompelled to take out of their own and their children's mouths to\r\npay the taxes. It pains me to see this sad spectacle every year on my\r\nvisits. The Negroes of our colonies are, in this respect, infinitely\r\nbetter off; for, while working, they are fed and clothed along with\r\ntheir wives and children, while our peasantry, the most laborious in the\r\nkingdom, cannot, with the hardest and most devoted labor, earn bread for\r\nthemselves and their families, and at the same time pay their charges.\"\r\nIn 1740[5107] at Lille, the people rebel against the export of grain.\r\n\"An intendant informs me that the misery increases from hour to hour,\r\nthe slightest danger to the crops resulting in this for three years\r\npast. . . .Flanders, especially, is greatly embarrassed; there is\r\nnothing to live on until the harvesting, which will not take place for\r\ntwo months. The provinces the best off are not able to help the others.\r\nEach bourgeois in each town is obliged to feed one or two poor persons\r\nand provide them with fourteen pounds of bread per week. In the little\r\ntown of Chatellerault, (of 4,000 inhabitants), 1800 poor, this winter,\r\nare in that situation. . . . The poor outnumber those able to live\r\nwithout begging. . . while prosecutions for unpaid dues are carried on\r\nwith unexampled rigor. The clothes of the poor, their last measure of\r\nflour and the latches on their doors are seized, etc. .. . The abbess of\r\nJouarre told me yesterday that, in her canton, in Brie, most of the land\r\nhad not been planted.\" It is not surprising that the famine spreads even\r\nto Paris. \"Fears are entertained of next Wednesday. There is no more\r\nbread in Paris, except that of the damaged flour which is brought in\r\nand which burns (when baking). The mills are working day and night at\r\nBelleville, regrinding old damaged flour. The people are ready to rebel;\r\nbread goes up a sol a day; no merchant dares, or is disposed, to bring\r\nin his wheat. The market on Wednesday was almost in a state of revolt,\r\nthere being no bread in it after seven o'clock in the morning. . . .\r\nThe poor creatures at Bicêtre prison were put on short rations, three\r\nquarterons (twelve ounces), being reduced to only half a pound. A\r\nrebellion broke out and they forced the guards. Numbers escaped and they\r\nhave inundated Paris. The watch, with the police of the neighborhood,\r\nwere called out, and an attack was made on these poor wretches with\r\nbayonet and sword. About fifty of them were left on the ground; the\r\nrevolt was not suppressed yesterday morning.\"\r\n\r\nTen years later the evil is greater.[5108]\r\n\r\n\"In the country around me, ten leagues from Paris, I find increased\r\nprivation and constant complaints. What must it be in our wretched\r\nprovinces in the interior of the kingdom?. . . My curate tells me that\r\neight families, supporting themselves on their labor when I left, are\r\nnow begging their bread. There is no work to be had. The wealthy are\r\neconomizing like the poor. And with all this the taille is exacted with\r\nmilitary severity. The collectors, with their officers, accompanied by\r\nlocksmiths, force open the doors and carry off and sell furniture for\r\none-quarter of its value, the expenses exceeding the amount of the\r\ntax. . . \"--\"I am at this moment on my estates in Touraine. I encounter\r\nnothing but frightful privations; the melancholy sentiment of suffering\r\nno longer prevails with the poor inhabitants, but rather one of utter\r\ndespair; they desire death only, and avoid increase. . . . It is\r\nestimated that one-quarter of the working-days of the year go to the\r\ncorvées, the laborers feeding themselves, and with what?. . . I see poor\r\npeople dying of destitution. They are paid fifteen sous a day, equal to\r\na crown, for their load. Whole villages are either ruined or broken up,\r\nand none of the households recover. . . . Judging by what my neighbors\r\ntell me the inhabitants have diminished one-third. . . . The daily\r\nlaborers are all leaving and taking refuge in the small towns. In many\r\nvillages everybody leaves. I have several parishes in which the taille\r\nfor three years is due, the proceedings for its collection always going\r\non. . . . The receivers of the taille and of the taxes add one-half\r\neach year in expenses above the tax. . . . An assessor, on coming to the\r\nvillage where I have my country-house, states that the taille this year\r\nwill be much increased; he noticed that the peasants here were fatter\r\nthan elsewhere; that they had chicken feathers before their doors, and\r\nthat the living here must be good, everybody doing well, etc.--This is\r\nthe cause of the peasant's discouragement, and likewise the cause of\r\nmisfortune throughout the kingdom.\"--\"In the country where I am staying\r\nI hear that marriage is declining and that the population is decreasing\r\non all sides. In my parish, with a few fire-sides, there are more than\r\nthirty single persons, male and female, old enough to marry and none of\r\nthem considering it. On being urged to marry they all reply alike that\r\nit is not worth while to bring unfortunate beings like themselves into\r\nthe world. I have myself tried to induce some of the women to marry by\r\noffering them assistance, but they all reason in this way as if they\r\nhad consulted together.\"[5109]--\"One of my curates sends me word that,\r\nalthough he is the oldest in the province of Touraine, and has seen many\r\nthings, including excessively high prices for wheat, he remembers no\r\nmisery so great as that of this year, even in 1709. . . . Some of the\r\nseigniors of Touraine inform me that, being desirous of setting the\r\ninhabitants to work by the day, they found very few of them, and these\r\nso weak that they were unable to use their hands.\"\r\n\r\nThose who are able to leave, go.\r\n\r\n\"A person from Languedoc tells me of vast numbers of peasants deserting\r\nthat province and taking refuge in Piedmont, Savoy, and Spain, tormented\r\nand frightened by the measures resorted to in collecting tithes. . . .\r\nThe extortioners sell everything and imprison everybody as if prisoners\r\nof war, and even with more avidity and malice, in order to gain\r\nsomething themselves.\"--\"I met an intendant of one of the finest\r\nprovinces in the kingdom, who told me that no more farmers could be\r\nfound there; that parents preferred to send their children to the towns;\r\nthat living in the surrounding country was daily becoming more horrible\r\nto the inhabitants. . . . A man, well-informed in financial matters,\r\ntold me that over two hundred families in Normandy had left this year,\r\nfearing the collections in their villages.\"--At Paris, \"the streets\r\nswarm with beggars. One cannot stop before a door without a dozen\r\nmendicants besetting him with their importunities. They are said to be\r\npeople from the country who, unable to endure the persecutions they\r\nhave to undergo, take refuge in the cities. . . preferring begging to\r\nlabor.\"--And yet the people of the cities are not much better off. \"An\r\nofficer of a company in garrison at Mezieres tells me that the poverty\r\nof that place is so great that, after the officers had dined in the\r\ninns, the people rush in and pillage the remnants.\"--\"There are more\r\nthan 12,000 begging workmen in Rouen, quite as many in Tours, etc. More\r\nthan 20,000 of these workmen are estimated as having left the kingdom\r\nin three months for Spain, Germany, etc. At Lyons 20,000 workers in\r\nsilk are watched and kept in sight for fear of their going abroad.\"\r\nAt Rouen,[5110] and in Normandy, \"those in easy circumstances find it\r\ndifficult to get bread, the bulk of the people being entirely without\r\nit, and, to ward off starvation, providing themselves with food\r\notherwise repulsive to human beings.\"--\"Even at Paris,\" writes\r\nd'Argenson,[5111] \"I learn that on the day M. le Dauphin and Mme. la\r\nDauphine went to Notre Dame, on passing the bridge of the Tournelle,\r\nmore than 2,000 women assembled in that quarter crying out, 'Give\r\nus bread, or we shall die of hunger.'. . . A vicar of the parish of\r\nSaint-Marguerite affirms that over eight hundred persons died in the\r\nFaubourg St. Antoine between January 20th and February 20th; that the\r\npoor expire with cold and hunger in their garrets, and that the priests,\r\narriving too late, see them expire without any possible relief.\"\r\n\r\nWere I to enumerate the riots, the sedition of the famished, and the\r\npillaging of storehouses, I should never end; these are the convulsive\r\ntwitching of exhaustion; the people have fasted as long as possible, and\r\ninstinct, at last, rebels. In 1747,[5112] \"extensive bread-riots occur\r\nin Toulouse, and in Guyenne they take place on every market-day.\" In\r\n1750, from 6 to 7,000 men gather in Bearn behind a river to resist the\r\nclerks; two companies of the Artois regiment fire on the rebels and kill\r\na dozen of them. In 1752, a sedition at Rouen and in its neighborhood\r\nlasts three days; in Dauphiny and in Auvergne riotous villagers force\r\nopen the grain warehouses and take away wheat at their own price; the\r\nsame year, at Arles, 2,000 armed peasants demand bread at the town-hall\r\nand are dispersed by the soldiers. In one province alone, that of\r\nNormandy, I find insurrections in 1725, in 1737, in 1739, in 1752, in\r\n1764, 1765, 1766, 1767 and 1768,[5113] and always on account of bread.\r\n\r\n\"Entire hamlets,\" writes the Parliament, \"being without the necessities\r\nof life, hunger compels them to resort to the food of brutes. . . . Two\r\ndays more and Rouen will be without provisions, without grain, without\r\nbread.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the last riot is terrible; on this occasion, the populace,\r\nagain masters of the town for three days, pillage the public granaries\r\nand the stores of all the communities.--Up to the last and even later,\r\nin 1770 at Rheims, in 1775 at Dijon, at Versailles, at St. Germain, at\r\nPontoise and at Paris, in 1772 at Poitiers, in 1785 at Aix in Provence,\r\nin 1788 and 1789 in Paris and throughout France, similar eruptions are\r\nvisible.[5114]--Undoubtedly the government under Louis XVI is milder;\r\nthe intendants are more humane, the administration is less rigid, the\r\ntaille becomes less unequal, and the corvée is less onerous through its\r\ntransformation, in short, misery has diminished, and yet this is greater\r\nthan human nature can bear.\r\n\r\nExamine administrative correspondence for the last thirty years\r\npreceding the Revolution. Countless statements reveal excessive\r\nsuffering, even when not terminating in fury. Life to a man of the lower\r\nclass, to an artisan, or workman, subsisting on the labor of his own\r\nhands, is evidently precarious; he obtains simply enough to keep him\r\nfrom starvation and he does not always get that[5115]. Here, in four\r\ndistricts, \"the inhabitants live only on buckwheat,\" and for five years,\r\nthe apple crop having failed, they drink only water. There, in a country\r\nof vine-yards,[5116] \"the wine-growers each year are reduced, for the\r\nmost part, to begging their bread during the dull season.\" Elsewhere,\r\nseveral of the day-laborers and mechanics, obliged to sell their effects\r\nand household goods, die of the cold; insufficient and unhealthy food\r\ngenerates sickness, while, in two districts, 35,000 persons are stated\r\nto be living on alms[5117]. In a remote canton the peasants cut the\r\ngrain still green and dry it in the oven, because they are too hungry to\r\nwait. The intendant of Poitiers writes that \"as soon as the workhouses\r\nopen, a prodigious number of the poor rush to them, in spite of the\r\nreduction of wages and of the restrictions imposed on them in behalf\r\nof the most needy.\" The intendant of Bourges notices that a great many\r\ntenant farmers have sold off their furniture, and that \"entire families\r\npass two days without eating,\" and that in many parishes the famished\r\nstay in bed most of the day because they suffer less. The intendant\r\nof Orleans reports that \"in Sologne, poor widows have burned up their\r\nwooden bedsteads and others have consumed their fruit trees,\" to\r\npreserve themselves from the cold, and he adds, \"nothing is exaggerated\r\nin this statement; the cries of want cannot be expressed; the misery of\r\nthe rural districts must be seen with one's own eyes to obtain an idea\r\nof it.\" From Rioni, from La Rochelle, from Limoges, from Lyons, from\r\nMontauban, from Caen, from Alençon, from Flanders, from Moulins\r\ncome similar statements by other intendants. One might call it the\r\ninterruptions and repetitions of a funeral knell; even in years\r\nnot disastrous it is heard on all sides. In Burgundy, near\r\nChatillon-sur-Seine,\r\n\r\n\"taxes, seigniorial dues, the tithes, and the expenses of cultivation,\r\nsplit up the productions of the soil into thirds, leaving nothing for\r\nthe unfortunate cultivators, who would have abandoned their fields, had\r\nnot two Swiss manufacturers of calicoes settled there and distributed\r\nabout the country 40,000 francs a year in cash.\"[5118]\r\n\r\nIn Auvergne, the country is depopulated daily; many of the villages have\r\nlost, since the beginning of the century, more than one-third of their\r\ninhabitants[5119].\r\n\r\n\"Had not steps been promptly taken to lighten the burden of a\r\ndown-trodden people,\" says the provincial assembly in 1787, \"Auvergne\r\nwould have forever lost its population and its cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nIn Comminges, at the outbreak of the Revolution, certain communities\r\nthreaten to abandon their possessions, should they obtain no\r\nrelief[5120].\r\n\r\n\"It is a well-known fact,\" says the assembly of Haute-Guyenne, in 1784,\"\r\nthat the lot of the most severely taxed communities is so rigorous as to\r\nhave led their proprietors frequently to abandon their property[5121].\r\nWho is not aware of the inhabitants of Saint-Servin having abandoned\r\ntheir property ten times, and of their threats to resort again to this\r\npainful proceeding in their recourse to the administration? Only a few\r\nyears ago an abandonment of the community of Boisse took place through\r\nthe combined action of the inhabitants, the seignior and the décimateur\r\nof that community;\" and the desertion would be still greater if the\r\nlaw did not forbid persons liable to the taille abandoning over-taxed\r\nproperty, except by renouncing whatever they possessed in the\r\ncommunity. In the Soissonais, according to the report of the provincial\r\nassembly,[5122] \"misery is excessive.\" In Gascony the spectacle is\r\n\"heartrending.\" In the environs of Toul, the cultivator, after paying\r\nhis taxes, tithes and other dues, remains empty-handed.\r\n\r\n\"Agriculture is an occupation of steady anxiety and privation, in which\r\nthousands of men are obliged to painfully vegetate.\"[5123] In a village\r\nin Normandy, \"nearly all the inhabitants, not excepting the farmers\r\nand proprietors, eat barley bread and drink water, living like the most\r\nwretched of men, so as to provide for the payment of the taxes with\r\nwhich they are overburdened.\" In the same province, at Forges, \"many\r\npoor creatures eat oat bread, and others bread of soaked bran, this\r\nnourishment causing many deaths among infants.\"[5124] People evidently\r\nlive from day to day; whenever the crop proves poor they lack bread.\r\nLet a frost come, a hailstorm, an inundation, and an entire province\r\nis incapable of supporting itself until the coming year; in many places\r\neven an ordinary winter suffices to bring on distress. On all sides\r\nhands are seen outstretched to the king, who is the universal almoner.\r\nThe people may be said to resemble a man attempting to wade through a\r\npool with the water up to his chin, and who, losing his footing at the\r\nslightest depression, sinks down and drowns. Existent charity and the\r\nfresh spirit of humanity vainly strive to rescue them; the water has\r\nrisen too high. It must subside to a lower level, and the pool be drawn\r\noff through some adequate outlet. Thus far the poor man catches breath\r\nonly at intervals, running the risk of drowning at every moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Peasants.\r\n\r\n     The condition of the peasant during the last thirty years of\r\n     the Ancient Regime.--His precarious subsistence.--State of\r\n     agriculture.--Uncultivated farms.--Poor cultivation.--\r\n     Inadequate wages.--Lack of comforts.\r\n\r\nBetween 1750 and 1760,[5125] the idlers who eat suppers begin to regard\r\nwith compassion and alarm the laborers who go without dinners. Why are\r\nthe latter so impoverished; and by what misfortune, on a soil as rich\r\nas that of France, do those lack bread who grow the grain? In the first\r\nplace many farms remain uncultivated, and, what is worse, many are\r\ndeserted. According to the best observers \"one-quarter of the soil is\r\nabsolutely lying waste. . . . Hundreds and hundreds of arpents of heath\r\nand moor form extensive deserts.\"[5126] Let a person traverse Anjou,\r\nMaine, Brittany, Poitou, Limousin, la Marche, Berry, Nivernais,\r\nBourbonnais and Auvergne, and he finds one-half of these provinces in\r\nheaths, forming immense plains, all of which might be cultivated.\" In\r\nTouraine, in Poitou and in Berry they form solitary expanses of 30,000\r\narpents. In one canton alone, near Preuilly, 40,000 arpents of good\r\nsoil consist of heath. The agricultural society of Rennes declares\r\nthat two-thirds of Brittany is lying waste. This is not sterility but\r\ndecadence. The régime invented by Louis XIV has produced its effect; the\r\nsoil for a century past has been reverting to a wild state.\r\n\r\n\"We see only abandoned and ruinous chateaux; the principal towns of the\r\nfiefs, in which the nobility formerly lived at their ease, are all now\r\noccupied by poor tenant herdsmen whose scanty labor hardly suffices for\r\ntheir subsistence, and a remnant of tax ready to disappear through the\r\nruin of the proprietors and the desertion of the settlers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the election district of Confolens a piece of property rented for\r\n2,956 livres in 1665, brings in only 900 livres in 1747. On the confines\r\nof la Marche and of Berry a domain which, in 1660, honorably supported\r\ntwo seigniorial families is now simply a small unproductive tenant-farm;\r\n\"the traces of the furrows once made by the plow-iron being still\r\nvisible on the surrounding heaths.\" Sologne, once flourishing,[5127]\r\nbecomes a marsh and a forest; a hundred years earlier it produced three\r\ntimes the quantity of grain; two-thirds of its mills are gone; not a\r\nvestige of its vineyards remains; \"grapes have given way to the heath.\"\r\nThus abandoned by the spade and the plow, a vast portion of the soil\r\nceases to feed man, while the rest, poorly cultivated, scarcely provides\r\nthe simplest necessities[5128].\r\n\r\nIn the first place, on the failure of a crop, this portion remains\r\nuntilled; its occupant is too poor to purchase seed; the intendant is\r\noften obliged to distribute seed, without which the disaster of the\r\ncurrent year would be followed by sterility the following year[5129].\r\nEvery calamity, accordingly, in these days affects the future as well as\r\nthe present; during the two years of 1784 and 1785, around Toulouse,\r\nthe drought having caused the loss of all draft animals, many of the\r\ncultivators are obliged to let their fields lie fallow. In the second\r\nplace, cultivation, when it does take place, is carried on according to\r\nmedieval modes. Arthur Young, in 1789, considers that French agriculture\r\nhas not progressed beyond that of the tenth century[5130]. Except in\r\nFlanders and on the plains of Alsace, the fields lie fallow one year out\r\nof three, and oftentimes one year out of two. The implements are poor;\r\nthere are no plows made of iron; in many places the plow of Virgil's\r\ntime is still in use. Cart-axles and wheel-tires are made of wood, while\r\na harrow often consists of the trestle of a cart. There are few animals\r\nand but little manure; the capital bestowed on cultivation is three\r\ntimes less than that of the present day. The yield is slight: \"our\r\nordinary farms,\" says a good observer, \"taking one with another return\r\nabout six times the seed sown.\"[5131] In 1778, on the rich soil around\r\nToulouse, wheat returns about five for one, while at the present day it\r\nyields eight to one and more. Arthur Young estimates that, in his day,\r\nthe English acre produces twenty-eight bushels of grain, and the French\r\nacre eighteen bushels, and that the value of the total product of the\r\nsame area for a given length of time is thirty-six pounds sterling\r\nin England and only twenty-five in France. As the parish roads are\r\nfrightful, and transportation often impracticable, it is clear that,\r\nin remote cantons, where poor soil yields scarcely three times the seed\r\nsown, food is not always obtainable. How do they manage to live until\r\nthe next crop? This is the question always under consideration previous\r\nto, and during, the Revolution. I find, in manuscript correspondence,\r\nthe syndics and mayors of villages estimating the quantities for local\r\nsubsistence at so many bushels in the granaries, so many sheaves in the\r\nbarns, so many mouths to be filled, so many days to wait until\r\nthe August wheat comes in, and concluding on short supplies for two,\r\nthree and four months. Such a state of inter-communication and of\r\nagriculture condemns a country to periodical famines, and I venture to\r\nstate that, alongside of the small-pox which out of eight deaths causes\r\none, another endemic disease exists, as prevalent and as destructive,\r\nand this disease is starvation.\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine that it is the common people, and especially the\r\npeasants who suffers. An increase of the price of bread prevents him\r\nfrom getting any, and even without that increase, he obtains it with\r\ndifficulty. Wheat bread cost, as today, three sous per pound,[5132] but\r\nas the average day's work brought only nineteen sous instead of forty,\r\nthe day-laborer, working the same time, could buy only the half of a\r\nloaf instead of a full loaf[5133]. Taking everything into account, and\r\nwages being estimated according to the price of grain, we find that the\r\nhusbandman's manual labor then procured him 959 litres of wheat, while\r\nnowadays it gives him 1,851 litres; his well-being, accordingly, has\r\nadvanced ninety-three per cent., which suffices to show to what extent\r\nhis predecessors suffered privations. And these privations are peculiar\r\nto France. Through analogous observations and estimates Arthur\r\nYoung shows that in France those who lived on field labor, and\r\nthey constituted the great majority, are seventy-six per cent.\r\nless comfortable than the same laborers in England, while they are\r\nseventy-six per cent. less well fed and well clothed, besides being\r\nworse treated in sickness and in health. The result is that in\r\nseven-eighths of the kingdom, there are no farmers, but simply métayers\r\n(a kind of poor tenants)[5134]. The peasant is too poor to\r\nundertake cultivation on his own account, possessing no agricultural\r\ncapital[5135]. \"The proprietor, desirous of improving his land, finds\r\nno one to cultivate it but miserable creatures possessing only a pair\r\nof hands; he is obliged to advance everything for its cultivation at\r\nhis own expense, animals, implements and seed, and even to advance\r\nthe wherewithal to this tenant to feed him until the first crop comes\r\nin.\"--\"At Vatan, for example, in Berry, the tenants, almost every year,\r\nborrow bread of the proprietor in order to await the harvesting.\"--\"Very\r\nrarely is one found who is not indebted to his master at least one\r\nhundred livres a year.\"\r\n\r\nFrequently the latter proposes to abandon the entire crop to them\r\non condition that they demand nothing of him during the year; \"these\r\nmiserable creatures\" have refused; left to themselves, they would not\r\nbe sure of keeping themselves alive.--In Limousin and in Angoumois their\r\npoverty is so great[5136] \"that, deducting the taxes to which they are\r\nsubject, they have no more than from twenty-five to thirty livres each\r\nperson per annum to spend; and not in money, it must be stated, but\r\ncounting whatever they consume in kind out of the crops they produce.\r\nFrequently they have less, and when they cannot possibly make a living\r\nthe master is obliged to support them. . . . The métayer is always\r\nreduced to just what is absolutely necessary to keep him from starving.\"\r\nAs to the small proprietor, the villager who plows his land himself,\r\nhis condition is but little better. \"Agriculture,[5137] as our\r\npeasants practice it, is a veritable drudgery; they die by thousands in\r\nchildhood, and in maturity they seek places everywhere but where they\r\nshould be.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1783, throughout the plain of the Toulousain they eat only maize,\r\na mixture of flour, common seeds and very little wheat; those on the\r\nmountains feed, a part of the year, on chestnuts; the potato is hardly\r\nknown, and, according to Arthur Young, ninety-nine out of a hundred\r\npeasants would refuse to eat it. According to the reports of intendants,\r\nthe basis of food, in Normandy, is oats; in the election-district\r\nof Troyes, buck-wheat; in the Marche and in Limousin, buckwheat with\r\nchestnuts and radishes; in Auvergne, buckwheat, chestnuts, milk-curds\r\nand a little salted goat's meat; in Beauce, a mixture of barley and rye;\r\nin Berry, a mixture of barley and oats. There is no wheat bread; the\r\npeasant consumes inferior flour only because he is unable to pay two\r\nsous a pound for his bread. There is no butcher's meat; at best he\r\nkills one pig a year. His dwelling is built of clay (pise), roofed with\r\nthatch, without windows, and the floor is the beaten ground. Even when\r\nthe soil furnishes good building materials, stone, slate and tile, the\r\nwindows have no sashes. In a parish in Normandy,[5138] in 1789, \"most\r\nof the dwellings consist of four posts.\" They are often mere stables\r\nor barns \"to which a chimney has been added made of four poles and some\r\nmud.\" Their clothes are rags, and often in winter these are muslin rags.\r\nIn Quercy and elsewhere, they have no stockings, or wooden shoes. \"It\r\nis not in the power of an English imagination,\" says Arthur Young,\r\n\"to imagine the animals that waited on us here at the Chapeau\r\nRouge,--creatures that were called by courtesy Souillac women, but in\r\nreality walking dung-hills. But a neatly dressed, clean waiting-girl at\r\nan inn, will be looked for in vain in France.\" On reading descriptions\r\nmade on the spot we see in France a similar aspect of country and of\r\npeasantry as in Ireland, at least in its broad outlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Countryside.\r\n\r\nAspects of the country and of the peasantry.\r\n\r\nIn the most fertile regions, for instance, in Limagne, both cottages and\r\nfaces denote \"misery and privation.\"[5139] \"The peasants are generally\r\nfeeble, emaciated and of slight stature.\" Nearly all derive wheat and\r\nwine from their homesteads, but they are forced to sell this to pay\r\ntheir rents and taxes; they eat black bread, made of rye and barley,\r\nand their sole beverage is water poured on the lees and the husks. \"An\r\nEnglishman[5140] who has not traveled can not imagine the figure made\r\nby infinitely the greater part of the countrywomen in France.\" Arthur\r\nYoung, who stops to talk with one of these in Champagne, says that \"this\r\nwoman, at no great distance, might have been taken for sixty or\r\nseventy, her figure was so bent and her face so hardened and furrowed by\r\nlabor,--but she said she was only twenty-eight.\" This woman, her\r\nhusband and her household, afford a sufficiently accurate example of the\r\ncondition of the small proprietary husbandmen. Their property consists\r\nsimply of a patch of ground, with a cow and a poor little horse; their\r\nseven children consume the whole of the cow's milk. They owe to one\r\nseignior a franchard (forty-two pounds) of flour, and three chickens; to\r\nanother three franchards of oats, one chicken and one sou, to which must\r\nbe added the taille and other taxes. \"God keep us!\" she said, \"for the\r\ntailles and the dues crush us.\"--What must it be in districts where the\r\nsoil is poor!--\r\n\r\n\"From Ormes, (near Chatellerault), as far as Poitiers,\" writes a\r\nlady,[5141] \"there is a good deal of ground which brings in nothing,\r\nand from Poitiers to my residence (in Limousin) 25,000 arpents of ground\r\nconsist wholly of heath and sea-grass. The peasantry live on rye, of\r\nwhich they do not remove the bran, and which is as black and heavy as\r\nlead.--In Poitou, and here, they plow up only the skin of the ground\r\nwith a miserable little plow without wheels. . . . From Poitiers to\r\nMontmorillon it is nine leagues, equal to sixteen of Paris, and I assure\r\nyou that I have seen but four men on the road, and, between Montmorillon\r\nand my own house, which is four leagues, but three; and then only at a\r\ndistance, not having met one on the road. You need not be surprised at\r\nthis in such a country. . . Marriage takes place as early as with the\r\ngrand seigniors,\" doubtless for fear of the militia. \"But the population\r\nof the country is no greater because almost every infant dies. Mothers\r\nhaving scarcely any milk, their infants eat the bread of which I spoke,\r\nthe stomach of a girl of four years being as big as that of a pregnant\r\nwoman. . . . The rye crop this year was ruined by the frost on Easter\r\nday; flour is scarce; of the twelve métairies owned by my mother, four\r\nof them may, perhaps, have some on hand. There has been no rain since\r\nEaster; no hay, no pasture, no vegetables, no fruit. You see the lot of\r\nthe poor peasant. There is no manure, and there are no cattle. . . . My\r\nmother, whose granaries used to be always full, has not a grain of wheat\r\nin them, because, for two years past, she has fed all her métayers and\r\nthe poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"The peasant is assisted,\" says a seignior of the same province,[5142]\r\n\"protected, and rarely maltreated, but he is looked upon with disdain.\r\nIf kindly and pliable he is made subservient, but if ill-disposed he\r\nbecomes soured and irritable. . . . He is kept in misery, in an\r\nabject state, by men who are not at all inhuman but whose prejudices,\r\nespecially among the nobles, lead them to regard him as of a different\r\nspecies of being. . . . The proprietor gets all he can out of him; in\r\nany event, looking upon him and his oxen as domestic animals, he puts\r\nthem into harness and employs them in all weathers for every kind of\r\njourney, and for every species of carting and transport. On the other\r\nhand, this métayer thinks of living with as little labor as possible,\r\nconverting as much ground as he can into pasturage, for the reason that\r\nthe product arising from the increase of stock costs him no labor.\r\nThe little plowing he does is for the purpose of raising low-priced\r\nprovisions suitable for his own nourishment, such as buckwheat,\r\nradishes, etc. His enjoyment consists only of his own idleness and\r\nsluggishness, hoping for a good chestnut year and doing nothing\r\nvoluntarily but procreate;\" unable to hire farming hands he begets\r\nchildren.--\r\n\r\nThe rest, ordinary laborers, have a few savings, \"living on the herbage,\r\nand on a few goats which devour everything.\" Often again, these, by\r\norder of Parliament, are killed by the game-keepers. A woman, with two\r\nchildren in swaddling clothes, having no milk, \"and without an inch of\r\nground,\" whose two goats, her sole resource, had thus been slain, and\r\nanother, with one goat slain in the same way, and who begs along with\r\nher boy, present themselves at the gate of the chateau; one receives\r\ntwelve livres, while the other is admitted as a domestic, and\r\nhenceforth, '' this village is all bows and smiling faces.''--In short,\r\nthey are not accustomed to kindness; the lot of all these poor people\r\nis to endure. \"As with rain and hail, they regard as inevitable the\r\nnecessity of being oppressed by the strongest, the richest, the most\r\nskillful, the most in repute,\" and this stamps on them, \"if one may be\r\nallowed to say so, an air of painful suffering.\"\r\n\r\nIn Auvergne, a feudal country, covered with extensive ecclesiastic and\r\nseigniorial domains, the misery is the same. At Clermont-Ferrand,[5143]\r\n\"there are many streets that can for blackness, dirt and scents only be\r\nrepresented by narrow channels cut in a dunghill.\" In the inns of the\r\nlargest bourgs, \"closeness, misery, dirtiness and darkness.\" That of\r\nPradelles is \"one of the worst in France.\" That of Aubenas, says Young,\r\n\"would be a purgatory for one of my pigs.\" The senses, in short, are\r\nparalyzed. The primitive man is content so long as he can sleep and get\r\nsomething to eat. He gets something to eat, but what kind of food?\r\nTo put up with the indigestible mess a peasant here requires a still\r\ntougher stomach than in Limousin; in certain villages where, ten years\r\nlater, every year twenty or twenty-five hogs are to be slaughtered, they\r\nnow slaughter but three[5144].--On contemplating this temperament, rude\r\nand intact since Vercingetorix, and, moreover, rendered more savage\r\nby suffering, one cannot avoid being somewhat alarmed. The Marquis de\r\nMirabeau describes\r\n\r\n\"the votive festival of Mont-Dore: savages descending from the mountain\r\nin torrents,[5145] the curate with stole and surplice, the justice\r\nin his wig, the police corps with sabers drawn, all guarding the open\r\nsquare before letting the bagpipers play; the dance interrupted in a\r\nquarter of an hour by a fight; the hooting and cries of children, of\r\nthe feeble and other spectators, urging them on as the rabble urge on so\r\nmany fighting dogs; frightful looking men, or rather wild beasts covered\r\nwith coats of coarse wool, wearing wide leather belts pierced with\r\ncopper nails, gigantic in stature, which is increased by high wooden\r\nshoes, and making themselves still taller by standing on tiptoe to see\r\nthe battle, stamping with their feet as it progresses and rubbing each\r\nother's flanks with their elbows, their faces haggard and covered with\r\nlong matted hair, the upper portion pallid, and the lower distended,\r\nindicative of cruel delight and a sort of ferocious impatience. And\r\nthese folks pay the taille! And now they want to take away their salt!\r\nAnd they know nothing of those they despoil, of those whom they think\r\nthey govern, believing that, by a few strokes of a cowardly and careless\r\npen, they may starve them with impunity up to the final catastrophe!\r\nPoor Jean-Jacques, I said to myself, had any one dispatched you, with\r\nyour system, to copy music amongst these folks, he would have had some\r\nsharp replies to make to your discourses!\"\r\n\r\nProphetic warning and admirable foresight in one whom an excess of evil\r\ndoes not blind to the evil of the remedy! Enlightened by his feudal and\r\nrural instincts, the old man at once judges both the government and the\r\nphilosophers, the Ancient Regime and the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Peasant Becomes Landowner.\r\n\r\n     How the peasant becomes a proprietor.--He is no better off.\r\n    --Increase of taxes.--He is the \"mule\" of the Ancient Regime.\r\n\r\nMisery begets bitterness in a man; but ownership coupled with misery\r\nrenders him still more bitter. He may have submitted to indigence but\r\nnot to spoliation--which is the situation of the peasant in 1789, for,\r\nduring the eighteenth century, he had become the possessor of land. But\r\nhow could he maintain himself in such destitution? The fact is almost\r\nincredible, but it is nevertheless true. We can only explain it by the\r\ncharacter of the French peasant, by his sobriety, his tenacity, his\r\nrigor with himself, his dissimulation, his hereditary passion\r\nfor property and especially for that of the soil. He had lived on\r\nprivations, and economized sou after sou. Every year a few pieces of\r\nsilver are added to his little store of crowns buried in the most secret\r\nrecess of his cellar; Rousseau's peasant, concealing his wine and bread\r\nin a pit, assuredly had a yet more secret hiding-place; a little money\r\nin a woollen stocking or in a jug escapes, more readily than elsewhere,\r\nthe search of the clerks. Dressed in rags, going barefoot, eating\r\nnothing but coarse black bread, but cherishing the little treasure\r\nin his breast on which he builds so many hopes, he watches for the\r\nopportunity which never fails to come. \"In spite of privileges,\" writes\r\na gentleman in 1755,[5146] \"the nobles are daily being ruined and\r\nreduced, the Third-Estate making all the fortunes.\" A number of\r\ndomains, through forced or voluntary sales, thus pass into the hands\r\nof financiers, of men of the quill, of merchants, and of the well-to-do\r\nbourgeois. Before undergoing this total dispossession, however, the\r\nseignior, involved in debt, is evidently resigned to partial alienation\r\nof his property. The peasant who has bribed the steward is at hand with\r\nhis hoard. \"It is poor property, my lord, and it costs you more than you\r\nget from it.\" This may refer to an isolated patch, one end of a field or\r\nmeadow, sometimes a farm whose farmer pays nothing, and generally worked\r\nby a métayer whose wants and indolence make him an annual expense to his\r\nmaster. The latter may say to himself that the alienated parcel is not\r\nlost, since, some day or other, through his right of repurchase, he may\r\ntake it back, while, in the meantime, he enjoys a cens, drawbacks,\r\nand the lord's dues. Moreover, there is on his domain and around him,\r\nextensive open spaces which the decline of cultivation and depopulation\r\nhave left a desert. To restore the value of this he must surrender its\r\nproprietorship. There is no other way by which to attach man permanently\r\nto the soil. And the government helps him along in this matter.\r\nObtaining no revenue from the abandoned soil, it assents to a\r\nprovisional withdrawal of its too weighty hand. By the edict of 1766,\r\na piece of cleared waste land remains free of the taille for fifteen\r\nyears, and, thereupon, in twenty-eight provinces 400,000 arpents are\r\ncleared in three years[5147].\r\n\r\nThis is the mode by which the seigniorial domain gradually crumbles away\r\nand decreases. Towards the last, in many places, with the exception\r\nof the chateau and the small adjoining farm which brings in 2 or\r\n3000 francs a year, nothing is left to the seignior but his feudal\r\ndues;[5148] the rest of the soil belongs to the peasantry. Forbonnais\r\nalready remarks, towards 1750, that many of the nobles and of the\r\nennobled \"reduced to extreme poverty but with titles to immense\r\npossessions,\" have sold off portions to small cultivators at low prices,\r\nand often for the amount of the taille. Towards 1760, one-quarter of the\r\nsoil is said to have already passed into the hands of farmers. In 1772,\r\nin relation to the vingtième, which is levied on the net revenue of real\r\nproperty, the intendant of Caen, having completed the statement of his\r\nquota, estimates that out of 150,000 \"there are perhaps 50,000 whose\r\nliabilities did not exceed five sous, and perhaps still as many more not\r\nexceeding twenty sous.\"[5149] Contemporary observers authenticate this\r\npassion of the peasant for land. \"The savings of the lower classes,\r\nwhich elsewhere are invested with individuals and in the public funds,\r\nare wholly destined in France to the purchase of land.\" \"Accordingly the\r\nnumber of small rural holdings is always on the increase. Necker\r\nsays that there is an immensity of them.\" Arthur Young, in 1789, is\r\nastonished at their great number and \"inclines to think that they form a\r\nthird of the kingdom.\" This already would be our actual estimate, and we\r\nstill find, approximately, the actual figures, on estimating the number\r\nof proprietors in comparison with the number of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe small cultivator, however, in becoming a possessor of the soil\r\nassumed its charges. Simply as day-laborer, and with his arms alone, he\r\nwas only partially affected by the taxes; \"where there is nothing the\r\nking loses his dues.\" But now, vainly is he poor and declaring himself\r\nstill poorer; the fisc has a hold on him and on every portion of his\r\nnew possessions. The collectors, peasants like himself, and jealous, by\r\nvirtue of being his neighbors, know how much his property, exposed to\r\nview, brings in; hence they take all they can lay their hands on. Vainly\r\nhas he labored with renewed energy; his hands remain as empty, and,\r\nat the end of the year, he discovers that his field has produced him\r\nnothing. The more he acquires and produces the more burdensome do the\r\ntaxes become. In 1715, the taille and the poll-tax, which he alone pays,\r\nor nearly alone, amounts to sixty-six millions of livres; the amount\r\nis ninety-three millions in 1759 and one hundred and ten millions in\r\n1789.[5150] In 1757, the charges amount to 283,156,000 livres; in 1789\r\nto 476,294,000 livres.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, through humanity and through good sense, there is,\r\ndoubtless, a desire to relieve the peasant, and pity is felt for him.\r\nBut, in practice, through necessity and routine, he is treated according\r\nto Cardinal Richelieu's precept, as a beast of burden to which oats is\r\nsparingly rationed out for fear that he may become too strong and kick,\r\n\"a mule which, accustomed to his load, is spoiled more by long repose\r\nthan by work.\"....\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5101: Labruyère, edition of Destailleurs, II, 97.

The sale of the national property seems not to have\r\nsensibly increased small properties nor sensibly diminished the number\r\nof the large ones. The Revolution developed moderate sized properties.\r\nIn 1848, the large estates numbered 183,000 (23,000 families paying 300\r\nfrancs taxes, and more, and possessing on the average 260 hectares\r\nof land, and 160,000 families paying from 230 to 500 francs taxes and\r\npossessing on the average 75 hectares.)

TAXATION THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF MISERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Extortion.\r\n\r\n     Direct taxes.--State of different domains at the end of the\r\n     reign of Louis XV.--Levies of the tithe and the owner.--What\r\n     remains to the proprietor.\r\n\r\nLet us closely examine the extortions he has to endure, which are very\r\ngreat, much beyond any that we can imagine. Economists had long prepared\r\nthe budget of a farm and shown by statistics the excess of charges with\r\nwhich the cultivator is overwhelmed. If he continues to cultivate, they\r\nsay, he must have his share in the crops, an inviolable portion, equal\r\nto one-half of the entire production, and from which nothing can\r\nbe deducted without ruining him. This portion, in short, accurately\r\nrepresents, and not a sou too much, in the first place, the interest\r\nof the capital first expended on the farm in cattle, furniture, and\r\nimplements of husbandry; in the second place, the maintenance of this\r\ncapital, every year depreciated by wear and tear; in the third place,\r\nthe advances made during the current year for seed, wages, and food for\r\nmen and animals; and, in the last place, the compensation due him for\r\nthe risks he takes and his losses. Here is a first lien which must be\r\nsatisfied beforehand, taking precedence of all others, superior to that\r\nof the seignior, to that of the tithe-owner (décimateur), to even that\r\nof the king, for it is an indebtedness due to the soil.[5201] After this\r\nis paid back, then, and only then, that which remains, the net product,\r\ncan be touched. Now, in the then state of agriculture, the tithe-owner\r\nand the king appropriate one-half of this net product, when the estate\r\nis large, and the whole, if the estate is a small one[5202]. A certain\r\nlarge farm in Picardy, worth to its owner 3,600 livres, pays 1,800\r\nlivres to the king, and 1,311 livres to the tithe owner; another, in the\r\nSoissonnais, rented for 4,500 livres, pays 2,200 livres taxes and more\r\nthan 1,000 livres to the tithes. An ordinary métayer-farm near Nevers\r\npays into the treasury 138 livres, 121 livres to the church, and\r\n114 livres to the proprietor. On another, in Poitou, the fisc (tax\r\nauthorities) absorbs 348 livres, and the proprietor receives only 238.\r\nIn general, in the regions of large farms, the proprietor obtains ten\r\nlivres the arpent if the cultivation is very good, and three livres when\r\nordinary. In the regions of small farms, and of the métayer system, he\r\ngets fifteen sous the arpent, eight sous and even six sous. The entire\r\nnet profit may be said to go to the church and into the State treasury.\r\n\r\nHired labor, meantime, is no less costly. On this métayer-farm in\r\nPoitou, which brings in eight sous the arpent, thirty-six laborers\r\nconsume each twenty-six francs per annum in rye, two francs respectively\r\nin vegetables, oil and milk preparations, and two francs ten sous in\r\npork, amounting to a sum total, each year, for each person, of sixteen\r\npounds of meat at an expense of thirty-six francs. In fact they drink\r\nwater only, use rape-seed oil for soup and for light, never taste\r\nbutter, and dress themselves in materials made of the wool and hair of\r\nthe sheep and goats they raise. They purchase nothing save the tools\r\nnecessary to make the fabrics of which these provide the material. On\r\nanother metayer-farm, on the confines of la Marche and Berry, forty-six\r\nlaborers cost a smaller sum, each one consuming only the value of\r\ntwenty-five francs per annum. We can judge by this of the exorbitant\r\nshare appropriated to themselves by the Church and State, since, at so\r\nsmall a cost of cultivation, the proprietor finds in his pocket, at the\r\nend of the year, six or eight sous per arpent out of which, if plebeian,\r\nhe must still pay the dues to his seignior, contribute to the common\r\npurse for the militia, buy his taxed salt and work out his corvée and\r\nthe rest. Towards the end of the reign of Louis XV in Limousin, says\r\nTurgot,[5203] the king derives for himself alone \"about as much from the\r\nsoil as the proprietor.\" In a certain election-district, that of Tulle,\r\nwhere he abstracts fifty-six and one-half per cent. of the product,\r\nthere remains to the latter forty-three and one-half per cent. thus\r\naccounting for \"a multitude of domains being abandoned.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that time renders the tax less onerous or that,\r\nin other provinces, the cultivator is better treated. In this respect\r\nthe documents are authentic and almost up to the latest hour. We have\r\nonly to take up the official statements of the provincial assemblies\r\nheld in 1787, to learn by official figures to what extent the fisc may\r\nabuse the men who labor, and take bread out of the mouths of those who\r\nhave earned it by the sweat of their brows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Local Conditions.\r\n\r\n     State of certain provinces on the outbreak of the\r\n     Revolution.--The taille, and other taxes.--The proportion of\r\n     these taxes in relation to income.--The sum total immense.\r\n\r\nDirect taxation alone is here concerned, the tailles, collateral\r\ntaxes, poll-tax, vingtièmes, and the pecuniary tax substituted for\r\nthe corvée[5204] In Champagne, the tax-payer pays on 100 livres\r\nincome fifty-four livres fifteen sous, on the average, and in many\r\nparishes,[5205] seventy-one livres thirteen sous. In the Ile-de-France,\r\n\"if a taxable inhabitant of a village, the proprietor of twenty arpents\r\nof land which he himself works, and the income of which is estimated at\r\nten livres per arpent it is supposed that he is likewise the owner of\r\nthe house he occupies, the site being valued at forty livres.\"[5206]\r\nThis tax-payer pays for his real taille, personal and industrial,\r\nthirty-five livres fourteen sous, for collateral taxes seventeen livres\r\nseventeen sous, for the poll-tax twenty-one livres eight sous, for the\r\nvingtièmes twenty-four livres four sous, in all ninety-nine livres three\r\nsous, to which must be added about five livres as the substitution for\r\nthe corvée, in all 104 livres on a piece of property which he rents for\r\n240 livres, a tax amounting to five-twelfths of his income.\r\n\r\nIt is much worse on making the same calculation for the poorer\r\ngeneralities. In Haute-Guyenne,[5207] \"all property in land is taxed\r\nfor the taille, the collateral taxes, and the vingtièmes, more than\r\none-quarter of its revenue, the only deduction being the expenses of\r\ncultivation; also dwellings, one-third of their revenue, deducting\r\nonly the cost of repairs and of maintenance; to which must be added the\r\npoll-tax, which takes about one-tenth of the revenue; the tithe, which\r\nabsorbs one-seventh; the seigniorial rents which take another seventh;\r\nthe tax substituted for the corvée; the costs of compulsory collections,\r\nseizures, sequestration and constraints, and all ordinary and\r\nextraordinary local charges. This being subtracted, it is evident that,\r\nin communities moderately taxed, the proprietor does not enjoy a third\r\nof his income, and that, in the communities wronged by the assessments,\r\nthe proprietors are reduced to the status of simple farmers scarcely\r\nable to get enough to restore the expenses of cultivation.\" In\r\nAuvergne,[5208] the taille amounts to four sous on the livre net profit;\r\nthe collateral taxes and the poll-tax take off four sous three deniers\r\nmore; the vingtièmes, two sous and three deniers; the contribution to\r\nthe royal roads, to the free gift, to local charges and the cost of\r\nlevying, take again one sou one denier, the total being eleven sous and\r\nseven deniers on the livre income, without counting seigniorial dues and\r\nthe tithe. \"The bureau, moreover, recognizes with regret, that several\r\nof the collections pay at the rate of seventeen sous, sixteen sous, and\r\nthe most moderate at the rate of fourteen sous the livre. The evidence\r\nof this is in the bureau; it is on file in the registry of the court\r\nof excise, and of the election-districts. It is still more apparent\r\nin parishes where an infinite number of assessments are found, laid on\r\nproperty that has been abandoned, which the collectors lease, and the\r\nproduct of which is often inadequate to pay the tax.\" Statistics of this\r\nkind are terribly eloquent. They may be summed up in one word. Putting\r\ntogether Normandy, the Orleans region, that of Soissons, Champagne,\r\nIle-de-France, Berry, Poitou, Auvergne, the Lyons region, Gascony, and\r\nHaute-Guyenne, in brief the principal election sections, we find that\r\nout of every hundred francs of revenue the direct tax on the tax-payer\r\nis fifty-three francs, or more than one-half[5209]. This is about five\r\ntimes as much as at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Common Laborer.\r\n\r\nFour direct taxes on the common laborer.\r\n\r\nThe taxation authorities, however, in thus bearing down on taxable\r\nproperty has not released the taxable person without property. In the\r\nabsence of land it seizes on men. In default of an income it taxes a\r\nman's wages. With the exception of the vingtièmes, the preceding taxes\r\nnot only bore on those who possessed something but, again, on those who\r\npossessed nothing. In the Toulousain[5210] at St. Pierre de Barjouville,\r\nthe poorest day-laborer, with nothing but his hands by which to earn\r\nhis support, and getting ten sous a day, pays eight, nine and ten\r\nlivres poll-tax. \"In Burgundy[5211] it is common to see a poor mechanic,\r\nwithout any property, taxed eighteen and twenty livres for his poll-tax\r\nand the taille.\" In Limousin,[5212] all the money brought back by the\r\nmasons in winter serves \"to pay the taxes charged to their families.\" As\r\nto the rural day-laborers and the settlers (colons) the proprietor, even\r\nwhen privileged, who employs them, is obliged to take upon himself a\r\npart of their quota, otherwise, being without anything to eat, they\r\ncannot work,[5213] even in the interest of the master; man must have his\r\nration of bread the same as an ox his ration of hay. \"In Brittany,[5214]\r\nit is notorious that nine-tenths of the artisans, though poorly fed and\r\npoorly clothed, have not a crown free of debt at the end of the year,\"\r\nthe poll-tax and others carrying off this only and last crown. At\r\nParis[5215] \"the dealer in ashes, the buyer of old bottles, the gleaner\r\nof the gutters, the peddlers of old iron and old hats,\" the moment they\r\nobtain a shelter pay the poll-tax of three livres and ten sous each. To\r\nensure its payment the occupant of a house who sub-lets to them is\r\nmade responsible. Moreover, in case of delay, a \"blue man,\" a bailiff's\r\nsubordinate, is sent who installs himself on the spot and whose time\r\nthey have to pay for. Mercier cites a mechanic, named Quatremain,\r\nwho, with four small children, lodged in the sixth story, where he had\r\narranged a chimney as a sort of alcove in which he and his family\r\nslept. \"One day I opened his door, fastened with a latch only, the room\r\npresenting to view nothing but the walls and a vice; the man, coming\r\nout from under his chimney, half sick, says to me, 'I thought it was the\r\nblue man for the poll-tax.\"' Thus, whatever the condition of the person\r\nsubject to taxation, however stripped and destitute, the dexterous hands\r\nof the fisc take hold of him. Mistakes cannot possibly occur: it puts on\r\nno disguise, it comes on the appointed day and rudely lays its hand\r\non his shoulder. The garret and the hut, as well as the farm and the\r\nfarmhouse know the collector, the constable and the bailiff; no hovel\r\nescapes the detestable brood. The people sow, harvest their crops, work\r\nand undergo privation for their benefit; and, should the pennies so\r\npainfully saved each week amount, at the end of the year to a piece of\r\nsilver, the mouth of their pouch closes over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Collections And Seizures.--Observe the system actually at work. It\r\nis a sort of shearing machine, clumsy and badly put together, of which\r\nthe action is about as mischievous as it is serviceable. The worst\r\nfeature is that, with its creaking gear, the taxable, those employed\r\nas its final instruments, are equally shorn and flayed. Each parish\r\ncontains two, three, five, or seven individuals who, under the title of\r\ncollectors, and under the authority of the election tribunal, apportion\r\nand assess the taxes. \"No duty is more onerous;\"[5216] everybody,\r\nthrough patronage or favor, tries to get rid of it. The communities are\r\nconstantly pleading against the refractory, and, that nobody may escape\r\nunder the pretext of ignorance, the table of future collectors is made\r\nup for ten and fifteen years in advance. In parishes of the second class\r\nthese consist of \"small proprietors, each of whom becomes a collector\r\nabout every six years.\" In many of the villages the artisans,\r\nday-laborers, and métayer-farmers perform the service, although\r\nrequiring all their time to earn their own living. In Auvergne, where\r\nthe able-bodied men expatriate themselves in winter to find work,\r\nthe women are taken;[5217] in the election-district of Saint-Flour, a\r\ncertain village has four collectors in petticoats.--They are responsible\r\nfor all claims entrusted to them, their property, their furniture and\r\ntheir persons; and, up to the time of Turgot, each is bound for the\r\nothers. We can judge of their risks and sufferings. In 1785,[5218] in\r\none single district in Champagne, eighty-five are imprisoned and two\r\nhundred of them are on the road every year. \"The collector, says the\r\nprovincial assembly of Berry,[5219] usually passes one-half of the day\r\nfor two years running from door to door to see delinquent tax-payers.\"\r\n\"This service,\" writes Turgot,[5220] \"is the despair and almost\r\nalways the ruin of those obliged to perform it; all families in easy\r\ncircumstances in a village are thus successively reduced to want.\" In\r\nshort, there is no collector who is not forced to act and who has not\r\neach year \"eight or ten writs\" served on him[5221]. Sometimes he is\r\nimprisoned at the expense of the parish. Sometimes proceedings are\r\ninstituted against him and the tax-contributors by the installation of\r\n\"'blue men' and seizures, seizures under arrest, seizures in execution\r\nand sales of furniture.\" \"In the single district of Villefranche,\" says\r\nthe provincial Assembly of Haute-Guyenne, \"a hundred and six warrant\r\nofficers and other agents of the bailiff are counted always on the\r\nroad.\"\r\n\r\nThe thing becomes customary and the parish suffers in vain, for it\r\nwould suffer yet more were it to do otherwise. \"Near Aurillac,\" says the\r\nMarquis de Mirabeau,[5222] \"there is industry, application and economy\r\nwithout which there would be only misery and want. This produces a\r\npeople equally divided into being, on the one hand, insolvent and poor\r\nand on the other hand shameful and rich, the latter who, for fear\r\nof being fined, create the impoverished. The taille once assessed,\r\neverybody groans and complains and nobody pays it. The term having\r\nexpired, at the hour and minute, constraint begins, the collectors,\r\nalthough able, taking no trouble to arrest this by making a settlement,\r\nnotwithstanding the installation of the bailiff's men is costly. But\r\nthis kind of expense is habitual and people expect it instead of fearing\r\nit, for, if it were less rigorous, they would be sure to be additionally\r\nburdened the following year.\" The receiver, indeed, who pays the\r\nbailiff's officers a franc a day, makes them pay two francs and\r\nappropriates the difference. Hence \"if certain parishes venture to pay\r\npromptly, without awaiting constraint, the receiver, who sees himself\r\ndeprived of the best portion of his gains, becomes ill-humored, and, at\r\nthe next department (meeting), an arrangement is made between himself,\r\nmessieurs the elected, the sub-delegate and other shavers of this\r\nspecies, for the parish to bear a double load, to teach it how to behave\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nA population of administrative blood-suckers thus lives on the peasant.\r\n\"Lately,\" says an intendant, \"in the district of Romorantin,[5223] the\r\ncollectors received nothing from a sale of furniture amounting to six\r\nhundred livres, because the proceeds were absorbed by the expenses. In\r\nthe district of Chateaudun the same thing occurred at a sale amounting\r\nto nine hundred livres and there are other transactions of the same kind\r\nof which we have no information, however flagrant.\" Besides this, the\r\nfisc itself is pitiless. The same intendant writes, in 1784, a year\r\nof famine:[5224] \"People have seen, with horror, the collector, in the\r\ncountry, disputing with heads of families over the costs of a sale of\r\nfurniture which had been appropriated to stopping their children's cry\r\nof want.\" Were the collectors not to make seizures they would themselves\r\nbe seized. Urged on by the receiver we see them, in the documents,\r\nsoliciting, prosecuting and persecuting the tax-payers. Every Sunday and\r\nevery fête-day they are posted at the church door to warn delinquents;\r\nand then, during the week they go from door to door to obtain their\r\ndues. \"Commonly they cannot write, and take a scribe with them.\" Out of\r\nsix hundred and six traversing the district of Saint-Flour not ten of\r\nthem are able to read the official summons and sign a receipt; hence\r\ninnumerable mistakes and frauds. Besides a scribe they take along the\r\nbailiff's subordinates, persons of the lowest class, laborers without\r\nwork, conscious of being hated and who act accordingly. \"Whatever orders\r\nmay be given them not to take anything, not to make the inhabitants feed\r\nthem, or to enter taverns with collectors,\" habit is too strong \"and\r\nthe abuse continues.\"[5225] But, burdensome as the bailiff's men may be,\r\ncare is taken not to evade them. In this respect, writes an intendant,\r\n\"their obduracy is strange.\" \"No person,\" a receiver reports,[5226]\r\n\"pays the collector until he sees the bailiff's man in his house.\" The\r\npeasant resembles his ass, refusing to go without being beaten, and,\r\nalthough in this he may appear stupid, he is clever. For the collector,\r\nbeing responsible, \"naturally inclines to an increase of the assessment\r\non prompt payers to the advantage of the negligent. Hence the prompt\r\npayer becomes, in his turn, negligent and, although with money in\r\nhis chest, he allows the process to go on.\"[5227] Summing all up, he\r\ncalculates that the process, even if expensive, costs less than extra\r\ntaxation, and of the two evils he chooses the least. He has but one\r\nresource against the collector and receiver, his simulated or actual\r\npoverty, voluntary or involuntary. \"Every one subject to the taille,\"\r\nsays, again, the provincial assembly of Berry, \"dreads to expose his\r\nresources; he avoids any display of these in his furniture, in\r\nhis dress, in his food, and in everything open to another's\r\nobservation.\"--\"M. de Choiseul-Gouffier,[5228] willing to roof his\r\npeasants' houses, liable to take fire, with tiles, they thanked him for\r\nhis kindness but begged him to leave them as they were, telling him\r\nthat if these were covered with tiles, instead of with thatch, the\r\nsubdelegates would increase their taxation.\"--\"People work, but merely\r\nto satisfy their prime necessities. . . . The fear of paying an\r\nextra crown makes an average man neglect a profit of four times the\r\namount.\"[5229]--\". . . Accordingly, lean cattle, poor implements,\r\nand bad manure-heaps even among those who might have been better\r\noff.\"[5230]--\"If I earned any more,\" says a peasant, \"it would be for\r\nthe collector.\" Annual and illimitable spoliation \"takes away even\r\nthe desire for comforts.\" The majority, pusillanimous, distrustful,\r\nstupefied, \"debased,\" \"differing little from the old serfs,[5231]\"\r\nresemble Egyptian fellahs and Hindoo pariahs. The fisc, indeed, through\r\nthe absolutism and enormity of its claims, renders property of all kinds\r\nprecarious, every acquisition vain, every accumulation delusive; in\r\nfact, proprietors are owners only of that which they can hide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Indirect Taxes.\r\n\r\nThe salt-tax and the excise.\r\n\r\nThe tax-man, in every country, has two hands, one which visibly and\r\ndirectly searches the coffers of tax-payers, and the other which\r\ncovertly employs the hand of an intermediary so as not to incur the\r\nodium of fresh extortions. Here, no precaution of this kind is taken,\r\nthe claws of the latter being as visible as those of the former;\r\naccording to its structure and the complaints made of it, I am tempted\r\nto believe it more offensive than the other.--In the first place, the\r\nsalt-tax, the excises and the customs are annually estimated and sold\r\nto adjudicators who, purely as a business matter, make as much profit\r\nas they can by their bargain. In relation to the tax-payer they are not\r\nadministrators but speculators; they have bought him up. He belongs to\r\nthem by the terms of their contract; they will squeeze out of him, not\r\nmerely their advances and the interest on their advances, but, again,\r\nevery possible benefit. This suffices to indicate the mode of levying\r\nindirect taxes.--In the second place, by means of the salt-tax and the\r\nexcises, the inquisition enters each household. In the provinces where\r\nthese are levied, in Ile-de-France, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, Orleanais,\r\nBerry, Bourbonnais, Bourgogne, Champagne, Perche, Normandy and Picardy,\r\nsalt costs thirteen sous a pound, four times as much as at the present\r\nday, and, considering the standard of money, eight times as much[5232].\r\nAnd, furthermore, by virtue of the ordinance of 1680, each person over\r\nseven years of age is expected to purchase seven pounds per annum,\r\nwhich, with four persons to a family, makes eighteen francs a year, and\r\nequal to nineteen days' work: a new direct tax, which, like the taille,\r\nis a fiscal hand in the pockets of the tax-payers, and compelling them,\r\nlike the taille, to torment each other. Many of them, in fact, are\r\nofficially appointed to assess this obligatory use of salt and, like the\r\ncollectors of the taille, these are \"jointly responsible for the price\r\nof the salt.\" Others below them, ever following the same course as in\r\ncollecting the taille, are likewise responsible. \"After the former have\r\nbeen seized in their persons and property, the speculator fermier\r\nis authorized to commence action, under the principle of mutual\r\nresponsibility, against the principal inhabitants of the parish.\"\r\nThe effects of this system have just been described. Accordingly, \"in\r\nNormandy,\" says the Rouen parliament,[5233] \"unfortunates without bread\r\nare daily objects of seizure, sale and execution.\"\r\n\r\nBut if the rigor is as great as in the matter of the taille, the\r\nvexations are ten times greater, for these are domestic, minute and\r\nof daily occurrence.--It is forbidden to divert an ounce of the seven\r\nobligatory pounds to any use but that of the \"pot and the salt-cellar.\"\r\nIf a villager should economize the salt of his soup to make brine for a\r\npiece of pork, with a view to winter consumption, let him look out for\r\nthe collecting-clerks! His pork is confiscated and the fine is three\r\nhundred livres. The man must come to the warehouse and purchase other\r\nsalt, make a declaration, carry off a certificate and show this at\r\nevery visit of inspection. So much the worse for him if he has not the\r\nwherewithal to pay for this supplementary salt; he has only to sell his\r\npig and abstain from meat at Christmas. This is the more frequent case,\r\nand I dare say that, for the métayers who pay twenty-five francs per\r\nannum, it is the usual case.--It is forbidden to make use of any other\r\nsalt for the pot and salt-cellar than that of the seven pounds. \"I am\r\nable to cite,\" says Letrosne, \"two sisters residing one league from a\r\ntown in which the warehouse is open only on Saturday. Their supply was\r\nexhausted. To pass three or four days until Saturday comes they boil a\r\nremnant of brine from which they extract a few ounces of salt. A visit\r\nfrom the clerk ensues and a procès-verbal. Having friends and protectors\r\nthis costs them only forty-eight livres.\"--It is forbidden to take water\r\nfrom the ocean and from other saline sources, under a penalty of from\r\ntwenty to forty livres fine. It is forbidden to water cattle in marshes\r\nand other places containing salt, under penalty of confiscation and\r\na fine of three hundred livres. It is forbidden to put salt into\r\nthe bellies of mackerel on returning from fishing, or between their\r\nsuperposed layers. An order prescribes one pound and a half to a barrel.\r\nAnother order prescribes the destruction annually of the natural salt\r\nformed in certain cantons in Provence. Judges are prohibited from\r\nmoderating or reducing the penalties imposed in salt cases, under\r\npenalty of accountability and of deposition.--I pass over quantities\r\nof orders and prohibitions, existing by hundreds. This legislation\r\nencompasses tax-payers like a net with a thousand meshes, while the\r\nofficial who casts it is interested in finding them at fault. We see the\r\nfisherman, accordingly, unpacking his barrel, the housewife seeking a\r\ncertificate for her hams, the exciseman inspecting the buffet, testing\r\nthe brine, peering into the salt-box and, if it is of good quality,\r\ndeclaring it contraband because that of the ferme, the only legitimate\r\nsalt, is usually adulterated and mixed with plaster.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other officials, those of the excise, descend into the\r\ncellar. None are more formidable, nor who more eagerly seize on pretexts\r\nfor delinquency[5234]. \"Let a citizen charitably bestow a bottle of\r\nwine on a poor feeble creature and he is liable to prosecution and to\r\nexcessive penalties. . . . The poor invalid that may interest his curate\r\nin the begging of a bottle of wine for him will undergo a trial, ruining\r\nnot alone the unfortunate man that obtains it, but again the benefactor\r\nwho gave it to him. This is not a fancied story.\" By virtue of the right\r\nof deficient revenue the clerks may, at any hour, take an inventory of\r\nwine on hand, even the stores of a vineyard proprietor, indicate what he\r\nmay consume, tax him for the rest and for the surplus quantity already\r\ndrunk, the ferme thus associating itself with the wine-producer and\r\nclaiming its portion of his production.--In a vine-yard at Epernay[5235]\r\non four casks of wine, the average product of one arpent, and worth six\r\nhundred francs, it levies, at first, thirty francs, and then, after the\r\nsale of the four casks, seventy five francs additionally. Naturally,\r\n\"the inhabitants resort to the shrewdest and best planned artifices\r\nto escape\" such potent rights. But the clerks are alert, watchful, and\r\nwell-informed, and they pounce down unexpectedly on every suspected\r\ndomicile; their instructions prescribe frequent inspections and exact\r\nregistries \"enabling them to see at a glance the condition of the\r\ncellar of each inhabitant.\"[5236]--The manufacturer having paid up, the\r\nmerchant now has his turn. The latter, on sending the four casks to\r\nthe consumer--again pays seventy-five francs to the ferme. The wine\r\nis dispatched and the ferme prescribes the roads by which it must go;\r\nshould others be taken it is confiscated, and at every step on the way\r\nsome payment must be made. \"A boat laden with wine from Languedoc,[5237]\r\nDauphiny or Roussillon, ascending the Rhone and descending the Loire\r\nto reach Paris, through the Briare canal, pays on the way, leaving\r\nout charges on the Rhone, from thirty-five to forty kinds of duty, not\r\ncomprising the charges on entering Paris.\" It pays these \"at fifteen or\r\nsixteen places, the multiplied payments obliging the carriers to devote\r\ntwelve or fifteen days more to the passage than they otherwise would if\r\ntheir duties could be paid at one bureau.\"--The charges on the routes\r\nby water are particularly heavy. \"From Pontarlier to Lyons there are\r\ntwenty-five or thirty tolls; from Lyons to Aigues-Mortes there are\r\nothers, so that whatever costs ten sous in Burgundy, amounts to\r\nfifteen and eighteen sous at Lyons, and to over twenty-five sous at\r\nAigues-Mortes.\"--The wine at last reaches the barriers of the city where\r\nit is to be drunk. Here it pays an octroi[5238] of forty-seven francs\r\nper hogshead.--Entering Paris it goes into the tapster's or innkeeper's\r\ncellar where it again pays from thirty to forty francs for the duty on\r\nselling it at retail; at Rethel the duty is from fifty to sixty francs\r\nper puncheon, Rheims gauge.--The total is exorbitant. \"At Rennes,[5239]\r\nthe dues and duties on a hogshead (or barrel) of Bordeaux wine, together\r\nwith a fifth over and above the tax, local charges, eight sous per pound\r\nand the octroi, amount to more than seventy-two livres exclusive of the\r\npurchase money; to which must be added the expenses and duties advanced\r\nby the Rennes merchant and which he recovers from the purchaser,\r\nBordeaux drayage, freight, insurance, tolls of the flood-gate, entrance\r\nduty into the town, hospital dues, fees of gaugers, brokers and\r\ninspectors. The total outlay for the tapster who sells a barrel of wine\r\namounts to two hundred livres.\" We may imagine whether, at this\r\nprice, the people of Rennes drink it, while these charges fall on the\r\nwine-grower, since, if consumers do not purchase, he is unable to sell.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, among the small growers, he is the most to be pitied;\r\naccording to the testimony of Arthur Young, wine-grower and misery are\r\ntwo synonymous terms. The crop often fails, \"every doubtful crop ruining\r\nthe man without capital.\" In Burgundy, in Berry, in Soisonnais, in the\r\nTrois-Evêche's, in Champagne,[5240] I find in every report that he\r\nlacks bread and lives on alms. In Champagne, the syndics of Bar-sur-Aube\r\nwrite[5241] that the inhabitants, to escape duties, have more than once\r\nemptied their wine into the river, the provincial assembly declaring\r\nthat \"in the greater portion of the province the slightest augmentation\r\nof duties would cause the cultivators to desert the soil.\"--Such is the\r\nhistory of wine under the ancient regime. From the producer who grows\r\nto the tapster who sells, what extortions and what vexations! As to\r\nthe salt-tax, according to the comptroller-general,[5242] this annually\r\nproduces 4,000 domiciliary seizures, 3,400 imprisonments, 500 sentences\r\nto flogging, exile and the galleys.--\r\n\r\nIf ever two taxes were well combined, not only to despoil, but also to\r\nirritate the peasantry, the poor and the people, here they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Burdens And Exemptions.\r\n\r\nWhy taxation is so burdensome.--Exemptions and privileges.\r\n\r\nEvidently the burden of taxation forms the chief cause of misery; hence\r\nan accumulated, deep-seated hatred against the fisc and its agents,\r\nreceivers, store-house keepers, excise officials, customs officers and\r\nclerks.--But why is taxation so burdensome? As far as the communes which\r\nannually plead in detail against certain gentlemen to subject them to\r\nthe taille are concerned, there is no doubt. What renders the charge\r\noppressive is the fact that the strongest and those best able to bear\r\ntaxation succeed in evading it, the prime cause of misery being the\r\nvastness of the exemptions[5243].\r\n\r\nLet us look at each of these exemptions, one tax after another.--In\r\nthe first place, not only are nobles and ecclesiastics exempt from the\r\npersonal taille but again, as we have already seen, they are exempt from\r\nthe cultivator's taille, through cultivating their domains themselves\r\nor by a steward. In Auvergne,[5244] in the single election-district\r\nof Clermont, fifty parishes are enumerated in which, owing to this\r\narrangement, every estate of a privileged person is exempt, the taille\r\nfalling wholly on those subject to it. Furthermore, it suffices for a\r\nprivileged person to maintain that his farmer is only a steward, which\r\nis the case in Poitou in several parishes, the subdelegate and the\r\nélu not daring to look into the matter too closely. In this way the\r\nprivileged classes escape the taille, they and their property, including\r\ntheir farms.--Now, the taille, ever augmenting, is that which provides,\r\nthrough its special delegations, such a vast number of new offices. A\r\nman of the Third-Estate has merely to run through the history of its\r\nperiodical increase to see how it alone, or almost alone, paid and is\r\npaying[5245] for the construction of bridges, roads, canals and courts\r\nof justice, for the purchase of offices, for the establishment and\r\nsupport of houses of refuge, insane asylums, nurseries, post-houses for\r\nhorses, fencing and riding schools, for paving and sweeping Paris, for\r\nsalaries of lieutenants-general, governors, and provincial commanders,\r\nfor the fees of bailiffs, seneschals and vice-bailiffs, for the salaries\r\nof financial and election officials and of commissioners dispatched to\r\nthe provinces, for those of the police of the watch and I know not how\r\nmany other purposes.--In the provinces which hold assemblies, where the\r\ntaille would seem to be more justly apportioned, the like inequality\r\nis found. In Burgundy[5246] the expenses of the police, of public\r\nfestivities, of keeping horses, all sums appropriated to the courses\r\nof lectures on chemistry, botany, anatomy and parturition, to the\r\nencouragement of the arts, to subscriptions to the chancellorship, to\r\nfranking letters, to presents given to the chiefs and subalterns of\r\ncommands, to salaries of officials of the provincial assemblies, to the\r\nministerial secretaryship, to expenses of levying taxes and even alms,\r\nin short, 1,800,000 livres are spent in the public service at the charge\r\nof the Third-Estate, the two higher orders not paying a cent.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, with respect to the poll-tax, originally\r\ndistributed among twenty-two classes and intended to bear equally on\r\nall according to fortunes, we know that, from the first, the clergy buy\r\nthemselves off; and, as to the nobles, they manage so well as to have\r\ntheir tax reduced proportionately with its increase at the expense of\r\nthe Third-Estate. A count or a marquis, an intendant or a master of\r\nrequests, with 40,000 livres income, who, according to the tariff of\r\n1695,[5247] should pay from 1,700 to 2,500 livres, pays only 400 livres,\r\nwhile a bourgeois with 6,000 livres income, and who, according to\r\nthe same tariff; should pay 70 livres, pays 720. The poll-tax of the\r\nprivileged individual is thus diminished three-quarters or five-sixths,\r\nwhile that of the taille-payer has increased tenfold. In the\r\nIle-de-France,[5248] on an income of 240 livres, the taille-payer pays\r\ntwenty-one livres eight sous, and the nobles three livres, and the\r\nintendant himself states that he taxes the nobles only an eightieth of\r\ntheir revenue; that of Orléanais taxes them only a hundredth, while,\r\non the other hand, those subject to the taille are assessed\r\none-eleventh.--If other privileged parties are added to the nobles, such\r\nas officers of justice, employee's of the fermes, and exempted townsmen,\r\na group is formed embracing nearly everybody rich or well-off and whose\r\nrevenue certainly greatly surpasses that of those who are subject to the\r\ntaille. Now, the budgets of the provincial assemblies inform us how much\r\neach province levies on each of the two groups: in the Lyonnais district\r\nthose subject to the taille pay 898,000 livres, the privileged, 190,000;\r\nin the Ile-de-France, the former pay 2,689,000 livres and the latter\r\n232,000; in the generalship of Alençon, the former pay 1,067,000 livres\r\nand the latter 122,000; in Champagne, the former pay 1,377,000 livres,\r\nand the latter 199,000; in Haute-Guyenne, the former pay 1,268,000\r\nlivres, and the latter 61,000; in the generalship of Auch, the former\r\npay 797,000 livres, the privileged 21,000; in Auvergne the former pay\r\n1,753,000 livres and the latter 86,000; in short, summing up the total\r\nof ten provinces, 11,636,000 livres paid by the poor group and 1,450,000\r\nlivres by the rich group, the latter paying eight times less than it\r\nought to pay.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the vingtièmes, the disproportion is less, the precise\r\namounts not being attainable; we may nevertheless assume that the\r\nassessment of the privileged class is about one-half of what it should\r\nbe. \"In 1772,\" says[5249] M. de Calonne, \"it was admitted that the\r\nvingtièmes were not carried to their full value. False declarations,\r\ncounterfeit leases, too favorable conditions granted to almost all the\r\nwealthy proprietors gave rise to inequalities and countless errors.\r\nA verification of 4,902 parishes shows that the product of the two\r\nvingtièmes amounting to 54,000,000 should have amounted to 81,000,000.\"\r\nA seigniorial domain which, according to its own return of income,\r\nshould pay 2,400 livres, pays only 1,216. The case is much worse with\r\nthe princes of the blood; we have seen that their domains are exempt and\r\npay only 188,000 livres instead of 2,400,000. Under this system, which\r\ncrushes the weak to relieve the strong, the more capable one is of\r\ncontributing, the less one contributes.--The same story characterizes\r\nthe fourth and last direct taxation, namely, the tax substituted for the\r\ncorvée. This tax, attached, at first, to the vingtièmes and consequently\r\nextending to all proprietors, through an act of the Council is attached\r\nto the taille and, consequently, bears on those the most burdened[5250].\r\nNow this tax amounts to an extra of one-quarter added to the principal\r\nof the taille, of which one example may be cited, that of Champagne,\r\nwhere, on every 100 livres income the sum of six livres five sous\r\ndevolves on the taille-payer. \"Thus,\" says the provincial assembly,\r\n\"every road used by active commerce, by the multiplied coursing of the\r\nrich, is repaired wholly by the contributions of the poor.\"--As these\r\nfigures spread out before the eye we involuntarily recur to the two\r\nanimals in the fable, the horse and the mule traveling together on the\r\nsame road; the horse, by right, may prance along as he pleases; hence\r\nhis load is gradually transferred to the mule, the beast of burden,\r\nwhich finally sinks beneath the extra load.\r\n\r\nNot only, in the corps of tax-payers, are the privileged disburdened to\r\nthe detriment of the taxable, but again, in the corps of the taxable,\r\nthe rich are relieved to the injury of the poor, to such an extent that\r\nthe heaviest portion of the load finally falls on the most indigent and\r\nmost laborious class, on the small proprietor cultivating his own field,\r\non the simple artisan with nothing but his tools and his hands, and,\r\nin general, on the inhabitants of villages. In the first place, in\r\nthe matter of taxes, a number of the towns are \"abonnées,\" or free.\r\nCompiègne, for the taille and its accessories, with 1,671 firesides,\r\npays only 8,000 francs, whilst one of the villages in its neighborhood,\r\nCanly, with 148 firesides, pays 4,475 francs[5251]. In the poll-tax,\r\nVersailles, Saint-Germain, Beauvais, Etampes, Pontoise, Saint-Denis,\r\nCompiegne, Fontainebleau, taxed in the aggregate at 169,000 livres, are\r\ntwo-thirds exempt, contributing but little more than one franc, instead\r\nof three francs ten sous, per head of the population; at Versailles it\r\nis still less, since for 70,000 inhabitants the poll-tax amounts to only\r\n51,600 francs[5252]. Besides, in any event, on the apportionment of a\r\ntax, the bourgeois of the town is favored above his rural neighbors.\r\nAccordingly, \"the inhabitants of the country, who depend on the town and\r\nare comprehended in its functions, are treated with a rigor of which it\r\nwould be difficult to form an idea. . . . Town influence is constantly\r\nthrowing the burden on those who are trying to be relieved of it, the\r\nrichest of citizens paying less taille than the most miserable of the\r\npeasant farmers[5253].\" Hence, \"the horror of the taille depopulates the\r\nrural districts, concentrating in the towns all the talents and all the\r\ncapital[5254].\" Outside of the towns there is the same differences. Each\r\nyear, the élus and their collectors, exercising arbitrary power, fix\r\nthe taille of the parish and of each inhabitant. In these ignorant and\r\npartial hands the scales are not held by equity but by self-interest,\r\nlocal hatreds, the desire for revenge, the necessity of favoring some\r\nfriend, relative, neighbor, protector, or patron, some powerful or some\r\ndangerous person. The intendant of Moulins, on visiting his generalship,\r\nfinds \"people of influence paying nothing, while the poor are\r\nover-charged.\" That of Dijon writes that \"the basis of apportionment is\r\narbitrary, to such an extent that the people of the province must not be\r\nallowed to suffer any longer.\"[5255] In the generalship of Rouen\r\n\"some parishes pay over four sous the livre and others scarcely one\r\nsou.\"[5256] \"For three years past that I have lived in the country,\"\r\nwrites a lady of the same district, \"I have remarked that most of the\r\nwealthy proprietors are the least pressed; they are selected to make the\r\napportionment, and the people are always abused.\"[5257]--\"I live on an\r\nestate ten leagues from Paris,\" wrote d'Argenson, \"where it was desired\r\nto assess the taille proportionately, but only injustice has been the\r\noutcome since the seigniors made use of their influence to relieve their\r\nown tenants.\" [5258] Besides, in addition to those who, through favor,\r\ndiminish their taille, there are others who buy themselves off entirely.\r\nAn intendant, visiting the subdelegation of Bar-sur-Seine, observes\"\r\nthat the rich cultivators succeed in obtaining petty commissions in\r\nconnection with the king's household and enjoy the privileges attached\r\nto these, which throws the burden of taxation on the others.\"[5259] \"One\r\nof the leading causes of our prodigious taxation,\" says the provincial\r\nassembly of Auvergne, \"is the inconceivable number of the privileged,\r\nwhich daily increases through traffic in and the assignment of offices;\r\ncases occur in which these have ennobled six families in less than\r\ntwenty years.\" Should this abuse continue, \"in a hundred years\r\nevery tax-payer the most capable of supporting taxation will be\r\nennobled.\"[5260] Observe, moreover, that an infinity of offices and\r\nfunctions, without conferring nobility, exempt their titularies from\r\nthe personal taille and reduce their poll-tax to the fortieth of their\r\nincome; at first, all public functionaries, administrative or judicial,\r\nand next all employments in the salt-department, in the customs, in the\r\npost-office, in the royal domains, and in the excise.[5261] \"There are\r\nfew parishes,\" writes an intendant, \"in which these employees are\r\nnot found, while several contain as many as two or three.\"[5262]\r\nA postmaster is exempt from the taille, in all his possessions and\r\noffices, and even on his farms to the extent of a hundred arpents. The\r\nnotaries of Angoulême are exempt from the corvée, from collections, and\r\nthe lodging of soldiers, while neither their sons or chief clerks can\r\nbe drafted in the militia. On closely examining the great fiscal net\r\nin administrative correspondence, we detect at every step some meshes\r\nthrough which, with a bit of effort and cunning, all the big and\r\naverage-sized fish escape; the small fry alone remain at the bottom of\r\nthe scoop. A surgeon not an apothecary, a man of good family forty-five\r\nyears old, in commerce, but living with his parent and in a province\r\nwith a written code, escapes the collector. The same immunity is\r\nextended to the begging agents of the monks of \"la Merci\" and \"L'Etroite\r\nObservance.\" Throughout the South and the East individuals in easy\r\ncircumstances purchase this commission of beggar for a \"louis,\" or for\r\nten crowns, and, putting three livres in a cup, go about presenting it\r\nin this or that parish:[5263] ten of the inhabitants of a small mountain\r\nvillage and five inhabitants in the little village of Treignac obtain\r\ntheir discharge in this fashion. Consequently, \"the collections fall\r\non the poor, always powerless and often insolvent,\" the privileged\r\nwho effect the ruin of the tax-payer causing the deficiencies of the\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Municipal Taxation.\r\n\r\n     The octrois of towns.--The poor the greatest sufferers.\r\n\r\nOne word more to complete the picture. People seek shelter in the towns\r\nand, indeed, compared with the country, the towns are a refuge. But\r\nmisery accompanies the poor, for, on the one hand, they are involved\r\nin debt, and, on the other, the closed circles administering municipal\r\naffairs impose taxation on the poor. The towns being oppressed by the\r\nfisc, they in their turn oppress the people by passing to them the load\r\nwhich the king had imposed. Seven times in twenty-eight years[5264] he\r\nwithdraws and re-sells the right of appointing their municipal officers,\r\nand, to get rid of \"this enormous financial burden,\" the towns double\r\ntheir octrois. At present, although liberated, they still make payment;\r\nthe annual charge has become a perpetual charge; never does the fisc\r\nrelease its hold; once beginning to suck it continues to suck. \"Hence,\r\nin Brittany,\" says an intendant, \"not a town is there whose expenses\r\nare not greater than its revenue.\"[5265] They are unable to mend their\r\npavements, and repair their streets, \"the approaches to them being\r\nalmost impracticable.\" What could they do for self-support, obliged, as\r\nthey are, to pay over again after having already paid? Their augmented\r\noctrois, in 1748, ought to furnish during a period of eleven years a\r\ntotal of 606,000 livres; but, the eleven years having lapsed, the\r\ntax authorities, in spite of having been paid, still maintains its\r\nexigencies, and to such an extent that, in 1774, they have contributed\r\n2,071,052 livres, the provisional octroi being still maintained.--Now,\r\nthis exorbitant octroi bears heavily everywhere on the most\r\nindispensable necessities, the artisan being more heavily burdened than\r\nthe bourgeois. In Paris, as we have seen above, wine pays forty-seven\r\nlivres a hogshead entrance duty which, at the present standard of value,\r\nmust be doubled. \"A turbot, taken on the coast at Harfleur and brought\r\nby post, pays an entrance duty of eleven times its value, the people\r\nof the capital therefore being condemned to dispense with fish from\r\nthe sea.\"[5266] At the gates of Paris, in the little parish of\r\nAubervilliers, I find \"excessive duties on hay, straw, seeds, tallow,\r\ncandles, eggs, sugar, fish, faggots and firewood.\"[5267] Compiegne\r\npays the whole amount of its taille by means of a tax on beverages and\r\ncattle[5268]. \"In Toul and in Verdun the taxes are so onerous that but\r\nfew consent to remain in the town, except those kept there by their\r\noffices and by old habits.\"[5269] At Coulommiers, \"the merchants and\r\nthe people are so severely taxed they dread undertaking any enterprise.\"\r\nPopular hatred everywhere is profound against octroi, barrier and clerk.\r\nThe bourgeois oligarchy everywhere first cares for itself before caring\r\nfor those it governs. At Nevers and at Moulins,[5270] \"all rich persons\r\nfind means to escape their turn to collect taxes by belonging to\r\ndifferent commissions or through their influence with the élus, to such\r\nan extent that the collectors of Nevers, of the present and preceding\r\nyear, might be mistaken for real beggars; there is hardly any small\r\nvillage whose tax collectors are solvent, since the tenant farmers\r\n(métayers) have had to be appointed.\" At Angers, \"independent of\r\npresents and candles, which annually consume 2,172 livres, the public\r\npence are employed and wasted in clandestine outlays according to the\r\nfancy of the municipal officers.\" In Provence, where the communities\r\nare free to tax themselves and where they might be expected to show\r\nsome consideration for the poor, \"most of the towns, and notably Aix,\r\nMarseilles and Toulon,[5271] pay their impositions,\" local and general,\r\n\"exclusively by the tax called the \"piquet.\" This is a tax \"on all\r\nspecies of flour belonging to and consumed on the territory;\" for\r\nexample, of 254,897 livres, which Toulon expends, the piquet furnishes\r\n233,405. Thus the taxation falls wholly on the people, while the bishop,\r\nthe marquis, the president, the merchant of importance pay less on their\r\ndinner of delicate fish and becaficos than the caulker or porter on his\r\ntwo pounds of bread rubbed with a piece of garlic! Bread in this country\r\nis already too dear! And the quality is so poor that Malouet, the\r\nintendant of the marine, refuses to let his workmen eat it!\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said M. de la Fare, bishop of Nancy, from his pulpit, May 4th,\r\n1789, \"Sire, the people over which you reign has given unmistakable\r\nproofs of its patience. . . . They are martyrs in whom life seems to\r\nhave been allowed to remain to enable them to suffer the longer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Complaints In The Registers [5272].\r\n\r\n\"I am miserable because too much is taken from me. Too much is taken\r\nfrom me because not enough is taken from the privileged. Not only do the\r\nprivileged force me to pay in their place, but, again, they previously\r\ndeduct from my earnings their ecclesiastic and feudal dues. When, out\r\nof my income of 100 francs, I have parted with fifty-three francs, and\r\nmore, to the collector, I am obliged again to give fourteen francs to\r\nthe seignior, also more than fourteen for tithes,[5273] and, out of the\r\nremaining eighteen or nineteen francs, I have additionally to satisfy\r\nthe excise men. I alone, a poor man, pay two governments, one the old\r\ngovernment, local and now absent, useless, inconvenient and humiliating,\r\nand active only through annoyances, exemptions and taxes; and the other,\r\nrecent, centralized, everywhere present, which, taking upon itself all\r\nfunctions, has vast needs, and makes my meager shoulders support its\r\nenormous weight.\"\r\n\r\nThese, in precise terms, are the vague ideas beginning to ferment in\r\nthe popular brain and encountered on every page of the records of the\r\nStates-General.\r\n\r\n\"Would to God,\" says a Normandy village,[5274] \"the monarch might take\r\ninto his own hands the defense of the miserable citizen pelted and\r\noppressed by clerks, seigniors, justiciary and clergy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" writes a village in Champagne,[5275] \"the only message to us on\r\nyour part is a demand for money. We were led to believe that this might\r\ncease, but every year the demand comes for more. We do not hold you\r\nresponsible for this because we love you, but those whom you employ, who\r\nbetter know how to manage their own affairs than yours. We believed that\r\nyou were deceived by them and we, in our chagrin, said to ourselves,\r\nIf our good king only knew of this!. . . We are crushed down with every\r\nspecies of taxation; thus far we have given you a part of our bread,\r\nand, should this continue, we shall be in want. . . . Could you see the\r\nmiserable tenements in which we live, the poor food we eat, you would\r\nfeel for us; this would prove to you better than words that we can\r\nsupport this no longer and that it must be lessened. . . . That which\r\ngrieves us is that those who possess the most, pay the least. We pay the\r\ntailles and for our implements, while the ecclesiastics and nobles who\r\nown the best land pay nothing. Why do the rich pay the least and the\r\npoor the most? Should not each pay according to his ability? Sire, we\r\nentreat that things may be so arranged, for that is just. . . . Did we\r\ndare, we should undertake to plant the slopes with vines; but we are\r\nso persecuted by the clerks of the excise we would rather pull up those\r\nalready planted; the wine that we could make would all go to them,\r\nscarcely any of it remaining for ourselves. These exactions are a great\r\nscourge and, to escape them, we would rather let the ground lie waste.\r\n. . . Relieve us of all these extortions and of the excisemen; we are\r\ngreat sufferers through all these devices; now is the time to change\r\nthem; never shall we be happy as long as these last. We entreat all\r\nthis of you, Sire, along with others of your subjects as wearied as\r\nourselves. . . . We would entreat yet more but you cannot do all at one\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nImposts and privileges, in the really popular registers, are the two\r\nenemies against which complaints everywhere arise[5276].\r\n\r\n\"We are overwhelmed by demands for subsidies,. . . we are burdened with\r\ntaxes beyond our strength,. . . we do not feel able to support any more,\r\nwe perish, overpowered by the sacrifices demanded of us. Labor is taxed\r\nwhile indolence is exempt. . . . Feudalism is the most disastrous of\r\nabuses, the evils it causes surpassing those of hail and lightning. . . .\r\nSubsistence is impossible if three-quarters of the crops are to be\r\ntaken for field-rents, terrage, etc. . . . The proprietor has a fourth\r\npart, the décimateur a twelfth, the harvester a twelfth, taxation a\r\ntenth, not counting the depredations of vast quantities of game which\r\ndevour the growing crops: nothing is left for the poor cultivator but\r\npain and sorrow.\"\r\n\r\nWhy should the Third-Estate alone pay for roads on which the nobles and\r\nthe clergy drive in their carriages? Why are the poor alone subject to\r\nmilitia draft? Why does \"the subdelegate cause only the defenseless and\r\nthe unprotected to be drafted?\" Why does it suffice to be the servant\r\nof a privileged person to escape this service? Destroy those dove-cotes,\r\nformerly only small pigeon-pens and which now contain as many as 5,000\r\npairs. Abolish the barbarous rights of \"motte, quevaise and domaine\r\ncongéable[5277] under which more than 500,000 persons still suffer\r\nin Lower Brittany.\" \"You have in your armies, Sire, more than 30,000\r\nFranche-Comté serfs;\" should one of these become an officer and be\r\npensioned out of the service he would be obliged to return to and live\r\nin the hut in which he was born, otherwise; at his death, the seignior\r\nwill take his pittance. Let there be no more absentee prelates, nor\r\nabbés-commendatory. \"The present deficit is not to be paid by us but\r\nby the bishops and beneficiaries; deprive the princes of the church of\r\ntwo-thirds of their revenues.\" \"Let feudalism be abolished. Man, the\r\npeasant especially, is tyrannically bowed down to the impoverished\r\nground on which he lies exhausted. . . . There is no freedom, no\r\nprosperity, no happiness where the soil is enthralled. . . . Let the\r\nlord's dues, and other odious taxes not feudal, be abolished, a thousand\r\ntimes returned to the privileged. Let feudalism content itself with\r\nits iron scepter without adding the poniard of the revenue\r\nspeculator.\"[5278]\r\n\r\nHere, and for some time before this, it is not the Countryman who speaks\r\nbut the procureur, the lawyer, who places professional metaphors and\r\ntheories at his service. But the lawyer has simply translated the\r\ncountryman's sentiments into literary dialect.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5201: \"Collection des économistes,\" II. 832.

INTELLECTUAL STATE OF THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n     Intellectual incapacity.--How ideas are transformed into\r\n     marvelous stories.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend their actions we ought now to look into the condition of\r\ntheir minds, to know the current train of their ideas, their mode of\r\nthinking. But is it really essential to draw this portrait, and are not\r\nthe details of their mental condition we have just presented sufficient?\r\nWe shall obtain a knowledge of them later, and through their actions,\r\nwhen, in Touraine, they knock a mayor and his assistant, chosen by\r\nthemselves, senseless with kicks from their wooden shoes, because, in\r\nobeying the national Assembly, these two unfortunate men prepared a\r\ntable of taxes; or when at Troyes, they drag through the streets and\r\ntear to pieces the venerable magistrate who was nourishing them at\r\nthat very moment, and who had just dictated his testament in their\r\nfavor. Take the still rude brain of a contemporary peasant and deprive\r\nit of the ideas which, for eighty years past, have entered it by so many\r\nchannels, through the primary school of each village, through the return\r\nhome of the conscript after seven years' service, through the prodigious\r\nmultiplication of books, newspapers, roads, railroads, foreign travel\r\nand every other species of communication.[5301] Try to imagine the\r\npeasant of the eighteenth century, penned and shut up from father to\r\nson in his hamlet, without parish highways, deprived of news, with no\r\ninstruction but the Sunday sermon, continuously worrying about his daily\r\nbread and the taxes, \"with his wretched, dried-up aspect,\"[5302] not\r\ndaring to repair his house, always persecuted, distrustful, his mind\r\ncontracted and stinted, so to say, by misery. His condition is almost\r\nthat of his ox or his ass, while his ideas are those of his condition.\r\nHe has been a long time stolid; \"he lacks even instinct,\"[5303]\r\nmechanically and fixedly regarding the ground on which he drags along\r\nhis hereditary plow. In 1751, d'Argenson wrote in his journal:\r\n\r\n\"nothing in the news from the court affects them; the reign is\r\nindifferent to them. . . . . the distance between the capital and the\r\nprovince daily widens. . . . Here they are ignorant of the striking\r\noccurrences that most impressed us at Paris. . . .The inhabitants of the\r\ncountry side are merely poverty-stricken slaves, draft cattle under a\r\nyoke, moving on as they are goaded, caring for nothing and embarrassed\r\nby nothing, provided they can eat and sleep at regular hours.\"\r\n\r\nThey make no complaints, \"they do not even dream of complaining;\"[5304]\r\ntheir wretchedness seems to them natural like winter or hail. Their\r\nminds, like their agriculture, still belong to the middle ages. In the\r\nenvironment of Toulouse,[5305] to ascertain who committed a robbery, to\r\ncure a man or a sick animal, they resort to a sorcerer, who divines this\r\nby means of a sieve. The countryman fully believes in ghosts and, on\r\nAll Saints' eve, he lays the cloth for the dead.--In Auvergne, at the\r\noutbreak the Revolution, on a contagious fever making its appearance,\r\nM. de Montlosier, declared to be a sorcerer, is the cause of it, and two\r\nhundred men assemble together to demolish his dwelling. Their religious\r\nbelief is on the same level.[5306] \"Their priests drink with them\r\nand sell them absolution. On Sundays, at the sermon, they put up\r\nlieutenancies and sub-lieutenancies (among the saints) for sale: so much\r\nfor a lieutenant's place under St. Peter!--If the peasant hesitates in\r\nhis bid, an eulogy of St. Peter at once begins, and then our peasants\r\nrun it up fast enough.\"--To intellects in a primitive state, barren of\r\nideas and crowded with images, idols on earth are as essential as idols\r\nin heaven. \"No doubt whatever existed in my mind,\" says Rétit de la\r\nBretonne,[5307] \"of the power of the king to compel any man to bestow\r\nhis wife or daughter on me, and my village (Sacy, in Burgundy) thought\r\nas I did.\"[5308] There is no room in minds of this description for\r\nabstract conceptions, for any idea of social order; they are submissive\r\nto it and that is all. \"The mass of the people,\" writes Governor in\r\n1789, \"have no religion but that of their priests, no law but that of\r\nthose above them, no morality but that of self-interest; these are\r\nthe beings who, led on by drunken curates, are now on the high road\r\nto liberty, and the first use they make of it is to rebel on all sides\r\nbecause there is dearth.\"[5309]\r\n\r\nHow could things be otherwise? Every idea, previous to taking root in\r\ntheir brain, must possess a legendary form, as absurd as it is simple,\r\nadapted to their experiences, their faculties, their fears and their\r\naspirations. Once planted in this uncultivated and fertile soil it\r\nvegetates and becomes transformed, developing into gross excrescences,\r\nsomber foliage and poisonous fruit. The more monstrous the greater its\r\nvigor, clinging to the slightest of probabilities and tenacious against\r\nthe most certain of demonstrations. Under Louis XV, in an arrest of\r\nvagabonds, a few children having been carried off willfully or by\r\nmistake, the rumor spreads that the king takes baths in blood to restore\r\nhis exhausted functions, and, so true does this seem to be, the\r\nwomen, horrified through their maternal instincts, join in the riot; a\r\npoliceman is seized and knocked down, and, on his demanding a confessor,\r\na woman in the crowd, picking up a stone, cries out that he must not\r\nhave time to go to heaven, and smashes his head with it, believing that\r\nshe is performing an act of justice[5310]. Under Louis XVI evidence is\r\npresented to the people that there is no scarcity: in 1789, [5311] an\r\nofficer, listening to the conversation of his soldiers, hears them state\r\n\"with full belief that the princes and courtiers, with a view to\r\nstarve Paris out, are throwing flour into the Seine.\" Turning to a\r\nquarter-master he asks him how he can possibly believe such an absurd\r\nstory. \"Lieutenant,\" he replies, \"'tis time--the bags were tied with\r\nblue strings (cordons bleus).\" To them this is a sufficient reason, and\r\nno argument could convince them to the contrary. Thus, among the dregs\r\nof society, foul and horrible romances are forged, in connection\r\nthe famine and the Bastille, in which Louis XVI., the queen Marie\r\nAntoinette, the Comte d'Artois, Madame de Lamballe, the Polignacs, the\r\nrevenue farmers, the seigniors and ladies of high rank are portrayed as\r\nvampires and ghouls. I have seen many editions of these in the pamphlets\r\nof the day, in the engravings not exhibited, and among popular prints\r\nand illustrations, the latter the most effective, since they appeal to\r\nthe eye. They surpass the stories of Mandrin[5312] and Cartouche,\r\nbeing exactly suitable for men whose literature consists of the popular\r\nlaments of Mandrin and Cartouche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n     Political incapacity.--Interpretation of political rumors\r\n     and of government action.\r\n\r\nBy this we can judge of their political intelligence. Every object\r\nappears to them in a false light; they are like children who, at each\r\nturn of the road, see in each tree or bush some frightful hobgoblin.\r\nArthur Young, on visiting the springs near Clermont, is arrested,[5313]\r\nand the people want to imprison a woman, his guide, some of the\r\nbystanders regarding him as an \"agent of the Queen, who intended to blow\r\nthe town up with a mine, and send all that escaped to the galleys.\"\r\nSix days after this, beyond Puy, and notwithstanding his passport, the\r\nvillage guard come and take him out of bed at eleven o'clock at nights,\r\ndeclaring that \"I was undoubtedly a conspirator with the Queen, the\r\nCount d'Artois and the Count d'Entragues (who has property here), who\r\nhad employed me as arpenteur to measure their fields in order to double\r\ntheir taxes.\" We here take the unconscious, apprehensive, popular\r\nimagination in the act; a slight indication, a word, prompting the\r\nconstruction of either air castles or fantastic dungeons, and seeing\r\nthese as plainly as if they were so many substantial realities. They\r\nhave not the inward resources that render capable of separating and\r\ndiscerning; their conceptions are formed in a lump; both object and\r\nfancy appear together and are united in one single perception. At the\r\nmoment of electing deputies the report is current in Province[5314] that\r\n\"the best of kings desires perfect equality, that there are to be no\r\nmore bishops, nor seigniors, nor tithes, nor seigniorial dues, no more\r\ntithes or distinctions, no more hunting or fishing rights,. . . that\r\nthe people are to be wholly relieved of taxation, and that the first two\r\norders alone are to provide the expenses of the government.\" Whereupon\r\nforty or fifty riots take place in one day. \"Several communities refuse\r\nto make any payments to their treasurer outside of royal requisitions.\"\r\nOthers do better: \"on pillaging the strong-box of the receiver of the\r\ntax on leather at Brignolles, they shout out Vive le Roi!\" \"The peasant\r\nconstantly asserts his pillage and destruction to be in conformity with\r\nthe king's will.\" A little later, in Auvergne, the peasants who burn\r\ncastles are to display \"much repugnance\" in thus maltreating \"such kind\r\nseigniors,\" but they allege \"imperative orders, having been advised that\r\nthe king wished it.\"[5315] At Lyons, when the tapsters of the town and\r\nthe peasants of the neighborhood trample the customs officials underfoot\r\nthey believe that the king has suspended all customs dues for three\r\ndays.[5316] The scope of their imagination is proportionate to their\r\nshortsightedness. \"Bread, no more rents, no more taxes!\" is the sole\r\ncry, the cry of want, while exasperated want plunges ahead like a\r\nfamished bull. Down with the monopolist!--storehouses are forced open,\r\nconvoys of grain are stopped, markets are pillaged, bakers are hung, and\r\nthe price of bread is fixed so that none is to be had or is concealed.\r\nDown with the octroi!--barriers are demolished, clerks are beaten,\r\nmoney is wanting in the towns for urgent expenses. Burn tax registries,\r\naccount-books, municipal archives, seigniors' charter-safes, convent\r\nparchments, every detestable document creative of debtors and sufferers!\r\nThe village itself is no longer able to preserve its parish property.\r\nThe rage against any written document, against public officers, against\r\nany man more or less connected with grain, is blind and determined.\r\nThe furious animal destroys all, although wounding himself, driving and\r\nroaring against the obstacle that ought to be outflanked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n     Destructive impulses.--The object of blind rage.--Distrust\r\n     of natural leaders.--Suspicion of them changed into hatred.\r\n    --Disposition of the people in 1789.\r\n\r\nThis owing to the absence of leaders and in the absence of organization,\r\na mob is simply a herd. Its mistrust of its natural leaders, of the\r\ngreat, of the wealthy, of persons in office and clothed with authority,\r\nis inveterate and incurable. Vainly do these wish it well and do it\r\ngood; it has no faith in their humanity or disinterestedness. It has\r\nbeen too down-trodden; it entertains prejudices against every measure\r\nproceeding from them, even the most liberal and the most beneficial. \"At\r\nthe mere mention of the new assemblies,\" says a provincial commission in\r\n1787,[5317] \"we heard a workman exclaim, 'What, more new extortioners!'\"\r\nSuperiors of every kind are suspected, and from suspicion to\r\nhostility the road is not long. In 1788[5318] Mercier declares that\r\n\"insubordination has been manifest for some years, especially among the\r\ntrades. . . . Formerly, on entering a printing-office the men took off\r\ntheir hats. Now they content themselves with staring and leering at\r\nyou; scarcely have you crossed threshold when you yourself more lightly\r\nspoken of than if you were one of them.\" The same attitude is taken by\r\nthe peasants in the environment of Paris; Madame Vigée-Lebrun,[5319] on\r\ngoing to Romainville to visit Marshal de Ségur, remarks: \"Not only do\r\nthey not remove their hats but they regard us insolently; some of them\r\neven threatened us with clubs.\" In March and April following this, her\r\nguests arrive at her concert in consternation. \"In the morning, at\r\nthe promenade of Longchamps, the populace, assembled at the barrier of\r\nl'Etoile, insulted the people passing by in carriages in the grossest\r\nmanner; some of the wretches on the footsteps exclaiming: 'Next year you\r\nshall be behind the carriage and we inside.'\" At the close of the\r\nyear 1788, the stream becomes a torrent and the torrent a cataract.\r\nAn intendant[5320] writes that, in his province, the government must\r\ndecide, and in the popular sense, to separate from privileged classes,\r\nabandon old forms and give the Third-Estate a double vote. The clergy\r\nand the nobles are detested, and their supremacy is a yoke. \"Last July,\"\r\nhe says, \"the old States-General would have been received with pleasure\r\nand there would have been few obstacles to its formation. During the\r\npast five months minds have become enlightened; respective interests\r\nhave been discussed, and leagues formed. You have been kept in ignorance\r\nof the fermentation which is at its height among all classes of the\r\nThird-Estate, and a spark will kindle the conflagration. If the\r\nking's decision should be favorable to the first two orders a general\r\ninsurrection will occur throughout the provinces, 600,000 men in arms\r\nand the horrors of the Jacquerie.\" The word is spoken and the reality is\r\ncoming. An insurrectionary multitude rejecting its natural leaders\r\nmust elect or submit to others. It is like an army which, entering on\r\na campaign, finding itself without officers; the vacancies are for the\r\nboldest, most violent, those most oppressed by the previous rule, and\r\nwho, leading the advance, shouting \"forward\" and thus form the leading\r\ngroups. In 1789, the bands are ready; for, below the suffering people\r\nthere is yet another people which suffers yet more, whose insurrection\r\nis permanent, and which, repressed, persecuted, and obscure, only awaits\r\nan opportunity to come out of its hiding-place and openly give their\r\npassions free vent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n     Insurrectionary leaders and recruits.--Poachers.--Smugglers\r\n     and dealers in contraband salt.--Bandits.--Beggars and\r\n     vagabonds.--Advent of brigands.--The people of Paris.\r\n\r\nVagrants, recalcitrants of all kinds, fugitives of the law or the\r\npolice, beggars, cripples, foul, filthy, haggard and savage, they are\r\nbred by the social injustice of the system, and around every one of\r\nthe social wounds these swarm like vermin.--Four hundred captaincies\r\nprotects vast quantities of game feeding on the crops under the eyes of\r\nowners of the land, transforming these into thousands of poachers, the\r\nmore dangerous since they are armed, and defy the most terrible laws.\r\nAlready in 1752[5321] are seen around Paris \"gatherings of fifty or\r\nsixty, all fully armed and acting as if on regular foraging campaigns,\r\nwith the infantry at the center and the cavalry on the wings. . . . They\r\nlive in the forests where they have created a fortified and guarded area\r\nand paying exactly for what they take to live on.\" In 1777[5322], at\r\nSens in Burgundy, the public attorney, M. Terray, hunting on his own\r\nproperty with two officers, meets a gang of poachers who fire on the\r\ngame under their eyes, and soon afterwards fire on them. Terray is\r\nwounded and one of the officers has his coat pierced; guards arrive, but\r\nthe poachers stand firm and repel them; dragoons are sent for and the\r\npoachers kill of these, along with three horses, and are attacked\r\nwith sabers; four of them are brought to the ground and seven are\r\ncaptured. Reports of the States-General show that every year, in each\r\nextensive forest, murders occur, sometimes at the hands of a poacher,\r\nand again, and the most frequently, by the shot of a gamekeeper.--It is\r\na continuous warfare at home; every vast domain thus harbors its rebels,\r\nprovided with powder and ball and knowing how to use them.\r\n\r\nOther recruits for rioting are found among smugglers and in dealers in\r\ncontraband salt[5323]. A tax, as soon as it becomes exorbitant, invites\r\nfraud, and raises up a population of delinquents against its army of\r\nclerks. The number of such defrauders may be seen when we consider the\r\nnumber of custom officers: twelve hundred leagues of interior custom\r\ndistricts are guarded by 50,000 men, of which 23,000 are soldiers in\r\ncivilian dress[5324]. \"In the principal provinces of the salt-tax and\r\nin the provinces of the five great tax leasing administrations (fermes),\r\nfor four leagues (ten miles) on either side of the prohibited line,\"\r\ncultivation is abandoned; everybody is either a customs official or\r\na smuggler[5325]. The more excessive the tax the higher the premium\r\noffered to the violators of the law; at every place on the boundaries of\r\nBrittany with Normandy, Maine and Anjou, four pence per pound added\r\nto the salt-tax multiplies beyond any conception the already enormous\r\nnumber of contraband dealers. \"Numerous bands of men,[5326] armed with\r\nfrettes, or long sticks pointed with iron, and often with pistols or\r\nguns, attempt to force a passage. \"A multitude of women and of children,\r\nquite young, cross the brigades boundaries or, on the other side, troops\r\nof dogs are brought there, kept closed up for a certain time without\r\nfood or drink, then loaded with salt and now turned loose so that\r\nthey, driven by hunger, immediately bring their cargo back to their\r\nmasters.\"--Vagabonds, outlaws, the famished, sniff this lucrative\r\noccupation from afar and run to it like so many packs of hounds. \"The\r\noutskirts of Brittany are filled with a population of emigrants, mostly\r\noutcast from their own districts, who, after a year's registered stay,\r\nmay enjoy the privileges of the Bretons: their occupation is limited to\r\ncollecting piles of salt to re-sell to the contraband dealers.\" We might\r\nimagine them, as in a flash of lightening, as a long line of restless\r\nnomads, nocturnal and pursued, an entire tribe, male and female, of\r\nunsociable prowlers, familiar with to underhand tricks, toughened by\r\nhard weather, ragged, \"nearly all infected by persistent scabies,\" and I\r\nfind similar bodies in the vicinity of Morlaix, Lorient, and other ports\r\non the frontiers of other provinces and on the frontiers of the kingdom.\r\nFrom 1783 to 1787, in Quercy, two allied bands of smugglers, sixty and\r\neighty each, defraud the revenue of 40,000 of tobacco, kill two customs\r\nofficers, and, with their guns, defend their stores in the mountains; to\r\nsuppress them soldiers are needed, which their military commander\r\nwill not furnish. In 1789,[5327] a large troop of smugglers carry on\r\noperations permanently on the frontiers of Maine and Anjou; the military\r\ncommander writes that \"their chief is an intelligent and formidable\r\nbandit, who already has under him fifty-five men, he will, due to misery\r\nand rebellion soon have a corps;\" it would, as we are unable to take him\r\nby force, be best, if some of his men could be turned and made to\r\nhand him over to us. These are the means resorted to in regions where\r\nbrigandage is endemic.--Here, indeed, as in Calabria, the people are on\r\nthe side of the brigands against the gendarmes. The exploits of Mandrin\r\nin 1754,[5328] may be remembered: his company of sixty men who bring\r\nin contraband goods and ransom only the clerks, his expedition, lasting\r\nnearly a year, across Franche-Comté, Lyonnais, Bourbonnais, Auvergne\r\nand Burgundy, the twenty-seven towns he enters making no resistance,\r\ndelivering prisoners and making sale of his merchandise. To overcome him\r\na camp had to be formed at Valance and 2,000 men sent against him;\r\nhe was taken through treachery, and still at the present day certain\r\nfamilies are proud of their relationship to him, declaring him a\r\nliberator.--No symptom is more alarming: on the enemies of the law being\r\npreferred by the people to its defenders, society disintegrates and the\r\nworms begin to work.--Add to these the veritable brigands, assassins and\r\nrobbers. \"In 1782,[5329] the provost's court of Montargis is engaged\r\non the trial of Hulin and two hundred of his accomplices who, for ten\r\nyears, by means of joint enterprises, have desolated a portion of the\r\nkingdom.\"--Mercier enumerates in France \"an army of more than 10,000\r\nbrigands and vagabonds\" against which the police, composed of 3,756 men,\r\nis always on the march. \"Complaints are daily made,\" says the provincial\r\nassembly of Haute-Guyenne, \"that there is no police in the country.\"\r\nThe absentee seignior pays no attention to this matter; his judges\r\nand officials take good care not to operate gratuitously against an\r\ninsolvent criminal, the result is that \"his estates become the refuge of\r\nall the rascals of the area.\"[5330]--Every abuse thus carries with it a\r\nrisk, both due to misplaced carelessness as well as excessive rigor,\r\nto relaxed feudalism as well as to harsh monarchy. All the institutions\r\nappear to work together to breed and or tolerate the troublemakers,\r\npreparing, outside the social defenses, the men of action who will carry\r\nit by storm.\r\n\r\nBut the total effect of all this is yet more damaging, for, out of the\r\nvast numbers of workers it ruins it forms beggars unwilling to work,\r\ndangerous sluggards going about begging and extorting bread from\r\npeasants who have not too much for themselves. \"The vagabonds about the\r\ncountry,\" says Letrosne,[5331] \"are a terrible pest; they are like an\r\nenemy's force which, distributed over the territory, obtains a living as\r\nit pleases, levying veritable contributions. . . . They are constantly\r\nroving around the country, examining the approaches to houses, and\r\ninforming themselves about their inmates and of their habits.--Woe to\r\nthose supposed to have money!. . . What numbers of highway robberies and\r\nwhat burglaries! What numbers of travelers assassinated, and houses and\r\ndoors broken into! What assassinations of curates, farmers and widows,\r\ntormented to discover money and afterwards killed! Twenty-five years\r\nanterior (page 384/284) to the Revolution it was not infrequent to\r\nsee fifteen or twenty of these \"invade a farm-house to sleep there,\r\nintimidating the farmers and exacting whatever they pleased.\" In 1764,\r\nthe government takes measures against them which indicate the magnitude\r\nof the evil[5332].\r\n\r\n\"Are held to be vagabonds and vagrants, and condemned as such, those\r\nwho, for a preceding term of six months, shall have exercised no trade\r\nor profession, and who, having no occupation or means of subsistence,\r\ncan procure no persons worthy of confidence to attest and verify their\r\nhabits and mode of life. . . . The intent of His Majesty is not merely\r\nto arrest vagabonds traversing the country but, again, all mendicants\r\nwhatsoever who, without occupations, may be regarded as suspected of\r\nvagabondage.\"\r\n\r\nThe penalty for able-bodied men is three years in the galleys; in case\r\nof a second conviction, nine years; and for a third, imprisonment for\r\nlife. Under the age of sixteen, they are put in an institution. \"A\r\nmendicant who has made himself liable to arrest by the police,\" says\r\nthe circular, \"is not to be released except under the most positive\r\nassurance that he will no longer beg; this course will be followed only\r\nin case of persons worthy of confidence and solvent guaranteeing the\r\nmendicant, and engaging to provide him with employment or to support\r\nhim, and they shall indicate the means by which they are to prevent him\r\nfrom begging.\" This being furnished, the special authorization of the\r\nintendant must be obtained in addition. By virtue of this law, 50,000\r\nbeggars are said to have been arrested at once, and, as the ordinary\r\nhospitals and prisons were not large enough to contain them, jails had\r\nto be constructed. Up to the end of the ancient régime this measure\r\nis carried out with occasional intermissions: in Languedoc, in 1768,\r\narrests were still made of 433 in six months, and, in 1785, 205 in four\r\nmonths[5333]. A little before this time 300 were confined in the depot\r\nof Besançon, 500 in that of Rennes and 650 in that of Saint Denis. It\r\ncost the king a million a year to support them, and God knows how they\r\nwere bedded and fed! Water, straw, bread, and two ounces of salted\r\ngrease, the whole at an expense of five sous a day; and, as the price\r\nof provisions for twenty years back had increased more than a third,\r\nthe keeper who had them in charge was obliged to make them fast or ruin\r\nhimself.--With respect to the mode of filling the depots, the police are\r\nTurks in their treatment of the lower class; they strike into the\r\nheap, their broom bruising as many as they sweep out. According to the\r\nordinance of 1778, writes an intendant,[5334] \"the police must arrest\r\nnot only beggars and vagabonds whom they encounter but, again, those\r\ndenounced as such or as suspected persons. The citizen, the most\r\nirreproachable in his conduct and the least open to suspicion of\r\nvagabondage, is not sure of not being shut up in the depot, as his\r\nfreedom depends on a policeman who is constantly liable to be deceived\r\nby a false denunciation or corrupted by a bribe. I have seen in the\r\ndepot at Rennes several husbands arrested solely through the\r\ndenunciation of their wives, and as many women through that of their\r\nhusbands; several children by the first wife at the solicitation of\r\ntheir step-mothers; many female domestics pregnant by the masters they\r\nserved, shut up at their instigation, and girls in the same situation at\r\nthe instance of their seducers; children denounced by their fathers, and\r\nfathers denounced by their children; all without the slightest evidence\r\nof vagabondage or mendicity. . . . No decision of the provost's court\r\nexists restoring the incarcerated to their liberty, notwithstanding the\r\ninfinite number arrested unjustly.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose that a human intendant, like this one, sets them at liberty:\r\nthere they are in the streets, without a penny, beggars through the\r\naction of a law which proscribes mendicity and which adds to the\r\nwretched it prosecutes the wretched it creates, still more embittered\r\nand corrupt in body and in soul.\r\n\r\n\"It nearly always happens,\" says the same intendant, \"that the\r\nprisoners, arrested twenty-five or thirty leagues from the depot, are\r\nnot confined there until three or four months after their arrest,\r\nand sometimes longer. Meanwhile, they are transferred from brigade to\r\nbrigade, in the prisons found along the road, where they remain until\r\nthe number increases sufficiently to form a convoy. Men and women are\r\nconfined in the same prison, the result of which is, the females not\r\npregnant on entering it are always so on their arrival at the depot.\r\nThe prisons are generally unhealthy; frequently, the majority of the\r\nprisoners are sick on leaving it,\" and many become rascals on coming in\r\ncontact with rascals.--Moral contagion and physical contagion, the\r\nulcer thus increasing through the remedy, centers of repression becoming\r\ncenters of corruption.\r\n\r\nAnd yet with all its rigors the law does not attain its ends.\r\n\r\n\"Our towns,\" says the parliament of Brittany,[5335] \"are so filled with\r\nbeggars it seems as if the measures taken to suppress mendicity only\r\nincrease it.\"--\"The principal highways,\" writes the intendant, \"are\r\ninfested with dangerous vagabonds and vagrants, actual beggars, which\r\nthe police do not arrest, either through negligence or because their\r\ninterference is not provoked by special solicitations.\"\r\n\r\nWhat would be done with them if they were arrested? They are too many,\r\nand there is no place to put them. And, moreover, how prevent people who\r\nlive on alms from demanding alms? The effect, undoubtedly, is lamentable\r\nbut inevitable. Poverty, to a certain extent, is a slow gangrene in\r\nwhich the morbid parts consume the healthy parts, the man scarcely able\r\nto subsist being eaten up alive by the man who has nothing to live on.\r\n\r\n\"The peasant is ruined, perishing, the victim of oppression by the\r\nmultitude of the poor that lay waste the country and take refuge in the\r\ntowns. Hence the mobs so prejudicial to public safety, that crowd of\r\nsmugglers and vagrants, that large body of men who have become robbers\r\nand assassins, solely because they lack bread. This gives but a faint\r\nidea of the disorders I have seen with my own eyes[5336]. The poverty\r\nof the rural districts, excessive in itself, becomes yet more so\r\nthrough the disturbances it engenders; we have not to seek elsewhere for\r\nfrightful sources of mendicity and for all the vices.\"[5337]\r\n\r\nOf what avail are palliatives or violent proceedings against an evil\r\nwhich is in the blood, and which belongs to the very constitution of the\r\nsocial organism? What police force could effect anything in a parish in\r\nwhich one-quarter or one-third of its inhabitants have nothing to\r\neat but that which they beg from door to door? At Argentré,[5338] in\r\nBrittany, \"a town without trade or industry, out of 2,300 inhabitants,\r\nmore than one-half are anything else but well-off, and over 500 are\r\nreduced to beggary.\" At Dainville, in Artois, \"out of 130 houses sixty\r\nare on the poor-list.\"[5339] In Normandy, according to statements made\r\nby the curates, \"of 900 parishioners in Saint-Malo, three-quarters\r\ncan barely live and the rest are in poverty.\" \"Of 1,500 inhabitants in\r\nSaint-Patrice, 400 live on alms.\" Of 500 inhabitants in Saint-Laurent\r\nthree-quarters live on alms.\" At Marboef, says a report, \"of 500 persons\r\ninhabiting our parish, 100 are reduced to mendicity, and besides these,\r\nthirty or forty a day come to us from neighboring parishes.\"[5340]\r\nAt Bolbone in Languedoc[5341] daily at the convent gate is \"general\r\nalmsgiving to 300 or 400 poor people, independent of that for the aged\r\nand the sick, which is more numerously attended.\" At Lyons, in 1787,\r\n\"30,000 workmen depend on public charity for subsistence;\" at Rennes, in\r\n1788, after an inundation, \"two-thirds of the inhabitants are in a state\r\nof destitution;\"[5342] at Paris, out of 650,000 inhabitants, the census\r\nof 1791 counts 118,784 as indigent.[5343]--Let frost or hail come, as\r\nin 1788, let a crop fail, let bread cost four sous a pound, and let a\r\nworkman in the charity-workshops earn only twelve sous a day,[5344] can\r\none imagine that people will resign themselves to death by starvation?\r\nAround Rouen, during the winter of 1788, the forests are pillaged in\r\nopen day, the woods at Baguères are wholly cut away, the fallen trees\r\nare publicly sold by the marauders[5345]. Both the famished and the\r\nmarauders go together, necessity making itself the accomplice of crime.\r\nFrom province to province we can follow up their tracks: four months\r\nlater, in the vicinity of Etampes, fifteen brigands break into\r\nfour farmhouses during the night, while the farmers, threatened by\r\nincendiaries, are obliged to give, one three hundred francs, another\r\nfive hundred, all the money, probably, they have in their coffers[5346].\r\n\"Robbers, convicts, the worthless of every species,\" are to form the\r\nadvance guard of insurrections and lead the peasantry to the extreme\r\nof violence[5347]. After the sack of the Reveillon house in Paris it is\r\nremarked that \"of the forty ringleaders arrested, there was scarcely one\r\nwho was not an old offender, and either flogged or branded.\"[5348] In\r\nevery revolution the dregs of society come to the surface. Never had\r\nthese been visible before; like badgers in the woods, or rats in the\r\nsewers, they had remained in their burrows or in their holes. They issue\r\nfrom these in swarms, and suddenly, in Paris, what figures![5349] \"Never\r\nhad any like them been seen in daylight. . . Where do they come from?\r\nWho has brought them out of their obscure hiding places?. . . strangers\r\nfrom everywhere, armed with clubs, ragged,. . . some almost naked,\r\nothers oddly dressed\" in incongruous patches and \"frightful to look at,\"\r\nconstitute the riotous chiefs or their subordinates, at six francs per\r\nhead, behind which the people are to march.\r\n\r\n\"At Paris,\" says Mercier,[5350] \"the people are weak, pallid,\r\ndiminutive, stunted,\" maltreated, \"and, apparently, a class apart\r\nfrom other classes in the country. The rich and the great who possess\r\nequipages, enjoy the privilege of crushing them or of mutilating them in\r\nthe streets. . . There is no convenience for pedestrians, no side-walks.\r\nHundred victims die annually under the carriage wheels.\" \"I saw,\" says\r\nArthur Young, \"a poor child run over and probably killed, and have been\r\nmyself several times been covered from head to toe with the water from\r\nthe gutter. Should young (English) noblemen drive along London streets\r\nwithout sidewalks, in the same manner as their equals in Paris, they\r\nwould speedily and justly get very well thrashed and rolled in the\r\ngutter.\"\r\n\r\nMercier grows uneasy in the face of the immense populace:\r\n\r\n\"In Paris there are, probably, 200,000 persons with no property\r\nintrinsically worth fifty crowns, and yet the city subsists!\"\r\n\r\nOrder, consequently, is maintained only through fear and by force,\r\nowing to the soldiery of the watch who are called tristes-à-patte by the\r\ncrowd. \"This nick name enrages this species of militia, who then deal\r\nheavier blows around them, wounding indiscriminately all they encounter.\r\nThe low class is always ready to make war on them because it has never\r\nbeen fairly treated by them.\" In fact, \"a squad of the guard often\r\nscatters, with no trouble, crowds of five or six hundred men, at first\r\ngreatly excited, but melting away in the twinkling of an eye, after the\r\nsoldiery have distributed a few blows and handcuffed two or three of\r\nthe ringleaders.\"--Nevertheless, \"were the people of Paris abandoned\r\nto their true inclinations, did they not feel the horse and foot guards\r\nbehind them, the commissary and policeman, there would be no limits to\r\ntheir disorder. The populace, delivered from its customary restraint,\r\nwould give itself up to violence of so cruel a stamp as not to know when\r\nto stop. . . As long as white bread lasts,[5351] the commotion will\r\nnot prove general; the flour market[5352] must interest itself in the\r\nmatter, if the women are to remain tranquil. . . Should white bread\r\nbe wanting for two market days in succession, the uprising would be\r\nuniversal, and it is impossible to foresee the lengths this multitude at\r\nbay will go to in order to escape famine, they and their children.\"--In\r\n1789 white bread proves to be wanting throughout France.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5301: Théron de Montaugé, 102, 113.

THE ARMED FORCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n     Military force declines.--How the army is recruited.--How\r\n     the soldier is treated.\r\n\r\nAgainst universal sedition where is force?--The measures and\r\ndispositions which govern the 150,000 men who maintain order are the\r\nsame as those ruling the 26 millions people subject to it. We find here\r\nthe same abuses, disaffection, and other causes for the dissolution of\r\nthe nation which, in their turn, will dissolve the army.\r\n\r\nOf the 90 millions of pay[5401] which the army annually costs the\r\ntreasury, 46 millions are for officers and only 44 millions for\r\nsoldiers, and we are already aware that a new ordinance reserves ranks\r\nof all kinds for verified nobles. In no direction is this inequality,\r\nagainst which public opinion rebels so vigorously, more apparent. On\r\nthe one hand, authority, honors, money, leisure, good-living, social\r\nenjoyments, and plays in private, for the minority. On the other hand,\r\nfor the majority, subjection, dejection, fatigue, a forced or betrayed\r\nenlistment, no hope of promotion, pay at six sous a day,[5402] a narrow\r\ncot for two, bread fit for dogs, and, for several years, kicks like\r\nthose bestowed on a dog.[5403] On the one hand, a nobility of high\r\nestate, and, on the other, the lowest of the populace. One might\r\nsay that this was specially designed for contrast and to intensify\r\nirritation. \"The insignificant pay of the soldier,\" says an economist,\r\n\"the way in which he is dressed, lodged and fed, his utter dependence,\r\nwould render it cruelty to take any other than a man of the lower\r\nclass.\"[5404] Indeed, he is sought for only in the lowest layers\r\nof society. Not only are nobles and the bourgeoisie exempt from\r\nconscription, but again the employees of the administration, of the\r\nfermes and of public works, \"all gamekeepers and forest-rangers,\r\nthe hired domestics and valets of ecclesiastics, of communities, of\r\nreligious establishments, of the gentry and of nobles,\"[5405] and even\r\nof the bourgeoisie living in grand style, and still better, the sons\r\nof cultivators in easy circumstances, and, in general, all possessing\r\ninfluence or any species of protector. There remains, accordingly, for\r\nthe militia none but the poorest class, and they do not willingly\r\nenter it. On the contrary, the service is hateful to them; they conceal\r\nthemselves in the forests where they have to be pursued by armed men:\r\nin a certain canton which, three years later, furnishes in one day from\r\nfifty to one hundred volunteers, the young men cut off their thumbs to\r\nescape the draft.[5406] To this scum of society is added the sweepings\r\nof the depots and of the jails. Among the vagabonds that fill these,\r\nafter winnowing out those able to make their families known or to obtain\r\nsponsors, \"there are none left,\" says an intendant, \"but those who are\r\nentirely unknown or dangerous, out of which those regarded as the\r\nleast vicious are selected and efforts are made to place these in\r\nthe army.\"[5407]--The last of its affluents is the half-forced,\r\nhalf-voluntary enlistment by which the ranks are for the most part\r\nfilled, the human waste of large towns, like adventurers, discharged\r\napprentices, young reprobates turned out of doors, and people without\r\nhomes or steady occupation. The recruiting agent who is paid so much a\r\nhead for his recruits and so much an inch on their stature above five\r\nfeet, \"holds his court in a tavern, treating everyone\" promoting his\r\nmerchandise:\r\n\r\n\"Come, boys, soup, fish, meat and salad is what you get to eat in the\r\nregiment;\" nothing else, \"I don't deceive you--pie and Arbois wine are\r\nthe extras.\"[5408]\r\n\r\nHe pours the wine, pays the bill and, if need be, yields his mistress.\r\n\"After a few days debauchery, the young libertine, with no money to pay\r\nhis debts, is obliged to sell himself, while the laborer, transformed\r\ninto soldier, begins to drill under the lash.\"--Strange recruits these,\r\nfor the protection of society, all selected from the class which will\r\nattack it, down-trodden peasants, imprisoned vagabonds, social outcasts,\r\npoor fellows in debt, disheartened, excited and easily tempted, who,\r\naccording to circumstances, become at one time rioters, and at another\r\nsoldiers.--Which lot is preferable? The bread the soldier eats is not\r\nmore abundant than that of the prisoner, while poorer in quality; for\r\nthe bran is taken out of the bread which the locked-up vagabond eats,\r\nand left in the bread which is eaten by the soldier who locks him\r\nup[5409]. In this state of things the soldier ought not to mediate on\r\nhis lot, and yet this is just what his officers incite him to do. They\r\nalso have become politicians and fault-finders. Some years before the\r\nRevolution[5410] \"disputes occurred\" in the army, \"discussions\r\nand complaints, and, the new ideas fermenting in their heads,\r\na correspondence was established between two regiments. Written\r\ninformation was obtained from Paris, authorized by the Minister of\r\nWar, which cost, I believe, twelve louis per annum. It soon took a\r\nphilosophic turn, embracing dissertations, criticisms of the ministry,\r\nand of the government, desirable changes and, therefore, the more\r\ndiffused.\" Sergeants like Hoche, and fencing-masters like Augereau,\r\ncertainly often read this news, carelessly left lying on the tables, and\r\ncommented on it during the evening in their soldier quarters. Discontent\r\nis of ancient date, and already, at the end of the late reign, grievous\r\nwords are heard. At a banquet given by a prince of the blood,[5411] with\r\na table set for a hundred guests under an immense tent and served by\r\ngrenadiers, the odor these diffused upset the prince's delicate nose.\r\n\"These worthy fellows,\" said he, a little too loud, \"smell strong of the\r\nstocking.\" One of the grenadiers bluntly responded, \"Because we haven't\r\ngot any,\" which \"was followed by profound silence.\" During the ensuring\r\nyears irritation smolders and augments; the soldiers of Rochambeau have\r\nfought side by side with the free militia of America, and they keep this\r\nin mind. In 1788,[5412] Marshal de Vaux, previous to the insurrection\r\nin Dauphiny, writes to minister that \"it is impossible to rely on the\r\ntroops,\" while four months after the opening of the States-General\r\n16,000 deserters roaming around Paris leads the revolts instead of\r\nsuppressing them.[5413]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n     The social organization is dissolved.--No central rallying\r\n     point.--Inertia of the provinces.--Ascendancy of Paris.\r\n\r\nOnce this barrier has disappeared, no other embankment remains and the\r\ninundation spreads all over France like over an immense plain.\r\nWith other nations in like circumstances, some obstacles have\r\nbeen encountered; elevations have existed, centers of refuge, old\r\nconstructions in which, in the universal fright, a portion of the\r\npopulation could find shelter. Here, the first crisis sweeps away all\r\nthat remains, each individual of the twenty-six scattered millions\r\nstanding alone by himself. The administrations of Richelieu and Louis\r\nXIV. had been a long time at work insensibly destroying the natural\r\ngroupings which, when suddenly dissolved, unite and form over again of\r\ntheir own accord. Except in Vendée, I find no place, nor any class, in\r\nwhich a good many men, having confidence in a few men, are able, in the\r\nhour of danger, to rally around these and form a compact body. Neither\r\nprovincial nor municipal patriotism any longer exists. The inferior\r\nclergy are hostile to the prelates, the gentry of the province to the\r\nnobility of the court, the vassal to the seignior, the peasant to the\r\ntownsman, the urban population to the municipal oligarchy, corporation\r\nto corporation, parish to parish, neighbor to neighbor. All are\r\nseparated by their privileges and their jealousies, by the consciousness\r\nof having been imposed on, or frustrated, for the advantage of another.\r\nThe journeyman tailor is embittered against his foreman for preventing\r\nhim from doing a day's work in private houses, hairdressers against\r\ntheir employers for the like reason, the pastry-cook against the baker\r\nwho prevents him from baking the pies of housekeepers, the village\r\nspinner against the town spinners who wish to break him up, the rural\r\nwine-growers against the bourgeois who, in the circle of seven leagues,\r\nstrives to have their vines pulled up,[5414] the village against the\r\nneighboring village whose reduction of taxation has ruined it, the\r\novertaxed peasant against the under taxed peasant, one-half of a parish\r\nagainst its collectors, who, to its detriment, have favored the other\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n\"The nation,\" says Turgot, mournfully,[5415] \"is a society composed of\r\ndifferent orders badly united and of a people whose members have few\r\nmutual liens, nobody, consequently, caring for any interest but his own.\r\nNowhere is there any sign of an interest in common. Towns and villages\r\nmaintain no more relation with each other than the districts to which\r\nthey are attached; they are even unable to agree together with a view to\r\ncarry out public improvements of great importance to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe central power for a hundred and fifty years rules through its\r\ndivision of power. Men have been kept separate, prevented from acting\r\nin concert, the work being so successful that they no longer understand\r\neach other, each class ignoring the other class, each forming of the\r\nother a chimerical picture, each bestowing on the other the hues of its\r\nown imagination, one composing an idyll, the other framing a melodrama,\r\none imagining peasants as sentimental swains, the other convinced that\r\nthe nobles are horrible tyrants.--Through this mutual misconception\r\nand this secular isolation, the French lose the habit, the art and the\r\nfaculty for acting in an entire body. They are no longer capable of\r\nspontaneous agreement and collective action. No one, in the moment of\r\ndanger, dares rely on his neighbors or on his equals. No one knows where\r\nto turn to obtain a guide. \"A man willing to be responsible for the\r\nsmallest district cannot be found; and, more than this, one man able\r\nto answer for another man[5416].\" Utter and irremediable disorder is\r\nat hand. The Utopia of the theorists has been accomplished, the savage\r\ncondition has recommenced. Individuals now stand in by themselves;\r\neveryone reverting back to his original feebleness, while his\r\npossessions and his life are at the mercy of the first band that comes\r\nalong. He has nothing within him to control him but the sheep-like\r\nhabit of being led, of awaiting an impulsion, of turning towards the\r\naccustomed center, towards Paris, from which his orders have always\r\narrived. Arthur Young[5417] is struck with this mechanical movement.\r\nPolitical ignorance and docility are everywhere complete. He, a\r\nforeigner, conveys the news of Alsace into Burgundy: the insurrection\r\nthere had been terrible, the populace having sacked the city-hall at\r\nStrasbourg, of which not a word was known at Dijon; \"yet it is nine days\r\nsince it happened; had it been nineteen I question if they would more\r\nthan have received the intelligence.\" There are no newspapers in the\r\ncafés; no local centers of information, of resolution, of action. The\r\nprovince submits to events at the capital; \"people dare not move;\r\nthey dare not even form an opinion before Paris speaks.\"--This is what\r\nMonarchical centralization leads to. It has deprived the groups of their\r\ncohesion and the individual of his motivational drive. Only human dust\r\nremains, and this, whirling about and gathered together in massive\r\nforce, is blindly driven along by the wind.[5418]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n     Direction of the current.--The people led by lawyers.--\r\n     Theories and piques the sole surviving forces.--Suicide of\r\n     the Ancient regime.\r\n\r\nWe are all well aware from which side the gale comes, and, to assure\r\nourselves, we have merely to see how the reports of the Third-Estate are\r\nmade up. The peasant is led by the man of the law, the petty attorney\r\nof the rural districts, the envious advocate and theorist. This one\r\ninsists, in the report, on a statement being made in writing and at\r\nlength of his local and personal grievances, his protest against taxes\r\nand deductions, his request to have his dog free of the clog, and his\r\ndesire to own a gun to use against the wolves[5419]. Another one, who\r\nsuggests and directs, envelopes all this in the language of the Rights\r\nof Man and that of the circular of Sieyès.\r\n\r\n\"For two months,\" writes a commandant in the South,[5420] \"inferior\r\njudges and lawyers, with which both town and country swarm, with a view\r\nto their election to the States-General, have been racing after the\r\nmembers of the Third-Estate, under the pretext of standing by them and\r\nof giving them information. . . They have striven to make them believe\r\nthat, in the States-General, they alone would be masters and regulate\r\nall the affairs of the kingdom; that the Third-Estate, in selecting its\r\ndeputies among men of the robe, would secure the might and the right\r\nto take the lead, to abolish nobility and to cancel all its rights\r\nand privileges; that nobility would no longer be hereditary; that all\r\ncitizens, in deserving it, would be entitled to claim it; that, if\r\nthe people elected them, they would have accorded to the Third-Estate\r\nwhatever it desired, because the curates, belonging to the Third-Estate,\r\nhaving agreed to separate from the higher clergy and unite with them,\r\nthe nobles and the clergy, united together, would have but one vote\r\nagainst two of the Third-Estate. . . . If the third--Estate had chosen\r\nsensible townspeople or merchants they would have combined without\r\ndifficulty with the other two orders. But the assemblies of the\r\nbailiwicks and other districts were stuffed with men of the robe who\r\nhad absorbed all opinions and striven to take precedence of the others,\r\neach, in his own behalf, intriguing and conspiring to be appointed a\r\ndeputy.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Touraine,\" writes the intendant,[5421] \"most of the votes have been\r\nbespoken or begged for. Trusty agents, at the moment of voting, placed\r\nfilled-in ballots in the hands of the voters, and put in their way, on\r\nreaching the taverns, every document and suggestion calculated to excite\r\ntheir imaginations and determine their choice for the gentry of the\r\nbar.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the sénéchausée of Lectoure, a number of parishes have not been\r\ndesignated or notified to send their reports or deputies to the district\r\nassembly. In those which were notified the lawyers, attorneys and\r\nnotaries of the small neighboring towns have made up the list of\r\ngrievances themselves without summoning the community. . . Exact copies\r\nof this single rough draft were made and sold at a high price to the\r\ncouncils of each country parish\".--\r\n\r\nThis is an alarming symptom, one marking out in advance the road the\r\nRevolution is to take: The man of the people is indoctrinated by the\r\nadvocate, the pikeman allowing himself to be led by the spokesman.[5422]\r\n\r\nThe effect of their combination is apparent the first year. In\r\nFranche-Comté[5423] after consultation with a person named Rouget, the\r\npeasants of the Marquis de Chaila \"determine to make no further\r\npayments to him, and to divide amongst themselves the product of the\r\nwood-cuttings.\" In his paper \"the lawyer states that all the communities\r\nof the province have decided to do the same thing. . . His consultation\r\nis diffused to such an extent around the country that many of the\r\ncommunities are satisfied that they owe nothing more to the king nor to\r\nthe seigniors. M. de Marnésia, deputy to the (National) Assembly, has\r\narrived (here) to pass a few days at home on account of his health. He\r\nhas been treated in the rudest and most scandalous manner; it was even\r\nproposed to conduct him back to Paris under guard. After his departure\r\nhis chateau was attacked, the doors burst open and the walls of his\r\ngarden pulled down. (And yet) no gentleman has done more for the people\r\non his domain the M. le Marquis de Marnésia. . . Excesses of every kind\r\nare on the increase; I have constant complaints of the abuse which\r\nthe national militia make of their arms, and which I cannot remedy.\"\r\nAccording to an utterance in the National Assembly the police imagines\r\nthat it is to be disbanded and has therefore no desire to make enemies\r\nfor itself. \"The baillages are as timid as the police-forces; I send\r\nthem business constantly, but no culprit is punished.\"--\"No nation\r\nenjoys liberty so indefinite and so disastrous to honest people; it is\r\nabsolutely against the rights of man to see oneself constantly liable\r\nto have his throat cut by the scoundrels who daily confound liberty with\r\nlicense.\"--In other words, the passions utilize the theory to justify\r\nthemselves, and the theory appeal to passion to be carried out. For\r\nexample, near Liancourt, the Duc de Larochefoucauld possessed\r\nan uncultivated area of ground; \"at the commencement of the\r\nrevolution,[5424] the poor of the town declare that, as they form a part\r\nof the nation, untilled lands being national property, this belongs to\r\nthem,\" and \"with no other formality\" they take possession of it, divide\r\nit up, plant hedges and clear it off. \"This, says Arthur Young, shows\r\nthe general disposition. . . . Pushed a little farther the consequences\r\nwould not be slight for properties in this kingdom.\" Already, in the\r\npreceding year, near Rouen, the marauders, who cut down and sell the\r\nforests, declare, that \"the people have the right to take whatever they\r\nrequire for their necessities.\" They have had the doctrine preached to\r\nthem that they are sovereign, and they act as sovereigns. The condition\r\nof their intellects being given, nothing is more natural than their\r\nconduct. Several millions of savages are thus let loose by a few\r\nthousand windbags, the politics of the café finding an interpreter and\r\nministrants in the mob of the streets. On the one hand brute force is at\r\nthe service of the radical dogma. On the other hand radical dogma is at\r\nthe service of brute force. And here, in disintegrated France, these are\r\nthe only two valid powers remaining erect on the debris of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5401: Necker, \"De l'Administration des Finances,\" II. 422,\r\n435.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5402: The wages have in 1789 been estimated to be 7 sous 4\r\ndeniers of which 2 sous and 6 deniers would have to be paid for the\r\nbread.

Suicide of the Ancient Regime.\r\n\r\nThese two forces, radical dogma and brute force, are the successors and\r\nexecutors of the Ancient regime, and, on contemplating the way in\r\nwhich this regime engendered, brought forth, nourished, installed and\r\nstimulated them we cannot avoid considering its history as one long\r\nsuicide, like that of a man who, having mounted to the top of an immense\r\nladder, cuts away from under his feet the support which has kept him\r\nup.--In a case of this kind good intentions are not sufficient; to be\r\nliberal and even generous, to enter upon a few semi-reforms, is of\r\nno avail. On the contrary, through both their qualities and defects,\r\nthrough both their virtues and their vices, the privileged wrought their\r\nown destruction, their merits contributing to their ruin as well\r\nas their faults.--Founders of society, formerly entitled to their\r\nadvantages through their services, they have preserved their rank\r\nwithout fulfilling their duties; their position in the local as in\r\nthe central government is a sinecure, and their privileges have become\r\nabuses. At their head, a king, creating France by devoting himself\r\nto her as if his own property, ended by sacrificing her as if his\r\nown property; the public purse is his private purse, while passions,\r\nvanities, personal weaknesses, luxurious habits, family solicitudes, the\r\nintrigues of a mistress and the caprices of a wife, govern a state of\r\ntwenty-six millions of men with an arbitrariness, a heedlessness, a\r\nprodigality, a lack of skill, an absence of consistency that would\r\nscarcely be overlooked in the management of a private domain.--The king\r\nand the privileged excel in one direction, in manners, in good taste,\r\nin fashion, in the talent for representation and in entertaining and\r\nreceiving, in the gift of graceful conversation, in finesse and in\r\ngaiety, in the art of converting life into a brilliant and ingenious\r\nfestivity, regarding the world as a drawing room of refined idlers in\r\nwhich it suffices to be amiable and witty, whilst, actually, it is an\r\narena where one must be strong for combats, and a laboratory in which\r\none must work in order to be useful.--Through the habit, perfection\r\nand sway of polished intercourse they stamped on the French intellect\r\na classic form, which, combined with recent scientific acquisitions,\r\nproduced the philosophy of the eighteenth century, the disrepute of\r\ntradition, the ambition of recasting all human institutions according\r\nto the sole dictates of Reason, the appliance of mathematical methods\r\nto politics and morals, the catechism of the Rights of Man, and other\r\ndogmas of anarchical and despotic character in the CONTRAT SOCIAL.--Once\r\nthis chimera is born they welcome it as a drawing room fancy; they\r\nuse the little monster as a plaything, as yet innocent and decked with\r\nribbons like a pastoral lambkin; they never dream of its becoming a\r\nraging, formidable brute; they nourish it, and caress it, and then,\r\nopening their doors, they let it descend into the streets.--Here among\r\nthe middle class which the government has rendered ill-disposed by\r\ncompromising its fortunes, which the privileged have offended by\r\nrestricting its ambition, which is wounded by inequality through injured\r\nself-esteem, the revolutionary theory gains rapid accessions, a sudden\r\nasperity, and, in a few years, it finds itself undisputed master of\r\npublic opinion.--At this moment and at its summons, another colossal\r\nmonster rises up, a monster with millions of heads, a blind, startled\r\nanimal, an entire people pressed down, exasperated and suddenly loosened\r\nagainst the government whose exactions have despoiled it, against the\r\nprivileged whose rights have reduced it to starvation, without, in these\r\nrural districts abandoned by their natural protectors, encountering any\r\nsurviving authority; without, in these provinces subject to the yoke of\r\nuniversal centralization, encountering a single independent group\r\nand without the possibility of forming, in this society broken up by\r\ndespotism, any centers of enterprise and resistance; without finding,\r\nin this upper class disarmed by its very humanity, a policy devoid of\r\nillusion and capable of action. Without which all these good intentions\r\nand fine intellects shall be unable to protect themselves against the\r\ntwo enemies of all liberty and of all order, against the contagion of\r\nthe democratic nightmare which disturbs the ablest heads and against the\r\nirruptions of the popular brutality which perverts the best of laws. At\r\nthe moment of opening the States-General the course of ideas and events\r\nis not only fixed but, again, apparent. Beforehand and unconsciously,\r\neach generation bears (Page 400/296)within itself its past and its\r\nfuture; and to this one, long before the end, one might have been able\r\nto foretell its fate, and, if both details as well as the entire action\r\ncould have been foreseen, one would readily have accepted the following\r\nfiction made up by a converted Laharpe[5501] when, at the end of the\r\nDirectory, he arranged his souvenirs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" he says, \"as if it were but yesterday, and yet it is\r\nat the beginning of the year 1788. We were dining with one of our fellow\r\nmembers of the Academy, a grand seignior and a man of intelligence. The\r\ncompany was numerous and of every profession, courtiers, advocates, men\r\nof letters and academicians, all had feasted luxuriously according\r\nto custom. At the dessert the wines of Malvoisie and of Constance\r\ncontributed to the social gaiety a sort of freedom not always kept\r\nwithin decorous limits. At that time society had reached the point at\r\nwhich everything may be expressed that excites laughter. Champfort\r\nhad read to us his impious and libertine stories, and great ladies had\r\nlistened to these without recourse to their fans. Hence a deluge of\r\nwitticisms against religion, one quoting a tirade from 'La Pucelle,'\r\nanother bringing forward certain philosophical stanzas by Diderot. . . .\r\nand with unbounded applause. . . . The conversation becomes more\r\nserious; admiration is expressed at the revolution accomplished by\r\nVoltaire, and all agree in its being the first title to his fame. 'He\r\ngave the tone to his century, finding readers in the antechambers as\r\nwell as in the drawing-room.' One of the guests narrates, bursting with\r\nlaughter, what a hairdresser said to him while powdering his hair: 'You\r\nsee, sir, although I am a miserable scrub, I have no more religion\r\nthan any one else.' They conclude that the Revolution will soon be\r\nconsummated, that superstition and fanaticism must wholly give way to\r\nphilosophy, and they thus calculate the probabilities of the epoch and\r\nthose of the future society which will see the reign of reason. The most\r\naged lament not being able to flatter themselves that they will see it;\r\nthe young rejoice in a reasonable prospect of seeing it, and especially\r\ndo they congratulate the Academy on having paved the way for the great\r\nwork, and on having been the headquarters, the center, the inspirer of\r\nfreedom of thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the guests had taken no part in this gay conversation a person\r\nnamed Cazotte, an amiable and original man, but, unfortunately,\r\ninfatuated with the delusions of the visionary. In the most serious\r\ntone he begins: 'Gentlemen,' says he, 'be content; you will witness this\r\ngreat revolution that you so much desire. You know that I am something\r\nof a prophet, and I repeat it, you will witness it. . . . Do you know\r\nthe result of this revolution, for all of you, so long as you remain\r\nhere?'--'Ah!' exclaims Condorcet with his shrewd, simple air and smile,\r\n'let us see, a philosopher is not sorry to encounter a prophet.'--'You,\r\nMonsieur de Condorcet, will expire stretched on the floor of a dungeon;\r\nyou will die of the poison you take to escape the executioner, of the\r\npoison which the felicity of that era will compel you always to carry\r\nabout your person!'--At first, great astonishment, and then came an\r\noutburst of laughter. 'What has all this in common with philosophy and\r\nthe reign of reason?'--'Precisely what I have just remarked to you;\r\nin the name of philosophy, of humanity, of freedom, under the reign\r\nof reason, you will thus reach your end; and, evidently, the reign of\r\nreason will arrive, for there will be temples of reason, and, in those\r\ndays, in all France, the temples will be those alone of reason. . . .\r\nYou, Monsieur de Champfort, you will sever your veins with twenty-two\r\nstrokes of a razor and yet you will not die for months afterwards. You,\r\nMonsieur Vicq-d'Azir, you will not open your own veins but you will have\r\nthem opened six times in one day, in the agonies of gout, so as to be\r\nmore certain of success, and you will die that night. You, Monsieur de\r\nNicolai, on the scaffold; you, Monsieur Bailly, on the scaffold; you,\r\nMonsieur de Malesherbes, on the scaffold;. . . you, Monsieur Roucher,\r\nalso on the scaffold.'--'But then we shall have been overcome by Turks\r\nor Tartars?'--'By no means; you will be governed, as I have already told\r\nyou, solely by philosophy and reason. Those who are to treat you in\r\nthis manner will all be philosophers, will all, at every moment, have\r\non their lips the phrases you have uttered within the hour, will repeat\r\nyour maxims, will quote, like yourselves, the stanzas of Diderot and of\r\n\"La Pucelle.\"'--'And when will all this happen?'--'Six years will not\r\npass before what I tell you will be accomplished.'--'Well, these are\r\nmiracles,' exclaims La Harpe, 'and you leave me out?'--'You will be no\r\nless a miracle, for you will then be a Christian.'--'Ah,' interposes\r\nChampfort, I breathe again; if we are to die only when La Harpe becomes\r\na Christian we are immortals.'--'As to that, we women,' says the\r\nDuchesse de Gramont, 'are extremely fortunate in being of no consequence\r\nin revolutions. It is understood that we are not to blame, and our sex.'\r\n--'Your sex, ladies, will not protect you this time. . . . You will\r\nbe treated precisely as men, with no difference whatever. . . . You,\r\nMadame la Duchesse, will be led to the scaffold, you and many ladies\r\nbesides yourself in a cart with your hands tied behind your back.'--'Ah,\r\nin that event, I hope to have at least a carriage covered with\r\nblack.'--'No, Madame, greater ladies than yourself will go, like\r\nyourself in a cart and with their hands tied like yours.'--'Greater\r\nladies! What! Princesses of the blood!'--'Still greater ladies than\r\nthose. . .'They began to think the jest carried too far. Madame de\r\nGramont, to dispel the gloom, did not insist on a reply to her last\r\nexclamation, contenting herself by saying in the lightest tone, 'And\r\nthey will not even leave one a confessor!'--'No, Madame, neither you nor\r\nany other person will be allowed a confessor; the last of the condemned\r\nthat will have one, as an act of grace, will be. . .' He stopped\r\na moment. 'Tell me, now, who is the fortunate mortal enjoying this\r\nprerogative?'--'It is the last that will remain to him, and it will be\r\nthe King of France.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5501: Laharpe, or La Harpe, Jean François. (Paris 1739-1803).\r\nAuthor and critic, made a member of the Academy in 1776. (SR).]\r\n\r\n\r\n***** *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 1.\r\n\r\nON THE NUMBER OF ECCLESIASTICS AND NOBLES.\r\n\r\nThese approximate estimates are arrived at in the following manner:\r\n\r\n1. The number of nobles in 1789 was unknown. The genealogist Chérin,\r\nin his \"Abrégé chronologique des Edits, etc.\" (1789), states that he is\r\nignorant of the number. Moheau, to whom Lavoisier refers in his\r\nreport, 1791, is equally ignorant in this respect. (\"Recherches sur la\r\npopulation de la France,\" 1778, p. 105); Lavoisier states the number as\r\n83,000, while the Marquis de Bouillé (\"Mémoires,\" p.50), states 80,000\r\nfamilies; neither of these authorities advancing proofs of their\r\nstatements.--I find in the \"Catalogue nominatif des gentilhommes en\r\n1789,\" by Laroque and De Barthélemy, the number of nobles voting,\r\ndirectly or by proxy, in the elections of 1789, in Provence, Languedoc,\r\nLyonnais, Forez, Beaujolais, Touraine, Normandy, and Ile-de-France, as\r\n9,167.--According to the census of 1790, given by Arthur Young in his\r\n\"Travels in France,\" the population of these provinces was 7,757,000,\r\nwhich gives a proportion of 30,000 nobles voting in a population of\r\n26,000,000.--On examining the law and on summing up the lists, we find\r\nthat each noble represents somewhat less than a family, inasmuch as the\r\nson of the owner of a fief votes if he is twenty-five years of age; I\r\nthink, accordingly, that we are not far out of the way in estimating\r\nthe number of noble families at 26,000 or 28,000, which number, at\r\nfive individuals to the family, gives 130,000 or 140,000 nobles.--The\r\nterritory of France in 1789 being 27,000 square leagues,[6101] and the\r\npopulation 26,000,000, we may assign one noble family to every square\r\nleague of territory and to every 1,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n2. Concerning the clergy I find in the National Archives, among the\r\necclesiastical records, the following enumeration of monks belonging to\r\n28 orders: Grand Augustins 694, Petits-Pères 250, Barnabites 90, English\r\nBénédictines 52, Bénédictines of Cluny 298, of Saint-Vanne 612, of\r\nSaint-Maur 1,672, Citeaux 1,806, Récollets 2,238, Prémontrés 399,\r\nPrémontrés Réformés 394, Capucins 3,720, Carmes déchaussés 555,\r\nGrands-Carmes 853, Hospitaliers de Saint-Jean de Dieu 218, Chartreux\r\n1,144, Cordeliers 2,018, Dominicans 1,172, Feuillants 148, Genovéfains\r\n570, Mathurins 310, Minimes 684, Notre-Dame de la Merci 31, Notre-Saveur\r\n203, Tiers-Ordre de St. François 365, Saint-Jean des Vignes de\r\nSoissons 31, Théatins 25, abbaye de Saint-Victor 21, Maisons soumises à\r\nl'ordinaire 305. Total 20,745 monks in 2,489 convents. To this must be\r\nadded the Pères de l'Oratoire, de la Mission, de la Doctrine chrétienne\r\nand some others; the total of monks being about 23,000.--As to nuns,\r\nI have a catalogue from the National Archives of twelve dioceses,\r\ncomprising according to \"France ecclésiastique\" 1788, 5,576 parishes:\r\nthe diocèses respectively of Perpignan, Tulle, Marseilles, Rhodez,\r\nSaint-Flour, Toulouse, le Mans, Limoges, Lisieux, Rouen, Reims, and\r\nNoyon, in all, 5,394 nuns in 198 establishments. The proportion\r\nis 37,000 nuns in 1,500 establishments for the 38,000 parishes\r\nof France.--The total of regular clergy thus amounts to 60,000\r\npersons.--The secular clergy may be estimated at 70,000: curates and\r\nvicars 60,000 (\"Histoire de l'Eglise de France,\" XII. 142, by the\r\nAbbé Guettée); prelates, vicars-general, canons of chapters, 2,800;\r\ncollegiate canons, 5,600; ecclésiastics without livings, 3,000 (Sieyès).\r\nMoheau, a clear-headed and cautious statistician, writes in 1778\r\n(\"Recheches,\" p. 100): \"Perhaps, to day, there are 130,000 ecclesiastics\r\nin the kingdom.\" The enumeration of 1866 (\"Statistique de la France,\"\r\npopulation), gives 51,100 members of the secular clergy, 18,500 monks,\r\n86,300 nuns; total, 155,900 in a population of 38,000,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6101: In 1998, 550 000 square kilometers. (SR.)]\r\n\r\n(2) Archives nationales, G. 319 (\"Etat actuel de la Direction de Bourges\r\nau point de vue des aides,\" 1774).\r\n\r\n(3) Blet, at the present day, contains 1,629 inhabitants. (This was\r\naround 1884, in 1996 it remains a small commune and a village of 800\r\npeople on the route nationale N76 between Bourges and Sancoins. SR.)\r\n\r\n(4) The farms of Blet and Brosses really produce nothing for the\r\nproprietor, inasmuch as the tithes and the champart (field-rents),\r\n(articles 22 and 23), are comprehended in the rate of the leases.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nEND NOTE 2:\r\n\r\nON FEUDAL RIGHTS AND ON THE STATE OF FEUDAL DOMINION IN 1733.\r\n\r\nThe following information, for which I am indebted to M. de Boislisle,\r\nis derived from an act of partition drawn up September 6, 1783.\r\n\r\nIt relates to the estates of Blet and Brosses. The barony and estate\r\nof Blet lies in Bourbonnais, two leagues from Dun-le-Roi. Blet, says\r\na memorandum of an administrator of the Excise, is a \"good parish; the\r\nsoil is excellent, mostly in wood and pasture, the surplus being\r\nin tillable land for wheat, rye and oats. . . . The roads are bad,\r\nespecially in winter. The trade consists principally of horned cattle\r\nand embraces grain; the woods rot away on account of their remoteness\r\nfrom the towns and the difficulty of turning them to account.\"[6201]\r\n\r\n\"This estate,\" says the act of valuation, \"is in royal tenure on account\r\nof the king's chateau and fortress of Ainay, under the designation of\r\nthe town of Blet.\" The town was formerly fortified and its castle still\r\nremains. Its population was once large, \"but the civil wars of the\r\nsixteenth century, and especially the emigration of the Protestants\r\ncaused it to be deserted to such an extent that out of its former\r\npopulation of 3,000 scarcely 300 remain,[6202] which is the fate of\r\nnearly all the towns in this country.\" The estate of Blet, for many\r\ncenturies in the possession of the Sully family, passed, on the marriage\r\nof the heiress in 1363, to the house of Saint-Quentin, and was then\r\ntransmitted in direct line down to 1748, the date of the death\r\nof Alexander II. of Saint-Quentins, Count of Diet, governor of\r\nBerg-op-Zoom, and father of three daughters from whom the actual heirs\r\ndescend. These heirs are the Count de Simiane, the Chevalier de Simiane,\r\nand the minors of Bercy, each party owning one-third, represented by\r\n97,667 livres in the Blet estate, and 20,408 livres in the Brosses\r\nestate. The eldest, Comte de Simiane, enjoys, besides, a préciput\r\n(according to custom in the Bourbonnais), worth 15,000 livres,\r\ncomprising the castle with the adjoining farm and the seigniorial\r\nrights, honorary as well as profitable.\r\n\r\nThe entire domain, comprising both estates, is valued at 369,227 livres.\r\nThe estate of Blet, comprises 1,437 arpents, worked by seven farmers and\r\nfurnished, by the proprietor, with cattle valued at 13,781 livres. They\r\npay together to the proprietor 12,060 livres rent (besides claims for\r\npoultry and corvées). One, only, has a large farm, paying 7,800 livres\r\nper annum, the others paying rents of 1,300, 740, 640, and 240 livres\r\nper annum. The Brosses estate comprises 515 arpents, worked by two\r\nfarmers to whom the proprietor furnishes cattle estimated at 3,750\r\nlivres, and these together return to the proprietor 2,240 livres.[6203]\r\nThese métairies are all poor; only one of them has two rooms with\r\nfire-places; two or three, one room with a fire-place; the others\r\nconsist of a kitchen with an oven outside, and stables and barns.\r\nRepairs on the tenements are essential on all the farms except three,\r\n\"having been neglected for thirty years.\" \"The mill-flume requires to be\r\ncleaned out, and the stream, whose inundations injure the large meadow;\r\nalso repairs are necessary on the banks of the two ponds; on the church,\r\nwhich is the seignior's duty, the roof being in a sad state, the rain\r\npenetrating through the arch;\" and the roads require mending, these\r\nbeing in a deplorable condition during the winter. \"The restoration and\r\nrepairs of these roads seem never to have been thought of.\" The soil of\r\nthe Blet estate is excellent, but it requires draining and ditching to\r\ncarry off the water, otherwise the low lands will continue to produce\r\nnothing but weeds. Signs of neglect and desertion are everywhere\r\nvisible. The chateau of Blet has remained unoccupied since 1748; the\r\nfurniture, accordingly, is almost all decayed and useless; in 1748 this\r\nwas worth 7,612 livres, and now it is estimated at 1,000 livres. \"The\r\nwater-power costs nearly as much to maintain as the income derived from\r\nit. The use of plaster as manure is unknown,\" and yet \"in the land of\r\nplaster it costs almost nothing.\" The ground, moist and very good, would\r\ngrow excellent live hedges; and yet the fields are enclosed with bare\r\nfences against the cattle, \"which expense, say the farmers, is equal to\r\na third of the net income.\" This domain, as just described, is valued as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. The estate of Blet, according to the custom of the country for noble\r\nestates, is valued at rate twenty-five, namely, 373,000 livres, from\r\nwhich must be deducted a capital of 65,056 livres, representing the\r\nannual charges (the fixed salary of the curate, repairs, etc.), not\r\nincluding personal charges like the vingtièmes. Its net revenue per\r\nannum is 12,300 livres, and is worth, net, 308,003 livres.\r\n\r\n2. The estate of Brosses is estimated at rate twenty-two, ceasing to be\r\nnoble through the transfer of judicial and fief rights to that of Blet.\r\nThus rated it is worth 73,583 livres, from which must be deducted a\r\ncapital of 12,359 livres for actual charges, the estate bringing in\r\n3,140 livres per annum and worth, net, 61,224 livres. These revenues are\r\nderived from the following sources:\r\n\r\n1. Rights of the high, low and middle courts of justice over the entire\r\nterritory of Blet and other villages, Brosses and Jalay. The upper\r\ncourts, according to an act passed at the Chatelet, April 29, 1702,\r\n\"take cognizance of all actions, real and personal, civil and criminal,\r\neven actions between nobles and ecclesiastics, relating to seals and\r\ninventories of movable effects, tutelages, curacies, the administration\r\nof the property of minors, of domains, and of the customary dues and\r\nrevenues of the seigniory, etc.\"\r\n\r\n2. Rights of the forests, edict of 1707. The seignior's warden decides\r\nin all cases concerning waters, and woods, and customs, and crimes\r\nrelating to fishing and hunting.\r\n\r\n3. Right of voirie or the police of the highways, streets, and buildings\r\n(excepting the great main roads). The seignior appoints a bailly, warden\r\nand road overseer, one M. Theurault (at Sagonne), a fiscal attorney,\r\nBaujard (at Blet); he may remove them \"in case they make no returns.\"\r\n\"The rights of the greffe were formerly secured to the seignior, but as\r\nit is now very difficult to find intelligent persons in the country able\r\nto fulfill its functions, the seignior abandons his rights to those whom\r\nit may concern.\" (The seignior pays forty-eight livres per annum to the\r\nbailly to hold his court once a month, and twenty-four livres per annum\r\nto the fiscal attorney to attend them).\r\n\r\nHe receives the fines and confiscation of cattle awarded by his\r\nofficers. The profit therefrom, an average year, is eight livres.\r\n\r\nHe must maintain a jail and a jailer. (It is not stated whether there\r\nwas one). No sign of a gibbet is found in the seigniory.\r\n\r\nHe may appoint twelve notaries; only one, in fact, is appointed at\r\nBlet \"and he has nothing to do,\" a M. Baujard, fiscal attorney. This\r\ncommission is assigned him gratuitously, to keep up the privilege,\r\n\"otherwise it would be impossible to find any one sufficiently\r\nintelligent to perform its functions.\"\r\n\r\nHe appoints a sergeant, but, for a long time, this sergeant pays no rent\r\nor anything for his lodging.\r\n\r\n4. Personal and real taille. In Bourbonnais the taille was formerly\r\nserf and the serfs mainmortable. \"Seigniors still possessing rights of\r\nbordelage, well established throughout their fiefs and courts, at the\r\npresent time, enjoy rights of succession to their vassals in all cases,\r\neven to the prejudice of their children if non-resident and no longer\r\ndwelling under their roofs.\" But in 1255, Hodes de Sully, having granted\r\na charter, renounced this right of real and personal taille for a right\r\nof bourgeoisie, still maintained, (see further on).\r\n\r\n5. Right to unclaimed property, cattle, furniture, effects, stray swarms\r\nof bees, treasure-trove; (no profits from this for twenty years past).\r\n\r\n6. Right to property of deceased persons without heirs, to that of\r\ndeceased bastards, the possessions of condemned criminals either to\r\ndeath, to the galleys or to exile, etc., (no profit).\r\n\r\n7. Right of the chase and of fishing, the latter worth fifteen livres\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\n8. Right of bourgeoisie (see article 4), according to the charter of\r\n1255, and the court-roll of 1484. The wealthiest pay annually twelve\r\nbushels of oats at forty livres and twelve deniers parasis; the less\r\nwealthy nine bushels and nine deniers; all others six bushels and six\r\ndeniers. \"These rights of bourgeoisie are well established, set forth in\r\nall court-rolls and acknowledgments rendered to the king and perpetuated\r\nby numerous admissions the motives that have led former stewards and\r\nfermiers to interrupt the collection of these cannot be divined. Many of\r\nthe seigniors in Bourbonnais have the benefit of and exact these taxes\r\nof their vassals by virtue of titles much more open to question than\r\nthose of the seigniors of Blet.\"\r\n\r\n9. Rights of protection of the chateau of Blet. The royal edict of 1497,\r\nfixing this charge for the inhabitants of Blet and all those dwelling\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of its tribunals, those of Charly, Boismarvier,\r\netc., at five sous per fire per annum, which has been carried out. \"Only\r\nlately has the collection of this been suspended, notwithstanding its\r\nrecognition at no late date, the inhabitants all admitting themselves to\r\nbe subject to the said guet et garde of the chateau.\r\n\r\n10. Right of toll on all merchandise and provisions passing through\r\nthe town of Blet, except grain, flour and vegetables. (A trial pending\r\nbefore the Council of State since 1727 and not terminated in 1745; \"the\r\ncollection thereof, meanwhile, being suspended\").\r\n\r\n11. Right of potage on wines sold at retail in Blet, ensuring to the\r\nseignior nine pints of wine per cask, leased in 1782 for six years, at\r\nsixty livres per annum.\r\n\r\n12. Right of boucherie or of taking the tongues of all animals\r\nslaughtered in the town, with, additionally, the heads and feet of all\r\ncalves. No slaughter-house at Blet, and yet \"during the harvesting of\r\neach year about twelve head of cattle are slaughtered.\" This tax is\r\ncollected by the steward and is valued at three livres per annum.\r\n\r\n13. Right of fairs and markets, aunage, weight and measures. Five\r\nfairs per annum and one market-day each week, but little frequented; no\r\ngrain-market. This right is valued at twenty-four livres per annum.\r\n\r\n14. Corvées of teams and manual labor, through seigniorial right,\r\non ninety-seven persons at Blet (twenty-two carvées of teams and\r\nseventy-five of manual labor), twenty-six persons at Brosses (five teams\r\nand twenty-one hands). The seignior pays six sous for food, each corvée,\r\non men, and twelve sous on each corvee of four oxen. \"Among those\r\nsubject to this corvée the larger number are reduced almost to beggary\r\nand have large families, which often induces the seignior not to exact\r\nthis right rigorously.\" The reduced value of the corvées is forty-nine\r\nlivres fifteen sols.\r\n\r\n15. Benalité (socome), of the mill, (a sentence of 1736 condemning Roy,\r\na laborer, to have his grain ground in the mill of Blet, and to pay a\r\nfine for having ceased to have grain ground there during three years).\r\nThe miller reserves a sixteenth of the flour ground. The district-mill,\r\nas well as the windmill, with six arpents adjoining, are leased at 600\r\nlivres per annum.\r\n\r\n16. Banalité of the oven. Agreement of 1537 between the seignior and his\r\nvassals: he allows them the privilege of a small oven in their domicile\r\nof three squares, six inches each, to bake pies, biscuits and cakes;\r\nin other respects subject to the district oven. He is entitled to\r\none-sixteenth of the dough; this right might produce 150 livres\r\nannually, but, for several years, the oven has been dilapidated.\r\n\r\n17. Right of the colombier, dove-cot. The chateau park contains one.\r\n\r\n18. Right of bordelage. (The seignior is heir-at-law, except when the\r\nchildren of the deceased live with their parents at the time of his\r\ndeath. This right covers an area of forty-eight arpentss. For twenty\r\nyears, through neglect or from other causes, he has derived nothing from\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n19. Right over waste and abandoned ground and to alluvial accumulations.\r\n\r\n20. Right, purely honorary, of seat and burial in the choir, of incense\r\nand of special prayer, of funeral hangings outside and inside the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n21. Rights of lods et ventes on copyholders, due by the purchaser of\r\nproperty liable to this lien, in forty days. \"In Bourbonnais, the lods\r\net ventes are collected at a third, a quarter, at the sixth, eighth and\r\ntwelfth rate.\" The seignior of Blet and Brosses collects at rate six. It\r\nis estimated that sales are made once in eighty years; these rights bear\r\non 1,356 arpents which are worth, the best, 192 livres per arpent the\r\nsecond best, 110 livres, the poorest, 75 livres. At this rate the 1,350\r\narpents are worth 162,750 livres. A discount of one-quarter of the lods\r\net ventes is allowed to purchasers. Annual revenue of this right 254\r\nlivres.\r\n\r\n22. Right of tithe and of charnage. The seignior has obtained all tithe\r\nrights, save a few belonging to the canons of Don-le-Rol and to the\r\nprior of Chaumont. The tithes are levied on the thirteenth sheaf. They\r\nare comprised in the leases.\r\n\r\n23. Right of terrage or champart: the right of collecting, after the\r\ntithes, a portion of the produce of the ground. \"In Bourbonnais, the\r\nterrage is collected in various ways, on the third sheaf, on the fifth,\r\nsixth, seventh, and commonly one-quarter; at Blet it is the twelfth.\"\r\nThe seignior of Blet collects terrage only on a certain number of the\r\nfarms of his seigniory; \"in relation to Brosses, it appears that all\r\ndomains possessed by copyholders are subject to the right.\" These rights\r\nof terrage are comprised in the leases of the farms of Blet and of\r\nBrosses.\r\n\r\n24. Cens, surcens and rentes due on real property of different kinds,\r\nhouses, fields, meadows, etc., situated in the territory of the\r\nseigniory. In the seigniory of Blet, 810 arpents, divided into 511\r\nportions, in the hands of 120 copyholders, are in this condition, and\r\ntheir cens annually consists of 137 francs in money, sixty-seven bushels\r\nof wheat, three of barley, 159 of oats, sixteen hens, 130 chickens, six\r\ncocks and capons; the total valued at 575 francs. On the Brosses estate,\r\neighty-five arpents, divided into 112 parcels, in the hands of twenty\r\ncopyholders, are in this condition, and their total cens is fourteen\r\nfrancs money, seventeen bushels of wheat, thirty-two of barley,\r\ntwenty-six hens, three chickens and one capon; the whole valued at 126\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\n25. Rights over the commons (124 arpents in Blet and 164 arpents in\r\nBrosses).\r\n\r\nThe vassals have on these only the right of use. \"Almost the whole of\r\nthe land, on which they exercise this right of pasturage, belongs to the\r\nseigniors, save this right with which they are burdened; it is granted\r\nonly to a few individuals.\"\r\n\r\n26. Rights over the fiefs mouvants of the barony of Blet. Some\r\nare situated in Bourbonnais, nineteen being in this condition. In\r\nBourbonnais, the fiefs, even when owned by plebeians, simply owe la\r\nbouche et les mains to the seignior at each mutation. Formerly the\r\nseignior of Blet enforced, in this case, the right of redemption which\r\nhas been allowed to fall into desuetude. Others are situated in Berry\r\nwhere the right of redemption is exercised. One fief in Berry, that\r\nof Cormesse held by the archbishop of Bourges, comprising eighty-five\r\narpents, besides a portion of the tithes, and producing 2,100 livres per\r\nannum, admitting a mutation every twenty years, annually brings to the\r\nseignior of Blet 105 livres.\r\n\r\nBesides the charges indicated there are the following:\r\n\r\n1. To the curate of Blet, his fixed salary. According to royal enactment\r\nin 1686, this should be 300 livres. According to arrangement in 1692,\r\nthe curate, desirous of assuring himself of this fixed salary, yielded\r\nto the seignior all the dimes, novales, etc. The edict of 1768 having\r\nfixed the curate's salary at 500 livres, the curate claimed this sum\r\nthrough writs. The canons of Dun-le-Roi and the prior of Chaumont,\r\npossessing tithes on the territory of Blet, were obliged to pay a\r\nportion of it. At present it is at the charge of the seignior of Blet.\r\n\r\n2. To the guard, besides his lodging, warming and the use of three\r\narpents, 200 livres.\r\n\r\n3. To the steward or registrar, to preserve the archives, look after\r\nrepairs, collect lods et ventes, and fines, 432 livres, besides the use\r\nof ten arpente.\r\n\r\n4. To the king, the vingtièmes. Formerly the estates of Blet and Brosses\r\npaid 810 livres for the two vingtièmes and the two sous per livre. After\r\nthe establishment of the third vingtième they paid 1,216 livres.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6201: Archives nationales, G. 319 (\"Etat actuel de la\r\nDirection de Bourges au point de vue des aides,\" 1774).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6202: Blet, at the present day, contains 1,629 inhabitants.\r\n(This was around 1884, in 1996 it remains a small commune and a village\r\nof 800 people on the route nationale N76 between Bourges and Sancoins.\r\nSR.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6203: The farms of Blet and Brosses really produce nothing for\r\nthe proprietor, inasmuch as the tithes and the champart (field-rents),\r\n(articles 22 and 23), are comprehended in the rate of the leases.]\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nEND-NOTE 3:\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND NOMINAL REVENUES OF ECCLESIASTICAL\r\nDIGNITIES AND BENEFICES.\r\n\r\nAccording to Raudot (\"La France avant la Revolution,\" p.84), one-half\r\nextra must be added to the official valuation; according to Boiteau\r\n(\"Etat de la France en 1789,\" p.195), this must be tripled and even\r\nquadrupled. I think that, for the episcopal sees, one-half extra should\r\nbe added and, for the abbeys and priories, double, and sometimes triple\r\nand even quadruple the amount. The following facts show the variation\r\nbetween official and actual sums.\r\n\r\n1. In the \"Almanach Royal,\" the bishopric of Troyes is valued at 14,000\r\nlivres; in \"France Ecclésiastique of 1788,\" at 50,000. According\r\nto Albert Babeau (\"Histoire de la Révolution dans le department de\r\nl'Aube\"), it brings in 70,000 livres. In \"France Ecclésiastique,\" the\r\nbishopric of Strasbourg is put down at 400,000 livres. According to the\r\nDuc de Lévis (\"Souvenirs,\" p. 156) it brings in at least 600,000 livres\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n2. In the same work, the abbey of Jumiéges is assigned for 23,000\r\nlivres. I find, in the papers of the ecclesiastic committee, it brings\r\nto the abbé 50,000 livres. In this work the abbey of Bèze is estimated\r\nat 8,000 livres. I find it bringing to the monks alone 30,000, while the\r\nabbés portion is at least as large. (\"De l'Etat religieux, par les abbés\r\nde Bonnefoi et Bernard.,\" 1784). The abbé thus receives 30,000 livres,\r\nBernay (Eure), is officially reported at 16,000. The \"Doleances\" of the\r\ncahiers estimate it at 57,000. Saint-Amand is put down as bringing to\r\nthe Cardinal of York 6,000 livres and actually brings him 100,000. (De\r\nLuynes, XIII. 215).\r\n\r\nClairvaux, in the same work, is put down at 9,000, and in Warroquier\r\n(\"Etat Général de la France en 1789,\") at 60,000. According to Beugnot,\r\nwho belongs to the country, and a practical man, the abbé has from\r\n300,000 to 400,000 livres income.\r\n\r\nSaint-Faron, says Boiteau, set down at 18,000 livres, is worth 120,000\r\nlivres.\r\n\r\nThe abbey of Saint-Germain des Près (in the stewardships), is put down\r\nat 100,000 livres. The Comte de Clermont, who formerly had it, leased\r\nit at 160, 000 livres, \"not including reserved fields and all that the\r\nfarmers furnished in straw and oats for his horses.\" (Jules Cousin,\r\n\"Comte de Clermont and his Court.\")\r\n\r\nSaint-Waas d'Arras, according to \"La France Ecclésiastique,\" brings\r\n40,000 livres. Cardinal de Rohan refused 1,000 livres per month for\r\nhis portion offered to him by the monks. (Duc de Lévis, \"Souvenirs,\" p.\r\n156). Its value thus is about 300,000 livres.\r\n\r\nRemiremont, the abbess always being a royal princess, one of the most\r\npowerful monasteries, the richest and best endowed, is officially valued\r\nat the ridiculous sum of 15,000 livres.\r\n\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n\r\nEND-NOTE 4:\r\n\r\nON THE EDUCATION OF PRINCES AND PRINCESSES.\r\n\r\nAn entire chapter might be devoted to this subject; I shall cite but a\r\nfew texts.\r\n\r\n(Barbier, \"Journal,\" October, 1670). The Dauphine has just given birth\r\nto an infant.\r\n\r\n\"La jeune princesse en est a sa quatrieme nourrice. . . . Jai appris\r\nà cette occasion que tout se fait par forme à la cour, suivant un\r\nprotocole de médecin, en sorte que c'est un miracle d'élever un prince\r\net une princesse. La nourrice n'a d'autres fonctions que de donner à\r\ntêter à l'enfant quand on le lui apporte; elle ne peut pas lui toucher.\r\nIl y a des remueuses et femmes préposées pour cela, mais qui n'ont\r\npoint d'ordre à recevoir de la nourrice. Il y a des heures pour remuer\r\nl'enfant, trois ou quatre fois dans la journée. Si l'enfant dort, on le\r\nréveille pour le remuer. Si, après avoir été changé, il fait dans ses\r\nlanges, il reste ainsi trois ou quatre heures dans son ordure. Si une\r\nepingle le pique, la nourrice ne doit pas l'ôter; il faut chercher\r\net attendre une autre femme; l'enfant crie dans tons ces cas, il se\r\ntuurmente et s'échauffe, en sorte que c'est une vraie misère que toutes\r\nces cérémonies.\"\r\n\r\n(Madame de Genlis, \"Souvenirs de Félicie,\" p.74. Conversation with\r\nMadame Louise, daughter of Louis XV., and recently become a Carmelite).\r\n\r\n\"I should like to know what troubled you most in getting accustomed to\r\nyour new profession?\r\n\r\n\"You could never imagine,\" she replied, smiling. \"It was the descent\r\nof a small flight of steps alone by myself. At first it seemed to me a\r\ndreadful precipice, and I was obliged to sit down on the steps and slide\r\ndown in that attitude.\"--\"A princess, indeed, who had never descended\r\nany but the grand staircase at Versailles, leaning on the arm of her\r\ncavalier in waiting and surrounded by pages, necessarily trembled on\r\nfinding herself alone on the brink of steep winding steps. (Such is) the\r\neducation, so absurd in many respects, generally bestowed on persons of\r\nthis rank; always watched from infancy, followed, assisted, escorted and\r\neverything anticipated, (they) are thus, in great part, deprived of the\r\nfaculties with which nature has endowed them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Campan, \"Mémoires,\" I. 58, 28.\r\n\r\n\"Madame Louise often told me that, although twelve years of age, she had\r\nnot fully learned the alphabet. . . .\r\n\r\n\"It was necessary to decide absolutely whether a certain water-bird was\r\nfat or lean. Madame Victoire consulted a bishop. . . . He replied\r\nthat, in a doubt of this kind, after having the bird cooked it would be\r\nnecessary to puncture it on a very cold silver dish and, if the juice\r\ncoagulated in one-quarter of an hour, the bird might be considered fat.\r\nMadame Victoire immediately put it to test; the juice did not coagulate.\r\nThe princess was highly delighted, as she was very fond of this species\r\nof game. Fasting (on religious grounds), to which Madame Victoire was\r\naddicted, put her to inconvenience; accordingly she awaited the midnight\r\nstroke of Holy Saturday impatiently. A dish of chicken and rice and\r\nother succulent dishes were then at once served up.\"\r\n\r\n(\"Journal de Dumont d'Urville,\" commanding the vessel on which\r\nCharles X. left France in 1830. Quoted by Vaulabelle, History of the\r\nRestoration, VIII. p.465).\r\n\r\n\"The king and the Duc d'Angoulême questioned me on my various campaigns,\r\nbut especially on my voyage around the world in the 'Astrolabe.'\r\nMy narrative seemed to interest them very much, their interruptions\r\nconsisting of questions of remarkable naiveté, showing that they\r\npossessed no notions whatever, even the most superficial, on the\r\nsciences or on voyages, being as ignorant on these points as any of the\r\nold rentiers of the Marais.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 5.\r\n\r\nOn the rate of direct taxation.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are extracted from the proces-verbaux of the\r\nprovincial assemblies (1778-1787)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n     Access--Total en\r\n      Taille. iores de Capitation Impot des multiples\r\n      la taille. taillable. routes. de la taille.\r\n\r\n     Ile-de-France, 4,296,040 2,207,826 2,689,287 519,989 2,23\r\n     Lyonnais, 1,356,954 903,653 898,089 315,869 2,61\r\n     Géneralité de Rouen, 2,671,939 1,595,051 1,715,592 598,258[6501] 2,46\r\n     Généralité de Caen, 1,939,665 1,212,429 1,187,823 659,034 2,56\r\n     Berry, 821,921 448,431 464,955 236,900 2,50\r\n     Poitou, 2,309,681 1,113,766 1,403,402 520,000 2,30\r\n     Soissonnats, 1,062,392 911,883 734,899 462,883 2,94\r\n     Orléanais, 2,353,892 1,256,125 1,485,720 586,385 2,34\r\n     Champagne, 1,783,850 1,459,780 1,377,371 807,280 3,00\r\n     Généralité d'Alencon, 1,742,655 1,120,041 1,067,849 435,637 2,47\r\n     Auvergne 1,999,040 1,399,678 1,753,026 310,468 2,70\r\n     Généralité d'Auch, 1,440,533 931,261 797,268 316,909[6502] 2,35\r\n     Haute-Guyenne, 2,531,314 1,267,619 1,268,855 308,993[6503] 2,47\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal of the taille being one, the figures in the last column\r\nrepresent, for each province, the total of the four taxes in relation\r\nto the taille. The average of all these is 2.53. The accessories of\r\nthe taille, the poll-tax and the tax for roads, are fixed for each\r\nassessable party, pro rata to his taille. Multiply the sum representing\r\nthe portion of the taille deducted from a net income by 2.53, to know\r\nthe sum of the four taxes put together and deducted from this income.\r\n\r\nThis part varies from province to province, from parish to parish, and\r\neven from individual to individual. Nevertheless we may estimate that\r\nthe taille, on the average, especially when bearing on a small peasant\r\nproprietor, without protector or influence, abstracts one-sixth of his\r\nnet income, say 16 fr. 66 c. on 100 francs. For example, according to\r\nthe declarations of the provincial assemblies, in Champagne, it deducts\r\n3 sous and 2/3 of a denier per livre, or 15 fr. 28 c. on 100 francs; in\r\nthe Ile-de-France, 35 livres 14 sous on 240 livres, or 14 fr. 87 c. on\r\n100; in Auvergne, 4 sous per livre of the net income, that is to say,\r\n20 %. Finally, in the generalship of Auch, the provincial assembly\r\nestimates that the taille and accessories absorb three-tenths of the\r\nnet revenue, by which it is evident that, taking the amounts of the\r\nprovincial budget, the taille alone absorbs eighteen fr. ten c. on 100\r\nfrancs of revenue.\r\n\r\nThus stated, if the taille as principal absorbs one-sixth of the net\r\nincome of the subject of the taille, that is to say, 16 fr. 66 c. on\r\n100, the total of the four taxes above mentioned, takes 16 fr. 66 c. X\r\n2,53 = 42 fr. 15 c. on 100 fr. income. To which must be added 11 fr. for\r\nthe two vingtièmes and 4 sous per livre added to the first vingtième,\r\ntotal 53 fr. 15 c. direct tax on 100 livres income subject to the\r\ntaille.\r\n\r\nThe dime, tithe, being estimated at a seventh of the net income,\r\nabstracts in addition 14 ft. 28 c. The feudal dues being valued at the\r\nsame sum also take off 14 fr. 28 c., total 28 fr. 56 c. Sum total of\r\ndeductions of the direct royal tax, of the ecclesiastic tithes, and of\r\nfeudal dues, 81 fr. 71c. on 100 fr. income. There remain to the tax.\r\npayer 18 fr. 29 C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6501: This amount is not given by the provincial assembly;\r\nto fill up this blank I have taken the tenth of the taille, of the\r\naccessories and of the assessable poll-tax, this being the mode followed\r\nby the provincial assembly of Lyonnais. By the declaration of June\r\n2, 1717, the tax on roads may be carried to one-sixth of the three\r\npreceding taxes it is commonly one-tenth or, in relation to the\r\nprincipal of the taille, one-quarter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6502:--Same remark.--]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6503: The provincial assembly carries this amount to\r\none-eleventh of the taille and accessories combined.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of The Ancient Regime, by Hippolyte A.
