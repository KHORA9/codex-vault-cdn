Here, with less\r\nthan 20,000 Union troops, behind some hastily constructed works, he had\r\nreceived the impetuous and overwhelming assault of the Enemy--at first\r\nso successful as to threaten a bloody and disastrous rout to the Union\r\ntroops--and, by a brilliant counter-charge, and subsequent obstinate\r\ndefensive-fighting, had repulsed the Rebel forces, with nearly three\r\ntimes the Union losses, and withdrew the next day in safety to the\r\ndefenses of Nashville.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Hood, with his diminished Rebel Army, sat down before\r\nthe lines of Thomas's somewhat augmented Army, which stretched from bank\r\nto bank of the bight of the Cumberland river upon which Nashville is\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nAnd now a season of intense cold set in, lasting a week or ten days.\r\nDuring this period of apparent inaction on both sides--which aroused\r\npublic apprehension in the North, and greatly disturbed General Grant--I\r\nwas ordered to City Point, by the General-in-Chief, with a view to his\r\ndetailing me to Thomas's Command, at Nashville.\r\n\r\nOn the way, I called on President Lincoln, at the White House.  I found\r\nhim not very well, and with his feet considerably swollen.  He was\r\nsitting on a chair, with his feet resting on a table, while a barber was\r\nshaving him.  Shaking him by the hand, and asking after his health, he\r\nanswered, with a humorous twinkle of the eye, that he would illustrate\r\nhis condition by telling me a story.  Said he: \"Two of my neighbors, on\r\na certain occasion, swapped horses.  One of these horses was large, but\r\nquite thin.  A few days after, on inquiry being made of the man who had\r\nthe big boney horse, how the animal was getting along?--whether\r\nimproving or not?--the owner said he was doing finely; that he had\r\nfattened almost up to the knees already!\"\r\n\r\nAfterward--when, the process of shaving had been completed, we passed to\r\nanother room--our conversation naturally turned upon the War; and his\r\nideas upon all subjects connected with it were as clear as those of any\r\nother person with whom I ever talked.  He had an absolute conviction as\r\nto the ultimate outcome of the War--the final triumph of the Union Arms;\r\nand I well remember, with what an air of complete relief and perfect\r\nsatisfaction he said to me, referring to Grant--\"We have now at the head\r\nof the Armies, a man in whom all the People can have confidence.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return to Military operations: On December 10th? Sherman reached\r\nthe sea-board and commenced the siege of Savannah, Georgia; on the 13th,\r\nFort McAllister was stormed and Sherman's communications opened with the\r\nSea; on the 15th and 16th, the great Battle of Nashville was fought,\r\nbetween the Armies of Thomas and Hood, and a glorious victory gained by\r\nthe Union Arms--Hood's Rebel forces being routed, pursued for days, and\r\npractically dispersed; and, before the year ended, Savannah surrendered,\r\nand was presented to the Nation, as \"a Christmas gift,\" by Sherman.\r\n\r\nAnd now the last Session of the Thirty-eighth Congress having commenced,\r\nthe Thirteenth Amendment might at any time come up again in the House.\r\nIn his fourth and last Annual Message, just sent in to that Body,\r\nPresident Lincoln had said:\r\n\r\n\"At the last Session of Congress a proposed Amendment of the\r\nConstitution abolishing Slavery throughout the United States, passed the\r\nSenate, but failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the\r\nHouse of Representatives.  Although the present is the same Congress,\r\nand nearly the same members, and without questioning the wisdom or\r\npatriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the\r\nreconsideration and passage of the measure at the present Session.  Of\r\ncourse the abstract question is not changed; but an intervening election\r\nshows, almost certainly, that the next Congress will pass the measure if\r\nthis does not.  Hence there is only a question of time as to when the\r\nproposed Amendment will go to, the States for their action.  And as it\r\nis to so go, at all, events, may we not agree that the sooner the\r\nbetter?  It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on\r\nmembers to change their views or their votes, any farther than, as an\r\nadditional element to be considered, their judgment may be affected by\r\nit.  It is the voice of the People now, for the first time, heard upon\r\nthe question.  In a great National crisis like ours, unanimity of action\r\namong those seeking a common end is very desirable--almost\r\nindispensable.  And yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable\r\nunless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply\r\nbecause it is the will of the majority.  In this case the common end is\r\nthe maintenance of the Union; and, among the means to secure that end,\r\nsuch will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of\r\nsuch Constitutional Amendment.\"\r\n\r\nAfter affirming that, on the subject of the preservation of the Union,\r\nthe recent elections had shown the existence of \"no diversity among the\r\nPeople;\" that \"we have more men now than we had when the War began;\"\r\nthat \"we are gaining strength\" in all ways; and that, after the\r\nevidences given by Jefferson Davis of his unchangeable opposition to\r\naccept anything short of severance from the Union, \"no attempt at\r\nnegotiation with the Insurgent leader could result in any good,\" he\r\nappealed to the other Insurgents to come back to the fold--the door of\r\namnesty and pardon, being still \"open to all.\"  But, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the National\r\nAuthority, on the part of the Insurgents, as the only indispensable\r\ncondition to ending the War, on the part of the Government, I retract\r\nnothing heretofore said as to Slavery.  I repeat the declaration made a\r\nyear ago, that 'while I remain in my present position I shall not\r\nattempt to retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamation, nor shall I\r\nreturn to Slavery any Person who is Free by the terms of that\r\nProclamation, or by any of the Acts of Congress.'  If the People should,\r\nby whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty to Reenslave such\r\nPersons, another, and not I, must be their instrument to perform it.  In\r\nstating a single condition of Peace I mean simply to say that the War\r\nwill cease on the part of the Government, whenever it shall have ceased\r\non the part of those who began it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of December, 1864, in accordance with the terms of a\r\nConcurrent Resolution that had passed both Houses, Congress adjourned\r\nuntil January 5, 1865.  During the Congressional Recess, however, Mr.\r\nLincoln, anxious for the fate of the Thirteenth Amendment, exerted\r\nhimself, as it afterward appeared, to some purpose, in its behalf, by\r\ninviting private conferences with him, at the White House, of such of\r\nthe Border-State and other War-Democratic Representatives as had before\r\nvoted against the measure, but whose general character gave him ground\r\nfor hoping that they might not be altogether deaf to the voice of reason\r\nand patriotism.\r\n\r\n     [Among those for whom he sent was Mr. Rollins, of\r\n     Missouri, who afterward gave the following interesting account of\r\n     the interview:\r\n\r\n     \"The President had several times in my presence expressed his deep\r\n     anxiety in favor of the passage of this great measure.  He and\r\n     others had repeatedly counted votes in order to ascertain, as far\r\n     as they could, the strength of the measure upon a second trial in\r\n     the House.  He was doubtful about its passage, and some ten days or\r\n     two weeks before it came up for consideration in the House, I\r\n     received a note from him, written in pencil on a card, while\r\n     sitting at my desk in the House, stating that he wished to see me,\r\n     and asking that I call on him at the White House.  I responded that\r\n     I would be there the next morning at nine o'clock.\r\n\r\n     \"I was prompt in calling upon him and found him alone in his\r\n     office.  He received me in the most cordial manner, and said in his\r\n     usual familiar way: 'Rollins, I have been wanting to talk to you\r\n     for some time about the Thirteenth Amendment proposed to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, which will have to be voted on\r\n     now, before a great while.'\r\n\r\n     \"I said: 'Well, I am here, and ready to talk upon that subject.\r\n\r\n     \"He said: 'You and I were old Whigs, both of us followers of that\r\n     great statesman, Henry Clay, and I tell you I never had an opinion\r\n     upon the subject of Slavery in my life that I did not get from him.\r\n     I am very anxious that the War should be brought to a close at the\r\n     earliest possible date, and I don't believe this can be\r\n     accomplished as long as those fellows down South can rely upon\r\n     the Border-States to help them; but if the Members from the\r\n     Border-States would unite, at least enough of them to pass the\r\n     Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, they would soon see that\r\n     they could not expect much help from that quarter, and be willing\r\n     to give up their opposition and quit their War upon the Government;\r\n     that is my chief hope and main reliance to bring the War to a\r\n     speedy close, and I have sent for you as an old Whig friend to come\r\n     and see me, that I might make an appeal to you to vote for this\r\n     Amendment.  It is going to be very close; a few votes one way or\r\n     the other will decide it.'\r\n\r\n     \"To this, I responded: 'Mr. President, so far as I am concerned,\r\n     you need not have sent for me to ascertain my views on this\r\n     subject, for although I represent perhaps the strongest\r\n     Slave-district in Missouri, and have the misfortune to be one of the\r\n     largest Slave-owners in the country where I reside, I had already\r\n     determined to vote for the Amendment.\r\n\r\n     \"He arose from his chair, and grasping me by the hand, gave it a\r\n     hearty shake, and said: 'I am most delighted to hear that.'\r\n\r\n     \"He asked me how many more of the Missouri delegates in the House\r\n     would vote for it.\r\n\r\n     \"I said I could not tell; the Republicans of course would; General\r\n     Loan, Mr. Blow, Mr. Boyd, and Colonel McClurg.\r\n\r\n     \"He said, 'Won't General Price vote for it?  He is a good Union\r\n     man.' I said I could not answer.\r\n\r\n     \"'Well, what about General King?'\r\n\r\n     \"I told him I did not know.\r\n\r\n     \"He then asked about Judges Hall and Norton.\r\n\r\n     \"I said they would both vote against it, I thought.\r\n\r\n     \"'Well,' he said, 'are you on good terms with Price and King?'\r\n\r\n     \"I responded in the affirmative, and that I was on easy terms with\r\n     the entire delegation.\r\n\r\n     \"He then asked me if I would not talk with those who might be\r\n     persuaded to vote for the amendment, and report to him as soon as I\r\n     could find out what the prospect was.'\r\n\r\n     \"I answered that I would do so with pleasure, and remarked at the\r\n     same time, that when I was a young man, in 1848, I was the Whig\r\n     competitor of King for Governor of Missouri, and, as he beat me\r\n     very badly, I thought now he should pay me back by voting as I\r\n     desired him on this important question.\r\n\r\n     \"I promised the President I would talk to this gentleman upon the\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     \"He said: 'I would like you to talk to all the Border-State men\r\n     whom you can approach properly, and tell them of my anxiety to have\r\n     the measure pass; and let me know the prospect of the Border-State\r\n     vote,' which I promised to do.\r\n\r\n     \"He again said: 'The passage of this Amendment will clinch the\r\n     whole subject; it will bring the War, I have no doubt, rapidly to a\r\n     close.'\"--Arnold's Life of Lincoln, pp. 358-359,]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of January, 1865, the Christmas Recess having expired,\r\nCongress re-assembled.  The motion to reconsider the vote-by which the\r\nJoint Resolution, to amend the Constitution by the abolition of Slavery,\r\nhad been defeated--was not called up, on that day, as its friends had\r\nnot all returned; but the time was mainly consumed in able speeches, by\r\nMr. Creswell of Maryland, and Stevens of Pennsylvania, in which the\r\nformer declared that \"whether we would or not, we must establish Freedom\r\nif we would exterminate Treason.  Events have left us no choice.  The\r\nPeople have learned their duty and have instructed us accordingly.\"  And\r\nMr. Thaddeus Stevens solemnly said: \"We are about to ascertain the\r\nNational will, by another vote to amend the Constitution.  If gentlemen\r\nopposite will yield to the voice of God and Humanity, and vote for it, I\r\nverily believe the sword of the Destroying Angel will be stayed, and\r\nthis People be reunited.  If we still harden our hearts, and blood must\r\nstill flow, may the ghosts of the slaughtered victims sit heavily upon\r\nthe souls of those who cause it!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, Mr. Ashley called up his motion to reconsider the\r\nvote defeating the Thirteenth Amendment, and opened the debate with a\r\nlengthy and able speech in favor of that measure, in concluding which he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The genius of history, with iron pen, is waiting to record our verdict\r\nwhere it will remain forever for all the coming generations of men to\r\napprove or condemn.  God grant that this verdict may be one over which\r\nthe friends of Liberty, impartial and universal, in this Country and\r\nEurope, and in every Land beneath the sun, may rejoice; a verdict which\r\nshall declare that America is Free; a verdict which shall add another\r\nday of jubilee, and the brightest of all, to our National calendar.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate was participated in by nearly all the prominent men, on both\r\nsides of the House--the speeches of Messrs. Cox, Brooks, Voorhees,\r\nMallory, Holman, Woods and Pendleton being the most notable, in\r\nopposition to, and those of Scofield, Rollins, Garfield and Stevens,\r\nin favor of, the Amendment.  That of Scofield probably stirred up \"the\r\nadversary\" more thoroughly than any other; that of Rollins was more\r\ncalculated to conciliate and capture the votes of hesitating, or\r\nBorder-State men; that of Garfield was perhaps the most scholarly and\r\neloquent; while that of Stevens was remarkable for its sledge-hammer\r\npungency and characteristic brevity.\r\n\r\nMr. Pendleton, toward the end of his speech, had said of Mr. Stevens:\r\n\"Let him be careful, lest when the passions of these times be passed\r\naway, and the historian shall go back to discover where was the original\r\ninfraction of the Constitution, he may find that sin lies at the door of\r\nothers than the people now in arms.\"  And it was this that brought the\r\nsterling old Patriot again to his feet, in vindication of the acts of\r\nhis liberty-inspired life, and in defense of the power to amend the\r\nConstitution, which had been assailed.\r\n\r\nThe personal antithesis with which he concluded his remarks was in\r\nitself most dramatically effective, Said he:\r\n\r\n\"So far as the appeals of the learned gentleman (Mr. Pendleton) are\r\nconcerned, in his pathetic winding up, I will be willing to take my\r\nchance, when we all moulder in the dust.  He may have his epitaph\r\nwritten, if it be truly written, 'Here rests the ablest and most\r\npertinacious defender of Slavery, and opponent of Liberty;' and I will\r\nbe satisfied if my epitaph shall be written thus: 'Here lies one who\r\nnever rose to any eminence, and who only courted the low ambition to\r\nhave it said that he had striven to ameliorate the condition of the\r\npoor, the lowly, the downtrodden, of every race, and language, and\r\ncolor.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said these words, the crowded floors and galleries broke out into\r\ninvoluntary applause for the grand \"Old Commoner\"--who only awaited its\r\ncessation, to caustically add: \"I shall be content, with such a eulogy\r\non his lofty tomb and such an inscription on my humble grave, to trust\r\nour memories to the judgment of after ages.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate, frequently interrupted by Appropriation Bills, and other\r\nimportant and importunate measures, lasted until the 31st of January,\r\nwhen Mr. Ashley called the previous question on his motion to\r\nreconsider.\r\n\r\nMr. Stiles at once moved to table the motion to reconsider.  Mr.\r\nStiles's motion was lost by 57 yeas to 111 nays.  This was in the nature\r\nof a test-vote, and the result, when announced, was listened to, with\r\nbreathless attention, by the crowded House and galleries.  It was too\r\nclose for either side to be satisfied; but it showed a gain to the\r\nfriends of the Amendment; that was something.  How the final vote would\r\nbe, none could tell.  Meanwhile it was known, from the announcements on\r\nthe floor, that Rogers was absent through his own illness and Voorhees\r\nthrough illness in his family.\r\n\r\nThe previous question being seconded and the main question ordered, the\r\nyeas and nays were called on the motion to reconsider--and the intense\r\nsilence succeeding the monotonous calling of the names was broken by the\r\nvoice of the Speaker declaring the motion to reconsider, carried, by 112\r\nyeas to 57 nays.\r\n\r\nThis vote created a slight sensation.  There was a gain of one,\r\n(English), at any rate, from among those not voting on the previous\r\nmotion.  Now, if there should be but the change of a single vote, from\r\nthe nays to the yeas, the Amendment would be carried!\r\n\r\nThe most intensely anxious solicitude was on nearly every face, as Mr.\r\nMallory, at this critical moment, made the point of order that \"a vote\r\nto reconsider the vote by which the subject now before the House was\r\ndisposed of, in June last, requires two-thirds of this Body,\" and\r\nemphatically added: \"that two-thirds vote has not been obtained.\"\r\n\r\nA sigh of relief swept across the galleries, as the Speaker overruled\r\nthe point of order.  Other attempted interruptions being resolutely met\r\nand defeated by Mr. Ashley, in charge of the Resolution, the \"previous\r\nquestion\" was demanded, seconded, and the main question ordered--which\r\nwas on the passage of the Resolution.\r\n\r\nAnd now, amid the hush of a breathless and intent anxiety--so absolute\r\nthat the scratch of the recording pencil could be heard--the Clerk\r\ncommenced to call the roll!\r\n\r\nSo consuming was the solicitude, on all sides, for the fate of this\r\nportentous measure, that fully one-half the Representatives kept tally\r\nat their desks as the vote proceeded, while the heads of the gathered\r\nthousands of both sexes, in the galleries, craned forward, as though\r\nfearing to lose the startlingly clear responses, while the roll-call\r\nprogressed.\r\n\r\nWhen it reached the name of English--Governor English, a Connecticut\r\nDemocrat, who had not voted on the first motion, to table the motion to\r\nreconsider, but had voted \"yea\" on the motion to reconsider,--and he\r\nresponded with a clear-cut \"aye\" on the passage of the Resolution--it\r\nlooked as though light were coming at last, and applause involuntarily\r\nbroke forth from the Republican side of the floor, spreading instantly\r\nto the galleries, despite the efforts of the Speaker to preserve order.\r\n\r\nSo, when Ganson of New York, and other Democrats, voted \"aye,\" the\r\napplause was renewed again and again, and still louder again, when, with\r\nsmiling face--which corroborated the thrilling, fast-spreading, whisper,\r\nthat \"the Amendment is safe!\"--Speaker Colfax directed the Clerk to call\r\nhis name, as a member of the House, and, in response to that call, voted\r\n\"aye!\"\r\n\r\nThen came dead silence, as the Clerk passed the result to the Speaker\r\n--during which a pin might have been heard to drop,--broken at last by the\r\nSpeaker's ringing voice: \"The Constitutional majority of two-thirds\r\nhaving voted in the affirmative, the Joint Resolution is passed.\"\r\n\r\n     [The enrolled Resolution received the approval and signature of the\r\n     President, Feb. 1, 1865,]\r\n\r\nThe words had scarcely left the Speaker's lips, when House and galleries\r\nsprang to their feet, clapping their hands, stamping their feet, waving\r\nhats and handkerchiefs, and cheering so loudly and so long that it\r\nseemed as if this great outburst of enthusiasm--indulged in, in defiance\r\nof all parliamentary rules--would never cease!\r\n\r\nIn his efforts to control it, Speaker Colfax hammered the desk until he\r\nnearly broke his mallet.  Finally, by 4 o'clock, P.M., after several\r\nminutes of useless effort--during which the pounding of the mallet was\r\nutterly lost in the noisy enthusiasm and excitement, in which both the\r\nFreedom-loving men and women of the Land, there present, participated\r\n--the Speaker at last succeeded in securing a lull.\r\n\r\nAdvantage was instantly taken of it, by the successor of the dead Owen\r\nLovejoy, Mr. Ingersoll of Illinois, his young face flushing with the\r\nglow of patriotism, as he cried: \"Mr. Speaker!  In honor of this\r\nImmortal and Sublime Event I move that the House do now adjourn.\"  The\r\nSpeaker declared the motion carried, amid renewed demonstrations of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nDuring all these uncontrollable ebullitions of popular feeling in behalf\r\nof personal Liberty and National Freedom and strength, the Democratic\r\nmembers of the House had sat, many of them moving uneasily in their\r\nseats, with chagrin painted in deep lines upon their faces, while others\r\nwere bolt upright, as if riveted to their chairs, looking straight\r\nbefore them at the Speaker, in a vain attempt, belied by the pallid\r\nanger of their set countenances, to appear unconscious of the storm of\r\npopular feeling breaking around them, which they now doggedly perceived\r\nmight be but a forecast of the joyful enthusiasm which on that day, and\r\non the morrow, would spread from one end of the Land to the other.\r\n\r\nHarris, of Maryland, made a sort of \"Last Ditch\" protest against\r\nadjournment, by demanding the \"yeas and nays\" on the motion to adjourn.\r\nThe motion was, however, carried, by 121 yeas to 24 nays; and, as the\r\nmembers left their places in the Hall--many of them to hurry with their\r\nhearty congratulations to President Lincoln at the White House--the\r\ntriumph, in the Halls of our National Congress, of Freedom and Justice\r\nand Civilization, over Slavery and Tyranny and Barbarism, was already\r\nbeing saluted by the booming of one hundred guns on Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nHow large a share was Mr. Lincoln's, in that triumph, these pages have\r\nalready sufficiently indicated.  Sweet indeed must have been the joy\r\nthat thrilled his whole being, when, sitting in the White House, he\r\nheard the bellowing artillery attest the success of his labors in behalf\r\nof Emancipation.  Proud indeed must he have felt when, the following\r\nnight, in response to the loud and jubilant cries of \"Lincoln!\"\r\n\"Lincoln!\" \"Abe Lincoln!\" \"Uncle Abe!\" and other affectionate calls,\r\nfrom a great concourse of people who, with music, had assembled outside\r\nthe White House to give him a grand serenade and popular ovation, he\r\nappeared at an open window, bowed to the tumult of their acclamations,\r\nand declared that \"The great Job is ended!\"--adding, among other things,\r\nthat the occasion was one fit for congratulation, and, said he, \"I\r\ncannot but congratulate all present--myself, the Country, and the whole\r\nWorld--upon this great moral victory. * * * This ends the Job!\"\r\n\r\nSubstantially the job was ended.  There was little doubt, after such a\r\nsend off, by the President and by Congress, in view of the character of\r\nthe State Legislatures, as well as the temper of the People, that the\r\nrequisite number of States would be secured to ratify the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment.  Already, on the 1st of February, that is to say, on the very\r\nday of this popular demonstration at the Executive Mansion, the\r\nPresident's own State, Illinois, had ratified it--and this circumstance\r\nadded to the satisfaction and happiness which beamed from, and almost\r\nmade beautiful, his homely face.\r\n\r\nOther States quickly followed; Maryland, on February 1st and 3rd; Rhode\r\nIsland and Michigan, on February 2nd; New York, February 2nd and 3rd;\r\nWest Virginia, February 3rd; Maine and Kansas, February 7th;\r\nMassachusetts and Pennsylvania, February 8th; Virginia, February 9th;\r\nOhio and Missouri, February 10th; Nevada and Indiana, February 16th;\r\nLouisiana, February 17th; Minnesota, February 8th and 23rd; Wisconsin,\r\nMarch 1st; Vermont, March 9th; Tennessee, April 5th and 7th; Arkansas,\r\nApril 20th; Connecticut, May 5th; New Hampshire, July 1st; South\r\nCarolina, November 13th; Alabama, December 2nd; North Carolina, December\r\n4th; Georgia, December 9th; Oregon, December 11th; California, December\r\n20th; and Florida, December 28th;--all in 1865; with New Jersey, closely\r\nfollowing, on January 23rd; and Iowa, January 24th;--in 1866.\r\n\r\nLong ere this last date, however, the Secretary of State (Mr. Seward)\r\nhad been able to, and did, announce (November 18, 1865) the ratification\r\nof the Amendment by the requisite number of States, and certified that\r\nthe same had \"become, to all intents and purposes, valid as a part of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nNot until then, was \"the job\" absolutely ended; but, as has been already\r\nmentioned, it was, at the time Mr. Lincoln spoke, as good as ended.  It\r\nwas a foregone conclusion, that the great end for which he, and so many\r\nother great and good men of the Republic had for so many years been\r\nearnestly striving, would be an accomplished fact.  They had not failed;\r\nthey had stood firm; the victory which he had predicted six years before\r\nhad come!\r\n\r\n     [He had said in his Springfield speech, of 1858: \"We\r\n     shall not fail; if we stand firm we shall not fail; wise counsels\r\n     may accelerate, or mistakes delay, but sooner or later the Victory\r\n     is sure to come.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n                     LINCOLN'S SECOND INAUGURATION.\r\n\r\nWhile the death of Slavery in America was decreed, as we have seen; yet,\r\nthe sanguine anticipations of Mr. Lincoln, and other friends of Freedom,\r\nthat such a decree, imperishably grafted into the Constitution, must at\r\nonce end the Rebellion, and bring Peace with a restored Union, were not\r\nrealized.  The War went on.  Grant was still holding Lee, at Petersburg,\r\nnear Richmond, while Sherman's victorious Army was about entering upon a\r\ncampaign from Savannah, up through the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous Summer, efforts had been made, by Horace Greeley,\r\nand certain parties supposed to represent the Rebel authorities, to lay\r\nthe ground-work for an early Peace and adjustment of the differences\r\nbetween the Government of the United States and the Rebels, but they\r\nmiscarried.  They led, however, to the publication of the following\r\nimportant conciliatory Presidential announcement:\r\n\r\n                              \"EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n                              \"WASHINGTON, July 18, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"To whom it may concern:\r\n\r\n\"Any proposition which embraces the restoration of Peace, the integrity\r\nof the whole Union, and the abandonment of Slavery, and which comes by\r\nand with an authority that can control the Armies now at War against the\r\nUnited States, will be received and considered by the Executive\r\nGovernment of the United States, and will be met by liberal terms on\r\nsubstantial and collateral points; and the bearer or bearers thereof\r\nshall have safe conduct both ways.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, other efforts were being made, with a similar\r\nobject in view, but which came to naught.  The visit of Messrs. Jacques\r\nand Gilmore to the Rebel Capital on an informal Peace-errand was, at\r\nleast, valuable in this, that it secured from the head and front of the\r\narmed Conspiracy, Jefferson Davis himself, the following definite\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"I desire Peace as much as you do; I deplore bloodshed as much as you\r\ndo; but I feel that not one drop of the blood shed in this War is on my\r\nhands.  I can look up to my God and say this.  I tried all in my power\r\nto avert this War.  I saw it coming, and for twelve years I worked night\r\nand day to prevent it; but I could not.  The North was mad and blind; it\r\nwould not let us govern ourselves; and so the War came: and now it must\r\ngo on till the last man of this generation falls in his tracks, and his\r\nchildren seize his musket and fight our battle, unless you acknowledge\r\nour right to self-government.  We are not fighting for Slavery.  We are\r\nfighting for INDEPENDENCE; and that, or EXTERMINATION, we WILL have.\"\r\n\r\n     [The Nation, July 2, 1885, contained the following\r\n     remarks, which may be pertinently quoted in support of this\r\n     authoritative statement that the South was \"not fighting for\r\n     Slavery,\" but for Independence--that is to say: for Power, and what\r\n     would flow from it.]\r\n\r\n     [\"The Charleston News and Courier a fortnight ago remarked that\r\n     'not more than one Southern soldier in ten or fifteen was a\r\n     Slaveholder, or had any interest in Slave Property.'  The\r\n     Laurensville Herald disputed the statement, and declared that 'the\r\n     Southern Army was really an Army of Slaveholders and the sons of\r\n     Slaveholders.'  The Charleston paper stands by its original\r\n     position, and cites figures which are conclusive.  The Military\r\n     population of the eleven States which seceded, according to the\r\n     census of 1860, was 1,064,193.  The entire number of Slaveholders\r\n     in the Country at the same time was 383,637, but of these 77,335\r\n     lived in the Border States, so that the number in the Seceding\r\n     States was only 306,302.  Most of the small Slaveholders, however,\r\n     were not Slave-owners, but Slave hirers, and Mr. De Bow, the\r\n     statistician who supervised the census of 1850, estimated that but\r\n     little over half the holders were actually owners.  The proportion\r\n     of owners diminished between 1850 and 1860, and the News and\r\n     Courier thinks that there were not more than 150,000 Slave-owners\r\n     in the Confederate States when the War broke out.  This would be\r\n     one owner to every seven White males between eighteen and\r\n     forty-five; but as many of the owners were women, and many of the\r\n     men were relieved from Military service, the Charleston paper is\r\n     confirmed in its original opinion that there were ten men in the\r\n     Southern Army who were not Slave-owners for every soldier who had\r\n     Slaves of his own.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd when these self-constituted Peace-delegates had fulfilled the duty\r\nwhich their zeal had impelled them to perform, and were taking their\r\nleave of the Rebel chieftain, Jefferson Davis added:\r\n\r\n\"Say to Mr. Lincoln, from me, that I shall at any time be pleased to\r\nreceive proposals for PEACE on the basis of our INDEPENDENCE.  It will\r\nbe useless to approach me with any other.\"\r\n\r\nThus the lines had been definitely and distinctly drawn, on both sides.\r\nThe issue of Slavery became admittedly, as between the Government and\r\nthe Rebels, a dead one.  The great cardinal issue was now clearly seen\r\nand authoritatively admitted to be, \"the integrity of the whole Union\"\r\non the one side, and on the other, \"Independence of a part of it.\"\r\nThese precise declarations did great good to the Union Cause in the\r\nNorth, and not only helped the triumphant re-election of Mr. Lincoln,\r\nbut also contributed to weaken the position of the Northern advocates of\r\nSlavery, and to bring about, as we have seen, the extinction of that\r\ninherited National curse, by Constitutional Amendment.\r\n\r\nDuring January, of 1865, Francis P. Blair having been permitted to pass\r\nboth the Union and Rebel Army lines, showed to Mr. Lincoln a letter,\r\nwritten to the former, by Jefferson Davis--and which the latter had\r\nauthorized him to read to the President--stating that he had always\r\nbeen, and was still, ready to send or to receive Commissioners \"to enter\r\ninto a Conference, with a view to secure Peace to the two Countries.\"\r\nOn the 18th of that month, purposing to having it shown to Jefferson\r\nDavis, Mr. Lincoln wrote to Mr. Blair a letter in which, after referring\r\nto Mr. Davis, he said: \"You may say to him that I have constantly been,\r\nam now, and shall continue, ready to receive any agent whom he, or any\r\nother influential person now resisting the National Authority, may\r\ninformally send to me, with the view of securing Peace to the People of\r\nour common Country.\"  On the 21st of January, Mr. Blair was again in\r\nRichmond; and Mr. Davis had read and retained Mr. Lincoln's letter to\r\nBlair, who specifically drew the Rebel chieftain's attention to the fact\r\nthat \"the part about 'our common Country' related to the part of Mr.\r\nDavis's letter about 'the two Countries,' to which Mr. Davis replied\r\nthat he so understood it.\"  Yet subsequently, he sent Messrs.  Alexander\r\nH.  Stephens, R. M. T.  Hunter, and John A.  Campbell as Commissioners,\r\nwith instructions, (January 28, 1865,) which, after setting forth the\r\nlanguage of Mr. Lincoln's letter, proceeded strangely enough to say: \"In\r\nconformity with the letter of Mr. Lincoln, of which the foregoing is a\r\ncopy, you are to proceed to Washington city for informal Conference with\r\nhim upon the issues involved in the existing War, and for the purpose of\r\nsecuring Peace to the two Countries!\"  The Commissioners themselves\r\nstated in writing that \"The substantial object to be obtained by the\r\ninformal Conference is, to ascertain upon what terms the existing War\r\ncan be terminated honorably.  * * * Our earnest desire is, that a just\r\nand honorable Peace may be agreed upon, and we are prepared to receive\r\nor to submit propositions which may, possibly, lead to the attainment of\r\nthat end.\"  In consequence of this peculiarly \"mixed\" overture, the\r\nPresident sent Secretary Seward to Fortress Monroe, to informally confer\r\nwith the parties, specifically instructing him to \"make known to them\r\nthat three things are indispensable, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"1.  The restoration of the National Authority throughout all the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"2.  No receding, by the Executive of the United States, on the Slavery\r\nquestion, from the position assumed thereon in the late Annual Message\r\nto Congress, and in preceding documents.\r\n\r\n\"3.  No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the War and the\r\ndisbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln also instructed the Secretary to \"inform them that all\r\npropositions of theirs, not inconsistent with the above, will be\r\nconsidered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere liberality;\" to \"hear\r\nall they may choose to say, and report it\" to him, and not to \"assume to\r\ndefinitely consummate anything.\"  Subsequently, the President, in\r\nconsequence of a dispatch from General Grant to Secretary Stanton,\r\ndecided to go himself to Fortress Monroe.\r\n\r\n     Following is the dispatch:\r\n\r\n     [In Cipher]\r\n\r\n     OFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH.  WAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n     \"The following telegram received at Washington, 4.35 A.M., February\r\n     2, 1865.  From City Point, Va., February 1, 10.30 P.M., 1865\r\n\r\n     \"Now that the interview between Major Eckert, under his written\r\n     instructions, and Mr. Stephens and party has ended, I will state\r\n     confidentially, but not officially, to become a matter of record,\r\n     that I am convinced, upon conversation with Messrs. Stephens and\r\n     Hunter, that their intentions are good and their desire sincere to\r\n     restore Peace and Union.  I have not felt myself at liberty to\r\n     express, even, views of my own, or to account for my reticency.\r\n     This has placed me in an awkward position, which I could have\r\n     avoided by not seeing them in the first instance.  I fear now their\r\n     going back without any expression from any one in authority will\r\n     have a bad influence.  At the same time I recognize the\r\n     difficulties in the way of receiving these informal Commissioners\r\n     at this time, and do not know what to recommend.  I am sorry,\r\n     however, that Mr. Lincoln cannot have an interview with the two\r\n     named in this dispatch, if not all three now within our lines.\r\n     Their letter to me was all that the President's instructions\r\n     contemplated to secure their safe conduct, if they had used the\r\n     same language to Major Eckert.\r\n\r\n                                   \"U. S. GRANT,\r\n                                   \"Lieutenant General.\r\n\r\n     \"Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n     \"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Stephens is stated by a Georgia paper to have repeated the\r\n     following characteristic anecdote of what occurred during the\r\n     interview.  \"The three Southern gentlemen met Mr. Lincoln and Mr.\r\n     Seward, and after some preliminary remarks, the subject of Peace\r\n     was opened.  Mr. Stephens, well aware that one who asks much may\r\n     get more than he who confesses to humble wishes at the outset,\r\n     urged the claims of his Section with that skill and address for\r\n     which the Northern papers have given him credit.  Mr. Lincoln,\r\n     holding the vantage ground of conscious power, was, however,\r\n     perfectly frank, and submitted his views almost in the form of an\r\n     argument.  * * * Davis had, on this occasion, as on that of Mr.\r\n     Stephens's visit to Washington, made it a condition that no\r\n     Conference should be had unless his rank as Commander or President\r\n     should first be recognized.  Mr. Lincoln declared that the only\r\n     ground on which he could rest the justice of War--either with his\r\n     own people, or with foreign powers--was that it was not a War for\r\n     conquest, for that the States had never been separated from the\r\n     Union.  Consequently, he could not recognize another Government\r\n     inside of the one of which he alone was President; nor admit the\r\n     separate Independence of States that were yet a part of the Union.\r\n     'That' said he 'would be doing what you have so long asked Europe\r\n     to do in vain, and be resigning the only thing the Armies of the\r\n     Union have been fighting for.'  Mr. Hunter made a long reply to\r\n     this, insisting that the recognition of Davis's power to make a\r\n     Treaty was the first and indispensable step to Peace, and referred\r\n     to the correspondence between King Charles I., and his Parliament,\r\n     as a trustworthy precedent of a Constitutional ruler treating with\r\n     Rebels.  Mr. Lincoln's face then wore that indescribable expression\r\n     which generally preceded his hardest hits, and he remarked: 'Upon\r\n     questions of history I must refer you to Mr. Seward, for he is\r\n     posted in such things, and I don't pretend to be bright.  My only\r\n     distinct recollection of the matter is that Charles lost his head,'\r\n     That settled Mr. Hunter for a while.\" Arnold's Lincoln, p. 400.\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 2nd, Mr. Lincoln reached Hampton Roads, and\r\njoined Secretary Seward on board a steamer anchored off the shore.  The\r\nnext morning, from another steamer, similarly anchored, Messrs.\r\nStephens, Hunter, and Campbell were brought aboard the President's\r\nsteamer and a Conference with the President and Secretary of several\r\nhours' duration was the result.  Mr. Lincoln's own statement of what\r\ntranspired was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"No question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or\r\nmentioned.  No other person was present; no papers were exchanged or\r\nproduced; and it was, in advance, agreed that the conversation was to be\r\ninformal and verbal merely.  On our part, the whole substance of the\r\ninstructions to the Secretary of State, hereinbefore recited, was stated\r\nand insisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith; while,\r\nby the other party, it was not said that in any event or on any\r\ncondition, they ever would consent to Re-union; and yet they equally\r\nomitted to declare that they never would so consent.  They seemed to\r\ndesire a postponement of that question, and the adoption of some other\r\ncourse first, which, as some of them seemed to argue, might or might not\r\nlead to Reunion; but which course, we thought, would amount to an\r\nindefinite postponement.  The Conference ended without result.\"\r\n\r\nIn his communication to the Rebel Congress at Richmond, February 6.\r\n1865, Jefferson Davis, after mentioning his appointment of Messrs.\r\nStephens, Hunter and Campbell, for the purpose stated, proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n\"I herewith transmit, for the information of Congress, the report of the\r\neminent citizens above named, showing that the Enemy refused to enter\r\ninto negotiations with the Confederate States, or any one of them\r\nseparately, or to give to our people any other terms or guarantees than\r\nthose which the conqueror may grant, or to permit us to have Peace on\r\nany other basis than our unconditional submission to their rule, coupled\r\nwith the acceptance of their recent legislation on the subject of the\r\nrelations between the White and Black population of each State.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th and 9th of February, public meetings were held at Richmond,\r\nin connection with these Peace negotiations.  At the first, Jefferson\r\nDavis made a speech in which the Richmond Dispatch reported him as\r\nemphatically asserting that no conditions of Peace \"save the\r\nIndependence of the Confederacy could ever receive his sanction.  He\r\ndoubted not that victory would yet crown our labors, * * * and sooner\r\nthan we should ever be united again he would be willing to yield up\r\neverything he had on Earth, and if it were possible would sacrifice a\r\nthousand lives before he would succumb.\"  Thereupon the meeting of\r\nRebels passed resolutions \"spurning\" Mr. Lincoln's terms \"with the\r\nindignation due to so gross an insult;\" declared that the circumstances\r\nconnected with his offer could only \"add to the outrage and stamp it as\r\na designed and premeditated indignity\" offered to them; and invoking\r\n\"the aid of Almighty God\" to carry out their \"resolve to maintain\" their\r\n\"Liberties and Independence\"--to which, said they, \"we mutually pledge\r\nour lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\"  So too, at the second\r\nof these meetings, presided over by R. M. T. Hunter, and addressed by\r\nthe Rebel Secretary Judah P. Benjamin, resolutions were adopted amid\r\n\"wild and long continued cheering,\" one of which stated that they would\r\n\"never lay down\" their \"arms until\" their \"Independence\" had \"been won,\"\r\nwhile another declared a full confidence in the sufficiency of their\r\nresources to \"conduct the War successfully and to that issue,\" and\r\ninvoked \"the People, in the name of the holiest of all causes, to spare\r\nneither their blood nor their treasure in its maintenance and support.\"\r\n\r\nAs during these Peace negotiations, General Grant, by express direction\r\nof President Lincoln, had not changed, hindered, nor delayed, any of his\r\n\"Military movements or plans,\" so, now that the negotiations had failed,\r\nthose Military movements were pressed more strenuously than ever.\r\n\r\n     [The main object of this Conference on the part of the Rebels was\r\n     to secure an immediate truce, or breathing spell, during which they\r\n     could get themselves in better condition for continuing the War.\r\n     Indeed a portion of Mr. Seward's letter of Feb. 7, 1865, to Mr.\r\n     Adams, our Minister at the Court of St. James, giving him an\r\n     account of the Conference with the party of Insurgent\r\n     Commissioners, would not alone indicate this, but also that it was\r\n     proposed by that \"Insurgent party,\" that both sides, during the\r\n     time they would thus cease to fight one another, might profitably\r\n     combine their forces to drive the French invaders out of Mexico and\r\n     annex that valuable country.  At least, the following passage in\r\n     that letter will bear that construction:\r\n\r\n     \"What the Insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor was a\r\n     postponement of the question of separation, upon which the War is\r\n     waged, and a mutual direction of efforts of the Government, as well\r\n     as those of the Insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for\r\n     a season, during which passions might be expected to subside, and\r\n     the Armies be reduced, and trade and intercourse between the People\r\n     of both Sections resumed.  It was suggested by them that through\r\n     such postponements we might now have immediate Peace, with some not\r\n     very certain prospect of an ultimate satisfactory adjustment of\r\n     political relations between this Government, and the States,\r\n     Section, or People, now engaged in conflict with it.\"\r\n\r\n     For the whole of this letter see McPherson's History of the\r\n     Rebellion, p.  570.]\r\n\r\nFort Fisher, North Carolina, had already been captured by a combined\r\nMilitary and Naval attack of the Union forces under General Terry and\r\nAdmiral Porter; and Sherman's Army was now victoriously advancing from\r\nSavannah, Georgia, Northwardly through South Carolina.  On the 17th of\r\nFebruary, Columbia, the capital of the latter State, surrendered, and,\r\nthe day following, Charleston was evacuated, and its defenses, including\r\nhistoric Fort Sumter, were once more under that glorious old flag of the\r\nUnion which four years before had been driven away, by shot and shell\r\nand flame, amid the frantic exultations of the temporarily successful\r\narmed Conspirators of South Carolina.  On the 22nd of February, General\r\nSchofield, who had been sent by Grant with his 23rd Corps, by water, to\r\nform a junction with Terry's troops about Fort Fisher, and capture\r\nWilmington, North Carolina, had also accomplished his purpose\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel Cause now began to look pretty desperate, even to Rebel eyes.\r\n\r\n     [Hundreds of Rebels were now deserting from Lee's Armies about\r\n     Richmond, every night, owing partly to despondency.  \"These\r\n     desertions,\" wrote Lee, on the 24th February, \"have a very bad\r\n     effect upon the troops who remain, and give rise to painful\r\n     apprehensions.\"  Another cause was the lack of food and clothing.\r\n     Says Badeau (Military History of Ulysses S. Grant, vol.  iii., p.\r\n     399): \"On the 8th of January, Lee wrote to the Rebel Government\r\n     that the entire Right Wing of his Army had been in line for three\r\n     days and nights, in the most inclement weather of the season.\r\n     'Under these circumstances,' he said, 'heightened by assaults and\r\n     fire of the Enemy, some of the men had been without meat for three\r\n     days, and all were suffering from reduced rations and scant\r\n     clothing.  Colonel Cole, chief commissary, reports that he has not\r\n     a pound of meat at his disposal.  If some change is not made, and\r\n     the commissary department reorganized, I apprehend dire results.\r\n     The physical strength of the men, if their courage survives, must\r\n     fail under this treatment.  Our Cavalry has to be dispersed for\r\n     want of forage.  Fitz Lee's and Lomax's Divisions are scattered\r\n     because supplies cannot be transported where their services are\r\n     required.  I had to bring Fitz Lee's Division sixty miles Sunday\r\n     night, to get them in position.  Taking these facts in connection\r\n     with the paucity of our numbers, you must not be surprised if\r\n     calamity befalls us.'\" Badeau's (Grant, vol.  iii., p. 401,)]\r\n\r\nToward the end of February, the Rebel General Longstreet having\r\nrequested an interview with General Ord \"to arrange for the exchange of\r\ncitizen prisoners, and prisoners of war, improperly captured,\" General\r\nGrant authorized General Ord to hold such interview t and \"to arrange\r\ndefinitely for such as were confined in his department, arrangements for\r\nall others to be submitted for approval.\"  In the course of that\r\ninterview \"a general conversation ensued on the subject of the War,\"\r\nwhen it would seem that Longstreet suggested the idea of a composition\r\nof the questions at issue, and Peace between the United States and the\r\nRebels, by means of a Military Convention.  It is quite probable that\r\nthis idea originated with Jefferson Davis, as a /dernier resort/; for\r\nLongstreet appears to have communicated directly with Davis concerning\r\nhis interview or \"interviews\" with Ord.  On the 28th of February, 1865\r\nthe Rebel Chief wrote to Lee, as follows:\r\n\r\n                         \"RICHMOND, VA., February 28.\r\n\r\n\"Gen. R. E. LEE, Commanding, etc.,\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: You will learn by the letter of General Longstreet the result\r\nof his second interview with General Ord.  The points as to whether\r\nyourself or General Grant should invite the other to a Conference is not\r\nworth discussing.  If you think the statements of General Ord render it\r\nprobably useful that the Conference suggested should be had, you will\r\nproceed as you may prefer, and are clothed with all the supplemental\r\nauthority you may need in the consideration of any proposition for a\r\nMilitary Convention, or the appointment of a Commissioner to enter into\r\nsuch an arrangement as will cause at least temporary suspension of\r\nhostilities.\r\n                         \"Very truly yours\r\n                                   \"JEFFERSON DAVIS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThereupon General Lee wrote, and sent to General Grant, the following\r\ncommunication:\r\n\r\n               \"HEADQUARTERS C.

Sincerely desirous to leave\r\nnothing untried which may put an end to the calamities of War, I propose\r\nto meet you at such convenient time and place as you may designate, with\r\nthe hope that, upon an interchange of views, it may be found practicable\r\nto submit the subjects of controversy between the belligerents to a\r\nConvention of the kind mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"In such event, I am authorized to do whatever the result of the\r\nproposed interview may render necessary or advisable.  Should you accede\r\nto this proposition, I would suggest that, if agreeable to you, we meet\r\nat the place selected by Generals Ord and Longstreet, for the interview,\r\nat 11 A.M., on Monday next.\r\n\r\n               \"Very respectfully your obedient servant,\r\n                              \"R. E. LEE, General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of this letter, General Grant sent a telegraphic dispatch\r\nto Secretary Stanton, informing him of Lee's proposition.  It reached\r\nthe Secretary of War just before midnight of March 3rd.  He, and the\r\nother members of the Cabinet were with the President, in the latter's\r\nroom at the Capitol, whither they had gone on this, the last, night of\r\nthe last Session of the Thirty-Eighth Congress, the Cabinet to advise,\r\nand the President to act, upon bills submitted to him for approval.  The\r\nSecretary, after reading the dispatch, handed it to Mr. Lincoln.  The\r\nlatter read and thought over it briefly, and then himself  wrote the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, March, 3, 1865, 12 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT: The President directs me to say to you that\r\nhe wishes you to have no Conference with General Lee, unless it be for\r\nthe capitulation of General Lee's Army, or on some other minor and\r\npurely Military matter.  He instructs me to say to you that you are not\r\nto decide, discuss, or confer upon any political question.  Such\r\nquestions the President holds in his own hands, and will submit them to\r\nno Military Conferences or Conventions.  Meanwhile you are to press to\r\nthe utmost your Military advantages.\r\n                              \"EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n                              \"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant received this dispatch, on the day following, and at once\r\nwrote and sent to General Lee a communication in which, after referring\r\nto the subject of the exchange of prisoners, he said: \"In regard to\r\nmeeting you on the 6th inst., I would state that--I have no authority to\r\naccede to your proposition for a Conference on the subject proposed.\r\nSuch authority is vested in the President of the United States alone.\r\nGeneral Ord could only have meant that I would not refuse an interview\r\non any subject on which I have a right to act; which, of course, would\r\nbe such as are purely of a Military character, and on the subject of\r\nexchange, which has been entrusted to me.\"\r\n\r\nThus perished the last reasonable hope entertained by the Rebel\r\nChieftains to ward off the inevitable and mortal blow that was about to\r\nsmite their Cause.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of March, 1865, had come.  The Thirty-Eighth Congress was no\r\nmore.  Mr. Lincoln was about to be inaugurated, for a second term, as\r\nPresident of the United States.  The previous night had been vexed with\r\na stormy snow-fall.  The morning had also been stormy and rainy.  By\r\nmid-day, however, as if to mark the event auspiciously, the skies\r\ncleared and the sun shone gloriously upon the thousands and tens of\r\nthousands who had come to Washington, to witness the second Inauguration\r\nof him whom the people had now, long since, learned to affectionately\r\nterm \"Father Abraham\"--of him who had become the veritable Father of his\r\nPeople.  As the President left the White House, to join the grand\r\nprocession to the Capitol, a brilliant meteor shot athwart the heavens,\r\nabove his head.  At the time, the superstitious thought it an Omen of\r\ntriumph--of coming Peace--but in the sad after-days when armed Rebellion\r\nhad ceased and Peace had come, it was remembered, with a shudder, as a\r\nportent of ill.  When, at last, Mr. Lincoln stood, with bared head, upon\r\nthe platform at the eastern portico of the Capitol, where four years\r\nbefore, he had made his vows before the People, under such very\r\ndifferent circumstances and surroundings, the contrast between that time\r\nand this--and all the terrible and eventful history of the interim\r\n--could not fail to present itself to every mind of all those congregated,\r\nwhether upon the platform among the gorgeously costumed foreign\r\ndiplomats, the full-uniformed Military and Naval officers of the United\r\nStates, and the more soberly-clad statesmen and Civic and Judicial\r\nfunctionaries of the Land, or in the vast and indiscriminate mass of the\r\nenthusiastic people in front and on both sides of it.  As Chief Justice\r\nChase administered the oath, and Abraham Lincoln, in view of all the\r\npeople, reverently bowed his head and kissed the open Bible, at a\r\npassage in Isaiah (27th and 28th verses of the 5th Chapter) which it was\r\nthought \"admonished him to be on his guard, and not to relax at all, in\r\nhis efforts,\" the people, whose first cheers of welcome had been stayed\r\nby the President's uplifted hand, broke forth in a tumult of cheering,\r\nuntil again hushed by the clear, strong, even voice of the President, as\r\nhe delivered that second Inaugural Address, whose touching tenderness,\r\nreligious resignation, and Christian charity, were clad in these\r\nimperishable words:\r\n\r\n\"FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: At this second appearing to take the Oath of the\r\nPresidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than\r\nthere was at the first.  Then, a statement, somewhat in detail, of a\r\ncourse to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.  Now, at the expiration\r\nof four years, during which public declarations have been constantly\r\ncalled forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still\r\nabsorbs the attention and engrosses the energy of the Nation, little\r\nthat is new could be presented.  The progress of our Arms, upon which\r\nall else depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it\r\nis, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.  With high\r\nhope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\n\"On the occasion corresponding to this, four years ago, all thoughts\r\nwere anxiously directed to an impending Civil War.  All dreaded it--all\r\nsought to avert it.  While the Inaugural Address was being delivered\r\nfrom this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without War,\r\nInsurgent agents were in the city, seeking to destroy it without War\r\n--seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide the effects, by negotiation.\r\nBoth parties deprecated War; but one of them would make War rather than\r\nlet the Nation survive; and the other would accept War rather than let\r\nit perish--and the War came.\r\n\r\n\"One-eighth of the whole population were colored Slaves, not distributed\r\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\r\nThese Slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\r\nthat this interest was, somehow, the cause of the War.  To strengthen,\r\nperpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the\r\nInsurgents would rend the Union, even by War; while the Government\r\nclaimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement\r\nof it.  Neither Party expected for the War the magnitude or the duration\r\nwhich it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause of\r\nthe conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\r\nshould cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\r\nfundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray to the\r\nsame God; and each invokes His aid against the other.  It may seem\r\nstrange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in\r\nwringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us\r\njudge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both could not be\r\nanswered--that of neither has been answered fully.  The Almighty has His\r\nown purposes.  'Woe unto the World because of offences! for it must\r\nneeds be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence\r\ncometh.'  If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those\r\noffences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which,\r\nhaving continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and\r\nthat He gives to both North and South this terrible War, as the woe due\r\nto those by Whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any\r\ndeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in a living\r\nGod always ascribe to Him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray\r\n--that this mighty scourge of War may speedily pass away.  Yet, if God\r\nwills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two\r\nhundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until\r\nevery drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn\r\nwith the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must\r\nbe said, 'The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.'\r\n\r\n\"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the\r\nright, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the\r\nwork we are in; to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who\r\nshall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do\r\nall which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting Peace among\r\nourselves, and with all Nations.\"\r\n\r\nWith utterances so just and fair, so firm and hopeful, so penitent and\r\nhumble, so benignant and charitable, so mournfully tender and sweetly\r\nsolemn, so full of the fervor of true piety and the very pathos of\r\npatriotism, small wonder is it that among those numberless thousands\r\nwho, on this memorable occasion, gazed upon the tall, gaunt form of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, and heard his clear, sad voice, were some who almost\r\nimagined they saw the form and heard the voice of one of the great\r\nprophets and leaders of Israel; while others were more reminded of one\r\nof the Holy Apostles of the later Dispensation who preached the glorious\r\nGospel \"On Earth, Peace, good will toward Men,\" and received in the end\r\nthe crown of Christian martyrdom.  But not one soul of those present\r\n--unless his own felt such presentiment--dreamed for a moment that, all\r\ntoo soon, the light of those brave and kindly eyes was fated to go out\r\nin darkness, that sad voice to be hushed forever, that form to lie\r\nbleeding and dead, a martyred sacrifice indeed, upon the altar of his\r\nCountry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n                   COLLAPSE OF THE ARMED CONSPIRACY.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Sherman's Armies were pressing along upward, toward Raleigh,\r\nfrom Columbia, marching through swamps and over quicksands and across\r\nswollen streams--cold, wet, hungry, tired--often up to their armpits in\r\nwater, yet keeping their powder dry, and silencing opposing batteries or\r\ndriving the Enemy, who doggedly retired before them, through the\r\ndrenching rains which poured down unceasingly for days, and even weeks,\r\nat a time.  On the 16th of March, 1865, a part of Sherman's Forces met\r\nthe Enemy, under General Joe Johnston, at Averysboro, N.  C., and forced\r\nhim to retire.  On the 19th and 20th of March, occurred the series of\r\nengagements, about Mill Creek and the Bentonville and Smithfield\r\ncross-roads, which culminated in the attack upon the Enemy, of the 21st\r\nof March, and his evacuation, that night, of his entire line of works,\r\nand retreat upon Smithfield.  This was known as the Battle of\r\nBentonville, and was the last battle fought between the rival Forces\r\nunder Sherman and Johnston.  The Armies of Sherman, now swollen by\r\nhaving formed a junction with the troops under Schofield and Terry,\r\nwhich had come from Newbern and Wilmington, went into camp at Goldsboro,\r\nNorth Carolina, to await the rebuilding of the railroads from those two\r\npoints on the coast, and the arrival of badly needed clothing,\r\nprovision, and other supplies, after which the march would be resumed to\r\nBurksville, Virginia.  By the 25th of March, the railroad from Newbern\r\nwas in running order, and General Sherman, leaving General Schofield in\r\ncommand of his eighty thousand troops, went to Newbern and Morehead\r\nCity, and thence by steamer to City Point, for a personal interview with\r\nGeneral Grant.  On the same day, Lee made a desperate but useless\r\nassault, with twenty thousand (of his seventy thousand) men upon Fort\r\nStedman--a portion of Grant's works in front of Petersburg.  On the\r\n27th, President Lincoln reached City Point, on the James River, in the\r\nsteamer \"Ocean Queen.\"  Sherman reached City Point the same day, and,\r\nafter meeting the General-in-Chief, Grant took him on board the \"Ocean\r\nQueen\" to see the President.  Together they explained to Mr. Lincoln the\r\nMilitary situation, during the \"hour or more\" they were with him.  Of\r\nthis interview with Mr. Lincoln, General Sherman afterwards wrote:\r\n\"General Grant and I explained to him that my next move from Goldsboro\r\nwould bring my Army, increased to eighty thousand men by Schofield's and\r\nTerry's reinforcements, in close communication with General Grant's\r\nArmy, then investing Lee in Richmond, and that unless Lee could effect\r\nhis escape, and make junction with Johnston in North Carolina, he would\r\nsoon be shut up in Richmond with no possibility of supplies, and would\r\nhave to surrender.  Mr. Lincoln was extremely interested in this view of\r\nthe case, and when we explained that Lee's only chance was to escape,\r\njoin Johnston, and, being then between me in North Carolina, and Grant\r\nin Virginia, could choose which to fight.  Mr. Lincoln seemed unusually\r\nimpressed with this; but General Grant explained that, at the very\r\nmoment of our conversation, General Sheridan was passing his Cavalry\r\nacross James River, from the North to the South; that he would, with\r\nthis Cavalry, so extend his left below Petersburg as to meet the South\r\nShore Road; and that if Lee should 'let go' his fortified lines, he\r\n(Grant) would follow him so close that he could not possibly fall on me\r\nalone in North Carolina.  I, in like manner, expressed the fullest\r\nconfidence that my Army in North Carolina was willing to cope with Lee\r\nand Johnston combined, till Grant could come up.  But we both agreed\r\nthat one more bloody battle was likely to occur before the close of the\r\nWar.  Mr. Lincoln * * * more than once exclaimed: 'Must more blood be\r\nshed?  Cannot this last bloody battle be avoided?'  We explained that we\r\nhad to presume that General Lee was a real general; that he must see\r\nthat Johnston alone was no barrier to my progress; and that if my Army\r\nof eighty thousand veterans should reach Burksville, he was lost in\r\nRichmond; and that we were forced to believe he would not await that\r\ninevitable conclusion, but make one more desperate effort.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's intense anxiety caused him to remain at City Point,\r\nfrom this time forth, almost until the end--receiving from General\r\nGrant, when absent, at the immediate front, frequent dispatches, which,\r\nas fast as received and read, he transmitted to the Secretary of War,\r\nat Washington.  Grant had already given general instructions to\r\nMajor-Generals Meade, Ord, and Sheridan, for the closing movements of his\r\nimmediate Forces, against Lee and his lines of supply and possible\r\nretreat.  He saw that the time had come for which he had so long waited,\r\nand he now felt \"like ending the matter.\"  On the morning of the 29th of\r\nMarch--preliminary dispositions having been executed--the movements\r\nbegan.  That night, Grant wrote to Sheridan, who was at Dinwiddie Court\r\nHouse, with his ten thousand Cavalry: \"Our line is now unbroken from the\r\nAppomattox to Dinwiddie.  * * *  I feel now like ending the matter, if\r\nit is possible to do so, before going back.  * * *  In the morning, push\r\naround the Enemy, if you can, and get on his right rear.  * * * We will\r\nall act together as one Army, until it is seen what can be done with the\r\nEnemy.\"  The rain fell all that night in torrents.  The face of the\r\ncountry, where forests, swamps, and quicksands alternated in presenting\r\napparently insuperable obstacles to immediate advance, was very\r\ndiscouraging next morning, but Sheridan's heart was gladdened by orders\r\nto seize Five Forks.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House occurred--the Enemy\r\nattacking Sheridan and Warren with a largely superior force.  During the\r\nnight, Sheridan was reinforced with the Fifth Corps, and other troops.\r\nOn April 1st, Sheridan fought, and won, the glorious Battle of Five\r\nForks, against this detached Rebel force, and, besides capturing 6,000\r\nprisoners and six pieces of artillery, dispersed the rest to the North\r\nand West, away from the balance of Lee's Army.  That night, after Grant\r\nreceived the news of this victory, he went into his tent, wrote a\r\ndispatch, sent it by an orderly, and returning to the fire outside his\r\ntent, calmly said: \"I have ordered an immediate assault along the\r\nlines.\"  This was afterward modified to an attack at three points, on\r\nthe Petersburg works, at 4 o'clock in the morning--a terrific\r\nbombardment, however, to be kept up all night.  Grant also sent more\r\nreinforcements to Sheridan.  On the morning of April 2nd, the assault\r\nwas made, and the Enemy's works were gallantly carried, while Sheridan\r\nwas coming up to the West of Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel Chieftain Lee, when his works were stormed and carried, is\r\nsaid to have exclaimed: \"It has happened as I thought; the lines have\r\nbeen stretched until they broke.\"  At 10.30 A. M. he telegraphed to\r\nJefferson Davis: \"My lines are broken in three places.  Richmond must be\r\nevacuated this evening.\"  This dispatch of Parke, Ord on Wright's left,\r\nHumphreys on Ord's left and Warren on Humphrey's left-Sheridan being to\r\nthe rear and left of Warren, reached Davis, while at church.  All\r\npresent felt, as he retired, that the end of the Rebellion had come.  At\r\n10.40 A. M. Lee reported further: \"I see no prospect of doing more than\r\nholding our position here till night.  I am not certain that I can do\r\nthat.  If I can, I shall withdraw tonight, North of the Appomattox, and\r\nif possible, it will be better to withdraw the whole line to-night from\r\nJames river.  * * *  Our only chance of concentrating our Forces is to\r\ndo so near Danville railroad, which I shall endeavor to do at once.\r\nI advise that all preparations be made for leaving Richmond to-night.\r\nI will advise you later, according to circumstances.  \"At 7 o'clock P. M.\r\nLee again communicated to the Rebel Secretary of War this information:\r\n\"It is absolutely necessary that we should abandon our position\r\nto-night, or run the risk of being cut off in the morning.  I have given\r\nall the orders to officers on both sides of the river, and have taken\r\nevery precaution that I can to make the movement successful.  It will be\r\na difficult operation, but I hope not impracticable.  Please give all\r\norders that you find necessary, in and about Richmond.  The troops will\r\nall be directed to Amelia Court House.\"  This was the last dispatch sent\r\nby Lee to the Rebel Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of April, Petersburg and Richmond were evacuated, and again\r\nunder the Union flag, while Grant's immediate Forces were pressing\r\nforward to cut off the retreat of Lee, upon Amelia Court House and\r\nDanville, in an effort to form a junction with Johnston.  On the 6th,\r\nthe important Battle of Sailor's Creek, Va., was fought and won by\r\nSheridan.  On the evening of the 7th, at the Farmville hotel, where Lee\r\nhad slept the night before, Grant, after sending dispatches to Sheridan\r\nat Prospect Station, Ord at Prince Edward's Court House, and Mead at\r\nRice Station, wrote the following letter to Lee:\r\n\r\n                         \"FARMVILLE, April 7th, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: The results of the last week must convince you of the\r\nhopelessness of further resistance, on the part of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia, in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as my\r\nduty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of\r\nblood, by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate\r\nStates' army known as the Army of Northern Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT,\r\n\"Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLee, however, in replying to this demand, and in subsequent\r\ncorrespondence, seemed to be unable to see \"the hopelessness of further\r\nresistance.\"  He thought \"the emergency had not yet come.\"  Hence, Grant\r\ndecided to so press and harass him, as to bring the emergency along\r\nquickly.  Accordingly, by the night of the 8th of April, Sheridan with\r\nhis Cavalry had completely headed Lee off, at Appomattox Court House.\r\nBy morning, Ord's forces had reached Sheridan, and were in line behind\r\nhim.  Two Corps of the Army of the Potomac, under Meade, were also, by\r\nthis time, close on the Enemy's rear.  And now the harassed Enemy,\r\nconscious that his rear was threatened, and seeing only Cavalry in his\r\nfront, through which to fight his way, advanced to the attack.  The\r\ndismounted Cavalry of Sheridan contested the advance, in order to give\r\nOrd and Griffin as much time as possible to form, then, mounting and\r\nmoving rapidly aside, they suddenly uncovered, to the charging Rebels,\r\nOrd's impenetrable barrier of Infantry, advancing upon them at a\r\ndouble-quick!  At the same time that this appalling sight staggered\r\nthem, and rolled them back in despair, they became aware that Sheridan's\r\nimpetuous Cavalry, now mounted, were hovering on their left flank,\r\nevidently about to charge!\r\n\r\nLee at once concluded that the emergency \"had now come,\" and sent, both\r\nto Sheridan and Meade, a flag of truce, asking that hostilities cease,\r\npending negotiations for a surrender--having also requested of Grant an\r\naudience with a view to such surrender.  That afternoon the two great\r\nrival Military Chieftains met by appointment in the plain little\r\nfarm-house of one McLean--Lee dressed in his best full-dress uniform and\r\nsword, Grant in a uniform soiled and dusty, and without any sword--and,\r\nafter a few preliminary words, as to the terms proposed by Grant, the\r\nlatter sat down to the table, and wrote the following:\r\n\r\n                         \"APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE,\r\n                         \"VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the\r\n8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the officers and\r\nmen to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an officer to be\r\ndesignated by me, the other to be retained by such officer or officers\r\nas you may designate.  The officers to give their individual paroles not\r\nto take up arms against the Government of the United States, until\r\nproperly exchanged; and each company or regimental commander to sign a\r\nlike parole for the men of their commands.  The arms, artillery, and\r\npublic property to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the\r\nofficers appointed by me to receive them.  This will not embrace the\r\nside-arms of the officers nor their private horses or baggage.  This\r\ndone, each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to\r\nbe disturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their\r\nparoles and the laws in force where they may reside.\r\n\r\n                                   \"U. S. GRANT,\r\n                              \"Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\"General R. E. LEE.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some further conversation, in which Grant intimated that his\r\nofficers receiving paroles would be instructed to \"allow the Cavalry and\r\nArtillery men to retain their horses, and take them home to work their\r\nlittle farms\"--a kindness which Lee said, would \"have the best possible\r\neffect,\" the latter wrote his surrender in the following words:\r\n\r\n               \"HEAD-QUARTERS, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,\r\n                              April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: I received your letter of this date containing the terms of\r\nthe surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, as proposed by you.  As\r\nthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the\r\n8th instant, they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the proper\r\nofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.\r\n                              \"R. E. LEE, General.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-General U. S. GRANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore parting, Lee told Grant that his men were starving; and Grant at\r\nonce ordered 25,000 rations to be issued to the surrendered Rebels--and\r\nthen the Rebel Chieftain, shaking hands with the Victor, rode away to\r\nhis conquered legions.  It was 4.30 P.M. when Grant, on his way to his\r\nown headquarters, now with Sheridan's command, dismounted from his\r\nhorse, and sitting on a stone by the roadside, wrote the following\r\ndispatch:\r\n\r\n                              \"Hon. E. M. STANTON,\r\n                         Secretary of War, Washington.\r\n\r\n\"General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia this afternoon on\r\nterms proposed by myself.  The accompanying additional correspondence\r\nwill show the conditions fully.\r\n                    \"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the 5th of April, Grant, who had kept Sherman, as well as\r\nSheridan, advised of his main movements, had also ordered the former to\r\npress Johnston's Army as he was pressing Lee, so as, between them, they\r\nmight \"push on, and finish the job.\"  In accordance with this order,\r\nSherman's Forces advanced toward Smithfield, and, Johnston having\r\nrapidly retreated before them, entered Raleigh, North Carolina, on the\r\n13th.  The 14th of April, brought the news of the surrender of Lee to\r\nGrant, and the same day a correspondence was opened between Sherman and\r\nJohnston, looking to the surrender of the latter's Army--terms for which\r\nwere actually agreed upon, subject, however, to approval of Sherman's\r\nsuperiors.  Those terms, however, being considered unsatisfactory, were\r\npromptly disapproved, and similar terms to those allowed to Lee's Army,\r\nwere substituted, and agreed to, the actual surrender taking place April\r\n26th, near Durham, North Carolina.  On the 21st, Macon, Georgia, with\r\n12,000 Rebel Militia, and sixty guns, was surrendered to Wilson's\r\nCavalry-command, by General Howell Cobb.  On the 4th of May, General\r\nRichard Taylor surrendered all the armed Rebel troops, East of the\r\nMississippi river; and on the 26th of May, General Kirby Smith\r\nsurrendered all of them, West of that river.\r\n\r\nOn that day, organized, armed Rebellion against the United States\r\nceased, and became a thing of the past.  It had been conquered, stamped\r\nout, and extinguished, while its civic head, Jefferson Davis, captured\r\nMay 11th, at Irwinsville, Georgia, while attempting to escape, was, with\r\nother leading Rebels, a prisoner in a Union fort.  Four years of armed\r\nRebellion had been enough for them.  They were absolutely sick of it.\r\nAnd the magnanimity of the terms given them by Grant, completed their\r\nsubjugation.  \"The wisdom of his course,\" says Badeau,  \"was proved by\r\nthe haste which the Rebels made to yield everything they had fought for.\r\nThey were ready not only to give up their arms, but literally to implore\r\nforgiveness of the Government.  They acquiesced in the abolition of\r\nSlavery.  They abandoned the heresy of Secession, and waited to learn\r\nwhat else their conquerors would dictate.  They dreamed not of political\r\npower.  They only asked to be let live quietly under the flag they had\r\noutraged, and attempt in some degree to rebuild their shattered\r\nfortunes.  The greatest General of the Rebellion asked for pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n                             ASSASSINATION!\r\n\r\nBut while some of the great Military events alluded to in the preceding\r\nChapter, had been transpiring at the theatre of War, something else had\r\nhappened at the National Capital, so momentous, so atrocious, so\r\nexecrable, that it was with difficulty the victorious soldiers of the\r\nUnion, when they first heard the news, could be restrained from turning\r\nupon the then remaining armed Rebels, and annihilating them in their\r\nrighteous fury.\r\n\r\nLet us go back, for a moment, to President Lincoln, whom we left on\r\nboard the Ocean Queen, at City Point, toward the end of March and the\r\nbeginning of April, receiving dispatches from Grant, who was\r\nvictoriously engaged at the front.  On the very day that Richmond fell\r\n--April 4th--President Lincoln, with his little son \"Tad,\" Admiral Porter,\r\nand others, visited the burning city, and held a reception in the\r\nparlors of the Mansion which had now, for so many years, been occupied\r\nby the Chief Conspirator, Jefferson Davis, and which had been\r\nprecipitately abandoned when the flight of that Arch-Rebel and his\r\n\"Cabinet\" commenced.  On the 6th, the President, accompanied by his\r\nwife, Vice-President Johnson, and others from Washington, again visited\r\nRichmond, and received distinguished Virginians, to whom he addressed\r\nwords of wisdom and patriotism.\r\n\r\n     [\"On this occasion,\" says Arnold, \"he was called upon by several\r\n     prominent citizens of Virginia, anxious to learn what the policy of\r\n     the Government towards them would be.  Without committing himself\r\n     to specific details, he satisfied them that his policy would be\r\n     magnanimous, forgiving, and generous.  He told these Virginians\r\n     they must learn loyalty and devotion to the Nation.  They need not\r\n     love Virginia less, but they must love the Republic more.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of April, he returned to Washington, and the same day--his\r\nlast Sunday on Earth--came the grand and glorious news of Lee's\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday evening following, he made a lengthy speech, at the\r\nWhite House, to the great crowd that had assembled about it, to\r\ncongratulate him, and the Nation, upon the downfall of Rebellion.  His\r\nfirst thought in that speech, was of gratitude to God.  His second, to\r\nput himself in the background, and to give all the credit of Union\r\nMilitary success, to those who, under God, had achieved it.  Said he:\r\n\"We meet this evening, not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart.  The\r\nevacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the\r\nprincipal Insurgent Army, give hope of a righteous and speedy Peace,\r\nwhose joyous expression cannot be restrained.  In the midst of this,\r\nhowever, He from whom all blessings flow, must not be forgotten.  A Call\r\nfor a National Thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly\r\npromulgated.  Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of\r\nrejoicing, be overlooked.  Their honors must not be parcelled out with\r\nothers.  I myself was near the front, and had the high pleasure of\r\ntransmitting much of the good news to you; but no part of the honor, for\r\nplan or execution, is mine.  To General Grant, his skilful officers and\r\nbrave men, all belongs.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was almost entirely devoted to the subject of reconstruction\r\nof the States lately in Rebellion, and to an argument in favor of the\r\nReconstruction policy, under which a new and loyal government had been\r\nformed for the State of Louisiana.  \"Some twelve thousand voters in the\r\nheretofore Slave State of Louisiana,\" said he, \"have sworn allegiance to\r\nthe Union, assumed to be the rightful political power of the State, held\r\nelections, organized a State government, adopted a Free State\r\nConstitution, giving the benefit of public schools equally to Black and\r\nWhite, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise\r\nupon the colored man.  Their Legislature has already voted to ratify the\r\nConstitutional Amendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing Slavery\r\nthroughout the Nation.  These twelve thousand persons are thus fully\r\ncommitted to the Union, and to perpetual Freedom in the State; committed\r\nto the very things, and nearly all the things, the Nation wants; and\r\nthey ask the Nation's recognition and its assistance to make good that\r\ncommittal.  Now, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to\r\ndisorganize and disperse them.  We, in effect, say to the White men,\r\n'You are worthless, or worse; we will neither help you, nor be helped by\r\nyou.'  To the Blacks we say, 'This cup of Liberty which these, your old\r\nmasters, hold to your lips, we will dash from you and leave you to the\r\nchances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague\r\nand undefined when, where, and how.'  If this course, discouraging and\r\nparalyzing both White and Black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana\r\ninto proper practical relations with the Union, I have, so far, been\r\nunable to perceive it.  If, on the contrary, we recognize and sustain\r\nthe new government of Louisiana, the converse of all this is made true.\"\r\n\r\nWhile, however, Mr. Lincoln thus upheld and defended this Louisiana plan\r\nof reconstruction, yet he conceded that in applying it to other States,\r\nwith their varying conditions, \"no exclusive and inflexible plan can\r\nsafely be prescribed as to details and collaterals.\"  The entire speech\r\nshows the greatest solicitude to make no mistake necessitating backward\r\nsteps, and consequent delay in reconstructing the Rebel States into\r\nLoyal ones; and especially anxious was he, in this, his last public\r\nutterance, touching the outcome of his great life-work, Emancipation.\r\n\"If,\" said he, \"we reject Louisiana, we also reject one vote in favor of\r\nthe proposed Amendment to the National Constitution.  To meet this\r\nproposition it has been argued that no more than three-fourths of those\r\nStates which have not attempted Secession are necessary to validly\r\nratify the Amendment.  I do not commit myself against this further than\r\nto say that such a ratification would be questionable, and sure to be\r\npersistently questioned; whilst a ratification by three-fourths of all\r\nthe States would be unquestioned and unquestionable.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, by the President's direction, a War Department Order was\r\ndrawn up and issued, putting an end to drafting and recruiting, and the\r\npurchase of Military supplies, and removing all restrictions which\r\nMilitary necessity had imposed upon the trade and commerce and\r\nintercourse of any one part of the Union with the other.  On Friday, the\r\n14th of April, there was a meeting of the Cabinet at noon, to receive a\r\nreport from General Grant, in person--he having just arrived from the\r\nscene of Lee's surrender.  Later, the President rode out with Mrs.\r\nLincoln, and talked of the hard time they had had since coming to\r\nWashington; \"but,\" continued he, \"the War is over, and, with God's\r\nblessing, we may hope for four years of Peace and happiness, and then we\r\nwill go back to Illinois, and pass the rest of our lives in quiet.\"  At\r\nFord's Theatre, that evening, was played \"The American Cousin,\" and it\r\nhad been announced that both the President and General Grant would be\r\npresent.  Grant, however, was prevented from attending.  President\r\nLincoln attended with reluctance--possibly because of a presentiment\r\nwhich he had that day had, that \"something serious is going to happen,\"\r\nof which he made mention at the Cabinet meeting aforesaid.\r\n\r\nIt was about 9 o-clock P.M., that the President, with Mrs. Lincoln,\r\nMajor Rathbone, and Miss Harris, entered the Theatre, and, after\r\nacknowledging with a bow the patriotic acclamations with which the\r\naudience saluted him, entered the door of the private box, reserved for\r\nhis party, which was draped with the folds of the American flag.  At\r\nhalf past 10 o'clock, while all were absorbed in the play, a pistol-shot\r\nwas heard, and a man, brandishing a bloody dagger, was seen to leap to\r\nthe stage from the President's box, crying \"Sic Semper Tyrannis!\" His\r\nspurred boot, catching in the bunting, tripped him, so that he half fell\r\nand injured one leg, but instantly recovered himself, and, shouting \"The\r\nSouth is avenged!\" rushed across the stage, and disappeared.  It was an\r\nactor, John Wilkes Booth by name, who--inspired with all the mad,\r\nunreasoning, malignant hatred of everything representing Freedom and\r\nUnion, which was purposely instilled into the minds and hearts of their\r\nfollowers and sympathizers by the Rebel leaders and their chief\r\naccomplices in the North--had basely skulked into the box, behind Mr.\r\nLincoln, mortally wounded him with a pistol-bullet, and escaped--after\r\nstabbing Major Rathbone for vainly striving to arrest the vile\r\nassassin's flight.\r\n\r\nThus this great and good Ruler of our reunited People was foully\r\nstricken down in the very moment of his triumph; when the Union troops\r\nwere everywhere victorious; when Lee had surrendered the chief Army of\r\nthe downfallen Confederacy; when Johnston was on the point of\r\nsurrendering the only remaining Rebel force which could be termed an\r\nArmy; on the self-same day too, which saw the identical flag of the\r\nUnion, that four years before had been sadly hauled down from the\r\nflagstaff of Fort Sumter, triumphantly raised again over that historic\r\nfort; when, the War being at an end, everything in the future looked\r\nhopeful; at the very time when his merciful and kindly mind was\r\ndoubtless far away from the mimic scenes upon which he looked, revolving\r\nbeneficent plans for reconstructing and rebuilding the waste and\r\ndesolate places in the South which War had made; at this time, of all\r\ntimes, when his clear and just perceptions and firm patriotism were most\r\nneeded,\r\n\r\n     [For his last public words, two nights before, had been: \"In the\r\n     present 'situation,' as the phrase goes, it may be my duty to make\r\n     some new announcement to the people of the South.  I am\r\n     CONSIDERING, and shall not fail to act when satisfied that action\r\n     will be proper.\"]\r\n\r\nalike by conquerors and conquered, to guide and aid the Nation in the\r\ndifficult task of reconstruction, and of the new departure, looming up\r\nbefore it, with newer and broader and better political issues upon which\r\nall Patriot might safely divide, while all the old issues of\r\nStates-rights, Secession, Free-Trade, and Slavery, and all the mental\r\nand moral leprosy growing out of them, should lie buried far out of\r\nsight as dead-and-gone relics of the cruel and devastating War which\r\nthey alone had brought on!  Abraham Lincoln never spoke again.  The\r\nearly beams of the tomorrow's sun touched, but failed to warm, the\r\nlifeless remain of the great War-President and Liberator, as they were\r\nborne, in mournful silence, back to the White House, mute and ghastly\r\nwitness of the sheer desperation of those who, although armed Rebellion,\r\nin the open field, by the fair and legitimate modes of Military warfare,\r\nhad ceased, were determined still to keep up that cowardly \"fire in the\r\nrear\" which had been promised to the Rebel leaders by their Northern\r\nhenchmen and sympathizers.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of President Lincoln was but a part of the plot of\r\nBooth and his murderous Rebel-sympathizing fellow conspirators.  It was\r\ntheir purpose also to kill Grant, and Seward, and other prominent\r\nmembers of the Cabinet, simultaneously, in the wild hope that anarchy\r\nmight follow, and Treason find its opportunity.  In this they almost\r\nmiraculously failed, although Seward was badly wounded by one of the\r\nassassins.\r\n\r\nThat the Rebel authorities were cognizant of, and encouraged, this\r\ndastardly plot, cannot be distinctly proven.  But, while they naturally\r\nwould be likely, especially in the face of the storm of public\r\nexasperation which it raised throughout the Union, to disavow all\r\nknowledge of, or complicity in, the vengeful murder of President\r\nLincoln, and to destroy all evidences possible of any such guilty\r\nknowledge or complicity, yet there will ever be a strong suspicion that\r\nthey were not innocent.  From the time when it was first known that Mr.\r\nLincoln had been elected President, the air was full of threats that he\r\nshould not live to be inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThat the assassination, consummated in April, 1865, would\r\nhave taken place in February of 1861, had it not been for the timely\r\nefforts of Lieutenant-General Scott, Brigadier-General Stone, Hon.\r\nWilliam H. Seward, Frederick W. Seward, Esq., and David S. Bookstaver of\r\nthe Metropolitan Police of New York--is abundantly shown by\r\nSuperintendent John A.  Kennedy, in a letter of August 13, 1866, to be\r\nfound in vol. ii., of Lossing's \"Civil War in America,\" pages 147-149,\r\ncontaining also an extract from a letter of General Stone, in which the\r\nlatter--after mentioning that General Scott and himself considered it\r\n\"almost a certainty that Mr. Lincoln could not pass Baltimore alive by\r\nthe train on the day fixed\"--proceeds to say: \"I recommended that Mr.\r\nLincoln should be officially warned; and suggested that it would be\r\naltogether best that he should take the train of that evening from\r\nPhiladelphia, and so reach Washington early the next day.\"  * * *\r\nGeneral Scott, after asking me how the details could be arranged in so\r\nshort a time, and receiving my suggestion that Mr. Lincoln should be\r\nadvised quietly to take the evening train, and that it would do him no\r\nharm to have the telegraph wires cut for a few hours, he directed me to\r\nseek Mr. W. H. Seward, to whom he wrote a few lines, which he handed to\r\nme.  It was already ten o'clock, and when I reached Mr. Seward's house\r\nhe had left; I followed him to the Capitol, but did not succeed in\r\nfinding him until after 12 M. I handed him the General's note; he\r\nlistened attentively to what I said, and asked me to write down my\r\ninformation and suggestions, and then, taking the paper I had written,\r\nhe hastily left.  The note I wrote was what Mr. Frederick Seward carried\r\nto Mr. Lincoln in Philadelphia.  Mr. Lincoln has stated that it was this\r\nnote which induced him to change his journey as he did.  The stories of\r\ndisguise are all nonsense; Mr. Lincoln merely took the sleeping-car in\r\nthe night train.\r\n\r\nEqually certain also, is it, that the Rebel authorities were utterly\r\nindifferent to the means that might be availed of to secure success to\r\nRebellion.  Riots and arson, were among the mildest methods proposed to\r\nbe used in the Northern cities, to make the War for the Union a\r\n\"failure\"--as their Northern Democratic allies termed it--while,\r\namong other more devilish projects, was that of introducing cholera\r\nand yellow fever into the North, by importing infected rags!  Another\r\nmuch-talked-of scheme throughout the War, was that of kidnapping\r\nPresident Lincoln, and other high officials of the Union Government.\r\nThere is also evidence, that the Rebel chiefs not only received, but\r\nconsidered, the plans of desperadoes and cut-throats looking to the\r\nsuccess of the Rebellion by means of assassination.  Thus, in a footnote\r\nto page 448, vol. ii., of his \"Civil War in America,\" Lossing does not\r\nhesitate to characterize Jefferson Davis as \"the crafty and malignant\r\nChief Conspirator, who seems to have been ready at all times to\r\nentertain propositions to assassinate, by the hand of secret murder, the\r\nofficers of the Government at Washington;\" and, after fortifying that\r\nstatement by a reference to page 523 of the first volume of his work,\r\nproceeds to say: \"About the time (July, 1862) we are now considering, a\r\nGeorgian, named Burnham, wrote to Jefferson Davis, proposing to organize\r\na corps of five hundred assassins, to be distributed over the North, and\r\nsworn to murder President Lincoln, members of his Cabinet, and leading\r\nRepublican Senators, and other supporters of the Government.  This\r\nproposition was made in writing, and was regularly filed in the\r\n'Confederate War Department,' indorsed 'Respectfully referred to the\r\nSecretary of War, by order of the President,' and signed 'J. C  Ives.'\r\nOther communications of similar tenor, 'respectfully referred' by\r\nJefferson Davis, were placed on file in that 'War Department.'\"  All the\r\ndenials, therefore, of the Rebel chieftains, as to their complicity in\r\nthe various attempts to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, ending with his\r\ndastardly murder in April, 1865, will not clear their skirts of the\r\nodium of that unparalleled infamy.  It will cling to them, living or\r\ndead, until that great Day of Judgment when the exact truth shall be\r\nmade known, and \"their sin shall find them out.\"\r\n\r\n     [The New York Tribune, August 16, 1885, under the heading \"A NARROW\r\n     ESCAPE OF LINCOLN,\" quotes an interesting \"Omaha Letter, to the St.\r\n     Paul Pioneer Press,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"That more than one attempt was made to assassinate Abraham Lincoln\r\n     is a fact known to John W. Nichols, ex-president of the Omaha Fire\r\n     Department.  Mr. Nichols was one of the body-guard of President\r\n     Lincoln from the Summer of 1862 until 1865.  The following\r\n     narrative, related to your correspondent by Mr. Nichols, is\r\n     strictly true, and the incident is not generally known:\r\n\r\n     'One night about the middle of August, 1864, I was doing sentinel\r\n     duty at the large gate through which entrance was had to the\r\n     grounds of the Soldiers' Home.  The grounds are situated about a\r\n     quarter of a mile off the Bladensburg road, and are reached by\r\n     devious driveways.  About 11 o'clock I heard a rifle shot in the\r\n     direction of the city, and shortly afterwards I heard approaching\r\n     hoof-beats.  In two or three minutes a horse came dashing-up, and I\r\n     recognized the belated President.  The horse was very spirited, and\r\n     belonged to Mr. Lamon, marshal of the District of Columbia.  This\r\n     horse was Mr. Lincoln's favorite, and when he was in the White\r\n     House stables he always chose him.  As horse and rider approached\r\n     the gate, I noticed that the President was bareheaded.  After\r\n     assisting him in checking his steed, the President said to me: 'He\r\n     came pretty near getting away with me, didn't he?  He got the bit\r\n     in his teeth before I could draw the rein.'  I then asked him where\r\n     his hat was, and he replied that somebody had fired a gun off down\r\n     at the foot of the hill, and that his horse had become scared and\r\n     jerked his hat off.  I led the animal to the Executive Cottage, and\r\n     the President dismounted and entered.  Thinking the affair rather\r\n     strange, a corporal and myself started in the direction of the\r\n     place from where the sound of the rifle report had proceeded, to\r\n     investigate the occurrence.  When we reached the spot where the\r\n     driveway intersects with the main road we found the President's\r\n     hat--a plain silk hat-and upon examining it we discovered a bullet\r\n     hole through the crown.  The shot had been fired upwards, and it\r\n     was evident that the person who fired the shot had secreted himself\r\n     close to the roadside.  We listened and searched the locality\r\n     thoroughly, but to no avail.  The next day I gave Mr. Lincoln his\r\n     hat and called his attention to the bullet hole.  He rather\r\n     unconcernedly remarked that it was put there by some foolish\r\n     gunner, and was not intended for him.  He said, however, that he\r\n     wanted the matter kept quiet, and admonished us to say nothing\r\n     about it.  We all felt confident that it was an attempt to kill\r\n     him, and a well-nigh successful one, too.  The affair was kept\r\n     quiet, in accordance with his request.  After that, the President\r\n     never rode alone.'\"]\r\n\r\nThat this dark and wicked and bloody Rebellion, waged by the upholders\r\nand advocates of Slavery, Free Trade, and Secession, had descended so\r\nlow as to culminate in murder--deliberate, cold-blooded, cowardly\r\nmurder--at a time when the Southern Conspirators would apparently be the\r\nleast benefitted by it, was regarded at first as evidencing their mad\r\nfatuity; and the public mind was dreadfully incensed.\r\n\r\nThe successor of the murdered President-Andrew Johnson-lost little time\r\nin offering (May the 2d) rewards, ranging from $25,000 to $100,000, for\r\nthe arrest of Jefferson Davis, Jacob Thompson,\r\n\r\n     [The same individual at whose death, in 1885, the Secretary of the\r\n     Interior, ordered the National flag of the Union--which he had\r\n     swindled, betrayed, fought, spit upon, and conspired against--to be\r\n     lowered at halfmast over the Interior Departmental Building, at\r\n     Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nClement C. Clay, Beverly Tucker, George N.  Sanders, and W. C. Cleary,\r\nin a Proclamation which directly charged that they, \"and other Rebels\r\nand Traitors against the Government of the United States, harbored in\r\nCanada,\" had \"incited, concerted, and procured\" the perpetration of the\r\nappalling crime.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, one of them, Jacob Thompson, from his place of\r\nsecurity, in Canada, published a letter claiming to be innocent;\r\ncharacterized himself as \"a persecuted man;\" arrayed certain suspicious\r\nfacts in support of an intimation that Johnson himself was the only one\r\nman in the Republic who would be benefited by President Lincoln's death;\r\nand, as he was found \"asleep\" at the \"unusual hour\" of nine o'clock\r\nP.M., of the 14th of April, and had made haste to take the oath of\r\noffice as President of the United States as soon as the breath had left\r\nthe body of his predecessor, insinuated that he (Johnson) might with\r\nmore reason be suspected of \"complicity\" in \"the foul work\" than the\r\n\"Rebels and Traitors\" charged with it, in his Proclamation; so charged,\r\nfor the very purpose--Thompson insinuated--of shielding himself from\r\ndiscovery, and conviction!\r\n\r\nBut while, for a moment, perhaps, there flitted across the public mind a\r\nhalf suspicion of the possibility of what this Rebel intimated as true,\r\nyet another moment saw it dissipated.  For the People remembered that\r\nbetween \"Andrew Johnson,\" one of the \"poor white trash\" of Tennessee,\r\nand the \"aristocratic Slave-owners\" of the South, who headed the\r\nRebellion, there could be neither sympathy nor cooperation--nothing, but\r\nhatred; and that this same Andrew Johnson, who, by power of an\r\nindomitable will, self-education, and natural ability, had, despite the\r\nefforts of that \"aristocracy,\" forced himself upward, step by step, from\r\nthe tailor's bench, to the successful honors of alderman and Mayor, and\r\nthen still upward through both branches of his State Legislature, into\r\nthe House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States--and,\r\nin the latter Body, had so gallantly met, and worsted in debate, the\r\nchosen representatives of that class upon whose treasonable heads he\r\npoured forth in invective, the gathered hatred of a life-time--would\r\nprobably be the very last man whom these same \"aristocratic\"\r\nConspirators, \"Rebels, and Traitors,\" would prefer as arbiter of their\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling responded heartily, at this time, to the\r\ndenunciations which, in his righteous indignation, he had, in the\r\nSenate, and since, heaped upon Rebellion, and especially his declaration\r\nthat \"Treason must be made odious!\"--utterances now substantially\r\nreiterated by him more vehemently than ever, and multiplied in posters\r\nand transparencies and newspapers all over the Land.  Thus the public\r\nmind rapidly grew to believe it impossible that the Rebel leaders could\r\ngain, by the substitution, in the Executive chair, of this harsh,\r\ndetermined, despotic nature, for the mild, kindly, merciful,\r\neven-tempered, Abraham Lincoln.  With Andrew Johnson for President, the\r\nPeople felt that justice would fall upon the heads of the guilty, and\r\nthat the Country was safe.  And so it happened that, while the mere\r\ninstruments of the assassination conspiracy were hurried to an\r\nignominious death, in the lull that followed, Jefferson Davis and others\r\nof the Rebel chiefs, who had been captured and imprisoned, were allowed\r\nto go \"Scott-free, without even the semblance of a trial for their\r\nTreason!\"\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this work to deal with the history of the\r\nReconstruction or rehabilitation of the Rebel States; to look too\r\nclosely into the devious ways and subtle methods through and by which\r\nthe Rebel leaders succeeded in flattering the vanity, and worming\r\nthemselves into the confidence and control, of Andrew Johnson--by\r\npretending to believe that his occupation of the Presidential Office had\r\nnow, at last, brought him to their \"aristocratic\" altitude, and to a\r\nhearty recognition by them of his \"social equality;\" or to follow,\r\neither in or out of Congress, the great political conflict, between\r\ntheir unsuspecting Presidential dupe and the Congress, which led to the\r\nimpeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, for high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors in office, his narrow escape from conviction and\r\ndeposition, and to much consequent excitement and turmoil among the\r\nPeople, which, but for wise counsels and prudent forethought of the\r\nRepublican leaders, in both Civil and Military life, might have\r\neventuated in the outbreak of serious civil commotions.  Suffice it to\r\nsay, that in due time; long after the Thirteenth Amendment to the United\r\nStates Constitution had been ratified by three-fourths of all the\r\nStates; after Johnson had vexed the White House, with his noisy\r\npresence, for the nearly four years succeeding the death of the great\r\nand good Lincoln; and after the People, with almost unexampled\r\nunanimity, had called their great Military hero, Grant, to the helm of\r\nState; the difficult and perplexing problems involved in the\r\nReconstruction of the Union were, at last, successfully solved by the\r\nRepublican Party, and every State that had been in armed Rebellion\r\nagainst that Union, was not only back again, with a Loyal State\r\nConstitution, but was represented in both branches of Congress, and in\r\nother Departments of the National Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n                        TURNING BACK THE HANDS!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, the War having ended in the defeat, conquest, and capture, of\r\nthose who, inspired by the false teachings of Southern leaders, had\r\narrayed themselves in arms beneath the standard of Rebellion, and fought\r\nfor Sectional Independence against National Union, for Slavery against\r\nFreedom, and for Free Trade against a benignant Tariff protective alike\r\nto manufacturer, mechanic, and laborer, it might naturally be supposed\r\nthat, with the collapse of this Rebellion, all the issues which made up\r\n\"the Cause\"--the \"Lost Cause,\" as those leaders well termed it--would be\r\nlost with it, and disappear from political sight; that we would never\r\nagain hear of a Section of the Nation, and last of all the Southern\r\nSection, organized, banded together, solidified in the line of its own\r\nSectional ideas as against the National ideas prevailing elsewhere\r\nthrough the Union; that Free Trade, conscious of the ruin and desolation\r\nwhich it had often wrought, and of the awful sacrifices, in blood and\r\ntreasure, that had been made in its behalf by the conquered South, would\r\nslink from sight and hide its famine-breeding front forever; and that\r\nSlavery, in all its various disguises, was banished, never more to\r\nobtrude its hateful form upon our Liberty-loving Land.  That was indeed\r\nthe supposition and belief which everywhere pervaded the Nation, when\r\nRebellion was conquered by the legions of the Union--and which\r\nespecially pervaded the South.  Never were Rebels more thoroughly\r\nexhausted and sick of Rebellion and of everything that led to it, than\r\nthese.  As Badeau said, they made haste \"to yield everything they had\r\nfought for,\" and \"dreamed not of political power.\"  They had been\r\nbrought to their knees, suing for forgiveness, and thankful that their\r\nforfeit lives were spared.\r\n\r\nFor awhile, with chastened spirit, the reconstructed South seemed to\r\nreconcile itself in good faith to the legitimate results of the War, and\r\nall went well.  But Time and Peace soon obliterate the lessons and the\r\nmemories of War.  And it was not very long after the Rebellion had\r\nceased, and the old issues upon which it was fought had disappeared from\r\nthe arena of National politics, when its old leaders and their\r\nsuccessors began slowly, carefully, and systematically, to relay the\r\ntumbled-down, ruined foundations and walls of the Lost Cause--a work in\r\nwhich, unfortunately, they were too well aided by the mistaken clemency\r\nand magnanimity of the Republican Party, in hastily removing the\r\npolitical disabilities of those leaders.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther, it is necessary to remark here, that, after\r\nthe suppression of the Rebellion and adoption of the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits\r\nSlavery and Involuntary Servitude within the United States, it soon\r\nbecame apparent that it was necessary to the protection of the Freedmen,\r\nin the civil and political rights and privileges which it was considered\r\ndesirable to secure to them, as well as to the creation and fostering of\r\na wholesome loyal sentiment in, and real reconstruction of, the States\r\nthen lately insurgent, and for certain other reasons, that other\r\nsafeguards, in the shape of further Amendments to the Constitution,\r\nshould be adopted.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were, on the 16th of\r\nJune, 1866, and 27th of February, 1869, respectively, proposed by\r\nCongress to the Legislatures of the several States, and were declared\r\nduly ratified, and a part of the Constitution, respectively on the 28th\r\nof July, 1868, and March 30, 1870.  Those Amendments were in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \"ARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 1.--All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and\r\nsubject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States\r\nand of the State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce\r\nany law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of\r\nthe United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,\r\nliberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person\r\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 2.--Representatives shall be apportioned among the several\r\nStates according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number\r\nof persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.  But when the\r\nright to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President\r\nand Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress,\r\nthe Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the\r\nLegislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such\r\nState, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States,\r\nor in any way abridged, except for participation in Rebellion, or other\r\ncrime, the basis of Representation therein shall be reduced in the\r\nproportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the\r\nwhole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 3.--No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress,\r\nor Elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or\r\nmilitary, under the United States, or under any State, who, having\r\npreviously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of\r\nthe United States, or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an\r\nexecutive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States, shall have engaged in Insurrection or Rebellion\r\nagainst the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.  But\r\nCongress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such\r\ndisability.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 4.--The validity of the public debt of the United States,\r\nauthorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and\r\nbounties for services in suppressing Insurrection or Rebellion, shall\r\nnot be questioned.  But neither the United States nor any State shall\r\nassume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of Insurrection or\r\nRebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or\r\nEmancipation of any Slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims\r\nshall be held illegal and void.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 5.--The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate\r\nlegislation, the provisions of this article.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \"ARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 1.--The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall\r\nnot be denied or abridged by, the United States or by any State on\r\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 2.--The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\nappropriate legislation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, from the provisions of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth,\r\nand Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, and the Congressional\r\nlegislation subsequently enacted for the purpose of enforcing them, that\r\nnot only the absolute personal Freedom of every man, woman, and child in\r\nthe United States was thus irrevocably decreed; that United States\r\ncitizenship was clearly defined; that the life, liberty, property,\r\nprivileges and immunities of all were secured by throwing around them\r\nthe \"equal protection of the laws;\" that the right of the United States\r\ncitizen to vote, was placed beyond denial or abridgment, on \"account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude;\" but, to make this more\r\ncertain, the basis of Congressional Representative-apportionment was\r\nchanged from its former mixed relation, comprehending both persons and\r\n\"property,\" so-called, to one of personal numbers--the Black man now\r\ncounting quite as much as the White man, instead of only three-fifths as\r\nmuch; and it was decreed, that, except for crime, any denial to United\r\nStates citizens, whether Black or White, of the right to vote at any\r\nelection of Presidential electors, Congressional Representatives, State\r\nGovernors, Judges, or Legislative members, \"shall\" work a reduction,\r\nproportioned to the extent of such denial, in the Congressional\r\nRepresentation of the State, or States, guilty of it.  As a further\r\nsafeguard, in the process of reconstruction, none of the insurgent\r\nStates were rehabilitated in the Union except upon acceptance of those\r\nthree Amendments as an integral part of the United States Constitution,\r\nto be binding upon it; and it was this Constitution as it is, and not\r\nthe Constitution as it was, that all the Representatives, in both Houses\r\nof Congress, from those insurgent States--as well as all their State\r\nofficers--swore to obey as the supreme law of the Land, when taking\r\ntheir respective oaths of office.\r\n\r\nBiding their time, and pretending to act in good faith, as the\r\nyears rolled by, the distrust and suspicion with which the old\r\nRebel-conspirators had naturally been regarded, gradually lessened in\r\nthe public mind.  With a glad heart, the Congress, year after year,\r\nremoved the political disabilities from class after class of those who\r\nhad incurred them, until at last all, so desiring, had been reinstated\r\nin the full privileges of citizenship, save the very few unrepentant\r\ninstigators and leaders of the Rebellion, who, in the depths of that\r\noblivion to which they seemingly had been consigned, continued to nurse\r\nthe bitterness of their downfall into an implacable hatred of that\r\nRepublic which had paralyzed the bloody hands of Rebellion, and\r\nshattered all their ambitious dreams of Oligarchic rule, if not of\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nBut, while the chieftains of the great Conspiracy--and of the armed\r\nRebellion itself--remained at their homes unpunished, through the\r\nclemency of the American People; the active and malignant minds of some\r\nof them were plotting a future triumph for the \"Lost Cause,\" in the\r\noverthrow, in consecutive detail, of the Loyal governments of the\r\nSouthern States, by any and all means which might be by them considered\r\nmost desirable, judicious, expedient, and effectual; the solidifying of\r\nthese Southern States into a new Confederation, or league, in fact--with\r\nan unwritten but well understood Constitution of its own--to be known\r\nunder the apparently harmless title of the \"Solid South,\" whose mission\r\nit would be to build up, and strengthen, and populate, and enrich itself\r\nwithin the Union, for a time, greater or less, according to\r\ncircumstances, and in the meanwhile to work up, with untiring devotion\r\nand energy, not only to this practical autonomy and Sectional\r\nIndependence within the Union, but also to a practical re-enslavement of\r\nthe Blacks, and to the vigorous reassertion and triumph, by the aid of\r\nBritish gold, of those pernicious doctrines of Free-Trade which, while\r\nbeneficial to the Cotton-lords of the South, would again check and drag\r\ndown the robust expansion of manufactures and commerce in all other\r\nparts of the Land, and destroy the glorious prosperity of farmers,\r\nmechanics, and laborers, while at the same time crippling Capital, in\r\nthe North and West.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish these results--after whatever of suspicion and\r\ndistrust that might have still remained in Northern minds had been\r\nremoved by the public declaration in 1874, by one of the ablest and most\r\npersuasively eloquent of Southern statesmen, that \"The South--prostrate,\r\nexhausted, drained of her life-blood as well as of her material\r\nresources, yet still honorable and true--accepts the bitter award of the\r\nbloody arbitrament without reservation, resolutely determined to abide\r\nthe result with chivalrous fidelity\"--these old Rebel leaders commenced\r\nin good earnest to carry out their well organized programme, which they\r\nhad already experimentally tested, to their own satisfaction, in certain\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe plan was this: By the use of shot-guns and rifles, and cavalcades of\r\narmed white Democrats, in red shirts, riding around the country at dead\r\nof night, whipping prominent Republican Whites and Negroes to death, or\r\nshooting or hanging them if thought advisable, such terror would fall\r\nupon the colored Republican voters that they would keep away from the\r\npolls, and consequently the white Democrats, undeterred by such\r\ninfluences, and on the contrary, eager to take advantage of them, would\r\npoll not only a full vote, but a majority vote, on all questions,\r\nwhether involving the mere election of Democratic officials, or\r\notherwise; and where intimidation of this, or any other kind, should\r\nfail, then a resort to be had to whatever devices might be found\r\nnecessary to make a fraudulent count and return, and thus secure\r\nDemocratic triumph; and furthermore, when evidences of these\r\nintimidations and frauds should be presented to those people of the\r\nUnion who believe in every citizen of this free Republic having one free\r\nvote, and that vote fairly counted, then to laugh the complainants out\r\nof Court with the cry that such stories are not true; are \"campaign\r\nlies\" devised solely for political effect; and are merely the product of\r\nRepublican \"outrage mills,\" ground out, to order.\r\n\r\nThis plan was first thoroughly tried in Mississippi, and has hence been\r\ncalled the \"Mississippi plan.\"  So magically effectual was it, that,\r\nwith variations adapted to locality and circumstances, this \"Mississippi\r\nplan\" soon enveloped the entire South in its mesh-work of fraud,\r\nbarbarity, and blood.  The massacres, and other outrages, while\r\nmethodical, were remittent, wave-like, sometimes in one Southern State,\r\nsometimes another, and occurring only in years of hot political\r\nconflict, until one after another of those States had, by these crimes,\r\nbeen again brought under the absolute control of the old Rebel leaders.\r\nBy 1876, they had almost succeeded in their entire programme.  They had\r\ncaptured all, save three, of the Southern States, and strained every\r\nnerve and every resource of unprincipled ingenuity, of bribery and\r\nperjury, after the Presidential election of that year had taken place,\r\nin the effort to defeat the will of the People and \"count in,\" the\r\nPresidential candidate of the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\n     [The shameful history of the \"Tilden barrel\" and the \"Cipher\r\n     Dispatches\" is too fresh in the public mind to be entirely\r\n     forgotten,]\r\n\r\nFailing in this effort, the very failure became a grievance.  On the\r\nprinciple of a fleeing thief diverting pursuit by shouting \"Stop thief,\"\r\nthe cry of \"fraud\" was raised by the Democratic leaders, North and\r\nSouth, against the Republican Party, and was iterated and reiterated so\r\nlong and loudly, that soon they actually began, themselves, to believe,\r\nthat President Hayes had been \"counted in,\" by improper methods!  At all\r\nevents, under cover of the hue and cry thus raised, the Southern leaders\r\nhurried up their work of Southern solidification, by multiplied outrages\r\non the \"Mississippi plan,\" so that, by 1880, they were ready to dictate,\r\nand did dictate, the Democratic Presidential nominations.\r\n\r\n     [Senator Wallace, of Pennsylvania, telegraphed from Cincinnati his\r\n     congratulations to General Hancock, and added: \"General Buell tells\r\n     me that Murat Halsted says Hancock's nomination by the Confederate\r\n     Brigadiers sets the old Rebel yell to the music of the Union.\"  In\r\n     the Convention which nominated Hancock, Wade Hampton made a speech,\r\n     saying; \"On behalf of the 'Solid South,' that South which once was\r\n     arrayed against the great soldier of Pennsylvania, I stand here to\r\n     pledge you its solid vote.  [cheers] * * * There is no name which\r\n     is held in higher respect among the people of the South, than that\r\n     of the man you have given to us as our standard-bearer.\"  And\r\n     afterward, in a speech at Staunton, Virginia, the same Southern\r\n     leader, in referring to the action of the Democratic Convention at\r\n     Cincinnati, said: \"There was but one feeling among the Southern\r\n     delegates.  That feeling was expressed when we said to our Northern\r\n     Democratic brethren 'Give us an available man.'  They gave us that\r\n     man.\"]\r\n\r\nWhile these old Rebel leaders of the South had insisted upon, and had\r\nsucceeded in, nominating a man whose record as a Union soldier would\r\nmake him popular in the North and West, and while their knowledge of his\r\navailability for Southern purposes would help them in their work of\r\nabsolutely solidifying the South, they took very good care also to press\r\nforward their pet Free-Trade issue--that principle so dear to the hearts\r\nof the Rebel Cotton-lords that, as has already been hinted, they\r\nincorporated it into their Constitution of Confederation in these words:\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 8.--Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties,\r\nimposts and excises for revenue necessary to pay the debts, provide for\r\nthe common defense, and carry on the Government of the Confederate\r\nStates; but no bounty shall be granted from the Treasury, nor shall any\r\nduty or tax on importation from Foreign Nations be laid to promote or\r\nfoster any branch of industry.\"\r\n\r\nIt may also be remarked that, under the inspiration of those Southern\r\nleaders who afterward rebelled, it had been laid down as Democratic\r\ndoctrine, in the National Democratic platform of 1856--and \"reaffirmed\"\r\nas such, in 1860--that \"The time has come for the People of the United\r\nStates to declare themselves in favor of * * * progressive Free-Trade.\r\n* * *  That justice and sound policy forbid the Federal Government to\r\nfoster one branch of industry to the detriment of another.\"  But, by\r\n1864, the Republican Protective-Tariff of 1860, had so abundantly\r\ndemonstrated, to all our people engaged in industrial occupations, the\r\nbeneficence of the great principle of home industrial Protection, that\r\nTariff-agitation actually ceased, and the National Democratic platform\r\nof that year had nothing to say in behalf of Free-Trade!\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the War, however, at the very first National\r\nDemocratic Convention, in 1868, at which there were delegations from the\r\nlately rebellious States, the question was at once brought to the front,\r\nand, under the inspiration of the old Rebel leaders aforesaid, the\r\nDemocratic platform again raised the banner of Free-Trade by declaring\r\nfor a Tariff for revenue.  But the mass of the People, at that time\r\nstill freshly remembered the terrible commercial disasters and\r\nindustrial depressions which had befallen the Land, through the\r\npractical operation of that baleful Democratic Free-Trade doctrine,\r\nbefore the Rebellion broke out, and sharply contrasted the misery and\r\npoverty and despair of those dark days of ruin and desolation, with the\r\ncomfort and prosperity and hopefulness which had since come to them\r\nthrough the Republican Protective-Tariff Accordingly, the Republican\r\nPresidential candidate, representing the great principle of Protection\r\nto American Industries, was elected over the Democratic Free-Trade\r\ncandidate, by 214 to 71 electoral votes-or nearly three to one!\r\n\r\nTaught, by this lesson, that the People were not yet sufficiently\r\nprepared for a successful appeal in behalf of anything like Free-Trade,\r\nthe next National Democratic Convention, (that of 1872), under the same\r\nSouthern inspiration, more cautiously declared, in its platform, that\r\n\"Recognizing that there are in our midst, honest but irreconcilable\r\ndifferences of opinion, with regard to the respective systems of\r\nProtection and Free-Trade, we remit the discussion of the subject to the\r\nPeople in their Congressional districts, and to the decision of the\r\nCongress thereon, wholly free from Executive interference or dictation.\"\r\nThe People, however, rebuked the moral cowardice thus exhibited by the\r\nDemocracy--in avoiding a direct issue on the doctrine which Democracy\r\nitself had galvanized at least into simulated life,--by giving 286\r\nelectoral votes to the Republican candidate, to 63 for the Democratic,\r\n--or in the proportion of nearly five to one.\r\n\r\nWarned, by this overwhelming defeat, not to flinch from, or avoid, or\r\ntry to convert the great National question of Tariff, into a merely\r\nlocal one, the National Democratic platform of 1876, at the instigation\r\nof the old Rebel leaders of the now fast solidifying South, came out\r\nflat-footedly again with the \"demand that all Custom-house taxation\r\nshall be only for revenue.\"  This time, the electoral vote stood almost\r\nevenly divided, viz.: for the Republican candidate, 185; for the\r\nDemocratic candidate, 184;--a result so extremely close, as to lead to\r\nthe attempted perpetration of great frauds against the successful\r\ncandidate; the necessary settlement of the questions growing out of\r\nthem, by an Electoral commission--created by Congress at the instance of\r\nthe Democratic Party; great irritation, among the defeated Democracy,\r\nover the just findings of that august Tribunal; and to the birth of the\r\nalleged Democratic \"grievance,\" aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThe closeness of this vote--their almost triumph, in 1876,--encouraged\r\nthe Solid South to press upon the National Democratic Convention of\r\n1880, the expediency of adopting a Free-Trade \"plank\" similar to that\r\nwith which, in 1876, they had so nearly succeeded.  Hence the Democratic\r\nplatform of 1880, also declared decidedly for \"A Tariff for revenue\r\nonly.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Rebel leaders, at last in full control of the entire Democratic\r\nParty, had now got things pretty much as they wanted them.  They had\r\ncreated that close corporation within the Union--that /imperium in\r\nimperio/ that oligarchically--governed league of States (within the\r\nRepublic of the United States) which they termed the \"Solid South,\" and\r\nwhich would vote as a unit, on all questions, as they directed; they had\r\ndictated the nomination, by the Democratic Party, of a Presidential\r\ncandidate who would not dare to act counter to their wishes; and their\r\npet doctrine of Free-Trade was held up, to the whole Democratic front,\r\nunder the attractive disguise of a Tariff for revenue only.\r\n\r\n     [As Ex-Senator Toombs, of Georgia, wrote: \"The old boys of the\r\n     South will see that 'Hancock' does the fair thing by them.  In\r\n     other words, he will run the machine to suit them, or they will run\r\n     the thing themselves.  They are not going to be played with any\r\n     longer.\"]\r\n\r\nIn other words, they had already secured a \"Solid South,\" an \"available\"\r\ncandidate, and an \"expedient\" Free-Trade platform.  All that remained\r\nfor them, at this stage, to do, was to elect the candidate, and enact\r\ntheir Free-Trade doctrine into legislation.  This was their current\r\nwork, so to speak--to be first attended to--but not all their work; for\r\none of the most brilliant and candid of their coadjutors had said, only\r\na few months before: \"We do not intend to stop until we have stricken\r\nthe last vestige of your War measures from the Statute-book.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, for their plans, an attempt made by them, under\r\nthe lead of Mr. Morrison of Illinois, in 1876, to meddle with the\r\nRepublican Protective-Tariff, had caused considerable public alarm, and\r\nhad been credited with having much to do with a succeeding monetary\r\npanic, and industrial depression.  Another and more determined effort,\r\nmade by them in 1878, under the lead of their old Copperhead ally,\r\nFernando Wood, to cut down the wise Protective duties imposed by the\r\nTariff Act, about 15 per cent.,--together with the cold-blooded\r\nFree-Trade declaration of Mr. Wood, touching his ruinous Bill, that \"Its\r\nreductions are trifling as compared with what they should be.  * * *  If\r\nI had the power to commence de novo, I should reduce the duties 50 per\r\ncent., instead of less than 15 per cent., upon an average\r\nas now proposed,\"--an effort which was narrowly, and with great\r\ndifficulty, defeated by the Republicans, aided by a mere handful of\r\nothers,--had also occasioned great excitement throughout the Country,\r\nthe suspension and failure of thousands of business firms, the\r\ndestruction of confidence in the stability and profitableness of\r\nAmerican industries, and great consequent suffering, and enforced\r\nidleness, to the working men and working women of the Land.\r\n\r\nThe sad recollection of these facts--made more poignant by the airy\r\ndeclaration of the Democratic Presidential candidate, that the great\r\nNational question of the Tariff is a mere \"local issue,\"--was largely\r\ninstrumental, in connection with the insolent aggressiveness of the\r\nSouthern leaders, in Congress, in occasioning their defeat in the\r\nPresidential contest of 1880, the Republican candidate receiving 214\r\nelectoral votes, while the Democratic candidate received but 155\r\nelectoral votes.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, the House of Representatives was under Republican control, and,\r\ndespite determined Democratic resistance, created a Tariff-commission,\r\nwhose duty it was \"to take into consideration, and to thoroughly\r\ninvestigate, all the various questions relating to the agricultural,\r\ncommercial, mercantile, manufacturing, mining, and (other) industrial\r\ninterests of the United States, so far as the same may be necessary to\r\nthe establishment of a judicious Tariff, or a revision of the existing\r\nTariff, upon a scale of justice to all interests.\"\r\n\r\nThat same year, in the face of most protracted and persistent opposition\r\nby the great bulk of Democratic members, both of the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, and an effort to substitute for it the utterly ruinous\r\nDemocratic Free-Trade Tariff of 1846, the Bill recommended by this\r\nRepublican Tariff-commission, was enacted; and, in 1883, a modified\r\nTariff-measure, comprehending a large annual reduction of import duties,\r\nwhile also carefully preserving the great Republican American principle\r\nof Protection, was placed by the Republicans on the Statute-book,\r\ndespite the renewed and bitter opposition of the Democrats, who, as\r\nusual, fought it desperately in both branches of Congress.  But\r\nRepublican efforts failed in 1884, in the interest of the wool-growers\r\nof the country, to restore the Protective-duties on wool, which had been\r\nsacrificed, in 1883, to an exigency created by Democratic opposition to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnother Democratic effort, in the direction of Free-Trade, known as \"the\r\nMorrison Tariff-Bill of 1884,\" was made in the latter year, which,\r\nbesides increasing the free-list, by adding to it salt, coal, timber,\r\nand wood unmanufactured, as well as many manufactures thereof, decreased\r\nthe import duties \"horizontally\" on everything else to the extent of\r\ntwenty per cent.  The Republicans, aided by a few Democrats, killed this\r\nundigested and indigestible Democratic Bill, by striking out its\r\nenacting clause.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, by dint of the incessant special-pleading in\r\nbehalf of the obnoxious and un-American doctrine of Free-Trade,--or the\r\nnearest possible approach to it, consistent with the absolutely\r\nessential collection of revenues for the mere support of the Government\r\n--indulged in (by some of the professors) in our colleges of learning;\r\nthrough a portion of the press; upon the stump; and in Congress;\r\ntogether with the liberal use of British gold in the wide distribution\r\nof printed British arguments in its favor,--this pernicious but favorite\r\nidea of the Solid South had taken such firm root in the minds of the\r\ngreater part of the Democratic Party in the North and West, as well as\r\nthe South, that a declaration in the National Democratic platform in its\r\nfavor was now looked for, as a matter of course.  The \"little leaven\" of\r\nthis monstrous un-American heresy seemed likely to leaven \"the whole\r\nmass\" of the Democracy.\r\n\r\nBut, as in spite of the tremendous advantage given to that Party by the\r\nunited vote of the Solid South, the Presidential contest of 1884 was\r\nlikely to be so close that, to give Democracy any chance to win, the few\r\nDemocrats opposed to Free-Trade must be quieted, the utterances of the\r\nDemocratic National Platform of that year, on the subject, were so\r\nwonderfully pieced, and ludicrously intermixed, that they could be\r\nconstrued to mean \"all things to all men.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, after an exciting campaign, the Presidential election of 1884\r\nwas held, and for the first time since 1856, the old Free-Trade\r\nDemocracy of the South could rejoice over the triumph of their\r\nPresidential candidate.\r\n\r\nGreat was the joy of the Solid South!  At last, its numberless crimes\r\nagainst personal Freedom, and political Liberty, would reap a generous\r\nharvest.  At last, participation in Rebellion would no more be regarded\r\nas a blot upon the political escutcheon.  At last, commensurate rewards\r\nfor all the long years of disconsolate waiting, and of hard work in\r\nnight ridings, and house-burnings, and \"nigger\"-whippings, and\r\n\"nigger\"-shootings, and \"nigger\"-hangings, and ballot-box stuffings, and\r\nall the other dreadful doings to which these old leaders were impelled\r\nby a sense of Solid-Southern patriotism, and pride of race, and lust for\r\npower, would come, and come in profusion.\r\n\r\nGrand places in the Cabinet, and foreign Missions, for the old Rebels of\r\ndistinction, now Chiefs of the \"Solid-Southern\" Conspiracy, and for\r\nthose other able Northern Democrats who had helped them, during or since\r\nthe Rebellion; fat consulates abroad, for others of less degree;\r\npost-offices, without stint, for the lesser lights; all this, and more,\r\nmust now come.  The long-hidden light of a glorious day was about to\r\nbreak. The \"restoration of the Government to the principles and\r\npractices of the earlier period,\" predicted by the unreconstructed\r\n\"Rebel chieftains\" those \"same principles for which they fought for four\r\nyears\" the principles of Southern Independence, Slavery, Free Trade and\r\nOligarchic rule--were now plainly in sight, and within reach!\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the Free-Trade Democracy, if continued to another\r\nPresidential election, would make Free-Trade a certainty.  The old forms\r\nof Slavery, to be sure, were dead beyond reanimation--perhaps; but, in\r\ntheir place, were other forms of Slavery, which attracted less attention\r\nand reprobation from the World at large, and yet were quite as effectual\r\nfor all Southern purposes.  The system of Peonage and contracted\r\nconvict-labor, growing out of the codes of Black laws, were\r\nall-sufficient to keep the bulk of the Negro race in practical subjection\r\nand bondage.  The solidifying of the South had already made the South\r\nnot only practically independent within the Union, but the overshadowing\r\npower, potential enough to make, and unmake, the rulers and policies of\r\nthe Democratic Party, and of that Union.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was a grand outcome for the tireless efforts of the once\r\ndefeated Conspirators!  And as to Oligarchal rule--the rule of the few\r\n(and those the Southern chiefs) over the many,--was not that already\r\naccomplished?  For these old Rebel leaders and oligarchs who had secured\r\nthe supreme rule over the Solid South, had also, through their ability\r\nto wield the power of that Solid South within the Union, actually\r\nsecured the power of practically governing the entire Union!\r\n\r\nThat Union, then, which we have been wont to look upon as the grandest,\r\nnoblest, freest, greatest Republic upon Earth,--is it really such, in\r\nall respects, at the present?  Does the Free Republic of the United\r\nStates exist, in fact, to-day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n                               WHAT NEXT?\r\n\r\nAnd what next?  Aye, what next?  Do the patriotic, innocent-minded\r\nlovers of a Republican form of Government imagine, for an instant, that\r\nall danger to its continued existence and well-being has ceased to\r\nthreaten?--that all the crises perilous to that beneficent popular\r\ngovernmental form have vanished?--that the climacteric came, and went,\r\nwith the breaking out, and suppression, of the Rebellion?--and that\r\nthere is nothing alarming in the outlook?  Quite likely.  The public\r\nmind has not yet been aroused to a sense of the actual revolution\r\nagainst Republican form of government that has already taken place in\r\nmany of the Southern States, much less as to the likelihood of things to\r\ncome.  The people of any one of the Western, or Northern States,--take\r\nNew York, for example,--feel prosperous and happy under the beneficent\r\nworkings of the Republican Protective-Tariff system.  Business, of all\r\nsorts, recovering from the numerous attacks made upon that prime bulwark\r\nof our American industries, if only let alone, will fairly hum, and look\r\nbright, so far as \"the Almighty dollar\" is concerned.  They know they\r\nhave their primaries and conventions, in their wards and counties\r\nthroughout their State, and their State Conventions, and their\r\nelections.  They know that the voice of the majority of their own\r\npeople, uttered through the sacred ballot-box, is practically the Vox\r\nDei--and that all bow to it.  They know also, that this State government\r\nof theirs, with all its ramifications--whether as to its Executive, its\r\nLegislative, its Judicial, and other officials, either elective or\r\nappointed--is a Republican form of government, in the American sense--in\r\nthe sense contemplated by the Fathers, when they incorporated into the\r\nrevered Constitution of our Country the vital words: \"The United States\r\nshall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of\r\ngovernment.\"  But they do not realize the vastly different condition of\r\nthings in many States of the Solid South, nor how it affects themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd what is this \"republican\" form of government, thus pledged?  It is\r\ntrue that there are not wanting respectable authorities whose\r\ndefinitions of the words \"republic,\" and \"republican,\" are strongly\r\ninharmonious with their true meaning, as correctly understood by the\r\ngreat bulk of Americans.  Thus, Brande asserts that \"A republic may be\r\neither a democracy or an aristocracy!\"--and proceeds to say: \"In the\r\nformer, the supreme power is vested in the whole body of the people, or\r\nin representatives elected by the people; in the latter, it is vested in\r\na nobility, or a privileged class of comparatively a small number of\r\npersons.\"  John Adams also wrote: \"The customary meanings of the words\r\nrepublic and commonwealth have been infinite.  They have been applied to\r\nevery Government under heaven; that of Turkey and that of Spain, as well\r\nas that of Athens and of Rome, of Geneva and San Marino.\"  But the true\r\nmeaning of the word \"republican\" as applied to a \"form of government,\"\r\nand as commonly and almost invariably understood by those who, above all\r\nothers in the wide World, should best understand and appreciate its\r\nblessings--to wit: the American People has none of the looseness and\r\nindefiniteness which these authorities throw about it.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing and correct American idea is that \"Republican\" means: of,\r\nor pertaining to, a Republic; that \"Republic\" means a thing, affair, or\r\nmatter, closely related to, and touching the \"public;\" and that the\r\n\"public\" are the \"people\"--not a small proportion of them, but \"the\r\npeople at large,\" the whole community, the Nation, the commonalty, the\r\ngenerality.  Hence, \"a Republican form of government\" is, in their\r\nopinion, plainly that form which is most closely identified with, and\r\nrepresentative of, the generality or majority of the people; or, in the\r\nlanguage of Dr. J. E. Worcester, it is \"That form of government or of a\r\nState, in which the supreme power is vested in the people, or in\r\nrepresentatives elected by the people.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there can be no such thing as \"a republic,\" which is,\r\nat the same time, \"an aristocracy;\" for the moment that which was \"a\r\nrepublic\" becomes \"an aristocracy,\" that moment it ceases to be \"a\r\nrepublic.\"  So also can there be no such thing as \"a republic\" which is\r\n\"an oligarchy,\" for, as \"a republic\" is a government of the many, or, as\r\nPresident Lincoln well termed it, \"a government of the people, by the\r\npeople, for the people\"--so it must cease to be \"a republic,\" when the\r\nsupreme power is in the hands of the oligarchic few.\r\n\r\nThere can be but two kinds of republics proper--one a democratic\r\nrepublic, which is impossible for a great and populous Nation like ours,\r\nbut which may have answered for some of the small republics of ancient\r\nGreece; the other, a representative republic, such as is boasted by the\r\nUnited States.  And this is the kind palpably meant by the Fathers,\r\nwhen, for the very purpose of nipping in the bud any anti-republican\r\nConspiracy likely to germinate from Slavery, they inserted in the Great\r\nCharter of American Liberties the solemn and irrevocable mandate: \"The\r\nUnited States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican\r\nForm of Government.\"  That they meant this majority rule--this\r\ngovernment by the many, instead of the few--this rule of the People, as\r\nagainst any possible minority rule, by, or through, oligarchs or\r\naristocrats, is susceptible of proof in other ways.\r\n\r\nIt is a safe guide, in attempting to correctly expound the Constitution\r\nof the United States, to be careful that the construction insisted on,\r\nis compatible and harmonious with the spirit of that great instrument;\r\nso that--as was said by an eloquent and distinguished Massachusetts\r\nstatesman of twenty years ago, in discussing this very point--\"the\r\nguarantee of a Republican form of government must have a meaning\r\ncongenial with the purposes of the Constitution.\"  Those purposes, of\r\ncourse, are expressed in its preamble, or in the body of the instrument,\r\nor in both.  The preamble itself, in this case, is sufficient to show\r\nthem.  It commences with the significant words: \"We THE PEOPLE of the\r\nUnited States\"--words, instinct with the very consciousness of the\r\npossession of that supreme power by the People or public, which made\r\nthis not only a Nation, but a Republic; and, after stating the purposes\r\nor objects sought by the People in thus instituting this Republic,\r\nproceeds to use that supreme political power vested in them, by\r\nordaining and establishing \"this CONSTITUTION for the United States of\r\nAmerica.\"  And, from the very first article, down to the last, of that\r\n\"Constitution,\" or \"structure,\" or \"frame,\" or \"form\" of government,\r\nalready self-evidently and self-consciously and avowedly Republican,\r\nthat form is fashioned into a distinctively representative Republican\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe purposes themselves, as declared in the preamble, for which the\r\nPeople of the United States thus spake this representative Republic into\r\nbeing, are also full of light.  Those purposes were \"to form a more\r\nperfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquillity, provide\r\nfor the common defense, promote the General Welfare, and secure the\r\nBlessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\"\r\n\r\nHow is it possible, for instance, that \"the Blessings\r\nof Liberty\" are to be secured to \"ourselves and our Posterity,\" if\r\ncitizens of the United States, despite the XVth Amendment of that\r\nConstitution, find-through the machinations of political organizations\r\n--their right to vote, both abridged and denied, in many of the States,\r\n\"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude?\"  How,\r\nif, in such States, \"the right of the people to be secure in their\r\npersons, houses, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\r\nseizures,\" is habitually violated, despite the IVth Amendment of that\r\nConstitution?  How, if, in such States, persons are notoriously and\r\nfrequently \"deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process\r\nof law,\" in violation of the Vth Amendment of that Constitution?  Yet\r\nsuch is the state of affairs generally prevalent in many States of the\r\nSolid South.\r\n\r\nThese provisions in the Constitution were, with others, placed there for\r\nthe very purpose of securing \"the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and\r\nour Posterity,\" of promoting the \"General Welfare,\" of establishing\r\n\"Justice,\" of insuring \"domestic Tranquillity\" and making \"a more\r\nperfect Union\"--and the violation of those provisions, or any one of\r\nthem, in any part of our Land, by any part of our People, in any one of\r\nthe States, is not only subversive of the Constitution, and\r\nrevolutionary, but constitutes a demand, in itself, upon the National\r\nGovernment, to obey that imperative mandate of the Constitution (Sec. 4,\r\narticle IV.) comprehended in the words: \"The United States SHALL\r\nguarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\"\r\n\r\n     [The meaning of these words is correctly given in an opinion of\r\n     Justice Bronson of New York (4 Hill's Reports, 146) in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"The meaning of the section then seems to be, that no member of the\r\n     State shall be disfranchised or deprived of any of his rights or\r\n     privileges unless the matter shall be adjudged against him upon\r\n     trial had according to the course of common law.  The words 'due\r\n     process of law' cannot mean less than a prosecution or suit\r\n     instituted and conducted according to the prescribed forms and\r\n     solemnities for ascertaining guilt or determining the title to\r\n     property.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is well that the truth should be spoken out, and known of all men.\r\nThe blame for this condition of things belongs partly to the Republican\r\nParty.  The question is sometimes asked: \"If these outrages against\r\ncitizenship, against the purity of the ballot, against humanity, against\r\nboth the letter and spirit of the Constitution of our Republic, are\r\nperpetrated, why is it that the Republican Party--so long in power\r\nduring their alleged perpetration--did not put a stop to them?\"  The\r\nanswer is: that while there are remedial measures, and measures of\r\nprevention, fully warranted by the Constitution--while there are\r\nConstitutional ways and means for the suppression of such outrages--yet,\r\nout of exceeding tenderness of heart, which prompted the hope and belief\r\nthat the folly of continuing them must ere long come home to the\r\nSouthern mind and conscience, the Republican Party has been loath to put\r\nthem in force.  The--best remedy of all, and the best manner of\r\nadministering it, lies with the people themselves, of those States where\r\nthese outrages are perpetrated.  Let them stop it.  The People of the\r\nUnited States may be long-suffering, and slow to wrath; but they will\r\nnot permit such things to continue forever.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rebellion was quelled, the evil spirit which brought it about\r\nshould have been utterly crushed out, and none of the questions involved\r\nin it should have been permitted to be raised again.  But the Republican\r\nParty acted from its heart, instead of its head.  It was merciful,\r\nforgiving, and magnanimous.  In the magnificent sweep of its generosity\r\nto the erring son, it perhaps failed to insure the exact justice to the\r\nother sons which was their right.  For, as has already been shown in\r\nthese pages, Free-Trade, imbedded in the Rebel Constitution, as well as\r\nSlavery, entered into and became a part, and an essential part, of the\r\nRebellion against the Union--to triumph with Slavery, if the Rebellion\r\nsucceeded--to fall with Slavery, if the Rebellion failed.  And, while\r\nSlavery and Free-Trade, were two leading ideas inspiring the Southern\r\nConspirators and leaders in their Rebellion; Freedom to Man, and\r\nProtection to Labor, were the nobler ideas inspiring those who fought\r\nfor the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Morrill-Tariff of 1860, with modifications to it subsequently made\r\nby its Republican friends, secured to the Nation, through the triumph of\r\nthe Union arms, great and manifold blessings and abundant prosperity\r\nflowing from the American Protective policy; while the Emancipation\r\nproclamations, together with the Constitutional amendments, and\r\nCongressional legislation, through the same triumph, and the acceptance\r\nof the legitimate results of the War, gave Freedom to all within the\r\nNation's bound aries.  This, at least, was the logical outcome of the\r\nfailure of the Rebellion.  Such was the general understanding, on all\r\nsides, at the conclusion of the War.  Yet the Republican Party, in\r\nfailing to stigmatize the heresy of Free Trade--which had so large an\r\nagency in bringing about the equally heretical doctrines of State\r\nSovereignty and the right of Secession, and Rebellion itself,--as an\r\nissue or question settled by the War, as a part and parcel of the\r\nRebellion, was guilty of a grave fault of omission, some of the\r\nill-effects of which have already been felt, while others are yet to\r\ncome. For, quickly after the War of the Rebellion closed,--as has been\r\nalready mentioned--the defeated Rebel leaders, casting in their lot with\r\ntheir Democratic friends and allies, openly and without special rebuke,\r\nprevailed upon the National Democracy to adopt the Rebel Free-Trade\r\nShibboleth of \"a Tariff for revenue;\" and that same Democracy, obtaining\r\npower and place, through violence and fraud and falsehood at the\r\nso-called \"elections\" in the Solid Southern States, now threatens the\r\nCountry once more with iniquitous Free-Trade legislation, and all its\r\nattendant train of commercial disasters and general industrial ruin.\r\n\r\nWere Abraham Lincoln able bodily to revisit the United States to-day,\r\nhow his keen gray eyes would open in amazement, to find that many\r\nlegitimate fruits of our Union victories had been filched from us; that\r\n--save the honorable few, who, accepting the legitimate results of the\r\nWar, were still honestly striving for the success of principles\r\nharmonizing with such results, and inuring to the general welfare--they\r\nwho strove with all their might to wreck the Government,--were now,\r\n--through the fraudulent and forcible restriction of voters in their right\r\nto vote--at the helm of State; that these, who sought to ruin the\r\nNation, had thus wrongfully usurped its rule; that Free-Trade--after\r\n\"running-a-muck\" of panic and disaster, from the birth of the Republic,\r\nto the outbreak of the Rebellion, with whose failure it should naturally\r\nhave expired--was now reanimated, and stood, defiantly threatening all\r\nthe great industries of our Land; that all his own painstaking efforts,\r\nand those of the band of devoted Patriots who stood by him to free the\r\nSouthern Slaves, had mainly resulted in hiding from sight the repulsive\r\nchains of enforced servitude, under the outward garb of Freedom; that\r\nthe old Black codes had simply been replaced by enactments adapted to\r\nthe new conditions; that the old system of African Slavery had merely\r\nbeen succeeded by the heartless and galling system of African Peonage;\r\nthat the sacrifices made by him--including that of his martyrdom--had,\r\nto a certain extent, been made in vain; that all the sacrifices, the\r\nsorrows, the sufferings, of this Nation, made in blood, in tears, and in\r\nvast expenditures of time and treasure, had, in some degree, and in a\r\ncertain sense, been useless; that the Union, to be sure, was saved--but\r\nsaved to be measurably perverted from its grand purpose; that the power\r\nwhich animated Rebellion and which was supposed to have expired in the\r\n\"last ditch\" with the \"Lost Cause\" had, by political legerdemain and\r\njugglery and violence, been regained; that the time had actually come\r\nfor Patriots to take back seats, while unrepentant Rebels came to the\r\nfront; that the Republic still lived, but only by sufferance, with the\r\nhands of Southern oligarchs about its palpitating throat--a Republic,\r\nnot such as he expected, where all men are equal before the law, and\r\nprotected in their rights, but where the rights of a certain class are\r\npersistently trampled under foot; that the people of the Northern,\r\nMiddle, and Western States, observing nothing beyond their own vicinage,\r\nso to speak, and finding that each of their own States is still\r\nRepublican in its form of government, persistently, and perversely, shut\r\ntheir eyes to the election terrorism practiced in the Solid South by,\r\nwhich the 16 solid, Southern States were, and are, solidified by these\r\nconspiring oligarchs into one compact, and powerful, political mass,\r\never ready to be hurled, in and out of Congress, against the best\r\ninterests of the Nation--16 States, not all \"Republican\" in form, but\r\nmany of them Despotisms, in substance,--16 States, misnamed\r\n\"Democratic,\" many of them ruled not by a majority, but by an\r\nOligarch-ridden minority--16 States, leagued, banded, bound solidly\r\ntogether, as one great controlling Oligarchy, to hold, in its merciless\r\nand selfish hands, the balance of power within this Republican Union;\r\nand that these confederated Southern States are now actually able to\r\ndictate to all the other States of the Union, the particular man, or\r\nmen, to whose rule the Nation must submit, and the particular policy, or\r\npolicies, which the Nation must adopt and follow:\r\n\r\n\"What next?\"--you ask--\"What next?\"  Alas, it is not difficult to\r\npredict!  Power, lawlessly gained, is always mercilessly used.  Power,\r\nusurped, is never tamely surrendered.  The old French proverb, that\r\n\"revolutions never go backward,\" is as true to-day, as when it was\r\nwritten.  Already we see the signs of great preparations throughout the\r\nSolid South.  Already we hear the shout of partisan hosts marshalled\r\nbehind the leaders of the disarmed Rebellion, in order that the same old\r\npolitical organization which brought distress upon this Land shall again\r\ncontrol the Government.  Already the spirit of the former aggressiveness\r\nis defiantly bestirring itself.  The old chieftains intend to take no\r\nmore chances.  They feel that their Great Conspiracy is now assured of\r\nsuccess, inside the Union.  They hesitate not to declare that the power\r\nonce held by them, and temporarily lost, is regained.  Like the Old Man\r\nof the Sea, they are now on top, and they:\r\n\r\n                     MEAN TO KEEP THERE--IF THEY CAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL ADDENDUM: As few readers 150 years later know of John Logan\r\nit seemed appropriate to the eBook editor to append this short biography\r\ntaken from the Encyclopedia Britanica of 1911:\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGAN, JOHN ALEXANDER (1826-1886),\r\nAmerican soldier and political leader, was born in what is now\r\nMurphysborough, Jackson county, Illinois, on the 9th of February 1826.\r\nHe had no schooling until he was fourteen; he then studied for three\r\nyears in Shiloh College, served in the Mexican War as a lieutenant of\r\nvolunteers, studied law in the office of an uncle, graduated from the\r\nLaw Department of Louisville University in 1851, and practised law with\r\nsuccess.  He entered politics as a Douglas Democrat, was elected county\r\nclerk in 1849, served in the State House of Representatives in 1853-1854\r\nand in 1857, and for a time, during the interval, was prosecuting\r\nattorney of the Third Judicial District of Illinois.  In 1858 and 1860\r\nhe was elected as a Democrat to the National House of Representatives.\r\nThough unattached and unenlisted, he fought at Bull Run, and then\r\nreturned to Washington, resigned his seat, and entered the Union army as\r\ncolonel of the 31st Illinois Volunteers, which he organized.  He was\r\nregarded as one of the ablest officers who entered the army from civil\r\nlife.  In Grant's campaigns terminating in the capture of Vicksburg,\r\nwhich city Logan's division was the first to enter and of which he was\r\nmilitary governor, he rose to the rank of major-general of volunteers;\r\nin November 1863 he succeeded Sherman in command of the XV. Army Corps;\r\nand after the death of McPherson he was in command of the Army of the\r\nTennessee at the battle of Atlanta.  When the war closed, Logan resumed\r\nhis political career as a Republican, and was a member of the National\r\nHouse of Representatives from 1867 to 1871, and of the United States\r\nSenate from 1871 until 1877 and again from 1879 until his death, which\r\ntook place at Washington, D.C., on the 26th of December 1886.  In 1868\r\nhe was one of the managers in the impeachment of President Johnson.  His\r\nwar record and his great personal following, especially in the Grand\r\nArmy of the Republic, contributed to his nomination for Vice-President\r\nin 1884 on the ticket with James G. Blaine, but he was not elected.\r\nHis impetuous oratory was popular on the platform.  He was\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1868 to 1871,\r\nand in this position successfully urged the observance of Memorial or\r\nDecoration Day, an idea which probably originated with him.  He was the\r\nauthor of \"The Great Conspiracy: Its Origin and History\" (1886), an\r\naccount of the Civil War, and of \"The Volunteer Soldier of America\"\r\n(1887).  There is a fine statue of him by St. Gaudens in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe best biography is that by George F. Dawson, The Life and Services\r\nof Gen. John A.  Logan, as Soldier and Statesman (Chicago and New York,\r\n1887).",
