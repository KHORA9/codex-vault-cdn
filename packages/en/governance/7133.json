While thus striving to be accurate, fair,\r\nand just, he has not thought it his duty to mince words, nor to refrain\r\nfrom \"calling things by their right names;\" neither has he sought to\r\ncurry favor, in any quarter, by fulsome adulation on the one side, nor\r\nundue denunciation on the other, either of the living, or of the dead.\r\nBut, while tracing the history of the Great Conspiracy, from its obscure\r\nbirth in the brooding brains of a few ambitious men of the earliest days\r\nof our Republic, through the subsequent years of its devolution, down to\r\nthe evil days of Nullification, and to the bitter and bloody period of\r\narmed Rebellion, or contemplating it in its still more recent and,\r\nperhaps, more sinister development, of to-day, he has conscientiously\r\ndealt with it, throughout, in the clear and penetrating light of the\r\nvoluminous records so readily accessible at the seat of our National\r\nGovernment.  So far as was practicable, he has endeavored to allow the\r\nchief characters in that Conspiracy-as well as the Union leaders, who,\r\nwhether in Executive, Legislative, or Military service, devoted their\r\nbest abilities and energies to its suppression--to speak for themselves,\r\nand thus while securing their own proper places in history, by a process\r\nof self-adjustment as it were, themselves to write down that history in\r\ntheir own language.  If then there be found within these covers aught\r\nwhich may seem harsh to those directly or indirectly, nearly or\r\nremotely, connected with that Conspiracy, he may not unfairly exclaim:\r\n\"Thou canst not say I did it.\"  If he knows his own heart, the writer\r\ncan truly declare, with his hand upon it, that it bears neither hatred,\r\nmalice, nor uncharitableness, to those who, misled by the cunning\r\nsecrecy of the Conspirators, and without an inkling or even a suspicion\r\nof their fell purposes, went manfully into the field, with a courage\r\nworthy of a better cause, and for four years of bloody conflict,\r\nbelieving that their cause was just, fought the armies of the Union, in\r\na mad effort to destroy the best government yet devised by man upon this\r\nplanet.  And, perhaps, none can better understand than he, how hard, how\r\nvery hard, it must be for men of strong nature and intense feeling,\r\nafter taking a mistaken stand, and especially after carrying their\r\nconviction to the cannon's mouth, to acknowledge their error before the\r\nworld.  Hence, while he has endeavored truly to depict--or to let those\r\nwho made history at the time help him to depict--the enormity of the\r\noffence of the armed Rebellion and of the heresies and plottings of\r\ncertain Southern leaders precipitating it, yet not one word will be\r\nfound, herein, condemnatory of those who, with manly candor, soldierly\r\ncourage, and true patriotism, acknowledged that error when the ultimate\r\narbitrament of the sword had decided against them.  On the contrary, to\r\nall such as accept, in good faith, the results of the war of the\r\nRebellion, the writer heartily holds out the hand of forgiveness for the\r\npast, and good fellowship for the future.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

WIGFALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                       A PRELIMINARY RETROSPECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo properly understand the condition of things preceding the great war\r\nof the Rebellion, and the causes underlying that condition and the war\r\nitself, we must glance backward through the history of the Country to,\r\nand even beyond, that memorable 30th of November, 1782, when the\r\nIndependence of the United States of America was at last conceded by\r\nGreat Britain.  At that time the population of the United States was\r\nabout 2,500,000 free whites and some 500,000 black slaves.  We had\r\ngained our Independence of the Mother Country, but she had left fastened\r\nupon us the curse of Slavery.  Indeed African Slavery had already in\r\n1620 been implanted on the soil of Virginia before Plymouth Rock was\r\npressed by the feet of the Pilgrim Fathers, and had spread, prior to the\r\nRevolution, with greater or less rapidity, according to the surrounding\r\nadaptations of soil, production and climate, to every one of the\r\nthirteen Colonies.\r\n\r\nBut while it had thus spread more or less throughout all the original\r\nColonies, and was, as it were, recognized and acquiesced in by all, as\r\nan existing and established institution, yet there were many, both in\r\nthe South and North, who looked upon it as an evil--an inherited evil\r\n--and were anxious to prevent the increase of that evil.  Hence it was\r\nthat even as far back as 1699, a controversy sprang up between the\r\nColonies and the Home Government, upon the African Slavery question\r\n--a controversy continuing with more or less vehemence down to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence itself.\r\n\r\nIt was this conviction that it was not alone an evil but a dangerous\r\nevil, that induced Jefferson to embody in his original draft of that\r\nDeclaration a clause strongly condemnatory of the African Slave Trade--a\r\nclause afterward omitted from it solely, he tells us, \"in complaisance\r\nto South Carolina and Georgia, who had never* attempted to restrain the\r\nimportation of slaves, and who, on the contrary, still wished to\r\ncontinue it,\" as well as in deference to the sensitiveness of Northern\r\npeople, who, though having few slaves themselves, \"had been pretty\r\nconsiderable carriers of them to others\" a clause of the great\r\nindictment of King George III., which, since it was not omitted for any\r\nother reason than that just given, shows pretty conclusively that where\r\nthe fathers in that Declaration affirmed that \"all men are created\r\nequal,\" they included in the term \"men,\" black as well as white, bond as\r\nwell as free; for the clause ran thus: \"Determined to keep open a market\r\nwhere MEN should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his negative for\r\nsuppressing every Legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this\r\nexecrable commerce.  And that this assemblage of horrors might want no\r\nfact of distinguished dye, he is now exciting those very people to rise\r\nin arms among us, and purchase that liberty of which he has deprived\r\nthem, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them; thus paying\r\nof former crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of our people with\r\ncrimes which he urges them to commit against the LIVES of another.\"\r\n\r\n     [Prior to 1752, when Georgia surrendered her charter and became a\r\n     Royal Colony, the holding of slaves within its limits was expressly\r\n     prohibited by law; and the Darien (Ga.) resolutions of 1775\r\n     declared not only a \"disapprobation and abhorrence of the unnatural\r\n     practice of Slavery in America\" as \"a practice founded in injustice\r\n     and cruelty, and highly dangerous to our Liberties (as well as\r\n     lives) but a determination to use our utmost efforts for the\r\n     manumission of our slaves in this colony upon the most safe and\r\n     equitable footing for the masters and themselves.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the war of the Revolution following the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, the half a million of slaves, nearly all of them in the\r\nSouthern States, were found to be not only a source of weakness, but,\r\nthrough the incitements of British emissaries, a standing menace of\r\nperil to the Slaveholders.  Thus it was that the South was overrun by\r\nhostile British armies, while in the North-comparatively free of this\r\nelement of weakness--disaster after disaster met them.  At last,\r\nhowever, in 1782, came the recognition of our Independence, and peace,\r\nfollowed by the evacuation of New York at the close of 1783.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of the war, touching Slavery, had not been lost upon our\r\nstatesmen.  Early in 1784 Virginia ceded to the United States her claims\r\nof jurisdiction and otherwise over the vast territory north-west of the\r\nOhio; and upon its acceptance, Jefferson, as chairman of a Select\r\nCommittee appointed at his instance to consider a plan of government\r\ntherefor, reported to the ninth Continental Congress an Ordinance to\r\ngovern the territory ceded already, or to be ceded, by individual States\r\nto the United States, extending from the 31st to the 47th degree of\r\nnorth latitude, which provided as \"fundamental conditions between the\r\nthirteen original States and those newly described\" as embryo States\r\nthereafter--to be carved out of such territory ceded or to be ceded to\r\nthe United States, not only that \"they shall forever remain a part of\r\nthe United States of America,\" but also that \"after the year 1800 of the\r\nChristian era, there shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude\r\nin any of the said States\"--and that those fundamental conditions were\r\n\"unalterable but by the joint consent of the United States in Congress\r\nassembled, and of the particular State within which such alteration\r\nis proposed to be made.\"\r\n\r\nBut now a signal misfortune befell.  Upon a motion to strike out the\r\nclause prohibiting Slavery, six States: New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania, voted to retain\r\nthe prohibitive clause, while three States, Maryland, Virginia and South\r\nCarolina, voted not to retain it.  The vote of North Carolina was\r\nequally divided; and while one of the Delegates from New Jersey voted to\r\nretain it, yet as there was no other delegate present from that State,\r\nand the Articles of Confederation required the presence of \"two or more\"\r\ndelegates to cast the vote of a State, the vote of New Jersey was lost;\r\nand, as the same Articles required an affirmative vote of a majority of\r\nall the States--and not simply of those present--the retention of the\r\nclause prohibiting Slavery was also lost.  Thus was lost the great\r\nopportunity of restricting Slavery to the then existing Slave States,\r\nand of settling the question peaceably for all time.  Three years\r\nafterward a similar Ordinance, since become famous as \"the Ordinance of\r\n'87,\" for the government of the North-west Territory (from which the\r\nFree States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have\r\nsince been carved and admitted to the Union) was adopted in Congress by\r\nthe unanimous vote of all the eight States present.  And the sixth\r\narticle of this Ordinance, or \"Articles of Compact,\" which it was\r\nstipulated should \"forever remain unalterable, unless by common\r\nconsent,\" was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Art. 6.  There shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude in\r\nthe said Territory, otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the\r\nparty shall have been duly convicted; provided always that any person\r\nescaping into the same from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in\r\nany one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed,\r\nand conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor, or service, as\r\naforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nBut this Ordinance of '87, adopted almost simultaneously with the\r\nframing of our present Federal Constitution, was essentially different\r\nfrom the Ordinance of three years previous, in this: that while the\r\nlatter included the territory south of the Ohio River as well as that\r\nnorth-west of it, this did not; and as a direct consequence of this\r\nfailure to include in it the territory south of that river, the States\r\nof Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, which were taken out of it, were\r\nsubsequently admitted to the Union as Slave States, and thus greatly\r\naugmented their political power.  And at a later period it was this\r\nincreased political power that secured the admission of still other\r\nSlave States--as Florida, Louisiana and Texas--which enabled the Slave\r\nStates to hold the balance of such power as against the original States\r\nthat had become Free, and the new Free States of the North-west.\r\n\r\nHence, while in a measure quieting the great question of Slavery for the\r\ntime being, the Ordinance of '87 in reality laid the ground-work for the\r\nlong series of irritations and agitations touching its restrictions and\r\nextension, which eventually culminated in the clash of arms that shook\r\nthe Union from its centre to its circumference.  Meanwhile, as we have\r\nseen--while the Ordinance of 1787 was being enacted in the last Congress\r\nof the old Confederation at New York--the Convention to frame the\r\npresent Constitution was sitting at Philadelphia under the Presidency of\r\nGeorge Washington himself.  The old Confederation had proved itself to\r\nbe \"a rope of sand.\"  A new and stronger form of government had become a\r\nnecessity for National existence.\r\n\r\nTo create it out of the discordant elements whose harmony was essential\r\nto success, was an herculean task, requiring the utmost forbearance,\r\nunselfishness, and wisdom.  And of all the great questions, dividing the\r\nframers of that Constitution, perhaps none of them required a higher\r\ndegree of self abnegation and patriotism than those touching human\r\nSlavery.\r\n\r\nThe situation was one of extreme delicacy.  The necessity for a closer\r\nand stronger Union of all the States was apparently absolute, yet this\r\nvery necessity seemed to place a whip in the hands of a few States, with\r\nwhich to coerce the greater number of States to do their bidding.  It\r\nseemed that the majority must yield to a small minority on even vital\r\nquestions, or lose everything.\r\n\r\nThus it was, that instead of an immediate interdiction of the African\r\nSlave Trade, Congress was empowered to prohibit it after the lapse of\r\ntwenty years; that instead of the basis of Congressional Representation\r\nbeing the total population of each State, and that of direct taxation\r\nthe total property of each State, a middle ground was conceded, which\r\nregarded the Slaves as both persons and property, and the basis both of\r\nRepresentation and of Direct Taxation was fixed as being the total Free\r\npopulation \"plus three-fifths of all other persons\" in each State; and\r\nthat there was inserted in the Constitution a similar clause to that\r\nwhich we have seen was almost simultaneously incorporated in the\r\nOrdinance of '87, touching the reclamation and return to their owners of\r\nFugitive Slaves from the Free States into which they may have escaped.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, that the Convention that framed our\r\nConstitution lacked the courage of its convictions, and was \"bulldozed\"\r\nby the few extreme Southern Slave-holding States--South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia especially.  It actually paltered with those convictions and\r\nwith the truth itself.  Its convictions--those at least of a great\r\nmajority of its delegates--were against not only the spread, but the\r\nvery existence of Slavery; yet we have seen what they unwillingly agreed\r\nto in spite of those convictions; and they were guilty moreover of the\r\nsubterfuge of using the terms \"persons\" and \"service or labor\" when they\r\nreally meant \"Slaves\" and \"Slavery.\"  \"They did this latter,\" Mr.\r\nMadison says, \"because they did not choose to admit the right of\r\nproperty in man,\" and yet in fixing the basis of Direct Taxation as well\r\nas Congressional Representation at the total Free population of each\r\nState with \"three-fifths of all other persons,\" they did admit the right\r\nof property in man!  As was stated by Mr. Iredell to the North Carolina\r\nRatification Convention, when explaining the Fugitive Slave clause:\r\n\"Though the word 'Slave' is not mentioned, this is the meaning of it.\"\r\nAnd he added: \"The Northern delegates, owing to their peculiar scruples\r\non the subject of Slavery, did not choose the word 'Slave' to be\r\nmentioned.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1789, the first Federal Congress met at New York.  It at once\r\nenacted a law in accordance with the terms of the Ordinance of '87\r\n--adapting it to the changed order of things under the new Federal\r\nConstitution--prohibiting Slavery in the Territories of the North-west;\r\nand the succeeding Congress enacted a Fugitive-Slave law.\r\n\r\nIn the same year (1789) North Carolina ceded her western territory (now\r\nTennessee) south of the Ohio, to the United States, providing as one of\r\nthe conditions of that cession, \"that no regulation made, or to be made,\r\nby Congress, shall tend to emancipate Slaves.\"  Georgia, also, in 1802,\r\nceded her superfluous territorial domain (south of the Ohio, and now\r\nknown as Alabama and Mississippi), making as a condition of its\r\nacceptance that the Ordinance of '87 \"shall, in all its parts, extend to\r\nthe territory contained in the present act of cession, the article only\r\nexcepted which forbids Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThus while the road was open and had been taken advantage of, at the\r\nearliest moment, by the Federal Congress to prohibit Slavery in all the\r\nterritory north-west of the Ohio River by Congressional enactment,\r\nCongress considered itself barred by the very conditions of cession from\r\ninhibiting Slavery in the territory lying south of that river.  Hence it\r\nwas that while the spread of Slavery was prevented in the one Section of\r\nour outlying territories by Congressional legislation, it was stimulated\r\nin the other Section by the enforced absence of such legislation.  As a\r\nnecessary sequence, out of the Territories of the one Section grew more\r\nFree States and out of the other more Slave States, and this condition\r\nof things had a tendency to array the Free and the Slave States in\r\nopposition to each other and to Sectionalize the flames of that Slavery\r\nagitation which were thus continually fed.\r\n\r\nUpon the admission of Ohio to Statehood in 1803, the remainder of the\r\nNorth-west territory became the Territory of Indiana.  The inhabitants\r\nof this Territory (now known as the States of Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan and Wisconsin), consisting largely of settlers from the Slave\r\nStates, but chiefly from Virginia and Kentucky, very persistently (in\r\n1803, 1806 and 1807) petitioned Congress for permission to employ Slave\r\nLabor, but--although their petitions were favorably reported in most\r\ncases by the Committees to which they were referred--without avail,\r\nCongress evidently being of opinion that a temporary suspension in this\r\nrespect of the sixth article of the Ordinance of '87 was \"not\r\nexpedient.\"  These frequent rebuffs by Congress, together with the\r\nconstantly increasing emigration from the Free States, prevented the\r\ntaking of any further steps to implant Slavery on the soil of that\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the vast territory included within the Valley of the\r\nMississippi and known at that day as the \"Colony of Louisiana,\" was, in\r\n1803, acquired to the United States by purchase from the French--to whom\r\nit had but lately been retroceded by Spain.  Both under Spanish and\r\nFrench rule, Slavery had existed throughout this vast yet sparsely\r\npopulated region.  When we acquired it by purchase, it was already\r\nthere, as an established \"institution;\" and the Treaty of acquisition\r\nnot only provided that it should be \"incorporated into the Union of the\r\nUnited States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the\r\nprinciples of the Federal Constitution,\" but that its inhabitants in the\r\nmeantime \"should be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of\r\ntheir liberty, property, and the religion which they professed\"--and,\r\nas \"the right of property in man\" had really been admitted in practice,\r\nif not in theory, by the framers of that Constitution itself--that\r\ninstitution was allowed to remain there.  Indeed the sparseness of its\r\npopulation at the time of purchase and the amazing fertility of its soil\r\nand adaptability of its climate to Slave Labor, together with the then\r\nrecent invention by Eli Whitney, of Massachusetts, of that wonderful\r\nimprovement in the separation of cotton-fibre from its seed, known as\r\nthe \"cotton-gin\"--which with the almost simultaneous inventions of\r\nHargreaves, and Arkwright's cotton-spinning machines, and Watt's\r\napplication of his steam engine, etc., to them, marvelously increased\r\nboth the cotton supply and demand and completely revolutionized the\r\ncotton industry--contributed to rapidly and thickly populate the whole\r\nregion with white Slave-holders and black Slaves, and to greatly enrich\r\nand increase the power of the former.\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson succeeded in negotiating the cession of that vast and\r\nrich domain to the United States, it is not to be supposed that either\r\nthe allurements of territorial aggrandizement on the one hand, or the\r\nimpending danger to the continued ascendency of the political party\r\nwhich had elevated him to the Presidency, threatening it from all the\r\nirritations with republican France likely to grow out of such near\r\nproximity to her Colony, on the other, could have blinded his eyes to\r\nthe fact that its acquisition must inevitably tend to the spread of that\r\nvery evil, the contemplation of which, at a later day, wrung from his\r\nlips the prophetic words, \"I tremble for my Country when I reflect that\r\nGod is just.\"  It is more reasonable to suppose that, as he believed the\r\nascendency of the Republican party of that day essential to the\r\nperpetuity of the Republic itself, and revolted against being driven\r\ninto an armed alliance with Monarchical England against what he termed\r\n\"our natural friend,\" Republican France, he reached the conclusion that\r\nthe preservation of his Republican principles was of more immediate\r\nmoment than the question of the perpetuation and increase of human\r\nSlavery.  Be that as it may, it none the less remains a curious fact\r\nthat it was to Jefferson, the far-seeing statesman and hater of African\r\nSlavery and the author of the Ordinance of 1784--which sought to exclude\r\nSlavery from all the Territories of the United States south of, as well\r\nas north-west of the Ohio River--that we also owe the acquisition of the\r\nvast territory of the Mississippi Valley burdened with Slavery in such\r\nshape that only a War, which nearly wrecked our Republic, could get rid\r\nof!\r\n\r\nOut of that vast and fertile, but Slave-ridden old French Colony of\r\n\"Louisiana\" were developed in due time the rich and flourishing Slave\r\nStates of Louisiana, Missouri and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed that this acquisition of the Colony of\r\nLouisiana and the contemporaneous inventions of the cotton-gin, improved\r\ncotton-spinning machinery, and the application to it of steam power, had\r\nalready completely neutralized the wisdom of the Fathers in securing, as\r\nthey thought, the gradual but certain extinction of Slavery in the\r\nUnited States, by that provision in the Constitution which enabled\r\nCongress, after an interval of twenty years, to prohibit the African\r\nSlave Trade; and which led the Congress, on March 22, 1794, to pass an\r\nAct prohibiting it; to supplement it in 1800 with another Act in the\r\nsame direction; and on March 2, 1807, to pass another supplemental Act\r\n--to take effect January 1, 1808--still more stringent, and covering any\r\nsuch illicit traffic, whether to the United States or with other\r\ncountries.  Never was the adage that, \"The best laid schemes o' mice an'\r\nmen gang aft agley,\" more painfully apparent.  Slaves increased and\r\nmultiplied within the land, and enriched their white owners to such a\r\ndegree that, as the years rolled by, instead of compunctions of\r\nconscience on the subject of African Slavery in America, the Southern\r\nleaders ultimately persuaded themselves to the belief that it was not\r\nonly moral, and sanctioned by Divine Law, but that to perpetuate it was\r\na philanthropic duty, beneficial to both races!  In fact one of them\r\ndeclared it to be \"the highest type of civilization.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1812, the State of Louisiana, organized from the purchased Colony of\r\nthe same name, was admitted to the Union, and the balance of the\r\nLouisiana purchase was thereafter known as the Territory of Missouri.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 commenced the heated and protracted struggle in Congress over\r\nthe admission of the State of Missouri--created from the Territory of\r\nthat name--as a Slave State, which finally culminated in 1820 in the\r\nsettlement known thereafter as the \"Missouri Compromise.\"\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, that struggle may be said to have consisted in the\r\nefforts of the House on the one side, to restrict Slavery in the State\r\nof Missouri, and the efforts of the Senate on the other, to give it free\r\nrein.  The House insisted on a clause in the Act of admission providing,\r\n\"That the introduction of Slavery or involuntary servitude be\r\nprohibited, except for the punishment of crimes whereof the party has\r\nbeen duly convicted; and that all children born within the said State,\r\nafter the admission thereof into the Union, shall be declared Free at\r\nthe age of twenty-five years.\"  The Senate resisted it--and the Bill\r\nfell.  In the meantime, however, a Bill passed both Houses forming the\r\nTerritory of Arkansas out of that portion of the Territory of Missouri\r\nnot included in the proposed State of Missouri, without any such\r\nrestriction upon Slavery.  Subsequently, the House having passed a Bill\r\nto admit the State of Maine to the Union, the Senate amended it by\r\ntacking on a provision authorizing the people of Missouri to organize a\r\nState Government, without restriction as to Slavery.  The House\r\ndecidedly refused to accede to the Senate proposition, and the result of\r\nthe disagreement was a Committee of Conference between the two Houses,\r\nand the celebrated \"Missouri Compromise,\" which, in the language of\r\nanother--[Hon.  John Holmes of Massachusetts, of said Committee on\r\nConference, March 2, 1820.]--, was: \"that the Senate should give up its\r\ncombination of Missouri with Maine; that the House should abandon its\r\nattempt to restrict Slavery in Missouri; and that both Houses should\r\nconcur in passing the Bill to admit Missouri as a State, with\" a\r\n\"restriction or proviso, excluding Slavery from all territory north and\r\nwest of the new State\"--that \"restriction or proviso\" being in these\r\nwords: \"That in all that territory ceded by France to the United States\r\nunder the name of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six degrees,\r\nthirty minutes north latitude, excepting only such part thereof as is\r\nincluded within the limits of the State contemplated by this act,\r\nSlavery and involuntary servitude, otherwise than in the punishment of\r\ncrime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall be and is\r\nhereby forever prohibited; Provided always, that any person escaping\r\ninto the same, from whom labor and service is lawfully claimed in any\r\nState or Territory of the United States, such Fugitive may be lawfully\r\nreclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or\r\nservice, as aforesaid.\"  At a subsequent session of Congress, at which\r\nMissouri asked admission as a State with a Constitution prohibiting her\r\nLegislature from passing emancipation laws, or such as would prevent the\r\nimmigration of Slaves, while requiring it to enact such as would\r\nabsolutely prevent the immigration of Free Negroes or Mulattoes, a\r\nfurther Compromise was agreed to by Congress under the inspiration of\r\nMr. Clay, by which it was laid down as a condition precedent to her\r\nadmission as a State--a condition subsequently complied with--that\r\nMissouri must pledge herself that her Legislature should pass no act \"by\r\nwhich any of the citizens of either of the States should be excluded\r\nfrom the enjoyment of the privileges and immunities to which they are\r\nentitled under the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis, in a nut-shell, was the memorable Missouri Struggle, and the\r\n\"Compromise\" or Compromises which settled and ended it.  But during that\r\nstruggle--as during the formation of the Federal Constitution and at\r\nvarious times in the interval when exciting questions had arisen--the\r\nbands of National Union were more than once rudely strained, and this\r\ntime to such a degree as even to shake the faith of some of the firmest\r\nbelievers in the perpetuity of that Union.  It was during this bitter\r\nstruggle that John Adams wrote to Jefferson: \"I am sometimes Cassandra\r\nenough to dream that another Hamilton, another Burr, may rend this\r\nmighty fabric in twain, or perhaps into a leash, and a few more choice\r\nspirits of the same stamp might produce as many Nations in North America\r\nas there are in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that we had \"sown the wind,\" but we had not yet \"reaped the\r\nwhirlwind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                       PROTECTION AND FREE TRADE.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the first Federal Congress met at New York in March,\r\n1789.  It organized April 6th.  None knew better than its members that\r\nthe war of the Americana Revolution chiefly grew out of the efforts of\r\nGreat Britain to cripple and destroy our Colonial industries to the\r\nbenefit of the British trader, and that the Independence conquered, was\r\nan Industrial as well as Political Independence; and none knew better\r\nthan they, that the failure of the subsequent political Confederation of\r\nStates was due mainly to its failure to encourage and protect the\r\nbudding domestic manufactures of those States.  Hence they hastened,\r\nunder the leadership of James Madison, to pass \"An Act laying a duty on\r\ngoods, wares and merchandize imported into the United States,\" with a\r\npreamble, declaring it to be \"necessary\" for the \"discharge of the debt\r\nof the United States and the encouragement and protection of\r\nmanufactures.\"  It was approved by President Washington July 4, 1789--a\r\ndate not without its significance--and levied imports both specific and\r\nad valorem.  It was not only our first Tariff Act, but, next to that\r\nprescribing the oath used in organizing the Government, the first Act of\r\nthe first Federal Congress; and was passed in pursuance of the\r\ndeclaration of President Washington in his first Message, that \"The\r\nsafety and interest of the People\" required it.  Under the inspiration\r\nof Alexander Hamilton the Tariff of 1790 was enacted at the second\r\nsession of the same Congress, confirming the previous Act and increasing\r\nsome of the protective duties thereby imposed.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the vote in the House of Representatives on this Tariff\r\nBill discloses the fact that of the 39 votes for it, 21 were from\r\nSouthern States, 13 from the Middle States, and 5 from New England\r\nStates; while of the 13 votes against it, 9 were from New England\r\nStates, 3 from Southern States, and 1 from Middle States.  In other\r\nwords, while the Southern States were for the Bill in the proportion of\r\n21 to 3, and the Middle States by 13 to 1, New England was against it by\r\n9 to 5; or again, while 10 of the 13 votes against it were from the New\r\nEngland and Middle States, 21 (or more than half) of the 39 votes for it\r\nwere from Southern States.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen-singularly enough in view of subsequent events\r\n--that we not only mainly owe our first steps in Protective Tariff\r\nlegislation to the almost solid Southern vote, but that it was thus\r\nsecured for us despite the opposition of New England.  Nor did our\r\nindebtedness to Southern statesmen and Southern votes for the\r\ninstitution of the now fully established American System of Protection\r\ncease here, as we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nThat Jefferson, as well as Washington and Madison, agreed with the views\r\nof Alexander Hamilton on Protection to our domestic manufactures as\r\nagainst those of foreign Nations, is evident in his Annual Message of\r\nDecember 14, 1806, wherein-discussing an anticipated surplus of Federal\r\nrevenue above the expenditures, and enumerating the purposes of\r\neducation and internal improvement to which he thinks the \"whole surplus\r\nof impost\" should during times of peace be applied; by which application\r\nof such surplus he prognosticates that \"new channels of communication\r\nwill be opened between the States; the lines of separation will\r\ndisappear; their interests will be identified, and their Union cemented\r\nby new and indissoluble ties\"--he says: \"Shall we suppress the impost\r\nand give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures.  On a few\r\narticles of more general and necessary use, the suppression in due\r\nseason, will doubtless be right; but the great mass of the articles on\r\nwhich impost is paid is foreign luxuries, purchased by those only who\r\nare rich enough to afford themselves the use of them.\"  But his embargo\r\nand other retaliatory measures, put in force in 1807 and 1808, and the\r\nWar of 1812-15 with Great Britain, which closely followed, furnished\r\nProtection in another manner, by shutting the door to foreign imports\r\nand throwing our people upon their own resources, and contributed\r\ngreatly to the encouragement and increase of our home manufactures\r\n--especially those of wool, cotton, and hemp.\r\n\r\nAt the close of that War the traders of Great Britain determined, even\r\nat a temporary loss to themselves, to glut our market with their goods\r\nand thus break down forever, as they hoped, our infant manufactures.\r\nTheir purpose and object were boldly announced in the House of Commons\r\nby Mr. Brougham, when he said: \"Is it worth while to incur a loss upon\r\nthe first importation, in order by the glut to stifle in the cradle\r\nthose rising manufactures in the United States which the War had forced\r\ninto existence contrary to the natural course of things.\"  Against this\r\nthreatened ruin, our manufacturers all over the United States--the sugar\r\nplanters of Louisiana among them--clamored for Protection, and Congress\r\nat once responded with the Tariff Act of 1816.\r\n\r\nThis law greatly extended and increased specific duties on, and\r\ndiminished the application of the ad valorem principle to, foreign\r\nimports; and it has been well described as \"the practical foundation of\r\nthe American policy of encouragement of home manufactures--the practical\r\nestablishment of the great industrial system upon which rests our\r\npresent National wealth, and the power and the prosperity and happiness\r\nof our whole people.\"  While Henry Clay of Kentucky, William Loundes of\r\nSouth Carolina, and Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia supported the\r\nBill most effectively, no man labored harder and did more effective\r\nservice in securing its passage than John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.\r\nThe contention on their part was not for a mere \"incidental protection\"\r\n--much less a \"Tariff for revenue only\"--but for \"Protection\" in its\r\nbroadest sense, and especially the protection of their cotton\r\nmanufactures.  Indeed Calhoun's defense of Protection, from the assaults\r\nof those from New England and elsewhere who assailed it on the narrow\r\nground that it was inimical to commerce and navigation, was a notable\r\none.  He declared that:\r\n\r\n\"It (the encouragement of manufactures) produced a system strictly\r\nAmerican, as much so as agriculture, in which it had the decided\r\nadvantage of commerce and navigation.  The country will from this derive\r\nmuch advantage.  Again it is calculated to bind together more closely\r\nour wide-spread Republic.  It will greatly increase our mutual\r\ndependence and intercourse, and will, as a necessary consequence, excite\r\nan increased attention to internal improvements--a subject every way so\r\nintimately connected with the ultimate attainment of national strength\r\nand the perfection of our political institutions.\"\r\n\r\nHe regarded the fact that it would make the parts adhere more closely;\r\nthat it would form a new and most powerful cement far outweighing any\r\npolitical objections that might be urged against the system.  In his\r\nopinion \"the liberty and the union of the country were inseparably\r\nunited; that as the destruction of the latter would most certainly\r\ninvolve the former, so its maintenance will with equal certainty\r\npreserve it;\" and he closed with an impressive warning to the Nation of\r\na \"new and terrible danger\" which threatened it, to wit: \"disunion.\"\r\nNobly as he stood up then--during the last term of his service in the\r\nHouse of Representatives--for the great principles of, the American\r\nSystem of Protection to manufactures, for the perpetuity of the Union,\r\nand for the increase of \"National strength,\" it seems like the very\r\nirony of fate that a few years later should find him battling against\r\nProtection as \"unconstitutional,\" upholding Nullification as a \"reserved\r\nright\" of his State, and championing at the risk of his neck that very\r\n\"danger\" to the \"liberties\" and life of his Country against which his\r\nprophetic words had already given solemn warning.\r\n\r\nStrange was it also, in view of the subsequent attitudes of the South\r\nand New England, that this essentially Protective Tariff Act of 1816\r\nshould have been vigorously protested and voted against by New England,\r\nwhile it was ably advocated and voted for by the South--the 25 votes of\r\nthe latter which secured its passage being more than sufficient to have\r\nsecured its defeat had they been so inclined.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff Acts of 1824 and 1828 followed the great American principle\r\nof Protection laid down and supported by the South in the Act of 1816,\r\nwhile widening, increasing, and strengthening it.  Under their\r\noperation-especially under that of 1828, with its high duties on wool,\r\nhemp, iron, lead, and other staples--great prosperity smiled upon the\r\nland, and particularly upon the Free States.\r\n\r\nIn the cotton-growing belt of the South, however, where the prosperity\r\nwas relatively less, owing to the blight of Slavery, the very contrast\r\nbred discontent; and, instead of attributing it to the real cause, the\r\nadvocates of Free Trade within that region insisted that the Protective\r\nTariff was responsible for the condition of things existing there.\r\n\r\nA few restless and discontented spirits in the South had indeed agitated\r\nthe subject of Free Trade as against Protected manufactures as early as\r\n1797, and, hand in hand with it, the doctrine of States Rights.  And\r\nJefferson himself, although, as we have already seen, attached to the\r\nAmerican System of Protection and believing in its Constitutionality,\r\nunwittingly played into the hands of these Free Traders by drawing up\r\nthe famous Kentucky Resolutions of '98 touching States Rights, which\r\nwere closely followed by the Virginia Resolutions of 1799 in the same\r\nvein by Madison, also an out-and-out Protectionist.  It was mainly in\r\ncondemnation of the Alien and Sedition Laws, then so unpopular\r\neverywhere, that these resolutions were professedly fulminated, but they\r\ngave to the agitating Free Traders a States-Rights-Secession-weapon of\r\nwhich they quickly availed themselves.\r\n\r\nTheir drift may be gathered from the first of the Kentucky Resolutions\r\nof '98, which was in these words: \"Resolved, That the several States\r\ncomposing the United States of America are not united on the principle\r\nof unlimited submission to their General Government, but that, by a\r\ncompact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United\r\nStates, and of amendments thereto, they constituted a General Government\r\nfor special purposes--delegated to that Government certain definite\r\npowers, reserving, each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to\r\ntheir own self-government; and that whensoever the General Government\r\nassumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of\r\nno force; that to this compact each State acceded as a State, and as an\r\nintegral party, its co-States forming, as to itself, the other party;\r\nthat the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive\r\nor final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since\r\nthat would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the\r\nmeasure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among\r\npowers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge\r\nfor itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of\r\nredress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions, after enumerating the Alien and Sedition and certain\r\nother laws as in point, conclude by calling upon the other States to\r\njoin Kentucky in her opposition to such Federal usurpations of power as\r\nthus embodied, and express confidence: \"That they will concur with this\r\nCommonwealth in considering the said Acts as so palpably against the\r\nConstitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration that that\r\ncompact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the General\r\nGovernment, but that it will proceed in the exercise over these States,\r\nof all powers whatsoever; that they will view this as seizing the rights\r\nof the States, and consolidating them in the hands of the General\r\nGovernment, with the power assumed to bind the States (not merely as to\r\nthe cases made federal (casus foederis) but) in all cases whatsoever, by\r\nlaws made, not with their consent, but by others against their consent;\r\nthat this would be to surrender the form of government we have chosen,\r\nand live under one deriving its powers from its own will, and not from\r\nour authority; and that the co-States, returning to their natural rights\r\nin cases not made federal, will concur in declaring these Acts void and\r\nof no force, and will each take measures of its own in providing that\r\nneither these Acts, nor any others of the General Government, not\r\nplainly and intentionally authorized by the Constitution, shall be\r\nexercised within their respective territories.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of States Rights as formulated in these Resolutions,\r\nincluding the assumed right of a State to nullify laws of the General\r\nGovernment, naturally led up, as we shall see, not only to threats of\r\ndisunion, but ultimately to a dreadful sectional War waged in the effort\r\nto secure it.  That Jefferson, when he penned them, foresaw the terrible\r\nresults to flow from these specious and pernicious doctrines, is not to\r\nbe supposed for an instant; but that his conscience troubled him may be\r\nfairly inferred from the fact that he withheld from the World for twenty\r\nyears afterward the knowledge that he was their author.  It is probable\r\nthat in this case, as in others, he was a victim of that casuistry which\r\nteaches that \"the end justifies the means;\" that he hoped and believed\r\nthat the assertion of these baleful doctrines would act solely as a\r\ncheck upon any tendency to further centralization of power in the\r\nGeneral Government and insure that strict construction of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThough afterward violated by himself at the same time that he for the\r\nmoment threw aside his scruples touching African slavery, when he added\r\nto our domain the great French Slave Colony of Louisiana--was none the\r\nless the great aim of his commanding intellect; and that he fortuitously\r\nbelieved in the \"saving common sense\" of his race and country as capable\r\nof correcting an existing evil when it shall have developed into ill\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n     [Mr. Jefferson takes this very ground, in almost the same words, in\r\n     his letter, 1803, to Wilson C.  Nichols in the Louisiana Colony\r\n     purchase case, when, after proving by his own strict construction\r\n     of the Constitution that there was no power in that instrument to\r\n     make such purchase, and confessing the importance in that very case\r\n     of setting \"an example against broad construction,\" he concludes:\r\n     \"If, however, our friends shall think differently, certainly I\r\n     shall acquiesce with satisfaction; confiding that the good sense of\r\n     the country will correct the evil of construction when it shall\r\n     produce ill ejects.\"]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, however, the fact remains that the seeds thus sown by\r\nthe hands of Jefferson on the \"sacred soil\" of Virginia and Kentucky,\r\nwere dragon's teeth, destined in after years to spring up as legions of\r\narmed men battling for the subversion of that Constitution and the\r\ndestruction of that Union which he so reverenced, and which he was so\r\nlargely instrumental in founding--and which even came back in his own\r\nlife to plague him and Madison during his embargo, and Madison's war of\r\n1812-15, in the utterances and attitude of some of the New England\r\nFederalists.\r\n\r\nThe few Free Traders of the South--the Giles's and John Taylor's and men\r\nof that ilk--made up for their paucity in numbers by their unscrupulous\r\ningenuity and active zeal.  They put forth the idea that the American\r\nProtective Policy was a policy of fostering combinations by Federal\r\nlaws, the effect of which was to transfer a considerable portion of the\r\nprofits of slave labor from the Slave States to other parts of the Union\r\nwhere it was massed in the hands of a few individuals, and thus created\r\na moneyed interest which avariciously influenced the General Government\r\nto the detriment of the entire community of people, who, made restive by\r\nthe exactions of this power working through the Federal Government, were\r\nas a consequence driven to consider a possible dissolution of the Union,\r\nand make \"estimates of resources and means of defense.\"  As a means also\r\nof inflaming both the poor whites and Southern slave-holders by arousing\r\nthe apprehensions of the latter concerning the \"peculiar institution\" of\r\nSlavery, they craftily declared that \"If the maxim advanced by the\r\nadvocates of the protecting duty system will justify Congress in\r\nassuming, or rather in empowering a few capitalists to assume, the\r\ndirection of manufacturing labor, it also invests that body with a power\r\nof legislating for the direction of every other species of labor and\r\nassigning all occupations whatsoever to the care of the intelligence of\r\nmercenary combinations\"--and hence untold misery to labor.\r\n\r\nThey charged as a further means of firing the Southern heart, that this\r\nmoneyed power, born of Protection, \"works upon the passion of the States\r\nit has been able to delude by computations of their physical strength\r\nand their naval superiority; and by boasting of an ability to use the\r\nweakening circumstance of negro slavery to coerce the defrauded and\r\ndiscontented States into submission.\"  And they declared as fundamental\r\ntruths upon which they rested that \"The Federal is not a National\r\nGovernment; it is a league between nations.  By this league, a limited\r\npower only over persons and property was given to the representatives of\r\nthe united nations.  This power cannot be further extended, under the\r\npretext of national good, because the league does not create a national\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the passage of the Tariff of 1824 that gave these crafty Free\r\nTraders their first great success in spreading their doctrine of Free\r\nTrade by coupling it with questions of slave labor, States Rights, and\r\nnullification, as laid down in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions.\r\nThese arguments created great excitement throughout the South\r\n--especially in South Carolina and Georgia--which was still further\r\nincreased by the passage of the Tariff of 1828, since declared by\r\neminent authority to have been \"the highest and most protective ever\r\nadopted in this country.\"\r\n\r\n     [Mr. Greeley, in his \"History of the American Conflict,\" 1864.]\r\n\r\nPrior to the passage of this Tariff Act, excited assemblages met in some\r\nof the Southern States, and protested against it as an outrage upon\r\ntheir rights--arraying the South in seditious and treasonable attitude\r\nagainst not only the North but the Union, with threats of Secession.  At\r\none of these meetings in South Carolina, in 1827, one of their leaders\r\n--[Dr. Thomas Cooper, President of South Carolina College.]--declared that\r\n\"a drilled and managed majority\" in the House of Representatives had\r\ndetermined \"at all hazards to support the claims of the Northern\r\nmanufacturers, and to offer up the planting interest on the altar of\r\nmonopoly.\"  He denounced the American system of Protection exemplified\r\nin that Tariff measure as \"a system by which the earnings of the South\r\nare to be transferred to the North--by which the many are to be\r\nsacrificed to the few--under which powers are usurped that were never\r\nconceded--by which inequality of rights, inequality of burthens,\r\ninequality of protection, unequal laws, and unequal taxes are to be\r\nenacted and rendered permanent--that the planter and the farmer under\r\nthis system are to be considered as inferior beings to the spinner, the\r\nbleacher, and the dyer--that we of the South hold our plantations under\r\nthis system, as the serfs and operatives of the North, subject to the\r\norders and laboring for the benefit of the master-minds of\r\nMassachusetts, the lords of the spinning jenny and peers of the\r\npower-loom, who have a right to tax our earnings for their emolument,\r\nand to burthen our poverty and to swell their riches;\" and after\r\ncharacterizing Protection as \"a system of fraud, robbery and\r\nusurpation,\" he continued \"I have said that we shall ere long be\r\ncompelled to calculate the value of our Union; and to enquire of what\r\nuse to us is this most unequal alliance, by which the South has always\r\nbeen the loser and the North always the gainer.  Is it worth our while\r\nto continue this union of States, where the North demands to be our\r\nmasters and we are required to be their tributaries? who with the most\r\ninsulting mockery call the yoke they put upon our necks the 'American\r\nsystem!'  The question, however, is fast approaching the alternative of\r\nsubmission or separation.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a few days after this inflammatory speech at Columbus, S. C.,\r\ninciting South Carolinians to resist the pending Protective Tariff even\r\nto the lengths of Secession, during a grand banquet at Richmond, Va.,\r\nWilliam B. Giles--another Free Trade leader--proposed, and those present\r\ndrank a toast to the \"Tariff Schemer\" in which was embodied a\r\ndeclaration that \"The Southerners will not long pay tribute.\"  Despite\r\nthese turbulent and treasonable mutterings, however, the \"Jacksonian\r\nCongress\" passed the Act--a majority of members from the Cotton and New\r\nEngland States voting against, while the vote of the Middle and Western\r\nFree States was almost solidly for, it.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held soon after the enactment of the Tariff of 1828, at\r\nWalterborough Court House, S. C., an address was adopted and issued\r\nwhich, after reciting the steps that had been taken by South Carolina\r\nduring the previous year to oppose it, by memorials and otherwise, and\r\nstating that, despite their \"remonstrances and implorations,\" a Tariff\r\nBill had passed, not indeed, such as they apprehended, but \"ten-fold\r\nworse in all its oppressive features,\" proceeded thus:\r\n\r\n\"From the rapid step of usurpation, whether we now act or not, the day\r\nof open opposition to the pretended powers of the Constitution cannot be\r\nfar off, and it is that it may not go down in blood that we now call\r\nupon you to resist.  We feel ourselves standing underneath its mighty\r\nprotection, and declaring forth its free and recorded spirit, when we\r\nsay we must resist.  By all the great principles of liberty--by the\r\nglorious achievements of our fathers in defending them--by their noble\r\nblood poured forth like water in maintaining them--by their lives in\r\nsuffering, and their death in honor and in glory;--our countrymen! we\r\nmust resist.  Not secretly, as timid thieves or skulking smugglers--not\r\nin companies and associations, like money chafferers or stock jobbers\r\n--not separately and individually, as if this was ours and not our\r\ncountry's cause--but openly, fairly, fearlessly, and unitedly, as\r\nbecomes a free, sovereign and independent people.  Does timidity ask\r\nWHEN?  We answer NOW!\"\r\n\r\nThese inflammatory utterances, in South Carolina especially, stirred the\r\nSouthern heart more or less throughout the whole cotton belt; and the\r\npernicious principles which they embodied found ardent advocates even in\r\nthe Halls of Congress.  In the Senate, Mr. Hayne, of South Carolina, was\r\ntheir chief and most vehement spokesman, and in 1830 occurred that\r\nmemorable debate between him and Daniel Webster, which forever put an\r\nend to all reasonable justification of the doctrine of Nullification,\r\nand which furnished the ground upon which President Jackson afterward\r\nstood in denouncing and crushing it out with the strong arm of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn that great debate Mr. Hayne's propositions were that the Constitution\r\nis a \"compact between the States,\" that \"in case of a plain, palpable\r\nviolation of the Constitution by the General Government, a State may\r\ninterpose; and that this interposition is constitutional\"--a proposition\r\nwith which Mr. Webster took direct issue, in these words: \"I say, the\r\nright of a State to annul a law of Congress cannot be maintained, but on\r\nthe ground of the inalienable right of man to resist oppression; that is\r\nto say, upon the ground of revolution.  I admit that there is an\r\nultimate violent remedy, above the Constitution and in defiance of the\r\nConstitution, which may be resorted to when a revolution is to be\r\njustified.  But I do not admit that, under the Constitution, and in\r\nconformity with it, there is any mode in which a State Government, as a\r\nmember of the Union, can interfere and stop the progress of the general\r\nmovement by force of her own laws under any circumstances whatever.\"\r\nMr. Webster insisted that \"one of two things is true: either the laws of\r\nthe Union are beyond the discretion and beyond the control of the\r\nStates, or else we have no Constitution of General Government, and are\r\nthrust back again to the days of the Confederation;\" and, in concluding\r\nhis powerful argument, he declared that \"even supposing the Constitution\r\nto be a compact between the States,\" Mr. Hayne's doctrine was \"not\r\nmaintainable, because, first, the General Government is not a party to\r\nthe compact, but a Government established by it, and vested by it with\r\nthe powers of trying and deciding doubtful questions; and secondly,\r\nbecause, if the Constitution be regarded as a compact, not one State\r\nonly, but all the States are parties to that compact, and one can have\r\nno right to fix upon it her own peculiar construction.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the comparatively miserable condition of the cotton-growing States\r\nof the South was attributed by most of the Southern Free Traders solely\r\nto the Protective Tariff of 1828, yet there were some Southerners\r\nwilling to concede--as did Mr. Hayne, in the Senate (1832)--that there\r\nwere \"other causes besides the Tariff\" underlying that condition, and to\r\nadmit that \"Slaves are too improvident, too incapable of that minute,\r\nconstant, delicate attention, and that persevering industry which are\r\nessential to manufacturing establishments,\" the existence of which would\r\nhave made those States prosperous.  But such admissions were unwilling\r\nones, and the Cotton-lords held only with the more tenacity to the view\r\nthat the Tariff was the chief cause of their condition.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff Act of 1832, essentially modifying that of 1828, was passed\r\nwith a view, in part, to quiet Southern clamor.  But the Southern Cotton\r\nStates refused to be mollified.  On the contrary, the Free Traders of\r\nSouth Carolina proceeded to extreme measures, putting in action that\r\nwhich they had before but threatened.  On November 19, 1832, the leading\r\nmen of South Carolina met in Convention, and a few days thereafter\r\n--[November 24,1882]--unanimously passed an Ordinance of Nullification\r\nwhich declared the Tariff Acts of 1828 and 1832 \"Unauthorized by the\r\nConstitution,\" and \"null, void, and no law, nor binding on this State,\r\nits officers, or citizens.\"  The people of the State were forbidden by\r\nit to pay, after the ensuing February 1st, the import-duties therein\r\nimposed.  Under the provisions of the Ordinance, the State Legislature\r\nwas to pass an act nullifying these Tariff laws, and any appeal to the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court against the validity of such nullifying act\r\nwas prohibited.  Furthermore, in the event of the Federal Government\r\nattempting to enforce these Tariff laws, the people of South Carolina\r\nwould thenceforth consider themselves out of the Union, and will\r\n\"forthwith proceed to organize a separate Government, and do all other\r\nacts and things which sovereign and independent States may of right do.\"\r\n\r\nAt the subsequent meeting of the Legislature, Mr. Hayne, who had been a\r\nmember of the Convention, having resigned his seat in the United States\r\nSenate, was elected Governor of the State.  He declared in his message\r\nthat he recognized \"No allegiance as paramount to that which the\r\ncitizens of South Carolina owe to the State of their birth or their\r\nadoption\"--that doctrine of \"paramount allegiance to the State\" which in\r\nafter-years gave so much trouble to the Union and to Union-loving\r\nSoutherners--and declared that he held himself \"bound by the highest of\r\nall obligations to carry into effect, not only the Ordinance of the\r\nConvention, but every act of the Legislature, and every judgment of our\r\nown Courts, the enforcement of which may devolve upon the Executive,\"\r\nand \"if,\" continued he, \"the sacred soil of Carolina should be polluted\r\nby the footsteps of an invader, or be stained with the blood of her\r\ncitizens, shed in her defense, I trust in Almighty God * * * even should\r\nshe stand alone in this great struggle for constitutional liberty,\r\nencompassed by her enemies, that there will not be found, in the wide\r\nlimits of the State, one recreant son who will not fly to the rescue,\r\nand be ready to lay down his life in her defense.\"  In support of the\r\ncontemplated treason, he even went to the length of calling for an\r\nenrolling of volunteer forces and of holding them ready for service.\r\n\r\nBut while South Carolina stood in this treasonable and defiant attitude,\r\narming for war against the Union, there happened to be in the\r\nPresidential chair one of her own sons--General Jackson.  Foreseeing\r\nwhat was coming, he had, prior to the meeting of the Convention that\r\nframed the Nullification Ordinance, ordered General Scott to Charleston\r\nto look after \"the safety of the ports of the United States\"\r\nthereabouts, and had sent to the Collector of that port precise\r\ninstructions as to his duty to resist in all ways any and all attempts\r\nmade under such Ordinance to defeat the operation of the Tariff laws\r\naforesaid.  Having thus quietly prepared the arm of the General\r\nGovernment for the exercise of its power, he issued in December a\r\nProclamation declaring his unalterable resolution to treat Nullification\r\nas Treason--and to crush it.\r\n\r\nIn that famous document President Jackson said of Nullification: \"If\r\nthis doctrine had been established at an earlier day, the Union would\r\nhave been dissolved in its infancy.  The Excise law in Pennsylvania, the\r\nEmbargo and Non-intercourse law in the Eastern States, the Carriage-tax\r\nin Virginia, were all deemed unconstitutional, and were more unequal in\r\ntheir operation than any of the laws now complained of; but fortunately,\r\nnone of those States discovered that they had the right now claimed by\r\nSouth Carolina.  * * * The discovery of this important feature in our\r\nConstitution was reserved for the present day.  To the statesmen of\r\nSouth Carolina belongs the invention, and upon the citizens of that\r\nState will unfortunately fall the evils of reducing it to practice.  * *\r\n* I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States,\r\nassumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union,\r\ncontradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized\r\nby its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded\r\nand destructive of the great object for which it was formed.  * * * To\r\nsay that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union, is to say that\r\nthe United States are not a Nation, because it would be a solecism to\r\ncontend that any part of a Nation might dissolve its connection with the\r\nother parts, to their injury or ruin, without committing any, offense.\"\r\n\r\nFarther on, in his moving appeal to the South Carolinians, he bids them\r\nbeware of their leaders: \"Their object is disunion; be not deceived by\r\nnames.  Disunion, by armed force, is Treason.\"  And then, reminding them\r\nof the deeds of their fathers in the Revolution, he proceeds: \"I adjure\r\nyou, as you honor their memory, as you love the cause of freedom to\r\nwhich they dedicated their lives, as you prize the peace of your\r\ncountry, the lives of its best citizens, and your own fair fame, to\r\nretrace your steps.  Snatch from the archives of your State the\r\ndisorganizing edict of its Convention--bid its members to reassemble and\r\npromulgate the decided expression of your will to remain in the path\r\nwhich alone can conduct you to safety, prosperity, and honor--tell them\r\nthat, compared to disunion, all other evils are light, because that\r\nbrings with it an accumulation of all--declare that you will never take\r\nthe field unless the Star-spangled banner of your country shall float\r\nover you--that you will not be stigmatized when dead, and dishonored and\r\nscorned while you live, as the authors of the first attack on the\r\nConstitution of your country!  Its destroyers you cannot be.\"\r\n\r\nAfter asserting his firm \"determination to execute the laws-to preserve\r\nthe Union by all constitutional means\"--he concludes with the prayer,\r\n\"May the great Ruler of Nations grant, that the signal blessings with\r\nwhich He has favored, ours may not, by the madness of party, or personal\r\nambition be disregarded and lost; and may His wise providence bring\r\nthose who have produced this crisis to see the folly before they feel\r\nthe misery, of civil strife; and inspire a returning veneration for that\r\nUnion, which, if we may dare to penetrate His designs, He has chosen as\r\nthe only means of attaining the high destinies to which we may\r\nreasonably aspire.\"\r\n\r\nThe firm attitude of General Jackson, together with the wise\r\nprecautionary measures he had already taken, and the practical unanimity\r\nwith which his declaration to crush out the Treason was hailed in most\r\nof the Southern as well as the Northern States, almost at once broke the\r\nback of Nullification.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [In this connection the following letter, written at that time by\r\n     the great Chief Justice Marshall, to a cousin of his, on the\r\n     subject of State Sovereignty, is of interest, as showing how\r\n     clearly his penetrating intellect perceived the dangers to the\r\n     Union hidden in the plausible doctrine of State Rights:\r\n\r\n     RICHMOND, May 7, 1833.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n     \"I am much indebted to you for your pamphlet on Federal Relations,\r\n     which I have read with much satisfaction.  No subject, as it seems\r\n     to me, is more misunderstood or more perverted.  You have brought\r\n     into view numerous important historical facts which, in my\r\n     judgment, remove the foundation on which the Nullifiers and\r\n     Seceders have erected that superstructure which overshadows our\r\n     Union.  You have, I think, shown satisfactorily that we never have\r\n     been perfectly distinct, independent societies, sovereign in the\r\n     sense in which the Nullifiers use the term.  When colonies we\r\n     certainly were not.  We were parts of the British empire, and\r\n     although not directly connected with each other so far as respected\r\n     government, we were connected in many respects, and were united to\r\n     the same stock.  The steps we took to effect separation were, as\r\n     you have fully shown, not only revolutionary in their nature, but\r\n     they were taken conjointly.  Then, as now, we acted in many\r\n     respects as one people.  The representatives of each colony acted\r\n     for all.  Their resolutions proceeded from a common source, and\r\n     operated on the whole mass.  The army was a continental army\r\n     commanded by a continental general, and supported from a\r\n     continental treasury.  The Declaration of Independence was made by\r\n     a common government, and was made for all the States.\r\n\r\n     \"Everything has been mixed.  Treaties made by Congress have been\r\n     considered as binding all the States.  Some powers have been\r\n     exercised by Congress, some by the States separately.  The lines\r\n     were not strictly drawn.  The inability of Congress to carry its\r\n     legitimate powers into execution has gradually annulled those\r\n     powers practically, but they always existed in theory.\r\n     Independence was declared `in the name and by the authority of the\r\n     good people of these colonies.' In fact we have always been united\r\n     in some respects, separate in others.  We have acted as one people\r\n     for some purposes, as distinct societies for others.  I think you\r\n     have shown this clearly, and in so doing have demonstrated the\r\n     fallacy of the principle on which either nullification or the right\r\n     of peaceful, constitutional secession is asserted.\r\n\r\n     \"The time is arrived when these truths must be more generally\r\n     spoken, or our Union is at an end.  The idea of complete\r\n     sovereignty of the State converts our government into a league,\r\n     and, if carried into practice, dissolves the Union.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, dear sir,\r\n\r\n     \"Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n     \"J. MARSHALL.\r\n\r\n     \"HUMPHREY MARSHALL, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n     \"FRANKFORT, KY.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nullifiers hailed with pretended satisfaction the report from the\r\nHouse Committee on Ways and Means of a Bill making great reductions and\r\nequalizations of Tariff duties, as a measure complying with their\r\ndemands, and postponed the execution of the Ordinance of Nullification\r\nuntil the adjournment of Congress; and almost immediately afterward Mr.\r\nClay's Compromise Tariff Act of 1833 \"whereby  one tenth of the excess\r\nover twenty per cent. of each and every existing impost was to be taken\r\noff at the close of that year; another tenth two years thereafter; so\r\nproceeding until the 30th of June, 1842, when all duties should be\r\nreduced to a maximum of twenty per cent.\"--[Says Mr. Greeley, in his\r\nHistory aforesaid.]--agreed to by Calhoun and other Nullifiers, was\r\npassed, became a law without the signature of President Jackson, and\r\nSouth Carolina once more became to all appearances a contented,\r\nlaw-abiding State of the Union.\r\n\r\nBut after-events proved conclusively that the enactment of this\r\nCompromise Tariff was a terrible blunder, if not a crime.  Jackson had\r\nfully intended to hang Calhoun and his nullifying coadjutors if they\r\npersisted in their Treason.  He knew that they had only seized upon the\r\nTariff laws as a pretext with which to justify Disunion, and prophesied\r\nthat \"the next will be the Slavery or Negro question.\"  Jackson's\r\nforecast was correct.  Free Trade, Slavery and Secession were from that\r\ntime forward sworn allies; and the ruin wrought to our industries by the\r\ndisasters of 1840, plainly traceable to that Compromise Tariff measure\r\nof 1833, was only to be supplemented by much greater ruin and disasters\r\ncaused by the Free Trade Tariff of 1846--and to be followed by the armed\r\nRebellion of the Free Trade and Pro-Slavery States of the South in 1861,\r\nin a mad attempt to destroy the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                    GROWTH OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that during the period of the Missouri Struggle,\r\n1818-1820, the Territory of Arkansas was formed by an Act of Congress\r\nout of that part of the Missouri Territory not included in the proposed\r\nState of Missouri, and that the Act so creating the Territory of\r\nArkansas contained no provision restricting Slavery.  Early in 1836, the\r\npeople of Arkansas Territory met in Convention and formed a Constitution\r\nunder which, \"and by virtue of the treaty of cession by France to the\r\nUnited States, of the Province of Louisiana,\" they asked admission to\r\nthe Union as a State.  Among other provisions of that Constitution was a\r\nsection rendering the State Legislature powerless to pass laws for the\r\nemancipation of slaves without the consent of the owners, or to prevent\r\nemigrants to that State from bringing with them slaves.  On June 15th of\r\nthe same year, Arkansas was, under that Constitution, admitted to the\r\nUnion as a Slave State, with the sole reservation, that nothing in the\r\nAct of admission should be\" construed as an assent by Congress to all or\r\nany of the propositions contained\" in the said Constitution.\r\n\r\nLong ere this, all the Northern and Middle States had made provision for\r\nthe emancipation of such slaves as remained within their borders, and\r\nonly a few years previous (in 1829 and 1831-32) Virginia had made strong\r\nbut insufficient efforts toward the same end.  The failure to free\r\nVirginia of Slavery--the effort to accomplish which had been made by\r\nsome of the greatest of her statesmen--only served to rivet the chains\r\nof human bondage more securely throughout all the Slave States, and from\r\nthat time on, no serious agitation occurred in any one of them, looking\r\ntoward even the most gradual emancipation.  On the other hand, the\r\nadvocates of the extension of the Slave-Power by the expansion of\r\nSlave-territory, were ever on the alert, they considered it of the last\r\nimportance to maintain the balance of power between the Slave States and\r\nthe Free States.  Hence, while they had secured in 1819 the cession from\r\nSpain to the United States of the Slave-holding Floridas, and the\r\norganization of the Slave Territory of Florida in 1822--which\r\nsubsequently came in as a Slave State under the same Act (1845) that\r\nadmitted the Free State of Iowa--their greedy eyes were now cast upon\r\nthe adjoining rich territories of Mexico.\r\n\r\nEfforts had (in 1827-1829) been made to purchase from Mexico the domain\r\nwhich was known as Texas.  They had failed.  But already a part of Texas\r\nhad been settled by adventurous Americans under Mexican grants and\r\notherwise; and General Sam Houston, an adherent of the Slave Power,\r\nhaving become a leading spirit among them, fomented a revolution.  In\r\nMarch, 1836, Texas, under his guidance, proclaimed herself a Republic\r\nindependent of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe War that ensued between Texas and Mexico ended in the flight of the\r\nMexican Army and the capture of Santa Anna at San Jacinto, and a treaty\r\nrecognizing Texan independence.  In October, 1836, General Houston was\r\ninaugurated President of the Republic of Texas.  Close upon this\r\nfollowed (in August, 1837) a proposition to our Government from the\r\nTexan envoy for the annexation of Texas to the United States.  President\r\nVan Buren declined the offer.  The Northern friends of Freedom were as\r\nmuch opposed to this annexation project as the advocates of Slavery were\r\nanxious for it.  Even such conservative Northern Statesmen as Daniel\r\nWebster strongly opposed the project.  In a speech delivered in New York\r\n[1837], after showing that the chief aim of our Government in the\r\nacquisition of the Territory of Louisiana was to gain command of the\r\nmouths of the great rivers to the sea, and that in the acquisition of\r\nthe Floridas our policy was based on similar considerations, Mr. Webster\r\ndeclared that \"no such necessity, no such policy, requires the\r\nannexation of Texas,\" and that we ought \"for numerous and powerful\r\nreasons to be content with our present boundaries.  He recognized that\r\nSlavery already existed under the guarantees of the Constitution and\r\nthose guarantees must be fulfilled; that \"Slavery, as it exists in the\r\nStates, is beyond the power of Congress.  It is a concern of the States\r\nthemselves,\" but \"when we come to speak of admitting new States, the\r\nsubject assumes an entirely different aspect.  Our rights and our duties\r\nare then both different.  The Free States, and all the States, are then\r\nat liberty to accept or to reject;\" and he added, \"In my opinion the\r\npeople of the United States will not consent to bring into the Union a\r\nnew, vastly extensive and Slaveholding country, large enough for a half\r\na dozen or a dozen States.  In my opinion, they ought not to consent to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nFarther on, in the same speech--after alluding to the strong feeling in\r\nthe Northern States against the extension of Slavery, not only as a\r\nquestion of politics, but of conscience and religious conviction as\r\nwell-he deems him a rash man indeed \"who supposes that a feeling of this\r\nkind is to be trifled with or despised.\"  Said he: \"It will assuredly\r\ncause itself to be respected.  It may be reasoned with; it may be made\r\nwilling--I believe it is entirely willing--to fulfill all existing\r\nengagements and all existing duties--to uphold and defend the\r\nConstitution as it is established, with whatever regrets about some\r\nprovisions which it does actually contain.  But to coerce it into\r\nsilence, to endeavor to restrain its free expression, to seek to\r\ncompress and confine it, warm as it is, and more heated as such\r\nendeavors would inevitably render it,--should this be attempted, I know\r\nnothing, even in the Constitution or in the Union itself, which would\r\nnot be endangered by the explosion which might follow.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1840, General Harrison, the Whig candidate, was elected to the\r\nPresidency, but died within a few weeks after his inauguration in 1841,\r\nand was succeeded by John Tyler.  The latter favored the Slave Power;\r\nand on April 12th, 1844, John C.  Calhoun, his Secretary of State,\r\nconcluded with Texas a treaty of annexation--which was, however,\r\nrejected by the Senate.  Meanwhile the public mind was greatly agitated\r\nover the annexation and other, questions.\r\n\r\n     [In the London Index, a journal established there by Jefferson\r\n     Davis's agents to support the cause of the rebellious States, a\r\n     communication appeared during the early part of the war, Dec.  4,\r\n     1861, supposed to have been written by Mr. Mason, of Virginia, in\r\n     which he said: \"To tell the Norths, the Butes, the Wedderburns of\r\n     the present day, that previous to the year 1839 the sovereign\r\n     States of the South had unalterably resolved on the specific ground\r\n     of the violation of the Federal Constitution by the tariff of\r\n     spoliation which the New England States had imposed upon them--to\r\n     secede from the Union; to tell them that in that year the leader of\r\n     the South, Calhoun, urged an English gentleman, to whom he had\r\n     fully explained the position of the South, and the intolerable\r\n     tyranny which the North inflicted upon it, to be the bearer of\r\n     credentials from the chief persons of the South, in order to invite\r\n     the attention of the British Government to the coming event; that\r\n     on his death-bed (Washington, March 31, 1850), he called around him\r\n     his political friends--one of whom is now in England--warned them\r\n     that in no event could the Union survive the Presidential election\r\n     of 1860, though it might possibly break up before that urged them\r\n     to be prepared; leaving with his dying words the sacred cause of\r\n     Southern secession a solemn legacy in their hands--to have told\r\n     this to the Norths and Dartmouths of the present day, with more and\r\n     even stronger evidence of the coming events of November, 1860,\r\n     would have been like speaking to the stones of the street.  In\r\n     November, 1860, they were thoroughly ignorant of all the momentous\r\n     antecedents of secession--of their nature, their character, their\r\n     bearing, import, and consequences.\"\r\n\r\n     In the same correspondence the distinguished Rebel emissary\r\n     substantially let out the fact that Calhoun was indirectly, through\r\n     himself (Mason), in secret communication with the British\r\n     Government as far back as 1841, with a view to securing its\r\n     powerful aid in his aforesaid unalterable resolve to Secede from\r\n     the Union; and then Mr. Mason pleads--but pleads in vain--for the\r\n     armed intervention of England at this later day.  Said he:\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1841 the late Sir William Napier sent in two plans for\r\n     subduing the Union, to the War Office, in the first of which the\r\n     South was to be treated as an enemy, in the second as a friend and\r\n     ally.  I was much consulted by him as to the second plan and was\r\n     referred to by name in it, as he showed by the acknowledgment of\r\n     this in Lord Fitzroy Somerset's letter of reply.  This plan fully\r\n     provided for the contingency of an invasion of Canada, and its\r\n     application would, in eighteen or twenty months, have reduced the\r\n     North to a much more impotent condition than it exhibits at\r\n     present.  At this very moment the most difficult portion of that\r\n     plan has been perfectly accomplished by the South itself; and the\r\n     North, in accordance with Sir William Napier's expectations, now\r\n     lies helpless before England, and at our absolute mercy.  Nor is\r\n     there any doubt of this, and if Lord Palmerston is not aware of it\r\n     Mr. Seward certainly is.  We have nothing remaining to do but to\r\n     stretch out our arm in the way Sir William Napier proposed, and the\r\n     Northern power--power as we ignorantly call it--must come to an\r\n     end.  Sir William knew and well estimated the elements of which\r\n     that quasi power consisted; and he knew how to apply the\r\n     substantive power of England to dissolve it.  In the best interest\r\n     of humanity, I venture to say that it is the duty of England to\r\n     apply this power without further delay--its duty to itself, to its\r\n     starving operatives, to France, to Europe, and to humanity.  And in\r\n     the discharge of this great duty to the world at large there will\r\n     not even be the dignity of sacrifice or danger.\"]\r\n\r\nThreats and counter-threats of Disunion were made on either hand by the\r\nopponents and advocates of Slavery-extension through annexation; nor was\r\nit less agitated on the subject of a Protective Tariff.\r\n\r\nThe Compromise Tariff of 1833, together with President Jackson's\r\nupheaval of our financial system, produced, as has already been hinted,\r\nterrible commercial disasters. \"In 1840,\" says competent authority, \"all\r\nprices had ruinously fallen; production had greatly diminished, and in\r\nmany departments of industry had practically ceased; thousands of\r\nworking men were idle, with no hope of employment, and their families\r\nsuffering from want.  Our farmers were without markets, their products\r\nrotted in their barns, and their lands, teeming with rich harvests, were\r\nsold by the sheriff for debts and taxes.  The Tariff, which robbed our\r\nindustries of Protection failed to supply Government with its necessary\r\nrevenues.  The National Treasury in consequence was bankrupt, and the\r\ncredit of the Nation had sunk very low.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay himself stated \"the average depression in the value of property\r\nunder that state of things which existed before the Tariff of 1842 came\r\nto the rescue of the country, at fifty per cent.\"  And hence it was that\r\nProtection was made the chief issue of the Presidential campaign of\r\n1840, which eventuated in the election of Harrison and Tyler, and in the\r\nTariff Act of August 30, 1842, which revived our trade and industries,\r\nand brought back to the land a full measure of prosperity.  With those\r\ndisasters fresh in the minds of the people, Protection continued to be a\r\nleading issue in the succeeding Presidential campaign of 1844--but\r\ncoupled with the Texas-annexation issue.  In that campaign Henry Clay\r\nwas the candidate of the Whig party and James K. Polk of the Democratic\r\nparty.  Polk was an ardent believer in the annexation policy and stood\r\nupon a platform declaring for the \"re-occupation of Oregon and the\r\nre-annexation of Texas at the earliest practicable moment\"--as if the\r\nprefix \"re\" legitimatized the claim in either case; Clay, on the other\r\nhand, held that we had \"fairly alienated our title to Texas by solemn\r\nNational compacts, to the fulfilment of which we stand bound by good\r\nfaith and National honor;\" that \"Annexation and War with Mexico are\r\nidentical,\" and that he was \"not willing to involve this country in a\r\nforeign War for the object of acquiring Texas.\"\r\n\r\n     [In his letter of April 17, 1844, published in the National\r\n     Intelligencer.]\r\n\r\nAs to the Tariff issue also, Clay was the acknowledged champion of the\r\nAmerican system of Protection, while Polk was opposed to it, and was\r\nsupported by the entire Free-trade sentiment, whether North or South.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign progressed, it became evident that Clay would be\r\nelected.  Then occurred some of those fatalities which have more than\r\nonce, in the history of Presidential campaigns, overturned the most\r\nreasonable expectations and defeated the popular will.  Mr. Clay\r\ncommitted a blunder and Mr. Polk an equivocation--to use the mildest\r\npossible term.  Mr. Clay was induced by Southern friends to write a\r\nletter--[Published in the North Alabamian, Aug.  16, 1844.]--in which,\r\nafter stating that \"far from having any personal objection to the\r\nannexation of Texas, I should be glad to see it--without dishonor,\r\nwithout War, with the common consent of the Union, and upon just and\r\nfair terms,\" he added: \"I do not think that the subject of Slavery ought\r\nto affect the question, one way or the other.\"  Mr. Polk, on the other\r\nhand, wrote a letter in which he declared it to be \"the duty of the\r\nGovernment to extend, as far as it may be practicable to do so, by its\r\nrevenue laws and all other means within its power, fair and just\r\nProtection to all the great interests of the whole Union, embracing\r\nAgriculture, Manufactures, the Mechanic Arts, Commerce and Navigation.\"\r\nThis was supplemented by a letter (August 8, 1844) from Judge Wilson\r\nMcCandless of Pennsylvania, strongly upholding the Protective principle,\r\nclaiming that Clay in his Compromise Tariff Bill had abandoned it, and\r\nthat Polk and Dallas had \"at heart the true interests of Pennsylvania.\"\r\nClay, thus betrayed by the treachery of Southern friends, was greatly\r\nweakened, while Polk, by his beguiling letter, backed by the false\r\ninterpretation put upon it by powerful friends in the North, made the\r\nNorth believe him a better Protectionist than Clay.\r\n\r\nPolk was elected, and rewarded the misplaced confidence by making Robert\r\nJ.  Walker his Secretary of the Treasury, and, largely through that\r\ngreat Free Trader's exertions, secured a repeal by Congress of the\r\nProtective Tariff of 1842 and the enactment of the ruinous Free Trade\r\nTariff of 1846.  Had Clay carried New York, his election was secure.  As\r\nit happened, Polk had a plurality in New York of but 5,106 in an immense\r\nvote, and that slim plurality was given to him by the Abolitionists\r\nthrowing away some 15,000 on Birney.  And thus also it curiously\r\nhappened that it was the Abolition vote which secured the election of\r\nthe candidate who favored immediate annexation and the extension of the\r\nSlave Power!\r\n\r\nEmboldened and apparently sustained by the result of the election, the\r\nSlave Power could not await the inauguration of Mr. Polk, but proceeded\r\nat once, under whip and spur, to drive the Texas annexation scheme\r\nthrough Congress; and two days before the 4th of March, 1845, an Act\r\nconsenting to the admission of the Republic of Texas as a State of the\r\nUnion was approved by President Tyler.\r\n\r\nIn that Act it was provided that \"New States of convenient size, not\r\nexceeding four in number, in addition to the said State of Texas, and\r\nhaving sufficient population, may hereafter, by the consent of said\r\nState, be formed out of the territory thereof, which shall be entitled\r\nto admission under the provisions of the Federal Constitution; and such\r\nStates as may be formed out of that portion of said territory lying\r\nsouth of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, commonly\r\nknown as the Missouri Compromise line, shall be admitted into the Union\r\nwith or without Slavery, as the people of each State asking admission\r\nmay desire.  And in such State or States as shall be formed out of said\r\nterritory north of said Missouri Compromise line, Slavery or involuntary\r\nservitude (except for crime) shall be prohibited.\"  As has been lucidly\r\nstated by another,--[Greeley's History]--\"while seeming to curtail and\r\ncircumscribe Slavery north of the above parallel (that of 36  30' north\r\nlatitude), this measure really extended it northward to that parallel,\r\nwhich it had not yet approached, under the flag of Texas, within\r\nhundreds of miles.  But the chief end of this sham Compromise was the\r\ninvolving of Congress in an indirect indorsement of the claim of Texas\r\nto the entire left bank of the Rio Grande, from its mouth to its source;\r\nand this was effected.\"\r\n\r\nTexas quickly consented to the Act of annexation, and in December, 1845,\r\na Joint Resolution formally admitting her as a State of the Union,\r\nreported by Stephen A.  Douglas, was duly passed.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1846, the American forces under General Taylor, which had been\r\ndispatched to protect Texas from threatened assault, were attacked by\r\nthe Mexican army, which at Palo Alto was badly defeated and at Resaca de\r\nla Palma driven back across the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nCongress immediately declared that by this invasion a state of War\r\nexisted between Mexico and the United States.  Thus commenced the War\r\nwith Mexico--destined to end in the triumph of the American Army, and\r\nthe acquisition of large areas of territory to the United States.  In\r\nanticipation of such triumph, President Polk lost little time in asking\r\nan appropriation of over two million dollars by Congress to facilitate\r\nnegotiations for peace with, and territorial cession from, Mexico.  And\r\na Bill making such appropriation was quickly passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives--but with the following significant proviso attached,\r\nwhich had been offered by Mr. Wilmot: \"Provided.  That as an express and\r\nfundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory from the\r\nRepublic of Mexico by the United States, by virtue of any treaty that\r\nmay be negotiated between them, and to the use by the Executive of the\r\nmoneys herein appropriated, neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude\r\nshall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime,\r\nwhereof the party shall first be duly convicted.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Senate upon the Wilmot proviso, which immediately\r\nensued, was cut short by the expiration of the Session of Congress--and\r\nthe Bill accordingly failed of passage.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1848, the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was made between\r\nMexico and the United States, and Peace reigned once more.  About the\r\nsame time a Bill was passed by the Senate providing Territorial\r\nGovernments for Oregon, California and New Mexico, which provided for\r\nthe reference of all questions touching Slavery in such Territories to\r\nthe United States Supreme Court, for arbitration.  The Bill, however,\r\nfailed in the House.  The ensuing Presidential campaign resulted in the\r\nelection of General Taylor, the Whig candidate, who was succeeded upon\r\nhis death, July 10, 1850, by Fillmore.  Meanwhile, on the Oregon\r\nTerritory Bill, in 1848, a strong effort had been made by Mr. Douglas\r\nand others to incorporate a provision extending to the Pacific Ocean the\r\nMissouri Compromise line of 36  30' of north latitude and extending to\r\nall future organizations of Territories of the United States the\r\nprinciples of said Compromise.  This provision was adopted by the\r\nSenate, but the House struck it from the Bill; the Senate receded, and\r\nOregon was admitted as a Free Territory.  But the conflict in Congress\r\nbetween those who would extend and those who would restrict Slavery\r\nstill continued, and indeed gathered vehemence with time.  In 1850,\r\nCalifornia was clamoring for admission as a Free State to the Union, and\r\nNew Mexico and Utah sought to be organized under Territorial\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nIn the heated discussions upon questions growing out of bills for these\r\npurposes, and to rectify the boundaries of Texas, it was no easy matter\r\nto reach an agreement of any sort.  Finally, however, the Compromise of\r\n1850, offered by Mr. Clay, was practically agreed to and carried out,\r\nand under it: California was admitted as a Free State; New Mexico and\r\nUtah were admitted to Territorial organization without a word pro or con\r\non the subject of Slavery; the State of Texas was awarded a pecuniary\r\ncompensation for the rectification of her boundaries; the Slave Trade in\r\nthe District of Columbia was abolished; and a more effectual Fugitive\r\nSlave Act passed.\r\n\r\nBy both North and South, this Compromise of 1850, and the measures\r\ngrowing out of it, were very generally acquiesced in, and for a while it\r\nseemed as though a permanent settlement of the Slavery question had been\r\nreached.  But in the Fugitive Slave law, thus hastily enacted, lay\r\nembedded the seed for further differences and excitements, speedily to\r\ngerminate.  In its operation it proved not only unnecessarily cruel and\r\nharsh, in the manner of the return to bondage of escaped slaves, but\r\nalso afforded a shield and support to the kidnapping of Free Negroes\r\nfrom Northern States.  The frequency of arrests in the Northern States,\r\nand the accompanying circumstances of cruelty and brutality in the\r\nexecution of the law, soon made it especially odious throughout the\r\nNorth, and created an active feeling of commiseration for the unhappy\r\nvictims of the Slave Power, which greatly intensified and increased the\r\ngrowing Anti-Slavery sentiment in the Free States.\r\n\r\nIn 1852-53, an attempt was made in Congress to organize into the\r\nTerritory of Nebraska, the region of country lying west of Iowa and\r\nMissouri.  Owing to the opposition of the South the Bill was defeated.\r\nIn 1853-4 a similar Bill was reported to the Senate by Mr. Douglas, but\r\nafterward at his own instance recommitted to the Committee on\r\nTerritories, and reported back by him again in such shape as to create,\r\ninstead of one, two Territories, that portion directly west of Missouri\r\nto be called Kansas, and the balance to be known as Nebraska--one of the\r\nsections of the Bill enacting:\r\n\r\n\"That in order to avoid all misconstruction it is hereby declared to be\r\nthe true intent and meaning of this Act, so far as the question of\r\nSlavery is concerned, to carry into practical operation the following\r\npropositions and principles, established by the Compromise measures of\r\n1850, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"First, That all questions pertaining to Slavery in the Territories, and\r\nthe new States to be formed therefrom, are to be left to the decision of\r\nthe people residing therein through their appropriate representatives.\r\n\r\n\"Second, That 'all cases involving title to slaves,' and 'questions of\r\npersonal freedom,' are referred to the adjudication of the local\r\ntribunals with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"Third, That the provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, in respect to fugitives from service, are to be carried into\r\nfaithful execution in all the `organized Territories,' the same as in\r\nthe States.\"\r\n\r\nThe sections authorizing Kansas and Nebraska to elect and send delegates\r\nto Congress also prescribed:\r\n\r\n\"That the Constitution, and all laws of the United States which are not\r\nlocally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within the\r\nsaid Territory, as elsewhere in the United States, except the section of\r\nthe Act preparatory to the admission of Missouri into the Union,\r\napproved March 6th, 1820, which was superseded by the principles of the\r\nLegislation of 1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures, and is\r\ndeclared inoperative.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when \"explaining this Kansas-Nebraska Bill\" Mr. Douglas announced\r\nthat, in reporting it, \"The object of the Committee was neither to\r\nlegislate Slavery in or out of the Territories; neither to introduce nor\r\nexclude it; but to remove whatever obstacle Congress had put there, and\r\napply the doctrine of Congressional Non-intervention in accordance with\r\nthe principles of the Compromise Measures of 1850, and allow the people\r\nto do as they pleased upon this as well as all other matters affecting\r\ntheir interests.\"\r\n\r\nA vigorous and able debate ensued.  A motion by Mr. Chase to strike out\r\nthe words \"which was superseded by the principles of the legislation of\r\n1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures,\" was defeated decisively.\r\nSubsequently Mr. Douglas moved to strike out the same words and insert\r\nin place of them, these: \"which being inconsistent with the principles\r\nof Non-intervention by Congress with Slavery in the States and\r\nTerritories, as recognized by the legislation of 1850 (commonly called\r\nthe Compromise Measures), is hereby declared inoperative and void; it\r\nbeing the true intent and meaning of this Act not to legislate Slavery\r\ninto any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave\r\nthe people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic\r\ninstitutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States\"--and the motion was agreed to by a vote of 35 yeas to 10\r\nnays.  Mr. Chase immediately moved to add to the amendment just adopted\r\nthese words: \"Under which, the people of the Territory, through their\r\nappropriate representatives, may, if they see fit, prohibit the\r\nexistence of Slavery therein;\" but this motion was voted down by 36 nays\r\nto 10 yeas.  This developed the rat in the meal-tub.  The people were to\r\nbe \"perfectly free\" to act either way on the subject of Slavery, so long\r\nas they did not prohibit Slavery!  In this shape the Bill passed the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment in the North was greatly stirred by this direct attempt\r\nto repeal the Missouri Compromise.  But by the superior parliamentary\r\ntactics of Southern Representatives in the House, whereby the radical\r\nfriends of Freedom were shut out from the opportunity of amendment, a\r\nHouse Bill essentially the same as the Senate Bill was subsequently\r\npassed by the House, under the previous question, and afterward rapidly\r\npassed the Senate, and was approved by the President.  At once commenced\r\nthat long and terrible struggle between the friends of Free-Soil and the\r\nfriends of Slavery, for the possession of Kansas, which convulsed the\r\nwhole Country for years, and moistened the soil of that Territory with\r\nstreams of blood, shed in numerous \"border-ruffian\" conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe Territorial Government of Kansas was organized late in 1854, and an\r\n\"election\" for Delegate held, at which the Pro-Slavery candidate\r\n(Whitfield) was fraudulently elected.  On March 30, 1855, a Territorial\r\nLegislature was similarly chosen by Pro-Slavery voters \"colonized\" from\r\nMissouri.  That Legislature, upon its meeting, proceeded at once to\r\nenact most outrageous Pro-Slavery laws, which being vetoed by the\r\nFree-Soil Governor (Reeder), were passed over the veto, and the Free-Soil\r\nGovernor had to give place to one who favored Slavery in Kansas.  But\r\nthe Free-Soil settlers of Kansas, in Mass Convention at Big Springs,\r\nutterly repudiated the bogus Legislature and all its acts, to which they\r\nrefused submission.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these radical differences, two separate elections for\r\nDelegate in Congress were held by the opposing factions, at one of which\r\nwas elected the Pro-Slavery Whitfield, and at the other the Free-Soiler\r\nReeder.  Furthermore, under a call issued by the Big Springs Convention,\r\na Free-State Constitutional Convention was held in October, 1855, at\r\nTopeka, which framed a Free-State Constitution, and asked admission\r\nunder it to the Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, the House of Representatives--which, after a protracted\r\nstruggle, had elected N. P. Banks Speaker--passed a Bill, by a bare\r\nmajority, admitting Kansas under her Topeka Constitution; but the Senate\r\ndefeated it.  July 4, 1856, by order of President Pierce, the Free-State\r\nLegislature, chosen under the Topeka Constitution to meet at Topeka, was\r\ndispersed by United States Troops.  Yet, despite all oppositions,\r\ndiscouragements, and outrages, the Free-State population of\r\nKansas continued to increase from immigration.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, the Pro-Slavery Legislature elected by the Pro-Slavery voters\r\nat their own special election--the Free-State voters declining to\r\nparticipate--called a Constitutional Convention at Lecompton, which\r\nformed a Pro-Slavery Constitution.  This was submitted to the people in\r\nsuch dexterous manner that they could only vote \"For the Constitution\r\nwith Slavery\" or \"For the Constitution without Slavery\"--and, as the\r\nConstitution prescribed that \"the rights of property in Slaves now in\r\nthe Territory, shall in no manner be interfered with,\" to vote \"for the\r\nConstitution Without Slavery\" was an absurdity only paralleled by the\r\ncourse of the United States Senate in refusing to permit the people of\r\nKansas \"to prohibit Slavery\" while at the same time declaring them\r\n\"perfectly free to act\" as they chose in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, with Slavery, was thus adopted by a vote of over\r\n6,000.  But in the meanwhile, at another general election held for the\r\npurpose, and despite all the frauds perpetrated by the Pro-Slavery men,\r\na Free-State Legislature, and Free-State Delegate to Congress had been\r\nelected; and this Legislature submitted the Lecompton Pro-Slavery\r\nConstitution to the people, January 4, 1858, so that they could vote:\r\n\"For the Lecompton Constitution with Slavery,\" \"For the Lecompton\r\nConstitution without Slavery,\" or \"Against the Lecompton Constitution.\"\r\nThe consequence was that the Lecompton Constitution was defeated by a\r\nmajority of over 10,000 votes--the Missouri Pro-Slavery colonists\r\ndeclining to recognize the validity of any further election on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in part upon the issues growing out of this Kansas conflict,\r\nthe political parties of the Nation had passed through another\r\nPresidential campaign (1856), in which the Democratic candidate Buchanan\r\nhad been elected over Fremont the \"Republican,\" and Fillmore the\r\n\"American,\" candidates.  Both Houses of Congress being now Democratic,\r\nMr. Buchanan recommended them to accept and ratify the Lecompton\r\nPro-Slavery Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1858, the Senate passed a Bill--against the efforts of Stephen\r\nA.  Douglas--accepting it.  In the House, however, a substitute offered\r\nby Mr. Montgomery (Douglas Democrat) known as the Crittenden-Montgomery\r\nCompromise, was adopted.  The Senate refused to concur, and the report\r\nof a Committee of Conference--providing for submitting to the Kansas\r\npeople a proposition placing limitations upon certain public land\r\nadvantages stipulated for in the Lecompton Constitution, and in case\r\nthey rejected the proposition that another Constitutional Convention\r\nshould be held--was adopted by both Houses; and the proposition being\r\nrejected by the people of Kansas, the Pro-Slavery Lecompton Constitution\r\nfell with it.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 a Convention, called by the Territorial Legislature for the\r\npurpose, met at Wyandot, and framed a Free State Constitution which was\r\nadopted by the people in October of that year, and at the ensuing State\r\nelection in December the State went Republican.  In April, 1860, the\r\nHouse of Representatives passed a Bill admitting Kansas as a State under\r\nthat Constitution, but the Democratic Senate adjourned without action on\r\nthe Bill; and it was not until early in 1861 that Kansas was at last\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Free Trade Tariff of 1846 had produced the train of\r\nbusiness and financial disasters that its opponents predicted.  Instead\r\nof prosperity everywhere in the land, there was misery and ruin.  Even\r\nthe discovery and working of the rich placer mines of California and the\r\nconsequent flow, in enormous volume, of her golden treasure into the\r\nEastern States, could not stay-the wide-spread flood of disaster.\r\nPresident Fillmore, who had succeeded General Taylor on the latter's\r\ndeath, frequently called the attention of Congress to the evils produced\r\nby this Free Trade, and to the necessity of protecting our manufactures\r\n\"from ruinous competition from abroad.\"  So also with his successor,\r\nPresident Buchanan, who, in his Message of 1857, declared that \"In the\r\nmidst of unsurpassed plenty in all the productions and in all the\r\nelements of national wealth, we find our manufactures suspended, our\r\npublic works retarded, our private enterprises of different kinds\r\nabandoned, and thousands of useful laborers thrown out of employment and\r\nreduced to want.\"  Further than this, the financial credit of the Nation\r\nwas at zero.  It was financially bankrupt before the close of Buchanan's\r\nPresidential term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                          POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY.\r\n\r\nBut now occurred the great Presidential struggle of 1860 --which\r\ninvolved not alone the principles of Protection, but those of human\r\nFreedom, and the preservation of the Union itself-between Abraham\r\nLincoln of Illinois, the candidate of the Republican party, as against\r\nStephen A. Douglas of Illinois, the National or Douglas-Democratic\r\ncandidate, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, the Administration or\r\nBreckinridge-Democratic candidate, and John Bell of Tennessee, the\r\ncandidate of the Bell-Union party.  The great preliminary struggle which\r\nlargely influenced the determination of the Presidential political\r\nconflict of 1860, had, however, taken place in the State of Illinois,\r\ntwo years previously.  To that preliminary political contest of 1858,\r\ntherefore, we will now turn our eyes--and, in order to fully understand\r\nit, it may be well to glance back over a few years.  In 1851 the\r\nLegislature of Illinois had adopted--[The vote in the House being 65\r\nyeas to 4 nays.]--the following resolution: \"Resolved, That our Liberty\r\nand Independence are based upon the right of the people to form for\r\nthemselves such a government as they may choose; that this great\r\nprinciple, the birthright of freemen, the gift of Heaven, secured to us\r\nby the blood of our ancestors, ought to be secured to future\r\ngenerations, and no limitation ought to be applied to this power in the\r\norganization of any Territory of the United States, of either\r\nTerritorial Government or State Constitution, provided the government so\r\nestablished shall be Republican and in conformity with the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\"  This resolution was a practical endorsement of\r\nthe course of Stephen A. Douglas in supporting the Compromise measures\r\nof 1850, which he had defended as being \"all founded upon the great\r\nprinciple that every people ought to possess the right to form and\r\nregulate their own domestic institutions in their own way,\" and that\r\n\"the same principle\" should be \"extended to all of the Territories of\r\nthe United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his views and the resolution aforesaid, Mr. Douglas\r\nin 1854, as we have already seen, incorporated in the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nBill a clause declaring it to be \"the true intent and meaning of the Act\r\nnot to legislate Slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHis position, as stated by himself, was, substantially that the\r\nLecompton Pro-Slavery Constitution was a fraud upon the people of\r\nKansas, in that it did not embody the will of that people; and he denied\r\nthe right of Congress to force a Constitution upon an unwilling people\r\n--without regard, on his part, to whether that Constitution allowed or\r\nprohibited Slavery or any other thing, whether good or bad.  He held\r\nthat the people themselves were the sole judges of whether it is good or\r\nbad, and whether desirable or not.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States had in the meantime made a\r\ndecision in a case afterward known as the \"Dred Scott case,\" which was\r\nheld back until after the Presidential election of 1856 had taken place,\r\nand added fuel to the political fire already raging.  Dred Scott was a\r\nNegro Slave.  His owner voluntarily took him first into a Free State,\r\nand afterward into a Territory which came within the Congressional\r\nprohibitive legislation aforesaid.  That decision in brief was\r\nsubstantially that no Negro Slave imported from Africa, nor his\r\ndescendant, can be a citizen of any State within the meaning of the\r\nConstitution; that neither the Congress nor any Territorial Legislature\r\nhas under the Constitution of the United States, the power to exclude\r\nSlavery from any Territory of the United States; and that it is for the\r\nState Courts of the Slave State, into which the negro has been conveyed\r\nby his master, and not for the United States Courts, to decide whether\r\nthat Negro, having been held to actual Slavery in a Free State, has, by\r\nvirtue of residence in such State, himself become Free.\r\n\r\nNow it was, that the meaning of the words, \"subject only to the\r\nConstitution,\" as used in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, began to be\r\ndiscerned.  For if the people of a Territory were to be \"perfectly\r\nfree,\" to deal with Slavery as they chose, \"subject only to the\r\nConstitution\" they were by this Judicial interpretation of that\r\ninstrument \"perfectly free\" to deal with Slavery in any way so long as\r\nthey did not attempt \"to exclude\" it!  The thing was all one-sided.\r\nMr. Douglas's attitude in inventing the peculiar phraseology in the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Act--which to some seemed as if expressly \"made to\r\norder\" for the Dred Scott decision--was criticized with asperity; the\r\npopularity, however, of his courageous stand against President Buchanan\r\non the Lecompton fraud, seemed to make it certain that, his term in the\r\nUnited States Senate being about to expire, he would be overwhelmingly\r\nre-elected to that body.\r\n\r\nBut at this juncture occurred something, which for a long time held the\r\nresult in doubt, and drew the excited attention of the whole Nation to\r\nIllinois as the great battle-ground.  In 1858 a Republican State\r\nConvention was held at Springfield, Ill., which nominated Abraham\r\nLincoln as the Republican candidate for United States Senator to succeed\r\nSenator Douglas in the National Legislature.  On June 16th--after such\r\nnomination--Mr. Lincoln made to the Convention a speech--in which, with\r\ngreat and incisive power, he assailed Mr. Douglas's position as well as\r\nthat of the whole Democratic Pro-Slavery Party, and announced in compact\r\nand cogent phrase, from his own point of view, the attitude, upon the\r\nSlavery question, of the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nIn that remarkable speech--which at once attracted the attention of the\r\nCountry--Mr. Lincoln said: \"We are now far into the fifth year, since a\r\npolicy was initiated with the avowed object, and confident promise, of\r\nputting an end to Slavery agitation.  Under the operation of that\r\npolicy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly\r\naugmented.  In my opinion it will not cease, until a crisis shall have\r\nbeen reached and passed.  'A House divided against itself cannot stand.'\r\nI believe this Government cannot endure permanently half Slave and half\r\nFree.  I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not expect the\r\nHouse to fall--but I do expect it will cease to be divided.  It will\r\nbecome all one thing, or all the other.  Either the opponents of Slavery\r\nwill arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind\r\nshall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction; or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become\r\nalike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as\r\nSouth.\"\r\n\r\n     [Governor Seward's announcement of an \"irrepressible conflict\" was\r\n     made four months later.]\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to lay bare and closely analyze the history of all\r\nthat had been done, during the four years preceding, to produce the\r\nprevailing condition of things touching human Slavery; describing it as\r\nresulting from that, \"now almost complete legal combination-piece of\r\nmachinery, so to speak--compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the Dred\r\nScott decision.\"  After stating the several points of that decision, and\r\nthat the doctrine of the \"Sacred right of self-government\" had been\r\nperverted by the Nebraska \"Squatter Sovereignty,\" argument to mean that,\r\n\"if any one man chose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed\r\nto object,\" he proceeded to show the grounds upon which he charged\r\n\"pre-concert\" among the builders of that machinery.  Said he: \"The people\r\nwere to be left perfectly free, 'subject only to the Constitution.'\r\nWhat the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could not see.\r\nPlainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche for the Dred Scott\r\ndecision to afterward come in and declare the perfect freedom of the\r\npeople to be just no freedom at all.  Why was the amendment, expressly\r\ndeclaring the right of the people, voted down?  Plainly enough now, the\r\nadoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.\r\nWhy was the Court decision held up?  Why even a Senator's individual\r\nopinion withheld, till after the Presidential election?  Plainly enough\r\nnow: the speaking out then would have damaged the 'perfectly free'\r\nargument upon which the election was to be carried.  Why the outgoing\r\nPresident's felicitation on the indorsement?  Why the delay of a\r\nre-argument?  Why the incoming President's advance exhortation in favor of\r\nthe decision?  These things look like the cautious patting and petting\r\nof a spirited horse, preparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded\r\nthat he may give the rider a fall.  And why the hasty after-indorsement\r\nof the decision, by the President and others?  We cannot absolutely know\r\nthat all these exact adaptations are the result of pre-concert.  But\r\nwhen we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know\r\nhave been gotten out at different times and places and by different\r\nworkmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James--[Douglas, Pierce, Taney\r\nand Buchanan.]--for instance--and when we see these timbers joined\r\ntogether, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all\r\nthe tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and\r\nproportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective\r\nplaces, and not a piece too many or too few--not omitting even the\r\nscaffolding, or, if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the\r\nframe exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in--in such a\r\ncase, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and\r\nRoger and James all understood one another from the beginning, and all\r\nworked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first blow was\r\nstruck.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew attention also to the fact that by the Nebraska Bill the people\r\nof a State, as well as a Territory, were to be left \"perfectly free,\"\r\n\"subject only to the Constitution,\" and that the object of lugging a\r\n\"State\" into this merely Territorial law was to enable the United States\r\nSupreme Court in some subsequent decision to declare, when the public\r\nmind had been sufficiently imbued with Judge Douglas's notion of not\r\ncaring \"whether Slavery be voted up or voted down,\" that \"the\r\nConstitution of the United States does not permit a State to exclude\r\nSlavery from its limits\"--which would make Slavery \"alike lawful in all\r\nthe States.\"  That, he declared to be Judge Douglas's present mission:\r\n--\"His avowed mission is impressing the 'public heart' to care nothing\r\nabout it.\"  Hence Mr. Lincoln urged Republicans to stand by their cause,\r\nwhich must be placed in the hands of its friends, \"Whose hands are free,\r\nwhose hearts are in the work--who do care for the result;\" for he held\r\nthat \"a living dog is better than a dead lion.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 9, 1858, at Chicago, Mr. Douglas (Mr. Lincoln\r\nbeing present) spoke to an enthusiastic assemblage, which he fitly\r\ndescribed as a \"vast sea of human faces,\" and, after stating that he\r\nregarded \"the Lecompton battle as having been fought and the victory\r\nwon, because the arrogant demand for the admission of Kansas under the\r\nLecompton Constitution unconditionally, whether her people wanted it or\r\nnot, has been abandoned, and the principle which recognizes the right of\r\nthe people to decide for themselves has been submitted in its place,\" he\r\nproceeded to vindicate his position throughout; declared that he opposed\r\n\"the Lecompton monstrosity solely on the ground than it was a violation\r\nof the fundamental principles of free government; on the ground that it\r\nwas not the act and deed of the people of Kansas; that it did not embody\r\ntheir will; that they were averse to it;\" and hence he \"denied the right\r\nof Congress to force it upon them, either as a Free State or a Slave\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"I deny the right of Congress to force a Slaveholding State\r\nupon an unwilling people.  I deny their right to force a Free State upon\r\nan unwilling people.  I deny their right to force a good thing upon a\r\npeople who are unwilling to receive it.  The great principle is the\r\nright of every community to judge and decide for itself, whether a thing\r\nis right or wrong, whether it would be good or evil for them to adopt\r\nit; and the right of free action, the right of free thought, the right\r\nof free judgment upon the question is dearer to every true American than\r\nany other under a free Government.  * * *  It is no answer to this\r\nargument to say that Slavery is an evil, and hence should not be\r\ntolerated.  You must allow the people to decide for themselves whether\r\nit is good or evil.\"  He then adverted to the arraignment of himself by\r\nMr. Lincoln, and took direct issue with that gentleman on his\r\nproposition that, as to Freedom and Slavery, \"the Union will become all\r\none thing or all the other;\" and maintained on the contrary, that \"it is\r\nneither desirable nor possible that there should be uniformity in the\r\nlocal institutions and domestic regulations of the different States of\r\nthis Union.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the further proposition of Mr. Lincoln, which Mr. Douglas described\r\nas \"a crusade against the Supreme Court of the United States on account\r\nof the Dred Scott decision,\" and as \"an appeal from the decision\" of\r\nthat Court \"upon this high Constitutional question to a Republican\r\ncaucus sitting in the country,\" he also took \"direct and distinct issue\r\nwith him.\"  To \"the reason assigned by Mr. Lincoln for resisting the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case * * * because it\r\ndeprives the Negro of the privileges, immunities and rights of\r\ncitizenship which pertain, according to that decision, only to the White\r\nman,\" Mr. Douglas also took exception thus: \"I am free to say to you\r\nthat in my opinion this Government of ours is founded on the White\r\nbasis.  It was made by the White man for the benefit of the White man,\r\nto be administered by White men, in such manner as they should\r\ndetermine.  It is also true that a Negro, an Indian, or any other man of\r\ninferior race to a White man, should be permitted to enjoy, and humanity\r\nrequires that he should have, all the rights, privileges, and immunities\r\nwhich he is capable of exercising consistent with the safety of society.\r\n* * *  But you may ask me what are these rights and these privileges?\r\nMy answer is, that each State must decide for itself the nature and\r\nextent of these rights. * * *  Without indorsing the wisdom of that\r\ndecision, I assert that Virginia has the same power by virtue of her\r\nsovereignty to protect Slavery within her limits, as Illinois has to\r\nbanish it forever from our own borders.  I assert the right of each\r\nState to decide for itself on all these questions, and I do not\r\nsubscribe to the doctrine of my friend, Mr. Lincoln, that uniformity is\r\neither desirable or possible.  I do not acknowledge that the States must\r\nall be Free or must all be Slave.  I do not acknowledge that the Negro\r\nmust have civil and political rights everywhere or nowhere.  * * *  I do\r\nnot acknowledge any of these doctrines of uniformity in the local and\r\ndomestic regulations in the different States.  * * *  Mr. Lincoln goes\r\nfor a warfare upon the Supreme Court of the United States because of\r\ntheir judicial decision in the Dred Scott case.  I yield obedience to\r\nthe decisions in that Court--to the final determination of the highest\r\njudicial tribunal known to our Constitution.  He objects to the Dred\r\nScott decision because it does not put the Negro in the possession of\r\nthe rights of citizenship on an equality with the White man.  I am\r\nopposed to Negro equality.  * * *  I would extend to the Negro, and the\r\nIndian, and to all dependent races every right, every privilege, and\r\nevery immunity consistent with the safety and welfare of the White\r\nraces; but equality they never should have, either political or social,\r\nor in any other respect whatever. * * *  My friends, you see that the\r\nissues are distinctly drawn.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following evening (July 10th) at Chicago, Mr. Lincoln addressed\r\nanother enthusiastic assemblage, in reply to Mr. Douglas; and, after\r\nprotesting against a charge that had been made the previous night by the\r\nlatter, of an \"unnatural and unholy\" alliance between Administration\r\nDemocrats and Republicans to defeat him, as being beyond his own\r\nknowledge and belief, proceeded: \"Popular Sovereignty!  Everlasting\r\nPopular Sovereignty!  Let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter\r\nof Popular Sovereignty.  What is Popular Sovereignty?  We recollect at\r\nan early period in the history of this struggle there was another name\r\nfor the same thing--Squatter Sovereignty.  It was not exactly Popular\r\nSovereignty, but Squatter Sovereignty.  What do those terms mean?  What\r\ndo those terms mean when used now?  And vast credit is taken by our\r\nfriend, the Judge, in regard to his support of it, when he declares the\r\nlast years of his life have been, and all the future years of his life\r\nshall be, devoted to this matter of Popular Sovereignty.  What is it?\r\nWhy it is the Sovereignty of the People!  What was Squatter Sovereignty?\r\nI suppose if it had any significance at all, it was the right of the\r\npeople to govern themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs while\r\nthey were squatted down in a country not their own--while they had\r\nsquatted on a territory that did not belong to them in the sense that a\r\nState belongs to the people who inhabit it--when it belonged to the\r\nNation--such right to govern themselves was called 'Squatter\r\nSovereignty.'\r\n\r\n\"Now I wish you to mark.  What has become of that Squatter Sovereignty?\r\nWhat has become of it?  Can you get anybody to tell you now that the\r\npeople of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard\r\nto this mooted question of Slavery, before they form a State\r\nConstitution?  No such thing at all, although there is a general running\r\nfire and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that\r\nside, assuming that that policy had given the people of a Territory the\r\nright to govern themselves upon this question; yet the point is dodged.\r\nTo-day it has been decided--no more than a year ago it was decided by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, and is insisted upon to-day,\r\nthat the people of a Territory have no right to exclude Slavery from a\r\nTerritory, that if any one man chooses to take Slaves into a Territory,\r\nall the rest of the people have no right to keep them out.  This being\r\nso, and this decision being made one of the points that the Judge\r\n(Douglas) approved, * * *  he says he is in favor of it, and sticks to\r\nit, and expects to win his battle on that decision, which says there is\r\nno such thing as Squatter Sovereignty; but that any man may take Slaves\r\ninto a Territory and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed\r\nto it, and yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it;\r\nwhen that is so, how much is left of this vast matter of Squatter\r\nSovereignty, I should like to know?  Again, when we get to the question\r\nof the right of the people to form a State Constitution as they please,\r\nto form it with Slavery or without Slavery--if that is anything new, I\r\nconfess I don't know it * * *.\r\n\r\n\"We do not remember that, in that old Declaration of Independence, it is\r\nsaid that 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\r\ncreated equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\ninalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit\r\nof happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted\r\namong men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'\r\nThere, is the origin of Popular Sovereignty.  Who, then, shall come in\r\nat this day and claim that he invented it?  The Lecompton Constitution\r\nconnects itself with this question, for it is in this matter of the\r\nLecompton Constitution that our friend, Judge Douglas, claims such vast\r\ncredit.  I agree that in opposing the Lecompton Constitution, so far as\r\nI can perceive, he was right.  * * *  All the Republicans in the Nation\r\nopposed it, and they would have opposed it just as much without Judge\r\nDouglas's aid as with it.  They had all taken ground against it long\r\nbefore he did.  Why, the reason that he urges against that Constitution,\r\nI urged against him a year before.  I have the printed speech in my hand\r\nnow.  The argument that he makes, why that Constitution should not be\r\nadopted, that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to\r\nvote, I pointed out in a speech a year ago which I hold in my hand now,\r\nthat no fair chance was to be given to the people.  * * *  The Lecompton\r\nConstitution, as the Judge tells us, was defeated.  The defeat of it was\r\na good thing or it was not.  He thinks the defeat of it was a good\r\nthing, and so do I, and we agree in that.  Who defeated it?  [A voice\r\n--'Judge Douglas.']  Yes, he furnished himself, and if you suppose he\r\ncontrolled the other Democrats that went with him, he furnished three\r\nvotes, while the Republicans furnished twenty.  That is what he did to\r\ndefeat it.  In the House of Representatives he and his friends furnished\r\nsome twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished ninety odd.  Now, who\r\nwas it that did the work?  * * *  Ground was taken against it by the\r\nRepublicans long before Douglas did it.  The proportion of opposition to\r\nthat measure is about five to one.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln then proceeded to take up the issues which Mr. Douglas had\r\njoined with him the previous evening.  He denied that he had said, or\r\nthat it could be fairly inferred from what he had said, in his\r\nSpringfield speech, that he was in favor of making War by the North upon\r\nthe South for the extinction of Slavery, \"or, in favor of inviting the\r\nSouth to a War upon the North, for the purpose of nationalizing\r\nSlavery.\"  Said he: \"I did not even say that I desired that Slavery\r\nshould be put in course of ultimate extinction.  I do say so now,\r\nhowever; so there need be no longer any difficulty about that.  * * *  I\r\nam tolerably well acquainted with the history of the Country and I know\r\nthat it has endured eighty-two years half Slave and half Free.  I\r\nbelieve--and that is what I meant to allude to there--I believe it has\r\nendured, because during all that time, until the introduction of the\r\nNebraska Bill, the public mind did rest all the, time in the belief that\r\nSlavery was in course of ultimate extinction.  That was what gave us the\r\nrest that we had through that period of eighty-two years; at least, so I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\n\"I have always hated Slavery, I think, as much as any Abolitionist--I\r\nhave been an Old Line Whig--I have always hated it, but I have always\r\nbeen quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the\r\nNebraska Bill began.  I always believed that everybody was against it,\r\nand that it was in course of ultimate extinction.  * * *  The great mass\r\nof the Nation have rested in the belief that Slavery was in course of\r\nultimate extinction.  They had reason so to believe.  The adoption of\r\nthe Constitution and its attendant history led the People to believe so,\r\nand that such was the belief of the framers of the Constitution itself.\r\nWhy did those old men about the time of the adoption of the Constitution\r\ndecree that Slavery should not go into the new territory, where it had\r\nnot already gone?  Why declare that within twenty years the African\r\nSlave Trade, by which Slaves are supplied, might be cut off by Congress?\r\nWhy were all these acts?  I might enumerate more of these acts--but\r\nenough.  What were they but a clear indication that the framers of the\r\nConstitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that\r\ninstitution?\r\n\r\n\"And now, when I say, as I said in my speech that Judge Douglas has\r\nquoted from, when I say that I think the opponents of Slavery will\r\nresist the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind\r\nshall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction,\r\nI only mean to say, that they will place it where the founders of this\r\nGovernment originally placed it.  I have said a hundred times, and I\r\nhave now no inclination to take it back, that I believe there is no\r\nright, and ought to be no inclination in the people of the Free States,\r\nto enter into the Slave States, and interfere with the question of\r\nSlavery at all.  I have said that always; Judge Douglas has heard me say\r\nit--if not quite a hundred times, at least as good as a hundred times;\r\nand when it is said that I am in favor of interfering with Slavery where\r\nit exists, I know that it is unwarranted by anything I have ever\r\nintended, and as I believe, by anything I have ever said.  If, by any\r\nmeans, I have ever used language which could fairly be so construe (as,\r\nhowever, I believe I never have) I now correct it.  So much, then, for\r\nthe inference that Judge Douglas draws, that I am in favor of setting\r\nthe Sections at War with one another.\r\n\r\n\"Now in relation to his inference that I am in favor of a general\r\nconsolidation of all the local institutions of the various States * * *\r\nI have said, very many times in Judge Douglas's hearing, that no man\r\nbelieved more than I in the principle of self-government from beginning\r\nto end.  I have denied that his use of that term applies properly.  But\r\nfor the thing itself, I deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in\r\nhis devotion to the principle, whatever he may have done in efficiency\r\nin advocating it.  I think that I have said it in your hearing--that I\r\nbelieve each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with\r\nhimself and the fruit of his labor, so far as it in no wise interferes\r\nwith any other man's rights--that each community, as a State, has a\r\nright to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that\r\nState that interfere with the rights of no other State, and that the\r\nGeneral Government, upon principle, has no right to interfere with\r\nanything other than that general class of things that does concern the\r\nwhole.  I have said that at all times.\r\n\r\n\"I have said, as illustrations, that I do not believe in the right of\r\nIllinois to interfere with the cranberry laws of Indiana, the oyster\r\nlaws of Virginia, or the liquor laws of Maine.  I have said these things\r\nover and over again, and I repeat them here as my sentiments.  * *   *\r\nWhat can authorize him to draw any such inference?  I suppose there\r\nmight be one thing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference\r\nthat would not be true with me or many others, that is, because he looks\r\nupon all this matter of Slavery as an exceedingly little thing--this\r\nmatter of keeping one-sixth of the population of the whole Nation in a\r\nstate of oppression and tyranny unequaled in the World.\r\n\r\n\"He looks upon it as being an exceedingly little thing only equal to the\r\ncranberry laws of Indiana--as something having no moral question in it\r\n--as something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture\r\nhis land with cattle, or plant it with tobacco--so little and so small a\r\nthing, that he concludes, if I could desire that anything should be done\r\nto bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing, I must be\r\nin favor of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little\r\nthings in the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Now it so happens--and there, I presume, is the foundation of this\r\nmistake--that the Judge thinks thus; and it so happens that there is a\r\nvast portion of the American People that do not look upon that matter as\r\nbeing this very little thing.  They look upon it as a vast moral evil;\r\nthey can prove it as such by the writings of those who gave us the\r\nblessings of Liberty which we enjoy, and that they so looked upon it,\r\nand not as an evil merely confining itself to the States where it is\r\nsituated; while we agree that, by the Constitution we assented to, in\r\nthe States where it exists we have no right to interfere with it,\r\nbecause it is in the Constitution; and we are by both duty and\r\ninclination to stick by that Constitution in all its letter and spirit,\r\nfrom beginning to end.  * * *  The Judge can have no issue with me on a\r\nquestion of establishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the\r\nStates.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"Another of the issues he says that is to be made with me, is upon his\r\ndevotion to the Dred Scott decision, and my opposition to it.  I have\r\nexpressed heretofore, and I now repeat, my opposition to the Dred Scott\r\ndecision; but I should be allowed to state the nature of that\r\nopposition.  * * *  What is fairly implied by the term Judge Douglas has\r\nused, 'resistance to the decision?'  I do not resist it.  If I wanted to\r\ntake Dred Scott from his master, I would be interfering with property\r\nand that terrible difficulty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of\r\ninterfering with property, would arise.  But I am doing no such thing as\r\nthat, but all that I am doing is refusing to obey it, as a political\r\nrule.  If I were in Congress, and a vote should come up on a question\r\nwhether Slavery should be prohibited in a new Territory, in spite of the\r\nDred Scott decision, I would vote that it should.  That is what I would\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Douglas said last night, that before the decision he might\r\nadvance his opinion, and it might be contrary to the decision when it\r\nwas made; but after it was made, he would abide by it until it was\r\nreversed.  Just so!  We let this property abide by the decision, but we\r\nwill try to reverse that decision.  We will try to put it where Judge\r\nDouglas would not object, for he says he will obey it until it is\r\nreversed.  Somebody has to reverse that decision, since it is made, and\r\nwe mean to reverse it, and we mean to do it peaceably.\r\n\r\n\"What are the uses of decisions of Courts?  They have two uses.  As\r\nrules of property they have two uses.  First, they decide upon the\r\nquestion before the Court.  They decide in this case that Dred Scott is\r\na Slave.  Nobody resists that.  Not only that, but they say to everybody\r\nelse, that persons standing just as Dred Scott stands, are as he is.\r\nThat is, they say that when a question comes up upon another person, it\r\nwill be so decided again, unless the Court decides in another way\r\n--unless the Court overrules its decision.--Well, we mean to do what we\r\ncan to have the Court decide the other way.  That is one thing we mean\r\nto try to do.\r\n\r\n\"The sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this decision is a\r\ndegree of sacredness that has never before been thrown around any other\r\ndecision.  I have never heard of such a thing.  Why, decisions\r\napparently contrary to that decision, or that good lawyers thought were\r\ncontrary to that decision, have been made by that very Court before.  It\r\nis the first of its kind; it is an astonisher in legal history.  It is a\r\nnew wonder of the world.  It is based upon falsehood in the main as to\r\nthe facts--allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at\r\nall in many instances; and no decision made on any question--the first\r\ninstance of a decision made under so many unfavorable circumstances\r\n--thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law, and it has\r\nalways needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled\r\nlaw.  But Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this\r\nextraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary circumstances,\r\nand give their vote in Congress in accordance with it, yield to it and\r\nobey it in every possible sense.\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances alter cases.  Do not gentlemen remember the case of that\r\nsame Supreme Court, some twenty-five or thirty years ago, deciding that\r\na National Bank was Constitutional?  * * *  The Bank charter ran out,\r\nand a recharter was granted by Congress.  That re-charter was laid\r\nbefore General Jackson.  It was urged upon him, when he denied the\r\nConstitutionality of the Bank, that the Supreme Court had decided that\r\nit was Constitutional; and General Jackson then said that the Supreme\r\nCourt had no right to lay down a rule to govern a co-ordinate branch of\r\nthe Government, the members of which had sworn to support the\r\nConstitution--that each member had sworn to support that Constitution as\r\nhe understood it.  I will venture here to say, that I have heard Judge\r\nDouglas say that he approved of General Jackson for that act.  What has\r\nnow become of all his tirade about 'resistance to the Supreme Court?'\"\r\n\r\nAfter adverting to Judge Douglas's warfare on \"the leaders\" of the\r\nRepublican party, and his desire to have \"it understood that the mass of\r\nthe Republican party are really his friends,\" Mr. Lincoln said: \"If you\r\nindorse him, you tell him you do not care whether Slavery be voted up or\r\ndown, and he will close, or try to close, your mouths with his\r\ndeclaration repeated by the day, the week, the month, and the year.  Is\r\nthat what you mean?  * * *  Now I could ask the Republican party, after\r\nall the hard names that Judge Douglas has called them by, all his\r\nrepeated charges of their inclination to marry with and hug negroes--all\r\nhis declarations of Black Republicanism--by the way, we are improving,\r\nthe black has got rubbed off--but with all that, if he be indorsed by\r\nRepublican votes, where do you stand?  Plainly, you stand ready saddled,\r\nbridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to the\r\nSlavery-extension camp of the Nation--just ready to be driven over, tied\r\ntogether in a lot--to be driven over, every man with a rope around his\r\nneck, that halter being held by Judge Douglas.  That is the question.\r\nIf Republican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think\r\nthat they has better not do it.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"We were often--more than once at least--in the course of Judge\r\nDouglas's speech last night, reminded that this Government was made for\r\nWhite men--that he believed it was made for White men.  Well, that is\r\nputting it in a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge\r\nthen goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not\r\nwarranted.  I protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic\r\nwhich presumes that because I do not want a Negro woman for a Slave I do\r\nnecessarily want her for a wife.  My understanding is that I need not\r\nhave her for either; but, as God has made us separate, we can leave one\r\nanother alone, and do one another much good thereby.  There are White\r\nmen enough to marry all the White women, and enough Black men to marry\r\nall the Black women, and in God's name let them be so married.  The\r\nJudge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the\r\nmixture of races; that the inferior race bears the superior down.  Why,\r\nJudge, if we do not let them get together in the Territories, they won't\r\nmix there.\r\n\r\n\" * * * Those arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be\r\ntreated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as\r\nmuch is to be done for them as their condition will allow--what are\r\nthese arguments?  They are the arguments that Kings have made for\r\nenslaving the People in all ages of the World.  You will find that all\r\nthe arguments in favor of king-craft were of this class; they always\r\nbestrode the necks of the People, not that they wanted to do it, but\r\nbecause the People were better off for being ridden!  That is their\r\nargument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old Serpent that\r\nsays: you work, and I eat; you toil, and I will enjoy the fruits of it.\r\n\r\n\"Turn it whatever way you will--whether it come from the mouth of a\r\nKing, an excuse for enslaving the People of his Country, or from the\r\nmouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another\r\nrace, it is all the same old Serpent; and I hold, if that course of\r\nargumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind\r\nthat we should not care about this, should be granted, it does not stop\r\nwith the Negro.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to know, taking this old Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhich declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making\r\nexceptions to it, where will it stop?  If one man says it does not mean\r\na Negro, why not say it does not mean some other man?  If that\r\nDeclaration is not the truth, let us get the Statute Book, in which we\r\nfind it, and tear it out!  Who is so bold as to do it?  If it is not\r\ntrue, let us tear it out!\"  [Cries of \"No, no.\"]  \"Let us stick to it\r\nthen; let us stand firmly by it, then.  * * *\r\n\r\n\" * * * The Saviour, I suppose, did not expect that any human creature\r\ncould be perfect as the Father in Heaven; but He said, 'As your Father\r\nin Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect.'  He set that up as a\r\nstandard, and he who did most toward reaching that standard, attained\r\nthe highest degree of moral perfection.  So I say, in relation to the\r\nprinciple that all men are created equal--let it be as nearly reached as\r\nwe can.  If we cannot give Freedom to every creature, let us do nothing\r\nthat will impose Slavery upon any other creature.  Let us then turn this\r\nGovernment back into the channel in which the framers of the\r\nConstitution originally placed it.  Let us stand firmly by each other.\r\n* * *  Let us discard all this quibbling * * *  and unite as one People\r\nthroughout this Land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that\r\nall men are created equal.\"\r\n\r\nAt Bloomington, July 16th (Mr. Lincoln being present), Judge Douglas\r\nmade another great speech of vindication and attack.  After sketching\r\nthe history of the Kansas-Nebraska struggle, from the introduction by\r\nhimself of the Nebraska Bill in the United States Senate, in 1854, down\r\nto the passage of the \"English\" Bill--which prescribed substantially\r\nthat if the people of Kansas would come in as a Slave-holding State,\r\nthey should be admitted with but 35,000 inhabitants; but if they would\r\ncome in as a Free State, they must have 93,420 inhabitants; which unfair\r\nrestriction was opposed by Judge Douglas, but to which after it became\r\nlaw he \"bowed in deference,\" because whatever decision the people of\r\nKansas might make on the coming third of August would be \"final and\r\nconclusive of the whole question\"--he proceeded to compliment the\r\nRepublicans in Congress, for supporting the Crittenden-Montgomery Bill\r\n--for coming \"to the Douglas platform, abandoning their own, believing\r\n(in the language of the New York Tribune), that under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances they would in that mode best subserve the interests of the\r\nCountry;\" and then again attacked Mr. Lincoln for his \"unholy and\r\nunnatural alliance\" with the Lecompton-Democrats to defeat him, because\r\nof which, said he: \"You will find he does not say a word against the\r\nLecompton Constitution or its supporters.  He is as silent as the grave\r\nupon that subject.  Behold Mr. Lincoln courting Lecompton votes, in\r\norder that he may go to the Senate as the representative of Republican\r\nprinciples!  You know that the alliance exists.  I think you will find\r\nthat it will ooze out before the contest is over.\"  Then with many\r\nhandsome compliments to the personal character of Mr. Lincoln, and\r\ndeclaring that the question for decision was \"whether his principles are\r\nmore in accordance with the genius of our free institutions, the peace\r\nand harmony of the Republic\" than those advocated by himself, Judge\r\nDouglas proceeded to discuss what he described as \"the two points at\r\nissue between Mr. Lincoln and myself.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"Although the Republic has existed from 1789 to this day,\r\ndivided into Free States and Slave States, yet we are told that in the\r\nfuture it cannot endure unless they shall become all Free or all Slave.\r\n* * *  He wishes to go to the Senate of the United States in order to\r\ncarry out that line of public policy which will compel all the States in\r\nthe South to become Free.  How is he going to do it?  Has Congress any\r\npower over the subject of Slavery in Kentucky or Virginia or any other\r\nState of this Union?  How, then, is Mr. Lincoln going to carry out that\r\nprinciple which he says is essential to the existence of this Union, to\r\nwit: That Slavery must be abolished in all the States of the Union or\r\nmust be established in them all?  You convince the South that they must\r\neither establish Slavery in Illinois and in every other Free State, or\r\nsubmit to its abolition in every Southern State and you invite them to\r\nmake a warfare upon the Northern States in order to establish Slavery\r\nfor the sake of perpetuating it at home.  Thus, Mr. Lincoln invites, by\r\nhis proposition, a War of Sections, a War between Illinois and Kentucky,\r\na War between the Free States and the Slave States, a War between the\r\nNorth and South, for the purpose of either exterminating Slavery in\r\nevery Southern State or planting it in every Northern State.  He tells\r\nyou that the safety of the Republic, that the existence of this Union,\r\ndepends upon that warfare being carried on until one Section or the\r\nother shall be entirely subdued.  The States must all be Free or Slave,\r\nfor a house divided against itself cannot stand.  That is Mr. Lincoln's\r\nargument upon that question.  My friends, is it possible to preserve\r\nPeace between the North and the South if such a doctrine shall prevail\r\nin either Section of the Union?\r\n\r\n\"Will you ever submit to a warfare waged by the Southern States to\r\nestablish Slavery in Illinois?  What man in Illinois would not lose the\r\nlast drop of his heart's blood before lie would submit to the\r\ninstitution of Slavery being forced upon us by the other States against\r\nour will?  And if that be true of us, what Southern man would not shed\r\nthe last drop of his heart's blood to prevent Illinois, or any other\r\nNorthern State, from interfering to abolish Slavery in his State?  Each\r\nof these States is sovereign under the Constitution; and if we wish to\r\npreserve our liberties, the reserved rights and sovereignty of each and\r\nevery State must be maintained.  * * *  The difference between Mr.\r\nLincoln and myself upon this point is, that he goes for a combination of\r\nthe Northern States, or the organization of a sectional political party\r\nin the Free States, to make War on the domestic institutions of the\r\nSouthern States, and to prosecute that War until they all shall be\r\nsubdued, and made to conform to such rules as the North shall dictate to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I am aware that Mr. Lincoln, on Saturday night last, made a speech at\r\nChicago for the purpose, as he said, of explaining his position on this\r\nquestion.  * * *  His answer to this point which I have been arguing,\r\nis, that he never did mean, and that I ought to know that he never\r\nintended to convey the idea, that he wished the people of\r\nthe Free States to enter into the Southern States and interfere with\r\nSlavery.  Well, I never did suppose that he ever dreamed of entering\r\ninto Kentucky, to make War upon her institutions, nor will any\r\nAbolitionist ever enter into Kentucky to wage such War.  Their mode of\r\nmaking War is not to enter into those States where Slavery exists, and\r\nthere interfere, and render themselves responsible for the consequences.\r\nOh, no!  They stand on this side of the Ohio River and shoot across.\r\nThey stand in Bloomington and shake their fists at the people of\r\nLexington; they threaten South Carolina from Chicago.  And they call\r\nthat bravery!  But they are very particular, as Mr. Lincoln says, not to\r\nenter into those States for the purpose of interfering with the\r\ninstitution of Slavery there.  I am not only opposed to entering into\r\nthe Slave States, for the purpose of interfering with their\r\ninstitutions, but I am opposed to a sectional agitation to control the\r\ninstitutions of other States.  I am opposed to organizing a sectional\r\nparty, which appeals to Northern pride, and Northern passion and\r\nprejudice, against Southern institutions, thus stirring up ill feeling\r\nand hot blood between brethren of the same Republic.  I am opposed to\r\nthat whole system of sectional agitation, which can produce nothing but\r\nstrife, but discord, but hostility, and finally disunion.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I ask Mr. Lincoln how it is that he purposes ultimately to bring about\r\nthis uniformity in each and all the States of the Union?  There is but\r\none possible mode which I can see, and perhaps Mr. Lincoln intends to\r\npursue it; that is, to introduce a proposition into the Senate to change\r\nthe Constitution of the United States in order that all the State\r\nLegislatures may be abolished, State Sovereignty blotted out, and the\r\npower conferred upon Congress to make local laws and establish the\r\ndomestic institutions and police regulations uniformly throughout the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"Are you prepared for such a change in the institutions of your country?\r\nWhenever you shall have blotted out the State Sovereignties, abolished\r\nthe State Legislatures, and consolidated all the power in the Federal\r\nGovernment, you will have established a Consolidated Empire as\r\ndestructive to the Liberties of the People and the Rights of the Citizen\r\nas that of Austria, or Russia, or any other despotism that rests upon\r\nthe neck of the People.  * * *  There is but one possible way in which\r\nSlavery can be abolished, and that is by leaving a State, according to\r\nthe principle of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate its institutions in its own way.  That was the principle upon\r\nwhich this Republic was founded, and it is under the operation of that\r\nprinciple that we have been able to preserve the Union thus far under\r\nits operation.  Slavery disappeared from New Hampshire, from Rhode\r\nIsland, from Connecticut, from New York, from New Jersey, from\r\nPennsylvania, from six of the twelve original Slave-holding States; and\r\nthis gradual system of emancipation went on quietly, peacefully, and\r\nsteadily, so long as we in the Free States minded our own business, and\r\nleft our neighbors alone.\r\n\r\n\"But the moment the Abolition Societies were organized throughout the\r\nNorth, preaching a violent crusade against Slavery in the Southern\r\nStates, this combination necessarily caused a counter-combination in the\r\nSouth, and a sectional line was drawn which was a barrier to any further\r\nemancipation.  Bear in mind that emancipation has not taken place in any\r\none State since the Free Soil Party was organized as a political party\r\nin this country.  Emancipation went on gradually, in State after State,\r\nso long as the Free States were content with managing their own affairs\r\nand leaving the South perfectly free to do as they pleased; but the\r\nmoment the North said we are powerful enough to control you of the\r\nSouth, the moment the North proclaimed itself the determined master of\r\nthe South, that moment the South combined to resist the attack, and thus\r\nsectional parties were formed and gradual emancipation ceased in all the\r\nSlave-holding States.\r\n\r\n\"And yet Mr. Lincoln, in view of these historical facts, proposes to\r\nkeep up this sectional agitation, band all the Northern States together\r\nin one political Party, elect a President by Northern votes alone, and\r\nthen, of course, make a Cabinet composed of Northern men, and administer\r\nthe Government by Northern men only, denying all the Southern States of\r\nthis Union any participation in the administration of affairs\r\nwhatsoever.  I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, whether such a line of\r\npolicy is consistent with the peace and harmony of the Country?  Can the\r\nUnion endure under such a system of policy?  He has taken his position\r\nin favor of sectional agitation and sectional warfare.  I have taken\r\nmine in favor of securing peace, harmony, and good-will among all the\r\nStates, by permitting each to mind its own business, and\r\ndiscountenancing any attempt at interference on the part of one State\r\nwith the domestic concerns of the others.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln tells you that he is opposed to the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt in the Dred Scott case.  Well, suppose he is; what is he going to\r\ndo about it?  * * * Why, he says he is going to appeal to Congress.  Let\r\nus see how he will appeal to Congress.  He tells us that on the 8th of\r\nMarch, 1820, Congress passed a law called the Missouri Compromise,\r\nprohibiting Slavery forever in all the territory west of the Mississippi\r\nand north of the Missouri line of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes;\r\nthat Dred Scott, a slave in Missouri, was taken by his master to Fort\r\nSnelling, in the present State of Minnesota, situated on the west branch\r\nof the Mississippi River, and consequently in the Territory where\r\nSlavery was prohibited by the Act of 1820; and that when Dred Scott\r\nappealed for his Freedom in consequence of having been taken into that\r\nTerritory, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that Dred\r\nScott did not become Free by being taken into that Territory, but that\r\nhaving been carried back to Missouri, was yet a Slave.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln is going to appeal from that decision and reverse it.  He\r\ndoes not intend to reverse it as to Dred Scott.  Oh, no!  But he will\r\nreverse it so that it shall not stand as a rule in the future.  How will\r\nhe do it?  He says that if he is elected to the Senate he will introduce\r\nand pass a law just like the Missouri Compromise, prohibiting Slavery\r\nagain in all the Territories.  Suppose he does re-enact the same law\r\nwhich the Court has pronounced unconstitutional, will that make it\r\nConstitutional?  * * *  Will it be any more valid?  Will he be able to\r\nconvince the Court that the second Act is valid, when the first is\r\ninvalid and void?  What good does it do to pass a second Act?  Why, it\r\nwill have the effect to arraign the Supreme Court before the People, and\r\nto bring them into all the political discussions of the Country.  Will\r\nthat do any good?  * * *\r\n\r\n\"The functions of Congress are to enact the Statutes, the province of\r\nthe Court is to pronounce upon their validity, and the duty of the\r\nExecutive is to carry the decision into effect when rendered by the\r\nCourt.  And yet, notwithstanding the Constitution makes the decision of\r\nthe Court final in regard to the validity of an Act of Congress, Mr.\r\nLincoln is going to reverse that decision by passing another Act of\r\nCongress.  When he has become convinced of the Folly of the proposition,\r\nperhaps he will resort to the same subterfuge that I have found others\r\nof his Party resort to, which is to agitate and agitate until he can\r\nchange the Supreme Court and put other men in the places of the present\r\nincumbents.\"\r\n\r\nAfter ridiculing this proposition at some length, he proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln is alarmed for fear that, under the Dred Scott decision,\r\nSlavery will go into all the Territories of the United States.  All I\r\nhave to say is that, with or without this decision, Slavery will go just\r\nwhere the People want it, and not an inch further.  * * *  Hence, if the\r\nPeople of a Territory want Slavery, they will encourage it by passing\r\naffirmatory laws, and the necessary police regulations, patrol laws and\r\nSlave Code; if they do not want it, they will withhold that legislation,\r\nand, by withholding it, Slavery is as dead as if it was prohibited by a\r\nConstitutional prohibition, especially if, in addition, their\r\nlegislation is unfriendly, as it would be if they were opposed to it.\"\r\n\r\nThen, taking up what he said was \"Mr. Lincoln's main objection to the\r\nDred Scott decision,\" to wit: \"that that decision deprives the Negro of\r\nthe benefits of that clause of the Constitution of the United States\r\nwhich entitles the citizens of each State to all the privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens of the several States,\" and admitting that such\r\nwould be its effect, Mr. Douglas contended at some length that this\r\nGovernment was \"founded on the White basis\" for the benefit of the\r\nWhites and their posterity.  He did \"not believe that it was the design\r\nor intention of the signers of the Declaration of Independence or the\r\nframes of the Constitution to include Negroes, Indians, or other\r\ninferior races, with White men as citizens;\" nor that the former \"had\r\nany reference to Negroes, when they used the expression that all men\r\nwere created equal,\" nor to \"any other inferior race.\"  He held that,\r\n\"They were speaking only of the White race, and never dreamed that their\r\nlanguage would be construed to apply to the Negro;\" and after ridiculing\r\nthe contrary view, insisted that, \"The history of the Country shows that\r\nneither the signers of the Declaration, nor the Framers of the\r\nConstitution, ever supposed it possible that their language would be\r\nused in an attempt to make this Nation a mixed Nation of Indians,\r\nNegroes, Whites, and Mongrels.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Fathers proceeded on the White basis, making the White people the\r\ngoverning race, but conceding to the Indian and Negro, and all inferior\r\nraces, all the rights and all the privileges they could enjoy consistent\r\nwith the safety of the society in which they lived.  That,\" said he, \"is\r\nmy opinion now.  I told you that humanity, philanthropy, justice, and\r\nsound policy required that we should give the Negro every right, every\r\nprivilege, every immunity consistent with the safety and welfare of the\r\nState.  The question, then, naturally arises, what are those rights and\r\nprivileges, and what is the nature and extent of them?  My answer is,\r\nthat that is a question which each State and each Territory must decide\r\nfor itself.  * * *  I am content with that position.  My friend Lincoln\r\nis not.  * * *  He thinks that the Almighty made the Negro his equal and\r\nhis brother.  For my part I do not consider the Negro any kin to me, nor\r\nto any other White man; but I would still carry my humanity and my\r\nphilanthropy to the extent of giving him every privilege and every\r\nimmunity that he could enjoy, consistent with our own good.\"\r\n\r\nAfter again referring to the principles connected with non-interference\r\nin the domestic institutions of the States and Territories, and to the\r\ndevotion of all his energies to them \"since 1850, when,\" said he, \"I\r\nacted side by side with the immortal Clay and the god-like Webster, in\r\nthat memorable struggle in which Whigs and Democrats united upon a\r\ncommon platform of patriotism and the Constitution, throwing aside\r\npartisan feelings in order to restore peace and harmony to a distracted\r\nCountry\"--he alluded to the death-bed of Clay, and the pledges made by\r\nhimself to both Clay and Webster to devote his own life to the\r\nvindication of the principles of that Compromise of 1850 as a means of\r\npreserving the Union; and concluded with this appeal: \"This Union can\r\nonly be preserved by maintaining the fraternal feeling between the North\r\nand the South, the East and the West.  If that good feeling can be\r\npreserved, the Union will be as perpetual as the fame of its great\r\nfounders.  It can be maintained by preserving the sovereignty of the\r\nStates, the right of each State and each Territory to settle its\r\ndomestic concerns for itself, and the duty of each to refrain from\r\ninterfering with the other in any of its local or domestic institutions.\r\nLet that be done, and the Union will be perpetual; let that be done, and\r\nthis Republic, which began with thirteen States and which now numbers\r\nthirty-two, which when it began, only extended from the Atlantic to the\r\nMississippi, but now reaches to the Pacific, may yet expand, North and\r\nSouth, until it covers the whole Continent, and becomes one vast\r\nocean-bound Confederacy.  Then, my friends, the path of duty, of honor,\r\nof patriotism, is plain.  There are a few simple principles to be\r\npreserved.  Bear in mind the dividing line between State rights and\r\nFederal authority; let us maintain the great principles of Popular\r\nSovereignty, of State rights and of the Federal Union as the\r\nConstitution has made it, and this Republic will endure forever.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next evening, July 17th, at Springfield, both Douglas and Lincoln\r\naddressed separate meetings.\r\n\r\nAfter covering much the same ground with regard to the history of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska struggle and his own attitude upon it, as he did in his\r\nprevious speech, Mr. Douglas declined to comment upon Mr. Lincoln's\r\nintimation of a Conspiracy between Douglas, Pierce, Buchanan, and Taney\r\nfor the passage of the Nebraska Bill, the rendition of the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, and the extension of Slavery, but proceeded to dilate on the\r\n\"uniformity\" issue between himself and Mr. Lincoln, in much the same\r\nstrain as before, tersely summing up with the statement that \"there is a\r\ndistinct issue of principles--principles irreconcilable--between Mr.\r\nLincoln and myself.  He goes for consolidation and uniformity in our\r\nGovernment.  I go for maintaining the Confederation of the Sovereign\r\nStates under the Constitution, as our fathers made it, leaving each\r\nState at liberty to manage its own affairs and own internal\r\ninstitutions.\"\r\n\r\nHe then ridiculed, at considerable length, Mr. Lincoln's proposed\r\nmethods of securing a reversal by the United States Supreme Court of the\r\nDred Scott decision--especially that of an \"appeal to the People to\r\nelect a President who will appoint judges who will reverse the Dred\r\nScott decision,\" which he characterized as \"a proposition to make that\r\nCourt the corrupt, unscrupulous tool of a political party,\" and asked,\r\n\"when we refuse to abide by Judicial decisions, what protection is there\r\nleft for life and property?  To whom shall you appeal?  To mob law, to\r\npartisan caucuses, to town meetings, to revolution?  Where is the remedy\r\nwhen you refuse obedience to the constituted authorities?\"  In other\r\nrespects the speech was largely a repetition of his Bloomington speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln in his speech, the same night, at Springfield, opened by\r\ncontrasting the disadvantages under which, by reason of an unfair\r\napportionment of State Legislative representation and otherwise, the\r\nRepublicans of Illinois labored in this fight.  Among other\r\ndisadvantages--whereby he said the Republicans were forced \"to fight\r\nthis battle upon principle and upon principle alone\"--were those which\r\nhe said arose \"out of the relative positions of the two persons who\r\nstand before the State as candidates for the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"Senator Douglas is of world-wide renown.  All the anxious\r\npoliticians of his Party, or who have been of his Party for years past,\r\nhave been looking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the\r\nPresident of the United States.  They have seen in his round, jolly,\r\nfruitful face, Post-offices, Land-offices, Marshalships, and Cabinet\r\nappointments, Chargeships and Foreign Missions, bursting and sprouting\r\nout in wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy\r\nhands.  And as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture so\r\nlong, they cannot, in the little distraction that has taken place in the\r\nparty, bring themselves to give up the charming hope; but with greedier\r\nanxiety they rush about him, sustain him, and give him marches,\r\ntriumphal entries, and receptions, beyond what even in the days of his\r\nhighest prosperity they could have brought about in his favor.  On the\r\ncontrary, nobody has ever expected me to be President.  In my poor,\r\nlean, lank face, nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThen he described the main points of Senator Douglas's plan of campaign\r\nas being not very numerous.  \"The first,\" he said, \"is Popular\r\nSovereignty.  The second and third are attacks upon my speech made on\r\nthe 16th of June.  Out of these three points-drawing within the range of\r\nPopular Sovereignty the question of the Lecompton Constitution--he makes\r\nhis principal assault.  Upon these his successive speeches are\r\nsubstantially one and the same.\"  Touching the first point, \"Popular\r\nSovereignty\"--\"the great staple\" of Mr. Douglas's campaign--Mr. Lincoln\r\naffirmed that it was \"the most arrant Quixotism that was ever enacted\r\nbefore a community.\"\r\n\r\nHe said that everybody understood that \"we have not been in a\r\ncontroversy about the right of a People to govern themselves in the\r\nordinary matters of domestic concern in the States and Territories;\"\r\nthat, \"in this controversy, whatever has been said has had reference to\r\nthe question of Negro Slavery;\" and \"hence,\" said he, \"when hereafter I\r\nspeak of Popular Sovereignty, I wish to be understood as applying what I\r\nsay to the question of Slavery only; not to other minor domestic matters\r\nof a Territory or a State.\"\r\n\r\nHaving cleared away the cobwebs, Mr. Lincoln proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Does Judge Douglas, when he says that several of the past years of his\r\nlife have been devoted to the question of 'Popular Sovereignty' * * *\r\nmean to say that he has been devoting his life to securing the People of\r\nthe Territories the right to exclude Slavery from the Territories?  If\r\nhe means so to say, he means to deceive; because he and every one knows\r\nthat the decision of the Supreme Court, which he approves, and makes\r\nspecial ground of attack upon me for disapproving, forbids the People of\r\na Territory to exclude Slavery.\r\n\r\n\"This covers the whole ground from the settlement of a Territory till it\r\nreaches the degree of maturity entitling it to form a State\r\nConstitution.  * * *  This being so, the period of time from the first\r\nsettlement of a Territory till it reaches the point of forming a State\r\nConstitution, is not the thing that the Judge has fought for, or is\r\nfighting for; but, on the contrary, he has fought for, and is fighting\r\nfor, the thing that annihilates and crushes out that same Popular\r\nSovereignty.  Well, so much being disposed of, what is left?  Why, he is\r\ncontending for the right of the People, when they come to make a State\r\nConstitution, to make it for themselves, and precisely as best suits\r\nthemselves.  I say again, that is Quixotic.  I defy contradiction when I\r\ndeclare that the Judge can find no one to oppose him on that\r\nproposition.  I repeat, there is nobody opposing that proposition on\r\nprinciple.  * * *  Nobody is opposing, or has opposed, the right of the\r\nPeople when they form a State Constitution, to form it for themselves.\r\nMr. Buchanan and his friends have not done it; they, too, as well as the\r\nRepublicans and the Anti-Lecompton Democrats, have not done it; but on\r\nthe contrary, they together have insisted on the right of the People to\r\nform a Constitution for themselves.  The difference between the Buchanan\r\nmen, on the one hand, and the Douglas men and the Republicans, on the\r\nother, has not been on a question of principle, but on a question of\r\nfact * * * whether the Lecompton Constitution had been fairly formed by\r\nthe People or not.  * * *  As to the principle, all were agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Douglas voted with the Republicans upon that matter of fact.  He\r\nand they, by their voices and votes, denied that it was a fair emanation\r\nof the People.  The Administration affirmed that it was.  * * *  This\r\nbeing so, what is Judge Douglas going to spend his life for?  Is he\r\ngoing to spend his life in maintaining a principle that no body on earth\r\nopposes?  Does he expect to stand up in majestic dignity and go through\r\nhis apotheosis and become a god, in the maintaining of a principle which\r\nneither man nor mouse in all God's creation is opposing?\"\r\n\r\nAfter ridiculing the assumption that Judge Douglas was entitled to all\r\nthe credit for the defeat of the Lecompton Constitution in the House of\r\nRepresentatives--when the defeating vote numbered 120, of which 6 were\r\nAmericans, 20 Douglas (or Anti-Lecompton) Democrats, and 94 Republicans\r\n--and hinting that perhaps he placed \"his superior claim to credit, on\r\nthe ground that he performed a good act which was never expected of\r\nhim,\" or \"upon the ground of the parable of the lost sheep,\" of which it\r\nhad been said, \"that there was more rejoicing over the one sheep that\r\nwas lost and had been found, than over the ninety and nine in the fold\r\n--\" he added: \"The application is made by the Saviour in this parable,\r\nthus: 'Verily, I say unto you, there is more rejoicing in Heaven over\r\none sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons that\r\nneed no repentance.'  And now if the Judge claims the benefit of this\r\nparable, let him repent.  Let him not come up here and say: 'I am the\r\nonly just person; and you are the ninety-nine sinners!'  Repentance\r\nbefore forgiveness is a provision of the Christian system, and on that\r\ncondition alone will the Republicans grant his forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nAfter complaining that Judge Douglas misrepresented his attitude as\r\nindicated in his 16th of June speech at Springfield, in charging that he\r\ninvited \"a War of Sections;\"--that he proposed that \"all the local\r\ninstitutions of the different States shall become consolidated and\r\nuniform,\" Mr. Lincoln denied that that speech could fairly bear such\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn that speech he (Mr. L.) had simply expressed an expectation that\r\n\"either the opponents of Slavery will arrest the further spread of it,\r\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is\r\nin the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it\r\nforward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well\r\nas new, North as well as South.\"  Since then, at Chicago, he had also\r\nexpressed a \"wish to see the spread of Slavery arrested, and to see it\r\nplaced where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction\"--and, said he: \"I said that, because I\r\nsupposed, when the public mind shall rest in that belief, we shall have\r\nPeace on the Slavery question.  I have believed--and now believe--the\r\npublic mind did rest on that belief up to the introduction of the\r\nNebraska Bill.  Although I have ever been opposed to Slavery, so far I\r\nrested in the hope and belief that it was in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction.  For that reason, it had been a minor question with me.  I\r\nmight have been mistaken; but I had believed, and now believe, that the\r\nwhole public mind, that is, the mind of the great majority, had rested\r\nin that belief up to the Repeal of the Missouri Compromise.  But upon\r\nthat event, I became convinced that either I had been resting in a\r\ndelusion, or the institution was being placed on a new basis--a basis\r\nfor making it Perpetual, National, and Universal.  Subsequent events\r\nhave greatly confirmed me in that belief.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that Bill to be the beginning of a Conspiracy for that\r\npurpose.  So believing, I have since then considered that question a\r\nparamount one.  So believing, I thought the public mind would never rest\r\ntill the power of Congress to restrict the spread of it shall again be\r\nacknowledged and exercised on the one hand, or, on the other, all\r\nresistance be entirely crushed out.  I have expressed that opinion and I\r\nentertain it to-night.\"\r\n\r\nHaving given some pieces of evidence in proof of the  \"tendency,\" he had\r\ndiscovered, to the Nationalization of Slavery in these States, Mr.\r\nLincoln continued: \"And now, as to the Judge's inference, that because I\r\nwish to see Slavery placed in the course of ultimate extinction--placed\r\nwhere our fathers originally placed it--I wish to annihilate the State\r\nLegislatures--to force cotton to grow upon the tops of the Green\r\nMountains--to freeze ice in Florida--to cut lumber on the broad Illinois\r\nprairies--that I am in favor of all these ridiculous and impossible\r\nthings!  It seems to me it is a complete answer to all this, to ask if,\r\nwhen Congress did have the fashion of restricting Slavery from Free\r\nTerritory; when Courts did have the fashion of deciding that taking a\r\nSlave into a Free, Country made him Free--I say it is a sufficient\r\nanswer to ask, if any of this ridiculous nonsense, about consolidation\r\nand uniformity, did actually follow?  Who heard of any such thing,\r\nbecause of the Ordinance of '87? because of the Missouri Restriction\r\nbecause of the numerous Court decisions of that character?\r\n\r\n\"Now, as to the Dred Scott decision; for upon that he makes his last\r\npoint at me.  He boldly takes ground in favor of that decision.  This is\r\none-half the onslaught and one-third of the entire plan of the campaign.\r\nI am opposed to that decision in a certain sense, but not in the sense\r\nwhich he puts on it.  I say that in so far as it decided in favor of\r\nDred Scott's master, and against Dred Scott and his family, I do not\r\npropose to disturb or resist the decision.  I never have proposed to do\r\nany such thing.  I think, that in respect for judicial authority, my\r\nhumble history would not suffer in comparison with that of Judge\r\nDouglas.  He would have the citizen conform his vote to that decision;\r\nthe member of Congress, his; the President, his use of the veto power.\r\nHe would make it a rule of political action for the People and all the\r\ndepartments of the Government.  I would not.  By resisting it as a\r\npolitical rule, I disturb no right of property, create no disorder,\r\nexcite no mobs.\"\r\n\r\nAfter quoting from a letter of Mr. Jefferson (vol. vii., p. 177, of his\r\nCorrespondence,) in which he held that \"to consider the judges as the\r\nultimate arbiters of all Constitutional questions,\" is \"a very dangerous\r\ndoctrine indeed; and one which would place us under the despotism of an\r\nOligarchy,\" Mr. Lincoln continued: \"Let us go a little further.  You\r\nremember we once had a National Bank.  Some one owed the Bank a debt; he\r\nwas sued, and sought to avoid payment on the ground that the Bank was\r\nunconstitutional.  The case went to the Supreme Court, and therein it\r\nwas decided that the Bank was Constitutional.  The whole Democratic\r\nparty revolted against that decision.  General Jackson himself asserted\r\nthat he, as President, would not be bound to hold a National Bank to be\r\nConstitutional, even though the Court had decided it to be so.  He fell\r\nin, precisely, with the view of Mr. Jefferson, and acted upon it under\r\nhis official oath, in vetoing a charter for a National Bank.\r\n\r\n\"The declaration that Congress does not possess this Constitutional\r\npower to charter a Bank, has gone into the Democratic platform, at their\r\nNational Conventions, and was brought forward and reaffirmed in their\r\nlast Convention at Cincinnati.  They have contended for that\r\ndeclaration, in the very teeth of the Supreme Court, for more than a\r\nquarter of a century.  In fact, they have reduced the decision to an\r\nabsolute nullity.  That decision, I repeat, is repudiated in the\r\nCincinnati platform; and still, as if to show that effrontery can go no\r\nfurther, Judge Douglas vaunts in the very speeches in which he denounces\r\nme for opposing the Dred Scott decision, that he stands on the\r\nCincinnati platform.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I wish to know what the Judge can charge upon me, with respect to\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, which does not lie in all its length,\r\nbreadth, and proportions, at his own door?  The plain truth is simply\r\nthis: Judge Douglas is for Supreme Court decisions when he likes, and\r\nagainst them when he does not like them.  He is for the Dred Scott\r\ndecision because it tends to Nationalize Slavery--because it is a part\r\nof the original combination for that object.  It so happens, singularly\r\nenough, that I never stood opposed to a decision of the Supreme Court\r\ntill this.  On the contrary, I have no recollection that he was ever\r\nparticularly in favor of one till this.  He never was in favor of any,\r\nnor (I) opposed to any, till the present one, which helps to Nationalize\r\nSlavery.  Free men of Sangamon--Free men of Illinois, Free men\r\neverywhere--judge ye between him and me, upon this issue!\r\n\r\n\"He says this Dred Scott case is a very small matter at\r\nmost--that it has no practical effect; that at best, or rather I suppose\r\nat worst, it is but an abstraction.  * * *  How has the planting of\r\nSlavery in new countries always been effected?  It has now been decided\r\nthat Slavery cannot be kept out of our new Territories by any legal\r\nmeans.  In what do our new Territories now differ in this respect from\r\nthe old Colonies when Slavery was first planted within them?\r\n\r\n\"It was planted, as Mr. Clay once declared, and as history proves true,\r\nby individual men in spite of the wishes of the people; the\r\nMother-Government refusing to prohibit it, and withholding from the\r\nPeople of the Colonies the authority to prohibit it for themselves.  Mr.\r\nClay says this was one of the great and just causes of complaint against\r\nGreat Britain by the Colonies, and the best apology we can now make for\r\nhaving the institution amongst us.  In that precise condition our\r\nNebraska politicians have at last succeeded in placing our own new\r\nTerritories; the Government will not prohibit Slavery within them, nor\r\nallow the People to prohibit it.\"\r\n\r\nAlluding to that part of Mr. Douglas's speech the previous night\r\ntouching the death-bed scene of Mr. Clay, with Mr. Douglas's promise to\r\ndevote the remainder of his life to \"Popular Sovereignty\"--and to his\r\nrelations with Mr. Webster--Mr. Lincoln said: \"It would be amusing, if\r\nit were not disgusting, to see how quick these Compromise breakers\r\nadminister on the political effects of their dead adversaries.  If I\r\nshould be found dead to-morrow morning, nothing but my insignificance\r\ncould prevent a speech being made on my authority, before the end of\r\nnext week.  It so happens that in that 'Popular Sovereignty' with which\r\nMr. Clay was identified, the Missouri Compromise was expressly reserved;\r\nand it was a little singular if Mr. Clay cast his mantle upon Judge\r\nDouglas on purpose to have that Compromise repealed.  Again, the Judge\r\ndid not keep faith with Mr. Clay when he first brought in the Nebraska\r\nBill.  He left the Missouri Compromise unrepealed, and in his report\r\naccompanying the Bill, he told the World he did it on purpose.  The\r\nmanes of Mr. Clay must have been in great agony, till thirty days later,\r\nwhen 'Popular Sovereignty' stood forth in all its glory.\"\r\n\r\nTouching Mr. Douglas's allegations of Mr. Lincoln's disposition to make\r\nNegroes equal with the Whites, socially and politically, the latter\r\nsaid: \"My declarations upon this subject of Negro Slavery may be\r\nmisrepresented, but cannot be misunderstood.  I have said that I do not\r\nunderstand the Declaration (of Independence) to mean that all men were\r\ncreated equal in all respects.  They are not equal in color; but I\r\nsuppose that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some\r\nrespects; they are equal in their right to 'Life, Liberty, and the\r\npursuit of Happiness.'  Certainly the Negro is not our equal in color\r\n--perhaps not in many other respects; still, in the right to put into his\r\nmouth the bread that his own hands have earned, he is the equal of every\r\nother man, White or Black.  In pointing out that more has been given\r\nyou, you cannot be justified in taking away the little which has been\r\ngiven him.  All I ask for the Negro is that if you do not like him, let\r\nhim alone.  If God gave him but little, that little let him enjoy.\r\n\r\n\"The framers of the Constitution,\" continued Mr. Lincoln, \"found the\r\ninstitution of Slavery amongst their other institutions at the time.\r\nThey found that by an effort to eradicate it, they might lose much of\r\nwhat they had already gained.  They were obliged to bow to the\r\nnecessity.  They gave Congress power to abolish the Slave Trade at the\r\nend of twenty years.  They also prohibited it in the Territories where\r\nit did not exist.  They did what they could, and yielded to the\r\nnecessity for the rest.  I also yield to all which follows from that\r\nnecessity.  What I would most desire would be the separation of the\r\nWhite and Black races.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln closed his speech by referring to the \"New Departure\" of\r\nthe Democracy--to the charge he had made, in his 16th of June speech,\r\ntouching \"the existence of a Conspiracy to Perpetuate and Nationalize\r\nSlavery\"--which Mr. Douglas had not contradicted--and, said he, \"on his\r\nown tacit admission I renew that charge.  I charge him with having been\r\na party to that Conspiracy, and to that deception, for the sole purpose\r\nof Nationalizing Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThis closed the series of preliminary speeches in the canvass.  But they\r\nonly served to whet the moral and intellectual and political appetite of\r\nthe public for more.  It was generally conceded that, at last, in the\r\nperson of Mr. Lincoln, the \"Little Giant\" had met his match.\r\n\r\nOn July 24, Mr. Lincoln opened a correspondence with Mr. Douglas,\r\nwhich eventuated in an agreement between them, July 31st, for\r\njoint-discussions, to take place at Ottawa, Freeport, Jonesboro,\r\nCharleston, Galesburgh, Quincy, and Alton, on fixed dates in August,\r\nSeptember and October--at Ottawa, Mr. Douglas to open and speak one\r\nhour, Mr. Lincoln to have an hour and a half in reply, and Mr. Douglas\r\nto close in a half hour's speech; at Freeport, Mr. Lincoln to open and\r\nspeak for one hour, Mr. Douglas to take the next hour and a half in\r\nreply, and Mr. Lincoln to have the next half hour to close; and so on,\r\nalternating at each successive place, making twenty-one hours of joint\r\npolitical debate.\r\n\r\nTo these absorbingly interesting discussions, vast assemblages listened\r\nwith breathless attention; and to the credit of all parties be it said,\r\nwith unparalleled decorum.  The People evidently felt that the greatest\r\nof all political principles--that of Human Liberty--was hanging on the\r\nissue of this great political contest between intellectual giants, thus\r\nopenly waged before the World--and they accordingly rose to the dignity\r\nand solemnity of the occasion, vindicating by their very example the\r\nsacredness with which the Right of Free Speech should be regarded at all\r\ntimes and everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                   THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST OF 1860\r\n                        THE CRISIS APPROACHING.\r\n\r\nThe immediate outcome of the remarkable joint-debate between the two\r\nintellectual giants of Illinois was, that while the popular vote stood\r\n124,698 for Lincoln, to 121,130 for Douglas--showing a victory for\r\nLincoln among the People--yet, enough Douglas-Democrats were elected to\r\nthe Legislature, when added to those of his friends in the Illinois\r\nSenate, who had been elected two years before, and \"held over,\" to give\r\nhim, in all, 54 members of both branches of the Legislature on joint\r\nballot, against 46 for Mr. Lincoln.  Lincoln had carried the people, but\r\nDouglas had secured the Senatorial prize for which they had striven--and\r\nby that Legislative vote was elected to succeed himself in the United\r\nStates Senate.  This result was trumpeted throughout the Union as a\r\ngreat Douglas victory.\r\n\r\nDuring the canvass of Illinois, Douglas's friends had seen to it that\r\nnothing on their part should be wanting to secure success.  What with\r\nspecial car trains, and weighty deputations, and imposing processions,\r\nand flag raisings, the inspiration of music, the booming of cannon, and\r\nthe eager shouts of an enthusiastic populace, his political journey\r\nthrough Illinois had been more like a Royal Progress than anything the\r\nCountry had yet seen; and now that his reelection was accomplished, they\r\nproposed to make the most of it--to extend, as it were, the sphere of\r\nhis triumph, or vindication, so that it would include not the State\r\nalone, but the Nation--and thus so accentuate and enhance his\r\navailability as a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination\r\nof 1860, as to make his nomination and election to the Presidency of the\r\nUnited States an almost foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe programme was to raise so great a popular tidal-wave in his\r\ninterest, as would bear him irresistibly upon its crest to the White\r\nHouse.  Accordingly, as the idol of the Democratic popular heart,\r\nDouglas, upon his return to the National Capital, was triumphantly\r\nreceived by the chief cities of the Mississippi and the Atlantic\r\nsea-board.  Hailed as victor in the great political contest in Illinois\r\n--upon the extended newspaper reports of which, the absorbed eyes of the\r\nentire nation, for months, had greedily fed--Douglas was received with\r\nmuch ostentation and immense enthusiasm at St. Louis, Memphis, New\r\nOrleans, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington.  Like the\r\n\"Triumphs\" decreed by Rome, in her grandest days, to the greatest of her\r\nvictorious heroes, Douglas's return was a series of magnificent popular\r\novations.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made two years before this period, Mr. Lincoln, while\r\ncontrasting his own political career with that of Douglas, and modestly\r\ndescribing his own as \"a flat failure\" had said: \"With him it has been\r\none of splendid success.  His name fills the Nation, and is not unknown\r\neven in foreign lands.  I affect no contempt for the high eminence he\r\nhas reached.  So reached, that the oppressed of my species might have\r\nshared with me in the elevation, I would rather stand on that eminence\r\nthan wear the richest crown that ever pressed a monarch's brow.\"  And\r\nnow the star of Douglas had reached a higher altitude, nearing its\r\nmeridian splendor.  He had become the popular idol of the day.\r\n\r\nBut Douglas's partial victory--if such it was--so far from settling the\r\npublic mind and public conscience, had the contrary effect.  It added to\r\nthe ferment which the Pro-Slavery Oligarchists of the South--and\r\nespecially those of South Carolina--were intent upon increasing, until\r\nso grave and serious a crisis should arrive as would, in their opinion,\r\nfurnish a justifiable pretext in the eyes of the World for the\r\ncontemplated Secession of the Slave States from the Union.\r\n\r\nUnder the inspiration of the Slave Power, and in the direct line of the\r\nDred Scott decision, and of the \"victorious\" doctrine of Senator\r\nDouglas, which he held not inconsistent therewith, that the people of\r\nany Territory of the United States could do as they pleased as to the\r\ninstitution of Slavery within their own limits, and if they desired the\r\ninstitution, they had the right by local legislation to \"protect and\r\nencourage it,\" the Legislature of the Territory of New Mexico at once\r\n(1859) proceeded to enact a law \"for the protection of property in\r\nSlaves,\" and other measures similar to the prevailing Slave Codes in the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\nThe aggressive attitude of the South--as thus evidenced anew--naturally\r\nstirred, to their very core, the Abolition elements of the North; on the\r\nother hand, the publication of Hinton Rowan Helper's \"Impending Crisis,\"\r\nwhich handled the Slavery question without gloves, and supported its\r\nviews with statistics which startled the Northern mind, together with\r\nits alleged indorsement by the leading Republicans of the North,\r\nexasperated the fiery Southrons to an intense degree.  Nor was the\r\ncapture, in October, 1859, of Harper's Ferry, Virginia, by John Brown\r\nand his handful of Northern Abolitionist followers, and his subsequent\r\nexecution in Virginia, calculated to allay the rapidly intensifying\r\nfeeling between the Freedom-loving North and the Slaveholding South.\r\nWhen, therefore, the Congress met, in December, 1859, the sectional\r\nwrath of the Country was reflected in the proceedings of both branches\r\nof that body, and these again reacted upon the People of both the\r\nNorthern and Southern States, until the fires of Slavery Agitation were\r\nstirred to a white heat.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of feeling in the House at this time, was shown, in part,\r\nby the fact that not until the 1st of February, 1860, was it able, upon\r\na forty-fourth ballot, to organize by the election of a Speaker, and\r\nthat from the day of its meeting on the 5th of December, 1859, up to\r\nsuch organization, it was involved in an incessant and stormy wrangle\r\nupon the Slavery question.\r\n\r\nSo also in the Democratic Senate, the split in the Democratic Party,\r\nbetween the Lecompton and Anti-Lecompton Democracy, was widened, at the\r\nsame time that the Republicans of the North were further irritated, by\r\nthe significantly decisive passage of a series of resolutions proposed\r\nby Jefferson Davis, which, on the one hand, purposely and deliberately\r\nknifed Douglas's \"Popular Sovereignty\" doctrine and read out of the\r\nParty all who believed in it, by declaring \"That neither Congress nor a\r\nTerritorial Legislature, whether by direct legislation, or legislation\r\nof an indirect and unfriendly character, possesses power to annul or\r\nimpair the Constitutional right of any citizen of the United States to\r\ntake his Slave-property into the common Territories, and there hold and\r\nenjoy the same while the Territorial condition remains,\" and, on the\r\nother, purposely and deliberately slapped in the face the Republicans of\r\nthe North, by declaring-among other things \"That in the adoption of the\r\nFederal Constitution, the States adopting the same, acted severally as\r\nFree and Independent sovereignties, delegating a portion of their powers\r\nto be exercised by the Federal Government for the increased security of\r\neach against dangers, domestic as well as foreign; and that any\r\nintermeddling by any one or more States or by a combination of their\r\ncitizens, with the domestic institutions of the others, on any pretext\r\nwhatever, political, moral, or religious, with a view to their\r\ndisturbance or subversion, is in violation of the Constitution,\r\ninsulting to the States so interfered with, endangers their domestic\r\npeace and tranquillity--objects for which the Constitution was formed\r\n--and, by necessary consequence, tends to weaken and destroy the Union\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of these resolutions declared Negro Slavery to be recognized in\r\nthe Constitution, and that all \"open or covert attacks thereon with a\r\nview to its overthrow,\" made either by the Non-Slave-holding States or\r\ntheir citizens, violated the pledges of the Constitution, \"are a\r\nmanifest breach of faith, and a violation of the most solemn\r\nobligations.\"\r\n\r\nThis last was intended as a blow at the Freedom of Speech and of the\r\nPress in the North; and only served, as was doubtless intended, to still\r\nmore inflame Northern public feeling, while at the same time endeavoring\r\nto place the arrogant and aggressive Slave Power in an attitude of\r\ninjured innocence.  In short, the time of both Houses of Congress was\r\nalmost entirely consumed during the Session of 1859-60 in the heated,\r\nand sometimes even furious, discussion of the Slavery question; and\r\neverywhere, North and South, the public mind was not alone deeply\r\nagitated, but apprehensive that the Union was founded not upon a rock,\r\nbut upon the crater of a volcano, whose long-smouldering energies might\r\nat any moment burst their confines, and reduce it to ruin and\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of April, 1860, the Democratic National Convention met at\r\nCharleston, South Carolina.  It was several days after the permanent\r\norganization of the Convention before the Committee on Resolutions\r\nreported to the main body, and not until the 30th of April did it reach\r\na vote upon the various reports, which had in the meantime been\r\nmodified.  The propositions voted upon were three:\r\n\r\nFirst, The Majority Report of the Committee, which reaffirmed the\r\nCincinnati platform of 1856--with certain \"explanatory\" resolutions\r\nadded, which boldly proclaimed: That the Government of a Territory\r\norganized by an Act of Congress, is provisional and temporary; and,\r\nduring its existence, all citizens of the United States have an equal\r\nright to settle with their property in the Territory, without their\r\nrights, either of person or property, being destroyed or impaired by\r\nCongressional or Territorial Legislation;\" that \"it is the duty of the\r\nFederal Government, in all its departments, to protect, when necessary,\r\nthe rights of persons and property in the Territories, and wherever else\r\nits Constitutional authority extends;\" that \"when the settlers in a\r\nTerritory, having an adequate population, form a State Constitution, the\r\nright of Sovereignty commences, and, being consummated by admission into\r\nthe Union, they stand on an equal footing with the people of other\r\nStates, and the State thus organized ought to be admitted into the\r\nFederal Union, whether its Constitution prohibits or recognizes the\r\ninstitution of Slavery;\" and that \"the enactments of State Legislatures\r\nto defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, are hostile\r\nin character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in\r\neffect.\"  The resolutions also included a declaration in favor of the\r\nacquisition of Cuba, and other comparatively minor matters.\r\n\r\nSecond, The Minority Report of the Committee, which, after re-affirming\r\nthe Cincinnati platform, declared that \"Inasmuch as differences of\r\nopinion exist in the Democratic party as to the nature and extent of the\r\npowers of a Territorial Legislature, and as to the powers and duties of\r\nCongress, under the Constitution of the United States, over the\r\ninstitution of Slavery within the Territories * * * the Democratic Party\r\nwill abide by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on\r\nthe questions of Constitutional law.\"\r\n\r\nThird, The recommendation of Benjamin F. Butler, that the platform\r\nshould consist simply of a re-affirmation of the Cincinnati platform,\r\nand not another word.\r\n\r\nThe last proposition was first voted on, and lost, by 105 yeas to 198\r\nnays.  The Minority platform was then adopted by 165 yeas to 138 nays.\r\n\r\nThe aggressive Slave-holders (Majority) platform, and the Butler\r\nCompromise do-nothing proposition, being both defeated, and the Douglas\r\n(Minority) platform adopted, the Alabama delegation, under instructions\r\nfrom their State Convention to withdraw in case the National Convention\r\nrefused to adopt radical Territorial Pro-Slavery resolutions, at once\r\npresented a written protest and withdrew from the Convention, and were\r\nfollowed, in rapid succession, by; the delegates from Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana (all but two), South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Arkansas (in\r\npart), Delaware (mostly), and Georgia (mostly)--the seceding delegates\r\nafterwards organizing in another Hall, adopting the above Majority\r\nplatform, and after a four days' sitting, adjourning to meet at\r\nRichmond, Virginia, on the 11th of June.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Regular Democratic National Convention had proceeded to\r\nballot for President--after adopting the two-thirds rule.  Thirty-seven\r\nballots having been cast, that for Stephen A. Douglas being, on the\r\nthirty-seventh, 151, the Convention, on the 3d of May, adjourned to meet\r\nagain at Baltimore, June 18th.\r\n\r\nAfter re-assembling, and settling contested election cases, the\r\ndelegates (in whole or in part) from Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, California, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland and Massachusetts,\r\nwithdrew from the Convention, the latter upon the ground mainly that\r\nthere had been \"a withdrawal, in part, of a majority of the States,\"\r\nwhile Butler, who had voted steadily for Jefferson Davis throughout all\r\nthe balloting at Charleston, gave as an additional ground personal to\r\nhimself, that \"I will not sit in a convention where the African Slave\r\nTrade--which is piracy by the laws of my Country--is approvingly\r\nadvocated\"--referring thereby to a speech, that had been much applauded\r\nby the Convention at Charleston, made by a Georgia delegate (Gaulden),\r\nin which that delegate had said: \"I would ask my friends of the South to\r\ncome up in a proper spirit; ask our Northern friends to give us all our\r\nrights, and take off the ruthless restrictions which cut off the supply\r\nof Slaves from foreign lands.  * * *  I tell you, fellow Democrats, that\r\nthe African Slave Trader is the true Union man (cheers and laughter).  I\r\ntell you that the Slave Trading of Virginia is more immoral, more\r\nunchristian in every possible point of view, than that African Slave\r\nTrade which goes to Africa and brings a heathen and worthless man here,\r\nmakes him a useful man, Christianizes him, and sends him and his\r\nposterity down the stream of Time, to enjoy the blessings of\r\ncivilization.  (Cheers and laughter.) * * *  I come from the first\r\nCongressional District of Georgia.  I represent the African Slave Trade\r\ninterest of that Section.  (Applause.) I am proud of the position I\r\noccupy in that respect.  I believe that the African Slave Trader is a\r\ntrue missionary, and a true Christian.  (Applause.) * * *  Are you\r\nprepared to go back to first principles, and take off your\r\nunconstitutional restrictions, and leave this question to be settled by\r\neach State?  Now, do this, fellow citizens, and you will have Peace in\r\nthe Country.  * * *  I advocate the repeal of the laws prohibiting the\r\nAfrican Slave Trade, because I believe it to be the true Union movement.\r\n* * *  I believe that by re-opening this Trade and giving us Negroes to\r\npopulate the Territories, the equilibrium of the two Sections will be\r\nmaintained.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the bolting delegates at Baltimore, the\r\nConvention proceeded to ballot for President, and at the end of the\r\nsecond ballot, Mr. Douglas having received \"two-thirds of all votes\r\ngiven in the Convention\" (183) was declared the \"regular nominee of the\r\nDemocratic Party, for the office of President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAn additional resolution was subsequently adopted as a part of the\r\nplatform, declaring that \"it is in accordance with the true\r\ninterpretation of the Cincinnati platform, that, during the existence of\r\nthe Territorial Governments, the measure of restriction, whatever it may\r\nbe, imposed by the Federal Constitution on the power of the Territorial\r\nLegislatures over the subject of the domestic relations, as the same has\r\nbeen, or shall hereafter be, finally determined by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, should be respected by all good citizens, and\r\nenforced with promptness and fidelity by every branch of the General\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of June, pursuant to adjournment, the Democratic Bolters'\r\nConvention met at Richmond, and, after adjourning to meet at Baltimore,\r\nfinally met there on the 28th of that month--twenty-one States being, in\r\nwhole or in part, represented.  This Convention unanimously readopted\r\nthe Southern-wing platform it had previously adopted at Charleston, and,\r\nupon the first ballot, chose, without dissent, John C. Breckinridge of\r\nKentucky, as its candidate for the Presidential office.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, the National Conventions of other Parties had\r\nbeen held, viz.: that of the Republican Party at Chicago, which, with a\r\nsession of three days, May 16-18, had nominated Abraham Lincoln of\r\nIllinois and Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, for President and Vice-President\r\nrespectively; and that of the \"Constitutional Union\" (or Native\r\nAmerican) Party which had severally nominated (May 19) for such\r\npositions, John Bell of Tennessee, and Edward Everett of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe material portion of the Republican National platform, adopted with\r\nentire unanimity by their Convention, was, so far as the Slavery and\r\nDisunion questions were concerned, comprised in these declarations:\r\n\r\nFirst, That the history of the nation, during the last four years, has\r\nfully established the propriety and necessity of the organization and\r\nperpetuation of the Republican Party; and that the causes which called\r\nit into existence are permanent in their nature, and now, more than ever\r\nbefore, demand its peaceful and Constitutional triumph.\r\n\r\nSecond, That the maintenance of the principle, promulgated in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and embodied in the Federal Constitution,\r\n\"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator\r\nwith certain inalienable rights; that among these are Life, Liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of Happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are\r\ninstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned,\" is essential to the preservation of our Republican\r\ninstitutions; and that the Federal Constitution, the Rights of the\r\nStates, and the Union of the States must and shall be preserved.\r\n\r\nThird, That to the Union of the States, this Nation owes its\r\nunprecedented increase in population, its surprising development of\r\nmaterial resources, its rapid augmentation of wealth, its happiness at\r\nhome, and its honor abroad; and we hold in abhorrence all schemes for\r\nDisunion, come from whatever source they may: And we congratulate the\r\nCountry that no Republican member of Congress has uttered or\r\ncountenanced the threats of Disunion, so often made by Democratic\r\nmembers, without rebuke, and with applause, from their political\r\nassociates; and we denounce those threats of Disunion, in case of a\r\npopular overthrow of their ascendancy, as denying the vital principles\r\nof a free Government, and as an avowal of contemplated Treason, which it\r\nis the imperative duty of an indignant People, sternly to rebuke and\r\nforever silence.\r\n\r\nFourth, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and\r\nespecially the right of each State, to order and control its own\r\ndomestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is\r\nessential to that balance of powers on which the perfection and\r\nendurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless\r\ninvasion, by armed force, of any State or Territory, no matter under\r\nwhat pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.\r\n\r\nFifth, That the present Democratic Administration has far exceeded our\r\nworst apprehensions, in its measureless subserviency to the exactions of\r\na Sectional interest, as especially evinced in its desperate exertions\r\nto force the infamous Lecompton Constitution upon the protesting people\r\nof Kansas; in construing the personal relation between master and\r\nservant to involve an unqualified property in persons; in its attempted\r\nenforcement, everywhere, on land and sea, through the intervention of\r\nCongress and of the Federal Courts, of the extreme pretensions of a\r\npurely local interest; and in its general and unvarying abuse of the\r\npower intrusted to it by a confiding People.\r\n\r\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\nSeventh, That the new dogma that the Constitution, of its own force,\r\ncarries Slavery into any or all of the Territories of the United States,\r\nis a dangerous political heresy, at variance with the explicit\r\nprovisions of that instrument itself, with contemporaneous exposition,\r\nand with legislation and judicial precedent; is revolutionary in its\r\ntendency and subversive of the peace and harmony of the Country.\r\n\r\nEighth, That the normal condition of all the territory of the United\r\nStates is that of Freedom; that as our Republican fathers, when they had\r\nabolished Slavery in all our National Territory, ordained that \"No\r\nperson should be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due\r\nprocess of law,\" it becomes our duty, by legislation, whenever such\r\nlegislation is necessary, to maintain this provision of the Constitution\r\nagainst all attempts to violate it; and we deny the authority of\r\nCongress, of a Territorial Legislature, or of any individuals, to give\r\nlegal existence to Slavery in any Territory of the United States.\r\n\r\nNinth, That we brand the recent re-opening of the African Slave-trade\r\nunder the cover of our National flag, aided by perversions of judicial\r\npower, as a crime against humanity and a burning shame to our Country\r\nand Age; and we call upon Congress to take prompt and efficient measures\r\nfor the total and final suppression of that execrable traffic.\r\n\r\nTenth, That in the recent vetoes, by their Federal Governors, of the\r\nacts of the Legislatures of Kansas and Nebraska, prohibiting Slavery in\r\nthose Territories, we find a practical illustration of the boasted\r\nDemocratic principle of Non-Intervention and Popular Sovereignty\r\nembodied in the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, and a demonstration of the\r\ndeception and fraud involved therein.\r\n\r\nEleventh, That Kansas should, of right, be immediately admitted as a\r\nState, under the Constitution recently formed and adopted by the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\n               *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nThe National platform of the \"Constitutional Union\" Party, was adopted,\r\nunanimously, in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, experience has demonstrated that platforms adopted by the\r\npartisan Conventions of the Country have had the effect to mislead and\r\ndeceive the People, and at the same time to widen the political\r\ndivisions of the Country, by the creation and encouragement of\r\ngeographical and Sectional parties; therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That it is both the part of patriotism and of\r\nduty to recognize no political principle other than the Constitution of\r\nthe Country, the Union of the States, and the Enforcement of the Laws,\r\nand that, as representatives of the Constitutional Union men of the\r\nCountry, in National Convention assembled, we hereby pledge ourselves to\r\nmaintain, protect, and defend, separately and unitedly, these great\r\nprinciples of public liberty and national safety, against all enemies,\r\nat home and abroad; believing that thereby peace may once more be\r\nrestored to the Country, the rights of the people and of the States\r\nre-established, and the Government again placed in that condition of\r\njustice, fraternity, and equality which, under the example and\r\nConstitution of our fathers, has solemnly bound every citizen of the\r\nUnited States to maintain a more perfect Union, establish justice,\r\ninsure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote\r\nthe general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves\r\nand our posterity.\"\r\n\r\nThus, by the last of June, 1860, the four National Parties with their\r\nplatforms and candidates were all in the political field prepared for\r\nthe onset.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the attitude of the standard-bearers representing the\r\nplatform-principles of their several Parties, was this:\r\n\r\nLincoln, representing the Republicans, held that Slavery is a wrong, to\r\nbe tolerated in the States where it exists, but which must be excluded\r\nfrom the Territories, which are all normally Free and must be kept Free\r\nby Congressional legislation, if necessary; and that neither Congress,\r\nnor the Territorial Legislature, nor any individual, has power to give\r\nto it legal existence in such Territories.\r\n\r\nBreckinridge, representing the Pro-Slavery wing of the Democracy, held\r\nthat Slavery is a right, which, when transplanted from the Slave-States\r\ninto the Territories, neither Congressional nor Territorial legislation\r\ncan destroy or impair, but which, on the contrary, must, when necessary,\r\nbe protected everywhere by Congress and all other departments of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nDouglas, representing the Anti-Lecompton wing of Democracy, held that\r\nwhether Slavery be right or wrong, the white inhabitants of the\r\nTerritories have the sole right to determine whether it shall or shall\r\nnot exist within their respective limits, subject to the Constitution\r\nand Supreme Court decisions thereon; and that neither Congress nor any\r\nState, nor any outside persons, must interfere with that right.\r\n\r\nBell, representing the remaining political elements, held that it was\r\nall wrong to have any principles at all, except \"the Constitution of the\r\nCountry, the Union of the States, and the Enforcement of the Laws\"--a\r\nplatform which Horace Greeley well described as \"meaning anything in\r\ngeneral, and nothing in particular.\"\r\n\r\nThe canvass that ensued was terribly exciting--Douglas alone, of all the\r\nPresidential candidates, bravely taking the field, both North and South,\r\nin person, in the hope that the magnetism of his personal presence and\r\npowerful intellect might win what, from the start--owing to the adverse\r\nmachinations, in the Northern States, of the Administration or\r\nBreckinridge-Democratic wing--seemed an almost hopeless fight.  In the\r\nSouth, the Democracy was almost a unit in opposition to Douglas,\r\nholding, as they did, that \"Douglas Free-Soilism\" was \"far more\r\ndangerous to the South than the election of Lincoln; because it seeks to\r\ncreate a Free-Soil Party there; while, if Lincoln triumphs, the result\r\ncannot fail to be a South united in her own defense;\" while the old Whig\r\nelement of the South was as unitedly for Bell.  In the North, the\r\nDemocracy were split in twain, three-fourths of them upholding Douglas,\r\nand the balance, powerful beyond their numbers in the possession of\r\nFederal Offices, bitterly hostile to him, and anxious to beat him, even\r\nat the expense of securing the election of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nDouglas's fight was that the candidacy and platform of Bell were\r\nmeaningless, those of both Lincoln and Breckinridge, Sectional, and that\r\nhe alone bore aloft the standard of the entire Union; while, on the\r\nother hand, the supporters of Lincoln, his chief antagonist, claimed\r\nthat--as the burden of the song from the lips of Douglas men, Bell men,\r\nand Breckinridge men alike, was the expression of a \"fear that,\" in the\r\nlanguage of Mr. Seward, \"if the people elected Mr. Lincoln to the\r\nPresidency, they would wake up and find that they had no Country for him\r\nto preside over\"--\"therefore, all three of the parties opposing Mr.\r\nLincoln were in the same boat, and hence the only true Union party, was\r\nthe party which made no threats of Disunion, to wit, the Republican\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\nThe October elections of 1860 made it plain that Mr. Lincoln would be\r\nelected.  South Carolina began to \"feel good\" over the almost certainty\r\nthat the pretext for Secession for which her leaders had been hoping in\r\nvain for thirty years, was at hand.  On the 25th of October, at Augusta,\r\nSouth Carolina, the Governor, the Congressional delegation, and other\r\nleading South Carolinians, met, and decided that in the event of Mr.\r\nLincoln's election, that State would secede.  Similar meetings, to the\r\nsame end, were also held about the same time, in others of the Southern\r\nStates.  On the 5th of November--the day before the Presidential\r\nelection--the Legislature of South Carolina met at the special call of\r\nGovernor Gist, and, having organized, received a Message from the\r\nGovernor, in which, after stating that he had convened that Body in\r\norder that they might on the morrow \"appoint the number of electors of\r\nPresident and Vice-President to which this State is entitled,\" he\r\nproceeded to suggest \"that the Legislature remain in session, and take\r\nsuch action as will prepare the State for any emergency that may arise.\"\r\nHe went on to \"earnestly recommend that, in the event of Abraham\r\nLincoln's election to the Presidency, a Convention of the people of this\r\nState be immediately called, to consider and determine for themselves\r\nthe mode and measure of redress,\" and, he continued: \"I am constrained\r\nto say that the only alternative left, in my judgment, is the Secession\r\nof South Carolina from the Federal Union.  The indications from many of\r\nthe Southern States justify the conclusion that the Secession of South\r\nCarolina will be immediately followed, if not adopted simultaneously, by\r\nthem, and ultimately by the entire South.  The long-desired cooperation\r\nof the other States having similar institutions, for which so many of\r\nour citizens have been waiting, seems to be near at hand; and, if we are\r\ntrue to ourselves, will soon be realized.  The State has, with great\r\nunanimity declared that she has the right peaceably to Secede, and no\r\npower on earth can rightfully prevent it.\"\r\n\r\n     [Referring to the Ordinance of Nullification adopted by the people\r\n     of South Carolina, November 24, 1832, growing out of the Tariff Act\r\n     of 1832--wherein it was declared that, in the event of the Federal\r\n     Government undertaking to enforce the provisions of that Act: \"The\r\n     people of this State will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from\r\n     all further obligation to maintain or preserve their political\r\n     connection with the people of the other States, and will forthwith\r\n     proceed to organize a separate government, and do all other acts\r\n     and things which Sovereign and independent States may of right\r\n     do.\"]\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to say that \"If, in the exercise of arbitrary power, and\r\nforgetful of the lessons of history, the Government of the United States\r\nshould attempt coercion, it will become our solemn duty to meet force by\r\nforce\"--and promised that the decision of the aforesaid Convention\r\n\"representing the Sovereignty of the State, and amenable to no earthly\r\ntribunal,\" should be, by him, \"carried out to the letter.\"  He\r\nrecommended the thorough reorganization of the Militia; the arming of\r\nevery man in the State between the ages of eighteen and forty-five; and\r\nthe immediate enrollment of ten thousand volunteers officered by\r\nthemselves; and concluded with a confident \"appeal to the Disposer of\r\nall human events,\" in whose keeping the \"Cause\" was to be entrusted.\r\n\r\nThat same evening (November 5), being the eve of the election, at\r\nAugusta, South Carolina, in response to a serenade, United States\r\nSenator Chestnut made a speech of like import, in which, after\r\npredicting the election of Mr. Lincoln, he said: \"Would the South submit\r\nto a Black Republican President, and a Black Republican Congress, which\r\nwill claim the right to construe the Constitution of the Country, and\r\nadminister the Government in their own hands, not by the law of the\r\ninstrument itself, nor by that of the fathers of the Country, nor by the\r\npractices of those who administered seventy years ago, but by rules\r\ndrawn from their own blind consciences and crazy brains?  * * *  The\r\nPeople now must choose whether they would be governed by enemies, or\r\ngovern themselves.\"\r\n\r\nHe declared that the Secession of South Carolina was an \"undoubted\r\nright,\" a \"duty,\" and their \"only safety\" and as to himself, he would\r\n\"unfurl the Palmetto flag, fling it to the breeze, and, with the spirit\r\nof a brave man, live and die as became\" his \"glorious ancestors, and\r\nring the clarion notes of defiance in the ears of an insolent foe!\"\r\n\r\nSo also, in Columbia, South Carolina, Representative Boyce of that\r\nState, and other prominent politicians, harangued an enthusiastic crowd\r\nthat night--Mr. Boyce declaring: \"I think the only policy for us is to\r\narm, as soon as we receive authentic intelligence of the election of\r\nLincoln.  It is for South Carolina, in the quickest manner, and by the\r\nmost direct means, to withdraw from the Union.  Then we will not submit,\r\nwhether the other Southern States will act with us or with our enemies.\r\nThey cannot take sides with our enemies; they must take sides with us.\r\nWhen an ancient philosopher wished to inaugurate a great revolution, his\r\nmotto was to dare! to dare!\"",
