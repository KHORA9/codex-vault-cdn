In\r\nIreland, soon after the collapse of the Clontarf meeting, O'Connell\r\nand some of his associates were indicted for seditious conspiracy,\r\nand convicted. The conviction was subsequently quashed on technical\r\ngrounds, but O'Connell's political influence was at an end. In\r\nParliament, owing chiefly to the exertions of Lord Ashley (afterwards\r\nEarl of Shaftesbury), an important Bill was passed restricting factory\r\nlabour, and limiting its hours. The Bank Charter Act, separating the\r\nissue and banking departments, as well as regulating the note issue\r\nof the Bank of England in proportion to its stock of gold, also\r\nbecame law. Meanwhile the dissensions in the Conservative party were\r\nincreasing, and the Ministry were defeated on a motion made by their\r\nown supporters to extend the preferential treatment of colonial\r\nproduce. With great difficulty the vote was rescinded and a crisis\r\naverted; but the Young England section of the Tory party were becoming\r\nmore and more an embarrassment to the Premier. Towards the end of\r\nthe year the new Royal Exchange was opened amid much ceremony by the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nThe services rendered by Sir Charles Napier in India were the subject\r\nof votes of thanks in both Houses, but shortly afterwards Lord\r\nEllenborough, the Governor-General, was recalled by the Directors\r\nof the East India Company: their action was no doubt due to his\r\noverbearing methods and love of display, but it was disapproved by the\r\nMinistry, and Lord Ellenborough was accorded an Earldom.\r\n\r\nDuring the year there was a recrudescence of the friction between this\r\ncountry and France, due partly to questions as to the right of search\r\nof foreign ships, partly to a _brochure_ issued by the Prince de\r\nJoinville, a son of Louis Philippe, partly to the assumption of French\r\nsovereignty over Tahiti and the seizure of the English consul there\r\nby the French authorities. Reparation however was made, and the\r\nill-feeling subsided sufficiently to enable the King of the French to\r\nvisit Queen Victoria,--the first friendly visit ever paid by a\r\nFrench king to the Sovereign of England. Louis Philippe was cordially\r\nreceived in this country.\r\n\r\nAnother historic royal visit also took place in 1844, that of the\r\nEmperor Nicholas, who no doubt was so much impressed with his friendly\r\nreception, both by the Court and by Aberdeen, the Foreign Secretary,\r\nthat nine years later he thought he could calculate on the support of\r\nEngland under Aberdeen (then Premier) in a scheme for the partition\r\nof Turkey. Lord Malmesbury, who a few years later became Foreign\r\nSecretary, states in his memoirs that during this visit, the Czar, Sir\r\nRobert Peel, the Duke of Wellington, and Lord Aberdeen \"drew up and\r\nsigned a Memorandum, the spirit and scope of which was to support\r\nRussia in her legitimate protectorship of the Greek religion and\r\nthe Holy Shrines, and to do so without consulting France,\" but\r\nthe Memorandum was in reality only one made by Nicholas of his\r\nrecollection of the interview, and communicated subsequently to Lord\r\nAberdeen.\r\n\r\nNo events of special interest took place in other parts of Europe;\r\nthe condition of affairs in the Peninsula improved, though the\r\nannouncement of the unfortunate marriage of the Queen Mother with\r\nthe Duke of Rianzares was not of hopeful augury for the young Queen\r\nIsabella's future; as a matter of fact, the marriage had taken place\r\nsome time previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n1844\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _9th January 1844._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the pleasure of receiving your kind letter of\r\nthe 4th, which is written from Ardenne, where I grieve to see you are\r\nagain gone without my beloved Louise.\r\n\r\nCharlotte is the admiration of every one, and I wish much I could have\r\nseen the three dear children _en representation_.\r\n\r\nOur fat Vic or Pussette learns a verse of _Lamartine_ by heart, which\r\nends with \"le tableau se deroule a mes pieds\"; to show how well she\r\nhad understood this difficult line which Mdlle. Charier had explained\r\nto her, I must tell you the following _bon mot_. When she was riding\r\non her pony, and looking at the cows and sheep, she turned to Mdlle.\r\nCharier and said: \"_Voila_ le tableau qui se deroule a mes pieds.\" Is\r\nnot this extraordinary for a little child of three years old? It is\r\nmore like what a person of twenty would say. You have no notion _what_\r\na knowing, and I am sorry to say _sly_, little rogue she is, and\r\nso _obstinate_. She and _le petit Frere_ accompany us to dear old\r\nClaremont to-day; Alice remains here under Lady Lyttelton's care. How\r\nsorry I am that you should have hurt your leg, and in such a provoking\r\nway; Albert says he remembers well your playing often with a pen-knife\r\nwhen you talked, and I remember it also, but it is really dangerous.\r\n\r\nI am happy that the news from Paris are good; the really good\r\nunderstanding between our two Governments provokes the Carlists and\r\nAnarchists. Bordeaux[1] is not yet gone; I saw in a letter that it was\r\n_debated_ in his presence whether he was on any favourable occasion\r\n_de se presenter en France!_Do you think that possible? Then again\r\nthe papers say that there are fortifications being made on the coast\r\nof Normandy for fear of an invasion; is this so? These are many\r\nquestions, but I hope you will kindly answer them, as they interest\r\nme. With Albert's love. Believe me, ever, your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The Duc de Bordeaux, only son of the Duc de\r\n    Berri, had by the death of Charles X. and the renunciation\r\n    of all claims to the French Throne on the part of the Duc\r\n    d'Angouleme, become the representative of the elder branch of\r\n    the Bourbons. He had intended his visit to England to have a\r\n    private character only.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE SPANISH MARRIAGE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _10th January 1844_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen understands that there is a negotiation with Sweden and\r\nDenmark pending about the cessation of their tribute to Morocco,\r\nlikewise that Prince Metternich has sent a despatch condemning as\r\nunfair the understanding come to between us and France about the\r\nSpanish marriage;[2] that there is a notion of exchanging Hong Kong\r\nfor a more healthy colony.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, taking a deep interest in all these matters, and feeling it\r\nher duty to do so, begs Lord Aberdeen to keep her always well informed\r\nof what is on the _tapis_ in his Department.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: _See ante_, vol. i. p. 487.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _13th January 1844._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of the 10th, and returns\r\nhim the papers which he sent her, with her best thanks. She does not\r\nremember to have seen them before.\r\n\r\nThe Queen takes this opportunity to beg Lord Aberdeen to cause the\r\ndespatches to be sent a little sooner from the Foreign Office,\r\nas drafts in particular have often come to the Queen a week or a\r\nfortnight after they had actually been sent across the sea.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Hanoverian Orders, Lord Aberdeen has not quite\r\nunderstood what the Queen meant. It was Sir C. Thornton and others\r\nto whom the Queen had refused permission to accept the favour, on a\r\nformer occasion, by which the King of Hanover was much affronted. The\r\nQueen would not like to have herself additionally fettered by any new\r\nregulation, but Lord Aberdeen will certainly concur with the Queen\r\nthat it would not be expedient to give to the King of Hanover a power\r\nwhich the Queen herself does not possess, viz. that of granting orders\r\nas favours, or for personal services; as the number of the different\r\nclasses of the Guelphic Order bestowed on Englishmen is innumerable,\r\nit would actually invest the King with such a power, which,\r\nconsidering how much such things are sought after, might be extremely\r\ninconvenient.\r\n\r\nThe Queen will not give a final decision upon this case until she\r\nreturns to Windsor, where she has papers explanatory of the reasons\r\nwhich caused her to decline the King of Hanover's application in 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A CARRIAGE ACCIDENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _16th January 1844._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your kind letter of the 11th.\r\nLouise can give you the details of the little upset I and Lady Douro\r\nhad, and which I did not think worth while to mention.[3] It was the\r\nstrangest thing possible to happen, and the most _unlikely_, for we\r\nwere going quite quietly, not at all in a narrow lane, with very quiet\r\nponies and my usual postillion; the fact was that the boy looked the\r\n_wrong_ way, and therefore did not perceive the ditch which he so\r\ncleverly got us into.\r\n\r\nWe leave dear Claremont, as usual, with the greatest regret; we are\r\nso peaceable here; Windsor is beautiful and comfortable, but it is a\r\n_palace_, and God knows _how willingly_ I would _always_ live with my\r\nbeloved Albert and our children in the quiet and retirement of private\r\nlife, and not be the constant object of observation, and of newspaper\r\narticles. The children (Pussette and Bertie) have been most remarkably\r\nwell, and so have we, in spite of the very bad weather we had most\r\ndays. I am truly and really grieved that good excellent Nemours\r\nis again _not_ to get his _dotation_.[4] Really we constitutional\r\ncountries are _too shabby_.\r\n\r\nNow, dearest Uncle, I must bid you adieu, begging you to believe me,\r\never your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: On the 5th of January the Queen's phaeton was\r\n    overturned at Horton, near Dachet, while driving to the meet\r\n    of Prince Albert's Harriers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: On the occasion of the marriage of the Duc and\r\n    Duchesse de Nemours (1840), the proposal made by the Soult\r\n    Government for a Parliamentary grant of 500,000 francs had\r\n    been rejected.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FRANCE AND ENGLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th January 1844._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I must begin by thanking you for your kind letter\r\nof the 26th, and by wishing you joy that the fete went off _so_ well.\r\nI am glad Leo will appear at the next ball; he is nearly nine years\r\nold, and it is good to accustom children of his rank early to these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nGuizot's speech is exceedingly admired, with the exception of his\r\nhaving said more than he was justified to do about the right of\r\nsearch.[5] Our speech has been very difficult to frame; we should like\r\nto have mentioned our visits to France and Belgium, but it has been\r\nfound impossible to do so; _France is_ mentioned, and it is the first\r\ntime since 1834!\r\n\r\nTo-morrow we go up to Town \"pour ce bore,\" as the good King always\r\nsaid to me; whenever there were tiresome people to present he always\r\nsaid: \"Je vous demande pardon de ce _bore_.\"\r\n\r\nI have had a tiresome though not at all violent cold which _I was_\r\nalarmed might spoil the _sonorousness_ of my voice for the speech on\r\nThursday, but it promises well now.\r\n\r\nI own I always look with horror to the beginning of a Parliamentary\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nWith Albert's love.

Our promised visit,\r\nour dearest Papa's, and our fondest wish, all is put an end to. The\r\nviolence of our grief may be over, but the desolate feeling which\r\nsucceeds it is worse, and tears are a relief. I have never known real\r\n_grief_ till now, and it has made a lasting impression on me. A father\r\nis _such_ a _near_ relation, you are a _piece_ of him in fact,--and\r\nall (as my poor _deeply afflicted_ Angel says) the earliest pleasures\r\nof your life were given you by a dear father; that can _never be\r\nreplaced_ though time may soften the pang. And indeed one loves to\r\n_cling_ to one's grief; I can understand Louise's feeling in her\r\noverwhelming sorrows.\r\n\r\nLet me now join my humble entreaties to Albert's, relative to the\r\nrequest about dearest Louise, which he has made. It is a sacrifice\r\nI ask, but if you _knew_ the sacrifice I make in letting and urging\r\nAlbert _to go_, I am sure, if you _can_ you _will_ grant it. I have\r\n_never_ been separated from him even for _one night_, and the _thought\r\nof such_ a separation is quite dreadful; still, I feel I _could_ bear\r\nit,--I have made up my mind to it, as the very _thought_ of going has\r\nbeen a comfort to my poor Angel, and will be of such use at Coburg.\r\nStill, if I were to remain _quite_ alone I do not think I _could_ bear\r\nit quietly. Therefore _pray_ do send me my dearly beloved Louise; she\r\nwould be _such_ a comfort to me; if you could come too--or afterwards\r\n(as you promised us a longer visit), that would be still more\r\ndelightful. I may be indiscreet, but you must think of _what_ the\r\nseparation from my _all and all_, even only for a _fortnight_, will be\r\nto me!\r\n\r\nWe feel some _years_ older since these days of mourning. Mamma is\r\ncalm, but poor Aunt Julia[7] is indeed much to be pitied. Ever,\r\ndearest Uncle, your devoted and unhappy Niece and Child,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: The Duke of Saxe-Coburg Gotha died on 29th\r\n    January.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The Grand Duchess Constantine of Russia,\r\n    sister of the Duchess of Kent and of the deceased Duke of\r\n    Saxe-Coburg.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BEREAVEMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _13th February 1844._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your dear, kind but sad letter of the\r\n8th on Sunday, and thank you much for it. God knows, poor dear Uncle,\r\nyou have suffered _enough_ in your life, but you should think, dearest\r\nUncle, of _that blessed_ assurance of _eternity_ where we shall _all\r\nmeet again never_ to part; you should think (as we constantly do now)\r\nthat those whom we have lost are far happier than we are, and _love\r\nus_ still, and in a far more perfect way than _we can_ do in this\r\nworld! When the first moments and days of overwhelming grief are over\r\nthese reflections are the greatest balm, the greatest consolation to\r\nthe bleeding heart.\r\n\r\nI hope you will kindly let me have a few lines of _hope_ by the\r\nTuesday's messenger.

Lord Melbourne\r\nbelieves that your Majesty is quite right in saying that Lord\r\nMelbourne has still some health left, if he will but take care of\r\nit. Lord Melbourne told Dr Holland, without mentioning your Majesty's\r\nname, that this had been said to him by a friend, and Dr Holland\r\nimmediately said that it was very just and true, and very well\r\nexpressed, and quite what he should have said himself. At the same\r\ntime, the change from strength to weakness and the evident progress\r\nof decadence is a very hard and disagreeable trial. Lord Melbourne has\r\nbeen reading Cicero on old age, a very pretty treatise, but he does\r\nnot find much consolation after it; the principal practical resources\r\nand alleviations which he recommends are agriculture and gardening, to\r\nboth of which, but more particularly to the latter, Lord Melbourne has\r\nalready had recourse. It is certainly, as your Majesty says, wrong to\r\nbe impatient and to repine at everything, but still it is difficult\r\nnot to be so. Lady Uxbridge's death[9] is a shocking event, a\r\ndreadful loss to him and to all. Lord Melbourne always liked her. Lord\r\nMelbourne is going down to Brocket Hall to-morrow, and will try to get\r\nUxbridge and the girls to come over and dine.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has felt very much for the grief which your Majesty\r\nmust feel at a separation, even short and temporary, from the Prince,\r\nand it is extremely amiable to feel comforted by the recollection\r\nof the extreme pleasure which his visit will give to his and your\r\nMajesty's relations. It is, of course, impossible that your Majesty\r\nshould in travelling divest yourself of your character and dignity.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne has just driven round the Regent's Park, where there\r\nare many almond trees in bloom, and looking beautiful.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Henrietta Maria, daughter of Sir Charles Bagot,\r\n    G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RECALL OF LORD ELLENBOROUGH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _23rd April 1844._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave to\r\nacquaint your Majesty that he has every reason to believe that the\r\nCourt of Directors will _to-morrow_, by an unanimous vote, resolve on\r\nthe actual recall of Lord Ellenborough.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: This anomalous privilege was exercised by the\r\n    Directors in consequence chiefly of what they considered Lord\r\n    Ellenborough's overbearing demeanour in communication with\r\n    them, his too aggressive policy, and his theatrical love of\r\n    display.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nBuckingham Palace, _23rd April 1844._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has heard with the greatest regret from Sir R. Peel that the\r\nCourt of Directors, after all, mean to recall Lord Ellenborough. She\r\ncannot but consider this _very_ unwise at this critical moment, and a\r\nvery ungrateful return for the eminent services Lord Ellenborough has\r\nrendered to the Company in India. They ought not to forget so soon in\r\nwhat state Lord Ellenborough found affairs in 1842.

I have ever had the care and affection of a _real father_ for\r\nyou, and it has perhaps even been freer from many drawbacks which\r\noccasionally will exist betwixt parents and children, be they ever\r\nso well and affectionately together. With me, even from the moment in\r\nJanuary 1820, when I was called by a messenger to Sidmouth, my care\r\nfor you has been unremitting, and never has there been a cloud between\r\nus.... A thing which often strikes me, in a very satisfactory manner,\r\nis that we never had any bitter words, a thing which happens even with\r\npeople who are very lovingly together; and the little row which we\r\nhad in 1838 you remember well, and do not now think that _I_\r\nwas wrong.[11] _De pareilles relations sont rares; may they ever\r\ncontinue!_\r\n\r\nI cannot leave this more serious topic without adding that though you\r\nwere always warm-hearted and right-minded, it must strike yourself how\r\nmatured every kind and good feeling is in your generous heart. _The\r\nheart, and not the head, is the safest guide in positions like yours_,\r\nand this not only for this earthly and very short life, but for that\r\nwhich we must hope for hereafter. When a life draws nearer its close,\r\nhow many earthly concerns are there that appear _still in the same\r\nlight_? and how clearly the mind is struck that nothing has been and\r\nis still of _real_ value, than the nobler and better feelings of the\r\nheart; the only good we can hope to keep as a precious store for the\r\nfuture. What do we keep of youth, beauty, richness, power, and even\r\nthe greatest extent of earthly possessions? NOTHING! ...

And this _all_ after our having been on such intimate terms\r\nwith him and having _sailed_ with him! If he comes here, _what_ shall\r\nwe do? Receive with open arms one who has talked of ravaging our\r\ncoasts and burning our towns? Indeed it is most lamentable; you know\r\nhow we like him, and that therefore it must be very annoying to us to\r\nsee him get himself into such a scrape. _We_ shall overlook it, but\r\nthe people _here_ won't! It _will_ blow over, but it will do immense\r\nharm. We who wish to become more and more closely united with the\r\nFrench family are, of course, much put out by this return. We\r\nshall forgive and forget, and feel it was _not_ intended to be\r\npublished--but the public _here_ will _not_ so easily, and will put\r\nthe worst construction on it all.\r\n\r\nPray, dearest Uncle, tell me what _could_ possess Joinville to write\r\nit, and still more to have it printed? Won't it annoy the King and\r\nNemours very much? _Enfin c'est malheureux, c'est indiscret au plus\r\nhaut degre_--and it provokes and vexes us sadly.

Though it does not lessen\r\nthe extreme imprudence of the Prince's publishing what must do harm\r\nto the various French Governments, it certainly is _not_ intentionally\r\nwritten to offend England, and on the contrary frankly proves _us_ to\r\nbe immensely superior to the French Navy in every way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _4th June 1844._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--I gave Louise a long and detailed description of\r\nthe Emperor,[13] etc. The papers are full of the details. A great\r\nevent and a great compliment _his_ visit certainly is, and the\r\npeople _here_ are extremely flattered at it. He is certainly a _very\r\nstriking_ man; still very handsome; his profile is _beautiful_, and\r\nhis manners _most_ dignified and graceful; extremely civil--quite\r\nalarmingly so, as he is so full of attentions and _politesses_. But\r\nthe expression of the _eyes_ is _formidable_, and unlike anything I\r\never saw before. He gives me and Albert the impression of a man who is\r\n_not_ happy, and on whom the weight of his immense power and position\r\nweighs heavily and painfully; he seldom smiles, and when he does\r\nthe expression is _not_ a happy one. He is very easy to get on with.\r\nReally, it seems like a dream when I think that we breakfast and walk\r\nout with _this_ greatest of all earthly Potentates as quietly as if we\r\nwalked, etc., with Charles or any one. We took him, with the dear good\r\nKing of Saxony,[14] who is a great contrast to the _Czar_ (and with\r\nwhom I am _quite_ at my ease), to Adelaide Cottage after breakfast.\r\nThe grass here is just as if it had been burned with fire. _How_ many\r\ndifferent Princes have we not gone the same round with!! The children\r\nare much admired by the _Sovereigns_--(how _grand_ this sounds!)--and\r\nAlice allowed the Emperor to take her in his arms, and kissed him _de\r\nson propre accord_. We are always so thankful that they are _not_ shy.\r\nBoth the Emperor and the King are _quite_ enchanted with Windsor. The\r\nEmperor said very _poliment_: \"C'est digne de vous, Madame.\" I must\r\nsay the Waterloo Room lit up with that entire service of gold looks\r\nsplendid; and the Reception Room, beautiful to sit in afterwards. The\r\nEmperor praised _my_ Angel very much, saying: \"C'est impossible de\r\nvoir un plus joli garcon; il a l'air si noble et si bon\"; which I must\r\nsay _is very_ true. The Emperor amused the King and me by saying he\r\nwas so _embarrasse_ when people were presented to him, and that\r\nhe felt so \"_gauche_\" _en frac_, which certainly he is quite\r\n_unaccustomed_ to wear. If we can do anything to get him to do what is\r\nright by you, we shall be most happy, and Peel and Aberdeen are very\r\nanxious for it. I believe he leaves on Sunday again. To-morrow there\r\nis to be a great review, and on Thursday _I_ shall probably go with\r\nthem to the races; _they_ are gone there with Albert to-day, but I\r\nhave remained at home.\r\n\r\nI think it is time to conclude my long letter.\r\n\r\nIf the French are angry at this visit, let their dear King and their\r\nPrinces come; _they_ will be sure of a _truly affectionate_ reception\r\non our part. The one which Emperor Nicholas has received is cordial\r\nand civil, _mais ne vient pas du c[oe]ur_.\r\n\r\nI humbly beg that any remarks which may _not_ be favourable to our\r\ngreat visitor may _not_ go _beyond_ you and Louise, and _not_ to\r\n_Paris_.

I am delighted that\r\nmy accounts interested you, and I shall try and give you some more\r\nto-day, which you will see come from an unbiassed and impartial mind,\r\nand which I trust therefore _will_ be relied upon. The excitement has\r\nceased as suddenly as it had begun, and I am still confused about it.\r\nI will go back to where I last left you. The _Revue_[15] on the 5th\r\nwas really very interesting, and our reception as well as that of the\r\nEmperor _most_ enthusiastic. Louise tells me you had a review the\r\nsame day, and that it also was so hot. Our children were there,\r\nand charmed. On the 6th we went with the Emperor and King to the\r\nraces,[16] and I never saw such a crowd; again _here_ the reception\r\nwas _most brilliant_. Every evening a large dinner in the Waterloo\r\nRoom, and the two last evenings in uniforms, as the Emperor disliked\r\nso being _en frac_, and was quite embarrassed in it. On the 7th we\r\ntook him and the King back here, and in the evening had a party of 260\r\nabout. On Saturday (8th) my Angel took the Emperor and King to a very\r\nelegant breakfast[17] at Chiswick, which I for prudence' sake did\r\n_not_ go to, but was very sorry for it. In the evening we went to\r\nthe Opera (_not_ in State), but they recognised us, and we were most\r\nbrilliantly received. I had to force the Emperor forward, as he never\r\nwould come forward when I was there, and I was obliged to take him by\r\nthe hand and make him appear; it was impossible to be better bred or\r\nmore respectful than he was towards me. Well, on Sunday afternoon at\r\nfive, he left us (my Angel accompanied him to Woolwich), and he\r\nwas much affected at going, and really unaffectedly touched at his\r\nreception and stay, the simplicity and quietness of which told upon\r\nhis love of domestic life, which is very great. I will now (having\r\ntold _all_ that has passed) give you _my_ opinion and feelings on the\r\nsubject, which I may say are Albert's also. I was extremely against\r\nthe visit, fearing the _gene_, and bustle, and even at first, I did\r\nnot feel at _all_ to like it, but by living in the same house together\r\nquietly and unrestrainedly (and this Albert, and with great truth,\r\nsays is the great advantage of these visits, that I not only _see_\r\nthese great people but _know_ them), I got to know the Emperor and he\r\nto know me. There is much about him which I cannot help liking, and\r\nI think his character is _one_ which should be understood, and\r\nlooked upon for _once_ as it is. He is stern and severe--with fixed\r\nprinciples of _duty_ which _nothing_ on earth will make him change;\r\nvery _clever_ I do _not_ think him, and his mind is an uncivilised\r\none; his education has been neglected; politics and military concerns\r\nare the only things he takes great interest in; the arts and all\r\nsofter occupations he is insensible to, but he is sincere, I am\r\ncertain, _sincere_ even in his most despotic acts, from a sense that\r\nthat _is_ the _only_ way to govern; he is not, I am sure, aware of the\r\ndreadful cases of individual misery which he so often causes, for I\r\ncan see by various instances that he is kept in utter ignorance of\r\n_many_ things, which his people carry out in most corrupt ways, while\r\nhe thinks that he is extremely just. He thinks of general measures,\r\nbut does not look into detail. And I am sure _much_ never reaches\r\nhis ears, and (as you observed), how can it? He asked for _nothing_\r\nwhatever, has merely expressed his great anxiety to be upon the best\r\nterms with us, but _not_ to the _exclusion of others_, only let things\r\nremain as they are.... He is I should say, too frank, for he talks\r\nso openly before people, which he should not do, and with difficulty\r\nrestrains himself. His anxiety _to be believed_ is _very_ great, and\r\nI must say his personal promises I _am inclined_ to believe; then his\r\nfeelings are very strong; he _feels_ kindness deeply--and his love for\r\nhis wife and children, and for all children, is _very_ great. He has a\r\nstrong feeling for domestic life, saying to me, when our children were\r\nin the room: \"Voila les doux moments de notre vie.\" He was not only\r\ncivil, but extremely kind _to us both_, and spoke in the highest\r\npraise of dearest Albert to Sir Robert Peel, saying he wished any\r\nPrince in Germany had that ability and sense; he showed Albert great\r\nconfidence, and I _think_ it will do great good, as if _he_ praises\r\nhim abroad it will have great weight. He is _not_ happy, and that\r\nmelancholy which is visible in the countenance made me sad at times;\r\nthe sternness of the eyes goes very much off when you know him,\r\nand changes according to his being put out (and he _can_ be much\r\nembarrassed) or not, and also from his being heated, as he suffers\r\nwith congestions to the head. My Angel thinks that he is a man\r\ninclined too much to give way to impulse and feeling, which makes him\r\nact wrongly often. His admiration for beauty is very great, and put me\r\nmuch in mind of you, when he drove out with us, looking out for\r\npretty people. But he remains very faithful to those he admired\r\n_twenty-eight_ years ago; for instance, Lady Peel, who has hardly\r\nany remains left. Respecting Belgium he did not speak to _me_, but to\r\nAlbert and the Ministers. As for unkindly feeling towards _you_, he\r\ndisclaims positively any, saying he knew you well, and that you had\r\nserved in the Russian Army, etc., but he says those _unfortunate_\r\nPoles are the _only_ obstacle, and that he positively cannot\r\nenter into direct communication _with Belgium_ as long as they are\r\n_employed_. If you could only somehow or other get rid of them, I am\r\nsure the thing would be done at once. We all think he _need_ not\r\nmind this, but I fear he has pledged himself. He admired Charlotte's\r\npicture. _Pour finir_, I must say one more word or two about his\r\npersonal appearance. He puts us much in mind of his and our cousins\r\nthe Wuertembergs, and has altogether much of the Wuertemberg family\r\nabout him. He is bald now, but in his Chevalier Garde Uniform he is\r\n_magnificent_ still, and very _striking_. I cannot deny that we were\r\nin great anxiety when we took him out lest some Pole might make an\r\nattempt, and I always felt thankful when we got him safe home again.\r\nHis poor daughter is very ill, I fear. The good King of Saxony[18]\r\nremains another week with us, and we like him much. He is so\r\nunassuming. He is out sight-seeing _all_ day, and enchanted with\r\neverything. I hope that you will persuade the King to come all\r\nthe same in September. Our _motives_ and politics are _not_ to be\r\nexclusive, but to be on good terms with _all_, and why should we not?\r\nWe make no secret of it.\r\n\r\nNow I must end this very long letter. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nYou will kindly not _speak_ of these details, but only in _allgemein_\r\nsay the visit went off very satisfactorily on _both sides_, and that\r\nit was _highly pacific_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: In honour of the Emperor a Review was held in\r\n    Windsor Great Park.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: At Ascot.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Given by the Duke of Devonshire.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: See _ante_, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A PARLIAMENTARY CRISIS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING OF SAXONY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _18th June 1844._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the happiness of receiving your dear and kind\r\nletter of the 13th on Sunday; your _parties_ at Ardenne must have been\r\ntruly delightful; perhaps some day _we_ may enjoy them too: that would\r\nbe delightful! I can write to you with a light heart, thank goodness,\r\nto-day, for the Government obtained a majority, which _up_ to the\r\n_last_ moment last night we feared they would not have, and we have\r\nbeen in sad trouble for the last four or five days about it.[19] It\r\nis the more marvellous, as, if the Government asked for a _Vote_\r\nof Confidence, they would have a _Majority_ of 100; but this very\r\nstrength makes the supporters of the Government act in a _most_\r\nunjustifiable manner by continually acting and voting against them,\r\n_not_ listening to the debates, but coming down and voting against the\r\nGovernment. So that we were really in the greatest _possible_ danger\r\nof having a resignation of the Government _without knowing to whom to\r\nturn_, and this from the recklessness of a handful of foolish _half_\r\n\"Puseyite\" half \"Young England\"[20] people! I am sure you will agree\r\nwith me that Peel's resignation would not only be for us (for _we\r\ncannot_ have a better and a _safer_ Minister), but for the whole\r\ncountry, and for the peace of Europe--a _great calamity_. Our present\r\npeople are all _safe_, and not led away by impulses and reckless\r\npassions. We must, however, take care and not get into another crisis;\r\nfor I assure you we have been quite miserable and _quite_ alarmed ever\r\nsince Saturday.\r\n\r\nSince I last wrote to you, I spoke to Aberdeen (whom I should be\r\nequally sorry to lose, as he is so _very fair_, and has served _us\r\npersonally_, so kindly and truly), and he told me that the Emperor has\r\n_positively pledged_ himself to send a Minister to Brussels the moment\r\nthose Poles are no longer employed;[21] that he is quite aware of\r\nthe importance of the measure, and would be disposed to make the\r\narrangement easy, and that he spoke very kindly of _you_ personally.\r\nAberdeen says it is not necessary to disgrace them in any way, but\r\nonly for the present _de les eloigner_. The Emperor has evidently some\r\ntime ago made some strong declaration on the subject which he feels\r\nhe cannot get over, and, as I said before, he will not give up what he\r\nhas once pledged his word to. _Then, no one_ on earth _can_ move him.\r\n_Au fond_, it is a fine _trait_, but he carries it too far. He wrote\r\nme a _very_ kind and affectionate letter from the Hague. The Emperor\r\nhas given Bertie the Grand Cross of St Andrew, which the boy was quite\r\nproud of.\r\n\r\nOur kind and good King of Saxony leaves us to-morrow, after having\r\nseen more than anybody has done almost, and having enjoyed it of all\r\nthings. He is quite at home with us and the children, whom he plays\r\nwith much. Alice walks quite alone, and looks too funny, as she is so\r\n_very_ fat. Now, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: The Ministry had been defeated on Mr P.

Lord Melbourne was\r\nvery glad to have the opportunity of seeing the Emperor of Russia at\r\nChiswick. Lord Melbourne humbly believes that the opinion, which your\r\nMajesty has formed and expresses of the Emperor's character is just,\r\nand he considers it extremely fortunate that a sovereign of such\r\nweight and influence in Europe, and with whom it is probable that\r\nGreat Britain will have such near and intimate relations, should also\r\nbe a man upon whose honour and veracity strong reliance may be safely\r\nand securely placed.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is very glad to believe that the late political\r\nmovements, with which the public mind has been agitated, have\r\nsubsided, and are entirely terminated by the last vote of the House\r\nof Commons, and by the determination evinced to support the\r\nAdministration.[22]\r\n\r\nThis finishes for the present a business which at one moment seemed\r\nlikely to be troublesome, and out of which there did not appear to\r\npresent itself any hope or practicable escape.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will not make any observation upon what is known and\r\nunderstood to have passed, further than to say that, as far as he is\r\nacquainted with the history of public affairs in this country, it is\r\nan entire novelty, quite new and unprecedented.[23] Many a Minister\r\nhas said to the Crown, \"My advice must be taken, and my measures\r\nmust be adopted,\" but no Minister has ever yet held this language or\r\nadvanced this pretension to either House of Parliament. However, it\r\nseems to be successful at present, and success will justify much.\r\nWhether it will tend to permanent strength or a steady conduct of\r\npublic affairs, remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne begs to be respectfully remembered to His Royal\r\nHighness.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: See _ante_, p. 16.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Lord Melbourne refers to the House rescinding\r\n    its own vote.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ELLENBOROUGH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Ellenborough to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_22nd June 1844._\r\n\r\nLord Ellenborough, with his most humble duty to your Majesty, humbly\r\nacquaints your Majesty that on the 15th of June he received\r\nthe announcement of his having been removed from the office of\r\nGovernor-General of India by the Court of Directors. By Lord\r\nEllenborough's advice, letters were immediately despatched by express\r\nto every important native Court to assure the native Princes that this\r\nchange in the person at the head of the Government would effect no\r\nchange in its policy, and Lord Ellenborough himself wrote in similar\r\nterms to the British Representatives at the several Courts.... Lord\r\nEllenborough has written a letter to the Earl of Ripon with reference\r\nto the reasons alleged by the Court of Directors for his removal\r\nfrom office, to which letter he most humbly solicits your Majesty's\r\nfavourable and attentive consideration. It treats of matters deeply\r\naffecting the good government of India.\r\n\r\nAmidst all the difficulties with which he has had to contend in India,\r\naggravated as they have been by the constant hostility of the Court of\r\nDirectors, Lord Ellenborough has ever been sustained by the knowledge\r\nthat he was serving a most gracious Mistress, who would place the most\r\nfavourable construction upon his conduct, and he now humbly tenders to\r\nyour Majesty the expression of his gratitude, not only for those marks\r\nof Royal favour with which it has been intimated to him that it is\r\nyour Majesty's intention to reward his services, but yet more for that\r\nconstant support which has animated all his exertions, and has mainly\r\nenabled him to place India in the hands of his successor in a state\r\nof universal peace, the result of two years of victories, and in a\r\ncondition of prosperity heretofore unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _28th June 1844._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED VICTORIA,--I have again to offer my warmest and best thanks\r\nfor a very long and kind letter. I am truly and sincerely happy that\r\na Ministerial crisis has been spared you; it is in all constitutional\r\nconcerns an _awful_ business; but in such a colossal machinery as the\r\nBritish Empire, it shakes the whole globe. For your sake, for the\r\ngood of England, and for the quiet of the whole earth, we must most\r\ndevoutly pray that _Sir Robert may remain for many, many years your\r\ntrusty and faithful Minister._ Parliaments and Chambers are\r\nextremely fond of governing, particularly as long as it does not bore\r\nthemselves. We have had an instance of it recently. I was anxious\r\nto keep the Chamber longer, as there are still many important things\r\nwhich it ought to have finished; but they were hot, they got tired,\r\nvoted twelve _projets de loi_ in one day, and disappeared afterwards,\r\nleaving one the trouble of managing the affairs of the State as best\r\none may....\r\n\r\nAs a general political event, the Emperor's visit in England can only\r\nbe useful; it is probable that he would _not_ have made the visit if\r\nanother had not been talked of. His policy is naturally to _separate_\r\nas much as possible the two great Western Powers; he is too weak to\r\nresist single-handed their dictates in the Oriental question; _but if\r\nthey act not in concert_, it is evident that _he is the master_; in\r\nall this he acts wisely and in conformity with the great interests\r\nof his Empire. England has greater interests at stake at the mercy of\r\nRussia than at that of France. With France the questions are\r\nsometimes questions of jealousy, but, on the other hand, a tolerable\r\nunderstanding keeps France quiet and secures the peace of Europe, much\r\nmore in the sense of the European policy of England than of that of\r\nFrance. The only consolation the French can find in it is that they\r\nare aware that _together_ with England they have a great position,\r\nbut they always lament that they can _get nothing by it_. A bad\r\nunderstanding with France opens not only the door to a European war,\r\nbut also to revolution; and that is perhaps the most serious and most\r\nawfully dangerous part of the business. England wants nothing from the\r\nEmperor than that he should leave the _status quo_ of Europe and\r\ngreat part of Asia alone. At Paris they are not so much moved at the\r\nEmperor's visit as perhaps they ought to be, but they have put the\r\nflattering notion into their heads that he had made _fiasco_, which is\r\n_not true_; as, in fact, he has so far been rather _successful_, and\r\nhas convinced people in England that he is a mild and good-natured\r\nman, himself and his Empire, without any ambition. Now it is high time\r\nI should finish my immense scrawl, for which I claim your forgiveness,\r\nremaining ever your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: TAHITI]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _27th August 1844._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your kind long letter, which I\r\nreceived yesterday, dated 23rd.

The Tangiers Affair[26] is unfortunate, and I hope that\r\nin future poor Joinville will not be exposed to such disagreeable\r\naffairs. What _can_ be done will be, to get him justified in the eyes\r\nof the public here, but I fear that at first they will not be very\r\ncharitable.

I have not much to say about my\r\nfather's _lodging habits_ and _likings_.[29] My father is one of the\r\nbeings _most easy_ to _please_, _satisfy_, and to _accommodate_.\r\nHis eventful life has used him to everything, and makes any kind of\r\narrangements acceptable to him; there is only _one thing_ which\r\nhe _cannot easily do_, it is to be _ready very early_. He means\r\nnotwithstanding to try to come to your breakfast, but you _must insist\r\nupon his not doing it_. It would disturb him in all his habits, and be\r\nbad for him, as he would certainly eat, a thing he is not used to\r\ndo in the morning. He generally takes hardly what may be called a\r\n_breakfast_, and eats _only twice_ in the day. It would be also _much\r\nbetter_ for him if he only appeared to luncheon and dinner, and if you\r\nkindly dispensed him altogether of the breakfast. You must not tell\r\nhim that I wrote you _this_, but you must manage it with Montpensier,\r\nand kindly order for him a bowl of _chicken broth_. It is the only\r\nthing he takes generally in the morning, and between his meals. I\r\nhave also no observation to make, but I have told Montpensier to speak\r\nopenly to Albert whenever he thought something ought to be done for my\r\nfather, or might hurt and inconvenience him, and you may consult him\r\nwhen you are in doubt. He is entrusted with all the recommendations\r\nof my mother, for my father is naturally _so imprudent_ and _so little\r\naccustomed_ to _caution and care_, that he must in some measure be\r\n_watched_ to prevent his catching cold or doing what may be injurious\r\nto him. About his _rooms_, a hard bed and a large table for his papers\r\nare the only things he requires. He generally sleeps on a horse-hair\r\nmattress with a plank of wood under it: but _any kind_ of bed will do,\r\nif it is not _too soft_. His liking will be to be entirely at _your\r\ncommands_ and to do _all you like_. You know he can take a great deal\r\nof exercise, and _everything_ will _interest_ and _delight_ him, to\r\nsee, as to do: this is not a compliment, but a _mere fact_. His only\r\nwish is, that you should not go out of your way for him, and change\r\nyour habits on his account. Lord Aberdeen will be, of course, at\r\nWindsor, and I suppose you will ask, as you told me, the Royal Family.\r\nMy father hopes to see also Sir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, and your\r\nother Ministers. You will probably ask most of them during his stay.\r\nHe wishes very much to see again those he already knows, and to make\r\nthe acquaintance of those he does not know yet. In writing all this\r\nI think I _dream_, I _cannot believe_ yet that in a few days my dear\r\nfather will have, God willing, the _unspeakable happiness_ to see you\r\nagain and at _Windsor_, a thing he had _so much wished_ for and which\r\nfor a _long time_ seemed so _improbable_. You have _no notion_ of the\r\n_satisfaction_ it gives him, and _how delighted_ he will be to see you\r\nagain, and to be once more in England. God grant he may have a good\r\npassage, and arrive to you _safely_ and _well_. _Unberufen_, as you\r\nwill soon, I trust, be able to see, he is, notwithstanding the usual\r\ntalk of the papers, _perfectly well_....

I wrote to my mother, to quiet her,\r\nall you kindly tell me about my dear father. We are _quite sure_, I\r\nassure you, that you and Albert will _take care of him_, and that he\r\nis with you _in safe hand_. And what makes my mother _uneasy_ is the\r\nfear that, being at liberty without control, he will make _too much_,\r\nas she says, _le jeune homme_, ride, go about, and do everything as if\r\nhe was still twenty years old. If I must tell you _all the truth_, she\r\nis afraid also he will _eat too much_. I am sure he will tell it to\r\nyou himself, as he was so much amused with _this fear_; but to do her\r\npleasure, being well assured by me that you would allow it, and that\r\nit was even _customary_, he has given up, of himself, all thought of\r\nattending your early breakfast: but I perceive I write as if _he was\r\nnot already_ under _your_ roof. I will also only say, that though he\r\nhas sent over his horses in case they should be wanted, my mother\r\nbegs you to _prevent, if possible, his riding at all_. I wrote to her\r\nalready that I supposed there would be _no occasion_ for riding,\r\nand that your _promenades_ would be either on foot or in carriage.\r\nI entrusted Montpensier with all my messages for you, my beloved\r\nVictoria and your dear children. He hopes you will permit him, during\r\nhis stay at Windsor, to make _two_ excursions--one to London, and one\r\nto Woolwich--he is very curious to see, as an artillery officer. I\r\nmention it as he would be, perhaps, _too shy_ or _too discreet_ to\r\nmention it himself. He might very well do those two trips by the\r\nrailroad and be back for dinner-time, and I am sure you will have no\r\nobjection to them.... Yours most devotedly,\r\n\r\nLOUISE.\r\n\r\nI am very glad that Lord Charles Wellesley is one of those who will\r\nattend my father. Montpensier and him will have surely capital fun\r\ntogether, and he was, you know, a great favourite with every one at\r\nEu.

But he perfectly understands the\r\nreasons which prevented your Majesty from writing during your stay in\r\nthe Highlands. Lord Melbourne is very glad to find that your Majesty\r\nenjoyed that country so much, and is so enthusiastically fond of it.\r\nLord Melbourne believes that he was at the places which your Majesty\r\nmentions. In the year 1802 he stayed some months in Perthshire with\r\nthe late Lord Kinnaird, and enjoyed it much. It annoys him sometimes\r\nto think how altered he is in strength since that time. Lord Melbourne\r\nhas never yet thanked your Majesty for the pretty etchings of poor\r\nIslay and Eos, which your Majesty sent to Lord Melbourne when he was\r\nlast at Windsor. Lord Melbourne has ordered them both to be framed,\r\nand will hang them up in his room here. They will afford Lord\r\nMelbourne most agreeable and pleasing souvenirs of the happiest period\r\nof his life, for he cannot say otherwise than that he continually\r\nmisses and regrets the time when he had daily confidential\r\ncommunication with your Majesty. Lord Glenlyon[30] has one merit\r\nin Lord Melbourne's eyes, which is that he was a steady and firm\r\nsupporter to the last of Lord Melbourne's Government. Lord Melbourne\r\nhopes and trusts that he feels no animosity against those who opposed\r\nhim. But he does and always shall entertain a kindly and grateful\r\nrecollection of those who supported him.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne begs to be remembered to His Royal Highness.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: _See_ vol. i. p. 429.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _12th October 1844._\r\n\r\nMY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--...

The dear King's visit went off to\r\nperfection, and I much and deeply regret its being passed. He was\r\n_delighted_, and was _most_ enthusiastically and affectionately\r\nreceived wherever he showed himself. Our proceedings I wrote to good,\r\ndear Louise (whom you should not leave so long alone), who will no\r\ndoubt have given you the details. What an extraordinary man the King\r\nis! What a wonderful memory, and how lively, _how sagacious!_He spoke\r\nvery openly to us all, and is determined that our affairs should go on\r\nwell. He wishes Tahiti _au fond de la mer_. He spoke also very openly\r\nabout poor Hadjy's _brochure_ which seems to have distressed him more\r\nthan anything. The King praised my dearest Albert most highly, and\r\nfully appreciates his great qualities and talents--and what gratifies\r\nme _so much_, treats him completely as his equal, calling him \"Mon\r\nFrere,\" and saying to me that _my husband_ was the same as me, which\r\nit is--and \"Le Prince Albert, c'est pour moi le Roi.\" The King is\r\n_very_ sad to go, but he is determined, he says, _to see me every\r\nyear_. Another _very_ great thing is, that the officers of the two\r\nNavies staying at Portsmouth were on the best terms together and\r\npaying one another every sort of compliment. As Admiral La Susse (a\r\nvery gentlemanlike man) and his squadron were sadly disappointed on\r\nMonday,[31] we thought it would please them if we went on board the\r\n_Gomer_, which we did, on Tuesday morning, and breakfasted there, and\r\nI drank the King's health. I am certain that the visit and everything\r\nconnected with it can but do the _greatest good_.\r\n\r\nWe stay here till Monday. It is a very comfortable little house, and\r\nthe grounds and place are delightful, so private--and the view so\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude, begging you to believe me, ever your devoted\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say how much we liked good Montpensier, who got on\r\nextremely well.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: It had been intended that the King should return\r\n    to France, as he had come, by way of Portsmouth, crossing in\r\n    the frigate _Gomer_, but, in consequence of the wet and stormy\r\n    weather, he returned by Dover and Calais.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEPARTURE OF THE KING]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the French._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE HOUSE, _le 17 Octobre 1844._\r\n\r\nSIRE, ET MON TRES CHER FRERE,--Votre Majeste m'a ecrit deux bien\r\nbonnes lettres de Douvres pour lesquelles je vous remercie de tout mon\r\nc[oe]ur.

It was a fine and\r\ngratifying sight to see the myriads of people assembled--more than at\r\nthe Coronation even, and all in such good humour, and so loyal; the\r\narticles in the papers, too, are most kind and gratifying; they say\r\n_no_ Sovereign _was more_ loved than I am (I am bold enough to say),\r\nand _that_, from our _happy domestic home_--which gives such a good\r\nexample. The _Times_ you have, and I venture to add a _Chronicle_,\r\nas I think it very pretty; you should read the accounts. _I_ seldom\r\nremember being so gratified and pleased with any public show, and my\r\nbeloved Albert was so enthusiastically received by the people. He\r\nis _so_ beloved by all the really influential people, and by _all_\r\nright-thinking ones. We came back here yesterday evening. The accounts\r\nfrom Paris are excellent too.

The\r\nliterature of the West is the most favourite study amongst the Hindoos\r\nin their schools and colleges. They will discuss with accuracy the\r\nmost important events in British History. Boys of fifteen years of\r\nage, black in colour, will recite the most favourite passages\r\nfrom Shakespeare, ably quoting the notes of the English and German\r\ncommentators. They excel in mathematics, and in legal subtleties their\r\nacuteness is most extraordinary.\r\n\r\nIn order to reward native talent and render it practically useful to\r\nthe State, Sir Henry Hardinge, after due deliberation, has issued a\r\nresolution, by which the most meritorious students will be appointed\r\nto fill the public offices which fall vacant throughout Bengal.\r\n\r\nThis encouragement has been received by the Hindoo population with the\r\ngreatest gratitude. The studies in the Mohammedan schools and colleges\r\nhave hitherto been confined to Arabic, the Koran, and abstruse studies\r\nrelating to their religion, having always shown a marked aversion to\r\nEnglish literature. Since the publication of the Resolution they have\r\nat once determined to change their system in order to participate in\r\nthe benefits held out to native merit of every sect.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible throughout your Majesty's immense Empire to employ\r\nthe number of highly paid European civil servants which the public\r\nservice requires. This deficiency is the great evil of British\r\nAdministration. By dispersing annually a proportion of well-educated\r\nnatives throughout the provinces, under British superintendence,\r\nwell-founded hopes are entertained that prejudices may gradually\r\ndisappear, the public service be improved, and attachment to British\r\ninstitutions increased....\r\n\r\nSir Henry Hardinge, in closing these observations, most humbly\r\nventures to assure your Majesty that he anticipates no occurrence as\r\nprobable, by which the tranquillity of this portion of your Majesty's\r\ndominions is likely to be disturbed.\r\n\r\nH. HARDINGE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: Governor-General of India, in succession to Lord\r\n    Ellenborough.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new year (1845) opened auspiciously, trade improving owing to the\r\ngreat impetus given to it by the many lines of railway then in\r\ncourse of promotion. Over two hundred schemes were prepared at\r\nthe commencement of the session to seek legislative sanction, and\r\nspeculation outran all reasonable limits. The Income Tax (which in the\r\nordinary course would have expired) was renewed, and the Anti-Corn\r\nLaw Leaguers were more persistent than ever in their assaults on\r\nProtection, while the attacks on the Ministry from a section of their\r\nown party were redoubled. The most remarkable measure of the year was\r\nthe Government Bill for increasing the grant to the Roman Catholic\r\nCollege of Maynooth, which was strongly opposed from the Conservative\r\nand the Protestant points of view; Mr Gladstone, though he approved of\r\nthe measure, retired from the Ministry, as he had a few years before\r\nwritten in the opposite sense. Towards the close of the year the\r\ncondition of Ireland, owing to the failure of the potato crop, became\r\nvery alarming, and the Ministry greatly embarrassed. Lord John Russell\r\nwrote from Edinburgh to the electors of the City of London, announcing\r\nhis conversion to the Repeal of the Corn Laws, and the _Times_\r\nannounced that such a Bill would be brought in by the Ministry. Peel,\r\nreluctant to accept the task, resigned office in December, and a Whig\r\nMinistry was attempted. Owing to dissensions, the attempt had to be\r\nabandoned, and Peel returned to office, without Lord Stanley, but\r\nwith Mr Gladstone, who however did not seek re-election for the seat\r\nvacated by his acceptance of office.\r\n\r\nA dispute of great importance arose during the year with the United\r\nStates, relating to the boundary line between English and American\r\nterritory west of the Rocky Mountains. Twenty-five years earlier the\r\nsame question had arisen, and had been settled on the footing of joint\r\noccupancy. The increased importance of the Pacific slope made the\r\nmatter more vital, involving as it did the ownership of Vancouver\r\nIsland and the mouth of the Columbia River; President Polk\r\nunequivocally claimed the whole, and said he would not shrink from\r\nupholding America's interests; the British Government was equally\r\nfirm, and the matter was not adjusted till 1846.\r\n\r\nIn India, which during nearly the whole year enjoyed peace, the Sikhs\r\nin December assumed the aggressive, and crossed the Sutlej, invading\r\nBritish India. They were signally defeated by Sir Hugh Gough at\r\nMoodkee and Ferozeshah. In Scinde Sir Charles Napier prosecuted\r\noperations against the mountain desert tribes.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand some disastrous collisions took place between the\r\nnatives and the settlers; the former on two occasions either defeating\r\nor repulsing the British arms.\r\n\r\nIn France the most important events were the Bill for fortifying\r\nParis, the campaign waged against Abd-el-Kader in Algeria, and\r\na horrible act of cruelty perpetrated there. In Spain Don Carlos\r\nabdicated his claims to the throne in favour of his son; the Queen's\r\nengagement to Count Trapani was rumoured. In other parts of Europe\r\nlittle that was eventful occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n1845\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _14th January 1845._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--What you say about Aquila[1] and Montpensier\r\ninterests me. What madness is it then to force Trapani on Spain! Pray\r\nexplain to me the cause of the King's obstinacy about that Spanish\r\nmarriage, for _no_ country has a right to dictate in that way to\r\nanother. If Tatane[2] was _to think_ of the Infanta, England would be\r\nextremely indignant, and would (and with right) consider it tantamount\r\nto a marriage with the Queen herself. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Louis Charles, Comte d'Aquila, a son of Francis\r\n    I., King of the Two Sicilies, and brother of the Comte de\r\n    Trapani and of Queen Christina; he and his brother were\r\n    therefore uncles of Queen Isabella.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: The Duc de Montpensier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _18th January 1845._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... The Spanish marriage question is really very\r\ncurious; in fact, all the other Bourbon branches are hostile to the\r\nOrleans family, but the idea that makes the King so constant in his\r\nviews about it, is that he imagines it would create in France a bad\r\nimpression if _now_ any other than a Bourbon was to marry the Queen of\r\nSpain. That feeling they have _themselves created_, as in France\r\nthey did not at all care about it; having, however, declared _quasi_\r\nofficially in the French Chambers that they _will not have any but\r\na Bourbon_, if circumstances should after all decide it otherwise it\r\nwould now be a defeat, but certainly one of their own making....

I mention merely a trifling instance to show\r\n_how_ respectful they are--the Duke of Buckingham, who is immensely\r\nproud, bringing the cup of coffee after dinner on a waiter to Albert\r\nhimself. And everywhere my dearest Angel receives the respect and\r\nhonours I receive.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for returning the list;[3] it was not Albert but _Tatane_\r\nwho made the black crosses.

Sir Robert is acquainted with the state of\r\nthe Palace and the total want of accommodation for our little family,\r\nwhich is fast growing up. Any building must necessarily take some\r\nyears before it can be safely inhabited. If it were to be begun this\r\nautumn, it could hardly be occupied before the spring of 1848, when\r\nthe Prince of Wales would be nearly seven, and the Princess Royal\r\nnearly eight years old, and they cannot possibly be kept in the\r\nnursery any longer. A provision for this purpose ought, therefore, to\r\nbe made this year. Independent of this, most parts of the Palace are\r\nin a sad state, and will ere long require a further outlay to render\r\nthem _decent_ for the occupation of the Royal Family or any visitors\r\nthe Queen may have to receive. A room, capable of containing a larger\r\nnumber of those persons whom the Queen has to invite in the course\r\nof the season to balls, concerts, etc., than any of the present\r\napartments can at once hold, is much wanted. Equally so, improved\r\noffices and servants' rooms, the want of which puts the departments\r\nof the household to great expense yearly. It will be for Sir Robert to\r\nconsider whether it would not be best to remedy all these deficiencies\r\nat once, and to make use of this opportunity to render the exterior of\r\nthe Palace such as no longer to be a _disgrace_ to the country, which\r\nit certainly now is. The Queen thinks the country would be better\r\npleased to have the question of the Sovereign's residence in London\r\nso finally disposed of, than to have it so repeatedly brought before\r\nit.[4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Peel replied that, as a renewal of the Income Tax\r\n    was about to be proposed, it would be better to postpone the\r\n    application to Parliament till the public feeling as to the\r\n    tax had been ascertained.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[PAGEHEADING: TITLE OF KING CONSORT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nPAVILION, _18th February 1845._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Sir Robert Peel's letter, and is glad that the\r\nprogress in the House of Commons was so satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was much hurt at Mr Borthwick's most impertinent manner of\r\nputting the question with respect to the title of King Consort, and\r\nmuch satisfied with Sir Robert's answer.[5] The title of King is\r\nopen assuredly to many difficulties, and would perhaps be no _real_\r\nadvantage to the Prince, but the Queen is positive that something must\r\nat once be done to place the Prince's position on a constitutionally\r\nrecognised footing, and to give him a title adequate to that\r\nposition.[6] _How_ and _when_, are difficult questions....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: A paragraph had appeared in the _Morning\r\n    Chronicle_, giving credence to a rumour that this title was\r\n    about to be conferred on the Prince, but, in answer to Mr\r\n    Peter Borthwick, Sir Robert Peel positively contradicted it.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6:\r\n\r\n    _Sir Robert Peel to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\n    WHITEHALL, _15th February 1845._\r\n\r\n    SIR,--I received yesterday the accompanying note from Mr\r\n    Borthwick, and in conformity with the notice therein given,\r\n    he put the question to me in the House of Commons last evening\r\n    respecting the paragraph which appeared in the _Morning\r\n    Chronicle_ respecting the intention of proposing to Parliament\r\n    that your Royal Highness should assume the title of King\r\n    Consort.\r\n\r\n    I very much regret that the _Morning Chronicle_ inserted that\r\n    paragraph.\r\n\r\n    The prominent place assigned to it in the newspaper, and a\r\n    vague intimation that there was some authority for it, have\r\n    caused a certain degree of credit to be attached to it. It has\r\n    been copied into all the country newspapers and has given rise\r\n    to a good deal of conjecture and speculation, which it is far\r\n    from desirable to excite without necessity.\r\n\r\n    It appears to me that the editor of the _Morning Chronicle_\r\n    acted most unwarrantably in inserting such a paragraph with a\r\n    pretence of some sort of authority for it.\r\n\r\n    It has produced an impression which strongly confirms the\r\n    observations which I took the liberty of making to your Royal\r\n    Highness on Sunday evening.\r\n\r\n    I trust, however, that my decided contradiction of the\r\n    paragraph will put a stop to further surmise and discussion on\r\n    the subject.\r\n\r\n    To Mr Borthwick's note I add one of several letters\r\n    addressed to me, which shows the proneness to speculate upon\r\n    constitutional novelties.\r\n\r\n    I have the honour to be, Sir, with sincere respect, your Royal\r\n    Highness's most faithful and obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n    ROBERT PEEL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th March 1845._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Sir Robert Peel's box containing his\r\nrecommendation relative to the filling up of the vacant Bishopric of\r\nEly. The Queen quite approves of the present Dean of Westminster[7]\r\nas the new Bishop. As Sir Robert has asked the Queen whether she\r\nwould like to see Archdeacon Wilberforce succeed to the Deanery of\r\nWestminster in case the Dean should accept the Bishopric, she must say\r\nthat such an arrangement would be _very satisfactory_ to us, and the\r\nQueen believes would highly please the Archdeacon. This would again\r\nvacate, the Queen believes, a stall at Winchester, which she would\r\nlike to see filled by a person decidedly adverse to Puseyism.\r\n\r\nThe Queen approves of the Bishop of Lichfield[8] being transferred to\r\nthe See of Ely in case Doctor Turton should decline it.\r\n\r\nIt would give the Queen much pleasure to stand sponsor to Sir Robert\r\nPeel's little grandson, and perhaps Sir Robert would communicate this\r\nto Lady Villiers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Dr Thomas Turton (1780-1864), formerly Dean of\r\n    Peterborough.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: John Lonsdale (1788-1867) was Bishop of Lichfield\r\n    from 1843 till his death.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PURCHASE OF OSBORNE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _25th March 1845._\r\n\r\n... I copied what you wrote me about Peel[9] in a letter I wrote him,\r\nwhich I am sure will please him much, and a Minister in these days\r\n_does_ require a little encouragement, for the abuse and difficulties\r\nthey have to contend with are dreadful.

He is\r\ndisposed to think that the sentence might be carried into execution in\r\nthe presence of a Jury to be summoned by the Sheriff with good effect;\r\nand that the great body of idle spectators might be excluded, without\r\ndiminishing the salutary terror and awful warning which this extreme\r\npunishment is intended to produce on the public mind.

I\r\nneed not dwell on my sentiments of devotion to you; they began with\r\n_your life, and will only end with mine_. The only claim I make is to\r\nbe remembered with some little affection. Thank heaven, I have little\r\nto wish you, than that your present happiness may not be disturbed,\r\nand that those who are dear to you may be preserved for your\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nMy gift is Charlotte's portrait. The face is extremely like, and the\r\nlikest that exists; the hair is a little too fair, it had become\r\nalso darker. I take this opportunity to repeat that Charlotte was a\r\nnoble-minded and highly gifted creature. She was nervous, as all\r\nthe family have been; she could be violent, but then she was full\r\nof repentance for it, and her disposition _highly generous_ and\r\n_susceptible_ of _great devotion_.\r\n\r\nI am the more bound to say this, as I understood that you had some\r\nnotion that she had been _very imperious_, and not mistress of her\r\ntemper. Before her marriage some people by dint of flattery had tried\r\nto give her masculine tastes; and in short had pushed her to become\r\none day a sort of Queen Elizabeth. These sentiments were already\r\na little modified before her marriage. But she was particularly\r\ndetermined to be a _good_ and _obedient_ wife; some of her friends\r\nwere anxious she should _not_; amongst these Madame de Flahaut must be\r\nmentioned _en premiere ligne_.\r\n\r\nThis became even a subject which severed the intimacy between them.\r\nMadame de Flahaut, much older than Charlotte, and of a sour and\r\ndetermined character, had gained an influence which partook on\r\nCharlotte's part a little of fear. She was afraid of her, but when\r\nonce supported took courage.\r\n\r\nPeople were much struck on the 2nd of May 1816 at Carlton House with\r\nthe clearness and firmness with which she pronounced \"_and obey_,\"\r\netc., as there had been a _general belief_ that it would be _for the\r\nhusband_ to give _these promises_. The Regent put me particularly on\r\nmy guard, and said, \"If you don't resist she will govern you with a\r\nhigh hand.\" Your own experience has convinced you that real affection\r\nchanges many sentiments that may have been implanted into the mind of\r\na young girl. With Charlotte it was the more meritorious, as from a\r\nvery early period of her life she was considered as the heiress of the\r\nCrown; the Whigs flattered her extremely, and later, when she got by\r\nmy intervention reconciled to the Tories, they also made great efforts\r\nto please her.\r\n\r\nHer understanding was extremely good; she knew everybody, and I even\r\nafterwards found her judgment generally extremely correct. _She had\r\nread a great deal and knew well what she had read._ Generous she was\r\nalmost _too much_, and her _devotion_ was quite affecting, from a\r\ncharacter so much pushed to be selfish and imperious.\r\n\r\nI will here end my souvenir of poor dear Charlotte, but I thought\r\nthat the subject could not but be interesting to you. Her constancy in\r\nwishing to marry me, which she maintained under difficulties of every\r\ndescription, has been the foundation of all that touched the family\r\nafterwards. You know, I believe, that your poor father was the chief\r\npromoter, though also the Yorks were; but our correspondence from 1814\r\ntill 1816 was entirely carried on through his kind intervention; it\r\nwould otherwise have been impossible, as she was really treated as a\r\nsort of prisoner. Grant always to that good and generous Charlotte,\r\nwho sleeps already with her beautiful little boy so long, where all\r\nwill go to, an affectionate remembrance, and believe me she deserves\r\nit.\r\n\r\nForgive my long letter, and see in it, what it really is, a token of\r\nthe great affection I have for you. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your\r\ndevoted Uncle.\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th June 1845._\r\n\r\nThe Queen understands that the Deanery of Worcester has become vacant\r\nby some new arrangement.

We took him a sail in the\r\n_Victoria and Albert_ on Saturday, which he admired amazingly, and\r\nafter luncheon he went away, Albert taking him over to Gosport. He\r\nintends, I believe, to come here one morning for luncheon to take\r\nleave. He is grown old, and has lost all his front teeth, but he is as\r\ntalkative and lively as he used to be, and seems very happy to be in\r\nEngland again. He was very anxious that we should pay him a visit this\r\nyear, but was quite satisfied when we told him that this year it was\r\nimpossible, but that we hoped some other time to do so. He was much\r\nstruck at seeing me now independent and unembarrassed, and talking;\r\nas when he was here in 1836[19] I was extremely crushed and kept\r\nunder and hardly dared say a word, so that he was quite astonished.\r\nHe thought me grown.

The Queen is extremely\r\nsorry to leave England without seeing Lord Melbourne, and without\r\nhaving seen him all this season; but something or other always\r\nprevented us from seeing Lord Melbourne each time we hoped to do so.\r\nWe only return the night before the Prorogation and embark that same\r\nday.

The King\r\ncame off to the yacht, and took the Queen in his barge to land. I need\r\nnot say how joyfully she was received by all the Royal Family.\r\n\r\nAlthough I shall have opportunities, both this evening and to-morrow\r\nmorning, of speaking again with the King and Guizot, I have already\r\ndiscussed several subjects with each of them; and as the Queen\r\nparticularly desires to send a messenger this evening, I will give you\r\nsome notion of what has passed between us.\r\n\r\nI think the marriage of the Queen of Spain is the subject on which the\r\ngreatest interest is felt at this moment. It was the first introduced,\r\nboth by the King and Guizot, and treated by both in the same manner.\r\nThey said, that having promised to support the King of Naples, they\r\nwere bound not to abandon the Count de Trapani, so long as there was a\r\nchance of his being successful in his suit. I said in answer to\r\ntheir desire, that we would assist this arrangement, that we had no\r\nobjection to Count Trapani, and that we would take no part against\r\nhim; but unless it should be the decided wish of the Spanish\r\nGovernment and people, we could give no support to the marriage, as we\r\nwere honestly of opinion that it was not desired in Spain, and that\r\nwe saw nothing in the proposal to call for our support under these\r\ncircumstances. Both the King and Guizot said they had no objection to\r\nthe Duke of Saville[23] (Don Enrique), and that if it should be found\r\nthat Count Trapani was impossible, they would willingly support him.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Infanta, they both declared in the most positive\r\nand explicit manner, that _until the Queen was married and had\r\nchildren_, they should consider the Infanta precisely as her sister,\r\nand that any marriage with a French Prince would be entirely out of\r\nthe question. The King said he did not wish that his son should have\r\nthe prospect of being on the throne of Spain; but that if the Queen\r\nhad children, by whom the succession would be secured, he did not\r\nengage to preclude himself from the possibility of profiting by the\r\ngreat inheritance which the Infanta would bring his son. All this,\r\nhowever, was uncertain, and would require time at all events to\r\naccomplish; for I distinctly understood, that it was not only a\r\nmarriage and a child, but _children, that were necessary to secure the\r\nsuccession_.\r\n\r\nI thought this was as much as we could desire at present, and that the\r\npolicy of a marriage with a French Prince might safely be left to be\r\nconsidered whenever the contingency contemplated should arrive. Many\r\nthings may happen, both in France and Spain, in the course of a few\r\nyears to affect this question in a manner not now apparent.\r\n\r\nABERDEEN.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: Parliament was prorogued on the 9th of August,\r\n    and the Queen and Prince sailed in the evening for Antwerp\r\n    in the Royal yacht.

On the morning\r\n    of the 8th of September the yacht, which had left the Scheldt\r\n    on the previous evening, arrived at Treport, and a second\r\n    visit was paid to the King and Queen of the French at the\r\n    Chateau d'Eu.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Younger son of Don Francisco de Paula, and first\r\n    cousin to Queen Isabella, both through his father and his\r\n    mother.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CHURCH APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _15th September 1845._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave to\r\nacquaint your Majesty that there remains the sum of L700 to be applied\r\nin the current year to the grant of Civil List Pensions.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel humbly recommends to your Majesty that another sum\r\nof L200 should be offered to Mr Tennyson, a poet of whose powers of\r\nimagination and expression many competent judges think most highly.\r\n\r\nHe was brought under the notice of Sir Robert Peel by Mr Hallam.

All you say about our dear Albert, whom\r\nI love like my own child, is perfectly true. The attacks, however\r\nunjust, have but one advantage, that of showing the points the enemy\r\nthinks _weakest_ and best calculated to hurt. This, being the case,\r\nAnson, without boring A. with _daily_ accounts which in the end\r\nbecome very irksome, should pay attention to these very points, and\r\ncontribute to avoid what may be turned to account by the enemy.\r\nTo hope to _escape_ censure and calumny is next to impossible, but\r\nwhatever is considered by the enemy as a fit subject for attack is\r\nbetter modified or avoided. The dealings with artists, for instance,\r\nrequire great prudence; they are acquainted with all classes of\r\nsociety, and for that very reason dangerous; they are hardly _ever\r\nsatisfied_, and when you have too much to do with them, you are sure\r\nto have _des ennuis_.... Your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD METCALFE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _2nd November 1845._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has read with great concern Lord Stanley's letter of the\r\n1st November. From private information she had been led to expect that\r\nLord Metcalfe would not be able to continue at his irksome post.[26]\r\nHe will be an immense loss, and the selection of a successor will be\r\nmost difficult. The Queen hopes that there will not be too great a\r\ndelay in making the new appointment, as experience has shown that\r\nnothing was more detrimental to the good government of Canada than the\r\nlast interregnum after Sir Charles Bagot's death; it would certainly\r\nlikewise be desirable that Lord Metcalfe should be able personally\r\nto make over his Government to his successor, whom he could verbally\r\nbetter put in possession of the peculiarities of his position than\r\nany instructions could do. It strikes the Queen to be of the _greatest\r\nimportance_, that the judicious system pursued by Lord Metcalfe (and\r\nwhich, after a long continuation of toil and adversities, only\r\nnow just begins to show its effect) should be followed up by his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nThe Queen knows nobody who would be as fit for the appointment as Lord\r\nElgin, who seems to have given great satisfaction in Jamaica, where he\r\nhas already succeeded Lord Metcalfe, whose original appointment there\r\nhad _likewise_ taken place under circumstances of great difficulty,\r\nwhich his prudence and firmness finally overcame.[27]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: He retired from the Governor-Generalship of\r\n    Canada through ill-health.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: Lord Stanley, in reply, submitted a private\r\n    letter from Lord Elgin, expressing a wish to return home; Earl\r\n    Cathcart was provisionally appointed Governor-General.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _28th November 1845._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is very sorry to hear that Sir Robert Peel apprehends\r\nfurther differences of opinion in the Cabinet, at a moment of\r\nimpending calamity; it is more than ever necessary that the Government\r\nshould be strong and united.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks the time is come when a removal of the restrictions\r\nupon the importation of food cannot be successfully resisted. Should\r\nthis be Sir Robert's own opinion, the Queen very much hopes that none\r\nof his colleagues will prevent him from doing what it is _right_ to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CORN LAWS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _4th December 1845._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave\r\nto acquaint your Majesty that a leading paragraph in the _Times_ of\r\nto-day, asserting that your Majesty's servants had unanimously agreed\r\nto an immediate and total repeal of the Corn Laws, is quite without\r\nfoundation.[28]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: See _Memoirs of the Life of Henry Reeve_, vol.\r\n    i. p. 175, for Lord Dufferin's refutation of the story that\r\n    Sidney Herbert confided the secret to Mrs Norton, and that she\r\n    sold it to the _Times_.

Yesterday Sir Robert Peel arrived here and explained\r\nthe condition of affairs.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: From Sir Robert Peel, 5th December, _ante._]\r\n\r\nOn 1st November he had called his Cabinet, and placed before its\r\nmembers the reports of the Irish Commissioners, Dr Buckland, Dr\r\nPlayfair and Dr Lindley, on the condition of the potato crop, which\r\nwas to the effect that the half of the potatoes were ruined by the\r\nrot, and that no one could guarantee the remainder. Belgium, Holland,\r\nSweden, and Denmark, in which states the potato disease had likewise\r\ndeprived the poorer class of its usual food, have immediately taken\r\nenergetic means, and have opened the harbours, bought corn, and\r\nprovided for the case of a rise of prices. Sir Robert proposed the\r\nsame thing for England, and, by opening the ports, a preparation for\r\nthe abolition of the Corn Laws. His colleagues refused, and of the\r\nwhole Cabinet only Lord Aberdeen, Sir James Graham, and Mr Sidney\r\nHerbert voted with him. Sir Robert hoped that in time the opinions of\r\nthe others would change, and therefore postponed a final decision.\r\nIn the meanwhile the agitation of the Anti-Corn Law League began;\r\nin every town addresses were voted, meetings were held, the\r\n_Times_--barometer of public feeling--became suddenly _violently_\r\nAnti-Corn Law, the meetings of the Cabinet roused attention, a general\r\npanic seized on the mass of the public. Sir Robert called anew his\r\nCabinet. In the midst of their deliberation Lord John Russell issues\r\nfrom Edinburgh an address to the City of London.[31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Declaring for the Repeal of the Corn Laws.]\r\n\r\nThe whole country cries out: the Corn Laws are doomed.\r\n\r\nThereon Sir Robert declared to his Cabinet that nothing but unanimity\r\ncould save the cause, and pressed for a decision.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buccleuch and Lord Stanley declared they could not take a\r\npart in a measure abolishing the Corn Laws, and would therefore have\r\nto resign. The other members, including the Duke of Wellington, showed\r\nthemselves ready to support Sir Robert, yet, as the latter says,\r\n\"apparently not willingly and against their feelings.\" Thereupon Sir\r\nRobert resolved to lay down his office as Minister.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived here he was visibly much moved, and said to me, that\r\nit was one of the most painful moments of his life to separate himself\r\nfrom us, \"but it is necessary, and if I have erred it was from loyalty\r\nand too great an anxiety not to leave Her Majesty in a moment of such\r\ngreat difficulty. I ought to have gone when I was first left by my\r\ncolleagues in a minority in my own Cabinet. I was anxious, however, to\r\ntry my utmost, but it is impossible to retrieve lost time. As soon as\r\nI saw Lord John's letter I felt that the ground was slipping away\r\nfrom under me, and that whatever I might now propose would appear as\r\ndictated by the Opposition, as taking Lord John's measure. On the 1st\r\nof November the whole country was prepared for the thing; there had\r\nbeen no agitation, everybody looking to the Government, as soon as\r\nthey saw this wavering and hesitating, the country decided for itself,\r\nand Lord John has the merit, owing to his most dexterous move and our\r\nwant of unanimity.\"\r\n\r\nOn my observing that Sir Robert has a majority of one hundred in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and asking whether it was not possible for him to\r\ncontinue the Government, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Buccleuch will carry half Scotland with him, and Lord\r\nStanley, leading the Protectionists in the House of Lords, would lead\r\nto great and immediate defections even in Her Majesty's household. The\r\nDuchess of Buccleuch, Lord Hardwicke, Lord Exeter, Lord Rivers,\r\nLord Beverley, etc., would resign, and we should not be able to find\r\nsuccessors; in the House of Commons I am sure I should be beat, the\r\nTories, agriculturists, etc., in rage would turn round upon me and\r\nbe joined by the Whigs and Radicals, who would say, 'This is _our_\r\nmeasure and we will not allow you to carry it.' It is better that\r\nI should go now, when _nobody has committed himself_ in the heat\r\nof party contest, when no factions have been formed, no imprudent\r\ndeclarations been made; it is better for Her Majesty and for the\r\ncountry that it should be so.\"\r\n\r\nAfter we had examined what possibilities were open for the Crown, the\r\nconclusion was come to that Lord John was the only man who could be\r\ncharged with forming a Cabinet. Lord Stanley, with the aristocracy as\r\nhis base, would bring about an insurrection [or riots], and the ground\r\non which one would have to fight would be this: to want to force the\r\nmass of the people, amidst their great poverty, to pay for their bread\r\na high price, in favour of the landlords.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of the utmost importance not to place the House of\r\nLords into direct antagonism with the Commons and with the masses of\r\nthe people. Sir Robert says very correctly:--\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid of other interests getting damaged in the struggle about\r\nthe Corn Laws; already the system of promotion in the Army, the Game\r\nLaws, the Church, are getting attacked with the aid of the league.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Victoria had in consequence [of the foregoing] decided in favour\r\nof Lord John, and asked Sir Robert: \"But how is it possible for him\r\nto govern with so exceedingly small a minority?\" Sir Robert said: \"He\r\nwill have difficulties and perhaps did not consider what he was doing\r\nwhen he wrote that letter; but _I will support him_. I feel it my duty\r\nto your Majesty not to leave you without a Government. Even if Lord\r\nJohn goes to the full extent of his declaration in that letter (which\r\nI think goes too far), I will support him in Parliament and use all\r\nmy influence with the House of Lords to prevent their impeding his\r\nprogress. I will do more, if he likes it. I will say that the increase\r\nof the estimates which will become necessary are my work, and I alone\r\nam responsible for it.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert intends to give me a memorandum in which he is to make this\r\npromise in writing.\r\n\r\nHe was greatly moved, and said it was not \"the loss of power (for I\r\nhate power) nor of office,\" which was nothing but a plague for him,\r\nbut \"the breaking up of those relations in which he stood to the Queen\r\nand me, and the loss of our society,\" which was for him a loss, for\r\nwhich there was no equivalent; we might, however, rely on his being\r\nalways ready to serve us, in what manner and in what place it might\r\nbe. Lord Aberdeen is said to feel the same, and very deeply so; and on\r\nour side the loss of two so estimable men, who possess our whole and\r\nperfect confidence in public as well as in private affairs, and have\r\nalways proved themselves true friends, leaves _a great gap_.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE INFORMED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _7th December 1845._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel has informed the Queen that in consequence of\r\ndifferences prevailing in the Cabinet, he is very reluctantly\r\ncompelled to solicit from the Queen the acceptance of his resignation,\r\nwhich she has as reluctantly accepted.\r\n\r\nFrom the Queen's unabated confidence in Lord Melbourne, her first\r\nimpulse was to request his immediate attendance here that she might\r\nhave the benefit of his assistance and advice, but on reflection the\r\nQueen does not think herself justified, in the present state of Lord\r\nMelbourne's health, to ask him to make the sacrifice which the return\r\nto his former position of Prime Minister would, she fears, impose upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt is this consideration, and this _alone_, that has induced the Queen\r\nto address to Lord John Russell the letter of which she sends a copy.\r\nThe Queen hopes, however, that Lord Melbourne will not withhold from\r\nher new Government his advice, which would be so valuable to her.\r\n\r\nIt is of the _utmost importance_ that the whole of this communication\r\nshould be kept a _most profound secret_ until the Queen has seen Lord\r\nJohn Russell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE'S ATTITUDE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\n_8th December 1845._\r\n\r\nSir Robert helped us in the composition of the letters to Lord John\r\nand to Lord Melbourne. We considered it necessary to write to the\r\nlatter, in consideration of the confidential position which he\r\nformerly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel has not _resigned_, thinking it a matter of great\r\nstrength for the Sovereign to keep his ministry until a new one can be\r\ngot.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _9th December 1845._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he has just\r\nreceived your Majesty's letter of the 7th inst., which, of course,\r\nhas astonished him by the magnitude of the event which it announces,\r\nalthough something of this sort has been long pending and to be\r\nexpected. Lord Melbourne returns your Majesty many thanks for\r\nthis communication, and more for your Majesty's great kindness and\r\nconsideration for him personally at the present moment. He is better,\r\nbut so long a journey would still not have been convenient to him,\r\nand he has such a horror of the sea, that a voyage from Southampton\r\nto Cowes or from Portsmouth to Ryde seems to him in prospect as\r\nformidable as a voyage across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will strictly observe your Majesty's injunction of\r\nsecrecy.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the kind wishes about office which your Majesty\r\nis pleased to express, Lord Melbourne will of course give to your\r\nMajesty's new Government, if formed under Lord John Russell, all the\r\nsupport in his power, but as to taking office, he fears that he would\r\nfind some difficulty. He would be very unwilling to come in pledged\r\nto a total and immediate reform of the Corn Law, and he also strongly\r\nfeels the difficulty which has in fact compelled Sir Robert Peel to\r\nretire, viz. the difficulty of carrying on the Government upon the\r\nprinciple of upholding and maintaining the present law with respect to\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne again thanks your Majesty for your great and\r\nconsiderate kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PEEL'S ATTITUDE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _10th December 1845._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\ninfluenced by no other motive than the desire to contribute if\r\npossible to the relief of your Majesty from embarrassment, and the\r\nprotection of the public interests from injury, is induced to make\r\nthis confidential communication to your Majesty explanatory of his\r\nposition and intentions with regard to the great question which is now\r\nagitating the public mind.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty can, if you think fit, make this communication known to\r\nthe Minister who, as successor to Sir Robert Peel, may be honoured by\r\nyour Majesty's confidence.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of November last Sir Robert Peel advised his\r\ncolleagues, on account of the alarming accounts from Ireland and many\r\ndistricts of Great Britain as to the failure of the potato crop from\r\ndisease, and for the purpose of guarding against contingencies which\r\nin his opinion were not improbable, humbly to recommend to your\r\nMajesty that the duties on the import of foreign grain should be\r\nsuspended for a limited period either by Order in Council, or by\r\nLegislative Enactment, Parliament in either case being summoned\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel foresaw that this suspension, fully justified by the\r\ntenor of the reports to which he has referred, would compel, during\r\nthe interval of suspension, the reconsideration of the Corn Laws.\r\n\r\nIf the opinions of his colleagues had been in concurrence with his\r\nown, he was fully prepared to take the responsibility of suspension,\r\nand of the necessary consequence of suspension, a comprehensive review\r\nof the laws imposing restrictions on the import of foreign grain and\r\nother articles of food, with a view to their gradual diminution and\r\nultimate removal. He was disposed to recommend that any new laws to be\r\nenacted should contain within themselves the principle of gradual and\r\nultimate removal.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel is prepared to support in a private capacity measures\r\nwhich may be in general conformity with those which he advised as a\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nIt would be unbecoming in Sir Robert Peel to make any reference to the\r\ndetails of such measures.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty has been good enough to inform him that it is your\r\nintention to propose to Lord John Russell to undertake the formation\r\nof a Government.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which Sir Robert Peel was prepared to recommend the\r\nreconsideration of the laws affecting the import of the main articles\r\nof food, was in general accordance with that referred to in the\r\nconcluding paragraph of Lord John Russell's letter to the electors of\r\nthe City of London.[32]\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel wished to accompany the removal of restrictions on the\r\nadmission of such articles, with relief to the land from such charges\r\nas are unduly onerous, and with such other provisions as in the terms\r\nof Lord John Russell's letter \"caution and even scrupulous forbearance\r\nmay suggest.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel will support measures founded on that general\r\nprinciple, and will exercise any influence he may possess to promote\r\ntheir success.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel feels it to be his duty to add, that should your\r\nMajesty's servants, after consideration of the heavy demands upon the\r\nArmy of this country for colonial service, of our relations with the\r\nUnited States, and of the bearing which steam navigation may have upon\r\nmaritime warfare, and the defence of the country, deem it advisable\r\nto propose an addition to the Army, and increased naval and military\r\nestimates, Sir Robert Peel will support the proposal, will do all that\r\nhe can to prevent it from being considered as indicative of hostile\r\nor altered feeling towards France, and will assume for the increase in\r\nquestion any degree of responsibility present or retrospective which\r\ncan fairly attach to him.\r\n\r\nROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: That paragraph urged that, with a revision\r\n    of taxation to make the arrangement more equitable, and the\r\n    safeguards suggested by caution and scrupulous forbearance,\r\n    restrictions on the admission of the main articles of food and\r\n    clothing used by the mass of the people should be removed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD STANLEY RESIGNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Stanley to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _11th December 1845._\r\n\r\n...

He begs to assure your Majesty that he would have\r\nshrunk from making no personal sacrifice, short of that of principle,\r\nfor the purpose of avoiding the inconvenience to your Majesty and to\r\nthe country inseparable from any change of Administration; but being\r\nunconvinced of the necessity of a change of policy involving an\r\nabandonment of opinions formerly maintained, and expectations held\r\nout to political supporters, he felt that the real interests of\r\nyour Majesty's service could not be promoted by the loss of personal\r\ncharacter which the sacrifice of his own convictions would necessarily\r\nhave involved; and that he might far more usefully serve your Majesty\r\nand the country out of office, than as the official advocate of a\r\npolicy which he could not sincerely approve. Lord Stanley begs to\r\nassure your Majesty that it will be his earnest endeavour to allay,\r\nas far as may lie in his power, the excitement which he cannot but\r\nforesee as the consequence of the contemplated change of policy; and\r\nhe ventures to indulge the hope that this long trespass upon your\r\nMajesty's much occupied time may find a sufficient apology in the deep\r\nanxiety which he feels that his regret at being compelled not only to\r\nretire from your Majesty's service, but also to take a step which he\r\nis aware may have had some influence on the course finally adopted\r\nby Sir Robert Peel, may not be still farther increased by the\r\napprehension of having, in the performance of a most painful duty,\r\nincurred your Majesty's displeasure.

He had written to all his\r\nformer colleagues to join him in his attempt, amongst others to Lord\r\nGrey, who answered, \"that he could only belong to a Government which\r\npledged itself to the principle of absolute free trade and abolition\r\nof all protection; that he had his own views upon the sugar question\r\n(as to which he advocated the admission of slave labour) and upon\r\nthe Irish question (as to which his principle was to establish entire\r\nreligious equality); that he hoped that in the formation of a new\r\nGovernment no personal considerations should stand in the way of a\r\nfull attention to public Duty.\"\r\n\r\nLord John replied that he advocated free trade, but as the immediate\r\nquestion before them was the _Corn Laws_, he thought it wiser not to\r\ncomplicate this by other declarations which would produce a good deal\r\nof animosity; that the sugar question and Ireland might be discussed\r\nin Cabinet when circumstances required it; that he agreed entirely in\r\nthe last sentence.\r\n\r\nAfter this Lord Grey declared himself quite satisfied. Lord John\r\nconsidered now with his colleagues the peculiar measure to be\r\nproposed, and Mr Baring thought he could arrange a financial scheme\r\nwhich would satisfy Lord Lansdowne's demands for relief to the landed\r\ninterest. They all felt it their duty to answer the Queen's call upon\r\nthem, though they very much disliked taking office under such peculiar\r\ndifficulties. Now Lord John undertook to apportion the different\r\noffices. He saw Lord Palmerston, and told him that the Queen had some\r\napprehension that his return to the Foreign Office might cause great\r\nalarm in other countries, and particularly in France, and that this\r\nfeeling was still more strongly manifested in the city; whether under\r\nthese circumstances he would prefer some other office--for instance,\r\nthe Colonies? Lord Palmerston declared that he was not at all anxious\r\nfor office, and should much regret that his accession should in any\r\nway embarrass Lord John; that he was quite prepared to support him out\r\nof office, but that his taking another department than his former one\r\nwould be a public recognition of the most unjust accusations that\r\nhad been brought against him; that he had evinced throughout a long\r\nofficial life his disposition for peace, and only in one instance\r\nbroke with France;[36] that that matter was gone by, and that nobody\r\nhad stronger conviction of the necessity to keep in amity with that\r\nPower than himself. Upon this Lord John said that he could not form a\r\nGovernment without him, and showed himself quite satisfied with Lord\r\nPalmerston's declaration.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: In reference to affairs in Syria in 1840.]\r\n\r\nSuddenly Lord Grey, who had heard of this, cried out: \"This was an\r\ninfringement of their compact\"; that no _personal_ consideration\r\nshould interfere with the discharge of public duty, and that he must\r\ndecline entering the Government, as he considered Lord Palmerston's\r\nreturn to the Foreign Office as fraught with danger to the peace\r\nof Europe. Lord John could not, under these circumstances, form a\r\nGovernment. He read to us a long letter from Lord Grey, written with\r\nthe intention that it should be seen by the Queen, in which Lord\r\nGrey enters more fully into his motives, and finishes by saying\r\nthat therefore _he_ was not answerable for the failure to form an\r\nAdministration.[37]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: Lord Grey's attitude was condemned by Macaulay\r\n    in a letter to a Mr Macfarlan, who unwisely communicated it to\r\n    the Press.]\r\n\r\nLord John gave the Queen a written statement[38] of the causes which\r\ninduced him to relinquish the Government, and of the position he means\r\nto assume in Parliament. (He is most anxious that Sir R. Peel should\r\nre-enter and successfully carry his measures.)\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Printed in _Annual Register_, 1846, p. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangements Lord John had contemplated have been--\r\n\r\n  Lord PALMERSTON,      _Foreign Secretary_.\r\n  Lord GREY,            _Colonial Secretary_.\r\n  Sir GEORGE GREY,      _Home Secretary_.\r\n\r\n(Sir George was anxious later to retire from Parliament, and willing\r\nto go as Governor-General to Canada.)\r\n\r\n  Mr BARING,            _Chancellor of the Exchequer_.\r\n  Lord CLARENDON,       _President of the Board of Trade_.\r\n\r\n(The Vice-Presidency was to have been offered to his brother, Mr\r\nVilliers, but finally, by his advice, to Mr Cobden!!

He was much\r\naffected, and expressed his concern at the failure of Lord John to\r\nform a Government, seemed hurt at Lord John's not having shown more\r\nconfidence in the integrity of his (Sir Robert Peel's) motives. He\r\nwould have supported Lord John in _any_ measure which he should have\r\nthought fit to introduce, and many would have followed his example. He\r\nblamed the want of deference shown to the Queen, by not answering\r\nher call with more readiness; he said it was quite new and\r\nunconstitutional for a man to take a week before he undertook to form\r\na Government, and to pass that time in discussion with other people,\r\nto whom the Sovereign had not yet committed the task; and he had been\r\ncertain it would end so, when so many people were consulted. He in\r\n1834 had been called from Italy, had travelled with all haste and\r\nhad gone straight to the King, had told him that he had seen nobody,\r\nconsulted nobody, but immediately kissed the King's hand as his\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nHe was now prepared to stand by the Queen, all other considerations\r\nhe had thrown aside, he would undertake to deal with the difficulties,\r\nand should have to go down alone to the House of Commons. He had\r\nwritten to his colleagues that he would serve the Queen if she called\r\nupon him to do so, that he expected them to meet him at nine o'clock\r\nthat evening, and that he would tell them what he meant to do. Those\r\nwho would not go with him, he would dismiss at once. He did not wish\r\nto avail himself of any undue advantage, and therefore would not\r\nadvise an Order in Council, but go at once to Parliament, laying his\r\nmeasure before it: \"Reject it, if you please; there it is!\"\r\n\r\nHe called the crisis an alarming one, which determination alone could\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nWe showed him Lord John Russell's statement, with which he declared\r\nhimself very much satisfied. He advised the Queen to write a letter\r\nto Lord John, announcing to him Sir Robert's consent to go on with the\r\nGovernment, and wrote a draft of it, which follows here.\r\n\r\nHe had heard strange instances of disagreement amongst the men whom\r\nLord John had assembled in town.\r\n\r\nSir Robert seemed throughout much moved, and said with much warmth:\r\n\"There is no sacrifice that I will not make for your Majesty, except\r\nthat of my honour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _20th December 1845._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel has just been here. He expressed great regret that\r\nLord John Russell had felt it necessary to decline the formation of a\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nHe said he should have acted towards Lord John Russell with the most\r\nscrupulous good faith, and that he should have done everything in his\r\npower to give Lord John support.\r\n\r\nHe thinks many would have been induced to follow his example.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel did not hesitate a moment in withdrawing his offer of\r\nresignation. He said he felt it his duty at once to resume his office,\r\nthough he is deeply sensible of the difficulties with which he has to\r\ncontend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PEEL CORDIALLY SUPPORTED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _21st December 1845._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and proceeds\r\nto give your Majesty an account of what has passed since he left your\r\nMajesty at four o'clock yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet met at Sir Robert Peel's house in Downing Street at\r\nhalf-past nine.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel informed them that he had not summoned them for the\r\npurpose of deliberating on what was to be done, but for the purpose\r\nof announcing to them that he was your Majesty's Minister, and whether\r\nsupported or not, was firmly resolved to meet Parliament as your\r\nMajesty's Minister, and to propose such measures as the public\r\nexigencies required.\r\n\r\nFailure or success must depend upon their decision, but nothing could\r\nshake Sir Robert Peel's determination to meet Parliament and to advise\r\nthe Speech from the Throne.\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence, at length interrupted by Lord Stanley's\r\ndeclaring that he must persevere in resigning, that he thought the\r\nCorn Law ought to be adhered to, and might have been maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington said he thought the Corn Law was a subordinate\r\nconsideration. He was _delighted_ when he received Sir Robert Peel's\r\nletter that day, announcing to the Duke that his mind was made up to\r\nplace his services at your Majesty's disposal.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buccleuch behaved admirably--was much agitated--thought\r\nnew circumstances had arisen--would not then decide on resigning.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel has received this morning the enclosed note from the\r\nDuke.[39]\r\n\r\nHe has written a reply very strongly to the Duke, stating that the\r\npresent question is not one of Corn Law, but whether your Majesty's\r\nformer servants or Lord Grey and Mr Cobden shall constitute your\r\nMajesty's Government. Sir Robert Peel defied the wit of man to suggest\r\nnow another alternative to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen will see the Duke to-day.\r\n\r\nAll the other members of the Government cordially approved of Sir\r\nRobert Peel's determination not to abandon your Majesty's service.\r\n\r\nThere was no question about details, but if there is any, it shall not\r\nalter Sir Robert Peel's course.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: _See_ next letter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Buccleuch to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nMONTAGU HOUSE, _20th December 1845._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR ROBERT,--That which has occurred this evening, and that\r\nwhich you have communicated to us, the very critical state in which\r\nthe country now is, and above all the duty which I owe to her Majesty\r\nunder the present circumstances, has made a most strong impression\r\nupon my mind.

I have little to add to\r\nAlbert's letter of yesterday, except my _extreme_ admiration of\r\nour worthy Peel, who shows himself a man of unbounded _loyalty_,\r\n_courage_, patriotism, and _high-mindedness_, and his conduct towards\r\nme has been _chivalrous_ almost, I might say. I never have seen him\r\nso excited or so determined, and _such_ a good cause must succeed. We\r\nhave indeed had an escape, for though Lord John's _own notions_ were\r\n_very_ good and moderate, he let himself be entirely twisted and\r\ntwirled about by his _violent_ friends, and _all_ the moderate ones\r\nwere crushed....\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _23rd December 1845._\r\n\r\nSIR,--I think Her Majesty and your Royal Highness will have been\r\npleased with the progress I have made in execution of the great trust\r\nagain committed to me by Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nIt will be of great importance to conciliate Lord Stanley's support\r\nout of office, to induce him to _discourage_ hostile combinations.\r\n\r\nI would humbly recommend Her Majesty, when Her Majesty sees Lord\r\nStanley to-day, to receive him with her usual kindness, to say that I\r\nhad done full justice in my reports to Her Majesty to the motives by\r\nwhich he had been actuated, and to the openness and frankness of his\r\nconduct, to regret greatly the loss of his services, but to hope\r\nthat he might be still enabled not to oppose and even to promote\r\nthe accomplishment of what cannot now be safely resisted. I have the\r\nhonour to be, etc., etc., etc.,\r\n\r\nROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CORN LAWS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE UNEMPLOYED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _25th December 1845._\r\n\r\nWe had a Council yesterday, at which Parliament was prorogued to\r\nthe 22nd of January, then to meet for the despatch of business. Lord\r\nStanley had an audience of the Queen before, and delivered up the\r\nSeals of his office. He was much agitated, and had told Sir Robert\r\nthat he dreaded this interview very much. The Queen thanked him for\r\nhis services, and begged he would do his best out of office to smooth\r\ndown the difficulties her Government would have to contend with. At\r\nthe Council Lord Dalhousie took his seat, and Mr Gladstone received\r\nthe Colonial Seals. The Queen saw the Duke of Buccleuch and\r\nthanked him for the devotion he had shown her during these trying\r\ncircumstances; the same to the Duke of Wellington, who is in excellent\r\nspirits. On my saying, \"You have such an influence over the House\r\nof Lords, that you will be able to keep them straight,\" he answered:\r\n\"I'll do anything; I am now beginning to write to them and to convince\r\nthem singly of what their duty is.\"\r\n\r\nWe saw afterwards Sir Robert Peel, who stayed more than three hours.\r\nHe is in the highest spirits at having got Mr Gladstone and kept the\r\nDuke of Buccleuch; he proposed that the Duke should be made President,\r\nand Lord Haddington Privy Seal in his stead. (Lord Haddington had\r\nbehaved very well, had given up his place to Sir Robert, and told him\r\nhe should do with him just as he liked--leave him out of the Cabinet,\r\nshift him to another place, or leave him at the Admiralty, as would\r\nsuit him best.)\r\n\r\nSir Robert hinted to Lord Ripon that Lord Haddington had behaved so\r\nwell, but got no more out of him, but \"that he would _almost_ have\r\ndone the same.\" Sir Robert proposes to see Lord Ellenborough in order\r\nto offer him the Admiralty, received the Queen's sanction likewise to\r\nLord St Germans (the Postmaster-General) being put into the Cabinet. I\r\nsaid: \"With your Government that has no inconvenience, and even if you\r\nhad a hundred members in the Cabinet, as you don't tell them but\r\nwhat is absolutely necessary, and follow your own course.\" He said in\r\nreply, that he should be very sorry if he had to have told his\r\nCabinet that he meant to send for Lord Ellenborough. We could not help\r\ncontrasting this conduct with the subjection Lord John has shown to\r\nhis people. It is to his _own_ talent and firmness that Sir Robert\r\nwill owe his success, which cannot fail. He said he had been\r\ndetermined not to go to a general election with the fetters the last\r\nelection had imposed upon him, and he had meant at the end of the next\r\nSession to call the whole Conservative Party together and to declare\r\nthis to them, that he would not meet another Parliament pledged to the\r\nmaintenance of the Corn Laws, which could be maintained no longer, and\r\nthat he would make a public declaration to this effect before another\r\ngeneral election came on. This had been defeated by events coming too\r\nsuddenly upon him, and he had no alternative but to deal with the Corn\r\nLaws before a national calamity would _force_ it on. The league had\r\nmade immense progress, and had enormous means at their disposal. If\r\nhe had resigned in November, Lord Stanley and the Protectionists would\r\nhave been prepared to form a Government, and a Revolution might have\r\nbeen the consequence of it. Now they felt that it was too late.\r\n\r\nSir Robert has _an immense scheme in view_; he thinks he shall be able\r\nto remove the contest entirely from the dangerous ground upon which it\r\nhas got--that of a war between the manufacturers, the hungry and the\r\npoor against the landed proprietors, the aristocracy, which can only\r\nend in the ruin of the latter; he will not bring forward a measure\r\nupon the Corn Laws, but a much more comprehensive one. He will deal\r\nwith the whole commercial system of the country. He will adopt\r\nthe principle of the League, _that of removing all protection and\r\nabolishing all monopoly_, but not in favour of one class and as a\r\ntriumph over another, but to the benefit of the nation, farmers as\r\nwell as manufacturers. He would begin with cotton, and take in all the\r\nnecessaries of life and corn amongst them. The experiments he had\r\nmade in 1842 and 1845 with boldness but with caution had borne out the\r\ncorrectness of the principle: the wool duty was taken off, and wool\r\nsold higher than ever before; foreign cattle were let in, and the\r\ncattle of England stood better in the market than ever. He would not\r\nask for compensation to the land, but wherever he could give it, and\r\nat the same time promote the social development, there he would do it,\r\nbut on that ground. For instance, one of the greatest benefits to\r\nthe country would be the establishment of a rural police on the\r\nsame principle as the metropolitan police. By taking this on the\r\nConsolidated Fund, the landowners would be immensely relieved in all\r\nthose counties which kept a police. One of the heaviest charges on\r\nthe land was the present administration of law and the carrying on of\r\nprosecutions. Sir Robert could fancy this to be very much improved\r\nby the appointment of a _public_ prosecutor by the State, which would\r\ngive the State a power to prevent vexatious, illegal, and immoral\r\nprosecutions, and reduce the expenses in an extraordinary degree. Part\r\nof the maintenance of the poor, according to the Poor Law, might be\r\nundertaken by the State. A great calamity must be foreseen, when the\r\ninnumerable railroads now in progress shall have been terminated,\r\nwhich will be the case in a few years. This will throw an enormous\r\nlabouring population suddenly out of employment. There might be a\r\nlaw passed which would provide employment for them, and improve the\r\nagriculture and production of the country, by enabling the State to\r\nadvance money to the great proprietors for the improvements of their\r\nestates, which they could not obtain otherwise without charging their\r\nestates beyond what they already have to bear.\r\n\r\nSir Robert means to go with Mr Gladstone into all these details.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON'S JUSTIFICATION]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON'S POLICY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Viscount Melbourne._[41]\r\n\r\nBOWOOD, _26th December 1845._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MELBOURNE,--I return you with many thanks George Anson's\r\nletter, which was enclosed in yours of the 23rd, which I received just\r\nas we were setting off for this place. Pray, when next you write to\r\nGeorge Anson, say how gratefully I appreciate the kind consideration\r\non the part of H.R.H. Prince Albert, which suggested George Anson's\r\ncommunication. But I can assure you that although John Russell, in his\r\nAudience of the Queen, may inadvertently have overstated the terms in\r\nwhich he had mentioned to me what Her Majesty had said to him about\r\nmy return to the Foreign Office, yet in his conversations with me upon\r\nthat subject he never said anything more than is contained in George\r\nAnson's letter to you; and I am sure you will think that under all the\r\ncircumstances of the case he could hardly have avoided telling me thus\r\nmuch, and making me aware of the impression which seemed to exist upon\r\nthe Queen's mind as to the way in which other persons might view my\r\nreturn to the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Her Majesty's own sentiments, I have always been\r\nconvinced that Her Majesty knows me too well to believe for an instant\r\nthat I do not attach the greatest importance to the maintenance, not\r\nmerely of peace with all foreign countries, but of the most friendly\r\nrelations with those leading Powers and States of the world with which\r\nserious differences would be attended with the most inconvenience. As\r\nto Peace, I succeeded, as the organ of Lord Grey's Government and of\r\nyours, in preserving it unbroken during ten years[42] of great and\r\nextraordinary difficulty; and, if now and then it unavoidably happened\r\nduring that period of time, that in pursuing the course of policy\r\nwhich seemed the best for British interests, we thwarted the views\r\nof this or that Foreign Power, and rendered them for the moment less\r\nfriendly, I think I could prove that in every case the object which we\r\nwere pursuing was of sufficient importance to make it worth our while\r\nto submit to such temporary inconvenience. There never was indeed,\r\nduring those ten years, any real danger of war except on three\r\noccasions; and on each of those occasions the course pursued by the\r\nBritish Government prevented war. The first occasion was just after\r\nthe accession of the King of the French, when Austria, Russia, and\r\nPrussia were disposed and preparing to attack France, and when the\r\nattitude assumed by the British Government prevented a rupture. The\r\nsecond was when England and France united by a Convention to wrest the\r\nCitadel of Antwerp from the Dutch, and to deliver it over to the\r\nKing of the Belgians.[43] If England had not then joined with France,\r\nAntwerp would have remained with the Dutch, or the attempt to take it\r\nwould have led to a war in Europe. The third occasion was when Mehemet\r\nAli's army occupied Syria, and when he was constantly threatening\r\nto declare himself independent and to march on Constantinople; while\r\nRussia, on the one hand, asserted that if he did so she would occupy\r\nConstantinople, and on the other hand, France announced that if Russia\r\ndid so, she, France, would force the Dardanelles. The Treaty of July\r\n1840, proposed and brought about by the British Government, and the\r\noperations in execution of that Treaty, put an end to that danger;\r\nand, notwithstanding what has often been said to the contrary, the\r\nreal danger of war arising out of the affairs of Syria was put an end\r\nto, and not created by the Treaty of 1840.\r\n\r\nI am well aware, however, that some persons both at home and abroad\r\nhave imbibed the notion that I am more indifferent than I ought to be\r\nas to running the risk of war. That impression abroad is founded upon\r\nan entire mistake, but is by some sincerely felt, and being sincere,\r\nwould soon yield to the evidence of contradictory facts. At home that\r\nimpression has been industriously propagated to a limited extent,\r\npartly by the legitimate attacks of political opponents, and partly\r\nby a little cabal within our own ranks. These parties wanted to attack\r\nme, and were obliged to accuse me of something. They could not charge\r\nme with failure, because we had succeeded in all our undertakings,\r\nwhether in Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Syria, China, or elsewhere; they\r\ncould not charge me with having involved the country in war, because,\r\nin fact, we had maintained peace; and the only thing that was left for\r\nthem to say was that my policy had a _tendency_ to produce war, and I\r\nsuppose they would argue that it was quite wrong and against all rule\r\nthat it did not do so.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding what may have been said on this matter, the\r\ntransaction which has by some been the most criticised in this\r\nrespect, namely, the Treaty of 1840, and the operations connected with\r\nit, were entirely approved by the leaders of the then Opposition, who,\r\nso far from feeling any disposition to favour me, had always made a\r\ndetermined run at the Foreign Policy of the Whig Government. The Duke\r\nof Wellington, at the opening of the Session of 1841, said in\r\nthe House of Lords that he entirely approved our policy in that\r\ntransaction, and could not find that any fault had been committed\r\nby us in working it out; and I happen to know that Sir Robert Peel\r\nexpressed to the representative of one of the German Powers, parties\r\nto the Alliance, his entire approval of our course, while Lord\r\nAberdeen said to one of them, that the course I had taken in that\r\naffair made him forgive me many things of former years, which he had\r\nthought he never should have forgiven.\r\n\r\nI am quite ashamed of the length to which this letter has grown, and\r\nshall only add, with reference to our relations with France, that\r\nI had some very friendly interviews with Thiers, who was my chief\r\nantagonist in 1840, and that although we did not enter into any\r\nconspiracy against Guizot and Peel, as the newspapers pretended, we\r\nparted on very good terms, and he promised to introduce me to all his\r\nfriends whenever I should go to Paris, saying that of course Guizot\r\nwould do me the same good office with his supporters. My dear\r\nMelbourne, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: Submitted to the Queen by Lord Melbourne.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: 1830-1834, and 1835-1841.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: The English and French came in 1832 to the\r\n    assistance of the Belgians, who some time before had entered\r\n    Antwerp, but failed to take the Citadel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE MINISTRY REINSTATED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the French._\r\n\r\nCH.

I have\r\nheard many instances of the confidence the country and _all_ parties\r\nhave in Peel; for instance, he was immensely cheered at Birmingham--a\r\nmost Radical place; and _Joseph Hume_ expressed great distress when\r\nPeel resigned, and the greatest contempt for Lord John Russell. The\r\nMembers of the Government have behaved extremely well and with much\r\ndisinterestedness. The Government has secured the services of Mr\r\nGladstone and Lord Ellenborough,[44] who will be of great use. Lord E.\r\nis become very quiet, and is a very good speaker.\r\n\r\nWe had a very happy Christmas. This weather is extremely unwholesome.\r\nNow, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Lord Ellenborough was one of the few\r\n    Conservative statesmen of the day who, after remaining\r\n    faithful to Sir Robert Peel till the middle of 1846,\r\n    subsequently threw in his fortunes with Lord Derby and Mr\r\n    Disraeli. He was President of the Board of Control with those\r\n    Ministers in 1858 for the fourth time.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing days of the year 1845 had been marked by startling\r\npolitical events, and Lord John Russell's failure to form a\r\nGovernment, and Sir Robert Peel's resumption of office, with Mr\r\nGladstone substituted for Lord Stanley, were now followed by the\r\nMinisterial measure for the Repeal of the Corn Laws. Embarrassed as\r\nhe now was by the attacks of his old supporters, led by Bentinck\r\nand Disraeli, Peel was supported whole-heartedly but in a strictly\r\nconstitutional manner by the Queen and the Prince. Amid bitter taunts,\r\nthe Premier piloted the measure through Parliament, but on the night\r\nthat it finally passed the Lords he was defeated on an Irish Coercion\r\nBill by a factious combination in the Commons between the Whigs and\r\nProtectionists, and resigned. Lord John Russell on this occasion was\r\nable to form an administration, though he failed in his attempt to\r\ninclude in it some important members of the outgoing Government.\r\n\r\nThus, owing to the Irish famine, the Tory party which had come into\r\npower in 1841 with a majority of ninety to support the Corn Laws, was\r\nshattered; after Peel's defeat it became clear that no common action\r\ncould take place between his supporters in the struggle of 1846\r\nand men like Bentinck and Disraeli, who now became leaders of the\r\nProtectionist party. For the remainder of the year Peel was on the\r\nwhole friendly to the Russell Government, his chief care being to\r\nmaintain them in office as against the Protectionists.\r\n\r\nIn India the British army was successful in its operations against the\r\nSikhs, Sir Harry Smith defeating them at Aliwal, and Sir Hugh Gough at\r\nSobraon. Our troops crossed the Sutlej, and terms of peace were agreed\r\non between Sir Henry Hardinge (who became a Viscount) and the Sirdars\r\nfrom Lahore, peace being signed on 8th March.\r\n\r\nOn the continent of Europe the most important events took place in the\r\nPeninsula. The selection of husbands for the Queen of Spain and her\r\nsister, which had so long been considered an international question,\r\ncame at last to a crisis; the policy of Great Britain had been to\r\nleave the matter to the Spanish people, except in so far as might be\r\nnecessary to check the undue ambition of Louis Philippe; and neither\r\nthe Queen, Prince Albert, Peel, nor Aberdeen had in any way supported\r\nthe candidature of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.\r\n\r\nIt was common ground that no son of Louis Philippe should marry the\r\nQueen, but both that monarch and Guizot had further solemnly engaged\r\nat the Chateau d'Eu that no son should marry even the Infanta until\r\nthe Queen was married and had children. The return of Palmerston to\r\nthe Foreign Office, and his mention of Prince Leopold in a Foreign\r\nOffice despatch as one of the candidates, gave the King and his\r\nMinister the pretext they required for repudiating their solemn\r\nundertaking. In defiance of good faith the engagements were\r\nsimultaneously announced of the Queen to her cousin, Don Francisco\r\nde Asis, and of the Infanta to the Duc de Montpensier, Don Francisco\r\nbeing a man of unattractive, even disagreeable qualities, and feeble\r\nin _physique_. By this unscrupulous proceeding Queen Victoria and the\r\nEnglish nation were profoundly shocked.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Queen Maria found some difficulty in maintaining her\r\nposition in Portugal. She dismissed in a somewhat high-handed manner\r\nher Minister the Duc de Palmella, and had to bear the brunt of an\r\ninsurrection for several months: at the close of the year her arms\r\nwere victorious at the lines of Torres Vedras, but the Civil War was\r\nnot entirely brought to an end.\r\n\r\nIn February a Polish insurrection broke out in Silesia, and the\r\nAustrian troops were driven from Cracow; the rising was suppressed by\r\nAustria, Russia, and Prussia, who had been constituted the \"Protecting\r\nPowers\" of Cracow by the Treaty of Vienna. This unsuccessful attempt\r\nwas seized upon as a pretext for destroying the separate nationality\r\nof Cracow, which was forthwith annexed to Austria. This unjustifiable\r\nact only became possible in consequence of the _entente_ between\r\nEngland and France (equally parties to the Treaty of Vienna) having\r\nbeen terminated by the affair of the Spanish marriages; their formal\r\nbut separate protests were disregarded.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be mentioned the dispute between Great Britain and\r\nthe United States as to the Oregon boundary, which had assumed so\r\nominous a phase in 1845. Lord Aberdeen's last official act was to\r\nannounce in the Lords that a Convention, proposed by himself for\r\nadjusting the question, had been accepted by the American President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n1846\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _23rd January 1846._\r\n\r\nThe Queen must compliment Sir Robert Peel on his beautiful and indeed\r\n_unanswerable_ speech of last night, which we have been reading with\r\nthe greatest attention.[1] The concluding part we also greatly admire.\r\nSir R. Peel has made a very strong case. Surely the impression which\r\nit has made must have been a good one. Lord John's explanation is\r\na fair one;[2] the Queen has _not_ a doubt that he will support Sir\r\nRobert Peel.\r\n\r\nHe has indeed pledged himself to it. He does not give a very\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the causes of his failure, but perhaps he\r\ncould not do so without exposing Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nWhat does Sir Robert think of the temper of the House of Commons, and\r\nof the debate in the House of Lords? The debates not being adjourned\r\nis a good thing. The crowd was immense out-of-doors yesterday, and we\r\nwere never better received.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The Queen had opened Parliament in person; the\r\n    Prime Minister took the unusual course of speaking immediately\r\n    after the seconder of the Address, and in his peroration,\r\n    after laying stress on the responsibilities he was incurring,\r\n    proceeded: \"I do not desire to be Minister of England; but\r\n    while I am Minister of England I will hold office by no\r\n    servile tenure; I will hold office unshackled by any other\r\n    obligation than that of consulting the public interests and\r\n    providing for the public safety.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: He explained that the attitude of Lord Grey made\r\n    the difficulties attending the formation of a Whig Ministry\r\n    insuperable.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: EXTENSION OF INDIAN FRONTIER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Henry Hardinge to Queen Victoria._[3]\r\n\r\nCAMP, LULLIANEE, 24 miles from LAHORE, _18th February 1846._\r\n\r\nThe territory which it is proposed should be ceded in perpetuity to\r\nyour Majesty is a fine district between the Rivers Sutlej and Beas,\r\nthrowing our frontier forward, within 30 miles of Amritsar, so as\r\nto have 50 miles of British territory in front of Loodiana, which,\r\nrelatively with Ferozepore, is so weak, that it appeared desirable to\r\nthe Governor-General to improve our frontier on its weakest side, to\r\ncurb the Sikhs by an easy approach towards Amritsar across the Beas\r\nRiver instead of the Sutlej--to round off our hill possessions near\r\nSimla--to weaken the Sikh State which has proved itself to be too\r\nstrong--and to show to all Asia that although the British Government\r\nhas not deemed it expedient to annex this immense country of the\r\nPunjab, making the Indus the British boundary, it has punished the\r\ntreachery and violence of the Sikh nation, and exhibited its powers\r\nin a manner which cannot be misunderstood. For the same political\r\nand military reason, the Governor-General hopes to be able before the\r\nnegotiations are closed to make arrangements by which Cashmere may be\r\nadded to the possessions of Gholab Singh, declaring the Rajpoot Hill\r\nStates with Cashmere independent of the Sikhs of the Plains. The Sikhs\r\ndeclare their inability to pay the indemnity of one million and a\r\nhalf, and will probably offer Cashmere as an equivalent. In this case,\r\nif Gholab Singh pays the money demanded for the expenses of the war,\r\nthe district of Cashmere will be ceded by the British to him, and the\r\nRajah become one of the Princes of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nThere are difficulties in the way of this arrangement, but considering\r\nthe military power which the Sikh nation has exhibited of bringing\r\ninto the field 80,000 men and 300 pieces of field artillery, it\r\nappears to the Governor-General most politic to diminish the means of\r\nthis warlike people to repeat a similar aggression. The nation is in\r\nfact a dangerous military Republic on our weakest frontier. If the\r\nBritish Army had been defeated, the Sikhs, through the Protected\r\nStates, which would have risen in their favour in case of a reverse,\r\nwould have captured Delhi, and a people having 50,000 regular troops\r\nand 300 pieces of field artillery in a standing permanent camp within\r\n50 miles of Ferozepore, is a state of things that cannot be tolerated\r\nfor the future....\r\n\r\nThe energy and intrepidity displayed by your Majesty's\r\nCommander-in-Chief, Sir Hugh Gough, his readiness to carry on the\r\nservice in cordial co-operation with the Governor-General, and the\r\nmarked bravery and invincibility of your Majesty's English troops,\r\nhave overcome many serious obstacles, and the precautions taken have\r\nbeen such that no disaster or failure, however trifling, has attended\r\nthe arduous efforts of your Majesty's Arms.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The Sikhs were defeated at Sobraon on 10th\r\n    February by the British troops under Sir Hugh Gough,\r\n    reinforced by Sir Harry Smith, fresh from his victory at\r\n    Aliwal. _See_ p. 71.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PEEL'S ANXIETIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _3rd March 1846._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I hasten to thank you for a most dear and kind\r\nletter of the 28th, which I received this morning. You know how I\r\nlove and esteem my dearest Louise; she is the dearest friend, after my\r\nbeloved Albert, I have.\r\n\r\nI wish you could be here, and hope you will come here for a few days\r\nduring your stay, to see the innumerable alterations and improvements\r\nwhich have taken place. My dearest Albert is so happy here, out all\r\nday planting, directing, etc., and it is so good for him. It is a\r\nrelief to be away from all the bitterness which people create for\r\nthemselves in London. Peel has a very anxious and a very peculiar\r\nposition, and it is the force of circumstances and the great energy\r\nhe _alone possesses_ which will carry him through the Session. He\r\ncertainly acts a most disinterested part, for did he not feel (as\r\n_every one_ who is fully acquainted with the _real state_ of the\r\ncountry must feel) that the line he pursues is the _only right_ and\r\nsound one for the welfare of this country, he never would have\r\nexposed himself to all the annoyance and pain of being attacked by his\r\nfriends. He was, however, determined to have done this before the next\r\ngeneral election, but the alarming state of distress in Ireland forced\r\nhim to do it now. I must, however, leave him to explain to you fully\r\nhimself the peculiar circumstances of the present very irregular state\r\nof affairs. His majority was _not_ a _certain_ one _last year_, for on\r\nMaynooth, upwards of a _hundred_ of his followers voted against him.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in India is very serious. I am glad you do\r\njustice to the bravery of our good people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF SIR ROBERT SALE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Henry Hardinge._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _4th March 1846._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is anxious to seize the first opportunity of expressing to\r\nSir Henry Hardinge, her admiration of his conduct on the last most\r\ntrying occasion, and of the courage and gallantry of the officers and\r\nmen who had so severe a contest to endure.[4] Their conduct has been\r\nin every way worthy of the British name, and both the Prince and Queen\r\nare deeply impressed with it. The severe loss we have sustained in\r\nso many brave officers and men is very painful, and must alloy the\r\nsatisfaction every one feels at the brilliant successes of our Arms.\r\nMost deeply do we lament the death of Sir Robert Sale, Sir John\r\nM'Caskill,[5] and Major Broadfoot,[6] and most deeply do we sympathise\r\nwith that high-minded woman, Lady Sale, who has had the misfortune\r\nto lose her husband less than three years after she was released from\r\ncaptivity and restored to him.\r\n\r\nWe are truly rejoiced to hear that Sir H. Hardinge's health has\r\nnot suffered, and that he and his brave son have been so mercifully\r\npreserved. The Queen will look forward with great anxiety to the next\r\nnews from India.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: At Moodkee on 18th December, and Ferozeshah on\r\n    21st and 22nd December.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Who had commanded a brigade under Pollock in the\r\n    second Afghan campaign.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Major George Broadfoot, C.B., Political Agent on\r\n    the north-western frontier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE'S MEMORANDUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st April 1846._\r\n\r\nI saw this day Sir R. Peel, and showed him a memorandum, which I had\r\ndrawn up respecting our conversation of the 30th.\r\n\r\nIt filled six sheets, and contained, as minutely as I could render\r\nit, the whole of the arguments we had gone through. Sir Robert read\r\nit through and over again, and, after a long pause, said: \"I was not\r\naware when I spoke to your Royal Highness that my words would be taken\r\ndown, and don't acknowledge that this is a fair representation of my\r\nopinion.\" He was visibly uneasy, and added, if he knew that what he\r\nsaid should be committed to paper, he would speak differently, and\r\ngive his opinion with all the circumspection and reserve which a\r\nMinister ought to employ when he gave responsible advice; but he had\r\nin this instance spoken quite unreservedly, like an advocate defending\r\na point in debate, and then he had taken another and tried to carry\r\nthis as far as it would go, in order to give me an opportunity of\r\njudging of the different bearings of the question. He did so often in\r\nthe Cabinet, when they discussed important questions, and was often\r\nasked: \"Well, then, you are quite against this measure?\" \"Not at\r\nall, but I want that the counter argument should be gone into to the\r\nfullest extent, in order that the Cabinet should not take a one-sided\r\nview.\"\r\n\r\nHe viewed the existence of such a paper with much uneasiness, as it\r\nmight appear as if he had left this before going out of office in\r\norder to prepossess the Queen against the measures, which her future\r\nMinister might propose to her, and so lay secretly the foundation\r\nof his fall. The existence of such a paper might cause great\r\nembarrassment to the Queen; if she followed the advice of a Minister\r\nwho proposed measures hostile to the Irish Church, it might be said,\r\nshe knew what she undertook, for Sir R. Peel had warned her and left\r\non record the serious objections that attached to the measure.\r\n\r\nI said that I felt it to be of the greatest importance to possess\r\nhis views on the question, but that I thought I would not have been\r\njustified in keeping a record of our conversation without showing it\r\nto him, and asking him whether I had rightly understood him; but if\r\nhe felt a moment's uneasiness about this memorandum, I would at once\r\ndestroy it, as I was anxious that nothing should prevent his\r\nspeaking without the slightest reserve to me in future as he had done\r\nheretofore. I felt that these open discussions were of the greatest\r\nuse to me in my endeavour to investigate the different political\r\nquestions of the day and to form a conclusive opinion upon them.\r\nAs Sir Robert did not say a word to dissuade me, I took it as an\r\naffirmative, and threw the memorandum into the fire, which, I could\r\nsee, relieved Sir Robert.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Gladstone to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n13 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, _1st April 1846._\r\n\r\nMr William Gladstone presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nprays that he may be honoured with your Majesty's permission to direct\r\nthat the Park and Tower Guns may be fired forthwith in celebration of\r\nthe victory which was achieved by your Majesty's forces over the Sikh\r\narmy in Sobraon on the 10th of February.[7]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: In September 1882 Mr Gladstone quoted this as\r\n    a precedent for firing the Park Guns after the victory of\r\n    Tel-el-Kebir.

The debate on this\r\npreliminary question lasted until nearly half-past eleven.\r\n\r\nLike every unjust and malignant attack, this, according to Sir Robert\r\nPeel's impressions, recoiled upon its authors.\r\n\r\nHe thinks the House was completely satisfied. Lord John Russell and\r\nLord Morpeth behaved very well.\r\n\r\nThe vindictive motive of the attack was apparent to all but a few\r\nProtectionists.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: In consequence of a serious increase of crime in\r\n    Ireland, a Coercion Bill had been introduced.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: This refers to the Catholic Emancipation\r\n    discussions of 1827, when Bentinck and Disraeli accused Peel\r\n    of having hounded Canning to death.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ATTACK ON PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, _22nd June 1846._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and assures\r\nyour Majesty that he is penetrated with a deep sense of your Majesty's\r\ngreat kindness and your Majesty's generous sympathy with himself and\r\nLady Peel.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel firmly believes that the recent attack made upon him\r\nwas the result of a foul conspiracy concocted by Mr Disraeli and Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck, in the hope and belief that from the lapse of time\r\nor want of leisure in Sir Robert Peel to collect materials for his\r\ndefence, or the destruction of documents and papers, the means of\r\ncomplete refutation might be wanting....\r\n\r\nHe hopes, however, he had sufficient proof to demonstrate the\r\nfalseness of the accusation, and the malignant motives of the\r\naccusers.\r\n\r\nHe is deeply grateful to your Majesty and to the Prince for the kind\r\ninterest you have manifested during the progress of this arduous\r\nstruggle, which now he trusts is approaching to a successful\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _26th June 1846._ (_Two o'clock._)\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave\r\nto acquaint your Majesty that the members of the Government met in\r\nCabinet to-day at one.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel is just returned from this meeting.\r\n\r\nHe stated to the Cabinet that after the event of yesterday (the\r\nrejection of the Irish Bill by so large a majority as 73) he felt\r\nit to be his duty as head of the Government humbly to tender his\r\nresignation of office to your Majesty. He added that, feeling no\r\nassurance that the result of a Dissolution would be to give a majority\r\nagreeing with the Government in general principles of policy, and\r\nsufficient in amount to enable the Government to conduct the business\r\nof the country with credit to themselves and satisfaction to your\r\nMajesty and the public at large, he could not advise your Majesty to\r\ndissolve the Parliament.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel said that, in his opinion, the Government generally\r\nought to resign, but his mind was made up as to his own course.\r\n\r\nThere was not a dissenting voice that it was the duty of the\r\nGovernment to tender their resignation to your Majesty, and for the\r\nreasons stated by Sir Robert Peel, not to advise dissolution. If Sir\r\nRobert Peel does not receive your Majesty's commands to wait upon your\r\nMajesty in the course of to-day, Sir Robert Peel will be at Osborne\r\nabout half-past three to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PEEL'S RESIGNATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE HOUSE, _28th June 1846._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel arrived yesterday evening and tendered his\r\nresignation. He is evidently much relieved in quitting a post, the\r\nlabours and anxieties of which seem almost too much for anybody to\r\nbear, and which in these last six months were particularly onerous.\r\nIn fact, he said that he would not have been able to stand it much\r\nlonger. Nothing, however, would have induced him to give way before\r\nhe had passed the Corn Bill and the Tariff.[10] The majority upon the\r\nIrish Bill was much larger than any one had expected; Sir Robert was\r\nglad of this, however, as it convinced his colleagues of the necessity\r\nof resigning. He told them at the Cabinet that, as for himself\r\npersonally, he had made up his mind to resign, and on being asked\r\nwhat he advised his Cabinet to do, he recommended them to do the\r\nsame, which received general concurrence. The last weeks had not been\r\nwithout some intrigue. There was a party headed by Lord Ellenborough\r\nand Lord Brougham, who wished Sir Robert and Sir James Graham to\r\nretire, and for the rest of the Cabinet to reunite with the Protection\r\nsection of the Conservatives, and to carry on the Government. Lord\r\nEllenborough and Lord Brougham had in December last settled to head\r\nthe Protectionists, but this combination had been broken up by Lord\r\nEllenborough's acceptance of the post of First Lord of the Admiralty;\r\nLord Brougham then declared for free trade, perhaps in order to follow\r\nLord Ellenborough into office. The Duke of Wellington had been for\r\ndissolution till he saw the complete disorganisation of his party\r\nin the House of Lords. The Whigs, having been beat twice the evening\r\nbefore by large majorities on the Roman Catholic Bill, had made every\r\nexertion on the Coercion Bill, and the majority was still increased by\r\nSir Robert's advising the Free Traders and Radicals, who had intended\r\nto stay away in order not to endanger Sir Robert's Government, not to\r\ndo so as they would not be able to save him. Seventy Protectionists\r\nvoted with the majority.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: By a remarkable coincidence the Corn Bill passed\r\n    through the Lords on the same night that the Ministry were\r\n    defeated in the Commons.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Town Sir R. Peel addressed a letter to Lord John\r\nRussell, informing him that he was going to the Isle of Wight in order\r\nto tender his and his colleagues' resignation to the Queen, that he\r\ndid not the least know what Her Majesty's intentions were, but that in\r\ncase she should send for Lord John, he (Sir Robert) was ready to see\r\nLord John (should he wish it), and give him any explanation as to\r\nthe state of public affairs and Parliamentary business which he could\r\ndesire. Sir Robert thought thereby, without in the least committing\r\nthe Queen, to indicate to Lord John that he had nothing to fear on his\r\npart, and that, on the contrary, he could reckon upon his assistance\r\nin starting the Queen's new Government. He hoped likewise that this\r\nwould tend to dispel a clamour for dissolution which the Whigs have\r\nraised, alarmed by their defeats upon the Catholic Bill.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: END OF THE OREGON DISPUTE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _29th June 1846._\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave to\r\nacquaint your Majesty that he has just concluded his speech notifying\r\nto the House the resignation of the Government.\r\n\r\nHe thinks it was very well received.[11] Lord Palmerston spoke after\r\nSir Robert Peel, but not very effectively, but no other person spoke.\r\nSir Robert Peel is to see Lord John Russell at ten to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel humbly congratulates your Majesty on the intelligence\r\nreceived _this day_ from America.

Acland was sitting with me; and I must say a few words in reply\r\nby the early post. I went down to hear Peel in the House of Commons,\r\nand very fine it was. The House crowded, Peers and Ambassadors filling\r\nevery seat and overflowing into the House. Soon after six all private\r\nbusiness was over; Peel not come in, all waiting, no one rose for\r\nanything; for ten minutes this lasted: then Peel came in, walked up\r\nthe House: colder, dryer, more introverted than ever, yet to a close\r\ngaze showing the fullest working of a smothered volcano of emotions.\r\nHe was out of breath with walking and sat down on the Treasury Bench\r\n(placing a small despatch box with the Oregon despatches on the table)\r\nas he would be fully himself before he rose. By-and-by he rose, amidst\r\na breathless silence, and made the speech you will have read long ere\r\nthis. It was very fine: very effective: really almost solemn: to fall\r\nat such a moment. He spoke as if it was his last political scene: as\r\nif he felt that between alienated friends and unwon foes he could\r\nhave no party again; and could only as a shrewd bystander observe and\r\nadvise others. There was but one point in the Speech which I thought\r\ndoubtful: the apostrophe to \"Richard Cobden.\"[14] I think it was\r\nwrong, though there is very much to be said for it. The opening of the\r\nAmerican peace was noble; but for the future, what have we to look to?\r\nAlready there are whispers of Palmerston and War; the Whig budget and\r\ndeficiency. The first great question all men ask is: does Lord John\r\ncome in, leaning on Radical or Conservative aid? Is Hawes to be in the\r\nCabinet? the first Dissenter? the first tradesman? the Irish Church? I\r\nwish you were near enough to talk to, though even then you would know\r\ntoo much that must not be known for a comfortable talk. But I shall\r\nhope soon to see you; and am always, my dear Anson, very sincerely and\r\naffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nS. OXON.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Dr S. Wilberforce.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: \"Sir, the name which ought to be, and which will\r\n    be, associated with the success of these measures, is the name\r\n    of a man who, acting, I believe, from pure and disinterested\r\n    motives, has advocated their cause with untiring energy, and\r\n    by appeals to reason, enforced by an eloquence the more to\r\n    be admired because it was unaffected and unadorned--the\r\n    name which ought to be and which will be associated with the\r\n    success of these measures is the name of Richard Cobden.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW GOVERNMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE HOUSE, _30th June 1846._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell arrived here this afternoon; he has seen Sir Robert\r\nPeel this morning, and is prepared to undertake the formation of\r\na Government which he thinks will stand; at least, for the present\r\nsession he anticipates no difficulty, as Sir R. Peel has professed\r\nhimself ready not to obstruct its progress, and as the Protectionists\r\nhave held a meeting on Saturday at which Lord Stanley has declared\r\nthat he would let this Government go on smoothly unless the word\r\n\"Irish Church\" was pronounced. About men and offices, Lord John has\r\nconsulted with Lord Lansdowne, Palmerston, Clarendon, and Cottenham,\r\nwho were of opinion that the Liberal members of Sir Robert's Cabinet\r\nought to be induced to retain office under Lord John, viz. Lord\r\nDalhousie, Lord Lincoln, and Mr Sidney Herbert. Sir Robert Peel at the\r\ninterview of this morning had stated to Lord John that he would not\r\nconsider it as an attempt to draw his supporters away from him (it not\r\nbeing his intention to form a party), and that he would not dissuade\r\nthem from accepting the offer, but that he feared that they would not\r\naccept. We concurred in this opinion, but Lord John was authorised\r\nby Victoria to make the offer. Mr F. Baring, the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer under the late Whig Government, has intimated to Lord John\r\nthat he would prefer if no offer of office was made to him; Lord John\r\nwould therefore recommend Mr Charles Wood for this office. Lord Grey\r\nwas still a difficulty; in or out of office he seemed to be made a\r\ndifficulty. It would be desirable to have him in the Cabinet if he\r\ncould waive his opinions upon the Irish Church. His speech in the\r\nHouse of Lords[15] at the beginning of the session had done much harm,\r\nhad been very extreme, and Lord John was decidedly against him in\r\nthat. Lord Grey knew that everybody blamed it, but said everybody\r\nwould be of those (his) opinions ten years hence, and therefore he\r\nmight just as well hold them now. Mr Wood having great influence with\r\nhim might keep him quiet, and so would the Colonial seals, as he would\r\nget work enough. About Lord Palmerston, he is satisfied, and would no\r\nmore make any difficulty.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: On the 23rd of March, in the course of a long\r\n    speech on the state of Ireland, Earl Grey had contrasted the\r\n    poverty of the Roman Catholic Church in that country with the\r\n    affluence of the Establishment, diverted, as he said, by the\r\n    superior power of England from its original objects; adding\r\n    that the Protestant Church was regarded by the great mass of\r\n    the Irish people as an active cause of oppression and misery.]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell told me in the evening that he had forgotten to\r\nmention one subject to the Queen: it was that Sir Robert Peel by his\r\nspeech and his special mention of Mr Cobden as the person who had\r\ncarried the great measure, had made it very difficult for Lord John\r\nnot to offer office to Mr Cobden. The Whigs were already accused of\r\nbeing exclusive, and reaping the harvest of other people's work. The\r\nonly thing he could offer would be a _Cabinet_ office. Now this would\r\naffront a great many people whom he (Lord J.) had to conciliate, and\r\ncreate even possibly dissension in his Cabinet. As Mr Cobden was going\r\non the Continent for a year, Lord John was advised by Lord Clarendon\r\nto write to Mr C., and tell him that he had heard he was going\r\nabroad, that he would not make any offer to him therefore, but that\r\nhe considered him as entitled once to be recommended for office to the\r\nQueen. This he would do, with the Queen's permission....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW MINISTRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _1st July 1846._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns these letters, with her best thanks. The settlement\r\nof the Oregon question has given us the greatest satisfaction. It does\r\nseem strange that at the moment of triumph the Government should\r\nhave to resign. The Queen read Sir Robert Peel's speech with great\r\nadmiration. The Queen seizes this opportunity (though she will see Sir\r\nRobert again) of expressing her _deep_ concern at losing his services,\r\nwhich she regrets as much for the Country as for herself and the\r\nPrince. In whatever position Sir Robert Peel may be, we shall ever\r\nlook on him as a kind and true friend, and ever have the greatest\r\nesteem and regard for him as a Minister and as a private individual.\r\n\r\nThe Queen will not say anything about what passed at Lord John\r\nRussell's interview, as the Prince has already written to Sir Robert.\r\nShe does not think, however, that he mentioned the wish Lord John\r\nexpressed that Lord Liverpool should retain his office, which however\r\n(much as we should personally like it) we think he would not do.\r\n\r\nWhat does Sir Robert hear of the Protectionists, and what do his own\r\nfollowers say to the state of affairs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: WHIG JEALOUSIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _6th July 1846._\r\n\r\nYesterday the new Ministry were installed at a Privy Council, and the\r\nSeals of Office transferred to them. We had a long conversation with\r\nSir Robert Peel, who took leave. I mentioned to him that his word\r\nof \"Richard Cobden\" had created an immense sensation, but he was not\r\ninclined to enter upon the subject. When we begged him to do nothing\r\nwhich could widen the breach between him and his party, he said, \"I\r\ndon't think that we can ever get together again.\" He repeated that he\r\nwas anxious not to undertake a Government again, that his health would\r\nnot stand it, that it was better likewise for the Queen's service\r\nthat other, younger men should be brought forward. Sir Robert, Lord\r\nAberdeen, and Sir James Graham parted with great emotion, and had\r\ntears in their eyes when they thanked the Queen for her confidence\r\nand support. Lord Aberdeen means to have an interview with Lord\r\nPalmerston, and says that when he (Lord A.) came into office, Lord\r\nPalmerston and the _Chronicle_ assailed him most bitterly as an\r\nimbecile Minister, a traitor to his country, etc., etc. He means now\r\nto show Lord P. the contrast by declaring his readiness to assist him\r\nin every way he can by his advice, that he would at all times speak to\r\nhim as if he was his colleague if he wished it.\r\n\r\nThe new Court is nearly completed, and we have succeeded in obtaining\r\na very respectable and proper one, notwithstanding the run which\r\nthe Party made upon it which had been formerly used to settle these\r\nmatters, to _their_ liking only. The Government is not a united one,\r\nhowever, by any means. Mr Wood and Lord Clarendon take the greatest\r\ncredit in having induced Lord Grey to join the Government,[16] and are\r\nresponsible to Lord John to keep him quiet, which they think they will\r\nbe able to do, as he had been convinced of the folly of his former\r\nline of conduct. Still, they say Lord Lansdowne will have the lead\r\nonly nominally, that Lord Grey is to take it really in the House\r\nof Lords. There is the _Grey Party_, consisting of Lord Grey, Lord\r\nClarendon, Sir George Grey, and Mr Wood; they are against Lord\r\nLansdowne, Lord Minto, Lord Auckland, and Sir John Hobhouse,\r\nstigmatising them as old women. Lord John leans entirely to the\r\nlast-named gentlemen. There is no cordiality between Lord John and\r\nLord Palmerston, who, if he had to make a choice, would even forget\r\nwhat passed in December last, and join the Grey Party in preference to\r\nLord John personally. The curious part of all this is that they\r\ncannot keep a secret, and speak of all their differences. They got\r\nthe _Times_ over by giving it exclusive information, and the leading\r\narticles are sent in and praise the new Cabinet, but the wicked paper\r\nadded immediately a furious attack upon Sir John Hobhouse, which\r\nalarmed them so much that they sent to Sir John, sounding him, whether\r\nhe would be hereafter prepared to relinquish the Board of Control.\r\n(This, however, is a mere personal matter of Mr Walter, who stood\r\nagainst Sir John at Nottingham in 1841 and was unseated.) Sir John\r\nEasthope, the proprietor of the _Morning Chronicle_, complains\r\nbitterly of the subserviency to the _Times_ and treason to him. He\r\nsays he knows that the information was sent from Lord John's house,\r\nand threatens revenge. \"If you will be ruled by the _Times_,\" he\r\nsaid to one of the Cabinet, \"the _Times_ has shown you already by a\r\nspecimen that you will be ruled by a rod of iron.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: In spite of the opposition of the latter to\r\n    Palmerston's re-appointment to the Foreign Office.

It arrived yesterday, which was a very hard day for me. I had to\r\npart with Sir R. Peel and Lord Aberdeen, who are irreparable losses\r\nto us and the Country; they were both so much overcome that it quite\r\noverset me, and we have in them two devoted friends. We felt so safe\r\nwith them. Never, during the five years that they were with me, did\r\nthey _ever_ recommend a _person_ or a thing which was not for my or\r\nthe Country's best, and never for the Party's advantage only; and the\r\ncontrast _now_ is very striking; there is much less respect and much\r\nless high and pure feeling. Then the discretion of Peel, I believe, is\r\nunexampled.\r\n\r\nStockmar has, I know, explained to you the state of affairs, which\r\nis unexampled, and I think the present Government _very_ weak and\r\nextremely disunited. What may appear to you as a mistake in November\r\nwas an inevitable evil. Aberdeen very truly explained it yesterday.\r\n\"We had ill luck,\" he said; \"if it had not been for this famine in\r\nIreland, which rendered immediate measures necessary, Sir Robert would\r\nhave prepared them gradually for the change.\" Then, besides, the Corn\r\nLaw Agitation was such that if Peel had not wisely made this change\r\n(for which the _whole_ Country blesses him), a convulsion would\r\nshortly have taken place, and we should have been _forced_ to yield\r\nwhat has been granted as a boon. No doubt the breaking up of the Party\r\n(which _will_ come together again, whether under Peel or some one\r\nelse) is a very distressing thing. The only thing to be regretted, and\r\nI do not know exactly _why_ he did it (though we _can_ guess), was his\r\npraise of _Cobden_, which has shocked people a good deal.\r\n\r\nBut I can't tell you how sad I am to lose Aberdeen; you can't think\r\nwhat a delightful companion he was; the breaking up of all this\r\nintercourse during our journeys, etc., is deplorable.\r\n\r\nWe have contrived to get a _very_ respectable Court.\r\n\r\nAlbert's use to me, and I may say to the _Country_, by his firmness\r\nand sagacity, is beyond all belief in these moments of trial.\r\n\r\nWe are all well, but I am, of course, a good deal overset by all these\r\ntribulations.\r\n\r\nEver your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nI was much touched to see Graham so very much overcome at taking leave\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S ANXIETY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Hardinge._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _8th July 1846._\r\n\r\nThe Queen thanks Lord Hardinge for his interesting communications.\r\nLord Hardinge will have learnt all that has taken place in the\r\nCountry; one of the most brilliant Governments this Country ever\r\nhad has fallen at the moment of victory! The Queen has now, besides\r\nmourning over this event, the anxiety of having to see the Government\r\ncarried on as efficiently as possible, for the welfare of the Country.\r\nThe Queen would find a guarantee for the accomplishment of this\r\nobject in Lord Hardinge's consenting to continue at the head of the\r\nGovernment of India, where great experiments have been made which\r\nrequire unity of purpose and system to be carried out successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _10th July 1846._\r\n\r\n...

It is quite true that he has done much\r\ngood by preaching temperance, but by the aid of superstition, which\r\ncan hardly be patronised by the Crown.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Queen is sure that Lord John will like her at all times to speak\r\nout her mind, and has, therefore, done so without reserve.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The pension was, however, granted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE FRENCH ROYAL FAMILY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _14th July 1846._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--We are very happily established here since\r\nThursday, and have beautiful weather for this truly enjoyable place;\r\nwe drive, walk, and sit out--and the nights are so fine. I long for\r\nyou to be here. It has quite restored my spirits, which were much\r\nshaken by the sad leave-takings in London--of Sir R.

With regard to the marriage of the Queen of Spain, Viscount\r\nPalmerston has received a good deal of general information from\r\npersons who have conversed with him on the subject, but he has learnt\r\nnothing thereupon which was not already known to your Majesty. The\r\nstate of that matter seems, in a few words, to be that the Count\r\nof Trapani is now quite out of the question, that the Count of\r\nMontemolin, though wished for by Austria, and in some degree supported\r\nby the Court of the Tuileries, would be an impossible choice, and that\r\nthe alternative now lies between Don Enrique and the Prince Leopold\r\nof Coburg, the two Queens being equally set against the Duke of Cadiz,\r\nDon Enrique's elder brother. In favour of Prince Leopold seem to be\r\nthe two Queens, and a party (of what extent and influence does not\r\nappear) in Spain. Against that Prince are arrayed, ostensibly at\r\nleast, the Court of the Tuileries and the Liberal Party in Spain; and\r\nprobably to a certain degree the Government of Austria.\r\n\r\nIn favour of Don Enrique are a very large portion of the Spanish\r\nnation, who would prefer a Spanish prince for their Sovereign's\r\nhusband; and the preference, expressed only as an opinion and without\r\nany acts in furtherance of it, by your Majesty's late Administration.\r\nAgainst Don Enrique are the aversion of the Queen Mother, founded on\r\nher family differences with her late sister, and the apprehensions of\r\nthe present Ministers in Spain, who would think their power endangered\r\nby the political connection between Don Enrique and the more Liberal\r\nParty. The sentiments of the King of the French in regard to Don\r\nEnrique seem not very decided; but it appears likely that the King of\r\nthe French would prefer Count Montemolin or the Duke of Cadiz to Don\r\nEnrique; but that he would prefer Don Enrique to the Prince Leopold of\r\nCoburg, because the former would fall within the category of Bourbon\r\nprinces, descended from Philip the Fifth of Spain, proposed by the\r\nKing of the French as the limited circle within which the Queen of\r\nSpain should find a husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\n_16th July 1846._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Palmerston's interesting letter, and is\r\nvery much satisfied with his parting conversation with Ibrahim\r\nPasha, which she conceives will not be lost upon him. The view Lord\r\nPalmerston takes about the present position of the Spanish marriage\r\nquestion appears to the Queen quite correct. She finds only one\r\nomission, which is Queen Isabella's personal objection to Don Enrique,\r\nand the danger which attaches to marriage with a Prince taken up by a\r\nPolitical Party in Spain, which makes him the political enemy of the\r\nopposite Party.[18]\r\n\r\nThe Queen thanks Lord Palmerston for his zeal about Portugal, which\r\nis really in an alarming state.[19] She sends herewith the last letter\r\nwhich she received from the King of Portugal. The Queen is sorry to\r\nhave lost the opportunity of seeing Marshal Saldanha.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: On the 18th of July Lord Palmerston wrote his\r\n    celebrated despatch to Mr Bulwer, and unfortunately showed\r\n    a copy of it to Jarnac, the French Ambassador in London. The\r\n    mention of Prince Leopold in it, as a possible candidate for\r\n    the Queen of Spain's hand, gave the French King and Minister\r\n    the opportunity they wanted, and brought matters to a crisis.\r\n    See _Life of the Prince Consort_, vol. i. chap. xvii.;\r\n    Dalling's _Life of Lord Palmerston,_ vol. iii. chaps. vii. and\r\n    viii.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Owing to the insurrection, a run took place on\r\n    the Bank of Lisbon.

The Queen trusts, moreover, that late experience\r\nand good sense may induce the West Indians to be moderate and\r\naccommodating. As Lord John touches in his letter on the possibility\r\nof a Dissolution, the Queen thinks it right to put Lord John in\r\npossession of her views upon this subject _generally_. She considers\r\nthe power of dissolving Parliament a most valuable and powerful\r\ninstrument in the hands of the Crown, but which ought not to be used\r\nexcept in extreme cases and with a certainty of success. To use this\r\ninstrument and be defeated is a thing most lowering to the Crown\r\nand hurtful to the country. The Queen strongly feels that she made\r\na mistake in allowing the Dissolution in 1841; the result has been a\r\nmajority returned against her of nearly one hundred votes; but suppose\r\nthe result to have been nearly an equality of votes between the two\r\ncontending parties, the Queen would have thrown away her last remedy,\r\nand it would have been impossible for her to get any Government which\r\ncould have carried on public business with a chance of success.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was glad therefore to see that Sir Robert Peel did not ask\r\nfor a Dissolution, and she _entirely concurs_ in the opinion expressed\r\nby him in his last speech in the House of Commons, when he said:\r\n\r\n\"I feel strongly this, that no Administration is justified in advising\r\nthe exercise of that prerogative, unless there be a fair, reasonable\r\npresumption, even a strong moral conviction, that after a Dissolution\r\nthey will be enabled to administer the affairs of this country through\r\nthe support of a party sufficiently powerful to carry their measures.\r\nI do not think a Dissolution justifiable to strengthen a party. I\r\nthink the power of Dissolution is a great instrument in the hands of\r\nthe Crown, and that there is a tendency to blunt that instrument if it\r\nbe resorted to without necessity.\r\n\r\n\"The only ground for Dissolution would have been a strong presumption\r\nthat after a Dissolution we should have had a party powerful enough in\r\nthis House to give effect practically to the measures which we might\r\npropose. I do not mean a support founded on a concurrence on _one\r\ngreat question of domestic policy_, however important that may be, not\r\nof those who differ from us on almost all questions of public policy,\r\nagreeing with us in one; but that we should have the support of a\r\npowerful party united by a general concurrence of political opinions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen is confident that these views will be in accordance with\r\nLord John Russell's own sentiments and opinions upon this subject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: In pursuance of the policy of free trade, the\r\n    Ministry introduced and passed a Bill reducing the duties\r\n    on foreign slave-grown sugar, with the ultimate intention of\r\n    equalising them with those on Colonial produce.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE'S VIEWS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSOUTH STREET, _21st July 1846._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has just\r\nreceived your Majesty's letter of yesterday, and is much delighted at\r\nagain hearing from your Majesty.\r\n\r\nWhat your Majesty says of the state of public affairs and of parties\r\nin Parliament is true. But in November last Sir Robert Peel had\r\na party which might have enabled him to have long carried on the\r\nGovernment if he had not most unaccountably chosen himself to scatter\r\nit to the winds.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne is much gratified by the intimation that your Majesty\r\nwould not have been displeased or unwilling to see him again amongst\r\nyour confidential servants, but your Majesty acted most kindly and\r\nmost judiciously in not calling upon him in November last, and John\r\nRussell has done the same in forbearing to make to Lord Melbourne any\r\noffer at present. When Lord Melbourne was at Brocket Hall during\r\nthe Whitsuntide holidays he clearly foresaw that Sir Robert Peel's\r\nGovernment must be very speedily dissolved; and upon considering the\r\nstate of his own health and feelings, he came to the determination,\r\nwhich he communicated to Mr Ellice, who was with him, that he could\r\ntake no active part in the then speedily approaching crisis. He felt\r\nhimself quite unequal to the work, and also to that of either of the\r\nSecretaries of State, or even of the more subordinate and less heavy\r\nand responsible offices. He is very subject to have accesses of\r\nweakness, which render him incapable for exertion, and deprive his\r\nlife of much of its enjoyment. They do not appear at present to hasten\r\nits termination, but how soon they may do so it is impossible to\r\nforetell or foresee.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne hopes that he shall be able to wait upon your Majesty\r\non Saturday next, but he fears the weight of the full dress uniform.\r\nHe begs to be remembered to His Royal Highness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE AND PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Robert Peel to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nDRAYTON MANOR, FAZELEY, _August 1846._\r\n\r\nSIR,--I shall be very happy to avail myself of your Royal Highness's\r\nkind permission occasionally to write to your Royal Highness.

Much will depend on the proper\r\nmoment, for, after those speculations, it ought to succeed if\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is anxious that when undertaken it should be a National\r\nthing, and the good which it is to do must be a permanent and not a\r\ntransitory advantage to a particular Government, having the appearance\r\nof a party move.\r\n\r\nAs this is not a journey of pleasure like the Queen's former ones, but\r\na State act, it will have to be done with a certain degree of State,\r\nand ought to be done handsomely. It cannot be expected that the main\r\nexpense of it should fall upon the Civil List, nor would this be able\r\nto bear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CANADIAN AFFAIRS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prince Albert to Earl Grey._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _3rd August 1846._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD GREY,--The Queen wishes me to return you the enclosed\r\nletter. The subject of the Government of Canada is one which the Queen\r\nhas much at heart. Canada has been for a long time, and may probably\r\n_still_ be for the future, a source of great weakness to this Empire,\r\nand a number of experiments have been tried. It was in a very bad\r\nstate before the Union, continually embarrassing the Home Government,\r\nand the Union has by no means acted as a remedy, but it may be said\r\nalmost to have increased the difficulties. The only thing that has\r\nhitherto proved beneficial was the prudent, consistent, and impartial\r\nadministration of Lord Metcalfe. Upon the continuance and consistent\r\napplication of the system which he has laid down and acted upon,\r\nwill depend, in the Queen's estimation, the future welfare of that\r\nprovince, and the maintenance of proper relations with the mother\r\ncountry. The Queen therefore is most anxious that in the appointment\r\nof a new Governor-General (for which post she thinks Lord Elgin very\r\nwell qualified), regard should be had to securing an uninterrupted\r\ndevelopment of Lord Metcalfe's views. The Queen thought it the more\r\nher duty to make you acquainted with her sentiments upon this subject,\r\nbecause she thinks that additional danger arises from the impressions\r\nwhich the different agents of the different political parties in\r\nCanada try to produce upon the Home Government and the imperial\r\nParliament, and from their desire to mix up Canadian _party_ politics\r\nwith general English _party_ politics.[21] Ever yours, etc.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: In the event, Lord Elgin was appointed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _4th August 1846._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and is\r\ngreatly obliged to your Majesty for your Majesty's communication\r\nrespecting a Royal visit to Ireland. He concurs in your Majesty's\r\nobservations on that subject. He is of opinion that if the visit\r\npartook in any way of a party character, its effects would be\r\nmischievous, and not beneficial.\r\n\r\nHe is also doubtful of the propriety of either incurring very large\r\nexpense on the part of the public, or of encouraging Irish proprietors\r\nto lay out money in show and ceremony at a time when the accounts of\r\nthe potato crop exhibit the misery and distress of the people in an\r\naggravated shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE WELLINGTON STATUE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n_7th August_ [_1846_].\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Statue[22] on the arch on Constitution Hill, the\r\nQueen is of opinion that if she is considered individually she is\r\nbound by her word, and must allow the Statue to go up, however bad the\r\nappearance of it will be. If the constitutional fiction is applied to\r\nthe case, the Queen acts by the advice of her _responsible_ advisers.\r\nOne Government advised her to give her assent, another advises the\r\nwithdrawal of that assent. This latter position has been taken in Lord\r\nMorpeth's former letter to the Committee, and in the debate in the\r\nHouse of Commons; it must therefore now be adhered to, and whatever\r\nis decided must be the act of the Government. It would accordingly\r\nbe better to keep the word \"Government\" at the conclusion of Lord\r\nMorpeth's proposed letter, and that the Prince should not go to Town\r\nto give an opinion upon the appearance of the figure, when up.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: The equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington\r\n    at Hyde Park Corner was much criticised at the time of its\r\n    erection: it is now at Aldershot.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prince Albert to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\n[_9th August 1846._]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD PALMERSTON,--The Queen is much obliged for Lord Howard\r\nde Walden's private letter to you, and begs you will never hesitate to\r\nsend her such private communications, however unreserved they may\r\nbe in their language, as our chief wish and aim is, by hearing all\r\nparties, to arrive at a just, dispassionate, and correct opinion\r\nupon the various political questions.

The\r\nperusal of it has raised some apprehensions in the Queen's mind,\r\nwhich she stated to Lord Palmerston she would communicate to Lord John\r\nRussell.\r\n\r\nThe draft lays down a general policy, which the Queen is afraid may\r\nultimately turn out very dangerous. It is this:\r\n\r\nEngland undertakes to interfere in the internal affairs of Spain, and\r\nto promote the development of the present constitutional Government of\r\nSpain in a more democratic direction, and this for the avowed purpose\r\nof counteracting the influence of France. England becomes therefore\r\n_responsible_ for a particular direction given to the _internal_\r\nGovernment of Spain, which to control she has no sufficient means. All\r\nEngland can do, and will have to do, is: to keep up a particular party\r\nin Spain to support her views.\r\n\r\nFrance, knowing that this is directed against her, must take up the\r\nopposite party and follow the opposite policy in Spanish affairs.\r\n\r\nThis must bring England and France to quarrels, of which we can hardly\r\nforesee the consequences, and it dooms Spain to eternal convulsions\r\nand reactions.\r\n\r\nThis has been the state of things before; theory and experience\r\ntherefore warn against the renewal of a similar policy.\r\n\r\nThe natural consequence of this is that Don Enrique would appear\r\nas the desirable candidate for the Queen of Spain's hand, and Lord\r\nPalmerston accordingly for the first time deviates from the line\r\nhitherto followed by us, and _urges_ Don Enrique, which in the eyes of\r\nthe world must stamp him as \"_an English Candidate_.\" Lord Palmerston,\r\nfrom his wish to see him succeed, does, in the Queen's opinion, not\r\nsufficiently acknowledge the obstacles which stand in the way of\r\nthis combination, and which all those who are on the spot and in the\r\nconfidence of the Court represent as almost insurmountable.\r\n\r\nThe Queen desires Lord John Russell to weigh all this most maturely,\r\nand to let her know the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _19th August 1846._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to state that he has maturely considered, together with\r\nLord Palmerston, Lord Lansdowne, and Lord Clarendon, your Majesty's\r\nobservations on the draft sent by Lord Palmerston for your Majesty's\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell entirely concurs in your Majesty's wish that England\r\nand France should not appear at Madrid as countenancing conflicting\r\nparties. Lord John Russell did not attach this meaning to Lord\r\nPalmerston's proposed despatch, but he has now re-written the draft in\r\nsuch a manner as he trusts will obtain your Majesty's approval.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell will pay the utmost attention to this difficult and\r\ndelicate subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE SPANISH MARRIAGES]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DON ENRIQUE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _19th August 1846._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nendeavoured to modify and rearrange his proposed instruction to Mr\r\nBulwer in deference to your Majesty's wishes and feelings as expressed\r\nto Lord John Russell; and with this view also Viscount Palmerston has\r\ndivided the instruction into two separate despatches--the one treating\r\nof the proposed marriage of the Queen, the other of the possible\r\nmarriage of the Infanta. But with regard to these new drafts, as well\r\nas with regard to the former one, Viscount Palmerston would beg\r\nto submit that they are not notes to be presented to any Foreign\r\nGovernment, nor despatches to be in any way made public; but that they\r\nare confidential instructions given to one of your Majesty's Ministers\r\nabroad, upon matters upon which your Majesty's Government have been\r\nurgently pressed, to enable that Minister to give advice; and Viscount\r\nPalmerston would beg also to submit that in a case of this kind it\r\nwould not be enough to communicate drily the opinion of the British\r\nGovernment, without stating and explaining some of the reasons upon\r\nwhich those opinions are founded.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident from Mr Bulwer's communication, and especially\r\nfrom the postscript to his despatch of the 4th of this month, that\r\nQueen Christina, the Duke of Rianzares, and Senor Isturitz, are\r\nearnestly and intently bent upon marrying the Queen Isabella to Prince\r\nLeopold of Saxe-Coburg, and it is very difficult to find conclusive\r\ngrounds for saying that such a match would not perhaps, on the whole,\r\nbe the best for Queen Isabella and the Spanish nation. But still, all\r\nthings considered, your Majesty's Government incline to the opinion\r\nthat a Spanish Prince would be a preferable choice, and they are\r\nprepared to give that opinion to the Spanish Court.\r\n\r\nThere is however but one Spanish Prince whom it would be creditable\r\nto the British Government to recommend as husband to the Queen, and to\r\nthat Prince Queen Christina is known to feel objections, principally\r\nfounded upon apprehensions bearing upon her own personal interests.\r\nViscount Palmerston has endeavoured to furnish Mr Bulwer with such\r\narguments in favour of Don Enrique as appeared likely to meet Queen\r\nChristina's fears, and he has occasion to believe, from a conversation\r\nwhich he had a few days ago with Count Jarnac, that the French\r\nGovernment, impelled by the apprehension that your Majesty's\r\nGovernment intend to support Prince Leopold of Coburg, would be\r\nwilling, in order to draw the British Government off from such a\r\ncourse, to give at least an ostensible though perhaps not a very\r\nearnest support to Don Henry. But your Majesty will no doubt at\r\nonce perceive that although the British Government may come to an\r\nunderstanding with that of France as to which of the candidates shall\r\nbe the one in whose favour an opinion is to be expressed, it would be\r\nimpossible for the British Government to associate itself with that of\r\nFrance in any joint step to be taken upon this matter, and that each\r\nGovernment must act separately through its own agent at Madrid. For\r\nthe two Governments have not only different objects in view in these\r\nmatters, England wishing Spain to be independent, and France desiring\r\nto establish a predominant influence in Spain; but moreover, in regard\r\nto this marriage question, Great Britain has disclaimed any right to\r\ninterfere except by opinion and advice, while France has assumed\r\nan authority of dictation, and it is essential that your Majesty's\r\nGovernment should so shape the mode of co-operating with France as not\r\nto appear to sanction pretensions which are founded in no right and\r\nare inconsistent with justice.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston is by no means confident that the joint advice of\r\nthe British and French Governments in favour of Don Enrique will be\r\nsuccessful, and especially because he fears that M. Bresson has taken\r\nso active a part in favour of other arrangements, that he will not be\r\nvery eager in support of Don Enrique, and will perhaps think that if\r\nthis arrangement can be rendered impossible the chances may become\r\ngreater in favour of some other arrangement which he and his\r\nGovernment may prefer. But such future embarrassments must be dealt\r\nwith when they arise, and Viscount Palmerston submits that for the\r\nmoment, unless the British Government had been prepared to close with\r\nthe offers of the Duke of Rianzares, and to follow at once the course\r\nrecommended by Mr Bulwer, the steps suggested in the accompanying\r\ndrafts are the safest and the best.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston has great pleasure in submitting the accompanying\r\nprivate letter from Mr Bulwer announcing the withdrawal of the Spanish\r\ntroops from the frontier of Portugal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DOUBLE BETROTHAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Bulwer to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nMADRID, _29th August 1846._\r\n\r\nMY LORD,--I have troubled your Lordship of late with many\r\ncommunications....\r\n\r\nI have now to announce to your Lordship that the Queen declared last\r\nnight at twelve o'clock that she had made up her mind in favour of\r\nHis Royal Highness Don Francisco de Asis.... Your Lordship is aware\r\nunder what circumstances Don Francisco was summoned here, the Court\r\nhaving been, when I wrote on the 4th, most anxious to conclude a\r\nmarriage with Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, and only induced to\r\nabandon this idea from the repeated intimations it received that it\r\ncould not be carried out....\r\n\r\nThe same night a Council was held of the Queen Mother's friends,\r\nwho determined to bring matters forthwith to a conclusion. Queen\r\nChristina, I understand, spoke to her daughter and told her she\r\nmust choose one of two things, either marrying now, or deferring the\r\nmarriage for three or four years. That the Prince of Saxe-Coburg was\r\nevidently impossible; that Count Trapani would be dangerous; that Don\r\nHenry had placed himself in a position which rendered the alliance\r\nwith him out of the question, and that Her Majesty must either make up\r\nher mind to marry her cousin Don Francisco de Asis, or to abandon for\r\nsome time the idea of marrying.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, I am told, took some little time to consider, and then\r\ndecided in favour of her cousin. The Ministers were called in, and the\r\ndrama was concluded....\r\n\r\nH. L. BULWER.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--I learn that directly the Queen had signified her intention\r\nof marrying her cousin, Count Bresson formally asked the hand of the\r\nInfanta for the Duke of Montpensier, stating that he had powers to\r\nenter upon and conclude that affair, and the terms of the marriage\r\nwere then definitively settled between M.

We left Osborne on the 2nd, at eight in the morning,\r\nand reached Jersey at seven that evening. We landed at St Heliers the\r\nnext morning, and met with a most brilliant and enthusiastic reception\r\nfrom the good people. The island is beautiful, and like an orchard.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Queen of Spain's marriage, _coupled with\r\nMontpensier's_, is _infamous_, and we _must_ remonstrate. Guizot has\r\nhad the barefacedness to say to Lord Normanby that though _originally_\r\nthey said that Montpensier should _only_ marry the Infanta _when_ the\r\nQueen _was married_ and _had children_, that Leopold's being named one\r\nof the candidates had changed all, and that they must settle it now!\r\nThis is _too_ bad, for _we_ were so honest as _almost to prevent_\r\nLeo's marriage (which _might_ have been, and which Lord Palmerston, as\r\nmatters now stand, regrets much did not take place), and the return is\r\nthis unfair _coupling_ of the _two_ marriages which have nothing, and\r\nought to have nothing, to do with one another. The King should know\r\nthat _we_ are extremely indignant, and that this conduct is _not_ the\r\nway to keep up the _entente_ which _he_ wishes. It is done, moreover,\r\nin such a _dishonest_ way. I must do Palmerston the credit to say that\r\nhe takes it very quietly, and will act very temperately about it.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude.

But your Majesty's\r\nmost judicious answer has defeated that intention, if any such\r\nexisted, and has stated in a firm, but at the same time in the\r\nfriendliest manner, the grounds of complaint against the conduct of\r\nthe French Government in this affair.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston had yesterday afternoon a very long conversation\r\nwith the Count de Jarnac upon these matters.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston said that with regard to the marriage of the Queen\r\nof Spain, that was a matter as to which the British Government have\r\nno political objection to make. They deeply regret that a young Queen\r\nshould have been compelled by moral force, and to serve the personal\r\nand political interests of other persons, to accept for husband a\r\nperson whom she can neither like nor respect, and with whom her future\r\nlife will certainly be unhappy at home, even if it should not be\r\ncharacterised by circumstances which would tend to lower her in the\r\nestimation of her people. But these are matters which concern the\r\nQueen and people of Spain more than the Government and people of\r\nEngland. But that the projected marriage of the Duke of Montpensier is\r\na very different matter, and must have a political bearing that must\r\nexercise a most unfortunate effect upon the relations between England\r\nand France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE SPANISH MARRIAGES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _14th September 1846._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I have to thank you for a most kind letter of the\r\n31st from Basle, by which I was sorry to see that your journey had\r\nbeen delayed, and that you were still not well.\r\n\r\nWe are, alas! sadly engrossed with this Spanish marriage, which,\r\nthough it does not threaten _war_ (for the English care very little\r\nabout the Spanish marriages) threatens complications. Albert has told\r\nyou all that passed between the dear Queen and me, and the very absurd\r\nground on which the French make their stand. The details of the story\r\nare very bad--and I grieve to say that the good King, etc., have\r\nbehaved _very dishonestly_.\r\n\r\nWe have protested, and mean to protest very strongly, against\r\nMontpensier's marriage with the Infanta, _as long as she is\r\npresumptive heiress to the Throne of Spain_. The King departs from his\r\nprinciple, for _he insisted_ on a _Bourbon_, _because_ he declared he\r\nwould _not_ marry one of his sons to the Queen; and now he effects the\r\nQueen's marriage with the worst Bourbon she could have, and marries\r\nhis son to the Infanta, who in all probability will become Queen!\r\nIt is very bad. Certainly at Madrid [Palmerston] mismanaged it--as\r\nStockmar says--by forcing Don Enrique, in spite of all Bulwer could\r\nsay. If our dear Aberdeen was still at his post, the whole thing would\r\nnot have happened; for he would _not_ have forced Enriquito (which\r\nenraged Christine), and secondly, Guizot would not have _escamote_\r\nAberdeen with the wish of triumphing over him as he has done over\r\nPalmerston, who has behaved most openly and fairly towards France, I\r\nmust say, in this affair. But say what one will, it is _he again_ who\r\n_indirectly_ gets us into a squabble with France! And it is such a\r\npersonal sort of a quarrel, which pains and grieves me so; and I pity\r\nthe poor good Piat,[23] whom we are very fond of. One thing, however,\r\nI feel, that in opposing this marriage, we are not really affecting\r\nhis happiness, for he has never seen the Infanta--and she is a child\r\nof fourteen, and not pretty. The little Queen I pity so much, for\r\nthe poor child dislikes her cousin, and she is said to have consented\r\n_against her will_. We shall see if she really does marry him.\r\nAltogether, it is most annoying, and must ruffle our happy intercourse\r\nwith the French family for a time at least.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to write very strongly and openly to poor dear Louise\r\ntoo. You may rely upon nothing being done rashly or intemperately on\r\nour part. Lord Palmerston is quite ready to be guided by us.

The very day the Baron heard of the Spanish news, he\r\nwrote to a man at Paris, whom the King sees as often as he presents\r\nhimself at the palace. In this letter the Baron stated _fairly and\r\nmoderately but without palliation_ in what light M. Bresson's conduct\r\nmust necessarily appear _in London_, and what very naturally and most\r\nprobably _must be the political consequences of such conduct_.\r\n\r\nThe Baron's statement was read to the King, word for word, the very\r\nevening it reached Paris.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty listened to it most attentively, and said after some\r\npause: \"Notwithstanding all this, the marriage will take place. I\r\ndon't consider Montpensier's marriage an affair between nations, and\r\nthe English people, in particular, care very little about it; it is\r\nmuch more a private affair between myself and the English Secretary,\r\nLord Palmerston, _and as such_ it will not bring on important\r\npolitical consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER TO QUEEN LOUISE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Queen of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _18 Septembre 1846._\r\n\r\nMA BIEN CHERE LOUISE,--Je te remercie pour ton retour de franchise;\r\nje ne desire pas que cette controverse entre de plus dans notre\r\ncorrespondance privee, comme elle est le sujet et le sera je crains\r\nencore davantage de discussion politique.

It is very unfortunate that you should\r\nbe so far off at this moment. Since I wrote to you we have decided to\r\nremonstrate both at Madrid (this went a week ago), and at Paris, but\r\nthis last not in a formal note but in a despatch to Lord Normanby,\r\nagainst this very unjustifiable breach of faith on the part of France.\r\nWe have seen these despatches, which are very firm, but written in a\r\nvery proper and kind tone, exposing at the same time the fallacy\r\nof what has been done; for the King himself declared that he would\r\n_never_ let _one of his sons marry_ the Queen, he _insisted_ on her\r\nmarrying a descendant of Philip V. This has been done, and at the same\r\nmoment he says his _son_ is to marry the _Infanta_, who may _become\r\nQueen to-morrow!_And to all this he says, \"C'est seulement une\r\naffaire de famille\"! The King is very fond of England, and still more\r\nof peace, and he never _can_ sacrifice this (for though it would\r\nnot be immediate war it would cause coolness with us and with other\r\nPowers, and would probably lead to war in a short time), for a\r\nbreach of faith and _for one of his sons'_ marriages. No quarrel or\r\nmisunderstanding in the world _could be more disagreeable_ and to me\r\n_more cruelly painful_, for it is _so personal_, and has come into\r\nthe midst of all our communications and correspondence, and is too\r\nannoying. It is so sad, too, for dear Louise, to whom one cannot say\r\nthat her father has behaved dishonestly. I hope, however, another ten\r\ndays will show us some _daylight_. I will not mention anything about\r\nLeopold's[24] answer, as Albert will, I doubt not, write to you all\r\nabout it. It is very satisfactory, however.\r\n\r\nWe are since this day week in our charming new house, which is\r\ndelightful, and to-morrow we go, alas! to Windsor, where we expect the\r\nQueen-Dowager and the Princess of Prussia, who will remain a week with\r\nus. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nI received this afternoon your kind letter from Gais of the 12th. One\r\nword more I must just add. No doubt if Lord Aberdeen had been at his\r\npost what has happened would _not_ have taken place, and suspicion of\r\nLord Palmerston _has_ been the cause of the _unjustifiable_ conduct of\r\nthe French Government. But just as they _did_ suspect him, they should\r\nhave been more cautious to do anything which could bring on a quarrel,\r\nwhich is surely not what the King can wish.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCESS OF PRUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _29th September 1846._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received last week your very kind and\r\n_satisfactory_ letter of the 16th. Your opinion on this truly\r\nunfortunate and, on the part of the French, disgraceful affair is a\r\ngreat support to us. Stockmar has, I know, communicated to you what\r\nhas passed, and he will send you copies of the King's letter and my\r\nanswer. Our conduct has been throughout _honest_, and the King's and\r\nGuizot's the contrary. _How_ the King _can_ wantonly throw away the\r\nfriendship of one who has stood by him with such sincere affection,\r\nfor a _doubtful_ object of personal and family aggrandizement, is to\r\nme and to the whole country inexplicable. Have _confidence_ in _him_ I\r\nfear I never can again, and Peel, who is here on a visit, says a\r\n_war may_ arise any moment, _once_ that the good understanding is\r\ndisturbed; think, then, that the King has done this in his 74th\r\nyear, and leaves this inheritance to his successor; and to whom--to\r\na _Grandchild_, and a _Minor!_And for Nemours and Paris, _our_\r\nfriendship is of the greatest importance, and yet he prefers the\r\ntroubles of governing Spain, which will be a source of constant worry\r\nand anxiety, to the happy understanding so happily existing between\r\nour two countries! I cannot comprehend him. Guizot behaves shamefully,\r\nand so totally without good faith. Our protests have been presented. I\r\nfeel more than ever the loss of our valuable Peel.\r\n\r\nI wish, dearest Uncle, you would not go to Paris at all at present.\r\n\r\nThe Queen-Dowager and the Princess of Prussia[25] have left us this\r\nmorning after a week's stay, and I have been delighted with the\r\nPrincess. I find her so clever, so amiable, so well informed, and so\r\ngood; she seems to have some enemies, for there are whispers of\r\nher being _false_; but from all that I have seen of her--from her\r\ndiscretion, her friendship through thick and thin, and to her own\r\ndetriment, for Helene, and for the Queen-Dowager who has known her\r\nfrom her birth, I _cannot_ and will not believe it. Her position is\r\na very difficult one; she is too enlightened and liberal for the\r\nPrussian Court not to have enemies; but _I believe_ that she is a\r\nfriend to us and our family, and I do believe that _I_ have a friend\r\nin her, who may be most useful to us.

She thinks, however, that it\r\nis necessary to do more, and wishes Lord Palmerston should send a note\r\nto the Cabinets of the three Powers, explanatory of the whole of the\r\nproceedings relative to the Spanish marriages, showing the attitude\r\ntaken by us from the first, and disclosing the facts which led to this\r\nunfortunate termination.

He had in his hands a\r\nmemorandum, which is apparently word for word the letter of the King\r\nof the French to the Queen of the Belgians.[26]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell observed that it was admitted that the Duke of\r\nMontpensier was not to marry the Infanta till the Queen of Spain had\r\nchildren, and that voluntary engagement had been departed from. We\r\nmight expect the same departure from the professions now made not to\r\ninterfere in the affairs of Spain.\r\n\r\nCount Jarnac protested against this inference, and repeated that the\r\npromise with regard to the Infanta was only conditional.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell expects that in consequence of the remonstrances of\r\nEngland, and the attention of Europe to the question, France will be\r\ncautious in her interference with the internal government of Spain,\r\nand may probably not be able to direct her external policy.\r\n\r\nM.

I would much rather not say anything more about\r\nthis truly unfortunate and painful Spanish business; but in justice to\r\nmyself I must make a few observations. You say that the King thinks\r\nme _resentful_; this is extraordinary, for I have no such feeling; my\r\nfeelings were and are _deeply_ wounded at the unhandsome and secret\r\nmanner (so totally, in _letter_ and _in meaning_, contrary to an\r\n_entente cordiale_) in which this affair was settled, and in which the\r\ntwo marriages were incorporated.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nThe King and French Government never _expressed regret_ at the sudden\r\nand _unhandsome_ manner, to say the _least_, in which they behaved to\r\ntheir _best ally_ and _friend_, and _we_ really _cannot admit_ that\r\n_they have to forgive us for duping us!_Why have they not tried to\r\nmake _some_ sort of apology?

The Constitution may be, and I believe is, an unfortunate\r\nthing in those Southern countries; but once it is established, the\r\nQueen must abide by it; but, unfortunately, the _coup de main_ in\r\nsending away Palmella's Government (which would inevitably have\r\ncrumbled to pieces of itself), was both unconstitutional and unsafe,\r\nand I fear they are in a much worse position _vis-a-vis_ of the\r\ncountry than they ever were.[27]\r\n\r\nWe are all going to-morrow to Osborne for four weeks.

Lord John Russell breakfasted with Dr Hawtrey yesterday, and had\r\nmuch conversation with him. He finds Dr Hawtrey strongly impressed\r\nwith the evils of Montem, and he declared himself as decidedly against\r\nits continuance. He thinks your Majesty would please the Etonians\r\nequally by going to the boats once a year, which he said the late King\r\nwas in the habit of doing. The Chancellor of the Exchequer,[28] who\r\nwas at Eton, wishes to see Montem abolished. Lord Morpeth would prefer\r\nseeing it regulated.

The\r\nQueen not only thinks this wish very reasonable, considering that for\r\nrecent exploits of infinitely inferior importance such distinctions\r\nhave been granted by her, but she would feel personally a great\r\nsatisfaction in being enabled publicly to mark in this way her sense\r\nof the great services the Duke of Wellington has rendered to his\r\ncountry and to empower many a brave soldier to wear this token in\r\nremembrance of the Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE'S VIEW]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Wellington to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nSTRATHFIELDSAYE, _27th November 1846._\r\n\r\nField-Marshal the Duke of Wellington presents his humble duty to your\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nHe has just now received your Majesty's most gracious commands from\r\nOsborne, dated the 26th instant.\r\n\r\nHe does not doubt that many of the brave officers and soldiers who\r\nserved in the armies in the Peninsula under the command of the Duke\r\nare anxious to receive and wear a medal, struck by command of the\r\nSovereign, to commemorate the services performed in that seat of the\r\nlate war.\r\n\r\nMany of them have, upon more than one occasion, expressed such\r\ndesire, in their letters addressed to the Duke, in their petitions\r\nto Parliament, and, as the Duke has reason to believe, in petitions\r\npresented to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Duke has never omitted to avail himself of every occasion\r\nwhich offered to express his deep sense of the meritorious services of\r\nthe officers and soldiers of the Army which served in the Peninsula,\r\nhe did not consider it his duty to suggest to the Sovereign, under\r\nwhose auspices, or the Minister under whose direction the services in\r\nquestion were performed, any particular mode in which those services\r\nof the Army should be recognised by the State.\r\n\r\nNeither has he considered it his duty to submit such suggestion since\r\nthe period at which the services were performed, bearing in mind the\r\nvarious important considerations which must have an influence upon\r\nthe decision on such a question, which it was and is the duty of your\r\nMajesty's confidential servants alone to take into consideration, and\r\nto decide.\r\n\r\nNeither can the Duke of Wellington now venture to submit to your\r\nMajesty his sense of a comparison of the services of the Army which\r\nserved in the Peninsula, with those of other armies in other parts of\r\nthe world, whose recent services your Majesty has been most graciously\r\npleased to recognise by ordering that medals should be struck, to\r\ncommemorate each of such services, one of which to be delivered to\r\neach officer and soldier present, which your Majesty was graciously\r\npleased to permit him to wear.\r\n\r\nField-Marshal the Duke of Wellington humbly solicits your Majesty,\r\nin grateful submission to your Majesty upon the subject of the last\r\nparagraph of your Majesty's most gracious letter, that, considering\r\nthe favour with which his services were received and rewarded by the\r\ngracious Sovereign, under whose auspices they were performed; the\r\nprofessional rank and the dignity in the State to which he was raised,\r\nand the favour with which his services were then and have been ever\r\nsince received, that your Majesty would be graciously pleased to\r\nconsider upon this occasion only the well-founded claims upon your\r\nMajesty's attention of the officers and soldiers who served in the\r\nArmy in the Peninsula; and to consider him, as he considers himself,\r\namply rewarded for any service which he might have been instrumental\r\nin rendering; and desirous only of opportunities of manifesting his\r\ngratitude for the favour and honour with which he has been treated by\r\nhis Sovereign.\r\n\r\nAll of which is humbly submitted to your Majesty by your Majesty's\r\nmost dutiful and devoted Servant and Subject,\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _28th November 1846._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord Palmerston's draft to Mr\r\nSouthern,[30] and must observe that she does not quite approve the\r\ntone of it, as it will be likely only to irritate without producing\r\nany effect. If our advice is to be taken, it must be given in a spirit\r\nof impartiality and fairness. Lord Palmerston's despatch must give\r\nthe impression that we entirely espouse the cause of the rebels, whose\r\nconduct is, to say the least, illegal and very reprehensible. Lord\r\nPalmerston likewise takes the nation and the Opposition to be one and\r\nthe same thing. What we must insist upon is a return to Constitutional\r\nGovernment.

She has carefully read the Duke of Wellington's letter to Lord\r\nJohn, which evinces all the Duke's honourable feelings. He should\r\ncertainly be relieved from the appearance of having refused honours to\r\nothers, but agreed to the granting of them the moment it was intended\r\nto couple the measure with an honour conferred upon himself. On the\r\nother hand, the Queen still wishes the step to be taken as a means\r\nof doing honour to the Duke. His name should, therefore, certainly be\r\nconnected with it. The introduction of the names of other commanders,\r\neven of that of Sir John Moore, the Queen does not think advisable.\r\nShe does not quite understand from Lord John's letter whether he\r\nproposes to adopt the Duke's recommendation to _re_-issue all the\r\nmedals formerly granted, or to adhere to the original idea of striking\r\na new one. In the latter case, which appears the most natural, the\r\nword \"Peninsula\" would cover all the campaigns, and in these the Duke\r\nof Wellington had by far so much the greatest share that his\r\nname being introduced on _all_ the medals cannot be considered as\r\nanomalous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CRACOW]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _14th December 1846._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the enclosed private letters.[31] The view Lord\r\nPalmerston takes of the affair of Cracow appears to the Queen a very\r\nsound one, and she would much wish to see the plan of a conference\r\nrealised against which Lord Ponsonby does not bring any very relevant\r\nreasons. Prince Metternich's plan of a declaration \"that the case is\r\nto be considered an exceptional one and not to afford a precedent to\r\nother powers\" is too absurd. The Prince very justly compared it to the\r\ncase of a person giving another a box on the ear and declaring at the\r\nsame time that he is to consider it as exceptional, and that it is in\r\nno way to afford him a precedent for returning it. The Queen hopes the\r\nCabinet will well consider the question, and contrive to find means to\r\nprevent the evil consequences of the unjustifiable step against Cracow\r\nby speaking out in time, before Russia or France may have decided on\r\nacts of further infraction of the Treaty of Vienna. It seems quite\r\nclear that Russia was at the bottom of the measure relative to Cracow,\r\nand it is therefore but reasonable to expect that she has an ulterior\r\nobject in view.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: The first ill fruits of the disruption of the\r\n    _entente_ between England and France were seen in the active\r\n    co-operation of Russia, Prussia, and Austria to destroy Polish\r\n    independence. See _ante_, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1847 the Parliament which had been elected in 1841\r\nwith a great Tory majority was dissolved, and, as a result, the\r\nposition of the Whig Ministry was slightly improved; but they were\r\nstill dependent on the support of Sir Robert Peel. A Factory Act\r\nlimiting the labour of women and children to ten hours a day was\r\npassed. An autumn session was rendered necessary by an acute financial\r\ncrisis, the Ministry having authorised the Bank of England to infringe\r\nthe provisions of the recent Bank Charter Act, and as a consequence\r\nbeing compelled to ask Parliament for an indemnity. The knowledge of\r\nthe Bank's authority to issue notes beyond the prescribed limits was\r\nof itself sufficient to allay the panic. The Church of England was\r\nconvulsed by the promotion of Dr Hampden, whom Lord Melbourne had made\r\nRegius Professor of Divinity at Oxford, to the See of Hereford; his\r\northodoxy was impugned in a memorial presented by thirteen bishops to\r\nthe Prime Minister, and an unsuccessful application was made to the\r\nQueen's Bench (the Court being divided in opinion) to compel the\r\nPrimate to hear objections to Dr Hampden's consecration. The new House\r\nof Lords was used for the first time this year.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important event in France was the cold-blooded murder\r\nof the Duchesse de Praslin (daughter of Count Sebastiani, formerly\r\nFrench Ambassador in England) by her husband, an incident which, like\r\nthe Spanish intrigue of 1846, contributed subsequently to the downfall\r\nof the Orleanist dynasty.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland was torn by internecine strife, partly owing to the\r\nexistence, side by side, of Catholic and Protestant cantons; the\r\nproposed expulsion of Jesuits and the formation of the \"Sonderbund\"\r\nwere the questions of the day. The latter was an offensive and\r\ndefensive confederation of seven cantons, and civil war raged round\r\nthe question of its legality.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the death of Pope Gregory XVI. and the election of a more\r\nliberal successor induced Lord John Russell to send his father-in-law,\r\nLord Minto, the Lord Privy Seal, on a special mission to the new Pope\r\nPius IX., to encourage him in the path of Reform. But more violent\r\nmeasures were in progress, and it was soon clear that Lombardy and\r\nVenetia were rising against Austria, and the way being paved for the\r\nUnity of Italy.\r\n\r\nSpain was in a ferment, frequent changes of Ministry taking place,\r\nand the miserable marriage of the Queen having all the evil results\r\nanticipated in England. Portugal continued in a state of civil war,\r\nthe British attempting to mediate, but the revolutionary Junta refused\r\nto abide by their terms, and ultimately armed intervention became\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n1847\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _7th January 1847._\r\n\r\nThe turn which the Portuguese affairs are now likely to take is really\r\nvery satisfactory. The Queen is sure that the Court will not allow\r\nviolent measures of revenge to be taken against the vanquished party\r\nnor the overthrow of a Constitutional Government; but the Queen of\r\nPortugal will have to punish those who have broken their oath of\r\nallegiance, and will have to remove from the country those who would\r\ninfallibly ere long plunge the country afresh into those _horrors_\r\nfrom which it is just emerging. The further infusion of democracy\r\ninto the Charter would at this moment be quite misplaced, but this\r\nopportunity should be taken by the Queen of Portugal to _establish_ a\r\n_state_ of _legality_ and _security_, by compelling any new Ministry\r\nto lay the accounts every year before the Cortes (which has not been\r\ndone for the last ten years, either by Progressistas, Septembristas,\r\nor others), by establishing irremovable judges, and appointing thereto\r\nincorruptible persons, by _honestly and fairly_ distributing the\r\npatronage in the Army--apart from the party--which will now be\r\npossible as the King has the command himself, and by adopting such\r\nmeasures of _internal_ improvement as will promote the _material_\r\nwelfare of the people.\r\n\r\n_These_ are the principles which the Queen would wish to see _her_\r\nrepresentative urge upon the Portuguese Court and Government, and\r\nshe has no doubt that they are in perfect conformity with Lord John\r\nRussell's own views. The Queen cannot help repeating that the tone and\r\nbearing of Mr Southern are more those of a Portuguese Demagogue than\r\nof an English Representative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A CONCILIATORY POLICY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nTUILERIES, _15th January 1847._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I am truly happy to learn what you say about\r\nyour feelings on those troublesome politics; I can assure you that\r\nmany people who are, in fact, quite indifferent\r\nto politics, _rencherissent_ in expressions of dislike and contempt\r\n_seulement_, because they believe that you have those opinions. Many\r\nwise people repeat sayings which they assume to come from your\r\nown mouth, such, for instance, \"that Louis Philippe could never be\r\ntrusted, being, after all, an old fox,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe King's Speech was as unobjectionable as possible. I trust that\r\nthere will be no _bitterness_ in yours. It is as much, if not more,\r\nin the interest of Great Britain to keep France quiet and continuing a\r\npeaceable policy than in that of France. France, as the old Duke once\r\nsaid with great truth, has been already _under water several times,\r\nwhat could be spoiled has been spoiled_, what remains _is pretty\r\nsolid_. To attack France in France would lead to the most dangerous\r\nconsequences. In general, if we get once a great war again you will\r\nbe sure to have everywhere revolutions, and to imagine that you will\r\nescape in England all reactions would be a grievous mistake. When one\r\nlooks to the changes, brought about in England in consequence of the\r\nRevolution of July, one is quite astounded. Here they changed nothing\r\nbut the dynasty, in England _the very spirit of the old Monarchy\r\nhas been abolished_, and what will be, in the course of time, the\r\nconsequences, it is not easy to tell. A bad Constitution acts strongly\r\non the people. Look to America, even to Belgium. Ever, my dearest\r\nVictoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ENGLAND AND PORTUGAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _14th February 1847._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell's memorandum contains two different questions. The\r\none is this: how far the interests of England require an interference\r\nin the affairs of Portugal for the restoration of peace in that\r\ncountry and the preservation of its Throne, and how far England is\r\nbound by existing treaties to interfere.\r\n\r\nAs to this question, it appears from Lord John's memorandum that\r\nthe ancient treaties having reference to _foreign_ invasion only are\r\ninapplicable to the present case, that the Quadruple Treaty\r\nwould revive on the appearance of Dom Miguel in Portugal, that an\r\nunderstanding with Spain ought to be come to for its execution, but\r\nLord John does not make any specific proposal.\r\n\r\nThe other question is, what wrongs the Queen, the Ministers, and the\r\nrebels may have done to bring about the present state of affairs. This\r\nthe Queen conceives can only be decided by a _most minute, impartial,\r\nand anxious scrutiny_. She indignantly rejects the notion to leave\r\nthis decision to Mr Southern.... Lord John's statement contains,\r\nhowever, nothing but the echo of his reports.\r\n\r\nLord John will upon reflection admit that to say \"that recent events\r\nexhibit a spirit of tyranny and cruelty in the Portuguese Government\r\n_without a parallel_ in any part of Europe,\" there, where not _one_\r\nexecution has taken place, is rather a strong expression.\r\n\r\nThat the cruelties and miseries inseparable from a Civil War are to\r\nbe deplored, there can be no doubt of, and it is in order to stop a\r\nfurther continuance and perhaps aggravation of these horrors, that\r\nthe Queen is so anxious to see the struggle brought to an early\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes to see Lord John to-morrow at three o'clock, when she\r\nhopes that he will be able to submit a definitive step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: ENGLAND AND PORTUGAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n_14th March 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes again to call Lord John Russell's serious attention\r\nto the state of Spain and Portugal, and to the policy which has been\r\npursued with regard to them, and the result of this policy. In Spain\r\nwe have taken up the cause of the Progressistas, and what has been the\r\nconsequence? They desert us.\r\n\r\nWe have no longer the slightest influence in that country; France has\r\nit all her own way, and we shall see the Cortes confirm the succession\r\nof the Infanta and her children without being able to prevent it. Of\r\nthe Progressistas, on whom Lord Palmerston, Lord Clarendon, and others\r\nalways placed their hopes, Mr Bulwer says _now_: \"The fact is, that\r\nthough they are the party least servile to France, they are the most\r\nimpracticable party, and belonging to a lower class of society, who\r\nhave not the same feelings of honourable and gentlemanlike conduct\r\nwhich sometimes guide a portion, though a very small one, of their\r\nopponents.\"\r\n\r\nIn Spain therefore it is, the Queen fears, _too late_; but let us not\r\nthrow away this lesson, and, if it is still possible, not also lose\r\nPortugal. Our influence there is fast going, and Sir H. Seymour[1]\r\nconfirms what _every one_ but Mr Southern has stated for the last\r\ntwo months, viz. that we are believed to be favourable to the rebels;\r\nconsequently, that no advice of ours will be listened to. Sir H.\r\nSeymour further says: \"I should have been glad to have gained a little\r\ntime, and not at the outset of my mission to be obliged to call the\r\nGovernment to account upon various scores. Your orders, however,\r\nleave me no option, and I shall be obliged to administer a series of\r\nreproofs which will, I fear, confirm the notion as to our unfriendly\r\nfeelings.\" This is the course the Queen thinks so very unfortunate;\r\ntrifles about two horses, the beating of a gardener of Lord Howard's\r\nby some soldiers on a march in times of Civil War, etc., are made\r\ntopics of serious complaint. Most peremptory notes are written,\r\nthreatening the Government with our men-of-war, whilst it is held to\r\nbe unwise to threaten the insurgents.\r\n\r\nThen, the Court is told to believe _our feelings of attachment_ for\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nSir H. Seymour says that his position is rendered very difficult in\r\nconsequence. We have now the results before us. Let us, therefore,\r\nbefore Portugal, our ancient ally, turns also away from us, and leans\r\nto France or Spain in preference, as she _must_, if we give her such\r\ndoubtful support, try to pursue a more conciliatory course; these\r\nperemptory and dictatory notes, these constant complaints, produce the\r\nworst and most unfortunate effect.\r\n\r\nThese very Septembristas have been always the greatest enemies\r\nof England, and would be the first to turn against us should they\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThere should more latitude be given to the resident Minister not\r\nto press things at moments when they produce embarrassment to a\r\nGovernment already _tottering_, but to give him the option of waiting\r\nfor a fit opportunity, and for the manner in which it is to be done,\r\nwhich a person on the spot can be a better judge of than we can in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOnce more the Queen earnestly warns Lord John of the imminent danger\r\nof England losing _all_ legitimate influence in Portugal, which ought\r\nnow, more than ever, to be of the greatest _importance_ to us.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has in all this _spoken_ solely of English influence, but\r\nthis influence becomes of still greater importance to her when the\r\nSovereigns of that country are her near and dear relations.[2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Envoy Extraordinary at Lisbon.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: This letter at once bore fruit, a conference\r\n    being held in London between the representatives of Great\r\n    Britain, Spain, France, and Portugal, and armed co-operation\r\n    to enforce the acceptance of certain terms by the\r\n    Revolutionary Junta being decided upon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE SEPTENNIAL ACT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _19th March 1847._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty. Lord John\r\nRussell thinks it right to state to your Majesty that the prevailing\r\nopinion in the Cabinet is that when the necessary business in the\r\nHouse of Commons has been finished, a Dissolution of Parliament should\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nThis course would be conformable to the usage from the passing of the\r\nSeptennial Act till 1830. From 1830 to the present year no House of\r\nCommons has been allowed to continue six years. The Dissolutions of\r\nLord Grey in 1831 and 1832, of Sir Robert Peel in 1834, the death of\r\nWilliam the Fourth in 1837, Lord Melbourne's Dissolution in 1841, have\r\nall interrupted the natural life of Parliaments. But all Governments\r\nsince the accession of the House of Hanover have been of opinion (with\r\none or two exceptions) that it is hazardous to allow a Parliament to\r\ncontinue seven years, as circumstances may arise making a Dissolution\r\nvery detrimental to the public welfare.\r\n\r\nThese being general considerations, Lord John Russell would reserve\r\nany decision on the subject till the moment shall arrive when a\r\nDissolution may appear to your Majesty's advisers to be the course\r\nmost likely to secure moderate and fair elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n_25th March 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen with pleasure approves the appointment of Lord Clarendon's\r\nbrother to the vacant stall at St Paul's. The Queen would, however,\r\ndraw Lord John's attention generally to the mode of filling up\r\nthose Church sinecures. She is quite aware how necessary it is for a\r\nMinister to be able to recommend to such places persons of political\r\nconnections, but she thinks that where it can be done, it would be of\r\ngreat use both to the Church and the country to give these places\r\nof emolument to Churchmen distinguished for their _scientific\r\nattainments_, who have neither the means nor the time to prosecute\r\ntheir researches, whilst their labours might be of the greatest\r\nimportance to the country. Such person of this kind, for instance,\r\nthe Prince thinks, is a Mr Cureton, who has just published the _real_\r\nepistles of St Ignatius, which he translated from the Syriac, and\r\nis about to produce a Gospel of St Matthew which is considered the\r\nundoubted original in the Coptic dialect, and other most important\r\ndocuments lately acquired for the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: FOREIGN OFFICE DRAFTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _17th April 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has several times asked Lord Palmerston, through Lord\r\nJohn Russell and personally, to see that the drafts to our Foreign\r\nMinisters are not despatched _previous_ to their being submitted to\r\nthe Queen. Notwithstanding, this is still done, as for instance to-day\r\nwith regard to the drafts for Lisbon.

The old Duke will do _every_ thing\r\nto set matters right.\r\n\r\nTo-night we are going to the Opera in state, and will hear and see\r\nJenny Lind[5] (who is perfection) in _Norma_, which is considered one\r\nof her best parts. Poor Grisi is quite going off, and after the pure\r\nangelic voice and extremely quiet, perfect acting of J. Lind, she\r\nseems quite _passee_.

He submits to your Majesty the expression of his sorrow and\r\nshame that your Majesty should be troubled for a moment by anything so\r\ninsignificant as a statue of himself.\r\n\r\nWhen he first heard of the intention to remove the statue from the\r\npedestal on which it had been placed, he was apprehensive that the\r\nmeasure might be misconstrued and misrepresented in this country as\r\nwell as abroad.\r\n\r\nThat feeling was increased when the probable existence of such\r\nmisconstruction was adverted to in one of the printed papers\r\ncirculated by the Committee for the erection of the statue; and still\r\nfarther when the removal became the subject of repeated discussions in\r\nParliament. His daily experience of your Majesty's gracious reception\r\nof his endeavours to serve your Majesty; and the events of every\r\nday, and the repeated marks which he received of your Majesty's\r\nconsideration and favour proved clearly, as the Duke stated in his\r\nletter to Lord John Russell, that there was no foundation for the\r\nmisconstruction of the intended act--which undoubtedly existed. The\r\napprehension of such misconstruction had from the first moment created\r\nan anxious wish in the mind of the Duke that the removal should be so\r\nregulated and should be attended by such circumstances as would\r\ntend to relieve the transaction from the erroneous but inconvenient\r\nimpression which had been created.\r\n\r\nThe Duke apprehended that he might find it impossible to perform the\r\nduties with which he had been entrusted, and therefore, when Lord John\r\nRussell wrote to him, he deprecated the measure in contemplation;\r\nand he rejoices sincerely that your Majesty has been most graciously\r\npleased to countermand the order for the removal of the statue.\r\n\r\nAll of which is most humbly submitted to your Majesty by your\r\nMajesty's most dutiful Subject and most devoted Servant,\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON.[6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: The Duke of Wellington wrote to Croker, 19th\r\n    of December 1846:--\"I should desire never to move from my\r\n    principles of indifference and non-interference on the subject\r\n    of a statue of myself to commemorate my own actions.\"\r\n\r\n    And again, on the 14th of June 1847, the Duke wrote to\r\n    Croker:--\"It has always been my practice, and is my invariable\r\n    habit, to say nothing about myself and my own actions.\r\n\r\n    \"More than forty years ago Mr Pitt observed that I talked\r\n    as little of myself or my own acts as if I had been an\r\n    assistant-surgeon of the army....\r\n\r\n    \"I follow the habit of avoiding to talk of myself and of what\r\n    I have done; with the exception only of occasions when I am\r\n    urging upon modern contemporaries measures which they don't\r\n    like, and when I tell them I have some experience, and\r\n    have had some success in these affairs, and feel they would\r\n    experience the benefit of attending to my advice, I never talk\r\n    of myself.\r\n\r\n    \"These are the reasons for which they think that I don't care\r\n    what they do with the statue.\r\n\r\n    \"But they must be idiots to suppose it possible that a man who\r\n    is working day and night, without any object in view excepting\r\n    the public benefit, will not be sensible of a disgrace\r\n    inflicted upon him by the Sovereign and Government whom he is\r\n    serving.

Although the Queen had hoped that her esteem and\r\nfriendship for the Duke was so well known to the public in general\r\nas not to render such a construction possible, and although she had\r\nthought that another pedestal would have been more suitable for _this_\r\nstatue, and that the Arch might have been more becomingly ornamented\r\nin honour of the Duke than by the statue _now_ upon it, she has given\r\nimmediate direction that the Statue should remain in its present\r\nsituation, and only regrets that this monument should be so unworthy\r\nof the great personage to whose honour it has been erected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDIAN AFFAIRS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Hardinge to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_27th July 1847._\r\n\r\nLord Hardinge, with his most humble duty to your Majesty, humbly\r\nacknowledges the letter in which your Majesty has been graciously\r\npleased to approve of his conduct in the Government of your Majesty's\r\nEastern Empire, and to sanction his return to Europe the end of this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIt will always be a source of happiness to Lord Hardinge to have\r\ncontributed his efforts towards maintaining the stability of your\r\nMajesty's Indian possessions committed to his charge, and he feels, in\r\nthe performance of these duties, that the approbation of his Sovereign\r\nis the most grateful distinction to which honourable ambition can\r\naspire.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General entertains the most sanguine expectations that\r\npeace has been securely established beyond the north-west frontiers,\r\nas well as throughout India, and in this confidence he has ordered\r\nnearly 50,000 men of the native force to be reduced, which reductions\r\nhave caused no discontent, being for the most part voluntary on the\r\npart of the men and accompanied by gratuities in proportion to the\r\nservice performed.\r\n\r\nAs regards internal dangers, there is no native power remaining able\r\nto face a British army in the field. The people are very generally\r\nengaged in trade and agriculture, and to a great extent in the British\r\nProvinces no longer carry arms. Confidence in the protection of the\r\nGovernment has superseded the necessity. Formerly trade and wealth\r\nwere concentrated in a few large cities--and Indian manufactures have\r\nbeen ruined by cheaper goods sent from England; but wealth and comfort\r\nhave, under British rule, been more extensively diffused through the\r\nagricultural districts, and all classes, including the warlike tribes,\r\nare becoming more devoted to the happier and safer pursuits of peace.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things Lord Hardinge entertains a very confident\r\nexpectation that the Government of India, by judicious attention\r\nto the native army in time of peace--which may have its peculiar\r\ndangers--will maintain due subordination in its ranks; and by\r\nabstaining from all interference in the religious prejudices of the\r\npeople, will secure their loyal attachment to your Majesty, and their\r\nwilling obedience to the Governor acting in your Majesty's behalf.\r\n\r\nLord Hardinge has the honour to subscribe himself your Majesty's most\r\nhumble and dutiful Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nHARDINGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A GENERAL ELECTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _5th August 1847._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to state that he considers the elections which have taken\r\nplace since he last addressed your Majesty as satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal gains, upon the whole, have been upwards of thirty, and\r\nwhen the elections are concluded will probably be upwards of forty.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of so distinguished a man as Mr Macaulay[7] is the most\r\ndisgraceful act in the whole election. It has only a parallel in the\r\nrejection of Mr Burke by the city of Bristol.\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole elections will be, even if Sir George Grey\r\nis defeated in Northumberland, that neither Lord John Russell or any\r\nother Minister will have the command of a regular party majority.\r\n\r\nBut it is probable that Government will be sufficiently strong to\r\nresist both a reaction against free trade, and any democratic movement\r\nagainst the Church or the aristocracy.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: In consequence of his vote on Maynooth.

Leinster, Orford, Westmorland, are familiar instances.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has drawn up a paper respecting the Irish elections,\r\non which the Prince wished to have his remarks. The subject is a dark\r\nand a dreary one....\r\n\r\nChanges of Ministry may occur, but it is to be hoped that your Majesty\r\nmay be enabled to keep the present Parliament for five or six years.\r\nFor nothing tends so much to favour such reformations, to impede\r\nsober improvements, and to make members stand in servile awe of their\r\nconstituents, as frequent General Elections.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell is happy to see in the newspapers the successful\r\nprogress of your Majesty's journey. It has occurred to Lord John\r\nRussell that as the harvest is very promising, and the election heats\r\nwill have subsided, it may be desirable that your Majesty should go\r\nfor three days to Ireland on your Majesty's return. The want of notice\r\nmight in some respects be favourable, and would be an excuse to many\r\nIrish peers, who might otherwise complete their ruin in preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Earl Fitzwilliam._\r\n\r\n_3rd September 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Fitzwilliam's letter of the 31st.[8] As\r\nshe sees Lord Strafford's elevation to an Earldom already announced in\r\nthe _Gazette_ of the same day, it will be impossible for the Queen to\r\nhave the question of Lord Fitzwilliam's adverse claim reconsidered.\r\nShe thinks it right, however, to say, that, knowing that the Wentworth\r\nproperty came to Lord Fitzwilliam, it was only after the Heralds\r\nCollege had proved that Lord Strafford was the representative of the\r\nEarl of Strafford of the Second Creation, whilst Lord Fitzwilliam\r\nwas not properly considered the representative of the first, that the\r\nQueen approved the selection of the title of Earl of Strafford for the\r\npresent Lord. The Queen is very sorry to find that this step should\r\nhave been annoying to Lord Fitzwilliam, for whom she has ever\r\nentertained a sincere regard. She has sent his letter on to Lord John\r\nRussell.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: On John, Baron Strafford, who as Sir John Byng\r\n    had been distinguished in the Peninsula and at Waterloo,\r\n    receiving the Earldom of Strafford, Lord Fitzwilliam had\r\n    written: \"Your Majesty has, undoubtedly, the power of\r\n    conferring this, or any other titular dignity, according to\r\n    your good pleasure, but I venture to hope that, if it be your\r\n    Majesty's pleasure to revive the Earldom of Strafford, it will\r\n    not be bestowed upon any other person than the individual who\r\n    has now the honour of addressing your Majesty.\r\n\r\n    \"The name and history of the first Earl of Strafford is, of\r\n    course, familiar to your Majesty, and I venture to conclude\r\n    that your Majesty is not unaware of my being his descendant,\r\n    his heir, and his successor. I own his lands, I dwell in his\r\n    house, I possess his papers, and, if neither my father nor\r\n    myself have ever applied to the Crown for a renewal of his\r\n    titles, it has not been because either of us was indifferent\r\n    to those honours or to the favour of the Sovereign, but\r\n    because we were well aware of the embarrassment which\r\n    such applications frequently occasion to the Crown and its\r\n    advisers.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MISSION TO THE VATICAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nARDVERIKIE, _3rd September 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's two letters of the 31st\r\nand 1st inst., and is glad to find that the views expressed in the\r\nPrince's Memorandum coincide with those entertained by Lord John and\r\nLord Palmerston, and also by Lord Minto, as she infers. As it seems\r\ndifficult to find a person of inferior rank and position than Lord\r\nMinto, and of equal weight, the Queen sanctions his undertaking\r\nthe mission on the understanding that the object of it will be\r\ncommunicated beforehand to the Courts of Vienna and Paris, and that\r\nboth these Governments will be made fully acquainted with the position\r\nEngland thinks herself bound to take with regard to the Italian\r\ncontroversy.[9] After this shall have been done, the sending of Sir\r\nWilliam Parker with his fleet to the West Coast of Italy strikes the\r\nQueen as a very proper measure to give countenance to the Sovereigns\r\nengaged in Liberal Reform, and exposed alike to the inroads of their\r\nabsolutist neighbour, and to the outbreaks of popular movements\r\ndirected by a republican party, and perhaps fostered by the Austrian\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Lord John Russell proposed that Lord Minto\r\n    should be sent on a special mission to the Vatican. _See_\r\n    Introductory Note for the Year, _ante_, p. 115.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nARDVERIKIE, _7th September 1847._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I thank you much for your kind letter of the 28th.\r\nMamma writes me _such_ a good report of you both, which gives us the\r\ngreatest pleasure.

The\r\nGovernment can in no way be accused of these murders, but there is\r\n_no_ doubt that the _standard of morality_ is _very low_ indeed, in\r\nFrance, and that the higher classes are extremely unprincipled. This\r\nmust shake the security and prosperity of a nation. In my opinion,\r\nnothing has gone on so well since the _unfortunate_ false move of the\r\nSpanish marriages, and I think you will admit _que cela n'a pas\r\nporte bonheur au Roi_. I am very anxious to explain that I was out of\r\nspirits, and, I fear, humour, when I wrote to you last, for I _love_\r\nthis place dearly, and the quiet, simple and wild life we lead here,\r\nparticularly, in spite of the _abominable_ weather we have had; and\r\nI _am not_ the enemy of _La Chasse_, as I expressed myself--on the\r\ncontrary, I am very keen about it, and am only annoyed at being unable\r\nto see it all. Really, when one thinks of the _very dull life_, and\r\nparticularly the life of constant _self-denial_, which my poor, dear\r\nAlbert leads, he deserves _every_ amusement in the world, and even\r\nabout his amusements he is so accommodating that I am deeply touched\r\nby it. He is very fond of shooting, but it is all with the greatest\r\nmoderation. Do you know that you never wished Albert joy of his\r\nbirthday?\r\n\r\nThe state of politics in Europe is very critical, and one feels _very_\r\nanxious for the future.\r\n\r\nWith my dearest Albert's love, and mine, to my beloved Louise.

He has\r\nseen the Governor (Mr Morris) and Deputy-Governor (Mr Prescott) of the\r\nBank, Mr Jones Loyd[11] and Mr Newman. Sir Charles Wood has seen many\r\nothers connected with the City, and they have both made statements to\r\nthe Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe general result is: That an unsound state of trade has prevailed\r\nfor some time.\r\n\r\nMore failures may be expected.[12]\r\n\r\nThe funds may fall still lower.\r\n\r\nAny interference by Government in the way of issuing more notes might\r\npostpone but would aggravate the distress.\r\n\r\nThe railway calls add much to the present difficulty.\r\n\r\nNo forcible interference with railways would be justifiable, but\r\na voluntary postponement of the execution of their Acts might be\r\nproposed to Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by this short summary that the persons who by official\r\nposition, practical experience, and much reflection are most capable\r\nof giving an opinion think that little or nothing can be done by\r\nParliament or by Government.\r\n\r\nIt is one of those revulsions in trade which take place periodically,\r\nincreased in extent by the expansion of commerce, but controlled in\r\nits operation by the sound principles of currency which have lately\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1844 is generally blamed, but without the least reason.\r\nThe accommodation afforded by the Bank has been large, liberal, and\r\ncontinuous. The circulation of notes approaches nineteen millions.\r\n\r\nUpon fully considering the difficulty of finding a person of ability\r\nand experience to place at the head of the Poor Law Commission, Lord\r\nJohn Russell has come to the conclusion that the best course he can\r\ntake is to propose to Mr Cobden to accept the Presidency with a seat\r\nin the Cabinet, and to propose to the Duke of Bedford at the same time\r\na seat in the Cabinet without office.\r\n\r\nVarious reasons for making this offer to Mr Cobden will occur to your\r\nMajesty. His ability, his popularity with the working classes, and his\r\nknowledge of sound principles of political economy are undoubted. Sir\r\nRobert Peel's tribute to him has raised him both on the Continent\r\nand in this country, so that his presence in the Cabinet would give\r\nsatisfaction to many.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the landed nobility and gentry would be glad to see\r\nthe Duke of Bedford take part in the deliberations of the Government.\r\n\r\nWith your Majesty's permission Lord John Russell will propose these\r\narrangements to the Cabinet to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHe has sent for Mr Lee[13] to offer him the Bishopric of Manchester.\r\nIt is with great regret he states that Mr Stephen[14] is obliged from\r\nill health to retire from the Colonial Office. He has asked Lord Grey\r\nto be made a Privy Councillor, having received an assurance from Lord\r\nStanley that Sir Robert Peel would propose it to your Majesty on his\r\nretirement. Lord John Russell submits the proposal to your Majesty as\r\nan honour due to Mr Stephen's long, able, and calumniated[15] public\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has the honour to submit a letter of Lord\r\nClarendon's in reference to a Memorandum of His Royal Highness Prince\r\nAlbert.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell thinks that in the present state of affairs, the\r\nabolition of the Lord-Lieutenancy must not be thought of, and that\r\nwith the exception noticed by Lord Clarendon, the suggestions made by\r\nthe Prince would be the best measures for adoption, when that event\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\nIt is possible the Prince may not have a copy of the Memorandum.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Afterwards Lord Overstone.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: There had been many failures in London,\r\n    Liverpool, and elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: James Prince Lee, then Headmaster of King\r\n    Edward's School, Birmingham, Bishop of Manchester, 1847-1869.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: James Stephen, Under-Secretary for the\r\n    Colonies, 1836-1847, afterwards Professor of Modern History at\r\n    Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: He had made enemies by supporting the abolition\r\n    of slavery.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _14th October 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter, bringing several\r\nvery important subjects before her. She regrets that the state of the\r\nMoney Market should still be so uncomfortable, but is sure that the\r\nGovernment cannot by any interference do much to mend matters, though\r\nit might easily render them still more complicated, and make itself\r\nresponsible for a crisis, which it has in no way either brought on or\r\nbeen able to avert.[16]\r\n\r\nAs to Mr Cobden's appointment to the Poor Law Board, the Queen thinks\r\nthat he will be well qualified for the place in many respects, and\r\nthat it will be advantageous to the Government and the Country that\r\nhis talents should be secured to the service of the State, but the\r\nelevation to the Cabinet directly from Covent Garden[17] strikes her\r\nas a very sudden step, calculated to cause much dissatisfaction in\r\nmany quarters, and setting a dangerous example to agitators in general\r\n(for his main reputation Mr Cobden gained as a successful agitator).\r\nThe Queen therefore thinks it best that Mr Cobden should first enter\r\nthe service of the Crown, serve as a public functionary in Parliament,\r\nand be promoted subsequently to the Cabinet, which step will then\r\nbecome a very natural one.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford's entrance into the Cabinet the Queen would see\r\nwith great pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the Prince's Memorandum to Lord John, whilst she has\r\nretained Lord Clarendon's letter upon it, which the Prince is anxious\r\nto keep if Lord John will allow him. The Queen must agree with Lord\r\nJohn and Lord Clarendon that the present moment is not a favourable\r\none for the experiment of abolishing the Lord-Lieutenancy.\r\n\r\nMr Stephen's elevation to the Privy Council will be a very proper\r\nreward for his long and faithful services. Would he not be a proper\r\nperson for one of the new Civil degrees of the Bath?[18]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Matters, however, became worse, and Lord John\r\n    Russell and Sir Charles Wood wrote recommending that the Bank\r\n    should enlarge their discounts and advances, for which they\r\n    would propose a bill of indemnity.

How little honourable our line\r\nof policy appears according to this version, which the Queen is afraid\r\nis so very plausible that it will be received as the truth by the\r\nwhole French public and a great part of the European public at large!\r\nIt is, no doubt, perverted, but still the Queen must admit that our\r\npolicy, and especially Mr Bulwer's conduct at Madrid, lays itself\r\nopen to similar construction. After the gross duplicity and immorality\r\nwhich characterised the conduct of France with respect to the Spanish\r\nmarriages, though she had all the profit and we all the loss, still\r\nwe had a very strong position on the side of integrity, morality, and\r\nhonour. The Queen is afraid that the diplomatic intrigues and counter\r\nintrigues at Madrid have made us lose daily more of that advantageous\r\nposition without _any_ compensation on the other side. The Queen\r\nentreats Lord John Russell not to underrate the importance of keeping\r\nour foreign policy beyond reproach. Public opinion is recognised as a\r\nruling power in our domestic affairs; it is not of less importance in\r\nthe society of Europe with reference to the conduct of an individual\r\nstate. To possess the _confidence_ of Europe is of the utmost\r\nimportance to this country. That is the reason why the Queen is\r\nuneasy about our dealings in Greece, and anxious that we should not\r\nbe misunderstood with respect to Italy. The Queen is sorry to perceive\r\nthat the French complain of unfair dealing on our part with reference\r\nto the negotiations in the River Plate.[19] Have they any right to do\r\nso? Have Lord Howden's private instructions been at variance in any\r\nway with the public instructions which had been agreed upon with the\r\nFrench Government? The Queen would consider any advantage gained at\r\nthe expense of an ally as a loss.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Sir John Hobart Caradoc, second Lord Howden,\r\n    British Minister at Rio Janeiro, was, together with Count\r\n    Walewski, the French Minister there, engaged in a special\r\n    mission to the River Plate and Uruguay; Buenos Ayres was\r\n    blockaded by the British Fleet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN OF SPAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th October 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has perused with eagerness Mr Bulwer's accounts of the late\r\nextraordinary events in Spain, but must confess that she has in\r\nvain looked for an explanation of the real motives and causes of the\r\ncrisis. Has Lord Palmerston received any private letters throwing more\r\nlight upon the matter? There seems to prevail the greatest mystery\r\nabout the affair. Is the Queen reconciled with her husband? Has she\r\nsent for him? Have all the accounts of her hatred for Don Francisco\r\nand the Queen-Mother been false? All these questions are unanswered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN OF PORTUGAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _30th October 1847._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nmany apologies to make for not having attended your Majesty's Council\r\nto-day, and the more so as his absence arose from an inadvertence\r\nwhich he is almost ashamed to mention. But having got on horseback\r\nto ride to the station, with his thoughts occupied with some matters\r\nwhich he was thinking of, he rode mechanically and in a fit of absence\r\nto the Nine Elms Station,[20] and did not recollect his mistake till\r\nhe had got there; and although he made the best of his way afterwards\r\nto the Paddington Station, he could not get there in time for any\r\ntrain that would have taken him early enough to Windsor.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston received this morning your Majesty's remarks upon\r\nhis proposed drafts to Sir Hamilton Seymour, and has modified some of\r\nthe expressions in those drafts; but those drafts are only private\r\nand confidential answers in his own name to private and confidential\r\ncommunications from Sir Hamilton Seymour, and they express only his\r\nown personal opinions, and not those of the Government.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston is sorry to say that the circumstances lately\r\nmentioned by Sir Hamilton Seymour, coupled with the course pursued\r\nat Lisbon almost ever since the successful interference of the Allied\r\nPowers, have brought Viscount Palmerston to the painful convictions\r\nexpressed in the above-mentioned drafts, and he feels desirous, for\r\nhis own sake, to place those convictions at least upon record in this\r\nOffice. He will be most happy to find that he is mistaken, and will\r\nmost truly and heartily rejoice if events should prove that the\r\nconfidence which your Majesty reposes in the sincerity and good faith\r\nof the Queen of Portugal is well founded; but in a matter of this\r\nimportance Viscount Palmerston feels that it is his bounden duty to\r\nyour Majesty not to conceal his opinions, even though they should,\r\nas in the present case, unfortunately differ from those which your\r\nMajesty entertains.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: The former terminus of the London and\r\n    South-Western Railway.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _21st October 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen acknowledges Lord Palmerston's letter of yesterday. She can\r\nhave no objections to Lord Palmerston's putting on record his opinion\r\nthat the Queen of Portugal is leaning to the Chartist Party, and\r\nexposing herself, her Throne and country, to great danger by so\r\ndoing; but she would _much_ deprecate the putting on record the grave\r\naccusation \"that the Queen of Portugal is in a secret and perfect\r\nunderstanding with the Cabrals,\"[21] which is really not warranted by\r\nthe facts of the case, and is likely to mislead both our Government\r\nand the Minister at Lisbon. Since the Queen wrote yesterday the Prince\r\nreceived a letter from the King of Portugal (which he sent to Lord\r\nPalmerston), and which quite explains the position and views of\r\nthe Court: we must not forget either that Sir Hamilton Seymour\r\nacknowledges that a change of Ministry at this moment would provoke\r\na fresh Revolution at Lisbon. Although this would come from the\r\nCabralists, the Queen of Portugal very naturally may not feel inclined\r\nto run that risk to avoid a danger the existence of which she does not\r\nsee or comprehend.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: The Ministry in which Castro Cabral had been\r\n    Premier, and his brother, Jose, Minister of Justice, had\r\n    resigned in May 1846.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE HAMPDEN CONTROVERSY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _10th November 1847._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nafter reflecting on the various reasons in favour of, and objections\r\nagainst, different Bishops for promotion to the Archbishopric of York,\r\nhe humbly submits to your Majesty the name of Dr Musgrave, Bishop of\r\nHereford, to be appointed Archbishop of York.

I have ventured to write direct to\r\nHer Majesty, to express to her my grateful feelings at this notice of\r\nme. But I have been so afraid of offending by anything like freedom\r\nof expression that I much fear I have instead said coldly and formally\r\nwhat, if I had said it naturally, would have expressed the deepest and\r\nmost exuberant feelings of what I trust I may venture to say is not an\r\nungrateful heart. Ungrateful it would be most certainly if it did\r\nnot feel to its deepest core the uniform and great kindness I have\r\nreceived now for so many years from Her Majesty and from the Prince. I\r\nwish I could better show them my feelings....\r\n\r\nYou have read no doubt the _Times_ article on Dr Hampden. I am\r\nafraid it is too true. I cannot conceive _what_ was Dr Hampden's\r\nrecommendation. He was not a persecuted man, for he had got a station\r\nfar higher than he ever dreamed of already; he is not an able, or\r\nan active man, or one popular with any party, and unless Lord John\r\nRussell wished for an opportunity of shocking the young confidence\r\nof the Church in him, I cannot conceive why he should have made it.\r\nI deeply lament it. Pray let me hear of your health, if it be only\r\na single line (to Cuddesdon), and believe me to be, ever your truly\r\naffectionate,\r\n\r\nS.

It gives an official declaration of\r\nthe views of England with respect to a point of the greatest gravity\r\nand importance, and upon which the Queen apprehends that the mind\r\nof the Cabinet is not yet made up. The Queen herself has come to no\r\ndetermination upon it, and it may involve the question of peace\r\nor war. Surely our line of policy under future and uncertain\r\ncontingencies ought not to be pledged beforehand and in such an\r\nindirect way.

Lord John will always have found the\r\nQueen desirous to meet his views with regard to all appointments and\r\nready to listen to any reasons which he might adduce in favour of\r\nhis recommendations, but she must insist upon appointments in her\r\nHousehold not being made _without_ her previous sanction, and least of\r\nall such as that of a _Physician to her person_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Dominic John Corigan, M.D.,\r\n    Physician-in-Ordinary to Her Majesty in Ireland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SWITZERLAND]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER FROM THE KING OF PRUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of Prussia to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n[_Translation._]\r\n\r\n_25th November 1847._\r\n\r\n... I hear with delight and thankfulness that it has pleased your\r\nMajesty to agree to a Conference for regulating the dreadful Swiss\r\nquarrels.[24] I took the liberty to propose my beloved and truly\r\namiable town of Neuchatel as the place for the Conference, not only\r\nbecause its position in neutral territory and in Switzerland\r\nherself qualifies it above every other place for that purpose, but\r\n_particularly_ because this meeting of the representatives of the\r\ngreat Powers there would protect it and the courageous and faithful\r\ncountry of Neuchatel from indignities, spoliation, and all the\r\n_horrors_ which oppress at this moment the unfortunate and far from\r\ncourageous Fribourg. I am afraid that your Majesty has not a full\r\nappreciation of the people and the partisans who fill Switzerland\r\nwith murders and the miseries of the most abominable Civil War. Your\r\nMajesty's happy realms have centuries ago passed through the \"phase\"\r\nof such horrors, and with you the state of parties has been (as one\r\nsays here) grown in bottles,[25] under the glorious Constitution given\r\nby God and History, but _not_ \"made\"; but there, in Switzerland, a\r\nparty is becoming victorious!!! which, notwithstanding the exercise\r\nof Christian charity, can only be called \"_Gottlos und Rechtlos_\"\r\n(without God and without right). For Germany, the saving of\r\nSwitzerland from the hands of the Radicals is _simply_ a _vital\r\nquestion_. If they are victorious there, in Germany likewise torrents\r\nof blood will flow; I will answer for that. The murder of Kings,\r\nPriests, and Aristocrats is no empty sound with them, and Civil War in\r\nsong, writing, word, and deed, is their watchword. \"Toute charite bien\r\nentendue commence par soi-meme.\" So they begin with their own country,\r\ntrue to this \"Christian\" (!) motto. If they are allowed to proceed,\r\nsurely they _won't stop there_. Thousands of emigrated malefactors\r\nwait only for a sign (which their comrades and allies in Germany will\r\nnot be backward in giving) to pour forth beyond the German frontier.\r\nIn Germany the PEOPLE are just as little fond of them as they were in\r\nSwitzerland, but the experience of Switzerland teaches us that\r\nthat alone cannot stem their victorious march, if circumstances are\r\nfavourable to them. The German people rely upon their Governments, and\r\ndo nothing, but Governments are weakened by the modern Liberalism\r\n(the precursor of Radicalism, as the dying of chickens precedes\r\nthe Cholera) and will have to take the consequences of their own\r\nnegligence. Notwithstanding people and princes, that godless band will\r\nmarch through Germany, because, though small, it is strong through\r\nbeing united and determined. All this I have pondered in my head and\r\nheart (led, so to say, by the hand of History), and that has prompted\r\nme now to propose that the German Confederation (which _en parenthese_\r\nincludes a population of more than forty millions) should appear\r\nas one of the great Powers of Europe at the settlement of the Swiss\r\ndispute, and should be admitted as such by the other great Powers.\r\n_Would your Majesty do justice, and give_ PROTECTION _to this\r\nidea_?...\r\n\r\nF. W.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: _See_ Introductory Note for the year, _ante_, p.\r\n    115.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: As old wine improves by being kept in bottles.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S REPLY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of Prussia._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _5th December 1847._\r\n\r\nSince your letter was written events have followed each other so\r\nrapidly that at this moment the war in Switzerland may be considered\r\nas terminated; by the capitulations of the Cantons formerly\r\nconstituting the Sonderbund, _two_ parties, between which a mediation\r\nof the great Powers could have taken place, have ceased to exist, and\r\nconsequently mediation and the Conference resulting from it are in\r\nfact no longer necessary or possible. I had proposed London as\r\nthe place of conference, but should with pleasure have waived this\r\nproposition to adopt the place which you have expressed a wish of\r\nseeing fixed for that purpose, viz. Neuchatel, and I should have felt\r\ntruly happy if by so doing I could have met your wishes, and given\r\nfurther protection to the principality against possible aggressions\r\non the part of the Federal Government of Switzerland. As matters\r\nnow stand, the only complication which might arise is that between\r\nNeuchatel and the Diet. I have, in anticipation of any such event,\r\ninstructed Sir Stratford Canning to exert himself to his utmost to\r\ndissuade the Diet from any plan of aggression on your territory, and\r\nhe has been furnished with an able and elaborate state paper for his\r\nguidance, which Chevalier Bunsen had drawn up, discussing the legal\r\nmerits of the case. Should events prove that Sir S. Canning did\r\nnot arrive in time, or had not the power of averting a hostile step\r\nagainst Neuchatel, you may rely upon my readiness at all times to\r\nput my good offices at your disposal. Should a conference upon Swiss\r\naffairs still become necessary, I conceive that the only plea upon\r\nwhich the great Powers could meet in conference would be their having\r\nguaranteed the independence and neutrality of Switzerland, and by\r\nimplication the Federal Compact amongst the Cantons. This has not been\r\nthe case with regard to the German Confederation, and I do not readily\r\nsee in consequence how the Confederation could be admitted into this\r\nConference, however much I confess I would like to see Germany take\r\nher place amongst the Powers of Europe, to which her strength and\r\npopulation fairly entitle her. I may say that my Government are\r\nequally impressed with me with the importance of German unity and\r\nstrength and of this strength weighing in the balance of power\r\nof Europe; I am sure that the English public generally share this\r\nfeeling, but I must not conceal from your Majesty that much would\r\ndepend upon the manner in which this power was represented. Much\r\nas the English would like to see this power represented by the\r\nenlightened councils of your Majesty, they would be animated with very\r\ndifferent feelings in seeing it in the hands of Prince Metternich ...\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _19th December 1847._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge the receipt of several letters from\r\nLord John Russell. She was pleased to see that the Debates have been\r\nbrought to such a satisfactory conclusion, all the propositions of\r\nthe Government having passed with such good majorities. The Queen must\r\nmention to Lord John that she was a little shocked at Sir Charles Wood\r\nin his speech upon the Commission of Inquiry, designating the _future\r\nGovernment_, and selecting Lord George Bentinck, Mr Disraeli(!), and\r\nMr Herries as the persons destined to hold _high offices_ in the next\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Bishops behave extremely ill about Dr Hampden, and the Bishop of\r\nExeter[26] is gone so far, in the Queen's opinion, that he might be\r\nprosecuted for it, in calling the Act settling the supremacy on the\r\nCrown a _foul act_ and _the Magna Charta of Tyranny_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is glad to hear that Lord John is quite recovered. We are\r\ngoing to Windsor the day after to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter, 1830-1869.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MELBOURNE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROCKET HALL, _30th December 1847._\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has\r\nreceived with great pleasure your Majesty's letter of this morning,\r\nand reciprocates with the most cordial heartiness your Majesty's good\r\nwishes of the season, both for your Majesty and His Royal Highness.\r\nLord Melbourne is pretty well in health, perhaps rather better than he\r\nhas been, but low and depressed in spirits for a cause which has long\r\npressed upon his mind, but which he has never before communicated to\r\nyour Majesty. Lord Melbourne has for a long time found himself much\r\nstraitened in his pecuniary circumstances, and these embarrassments\r\nare growing now every day more and more urgent, so that he dreads\r\nbefore long that he shall be obliged to add another to the list of\r\nfailures and bankruptcies of which there have lately been so many.\r\nThis is the true reason why Lord Melbourne has always avoided the\r\nhonour of the Garter, when pressed upon him by his late Majesty\r\nand also by your Majesty. Lord Melbourne knows that the expense of\r\naccepting the blue ribbon amounts to L1000, and there has been of late\r\nyears no period at which it would not have been seriously inconvenient\r\nto Lord Melbourne to lay down such a sum.[27]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: The Queen, through the agency of Mr Anson,\r\n    advanced Lord Melbourne a considerable sum of money, which\r\n    seems to have been repaid at his death. Apparently Lord\r\n    Melbourne's declining health caused him to magnify his\r\n    difficulties. The report which Mr Anson made shows that he was\r\n    in no sense seriously embarrassed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the year 1848 great alarm was felt throughout England\r\nat the supposed inadequacy of her defences, a panic being caused by\r\nthe indiscreet publication of a confidential letter from the Duke of\r\nWellington to Sir John Burgoyne, to the effect that in his judgment\r\nthe whole South Coast was open to invasion, and that there were no\r\nmeans of opposing a hostile force. The Government turned its attention\r\nto reconstructing the Militia, and raising the Income Tax for\r\nthe purpose. But the outlook was completely changed by the French\r\nRevolution; Louis Philippe, who had just lost his sister and\r\ncounsellor, Madame Adelaide, impulsively abdicated, on a rising\r\ntaking place, and escaped with his family to this country. England and\r\nBelgium were unaffected by the outburst of revolution which convulsed\r\nEurope: the Emperor of Austria was forced to abdicate, and Metternich,\r\nlike Guizot, became a fugitive; Prussia was shaken to her foundation,\r\nand throughout Germany the movement in favour of representative\r\ninstitutions made rapid headway; a National Assembly for Germany was\r\nconstituted, and Schleswig was claimed as an integral part of the\r\nGerman dominions. In Italy also the Revolution, though premature, was\r\nserious. The Pope, not yet reactionary, declared war against Austria;\r\nthe Milanese rose against Radetzky, the Austrian Governor, and King\r\nCharles Albert of Sardinia marched to their assistance. A republic was\r\nproclaimed in Venice, but these successes were afterwards nullified,\r\nand a Sicilian rising against Ferdinand II. of Naples was suppressed.\r\nIn France the revolutionary movement held steadily on its course, a\r\nNational Assembly was elected, and national workshops established;\r\nLouis Bonaparte, who had been a fugitive in England, was allowed\r\nto return, and was elected President of the Republic by an immense\r\nmajority of the popular vote.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Revolution had no success in England; a very serious\r\nriot at Glasgow was dispersed, and the meeting convened by Feargus\r\nO'Connor for the 10th of April on Kennington Common, which was to\r\ncarry a huge petition in favour of the People's Charter to the House\r\nof Commons, proved a ridiculous _fiasco_. Ireland was much disturbed\r\nduring the year by what was known as the Young Ireland agitation,\r\na movement organised by youthful, and for the most part cultivated,\r\nleaders, and utterly different from the sturdy Repeal movement\r\nof O'Connell. Smith O'Brien, brother of Lord Inchiquin, was the\r\nringleader, and was backed by Mitchel, Duffy, Meagher, and others,\r\nas well as by the _Nation_ and _United Irishman_ newspapers. Like\r\nChartism, the movement ignominiously collapsed and its leaders were\r\nconvicted of treason. An Act was at the same time passed reducing\r\nsome offences (till then legally defined as treason) to felonies, and\r\nimproving the law as to offences against the person of the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe treacherous murder of two Englishmen in the Punjab led to\r\noperations against the Sikhs, Lord Dalhousie--who had recently\r\nbecome Viceroy--after some hesitation, reinforcing Lord Gough, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and proceeding in person to the frontier; a\r\nBritish force sustained a reverse at Ramnuggur on 22nd November, and a\r\ndecisive result was not arrived at till 1849.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, a proclamation by Sir Harry Smith, the Governor of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, extending British sovereignty over the country\r\nbetween the Orange and Vaal rivers, led to a collision with the Boers,\r\nand ultimately to the founding of the Transvaal State. Sir Harry Smith\r\ndefeated the Boers on the 29th of August at Boom Platz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n1848\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _1st January 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--This is a most melancholy beginning of the\r\nyear. Our poor Aunt Adelaide,[1] so kind to us, has departed this life\r\nyesterday morning. Poor Louise feels it dreadfully, as nothing could\r\nbe more affectionate and more motherly than she was for Louise. She\r\nwas always very kind and friendly to me, and I must confess I feel the\r\nblow much. I am very much alarmed about the poor King; he must feel\r\nthe loss of a sister and friend so entirely devoted to him deeply;\r\nit is the thing most likely to hurt and shake his health. You will\r\nforgive if I cut short here, as I am much disturbed by this melancholy\r\nevent. I think you would act kindly in writing to the King. We are too\r\nnearly connected not to do it, and it will soothe him, who has been\r\nenough persecuted since last year. I trust you begin better than we do\r\nthis most melancholy January. My best love to Albert, and believe me\r\never, my dearest Victoria, your truly and devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Sister of King Louis Philippe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF MADAME ADELAIDE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._[2]\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _3rd January 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends Lord John Russell a letter from her Uncle, the King\r\nof the Belgians, which will show how dreadful a blow Mme. Adelaide's\r\ndeath will be to the King of the French and Royal Family. The Queen's\r\nfirst thought was to write to the King, which she would not have done\r\nwithout first mentioning it to Lord John; but upon reflection\r\nshe thought it quickest and best to write _at once_ to her cousin\r\nClementine (Princess Augustus of Saxe-Coburg), to convey in her name\r\nto the King her sincere sympathy at this melancholy event. The King of\r\nthe Belgians' letter has, however, brought back to the Queen her first\r\nthought of writing to the King, and she wishes to know what Lord John\r\nthinks of it. The Queen thinks it as undignified as unfeeling to carry\r\non political coolness at moments like these, when her own feelings of\r\nsympathy are so strong and so sincere. The Queen would certainly under\r\nother circumstances have instantly written to the King. On the other\r\nhand, her first letter to her cousin (the King's daughter) may be\r\nsufficient, as it conveys a direct message; and there may be people\r\nwho will construe this into a political act, but the Queen thinks that\r\nthis risk should rather be run than that she should appear unfeeling\r\nand forgetful of former kindness and intimacy.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would be glad to have Lord John's opinion on this subject as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: This letter is headed \"Reproduction--Substance of\r\n    a letter to Lord John Russell, written from recollection.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _3rd January 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--I thank you _most sincerely_ for your\r\nkind last letter, and all your good wishes for the New Year. Alas! the\r\nyear _ended_ and _began_ in a _most painful_ and _heartrending way\r\nfor us_. The loss of my good, excellent, beloved Aunt is an _immense\r\nmisfortune_ for _us all_, and the most _dreadful blow_ for my poor\r\nFather. We are all broken-hearted by this, at last _unexpected_ event.\r\nSome years we were uneasy about my poor Aunt's health, and of late\r\nI had been particularly alarmed by what I heard of her increasing\r\nweakness; but I was very far from believing that her end was _so\r\nnear_. I was only anxious for the winter. At least her end was\r\npeaceful. She went to sleep and did not wake more. She died without a\r\nstruggle; the horror of death, and the still greater pang of the last\r\nfarewell, of the last leave-taking of her beloved brother, was spared\r\nher. I thank God for _this_ proof of His mercy, and hope He will\r\nkeep up my Father under _such a heavy affliction_. To him the loss is\r\n_irretrievable_. My Aunt lived _but_ for him; one may almost say\r\nthat her affection alone had kept her alive these last years, and a\r\ndevotion like hers--that devotion of all instants--so complete, so\r\nfull of self-denial--cannot, will never, be replaced. A heart _like\r\nhers_, so true, so noble, so warm, so loving, so devoted, is _rarely_\r\nseen. To us also, independently of my Father, the loss is a _dreadful_\r\none. My Aunt was a second mother for us; we loved her and looked up to\r\nher in this way, and certainly few mothers do for their children what\r\nshe did for us, or loved them better. We are overwhelmed with grief by\r\nthe sudden disappearance of a being _so dear_ and _so necessary_ to us\r\nall, and we go to-morrow to Paris, to mourn with the remainder of the\r\nfamily, and offer my poor Father the only consolation he can feel at\r\nthis cruel moment, that of being surrounded by all those he loves.\r\nI have still so much to do previous to our melancholy journey that\r\nI cannot say more to-day. I am sure you will excuse me. I shall, God\r\nwilling, write in a more proper way the next time. In the meanwhile I\r\nthank God that you are _unberufen_ all well, and, in sorrow or in joy,\r\nI am equally, my beloved Victoria, from the bottom of my heart, yours\r\nmost devotedly,\r\n\r\nLOUISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER TO KING LOUIS PHILIPPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWOBURN ABBEY, _4th January 1848._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nno hesitation in saying that he thinks your Majesty will do well to\r\nfollow your own kind impulse to write a letter to the King of the\r\nFrench. There will be some persons, and M. Guizot perhaps among the\r\nnumber, who will construe this into a political act; but it is better\r\nto be subject to such misconstructions than to leave undone any act of\r\nsympathy to the King of the French in his sore affliction.\r\n\r\nShould the King attempt to found upon your Majesty's letter any\r\npolitical intercourse, Lord John Russell has no doubt that your\r\nMajesty will explain to him that your present proceeding is entirely\r\nfounded upon private regard, and past recollections of intimacy, and\r\nis not intended as an opening for political correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the French._\r\n\r\nCH.

The weather is very cold, and\r\nit is the third night of a black frost which is likely to continue\r\nfor some days. Many thanks for your kind letter of the 7th, which,\r\naccording to the new arrangement, I received already on the 8th.\r\nYour visit will, I fear, have been a very melancholy one. Poor Mme.\r\nAdelaide's death was so extremely sudden, it must be a dreadful blow\r\nto the poor King. I _have_ written to him. Louise will have told you\r\nthat poor Aunt Sophia[4] is decidedly sinking.\r\n\r\nI wish, dearest Uncle, if even Louise feels unequal to coming to us\r\nnow (which would be a _sad disappointment_), _you_ would come to see\r\nus. Why not come while she is at Paris? It would be such a pleasure to\r\nus. You will of course have no balls, and you might come even sooner\r\nthan you originally intended. Pray do see if you could manage this. I\r\nam sure you could. If Louise could come, of course that would be still\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAlbert desires me to ask you the following favour, viz. if you\r\nwould give us the picture that is here of Grand Uncle Frederic (the\r\nField-Marshal), that we might hang it up in London, where we have made\r\na fine collection of his contemporaries, and we would replace it by\r\na faithful copy, which could be hung up in the frame here. Will you\r\ngrant this?\r\n\r\nWe are very desirous of getting the Woods and Forests to build a small\r\n_glass dome_ to the greenhouse here where the palm-trees are, and (if\r\nyou approved) there could be no difficulty in getting this done; the\r\npalm-trees are beautiful, and will be quite stunted and spoilt if not\r\nallowed to grow. We shall stay here till Monday next. With Albert's\r\nlove, ever your truly devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Fifth daughter of George III., born 1777.

Your kind letter to the\r\npoor King was an act for which I thank you from the bottom of my soul,\r\nbecause it made him so happy. I was still in his rooms--where the\r\nfamily has been breakfasting and dining till now--when your letter\r\narrived; he was so delighted with it that he _kissed it most\r\ntenderly_. I left him tolerably well on Monday, but with rather a\r\nsevere cold. He had certainly at the end of December the Grippe,\r\nwhich perhaps was the immediate cause of poor Aunt's death, as from\r\nover-anxiety for her beloved brother, she got up in the night to find\r\nout how he was. His cold had been better when he went to Dreux, then\r\nhe met the procession, and walked with it bareheaded to the church;\r\nthis seems to have given him a new cold. His nerves are also a good\r\ndeal shaken, and this renders him very irritable. He is much occupied\r\nabout some of the arrangements connected with poor Aunt's fortune;\r\nshe left her landed property to Nemours, Joinville, and Montpensier,\r\ncharged with the various sums she left to nearly all the branches of\r\nher family. The King is to have, however, the enjoyment of the whole\r\nof this fortune for his life. His great wish would be to employ the\r\nrevenues, from the whole of the succession legacies as well as landed\r\nproperty, to free the landed property of the mortgage of the various\r\nlegacies. This will require a good many years, and I told him that it\r\nwould force him to live till it would be arranged, which will easily\r\nrequire ten years. In France a good feeling has been shown on this\r\noccasion. I heard from trustworthy quarters that even people who were\r\nknown to be personally not very kind to the King, expressed themselves\r\nmost anxious for his preservation. Whenever that sad event will take\r\nplace, the reaction in Europe will be great, as all the bad passions\r\nwhich are kept down by him will then of course try to get the over\r\nhand. The Queen is much affected by all this, and thinks much of her\r\nown end. The children, including good Helene, have all behaved\r\nwith the utmost affection to their parents, and nothing can equal\r\nparticularly good Nemours' devotion and attention. My beloved Child,\r\nyour truly devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: REVOLUTION IN FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _12th February 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... From Paris the news are alarming;[5] the\r\nstruggle of the Liberal Party leaning towards radicalism, or in fact\r\nmerely their own promotion; principles are _out_ of the question. This\r\nstate of affairs reacts in a very lamentable way upon the well-being\r\nof the great European community. Great complaints are made that the\r\nworking classes are deprived of work and at the same time political\r\nagitation is kept up, which must have the effect of stopping\r\ntransactions of every description. The human race is a _sad_ creation,\r\nand I trust the other planets are better organised and that we may get\r\nthere hereafter.... Your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: The Republican movement had been making rapid\r\n    headway in Paris, and the leader of the Opposition, M.

On the 25th of\r\n    February he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"The National Guards, mixed with the people, were in full\r\n    march upon the Tuileries, and the latter threatening the life\r\n    of the King, when Emile Girardin, the editor of the _Presse_\r\n    newspaper, who was in advance as an officer of the National\r\n    Guard, hastily drew up an Act of Abdication, and placed it\r\n    before the King as the only means of safety. The King at\r\n    first refused, saying that he would rather die; but the Duc de\r\n    Montpensier urged him, not only for his own sake, but to save\r\n    his country from confusion. The King at last signed it,\r\n    and threw it impatiently at the Duc de Montpensier, who,\r\n    I believe, has been in favour of conciliatory counsel\r\n    throughout. The Royal Family then retired through the garden,\r\n    the King saying to every one as he passed, 'J'abdique,\r\n    j'abdique.'\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _26th February 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I am very unwell in consequence of the _awful_\r\nevents at Paris.

God has permitted\r\nevents which decisively threaten the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is an attempt to \"spread the principles of the Revolution by\r\n_every_ means throughout the whole of Europe.\" This programme binds\r\ntogether both these individuals and their parties. The consequences\r\nfor the peace of the world are _clear_ and _certain_. If the\r\nrevolutionary party carries out its programme, \"The sovereignty of\r\nthe people,\" my minor crown will be broken, no less certainly than the\r\nmighty crowns of your Majesty, and a fearful scourge will be laid upon\r\nthe nations; a century [will follow] of rebellion, of lawlessness, and\r\nof godlessness. The late King did not dare to write \"by the Grace\r\nof God.\" _We_, however, call ourselves King \"by the Grace of God,\"\r\nbecause it is true. Well, then, most gracious Queen, let us now show\r\nto men, to the peoples threatened with disruption and nameless misery,\r\nboth _that_ we understand our sacred office and _how_ we understand\r\nit. God has placed in your Majesty's hands, in the hands of the two\r\nEmperors, in those of the German Federation, and in mine, a power,\r\nwhich, if it now acts in union and harmony, with reliance on Heaven,\r\nis able humanly speaking, to enforce, with certainty, the maintenance\r\nof the peace of the world. This power is _not that of arms_, for\r\nthese, more than ever, must only afford the _ultima ratio_.\r\n\r\nThe power I mean is \"the power of united speech.\" In the year 1830\r\nthe use of this immeasurable power was criminally neglected. But now I\r\nthink the danger is much more pressing than it was then. This power is\r\ndivided among _us_ in equal portions. I possess the smallest portion\r\nof it, and your Majesty has by far the greatest share. That share is\r\nso great that your Majesty, by your powerful word, might alone carry\r\nout the task. But the certainty of victory lies, subject to the Divine\r\nblessing, solely in our utterance being united. This must be our\r\nmessage to France; \"that all of us are cordial well-wishers to France;\r\nwe do not grudge her all possible welfare and glory; we mean never to\r\nencroach on it, and we will stand by the new Government as by the old,\r\n_foi de gentils-hommes_. But the first breach of the peace, be it with\r\nreference to Italy, Belgium, or Germany would be, undoubtedly and at\r\nthe same time, a breach with 'all of us,' and we should, with all the\r\npower that God has given us, let France feel by _sea_ and by _land_,\r\nas in the years '13, '14, and '15, what our union may mean.\"\r\n\r\n_Now_ I bless Providence for having placed Lord Palmerston at the head\r\nof your Foreign Office, and keeping him there at this very moment.\r\nDuring the last quarter of the past year I could not always cordially\r\nagree with him. His genuine British disposition will honour this open\r\nconfession. All the more frankly may I now express the hopes which\r\nrise in me, from the very fact of _his_ holding that office at the\r\npresent moment; for a more active, more vivid, more energetic Minister\r\nof foreign affairs, a man that would more indefatigably pursue great\r\naims, your Majesty could probably never have. If at this grave hour\r\nhe sets himself to proclaim that our forces are united; if he himself\r\nutters his message as befits St George, he will earn the blessing of\r\nmillions, and the blessing of God and of the world will rest on your\r\nMajesty's sacred head. That I am your Majesty's and _Old England's_\r\nmost faithful and most devoted brother and companion, you are aware,\r\nand I mean to prove it. On both, knees I adjure you, use, for the\r\nwelfare of Europe, \"_Engellands England_.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words I fall at your Majesty's feet, most gracious Queen,\r\nand remain your Majesty's most faithfully devoted, most attached\r\nServant and good Brother,\r\n\r\nFREDERIC WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n_P. S._--The Prince I embrace. He surely feels with me, and justly\r\nappraises my endeavours.\r\n\r\n_Post scriptum, 28th, in the evening._\r\n\r\nI venture to open my letter again, for this day has brought us news\r\nfrom France, which one can only call _horrible_. According to what\r\nwe hear, there is no longer left a King in France. A regency, a\r\ngovernment, and the most complete anarchy has ensued, under the name\r\nof the Republic--a condition of things in which, at first, there will\r\nbe no possibility of communicating with the people, infuriated with\r\ncrime. In case a Government should evolve itself out of this chaos, I\r\nconscientiously hold that the \"united word\" of the great Powers, such\r\nas I have indicated in the preceding pages, should be made known,\r\n_without any modification, to the new holders of power_. Your\r\nMajesty's gracious friendship will certainly not take amiss this\r\naddition to my letter, though it be not conformable to strict\r\netiquette.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the poor old King, of the Duchess of Orleans, of the whole\r\nhonourable and amiable family, cuts me to the heart, for up to this\r\ntime we do not know what has become of any of them. We owe Louis\r\nPhilippe eighteen happy years of peace. No noble heart must forget\r\nthat. And yet--who would not recognise the avenging hand of the King\r\nof kings in all this?\r\n\r\nI kiss your Majesty's hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER FROM QUEEN LOUISE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ANXIETY OF QUEEN LOUISE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Queen of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS, _28th February 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--_What a misfortune! What_ an _awful,\r\noverwhelming, unexpected_ and _inexplicable catastrophe_. _Is it\r\npossible_ that we should witness _such events_, and that _this_ should\r\nbe the end of nearly eighteen years of courageous and successful\r\nefforts to maintain order, peace, and make France happy, what _she\r\nwas_? I have heard, I read hourly, _what has happened: I cannot\r\nbelieve it yet_; but if _my beloved parents_ and the remainder of\r\nthe family are at least _safe_ I won't mind the rest. In the hours of\r\nagony we have gone through I asked God _only_ to spare _the lives_,\r\nand I ask still _nothing else_: but we don't know them yet _all_\r\nsaved, and till I have heard of my unfortunate parents, of my unhappy\r\nbrothers far away, of all those for whom I would lay my life at any\r\nmoment and whose danger I could not even share or alleviate, I cannot\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nI was _sure_, my beloved Victoria, of all _you_ would _feel for us_\r\nwhen you would hear of these awful events. I received yesterday your\r\ntwo kind, warm, sympathising letters of the 25th and 26th, and thank\r\nyou with _all my heart_ for them, and for yours and Albert's share and\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n_Our anguish_ has been _undescribable_. We have been _thirty-six hours\r\nwithout any news_, not knowing even if my parents and the family were\r\nstill alive or not, and what had been their fate. Death is not worse\r\nthan what we endured during these horrible hours. We don't know yet\r\nwhat to think, what to believe, I would almost say, what to wish; we\r\nare _stunned_ and _crushed_ by the awful blow. What has happened is\r\n_unaccountable, incomprehensible_; it appears to us like a _fearful_\r\ndream. Alas! I fear my dear beloved father was led away by his\r\n_extreme courage_; by that same courage which had made his success and\r\na part of his strength; for it is strange to say that even those that\r\ndeplored most his resolution never to yield on certain things gave him\r\ncredit for it. The exaggeration of the system of peace and resistance,\r\nor rather _immobility_, lost him, as that of war lost Napoleon. Had he\r\nshunned less war _on all occasions_, and granted in time some trifling\r\nreforms, he would have satisfied public opinion, and would probably\r\nbe still where he was _only eight days ago_, strong, beloved, and\r\nrespected! Guizot's accession has been _as fatal_ as his fall, and\r\nis perhaps the _first cause_ of our ruin, though my father cannot be\r\nblamed for having kept him in office, as he had the majority in the\r\nChamber, and an overwhelming one. _Constitutionally_, he could not\r\nhave been turned out, and it was _impossible to foresee_ that when\r\nall was quiet, the country prosperous and happy, the laws and\r\nliberty respected, the Government strong, a _Revolution_--and _such\r\na Revolution_--would be brought on by a few imprudent words, and the\r\nresistance (lamentable as it was) to a manifestation which, in fact,\r\nthe Government had a right to prevent. _It was the Almighty's will:\r\nwe must submit._ He had decreed our loss the day He removed my beloved\r\nbrother[7] from this world. Had he lived still, all this would\r\nhave turned otherwise. It has been also an immense misfortune that\r\nJoinville and Aumale were both away. They were both popular (which\r\npoor dear _never-to-be-sufficiently-respected_ Nemours was _not_),\r\nenergetic, courageous, and capable of turning chance in our favour.\r\nOh! _how I long_ to know what is become of them! I cannot live till\r\nthen, and the thought of my unfortunate parents _annihilates_ me! Poor\r\ndear Joinville had foreseen and foretold almost all that has happened,\r\nand it was the idea of the crisis he apprehended which made him so\r\nunhappy to go. He repeated it to me several times six weeks ago. Alas!\r\n_nobody_ would believe him, and who _could believe_ that in _a day_,\r\nalmost without struggle, _all would be over_, and the past, the\r\npresent, the future carried away on an unaccountable storm! _God's\r\nwill be done!_ He was at least _merciful_ to my dear Aunt, and I hope\r\nHe will preserve all those dear to me!\r\n\r\nHere everything is quiet: the horror general, and the best feeling\r\nand spirit prevailing. There is still now nothing to fear: but if _a\r\nrepublic really established_ itself in France, it is impossible to\r\ntell what may happen. For this reason your Uncle thinks it right that\r\nwe should remove to some place of safety what we have of precious.\r\nIf you permit I will avail myself of the various messengers that are\r\ngoing now to send _under your care_ several boxes, which you will\r\nkindly send to Claremont to Moor, to keep with those your Uncle\r\nalready sent. They contain your Uncle's letters and those of my\r\nparents--the treasure I most value in the world.\r\n\r\n_29th._--MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--This was written yesterday, in\r\na moment of comparative quiet, when I thought my parents at least safe\r\nand in security in England. Albert's letter to your Uncle of the 27th,\r\nwhich arrived yesterday evening, says they were _not arrived yet_, and\r\nI am again in the most horrible agony. I had also yesterday evening\r\ndetails of their flight (_my father flying!!!_) by Madame de Murat,\r\nVictoire's lady, who has gone to England, which quite distracted me.\r\nThank God that Nemours and Clem at least _are safe!_I am quite unable\r\nto say more, and I hope the Duchess and Alexandrine will excuse me if\r\nI don't write to them. Truly, I _can't_. I thank you only once more,\r\nmy beloved Victoria, _for all your kindness_ and _interest_ for my\r\nunfortunate family, and trust all the anxiety you feel for us won't\r\nhurt you. God bless you ever, with all those dear to you. Believe me\r\nalways, my beloved Victoria, yours most devotedly,\r\n\r\nLOUISE.\r\n\r\nI send you no letter for my mother in the present uncertainty.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The Duc d'Orleans, who was killed on 13th July\r\n    1842.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _29th February 1848._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to transmit a short note from Lord Normanby, which is very\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell declared last night that your Majesty would not\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of France. But in repeating this\r\ndeclaration, in answer to Mr Cobden, he added that the sacred duties\r\nof hospitality would be, as in all times, performed towards persons of\r\nall opinions. Both declarations were generally cheered. In extending\r\nthis hospitality to members of the Royal Family of France, it is only\r\nto be observed that no encouragement should be given by your Majesty\r\nto any notion that your Majesty would assist them to recover the\r\nCrown. In this light it is desirable that no _Prince_ of the House\r\nof Orleans should inhabit one of your Majesty's palaces in or near\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW FRENCH GOVERNMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\n(_Undated._)[8]\r\n\r\nThe Queen has perused the enclosed despatches and the proposed Minutes\r\nof a draft to Lord Normanby with Lord John Russell's remarks.

We have just had sad experience of\r\n_cordial_ understandings. \"Friendly relations\" might do better or\r\nthe whole sentence might run thus: \"that not peace only but cordial\r\nfriendship with France _had been at all times_ [instead of \"is one\r\nof the,\" etc.] one of the first wishes of the British Government, and\r\nthat this _will_ remain,\" etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Apparently written at the end of February.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ESCAPE OF KING LOUIS PHILIPPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st March 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Every hour seems to bring fresh news and events.\r\nVictoire and her children and Montpensier are at Jersey, and are\r\nexpected to arrive to-morrow. About the King and Queen, we still know\r\nnothing, but we have some clue, and think _he may be_ somewhere on the\r\ncoast, or even _in_ England. We do everything we can for the poor\r\ndear Family, who are indeed most dreadfully to be pitied; but you will\r\nnaturally understand that we cannot _make cause commune_ with them and\r\ncannot take a hostile position opposite to the new state of things\r\nin France; we leave them alone, but if a Government which has the\r\napprobation of the country be formed, we shall feel it necessary to\r\nrecognise it, in order to pin them down to maintain peace and the\r\nexisting Treaties, which is of great importance. It will not be\r\npleasant for us to do this, but the public good and the peace of\r\nEurope go before one's feelings. God knows what _one feels_ towards\r\nthe French. I trust, dear Uncle, that you will maintain the fine and\r\nindependent position you are now in, which is so gratifying to us, and\r\nI am sure you will feel that much as we all must sympathise with\r\nour poor French relations, you should not for that quarrel with the\r\nexisting state of things, which however is very uncertain. There were\r\nfresh reports of great confusion at Paris, which is sure to happen.\r\nAll our poor relations have gone through is worthy only of a\r\n_dreadful_ romance, and poor Clem behaves beautifully, courageously,\r\nand calmly, and is full of resignation; but she can get no sleep, poor\r\nthing--and hears the horrid cries and sees those _fiend-like\r\nfaces_ before her! The children are very happy with ours, but very\r\nunmanageable. I saw the Duchesse de Montpensier to-day.\r\n\r\nNow, with every wish for _all_ going on well, believe me ever, your\r\ndevoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR FEATHERSTONHAUGH]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A GRAPHIC NARRATIVE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Featherstonhaugh[9] to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nHAVRE, _3rd March 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD PALMERSTON,--It was a hair-trigger affair altogether, but\r\nthanks be to God everything has gone off admirably. I was obliged\r\nto abandon the plan of trusting the King in a fishing-boat from\r\nTrouville. The weather was very stormy; had he attempted to find the\r\nsteamer, he might have failed, for the sea was in a furious state and\r\nthe wind ahead. There was also the danger of the fishing-boat being\r\nlost, a contingency the very idea of which made me miserable.\r\n\r\nI therefore abandoned the plan altogether, and after much and careful\r\nreflection determined to execute one more within my control, and the\r\nboldness of which, though trying to the nerves, was its very essence\r\nfor success. It was to bring the King and Queen into Havre itself\r\nbefore anybody could suspect such a dangerous intention, and have\r\neverything ready for their embarkation to a minute. To carry out the\r\nplan, I wanted vigilant, intelligent, and firm agents, and I found\r\nthem as it turned out. It was known to me that the lower classes\r\nsuspected it was M. Guizot concealed at Trouville, and as some\r\nsinister occurrence might reasonably be expected there, I sent a\r\nfaithful person into Calvados. It was high time. The mob had assembled\r\nat the place where the King was, who had to slip out at the back door\r\nand walk two leagues on foot. At length he reached a small cottage\r\nbelonging to a gardener at Honfleur, where the Queen was. This was\r\nhalf-past six o'clock A.M. yesterday. My agent saw the King and Queen,\r\nwho, after some conversation, sent him back with this message, that\r\nthey \"would wait where they were until they again heard from me, and\r\nwould carry out my final arrangements with exactitude, as far as it\r\ndepended upon them.\" I now instructed Captain Paul to be ready at\r\nhalf-past seven P.M., when it would be dark, to have his water hot,\r\nready to get up steam; to have only a rope moored to the quay with an\r\nanchor astern; to expect me with a party a little before eight P.M.,\r\nand as soon as I had got on board with my party and told him to push\r\noff, he was to let me go on shore, cut his rope and cable, get into\r\nthe middle of the Basin, up with his steam and jib and push for\r\nEngland. Not a word was to be spoken on board.\r\n\r\nTo get the King here from Honfleur the following method was adopted:\r\nM. Bresson, a loyal and intelligent officer in the French Navy and\r\nwell known to the King, and Mr Jones, my Vice-Consul and principal\r\nClerk, went in the steam ferry-boat a quarter before five P.M. to\r\nHonfleur. From the landing-place it is three-quarters of a mile to the\r\nplace where the King and Queen were concealed. The ferry-boat was to\r\nleave Honfleur for Havre a quarter before seven o'clock. I had given\r\nM. Bresson a passport for Mr and Mrs Smith, and with this passport the\r\nKing was to walk to the landing-place, where he was to be met by my\r\nVice-Consul and be governed by him.\r\n\r\nIf the _gens d'armes_ disputed his passport Mr Jones was to vouch for\r\nits regularity, and say that he was sent by me to conduct Mr Smith to\r\nHavre, who was my Uncle. M. Bresson was to follow with the Queen,\r\nand the rest of the suite were to come to the ferry-boat one after\r\nanother, but none of the party were to know each other. The ferry-boat\r\nwas to arrive in Havre about half-past seven, and I was to do the\r\nrest. A white pocket-handkerchief was to be twice exhibited as a\r\nsignal that all was right so far. The difficulty of the _gens d'armes_\r\nbeing infinitely more to be provided against and apprehended here, I\r\nfirst confidentially communicated to the greatest gossips in the town\r\nthat I had seen a written statement from an official person that the\r\nKing had reached England in a fishing-boat from the neighbourhood of\r\nTreport, and then got some persons whom I could rely upon, sons of my\r\ntradesmen here who are in the National Guard, to be near the steamer\r\nthat was to receive the King, to give me their assistance if it should\r\nbe necessary, on account of the turbulence of the crowd, to\r\nembark some friends of mine who were going to England. And if an\r\nextraordinary number of _gens d'armes_ were stationed at the steamer,\r\nand they hesitated about letting my Uncle go on board, then about one\r\nhundred yards off I had two persons who were to pretend a quarrel and\r\na fight, to which I knew the _gens d'armes_ would all go as well as\r\nthe crowd. In the meantime I hoped that as Captain Paul made no noise\r\nwith his steam that the crowd would not assemble, and that we might\r\nfind no _gens d'armes_. The anxiously expected moment at length\r\narrived. The ferry-boat steamer came to the quay; it was almost dark,\r\nbut I saw the white pocket-handkerchief. There was a great number of\r\npassengers, which favoured the debarkation. When half of them were\r\nout, the trembling Queen came up the ladder. I took her hand, told her\r\nit was me, and M. Bresson walked with her towards our steamer. At last\r\ncame the King, disguised, his whiskers shaved off, a sort of casquette\r\non his head, and a coarse overcoat, and immense goggles over his eyes.\r\nNot being able to see well, he stumbled, when I advanced, took his\r\nhand and said, \"Ah, dear Uncle, I am delighted to see you.\" Upon which\r\nhe answered, \"My dear George, I am glad you are here.\" The English\r\nabout me now opened the crowd for their Consul, and I moved off to a\r\nquiet and shaded part of the quay. But my dear Uncle talked so loud\r\nand so much that I had the greatest difficulty to make him keep\r\nsilence. At length we reached the steamer; it was like a clock-work\r\nmovement. The crowd was again opened for me. I conducted the King to\r\na state-room below, gave him some information, and having personally\r\nascertained that the Queen was in her cabin, and being very\r\nmuch touched with her tears and her grateful acknowledgments, I\r\nrespectfully took my leave, gave the Captain the word to cut loose,\r\nand scrambled ashore. In twenty minutes the steamer was outside,\r\nsteaming away for England. I drove down to the jetty, and had that\r\nlast satisfaction of seeing her beyond all possibility of recall, and\r\nthen drove home. Much has been said this morning about the mysterious\r\ndeparture of Captain Paul, and I have been obliged to confess that the\r\ngentleman I was seen conducting on board was a brother of the King\r\nof Naples, who was immensely frightened without cause, and that I had\r\nengaged the steamer for him and his family. Many think, however, that\r\nit was the King, but then again that could not be if he crossed over\r\nfrom Treport in a fishing-boat. We have got everybody completely\r\nmystified, and there are only four persons in the secret, who will all\r\nremain in the same story.\r\n\r\nI have scribbled, amidst the most hurried engagements, this little\r\nnarrative, believing that it would interest your Lordship. It has the\r\ninterest of romance and the support of truth. I have the honour to be,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nG. W. FEATHERSTONHAUGH.\r\n\r\nInformation has just reached me that one hour after the King and Queen\r\nleft their hiding-place last night, and just when I was embarking\r\nthem, an officer and three _gens d'armes_ came to the place to arrest\r\nhim. They were sent by the new Republican _Prefet_. It appears that\r\nthe man who gave him refuge had confessed who he was as soon as the\r\nKing had left Trouville, and had betrayed the King's hiding-place at\r\nHonfleur. What an escape! Your Lordship will see a paragraph in the\r\nenclosed newspaper not altogether false. We in the secret know nothing\r\nabout Louis Philippe; we know something about the Count of Syracuse\r\nand something about Mr William Smith. If it leaks out, it must come\r\nfrom England. Here no one has any proof. In the meantime almost\r\neverybody here is delighted to think that he may have escaped.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: British Consul at Havre. This letter was\r\n    submitted to the Queen by Lord Palmerston.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RECEPTION AT CLAREMONT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCARLTON GARDENS, _3rd March 1848._\r\n(3 P.M.)\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that General Dumas has just been with him to announce that\r\nthe King and Queen of the French landed this morning at Newhaven,\r\nhaving been brought over in the Steam Packet Express, in which they\r\nembarked at Havre yesterday evening about eight o'clock.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dumas says that till the morning of their arrival at Dreux the\r\nKing and the Queen imagined that the Comte de Paris had succeeded to\r\nthe Throne, and that the Duchess of Orleans had been declared Regent;\r\nthat when they heard that a Republic and a Provisional Government had\r\nbeen declared they thought it unsafe to remain at Dreux; and that they\r\nthen separated in order to go by different roads to Honfleur, where\r\nthey were to meet at a small house belonging to a friend of\r\nGeneral Dumas. At that house they remained for some days, until Mr\r\nFeatherstonhaugh opened a communication with them. The King then\r\nremoved to Trouville in order to embark from thence in a manner which\r\nMr Featherstonhaugh had arranged, and he remained there two or three\r\ndays for that purpose; but the weather was too stormy, and prevented\r\nhis departure. In the meanwhile the people of Trouville found out who\r\nhe was, and their demonstrations of attachment became inconvenient.\r\nHe therefore returned to Honfleur, and the arrangements were altered.\r\nYesterday evening at seven o'clock the King, the Queen, and General\r\nDumas came to the ferry-boat which plies between Honfleur and Havre,\r\nand were met by the Vice-Consul, who treated the King as uncle of\r\nthe Consul. On landing at Havre the King walked straight down to the\r\nExpress Packet, which was lying ready; the Queen went separately,\r\nand after making a slight round through the streets of Havre embarked\r\nalso; the Packet then immediately started, and went into Newhaven in\r\npreference to any other port, because no Packets start from thence\r\nfor the French coast. General Dumas says that the whole party were\r\nunprovided with anything but the clothes they wore, and he was going\r\nto the King's banker to provide funds to enable him to come to town,\r\nand said that the King begged him to apologise for his not having\r\nat once written to your Majesty to thank your Majesty for the great\r\ninterest which your Majesty has taken in his safety, and for the\r\nassistance, which he has received for his escape, but that he would do\r\nso this evening.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dumas said that the King's present intention is to remain in\r\nEngland in the strictest _incognito_, and that he and the Queen will\r\nassume the title of Count and Countess of Neuilly.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston explained to General Dumas that your Majesty has\r\nmade arrangements for the King's reception at Claremont, and that your\r\nMajesty intended to send down an officer of your Majesty's Household\r\nto communicate with the King.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dumas said that the King would most gratefully avail himself\r\nof the arrangement as to Claremont, but that under all circumstances,\r\nand as the King wished to remain in entire privacy, he thought it\r\nwould be better that no person from your Majesty's Household should\r\ngo down to the King at Newhaven, and that he was sure the King would\r\nrather find his own way from the railway station at London Bridge to\r\nClaremont than attract attention by being met at the station by any of\r\nyour Majesty's carriages.\r\n\r\nThe King would remain to-night at Newhaven, and would come up\r\nto-morrow morning. General Dumas said that the King and the Queen had\r\ngone through much personal fatigue and mental anxiety, but are both\r\nwell in health. The General was going to Count Jarnac before he\r\nreturned to Newhaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING'S GRATITUDE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the French to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nNEWHAVEN, SUSSEX, _3eme Mars 1848._\r\n\r\nMADAME,--Apres avoir rendu graces a Dieu, mon premier devoir est\r\nd'offrir a votre Majeste l'hommage de ma reconnaissance pour la\r\ngenereuse assistance qu'elle nous a donnee, a moi et a tous les miens\r\net que la Providence vient de couvrir d'un succes complet, puisque\r\nj'apprends qu'ils sont tous a present sur la terre hospitaliere de\r\nl'Angleterre.\r\n\r\nCe n'est plus, Madame, que _le Comte de Neuilly_ qui, se rappelant vos\r\nanciennes bontes, vient chercher sous ses auspices, un asyle et une\r\nretraite paisible et aussi eloignee de tout rapport politique que\r\ncelle dont il y a joui dans d'autres temps, et dont il a toujours\r\nprecieusement conserve le souvenir.\r\n\r\nOn me presse tellement pour ne pas manquer le train qui emportera ma\r\nlettre que j'ai a peine le temps de prier votre Majeste d'etre mon\r\ninterprete aupres du Prince votre auguste Epoux.\r\n\r\nMa femme, accablee de fatigue par la vie que nous venons de mener\r\ndepuis dix jours! ecrira un peu plus tard a votre Majeste.

It is like one\r\nof Walter Scott's best tales, and the arrangements and the execution\r\nof them do great credit to Mr Featherstonhaugh, who will be highly\r\ngratified to learn, as Viscount Palmerston proposes to inform him,\r\nthat your Majesty has approved his conduct. Mr Featherstonhaugh has\r\nalso probably rendered a good service to the Provisional Government,\r\nwho would have been much embarrassed if their Commissioner had\r\narrested the King and Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _7th March 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Albert has written to you so constantly that I have\r\nlittle to add; he just tells me this is not quite true. However,\r\nthere is nothing very new except that we have seen the King and Queen;\r\nAlbert went down to Claremont to see them on Saturday, and yesterday\r\nthey came here with Montpensier. They both look very _abattus_,\r\nand the poor Queen cried much in thinking of what she had gone\r\nthrough--and what dangers the King had incurred; in short, humbled\r\npoor people they looked. Dearest Vic I saw on Sunday; _she_ has also\r\ngone through much, and is so dear and good and gentle. She looked\r\nwonderfully well _considering_. They are still _very_ much in want of\r\nmeans, and live on a very reduced scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S VIEW OF THE CRISIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _11th March 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I profit by the departure of Andrews to write to\r\nyou a few lines, and to wish you joy of the continued satisfactory\r\nbehaviour of my friends, the good Belgians; fervently do I hope and\r\nreally trust all will go on well; but what an extraordinary state of\r\nthings everywhere! _\"Je ne sais plus ou je suis,\"_ and I fancy really\r\nthat we have gone back into the _old_ century. But I also feel one\r\nmust not be nervous or alarmed at these moments, but be of good cheer,\r\nand muster up courage to meet all the difficulties.\r\n\r\nOur little riots are mere nothing, and the feeling here is good....\r\n_What_ is _your_ opinion as to the late events at Paris? Do you not\r\nthink the King ought to have retired to Vincenness or somewhere else a\r\nday or two before, and put himself at the head of the army? Ought\r\nnot Montpensier at least to have gone to Vincennes? I know Clem even\r\nthinks this--as also that _one_ ought to have foreseen, and ought to\r\nhave managed things better. Certainly at the _very last_, if they had\r\nnot gone, they would all have been massacred; and _I_ think they were\r\nquite right, and in short could not avoid going as quickly as they\r\ncould; but there is an impression they _fled_ too quickly. Still the\r\nrecollection of Louis XVI.... is enough to justify all, and everybody\r\nwill admit that; but the Princes, they think, ought to have remained.\r\n_What_ do _you_ think of all this? I think the blunders were _all_ on\r\nthe last three or four days--and on the last day, but were no longer\r\nto be avoided at last; there seemed a _fatality_, and _all_ was lost.\r\nPoor Nemours did his best till he could _no longer_ get to the troops.\r\nPeople here also abuse him for letting Victoire go alone--but he\r\n_remained_ to do his _duty_; a little more _empressement_ on her\r\narrival here I would have wished. Albert told you all about the\r\nMontpensiers' journey. It would do the King irreparable mischief if\r\nthey went now to Spain; the feeling of anger would all return. Poor\r\npeople! they are all in a sad state of _want_ at present.\r\n\r\nI must conclude. Hoping to hear from you, and to have your opinion.\r\n\r\nEver your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S SYMPATHY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _15th March 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot let this day pass without offering Lord Melbourne\r\nhers and the Prince's best wishes for many happy returns of it in\r\nhealth and strength.\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne will agree with the Queen that the last three weeks\r\nhave brought back the times of the last century, and we are in the\r\nmidst of troubles abroad. The Revolution in France is a sad and\r\nalarming thing.... The poor King and his Government made many mistakes\r\nwithin the last two years, and were obstinate and totally blind at\r\nthe last till flight was inevitable. But for _sixteen_ years he did a\r\ngreat deal to maintain peace, and made France prosperous, which should\r\n_not_ be forgotten.... Lord Melbourne's kind heart will grieve\r\nto think of the _real want_ the poor King and Queen are in, their\r\ndinner-table containing barely enough to eat. And the poor Nemours\r\nhardly know which way to turn. If the private property be not restored\r\nGod only knows what is to become of these distinguished young Princes\r\nand their little children. What will be their _avenir_? It breaks\r\none's heart to think of it, and the Queen, being so nearly related\r\nto them and knowing them all, feels it very much. Surely the poor\r\nold King is sufficiently punished for his faults. Lord Beauvale will\r\nsurely be shocked at the complete ruin of the family. Has he seen or\r\nheard from his old friend Madame de Montjoye, who is here with the\r\nQueen of the French? The poor dear Queen of the Belgians is quite\r\nbroken-hearted, but, thank God, Belgium goes on admirably. In Germany\r\nalso there are everywhere disturbances, but the good Germans are at\r\nbottom very loyal....\r\n\r\nThe state of Paris is very gloomy; the rabble armed--keeping the\r\nGovernment in awe--failures in all directions, and nothing but ruin\r\nand misery. This is too gloomy a letter for a birthday, and the Queen\r\nmust apologise for it. The Prince wishes to be kindly remembered to\r\nLord Melbourne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CZAR'S VIEW]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Emperor of Russia to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n                    22 Mars\r\nST.

England seems quiet, and even the attempt in\r\nIreland seems to have passed over. But Germany is in an awful state,\r\nbeyond what I ever should have thought possible in that country, and\r\nwith such a good nation. For years, however, all sorts of people had\r\nbeen stirring them up, and half measures, seeming dishonest, of the\r\nSovereigns have done harm. Curious enough that I, who in fact was\r\ndesirous of retiring from politics, should be on the Continent the\r\nonly Sovereign who stood the storm, though I am at ten hours' distance\r\nfrom Paris. I trust we shall be able to go on with our money matters\r\nto enable us to keep up; our working classes are at this moment what\r\noccupies us most, and much has been done, and our Banks, which were\r\nmuch threatened, are now safe.\r\n\r\nWe work hard, and with these few days I suffered a little, but I\r\nam better to-day. Louise is tolerably well; the poor children are\r\nattentive and amiable. Poor things! _their existence_ is a good deal\r\non the cards, and fortunes, private and public, are in equal danger.\r\n\r\nNow I will leave you that you should not be tired. Ever, my beloved\r\nchild, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CHARTIST DEMONSTRATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _4th April 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I have to thank you for three most kind letters, of\r\nthe 18th and 25th March, and of the 1st. Thank God, I am _particularly\r\nstrong_ and _well_ in _every possible respect_, which is a blessing in\r\nthese _awful, sad, heart-breaking_ times. From the first I heard all\r\nthat passed, and my only thoughts and talk were--Politics; but I never\r\nwas calmer and quieter or less nervous. _Great_ events make me quiet\r\nand calm, and little trifles fidget me and irritate my nerves. But\r\n_I feel_ grown old and serious, and the future is very dark. God,\r\nhowever, will come to help and protect us, and we must keep up our\r\nspirits. _Germany_ makes me so sad; on the other hand, Belgium is a\r\nreal pride and happiness.\r\n\r\nWe saw your poor father and mother-in-law with the Nemours, Joinville,\r\nand Aumale yesterday. Still a dream to see them _thus, here!_They\r\nare well in health, and the young people's conduct most praiseworthy;\r\nreally the three Princesses are astonishing, and a beautiful lesson to\r\nevery one. They are so much admired and respected for it. My beloved\r\nVic, with her lovely face, is perfection, and so cheerful. She often\r\ncomes to see me, and this is a great pleasure to me, if only it was\r\nnot caused by such misfortunes!\r\n\r\nNow good-bye.

He thinks this is the only way to avoid a\r\nfight.

I don't feel doubtful for a moment who will be found\r\nthe stronger, but should be exceedingly mortified if anything like a\r\ncommotion was to take place, as it would shake _that_ confidence which\r\nthe whole of Europe reposes in our stability at this moment, and upon\r\nwhich will depend the prosperity of the country. I have enquired a\r\ngood deal into the state of employment about London, and I find, to\r\nmy great regret, that the number of workmen of all trades out of\r\nemployment is _very_ large, and that it has been increased by the\r\nreduction of all the works under Government, owing to the clamour for\r\neconomy in the House of Commons. Several hundred workmen have been\r\ndischarged at Westminster Palace; at Buckingham Palace much fewer\r\nhands are employed than are really wanted; the formation of Battersea\r\nPark has been suspended, etc., etc. Surely this is not the moment for\r\nthe tax-payers to economise upon the working classes! And though\r\nI don't wish our Government to follow Louis Blanc in his system of\r\n_organisation du travail_,[12] I think the Government is bound to do\r\nwhat it can to help the working classes over the present moment of\r\ndistress. It may do this consistently with real economy in its\r\nown works, whilst the reductions on the part of the Government are\r\nfollowed by all private individuals as a sign of the times. I have\r\nbefore this spoken to Lord Morpeth[13] upon this subject, but I wish\r\nto bring it specially under your consideration at the present moment.\r\nEver yours truly,\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Alluding to the _Ateliers Nationaux_, to\r\n    be established under the guidance of a Council of\r\n    Administration.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FEARGUS O'CONNOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _10th April 1848._\r\n(2 P.M.)\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to state that the Kennington Common Meeting has proved a\r\ncomplete failure.\r\n\r\nAbout 12,000 or 15,000 persons met in good order. Feargus O'Connor,\r\nupon arriving upon the ground in a car, was ordered by Mr Mayne[14] to\r\ncome and speak to him. He immediately left the car and came, looking\r\npale and frightened, to Mr Mayne. Upon being told that the meeting\r\nwould not be prevented, but that no procession would be allowed to\r\npass the bridges, he expressed the utmost thanks, and begged to shake\r\nMr Mayne by the hand. He then addressed the crowd, advising them to\r\ndisperse, and after rebuking them for their folly he went off in a cab\r\nto the Home Office, where he repeated to Sir George Grey his thanks,\r\nhis fears, and his assurances that the crowd should disperse quietly.\r\nSir George Grey said he had done very rightly, but that the force at\r\nthe bridges should not be diminished.\r\n\r\nMr F. O'Connor--\"Not a man should be taken away. The Government have\r\nbeen quite right. I told the Convention that if they had been the\r\nGovernment they never would have allowed such a meeting.\"\r\n\r\nThe last account gave the numbers as about 5,000 rapidly dispersing.\r\n\r\nThe mob was in good humour, and any mischief that now takes place will\r\nbe the act of individuals; but it is to be hoped the preparations made\r\nwill daunt those wicked but not brave men.\r\n\r\nThe accounts from the country are good. Scotland is quiet. At\r\nManchester, however, the Chartists are armed, and have bad designs.\r\n\r\nA quiet termination of the present ferment will greatly raise us in\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell trusts your Majesty has profited by the sea air.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: Mr Richard Mayne, Commissioner of Police,\r\n    created a K.C.B. in 1851.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _15th April 1848._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has a letter from Lord Clarendon to-day in better\r\nspirits, but somewhat fearing an outbreak in Dublin to-night. He\r\nspeaks confidently of the disposition of the troops.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell cannot wonder that your Majesty has felt deeply the\r\nevents of the last six weeks. The King of the French has brought\r\nupon his own family, upon France, and upon Europe a great calamity.\r\nA moderate and constitutional Government at home, coupled with an\r\nabstinence from ambitious projects for his family abroad, might have\r\nlaid the foundation of permanent peace, order, and freedom in Europe.\r\nSelfishness and cunning have destroyed that which honesty and wisdom\r\nmight have maintained. It is impossible not to pity the innocent\r\nvictims of the misconduct of Louis Philippe. Still less can one\r\nrefrain from regarding with dread the fearful state of Germany, of her\r\nprinces, her nobles, and her tempest-tossed people.\r\n\r\nThe example of Great Britain, may, however, secure an interval of\r\nreflection for Europe. The next six months will be very trying, but\r\nthey may end with better prospects than we can now behold. It was\r\nimpossible that the exclusion of free speaking and writing which\r\nformed the essence of Prince Metternich's system could continue. It\r\nmight have been reformed quietly; it has fallen with a crash which\r\nspreads ruin and death around.\r\n\r\nLady John is deeply grateful for the congratulations of your Majesty\r\nand the Prince.[15] She is going on well to-day.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: On the birth of a second son.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ALARMING STATE OF IRELAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _16th April 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter. The state of\r\nIreland is most alarming and most anxious; altogether, there is so\r\nmuch inflammable matter all around us that it makes one tremble.\r\nStill, the events of Monday must have a calming and salutary effect.\r\nLord John Russell's remarks about Europe, and the unfortunate and\r\ncalamitous policy of the Government of the poor King of the French are\r\nmost true. But is he not even most to be pitied for being the cause\r\nof such misery? (Though perhaps he does not attribute it to himself),\r\nfor, to see all his hopes thus destroyed, his pride humbled, his\r\nchildren--whom he loves dearly--ruined--is not this enough to make a\r\nman wretched? and indeed much to be pitied; for _he_ cannot feel _he_\r\ncould _not_ have prevented all this. Still Guizot is more to blame;\r\n_he_ was the responsible adviser of all this policy: he is _no_\r\nBourbon, and he ought to have behaved differently. Had the poor King\r\ndied in 1844 after he came here, and before that most unfortunate\r\nSpanish marriages question was started, he would have deservedly gone\r\ndown to posterity as a great monarch. _Now_, what will be his name in\r\nhistory? His fate is a great _moral!_\r\n\r\nWith regard to Germany, Prince Metternich is the cause of half the\r\nmisfortune. His advice was taken by almost all the sovereigns of that\r\ncountry, and it has kept them from doing in time what has now been\r\ntorn from them with the loss of many rights which they need not have\r\nsacrificed. We heard yesterday that the Archduke John[16] had arrived\r\nat Frankfort. This is a wise measure, and may do much good and prevent\r\nmuch evil, as he is a popular and most distinguished prince....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Uncle of the Emperor (Ferdinand I.) of Austria,\r\n    born 1782.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON AND THE QUEEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _17th April 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen not having heard anything from Lord Palmerston respecting\r\nforeign affairs for so long a time, and as he must be in constant\r\ncommunication with the Foreign Ministers in these most eventful and\r\nanxious times, writes to urge Lord Palmerston to keep her informed\r\nof what he hears, and of the views of the Government on the important\r\nquestions before us.\r\n\r\nShe now only gets the Drafts when they are gone.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of the mediation between Denmark and Holstein is too\r\nimportant an event not to have been first submitted to the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCARLTON GARDENS, _18th April 1848._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nregrets much that he has not lately had an opportunity of giving\r\nyour Majesty verbally such explanations as your Majesty might wish to\r\nreceive with respect to the progress of foreign affairs, but Viscount\r\nPalmerston hopes to be able to get down to Broadlands for a few days\r\non Saturday next, and he could easily from thence wait upon your\r\nMajesty on any morning and at any hour your Majesty might be pleased\r\nto appoint.\r\n\r\nAlthough events of the greatest importance have been passing in\r\nrapid succession in almost every part of Europe, the position of\r\nyour Majesty's Government has been one rather of observation than of\r\naction, it being desirable that England should keep herself as free as\r\npossible from unnecessary engagements and entanglements, in order that\r\nyour Majesty may be at liberty to take such decisions as the state of\r\nthings may from time to time appear to render most advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LOYALTY OF BELGIUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBARTON, _18th April 1848._\r\n\r\nDEAREST UNCLE,--Detained here by a heavy shower of rain, I begin my\r\nletter to you and thank you warmly for your dear and kind letter of\r\nthe 15th, which I received yesterday.\r\n\r\n_Truly_ proud and delighted are we at the conduct of the Belgians,[17]\r\nand at their loyalty and affection for you and yours, which I am sure\r\nmust be a reward for all that you have done these seventeen years.\r\nI must beg to say that you are wrong in supposing that no mention is\r\nmade of what took place on the 9th in our papers; on the contrary, it\r\nhas been _most gratifyingly_ mentioned in the _Times_, _Chronicle_,\r\n_John Bull_, _etc._ _You_ are held up as a pattern to the German\r\nSovereigns, and the Belgians as a pattern to the German people.\r\n\r\nIn France, really things go on _dreadfully_.... One does not like to\r\nattack those who are fallen, but the poor King, Louis Philippe,\r\n_has_ brought much of this on by that ill-fated return to a _Bourbon\r\nPolicy_.

If only\r\ndear Germany gets right and if all our interests (those of the smaller\r\nSovereigns) are not sacrified! I cannot say _how_ it distresses and\r\nvexes me, and _comme je l'ai a c[oe]ur_. My good and dear Albert is\r\nmuch worried and works _very_ hard....\r\n\r\nI had a curious account of the opening of the _Assemblee_ from Lady\r\nNormanby.[19] No _real_ enthusiasm, dreadful confusion, and the\r\nBlouses taking part in everything, and stopping the Speakers if they\r\ndid not please them. The opinion is that it cannot last.\r\n\r\nI enclose another letter from Lady Normanby, with an account of the\r\npoor Tuileries, which is very curious and sad; but the respect shown\r\nfor poor Chartres is very touching, and might interest poor dear\r\nLouise, if you think fit to show it her.

In Germany, too, everything looks most anxious,\r\nand I _tremble_ for the result of the Parliament at Frankfort.[21] I\r\nam _so_ anxious for the fate of the poor smaller Sovereigns, which it\r\nwould be infamous to sacrifice. I feel it _much_ more than Albert, as\r\nit would break my heart to see Coburg _reduced_.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind and dear letter of the 13th. Thank God! that\r\nwith you everything goes on so well. I will take care and let Lord\r\nNormanby know your kind expressions. The visit to old Claremont was a\r\ntouching one, and it seemed an incomprehensible dream to see them\r\nall there. They bear up wonderfully. Nothing can be kinder than\r\nthe Queen-Dowager's behaviour towards them all. The poor Duchess of\r\nGloster is again in one of her nervous states, and gave us a dreadful\r\nfright at the Christening by quite forgetting where she was, and\r\ncoming and kneeling at my feet in the midst of the service.

This will be useful to Italy,\r\nand much facilitate the acceptance of the Austrian proposal, as the\r\nQueen feels convinced that as soon as the war shall be terminated, the\r\nquestion of the political constitution of Italy (as a whole) will\r\nhave to be decided. Why Charles Albert ought to get any additional\r\nterritory the Queen cannot in the least see. She thinks it will be\r\nbetter to proceed at once upon the revised Austrian proposal, than\r\nto wait for Italian propositions, which are sure to be ridiculously\r\nextravagant.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: The Austrian Government, in its efforts to\r\n    maintain its ascendency in Lombardy, had sent Baron Hummelauer\r\n    to negotiate with Lord Palmerston.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: The Dukes had both been driven from their\r\n    dominions, while the King (Charles Albert) of Sardinia threw\r\n    in his lot with the cause of United Italy as against Austria,\r\n    which then ruled Lombardy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ENGLAND AND SPAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _23rd May 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Palmerston's letter respecting Spain and\r\nItaly this morning. The sending away of Sir H. Bulwer[24] is a serious\r\naffair, which will add to our many embarrassments; the Queen is,\r\nhowever, not surprised at it, from the tenor of the last accounts from\r\nMadrid, and from the fact that Sir H. Bulwer has for the last three\r\nyears almost been sporting with political intrigues. He invariably\r\nboasted of at least being in the confidence of every conspiracy,\r\n\"though he was taking care not to be personally mixed up in them,\"\r\nand, after their various failures, generally harboured the chief\r\nactors in his house under the plea of humanity. At every crisis he\r\ngave us to understand that he had to choose between a \"revolution and\r\na palace intrigue,\" and not long ago only he wrote to Lord Palmerston,\r\nthat if the Monarchy with the Montpensier succession was inconvenient\r\nto us, he could get up a Republic. Such principles are sure to be\r\nknown in Spain, the more so when one considers the extreme vanity of\r\nSir H. Bulwer, and his probable imprudence in the not very creditable\r\ncompany which he is said to keep. Lord Palmerston will remember that\r\nthe Queen has often addressed herself to him and Lord John, in fear\r\nof Sir H. getting us into some scrape; and if our diplomatists are\r\nnot kept in better order, the Queen may at any moment be exposed\r\nto similar insults as she has received now in the person of Sir H.\r\nBulwer; for in whatever way one may wish to look at it, Sir Henry\r\nstill is _her_ Minister.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes Lord Palmerston to show this letter to Lord John\r\nRussell, and to let her know what the Government mean to propose with\r\nrespect to this unfortunate affair.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Lord Palmerston had written a letter to Bulwer\r\n    (which the latter showed to the Spanish Premier), lecturing\r\n    the Spanish Queen on her choice of Minister. This \"assumption\r\n    of superiority,\" as Sir R. Peel called it, led to a peremptory\r\n    order to Bulwer to leave Spain in twenty-four hours.

By the sympathetic view\r\nwhich you took of my situation, most gracious Cousin, it became\r\nnot only bearable, but even transformed into one that became\r\nproportionately honourable and dignified. This graciousness of yours\r\nhas undoubtedly contributed towards the change of opinion which has\r\nresulted in my favour, and so I owe to you, to the Prince, and to your\r\nGovernment, a fortunate issue out of my calamities. So it is with a\r\nheavy heart that I have now left England, not knowing what future\r\nlies before me to meet--and only knowing that I shall need the\r\nstrengthening rest and tranquillity which my stay in England and an\r\ninsight into her institutions have afforded me in full measure.\r\n\r\nOffering my most cordial remembrances to the Prince, to whom I shall\r\nwrite as soon as possible, I remain, most gracious Cousin, your\r\nfaithful and most gratefully devoted Cousin,\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: The Prince of Prussia, afterwards the Emperor\r\n    William I., having become intensely unpopular at Berlin, had\r\n    been obliged in March to fly for his life, in disguise, _via_\r\n    Hamburg, to England.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ROYAL EXILES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st June 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen had not time the other day to talk to Lord John Russell on\r\nthe subject of the French Royal Family, and therefore writes to him\r\nnow. As it seems now most probable that they, or at least some of\r\nthem, will take up their residence for a lengthened period in this\r\ncountry, and as their position is now a defined one, viz. that of\r\n_exiles_, their treatment should be defined and established.\r\n\r\nAt first everything seemed temporary, and the public were much\r\noccupied with them, inclined to criticise all that was done or was\r\nomitted by the Court; all their movements were recorded in the papers,\r\netc. The lapse of three months has a good deal altered this. They have\r\nlived in complete retirement, and are comparatively forgotten; and\r\ntheir poverty and their resignation to their misfortunes have met with\r\nmuch sympathy! The Queen is consequently anxious to take the right\r\nline; particularly desirous to do nothing which could hurt the\r\ninterests of the country, and equally so to do everything kind towards\r\na distinguished Royal Family in severe affliction, with whom she\r\nhas long been on terms of intimacy, and to whom she is very nearly\r\nrelated. She accordingly wishes to know if Lord John sees any\r\nobjection to the following: She has asked her Cousin, the Duchess of\r\nNemours, to come for two or three nights to see her at Osborne when\r\nshe goes there, _quite_ privately; the Duchess of Kent would bring her\r\nwith her. The Duke will not come with the Duchess, as he says he feels\r\n(very properly) it would be unbecoming in him till their fate (as to\r\n_fortune_, for _banished_ they already are) is decided, to be even\r\nfor a day at Osborne. The Duchess herself wishes not to appear in the\r\nevening, but to remain alone with the Queen and the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe Queen considers that when she is _staying_ in the country during\r\nthe summer and autumn, and any of the branches of the French Royal\r\nFamily should wish to visit her and the Prince, as they occasionally\r\ndo here, she might lodge them for one or two nights, as the distance\r\nmight be too great for their returning the same day. They are exiles,\r\nand _not Pretenders_, as the Duc de Bordeaux and Count de Montemolin\r\nare (and who are _for that reason only not received at Court_). In all\r\ncountries where illustrious exiles related to the Sovereign have been\r\nthey have always been received at Court, as the Duc de Bordeaux, the\r\nDuchesse d'Angouleme, etc., etc., invariably have been at Vienna (even\r\non public occasions), there being a French Ambassador there, and the\r\nbest understanding existing between France and Austria. The Duke of\r\nOrleans (King Louis Philippe) in former times was constantly received\r\nby the Royal Family, and was the intimate friend of the Duke of Kent.\r\nProbably, if their fortunes are restored to them, the French Royal\r\nFamily will go out into society in the course of time, and if the\r\nstate of France becomes consolidated there may no longer exist that\r\nwish and that necessity for _extreme_ privacy, which is so obvious\r\nnow. What the Queen has just mentioned, Lord John must well\r\nunderstand, is not what is _likely_ to take place (except in the case\r\nof her cousin, the Duchess of Nemours) immediately, but only what\r\nmight occasionally occur when we are permanently settled in the\r\ncountry. Of course events _might_ arise which would change this,\r\nand which would render it inadvisable, and then the Queen would\r\ncommunicate with Lord John, and ask his advice again upon the subject.\r\nAll she has suggested refers to the present state of affairs, and,\r\nof course, merely to _strictly_ private visits, and on _no state\r\noccasion_. This is a long letter about such a subject, but the Queen\r\nwishes to be quite safe in what she does, and therefore could not have\r\nstated the case and her opinion in a smaller space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AFFAIRS IN LOMBARDY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _4th June 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the enclosed draft. She has written upon it,\r\nin pencil, a passage which she thinks ought to be added, if the\r\ndraft--though civil--is not to be a mere refusal to do anything for\r\nAustria, and a recommendation that whatever the Italians ask for ought\r\nto be given, for which a mediation is hardly necessary.[26] The Queen\r\nthinks it most important that we should try to mediate and put a stop\r\nto the war, and equally important that the boundary which is to be\r\nsettled should be such a one as to make a recurrence of hostilities\r\nunlikely. The Queen has only further to remark that Lord Palmerston\r\nspeaks in the beginning of the letter only of the Cabinet, and adverts\r\nnowhere to the proposition having been submitted to her.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: War was now raging in Lombardy between the\r\n    Austrians under Marshal Radetzky and the Piedmontese under the\r\n    King of Sardinia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _14th June 1848._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty, and thanks your Majesty\r\nfor the perusal of this interesting letter.\r\n\r\nAn Emperor with a rational Constitution might be a fair termination\r\nof the French follies; but Louis Napoleon, with the Communists,\r\nwill probably destroy the last chance of order and tranquillity.

She considers them as quite fair, but does not wish to\r\nhave Sir H. Bulwer again as her Minister at Madrid, even if it should\r\nbe necessary that he should repair there in order to be received by\r\nthe Queen of Spain. It would not be consulting the permanent interests\r\nof this country to entrust that mission again to Sir H. Bulwer, after\r\nall that has passed. When the Queen considers the position we had in\r\nSpain, and what it ought to have been after the constitution of\r\nthe French Republic when we had no rival to fight and ought to have\r\nenjoyed the entire confidence and friendship of Spain, and compares\r\nthis to the state into which our relations with that country have been\r\nbrought, she cannot help being struck how much matters must have been\r\nmismanaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _16th June 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends the enclosed draft,[27] and asks whether this note is\r\nwhat Lord John directed Lord Palmerston to send to Lisbon as a caution\r\nto Sir H. Seymour not to mix himself up with party intrigues to upset\r\na particular Ministry?[28] ...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: The draft ran:--\"As it is evident that the Queen\r\n    and the Government of Portugal will listen to no advice except\r\n    such that agrees with their own wishes, I have to instruct you\r\n    to abstain in future from giving any longer any advice to them\r\n    on political matters, taking care to explain both to the\r\n    Queen and the Government your reasons for doing so. You will,\r\n    however, at the same time positively declare to the Portuguese\r\n    Government that if by the course of policy they are pursuing\r\n    they should run into any difficulty, they must clearly\r\n    understand that they will not have to expect any assistance\r\n    from England.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: Lord John Russell replied that he would write\r\n    immediately to Lord Palmerston respecting Portuguese affairs.\r\n    He added that he did not approve of the proposed draft.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nCARLTON GARDENS, _17th June 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN RUSSELL,--The draft to Seymour was written in consequence\r\nof what you said to me, and what the Queen wrote to you; but my own\r\nopinion certainly is that it would be best to leave the things with\r\nhim as they are.

The country is at this\r\nmoment suffering, particularly with regard to Spain, under the evil\r\nconsequence of that system of diplomacy, which makes the taking up of\r\nparty politics in foreign countries its principal object. This system\r\nis condemned alike by the Queen, Lord John, the Cabinet, and, the\r\nQueen fully believes, public opinion in and out of Parliament. Lord\r\nPalmerston's objection to caution our Minister in Portugal against\r\nfalling into this fault brings it to an issue, whether that\r\n_erroneous_ policy is to be maintained to the detriment of the real\r\ninterests of the country, or a wiser course to be followed in future.\r\nDoes Lord John consider this so light a matter as to be surrendered\r\nmerely because Lord Palmerston is not to add to such a caution a\r\ngratuitous attack upon the Queen and Government of Portugal? The Queen\r\nthinks it of the utmost importance that in these perilous times this\r\nquestion with regard to the basis of our foreign policy should be\r\n_settled_, and has no objection to Lord John showing this letter to\r\nLord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _18th June 1848._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he begs\r\nto assure your Majesty that if he was disposed to rest on the known\r\ndiscretion and temper of Sir Hamilton Seymour without specific\r\ninstruction, it was not from regarding the matter lightly, but from a\r\nsense of the inconvenience which might arise to your Majesty's service\r\nfrom raising a question with Lord Palmerston in the present critical\r\nstate of Europe which might induce a belief that he had not conducted\r\nforeign affairs to the satisfaction of his colleagues or of his\r\nSovereign.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell feeling, however, that on the particular point at\r\nissue your Majesty has just reason to expect that precautions should\r\nbe taken against the chance of intrigue with foreign parties against a\r\nforeign government, with which this country is on terms of friendship,\r\nis ready to insist on an instruction to Sir Hamilton Seymour similar\r\nto that which was given to Sir Henry Bulwer to take no part in the\r\nstruggle of parties, and to refrain from any interference with\r\nrespect to which he has not specific directions from your Majesty's\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut in this case he must take upon himself the whole responsibility of\r\nrequiring such a note from Lord Palmerston. It would not be conducive\r\nto your Majesty's service, nor agreeable to the wholesome maxims of\r\nthe Constitution to mix your Majesty's name with a proceeding which\r\nmay lead to the most serious consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is just to Lord Palmerston to say that his general course of policy\r\nhas met with the warm approval of the Cabinet, and that the cases of\r\ndifference of judgment have been rare exceptions.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell submits to your Majesty the letter he proposes to\r\nwrite before sending it to Lord Palmerston. He would wish to have it\r\nreturned as soon as your Majesty can do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND PALMERSTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _18th June 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns to Lord John Russell his letter to Lord\r\nPalmerston,[29] which is excellent, and shows that the Queen's and\r\nLord John's views upon the important question of our foreign policy\r\n_entirely coincide_. The Queen is sorry that the trouble of such an\r\naltercation should be added to the many anxieties which already press\r\nupon Lord John, but she feels sure that his insisting upon a _sound_\r\nline of policy will save him and the country from _far greater_\r\ntroubles....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: The letter was to the effect that Sir H.

No remonstrance has any effect with Lord Palmerston.\r\nLord John Russell should ask the Duke of Bedford to tell him of the\r\nconversation the Queen had with the Duke the other night about Lord\r\nPalmerston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ENGLAND AND ITALY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st July 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has not yet answered Lord Palmerston's letter of the 29th.\r\nShe cannot conceal from him that she is ashamed of the policy which we\r\nare pursuing in this Italian controversy in abetting wrong, and this\r\nfor the object of gaining _influence_ in Italy.[30] The Queen does\r\nnot consider influence so gained as an advantage, and though this\r\ninfluence is to be acquired in order to do good, she is afraid that\r\nthe fear of losing it again will always stand in the way of this. At\r\nleast in the countries where the greatest stress has been laid on that\r\ninfluence, and the greatest exertions made for it, the _least good_\r\nhas been done--the Queen means in Spain, Portugal, and Greece. Neither\r\nis there any kind of consistency in the line we take about Italy and\r\nthat we follow with regard to Schleswig; both cases are perfectly\r\nalike (with the difference perhaps that there is a question of right\r\nmixed up in that of Schleswig); whilst we upbraid Prussia, caution\r\nher, etc., etc., we say nothing to Charles Albert except that if he\r\ndid not wish to take _all_ the Emperor of Austria's Italian Dominions,\r\nwe would not lay any _obstacles_ in the way of his moderation. The\r\nQueen finds in Lord Palmerston's last despatch to Chevalier Bunsen\r\nthe following passage: \"And it is manifest and indisputable that no\r\nterritory or state, which is not now according to the Treaty of 1815\r\nincluded in the German Confederation, can be added to that territory\r\nwithout the consent of the Sovereign of that territory or state.\" How\r\ndoes this agree with our position relative to the incorporation of\r\nLombardy into the states of the King of Sardinia?\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: Lord Palmerston's sympathy had been with the\r\n    anti-Austrian movement in Northern Italy. For some time after\r\n    Radetzky's evacuation of Milan, the operations of the King of\r\n    Sardinia in support of the Lombards were successful, and he\r\n    had assistance from Tuscany, Naples, and Rome. The Austrians\r\n    suffered reverses at Peschiera and Goito, and the independence\r\n    of Northern Italy seemed to be accomplished.

The danger of French interference increases\r\nwith the delay and is equally great, whether the Austrians maintain\r\nthemselves in the Venetian Territory or whether Charles Albert unite\r\nit to his proposed kingdom of Northern Italy; indeed, the French seem\r\nto be anxious for a cause of interference from the line they pursue\r\neven with regard to Naples.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston seeks to establish a difference between the case\r\nof Schleswig and of Lombardy, on the fact that Schleswig is to be\r\nincorporated into a confederation of States; but this makes the case\r\nof Lombardy only the stronger, as this is to be incorporated into\r\nthe dominions of another Sovereign. With regard to the \"Revue\r\nRetrospective,\" the perusal of it has left a different impression upon\r\nthe Queen from that which it seems to have made upon Lord Palmerston.\r\nIt proved to her, that while the retiring attitude which the late\r\nGovernment took with regard to the Spanish marriages, left the French\r\nGovernment to try their different schemes and intrigues and to fail\r\nwith every one of them, the attempt of Lord Palmerston to re-organise\r\nthe Progressista Party and regain the so-called _English influence_,\r\nbrought Queen Christina and King Louis Philippe (who had before\r\nseriously quarrelled) immediately together, and induced them to rush\r\ninto this unfortunate combination, which cannot but be considered as\r\nthe origin of all the present convulsions in Europe.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Lord Minto, the Lord Privy Seal, and\r\n    father-in-law of the Prime Minister, had been sent to\r\n    encourage in the path of reform Pope Pius IX., who was halting\r\n    between progress and reaction: on the sanguinary risings\r\n    taking place in Lombardy and Venetia, his mission naturally\r\n    appeared hostile to Austria.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AN ANXIOUS PERIOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _11th July 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--For another kind and dear letter of the 8th, I have\r\nmuch to thank you. The prosperity of dear little Belgium is a bright\r\nstar in the stormy night all around. May God bless and prosper you\r\nall, for ever and ever!\r\n\r\nSince the 24th February I feel an uncertainty in everything existing,\r\nwhich (uncertain as all human affairs must be) one never felt before.\r\nWhen one thinks of one's children, their education, their future--and\r\nprays for them--I always think and say to myself, \"Let them grow up\r\nfit for _whatever station_ they may be placed in--_high or low_.\" This\r\none never thought of before, but I _do_ always now. Altogether one's\r\nwhole disposition is so changed--_bores_ and trifles which one would\r\nhave complained of bitterly a few months ago, one looks upon as good\r\nthings and quite a blessing--provided one can _keep one's position in\r\nquiet!_\r\n\r\nI own I have not much confidence in Cavaignac,[32] as they fear\r\nhis mother's and brother's influence, the former being a widow of a\r\nregicide, and as _stern_ and severe as can be imagined.\r\n\r\nI saw the King and Queen on Saturday; he is wonderfully merry still\r\nand quite himself, but _she_ feels it deeply--and for _her_ there is\r\nhere the greatest sympathy and admiration.\r\n\r\nAlbert is going to York to-morrow till Friday; _how_ I wish you and\r\nLouise could be with me, as in '44 and '46! I have, however, got dear\r\nVictoire to come and spend a night with me; it does her always good,\r\nand we are just like sisters, and feel as we did in 1839, when you\r\nknow how very fond we were of each other. She is a dear, noble, and\r\nstill _beautiful_ child.\r\n\r\nI venture to send you a snuff-box with poor Aunt Charlotte's picture\r\nas a child, which also belonged to poor Aunt Sophia. Ever your devoted\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: General Cavaignac, Minister for War, had been\r\n    given _quasi_-dictatorial powers during the insurrection.\r\n    These powers, on the suppression of the revolt, he resigned,\r\n    and was thereupon almost unanimously made President of the\r\n    Council.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _13th July 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen was glad to hear of the majorities the other night. She\r\nconcludes Lord John Russell cannot at all say _when_ the Session\r\nis likely to end? Is it not much to be regretted that the measure\r\nrelative to the Navigation Laws is given up, and was it unavoidable?\r\nThe Queen sends Lord John Col. Phipps's report of the Prince's\r\nreception at York, which she thinks will interest him. Does Lord J.\r\nRussell think, if we should not go to Ireland, that we could go to\r\nBalmoral for ten days or a fortnight, without shocking the Irish very\r\nmuch? It strikes the Queen that to go to see _our own place_ makes a\r\ndifference, and is in fact a natural thing; it is, however, impossible\r\nto say if we _can_ get away even for so short a time.\r\n\r\nThe Queen concludes that there can be no possible objection to the Duc\r\nde Nemours bringing or fetching the Duchess to and from Osborne? He is\r\nthe Queen's Cousin, and consequently in a different position to any\r\nof the others; moreover, he does _not_ wish _at present_ to spend one\r\n_night_ there even, but merely to pay a morning visit.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Queen wishes to know if the King and Queen and the other\r\nPrinces and Princesses _should themselves_ ask to come and pay the\r\nQueen a morning visit at Osborne, and return again the same day (as\r\nthey do here), there would be any objection to it? The Queen merely\r\nwishes to know, in _case they_ should ask leave to do so, what she can\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COMMISSIONS IN THE ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir George Grey._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _14th July 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Sir George Grey's letter of yesterday, and\r\nhas considered the proposed alteration in the mode of preparing\r\nCommissions for Officers in the Army. The Queen does not at all object\r\nto the amount of trouble which the signature of so many Commissions\r\nhas hitherto entailed upon her, as she feels amply compensated by the\r\nadvantage of keeping up a personal connection between the Sovereign\r\nand the Army, and she very much doubts whether the Officers generally\r\nwould not feel it as a slight if, instead of their Commissions\r\nbearing the Queen's sign-manual, they were in future only to receive\r\na certificate from the Secretary at War that they have been\r\ncommissioned.\r\n\r\nShe therefore prefers matters to remain on their old footing.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary at War speaks in his Memorandum of his responsibility to\r\nParliament with respect to allowing Appointments to go on; the\r\nQueen apprehends that his responsibility does not extend beyond the\r\nappropriation of the money voted by Parliament for the use of her\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Princess Charlotte of Belgium to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _18th July 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST COUSIN,--I have received the beautiful dolls' house you\r\nhave been so kind as to send me, and I thank you very much for it.\r\nI am delighted with it; every morning I dress my doll and give her a\r\ngood breakfast; and the day after her arrival she gave a great rout at\r\nwhich all my dolls were invited. Sometimes she plays at drafts on her\r\npretty little draft-board, and every evening I undress her and put her\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nBe so good, my dearest Cousin, as to give my love to my dear little\r\nCousins, and believe me always, your most affectionate Cousin,\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ITALY AND FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _24th July 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Palmerston's letter[33] reporting his\r\nconversation with M. de Tallenay. She can only repeat her opinion that\r\na negotiation with France in order to agree with her upon a common\r\nline of policy to be followed with regard to the Italian question can\r\nlead to no good; it will make us the ally of a Government which is not\r\neven legally constituted, and which can accordingly not guarantee the\r\nfulfilment of any engagement it may enter into, and it will call upon\r\nthe very power to judge the Italian dispute which it is the interest\r\nof Europe to keep out of it. M. de Tallenay seems to have admitted\r\nthat the French Republic, if called upon to act, will neither allow\r\nAustria to keep the Venetian territory nor Sardinia to acquire it, but\r\nthat she will strive to set up a Venetian Republic. It can really not\r\nbe an object for us to assist in such a scheme, or even to treat upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLord Cowley the Queen means to invite to dinner to-day, and she wishes\r\nLord Palmerston to let her know the day on which he is to leave for\r\nFrankfort in order that she may prepare her letter for the Archduke\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: Lord Palmerston had reported an interview with\r\n    de Tallenay, who sought the co-operation of England with France\r\n    in Northern Italy; the Austrian force in Italy to be withdrawn\r\n    or reduced, the union of Lombardy and Piedmont to be accepted\r\n    as a _fait accompli_, and Venetian territory erected into a\r\n    separate republic.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: NORTHERN ITALY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _25th July 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends Lord John Russell the enclosed Despatch from Lord\r\nNormanby, with a draft in answer to it which was sent for her\r\napproval, but which she really cannot approve. The Queen must tell\r\nLord John what she has repeatedly told Lord Palmerston, but without\r\napparent effect, that the establishment of an _entente cordiale with\r\nthe French Republic_, for the purpose of driving the Austrians out\r\nof _their dominions_ in Italy, would be a _disgrace_ to this country.\r\nThat the French would attach the greatest importance to it and gain\r\nthe greatest advantage by it there can be no doubt of; but how will\r\nEngland appear before the world _at the moment_ when she is struggling\r\nto maintain her supremacy in Ireland, and boasts to stand by treaties\r\nwith regard to her European relations, having declined all this\r\ntime to interfere in Italy or to address one word of caution to the\r\nSardinian Government on account of its attack on Austria, and having\r\nrefused to mediate when called upon to do so by Austria, because\r\nthe terms were not good enough for Sardinia, if she should now ally\r\nherself with the arch-enemy of Austria to interfere _against her_ at\r\nthe moment when she has recovered in some degree her position in the\r\nVenetian territory?\r\n\r\nThe notion of establishing a Venetian State under French guarantee is\r\ntoo absurd. Lord Palmerston in his draft says that we believe that the\r\nFrench plan would be agreed to by Austria. Now this is completely at\r\nvariance with every account, report, or despatch we have received from\r\nVerona, Innspruck, or Vienna; however, Lord Palmerston hints that the\r\nKing of Sardinia might expect still better terms. The French Republic\r\nseems _not_ to be anxious for war, not able to conduct it, and the\r\ncountry appears to be decidedly against it; all M. Bastide says is:\r\n\"There were two extremes which it would be very difficult for them\r\nto admit without opposition, viz. the restoration of Lombardy to the\r\nDominion of Austria on the one side, and the union under one powerful\r\nstate under Charles Albert of all the principalities into which\r\nthe north of Italy has hitherto been divided.\" With this explicit\r\ndeclaration, it would surely be best for the interests of Europe that\r\nwe should name _this_ to Charles Albert, and call upon him to rest\r\nsatisfied with his conquest, and to conclude a peace with Austria,\r\nleaving her what he cannot take from her, and thus avoid calling in\r\nFrance as an arbiter. Why this has not been done long ago, or should\r\nnot be done now, the Queen cannot comprehend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _27th July 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge Lord John Russell's two letters with\r\nrespect to Italy. The alterations in the draft meet many of the\r\nQueen's objections, giving to the whole step another appearance. The\r\nQueen ... must acknowledge the advantage of our trying to bind [the\r\nFrench] to good conduct; only this must be done in a way not to appear\r\nas a league with them against a friendly Power, struggling to preserve\r\nto herself a territory granted to her by a Treaty to which we were a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAs the amended draft secures us against these appearances, and leaves\r\nus free for the future, the Queen approves it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MINOR GERMAN STATES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _1st August 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had yesterday the happiness of receiving your\r\nkind letter of the 29th, for which I return my best thanks.\r\n\r\nThere are ample means of crushing the Rebellion in Ireland,[34] and\r\nI think it now is very likely to go off without any contest.... Lord\r\nHardinge is going over there to serve on the Staff, which is very\r\npraiseworthy of him.\r\n\r\nI do not think the fate of the Minor Princes in Germany is so\r\ncompletely decided as Charles[35] ... is _so_ anxious to make one\r\nbelieve. There is only a question of taking certain powers and rights\r\naway, and not at all of getting rid of them; and I think you will see\r\nthat the _Ausfuehrung_ of the Unity will be an impossibility, at least\r\nin the sense they propose at Frankfort. The Archduke John has spoken\r\nvery reassuringly both to Ernest and the Duke of Meiningen, and the\r\nattachment in many of those smaller principalities is still extremely\r\ngreat, and I am sure they will never consent to being _ausgewischt_.\r\nCoburg, for instance, on the occasion of the suppression of a very\r\nsmall riot, showed the greatest attachment and devotion to Ernest; at\r\nGotha the feeling of independence is _very_ great, and at Strelitz, on\r\nthe occasion of Augusta's confinement with a _son_, the enthusiasm and\r\nrejoicing was universal. All this cannot be entirely despised.\r\n\r\nWe are as happy as possible here, and would be perfectly so, if it was\r\nnot for the sorrow and misfortunes of so many dear to us, and for the\r\nstate of the world in general.\r\n\r\nI have always forgotten to tell you that we bought a fine marble bust\r\nof you quite by accident in London the other day. It is in armour and\r\nwith moustaches, but quite different to the one the Gardners have at\r\nMelbourne; Albert saw it at the window of a shop, and heard it had\r\nbeen bought in a sale of a General Somebody. Now, with Albert's best\r\nlove, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nWe have just heard that there has been an _action_ in Ireland in which\r\nsome of the insurgents have been killed; _fifty_ Police dispersed\r\n_four thousand_ people. Smith O'Brien is, however, not yet taken.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: _See_ Introductory Note for the year, _ante_, p.\r\n    141.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: The Frankfort Assembly, in pursuance of the\r\n    policy of German consolidation, had placed the central\r\n    executive power in the hands of a Reichsverweser, or Vicar\r\n    of the Empire. The Archduke John, uncle of the Emperor\r\n    of Austria, was elected to this position, and the Queen's\r\n    half-brother Charles, Prince of Leiningen, was entrusted with\r\n    the Department of Foreign Affairs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AN AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _8th August 1848._\r\n\r\n... The Queen has attentively perused the statement of Lord Palmerston\r\nin favour of accrediting an Ambassador at Paris. As the proposed\r\narrangement for the present is to be only a _provisional_ one, the\r\nQueen thinks that the appointment of a _Minister_ now will leave it\r\nquite open to have an Ambassador hereafter, if it should be found\r\nnecessary or advantageous, whilst it would set that matter at rest\r\nfor the moment. Withdrawing an Ambassador and substituting a Minister\r\nhereafter, would be much more difficult. The French Republic would\r\nno doubt like to have an Ambassador here, and perhaps take immediate\r\nsteps to secure that object if Lord Normanby were accredited\r\nAmbassador at Paris, against which we would be secured in having only\r\na Minister there.... Lord Normanby's acquaintance with the public men\r\nat Paris is as much an inconvenience as it may be a convenience in\r\nsome respects; his having been the great admirer and friend of M.\r\nLamartine, for instance, etc., etc. The possibility of mixing freely\r\nwith persons of various kinds, which Lord Palmerston adduces as an\r\nimportant consideration will, in the Queen's opinion, be more easy\r\nfor a Minister than for a person of the high rank of Ambassador. All\r\nthings considered therefore, the Queen will prefer to have temporarily\r\na Minister accredited at Paris.\r\n\r\nM. de Tallenay the Queen would receive in London on Tuesday next at\r\nsix o'clock, when the Queen will be in Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _11th August 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge Lord Palmerston's letter of yesterday.\r\nThe Queen was quite surprised to hear from Lord Palmerston in his last\r\ncommunication that he had written to Lord Normanby to offer him to\r\nstay as Minister at Paris, after his having before stated to the Queen\r\nthat this would never do and could not be expected from Lord Normanby;\r\nLord Normanby's answer declining this offer therefore does in no way\r\nalter the matter, and must have been foreseen by Lord Palmerston.\r\nBy the delay and Lord Normanby's various conversations with M.\r\nBastide[36] and General Cavaignac it has now become difficult to\r\ndepart from the precedent of the Belgian and Sardinian Missions\r\nwithout giving offence at Paris. The Queen must, however, insist upon\r\nthis precedent being fully adhered to. She accordingly sanctions Lord\r\nNormanby's appointment as Ambassador Extraordinary, on the _distinct\r\nunderstanding_ that there is to be no Ambassador sent in return to\r\nLondon now, and that a Minister is to be appointed to Paris when the\r\ndiplomatic intercourse is permanently to be settled. The Queen\r\nwishes Lord Palmerston to bear this in mind, and to submit to her the\r\narrangement which he thinks will be best calculated to carry this into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: Minister of Foreign Affairs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD NORMANBY'S APPOINTMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _11th August 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge Lord John Russell's letter of to-day.\r\nThe Queen is highly indignant at Lord Palmerston's behaviour now again\r\nwith respect to Lord Normanby's appointment; he knew perfectly well\r\nthat Lord Normanby could not accept the post of Minister, and had\r\nwritten to the Queen before that such an offer could not be made, and\r\nhas now made it after all, knowing that, by wasting time and getting\r\nthe matter entangled at Paris, he would carry his point. If the French\r\nare so anxious to keep Lord Normanby as to make any sacrifice for that\r\nobject, it ought to make us cautious, as it can only be on account of\r\nthe ease with which they can make him serve their purposes. They,\r\nof course, like an _entente cordiale_ with us at the expense of\r\nAustria;... but this can be no consideration for us....\r\n\r\nThreatening the Austrians with war, or making war upon them in case\r\nthey should not be inclined to surrender their provinces at his\r\nbidding [Lord Palmerston] knows to be impossible; therefore the\r\n_entente_ with the Republic is of the greatest value to him, enabling\r\nhim to threaten the Austrians at any time with the French intervention\r\nwhich he can have at command if he agrees to it.[37] The Queen has\r\nread the leading articles of the _Times_ of yesterday and to-day on\r\nthis subject with the greatest satisfaction as they express almost\r\nentirely the same views and feelings which she entertains. The Queen\r\nhopes that Lord John Russell will read them; indeed, the whole of\r\nthe Press seem to be unanimous on this subject, and she can hardly\r\nunderstand how there can be two opinions upon it....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: The success of the Piedmontese in Northern Italy\r\n    had not continued through the summer, and the States whose\r\n    assistance they had hitherto received began to fall away from\r\n    them. The King of Naples, successful within his own dominions,\r\n    had withdrawn his troops; the Pope hesitated to attack\r\n    Austria; even undivided support from Venetia could no longer\r\n    be counted upon. After several reverses, Charles Albert, now\r\n    left virtually alone in the contest, was decisively defeated\r\n    by Radetzky, at Custozza, and retreated across the Mincio.\r\n    With what was left of his troops he entered Milan, which he\r\n    was eventually forced to surrender, being unable to maintain\r\n    himself there. Italy now turned to France for assistance, but\r\n    Cavaignac, virtually Dictator in Paris, would not go further\r\n    than combining with England to effect a peaceful mediation.\r\n    Austria was not in a frame of mind to relinquish any part of\r\n    the provinces she had had so severe a struggle to retain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND PALMERSTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _20th August 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received an _autograph_ letter from the Archduke John\r\n(in answer to the private letter she had written to him through Lord\r\nCowley), which has been cut open at the Foreign Office. The Queen\r\nwishes Lord Palmerston to take care that this does not happen again.\r\nThe opening of official letters even, addressed to the Queen, which\r\nshe has _of late_ observed, is really not becoming, and ought to be\r\ndiscontinued, as it used never to be the case formerly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _21st August 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of yesterday, but\r\ncannot say that she has been satisfied by the reasons given by Lord\r\nPalmerston. The union of Lombardy and Piedmont cannot be considered as\r\na concession to France for the maintenance of peace, because we know\r\nthat it is the very thing the French object to. The Queen quite agrees\r\nthat the principal consideration always to be kept in sight is the\r\npreservation of the peace of Europe; but it is precisely on that\r\naccount that she regrets that the terms proposed by Lord Palmerston\r\n(whilst they are not in accordance with the views of France) are\r\nalmost the only ones which must be most offensive to Austria. Lord\r\nPalmerston _will_ have his kingdom of Upper Italy under Charles\r\nAlbert, to which every other consideration is to be sacrificed, and\r\nLord Normanby's alteration of the terms certainly serve _that_ purpose\r\nwell; but it is quite independent of the question of mediation,\r\nand the only thing in the whole proceeding which is indefensible in\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be a calamity for ages to come if this principle is to become\r\npart of the international law, viz. \"that a people can at any time\r\ntransfer their allegiance from the Sovereign of one State to that of\r\nanother by universal suffrage (under momentary excitement),\" and\r\nthis is what Lord Normanby--no doubt according to Lord Palmerston's\r\nwishes--has taken as the basis of the mediation. For even the _faits\r\naccomplis_, which are a convenient basis to justify any act of\r\ninjustice, are here against Charles Albert.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston's argument respecting Schleswig,[38] which the Queen\r\nquoted in her last letter, had no reference to the Treaty of 1720.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: The first act of the _Vor-Parlament_, a body\r\n    which had existed temporarily at Frankfort, to pave the way\r\n    for the National Assembly of a Consolidated Germany, had been\r\n    to treat Schleswig, theretofore part of the Danish dominions,\r\n    as absorbed in the German Confederation, and Lord Palmerston's\r\n    objections to this proceeding had been treated by the Queen\r\n    in a letter of 19th August as inconsistent with his attitude\r\n    towards Austria.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRUSSIA AND GERMANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _29th August 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Most warmly do I thank you for your very kind and\r\ndear letter of the 26th, with so many good wishes for that _dearest_\r\nof days. It is indeed to me one of eternal thankfulness, for a purer,\r\nmore perfect being than my beloved Albert the Creator could _not_ have\r\nsent into this troubled world. I feel that I could _not_ exist without\r\nhim, and that I should sink under the troubles and annoyances and\r\n_degouts_ of my _very_ difficult position, were it not for _his_\r\nassistance, protection, guidance, and comfort. Truly do I thank you\r\nfor your _great_ share in bringing about our marriage.\r\n\r\nStockmar I do not quite understand, and I cannot believe that he\r\n_really wishes to ruin_ all the smaller States, though his principal\r\nobject is that unity which I fear he will _not_ obtain.\r\n\r\nI do not either at all agree in his wish that Prussia should take the\r\nlead; his love for Prussia is to me incomprehensible, for it is the\r\ncountry of all others which the _rest_ of Germany dislikes. Stockmar\r\ncannot be my good old friend if he has such notions of injustice as\r\nI hear attributed to him. But whatever they may be, I do _not_ believe\r\nthe _Ausfuehrung_ to be possible.\r\n\r\nI have great hopes of soon hearing of something decided about the\r\nfortunes of the poor French family.

The Queen is surprised that Lord Palmerston should\r\nhave left her uninformed of so important an event. The Queen has\r\nreceived Lord Palmerston's letter respecting the proposal to mediate\r\non the part of the central power of Germany,[40] and does not see why\r\nthat power, which has a responsible Government, is to be precluded\r\nfrom taking part in a negotiation because the Archduke John might be\r\nfriendly towards Austria--whereas the French republic, which had in\r\npublic documents espoused the Italian Cause, is to be a party to it.\r\n\r\nNeither France nor England are neighbours to or directly interested in\r\nLombardy, whereas Germany is both.[41]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: See _ante_, p. 188, note 35.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: Lord Palmerston's object, in which he ultimately\r\n    succeeded, was, by obtaining the French Government's\r\n    co-operation in mediating between Austria and Piedmont, to\r\n    prevent the aggressive party in France from maturing any\r\n    designs on Italy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AUSTRIA AND ITALY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nON BOARD THE _Victoria and Albert,_\r\nABERDEEN, _7th September 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen must send the enclosed draft to Lord John Russell, with a\r\ncopy of her letter to Lord Palmerston upon it. Lord Palmerston has as\r\nusual pretended not to have had time to submit the draft to the Queen\r\nbefore he had sent it off. What the Queen has long suspected and often\r\nwarned against is on the point of happening, viz. Lord Palmerston's\r\nusing the new _entente cordiale_ for the purpose of wresting from\r\nAustria her Italian provinces by French arms. This would be a most\r\niniquitous proceeding. It is another question whether it is good\r\npolicy for Austria to try to retain Lombardy, but that is for her and\r\nnot for us to decide. Many people might think that we would be happier\r\nwithout Ireland or Canada.

The Schleswig affair at\r\nFrankfort is _very_ unfortunate, and there seems a lamentable want of\r\n_all_ practical sense, foresight, or even _common_ prudence.[42]\r\n\r\nThe poor Austrians seem now to accept the (to me _very_ doubtful)\r\nmediation. It reminds me of the wolf in the lamb's skin. _Nous\r\nverrons_, how matters will be arranged....\r\n\r\nMy letter to Louise will have informed you of our voyage and our\r\narrival here. This house is small but pretty, and though the hills\r\nseen from the windows are not _so_ fine, the scenery all around is the\r\nfinest almost I have seen anywhere. It is very wild and solitary,\r\nand yet cheerful and _beautifully wooded_, with the river Dee running\r\nbetween the two sides of the hills. Loch Nagar is the highest hill in\r\nthe immediate vicinity, and belongs to us.\r\n\r\nThen the soil is the driest and best known almost anywhere, and all\r\nthe hills are as sound and hard as the road. The climate is also dry,\r\nand in general not very cold, though we had one or two very cold days.\r\nThere is a deer forest--many roe deer, and on the opposite hill (which\r\ndoes not belong to us) grouse. There is also black cock and ptarmigan.\r\nAlbert has, however, no luck this year, and has in vain been after the\r\ndeer, though they are continually seen, and often quite close by the\r\nhouse. The children are very well, and enjoying themselves much.

Lord John replied that he was\r\naware of it; that he had considered the matter already, having heard\r\nfrom his brother (the Duke of Bedford) how strongly I felt about it;\r\nthat he felt the truth of all that I had said, but that, on the other\r\nhand, Lord Palmerston was a very able man, entirely master of his\r\noffice and affairs, and a very good colleague, never making any\r\ndifficulties about other questions, but (certainly _unreasonably_)\r\ncomplaining of other people mixing with and interfering in the affairs\r\nof his office. I said that ... I fully believed that that Spanish\r\nmarriage question, which had been the original cause of so many\r\npresent misfortunes, would never have become so _embrouille_ had it\r\nnot been for Lord Palmerston. This led Lord John to say, that though\r\nhe disapproved the length of Lord Palmerston's correspondence, still\r\nthat we could not have done otherwise than object to the marriage.\r\nThis is true enough. I repeated that all that had been done in Italy\r\nlast winter had also done harm, as it was done by _Lord Palmerston_,\r\nwho was distrusted everywhere abroad, which Lord John regretted. I\r\nsaid that I thought that he often endangered the honour of England by\r\ntaking a very prejudiced and one-sided view of a question;... that his\r\nwritings were always as bitter as gall and did great harm, which\r\nLord John entirely assented to, and that I often felt quite ill from\r\nanxiety; that I wished Lord Clarendon (who, I had heard, was tired\r\nof Ireland) could come over and be Secretary of State for Foreign\r\nAffairs, and Lord Palmerston go to Ireland as Lord-Lieutenant. Lord\r\nJohn said nothing would be better, for that he was sure that Lord\r\nPalmerston would make an admirable Lord-Lieutenant, but that another\r\nthing to be considered was the danger of making Lord Palmerston an\r\nenemy by displacing him, that Lord Minto (who was formerly a great\r\nfriend and admirer of Lord Palmerston's) had told Lady John when she\r\nspoke to him on the subject of placing Lord Palmerston in another\r\noffice, that _he_ (Lord Palmerston) would certainly turn against the\r\nGovernment if displaced. I said that might be, but that sometimes\r\nthere were great interests at stake which exceeded the danger of\r\noffending one man, and that this was here the case; Lord John said\r\nit was very true, but that at moments like these one of course was\r\nanxious not to do anything which could cause internal trouble.\r\nI admitted this, but repeated my anxiety, which Lord John quite\r\nunderstood, though he thought I a little overrated it, and said I was\r\nafraid that some day I should have to tell Lord John that I could\r\nnot put up with Lord Palmerston any longer, which might be very\r\ndisagreeable and awkward.\r\n\r\nIt ended by Lord John's promising to bear the subject in mind, and I\r\nmust say that he took it all just as I could wish.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AFFAIRS IN THE PUNJAB]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HOSTILITY OF THE SIKHS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Minute by the Governor-General of India._\r\n\r\n_30th September 1848._\r\n\r\n... The course of events, as they have developed themselves, and long\r\nand anxious considerations of this important subject, have finally and\r\nimmovably confirmed in my mind the conviction which the earlier events\r\nof the insurrection at Mooltan long since had founded, that there will\r\nbe no peace for India, nor any stability of Government in the Punjab,\r\nnor any release from anxiety and costly defensive preparations on\r\nour frontier, unless the British Government, justly indignant at the\r\nunprovoked and treacherous aggression once again committed against\r\nthem by the Sikhs, shall now effectually provide against future\r\ndangers by subverting for ever the Dynasty of the Sings, by converting\r\nthe Punjab into a British province, and by adopting the only measure\r\nwhich will secure the observance of peace by the Sikhs, namely,\r\ndepriving them utterly of all the means of making war. I continue as\r\nfully convinced as ever that the establishment of a strong, friendly,\r\nHindoo Government in the Punjab would be the best settlement that\r\ncould be made for the interests of British India, if it could\r\nbe formed. But I am convinced that such a Government cannot be\r\nformed.[43]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: _See_ Introductory Note for 1849, _post_, p.\r\n    208.]\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs of the Punjab are utterly powerless and worthless. The\r\ngreat body of the nation is adverse to all control, and in no degree\r\nsubmissive to the authority of those who are professedly their rulers.\r\n\r\nEven admitting, which I am by no means prepared to do, that the\r\nSirdars are not treacherously or hostilely disposed to the British\r\nGovernment, of what advantage, what defence to us is the fidelity of\r\nthe Chiefs, if they are confessedly unable to control the army which\r\nis as avowedly hostile to us? That which we desire to secure is a\r\npeaceful and well-governed neighbour, and a frontier free from alarms,\r\nnor demanding a permanent garrison of 50,000 men. If their army are\r\nable to disturb and eager to disturb on every occasion the peace we\r\nseek to render permanent, of what profit to us is the assumed fidelity\r\nof the Chiefs, who cannot repress their soldiers' turbulence, or\r\ncommand their obedience?\r\n\r\nI discredit altogether the assurances of the fidelity of the Chiefs on\r\nthe evidence of the facts before us....\r\n\r\nTo all these recommendations my colleagues in the Council have yielded\r\ntheir ready assent.\r\n\r\nI have to the last sought to avert, or to avoid, the necessity, if it\r\ncould prudently or fitly be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe Sikh nation have forced the necessity upon us. Having resolved\r\nat once, and fully, to meet it, I shall proceed with all speed to the\r\nfrontier, and shall endeavour by every exertion, and by all the means\r\nin my power, to carry into effect vigorously the measures on which\r\nthe Government of India has resolved, and which, in my conscience I\r\nbelieve, are imperatively called for by regard to the peace of India,\r\nto the security of our Empire there, and to the happiness of the\r\npeople over whom we rule.\r\n\r\nDALHOUSIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON'S ITALIAN POLICY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _7th October 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends Lord Palmerston's answer to her last letter, of which\r\nthe Queen has sent a copy to Lord John Russell, and encloses likewise\r\na copy of her present answer. The partiality of Lord Palmerston in\r\nthis Italian question really _surpasses all conception_, and makes the\r\nQueen _very uneasy_ on account of the character and honour of England,\r\nand on account of the danger to which the peace of Europe will be\r\nexposed. It is now clearly proved by Baron Wessenberg that upon the\r\nconclusion of the Armistice with Sardinia, negotiations for peace\r\nwould have speedily been entered into, had our _mediation_ not been\r\noffered to the King, to whom the offer of Lombardy was too tempting\r\nnot to accept, and now that promise is by fair or unfair means to\r\nbe made good. The Queen cannot see any principle in this, as the\r\nprinciple upon which Lord Palmerston goes is _Italian Nationality and\r\nIndependence from a foreign Yoke and Tyranny_. How can the Venetian\r\nterritory then be secured to Austria? and if this is done, on what\r\nground can Lombardy be wrung from her? It is really not safe to settle\r\nsuch important matters without principle and by personal _passion_\r\nalone. When the _French_ Government say they cannot control public\r\nfeeling, Lord Palmerston takes this as an unalterable fact, and as\r\na sufficient reason to make the Austrians give up Lombardy; when,\r\nhowever, the _Austrian_ Government say they cannot give up Lombardy on\r\naccount of the feeling of the Army which had just reconquered it\r\nwith their blood and under severe privations and sufferings, Lord\r\nPalmerston flippantly tells the Austrian Government, \"if that were so,\r\nthe Emperor had better abdicate and make General Radetzky Emperor.\"\r\nWhen Charles Albert burned the whole of the suburbs of Milan to keep\r\nup the delusion that he meant to defend the town, Lord Palmerston\r\nsaid nothing; and now that the Austrian Governor has prohibited\r\nrevolutionary placards on the walls, and prolonged the period at which\r\narms are to be surrendered, at the end of which persons concealing\r\narms are to be tried by court-martial, he writes to Vienna: \"that this\r\nsavage proclamation, which savours more of the barbarous usages of\r\ncenturies long gone by than of the spirit of the present times,\r\nmust strike everybody as a proof of the fear by which the Austrian\r\nCommander is inspired,\" etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nVenice was to have been made over to Austria by the Armistice, and\r\nnow that this has not been done, Austria is not even to retake it, in\r\norder (as Lord Normanby says) to keep something in hand against which\r\nAustria is to make further concessions. Is all this fair? In the\r\nmeantime, from the account of our Consul at Venice, the French agents\r\nare actively employed in intrigues against Austria in that town, and\r\nhave asked him to assist, which he refused. Lord Palmerston merely\r\napproved his conduct, and did not write a line to Paris about it. Now\r\nthe question at issue is not even to be submitted to a Conference of\r\nEuropean powers, but to be settled by the French Republic and Lord\r\nPalmerston alone, Lord Normanby being the instrument who has pledged\r\nhimself over and over again for Italian _independence_ (so called).\r\nIf Austria makes peace with Sardinia, and gives her Italian provinces\r\nseparate National Institutions with a liberal constitutional\r\nGovernment, _who can force_ upon her another arrangement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GREECE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _8th October 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot refrain from telling Lord Palmerston what a painful\r\nimpression the perusal of a draft of his to Lord Normanby referring to\r\nthe affairs of Greece has made upon her, being so little in accordance\r\nwith the calm dignity which she likes to see in all the proceedings of\r\nthe British Government; she was particularly struck by the language in\r\nwhich Lord Palmerston speaks of King Otho, a Sovereign with whom she\r\nstands in friendly relations, and the asperity against the Government\r\nof the King of the French, who is really sufficiently lowered and\r\nsuffering for the mistakes he may have committed, and that of all this\r\na copy is to be placed in the hands of the Foreign Minister of the\r\nFrench _Republic_, the Queen can only see with much regret.[44]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Lord Palmerston replied that his observations on\r\n    the two Kings lay at the very root of his argument, and were\r\n    necessary to conciliate the present Government of France.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _10th October 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Our voyage yesterday was much saddened by a\r\nterrible accident at Spithead, which delayed us half an hour, and\r\nwhich still fills us with horror. The sea was running very high, and\r\nwe were just outside what is called The Spit, when we saw a man in\r\nthe water, sitting on the keel of a boat, and we stopped, and at that\r\nmoment Albert discerned _many heads_ above the sea, including a poor\r\nwoman. The tide was running so strong that we could only stop an\r\ninstant and let a boat down, but you may imagine our horror. We waited\r\nat Gosport to hear if the people had been saved, and we learnt that\r\nthree had, two of whom by our _Fairy's_ boat, and that four were\r\ndrowned. Very horrid indeed.\r\n\r\nThe state of Germany is dreadful, and one does feel quite ashamed\r\nabout that once really so peaceful and happy people. That there are\r\nstill good people there I am sure, but they allow themselves to be\r\nworked upon in a frightful and shameful way.... In France a crisis\r\nseems at hand. _What_ a very bad figure we cut in this mediation!\r\nReally it is quite immoral, with Ireland quivering in our grasp,\r\nand ready to throw off her allegiance at any moment, for us to force\r\nAustria to give up her lawful possessions. What shall we say if\r\nCanada, Malta, etc., begin to trouble us? It hurts me terribly. This\r\nought to be the principle in _all actions_, private as well as public:\r\n\"Was du nicht willst, dass dir geschieht, das thu' auch einem andern\r\nnicht.\" ...\r\n\r\nI must now conclude.

Smith and the insurgent Dutch farmers, of which an account\r\nis published in the newspapers.[45] Lord Grey has, however, seen a\r\nprivate letter, which mentions, in addition to what is stated in the\r\nGovernment notice in the Cape newspapers, that Sir Harry Smith exposed\r\nhimself very much, and was slightly wounded; most fortunately, he was\r\nmerely grazed in the leg; his horse was also struck by a bullet in the\r\nnose. A very large proportion of those who were hit by the fire of the\r\nrebels were officers, who appear to have been particularly aimed at.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: In July, Pretorius, the Boer leader, had in\r\n    consequence of the British annexation of territory, expelled\r\n    the British Resident from Bloemfontein. _See_ Introductory\r\n    Note, _ante_, p. 142.

Smith's wound was not of a serious nature. The loss of so many\r\nofficers, the Queen is certain, proceeds from their wearing a blue\r\ncoat whilst the men are in scarlet; the Austrians lost a great\r\nproportion of officers in Italy from a similar difference of dress.\r\n\r\nAs to the Medal for Major Edwardes, the Queen did not approve but\r\ndisapprove the step, and wished the Bath to be given instead, which\r\nhas been done. The medals for troops in general (given by the East\r\nIndia Company) are a new and doubtful thing, and now it is proposed to\r\nreward even a special case of personal distinction by the _Company's_\r\nconferring a mark of honour. Lord Grey will agree with the Queen that\r\nit will be better not to establish two fountains of honour in the\r\nRealm. If the East India Company wish to mark their approbation,\r\nperhaps they might send Major Edwardes a fine sword or something of\r\nthat kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GOVERNORSHIP OF GIBRALTAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Grey to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL OFFICE, _26th October 1848._\r\n\r\nEarl Grey presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has just had\r\nthe honour of receiving your Majesty's letter. Lord Fitzroy Somerset\r\nhappened to be here when it arrived, and Lord Grey read to him that\r\npart of it which relates to the danger occasioned to officers in\r\naction from wearing a dress of a different colour from that of the\r\nmen. Lord Fitzroy observed that although there can be no doubt of the\r\nobjection to the blue coats worn by officers, in this instance their\r\nhaving suffered so much cannot be attributed to that cause, as it\r\nappears that all the officers who were wounded but one, belonged to\r\nregiments (the Rifle Battalion or the Cape Mounted Rifles) in which\r\nthe officers are dressed in the same colour as the men....\r\n\r\nLord Grey begs to submit to your Majesty that the usual time for\r\nrelieving the present Governor of Gibraltar is now come, and that he\r\nthinks it very desirable to appoint a successor to Sir Robert\r\nWilson, who now fills that situation. It appears to Lord Grey that,\r\nconsidering the nature of the appointment and also the great advantage\r\nwhich would result from affording greater encouragement to the\r\nofficers serving under the Ordnance, it would be very proper to\r\nconfer this government upon a General Officer belonging to the Royal\r\nArtillery or Engineers. There is some difficulty in making a selection\r\nfrom the officers of these Corps, because, from their retiring only by\r\nseniority, they seldom attain the rank of General Officer while\r\nthey are still in possession of sufficient strength and activity for\r\nemployment. Lord Grey, however, believes from the information he has\r\nbeen able to obtain, that Sir Robert Gardiner might, with advantage,\r\nbe appointed to this command, which he therefore begs leave to\r\nrecommend to your Majesty to confer upon him. Lord Grey has had no\r\ncommunication with Sir R. Gardiner, and is entirely ignorant whether\r\nhe would accept this employment.[46]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: Sir Robert Gardiner, K.C.B.. was appointed\r\n    Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Gibraltar on the 21st of\r\n    November, and held that post till 1855.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ITALY AND AUSTRIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _27th October 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has not yet acknowledged the receipt of Lord John Russell's\r\ncommunication of the views of the Cabinet on the Italian affairs.[47]\r\nShe is very glad that the Cabinet should have considered this\r\nimportant question, and that she should have received an assurance\r\n\"that she will not be advised to have recourse to forcible\r\nintervention.\" The Queen understands this principle to apply to\r\nLombardy as well as to Sicily, and that, of course, \"forcible\r\nintervention\" will not only be avoided as to British means, but\r\nlikewise as to French means, with British consent and concurrence.\r\nThough Lord John Russell does not enter so much into particulars with\r\nregard to the opinions of the Members of the Cabinet as the Queen\r\nmight have wished, she infers from the proposition that Lombardy\r\nshould be constituted separately under an Archduke, that the idea of\r\nmaking it over to the King of Sardinia is finally abandoned.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: Lord John had written to the effect that, while\r\n    no definite decision had been arrived at with regard to Italy,\r\n    it was thought by the Cabinet that every means should be used\r\n    to induce Austria to give up Lombardy to an Austrian Prince,\r\n    as most conformable to the interests of Austria herself. The\r\n    question of Sicily (he added) was more difficult, but if no\r\n    agreement could be arrived at by amicable negotiation, the\r\n    Cabinet would not be disposed to advise the Queen to have\r\n    recourse to forcible intervention.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _19th November 1848._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be necessary to send troops to India, who will then\r\nbe no longer chargeable to this country.

The election of a President in France is so\r\ncompletely absorbing attention that any mark of regard to the Duke of\r\nNemours may well pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell had the honour of seeing Louis Philippe in\r\nthis house on Friday. He was in much better spirits, owing to the\r\nconvalescence of the Queen; but the illness has been a very serious\r\none.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell had understood that the affairs of property\r\nbelonging to the Orleans family were arranged, and that Louis Philippe\r\nwould ultimately be possessed of more than a million sterling.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe expressed his opinion in favour of Louis Bonaparte as a\r\ncandidate for the Presidency.

Your Royal Majesty has\r\nalready learned what a subversion of public affairs has taken place\r\nat Rome, and what utterly unheard-of violence was, on the 16th of\r\nthe late month of November, offered to us in our very Palace of the\r\nQuirinal, in consequence of a nefarious conspiracy of abandoned and\r\nmost turbulent men. Hence, in order to avoid more violent commotions\r\nand more serious dangers, as likewise for the purpose of freely\r\nperforming the functions of our apostolic Ministry, we, not without\r\nthe deepest and most heartfelt sorrow, have been constrained to\r\ndepart for a time from our Holy City, and from the whole state of our\r\npontifical dominions; and in the meanwhile we come as far as Gaeta,\r\nwhere, as soon as we had arrived, our first care was to declare to\r\nour subjects the sentiments of our mind and will, by a public edict,\r\na copy of which we transmit to your Royal Majesty, together with\r\nthese our letters. Without doubt, through your own wisdom, you will\r\nperfectly understand, Most Serene and Potent Sovereign, that amongst\r\nthe other most cruel difficulties by which we are pressed, we must be\r\nchiefly solicitous concerning those subject to our temporal rule and\r\nthe rights and possessions of the Roman Church, which, moreover, your\r\naugust Uncle and the other Princes of Europe protected with so much\r\nzeal. But we do not in the least doubt that, in conformity with your\r\nexalted magnanimity, your justice, and your known desire to maintain\r\norder in public affairs, you will by no means suffer this same to be\r\nwanting to us at this most lamentable time. Trusting indeed in this\r\nhope, we do not cease, in the humility and affliction of our heart,\r\nfrom earnestly beseeching God, the All Good and All Great, that He may\r\nheap upon your Royal Majesty and your whole House all true and solid\r\nprosperity, and that He may unite you with us in perfect charity.\r\n\r\nGiven at Gaeta, the 4th day of December 1848, in the third year of our\r\nPontificate.\r\n\r\nPIUS PP.

You have indeed reason\r\nto look with satisfaction on all around you, though it is a painful\r\nthing to think how many have been ruined and made miserable since this\r\nday twelvemonths.

But that one _should have to wish for him_ is really\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\nNow good-bye, dearest Uncle. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _19th December 1848._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST, KINDEST UNCLE,--Your dear letter, full of interesting\r\ntopics, which I received yesterday, gave me great pleasure, and\r\nI thank you much for it. The success of Louis Napoleon[51] is an\r\nextraordinary event, but valuable as a universal condemnation of the\r\nRepublic since February.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, perhaps be more difficult to get rid of him again\r\nthan one at _first_ may imagine. Nemours thinks it better that none\r\nof themselves should be _called_ into action for some time to come.\r\nI fear that _he feels_ now that they _ought_ to have _foreseen_ the\r\ndangers in February, and _ought not_ to have yielded; when I said to\r\nhim that the Pope had declared that he would _never_ quit Rome, and\r\n_did so do_ the _very next day_, he said: \"Ah! mon Dieu, on se laisse\r\nentrainer dans ces moments.\" Louise said to me that _her Father_ had\r\nso _often declared he would never quit Paris alive_, so that when she\r\nheard of his flight she always believed it was untrue and he must be\r\ndead....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: He was elected President on the 10th of\r\n    December, by an immense majority.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND PALMERSTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd December 1848._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has been waiting to receive an answer from Lord John Russell\r\nupon her last letter, and has therefore delayed sending the enclosed\r\nletter from Lord Palmerston.[52] But lest any further delay might\r\ncause future inconvenience, she sends it now without having received\r\nLord John's answer. The Queen is sure Lord John will feel that neither\r\nLord Palmerston nor Lord Normanby have shown a proper regard for the\r\nQueen's wishes and opinion in this matter. Lord Normanby's Despatch\r\nshows that the step to be taken with reference to an Ambassador to be\r\nsent here is avowedly for the purpose of controlling the future action\r\nof the Queen's Government, and to _oblige her_ to keep a _permanent_\r\nAmbassador at Paris in the person of Lord Normanby. It is not very\r\ndelicate in Lord Normanby to convey such a message, nor in Lord\r\nPalmerston to urge it so eagerly. M. de Beaumont's departure from this\r\ncountry without taking leave of the Queen was neither very becoming.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has already, on Lord Palmerston's account, received two\r\npublic affronts: the one by her Minister in Spain having been sent out\r\nof that country,[53] the other now, by the new Emperor of Austria\r\nnot announcing to her by special mission his accession to the Throne,\r\nwhich he did to all other Sovereigns, avowedly, as it appears, to mark\r\nthe indignation of Austria at the inimical proceedings of the British\r\nForeign Secretary. The Queen does not think that, in the face of such\r\nslurs, the dignity of England will be vindicated by a race between her\r\nrepresentative and that of Spain, who is to present his credentials\r\nfirst to the new President of the French Republic, which Lord\r\nPalmerston considers of such importance as to render an _immediate_\r\ndecision indispensable.\r\n\r\nShould Lord John think that we cannot do less now for Louis Napoleon\r\nthan has been done in the case of General Cavaignac, the Queen\r\nwill not object to renewing Lord Normanby's credentials as\r\nAmbassador-Extraordinary on a special mission.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: Lord Palmerston had written to say that\r\n    Lord Normanby's credentials were provisional, and regular\r\n    credentials would become necessary. The new French Government\r\n    were sending Ambassadors to Vienna, Rome, and other capitals,\r\n    which in return would send Ambassadors to Paris, so that it\r\n    would be injurious for this country's representative to be of\r\n    inferior diplomatic rank. \"It would,\" he wrote subsequently,\r\n    \"be derogatory to the dignity of your Majesty, and to the\r\n    character of your Majesty's Government if, in the present\r\n    state of things between the British and Spanish Governments\r\n    the Spanish Ambassador should, by a dilatoriness on the part\r\n    of your Majesty's Government, be allowed to raise a question\r\n    about precedence with your Majesty's representative at Paris;\r\n    it would be very inconvenient if that question were decided\r\n    unfavourably to your Majesty's representative, and very\r\n    undesirable that he should appear to be under obligation to\r\n    the French Government for a decision in his favour.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: See _ante_, p. 175.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening of Parliament (1849) was noteworthy for the appearance of\r\nMr Disraeli as leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, in\r\nplace of Lord George Bentinck, who had died suddenly in the recess;\r\nthe Peelites, though influential, were numerically few, and they\r\ncontinued by their support to maintain the Whigs in office, the\r\nprincipal measure of the session being the Act for the repeal of the\r\nNavigation Laws, a natural corollary to Peel's free trade policy. A\r\nRoyal visit was paid to Ireland in August, and at Cork, Waterford,\r\nDublin, and Belfast, the Queen and Prince were received with great\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAbroad, the cause of United Italy suffered a severe check. The\r\nSicilian revolt came to an end, and Austrian ascendency was\r\nre-established in Northern Italy. King Charles Albert was defeated at\r\nNovara, and abdicated in favour of his son, Victor Emmanuel. The Pope,\r\nwho had fled from Rome in disguise, in November 1848, and was living\r\nat Gaeta, was now under the protection of Austria and France, and\r\nGeneral Oudinot occupied the Papal city on his behalf in June.\r\nAustrian influence restored Tuscany, Parma, and Modena to their\r\nrulers, and in Central Europe operated to prevent the acceptance by\r\nthe King of Prussia of the Imperial Crown of Germany. Hungary, in\r\nconsequence of the help rendered to the Viennese insurrectionists in\r\n1848, was reduced to submission, but only with Russian co-operation.\r\nHeavy retribution was inflicted on the Hungarians; Kossuth and other\r\nrevolutionaries fled to Turkey, the Russian and Austrian Governments\r\nunsuccessfully demanding their extradition.\r\n\r\nThe British operations against the Sikhs were brought to a successful\r\ntermination; the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gough, with inferior\r\nnumbers, had engaged the enemy at Chillianwalla, with indecisive and\r\nvirtually unfavourable results, and Sir Charles Napier was sent out\r\nto supersede him. Mooltan, where the outrage of the previous year\r\nhad taken place, had been besieged, and fell on the 22nd of January.\r\nDalhousie had established himself at Ferozepore. A week or two later\r\nthe Sikhs and Afghans were overwhelmingly defeated at Gujerat, and on\r\nthe 29th of March the Punjab was incorporated in the British Empire;\r\nthe \"Koh-i-noor\" was, in token of submission, presented by the\r\nMaharajah to the Queen. Lord Dalhousie received a Marquisate, and the\r\nthanks of both Houses of Parliament were voted to all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n1849\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum on Matters connected with the Form of addressing the Pope\r\nin Answer to his Letter to Her Majesty of 4th December 1848._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _5th January 1849._\r\n\r\nThe accompanying draft of answer to the letter which the Pope\r\naddressed to Her Majesty from Gaeta on the 4th of December is in the\r\nsame form as letters which were written to Pope Pius VII. by George\r\nthe Fourth while Prince Regent, and after he came to the Throne. They\r\naddress the Pope as \"Most Eminent Sir,\" style him \"Your Holiness,\" and\r\nfinish with the mere signature after the date of the conclusion of the\r\nletter. Copies of those letters are annexed.\r\n\r\nOther forms of writing Royal letters are:--\r\n\r\n1st. Commencing \"Sir my Brother\" (or \"Sir my Cousin,\" etc., as the\r\ncase may be), and ending thus:\r\n\r\n  \"Sir my _Brother_,\r\n  Your _Majesty's_\r\n  Good _Sister_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the form used between Sovereign and Sovereign.\r\n\r\n2nd. Commencing with the Queen's titles. In these letters the plural\r\n\"we\" and \"our\" are employed instead of \"I\" and \"my,\" and the letters\r\nterminate thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"Your Good Friend,\r\n  ....\"\r\n\r\nThis form is now used almost exclusively for Royal letters to\r\nRepublics.\r\n\r\nIn the State Paper Office there is, with only one exception, no record\r\nof any letter from a Sovereign of England to the Pope from the time of\r\nHenry VIII., when the State Paper Office records commence. The single\r\nexception is an original letter from Queen Mary in 1555 to Pope Paul\r\nIV. It seems that when the time of her expected confinement drew nigh,\r\nshe caused letters to be prepared announcing the birth of a son, and\r\nsigned them in anticipation of the event. When no birth took place,\r\nthe letters were of course not sent off; but they have been preserved\r\nto the present day, and among them is the letter to the Pope. The\r\naccompanying paper contains a copy of the beginning and conclusion of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere is no trace in the State Paper Office of any letter of credence\r\nhaving been given by James II. to Lord Castlemaine in 1685. The\r\ncorrespondence of the reign of James II. is, however, very defective,\r\nand much of it must either have been suppressed or have got into\r\nprivate hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: REPLY TO THE POPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Draft_] _Queen Victoria to Pope Pius IX._[1]\r\n\r\nMOST EMINENT SIR,--I have received the letter which your Holiness\r\naddressed to me from Gaeta on the 4th of December last, and in which\r\nyou acquaint me that in consequence of the violent proceedings of\r\ncertain of your subjects, you had felt yourself obliged to depart from\r\nRome, and for a time to quit your dominions. I assure your Holiness\r\nthat I have been deeply pained at the intelligence of the events to\r\nwhich your letter refers, and that I do the fullest justice to the\r\nmotives which induced your Holiness to withdraw for a time from your\r\ncapital. Your Holiness has given so many proofs of being animated by\r\na sincere desire to improve the condition of the people whom, under\r\nDivine Providence, you have been chosen to govern, and the clemency of\r\nyour heart and the rectitude of your intentions are so well known and\r\nso truly appreciated, that I cannot but hope that the trials which\r\nyou have experienced in consequence of popular commotion will speedily\r\ncome to an end, and will be succeeded by a cordial, good understanding\r\nbetween your Holiness and the Roman people. I request your Holiness to\r\nbelieve that it would afford me real pleasure to be able in any degree\r\nto contribute to a result so much to be desired; and I am happy in\r\nhaving this opportunity of assuring you of my sincere friendship, and\r\nof the unfeigned respect and esteem which I entertain for your person\r\nand character.\r\n\r\nGiven at Windsor Castle the [    ] day of January 1849.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: _See_ p. 204.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER FROM PRINCE LOUIS NAPOLEON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The President of the French Republic to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nELYSEE NATIONAL, _le 22 Janvier 1849._\r\n\r\nTRES CHERE ET GRANDE AMIE,--Une de mes premieres pensees lorsque le\r\nv[oe]u de la nation Francaise m'appela au pouvoir fut de faire part a\r\nvotre Majeste de mon avenement et des sentiments que j'apportais dans\r\nma nouvelle position.\r\n\r\nDes circonstances particulieres ont retarde le depart de l'ambassadeur\r\nqui devait porter ma lettre; mais aujourd'hui que l'Amiral Cecile\r\nse rend a Londres je desire exprimer a votre Majeste la respectueuse\r\nsympathie que j'ai toujours eprouvee pour sa personne; je desire\r\nsurtout lui dire combien je suis reconnaissant de la genereuse\r\nhospitalite qu'elle m'a donnee dans ses etats lorsque j'etais fugitif\r\nou proscrit et combien je serais heureux si ce souvenir pouvait servir\r\na resserrer les liens qui unissent les gouvernements et les peuples de\r\nnos deux pays.\r\n\r\nJe prie votre Majeste de croire a mes sentiments.

Nor could he proceed in the matter without Lord\r\nLansdowne's concurrence.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Hostilities were in progress between the Sicilian\r\n    insurgents and their Sovereign. An agent for the former\r\n    came to England to purchase arms, but was informed by the\r\n    contractor to whom he applied that the whole of his stock had\r\n    been pledged to the Ordnance Office. Lord Palmerston, without\r\n    consulting the Cabinet, allowed this stock to be transferred\r\n    to the insurgents. The matter became public property, and the\r\n    Premier brought it before the Cabinet on the 23rd of January,\r\n    when, somewhat unexpectedly, the Foreign Secretary consented\r\n    to make an apology to the Neapolitan Government; so that the\r\n    crisis terminated for the time.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd January 1849._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord John Russell's letter and enclosures,\r\nthe contents of which have deeply grieved her, as the honour of her\r\nGovernment has always been nearest to her heart. She feels deeply the\r\nhumiliation to have to make an apology to the Government of Naples,\r\nwhich stands so very low in public estimation, and she naturally\r\ndreads the effect this disclosure about the guns will have in the\r\nworld, when she considers how many accusations have been brought\r\nagainst the good faith of this country latterly by many different\r\nGovernments. Of course they will all consider their suspicions and\r\naccusations, however absurd they may have been, as justified and\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nThe Queen supposes that the proposition Lord John makes to her about\r\nmoving Lord Palmerston to Ireland is the result of his conviction that\r\nafter this disclosure it will be no longer to the advantage of the\r\npublic service to leave the direction of the Foreign Affairs in these\r\ncritical times in Lord Palmerston's hands. The Queen will be anxious\r\nto see Lord John upon this subject. All she wishes for is, that\r\nmatters may be so managed as to reflect the least possible discredit\r\nupon the Government and Lord Palmerston himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _6th February 1849._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--We are well. All went off extremely well on\r\nThursday, but the Government must expect difficulties upon their (very\r\ndoubtful) Foreign Policy. I own I do _not_ feel reassured about peace.\r\n_Italy_ and the Pope, etc., are very ticklish subjects.\r\n\r\nEverybody says Louis Napoleon has behaved extremely well in the last\r\ncrisis--full of courage and energy, and they say that he is decidedly\r\nstraightforward, which is not to be despised. I will not admit that\r\nthe _Gemuethlichkeit ist fuer immer begraben_ in Germany; it will surely\r\nreturn when this madness is over, but how soon no one can tell.

Since that period\r\nmany important events have taken place in India, and the last news\r\nhave naturally made the Queen feel very anxious. She deeply laments\r\nthe loss of General Cureton and Colonel Havelock, officers who will\r\nnot be easily replaced. The Queen thinks that Lord Dalhousie has\r\nthroughout acted most judiciously and has thwarted more mischief\r\nbeing done. She will abstain from remarking upon the conduct of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, as she knows that the Duke of Wellington has\r\nwritten fully to Lord Dalhousie on this painful subject.[3] The Queen\r\nconcludes with expressing her hopes that Lord and Lady Dalhousie are\r\nin good health, and with the Prince's kindest remembrances to Lord\r\nDalhousie.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: _See_ Introductory Note for the year, _ante_, p.\r\n    208.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: STATE OF EUROPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _10th February 1849._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I have to offer my most affectionate thanks\r\nfor your dear letter of the 6th. The state of the Queen seems better,\r\nthough I fear not so solidly as to be beyond mischief; but the\r\nimprovement is real, and will act as a moral support. They have been\r\nseverely tried, those poor exiles, and Heaven knows what is still in\r\nstore for them. I don't think that in Italy there will be war. The\r\nFrench cannot think of it for some months, probably not before June or\r\nJuly, and the Italians cannot make it alone without being licked; the\r\nbetter informed know that. The Pope ought to be replaced on his seat\r\nfor the sake of every one; and his ultra-Liberal policy entitles him\r\nto be supported by all Governments and by all right-minded people.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte has not ill-behaved, it seems; negatively he might\r\nhave done much harm. The position continues to be abominable. There\r\nis for every one an _absence d'avenir_ which ruins everything and\r\neverybody--that is the real difficulty.\r\n\r\n_Die Gemuethlichkeit_ in Germany was the consequence of its political\r\nexistence these last thousand years; that is now all going to ruin,\r\nand the _Gemuethlichkeit_ will be as little found again _que l'urbanite\r\nFrancaise_ so much talked of formerly and now unknown.\r\n\r\nThis part of February puts me always in mind of my dear little\r\n_sejour_ with you in 1841.

Personne s'en doutait, et cependant la France s'y\r\nest soumise!\" That the Government was however determined, and so were\r\nall the Departments, that this should never happen again; no doubt the\r\ndanger from the Socialists was great, all over the world; that _that_\r\nwas the _real danger_, and that they would readily make another\r\nattempt like the fearful one in June (the result of which for three\r\ndays was uncertain), but that they had not the power; that he was\r\ncontinually impressing upon all his friends in France the necessity of\r\nsupporting _whatever_ form of Government there was _whose object_ was\r\nthe _maintenance of order_, and to unite \"contre cet ennemi commun.\"\r\nThe President, he continued, had risen amazingly in the opinion of\r\nevery one by his firmness, courage, and determination--which he had\r\nshown in those critical days a fortnight or three weeks ago--and that\r\nin these two months he had acquired \"une grande aptitude pour\r\nles affaires; tout le monde est etonne, parce que personne ne s'y\r\nattendait.\" He spoke with great delight of Belgium--and how it had\r\nstood the shock of the events in France--and also of England.

It\r\nis an extraordinary production for people of the working classes, and\r\nthere are a great many sound and good observations in it on education;\r\nthe observations on the deficiency in the religious instruction and\r\nin the _preaching_ the Queen thinks are particularly true. It\r\nlikewise shows a lofty and enlarged _view_ of education which is often\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Queen takes this occasion of repeating her hope that _Gaelic_ will\r\nbe taught in future in the Highland schools, as well as English, as\r\nit is really a great mistake that the people should be constantly\r\n_talking_ a language which they often cannot read and generally not\r\nwrite. Being very partial to her loyal and good Highlanders, the Queen\r\ntakes much interest in what she thinks will tend more than anything\r\nto keep up their simplicity of character, which she considers a great\r\nmerit in these days.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks equally that Welsh should be taught in Wales as well\r\nas English.[5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: This book was probably _Popular Education, as\r\n    regards Juvenile Delinquency_, by Thos.

I wish you could be here, for I never remember\r\nfiner weather than we have had since we came here; perfect summer, and\r\nso sweet, so enjoyable, and then with all the pleasures and beauties\r\nof Spring you have that beautiful sea--so blue and smooth as it has\r\nbeen these three days. If we have no mountains to boast of, we have\r\nthe _sea_, which is ever enjoyable. We have camelias which have stood\r\nout two winters covered with _red_ flowers, and scarlet rhododendrons\r\nin brilliant bloom. Does this not sound tempting? It seems almost\r\nwrong to be at home, and Albert really hardly is.\r\n\r\nI wish you joy of your _twenty-four_ foxes. If there was a black one\r\namongst them I should beg for one, as the skin you sent me last year\r\nwas _not_ a black one.\r\n\r\nThe news from India are very distressing, and make one very anxious,\r\nbut Sir Charles Napier is instantly to be sent out to supersede Lord\r\nGough, and he is so well versed in Indian tactics that we may look\r\nwith safety to the future _after_ his arrival.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Question remains very complicated, and the German one a\r\nvery perplexing, sad one. Prussia must protect the poor Princes and\r\nput herself at the head, else there is no hope. Austria should behave\r\nbetter, and not oppose the consolidation of a central Power, else I\r\nknow not what is to become of poor Germany.\r\n\r\nPray use your influence to prevent more fatal mischief.\r\n\r\nNow adieu, dearest Uncle.

The Protectionists, animated by the\r\ncry of agricultural distress, are disposed to use their power to the\r\nutmost. Mr Disraeli shows himself a much abler and less passionate\r\nleader than Lord George Bentinck.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the friends of Sir Robert Peel and the party of Mr\r\nCobden unite with the Government in resisting the Protectionist party.\r\nThe House of Commons thus gives a majority, which, though not compact,\r\nis decided at once against the extreme Tory and the extreme Radical\r\nparty. With such a House of Commons the great interests of the\r\nThrone and the Constitution are safe. An abrupt dissolution would put\r\neverything to hazard.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: On Mr Disraeli's motion for payment of the half\r\n    of local rates by the Treasury, which was defeated by 280 to\r\n    189.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: END OF THE SIKH WAR]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MRS GEORGE LAWRENCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Dalhousie to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCAMP, FEROZEPORE, _24th March 1849._\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General presents his most humble duty to your Majesty,\r\nand has the honour of acknowledging the receipt of the letter which\r\nyour Majesty most graciously addressed to him on the 5th of February.\r\n\r\nHe is deeply sensible of your Majesty's goodness, and most grateful\r\nfor the expression of approbation which it has conveyed.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General is not without fear that he may have intruded too\r\noften of late upon your Majesty's time. But he is so satisfied of the\r\nextreme pleasure which your Majesty would experience on learning that\r\nthe prisoners who were in the hands of the Sikhs, and especially the\r\nladies and children, were once again safe in the British camp, that he\r\nwould have ventured to convey to your Majesty that intelligence,\r\neven though he had not been able to add to it--as happily he can--the\r\nannouncement of the surrender of the whole Khalsa army, and the end of\r\nthe war with the Sikhs.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Gilbert pushed on rapidly in pursuit of the Sikhs, who\r\nwere a few marches in front of him, carrying off our prisoners with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt Rawul Pindee, half-way between the Jhelum and Attock, the Sikh\r\ntroops, as we have since heard, would go no further. They received no\r\npay, they were starving, they had been beaten and were disheartened;\r\nand so they surrendered.\r\n\r\nAll the prisoners were brought safe into our camp. Forty-one pieces of\r\nartillery were given up. Chuttur Singh and Shere Singh, with all the\r\nSirdars, delivered their swords to General Gilbert in the presence of\r\nhis officers; and the remains of the Sikh army, 16,000 strong, were\r\nmarched into camp, by 1000 at a time, and laid down their arms as they\r\npassed between the lines of the British troops.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty may well imagine the pride with which British Officers\r\nlooked on such a scene, and witnessed this absolute subjection and\r\nhumiliation of so powerful an enemy.\r\n\r\nHow deeply the humiliation was felt by the Sikhs themselves may be\r\njudged by the report which the officers who were present have made,\r\nthat many of them, and especially the grim old Khalsas of Runjeet's\r\ntime, exclaimed as they threw their arms down upon the heap: \"This day\r\nRunjeet Singh has died!\"\r\n\r\nUpwards of 20,000 stands of arms were taken in the hills. Vast\r\nquantities were gathered after the flight of the Sikhs from Gujerat.\r\nAs a further precaution, the Governor-General has ordered a disarming\r\nof the Sikhs throughout the Eastern Doabs, while they are yet cast\r\ndown and afraid of punishment. He trusts that these measures may all\r\ntend to ensure the continuance of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdars will arrive at Lahore to-day, where they will await the\r\ndetermination of their future places of residence. The officers who\r\nwere prisoners have also reached Lahore, together with Mrs George\r\nLawrence and her children.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak too highly of the admirable spirit which\r\nthis lady has displayed during many months of very arduous trial.\r\n\r\nBy the kindness of others, the Governor-General has had the\r\nopportunity of seeing constantly the little notes which were secretly\r\ndespatched by her from her prison. The gallant heart she kept up under\r\nit all, the cheerful face she put upon it, and the unrepining patience\r\nwith which she bore the privations of captivity and the dangers which\r\nit threatened to her children, her husband, and herself, must command\r\nthe highest respect and make one proud of one's countrywomen.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gilbert, by the latest intelligence, had seized the fort of\r\nAttock, had crossed the Indus, and was advancing on Peshawur, whither\r\nthe Afghans had retired.\r\n\r\nBy next mail the Governor-General trusts that he will be able to\r\nannounce that every enemy has been swept away by your Majesty's\r\nArmies, and that the Afghans have either been crushed like the Sikhs\r\nor have fled to Cabul again.\r\n\r\nHe has the honour to subscribe himself, your Majesty's most obedient,\r\nmost humble and very faithful Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nDALHOUSIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING OF SARDINIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of Sardinia_ (_Victor Emanuel_) _to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nTURIN, _le 30 Mars 1849._\r\n\r\nMA TRES CHERE S[OE]UR,--La participation officielle que je m'empresse\r\nde vous donner de mon avenement au trone m'offre une occasion que je\r\nsuis heureux de saisir pour vous exprimer dans une lettre de ma main\r\nles sentiments de ma vive gratitude pour l'affection dont ma maison a\r\nrecu des preuves marquantes et reiterees de votre part, comme pour\r\nle bienveillant interet que votre Gouvernement a temoigne a ce pays\r\nparticulierement dans les graves evenements qui ont eu lieu pendant\r\ncette derniere annee.\r\n\r\nJe vous prie d'etre persuadee que rien n'est plus sincere que\r\nla reconnaissance que j'en conserve, et de me laisser nourrir la\r\nconfiance que je puis compter sur la continuation de ces dispositions\r\nsi aimables.\r\n\r\nEn vous renouvelant les sentiments d'amitie la plus parfaite, je suis,\r\nvotre tres cher Frere,\r\n\r\nVICTOR EMANUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _10th April 1849._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--You will, I am sure, share our joy at Ernest's\r\n_wonderful_ success at Eckerforde.[7] It is a marvellous piece of good\r\nfortune _pour son bapteme de feu_, but it alarmed and agitated us all\r\nto think that he might have been wounded, _to say the least_, for he\r\nhad his horse killed under him. At all events, he has done honour to\r\nthe poor race to which he belongs, and it makes us both very happy.\r\nI think it will tend decidedly to shorten the war. Poor dear\r\nAlexandrine! in what anxiety she will have been.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Novara[8] seems to have been one of the hardest fought\r\nand most brilliant battles known for years and years, and old Radetzky\r\nsays that he must name every individual if he was to do justice to\r\nofficers and men. But the loss was very severe. The regiment of Kinsky\r\nlost _twenty-four_ officers! The Archduke Albert distinguished himself\r\nexceedingly, which is worthy of his noble father.

If only _some sort_ of arrangement could be made; then\r\nafterwards there might be modifications, both in the Constitution,\r\netc., for that Constitution never will work well.\r\n\r\nOur Navigation Laws debate in the House of Lords began last night, and\r\nis to be concluded to-night. There seems to be almost a certainty that\r\nthere will be a majority, though a very small one, and the danger of\r\ncourse exists that any accident may turn it the other way.\r\n\r\nKnowing your esteem for our worthy friend, Sir Robert Peel, you will,\r\nI am sure, be glad to hear that his second son, Frederick,[10] made\r\nsuch a beautiful speech--his maiden speech--in the House of Commons\r\nlast night; he was complimented by every one, and Sir Robert was\r\ndelighted. I am so glad for him, and also rejoice to see that there is\r\na young man who promises to be of use hereafter to his country.\r\n\r\nAlbert is again gone to lay a first stone.

The\r\naccount in the _Times_ is quite correct. The indignation, loyalty, and\r\naffection this act has called forth is very gratifying and touching.\r\n\r\nAlice gives a very good account of it, and Lenchen[12] even says, \"Man\r\nshot, tried to shoot dear Mamma, must be punished.\" They, Affie, and\r\nMiss Macdonald were with me.

She would only require that she would not be pressed for an\r\nanswer within a few minutes, as is now done sometimes.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston could always manage so that there are twelve or\r\ntwenty-four hours left for reference to you, and consideration, and\r\nthere are few instances in which business would suffer from so short\r\na delay. As Lord Palmerston knows when the Mails go, he has only\r\nto write in time for them, and he must recollect that the 28,000\r\ndespatches in the year come to you and to the Queen as well as to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nShould the Queen in future have to make any remark, she will make it\r\nto you, if that will suit you.

The union of Schleswig and Holstein[14] is\r\nnot an ideal one, but _complete_ as to Constitution, Finance, Customs,\r\nJurisdiction, Church, Universities, Poor Law, Settlement, Debts, etc.,\r\netc., etc. It is _not established_ by the Kings-Dukes, but has existed\r\nfor centuries. To defend Holstein against the attack made by Denmark\r\nupon this union, Germany joined the war. It is true that it is\r\nnow proposed in the new Constitution for Germany to consent to the\r\nseparation of Schleswig and Holstein, although last year the Frankfort\r\nParliament had desired the incorporation of Schleswig into Germany\r\nwith Holstein; but the question for Germany is now not to begin a war,\r\nbut to close one by a lasting peace. In this she has, in the Queen's\r\nopinion, a right and a duty to see that the independence of Schleswig\r\nis secured before she abandons that country. The comparison with\r\nSaxony does not hold good for a moment, for the Schleswig Revolution\r\nwas not directed against the Duke, but against the King of Denmark,\r\nwho invaded the rights of the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein; the\r\nassistance of Prussia could therefore not be given to Denmark, but to\r\nSchleswig-Holstein. The case of Hungary has neither any similitude.\r\nHungary is not to be torn from its connection with the German States\r\nby the Austrian Government, but just the reverse.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston cannot be more anxious for a speedy termination of the\r\nDanish war than the Queen is, but she thinks that the mediation will\r\nnot effect this as long as the mediating power merely watches which\r\nof the two parties is in the greatest difficulties for the moment, and\r\nurges it to give way; but by a careful and anxious discovery of the\r\nrights of the question and a steady adherence to the recommendation\r\nthat what is right and fair ought to be done. The cause of the\r\nwar having been the unlawful attempt to incorporate Schleswig into\r\nDenmark, the peace cannot be lasting unless it contains sufficient\r\nguarantees against the resumption of that scheme.[15]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: Schleswig had been claimed by Germany as an\r\n    integral part of her territory, and a war between Germany and\r\n    Denmark was in progress.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: In reply, Lord Palmerston expressed entire\r\n    concurrence in the justice of the principles which the Queen\r\n    indicated as being those which ought to guide a mediating\r\n    Power.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PROPOSED VISIT TO IRELAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\n_23rd June 1849._\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform your Excellency that I have received\r\nthe Queen's commands to acquaint you that Her Majesty hopes to be able\r\nin the course of the present summer to fulfil the intention, which you\r\nare aware she has long entertained, of a visit to Ireland. The general\r\ndistress unfortunately still prevalent in Ireland precludes the\r\nQueen from visiting Dublin in state, and thereby causing ill-timed\r\nexpenditure and inconvenience to her subjects; yet Her Majesty does\r\nnot wish to let another year pass without visiting a part of her\r\ndominions which she has for so long a time been anxious personally\r\nto become acquainted with. She accordingly will, at some sacrifice\r\nof personal convenience, take a longer sea voyage, for the purpose\r\nof visiting in the first instance the Cove of Cork, and from thence\r\nproceed along the Irish coast to Dublin. After remaining there a\r\nfew days, during which time Her Majesty will be the guest of your\r\nExcellency, she would continue her cruise along the Irish coast\r\nnorthward and visit Belfast, and from thence cross to Scotland.\r\nAlthough the precise time of Her Majesty's visit cannot yet be fixed,\r\nit will probably take place as early in August as the termination of\r\nthe session of Parliament will permit, and I feel assured that this\r\nearly announcement of her intentions will be received with great\r\nsatisfaction by Her Majesty's loyal and faithful subjects in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _19th July 1849._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letters.

We shall\r\nbe very glad to see him at Balmoral on the 20th or 22nd of August.\r\n\r\nWe hope Lady John and the baby continue to go on well.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Lord John George de la Poer Beresford\r\n    (1773-1862) was Archbishop of Armagh from 1822 until his\r\n    death.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ARRIVAL IN DUBLIN]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE IRISH VISIT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nLODGE, PH[OE]NIX PARK, _6th August 1849._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Though this letter will only go to-morrow, I will\r\nbegin it to-day and tell you that everything has gone off beautifully\r\nsince we arrived in Ireland, and that our entrance into Dublin was\r\nreally a magnificent thing. By my letter to Louise you will have\r\nheard of our arrival in the Cove of Cork. Our visit to Cork was very\r\nsuccessful; the Mayor was knighted _on deck_ (on board the _Fairy_),\r\nlike in times of old. Cork is about seventeen miles up the River Lee,\r\nwhich is beautifully wooded and reminds us of Devonshire scenery. We\r\nhad previously stepped on shore at _Cove_, a small place, to enable\r\nthem to call it _Queen's Town_; the enthusiasm is immense, and at Cork\r\nthere was more firing than I remember since the Rhine.\r\n\r\nWe left Cork with fair weather, but a head sea and contrary wind which\r\nmade it rough and me very sick.\r\n\r\n_7th._--I was unable to continue till now, and have since received\r\nyour kind letter, for which I return my warmest thanks. We went into\r\nWaterford Harbour on Saturday afternoon, which is likewise a fine,\r\nlarge, safe harbour. Albert went up to Waterford in the _Fairy_, but\r\nI did not. The next morning we received much the same report of the\r\nweather which we had done at Cork, viz. that the weather was fair but\r\nthe wind contrary. However we went out, as it could not be helped,\r\nand we might have remained there some days for no use. The first three\r\nhours were very nasty, but afterwards it cleared and the evening was\r\nbeautiful. The entrance at seven o'clock into Kingston Harbour was\r\nsplendid; we came in with ten steamers, and the whole harbour,\r\nwharf, and every surrounding place was _covered_ with _thousands_ and\r\nthousands of people, who received us with the greatest enthusiasm. We\r\ndisembarked yesterday morning at ten o'clock, and took two hours\r\nto come here. The most perfect order was maintained in spite of the\r\nimmense mass of people assembled, and a more good-humoured crowd I\r\nnever saw, but noisy and excitable beyond belief, talking, jumping,\r\nand shrieking instead of cheering. There were numbers of troops out,\r\nand it really was a wonderful scene. This is a very pretty place,\r\nand the house reminds me of dear Claremont. The view of the Wicklow\r\nMountains from the windows is very beautiful, and the whole park is\r\nvery extensive and full of very fine trees.\r\n\r\nWe drove out yesterday afternoon and were followed by jaunting-cars\r\nand riders and people running and screaming, which would have amused\r\nyou. In the evening we had a dinner party, and so we have to-night.\r\nThis morning we visited the Bank, the Model School (where the\r\nProtestant and Catholic Archbishops received us), and the College, and\r\nthis afternoon we went to the Military Hospital. To-morrow we have a\r\nLevee, where 1,700 are to be presented, and the next day a Review, and\r\nin the evening the Drawing-Room, when 900 ladies are to be presented.\r\n\r\nGeorge[17] is here, and has a command here. He rode on one side of our\r\ncarriage yesterday. You see more ragged and wretched people here than\r\nI ever saw anywhere else. _En revanche_, the women are really very\r\nhandsome--quite in the lowest class--as well at Cork as here; such\r\nbeautiful black eyes and hair and such fine colours and teeth.\r\n\r\nI must now take my leave. Ever your most affectionate Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The late Duke of Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Sir George Grey._\r\n\r\nVICE-REGAL LODGE, _14th August 1849._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GREY,--If I had known where to direct I should have thanked\r\nyou sooner for your two welcome letters from Belfast, where everything\r\nseems to have gone off to our hearts' desire, and the Queen's\r\npresence, as the Stipendiary Magistrate writes word, has united all\r\nclasses and parties in a manner incredible to those who know the\r\ndistance at which they have hitherto been kept asunder.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm here has not abated, and there is not an individual\r\nin Dublin that does not take as a personal compliment to himself the\r\nQueen's having gone upon the paddle-box and having ordered the Royal\r\nStandard to be lowered three times.\r\n\r\nEven the ex-Clubbists,[18] who threatened broken heads and windows\r\nbefore the Queen came, are now among the most loyal of her subjects,\r\nand are ready, according to the police reports, to fight any one who\r\ndare say a disrespectful word of Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nIn short, the people are not only enchanted with the Queen and the\r\ngracious kindness of her manner and the confidence she has shown in\r\nthem, but they are pleased with themselves for their own good feelings\r\nand behaviour, which they consider have removed the barrier that\r\nhitherto existed between the Sovereign and themselves, and that they\r\nnow occupy a higher position in the eyes of the world. Friend Bright\r\nwas with me to-day, and said he would not for the world have missed\r\nseeing the embarkation at Kingston, for he had felt just the same\r\nenthusiasm as the rest of the crowd. \"Indeed,\" he added, \"I'll defy\r\nany man to have felt otherwise when he saw the Queen come upon the\r\nplatform and bow to the people in a manner that showed her heart was\r\nwith them.\" He didn't disguise either that the Monarchical principle\r\nhad made great way with him since Friday. Ever yours truly,\r\n\r\nCLARENDON.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Seditious clubs had been an important factor in\r\n    the Irish disturbances of 1848.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BREVET PROMOTIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _3rd October 1849._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's explanation respecting the\r\nbrevet promotions on the occasion of her visit to Ireland, but cannot\r\nsay that his objections have convinced her of the impropriety of\r\nsuch a promotion (to a limited extent). To Lord John's fears of the\r\ndangerous consequences of the precedent, the Queen has only to answer,\r\nthat there can be only _one first visit_ to Ireland, and that the\r\n_first_ visit to Scotland in 1842 was followed by a few promotions,\r\nwithout this entailing promotions on her subsequent visits to that\r\npart of the country; that even the first visit to the Channel\r\nIslands was followed by a few promotions, and this under Lord\r\nJohn's Government. All the precedents being in accordance with\r\nthe proposition made by the Duke, an opposition on the part of the\r\nGovernment would imply a declaration against all brevets except in the\r\nfield, which would deprive the Crown of a most valuable prerogative.\r\nIf such a brevet as the one proposed were to lead to great additional\r\nexpense, the Queen could understand the objection on the ground of\r\neconomy; but the giving brevet rank to a few subaltern officers is too\r\ntrifling a matter to alarm the Government. Perhaps the number might be\r\nreduced even, but to deviate from the established precedents for\r\nthe first time altogether in this case, and that after the excellent\r\nbehaviour of the Army in Ireland under very trying circumstances,\r\nwould be felt as a great injustice.\r\n\r\nThe Queen therefore wishes Lord John to ask the Duke to send him\r\nthe former precedents and to consider with his colleagues whether a\r\nmodified recommendation cannot be laid before her.[19]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: The Duke of Wellington had submitted a list\r\n    of Officers for brevet promotion, which received the Queen's\r\n    sanction; but the list was afterwards reduced.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWOBURN ABBEY, _4th October 1849._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and will\r\nconsider, in communication with the Duke of Wellington, whether any\r\nmodified list can be proposed by him to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe economy, as your Majesty truly observes, is not a matter of much\r\nconsideration. But to reward Officers on the Staff, who are already\r\nfavoured by being placed on the Staff in Ireland, is a practice which\r\ntends but too much to encourage the opinion that promotions in the\r\nArmy and Navy are given not to merit, but to aristocratical connection\r\nand official favour.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the degradation of Thrones which the last two years\r\nhave seen in Europe, it will be well if the English Crown preserves\r\nall its just prerogatives, and has only to relinquish some customary\r\nabuses, which are not useful to the Sovereign, and are only an\r\nequivocal advantage to the Ministers of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A PUBLIC THANKSGIVING]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st October 1849._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord John Russell's letter, and was much\r\nrejoiced at everything having gone off so well yesterday;[20] she was\r\nvery much annoyed at being unable to go herself, and that the untoward\r\nchicken-pox should have come at this moment; she is, however, quite\r\nrecovered, though still much marked.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the proposition about the Thanksgiving, the Queen\r\nquite approves of it, and (_if it is generally preferred_) that it\r\nshould be on a week-day. As to the Bishop of London's proposal,[21]\r\nthe Queen thinks that Lord John may have misunderstood him; she\r\nsupposes that he meant that she should attend _some_ place of _public\r\nworship_, and not in her domestic chapel, in order to join in the\r\npublic demonstration. The Queen is quite ready to go with her Court\r\nto St George's Chapel here; but she would like it to take place on\r\nan earlier day than the 27th of November, when she would probably be\r\nalready in the Isle of Wight, where we think of going as usual on the\r\n22nd or 23rd.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: The ceremony of opening the new Coal Exchange,\r\n    at which, besides Prince Albert, the Prince of Wales and\r\n    Princess Royal were present.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: There had been a severe epidemic of cholera in\r\n    the country.

In\r\nanswer to your Majesty's enquiry, he has to state that a very short\r\nconversation took place in the Cabinet on the affairs of Germany upon\r\nan enquiry of Lord John Russell whether the Diet of Erfurt[22] might\r\nnot be considered a violation of the Treaties of 1815. Lord Palmerston\r\nthought not, but had not examined the question.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Germany are in a critical position; Austria will\r\noppose anything which tends to aggrandise Prussia; Prussia will\r\noppose anything which tends to free Government; and France will oppose\r\nanything which tends to strengthen Germany. Still, all these powers\r\nmight be disregarded were Germany united, but it is obvious that\r\nBavaria and Wuertemberg look to Austria and France for support, while\r\nHanover and Saxony will give a very faint assistance to a Prussian\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\nThe matter is very critical, but probably will not lead to war.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: In order to effect the consolidation of Germany,\r\n    the King of Prussia had summoned a Federal Parliament to meet\r\n    at Erfurt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _30th November 1849._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and in\r\nreply to your Majesty's enquiry as to what the measures would be\r\nwhich Sir William Parker[23] would have to take in order to support Mr\r\nWyse's[24] demands for redress for certain wrongs sustained by British\r\nand Ionian subjects, begs to say that the ordinary and accustomed\r\nmethod of enforcing such demands is by reprisals--that is to say,\r\nby seizing some vessels and property of the party which refuses\r\nredress,[25] and retaining possession thereof until redress is\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nAnother method is the blockading of the ports of the party by whom\r\nredress is refused, and by interrupting commercial intercourse to\r\ncause inconvenience and loss. Viscount Palmerston, however, does not\r\napprehend that any active measures of this kind will be required, but\r\nrather expects that when the Greek Government finds that the demand\r\nis made in earnest, and that means are at hand to enforce it,\r\nsatisfaction will at last be given. The refusal of the Greek\r\nGovernment to satisfy these claims, and the offensive neglect\r\nwith which they have treated the applications of your Majesty's\r\nrepresentative at Athens have, as Viscount Palmerston is convinced,\r\nbeen the result of a belief that the British Government never would\r\ntake any real steps in order to press these matters to a settlement.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Commanding the Mediterranean Fleet.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: British Envoy at Athens.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: _See_ Introductory Note for 1850, _post_, p.\r\n    231.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF QUEEN ADELAIDE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _11th December 1849._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Thank you much for your kind letter of the 6th;\r\nyou will have received mine of the 4th shortly after you wrote. I\r\nknow _how_ you would mourn with us over the death of our beloved Queen\r\nAdelaide. _We_ have lost the kindest and dearest of friends, and the\r\n_universal_ feeling of sorrow, of regret, and of _real_ appreciation\r\nof her character is very touching and gratifying. _All_ parties, _all_\r\nclasses, join in doing her justice. Much was done to set Mamma against\r\nher, but the dear Queen ever forgave this, ever showed love and\r\naffection, and for the last eight years their friendship was as great\r\nas ever. Ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ministry were still (1850) able, relying on the support of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, to resist the attacks of the Protectionists in the House\r\nof Commons, though their majority on a critical occasion fell to\r\ntwenty-one; but they were rehabilitated by the discussions on foreign\r\npolicy. One Don Pacifico, a Portuguese Jew, a native of Gibraltar and\r\na British subject, had had his house in Athens pillaged by a mob; he,\r\nwith Mr Finlay, the historian, who had a money claim against the Greek\r\nGovernment, instead of establishing their claims in the local courts,\r\nsought the intervention of the home Government; Lord Palmerston, whose\r\nrelations with the Court were even more strained than usual, resolved\r\nto make a hostile demonstration against Greece, and a fleet was sent\r\nto the Piraeus with a peremptory demand for settlement. The House of\r\nLords condemned this high-handed action, but a friendly motion\r\nof confidence was made in the Commons, and Lord Palmerston had an\r\nextraordinary triumph, by a majority of forty-six, notwithstanding\r\nthat the ablest men outside the Ministry spoke against him, and that\r\nhis unsatisfactory relations with the Queen were about to culminate in\r\na severe reprimand.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel's speech in this debate proved to be his last public\r\nutterance, his premature death, resulting from a fall from his horse,\r\ntaking place a few days later; Louis Philippe, who had been living\r\nin retirement at Claremont, passed away about the same time. Another\r\nattack on the Queen, this time a blow with a cane, was made by one\r\nRobert Pate, an ex-officer and well-connected; the plea of insanity\r\nwas not established, and Pate was transported.\r\n\r\nPublic attention was being drawn to the projected Exhibition in Hyde\r\nPark, Prince Albert making a memorable speech at the Mansion House\r\nin support of the scheme; the popular voice had not been unanimous in\r\napproval, and subscriptions had hung fire, but henceforward matters\r\nimproved, and Mr Paxton's design for a glass and iron structure was\r\naccepted and proceeded with.\r\n\r\nThe friction with Lord Palmerston was again increased by his action\r\nin respect to General Haynau, an Austrian whose cruelty had been\r\nnotorious, and who was assaulted by some of the _employes_ at a London\r\nbrewery. The Foreign Office note to the Austrian Government nearly\r\nbrought about Palmerston's resignation, which was much desired by the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year the whole country was in a ferment at the\r\nissue of a Papal Brief, re-establishing the hierarchy of Bishops\r\nin England with local titles derived from their sees; and Cardinal\r\nWiseman, thenceforward Archbishop of Westminster, by issuing a\r\npastoral letter on the subject, made matters worse. The Protestant\r\nspirit was aroused, the two Universities presented petitions, and the\r\nPrime Minister, in a letter to the Bishop of Durham, helped to fan\r\nthe \"No Popery\" flame. Just at a time when a coalition of Whigs and\r\nPeelites was beginning to be possible, an Ecclesiastical Titles Bill,\r\nalmost fatal to mutual confidence, became necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n1850\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _5th February 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR UNCLE,--We had the house full for three days last week on\r\naccount of our theatrical performances on Friday, which went off\r\nextremely well.

This is of great importance, as it\r\nputs a stop to the excitement and expectations of the farmers, which\r\nhave been falsely kept up by the aristocracy....\r\n\r\nI must now conclude.

If the demands were for the British Government, we\r\nmight forego what portions we might like to give up, but we have no\r\nright to be easy and generous with the rights and claims of other\r\npeople.

Lord\r\nPalmerston has a perfect right to state to the Queen his reasons for\r\ndisagreeing with her views, and will always have found her ready to\r\nlisten to his reasons; but she cannot allow a servant of the Crown\r\nand her Minister to act contrary to her orders, and this without her\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: _See_ Ashley's _Palmerston_, vol. i. chap. v.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON'S EXPLANATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCARLTON GARDENS. _17th February 1850._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and in\r\nreply to your Majesty's communication of this day, he begs to\r\nstate that upon receiving, the day before yesterday, your Majesty's\r\nMemorandum on the proposed draft to Mr Wyse, together with the\r\naccompanying Memorandum[3] from Lord John Russell, he altered the\r\ndraft, and sent it to Lord John Russell, and received it back from\r\nLord John Russell with the accompanying note in answer to that which\r\nhe wrote to Lord John Russell. It was important that the messenger\r\nshould go off that evening, and the time occupied in these\r\ncommunications rendered it just, but barely, possible to despatch the\r\nmessenger by the mail train of that evening. The despatch thus altered\r\ncoincided with the views of your Majesty and Lord John Russell as to\r\nthe question in regard to the length of time during which reprisals\r\nshould be suspended to give scope for the French negotiation. The\r\nother question as to giving Mr Wyse a latitude of discretion to\r\nentertain any proposition which might be made to him by the Greek\r\nGovernment was considered by the Cabinet at its meeting yesterday\r\nafternoon, and Viscount Palmerston gave Mr Wyse a latitude of that\r\nkind in regard to the claim of Mr Pacifico, the only one to which\r\nthat question could apply, in a despatch which he sent by the overland\r\nMediterranean mail which went off yesterday afternoon. That despatch\r\nalso contained some instructions as to the manner in which Mr Wyse\r\nis to communicate with Baron Gros,[4] and those instructions were the\r\nresult of a conversation which Viscount Palmerston had with the French\r\nAmbassador after the meeting of the Cabinet. Viscount Palmerston was\r\nonly waiting for a copy of the despatch of yesterday evening, which,\r\nowing to this day being Sunday, he has not yet received, in order to\r\nsend to your Majesty the altered draft of yesterday evening, with\r\nan explanation of the circumstances which rendered it impossible to\r\nsubmit them to your Majesty before they were sent off.[5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Lord John Russell's opinion was that three weeks\r\n    should be allowed to Mr Wyse and Sir W.

He premised\r\nthat Lord Palmerston had at all times been a most agreeable and\r\naccommodating colleague; that he had acted with Lord John ever since\r\n1831, and had not only never made any difficulty, but acted most\r\nboldly and in the most spirited manner on all political questions;\r\nbesides, he was very popular with the Radical part of the House of\r\nCommons as well as with the Protectionist, so that both would be ready\r\nto receive him as their Leader; he (Lord John) was therefore most\r\nanxious to do nothing which could hurt Lord Palmerston's feelings, nor\r\nto bring about a disruption of the Whig Party, which at this moment\r\nof Party confusion was the only one which still held together. On the\r\nother hand, the fact that the Queen distrusted Lord Palmerston was a\r\nserious impediment to the carrying on of the Government. Lord John was\r\ntherefore anxious to adopt a plan by which Lord Palmerston's services\r\ncould be retained with his own goodwill, and the Foreign Affairs\r\nentrusted to other hands. The only plan he could think of was to give\r\nLord Palmerston the lead in the House of Commons--the highest position\r\na statesman could aspire to--and to go himself to the House of Lords.\r\nHe had communicated his views to Lord Lansdowne, who agreed in them,\r\nand thought he could do nothing better than speak to Lord Palmerston\r\nat once. Lord Palmerston said that he could not have helped to have\r\nbecome aware that he had forfeited the Queen's confidence, but he\r\nthought this had not been on _personal_ grounds, but merely on account\r\nof his line of policy, with which the Queen disagreed. (The Queen\r\ninterrupted Lord John by remarking that she distrusted him on\r\n_personal_ grounds also, but I remarked that Lord Palmerston had so\r\nfar at least seen rightly; that he had become disagreeable to the\r\nQueen, not on account of his person, but of his political doings,\r\nto which the Queen assented.) Lord Palmerston appeared to Lord John\r\nwilling to enter into this agreement.\r\n\r\nOn the question how the Foreign Office should be filled, Lord John\r\nsaid that he thought his father-in-law, Lord Minto, ought to take\r\nthe Foreign Office.... As the Queen was somewhat startled by this\r\nannouncement, I said I thought that would not go down with the public.\r\nAfter Lord Palmerston's removal (who was considered one of the ablest\r\nmen in the country) he ought not to be replaced but by an equally able\r\nstatesman; the Office was of _enormous_ importance, and ought not to\r\nbe entrusted to any one but Lord John himself or Lord Clarendon. On\r\nthe Queen's enquiry why Lord Clarendon had not been proposed for it,\r\nLord John said he was most anxious that the change of the Minister\r\nshould not produce a change in the general line of policy which he\r\nconsidered to have been quite right, and that Lord Clarendon did\r\nnot approve of it; somehow or other he never could agree with\r\nLord Clarendon on Foreign Affairs; he thought Lord Clarendon very\r\nanti-French and for an alliance with Austria and Russia. The Queen\r\nreplied she knew Lord Clarendon's bad opinion of the mode in which the\r\nForeign Affairs had been conducted, and thought that a merit in him,\r\nbut did not think him Austrian or Russian, but merely disapproving\r\nof Lord Palmerston's behaviour. I urged Lord John to take the Foreign\r\nAffairs himself, which he said would have to be done if the Queen did\r\nnot wish Lord Minto to take them; he himself would be able to do the\r\nbusiness when in the House of Lords, although he would undertake it\r\nunwillingly; with the business in the House of Commons it would have\r\nbeen impossible for him.\r\n\r\nThe Queen insisted on his trying it with a seat in the House of Lords,\r\nadding that, if he found it too much for him, he could at a later\r\nperiod perhaps make the Department over to Lord Clarendon.\r\n\r\nI could not help remarking that it was a serious risk to entrust Lord\r\nPalmerston with the lead in the House of Commons, that it might be\r\nthat the Government were defeated and, if once in opposition, Lord\r\nPalmerston might take a different line as leader of the Opposition\r\nfrom that which Lord John would like, and might so easily force\r\nhimself back into office as Prime Minister. Lord John, however,\r\nalthough admitting that danger, thought Lord Palmerston too old to do\r\nmuch in the future (having passed his sixty-fifth year); he admitted\r\nthat Sir George Grey was the natural leader of the Commons, but\r\nexpected that a little later the lead would still fall into his hands.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the Offices as proposed would be that Lord\r\nPalmerston would take the Home Office, and Sir George Grey the\r\nColonial Office, and Lord Grey vacate this office for the Privy\r\nSeal. If Lord Minto, however, was not to have the Foreign Office, the\r\narrangement must be recast. Lord Clarendon would become Secretary\r\nof State for Ireland, after the abolition of the Lord-Lieutenancy.\r\nPossibly also Sir George Grey might take the office, and Lord\r\nClarendon take the Colonies, which Lord Grey would be glad to be rid\r\nof. On my observing that I had thought the Colonies would have done\r\nbest for Lord Palmerston, leaving Sir George Grey at the Home Office,\r\nLord John acknowledged that he would likewise prefer this arrangement,\r\nbut considered it rendered impossible from its having been the very\r\nthing Lord Grey had proposed in 1845, and upon which the attempt to\r\nform a Whig Government at that time had broken down, Lord Palmerston\r\nhaving refused to enter the Cabinet on those terms. Lord John ended\r\nby saying that Lord Palmerston having agreed to the change, it was\r\nintended that nothing should be done about it till after the close of\r\nthe Session, in order to avoid debates and questions on the subject;\r\nmoreover, Lord Lansdowne had agreed to continue still this Session his\r\nlabours as Leader in the House of Lords, and begged for the _utmost\r\nsecrecy_ at present.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell already last year had spoken to me of his wish to\r\ngo to the House of Lords, finding the work in the House of Commons,\r\ntogether with his other business, too much for him, and Lord Lansdowne\r\nbeing desirous to be relieved from the lead in the Upper House.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S ULTIMATUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Baron Stockmar._[6]\r\n\r\n_12th March 1850._\r\n\r\nThe least the Queen has a right to require of her Minister is:--\r\n\r\n1.

King Louis Philippe seems better, but still\r\nhe is evidently breaking; there is no wonder when one considers all\r\nhe has gone through, and is still to suffer! No one can tell a day\r\n[ahead] what may happen in France, and if all the family have, which\r\nis but[7] in France, may not be confiscated. The thirst for spoliation\r\nis great; the people who lead have no other view, they are not\r\nfanatics, their aim is to rise and to enrich themselves; the remainder\r\nis mere humbug, exactly as you have it very near home. Never was\r\nthere a nation in a worse and a more helpless state, and the numerous\r\nparties who will _not_ unite render all solutions impossible, and the\r\nrepublic will be maintained for that very reason. It is but a name\r\nand no substance, but that _name of_ _republic_ encourages every\r\nextravagant or desperate proceeding, and turns people's heads in the\r\nold monarchies; every doctor or magistrate sees himself president of\r\nsome republic, and the ambitions of so many people who see all the\r\nimpediments which existed formerly removed, and who, according to\r\ntheir _own opinion_, are wonderful people, will be insatiable and much\r\nmore dangerous than you imagine in England. On the Continent every man\r\nthinks himself fit to be at the head of the Government; there is no\r\npolitical measure or scale, and the success of some bookseller or\r\ndoctor or advocate, etc., turns the heads of all those in similar\r\npositions--_on ne doute de rien_. When you consider that a\r\n_banqueroutier_ like Ledru Rollin[8] ruled over France _for six\r\nmonths_ almost with _absolute power,_ merely because he took it, you\r\nmay imagine how many thousands, even of workmen, cooks, stage people,\r\netc., look to be taken to rule over their fellow-citizens; _toujours\r\nconvaincu de leur propre merite_. I am happy to see that you escaped\r\na ministerial crisis; the peril was great, and it would have been\r\ndreadful for you at such a moment.\r\n\r\nAlbert made a fine long speech, I see.[9] Did he read it? _ex\r\ntempore_, it would have been very trying. I trust we may come to that\r\nunity of mankind of which he speaks, and of universal peace which our\r\nfriend Richard Cobden considers as very near at hand; if, however,\r\nthe red benefactors of mankind at Paris get the upper hand, _universal\r\nwar_ will be the order of the day. We are so strongly convinced of\r\nthis that we are very seriously occupied with the means of defence\r\nwhich this country can afford, and we imagine that if we are not\r\nabandoned by our friends, it will be impossible to force our positions\r\non the Schelde.\r\n\r\nI must now quickly conclude.

But she must once more ask Lord John to watch that\r\nthe Queen may be quite openly and considerately dealt by. She knows\r\nthat Lord Howden has long been made acquainted with his appointment,\r\nand has been corresponding upon it with General Narvaez; the\r\ncorrespondent of the _Times_ has announced his appointment from Madrid\r\nalready three weeks ago, and all that time Lord Palmerston remained\r\nsilent upon the matter to the Queen, not even answering her upon her\r\nletter expressing her wish to see Lord Westmorland[13] appointed. Lord\r\nJohn must see the impropriety of this course, and if it were not for\r\nthe Queen's anxiety to smooth all difficulties, the Government might\r\nbe exposed to most awkward embarrassments. She expects, however,\r\nand has the right to claim, equal consideration on the part of her\r\nMinisters.

When the Governor-General had the honour of addressing your\r\nMajesty from Bombay, the arrangements for the transmission of the\r\nKoh-i-noor were incomplete. He therefore did not then report to your\r\nMajesty, as he now humbly begs leave to do, that he conveyed the\r\njewel himself from Lahore in his own charge, and deposited it in the\r\nTreasury at Bombay. One of your Majesty's ships had been ordered to\r\nBombay to receive it, but had not then arrived, and did not arrive\r\ntill two months afterwards, thus causing delay. The _Medea_, however,\r\nsailed on 6th April, and will, it is hoped, have a safe and speedy\r\npassage to England.\r\n\r\nBy this mail the Governor-General transmits officially a record of all\r\nthat he has been able to trace of the vicissitudes through which the\r\nKoh-i-noor has passed. The papers are accurate and curious.\r\n\r\nIn one of them it is narrated, on the authority of Fugueer-ood-deen,\r\nwho is now at Lahore, and who was himself the messenger, that Runjeet\r\nSingh sent a message to Wufa Begum, the wife of Shah Sooja, from whom\r\nhe had taken the gem, to ask her its value. She replied, \"If a strong\r\nman were to throw four stones, one north, one south, one east, one\r\nwest, and a fifth stone up into the air, and if the space between\r\nthem were to be filled with gold, all would not equal the value of the\r\nKoh-i-noor.\" The Fugueer, thinking probably that this appraisement was\r\nsomewhat imaginative, subsequently asked Shah Sooja the same question.\r\nThe Shah replied that its value was \"good fortune; for whoever\r\npossessed it had conquered their enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General very respectfully and earnestly trusts that your\r\nMajesty, in your possession of the Koh-i-noor, may ever continue to\r\nrealise its value as estimated by Shah Sooja.\r\n\r\nHe has the honour to subscribe himself, with deep respect, your\r\nMajesty's most obedient, most humble, and most faithful Subject and\r\nServant,\r\n\r\nDALHOUSIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON'S FOREIGN POLICY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prince Albert to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _18th May 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD JOHN,--I return you the enclosed letters which forbode\r\na new storm, this time coming from Russia.[14] I confess I do not\r\nunderstand that part of the quarrel, but one conviction grows stronger\r\nand stronger with the Queen and myself (if it is possible), viz. that\r\nLord Palmerston is bringing the whole of the hatred which is borne to\r\nhim--I don't mean here to investigate whether justly or unjustly--by\r\nall the Governments of Europe upon England, and that the country\r\nruns serious danger of having to pay for the consequences.

He said it was quite impossible to abandon Lord Palmerston\r\nupon this question, that the Cabinet was as much to blame (if there\r\nwere cause for it) as Lord Palmerston, and particularly he himself,\r\nwho had given his consent to the measures taken, and was justly held\r\nresponsible by the country for the Foreign Policy of the Government.\r\nAdmitting, however, that Lord Palmerston's personal quarrels with all\r\nGovernments of foreign countries and the hostility with which they\r\nwere looking upon him was doing serious injury to the country, and\r\nexposing the Crown to blows aimed at the Minister, he had consulted\r\nLord Lansdowne.... Lord Lansdowne fully felt the strength of what I\r\nsaid respecting the power of the Leader of the House of Commons, and\r\nthe right on the part of the Queen to object to its being conferred\r\nupon a person who had not her entire confidence. I said I hoped Lord\r\nLansdowne would consider the communication of the letter as quite\r\nconfidential, as, although I had no objection to telling Lord\r\nPalmerston anything that was said in it myself, I should not like that\r\nit should come to his ears by third persons or be otherwise talked\r\nof. Lord John assured me that Lord Lansdowne could be entirely relied\r\nupon, and that he himself had locked up the letter under key the\r\nmoment he had received it, and would carefully guard it.\r\n\r\nThe result of our conference was, that we agreed that Lord Clarendon\r\nwas the only member of the Government to whom the Foreign Affairs\r\ncould be entrusted unless Lord John were to take them himself, which\r\nwas much the best. Lord John objected to Lord Clarendon's intimate\r\nconnection with the _Times_, and the violent Austrian line of that\r\npaper; moreover, Lord Clarendon would be wanted to organise the new\r\ndepartment of Secretary of State for Ireland. The Colonial Office\r\nwas much the best for Lord Palmerston, and should Lord John go to the\r\nHouse of Lords, Sir George Grey was to lead in the Commons.

This has always been my principle\r\nsince I entered the House of Lords, and I am fully convinced that\r\nGeorge will follow my example.\r\n\r\nI must also add that I have felt the great advantage of supporting the\r\nGovernment, and I have by that always been well with all Parties, and\r\nhave avoided many difficulties which other members of my family have\r\nhad to encounter.\r\n\r\nI shall not fail to communicate your letter to George, who will, I\r\ntrust, never prove himself unworthy of the kindness you have shown\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWith the request that you will remember me most kindly to Albert, I\r\nremain, my dearest Victoria, your most affectionate Uncle,\r\n\r\nADOLPHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prince George of Cambridge to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S PALACE, _15th June 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUSIN,--I have not as yet ventured to address you on a\r\nsubject of much interest personally to myself, and upon which I am\r\naware that you have been in correspondence with my father; but as I\r\nbelieve that the question which was brought to your notice has\r\nbeen settled, I cannot any longer deprive myself of the pleasure of\r\nexpressing to you my most sincere and grateful thanks for the kind\r\nmanner in which you have at once acceded to the anxious request of my\r\nfather and myself, by arranging with the Government that I should be\r\ncalled up to the House of Lords. This has been a point upon which I\r\nhave long been most anxious, and I am truly and sincerely grateful\r\nthat you have so considerately entered into my feelings and wishes. I\r\nunderstand that it is your intention that I should be called up by my\r\nfather's second title as Earl of Tipperary; at the same time I hope\r\nthat though I take a seat in the House as Earl of Tipperary, I may be\r\npermitted to retain and be called by my present name on all occasions\r\nnot connected with the House of Lords. As regards the wish expressed\r\nby yourself, that I should not allow myself to be made a political\r\npartisan, I need not, I trust, assure you that it will be ever my\r\nendeavour to obey your desires upon this as on all other occasions;\r\nbut I trust I may be permitted to add, that even before this desire\r\nexpressed by you, it had been my intention to follow this line of\r\nconduct. I conceive that whenever they conscientiously can do so, the\r\nmembers of the Royal Family should support the Queen's Government; and\r\nif at times it should happen that they have a difficulty in so doing,\r\nit is at all events not desirable that they should place themselves\r\nprominently in opposition to it. This I believe to be your feelings\r\non the subject, and if you will permit me to say so, they are also my\r\nown.\r\n\r\nHoping to have the pleasure soon of expressing to you my gratitude in\r\nperson, I remain, my dear Cousin, your most dutiful Cousin,\r\n\r\nGEORGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Prince George of Cambridge._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _17th June 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--Many thanks for your kind letter received yesterday.\r\nI am glad to hear that you are so entirely of my opinion with respect\r\nto the political conduct of the Princes of the Royal Family who are\r\npeers, and I feel sure that your conduct will be quite in accordance\r\nwith this view. With respect to your wish to be called as you have\r\nhitherto been, I do not think that this will be possible. It has never\r\nbeen done, besides which I think the Irish (who will be much flattered\r\nat your being called up by the title of Tipperary) would feel it as a\r\nslight if you did not wish to be called by the title you bear. All\r\nthe Royal Peers have always been called by their titles in this and in\r\nother countries, and I do not think it would be possible to avoid it.\r\nEver, etc.,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.[17]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The patent was made out, but not signed, a\r\n    memorandum of Prince Albert recording:--\r\n\r\n    BUCKINGHAM PALACE. _8th July 1850._\r\n\r\n    I kept this warrant back from the Queen's signature on account\r\n    of the Duke of Cambridge's illness.

The jealousy of the House of Commons\r\nwould not long bear such a policy.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, Lord Stanley has opened a beginning of strife,\r\nwhich may last for many years to come.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Lord Stanley's Motion of Censure was carried by\r\n    a majority of 37 in a House of 301.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD STANLEY'S MOTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _21st June 1850._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter and read his speech\r\nin the House of Commons. She regrets exceedingly the position in which\r\nthe Government has been placed by the Motion of Lord Stanley in the\r\nHouse of Lords. Whichever way the Debate in the House of Commons\r\nmay terminate, the Queen foresees great troubles. A defeat of the\r\nGovernment would be _most inconvenient_. The Queen has always\r\napproved the _general_ tendency of the policy of the Government to\r\nlet despotism and democracy fight out their battles abroad, but must\r\nremind Lord John that in the execution of this policy Lord Palmerston\r\nhas _gone a long way_ in taking up the side of democracy in the fight,\r\nand this is the \"detail of negotiations\" which Lord John is afraid may\r\nbe confounded with the general principle of our Foreign Policy. Indeed\r\nit is already confounded by the whole of the foreign and the great\r\nmajority of the British public, and it is to be feared that the\r\ndiscussion will place despotic and democratic principles in array\r\nagainst each other in this country, whilst the original question turns\r\nonly upon the justice of Don Pacifico's claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _22nd June 1850._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell deeply regrets that your Majesty should be exposed\r\nto inconvenience in consequence of Lord Stanley's Motion. He has\r\ncopied Mr Roebuck's Motion as it now stands on the votes. The word\r\n\"principles\" includes the general policy, and excludes the particular\r\nmeasures which from time to time have been adopted as the objects of\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say at this moment what will be the result. Lord\r\nStanley, Lord Aberdeen, Mr Gladstone, and Mr Disraeli appear to be in\r\nclose concert.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley can hardly now abandon Protection. Mr Gladstone, one\r\nshould imagine, can hardly abandon Free Trade. The anger of the honest\r\nProtectionists and the honest Free-Traders will be very great at so\r\nunprincipled a coalition.\r\n\r\nMr Roebuck's Motion: That the principles on which the Foreign Policy\r\nof Her Majesty's Government has been regulated have been such as were\r\ncalculated to maintain the honour and dignity of this country, and in\r\ntimes of unexampled difficulty to preserve peace between England and\r\nthe various nations of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HOLSTEIN AND GERMANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _22nd June 1850._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Palmerston's letter of yesterday, but\r\ncannot say that his arguments in support of his former opinion, that\r\nthe Germanic Confederation should be omitted from amongst the Powers\r\nwho are to be invited to sign a protocol, the object of which is to\r\ndecide upon the fate of Holstein, have proved successful in convincing\r\nher of the propriety of this course. As Holstein belongs to the\r\nGermanic Confederation and is only accidentally connected with Denmark\r\nthrough its Sovereign, a Protocol to ensure the integrity of the\r\nDanish Monarchy is a direct attack upon Germany, if carried out\r\nwithout her knowledge and consent; and it is an act repugnant to all\r\nfeelings of justice and morality for third parties to dispose of other\r\npeople's property, which no diplomatic etiquette about the difficulty\r\nof finding a proper representative for Germany could justify. The mode\r\nof representation might safely be left to the Confederation itself.\r\nIt is not surprising to the Queen that Austria and Prussia should\r\ncomplain of Lord Palmerston's agreeing with Sweden, Russia, Denmark,\r\nand France upon the Protocol before giving Prussia and Austria any\r\nnotice of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PROTOCOL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nCARLTON GARDENS, _23rd June 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN RUSSELL,--The Queen has entirely misconceived the object\r\nand effect of the proposed Protocol. It does not \"decide upon the\r\nfate of Holstein,\" nor is it \"an attack upon Germany.\" In fact, the\r\nProtocol is to _decide_ nothing; it is to be merely a record of the\r\nwishes and opinions of the Power whose representatives are to sign\r\nit....[19]\r\n\r\nHow does any part of this decide the fate of Holstein or attack\r\nGermany?\r\n\r\nIs not the Queen requiring that I should be Minister, not indeed for\r\nAustria, Russia, or France, but for the Germanic Confederation?\r\nWhy should we take up the cudgels for Germany, when we are inviting\r\nAustria and Prussia, the two leading powers of Germany, and who would\r\nof course put in a claim for the Confederation if they thought it\r\nnecessary, which, however, for the reasons above stated, they surely\r\nwould not?...\r\n\r\nAs to my having _agreed_ with Sweden, Russia, Denmark, and France\r\nbefore communicating with Prussia and Austria, that is not the course\r\nwhich things have taken. Brunnow proposed the Protocol to me, and\r\nI have been in discussion with him about it. It is _he_ who has\r\ncommunicated it to the French Ambassador, to Reventlow, and to\r\nRehausen; I sent it privately several weeks ago to Westmorland, that\r\nhe might show it confidentially to Schleinitz, but telling Westmorland\r\nthat it was not a thing settled, but only a proposal by Russia, and\r\nthat, at all events, some part of the wording would be altered. I have\r\nno doubt that Brunnow has also shown it to Koller; but I could not\r\nsend it officially to Berlin or Vienna till Brunnow had agreed to such\r\na wording as I could recommend the Government to adopt, nor until I\r\nreceived the Queen's sanction to do so.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that occurs to me as practicable would be to say to\r\nAustria and Prussia that if, in signing the Protocol, they could add\r\nthat they signed also in the name of the Confederation, we should be\r\nglad to have the additional weight of that authority, but that could\r\nnot be made a _sine qua non_, any more than the signature of Austria\r\nand Prussia themselves, for I think that the Protocol ought to be\r\nsigned by as many of the proposed Powers as may choose to agree to\r\nit, bearing always in mind that it is only a record of opinions and\r\nwishes, and does not decide or pretend to decide anything practically.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: The Protocol was to record the desirability\r\n    of the following points:--(1) that the several states which\r\n    constituted the Danish Monarchy should remain united, and\r\n    that the Danish Crown should be settled in such manner that it\r\n    should go with the Duchy of Holstein; (2) that the signatory\r\n    Powers, when the peace should have been concluded, should\r\n    concert measures for the purpose of giving to the results\r\n    an additional pledge of stability, by a general European\r\n    acknowledgment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S OPINION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th June 1850._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter enclosing those of\r\nLord Palmerston and Lord Lansdowne. The _misconception_ on the Queen's\r\npart, which Lord Palmerston alleges to exist, consists in her taking\r\nthe essence of the arrangement for the mere words. Lord Palmerston\r\npretends that the Protocol \"does not decide upon the fate of Holstein\r\nnor attack Germany.\" However, the only object of the Protocol is the\r\nfate of Holstein, which is decided upon--\r\n\r\n(1.) By a declaration of the importance to the interests of Europe to\r\nuphold the integrity of the Danish Monarchy (which has no meaning, if\r\nit does not mean that Holstein is to remain with it).\r\n\r\n(2.) By an approval of the efforts of the King of Denmark to keep it\r\nwith Denmark, by adapting the law of succession to that of Holstein.\r\n\r\n(3.) By an engagement on the part of the Powers to use their \"_soins_\"\r\nto get the constitutional position of Holstein settled in a peace\r\naccording to the Malmoe preliminaries, of which it was one of\r\nthe conditions that the question of the succession was to be left\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\n(4.) To seal the whole arrangement by an act of European\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nIf the declarations of importance, the approval, the \"_soins_\" and\r\nthe acknowledgments of _all_ the great Powers of Europe are to decide\r\nnothing, then Lord Palmerston is quite right; if they decide anything,\r\nit is the fate of Holstein.\r\n\r\nWhether this will be an attack upon Germany or not will be easily\r\ndeduced from the fact that the attempt on the part of Denmark to\r\nincorporate into her polity the Duchy of Schleswig was declared by\r\nthe Diet in 1846 to be a declaration of war against Germany merely on\r\naccount of its intimate connection with the Duchy of Holstein.\r\n\r\nThe Queen does not wish her Minister to be Minister for Germany, but\r\nmerely to treat that country with the same consideration which is due\r\nto every country on whose interests we mean to decide.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would wish her correspondence upon this subject to be\r\nbrought before the Cabinet, and will abide by their deliberate\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th June 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Charles will have told you how kindly and amiably\r\nthe Prince of Prussia has come here, travelling night and day from\r\nSt Petersburg, in order to be in time for the christening of our\r\nlittle _Arthur_.[20] I wish you could (and you will, for he intends\r\nstopping at Brussels) hear him speak, for he is so straightforward,\r\nconciliatory, and yet firm of purpose; I have a great esteem and\r\nrespect for him. The poor King of Prussia is recovered,[21] and has\r\nbeen received with great enthusiasm on the first occasion of his first\r\nreappearance in public.\r\n\r\nWe are in a _crisis_, no one knowing how this debate upon this most\r\nunfortunate Greek business will end. It is most unfortunate, for\r\nwhatever way it ends, it must do great harm.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude, for I am quite overpowered by the heat.

The good report of my beloved Louise's\r\nimprovement is a great happiness. By my letter to Louise you will have\r\nlearnt all the details of this certainly very disgraceful and very\r\ninconceivable attack.[24] I have not suffered except from my head,\r\nwhich is still very tender, the blow having been extremely violent,\r\nand the brass _end_ of the stick fell on my head so as to make a\r\nconsiderable noise. I own it makes me nervous out driving, and I start\r\nat any person coming near the carriage, which I am afraid is natural.\r\nWe have, alas! now another cause of much greater anxiety in the person\r\nof our excellent Sir Robert Peel,[25] who, as you will see, has had\r\na most serious fall, and though going on well at first, was very ill\r\nlast night; thank God! he is better again this morning, but I fear\r\nstill in great danger. I cannot bear even to think of losing him; it\r\nwould be the greatest loss for the whole country, and irreparable for\r\nus, for he is so trustworthy, and so entirely to be depended on. _All_\r\nparties are in great anxiety about him. I will leave my letter open to\r\ngive you the latest news.\r\n\r\nOur good and amiable guest[26] likes being with us, and will remain\r\nwith us till Saturday. We had a concert last night, and go to the\r\nopera very regularly. The _Prophete_ is quite beautiful, and I am\r\nsure would delight you. The music in the _Scene du Couronnement_ is,\r\nI think, finer than anything in either _Robert_ or the _Huguenots_; it\r\nis highly dramatic, and really very touching. Mario sings and acts\r\nin it quite in perfection. His _Raoul_ in the Huguenots is also most\r\nbeautiful. He improves every year, and I really think his voice is the\r\nfinest tenor I ever heard, and he sings and acts with such _intense_\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nWhat do you say to the conclusion of our debate? It leaves things just\r\nas they were. The House of Commons is becoming very unmanageable and\r\ntroublesome....\r\n\r\nI must now conclude. With Albert's love, ever your most affectionate\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nI am happy to say that Sir Robert, though still very ill, is freer\r\nfrom pain, his pulse is less high, and he feels himself better; the\r\nDoctors think there is _no_ vital injury, and nothing from which he\r\ncannot recover, but that he must be for some days in a precarious\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: The Queen, as she was leaving Cambridge House,\r\n    where she had called to inquire after the Duke of Cambridge's\r\n    health, was struck with a cane by one Robert Pate, an\r\n    ex-officer, and a severe bruise was inflicted on her forehead.\r\n    The outrage was apparently committed without motive, but an\r\n    attempt to prove Pate insane failed, and he was sentenced to\r\n    seven years' transportation.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: On the day following the Don Pacifico debate,\r\n    Sir Robert Peel, after attending a meeting of the Exhibition\r\n    Commissioners, had gone out riding.

The end was most peaceful; there was no\r\ndisease; only a gastric fever, which came on four weeks ago, from\r\nover-exertion, and cold, and which he neglected for the first week,\r\ncarried him off.\r\n\r\nThe good Prince of Prussia you will have been pleased to talk to and\r\nsee.

Lord\r\nJohn may be sure that she fully admits the great difficulties in the\r\nway of the projected alteration, but she, on the other hand, feels\r\nthe duty she owes to the country and to herself, not to allow a man\r\nin whom she can have no confidence, who has conducted himself in\r\n_anything but_ a straightforward and proper manner to herself, to\r\nremain in the Foreign Office, and thereby to expose herself to insults\r\nfrom other nations, and the country to the constant risk of serious\r\nand alarming complications. The Queen considers these reasons as\r\nmuch graver than the other difficulties. Each time that we were in\r\na difficulty, the Government seemed to be determined to move Lord\r\nPalmerston, and as soon as these difficulties were got over, those\r\nwhich present themselves in the carrying out of this removal appeared\r\nof so great a magnitude as to cause its relinquishment. There is no\r\nchance of Lord Palmerston reforming himself in his sixty-seventh year,\r\nand after having considered his last escape as a triumph.... The\r\nQueen is personally convinced that Lord Palmerston at this moment is\r\nsecretly planning an armed Russian intervention in Schleswig, which\r\nmay produce a renewal of revolutions in Germany, and possibly a\r\ngeneral war.\r\n\r\nThe Queen only adduces this as an instance that there is no question\r\nof delicacy and danger in which Lord Palmerston will not arbitrarily\r\nand without reference to his colleagues or Sovereign engage this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of Denmark._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _29 Juillet 1850._\r\n\r\nSIRE ET MON BON FRERE,--La lettre dont votre Majeste a bien voulu\r\nm'honorer m'a cause un bien vif plaisir comme temoignage que votre\r\nMajeste a su apprecier les sentiments d'amitie pour vous et le desir\r\nd'agir avec impartialite qui m'ont animee ainsi que mon Gouvernement\r\npendant tout le cours des longues negociations qui out precede la\r\nsignature de la Paix avec l'Allemagne.

There is nothing in the management of\r\nthese parks by the Woods and Forests which does not equally apply to\r\nall the others, as Greenwich, Hampton Court, Richmond, etc. There is\r\ncertainly a degree of inconvenience in the divided authority, but this\r\nis amply compensated by the advantage to the Crown, in appearance\r\nat least, to keep up an authority emanating personally from the\r\nSovereign, and unconnected with a Government Department which is\r\ndirectly answerable to the House of Commons. The last debate upon Hyde\r\nPark has, moreover, shown that it will not be safe not to remind the\r\npublic of the fact that the parks are Royal property.

He regrets to be under the necessity of submitting to your\r\nMajesty the enclosed letter from General Sir Charles Napier,\r\nG.C.B., in which he tenders his resignation of the office of\r\nCommander-in-Chief of your Majesty's Forces in the East Indies.[32]\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of this paper Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington\r\nconsidered it to be his duty to peruse all the papers submitted by\r\nSir Charles Napier; to survey the transaction which had occasioned\r\nthe censure of the Governor-General in Council complained of by Sir\r\nCharles Napier; to require from the India House all the information\r\nwhich could throw light upon the conduct complained of, as well as\r\nupon the motives alleged for it; the reasons given on account of which\r\nit was stated to be necessary.\r\n\r\nHe has stated in a minute, a memorandum of which he submits the copy\r\nto your Majesty, his views and opinions upon the whole subject, and\r\nthe result which he submits to your Majesty is that he considers it\r\nhis duty humbly to submit to your Majesty that your Majesty should be\r\ngraciously pleased to accept the resignation of General Sir Charles\r\nNapier thus tendered.\r\n\r\nBefore he should submit this recommendation to your Majesty in\r\nrelation to an office of such high reputation in so high and important\r\na station, Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington considered it his duty\r\nto submit his views to your Majesty's servants, who have expressed\r\ntheir concurrence in his opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the President of the Board of Control will lay\r\nbefore your Majesty the papers transmitted to the Secret Committee of\r\nthe Court of Directors, by the Governor-General in Council, which\r\nare adverted to in the paper drawn up by the Duke, and of which the\r\nsubstance alone is stated.\r\n\r\nAll of which is humbly submitted to your Majesty by your Majesty's\r\nmost dutiful Subject and most devoted Servant,\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: This was in consequence of Sir Charles Napier's\r\n    action in exercising powers belonging to the Supreme Council,\r\n    on the occasion of a mutiny of a regiment of the Native Army.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON'S CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A POSSIBLE RE-ARRANGEMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _5th August 1850._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell having lately stated that Lord Clarendon, who\r\nhad always been most eager to see Lord Palmerston moved, had lately\r\nexpressed to him his opinion that it would be most dangerous and\r\nimpolitic to do so under present circumstances, we thought it right\r\nto see Lord Clarendon here.... In conversation with me, Lord Clarendon\r\nspoke in his old strain of Lord Palmerston, but very strongly also\r\nof the danger of turning him out and making him the leader of the\r\nRadicals, who were anxiously waiting for that, were much dissatisfied\r\nwith Lord John Russell, and free from control by the death of Sir\r\nRobert Peel. I said that if everything was done with Lord Palmerston's\r\nconsent there would be no danger, to which Lord Clarendon assented,\r\nbut doubted that he would consent to giving up what was his hobby. He\r\nadded, nobody but Lord John could carry on the Foreign Affairs, but he\r\nought not to leave the House of Commons under present circumstances,\r\nwhere he was now the only authority left.\r\n\r\nWe saw the Duke of Bedford yesterday, whom Lord John had wished us\r\nto invite. He is very unhappy about the present state of affairs,\r\nfrightened about things going on as at present, when Lord John can\r\nexercise no control over Lord Palmerston, and the Queen is exposed\r\nyear after year to the same annoyances and dangers arising from Lord\r\nPalmerston's mode of conducting the affairs; but on the other hand,\r\nequally frightened at turning him loose. The Duke was aware of all\r\nthat had passed between us and Lord John, and ready to do anything\r\n_he_ could to bring matters to a satisfactory solution, but thought\r\nhis brother would not like to leave the House of Commons now. He had\r\nvery much changed his opinion on that head latterly, and the more so\r\nas he thought something ought to be done next year with the franchise,\r\nwhich he alone could carry through. On my questioning whether it was\r\nimpossible to persuade him to take the Foreign Office and stay in the\r\nLower House, with a first-rate under-secretary, at least for a time,\r\nthe Duke thought he might perhaps temporarily, as he felt he owed\r\nto the Queen the solution of the difficulty, but expressed again his\r\nfears of Lord Palmerston's opposition. I replied that if Lord John\r\nwould make up his mind to take the Foreign Office, and to stay in\r\nthe House of Commons, I saw no danger, as Lord John would be able to\r\nmaintain himself successfully, and Lord Palmerston would not like to\r\nbe in opposition to him, whilst he would become most formidable to\r\nanybody who was to _gain_ only the leadership in the House; moreover,\r\nLord John, having done so much for Lord Palmerston, could expect and\r\ndemand a return of sacrifice, and a variety of posts might be offered\r\nto him--the Presidency of the Council, the office of Home Secretary,\r\nor Secretary for the Colonies, Chancellor of the Exchequer, etc.,\r\netc., which places I was sure any member of the Cabinet would vacate\r\nfor him. The Duke of Bedford added the Lieutenancy of Ireland, as Lord\r\nClarendon had told him he was ready to give it up for the purpose, but\r\nonly under _one_ condition, viz. that of not having to succeed to\r\nLord Palmerston at the Foreign Office. Observing our surprise at\r\nthis declaration, the Duke added that Lord Clarendon acted most\r\nconsiderately, that he was ready to have no office at all, and would\r\nsupport the Government independently in the House of Lords if this\r\nwere to facilitate arrangements. The Queen rejoined that a peerage was\r\nof course also at Lord John's disposal for Lord Palmerston. We then\r\nagreed that Lord Granville would be the best person to become Lord\r\nJohn's Under-Secretary of State, a man highly popular, pleasing,\r\nconciliatory, well versed in Foreign Affairs, and most industrious;\r\ntrained under Lord John, he could at any time leave him the office\r\naltogether, if Lord John should find it too much for himself. Lord\r\nGranville had a higher office now, that of Vice-President of the\r\nBoard of Trade and Paymaster-General, but would be sure to feel the\r\nimportance of taking a lower office under such circumstances and with\r\nsuch contingencies likely to depend upon it. I have seen a great deal\r\nof him latterly, as he is the only working man on the Commission for\r\nthe Exhibition of 1851, and have found him most able, good-natured,\r\nand laborious. The Duke liked the proposal very much, and is going to\r\ncommunicate all that passed between us to Lord John on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON'S POSITION]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON'S JUSTIFICATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _8th August 1850._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell came down here yesterday in order to report to the\r\nQueen what had passed between him and Lord Palmerston the day before,\r\non whom he had called in order to have an explanation on the Foreign\r\nAffairs.\r\n\r\nLord John reminded him of former communications, but admitted that\r\ncircumstances were much changed by the recent debates in both Houses\r\nof Parliament; still, it was necessary to come to an understanding of\r\nthe position. The _policy_ pursued with regard to the Foreign Affairs\r\nhad been right and such as had the approval of Lord John himself, the\r\nCabinet generally, and he believed the greater part of the country.\r\nBut the manner in which it had been executed had been unfortunate,\r\nled to irritation and hostility; although peace had actually been\r\npreserved, and England stood in a position requiring no territorial\r\naggrandisement or advantage of any kind, yet all Governments and\r\nPowers, not only Russia and Austria, but also France and the liberal\r\nstates, had become decidedly hostile to us, and our intercourse was\r\nnot such as was desirable. Lord John could instance many cases in\r\nwhich they had been unnecessarily slighted and provoked by Lord\r\nPalmerston, like M. Drouyn de Lhuys in the Greek affair. Lord\r\nPalmerston's conduct towards the Queen had been disrespectful and\r\nwanting in due attention and deference to her, and had been much\r\ncomplained of.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all this Lord John had before proposed to Her\r\nMajesty that the Foreign Affairs should be entrusted to Lord Minto,\r\nhe himself should go to the House of Lords, and Lord Palmerston\r\nshould have the lead in the House of Commons. The Queen had, however,\r\nobjected to this arrangement, [thinking] the lead in the Lower\r\nHouse to be more properly given to Sir George Grey, who had as Home\r\nSecretary conducted all internal business in the House. Now had come\r\nSir R. Peel's death, which made it impossible for Lord John to leave\r\nthe House of Commons without endangering the position of Government\r\nand of the parties in the House.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston was much pleased to hear of Lord John's intention to\r\nstay in the House of Commons, said all was changed now; there had been\r\na great conspiracy against him, he had been accused in Parliament, put\r\non his trial and acquitted. The acquittal had produced the greatest\r\nenthusiasm for him in the country, and he was now supported by a\r\nstrong party; he owned, however, that his success had been chiefly\r\nowing to the handsome manner in which Lord John and his colleagues had\r\nsupported him in the debate. That he should incur the momentary enmity\r\nof those states whose interests and plans he might have to cross was\r\nquite natural; he had never intended any disrespect to the Queen, and\r\nif he had been guilty of any he was quite unconscious of it and sorry\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nLord John reminded him that although the Government had got a majority\r\nin the House of Commons in the Foreign debate, it was not to be\r\nforgotten that the fate of the Government had been staked upon it, and\r\nthat many people voted on that account who would not have supported\r\nthe Foreign policy; that it was remarkable that all those who had the\r\nstrongest reason to be anxious for the continuance of the Government,\r\nbut who could not avoid _speaking_, were obliged to speak and vote\r\nagainst the Government. Sir R. Peel's speech was a most remarkable\r\ninstance of this.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston saw in Sir Robert's speech nothing but a reluctant\r\neffort to defend Lord Aberdeen, whom he was bound to defend. If he\r\n(Lord Palmerston) were to leave the Foreign Office, there must be a\r\nground for it, such as his having to take the lead in the House of\r\nCommons, which was evidently impossible with the conduct of Foreign\r\nDepartment at the same time. (It had killed Mr Canning, and after\r\nthat failure nobody ought to attempt it.) But without such a ground it\r\nwould be loss of character to him, which he could not be expected\r\nto submit to. There was not even the excuse of wishing to avoid a\r\ndifficulty with a foreign country, as all was smooth now. Those who\r\nhad wished to injure him had been beat, and now it would be\r\ngiving them a triumph after all. If the Queen or the Cabinet were\r\ndissatisfied with his management of the Foreign Affairs, they had a\r\nright to demand his resignation, and he would give it, but they could\r\nnot ask him to lower himself in public estimation. Lord John answered\r\nthat his resignation would lead to a further split of parties: there\r\nwere parties already enough in the House, and it was essential that at\r\nleast the Whig party should be kept together, to which Lord Palmerston\r\nassented. He (Lord Palmerston) then repeated his complaints against\r\nthat plot which had been got up in this country against him, and\r\nurged on by foreigners, complained particularly of Lord Clarendon, Mr\r\nGreville of the Privy Council, Mr Reeve, ditto, and their attacks upon\r\nhim in the _Times_, and of Mr Delane, the Editor of the _Times_,\r\nof Guizot, Princess Lieven, etc., etc., etc. However, they had been\r\nconvinced that they could not upset him, and Mr Reeve had declared to\r\nhim that he had been making open and honourable (?!!) war upon him;\r\nnow he would make a lasting peace. With Russia and France he (Lord\r\nPalmerston) had just been signing the Danish Protocol, showing that\r\nthey were on the best terms together.\r\n\r\nLord John felt he could not press the matter further under these\r\ncircumstances, but he seemed much provoked at the result of his\r\nconversation. We expressed our surprise that he had not made Lord\r\nPalmerston any offer of any kind. Lord John replied he had not been\r\nsure what he could have offered him....\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DUTIES OF THE FOREIGN SECRETARY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._[33]\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _12th August 1850._\r\n\r\nWith reference to the conversation about Lord Palmerston which the\r\nQueen had with Lord John Russell the other day, and Lord Palmerston's\r\ndisavowal that he ever intended any disrespect to her by the various\r\nneglects of which she has had so long and so often to complain, she\r\nthinks it right, in order _to prevent any mistake_ for the _future_,\r\nshortly to explain _what it is she expects from her Foreign\r\nSecretary_.

Napoleon Bonaparte, the greatest enemy that England\r\never had, was treated while at Plymouth with respect, and with\r\ncommiseration while at St Helena. Marshal Soult, who had fought\r\nin many battles against the English, was received with generous\r\nacclamation when he came here as Special Ambassador. The King of the\r\nFrench, Mons. Guizot, and Prince Metternich, though all of them great\r\nantagonists of English policy and English interests, were treated in\r\nthis country with courtesy and kindness. But General Haynau was looked\r\nupon as a great moral criminal; and the feeling in regard to him was\r\nof the same nature as that which was manifested towards Tawell[39] and\r\nthe Mannings,[40] with this only difference, that General Haynau's bad\r\ndeeds were committed upon a far larger scale, and upon a far larger\r\nnumber of victims. But Viscount Palmerston can assure your Majesty\r\nthat those feelings of just and honourable indignation have not been\r\nconfined to England, for he had good reason to know that General\r\nHaynau's ferocious and unmanly treatment of the unfortunate\r\ninhabitants of Brescia and of other towns and places in Italy, his\r\nsavage proclamations to the people of Pesth, and his barbarous acts in\r\nHungary excited almost as much disgust in Austria as in England, and\r\nthat the nickname of \"General Hyaena\" was given to him at Vienna long\r\nbefore it was applied to him in London.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: The Austrian Ambassador.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: General Haynau had earned in the Hungarian War\r\n    an odious reputation as a flogger of women. When visiting the\r\n    brewery of Barclay & Perkins, the draymen mobbed and\r\n    assaulted him; he had to fly from them, and take refuge in a\r\n    neighbouring house. Lord Palmerston had to send an official\r\n    letter of apology to the Austrian Government, which, as\r\n    originally despatched, without waiting for the Queen's\r\n    approval, contained a paragraph offensive to Austria.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: See Lord Palmerston's letter to Sir G.

Lord John will see that Lord Palmerston has not\r\nonly _sent_ the draft, but passes over in silence her injunction to\r\nhave a corrected copy given to Baron Koller, and adds a vituperation\r\nagainst General Haynau, which clearly shows that he is not sorry for\r\nwhat has happened, and makes a merit of sympathising with the draymen\r\nat the brewery and the Chartist Demonstrations....\r\n\r\nThe Queen encloses likewise a copy of her letter to Lord Palmerston,\r\nand hopes Lord John will write to him.[41]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: Lord John insisted on the note being withdrawn,\r\n    and another substituted with the offensive passage omitted.\r\n    After threatening resignation, Lord Palmerston somewhat tamely\r\n    consented.\r\n\r\n    Lord John Russell wrote to the Prince Albert that he would be\r\n    \"somewhat amused, if not surprised, at the sudden and amicable\r\n    termination of the dispute regarding the letter to Baron\r\n    Koller.

She cannot suppose that Baron Koller addressed his\r\nnote to Lord Palmerston in order to receive in answer an expression of\r\nhis _own personal opinion_; and if Lord Palmerston could not reconcile\r\nit to his own feelings to express the regret of the Queen's Government\r\nat the brutal attack and wanton outrage committed by a ferocious mob\r\non a distinguished foreigner of past seventy years of age, who was\r\nquietly visiting a private establishment in this metropolis, without\r\nadding _his censure of the want of propriety_ evinced by General\r\nHaynau in coming to England--he might have done so in a private\r\nletter, where his personal feelings could not be mistaken for the\r\nopinion of the Queen and her Government. She must repeat her request\r\nthat Lord Palmerston will rectify this.\r\n\r\nThe Queen can as little approve of the introduction of Lynch Law\r\nin this country as of the _violent_ vituperations with which Lord\r\nPalmerston accuses and condemns public men in other countries, acting\r\nin most difficult circumstances and under heavy responsibility,\r\nwithout having the means of obtaining correct information or of\r\nsifting evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _16th October 1850._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is glad to hear from Lord Palmerston that he has given no\r\ncountenance to the French and Russian proposal at the suggestion of\r\nDenmark, that England, France, and Russia should, after having signed\r\nthe Protocol in favour of Denmark, now go further and send their\r\narmies to aid her in her contest with Holstein.[42] The Queen does not\r\nexpect any good result from Lord Palmerston's counter proposal to urge\r\nPrussia and Austria to compel the Holsteiners to lay down their arms.\r\nThe mediating power ought rather to make Denmark feel that it requires\r\nmore than a cessation of hostilities, a plan of reconciliation, and a\r\nsolution of the questions in dispute, before she can hope permanently\r\nto establish peace. The mediating power itself, however, should strive\r\nto arrive at some opinion on the matter in dispute, based, not on\r\n_its own_ supposed interests, as the Protocol is, but on an anxious,\r\ncareful, and impartial investigation of the rights and pretensions of\r\nthe disputing parties; and if it finds it impossible to arrive at such\r\nan opinion, to fix upon some impartial tribunal capable of doing\r\nso, to which the dispute could be submitted for decision. Common\r\nprinciples of morality would point out such a course, and what is\r\nmorally right only can be politically wise.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: A strenuous attempt was being made by the Danish\r\n    Government to bring pressure to bear on Austria and Prussia,\r\n    to put down the nationalist movement in the Duchies, either by\r\n    active intervention, or by reassembling the Conference\r\n    which had negotiated the Treaty of Berlin. Lord Palmerston\r\n    discountenanced both alternatives, but wrote to the Queen\r\n    that he and the representatives of France, Russia, and Denmark\r\n    thought that Austria and Prussia should be urged to take all\r\n    feasible steps to put an end to the hostilities.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF QUEEN LOUISE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _18th October 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--_This_ was the day I _always_ and for so _many\r\nyears_ wrote to _her_, to _our adored Louise_, and I _now_ write to\r\n_you_, to thank you for that _heart-breaking_, touching letter of the\r\n16th, which you so _very kindly_ wrote to me.

It strikes him that the division into\r\ntwelve territorial dioceses of eight ecclesiastical vicariats is not\r\na matter to be alarmed at. The persons to be affected by this change\r\nmust be already Roman Catholics before it can touch them.\r\n\r\nThe matter to create rational alarm is, as your Majesty says, the\r\ngrowth of Roman Catholic doctrines and practices within the bosom of\r\nthe Church. Dr Arnold said very truly, \"I look upon a Roman Catholic\r\nas an enemy in his uniform; I look upon a Tractarian as an enemy\r\ndisguised as a spy.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be very wrong to do as the Bishop of Oxford proposed, and\r\nconfer the patronage of the Crown on any of these Tractarians. But, on\r\nthe other hand, to treat them with severity would give the whole party\r\nvigour and union.\r\n\r\nThe Dean of Bristol is of opinion that the Tractarians are falling to\r\npieces by dissension. It appears clear that Mr Denison and Mr Palmer\r\nhave broken off from Dr Pusey.\r\n\r\nSir George Grey will ask the Law Officers whether there is anything\r\nillegal in Dr Wiseman's assuming the title of Archbishop of\r\nWestminster. An English Cardinal is not a novelty.[45]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Two important events in the history of the\r\n    English Church had just occurred. The Bishop of Exeter had\r\n    refused to institute Mr Gorham to a Crown living in his\r\n    diocese, on the ground that his teaching on baptism was at\r\n    variance with the formularies of the Church. This decision,\r\n    though upheld in the Court of Arches, was reversed (though\r\n    not unanimously) by the Privy Council. High Church feeling was\r\n    much aroused by the judgment.\r\n\r\n    In September, Pius IX. (now re-established in the Vatican)\r\n    promulgated a papal brief, restoring the Roman Catholic\r\n    hierarchy in England, and dividing it territorially into\r\n    twelve sees, and in October Cardinal Wiseman, as Archbishop\r\n    of Westminster, issued his Pastoral, claiming that Catholic\r\n    England had been restored to its orbit in the ecclesiastical\r\n    firmament.

I came here yesterday by a mild sunshine, and\r\nthe valley of the Meuse was very pretty. I love my solitude here, and\r\nthough the house is small and not what it ought to have been, still I\r\nalways liked it. There seems in most countries danger of agitation\r\nand convulsions arising. I don't know how it will end in Germany. In\r\nFrance it is difficult that things should not break up some way or\r\nother. I trust you may be spared religious agitation. These sorts of\r\nthings begin with one pretext, and sometimes continue with others. I\r\ndon't think Europe was ever in more danger, _il y a tant d'anarchie\r\ndans les esprits_. I don't think that can be cured _a l'eau de rose_;\r\nthe human race is not naturally good, very much the contrary; it\r\nrequires a strong hand, and is, in fact, even pleased to be led in\r\nthat way; the memory of all the sort of Cesars and Napoleons,\r\nfrom whom they chiefly got blows, is much dearer to them than the\r\nbenefactors of mankind, whom they crucify when they can have their\r\nown way.

The\r\nQueen is afraid, however, that all our Ministers abroad,--at Berlin,\r\nDresden, Munich, Stuttgart, Hanover, etc. (with the exception of Lord\r\nCowley at Frankfort)--are warm partisans of the _despotic_ league\r\nagainst Prussia and a German Constitution and _for_ the maintenance\r\nof the old Diet under Austrian and Russian influence. Ought not Lord\r\nPalmerston to make his agents understand that their sentiments are at\r\nvariance with those of the English Government? and that they are doing\r\n_serious mischief_ if they express them at Courts which have _already_\r\nevery inclination to follow their desperate course?\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston is of course aware that the old Diet once\r\nreconstituted and recognised, one of the main laws of it is that \"_no\r\norganic change can be made_ without _unanimity_ of voices,\" which was\r\nthe cause of the nullity of that body from 1820 to 1848, and will\r\nnow enable Austria, should Prussia and her confederates recognise\r\nthe Diet, to condemn Germany to a further life of stagnation or new\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: Minister at Berlin.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: Lord Palmerston may have had this letter of the\r\n    Queen's in mind when he wrote on the 22nd of November to Lord\r\n    Cowley: \"Her (_i.e._ Prussia's) partisans try to make out\r\n    that the contest between her and Austria is a struggle between\r\n    constitutional and arbitrary Government, but it is no such\r\n    thing.\" Ashley's _Life of Lord Palmerston_, vol. 1. chap. vi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CONSTITUTIONALISM IN GERMANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _18th November 1850._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty. With\r\nrespect to the maintenance of Constitutional Government in Germany,\r\nViscount Palmerston entirely subscribes to your Majesty's opinion,\r\nthat a regard for consistency, as well as a sense of right and\r\njustice, ought to lead your Majesty's Government to give to the\r\nConstitutional principle in Germany the same moral support which they\r\nendeavoured to afford it in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and elsewhere; but\r\nthough he is conscious that he may be deceived and may think better\r\nof the Austrian Government in this respect than it deserves, yet\r\nhe cannot persuade himself that rational and sound Constitutional\r\nGovernment is at present in danger in Germany, or that the Austrian\r\nGovernment, whatever may be their inclination and wishes, can think it\r\npossible in the present day to re-establish despotic government in\r\na nation so enlightened, and so attached to free institutions as the\r\nGerman people now is. The danger for Germany seems to lie rather in\r\nthe opposite direction, arising from the rash and weak precipitation\r\nwith which in 1848 and 1849 those Governments which before had refused\r\neverything resolved in a moment of alarm to grant everything, and,\r\npassing from one extreme to the other, threw universal suffrage among\r\npeople who had been, some wholly and others very much, unaccustomed\r\nto the working of representative Government. The French have found\r\nuniversal suffrage incompatible with good order even in a Republic;\r\nwhat must it be for a Monarchy?\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston would, moreover, beg to submit that the conflict\r\nbetween Austria and Prussia can scarcely be said to have turned upon\r\nprinciples of Government so much as upon a struggle for political\r\nascendency in Germany. At Berlin, at Dresden, and in Baden the\r\nPrussian Government has very properly no doubt employed military\r\nforce to reestablish order; and in regard to the affairs of Hesse, the\r\nground taken by Prussia was not so much a constitutional as a military\r\none, and the objection which she made to the entrance of the troops\r\nof the Diet was that those troops might become hostile, and that they\r\nought not, therefore, to occupy a central position in the line of\r\nmilitary defence of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe remark which your Majesty makes as to unanimity being required for\r\ncertain purposes by the Diet regulations is no doubt very just, and\r\nthat circumstance certainly shows that the free Conference which\r\nis about to be held is a better constructed body for planning a new\r\narrangement of a central organ.[49]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: War was staved off by the Conference; but the\r\n    relative predominance of Prussia and Austria in Germany was\r\n    left undecided for some years to come.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: STATE OF THE CONTINENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd November 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Accept my best thanks for your kind letter of the\r\n17th, and the dear little English one from dear little Charlotte,\r\nwhich is so nicely written, and shows such an amiable disposition.\r\nI send her to-day a little heart for the hair of our blessed Angel,\r\nwhich I hope she will often wear. Our girls have all got one. I have\r\nwritten to the dear child. You should have the dear children as much\r\nwith you as possible; I am _sure_ it would be so _good and useful_\r\nfor _you_ and _them_. Children ought to have great confidence in their\r\nparents, in order for them to have any influence over them.\r\n\r\nYesterday Vicky was ten years old. It seems a dream. If she lives, in\r\neight years more she may be married! She is a very clever child, and I\r\nmust say very much improved.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Continent is deplorable; the folly of Austria and the\r\ngiving way of Prussia are lamentable. _Our_ influence on the Continent\r\nis _null_.... Add to this, we are between two fires in _this_ country:\r\na furious Protestant feeling and an enraged Catholic feeling in\r\nIreland. I believe that Austria fans the flame at Rome, and that\r\nthe _whole movement_ on the Continent is _anti-Constitutional_,\r\n_anti-Protestant_, _and anti-English_; and this is so complicated, and\r\nwe have (thanks to Lord Palmerston) contrived to quarrel _so happily_,\r\nseparately with each, that I do not know _how_ we are to stand against\r\nit all!\r\n\r\nI must now conclude.

The real danger\r\nto be apprehended, and what I am certain has led to these proceedings\r\non the part of the Pope, lies in _our own_ divisions, and in the\r\nextraordinary conduct of the Puseyites. I trust that the eyes of many\r\nmay now be opened. One would, however, much regret to see any acts of\r\nintolerance towards the many innocent people who I believe entirely\r\ndisapprove the injudicious conduct of their Clergy.\r\n\r\nHoping that you are all well, believe me, always, yours,\r\naffectionately,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _29th November 1850._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I have no dear letter to answer, but write to keep\r\nto the dear day, rendered so peculiarly dear to me by the recollection\r\nof our dearly beloved Louise.\r\n\r\nWe are well, but much troubled with numberless things. Our religious\r\ntroubles are great, and I must just say that Cardinal Wiseman\r\n_himself_ admits that Austria not only approves the conduct of the\r\nPope but is urging _on_ the _Propaganda_. I _know this_ to be so.\r\nOur great difficulty must be, and will be, to steer clear of both\r\nparties--the violent Protestants and the Roman Catholics. We wish in\r\nno way to infringe the rights of the Roman Catholics, while we must\r\nprotect and uphold our own religion.\r\n\r\nWe have seen General Radowitz,[50] with whom we have been much\r\ninterested; his accounts are very clear and very able, and I must say,\r\nvery fair and strictly constitutional. You know him, I suppose? Might\r\nI again ask, dearest Uncle, if you would like to have a copy of Ross's\r\npicture of our angel Louise or of Winterhalter's?\r\n\r\nLady Lyttelton, who is returned, is very anxious in her enquiries\r\nafter you.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude, my dearest Uncle. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: General Radowitz, who had been Minister for\r\n    Foreign Affairs in Prussia, had just arrived in England on a\r\n    special mission from the King of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: STATE OF GERMANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _3rd December 1850._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--Two of your dear letters are before me, of the\r\n29th November and of yesterday. In the former you _give me a promise_,\r\nwhich I consider _most_ valuable, and which I shall _remind_ you of if\r\nyou get desponding, viz. \"I will to please you _labour on, and do all\r\nthe good I can_.\" It is so pleasing to feel that one _does_ good and\r\ndoes one's duty. It sweetens so many bitter trials.\r\n\r\nThe state of Germany is indeed a very anxious one. It is a mistake\r\nto think the _supremacy of Prussia_ is _what is wished for_. General\r\nRadowitz himself says that what is necessary for Germany [is] that\r\nshe should take the lead, and should redeem the pledges given in '48.\r\nUnless this be _done_ in a moderate and determined way, a _fearful\r\nreaction_ will take place, which will _overturn Thrones_; to use\r\nRadowitz's own words: \"_und nicht vor dem Thron stehen bleiben_.\"\r\nPrussia is the _only large_ and powerful _really German_ Power\r\nthere is, and therefore she must take the lead; but her constant\r\nvacillation--one day doing one thing and another day another--has\r\ncaused her to be entirely distrusted. You are quite right in saying\r\nthings should be done _d'un commun accord_, and I think that the other\r\ngreat Powers ought to be consulted. Unfortunately, _Lord Palmerston_\r\nhas contrived to make us _so hated_ by all parties abroad, that we\r\nhave lost our position and our influence, which, considering the\r\nflourishing and satisfactory state of this country during all the\r\nEuropean convulsions, _ought_ to have been _immense_. This it is\r\nwhich pains and grieves me so deeply, and which I have so plainly been\r\nspeaking to Lord John Russell about. What a noble position we _might_\r\nhave had, and how wantonly has it been thrown away!\r\n\r\nGood Stockmar is well, and always of the _greatest_ comfort and use to\r\nus. His judgment is so sound, so unbiassed, and so dispassionate. Ever\r\nyour devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ENGLAND AND ROME]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _8th December 1850._\r\n\r\nThe Queen received Lord John Russell's letter and the draft yesterday.\r\nHe must be a better judge of what the effect of Mr Sheil's[51]\r\npresence in Rome may be than she can; but for her own part, she thinks\r\nit entirely against her notions of what is _becoming_ to _ask_ the\r\n_Pope_ for a _favour_ (for it is tantamount to that) at a moment when\r\nhis name is being vilified and abused in every possible manner in\r\nthis country. It strikes the Queen as an _undignified_ course for this\r\nGovernment to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is glad to hear of what passed between the Archbishop and\r\nLord John.[52] She trusts that something may be done, as the desire\r\nfor it seems to be so great. On the other hand, the Queen deeply\r\nregrets the great abuse of the Roman Catholic religion which takes\r\nplace at all these meetings, etc. She thinks it unchristian and\r\nunwise, and trusts that it will soon cease....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: Minister at the Court of Tuscany.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: The Government were preparing for the\r\n    introduction of their Ecclesiastical Titles Bill.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LADY PEEL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _10th December 1850._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--My letter must, I fear, be a somewhat hurried and\r\nshort one, for my morning has been taken up in receiving in state\r\nAddresses from the City and Universities about this _unfortunate_\r\n\"Papal Aggression\" business, which is still keeping people in a\r\nfeverish state of wild excitement.[53] _One_ good effect it has had,\r\nviz. that of directing people's serious attention to the very alarming\r\ntendency of the _Tractarians_, which was doing _immense_ harm....\r\n\r\n_Many, many thanks_ for your two dear and kind letters of the 6th\r\nand of yesterday. All you _say_ about _Louise_, and about the\r\ndisappearance _for ever_ of _all_ that _she loved_ and was _proud of_,\r\nis so true, so _dreadful_. One fancies (foolishly and wrongly, but\r\nstill one _does_) that the lost one has been hardly used in no longer\r\nenjoying these earthly blessings, and one's grief seems to break\r\nout afresh in bitter agony upon _small and comparatively trifling_\r\noccasions. Poor Lady Peel (whom I saw for the first time yesterday at\r\nBuckingham Palace, whither I had gone for an hour) expressed _this_\r\nstrongly. _Hers_ is indeed a _broken heart_; she is so _truly_ crushed\r\nby the _agony_ of _her_ grief; it was _very_ touching to see and to\r\nhear her. Poor thing! she _never_ can be happy again!\r\n\r\nWhat you say about _me_ is far too kind. I am very _often_ sadly\r\ndissatisfied with myself and with the little self-control I have.\r\n\r\nYour long letter interested us much. I fear the German affairs are\r\nvery bad.... That everlasting \"backwards and forwards,\" as you say,\r\nof my poor friend the King of Prussia is _calamitous_; it causes\r\n_all_ parties to distrust him, and gives _real_ strength only to the\r\nRepublicans. Since '48 that has been his conduct, and the _misfortune_\r\nfor Germany. A _steady_ course, _whatever_ it may be, is _always_ the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nWhat you say about poor Helene[54] and France is true and sad. I\r\nreally wish you would caution Helene as to her language; she is much\r\nattached to you. I _pity_ her very much; her position is very trying,\r\nand her religion renders it more difficult even.\r\n\r\nI must now end my letter. I grieve to hear of your going _alone_ to\r\nArdenne; it is BAD for you to be alone, and your poor children also\r\nought not to be alone.

She\r\nsanctions the introduction into Parliament of a Bill framed on the\r\nprinciples agreed upon at yesterday's Cabinet, presuming that it will\r\nextend to the whole United Kingdom. What is to be done, however,\r\nwith respect to the Colonies where the Roman Catholic bishoprics are\r\nrecognised by the Government under territorial titles? and what is\r\nto be done with Dr Cullen, who has assumed the title of Archbishop\r\nof Armagh, Primate of all Ireland, which is punishable under the\r\nEmancipation Act? If this is left unnoticed, the Government will be\r\nleft with the \"_lame_\" argument in Parliament of which we conversed\r\nhere. Could the Government not be helped out of this difficulty by\r\nthe Primate himself prosecuting the obtruder? The Queen hopes that the\r\nmeeting of the archdeacons with Dr Lushington may do some good; she\r\ncannot say that she is pleased with the Archbishop's answer to the\r\nlaity published in to-day's _Times_, which leaves them without a\r\nremedy if the clergymen persist in Puseyite Rituals! The Queen will\r\nreturn Lord Minto's letter with the next messenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd December 1850._\r\n\r\nThe Queen now returns Lord Seymour's letter respecting the New Forest,\r\nand sanctions the proposed arrangement. Considering, however, that she\r\ngives up the deer, and all patronage and authority over the Forest,\r\nshe wishes the shooting, as the only remaining Royalty, not to be\r\nwithdrawn from her authority also. It will be quite right to give\r\nDeputations[57] to shoot over the various divisions and walks of the\r\nForest to gentlemen of the neighbourhood or others; but in order that\r\nthis may establish no right on their part, and may leave the Sovereign\r\na voice in the matter, she wishes that a list be prepared every\r\nyear of the persons recommended by the Office of Woods to receive\r\nDeputations and submitted for her approval.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57: A deputation, _i.e._, a deputed right to take\r\n    game.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ministry were in difficulties at the very beginning of the session\r\n(1851), being nearly defeated on a motion made in the interest of\r\nthe agricultural party; and though the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill was\r\nallowed to be brought in, they were beaten in a thin House chiefly by\r\ntheir own friends, on the question of the County Franchise. A crisis\r\nensued, and a coalition of Whigs and Peelites was attempted, but\r\nproved impracticable. Lord Stanley having then failed to form a\r\nProtectionist Ministry, the Whigs, much weakened, had to resume\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition, which was opened in Hyde Park on the 1st of May, was a\r\ncomplete success, a brilliant triumph indeed, for the Prince, over six\r\nmillion people visiting it; it remained open till the Autumn, and the\r\nbuilding, some time after its removal, was re-erected at Sydenham, at\r\nthe Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nThe Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, much modified, was proceeded with,\r\nand, though opposed by the ablest Peelites and Radicals, became law,\r\nthough its effect, while in operation, was virtually _nil_. It was in\r\nafter-years repealed.\r\n\r\nKossuth, the champion of Hungarian independence, visited England in\r\nOctober, and Lord Palmerston had to be peremptorily restrained\r\nfrom receiving him publicly at the Foreign Office. A little later,\r\nKossuth's ultra-liberal sympathisers in London addressed the Foreign\r\nSecretary in language violently denunciatory of the Emperors of\r\nAustria and Russia, for which Lord Palmerston failed to rebuke them.\r\nThe cup was filled to the brim by his recognition of the President's\r\n_coup d'etat_ in France. Louis Napoleon, after arresting M. Thiers and\r\nmany others, proclaimed the dissolution of the Council of State and\r\nthe National Assembly, decreed a state of siege, and re-established\r\nuniversal suffrage, with a Chief Magistrate elected for ten years,\r\nand a Ministry depending on the executive alone. Palmerston thereupon,\r\nthough professing an intention of non-interference, conveyed to the\r\nFrench Ambassador in London his full approbation of the proceeding,\r\nand his conviction that the President could not have acted otherwise.\r\nEven after this indiscreet action, the Premier found some difficulty\r\nin bringing him to book; but before the end of the year he was\r\ndismissed from office, with the offer, which he declined, of the\r\nIrish Lord-Lieutenancy and a British Peerage. Greatly to the Queen's\r\nsatisfaction, Lord Granville became Foreign Secretary.\r\n\r\nAt the Cape, Sir Harry Smith was engaged in operations against the\r\nKaffirs, which were not brought to a successful termination till the\r\nfollowing year, when General Cathcart had superseded him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n1851\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _25th January 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen approves of the elevation of Mr. Pemberton Leigh[1] to the\r\nPeerage, which she considers a very useful measure, and not likely to\r\nlead to any permanent increase of the Peerage, as he is not likely\r\nto marry at his present age, and considering that he has only a life\r\ninterest in his large property.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the creation of Dr Lushington[2] as a Peer, without\r\nremainder, the Queen has again thoroughly considered the question, and\r\nis of opinion that the establishment of the principle of creation for\r\nlife--in cases where public advantage may be derived from the grant of\r\na Peerage, but where there may be no fortune to support the dignity in\r\nthe family--is most desirable. The mode in which the public will take\r\nthe introduction of it will however chiefly depend upon the merits of\r\nthe first case brought forward. Dr Lushington appears to the Queen\r\nso unobjectionable in this respect that she cannot but approve of the\r\nexperiment being tried with him.\r\n\r\nIt would be well, however, that it should be done quietly; that it\r\nshould not be talked about beforehand or get into the papers, which so\r\nfrequently happens on occasions of this kind, and generally does harm.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Member of Parliament for Rye 1881-1832, and Ripon\r\n    1835-1843, afterwards a member of the Judicial Committee of\r\n    the Privy Council: he became a Peer (Lord Kingsdown) in 1858,\r\n    having declined a peerage on the present and other occasions.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Dr Lushington was judge of the Admiralty Court:\r\n    he had been counsel for, and an executor of, Queen Caroline.\r\n    He declined the offer now suggested, and the subsequent\r\n    debates on the Wensleydale Peerage show that the proposed\r\n    grant would have been ineffectual for its purpose.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st January 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Palmerston's letter of the 29th, in which\r\nhe proposes a change in those diplomatic arrangements which she had\r\nalready sanctioned on his recommendation, and must remark that the\r\nreasons which Lord Palmerston adduces in support of his present\r\nproposition are in direct contradiction to those by which he supported\r\nhis former recommendation.[3]\r\n\r\nThe principle which the Queen would wish to see acted upon in her\r\ndiplomatic appointments in general, is, that the _good of the service_\r\nshould precede every other consideration, and that the selection of\r\nan agent should depend more on his personal qualifications for the\r\nparticular post for which he is to be selected than on the mere\r\npleasure and convenience of the person to be employed, or of the\r\nMinister recommending him.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lord Palmerston's first proposal, Sir H. Seymour was to\r\nhave gone to St Petersburg, Lord Bloomfield to Berlin, and Sir Richard\r\nPakenham to Lisbon; now Lord Palmerston wishes to send Lord Cowley to\r\nSt Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has the highest opinion of Lord Cowley's abilities, and\r\nagrees with Lord Palmerston in thinking that Russia will, for some\r\ntime at least, exercise a predominating influence over all European\r\naffairs. She would accordingly not object to see that Agent accredited\r\nthere in whom she herself places the greatest confidence. But\r\naccording to the same principle, she must insist that the posts\r\nof Berlin and Frankfort, which in her opinion are of nearly equal\r\nimportance, should be filled by men capable of dealing with the\r\ncomplicated and dangerous political questions now in agitation there,\r\nand the just appreciation and judicious treatment of which are of\r\nthe highest importance to the peace of Europe, and therefore to the\r\nwelfare of England.\r\n\r\nBefore the Queen therefore decides upon Lord Palmerston's new\r\nproposals, she wishes to know _whom_ he could recommend for the post\r\nof Frankfort in the event of Lord Cowley leaving it, and thinks it\r\nbut right to premise that in giving her sanction to the proposals\r\nLord Palmerston may have to submit, she will be guided entirely by the\r\nprinciple set forth above.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Lord Palmerston had altered his mind as to\r\n    certain proposed diplomatic changes, and suggested the\r\n    appointment of Sir Hamilton Seymour to Berlin, Lord Bloomfield\r\n    to Lisbon, Lord Cowley to Petersburg, Mr Jerningham, Sir Henry\r\n    Ellis, or Sir Richard Pakenham to Frankfort.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _12th January 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nhas the honour to state that Mr Disraeli brought forward his Motion\r\nyesterday.[4] His speech was long and elaborate, but not that of a man\r\nwho was persuaded he was undertaking a good cause.\r\n\r\nHe proposed nothing specific, but said nothing offensive.\r\n\r\nThe doubts about the division increase. Mr Hayter reckoned yesterday\r\non a majority of three! Sir James Graham is of opinion Lord Stanley\r\nwill not undertake anything desperate. He will speak in favour of\r\nGovernment to-morrow, when the division will probably take place.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: On agricultural distress; the Motion was lost by\r\n    fourteen only in a large House.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _15th February 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Palmerston's letter of yesterday, and\r\nhas to state in answer her decision in favour of the original plan of\r\nappointments, viz. of Sir H. Seymour to Petersburg, Lord Bloomfield\r\nto Berlin, and Sir R. Pakenham to Lisbon. The Queen quite agrees with\r\nLord Palmerston in the opinion that the post at Petersburg is more\r\nimportant than that of Frankfort, and had Lord Palmerston been able\r\nto propose a good successor to Lord Cowley she would have approved\r\nhis going to Petersburg; Sir R. Pakenham, however, would not take\r\nFrankfort if offered to him, as it appears, and the two other persons\r\nproposed would not do for it, in the Queen's opinion. It must not be\r\nforgotten that at a place for action like Petersburg, the Minister\r\nwill chiefly have to look to his instructions from home, while at\r\na place of observation, as Lord Palmerston justly calls Frankfort,\r\neverything depends upon the acuteness and impartiality of the\r\nobserver, and upon the confidence with which he may be able to inspire\r\nthose from whom alone accurate information can be obtained. Lord\r\nCowley possesses eminently these qualities, and Sir H. Seymour has\r\nat all times shown himself equal to acting under most difficult\r\ncircumstances. The desire of the Emperor to see Lord Cowley at\r\nPetersburg may possibly resolve itself in the desire of Baron Brunnow\r\nto see him removed from Germany.... The Queen had always understood\r\nthat Sir H.

Grey had offered\r\nto resign his office in order that Sir J. Graham might have it. Before\r\nI go farther I ought to say that Lord John yesterday explained the\r\nimportance of obtaining support like Sir J. Graham's in the Cabinet,\r\nand that he thought of proposing the Board of Control to him, which\r\nSir J. Hobhouse was ready to give up--receiving a Peerage, and\r\nretaining a seat in the Cabinet or the Admiralty, which Sir F. Baring\r\nwas equally ready to give up.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir J. Graham said that before he answered he wished to show\r\nLord John a correspondence which had passed between him and Lord\r\nLondonderry. In the course of conversation in the country, Sir James\r\nhad said to Lord Londonderry that parties never could go on as they\r\nwere, and that they must ultimately lapse into _two_; this, Lord\r\nLondonderry reported to Mr Disraeli, who told it to Lord Stanley;\r\nand Mr Disraeli wrote to Lord Londonderry, stating that if certain\r\nadvantages and reliefs were given to the landed interests, he\r\nshould not cling to Protection; in short, much what he said in his\r\nspeech--and that he was quite prepared to give up the lead in the\r\nHouse of Commons to Sir J. Graham. Sir James answered that he never\r\nmeant anything by what he had said, and that he had no wish whatever\r\nto join Lord Stanley; that if he had, he was so intimate with Lord\r\nStanley that he would have communicated direct with him.\r\n\r\nSir James said that as soon as he heard from Lord John, he thought\r\n_what_ he wished to see him for, and that he had been thinking over\r\nit, and had been talking to Lord Hardinge and Mr Cardwell. That he\r\ndid wish to support the Government, but that he thought he could be of\r\nmore use if he did not join the Government, and was able to give them\r\nan independent support; that he had not attempted to lead Sir Robert\r\nPeel's followers; that many who had followed Sir Robert would _not_\r\nfollow _him_; that he thought the Government in great danger; that\r\nthe Protectionists, Radicals, and Irish Members would try to take\r\nan opportunity to overset them (the Government); that should the\r\nGovernment be turned out, he would find no difficulty in joining them;\r\nor should they go on, that by-and-by it might be easier to do so; but\r\nthat at this moment he should be injuring himself without doing\r\nthe Government any real service; besides which, there were so many\r\nmeasures decided on which he was ignorant of, and should have to\r\nsupport. Lord John told him that were he in the Cabinet, he would have\r\nthe means of stating and enforcing his opinions, and that at whatever\r\ntime he joined them, there would always be the same difficulty about\r\nmeasures which had already been decided on. He (Sir James) is not\r\nquite satisfied with the Papal Aggression Bill, which he thinks will\r\nexasperate the Irish; he also adverted to the report of our having\r\nprotested against Austria bringing her Italian Provinces, etc., into\r\nthe German Confederation. Lord John told him that this had not been\r\ndone, but that we meant to ask for explanations.\r\n\r\nIn short, Lord John said it was evident that Sir James thought the\r\nGovernment in great danger, and \"did not wish to embark in a boat\r\nwhich was going to sink.\" Still, he was friendly, and repeated that\r\nit would be very easy when in opposition to unite, and then to come in\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEFEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _21st February 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to report that on a motion of Mr Locke King's[5] yesterday\r\nthe Government was defeated by a hundred to fifty-two.\r\n\r\nThis is another circumstance which makes it probable the Ministry\r\ncannot endure long.

On his\r\nreturn he explained that after the vote at the beginning of the\r\nSession on the Orders of the Day, which went directly against the\r\nGovernment, after the small majority (only fourteen) which they had on\r\nthe motion of Mr Disraeli on the landed interest, and now the defeat\r\non the Franchise, it was clear that the Government did not possess\r\nthe confidence of the House of Commons. He complained of the\r\nProtectionists staying away in a body on Mr King's motion, and he\r\n(Lord John) himself being left without a supporter even amongst\r\nhis colleagues in the debate, but most of all of the conduct of the\r\nRadicals; for when Mr King, hearing Lord John's promise to bring in\r\na measure next Session, wanted to withdraw his Motion, as he ought to\r\nhave done on such a declaration by the head of the Government, Mr Hume\r\ninsisted upon his going on, \"else Lord John would withdraw his promise\r\nagain in a fortnight\"; and when the result of the vote was made known\r\nthe shouting and triumph of the hundred was immense.\r\n\r\nLord John had declared to the Cabinet that he could not go on, that\r\nthe Income Tax would have to be voted the next day, and a defeat was\r\nprobable; it were much better therefore not to hesitate, and to resign\r\nat once. The Cabinet agreed, although some Members thought with Lord\r\nPalmerston that the occasion was hardly sufficient. Lord John begged\r\nto be allowed till to-day, in order to see Lord Lansdowne, whom he\r\nhad sent for from the country, and to be able to tender then his\r\nresignation; he would go down to the House to adjourn it, promising\r\nexplanations on Monday.\r\n\r\nWe agreed with Lord John that he owed to his station personally, and\r\nas the Queen's Minister, not to put up with ignominious treatment,\r\npraised his speech on the Suffrage, which is admirable, and regretted\r\nthat his colleagues had prevented him from bringing in a measure\r\nthis year. We talked of the difficulty of forming any Government, but\r\nagreed that Lord Stanley and the Protection Party ought to be appealed\r\nto; they longed for office, and would not rest quiet till they had had\r\nit if for ever so short a time only.\r\n\r\nWe further went over the ground of a possible demand for a\r\nDissolution, which might bring on a general commotion in the country.\r\nLord John agreed in this, but thought the responsibility to be very\r\ngreat for the Crown to refuse an appeal to the country to the new\r\nGovernment; he thought a decision on that point ought to depend on the\r\npeculiar circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne, who had come from Bowood by the express train, arrived\r\nat twelve o'clock, and came at once to meet Lord John Russell here at\r\nthe Palace.\r\n\r\nIn the audience which the Queen gave him he expressed his entire\r\nconcurrence with the decision the Cabinet had come to, as the\r\nresignation could at any rate only have been delayed. It was clear\r\nthat the Cabinet had lost the confidence of the House of Commons; what\r\nhad happened the other night was only the last drop which made the\r\ncup flow over, and that it was much more dignified not to let the\r\nGovernment die a lingering and ignominious death; he [thought] that\r\nLord Stanley would have great difficulties, but would be able to form\r\na Government; at least the Protectionist Party gave out that they had\r\na Cabinet prepared.\r\n\r\nWe then saw Lord John Russell, who formally tendered his resignation,\r\nand was very much moved on taking leave; he said that, considering\r\nLord Stanley's principles, it would not be possible for him to hold\r\nout any hope of support to that Government, except on the estimates\r\nfor which he felt responsible, but he would at all times be ready\r\nvigorously to defend the Crown, which was in need of every support in\r\nthese days.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock came Lord Stanley, whom the Queen had summoned.\r\n\r\nThe Queen informed him of the resignation of the Government, in\r\nconsequence of the late vote, which had been the result of the\r\nProtectionists staying away, of the small majority which the\r\nGovernment had had upon Mr Disraeli's Motion, and of the many symptoms\r\nof want of confidence exhibited towards the Government in the House\r\nof Commons. The Queen had accepted their resignation, and had sent\r\nfor him as the head of that Party, which was now the most numerous in\r\nOpposition, in order to ask him whether he could undertake to form a\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley expressed great surprise. The impression had been that\r\nthe Government had not been in earnest in their opposition to Mr L.\r\nKing's Motion; in the minority had voted only twenty-seven members of\r\nthe Government side, the rest had been of his Party. He asked if the\r\nwhole Cabinet had resigned, or whether there had been dissension in\r\nthe Cabinet upon it? The Queen replied that the resignation had been\r\nunanimously agreed upon in the Cabinet, and that Lord Lansdowne,\r\nwho had only come up from Bowood this morning, had given his entire\r\napproval to it. Lord Stanley then asked whether anybody else had\r\nbeen consulted or applied to, to which the Queen replied that she had\r\nwritten to him a few minutes after Lord John's resignation, and had\r\ncommunicated with no one else. Lord Stanley then said that he hoped\r\nthe Queen's acceptance had only been a conditional one; that he felt\r\nvery much honoured by the Queen's confidence; that he hoped he\r\nmight be able to tender advice which might contribute to the Queen's\r\ncomfort, and might relieve the present embarrassment.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to do so he must enter most freely and openly into\r\nhis own position and that of his Party. It was quite true that they\r\nformed the most numerous in Parliament after the supporters of what\r\nhe hoped he might still call the _present_ Government, but that there\r\nwere no men contained in it who combined great ability with experience\r\nin public business. There was one certainly of great ability and\r\ntalent--Mr Disraeli--but who had never held office before, and perhaps\r\nMr Herries, who possessed great experience, but who did not command\r\ngreat authority in the House of Commons; that he should have great\r\ndifficulties in presenting to the Queen a Government fit to be\r\naccepted, unless he could join with some of the late Sir R. Peel's\r\nfollowers; that he considered, for instance, the appointment of a good\r\nperson for Foreign Affairs indispensable, and there was scarcely any\r\none fit for it except Lord Palmerston and Lord Aberdeen. Lord Aberdeen\r\nhad told him that he had no peculiar views upon Free Trade, and that\r\nhe did not pretend to understand the question, but that he had felt it\r\nhis duty to stand by Sir R. Peel; this might now be different, but\r\nit ought first to be ascertained whether a combination of those\r\nwho agreed in principle, and had only been kept asunder hitherto by\r\n_personal_ considerations, could not be formed; that Sir James Graham\r\nhad in his last speech declared it as his opinion that the ranks of\r\nthose who agreed ought to be closed; when such a combination had taken\r\nplace, those of Sir R. Peel's followers who could not agree to\r\nit might not be unwilling to join him (Lord Stanley). As to his\r\nprinciples, he would frankly state that he thought that the landed\r\ninterest was much depressed by the low state of prices; that an import\r\nduty on corn would be absolutely necessary, which, however, would be\r\nlow, and only a revenue duty; such a duty, he thought, the country\r\nwould be prepared for; and if they were allowed to state their honest\r\nopinion, he felt sure the greatest part of the present Government\r\nwould be heartily glad of. He would require Duties upon sugar\r\nfor revenue, but he could not conceal that if the revenue after a\r\ndiminution in the direct taxation, which he would propose, should\r\nconsiderably fall off, he might be driven to raise the Import duties\r\non other articles. He thought the present House of Commons could\r\nhardly be expected to reverse its decision upon the financial and\r\ncommercial policy of the country, and that accordingly a Dissolution\r\nof Parliament would become necessary. Such a Dissolution, however,\r\ncould not be undertaken at this moment for the sake of public\r\nbusiness. The Mutiny Bill had not been voted nor the Supplies, and it\r\nwould require more than eight weeks before the new Parliament could\r\nbe assembled, and consequently the Crown would be left without Army or\r\nmoney. A Dissolution could accordingly not take place before Easter.\r\nHe felt, however, that if he were to take office now, he would between\r\nthis and Easter be exposed to such harassing attacks that he should\r\nnot be able to withstand them; moreover, it would subject the members\r\nof his Government to two elections in two months. He hoped therefore\r\nthat the Queen would try to obtain a Government by a coalition of the\r\nWhigs and Peelites, but that this failing, if the Queen should send\r\nagain for him, and it was clear no other Government could be formed,\r\nhe would feel it his duty as a loyal subject to risk everything,\r\nexcept his principles and his honour, to carry on the Government; and\r\nhe hoped that in such a case the Queen would look leniently on the\r\ncomposition of the Cabinet which he could offer, and that the country\r\nwould, from the consideration of the circumstances, give it a fair\r\ntrial. He begged, however, that he might not be called upon to take\r\noffice except as a _dernier ressort_, a _necessity_.\r\n\r\nI interrupted him when he spoke of his financial measures, and begged\r\nhim further to explain, when it appeared that a duty of about six\r\nshillings on corn was the least he could impose to bring up the price\r\nto forty-five shillings, which Sir R. Peel had stated to the House of\r\nCommons was in his opinion the lowest price wheat would fall to after\r\nthe abolition of the Corn Laws.\r\n\r\nWe expressed our doubts as to the country agreeing to such a measure,\r\nand our apprehension of the violent spirit which would be roused in\r\nthe working classes by a Dissolution for that purpose, which Lord\r\nStanley, however, did not seem to apprehend; on the contrary, he\r\nthought the distress of the farmers would lead to the destruction of\r\nthe landed interest, which was the only support to the Throne.\r\n\r\nI told him that the Queen and certainly myself had been under a\r\ndelusion, and that I was sure the country was equally so, as to\r\nhis intention to return to Protection. Sometimes it was stated that\r\nProtection would be adhered to, sometimes that it was given up,\r\nand that it was _compensation_ to the landed interest which the\r\nProtectionists looked to. His last speeches and the Motion of Mr\r\nDisraeli led to that belief, but that it was of the highest importance\r\nthat the country should know exactly what was intended; the Queen\r\nwould then have an opportunity of judging how the nation looked upon\r\nthe proposal. I hoped therefore that the declaration of his opinions\r\nwhich Lord Stanley had now laid before the Queen would be clearly\r\nenunciated by him in Parliament when the Ministerial explanations\r\nshould take place, which would naturally follow this crisis.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley merely answered that he hoped that no explanations would\r\ntake place before a Government was formed. He said he should wish the\r\nword \"Protection\" to be merged, to which I rejoined that though he\r\nmight wish this, I doubted whether the country would let him.\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave, he repeated over and over again his advice that\r\nthe Coalition Ministry should be tried.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n_22nd February 1851._\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to be perfectly accurate in stating Lord Stanley's\r\nopinions, which the Queen feels some delicacy in doing, she would be\r\nvery thankful if he would write down for her what he just stated to\r\nher--as his advice in the present difficulty. Of course she would not\r\nlet such a paper go out of her hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR JAMES GRAHAM]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FOREIGN POLICY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _23rd February 1851._\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, who had been out of Town, came at six o'clock,\r\nhaving received my letter on his return. Lord John Russell had been\r\nhere before that time.\r\n\r\nAfter having stated to him (Lord John) what had passed with Lord\r\nStanley, we told him that Sir James Graham was here; Lord John seemed\r\nmuch surprised at Lord Stanley's refusal to form an Administration,\r\ndeclared himself ready to do what he could towards the formation of a\r\nnew Government on an extended basis, but thought that Sir James Graham\r\nand Lord Aberdeen should have the first offer.\r\n\r\nI went accordingly over to my room, where Sir James was waiting. He\r\nwas entirely taken by surprise by the announcement of the resignation\r\nof the Government, and begged to be able to state to me how he was\r\nsituated before he saw the Queen and Lord John.\r\n\r\nI then communicated to him what had passed with Lord Stanley, upon\r\nwhich we had a conversation of more than an hour, of which the chief\r\nfeatures were:\r\n\r\n1. Apprehension on the part of Sir James Graham lest the attempt on\r\nthe part of Lord Stanley to re-impose Protective duties should produce\r\nuniversal commotion in the country, which would be increased by the\r\nDissolution, without which Lord Stanley would not be able to proceed.\r\n\r\n2. His disbelief that Lord Aberdeen would be able to join in any\r\nGovernment abandoning Sir R. Peel's principles, as he had been\r\nconsulted before and after Sir James's late speech in which he\r\nexpressed his entire concurrence.\r\n\r\n3. His own utter weakness, calling himself the weakest man in England,\r\nwho had lost his only friend in Sir R. Peel, and had for the last\r\nfifteen years not exercised an independent judgment, but rested\r\nentirely on his friend.\r\n\r\n4. His disagreement with some of his late colleagues--the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, Mr Gladstone, and Mr Sidney Herbert--in religious opinions.\r\n\r\n5. His disagreement with Lord John's Government upon some most\r\nimportant points.\r\n\r\nHe could not take office with Lord Palmerston as Foreign Secretary,\r\nwhose policy and mode of conducting business he disapproved, who\r\nwas now protesting against the admission of Austria into the German\r\nConfederation; he disapproved the Papal Aggression Bill, finding it\r\nmilitating against the line which he had taken as Secretary of State\r\nwith regard to the Roman Catholic Bishops in Ireland, and particularly\r\nthe Bequest Act, and considering that after Lord John's letter the\r\nBill would fall short of the high expectations formed in the minds of\r\nthe English public.\r\n\r\nHe disapproved of the abolition of the Irish Lord-Lieutenancy, and the\r\nmaking a fourth Secretary of State had been considered by Sir\r\nRobert Peel and himself as introducing into England all the Irish\r\nmalpractices, while Ireland was still kept wholly separate from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nLord John had raised a new difficulty by his declaration upon Reform.\r\nHe had been thunderstruck when he read the announcement on the part\r\nof the chief author of the Reform Bill, who had stood with him (Sir\r\nJ. Graham) hitherto upon _finality_, condemning his own work, and\r\npromising at a year's distance important alterations, in which\r\ninterval great agitation would be got up, great expectations raised,\r\nand the measure when brought forward would cause disappointment. Sir\r\nRobert Peel had always been of opinion that it was most dangerous to\r\ntouch these questions, but if opened with the consent of the Crown, a\r\nmeasure should at once be brought forward and passed.\r\n\r\nAfter my having replied to these different objections, that the Queen\r\nfelt herself the importance of Lord Palmerston's removal, and would\r\nmake it herself a condition with Lord John that he should not be again\r\nForeign Secretary; that the protest to Austria had not gone, and that\r\nupon studying the question Sir James would find that the entrance of\r\nthe whole Austrian Monarchy, while giving France a pretext for war and\r\ninfringing the Treaties of 1815, would not tend to the strength and\r\nunity of Germany, which held to be the true English interest, but\r\nquite the reverse; that I did not think the Papal Aggression Bill\r\ntouched the Bequest Act or militated against toleration; that the\r\nLieutenancy would perhaps be given up, and a measure on the Franchise\r\nbe considered by the _new_ Government and brought forward at once.\r\nI thought it would be better to discuss the matters with Lord John\r\nRussell in the Queen's presence, who accordingly joined us.\r\n\r\nThe discussion which now arose went pretty much over the same ground,\r\nLord John agreeing that Lord Palmerston ought to form no difficulty,\r\nthat the Papal Aggression Bill would be further modified, that the\r\nLieutenancy Bill might be given up, that he agreed to Sir James's\r\nobjection to the declaration about reform, but that he had intended to\r\nbring forward a measure, if he had been able to get his colleagues to\r\nagree to it, that he would be ready to propose a measure at once. This\r\nSir J. Graham thought important as a means of gaining at a General\r\nElection, which he foresaw could not be long delayed, whoever formed a\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain some result from this long debate I summed up what\r\nmight be considered as agreed upon, viz. That there was _tabula rasa_,\r\nand for the new Coalition a free choice of men and measures, to which\r\nthey assented, Lord John merely stating that he could not take office\r\nwithout part of his friends, and could not sacrifice his _personal_\r\ndeclarations. Dinnertime having approached, and Lord Aberdeen having\r\nwritten that he would be with us after nine o'clock, we adjourned the\r\nfurther discussion till then, when they would return.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the Queen dressed I had an interview with the Duke of\r\nWellington, who had come to dine here, in which I informed him of\r\nthe nature of our crisis. He expressed his regret and his dread of a\r\nProtectionist Government with a Dissolution, which might lead to civil\r\ncommotion. He could not forgive, he said, the high Tory Party for\r\ntheir having stayed away the other night on Mr Locke King's Motion,\r\nand thus abandoned their own principles; he had no feeling for Lord\r\nJohn Russell's Cabinet, measures, or principles, but he felt that\r\nthe Crown and the country were only safe in these days by having the\r\nLiberals in office, else they would be driven to join the Radical\r\nagitation against the institutions of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we resumed our adjourned debate in my room, at a quarter\r\nto ten, with Lord Aberdeen, and were soon joined by Lord John and Sir\r\nJames Graham. We went over the same ground with him. Lord Stanley's\r\nletter was read and discussed. Lord Aberdeen declared his inability to\r\njoin in a Protectionist Ministry; he did not pretend to understand the\r\nquestion of Free Trade, but it was a point of honour with him not to\r\nabandon it, and now, since Sir R. Peel's death, a matter of piety.\r\nHe thought the danger of a Dissolution on a question of food by the\r\nCrown, for the purpose of imposing a tax upon bread, of the utmost\r\ndanger for the safety of the country. He disapproved the Papal Bill,\r\nthe abolition of the Lieutenancy, he had no difficulty upon the\r\nFranchise, for though he was called a _despot_, he felt a good deal of\r\nthe Radical in him sometimes.\r\n\r\nLord John put it to Lord Aberdeen, whether _he_ would not undertake to\r\nform a Government, to which Lord Aberdeen gave no distinct reply.\r\n\r\nAs Sir James Graham raised nothing but difficulties, though professing\r\nthe greatest readiness to be of use, and as it was getting on towards\r\nmidnight, we broke up, with the Queen's injunction that _one_ of\r\nthe three gentlemen _must_ form a Government, to which Lord Aberdeen\r\nlaughingly replied: \"I see your Majesty has come into[6] the President\r\nde la Republique.\" Lord John was to see Lord Lansdowne _to-day_ at\r\nthree o'clock, and would report progress to the Queen at five o'clock.\r\nOn one point we were agreed, viz. that the Government to be formed\r\nmust not be for the moment, but with a view to strength and stability.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: _Sic._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COMPLICATIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n_23d February 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has seen Lord Aberdeen and Sir J. Graham, but is sorry to\r\nsay that her doing so was premature, as they had no opportunity of\r\nseeing each other after they left Lord John Russell, and therefore had\r\nnot considered the Memorandum[7] which Lord John had handed to them.\r\nLord Aberdeen has in the interval seen Lord Stanley, and declared\r\nto him that he must undeceive him as to the possibility of his ever\r\njoining a Protection Government. What further resulted from the\r\nconversation the Queen would prefer to state to Lord John verbally\r\nto-morrow. Perhaps Lord John would come in the forenoon to-morrow, or\r\nbefore he goes to the House; he will be so good as to let her know.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: With a view of uniting with the Peelites, Lord\r\n    John drew up a Memorandum, printed in Walpole's _Lord John\r\n    Russell_, vol. ii. chap, xxii., with the following points:\r\n\r\n    A Cabinet of not more than eleven Members.\r\n\r\n    The present commercial policy to be maintained.\r\n\r\n    The financial measures of the year to be open to revision.\r\n\r\n    The Ecclesiastical Titles Bill to be persevered in so far as\r\n    the Preamble and the first clause, but the remaining clauses\r\n    to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n    A Reform Bill for the extension of the Franchise.\r\n\r\n    A Commission of Enquiry into corrupt practices at elections in\r\n    cities and boroughs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _23rd February 1851._\r\n(_Sunday._)\r\n\r\nLord John Russell came at half-past five, much fatigued and depressed.\r\nOn the Queen's asking whether he could report any progress, he said\r\nhe thought he could; he had met Lord Aberdeen and Sir James Graham,\r\ntogether with Sir George Grey (Lord Lansdowne being ill). That he\r\nhad informed them that he had received the Queen's commands to form a\r\nGovernment (?) and handed to them a Memorandum which follows here and\r\nwhich they had promised to take into consideration.\r\n\r\nWe asked him whether he had chalked out a Government. He said he\r\nhad not thought of it yet; he added, however, that _he_ could not\r\nundertake the Foreign Affairs with the lead in the House of Commons\r\nand Government (which the Queen had pressed upon him); Lord Palmerston\r\nmight be leader in the House of Lords; he would not like Lord Aberdeen\r\nat the Foreign Office; Lord Clarendon and Lord Granville were equally\r\nacceptable to him.\r\n\r\nI suggested that it might be well if the Queen were to see Sir James\r\nand Lord Aberdeen again, which he approved, but thought it better he\r\nshould not be present himself, and that the Queen might tell Sir James\r\nthat he might have any Office he liked; perhaps _he_ would take the\r\nForeign Affairs.\r\n\r\nLord John's relations and private friends evidently are distressed at\r\nhis resuming office; the Radicals were very much pleased with the idea\r\nof Sir James Graham being in office.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN SUMMONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\n_24th February 1851._\r\n_(Monday evening._)\r\n\r\nLord John came at three o'clock before making his statement to the\r\nHouse of Commons. We communicated to him what had passed with Sir\r\nJames Graham and Lord Aberdeen yesterday evening. He thought his\r\nMemorandum had been misunderstood: the nature of the Reform Bill\r\nwas left open to discussion, and what he had said about filling the\r\nOffices only meant that the Offices should not be divided according to\r\nnumber, and each party left to fill up its share, as had been done in\r\nformer Coalition Ministries. He had seen Lord Palmerston, who was not\r\nwilling to give up the Foreign Office--spoke of retiring from business\r\nat his age, of his success in conducting Foreign Affairs, and of its\r\nbeing a self-condemnation if he accepted another Office. Lord John\r\ntold him that he did not agree in this view, that the Lord-Lieutenancy\r\nof Ireland was to be maintained, and thought it best to leave it\r\nthere. He thought Lord Palmerston had given up the idea of leading\r\nthe House of Commons. We ascertained from him in conversation that he\r\ncould not agree to Lord Aberdeen taking the Foreign Office nor that he\r\ncould serve under Lord Aberdeen or Sir James Graham in case any one of\r\nthese were to form a Government.\r\n\r\nAt half-past six Lord John returned from the House of Commons, and\r\nreported that two very important events had taken place: the one that\r\nupon his making his statement to the House that the Government had\r\nresigned, that Lord Stanley had been sent for, had declared _his\r\ninability then to form a Government_ (words agreed upon between\r\nLord Lansdowne, Lord John, and Sir George Grey), and that he was now\r\ncharged with the formation of a Government, Mr. Disraeli got up, and\r\ndenied that Lord Stanley had declined forming a Government, which was\r\nreceived with cheers from the Protectionists. Lord John had merely\r\nanswered that when Lord Stanley would make his explanations, what he\r\nhad stated would be found to be correct, relying entirely, not upon\r\nwhat the Queen had communicated, but on Lord Stanley's own letter. The\r\nsecond event was a letter from Lord Aberdeen and Sir James Graham,[8]\r\nwhich put _an end_ to all _thoughts_ of a Coalition. It stated that\r\nthey could agree to no legislation whatever on the Papal Aggressions,\r\nand ended with a hint that Sir James Graham was prepared to go farther\r\nin reductions than Lord John was likely to consent to.\r\n\r\nLord John had at once answered that although he did not understand the\r\nlatter objection, the difference on the Papal Bill must put an end\r\nto their negotiation. We much lamented the result, and after some\r\ndiscussion agreed that the only thing to be done now was to send for\r\nLord Aberdeen. Lord Stanley could not pretend to be consulted before\r\nevery other means of forming a Government had been exhausted.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Published in Walpole's _Lord John Russell_, vol.\r\n    ii. chap. xxii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN DECLINES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _24th February 1851._\r\n(_Half-past ten_ P.M.)\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns these papers, as Lord John Russell wished. She has\r\njust seen Lord Aberdeen and Sir James Graham, who, though ready to do\r\nanything which could be of any use to the Queen and the country, have\r\nstated it as their decided opinion that Lord Stanley should be asked\r\nto form a Government. Under these circumstances the Queen intends to\r\nsend to Lord Stanley to-morrow. The Queen did ask Lord Aberdeen if he\r\ncould undertake to form a Government, but he said that he thought it\r\nwould not be successful, and that the Papal Aggression would be an\r\ninsurmountable difficulty for him and Sir James Graham.\r\n\r\nThe Queen rejoices to hear from them, and from Lord John and Lord\r\nLansdowne, the expression of cordiality of feeling, which it is so\r\nessential for the Crown and the country that there should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ABERDEEN AND GRAHAM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25 February 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Through Van der Weyer, you will have heard what was\r\nthe state of the _long_ and anxious crisis yesterday evening.\r\n\r\nAlas! the hope of forming a strong Coalition Government has\r\nfailed--_for the present_. I say for the present, as they are all so\r\nentirely agreed on the Commercial Policy that another time they hope\r\nthere will be no difficulty, when they have _fought together_.\r\nThe _Papal Aggression_ has in fact been the only insurmountable\r\ndifficulty. We sent to Lord Aberdeen last night (both he and Sir James\r\nGraham have been most kind to us), and asked if _he_ could not try\r\nto form a Government; but with the greatest readiness to serve me, he\r\nsaid he could not, on account of this self-same Papal Aggression. He\r\nequally declares that he cannot join Lord Stanley. Accordingly this\r\nmorning I have seen Lord Stanley, and he means to try if he can form\r\nany fit sort of Government, but he has _no_ men of talent, and his\r\ndifficulties are gigantic. I shall only know to-morrow _definitely_ if\r\nhe _can_ form an Administration. I am calm and courageous, having such\r\nsupport and advice as my dearest Albert's; but it is an anxious time,\r\nand the uncertainty and suspense very trying. More details you will\r\nhave later on. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD STANLEY TO BE SUMMONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _26th February 1851._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen and Sir James Graham came yesterday evening at nine\r\no'clock; the Queen put it to them whether _they_ could form a\r\nGovernment, to which they replied that they had turned it in their\r\nheads a hundred times, that there was nothing they would not do to\r\nshow their readiness to serve the Queen, but that they did not see a\r\npossibility of forming an Administration which could stand a day. They\r\nwere most likely at that moment the two most unpopular men in England,\r\nhaving declared that nothing should be done in Parliament against the\r\nPapal Aggression, which the whole country clamoured for; the Whigs\r\nwould be very angry with them for their having broken up the new\r\ncombination; they might find favour with the Radicals, but that was\r\na support upon which no reliance could be placed. There was a growing\r\nopinion that Lord Stanley ought to have a chance of bringing forward\r\nhis measures; that it was perilous, but that it was an evil which must\r\nbe gone through; that this opinion had been strongly expressed by Lord\r\nLansdowne, whose moderation nobody could doubt; that it was shared by\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, Mr Sidney Herbert, and others of Sir James's\r\nfriends whom he had had time to consult.\r\n\r\nUpon the Queen's expression of her great apprehension as to the\r\nconsequence of such a step on the country, they said there would\r\nno doubt spring up a most violent opposition, that there would be\r\nattempts to stop the supplies and dissolve the Army, but that Lord\r\nJohn Russell and Sir James Graham together would do their utmost to\r\npreach moderation, and would refer the House of Commons to the Queen's\r\nexample, who had taken strictly the Constitutional course throughout\r\nthe crisis, whose opinions on Free Trade were well known (as far as\r\nsubjects could allow themselves to pretend to know their Sovereign's\r\n_private_ opinions) from the hearty support she had given to Sir\r\nRobert Peel's and Lord John's Governments. That upon the first\r\nproposition of a Stanley Government the junction of Parties would\r\nbe completed, and there would be only _one_ strong opposition. After\r\nhaving fought together, there would be no longer any difficulty about\r\nforming a strong Government out of their joint ranks, whilst now it\r\nwas impossible not to see that every Minister displaced would feel\r\npersonally aggrieved, that then they stood on a footing of perfect\r\nequality. Sir James had seen Lord John since he had tendered his\r\nsecond resignation, and found him quite altered; whilst he was\r\nembarrassed and _boutonne_ before, he was open and unreserved now, and\r\nthey could speak on terms of private friendship. Lord Aberdeen would\r\nsave his influence in the House of Lords, which he would probably have\r\nlost if he had joined the Whigs in office; in future all this would be\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell's letter with the Memoranda came and interrupted us.\r\nFrom these papers, and what Sir James and Lord Aberdeen said, it is\r\nclear that all parties are relieved by the failure of their attempt\r\nto form a Coalition Government, but determined to form a positive\r\njunction, which will be most salutary to the country. The Queen will\r\ntherefore send for Lord Stanley.\r\n\r\nWe discussed further the means Lord Stanley would have to form an\r\nAdministration, for which the material was certainly sad. Disraeli's\r\nlast scene in the House of Commons would render the publication of\r\nLord Stanley's letter necessary. Mr Gladstone might possibly join him;\r\nat least no pains would be spared to bring him in. Lord Palmerston\r\nhad often so much secret understanding with Disraeli that he might be\r\ntempted with the bait of keeping the Foreign Office, particularly if\r\npersonally offended.\r\n\r\nWhether the Queen should allow or refuse a Dissolution was debated;\r\nthe latter declared a most heavy responsibility for the Sovereign to\r\nundertake, but a subject upon which the decision should only be taken\r\nat the time, and on a due consideration of the circumstances.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _25th February 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to state that having seen the letter which Lord Stanley\r\naddressed to your Majesty, and feeling himself precluded from entering\r\ninto any details, he announced to the House of Commons that Lord\r\nStanley had in reply to your Majesty's offer declared \"he was not\r\n_then_ prepared to form a Government.\"\r\n\r\nMr Disraeli disputed the accuracy of this statement.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty's word cannot be called in question, but Lord John\r\nRussell now feels it due to his own honour humbly to ask your Majesty\r\nfor a copy of Lord Stanley's letter. He does not propose to read the\r\nletter to the House of Commons, but to refer to it in the statement he\r\nis compelled to make.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell humbly requests that this representation may be\r\nshown to Lord Stanley.

He replied, with a sigh, that he would still\r\ntry and see him; he had thought of the Duke of Wellington taking the\r\nForeign Office _ad interim_, but felt that he could hardly propose\r\nthat, considering the Duke's age and infirmity; he would make an\r\nattempt to see Lord Canning with the Queen's permission, and\r\nthat failing, could only think of Sir Stratford Canning, now at\r\nConstantinople, which the Queen approved.\r\n\r\nHe still hoped he might get Mr Gladstone to take the lead in the House\r\nof Commons, without which assistance he must not conceal that it was\r\nalmost impossible for him to go on. Mr Gladstone was on his way\r\nhome from Paris, and he had written to him to see him as soon as he\r\narrived; till then he could not promise that he would succeed to\r\nform an Administration, and he only undertook it for the good of his\r\ncountry, but was afraid of ruining his reputation.\r\n\r\nTo this I rejoined that who tried to do the best by his country need\r\nnever be afraid for his reputation.\r\n\r\nThe Queen showed Lord Stanley Lord John Russell's letter respecting Mr\r\nDisraeli's denial of the truth of Lord John's statement in the House\r\nof Commons yesterday.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley said it had been a very unfortunate misunderstanding,\r\nthat he had been sorry Lord John and Lord Lansdowne should have felt\r\nit necessary to say that \"he had not _then_ been prepared to form a\r\nGovernment,\" as the knowledge of this fact, as long as there was a\r\nchance of his being called back, could not but act injuriously to him\r\nand dispirit those with whom he acted. He would explain all this on\r\nFriday in the House of Lords, and had no objection to sending Lord\r\nJohn a copy of his letter.\r\n\r\nWe now came to _Measures_. Lord Stanley hopes to obviate the Papal\r\nQuestion by a Parliamentary declaration and the appointment in both\r\nHouses of a Committee to enquire into the position of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church in this country; he would diminish the Income Tax by a\r\nmillion, and exempt temporary incomes; he would allow compounding for\r\nthe Window Tax and levy a moderate duty on corn, which he called a\r\nCountervailing Duty, and tried to defend as good political economy, on\r\nthe authority of Mr M'Culloch's last edition of \"Ricardo.\" (I had some\r\ndiscussion with him, however, on that point.)\r\n\r\nReturning to the offices to be filled, Lord Stanley said he should\r\nhave to propose Mr Disraeli as one of the Secretaries of State. The\r\nQueen interrupted him by saying that she had not a very good opinion\r\nof Mr Disraeli on account of his conduct to poor Sir R. Peel, and what\r\nhad just happened did not tend to diminish that feeling; but that she\r\nfelt so much Lord Stanley's difficulties, that she would not aggravate\r\nthem by passing a sentence of exclusion on him. She must, however,\r\nmake Lord Stanley responsible for his conduct, and should she have\r\ncause to be displeased with him when in office, she would remind Lord\r\nStanley of what now passed. Lord Stanley promised to be responsible,\r\nand excused his friend for his former bitterness by his desire to\r\nestablish his reputation for cleverness and sharpness; nobody had\r\ngained so much by Parliamentary schooling, and he had of late quite\r\nchanged his tone.\r\n\r\nMr Herries would make a good Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nAs to Ireland, he had thought of having a more ostensible\r\nLord-Lieutenant, whilst the business should be done by the Secretary\r\nfor Ireland. He asked the Queen whether the Duke of Cambridge might\r\nbe offered that post, which she took _ad referendum_. The Duke of\r\nNorthumberland, though not of his Party, he should like to offer the\r\nAdmiralty to.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the interview he broached the important question\r\nof Dissolution, and said that a Dissolution would anyhow become\r\nnecessary; that, if it was thought that the Queen would withhold\r\nfrom him the privilege of dissolving, he would not have the slightest\r\nchance in the House of Commons; he would be opposed and beat, and then\r\nhis adversaries would come in and dissolve. He avowed that it could\r\nnot be said that the Queen had refused him the power of dissolving,\r\nbut he required some assurance.\r\n\r\nOn the Queen's objecting to giving him a contingent positive promise,\r\nbut declaring her readiness fairly to discuss the question when the\r\nemergency arose, he contented himself with the permission to deny,\r\nif necessary, that she would _not_ consent to it, putting entire\r\nconfidence in the Queen's intention to deal fairly by him.\r\n\r\nI tried to convince Lord Stanley, and I hope not without effect, of\r\nthe advantage, both to the Queen and Lord Stanley himself, that they\r\nshould not be hampered by a positive engagement on that point, which\r\nmight become very inconvenient if circumstances arose which made a\r\nDissolution dangerous to the country.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th February 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has seen Lord Stanley, who will let Lord John Russell have a\r\ncopy of the letter. He wishes it not to be known or considered that\r\nhe has formally undertaken to form a Government till to-morrow, on\r\naccount of the House of Lords meeting to-day. He feels the difficulty\r\nof his position, and is not sure yet that he will be able to complete\r\na Ministry.

She had forgotten\r\nthe Levee, and was just going to write to him to inform him that she\r\nwished to see him at eleven o'clock to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot but regret that Lord Stanley should think Lord John\r\nRussell's explanation led to a wrong inference; for Lord Stanley\r\nwill himself recollect that he stated his objections to her much more\r\nstrongly in his first interview than he did in writing, and as Lord\r\nStanley so strongly advised the Queen to try if no other arrangement\r\ncould first be come to, she hardly knows how this could otherwise have\r\nbeen expressed than by the words used by Lord Lansdowne and Lord John\r\nRussell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_26th February 1851._\r\n(_Wednesday._)\r\n\r\nLord Stanley came again at eleven. The first part of the audience,\r\nwhich was not long, was occupied by Lord Stanley's trying to explain\r\naway Mr Disraeli's contradiction of Lord John Russell, though he\r\ntermed it \"very unfortunate,\" by saying that he wished Lord John had\r\n_not mentioned_ that _he_ (Lord Stanley) \"was not _then_ prepared\"\r\nto form a Government, for that, though true in fact, he had _not_\r\nabsolutely _refused_, but had only advised me to _try_ and make other\r\narrangements first. I said I thought the distinction \"a very nice\r\none,\" which he admitted. What passed between us on the subject the\r\ncorrespondence between Albert and Lord John will best explain.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley then told us that he had seen the Duke of Northumberland,\r\nwho wished for time to consider; that he was to see Lord Canning again\r\nto-day, but had no hopes of his accepting; and that he found so many\r\npeople out of Town that he must ask for _forty-eight_ hours more\r\nbefore he could give me a positive answer, viz. till Friday. He added\r\nhe \"must not conceal\" from me that he was \"not very sanguine\" of\r\nsuccess; almost all depended on Mr Gladstone, who was expected\r\nto arrive to-day; but that it might _now_ be said (in answer to a\r\nquestion of Albert's \"whether in these days of nice distinctions one\r\n_might_ say that he had _undertaken_ to form a Government\"), that he\r\nhad _attempted_ to _undertake_ to _form a Government_.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD STANLEY RESIGNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Stanley to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _27th February 1851._\r\n(_Four o'clock_ P.M.)\r\n\r\nLord Stanley, with his humble duty, awaits your Majesty's commands at\r\nwhat hour he may be honoured with an audience, to explain the\r\ngrounds on which, with the deepest regret, he feels himself under the\r\nnecessity of resigning the important trust with which your Majesty has\r\nhonoured him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir James Graham._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _27th February 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sanctions Sir James Graham's making any statement to the\r\nHouse of Commons which he thinks necessary, to explain the part which\r\nhe and Lord Aberdeen took in the late Ministerial negotiations, and\r\nindeed hopes that these explanations will be as full as possible\r\non all parts, in order that the country may fully appreciate the\r\ndifficulties of the crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD STANLEY'S REASONS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PAPAL BILL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _27th February 1851._\r\n\r\nLord Stanley arrived at half-past five o'clock. We were struck by the\r\nchange of his countenance, which had lost all the expression of care\r\nand anxiety which had marked it at the previous interviews.\r\n\r\nHe assured the Queen that he had been labouring incessantly since he\r\nhad seen her last, but that he was sorry to say without any success.\r\n\r\nHe had seen Mr Gladstone, who declined joining his Government\r\non account of his previous pledges in Parliament respecting the\r\nCommercial Policy of Sir R. Peel, but evidently also on account of his\r\npeculiar views with respect to the Papal Aggression, which he did not\r\nseem disposed to look upon as in any way objectionable.\r\n\r\nLord Canning had given him some hope at one time, but finally declined\r\nin order not to risk his credit for political consistency.\r\n\r\nMr H. Corry, whose opinions on Free Trade were by no means decided,\r\nand who had only filled a very subordinate situation in Sir R. Peel's\r\nGovernment, he had offered high office, but was refused, Mr Corry\r\nexpressing his fears that the Government had no chance of standing\r\nagainst the opposition it would have to meet in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Northumberland was the only person not properly belonging\r\nto the Protection Party who had accepted office (First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty). At one time Lord Ellenborough had accepted, but having\r\nbeen sent on a mission to Mr Goulburn in order to see whether he\r\ncould convert him, he came home himself converted, and withdrew his\r\nacceptance again.\r\n\r\nIn this situation Lord Stanley called his friends together, and after\r\nsome discussion concurred in their opinion that it was not possible\r\nfor them to form such an Administration as ought to be offered to the\r\nQueen. Lord Stanley then qualified this expression again, and said\r\nthat though he could have offered a very respectable Government if\r\nhe had had a majority in the House of Commons, or the means of\r\nstrengthening himself by an immediate Dissolution, he could not form\r\nsuch a one which could have withstood an adverse majority and such a\r\nformidable array of talent in the Opposition. He therefore returned\r\nthe trust which had been committed to him into the Queen's hands,\r\nexpressing at the same time his deep sense of gratitude for the\r\nkindness with which she had treated him, the support and confidence\r\nshe had given him, sorry only that it should have led to no result.\r\nHe thought, however, that the prolongation of the crisis had not\r\ninconvenienced the public service, as Her Majesty's _present_\r\nGovernment were constitutionally enabled to carry on all necessary\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe Queen rejoined that she was very sorry that this attempt had also\r\nfailed, that she had tried every possible combination, and still was\r\nwithout a Government. Lord Stanley answered as if he considered\r\nit natural that Lord John Russell's Government should now quietly\r\nproceed; but on the Queen's observation, that it was now necessary\r\nthat all Parties should join in the support of some measures at least,\r\nand particularly the Papal Bill, he stated what he was prepared to\r\nsupport, and would have been prepared to propose had he taken office,\r\nviz. a fuller recital in the preamble of the Bill and no penal clause\r\nin the body of it. (The present Bill looked pettish and undignified,\r\nas if framed in anger as a return for the insult, and not a correction\r\nof the state of the law.) He thought the Law very complex and obscure,\r\nand never found it acted upon. He would have proposed therefore that\r\nCommittees of both Houses should enquire into the whole subject; the\r\nstate of the Convents; whether subjects were detained against their\r\nwill; whether people were forced to bequeath their property to the\r\nChurch on the deathbed, etc., etc.; he knew that the Roman Catholic\r\nlaity felt severely the oppression which the Priests exercised over\r\nthem, and would be willing to give evidence.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley asked whether it could be of use if he were to state all\r\nthis in his explanation to-day, which the Queen strongly affirmed. I\r\nadded that I hoped he would explain what he was prepared to do on all\r\nthe subjects in dispute--the Commercial and Financial Policy as well.\r\nHe promised to do so, and entered into his views on the Income Tax,\r\nwhich he called a War Tax, which had been imposed for temporary\r\npurposes only in 1842, and ought to be taken off again when\r\npracticable in order to keep faith with the public; but if, as often\r\nas there was a surplus, this was immediately absorbed by remission of\r\nother burdens, this object could never be fulfilled. He would\r\npropose that by degrees, as surpluses arose, the Income Tax should be\r\ndecreased, and so on to its final repeal.\r\n\r\nI disputed with him for some time on the advantages of an Income Tax,\r\nbut without coming to any result.\r\n\r\nOn his enquiry whether there was anything else the Queen might wish\r\nhim to state--perhaps the rumour that he had been refused the power of\r\ndissolving--we agreed that he should say the question had never been\r\nseriously entertained, but that the Queen had been ready to give him\r\nthe same support and advantages which any other Government might have\r\nenjoyed.[9]\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: The Prince thereupon, at the Queen's request,\r\n    communicated with Lord John Russell, and after recounting\r\n    to him the various successive failures to form a Government,\r\n    wrote that the Queen must \"pause before she again entrusts the\r\n    commission of forming an Administration to anybody, till\r\n    she has been able to see the result of to-morrow evening's\r\n    Debate.\" He added, \"Do you see any Constitutional objection to\r\n    this course?\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prince Albert to the Duke of Wellington._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _28th February 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DUKE,--Lord Stanley has likewise resigned his task, not being\r\nable to gain over any of Sir R. Peel's friends, and being incapable of\r\nforming a Government out of his Party alone.\r\n\r\nSo Lord John Russell has declared his inability to carry on the\r\nGovernment. Lord Stanley has then declared his inability to form one\r\nuntil every other combination should have failed. We have tried\r\nall possible combinations between Whigs and Peelites, and have not\r\nsucceeded, and now Lord Stanley throws up the game a second time!\r\nThe Queen would be happy to consult you and hear your advice in this\r\ndilemma. Possibly to-night's Debate may define the position of Parties\r\nmore clearly, and give a clue to what may be best to be done under the\r\ncircumstances. Ever yours, etc.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _28th February 1851._\r\n\r\nSIR,--The former Cabinet meet at eleven, at Lansdowne House.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the Queen might with advantage see Lord\r\nLansdowne. He was in office with Mr Fox and Lord Grenville in 1806; he\r\nhas been distinguished and respected in political life ever since; he\r\nis now desirous of retiring, and has therefore no personal object to\r\ngain. If the Queen approves, Lord Lansdowne might wait on Her Majesty\r\nsoon after twelve o'clock. I have the honour to be, Sir, your Royal\r\nHighness's very dutiful Servant,\r\n\r\nJ.

The Queen has sent\r\nto the Duke of Wellington in order to hear his opinion also; but he\r\ncannot be here before to-night, being at Strathfieldsaye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, _28th February 1851._\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne, who arrived at twelve o'clock, was asked by the Queen\r\nwhat advice he could offer her in the present complication. His answer\r\nwas: \"I wish indeed I had any good advice to offer to your Majesty.\"\r\nHe expressed his delight at the Queen having sent for the Duke of\r\nWellington. We talked generally of the state of affairs; he agreed in\r\na remark of mine, that I thought the Queen should be entirely\r\nguided in her choice of the person to construct a Government, by the\r\nconsideration which Party would now appear to be the strongest in the\r\nHouse of Commons. On my asking, however, whether he knew if, on the\r\nfailure of Lord Stanley to form a Government, part of his followers\r\nwould now give up Protection as past hope, and be prepared in future\r\nto support the Peelite section of the Conservative Party, Lord\r\nLansdowne said he had heard nothing on the subject, nor could he give\r\nus more information on the chance of the Radicals and Irish members\r\nnow being more willing to support Lord John Russell in future. He\r\nliked Lord Stanley's plan of dealing with the Papal Question, of\r\nwhich the Queen communicated to him the outlines, was afraid of Sir\r\nJ. Graham's excessive leaning towards economy, shook his head at\r\nLord John Russell's letter to the Bishop of Durham[10] which had been\r\ninstrumental in bringing on the present crisis, and confessed that he\r\nhad been amongst those in the Cabinet who had prevented the bringing\r\nforward of a measure of reform in the present Session. He offered to\r\ndo whatever might be most conducive to the Queen's comfort--stay out\r\nof office, or come into office--as might be thought the most useful.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: See _ante_, p. 273 note 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FURTHER DIFFICULTIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st March 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I did not write to you yesterday, thinking I could\r\nperhaps give you some more positive news to-day, but I _cannot_. I am\r\nstill without a Government, and I am still trying to hear and pause\r\nbefore I actually call to Lord John to undertake to form, or rather\r\nmore to continue, the Government. We have passed an anxious, exciting\r\nweek, and the difficulties are very peculiar; there are so many\r\nconflicting circumstances which render coalition between those\r\nwho agree in almost everything, and in particular on _Free Trade_,\r\nimpossible, but the \"Papal Question\" is the real and almost\r\ninsuperable difficulty.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne is waiting to see me, and I must go, and with many\r\nthanks for your two kind letters, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _2nd March 1851._\r\n(_Sunday._)\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne, who arrived after church, had seen Lord John\r\nRussell and discussed with him the Memorandum which we left with him\r\nyesterday. He had since drawn up a Memorandum himself which embodied\r\nhis views, and which he had not yet communicated to any one. He was\r\nvery apprehensive lest to begin a new Government with an open question\r\nwould produce the greatest prejudice against it in the public; he was\r\nstill inclined therefore to recommend the continuance of the present\r\nGovernment avowedly for the purpose of passing the Papal Bill, after\r\nwhich the Coalition might take place, which, however, should be agreed\r\nupon and settled at this time. As the Duke of Wellington has not yet\r\nsent his promised Memorandum, and Lord Lansdowne was anxious to hear\r\nhis opinion, the Queen commissioned him to appoint Lord John Russell\r\nto come at three o'clock, and to go himself to the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, who arrived at the appointed time, and had not seen\r\nLord Lansdowne's Memorandum yet, read it over, and expressed great\r\nmisgivings about the execution of the proposal. He said he saw in\r\nfact, like Sir J. Graham, nothing but difficulties. He had ascertained\r\nthat his Party by no means liked the idea of a fusion, and had been\r\nmuch relieved when the attempt to form a Coalition Ministry had\r\nfailed. He was afraid that in the interval between their resuming\r\noffice and giving it up again every possible surmise would be current\r\nwho were the Ministers to be displaced, and every possible intrigue\r\nwould spring up for and against particular members of the Cabinet. He\r\nwould prefer not to make any arrangements for the Coalition now, but\r\nmerely to engage to resign again after having carried the Papal\r\nBill, when the Queen could try the Coalition, and that failing, could\r\nentrust Lord Aberdeen and Sir J. Graham with the carrying on of the\r\nGovernment, whose chief difficulty would then be removed. I objected\r\nto this--that his Party might feel justly aggrieved if after their\r\nhaving carried him through the difficulty of the Papal Measure, he\r\nwere to throw them over and resign, and asked him whether his Cabinet\r\nwould not repent in the meantime and wish to stay in.\r\n\r\nHe answered that it would be entirely in his and Lord Lansdowne's\r\nhands to carry out the proposed arrangements.\r\n\r\nWe asked him whether it would strengthen his hands if, instead of his\r\nonly _accepting_ the task of continuing the Government till the Papal\r\nMeasure had been passed, the Queen were to make it a _condition_\r\nin _giving_ him the Commission, that it should terminate then. He\r\nreplied, \"Certainly.\" He begged, however, to be understood not to have\r\ngiven a decided opinion that the plan of \"the open Question\" proposed\r\nin our Memorandum was not preferable, although he saw great objections\r\nto that also, particularly as Sir J. Graham had reserved the statement\r\nof his principal objections to the Papal Bill for the second reading.\r\nHe promised to draw up a Memorandum, which he would bring to-morrow\r\nat twelve o'clock, after having consulted some of his colleagues,\r\nand begged that it might not be considered that he had accepted the\r\nGovernment till then.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties which we likewise discussed was the position\r\nof the financial measures which required almost immediate attention,\r\nand still ought to be left open for the consideration of the future\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWe agreed that the pressing on the Papal Measure was the chief point,\r\nand that it ought to be altered to meet the objections (as far as they\r\nare reasonable) of its opponents, strengthening the declaratory part,\r\nhowever, to please Lord Stanley; and the Queen promised to call upon\r\nLord Stanley to give this so modified Bill the support of himself and\r\nhis Party, which we thought she could in fairness claim after all that\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nThe Queen reiterated her objections to Lord Palmerston, and received\r\nthe renewed promise that her wishes should be attended to.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A COALITION IMPOSSIBLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _3rd March 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell arrived at the hour appointed (twelve o'clock), and\r\nwas sorry to inform the Queen that all hope of a Coalition must be\r\ngiven up. He had found that his Party was very much averse to it. On\r\nproposing to his former colleagues the plan of keeping Office now,\r\nand vacating it after the Aggression Bill had passed, many of them,\r\namongst which were Lord Grey, Sir Charles Wood, Sir Francis Baring,\r\ndeclared they would not be _warming-pans_ (an expression used at the\r\ntime of the Grey-Grenville Coalition), and would resign at once. The\r\nDuke of Wellington, whose opinion the Queen had asked, had recommended\r\nthe return of the old Cabinet to power. He (Lord John) could therefore\r\nonly advise that course, although he was conscious that it would be a\r\nvery weak Government, and one not likely to last any length of time.\r\n\r\nHe then read the Memorandum which he had drawn up and which follows\r\nhere.[11]\r\n\r\nThe Queen now asked whether Lord John proposed a modification of\r\nhis own Cabinet, to which Lord John replied, None, except perhaps\r\nan exchange of Office between Sir C. Wood and Sir F. Baring, if Sir\r\nCharles were to refuse bringing in a different budget from the one he\r\nhad already propounded; he was for maintaining the Income Tax, whilst\r\nSir Francis was for repealing it by degrees. The Queen then reminded\r\nLord John of her objections to Lord Palmerston, and his promise\r\nthat Lord Palmerston should not again be thrust upon her as Foreign\r\nSecretary. Lord John admitted to the promise, but said he could not\r\nthink for a moment of resuming office and either expel Lord Palmerston\r\nor quarrel with him. He (Lord John) was in fact the weakness and Lord\r\nPalmerston the strength of the Government from his popularity with the\r\nRadicals.... He said he was very anxious that he and Lord Lansdowne\r\nshould bear the responsibility of removing Lord Palmerston from the\r\nForeign Office and not the Queen; her refusal now could only go to the\r\ncountry as a personal objection on her part, and the country would be\r\nleft without a Government in consequence. On the Queen's reiterating\r\nthat she wanted to keep Lord John and get rid of Lord Palmerston, and\r\nthat it was too painful to her to be put into the situation of having\r\nactually to _wish_ the fall of her own Government, Lord John promised\r\nto move Lord Palmerston in the Easter recess, or to resign then\r\nhimself if he should meet with difficulties; in the meantime he must\r\napprise Lord Palmerston of this intention, which he could explain to\r\nhim as a wish to make a general modification of his Government. He\r\nwould offer him the Lieutenancy of Ireland or the Presidency or lead\r\nin the House of Lords, which Lord Lansdowne would be ready to resign.\r\nHe might at that period perhaps get some of the Radicals into office\r\nor some Peelites. The Queen finally entrusted Lord John with the\r\nGovernment on these conditions.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: _See_ next page.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S ADVICE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ECCLESIASTICAL TITLES BILL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n_3rd March 1851._\r\n\r\nHer Majesty having tried in vain the formation of a Government--first,\r\nby Lord Stanley; second, by Lord John Russell, Lord Aberdeen, and\r\nSir James Graham; third, by Lord Aberdeen; fourth, by Lord Stanley\r\na second time--had recourse to the advice and opinion of the Duke of\r\nWellington. The Duke, admitting the great qualifications for office\r\nof the adherents of the late Sir Robert Peel, yet advises the Queen to\r\nrestore her former Ministers to office.\r\n\r\nBut supposing Her Majesty to follow that advice, a further question\r\nnaturally arises: the late Government having fallen from want of\r\nParliamentary support, can they upon their return be in any way\r\nstrengthened, and be enabled to carry on the public business with more\r\npower and efficiency?\r\n\r\nThis might be done in three ways: first, by a Coalition sooner or\r\nlater with the Peel Party; secondly, by admitting to office some of\r\ntheir own Radical supporters; thirdly, by seeking aid from the Party\r\nwhich has followed Lord Stanley.\r\n\r\nThe first of these courses appears the most natural. The present\r\nMinisters are agreed with the adherents of Sir Robert Peel on Free\r\nTrade, and on the policy which has regulated our finances of late\r\nyears. The difference between them is of a temporary nature. But it\r\nmay be doubted whether any strength would be gained by an immediate\r\njunction with that Party.\r\n\r\nIf such junction took place now, the Ministers coming in must oppose\r\ntheir colleagues on the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill--an unseemly\r\nspectacle, a source of weakness, and probably the beginning of strife,\r\nwhich would not end with the Bill in question.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the junction were delayed till the\r\nEcclesiastical Titles Bill is disposed of, the existing Ministry would\r\nbe divided into two portions, one of which would have only a temporary\r\ntenure of office. Rumours, cabals, and intrigues would have ample room\r\nto spread their mischief in such a state of things.\r\n\r\nBut finally the Whig Party in the House of Commons would not be\r\ncordial supporters of the junction; jealousy and discontent would soon\r\nbreak up the Ministry.\r\n\r\nSecondly, by admitting to office some of their Radical supporters.\r\nThis course must lead to concessions on measures as well as men, and\r\nthose concessions would provoke hostility in other quarters. The great\r\nquestion of the defence of the country is besides one of too great\r\nimportance to be made a matter of compromise.\r\n\r\nThird, by seeking aid from the Party which has followed Lord Stanley.\r\nThis cannot be done by means of official connection; but something\r\nmight be effected by adopting measures calculated to convince the\r\nLanded Interest that their sufferings were not disregarded.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, if the late Ministers are invited by your Majesty to\r\nresume office, the easiest course would be to proceed at once with\r\nthe Ecclesiastical Titles Bill. That question disposed of, it would\r\nbe seen whether the Ministry had sufficient strength to go on; if\r\nthey had, they might, as occasion arose, seek assistance from other\r\nquarters, looking to those with whom there is the greatest agreement\r\nof opinion.\r\n\r\nShould the Ministry, on the other hand, not receive Parliamentary\r\nsupport sufficient to enable them to carry on the Government, the\r\nQueen would be in a position to form a new Government free from the\r\nobstacles which have lately been fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _4th March 1851._\r\n\r\n... The Queen was in hopes to have heard from Lord John Russell this\r\nmorning relative to what passed in the House of Commons last night.\r\nShe wishes likewise to hear what takes place at the meeting of Lord\r\nJohn's supporters to-day. The Queen must ask Lord John to keep her\r\nconstantly informed of what is going on, and of the temper of parties\r\nin and out of Parliament; for no one _can_ deny that the present state\r\nof affairs is most critical; and after all that has happened it\r\nis absolutely necessary that the Queen should not be in a state of\r\nuncertainty, not to say of ignorance, as to what is passing. She can\r\nelse not form a just opinion of the position of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _4th March 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Pray receive my warmest thanks for two kind letters\r\nof the 28th, and my excuses for the terribly incoherent scrawl of last\r\nSaturday. The _denouement_ of ten days of the greatest anxiety and\r\nexcitement I cannot call satisfactory, for it holds out only the\r\nprospect of another crisis in a very short time, and the so much\r\nwished-for union of Parties has been again frustrated. I have been\r\nspeaking _very strongly_ about Lord Palmerston to Lord John, and he\r\nhas _promised_ that if the Government should still be in at Easter,\r\nthen to make a change.... Lord Stanley can never succeed _until_ he\r\ngives up Protection, which he would do, if the country decides against\r\nhim;[12] he has failed solely from the _impossibility_ of finding\r\n_one_ single man capable to take the important Offices. He said last\r\nnight to Lord John Russell, \"I am _l'homme impossible_; they cannot\r\ncome to me again.\" Still it would be very desirable that there\r\nshould be a strong Conservative Party; nothing but the abandonment of\r\nProtection can bring this to pass, and Lord Stanley cannot abandon\r\nit with honour till _after_ the _next Election_. This is the state\r\nof Parties, which is greatly _erschwert_ by the Papal Question, which\r\ndivides the Liberals and Conservatives. In short, there _never_ was\r\n_such_ a _complicated_ and difficult state of affairs. Ever your\r\ndevoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nStockmar has been an immense comfort to us in our trials, and I hope\r\nyou will tell him so.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: The Queen's judgment was amply confirmed by the\r\n    events of 1852.

She is not disposed to trust in the\r\ndisposition of Parliament or the public to give her an equivalent\r\nfor these apartments from time to time when emergencies arise. The\r\nsurrender of Kensington Palace will most likely not be thanked for at\r\nthe moment, and any new demand in consequence of such surrender would\r\nbe met with lavish abuse.

Our\r\nParty is hardly reunited, and any break into sections, following one\r\nman or the other, would be fatal to us. I need not say that the Queen\r\nwould suffer if it were attributed to her desire, and that as I have\r\nno difference of opinion on Foreign Policy, that could not fail to be\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the situation of affairs is most perplexing. A\r\nDissolution I fear would not improve it.\r\n\r\nI can only say that my Office is at all times at the Queen's disposal.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, Sir, your Royal Highness's most dutiful\r\nServant,\r\n\r\nJ.

Therefore what must it have been in the\r\ninside of the building!\r\n\r\nMary and George came away in perfect _enchantment_, and every soul I\r\nhave seen describes it as the fairest sight that ever was seen and the\r\nbest-conducted _fete!_Why, G.

As to Mary, she was in _perfect enchantment_, and\r\nfull of how pretty your dear little Victoria looked, and how nicely\r\nshe was dressed, and so grateful to your Mother for all her kindness\r\nto her. I should have written to you last night, but I thought I would\r\nnot plague you with a letter until to-day, as I think you must have\r\nbeen tired last night with the _excitement_ of the day. I shall ever\r\nlament the having missed such a sight, but I comfort myself in feeling\r\nsure I could not have followed you (as I ought) when you walked round.\r\nTherefore I was _better_ out of the way.

I wish you _could_ have witnessed the _1st May\r\n1851_, the _greatest_ day in our history, the _most beautiful_ and\r\n_imposing_ and _touching_ spectacle ever seen, and the triumph of my\r\nbeloved Albert. Truly it was astonishing, a fairy scene. Many cried,\r\nand all felt touched and impressed with devotional feelings. It was\r\nthe _happiest_, _proudest_ day in my life, and I can think of\r\nnothing else. Albert's dearest name is immortalised with this _great_\r\nconception, _his_ own, and my _own_ dear country _showed_ she was\r\n_worthy_ of it. The triumph is _immense_, for up to the _last hour_\r\nthe difficulties, the opposition, and the ill-natured attempts\r\nto annoy and frighten, of a certain set of fashionables and\r\nProtectionists, were immense; but Albert's temper, patience, firmness,\r\nand energy surmounted all, and the feeling is universal. _You_ will\r\nbe astounded at this great work when you see it!--the beauty of the\r\nbuilding and the vastness of it all. I can never thank God enough.\r\nI feel _so_ happy, so proud. Our dear guests were much pleased and\r\nimpressed. You are right to like the dear Princess, for she is a\r\nnoble-minded, warm-hearted, distinguished person, much attached to\r\nyou, and who revered dearest Louise. Oh! _how_ I thought of _her_ on\r\nthat great day, how kindly she would have rejoiced in our success! Now\r\ngood-bye, dearest Uncle.

We hope that Lord\r\nJohn Russell's little girl is going on quite well.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has had good accounts from the dear Princess of Prussia from\r\nCoblentz. Her letter is full of England, her great happiness here,\r\nand her great sorrow at having left it. The Princes have expressed\r\nthe same, so this dangerous journey has gone off without _one_ single\r\nunpleasant circumstance, which is very gratifying.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Prince Frederic are gone to Berlin, where the statue of\r\nFrederic the Great was to be inaugurated yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _18th June 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the papers signed. We are both much pleased at what\r\nLord John Russell says about the Prince's speech yesterday.[15] It was\r\non so ticklish a subject that one could not feel sure beforehand\r\nhow it might be taken; at the same time the Queen felt sure that the\r\nPrince would say the right thing, from her entire confidence in his\r\ngreat tact and judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, at the risk of not appearing sufficiently modest (and yet,\r\nwhy should a wife ever be modest about her husband's merits?), must\r\nsay that she thinks Lord John Russell will admit now that the Prince\r\nis possessed of very extraordinary powers of mind and heart. She feels\r\nso proud at being his wife that she cannot refrain from herself paying\r\na tribute to his noble character.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: The Prince presided at the meeting commemorative\r\n    of the one hundred and fifty years' existence of the Society\r\n    for the Propagation of the Gospel.

Our only anxiety is lest any accident should have\r\noccurred from the great pressure of the dense crowds.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would likewise wish to know what distinction should be\r\nconferred in honour of the occasion on the Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: A ball in commemoration of the Exhibition took\r\n    place at the Guildhall on the 9th of July.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _15th July 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter.

We argued\r\nin innumerable despatches that the _choice of the successor_ to the\r\nDanish Crown was entirely an internal question for Denmark, in which\r\nforeign Powers could not interfere. Here, however, it is laid down\r\nthat the German Diet has no right to treat the succession in Holstein\r\n(a German State) as an _internal_ question, as it ought to be decided\r\non--not according to the _German law of succession_, but according to\r\nthe interests of Europe. Nor is it true, as stated in the despatch,\r\nthat the Duke of Augustenburg has _no_ claim to the Danish Crown. His\r\nmother was the daughter of Christian VII. and of Queen Matilda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN IN SCOTLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL CASTLE, _16th September 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Accept my best thanks for your kind and dear letter\r\nof the 8th. It is a good thing for Leo to begin to follow in your\r\nfootsteps, but (if I may speak out plainly), I think that anything\r\nlike _fonctions_ and _representation_ is agreeable and _not_ difficult\r\nto Leo. It is the common contact with his fellow-creatures, the being\r\nput on a par with him, the being brought to feel that he is as much\r\n_one_ of them as any other, in spite of his birth, which I think of\r\nsuch great importance for him, and I therefore hope you will send him\r\nto _Bonn_.\r\n\r\nMy letter is terribly _decousu_, for it has been twice interrupted.\r\nI was out the whole day with Albert, in the forest in a perfectly\r\ntropical heat. Since we went to Allt-na-Giuthasach, our little bothy\r\nnear Loch Muich on the 12th, the heat of the sun has been daily\r\nincreasing, and has reached a pitch which makes it almost sickening to\r\nbe out in it, though it is beautiful to behold. The sky these last two\r\nevenings has been like an Italian one, and for the last few days--at\r\nleast the last four--without the slightest particle of cloud, and the\r\nsun blazing. With this, not a breath of air. The mountains look quite\r\ncrimson and lilac, and everything glows with the setting sun.\r\nThe evenings are quite a _relief_. Really one cannot undertake\r\nexpeditions, the heat is so great. We thought of you, and wished you\r\ncould be here; you would fancy yourself in Italy.\r\n\r\nAlbert got a splendid stag to-day. I must hastily conclude, hoping\r\nto hear from you that you _will come_. Our moonlights have been\r\nmagnificent also. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL CASTLE, _22nd September 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I write to you on purpose on this large paper in\r\norder that you may see and admire it. Landseer did it also on purpose,\r\nand I think it is even finer than the other. It is so truly the\r\ncharacter of the noble animal.\r\n\r\nThat abuse of the poor Orleans family in our papers is abominable,\r\nand Lord John is equally shocked at it, but won't interfere. Don't you\r\nthink Joinville should not have left it open for him to accept it, for\r\nit is _impossible_ for _him_ to be _President_ of the French Republic?\r\nStill, I feel convinced that he and they _all_ do what they think best\r\nfor _France_.\r\n\r\nI must conclude.

It was very cold. To-day it pours so that I\r\nhardly know if we shall be able to get out, or home even. We are\r\nnot _snowed_, but _rained up_. Our little Shiel is very snug and\r\ncomfortable, and we have got a little piano in it. Lady Douro is with\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind letter of the 22nd. Our warm, fine weather\r\nleft us on the 25th, and we have had storm and snow in the mountains\r\never since then.\r\n\r\nThe position of Princes is no doubt difficult in these times, but\r\nit would be much less so if they would behave honourably and\r\nstraightforwardly, giving the people gradually those privileges which\r\nwould satisfy all the reasonable and well-intentioned, and would\r\nweaken the power of the Red Republicans; instead of that, _reaction_\r\nand a return to all the tyranny and oppression is the cry and the\r\nprinciple--and all papers and books are being seized and prohibited,\r\nas in the days of Metternich!...\r\n\r\nVicky was kicked off her pony--a quiet beast--but not the least hurt;\r\nthis is more than three weeks ago. Alfred (whom you will recollect\r\nI told you was so terribly heedless and entirely indifferent to all\r\npunishment, etc.) tumbled downstairs last week. He was not seriously\r\nhurt at all, and quite well the next morning, only with a terribly\r\nblack, green, and yellow face and very much swelled. He might have\r\nbeen killed; he is always bent upon self-destruction, and one hardly\r\nknows what to do, for he don't mind being hurt or scolded or punished;\r\nand the very next morning he tried to go down the stairs leaning over\r\nthe banisters just as he had done when he fell.\r\n\r\nAlas! this will be my last letter but one from the dear Highlands. We\r\nstart on the 7th, visiting Liverpool and Manchester on our way back,\r\nand expect to be at Windsor on the 11th.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude.

My heart is _bien gros_ at going from here.\r\n\r\nI love my peaceful, wild Highlands, the glorious scenery, the\r\ndear good people who are much attached to us, and who feel their\r\n_Einsamkeit_ sadly, very much. One of our Gillies, a young Highlander\r\nwho generally went out with me, said, in answer to my observation that\r\nthey must be very dull here when we left: \"It's just like death come\r\nall at once.\" In addition to my sorrow at leaving this dear place,\r\nI am in great sorrow at the loss of a dear and faithful, excellent\r\nfriend, whom you will sincerely lament--our good Lord Liverpool. He\r\nwas well and in the highest spirits with us only six weeks ago, and in\r\nthree days he was carried away. I cannot tell you _how_ it has upset\r\nme; I have known him so long, and he was such an intimate friend of\r\nours. We received the news yesterday.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind letter of the 29th. I am glad all went off\r\nso well, but it must have been dreadful to miss dearest Louise.\r\nThis time reminds me so much of all our sorrow last year on her dear\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _13th October 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns Lord Howden's letter, and thinks that the best\r\nanswer to the Queen of Spain's request will be that the Statutes\r\ndo not allow the Garter to be bestowed upon a lady; that the Queen\r\nherself possesses no order of knighthood from any country.[17]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the claim for the King arising out of the Prince\r\nhaving received the Fleece, it may be well to say that the offer\r\nof the Fleece had in the first instance been declined for fear of\r\nestablishing a ground for the necessity of giving the Garter in\r\nreturn, and was at its second offer accepted by the Prince, together\r\nwith the first orders of almost every country, on the understanding\r\nthat no return would be expected. It would have been impossible to\r\ngive the Garter to every Sovereign, and very difficult to make a\r\nselection. The Queen of Spain ought to be made aware of the fact that\r\namong the reigning Sovereigns, the Emperors of Austria and Brazil,\r\nand the Kings of Sweden, Denmark, Bavaria, Holland, Sardinia, Naples,\r\nGreece, etc., etc., have not got the Garter, although many of them\r\nhave expressed a wish for it, and that amongst the Kings Consort, the\r\nKing of Portugal, the Queen's first cousin, has not received it yet,\r\nalthough the Queen has long been anxious to give it to him.\r\n\r\nAnything short of these explanations might offend, or leave the claim\r\nopen to be repeated from time to time.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The Queen of Spain had expressed a desire\r\n    through Lord Howden to receive the Order of the Garter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: EXTENSION OF THE FRANCHISE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _14th October 1851._\r\n\r\nLord Carlisle, Lord Minto, and Sir Charles Wood are appointed a\r\nCommittee to consider of the extension of the Suffrage.

The effect it will have abroad will do us immense harm.\r\nAt all events, Lord John should take care to have it understood that\r\nthe Government have not sanctioned it, and that it is a private act of\r\nLord Palmerston's.\r\n\r\nThe Queen will else have again to submit to insults and affronts,\r\nwhich are the result of Lord Palmerston's conduct.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Substance of the note to Lord John Russell,\r\n    written down from recollection.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th October 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nis sorry to say he can interfere no further with respect to Lord\r\nPalmerston's reception of Kossuth.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the manner of the reception, however, he will write to\r\nLord Palmerston to desire him to take care that nothing is said which\r\ngoes beyond the strict expression of thanks for the efforts made\r\nby the British Government to procure first the safety, and next the\r\nliberty, of Kossuth.\r\n\r\nAs for the reception, it is to be considered that Kossuth is\r\nconsidered the representative of English institutions against\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\nIf this were so the public feeling would be laudable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _31st October 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he has the\r\nhonour to submit to your Majesty a correspondence[19] which has taken\r\nplace between Lord Palmerston and himself.\r\n\r\nAfter Lord Palmerston's answer, Lord John Russell can have but little\r\nhope that Lord Palmerston will not see M. Kossuth. Lord John Russell\r\ncannot separate the private from the public man in this instance; the\r\nreception of Kossuth, if it takes place, will be a reception by\r\nyour Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Whether that\r\nreception is to take place in Downing Street or Carlton Terrace does\r\nnot appear to him material.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell would, as a last resource, humbly advise your\r\nMajesty to command Lord Palmerston not to receive M. Kossuth.\r\n\r\nIt appears to him that your Majesty owes this mark of respect to\r\nyour Majesty's ally, and generally to all States at peace with this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has no other copy of this letter to Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Lord Palmerston wished to receive Kossuth at the\r\n    Foreign Office. In the correspondence here referred to, which\r\n    will be found in Russell's _Life_, the Premier \"positively\r\n    requested\" Lord Palmerston to decline to receive Kossuth. The\r\n    rejoinder, written while the messenger waited, was: \"There are\r\n    limits to all things. I do not choose to be dictated to as to\r\n    who I may or may not receive in my own house....

She likewise sends him her letter to Lord Palmerston,\r\nwhich she begs him to send on, merely changing the label. She\r\nmust tell Lord John, however, that although _he_ may go on with a\r\n_colleague_, even after having received an answer like the one Lord\r\nPalmerston has returned to the many entreaties not to compromise the\r\nGovernment by his personal act, the Queen cannot expose herself to\r\nhaving her positive commands disobeyed by one of her public servants,\r\nand that should Lord Palmerston persist in his intention he cannot\r\ncontinue as her Minister. She refrains from any expression upon Lord\r\nPalmerston's conduct in this matter, as Lord John is well aware of her\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._[20]\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st October 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen mentioned to Lord Palmerston when he was last here at\r\nWindsor Castle that she thought it would not be advisable that he\r\nshould receive M. Kossuth upon his arrival in England, as being wholly\r\nunnecessary, and likely to be misconstrued abroad. Since M. Kossuth's\r\narrival in this country, and his violent denunciations of two\r\nSovereigns with whom we are at peace, the Queen thinks that she owes\r\nit as a mark of respect to her Allies, and generally to all States at\r\npeace with this country, not to allow that a person endeavouring to\r\nexcite a political agitation in this country against her Allies should\r\nbe received by her Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Whether\r\nsuch a reception should take place at his official or private\r\nresidence can make no difference as to the public nature of the act.\r\nThe Queen must therefore demand that the reception of M. Kossuth by\r\nLord Palmerston should not take place.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Draft sent to Lord John Russell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _31st October 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

She thinks it\r\nnatural that Lord John should wish to bring a matter which may cause\r\na rupture in the Government before the Cabinet, but thinks his having\r\nsummoned the Cabinet only for Monday will leave Lord Palmerston at\r\nliberty in the intermediate time to have his reception of Kossuth, and\r\nthen rest on his _fait accompli_. Unless, therefore, Lord John\r\nRussell can bind him over to good conduct, all the mischief which\r\nis apprehended from this step of his will result; and he will have,\r\nmoreover, the triumph of having carried his point, and having set the\r\nPrime Minister at defiance....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _1st November 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he is\r\ndeeply sensible of your Majesty's kindness and indulgence. He feels\r\nthat he is at times overwhelmed by the importance and variety of the\r\nquestions of which the principal weight lies upon him.\r\n\r\nHe now lays before your Majesty a copy of the letter he has written\r\nto Lord Palmerston.[21] With a grateful sense of your Majesty's\r\nconfidence, he is now of opinion that the Cabinet should decide, and\r\nthat no part of the burden should be placed upon your Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe therefore returns the letter to Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nHe summoned the Cabinet for Monday, as so many members of it are at a\r\ndistance. He does not think Lord Palmerston will come to town before\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: The letter is printed in Lord Palmerston's\r\n    _Life_.

The substance\r\nis quite right, and a dignified explanation of the absurdity of the\r\nconduct of the Parma officials would very likely produce its effect,\r\nbut some expressions in this draft could only tend to irritate, and\r\ntherefore prevent that readiness to comply with our demand, which is\r\nto be produced.[23]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Before ten days had elapsed, Lord Palmerston had\r\n    resumed his high-handed methods.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND PALMERSTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _20th November 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen must write to-day to Lord John Russell on a subject which\r\ncauses her much anxiety. Her feelings have again been deeply wounded\r\nby the official conduct of her Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\r\nsince the arrival of M. Kossuth in this country. The Queen feels the\r\nbest interests of her people, the honour and dignity of her Crown, her\r\npublic and personal obligations towards those Sovereigns with whom\r\nshe _professes_ to be on terms of peace and amity, most unjustifiably\r\nexposed. The Queen has unfortunately very often had to call upon Lord\r\nJohn to check his colleague in the dangerous and unbecoming course\r\nwhich at various times he has so wilfully persevered in pursuing. But\r\nLord John Russell, although agreeing on most of these occasions with\r\nthe view taken by the Queen, has invariably met her remonstrances with\r\nthe plea that to push his interference with Lord Palmerston\r\nbeyond what he had done would lead to a rupture with him, and thus\r\nnecessarily to a breaking up of the Cabinet. The Queen, considering\r\na change of her Government under present political circumstances\r\ndangerous to the true interests of the nation, had only to choose\r\nbetween two evils, without possessing sufficient confidence in her own\r\njudgment to decide which in its political consequences would turn out\r\nthe least. But if in such a contingency the Queen chooses rather not\r\nto insist upon what is due to her, she thinks it indispensable at the\r\nsame time to express to her Cabinet that she does so on their account,\r\nleaving it to them to reconcile the injuries done to her with that\r\nsound policy and conduct which the maintenance of peace and the\r\nwelfare of the country require. These remarks seem to be especially\r\ncalled for after the report of the official interview between Lord\r\nPalmerston and the deputation from Finsbury,[24] and the Queen\r\nrequests Lord John Russell to bring them under the notice of the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: After Kossuth's departure, addresses of thanks\r\n    to Lord Palmerston, for his courteous attentions to Kossuth,\r\n    were voted by ultra-Radical meetings in Finsbury and\r\n    Islington, and he allowed a deputation to present the\r\n    addresses to him at the Foreign Office, the Emperors of\r\n    Austria and Russia being stigmatised therein as \"odious and\r\n    detestable assassins\" and \"merciless tyrants and despots.\"\r\n    Palmerston, who expressed himself as \"extremely flattered and\r\n    highly gratified\" by the references to himself, did not in\r\n    terms reprehend the language used of the two Sovereigns, and\r\n    added, in a phrase immortalised by Leech's cartoon, that\r\n    \"a good deal of judicious bottle-holding was obliged to be\r\n    brought into play.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON'S FOREIGN POLICY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _21st November 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He had the\r\nhonour of receiving last night your Majesty's communication respecting\r\nLord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presumes that it is the substance of this\r\ncommunication which your Majesty wishes to be laid before the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nBut before doing so he cannot refrain from mentioning some\r\ncircumstances which appear to him to weigh materially in the\r\nconsideration of Lord Palmerston's conduct.\r\n\r\nIn many instances Lord Palmerston has yielded to the remonstrances of\r\nLord John Russell, supported as they have been by your Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe did so on the question of furnishing guns to the Sicilians.\r\n\r\nHe did so in respect to the letter to Baron Koller on the affair of\r\nCount Haynau.\r\n\r\nHe gave way likewise in this last instance, when, after assuring Lord\r\nDudley Stuart that he would see Kossuth whenever he chose to call\r\nupon him, he consented to intimate privately to Lord Dudley that he\r\nrequested him not to call.\r\n\r\nThis last concession must have been mortifying to Lord Palmerston,\r\nand he has consoled himself in a manner not very dignified by giving\r\nimportance to the inflated addresses from some meetings in the suburbs\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nBut it appears to Lord John Russell that every Minister must have\r\na certain latitude allowed him which he may use, perhaps with\r\nindiscretion, perhaps with bad taste, but with no consequence of\r\nsufficient importance to deserve notice.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell must, however, call your Majesty's attention to an\r\narticle in the _Morning Post_, which denies the accuracy of the report\r\nof Lord Palmerston's answer to what is there called \"the froth and\r\nfolly of an address to Downing Street.\"\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, in admitting that he has more than once represented\r\nto your Majesty that the expulsion of Lord Palmerston would break up\r\nthe Government, begs to explain that he has always done so upon one of\r\ntwo grounds:\r\n\r\nFirst, if Lord Palmerston should be called upon by your Majesty to\r\nresign on account of a line of Foreign Policy of which his colleagues\r\nhad approved, and for which they were, with him, responsible.\r\n\r\nSecond, in case no difference of opinion had arisen, and the\r\ntransaction should bear the character of an intrigue, to get rid of an\r\ninconvenient colleague.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Lord Palmerston was recommended to the late\r\nKing by Lord Grey as Foreign Secretary, and remained in that Office\r\nfrom 1830 to 1834; that he was afterwards replaced in the same Office\r\nby Lord Melbourne, and remained from 1835 to 1841.\r\n\r\nHe has thus represented the Foreign Policy of the Whig Party fifteen\r\nyears, and has been approved not only by them but by a large portion\r\nof the country. In the advice which Lord John Russell has humbly\r\ntendered to your Majesty, he has always had in view the importance\r\nof maintaining the popular confidence which your Majesty's name\r\neverywhere inspires. Somewhat of the good opinion of the Emperor of\r\nRussia and other foreign Sovereigns may be lost, but the good will and\r\naffection of the people of England are retained, a great security in\r\nthese times.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has made out a note of his address to the Cabinet\r\nfor your Majesty's information. He prays to have it returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _21st November 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter and returns the note\r\non his former communication to the Cabinet. If Lord John felt on the\r\n3rd of November that \"above all, it behoves us to be particularly\r\ncautious and not to afford just ground of complaint to any Party,\r\nand that we cannot be too vigilant or weigh our proceedings too\r\nscrupulously\"--the Queen cannot suppose that Lord John considers the\r\nofficial reception by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\r\nof addresses, in which allied Sovereigns are called Despots and\r\nAssassins, as within that \"latitude\" which he claims for every\r\nminister, \"which he may use perhaps with indiscretion, perhaps with\r\nbad taste, but with no consequence of sufficient importance to deserve\r\nnotice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen leaves it to Lord John Russell whether he will lay her\r\nletter, or only the substance of it, before the Cabinet;[25] but she\r\nhopes that they will make that careful enquiry into the justice of\r\nher complaint which she was sorry to miss altogether in Lord John\r\nRussell's answer. It is no question with the Queen whether she pleases\r\nthe Emperor of Austria or not, but whether she gives him a just ground\r\nof complaint or not. And if she does so, she can never believe that\r\nthis will add to her popularity with her own people. Lord John's\r\nletter must accordingly have disappointed her as containing a mere\r\nattempt at a defence of Lord Palmerston. Lord John sees one cause of\r\nexcuse in Lord Palmerston's natural desire to console himself for the\r\nmortification of having had to decline seeing M. Kossuth; the Queen\r\nhas _every reason to believe_ that he has seen him after all.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: On the 4th of December the matter came before\r\n    the Cabinet. No formal resolution was adopted, but regret was\r\n    expressed at Palmerston's want of caution in not ascertaining\r\n    in advance the tenor of the addresses, and in admitting\r\n    unreliable reporters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF KING OF HANOVER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _21st November 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord Palmerston's letter with the\r\nMemorandum relative to the mourning of her Uncle, the late King of\r\nHanover,[26] and she has to say in reply that she thinks the mourning\r\nought not to be for a Foreign Sovereign but for a Prince of the Blood\r\nRoyal, which was the nearest relation in which he stood to the Throne.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: King Ernest died on the 18th of November, aged\r\n    eighty, and was succeeded by his son, King George V., who\r\n    reigned till 1866, and died in 1878.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of Hanover._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _21st November 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--Your kind letter of the 18th, announcing to me the\r\nmelancholy news of the death of your Father, was given to me yesterday\r\nby Mr Somerset, and I hasten to express to you in both our names our\r\nsincere and heartfelt condolence, and beg you to do so in our names to\r\nour dear Cousin Mary.[27]\r\n\r\nIt must be a consolation to you that the end of the King was peaceful\r\nand so free from pain and suffering. Most truly do I enter into your\r\nfeelings as to the responsible position into which you are now placed,\r\nand my best wishes for your welfare and happiness as well as that of\r\nHanover will ever accompany you. I am happy to hear from Mr Somerset\r\nthat you were well, as well as your dear Mary and dear children.\r\n\r\nAlbert desires me to say everything kind from him to you as well as\r\nto our cousins, and with every possible good wish for your health and\r\nprosperity, believe me always, my dear George, your very affectionate\r\nCousin,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: Princess Mary of Saxe-Altenburg (1818-1907),\r\n    wife of King George V. of Hanover.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCARLTON GARDENS, _22nd November 1851._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty and has\r\ntaken the proper steps according to your Majesty's commands, about\r\nthe mourning for the late King of Hanover; and he would wish to\r\nknow whether it is your Majesty's desire that he should have\r\nletters prepared for your Majesty's signature, announcing to Foreign\r\nSovereigns the decease of the late King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _22nd November 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord Palmerston's letter.\r\n\r\nThe Queen does not think it necessary for her to announce the King of\r\nHanover's death to other Sovereigns, as there is a head of that branch\r\nof her Family who would have to do so. She declared the present King's\r\nmarriage in Council, but she does not think that she announced it.\r\nThis Lord Palmerston would perhaps be able to ascertain at the Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE REFORM QUESTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _3rd December 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of the 30th ult.,\r\nand has carefully considered his Memorandum on the report of\r\nthe Committee of the Cabinet; she now returns Sir Charles Wood's\r\nMemorandum.\r\n\r\nConsidering the question of Reform under its two bearings--on the\r\nFranchise and on the Suffrage--the Queen thinks the proposal of merely\r\nadding neighbouring towns to the small boroughs an improvement on the\r\noriginal plan, which contemplated the taking away of members from some\r\nboroughs, and giving them to others. Thus the animosity may be hoped\r\nto be avoided which an attack upon vested interests could not\r\nhave failed to have produced. Much will depend, however, upon the\r\ncompleteness, fairness, and impartiality with which the selection of\r\nthe towns will be made which are to be admitted into the electoral\r\ndistrict of others. Sir Charles Wood's Memorandum being only a sketch,\r\nthe Queen hopes to see a more complete list, stating the principle\r\nalso upon which the selection is made.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Suffrage, the proposals of the Committee appear\r\nto the Queen to be framed with a due regard to the importance of not\r\ngiving an undue proportion of weight to the Democracy. In the\r\nQueen's opinion, the chief question to consider will be whether the\r\nstrengthening of the Democratic principle will upset the balance of\r\nConstitution, and further weaken the Executive, which is by no means\r\ntoo strong at present. The Queen is well aware of the difficulty of\r\nforming a correct estimate beforehand of the moral effect which such\r\nextensive changes may produce, but thinks that they cannot even be\r\nguessed at before the numerical results are accurately ascertained;\r\nshe hopes therefore that the statistics will be soon in a state to be\r\nlaid before her.\r\n\r\nThe Queen regrets that the idea of reviving the Guilds had to be\r\nabandoned, but can quite understand the difficulty which would have\r\nbeen added to the measure by its being clogged with such an additional\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _2nd December 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Accept my best thanks for your kind letter of the\r\n28th.

Lord Normanby[30] has asked whether he should suspend his\r\ndiplomatic functions; but the Cabinet were unanimously of opinion that\r\nhe should not do so.\r\n\r\nThe result is very uncertain; at present the power is likely to rest\r\nin the Army, to whose memory of victories and defeats the President\r\nhas so strongly appealed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: Lord Normanby, having applied for instructions\r\n    as to his future conduct, was desired to make no change in his\r\n    relations with the French Government, and to abstain from even\r\n    the appearance of interference in her internal affairs. Having\r\n    made a communication to this effect to M. Turgot, the latter\r\n    replied that M.

What do you say to it?\r\n\r\nAs yet one cannot form an opinion, but I am inclined to think that\r\nLouis Bonaparte will succeed. The country is tired and wish quiet, and\r\nif they get it by this _coup d'etat_ they will have no objection, and\r\nlet _le Gouvernement Parlementaire et Constitutionnel_ go to sleep for\r\na while.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the great Continental powers will see a military\r\nGovernment at Paris with pleasure; they go rather far in their hatred\r\nof everything Parliamentary. The President takes a little of Napoleon\r\nalready. I understand that he expressed himself displeased, as if I\r\nhad too much supported the Orleans Family. I render perfect justice to\r\nthe President, that hitherto he has not plagued us; but we have\r\nalso abstained from all interference. I think that Helene has been\r\nimprudent; besides, it is difficult for the poor Family to avoid to\r\nspeak on these subjects or to express themselves with mildness.\r\n\r\nIf something like an Empire establishes itself, perhaps we shall for\r\na time have much to suffer, as the _gloire francaise_ invariably looks\r\nto the old frontiers.

The Queen is very anxious to arrive at a definite\r\nopinion on this subject herself.\r\n\r\nThe Queen sees from the Manchester Speeches that the _Ballot_ is to be\r\nmade the stalking-horse of the Radicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON'S LETTERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marchioness of Normanby to Colonel Phipps._\r\n\r\nPARIS, _7th December 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHARLES,--I have an opportunity of writing to you _not_\r\nthrough the Foreign Office, which I shall take advantage of, as at\r\npresent the Post is not to be trusted, and I am afraid I do not think\r\nthe Office is either.\r\n\r\nPalmerston has taken lately to writing in the most extraordinary\r\nmanner to Normanby.[31] I think he wants to fix a quarrel with him,\r\nwhich you may be sure Normanby will avoid at present, as it would have\r\nthe worst possible effect; but I do not understand it at all, and I\r\nwish you could in any way explain what it means. Palmerston seems very\r\nangry because Normanby does not unqualifyingly approve of this step\r\nhere, and the results; the whole thing is so completely a _coup\r\nd'etat_, and all the proceedings are so contrary to and devoid of law\r\nand justice and security, that even the most violent Tory would be\r\nstaggered by them. (For instance, to-day _all_ the English papers,\r\neven Normanby's, are stopped and prohibited; they will of course\r\nallow Normanby's to come, but it is to be under an envelope), and yet\r\nPalmerston, who quarrels with all Europe about a political adventurer\r\nlike Kossuth, because he was defending the liberties and constitution\r\nof his country, now tries to quarrel with Normanby, and really writes\r\nin the most impertinent manner, because Normanby's despatches are not\r\nsufficiently in praise of Louis Napoleon and his _coup d'etat_. There\r\nmust be some _dessous des cartes_ that we are not aware of. Normanby\r\nhas always said, having been undertaken, the only thing now is to hope\r\nand pray it may be successful; but that is another thing to approving\r\nthe way it was begun, or the way it has been carried out. The\r\nbloodshed has been dreadful and indiscriminate, no quarter was shown,\r\nand when an insurgent took refuge in a house, the soldiers killed\r\nevery one in the house, whether engaged in the _emeute_ or not....\r\nIt is very doubtful whether Normanby will be able to go on with\r\n[Palmerston] if this sort of thing continues, for he talks of \"I hear\r\nthis\" and \"I am told that,\" with reference to Normanby's conduct here,\r\nwhich no man in his position can stand, as, if Palmerston takes the\r\n_on-dits_ of others, and not Normanby's own accounts, there is an end\r\nof confidence; but I must say his last letter appears to me a sort of\r\nexuberance of anger, which spends itself on many subjects rather than\r\nthe one which first caused it, and therefore I suspect he has received\r\nsome rap on the knuckles at home, which he resents here, or on the\r\nfirst person who is not of the same opinion as himself; but it is a\r\ncurious anomaly that he should quarrel with Normanby in support of\r\narbitrary and absolute Government. All is quiet here now, and will, I\r\nhope, continue so till the Elections, when I suppose we may have some\r\nmore _emeutes_....\r\n\r\nThey have been told at the Clubs that they may meet, but they are\r\nnot to talk politics. In short, I do not suppose that despotism ever\r\nreached such a pitch.... You may suppose what the French feel; it\r\nserves them all quite right, but that does not prevent one's feeling\r\nindignant at it. And this is what Palmerston is now supporting without\r\nrestriction. We are entirely without any other news from England\r\nfrom any one. Would you not send me or Normanby a letter through\r\nRothschild? I am rather anxious to know whether this is a general\r\nfeeling in England; it could not be, if they know all that had\r\nhappened here. Mind, I can quite understand the policy of keeping well\r\nwith Louis Napoleon, and Normanby is so, and has never expressed to\r\nany one a hostile opinion except in his despatches and private letters\r\nto Palmerston.... I shall send this by a private hand, not to run the\r\nrisk of its being read. Ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nM.

Much blood has been shed since you wrote....\r\n\r\nWhat you say about arbitrary and military Government in France is very\r\ntrue, and I daresay will do for a time; but I do not know _how_ Louis\r\nNapoleon is to proceed, or how he will get over the anger and enmity\r\nof those he imprisoned. Still, I see that the Legitimists have all\r\ngiven in their adhesion. Every one in France and elsewhere _must wish_\r\norder, and many therefore rally round the President.\r\n\r\nA most extraordinary report was mentioned to me yesterday, which,\r\nhowever, I never could believe, and which is besides _physically\r\nimpossible_, from the illness of the one and the absence of the other,\r\nviz. that Joinville and Aumale had gone or were going to Lille to put\r\nthemselves at the head of the troops,[32] which would be a terrible\r\nand a very unwise thing. It would be very awkward for _you_ too.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude, hoping soon to hear from you.

And yet as the affront has\r\nbeen given in Palmerston's private letters, I feel sure she does not\r\nknow it. You have all probably seen Normanby's public despatches, in\r\nwhich, though as an Englishman he deprecates and deplores the means\r\nemployed and the pledges broken--in short, the unconstitutional\r\nillegality of the whole _coup d'etat_--yet he always says, seeing now\r\nno other refuge from Rouge ascendency, he hopes it may succeed. One\r\nwould have supposed, from the whole tenor of his policy, from his\r\nRadical tendencies, and all that he has been doing lately, that\r\nPalmerston would have been the last person to approve of this _coup\r\nd'etat_. Not a bit! He turns upon Normanby in the most flippant\r\nmanner; almost accuses him of a concealed knowledge of an Orleanist\r\nplot--never whispered here, nor I believe, even imagined by the\r\nGovernment of Paris, who would have been too glad to seize upon it\r\nas an excuse; says he compromises the relations of the country by his\r\nevident disapproval of Louis Napoleon--in short, it is a letter that\r\nMorny might have written, and that it is quite impossible for Normanby\r\nto bear. The curious thing is that it is a letter or rather letters\r\nthat would completely ruin Palmerston with _his_ Party. He treats all\r\nthe acts of the wholesale cruelties of the troops as a joke--in short,\r\nit is the letter of a man half mad, I think, for to quarrel with\r\nNormanby on this subject is cutting his own throat.... He has written\r\nalso to Lord John. Louis Napoleon knows perfectly well that Normanby\r\ncannot approve the means he has taken; he talks to him confidentially,\r\nand treats him as an honest, upright man, and he never showed him\r\nmore attention, or friendship even than last night when we were at the\r\nElysee, though Normanby said not one word in approval....\r\n\r\nThere is another question upon which Normanby has a right to complain,\r\nwhich is, that two days before Palmerston sent his instructions here,\r\nhe expressed to Walewski his complete approval of the step taken by\r\nLouis Napoleon, which was transmitted by Walewski in a despatch to\r\nTurgot, and read by him to many members of the Corps Diplomatique a\r\nday before Normanby heard a word from Palmerston. You will perhaps\r\nthink that there is not enough in all this to authorise the grave step\r\nNormanby has taken, but the whole tone of his letters shows such a\r\nwant of confidence, is so impertinent--talk of \"we hear this,\" and \"we\r\nare told that,\"--bringing a sort of anonymous gossip against a man of\r\nNormanby's character and standing, that respect for himself obliges\r\nNormanby to take it up seriously.... In the meantime our Press in\r\nEngland is, as usual, _too_ violent against Louis Napoleon. _We_\r\nhave no friends or true allies left, thanks to the policy of Lord\r\nPalmerston; as soon as the peace of the country is restored the Army\r\n_must_ be employed; it is the course of a Military Government; as\r\nmuch as an absolute Government is destroyed by the people, and the\r\ndemocracy again, when fallen into anarchy, is followed by Military\r\nGovernment. Louis Napoleon must maintain his position by acts: they\r\nwill find out that Belgium should belong to France, or Alsace, or\r\nAntwerp, or something or other that England will not be able to allow,\r\nand then how are we prepared for the consequences?...\r\n\r\nThe more I think of Palmerston's letters, the less I can understand\r\nthem; every sentence is in direct contradiction to his acts and words.\r\nHe ridicules the idea of the Constitution; turns to scorn the idea of\r\nanything being due to the Members of the Assembly; laughs and jokes at\r\nthe Club being fired into, though the English people in it were\r\nwithin an ace of being murdered by the soldiers; says that Normanby\r\nis pathetic over a broken looking-glass,[34] forgetting that the same\r\nbullet grazed the hand of an Englishman, \"_a Roman citizen!_\" who was\r\nbetween the window and the glass--in short, as I said before, he is\r\nquite incomprehensible, except, as I cannot help thinking, he read the\r\nprivate letter Normanby wrote to the Duke of Bedford upon the Kossuth\r\nbusiness, wishing to take his advice a little upon a grave question,\r\nbut which did not actually interfere with his position here. This\r\nwould account for his extreme irritation....\r\n\r\nAll at present is quiet in Paris. There are Socialist risings in many\r\nparts of the country, but all these will do the President good, and\r\nstrengthen his hands, for even the people who have been treated\r\nwith indignity will pardon him if their chateaux are saved from an\r\ninfuriated and brutal peasantry. The President told Normanby last\r\nnight that the accounts of the cruelties and attacks in parts of\r\nthe country were very serious, but he hoped they would soon be put\r\ndown....\r\n\r\nM.

The\r\npossible opinion of the Cabinet that more experience was required does\r\nnot weigh much with the Queen. From her knowledge of Lord Granville's\r\ncharacter, she is inclined to see no such disadvantage in the\r\ncircumstance that he has not yet had practice in managing Foreign\r\nAffairs, as he will be the more ready to lean upon the advice and\r\njudgment of the Prime Minister where he may have diffidence in his\r\nown, and thereby will add strength to the Cabinet by maintaining unity\r\nin thought and action.

She is\r\nnot the least afraid of Lord Granville's not possessing sufficient\r\npublic confidence for him to undertake the Foreign Affairs. He is very\r\npopular with the House of Lords, with the Free Traders, and the Peace\r\nparty, and all that the Continent knows of him is in his favour; he\r\nhad great success at Paris last summer, and his never having had\r\nan opportunity of damaging his character by having been mixed up in\r\ndiplomatic intrigues is an immense advantage to him in obtaining the\r\nconfidence of those with whom he is to negotiate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND PALMERSTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd December 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I have the greatest pleasure in announcing to you\r\na piece of news which I know will give you as much satisfaction and\r\nrelief as it does to us, and will do to the _whole_ of the world.\r\n_Lord Palmerston_ is _no longer Foreign Secretary_--and Lord Granville\r\nis already named his successor!! He had become of late really quite\r\nreckless, and in spite of the serious admonition and caution he\r\nreceived only on the 29th of November, and again at the beginning\r\nof December, he _tells_ Walewski that _he entirely_ approves Louis\r\nNapoleon's _coup d'etat_, when he had written to Lord Normanby by my\r\nand the Cabinet's desire that he (Lord Normanby) was to continue his\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with the French Government, but to _remain_\r\nperfectly passive and give _no_ opinion. Walewski wrote Palmerston's\r\nopinion (entirely contrary to what the Government had ordered) to M.\r\nTurgot, and when Normanby came with his instructions, Turgot told him\r\nwhat Palmerston had said. Upon this Lord John asked Palmerston to give\r\nan explanation--which, after the delay of a week, he answered in such\r\nan unsatisfactory way that Lord John wrote to him that _he could no\r\nlonger remain Foreign Secretary_, for that perpetual misunderstanding\r\nand breaches of decorum were taking place which endangered the\r\ncountry. Lord Palmerston answered instantly that he would give up the\r\nSeals the moment his successor was named!

Lord Lansdowne, to whom he had first written on the\r\nsubject, had frightened him by answering that it was not possible\r\nto avoid the rupture with Lord Palmerston, but that he thought the\r\nGovernment would after this not be able to go on. When, however, this\r\nquestion was discussed in Cabinet, and Lord John had stated that\r\nhe thought the Office could be well filled, they all agreed in the\r\npropriety of going on. The Members of the Cabinet were so unable to\r\nunderstand Lord Palmerston's motives for his conduct during these last\r\nmonths, that Mr. Fox Maule started an idea which once occurred to Lord\r\nJohn himself (as he said), viz. that he must have had the design\r\nto bring on a rupture! Lord Minto, who was absent from the Cabinet,\r\nexpressed himself in a letter to Lord John very strongly about Lord\r\nPalmerston's _reckless conduct_, which would yet undo the country.\r\n\r\nLord John, after having received the concurrence of the Cabinet on the\r\nquestion of Lord Palmerston's dismissal, stated that Lord Granville\r\nwas the person whom he would like best to see fill his office, and\r\nhe knew this to be the feeling of the Queen also. The Cabinet quite\r\nagreed in Lord Granville's fitness, but Sir George Grey stated it as\r\nhis opinion that it ought first to be offered to Lord Clarendon, who\r\nhas always been pointed out by the public as the proper person to\r\nsucceed Lord Palmerston, and that, if he were passed over, the whole\r\nmatter would have the appearance of a Cabinet intrigue in favour of\r\none colleague against another. The whole of the Cabinet sided with\r\nthis opinion, and Lord John Russell now proposed to the Queen that an\r\noffer should in the first instance be made to Lord Clarendon.\r\n\r\nThe Queen protested against the Cabinet's taking upon itself the\r\nappointment of its own Members, which rested entirely with the\r\nPrime Minister and the Sovereign, under whose approval the former\r\nconstructed his Government.... Lord John replied that he thought Lord\r\nClarendon would not accept the offer, and therefore there would be\r\nlittle danger in satisfying the desires of the Cabinet. He had written\r\nto Lord Clarendon a cautioning letter from Woburn, apprising him of\r\nsome serious crisis, of which he would soon hear, and speaking of his\r\nformer wish to exchange the Lord-Lieutenancy for some other Office.\r\nLord Clarendon at once perceived the drift of the hint, and wrote\r\nto the Duke of Bedford what he said he did not wish to write to his\r\nbrother John, that, if it was that Palmerston was going, and _he_ were\r\nthought of as a successor, nothing would be so disagreeable to him,\r\nas the whole change would be put down as an intrigue of his, whom Lord\r\nPalmerston had always accused of wishing to supplant him; that if,\r\nhowever, the service of the country required it, he had the courage to\r\nface all personal obloquy....\r\n\r\nLord John owned that Sir George Grey's chief desire was to see Lord\r\nClarendon removed from Ireland, having been there so long; the\r\nCabinet would wish to see the Duke of Newcastle join the Government\r\nas Lord-Lieutenant, which he might be induced to do. The Queen having\r\nmentioned Lord Clarendon as most fit to succeed Lord Lansdowne one\r\nday as President of the Council and leader in the House of Lords, Lord\r\nJohn said that Lord Clarendon had particularly begged not to have the\r\nposition offered him, for which he did not feel fit. Lord John would\r\nlike him as Ambassador at Paris, and thought Lord Clarendon would\r\nlike this himself; but it was difficult to know what to do with Lord\r\nNormanby.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the conversation, Lord John congratulated the\r\nQueen upon the change having been accomplished without her personal\r\nintervention, which might have exposed her to the animosity of Lord\r\nPalmerston's admirers, whilst she would have been precluded from\r\nmaking any public defence. I reminded Lord John that, as such was the\r\ndisadvantage of the regal position, it behoved the Queen doubly to\r\nwatch, lest she be put into the same dilemma with a new Minister,\r\nwhose conduct she could not approve of. Lord Clarendon's appointment\r\nwould be doubly galling to Lord Palmerston, whom Lord John might not\r\nwish to irritate further, a consideration which Lord John said he had\r\nalso pressed upon the Cabinet. Upon a remark from Lord John as to Lord\r\nGranville's youth, the Queen replied: \"Lord Canning, whom Lord Stanley\r\nhad intended to make his Foreign Secretary, was not older....\"\r\n\r\nThe conference ended by Lord John's promise to write to Lord Clarendon\r\nas the Queen had desired ... but that he did not wish to make the\r\noffer to Lord Granville till he had Lord Clarendon's answer.\r\nLord Granville had been told not to attend the last Cabinet; Lord\r\nPalmerston had naturally stayed away.\r\n\r\nI went up to Town at half-past seven to the Westminster Play, and took\r\nLord John in my train to Richmond. We had some further conversation in\r\nthe carriage, in which I asked Lord John whether it was true that\r\nLord Palmerston had got us likewise into a quarrel with America by our\r\nships firing at Panama upon an American merchantman; he said neither\r\nhe nor Sir Francis Baring had received any news, but Sir Francis had\r\nbeen quite relieved by Lord Palmerston's quitting, as he could not be\r\nsure a moment that his Fleets were not brought into some scrape!\r\n\r\nOn my expressing my conviction that Lord Palmerston could not be very\r\nformidable to the Government, Lord John said: \"I hope it will not\r\ncome true what Lord Derby (then Lord Stanley) said after the last\r\nMinisterial crisis, when Lord John quizzed him at not having been\r\nable to get a Foreign Secretary--'Next time I shall have Lord\r\nPalmerston.'!\"\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COUNT WALEWSKI]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _23rd December 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

Count Walewski said he had received various assurances of\r\nopinion from Lord Palmerston, which he supposed were adopted by Lord\r\nJohn Russell, and subsisted in force.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell said: \"Not exactly; it is a principle of the English\r\nGovernment not to interfere in any way with the internal affairs\r\nof other countries; whether France chooses to be a Republic or a\r\nMonarchy, provided it be not a Social Republic, we wish to express no\r\nopinion; we are what we call in England a sheet of white paper in this\r\nrespect; all we desire is the happiness and welfare of France.\" Count\r\nWalewski said it was of importance to the stability of the\r\nPresident that he should have a large majority; he would then give a\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell said each nation must suit itself in this respect;\r\nwe have perhaps been in error in thinking our Constitution could\r\nbe generally adopted; some nations it may suit, others may find it\r\nunfitted for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD GRANVILLE APPOINTED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd December 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord John Russell's letters, and is much\r\nrejoiced that this important affair has been finally so satisfactorily\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns Lord Clarendon's letter, which she thinks a very\r\ngood one.[39] The Queen hopes Count Walewski will have been satisfied,\r\nwhich she thinks he ought to be.

For when the revolutionary movements on the Continent\r\nhad laid prostrate almost all its Governments, and England alone\r\ndisplayed that order, vigour, and prosperity which it owes to a\r\nstable, free, and good Government, the Queen, instead of earning the\r\nnatural good results of such a glorious position, viz. consideration,\r\ngoodwill, confidence, and influence abroad, obtained the very reverse,\r\nand had the grief to see her Government and herself treated on many\r\noccasions with neglect, aversion, distrust, and even contumely.\r\n\r\nFrequently, when our Foreign Policy was called in question, it has\r\nbeen said by Lord John and his colleagues that the principles on which\r\nit was conducted were the right ones, and having been approved of\r\nby them, received their support, and that it was only the _personal\r\nmanner_ of Lord Palmerston in conducting the affairs which could be\r\nblamed in tracing the causes which led to the disastrous results the\r\nQueen complains of.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is certainly not disposed to defend the personal manner in\r\nwhich Lord Palmerston has conducted Foreign Affairs, but she cannot\r\nadmit that the errors he committed were merely _faults in form\r\nand method_, that they were no more than acts of \"inconsideration,\r\nindiscretion, or bad taste.\" The Queen considers that she has also to\r\ncomplain of what appeared to her deviations from the principles laid\r\ndown by the Cabinet for his conduct, nay, she sees distinctly in their\r\npractical application a _personal and arbitrary perversion_ of the\r\nvery nature and essence of those principles. She has only to refer\r\nhere to Italy, Spain, Greece, Holstein, France, etc., etc., which\r\nafford ample illustrations of this charge.\r\n\r\nIt was one thing for Lord Palmerston to have attempted such\r\nsubstantial deviations; it will be another for the Cabinet to consider\r\nwhether they had not the power to check him in these attempts.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, however, considering times to have now changed, thinks that\r\nthere is no reason why we should any longer confine ourselves to the\r\nmere assertion of abstract principles, such as \"non-intervention in\r\nthe internal affairs of other countries,\" \"moral support to liberal\r\ninstitutions,\" \"protection to British subjects,\" etc., etc. The moving\r\npowers which were put in operation by the French Revolution of 1848,\r\nand the events consequent on it, are no longer so obscure; they\r\nhave assumed distinct and tangible forms in almost all the countries\r\naffected by them (in France, in Italy, Germany, etc.), and upon the\r\nstate of things now existing, and the experience gained, the Queen\r\nwould hope that our Foreign Policy may be _more specifically defined_,\r\nand that it may be considered how the general principles are to be\r\npractically adapted to our peculiar relations with each Continental\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes therefore that a regular programme embracing these\r\ndifferent relations should be submitted to her, and would suggest\r\nwhether it would not be the best mode if Lord John were to ask Lord\r\nGranville to prepare such a paper and to lay it before her after\r\nhaving revised it.\r\n\r\nThis would then serve as a safe guide for Lord Granville, and enable\r\nthe Queen as well as the Cabinet to see that the Policy, as in future\r\nto be conducted, will be in conformity with the principles laid down\r\nand approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _29th December 1851._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he has\r\nreceived your Majesty's communication of yesterday, and will transmit\r\nit to Lord Granville.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that the traditionary policy of this\r\ncountry is not to bind the Crown and country by engagements, unless\r\nupon special cause shown, arising out of the circumstances of the day.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Treaty of Quadruple Alliance between England,\r\nFrance, Spain, and Portugal was contrary to the general principle of\r\nnon-intervention; so was the interference in Portugal in 1847, but\r\nwere both justified by circumstances.\r\n\r\nThus it is very difficult to lay down any principles from which\r\ndeviations may not frequently be made.\r\n\r\nThe grand rule of doing to others as we wish that they should do unto\r\nus is more applicable than any system of political science. The honour\r\nof England does not consist in defending every English officer or\r\nEnglish subject, right or wrong, but in taking care that she does not\r\ninfringe the rules of justice, and that they are not infringed against\r\nher.[42]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: A summary of Lord Granville's Memorandum in\r\n    reply (which was couched in very general terms) will be found\r\n    in Lord Fitzmaurice's _Life of Earl Granville_, vol. ii. p.\r\n    49.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AFFAIRS IN FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th December 1851._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Most warmly do I thank you for your kind and\r\naffectionate and interesting letter of the 26th, which I received on\r\nSunday. All that you say about Lord Palmerston is but too true.... He\r\n_brouilled_ us and the country with every one; and his very first\r\nact precipitated the unfortunate Spanish marriages which was _le\r\ncommencement de la fin_. It is too grievous to think how much misery\r\nand mischief might have been avoided. However, now he has done with\r\nthe Foreign Office for ever, and \"the veteran statesman,\" as the\r\nnewspapers, to our great amusement and I am sure to _his_ infinite\r\nannoyance, call him, must rest upon his laurels.... I fear much lest\r\nthey should be imprudent at Claremont; the poor Queen hinted to Mamma\r\nthat she hoped you would not become a friend to the President; no\r\ndoubt you can have no sympathies for him, but _just because_ you\r\nare related to the poor Orleanses, you feel that you must be doubly\r\ncautious to do nothing which could provoke the enmity of Louis\r\nNapoleon. I fear that poor Joinville _had_ some _mad_ idea of going to\r\nFrance, which, fortunately, his illness prevented. It would have been\r\nthe height of folly. Their only safe policy is to remain entirely\r\npassive _et de se faire oublier_, which was Nemours' expression to\r\nme two years ago; nothing could be wiser or more prudent than he was\r\nthen--but I don't think they were wise since. _La Candidature_ of\r\nJoinville was in every way unwise, and led Louis Napoleon to take so\r\ndesperate a course. Nemours told me also _last_ year that they were\r\nnot at all against a _fusion_, but that they could not _disposer de la\r\nFrance_, unless called upon to do so by the nation. I wish you would\r\ncaution them to be very circumspect and silent--for all the mistakes\r\nmade by others is in _their_ favour; in fact, no good for them could\r\ncome till Paris is old enough to be his own master--unless indeed\r\nthey all returned under Henri V., but a Regency for Paris would be an\r\nimpossibility....\r\n\r\nWe spent a very happy Christmas, and now wish you a very happy New\r\nYear--for many succeeding years. Also to the children, who I hope were\r\npleased with the prints, etc.\r\n\r\nWe have got young Prince Nicholas of Nassau here, a pretty, clever boy\r\nof nineteen, with a good deal of knowledge, and a great wish to learn\r\nand hear, which is a rare thing for the young Princes, of our day in\r\nparticular. I must stop now, as I fear I have already let my pen\r\nrun on for too long, and must beg to be excused for this voluminous\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nWith Albert's love ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th December 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letters of yesterday. She\r\nquite agrees with him and his colleagues in thinking it of importance\r\nto strengthen the Government, and she is pleased with his proposal to\r\ncommunicate with the Duke of Newcastle as to what assistance he and\r\nhis friends can give to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Queen expects better results from such a negotiation, with an\r\nostensible head of a Party, than from attempts to detach single\r\nindividuals from it, which from a sense of honour they always felt\r\nscruples in agreeing to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE _TE DEUM_ IN PARIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st December 1851._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sees in the papers that there is to be a _Te Deum_ at Paris\r\non the 2nd for the success of the _coup d'etat_, and that the Corps\r\nDiplomatique is to be present. She hopes that Lord Normanby will be\r\ntold not to attend. Besides the impropriety of his taking part in such\r\na ceremony, his doing so would entirely destroy the position of Lord\r\nJohn Russell opposite Lord Palmerston, who might with justice say that\r\nhe merely expressed his personal approval of the _coup d'etat_ before,\r\nbut since, the Queen's Ambassador had been ordered publicly to thank\r\nGod for its success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1852, the Whig Government, impaired in public credit by the\r\nremoval of Lord Palmerston, attempted once more a coalition with the\r\nPeelites, office being offered to Sir James Graham; the overtures\r\nfailed, and soon, after the meeting of Parliament, the ex-Foreign\r\nSecretary, whose version of the cause of his dismissal failed to\r\nsatisfy the House of Commons, succeeded in defeating the Government on\r\ntheir Militia Bill, affairs in France having caused anxiety as to the\r\nnational defences. The Government Bill was for the creation of a local\r\nMilitia, Lord Palmerston preferring the consolidation of the regular\r\nMilitia. A Ministry was formed by Lord Derby (formerly Lord Stanley)\r\nfrom the Protectionist Party, but no definite statement could be\r\nelicited as to their intention, or the reverse, to re-impose a duty on\r\nforeign corn. Mr Disraeli, who became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and\r\nwas the mainspring of the Government policy, showed great dexterity in\r\nhis management of the House of Commons without a majority, and carried\r\na Militia Bill in the teeth of Lord John Russell; but a plan of\r\npartial redistribution failed. The elections held in the summer did\r\nnot materially improve the Ministerial position, and, on the meeting\r\nof Parliament in the autumn, the Fiscal Question had to be squarely\r\nfaced. After much wrangling, Protection was finally abandoned, and the\r\nGovernment saved for the moment, but on their House-tax proposals they\r\nwere defeated, after an impassioned debate, by a coalition of Whigs,\r\nPeelites, and Radicals, from whom Lord Lansdowne and Lord Aberdeen\r\n(and finally the latter alone) were called upon to construct a\r\nstrong representative Government. The Duke of Wellington had died in\r\nSeptember, and his funeral was the signal for an outburst of national\r\nfeeling. During the year the Houses of Parliament designed by Sir\r\nCharles Barry, though not absolutely completed, were formally opened\r\nby the Queen; the new House of Lords had already been in use.\r\n\r\nIn France, the first result of the _coup d'etat_ was Louis Bonaparte's\r\nelection as President for ten years by an immense majority; late\r\nin the year he assumed the Imperial title as Napoleon III., and the\r\nEmpire was formally recognised by the majority of the Powers; the\r\nEmperor designed to add to his prestige by contracting a matrimonial\r\nalliance with Princess Adelaide of Hohenlohe. In the East of Europe a\r\ndispute had commenced between France and Russia about the Holy Places\r\nin Palestine. Simultaneously with the death of the Duke of Wellington,\r\nthe era of European peace was destined to come to an end, and\r\nNicholas, encouraged by the advent to power of Aberdeen (whom he\r\nhad met in 1844, and with whom he had frankly discussed European\r\npolitics), was hoping for the consummation of his scheme for the\r\npartition of Turkey.\r\n\r\nTo Great Britain the year was a memorable one, in consequence of the\r\ngranting of a Constitution to New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n1852\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ENGLAND AND DENMARK]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of Denmark._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _4th January 1852._\r\n\r\nSIR, MY BROTHER,--I received the letter which your Majesty addressed\r\nto me on the 24th of August last, and in which, after referring to the\r\nnecessity for establishing some definite arrangement with regard\r\nto the eventual succession to the Crown of Denmark, your Majesty is\r\npleased to acquaint me that, in your opinion, such an arrangement\r\nmight advantageously be made in favour of your Majesty's cousin, His\r\nHighness the Prince Christian of Gluecksburg,[1] and the issue of his\r\nmarriage with the Princess Louisa of Hesse, in favour of whom the\r\nnearer claimants have renounced their rights and titles.\r\n\r\nI trust I need not assure your Majesty of the sincere friendship which\r\nI entertain for you, and of the deep interest which I feel in the\r\nwelfare of the Danish Monarchy. It was in accordance with those\r\nsentiments that I accepted the office of mediator between your Majesty\r\nand the States of the German Confederation, and it afforded me the\r\nsincerest pleasure to have been thus instrumental in re-establishing\r\nthe relations of peace between your Majesty and those States.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of the eventual succession to both the\r\nDanish and Ducal Crowns, I have to state to your Majesty that although\r\nI declined to take any part in the settlement of that combination,\r\nit will be a source of great satisfaction to me to learn that an\r\narrangement has been definitely determined upon equally satisfactory\r\nto your Majesty and to the Germanic Confederation; and whenever it\r\nshall have been notified to me that such an arrangement has been\r\narrived at, I shall then be ready, in accordance with what was stated\r\nin the Protocol of the 2nd of August 1850, to consider, in concert\r\nwith my Allies, the expediency of giving the sanction of an European\r\nacknowledgment to the arrangement which may thus have been made.\r\n\r\nI avail myself with great pleasure of this opportunity to renew to\r\nyour Majesty the expression of the invariable attachment and high\r\nesteem with which I am, Sir, my Brother, your Majesty's good Sister,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Prince Christian of\r\n    Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg was named successor\r\n    to Frederick VII., King of Denmark by a Treaty signed in\r\n    London on the 8th of May 1852; and by the Danish law of\r\n    succession (of the 31st of July 1853), he ascended the throne\r\n    under the style of Christian IX., on the 15th of November,\r\n    1863.

For a _fusion_, the Queen thinks the Peelites\r\nto be quite ready; then, however, they must be treated as a political\r\nParty, and no _exclusion_ should be pronounced against particular\r\nmembers of it, nor should it be insisted upon that the new Government\r\nand Party is still emphatically the _Whig_ party.\r\n\r\nAn _absorption_ of the most liberal talents amongst the Peelites into\r\nthe Whig Government, the Queen considers unlikely to succeed, and she\r\ncan fully understand that reasons of honour and public and private\r\nengagement must make it difficult to members of a political Party to\r\ngo over to another in order to receive office.\r\n\r\nHaving stated thus much, the Queen gives Lord John full permission to\r\nnegotiate with Sir James Graham.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Lord John Russell having vainly attempted to\r\n    secure the co-operation of the Duke of Newcastle, announced\r\n    the wish of the Cabinet to make overtures to Sir J.

We shall try and keep on the best of terms with the President, who\r\nis extremely sensitive and susceptible, but for whom, I must say, I\r\nhave never had any _personal_ hostility; on the contrary, I thought\r\nthat during 1849 and 1850 we owed him all a good deal, as he certainly\r\nraised the French Government _de la boue_. But I grieve over the\r\ntyranny and oppression practised since the _coup d'etat_, and it makes\r\neverything very uncertain, for though I believe it in every way\r\nhis wish and his policy not to go to war, still, _il peut y etre\r\nentraine_.\r\n\r\nYour position is a peculiarly delicate one, but still, as I again\r\nrepeat, I think there is no reason to be alarmed; particularly, I\r\nwould _never_ show it.\r\n\r\nThe poor Nemours were here from Saturday till yesterday evening with\r\ntheir dear nice boys, and I think it always does them good. They feel\r\nagain as if they were in their own position, and they are diverted\r\nfrom the melancholy reality and the great sameness of their existence\r\nat Claremont. I found him very quiet and really _not_ bitter, and\r\ndisposed to be very prudent,--but seriously alarmed at the possibility\r\nof losing their property, which would be _too_ dreadful and monstrous.\r\nI fear that the candidature and poor Helene's imprudence in talking\r\nare the cause of this cruel persecution. The poor Orleans have really\r\n(and you should write them that) no _truer_ and more faithful friends\r\nthan we are--and it is for this reason that I urge and entreat them to\r\nbe entirely passive; for _their day_ will come, I feel convinced!\r\n\r\nNow good-bye, my dearest, kindest Uncle. Ever your truly devoted\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _27th January 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of yesterday with\r\nthe draft of Bills, and likewise that of to-day enclosing a Memorandum\r\non the probable effects of the proposed Measure.[3] She has perused\r\nthese papers with great attention, but feels that any opinion upon\r\nthe future results of the Measure must rest on surmises; she has that\r\nconfidence, however, in Lord John's experience and judgment in these\r\nmatters, and so strong a conviction that he will have spared no pains\r\nin forming as correct an opinion as may be formed on so problematical\r\na matter, that she is prepared to come to the decision of approving\r\nthe Measure on the strength of Lord John's opinion. She only hopes\r\nthat the future may bear it out, and that the character of the House\r\nof Commons may not be impaired. Should this prove the case, the\r\nextension of the privilege of voting for Members will strengthen\r\nour Institutions. The Queen is glad that the clause abolishing the\r\nnecessity for every Member of the Government to vacate his seat upon\r\nhis appointment[4] should have been maintained. She hopes that the\r\nschedules showing which towns are to be added to existing boroughs\r\nwill be drawn up with the greatest care and impartiality, and will\r\nsoon be submitted to her. The Queen would be glad if the plan once\r\nproposed of giving to the Queen's University in Ireland the vacant\r\nseat for Sudbury were still carried out, as she feels sure that not\r\nonly would it be a great thing for the University and the Colleges,\r\nbut a most useful and influential Irish Member would be gained for the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe Queen takes it for granted that the Bill as approved by her will\r\nbe stood by in Parliament, and that Lord John will not allow himself\r\nto be drawn on to further concessions to Democracy in the course of\r\nthe debate, and that the introduction of the ballot will be vigorously\r\nopposed by the Government.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The Ministerial Reform Bill.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The Act of Settlement excluded (as from the\r\n    accession of the House of Hanover) the Ministers of State from\r\n    the House of Commons; but the 6 Anne, c. 7, modified this, and\r\n    made them re-eligible on appointment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DRAFT OF THE SPEECH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _1st February 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received the draft of the Speech. The passage referring\r\nto the proposed Reform Measure varies so materially from the one\r\nwhich was first submitted to her that she feels that she ought not to\r\nsanction it without having received some explanation of the grounds\r\nwhich have led the Cabinet to recommend it in its altered shape. The\r\nQueen will not object to the mode of filling the Offices still vacant\r\nwhich Lord John Russell proposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: WOMEN AND POLITICS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _3rd February 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--My warmest thanks for your kind little letter of\r\nthe 30th. Matters are very critical and all Van de Weyer has told\r\nus _n'est pas rassurant_. With such an extraordinary man as Louis\r\nNapoleon, one can never be for one instant safe. It makes me very\r\nmelancholy; I love peace and quiet--in fact, I _hate_ politics and\r\nturmoil, and I grieve to think that a spark may plunge us into the\r\nmidst of war. Still I think _that_ may be avoided. Any attempt on\r\nBelgium would be _casus belli for us_; _that_ you may rely upon.\r\nInvasion I am not afraid of, but the spirit of the people here is very\r\ngreat--they are full of defending themselves--and the spirit of the\r\nolden times is in no way quenched.\r\n\r\nIn two hours' time Parliament will be opened, and to-night the\r\nexplanations between Lord John and Lord Palmerston will take place. I\r\nam _very_ curious _how_ they will go off. The curiosity and anxiety to\r\nhear it is very great.\r\n\r\nI never saw Stockmar better, or more active and more sagacious, or\r\nmore kind. To me he is really like a father--only too partial, I\r\nalways think.\r\n\r\nAlbert grows daily fonder and fonder of politics and business, and\r\nis so wonderfully _fit_ for both--such perspicacity and such\r\n_courage_--and I grow daily to dislike them both more and more. We\r\nwomen are not _made_ for governing--and if we are good women, we must\r\n_dislike_ these masculine occupations; but there are times which\r\nforce one to take _interest_ in them _mal gre bon gre_, and _I_ do, of\r\ncourse, _intensely_.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude, to dress for the opening of Parliament\r\n...

Lord\r\nPalmerston made no case, and was not supported by any considerable\r\nparty in the House. His approbation of the President's conduct seemed\r\nto confound the Liberal Party, and he did not attempt to excuse his\r\ndelay in answering Lord John Russell's letter of the 14th.[5]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the debate was desultory and heavy. Mr Disraeli made a\r\nlong speech for the sake of making a speech. Mr Roebuck was bitter\r\nwithout much effect.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the appearance of the House was favourable. Sir\r\nJames Graham says the next fortnight will clear up matters very much.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the House was decidedly pacific.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: See _ante_, p. 341.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _4th February 1852._\r\n\r\nWe have learned with much satisfaction that everything went off so\r\nwell in the House of Commons last night. Lord John Russell's speech\r\nis a most useful one, and he has given a most lucid definition of the\r\nconstitutional position of the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary\r\nopposite to the Crown. Lord Palmerston's speech is a very weak one,\r\nand he in no way makes out a case for himself. This seems to [be] the\r\ngeneral impression.\r\n\r\nThe Houses of Lords and Commons being now almost completed, and the\r\nQueen having entered the House of Lords by the Grand Entrance (which\r\nis magnificent), the Queen thinks this will be the right moment\r\nfor bestowing on Mr Barry the knighthood, as a mark of the Queen's\r\napprobation of his great work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON'S DISCOMFITURE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marquis of Normanby to Colonel Phipps._[6]\r\n\r\nST GEORGE'S HOTEL, _5th February 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHARLES,--Yesterday morning I got a note from John Russell,\r\nsaying that all had gone off so well the night before, and Palmerston\r\nhad been so flat that he thought it better I should not revive the\r\nsubject in the other House, as he had said nothing about me which in\r\nthe least required that I should do so. I yielded, of course, to such\r\nan appeal, though there are several points in his speech on which I\r\ncould have exposed inaccuracies. The fact is, John has never shown any\r\nconsideration for me in the whole of these affairs; but I do not\r\nmean in any way to complain, and am very grateful to him for the very\r\nsuccessful way in which he executed his task on Tuesday. Nothing\r\ncan be more universal than the feeling of the utter discomfiture of\r\nPalmerston.[7] I am convinced that what floored him at starting was\r\nthat letter of the Queen's,[8] because every one felt that such a\r\nletter would never have been written unless every point in it\r\ncould have been proved like a bill of indictment; and then came the\r\nquestion, how could any man, even feeling he deserved it, go on under\r\nsuch a marked want of confidence?...[9]\r\n\r\nAberdeen, whom I saw at Granville's last night, told me that Cardwell\r\nhad said to him, that often as he had felt indignant at the arrogance\r\nof \"that man,\" he really pitied him, so complete was his overthrow.\r\nDisraeli said that he had watched him during Johnny's speech, and\r\ndoubted whether the hanging of the head, etc., was merely acting; but\r\nbefore he had spoken two sentences he saw he was a beaten fox. Many\r\nsaid that the extreme flippancy and insolence of his manner was\r\nmore remarkable than ever, from their being evidently assumed with\r\ndifficulty. I have always thought Palmerston very much overrated as a\r\nspeaker; his great power arose from his not only knowing his subject\r\nbetter than any one else, but being the only man who knew anything\r\nabout it, and using that exclusive knowledge unscrupulously for the\r\npurposes of misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThiers was at Lady Granville's last night, and was enchanted with the\r\nspectacle of the Opening. He said that he had been endeavouring for\r\nthirty years to support the cause of Constitutional Monarchy, as the\r\nbest Government in the world, and there he saw it in perfection, not\r\nonly in its intrinsic attributes, but in the universal respect and\r\nadhesion with which it was received. He said, though he did not\r\nunderstand a word of English, he could have cried at the Queen's voice\r\nin reading the Speech. He is very \"impressionable,\" and I am convinced\r\nat the time he was quite sincere in his appreciation.\r\n\r\nI am vexed at not having been able to say anything publicly about all\r\nthis, as I believe I could have dispelled many misrepresentations; but\r\nit cannot be helped. I have endeavoured throughout not to be selfish,\r\nand I may as well keep up that feeling to the last. Ever, etc.\r\n\r\nNORMANBY.\r\n\r\nI told John Russell last night I regretted that he had vouched for the\r\nintentions of Louis Napoleon. He said he had not done that, but owned\r\nthat he had said more than he ought. \"The fact is, I did not know what\r\nto say next. I stopped as one sometimes does, so I said that; I had\r\nbetter have said something else!\" Candid and characteristic!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Submitted to the Queen by Colonel Phipps.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: It appears from a Memorandum made about this time\r\n    by Prince Albert that when Lord Palmerston's retirement\r\n    became known, the Radical constituency of Marylebone wished to\r\n    present him with an Address of sympathy, and to invite him to\r\n    stand at the next Election, promising him to bring him in.\r\n    Sir Benjamin Hall (one of the Members) told them that they\r\n    had better wait till the explanation in Parliament had taken\r\n    place, for at present they knew nothing about the merits\r\n    of the case. This the Committee which had been organised\r\n    consented to do. After the Debate on the 4th of February, Sir\r\n    Benjamin called upon the Chairman of the Committee to ask him\r\n    whether they would still carry out their intention. \"No,\" said\r\n    the Chairman; \"we have considered the matter: a man who does\r\n    not answer the Queen's letters can receive no Address from\r\n    us.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: See _ante_, p. 264.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: _Cf._ Greville's account in his Journal, 5th\r\n    February 1852. _See_ also p. 368.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Earl Granville._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _10th February 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the enclosed papers.

Bulwer; should he\r\nrefuse, it will be doubly awkward. The Queen finds it difficult to\r\ngive a decided opinion on the subject, as, first, she does not\r\nknow how far the reception of Sir Henry at Rome will overcome the\r\nobjections raised to his reception as Resident at Florence. Secondly,\r\nas she has never been able to understand what is to be obtained by a\r\nmission to Rome, a step liable to much misrepresentation here....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: The Tuscan Government declined to receive Sir H.\r\n    Bulwer, and it was then proposed to send him to Rome instead.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCE AND THE ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _16th February 1852._\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have seen the Duke of Wellington this morning, and have given\r\nhim the Depot plan.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful if your Royal Highness will see him from time to\r\ntime in relation to the Army.

I am glad that you are\r\nsatisfied with Lord Granville's answer. The question shall certainly\r\nbe borne in mind, and you may rely on our doing whatever can be\r\neffected to bring about the desired end. I think Louis Napoleon will\r\nfind his decrees very difficult to carry out. I am very glad to hear\r\nthat you quietly are preparing to strengthen yourself against the\r\npossibility of any attack from France. This will, I think, put Louis\r\nNapoleon on his good behaviour....\r\n\r\nThe extension of the Suffrage[12] was almost unavoidable, and it was\r\nbetter to do it quietly, and not to wait till there was a cry for\r\nit--to which one would have to yield. The deal there is to do, and the\r\nimportance of everything going on at home and abroad, is unexampled\r\nin _my_ recollection and _very_ trying; Albert becomes really a\r\n_terrible_ man of business; I think it takes a little off from the\r\ngentleness of his character, and makes him so preoccupied. I grieve\r\nover all this, as I _cannot_ enjoy these things, _much_ as I interest\r\nmyself in _general_ European politics; but I am every day more\r\nconvinced that _we women_, _if_ we _are_ to be _good_ women,\r\n_feminine_ and _amiable_ and _domestic_, are _not fitted to reign_;\r\nat least it is _contre gre_ that they drive themselves to the _work_\r\nwhich it entails.\r\n\r\nHowever, this cannot now be helped, and it is the duty of every one to\r\nfulfil all that they are called upon to do, in whatever situation they\r\nmay be!\r\n\r\nMme. van de Weyer thinks your children so grown and improved, and\r\nCharlotte as lovely as ever. With Albert's love, ever your devoted\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: See _ante_, pp. 294, 324.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE MILITIA BILL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _20th February 1852._\r\n(9.15 P.M.)\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to report that Lord Palmerston has just carried his Motion\r\nfor leaving out the word \"Local\" in the title of the Bill for the\r\nMilitia.[13]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell then declared that he could no longer take charge of\r\nthe Bill. Lord Palmerston said he was astonished at the Government for\r\ngiving up the Bill for so slight a cause.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell then said that he considered the vote as tantamount\r\nto a resolution of want of confidence, which remark was loudly cheered\r\non the other side.\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin Hall said he wondered the Government did not resign, on\r\nwhich Lord John again explained that when confidence was withdrawn,\r\nthe consequence was obvious.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Events in France had revived anxiety as to the\r\n    national defences, and the Government brought in a Bill for\r\n    raising a local Militia.

He considered it a vote of censure, and an\r\nentirely unprecedented case not to allow a Minister of the Crown even\r\nto lay his measure on the Table of the House; that he had expected to\r\nthe last that the respectable part of the House would see all this,\r\nbut there seemed to have been a pre-arranged determination between\r\nLord Palmerston and the Protectionists to defeat the Government; that\r\nthe Peelites also had agreed to vote against them. Sir James Graham\r\nand Mr Cardwell had stayed away, but Mr Gladstone and Mr S. Herbert\r\nhad voted against them, the latter even misrepresenting what Lord\r\nJohn had said. No Government could stand against incessant motions of\r\ncensure upon every imaginable department of the Executive Government.\r\nThe Prime Minister would either have to take the management of all\r\nthe departments into his own hands, and to be prepared to defend every\r\nitem, for which he (Lord John) did not feel the moral and physical\r\npower, or he must succumb on those different points which the\r\nOpposition with divided labour could single out. Lord Palmerston's\r\nconduct was the more reprehensible as he had asked him the day before\r\nabout his objections to the Bill, and had (he thought) satisfied him\r\nthat the four points upon which he had insisted were provided for in\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: On the Militia Bill.]\r\n\r\nHe thought he could not (in answer to the Queen's enquiry) dissolve\r\nParliament, and that Lord Palmerston had no Party. But he supposed\r\nLord Derby was prepared to form a Protection Government. This\r\nGovernment would pass the estimates and the Mutiny Bill, and would\r\nthen have to proceed to a Dissolution. Lord John had merely seen Lord\r\nLansdowne, who had approved of the course he meant to pursue, though\r\nafraid of the imputation that the Government had run away from the\r\nCaffre debate. He had summoned the Cabinet, and would report their\r\nresolution. Speaking of Lord Palmerston, Lord John said he had heard\r\nthat Lord Palmerston had said that there was one thing between them\r\nwhich he could not forgive, and that was his reading the Queen's\r\nMinute to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past four Lord John came back from the Cabinet, and\r\nformally tendered the resignations of himself and colleagues. The\r\nCabinet had been unanimous that there was no other course to pursue,\r\nand that it would not be advisable to make use of the Queen's\r\npermission to advise a Dissolution. Lord Granville had ascertained\r\nthrough Dr Quin from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Derby was prepared with\r\nan Administration, having obtained Mr Thomas Baring's consent to act\r\nas Leader of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSir Stratford Canning at Constantinople was supposed to be intended\r\nfor the Foreign Office. Lord Lyndhurst said, though the materials were\r\nthere, they were very bad ones, and it was a question whether they\r\nwould stand long. He himself would keep out of place.\r\n\r\nWe advised Lord John to keep his Party well under discipline in\r\nOpposition, so that whilst there it did not commit errors which\r\nwould become new difficulties for the future Government. He seemed\r\ndisinclined for great exertions after the fatigues he had undergone\r\nthese last years. He said he thought he would not go on with the\r\nReform Bill out of office, as that was a measure which ought to be\r\ncarried by a Government. If he had again to propose it, he would very\r\nlikely alter it a little, reverting to his original plan of taking\r\naway one Member of the two returned by small boroughs, and giving\r\ntheir seats to some large towns, counties, and corporations like the\r\nUniversities, etc.\r\n\r\nLord John defers taking his formal leave till a new Administration is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY SUMMONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _21st February 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen would wish to see Lord Derby at half-past two to-morrow\r\nshould he be in Town; if not, on Monday at twelve o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _22nd February 1852._\r\n\r\n... Lord Derby said that he could not command a majority in the House\r\nof Lords, that he was in a decided minority in the House of Commons,\r\nand thought that in the critical circumstances in which the country\r\nwas placed both at home and abroad, he ought not to ask for a\r\nDissolution. He must then try to strengthen himself particularly in\r\nthe House of Commons by any means he could. There was one person whom\r\nhe could not venture to propose for the Foreign Office on account\r\nof what had lately passed, and what he might be allowed to call the\r\n\"well-known personal feelings of the Queen\"; but Lord Palmerston was\r\none of the ablest debaters, and might well be offered the post of\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Queen ... would not, by refusing her consent, throw additional\r\ndifficulties in Lord Derby's way; she warned him, however, of the\r\ndangerous qualities of [Lord Palmerston].\r\n\r\nLord Derby rejoined that he knew them, and thought them pernicious for\r\nthe conduct of the Foreign Affairs, but at the Exchequer they would\r\nhave less play; he himself would undertake to control him. His\r\ngreatest indiscretion--that in the Kossuth affair--must have been with\r\na view to form a Party; that if left excluded from office, he would\r\nbecome more dangerous, and might in fact force himself back at the\r\nhead of a Party with a claim to the Foreign Office, whilst if he had\r\never accepted another Office, his pretensions might be considered\r\nas waived; he (Lord Derby) did not know in the least whether Lord\r\nPalmerston would accept, but in case he did not, the offer would\r\npropitiate him, and render the Government in the House of Commons\r\nmore possible, as it would have anyhow all the talent of the late\r\nGovernment, Peelites and Radicals, to withstand.\r\n\r\nTo my question whether Lord Derby fancied he would remain Prime\r\nMinister any length of time, when once Lord Palmerston had got the\r\nlead of the House of Commons, he replied he was not afraid of him; he\r\nfelt sure he could control him, although he would not have been able\r\nto admit him to the Foreign Office on account of the very strong\r\nstrictures he had passed upon his Foreign Policy at different\r\ntimes--even if the Queen had allowed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _22nd February 1852._\r\n(_Half-past eight._)\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, deems it incumbent upon him to\r\nsubmit to your Majesty without delay that having had an interview this\r\nevening with Lord Palmerston, the latter has, although in the most\r\nfriendly terms, declined accepting the Office, upon the ground of\r\ndifference of opinion, not on the principle, but on the expediency\r\nof the imposition of any duty, under any circumstances, upon foreign\r\ncorn. This was a point which Lord Derby was willing to have left\r\nundecided until the result of a General Election should be known.\r\n\r\nAlthough this refusal may add materially to Lord Derby's difficulties,\r\nhe cannot regret that the offer has been made, as the proposal must\r\nhave tended to diminish any feelings of hostility which might have\r\nbeen productive of future embarrassment to your Majesty's service, to\r\nwhatever hands it may be entrusted....\r\n\r\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant\r\nand Subject,\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S CABINET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _23rd February 1852._\r\n\r\nLord Derby reported progress at half-past two, and submitted a list of\r\nthe principal Officers of the Government which follows, and which the\r\nQueen approved.\r\n\r\nThe Queen allowed Lord Lyndhurst (who has declined office--has been\r\nLord Chancellor three times, and now entered upon his eightieth year)\r\nto be offered an Earldom--which he very much desired for the position\r\nof his daughters, having no son.\r\n\r\nAfter he had kissed hands upon his entering upon his office, Lord\r\nDerby had a further conversation with me on Household appointments. I\r\ntold him he must now, as Prime Minister, consider himself to a certain\r\ndegree in the position of the Confessor; that formerly the Lord\r\nChancellor was Keeper of the King's Conscience, the office might be\r\nconsidered to have descended on the Prime Minister. The Queen must\r\nthen be able to confer with him on personal matters, or I, on her\r\nbehalf, with the most entire confidence, and that she must be sure\r\nthat nothing was divulged which passed between them on these matters,\r\nand he might repose the same confidence in us. As to the formation of\r\nthe Household, the Queen made two conditions, viz. that the persons to\r\ncompose her Court should not be on the verge of bankruptcy, and\r\nthat their moral character should bear investigation. On the Queen's\r\naccession Lord Melbourne had been very careless in his appointments,\r\nand great harm had resulted to the Court therefrom. Since her marriage\r\nI had insisted upon a closer line being drawn, and though Lord\r\nMelbourne had declared \"that that damned morality would undo us all,\"\r\nwe had found great advantage in it and were determined to adhere to\r\nit....\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Duchess of Sutherland._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _23rd February 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST DUCHESS,--I cannot say _how deeply_ grieved I am to\r\nthink that the event which has just occurred, and which Lord Derby's\r\nacceptance of office has to-day confirmed, will entail your leaving,\r\nfor a time, my service. It has been _ever_ a real pleasure to me to\r\nhave you with me; my affection and esteem for you, my dearest Duchess,\r\nare great, and we _both_ know what a kind and true friend we have in\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI think that I may rely on your returning to me on a future occasion\r\nwhenever that may be, and that I shall frequently have the pleasure of\r\nseeing you, even when you are no longer attached to my person.\r\n\r\nI shall hope to see you soon. The Levee remains fixed for Thursday,\r\nand the transfer of the Officers of the new Government does not take\r\nplace till Friday.\r\n\r\nWith the Prince's kindest remembrance, and ours to the Duke and\r\nConstance.

I know that Van de Weyer has informed you\r\nof everything, of the really (till the last day) unexpected defeat,\r\nand of Lord Derby's assumption of office, with a very sorry Cabinet. I\r\nbelieve, however, that it is quite necessary they should have a trial,\r\nand then have done with it. Provided the country remains quiet, and\r\nthey are prudent in their Foreign Policy, I shall take the trial as\r\npatiently as I can....\r\n\r\nAlas! your confidence in our excellent Lord Granville is no longer\r\nof any avail, though I hope ere long he will be at the Foreign Office\r\nagain,[15] and I cannot say that his successor,[16] who has never been\r\nin office (as indeed is the case with almost all the new Ministers),\r\ninspires me with confidence. I see that Louis Napoleon has again\r\nseized one of the adherents, or rathermore one of the men of business,\r\nof the poor Orleans....\r\n\r\nThere are some terrible stories from Madrid of people having told the\r\npoor Queen that the King had arranged this attack on her person, and\r\nthat she was anxious to abdicate.[17] If you should hear anything of\r\nthis kind, be kind enough to tell me of it. With Albert's love (he is\r\nwell fagged with business), ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: Lord Granville held the Foreign Secretaryship in\r\n    1870-1874, and again in 1880-1885.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Lord Malmesbury.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The Queen was stabbed by a priest when returning\r\n    from church.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD MALMESBURY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _24th February 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks that it would be of the highest importance that not\r\nonly Lord Malmesbury (as is always usual) should receive the necessary\r\ninformation from Lord Granville, but that Lord Derby should see him\r\nand hear from him the state of all the critical questions now pending\r\non Foreign Affairs. Lord Granville has made himself master in a very\r\nshort time of all the very intricate subjects with which his\r\nOffice has to deal, and she must here bear testimony to the extreme\r\ndiscretion, good sense, and calmness with which he has conducted the\r\nvery responsible and difficult post of Foreign Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: NEW APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _25th February 1852._ (_5_ P.M.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have delayed longer than I could have wished acknowledging the\r\nletter which I had the honour to receive from your Royal Highness last\r\nnight, in hopes that by this time I should have been enabled to solve\r\nthe difficulties connected with the Household Appointments; but I\r\nregret to say they are rather increased than otherwise. I will not\r\ntrouble your Royal Highness now with any details; but if I might be\r\nhonoured with an audience at any hour after the Levee to-morrow, I\r\nshall perhaps be able to make a more satisfactory report, and at all\r\nevents to explain the state of affairs more fully.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it may save Her Majesty some trouble if I request\r\nthat your Royal Highness will have the goodness to lay before Her\r\nMajesty the enclosed list of Appointments which, subject to Her\r\nMajesty's approval, I have arranged in the course of this day. The\r\nAdmiralty List found its way most improperly into some of the morning\r\npapers before I was even aware that the Duke of Northumberland had\r\nfinally obtained the assent of the Officers whom he had selected.\r\n\r\nAs it is possible that the Queen may not be acquainted with the name\r\nof Colonel Dunne, I have the honour of enclosing a letter respecting\r\nhim which I have received from Lord Fitzroy Somerset, since I had\r\nintimated to him my intention of submitting his name to Her Majesty,\r\nand which is highly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI must beg your Royal Highness to offer to the Queen my most humble\r\nand grateful acknowledgment of the kindness which Her Majesty has\r\nevinced in endeavouring to facilitate the progress of the Household\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, Sir, Your Royal Highness's most obedient\r\nServant,\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LOUIS NAPOLEON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._[18]\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, _26th February 1852._\r\n\r\nLord Derby came to Albert at half-past three, and Albert called me in\r\nat a little after four....\r\n\r\nLord Derby told us he meant to proceed as speedily as possible\r\nwith the defences of the country, and that his plan for the Militia\r\nentirely coincided with Albert's plan (viz. he (Albert) wrote on the\r\nsubject to the Duke of Wellington, who _did not_ like it),[19] and\r\nmeant to try and avoid all the objections. On his observing that\r\nno one had entirely understood the Government Bill, I said that the\r\nGovernment had not even been allowed to bring it in, which was a most\r\nunfair proceeding; upon which Lord Derby reiterated his professions\r\nof this being no preconcerted plan of his Party's, but that it was\r\n\"symptomatic\"; he, however, was obliged to own that it was rather hard\r\nand not quite fair on the late Government.\r\n\r\nI then explained to him the arrangement respecting the drafts from the\r\nForeign Office going first to him before they came to me, and wished\r\nthis should be continued, which he promised should be done, as well as\r\nthat all important Colonial despatches should be sent to me. Touched\r\nupon the various critical questions on the Continent.... Lord Derby\r\nsaid that all Louis Napoleon's views were contained in his book _Idees\r\nNapoleoniennes_ written in '39, for that he was more a man of \"_Idees\r\nfixes_\" than any one; and in this book he spoke of gaining territory\r\nby _diplomacy_ and not by war. Lord Derby gave us a note from Louis\r\nNapoleon to Lord Malmesbury, congratulating him on his appointment,\r\nprofessing the most friendly and pacific intentions, and hoping the\r\nCowleys would (as they do) remain at Paris.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Extract from Her Majesty's _Journal_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: This Memorandum is given in chap. xlv. of the\r\n    _Life of the Prince Consort_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FAREWELL AUDIENCES]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S PROGRAMME]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY AND THE CHURCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _27th February 1852._\r\n\r\nTo-day the formal change of Government took place. The old Ministers\r\nwho had Seals to give up assembled at half-past eleven, and had their\r\nAudiences in the following order:\r\n\r\n_Sir George Grey_ was very much overcome; promised at our request to\r\ndo what he could to keep his friends moderate and united. Spoke well\r\nof his successor, Mr Walpole, and assured the Queen that he left the\r\ncountry in a most quiet and contented state.\r\n\r\n_Lord Grey_ was sorry that the resignation had taken place before the\r\nCaffre Debate, in which he had hoped to make a triumphant defence; he\r\nwas sure it must have come to this from the way in which Lord John had\r\nmanaged matters. He had never had his measures thoroughly considered\r\nwhen he brought them forward. He (Lord Grey) had had to remonstrate\r\nvery strongly about this Militia Bill, which had not even been laid,\r\nprinted, before the Cabinet, and had not been discussed at all;\r\nhe himself had objected to the greater part of it, and had always\r\nexpected to have an opportunity of making his opinion heard; instead\r\nof spending Christmas at Woburn he ought to have digested his\r\nmeasures; this was not fair to his colleagues, and he could never have\r\nthe same confidence in Lord John as before. We urged him to forget\r\nwhat had passed and to do the best for the future; that it was\r\nimportant the Party should be kept together and should unite if\r\npossible with the Peelites, so that the Queen might hope to get a\r\nstrong Government. Lord Grey thought there was little chance of this.\r\nThe next Government could never be as moderate again as this had been;\r\nthis he had always dreaded, and was the reason why he lamented that\r\nLord John had failed in his negotiation with the Peelites this winter,\r\nupon Lord Palmerston's dismissal; but the fact was Lord John had never\r\nwished it to succeed, and it had been unfair that he had not stated\r\nto them (the Peelites) that all his colleagues were ready to give up\r\ntheir places.\r\n\r\n_Lord Granville_ had seen Lord Malmesbury several times, who appeared\r\nto him to take pains about informing himself on the state of Foreign\r\nAffairs, but seemed inclined to be ambitious of acquiring the merit of\r\nbeing exclusively _English_ in his policy; this was quite right, but\r\nmight be carried too far; however, Lord Malmesbury was cautious and\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\n_The Chancellor of the Exchequer_ (_Sir Charles Wood_) was not\r\nsurprised at the fate of the Government, although they had not\r\nexpected to be defeated on the Militia Bill; in fact, a division had\r\nhardly been looked for, as Lord John had talked the day before with\r\nLord Palmerston, and satisfied him that all his objections should be\r\nprovided against in the Bill. He thought it was better, however, that\r\nthe Caffre Debate had not been waited for, which must have been a\r\npersonal and very acrimonious one. He thought Lord Grey had not been\r\nvery discreet in his language to the Queen on Lord John. Sir J. Graham\r\nhad been in a difficulty with his own Party, and therefore had not\r\nwished to encourage Lord John's negotiation with the Peelites. He\r\npromised that, for his part, he would do all he could to keep his\r\nParty from doing anything violent, but that he was afraid many others\r\nwould be so, and that he and Lord Grey had in vain tried to persuade\r\nMr Cobden to remain quiet.\r\n\r\nLord Derby had then an Audience to explain what should be done at the\r\nCouncil. He regretted the Duchess of Northumberland's declining to\r\nbe Mistress of the Robes, on account of ill-health, which had been\r\ncommunicated to the Queen by her father, Lord Westminster. He proposed\r\nthe Duchess of Argyll, whom the Queen allowed to be sounded (though\r\nfeeling certain, that, considering the Liberal views of her husband,\r\nshe will not accept it), and sanctioned his sounding also the Duchess\r\nof Athole, whom the Queen wished to make the offer to, in case the\r\nDuchess of Argyll declined. Lord Derby stated the difficulty he was\r\nin with Sir A. B., whose wife had never been received at Court or\r\nin society, although she had run away with him when he was still at\r\nschool, and was nearly seventy years old. The Queen said it would\r\nnot do to receive her now at Court, although society might do in that\r\nrespect what it pleased; it was a principle at Court not to receive\r\nladies whose characters are under a stigma.\r\n\r\nWe now proceeded to the Council, which was attended only by three\r\nCouncillors, the other seventeen having all had to be sworn in as\r\nPrivy Councillors first.[20]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: _See_ Disraeli's _Endymion_ (chap. c.) for a\r\n    graphic description of this remarkable scene.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Council Lord Hardinge was called to the Queen, and explained\r\nthat he accepted the Ordnance only on the condition that he was not\r\nto be expected to give a vote which would reverse the policy of Sir\r\nR. Peel, to which he had hitherto adhered. He had thought it his duty,\r\nhowever, not to refuse his services to the Crown after the many marks\r\nof favour he had received from the Queen.\r\n\r\nLord Derby then had an Audience to explain what he intended to state\r\nin Parliament this evening as the programme of his Ministerial Policy.\r\nIt was very fluent and very able, but so completely the same as the\r\nSpeech which he has since delivered, that I must refer to its account\r\nin the reports. When he came to the passage regarding the Church,\r\nthe Queen expressed to him her sense of the importance not to have\r\n_Puseyites_ or _Romanisers_ recommended for appointments in the Church\r\nas bishops or clergymen. Lord Derby declared himself as decidedly\r\nhostile to the Puseyite tendency, and ready to watch over the\r\nProtestant character of the Church. He said he did not pretend to give\r\na decided opinion on so difficult and delicate a point, but it had\r\nstruck him that although nobody could think in earnest of reviving the\r\nold Convocation, yet the disputes in the Church perhaps could be most\r\nreadily settled by some Assembly representing the laity as well as\r\nthe clergy. I expressed it as my opinion that some such plan would\r\nsucceed, provided the Church Constitution was built up from the\r\nbottom, giving the Vestries a legislative character in the parishes\r\nleading up to Diocesan Assemblies, and finally to a general one.\r\n\r\nOn Education he spoke very liberally, but seemed inclined to support\r\nthe views of the bishops against the so-called \"management clauses\"\r\nof the Privy Council, viz. not to allow grants to schools even if\r\nthe parish should prefer the bishops' inspection to the Privy Council\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _27th February 1852._\r\n(_Half-past seven_ P.M.)\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, hastens to acquaint your Majesty,\r\nhaving just returned from the House of Lords, that his statement,\r\ngoing over the topics the substance of which he had the honour of\r\nsubmitting to your Majesty was, as far as he could judge, favourably\r\nreceived. Earl Grey attempted to provoke a Corn Law discussion, but\r\nthe feeling of the House was against the premature introduction of so\r\ncomplicated and exciting a topic. Lord Aberdeen, dissenting from any\r\nalteration of commercial policy, entirely concurred in Lord Derby's\r\nviews of Foreign Affairs, and of the course to be adopted in dealing\r\nwith Foreign Nations. Lord Derby did not omit to lay stress upon\r\n\"the strict adherence, in letter and in spirit, to the obligations of\r\nTreaties,\" which was well received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _5th March 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I have to offer my affectionate thanks for a\r\nmost gracious and long letter of the 2nd.\r\n\r\nWithin these days we have not had anything very important, but,\r\ngenerally speaking, there has been, at least in appearance, a quieter\r\ndisposition in the ruling power at Paris.

On the other hand, Austria\r\nbehaves with a hostility, and I must say folly, which prevents all\r\nattempts at reconciliation.

Colonel\r\nPhipps considers \"Punch\" a much more amusing performance. Lady Mount\r\nEdgecumbe, who was in a box there, would probably give your Majesty an\r\naccount of it....\r\n\r\n_The report in London is_, that Lord John Russell is to recommend\r\nmoderation at the meeting at his house to-morrow. He has, very\r\nfoolishly, subjected himself to another rebuff from Lord Palmerston\r\nby inviting him to attend that meeting, which Lord Palmerston has\r\nperemptorily refused. Since that, however, Lady Palmerston has\r\ncalled upon Lady John with a view to a _personal_--not\r\npolitical--reconciliation. Lady Palmerston, as Colonel Phipps hears,\r\nstill persists in the unfounded accusation against Lord John of having\r\nquoted your Majesty's Minute in the House of Commons without giving\r\nLord Palmerston notice of his intention.[22]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: Palmerston, however, admitted the contrary\r\n    (_Life of the Prince Consort_, vol. ii. chap. xliv.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEMOCRACY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _12th March 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I have to thank you for a most kind letter from\r\npeaceful Osborne, which must doubly appear so to you now, after all\r\nthe troubles of the recent Ministerial arrangements. I am glad that\r\nyou are struck with the good qualities of your new Premier. I am\r\nsure his great wish will be to make the best possible Minister of the\r\nCrown. His task will be very difficult. \"Bread, cheap bread,\" \"the\r\npoor oppressed by the _aristocratie_,\" etc.--a whole vocabulary of\r\nexciting words of that kind will be put forward to inflame the popular\r\nmind; and of all the Sovereigns, the Sovereign \"People\" is certainly\r\none of the most fanciful and fickle. Our neighbour in France shows\r\nthis more than any other on the whole globe; the Nation there is\r\n_still_ the _Sovereign_, and this renders the President absolute,\r\nbecause he is the representative of the supreme will of the _supreme\r\nNation_, sending us constantly some new exiles here, which is very\r\nunpleasant. We are going on very gently, merely putting those means of\r\ndefence a little in order, which ought by rights always to be so, if\r\nit was not for the ultra-unwise economy of Parliaments and Chambers.\r\nWithout, at least, comparative security by means of well-regulated\r\nmeasures of defence, no country, be it great or small, can be\r\nconsidered as possessing National Independence. I must say that in\r\nAustria, at least Schwartzenberg, they are very much intoxicated. I\r\nhope they will grow sober again soon. It was very kind of you to\r\nhave visited the poor Orleans Family. Rarely one has seen a family so\r\nstruck in their affections, fortunes, happiness; and it is a sad case.\r\nThose unfortunate Spanish marriages have much contributed to it;\r\neven angelic Louise had been caught by _l'honneur de la maison de\r\nBourbon_....

The Queen will therefore\r\nsanction the measure as proposed, and now further explained by Lord\r\nDerby.\r\n\r\nThe despatches transmitted from the Foreign Office referring to\r\nthe Swiss question[23] could not fail to give the Queen as much\r\nsatisfaction as they did to Lord Derby, as they show indications of\r\na more conciliatory intention, _for the present_ at least. As\r\nSwitzerland has yielded, France and Austria ought to be satisfied, and\r\nthe Queen only hopes we may not see them pushing their demands further\r\nafter a short interval!\r\n\r\nThe probability of a war with the Burmese is a sad prospect. The\r\nQueen thinks, however, that the view taken by Lord Dalhousie of the\r\nproceedings at Rangoon, and of the steps now to be taken to preserve\r\npeace, is very judicious, and fully concurs with the letter sent\r\nout by the Secret Committee. She now returns it, together with the\r\ndespatch.\r\n\r\nThe despatches from Prince Schwartzenberg to Count Buol are\r\nsatisfactory in one sense, as showing a readiness to return to the\r\nEnglish Alliance, but unfortunately only under the supposition that\r\nwe would make war upon liberty together; they exhibit a profound\r\nignorance of this country.[24] The Queen is quite sure that Lord\r\nDerby will know how to accept all that is favourable in the Austrian\r\novertures without letting it be supposed that we could for a moment\r\nthink of joining in the policy pursued at this moment by the great\r\nContinental Powers. As Lord Derby's speech has been referred to by\r\nPrince Schwartzenberg, it would furnish the best text for the answer.\r\nThe President seems really to have been seriously ill.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: The French had been pressing the Swiss\r\n    Government to expel refugees, and Austria supported the French\r\n    President.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Lord Derby had urged that a more conciliatory\r\n    message should accompany Lord Granville's last despatch,\r\n    which, because of its unfriendly tone, Count Buol had delayed\r\n    sending on to Vienna. The precise language (he said) must\r\n    depend on what information Count Buol could supply.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _14th March 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received this morning Lord Derby's letter respecting the\r\nSt Albans' Disfranchisement Bill, and is glad to hear that Lord Derby\r\nmeans to take up this Bill as dropped by the late Government. Whether\r\nthe mode of transferring these seats proposed by Lord Derby will meet\r\nwith as little opposition in Parliament as he anticipates, the Queen\r\nis not able to form a correct judgment of. It may be liable to\r\nthe imputation of being intended to add to the power of the landed\r\ninterest. This might not be at all objectionable in itself, but it may\r\nbe doubtful how far the House of Commons may be disposed to concur in\r\nit at the present moment. This will be for Lord Derby to consider, but\r\nthe Queen will not withhold her sanction from the measure.\r\n\r\nShe knows that Lord John Russell meant to give the vacant seats\r\nto Birkenhead. Are not there two seats still vacant from the\r\nDisfranchisement of Sudbury? and would it not be better (if so) to\r\ndispose of all four at the same time? There is an impression also\r\ngaining ground that, with a view to prevent the Franchise being given\r\nexclusively to _Numbers_, to the detriment of _Interests_, it might be\r\ndesirable to give new seats to certain corporate bodies, such as the\r\nScotch Universities, the Temple and Lincoln's Inn, the East India\r\nCompany, etc., etc.[25]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: The Government eventually proposed that the four\r\n    seats taken from St Albans and Sudbury should be assigned to\r\n    South Lancashire and the West Riding; but, on the ground that\r\n    a Ministry on sufferance should confine itself to necessary\r\n    legislation, Mr Gladstone induced the House by a great\r\n    majority to shelve the proposal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR DISRAELI]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE OPPOSITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _15th March 1852._\r\n(_Monday night._)\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his humble duty to your Majesty,\r\ninforms your Majesty of what occurred in the House of Commons this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nMr Villiers opened the proceedings, terse and elaborate, but not in\r\nhis happiest style. He called upon the House to contrast the state of\r\nthe country at the beginning of the year and at the present moment.\r\nBut he could not induce the House to believe that \"all now was\r\ndistrust and alarm.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, in reply, declined to bring forward\r\nin the present Parliament any proposition to change our commercial\r\nsystem, and would not pledge himself to propose in a future Parliament\r\nany duty on corn. He said a duty on corn was a measure, not a\r\nprinciple, and that if preferable measures for the redress of\r\nagricultural grievances than a five-shilling duty on corn (mentioned\r\nby Mr Villiers) could be devised, he should adopt them--a declaration\r\nreceived with universal favour on the Government side.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell replied to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in\r\nconsequence of some notice by the former of the strange construction\r\nof a new Opposition to force a Dissolution of Parliament by a Minister\r\nwho, three weeks ago, had declared such Dissolution inexpedient. It\r\nwas not a successful speech.\r\n\r\nThe great speech on the Opposition side was that of Sir James Graham:\r\nelaborate, malignant, mischievous. His position was this: that Lord\r\nDerby, as a man of honour, was bound to propose taxes on food, and\r\nthat if he did so, revolution was inevitable.\r\n\r\nMr Gladstone and Lord Palmerston both spoke in the same vein,\r\nthe necessity of immediate Dissolution after the passing of\r\nthe \"necessary\" measures; but the question soon arose, What is\r\n\"necessary\"?\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston thought the Militia Bill \"necessary,\" upon which the\r\nLeague[26] immediately rose and denied that conclusion.\r\n\r\nThere seemed in the House a great reluctance to avoid a violent\r\ncourse, but a very general wish, on the Opposition side, for as speedy\r\na Dissolution as public necessity would permit.\r\n\r\nThe evening, however, was not disadvantageous to the Government.

We tried to\r\nimpress Lord Derby with the necessity of this course, and I hoped we\r\nhad succeeded, but his speech has not been what it ought to have been\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\nThe President seems more occupied at home than abroad, which I trust\r\nhe may remain.\r\n\r\nStockmar is well.... _One_ thing is pretty _certain_--that _out_ of\r\nthe _present state_ of confusion and discordance, a _sound state_ of\r\n_Parties_ will be obtained, and _two Parties_, as of old, will again\r\nexist, without which it is _impossible_ to have a _strong_ Government.\r\n_How_ these Parties will be formed it is impossible to say at present.\r\nNow, with Albert's love, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: This uncertainty led to the Anti-Corn-Law\r\n    League, which had been dissolved in 1846, being revived.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _19th March 1852._\r\n(_Friday night, twelve o'clock._)\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his humble duty to your Majesty,\r\nlays before your Majesty what has taken place in the House of Commons\r\nto-night.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of public business, Lord John Russell, in a very\r\nfull House, after some hostile comments, enquired of Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters whether they were prepared to declare that Her Majesty will\r\nbe advised to dissolve the present Parliament, and call a new one,\r\nwith the least possible delay consistent with a due regard to the\r\npublic interest, in reference to measures of _urgent_ and _immediate_\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nThe question was recommended by Lord John Russell as one similar to\r\nthat put to him in 1841 by Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer in reply observed that there was a\r\ndistinction between the position of the present Ministry and that\r\nof Lord John Russell in 1841, as in that and in the other precedents\r\nquoted in 1841 by Sir Robert Peel, the Ministry had been condemned by\r\na vote of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHe said it was not constitutional and most impolitic for any Ministers\r\nto pledge themselves to recommend their Sovereign to dissolve\r\nParliament at any stated and specific time, as circumstances might\r\noccur which would render the fulfilment of the pledge injurious or\r\nimpracticable; that it was the intention of the Ministers to recommend\r\nyour Majesty to dissolve the present Parliament the moment that such\r\nmeasures were carried which were necessary for your Majesty's service,\r\nand for the security _and good government_ of your Majesty's realm;\r\nand that it was their wish and intention that the new Parliament\r\nshould meet to decide upon the question of confidence in the\r\nAdministration, and on the measures, which they could then bring\r\nforward in the course of the present year.\r\n\r\nThis announcement was very favourably received.\r\n\r\nThe discomfiture of the Opposition is complete, and no further mention\r\nof stopping or limiting supplies will be heard of.\r\n\r\nAll which is most humbly submitted to your Majesty by your Majesty's\r\nmost dutiful Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nB.

He told the Queen that he thought he might state\r\nthat the Government had gained a good deal of ground during the\r\nlast week, and that there was now a general disposition to let the\r\nnecessary measures pass Parliament, and to have the dissolution the\r\nend of June or beginning of July. He hoped the Queen did not think\r\nhe had gone too far in pledging the Crown to a Dissolution about that\r\ntime; but it was impossible to avoid saying as much as that a new\r\nParliament would meet in the autumn again, and have settled the\r\ncommercial policy before Christmas.\r\n\r\nTo the Queen's questions, whether there would not be great excitement\r\nin the country produced by the General Election, and whether\r\nParliament ought not to meet immediately after it, he replied that he\r\nwas not the least afraid of much excitement, and that there was\r\ngreat advantage in not meeting Parliament immediately again, as the\r\nGovernment would require a few months to prepare its measures, and to\r\ntake a sound view of the new position of affairs. He anticipated that\r\nthere would be returned a large proportion of Conservatives, some Free\r\nTraders, some Protectionists; but not a majority for the re-imposition\r\nof a duty on corn, _certainly_ not a majority large enough to justify\r\nhim in proposing such a Measure. Now he was sure he could not with\r\nhonour or credit abandon that Measure unless the country had given its\r\ndecision against it; but then he would have most carefully to consider\r\nhow to revise the general state of taxation, so as to give that relief\r\nto the agricultural interest which it had a right to demand.\r\n\r\nHe had received the most encouraging and flattering letters from the\r\nagriculturists of different parts of the country, all reposing the\r\nmost explicit confidence in him, and asking him not to sacrifice the\r\nGovernment for the sake of an immediate return to Protection. They\r\nfelt what Lord Derby must say he felt himself, that, after the fall of\r\nthis Government, there would necessarily come one of a more democratic\r\ntendency than any the country had yet had to submit to. He thought\r\nmost politicians saw this, and would rally round a Conservative\r\nstandard; he knew that even many of the leading Whigs were very much\r\ndissatisfied with the company they find themselves thrown into and\r\nalarmed at the progress of Democracy.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _23rd March 1852._\r\n\r\n... Here matters have improved rather for the Government, and it seems\r\nnow that they will be able to get through the Session, to dissolve\r\nParliament at the end of June or beginning of July, and to meet again\r\nin November. And then Protection will be done away with. If only they\r\nhad not done so much harm, and played with it for six long years! What\r\nyou say of the advantage of having had Governments from all parties\r\nwe have often felt and do feel; it renders changes much less\r\ndisagreeable. In the present case our acquaintance is confined almost\r\nentirely to Lord Derby, but then _he is_ the Government. They do\r\n_nothing_ without him.

But France, as\r\nthe champion of Italian liberty and independence, would become most\r\nformidable to the rest of Europe, and Louis Napoleon, in assuming for\r\nher this position, would be only following the example of his uncle,\r\nwhich we know to be his constant aim.[30]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: British Envoy at Turin.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: Premier of Sardinia.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: Lord Derby in reply, after reviewing the whole\r\n    matter, counselled non-interference, the keeping of a vigilant\r\n    watch on French and Austrian actions, encouragement of\r\n    Sardinia in her constitutional action, and the making use of\r\n    any opportunity to secure both the independence of Piedmont\r\n    and the reform of the Papal Administration.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[FRANCE AND ITALY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _13th April 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Derby's letter of the 11th inst., in which\r\nhe states very clearly the difficulties which stand in the way of an\r\nactive interference of this country in the affairs of Italy. The Queen\r\ndid not mean to recommend in her letter of the 10th on this subject\r\nany active interference, as she is of opinion that our present want\r\nof due influence in Italy is chiefly owing to our former ill-judged\r\nover-activity. The Queen agrees therefore entirely with Lord Derby\r\nin thinking that \"all that can be done now is carefully to watch the\r\nproceedings of France and Austria in this matter, so as to profit by\r\nevery good opportunity to protect the independence of Piedmont, and,\r\nif possible, produce some improvement in the internal Government of\r\nRome,\" and she would accordingly like to see her respective Foreign\r\nMinisters instructed in this sense.\r\n\r\nThe Queen continues, however, to look with apprehension to the\r\npossible turn which the affairs of Italy may take, proceeding from the\r\npolitical views of the President. It is not improbable that he may act\r\nnow that he is omnipotent upon the views contained in his celebrated\r\nletter to Edgar Ney in 1849, which were at the time disapproved by\r\nthe Assembly.[31] He will feel the necessity of doing something to\r\ncompensate the French for what they have lost by him at home, to\r\nturn their attention from home affairs to those abroad, and to the\r\nacquisition of power and influence in Europe; and certainly, were he\r\nto head Italian liberty and independence, his power of doing mischief\r\nwould be immense. After all, such an attempt would not be more\r\ninconsistent for him than it was for General Cavaignac, as President\r\nof the _Republique Democratique_, to get rid of the Roman Republic,\r\nand to reinstate the Pope by force of arms.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes Lord Derby to communicate this letter to Lord\r\nMalmesbury, from whom she has also just heard upon this subject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: In this letter the President of the Republic had\r\n    expressed his admiration at the conduct of the French troops\r\n    in the Roman expedition under General Oudinot, and his warm\r\n    approval of the policy that led to the campaign.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _19th April 1852._\r\n(_Monday night, half-past twelve._)\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his humble duty to your Majesty,\r\nreports to your Majesty that, after a dull debate, significant only\r\nby two of the subordinate Members of the late Administration declaring\r\ntheir hostility to the Militia Bill, Lord John Russell rose at eleven\r\no'clock and announced his determination to oppose the second\r\nreading of it.[32] His speech was one of his ablest--statesmanlike,\r\nargumentative, terse, and playful; and the effect he produced was\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty's Government, about to attempt to reply to it, gave way\r\nto Lord Palmerston, who changed the feeling of the House, and indeed\r\nentirely carried it away in a speech of extraordinary vigour and\r\nhigh-spirited tone.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers were willing to have taken the division on his Lordship\r\nsitting down, but as the late Government wished to reply, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer would not oppose the adjournment of the\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\nThe elements of calculation as to the division are very complicated,\r\nbut the Chancellor of the Exchequer is still inclined to believe that\r\nthe second reading of the Bill will be carried.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: This tactical blunder, much condemned at the\r\n    time, estranged many of the Whigs from Lord John.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BUDGET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th April 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes to remind Lord Derby that the time for the\r\npresentation of the Budget to the House of Commons being very close\r\nat hand, none of the Measures referring to the finances of the country\r\nwhich the Government may have to propose have as yet been laid before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _26th April 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Derby's explanation of his views with\r\nregard to the Budget,[33] and will be glad to see him on Wednesday at\r\nthree o'clock.

It is evident\r\nthat the President is meeting with the first symptoms of a reviving\r\npublic feeling in France; whether this will drive him to hurry on the\r\nEmpire remains to be seen.

The Queen hails Lord\r\nDerby's declaration of his conviction that a majority for a duty on\r\ncorn will not be returned to the new Parliament, as the first step\r\ntowards the abandonment of hostility to the Free Trade on which\r\nour commercial policy is now established, and which has produced so\r\nflourishing a condition of the finances of the country.\r\n\r\nMr Disraeli's speech about Spain was very good, though he had\r\ncertainly better not have alluded to Portugal.\r\n\r\nWe return to Town to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _21st June 1852._\r\n(_Nine o'clock._)\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his humble duty to your Majesty,\r\nreports to your Majesty that Lord John Russell introduced to the\r\nnotice of the House of Commons to-night the recent Minute of the\r\nCommittee of Council on Education.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell made a languid statement to a rather full House.

Mr Gladstone gave only a very guarded\r\napproval to the Minute, which he treated as insignificant.\r\n\r\nIt was not a happy effort, and the debate, for a while revived by his\r\ninterposition, continued to languish until this hour (nine o'clock),\r\nwith successive relays of mediocrity, until it yielded its last gasp\r\nin the arms of Mr Slaney.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the House of Commons, probably in this representing\r\nfaithfully that of the country, is against both the violent parties in\r\nthe Church, and in favour of a firm, though temperate, course on the\r\npart of the Crown, which may conciliate a vast majority, and tend to\r\nterminate dissension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISTURBANCES AT STOCKPORT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Mr Walpole._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st July 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is much distressed at the account she has read in the papers\r\nof the dreadful riot at Stockport,[36] alas! caused by that most\r\nbaneful of all Party feelings, _religious_ hatred,[37] and she is very\r\nanxious to know what Mr Walpole has heard.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: The Church question was brought into the\r\n    political arena in the General Election, which was now in\r\n    progress; much violence was manifested during the contest.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: \"It is additional proof, if more were wanting,\"\r\n    wrote Mr Walpole in reply, \"that all Parties should forbear as\r\n    much as possible from the ostentatious parade of anything that\r\n    can provoke either the one or the other.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _23rd July 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--...

At the same time, the Queen would have\r\nno objection to bestow it on Lord Lonsdale, if this is desirable, in\r\norder to facilitate any Ministerial arrangements which Lord Derby may\r\nhave in contemplation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN INHERITS A FORTUNE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _10th September 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... That Mr Neild[39] should have left that\r\ngreat fortune to you delighted me; it gives the possibility of forming\r\na private fortune for the Royal Family, the necessity of which nobody\r\ncan deny.

As there were no known\r\n    relatives, the Queen felt able to accept this legacy; but she\r\n    first increased the legacies to the executors from L100 to\r\n    L1000 each, made provision for Mr Neild's servants and others\r\n    who had claims on him, restored the chancel of North Marston\r\n    Church, Bucks, where he was buried, and inserted a window\r\n    there to his memory.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF DUKE OF WELLINGTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _17th September 1852._\r\n\r\nThe death of the Duke of Wellington[40] has deprived the Country of\r\nher greatest man, the Crown of its most valuable servant and adviser,\r\nthe Army of its main strength and support. We received the sad news\r\non an expedition from Allt-na-Giuthasach to the Dhu Loch (one of\r\nthe wildest and loneliest spots of the Highlands) at four o'clock\r\nyesterday afternoon. We hurried home to Allt-na-Giuthasach, and to-day\r\nhere, where it became important to settle with Lord Derby the mode of\r\nproviding for the command of the Army, and the filling up of the many\r\nposts and places which the Duke had held.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: The Duke passed away at Walmer on the 14th of\r\n    September, in his eighty-fourth year.]\r\n\r\nI had privately prepared a list of the mode in which this should be\r\ndone, and discussed it with Victoria, and found, to both Lord Derby's\r\nand our astonishment, that it tallied in _every_ point with the\r\nrecommendations which he had thought of making.\r\n\r\nI explained to Lord Derby the grounds upon which I thought it better\r\nnot to assume the Command myself, and told him of the old Duke's\r\nproposal, two years ago, to prepare the way to my assuming the Command\r\nby the appointment of a Chief of the Staff, on Sir Willoughby Gordon's\r\ndeath, and the reasons on which I then declined the offer. Lord Derby\r\nentirely concurred in my views, and seemed relieved by my explanation;\r\nwe then agreed that for the loss of _authority_ which we had lost with\r\nthe Duke, we could only make up by increase in _efficiency_ in the\r\nappointments to the different offices. That Lord Hardinge was the only\r\nman fit to command the Army.\r\n\r\nHe should then receive the Command-in-Chief. The Ordnance which\r\nhe would vacate should be given to Lord Fitzroy Somerset,\r\nhitherto Military Secretary (with the offer of a peerage).[41] The\r\nConstableship of the Tower to Lord Combermere; the Garter to Lord\r\nLondonderry; the Grenadier Guards and the Rifle Brigade to me; the\r\nFusiliers vacated by me to the Duke of Cambridge (or the Coldstream,\r\nLord Strafford exchanging to the Fusiliers); the 60th Rifles vacated\r\nby me to Lord Beresford; the Rangership of the Parks in London to\r\nGeorge (Duke of Cambridge); the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports to Lord\r\nDalhousie; the Lieutenancy of Hampshire to Lord Winchester. I reserved\r\nto me the right of considering whether I should not assume the command\r\nof the Brigade of Guards which the Duke of York held in George IV.'s\r\ntime, to which William IV. appointed himself, and which has been\r\nvacant ever since Victoria's accession, although inherent to the\r\nConstitution of the Guards.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: He became Lord Raglan.]\r\n\r\nLord Derby had thought of George for the Command-in-Chief, as an\r\nalternative for Lord Hardinge, but perceived that his rank as\r\na Major-General and youth would hardly entitle him to such an\r\nadvancement. He would have carried no weight with the public, and we\r\nmust not conceal from ourselves that many attacks on the Army which\r\nhave been sleeping on account of the Duke will now be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nVictoria wishes the Army to mourn for the Duke as long as for a member\r\nof the Royal Family.\r\n\r\nLord Derby proposes a public funeral, which cannot take place,\r\nhowever, before the meeting of Parliament in November. He is to find\r\nout how this is to be accomplished on account of the long interval.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence here following[42] shows what doubts exist as to\r\nthe person in whom the Command of the Army is vested in case of a\r\nvacancy. I consider Lord Palmerston's letter as a mere attempt\r\nto arrogate supreme power for his Office,[43] which rests on no\r\nfoundation. The Secretary at War has no authority whatever except over\r\nmoney, whilst the Commander-in-Chief has no authority to spend a penny\r\nwithout the Secretary at War.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: These letters, which are of no special\r\n    importance, contained a statement from Lord Palmerston to the\r\n    effect that the appointment to the Commandership-in-Chief was\r\n    vested in the Secretary at War.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: Lord Palmerston had held the office of Secretary\r\n    at War from 1809 to 1828.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _17th September 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I am sure you will mourn _with us_ over the loss we\r\nand this whole nation have experienced in the death of the _dear_ and\r\ngreat old Duke of Wellington. The sad news will have reached you, I\r\ndoubt not, on Wednesday or yesterday. We had gone on Wednesday, as I\r\nhad mentioned, to our little Shiel of Allt-na-Giuthasach to spend\r\ntwo days there, and were enjoying ourselves very much on a beautiful\r\nexpedition yesterday, and were sitting by the side of the Dhu Loch,\r\none of the severest, wildest spots imaginable, when one of our\r\nHighlanders arrived bringing a letter from Lord Derby (who is here),\r\nconfirming the report which we had already heard of--but entirely\r\ndisbelieved--and sending me a letter from Lord Charles Wellesley,\r\nsaying that his dear father had only been ill a few hours, and had\r\nhardly suffered at all. It was a stroke, which was succeeded rapidly\r\nby others, and carried him off without any return of consciousness.\r\nFor _him_ it is a blessing that he should have been taken away in\r\nthe possession of his great and powerful mind and without a lingering\r\nillness. But for this country, and for us, his loss--though it could\r\nnot have been long delayed--is irreparable! He was the pride and the\r\n_bon genie_, as it were, of this country! He was the GREATEST man this\r\ncountry ever produced, and the most _devoted_ and _loyal_ subject, and\r\nthe staunchest supporter the Crown ever had. He was to us a true, kind\r\nfriend and most valuable adviser. To think that all this is gone; that\r\nthis great and immortal man belongs now to History and no longer to\r\nthe present, is a truth which we cannot realise. We shall soon stand\r\nsadly alone; Aberdeen is almost the only personal friend of that kind\r\nwe have left. Melbourne, Peel, Liverpool--and now the Duke--_all_\r\ngone!\r\n\r\nYou will kindly feel for and with us, dearest Uncle.\r\n\r\nLord Hardinge is to be Commander-in-Chief, and he is quite the _only_\r\nman _fit_ for it.\r\n\r\nAlbert is much grieved. The dear Duke showed him great confidence and\r\nkindness. He was so fond of his little godson Arthur--who will now be\r\na remaining link of the dear old Duke's, and a pleasant recollection\r\nof him. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _17th September 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--You will be much grieved at the loss of the\r\nDuke. It must give you satisfaction to think that you were always kind\r\nto him, and that he was very sincerely devoted to you and appreciated\r\nAlbert. Since 1814 I had known much of the Duke; his _kindness_ to\r\nme had been very _marked_, and I early discovered that he was very\r\nfavourable to my marriage with Charlotte, then already in agitation.\r\nSince, he was _always kind_ and _confidential_, even in those days of\r\npersecution against me, the result of the jealousy of George IV.; he\r\nnever was influenced by it, or had the meanness of many who, in the\r\ndays of misfortune, quickly leave one. The only case in which we were\r\nat variance was about the boundaries of Greece. He had some of the old\r\nabsolute notions, which in that case were not in conformity with the\r\nreal interests of England and of Europe. Even last year he spoke so\r\nvery kindly to me on the subject of our Continental affairs. Rarely\r\nfickle Fortune permits a poor mortal to reach the conclusion of a long\r\ncareer, however glorious, with such complete success, so undisturbed\r\nby physical or moral causes. The Duke is the noblest example of what\r\nan Englishman may be, and to what greatness he may rise in following\r\nthat honourable and straight line.\r\n\r\nWhen one looks at the Manchester school, compared to the greatness to\r\nwhich men like the Duke raised their country, one cannot help to\r\nbe alarmed for the future. You are enjoying the Highlands, but the\r\nweather seems also not very favourable; here it is uncertain, and at\r\ntimes very cold.... Your truly devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prince Albert to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _22nd September 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD DERBY,--The Queen wishes me to answer your kind letter of\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nHer letter to you and to Mr Walpole of this morning will have apprised\r\nyou that she sanctions the Guard of Honour having been placed at\r\nWalmer, and the Duke's body having been taken possession of formally\r\non the part of the Crown.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great pity if Lord Fitzroy were to be obliged to\r\ndecline the Peerage on account of poverty; at the same time it may be\r\ndifficult to relieve him from the payment of fees by a public grant.\r\nUnder these circumstances, rather than leave Lord Fitzroy unrewarded,\r\nand a chance of his feeling mortified at a moment when his cheerful\r\nco-operation with Lord Hardinge is so important to the public\r\nservice--the Queen would _herself_ bear the expense of the fees. If\r\nthis were to hurt Lord Fitzroy's feelings, you could easily manage it\r\nso that he need never know from what source the L500 came. The Queen\r\nleaves this matter in your hands. Ever yours truly,\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Mr Walpole._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL CASTLE, _22nd September 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Mr Walpole's letter of the 20th, informing\r\nher of the difficulty of having the Funeral Service, _according_ to\r\nthe _Liturgy_, performed _twice_; she trusts, however, that means\r\nmay be found to enable the Queen's intentions to be carried out, as\r\ncommunicated to Mr Walpole in Lord Derby's official letter. Whether\r\nthis is to be done by leaving the body for two months without the\r\nFuneral Service being read over it, or by reading the Funeral Service\r\nnow in the presence of the family, and treating the _Public Funeral_\r\nmore as a translation of the remains to their final place of rest,\r\nthe Queen must leave to be decided by those who have the means of\r\npersonally sounding the feelings of the Duke's family, the dignitaries\r\nof the Church, and the public generally.\r\n\r\nAn impressive religious ceremony might certainly be made of it at St.\r\nPaul's, even if the actual Funeral Service should not be read on the\r\noccasion....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd October 1852._\r\n\r\nShortly after the formation of Lord Derby's Government, the Queen\r\ncommunicated to him a Memorandum respecting the necessity of attending\r\nto our national defences on a systematic plan. The Queen would now\r\nwish to hear how far we have advanced in this important object\r\nsince that time. Lord Derby would perhaps call on the General\r\nCommanding-in-Chief, the Master-General of the Ordnance, and the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty, as well as the Home Secretary, to make a report\r\nupon this. It will soon be necessary to consider what will have to\r\nbe done for the future to complete the various plans. The Queen is\r\nno alarmist, but thinks that the necessity of our attending to our\r\ndefences once having been proved and admitted by Parliament and two\r\nsuccessive Governments, we should not relax in our efforts until the\r\nplans then devised are thoroughly carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LOUIS NAPOLEON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _26th October 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--... I must tell you an anecdote relating to Louis\r\nNapoleon's entry into Paris, which Lord Cowley wrote over, as going\r\nthe round of Paris. It is: that under one of the Triumphal Arches a\r\nCrown was suspended to a string (which is very often the case) over\r\nwhich was written, \"_Il l'a bien merite_.\" Something damaged this\r\ncrown, and they removed it--_leaving_, however, the _rope_ and\r\n_superscription_, the effect of which must have been somewhat\r\nedifying!\r\n\r\nIt is not at all true that foreign Officers are not to attend at the\r\nfuneral of the dear old Duke; on the contrary, we expect them from\r\nPrussia, Austria, and Russia, and the Duke of Terceira (whom we shall\r\nsee to-night) is already come from Portugal to attend the ceremony.\r\n\r\nI must now conclude. With Albert's love, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Malmesbury._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _8th November 1852._\r\n\r\nAs we seem to be so near the declaration of the Empire in France, and\r\nas so many opinions are expressed on the subject of the title to\r\nbe assumed by Louis Napoleon, the Queen is anxious to impress Lord\r\nMalmesbury with the importance of our not committing ourselves on this\r\npoint, and not giving our allies to understand that we shall join\r\nthem in not acknowledging Napoleon III.[44] Objectionable as this\r\nappellation no doubt is, it may hardly be worth offending France and\r\nher Ruler by refusing to recognise it, when it is of _such_ importance\r\nto prevent their considering themselves the aggrieved party; any\r\nattempt to dictate to France the style of her Ruler would strengthen\r\nLouis Napoleon's position; our object should be to leave France alone,\r\nas long as she is not aggressive.\r\n\r\nAll of this should be well weighed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Louis Napoleon himself claimed no hereditary\r\n    right to the Imperial dignity, but only that conferred by\r\n    election: he acknowledged as national all the acts which\r\n    had taken place since 1815, such as the reigns of the\r\n    later Bourbons and of Louis Philippe.

The object the Queen wishes to obtain is, to\r\nreceive an account which will show what means we have _really_ at our\r\ndisposal for purposes of defence, _ready for action_ at the shortest\r\npossible notice, and what remains to be done to put us into a state of\r\nsecurity, what the supply of the wants may cost (approximately), and\r\nwhat time it would require.\r\n\r\nAs it will be not only convenient but necessary that the Horse Guards\r\nand Ordnance should consult together and combine their deliberations,\r\nI beg this letter to be understood to apply as well to Lord Raglan\r\nas to yourself, and that you would meet and give the answer to the\r\nQueen's questions conjointly.\r\n\r\n(_A detailed list follows._)\r\n\r\nThese questions would all present themselves at the moment when we\r\nreceived the intelligence of a threatened _coup de main_ on the part\r\nof Louis Napoleon, when it would be too late to remedy any deficiency.\r\nThe public would be quite ready to give the necessary money for our\r\narmament, but they feel with justice that it is unfair to ask them for\r\nlarge sums and then always to hear, _We are quite unprepared_. They\r\ndon't understand and cannot understand details, but it is upon matters\r\nof detail that our security will have to depend, and we cannot be sure\r\nof efficiency unless a comprehensive statement be made showing the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nI beg this to be as short as possible, and if possible in a tabular\r\nshape.

The country\r\nis fully alive to its danger, and Parliament has perhaps never been\r\nin a more likely state to grant what is necessary, provided a\r\ncomprehensive and efficient plan is laid before it. Such a plan ought,\r\nin the Queen's opinion, to be distinctly promised by the Government,\r\nalthough it may be laid before Parliament at a later period.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: This Motion, intended to extort a declaration\r\n    from the House in favour of Free Trade, and describing the\r\n    Corn Law Repeal as \"a just, wise, and beneficial measure,\" was\r\n    naturally distasteful to the Ministers.

But the gracious approbation with which his\r\nservices here have been viewed was a sufficient motive for continuing\r\nthem for some time longer, if they were thought profitable to the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty has very recently been pleased to bestow upon him a still\r\nfurther distinction, which calls not merely for the expression of his\r\ndeep and humble gratitude to your Majesty, but for a further devotion\r\nto your Majesty's service of whatever power he may possess for\r\npromoting its interests.\r\n\r\nThat your Majesty should prefer him at all to an Office of such\r\ntraditional distinction as the Wardenship was an honour to which the\r\nGovernor-General would never at any time have dreamt of aspiring. But\r\nby conferring it upon him thus--during his absence--and above all, by\r\nconferring it upon him in immediate succession to one whom he must all\r\nhis life regard with reverence, affection, and gratitude--your Majesty\r\nhas surrounded this honour with so much of honourable circumstance\r\nthat the Governor-General is wholly unable to give full expression to\r\nthe feelings with which he has received your Majesty's goodness.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General is very sensible that in him, as Lord Warden,\r\nyour Majesty will have but a sorry successor to the Duke of Wellington\r\nin every respect, save one. But in that one respect--namely in deep\r\ndevotion to your Majesty's Crown, and to the true interests of your\r\nEmpire--the Governor-General does not yield even to the Master he was\r\nlong so proud to follow.\r\n\r\nIn every part of India the highest honours have been paid to the\r\nmemory of the Duke of Wellington, which your Majesty's Empire in the\r\nEast and its armies could bestow.\r\n\r\nEven the Native Powers have joined in the homage to his fame. In the\r\nmountains of Nepaul the same sad tribute was rendered by the Maharajah\r\nas by ourselves, while in Mysore the Rajah not only fired minute\r\nguns in his honour, but even caused the Dusserah, the great Hindoo\r\nfestival, to be stopped throughout the city, in token of his grief.\r\n\r\nExcepting the usual disturbance from time to time among the still\r\nuntamed mountain tribes upon our north-western border, there is entire\r\ntranquillity in India. The season has been good, and the revenue is\r\nimproving.\r\n\r\nRespectfully acknowledging the letter which he had lately the honour\r\nof receiving from your Majesty, and the gracious message it contained\r\nto Lady Dalhousie, who, though much improved in health, will be\r\ncompelled to return to England in January, the Governor-General has\r\nthe honour to subscribe himself with the utmost respect and gratitude,\r\nyour Majesty's most obedient, most humble, and devoted Subject and\r\nServant,\r\n\r\nDALHOUSIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE FUNERAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd November 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--What you say about Joinville has interested us very\r\nmuch, and we have confidentially communicated it to Lord Derby, who\r\nis never alarmed enough. There is, however, a belief that the Orleans\r\nfamily have been very imprudent, and that Louis Napoleon has heard\r\nthings and expressions used which did a great deal of harm, and Lord\r\nDerby begged me to warn them very strongly and earnestly on this\r\npoint; _I_ cannot do much, but I think _you_ might, for in fact they\r\nmight _unintentionally compromise us seriously_. The Government are\r\nrather shaky; Disraeli has been imprudent and blundering, and has done\r\nhimself harm by a Speech he made about the Duke of Wellington, which\r\nwas borrowed from an _eloge_ by Thiers on a French Marshal!!![46]\r\n\r\nYou will have heard from your children and from Charles how very\r\ntouching the ceremony both in and out of doors was on the 18th. The\r\nbehaviour of the millions assembled has been the topic of general\r\nadmiration, and the foreigners have all assured me that they never\r\ncould have believed _such_ a number of people could have shown such\r\nfeeling, such respect, for _not_ a sound was heard! I cannot say\r\n_what_ a deep and _wehmtuehige_ impression it made on me! It was a\r\nbeautiful sight. In the Cathedral it was much more touching still! The\r\ndear old Duke! he is an irreparable loss!\r\n\r\nWe had a great dinner yesterday to all the Officers. There is but one\r\nfeeling of indignation and surprise at the conduct of Austria [47]\r\nin taking _this_ opportunity to slight England in return for what\r\nhappened to _Haynau_[48] for _his own_ character. Ernest Hohenlohe\r\nwas extremely anxious you should know the reason why he may _possibly_\r\nappear one evening at the Elysee (they are gone for three or four days\r\nto Paris).\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon being excessively susceptible, and believing us to be\r\ninimical towards him, we and the Government thought it would not be\r\nwise or prudent for _my_ brother-in-law, just coming _from here_,\r\npurposely to avoid him and go out of his way, which Louis Napoleon\r\nwould immediately say was _my doing_; and unnecessary offence we do\r\nnot wish to give; the more so as Stockmar was presented to him at\r\nStrasburg, and received the _Legion d'honneur_. I promised to explain\r\nthis to you, as Ernest was distressed lest he should appear to be\r\n_timeserving_, and I said I was sure you would understand it.\r\n\r\nI must end in a hurry, hoping to write again on Thursday or Friday.\r\nDear Stockmar is very well and most kind. He is much pleased at your\r\nchildren spending some time with him every day.

He was present at a dinner of the Peelite Party\r\nyesterday at Mr Wortley's, when Speeches were made, and language held\r\nabout the reunion of the Conservative Party, resulting, however, in\r\na declaration that if your Majesty's servants did not accept Lord\r\nPalmerston's Amendment, they, as a body, would vote in favour of Mr\r\nVilliers. Lord Derby has been farther informed that they are willing\r\nto join the Government, but that one of their conditions would be\r\nthat Lord Palmerston should lead the House of Commons, Mr Gladstone\r\nrefusing to serve under Mr Disraeli. This, if true, does not look like\r\nan absence of all concert.\r\n\r\nTo complete the general confusion of Parties, the Duke of Bedford, who\r\ncalled on Lady Derby this morning, assures her that Lord John Russell\r\ndoes not desire the fall of your Majesty's present Government, and\r\nthat in no case will he enter into any combination with the Radical\r\nParty, a declaration quite at variance with the course he has pursued\r\nsince Parliament met.\r\n\r\nOf course Lord Derby, in these circumstances, has not taken any step\r\nwhatever towards exercising the discretion with which your Majesty was\r\ngraciously pleased to entrust him this morning.[49] He much regrets\r\nhaving to send your Majesty so unsatisfactory a statement, and has\r\ndesired to have the latest intelligence sent up to him of what may\r\npass in the House of Commons, and he will endeavour to keep your\r\nMajesty informed of any new occurrence which any hour may produce.\r\n\r\n_Half-past six._\r\n\r\nLord Derby has just heard from the House of Commons that Sir James\r\nGraham has given the history of the framing of the Amendment, and has\r\nexpressed his intention, if Lord Palmerston's Amendment be accepted,\r\nto advise Mr Villiers to withdraw. Mr Gladstone has held the same\r\nlanguage; there appears to be much difference of opinion, but Lord\r\nDerby would think that the probable result will be the adoption of\r\nLord Palmerston's proposition. He fears this will lead to a good deal\r\nof discontent among the supporters of the Government; but a different\r\ncourse would run imminent risk of defeat.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: The Queen had allowed him to enter into\r\n    negotiations with the Peelites and Lord Palmerston on the\r\n    distinct understanding that the latter could not receive the\r\n    lead of the House of Commons.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _26th November 1852._\r\n(_Half-past one o'clock_ A.M.)\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his humble duty to your Majesty,\r\nreports to your Majesty that the House of Commons has this moment\r\ndivided on Mr Villiers' resolution, and in a House of nearly 600\r\nmembers they have been rejected by a majority of 80.[50]\r\n\r\nThe debate was very animated and amusing, from the rival narratives of\r\nthe principal projectors of the demonstration, who, having quarrelled\r\namong themselves, entered into secret and--in a Party sense--somewhat\r\nscandalous revelations, to the diversion and sometimes astonishment of\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer deeply regrets that, having been\r\nobliged to quit the House early yesterday, he was unable to forward a\r\nbulletin to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe has fixed next Friday for the Budget.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: Lord Palmerston's Amendment (see _ante_, p.\r\n    399) was carried instead, and Protection was thenceforward\r\n    abandoned by Mr Disraeli and his followers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR DISRAELI AND MR GLADSTONE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _28th November 1852._\r\n\r\nBefore the Council held yesterday we saw Lord Derby, who seemed much\r\npleased with the result of the Division, though a good deal galled by\r\nthe tone of the Debate.\r\n\r\nLord Derby had heard it said that Mr Sidney Herbert, although very\r\nbitter in his language, had not meant to be hostile to the Government,\r\nbut felt that he owed the duty to speak out to the memory of Sir\r\nRobert Peel; that he was glad to have thrown the load off his mind.\r\nLord Derby then read us a letter from Lord Claud Hamilton, who had\r\nseen Mr Corry (one of the Peelites), who had given him to understand\r\nthat they would _not_ serve under the leadership of Mr Disraeli; that\r\nthey were ready, on the other hand, to serve under Lord Palmerston.\r\nThis put all further negotiation out of the question, for,\r\nindependently of the Queen objecting to such an arrangement, he\r\nhimself could not admit of it. On my question why Mr Gladstone could\r\nnot lead, he replied that Mr Gladstone was, in his opinion, quite\r\nunfit for it; he had none of that decision, boldness, readiness, and\r\nclearness which was necessary to lead a Party, to inspire it with\r\nconfidence, and, still [more], to take at times a decision on the spur\r\nof the moment, which a leader had often to do. Then he said that\r\nhe could not in honour sacrifice Mr Disraeli, who had acted very\r\nstraightforwardly to him as long as they had had anything to do with\r\neach other, and who possessed the confidence of his followers. Mr\r\nDisraeli had no idea of giving up the lead.\r\n\r\nWe could quite understand, on the other hand, that the colleagues of\r\nSir Robert Peel could not feel inclined to serve under Mr Disraeli.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances we agreed that nothing should be done at\r\npresent, and that it must be left to time to operate changes, that\r\nmuch must depend upon the success which Mr Disraeli may have with his\r\nBudget, and that the knowledge that Lord Palmerston could not obtain\r\nthe lead would oblige those who wished to join to think of a different\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nLord Derby owned (upon my blunt question) that he did not think Mr\r\nDisraeli had ever had a strong feeling, one way or the other, about\r\nProtection or Free Trade, and that he would make a very good Free\r\nTrade Minister.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was anxious to know what Lord Derby thought Lord George\r\nBentinck (if now alive) would do in this conjunction. Lord Derby's\r\nexpression was \"he would have made confusion worse confounded\" from\r\nhis excessive violence.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RECOGNITION OF THE EMPIRE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Malmesbury._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _2nd December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Malmesbury's letter, and returns the\r\nenclosure from Lord Cowley. Under these circumstances the course\r\nrecommended to be pursued by Lord Malmesbury[51] appears also to the\r\nQueen as the best. It is evident that we have no means of making\r\nLouis Napoleon say what he will not, nor would any diplomatic form of\r\nobtaining an assurance from him give us any guarantee of his not doing\r\nafter all exactly what he pleases. Our honour appears therefore to be\r\nbest in our own keeping.

Lord Derby was not able to hear quite the\r\ncommencement of the Speech, having been obliged to attend the House\r\nof Lords, which, however, was up at a quarter past five, Mr Disraeli\r\nhaving then been speaking about half an hour. From that time till\r\nten, when he sat down, Lord Derby was in the House of Commons, and\r\nanxiously watching the effect produced, which he ventures to assure\r\nyour Majesty was most favourable, according to his own judgment after\r\nsome considerable experience in Parliament, and also from what he\r\nheard from others. Mr Disraeli spoke for about five hours, with no\r\napparent effort, with perfect self-possession, and with hardly an\r\nexception to the fixed attention with which the House listened to the\r\nexposition of the views of your Majesty's servants. It was altogether\r\na most masterly performance, and he kept alive the attention of\r\nthe House with the greatest ability, introducing the most important\r\nstatements, and the broadest principles of legislature, just at the\r\nmoments when he had excited the greatest anxiety to learn the precise\r\nmeasures which the Government intended to introduce. The Irish part of\r\nthe question was dealt with with remarkable dexterity, though probably\r\na great part of the point will be lost in the newspaper reports. It\r\nis difficult to foresee the ultimate result, but Lord Derby has\r\nno hesitation in saying that the general first impression was very\r\nfavourable, and that, as a whole, the Budget seemed to meet with the\r\napproval of the House.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: Increase of the House Tax, reduction of the Malt\r\n    and Tea duties, and relaxation of Income Tax in the case of\r\n    farmers, were the salient features of the Budget.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN TO THE EMPEROR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Emperor of the French._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE HOUSE, _4th December 1852._\r\n\r\nSIR, MY BROTHER,--Being desirous to maintain uninterrupted the union\r\nand good understanding which happily subsist between Great Britain\r\nand France, I have made choice of Lord Cowley, a peer of my United\r\nKingdom, a member of my Privy Council, and Knight Commander of\r\nthe Most Honourable Order of the Bath, to reside at your Imperial\r\nMajesty's Court in the character of my Ambassador Extraordinary and\r\nPlenipotentiary.

The manner in which\r\nLord Malmesbury proposes this should be done the Queen approves, and\r\nonly wishes Lord Malmesbury to communicate with the proper authorities\r\nin order that the _Fairy_ may be at Southampton at the right hour,\r\nand the Frigate, as suggested, in attendance off Osborne or Cowes,\r\naccording to what the weather may be. The landing at Osborne Pier, in\r\nwet or stormy weather, is very bad, particularly for a lady.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes that the Count and Countess Walewski should come down\r\nhere with Lord Malmesbury on _Thursday next_, and we should receive\r\nthem at half-past one.

She must therefore ask for an explanation\r\nfrom Lord Malmesbury. Though the purport of the Protocol appears to\r\nthe Queen quite right, she ought not to allow the honour of England to\r\nbe pledged by her Minister without her sanction.\r\n\r\nThe exact wording of a document of that nature is a matter of such\r\nserious importance that it requires the greatest consideration, and it\r\nis a question with the Queen whether it be always quite safe to adopt\r\nentirely what is proposed by Baron Brunnow, who is generally the\r\n_redacteur_ of such documents.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: By this Protocol Louis Napoleon was to be\r\n    recognised as Emperor by Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and\r\n    Russia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Malmesbury to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _13th December 1852._\r\n\r\nLord Malmesbury presents his humble duty to the Queen. He thought\r\nit advisable to acquaint your Majesty as soon as possible with a\r\nconversation which Count Walewski had held of his own accord\r\nin reference to Her Serene Highness the Princess Adelaide of\r\nHohenlohe,[55] and he requested Lord Derby to repeat it to your\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nLord Malmesbury was not mistaken in believing that the Count had not\r\nalluded idly to the subject, as he this day called on Lord Malmesbury,\r\nand stated to him that the Emperor of the French had not decided\r\nto negotiate a marriage with the Princess of Wasa;[56] but, on the\r\ncontrary, was rather averse to such an alliance; that he was anxious,\r\non the contrary, to make one which indirectly \"_resserrerait les liens\r\nd'amitie entre l'Angleterre et la France_,\" and that with this view\r\nhe wished Lord Malmesbury to ascertain from your Majesty whether any\r\nobjections would be raised on the part of your Majesty, or of the\r\nPrincess Adelaide's family, to his contracting a marriage with Her\r\nSerene Highness. Your Majesty may suppose that he received this\r\nintimation by a simple assurance that he would submit the French\r\nEmperor's sentiments to your Majesty, and he added that he foresaw a\r\nserious difficulty to the project in the fact that the Princess was\r\na Protestant. Count Walewski was evidently sincere in the earnestness\r\nwith which he spoke of the subject, and the impatience with which he\r\npressed Lord Malmesbury to inform your Majesty of his proposal.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: The Queen's niece, daughter of Princess\r\n    Hohenlohe.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: The Princess Caroline Stephanie, daughter of\r\n    Prince Gustavus de Wasa, who was son of the last King of\r\n    Sweden of the earlier dynasty.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR'S PROPOSED MARRIAGE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _14th December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends to Lord Derby a communication which she has received\r\nfrom Lord Malmesbury.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is sorry to have been put in a situation which requires on\r\nher part a direct answer, which to have been spared would have been in\r\nevery respect more prudent and safe. As it is, however, the Queen is\r\nfully aware that the answer she is forced to give may really have,\r\nor may hereafter be made appear to have, political consequences\r\ndisadvantageous to our political relations with France, and injurious\r\nto the Queen's personal character.\r\n\r\nThe Queen therefore encloses for Lord Derby a draft of the answer she\r\nintends to give to Lord Malmesbury,[57] asking that Lord Derby will\r\nnot only give these matters his fullest consideration, but that he\r\nwill return to the Queen the draft as soon as possible, with such of\r\nhis suggestions or alterations as he may think advisable to propose to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must also express her decided wish that Lord Derby will not\r\nallow Lord Malmesbury to move a single step in this affair without it\r\nhas been previously concerted with Lord Derby.[58]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57:\r\n\r\n    _Queen Victoria to the Earl of Malmesbury._\r\n    [_Draft._]\r\n    OSBORNE, _14th December 1852._\r\n\r\n    The Queen has received Lord Malmesbury's letter of yesterday,\r\n    reporting his conversation with Count Walewski, who had asked\r\n    him to ascertain from the Queen \"whether any objections would\r\n    be raised on her part or on that of the Princess Adelaide's\r\n    family to his (the Emperor's) contracting a marriage with Her\r\n    Serene Highness.\"\r\n\r\n    In a question which affects the entire prospects and happiness\r\n    of a third person, and that person being a near and dear\r\n    relation of hers, the Queen feels herself conscientiously\r\n    precluded from forming an opinion of her own, and consequently\r\n    from taking the slightest part in it either directly or\r\n    indirectly.

Lord Malmesbury would have little difficulty in\r\n    showing Count Walewski, without any interruption of a friendly\r\n    _entente_, that the intended overtures were not likely to be\r\n    favourably received. He suggested that Lord Malmesbury should\r\n    be instructed to treat the proposition as emanating, not from\r\n    the Emperor, but unofficially, from Count Walewski; and that\r\n    he should, also unofficially, dissuade him from pressing the\r\n    subject further; such course could have no injurious effect\r\n    upon the political aspect of Europe. Lord Derby could not\r\n    understand how the affair, however it might turn out, could\r\n    affect the Queen's \"personal character.\"\r\n\r\n    He suggested that the following words should be substituted\r\n    for the last paragraph: \"And while she fully appreciates\r\n    the desire expressed by Count Walewski on the part of his\r\n    Government, '_de resserrer les liens de l'amitie entre\r\n    l'Angleterre et la France_,' she feels bound to leave the\r\n    consideration and decision of so serious a proposal to the\r\n    unbiassed judgment of the parents of the Princess and the\r\n    Princess herself, the only persons to whom such a question can\r\n    properly be referred. The Queen thinks it right to add that\r\n    being fully persuaded of the strong religious persuasion of\r\n    the Princess, of the extreme improbability of any change\r\n    of opinion on her part, and of the evils inseparable from a\r\n    difference of opinion on such a subject between the Emperor\r\n    and his intended Consort, she wishes Lord Malmesbury to place\r\n    this consideration prominently before Count Walewski, before\r\n    he takes any other step in the matter, which he appears to\r\n    have brought unofficially under the consideration of Lord\r\n    Malmesbury.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND LORD MALMESBURY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S OPINION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _16th December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Derby's letter of the 14th inst. She did\r\nnot intend to complain personally of Lord Malmesbury, who, the\r\nQueen is sure, was most anxious to do the best he could under the\r\ncircumstances; but she still thinks that a question of such importance\r\nshould not have been brought immediately before her for her decision;\r\nand although Lord Derby states his opinion that Lord Malmesbury had no\r\nalternative but to promise to Count Walewski that he would bring \"_the\r\nEmperor's sentiments before the Queen_,\" the very suggestion Lord\r\nDerby now makes, viz. \"that Lord Malmesbury should be instructed\r\nto treat the proposition as emanating, not from the Emperor,\r\nbut _unofficially_ from Count Walewski, and that he should also\r\n_unofficially_ dissuade him from pressing the matter further\"--shows\r\nthat there was an alternative.\r\n\r\nLord Derby and Lord Malmesbury alone can know, whether, after what\r\nmay have passed in conversation between Lord Malmesbury and Count\r\nWalewski, this course still remains open.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the best thing would be to terminate this\r\naffair without the Queen being called upon to give any opinion at all.\r\n\r\nLord Derby seems to treat the matter as of much less importance than\r\nthe Queen, but he will admit that, if the alliance is sought by\r\nthe Emperor, \"_pour resserrer les liens d'amitie entre la France et\r\nl'Angleterre_,\" the refusal of it on the part of the Queen must also\r\nhave the opposite effect. The responsibility of having produced this\r\neffect would rest personally with the Queen, who might be accused of\r\nhaving brought it about, influenced by personal feelings of animosity\r\nagainst the Emperor, or by mistaken friendship for the Orleans family,\r\nor misplaced family pride, etc., etc., etc. The acceptance of the\r\nproposal, on the other hand, or even the consummation of the project\r\nwithout her _direct_ intervention, cannot fail to expose the Queen\r\nto a share in the just opprobrium attaching in the eyes of all\r\nright-thinking men to the political acts perpetrated in France ever\r\nsince 2nd December 1851. And, while it would appear as if her Family\r\ndid not care for any such considerations, so long as by an alliance\r\nthey could secure momentary advantages, it would give the other\r\nPowers of Europe, whom the Emperor seems to be disposed to treat\r\nvery unceremoniously (as shown by Lord Cowley's last reports) the\r\nimpression that England suddenly had separated herself from them, and\r\nbound herself to France for a family interest pursued by the Queen.\r\n\r\nThese are the dangers to \"the Queen's personal character,\" which\r\npresented themselves to her mind when she wrote her last letter, and\r\nwhich Lord Derby says remained unintelligible to him.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes Lord Derby to show this letter to Lord Malmesbury,\r\nwhom, under the circumstances, she thinks it best not to address\r\nseparately. They will be now both in the fullest possession of the\r\nQueen's sentiments, and she hopes will be able to terminate this\r\nmatter without the expression of an opinion on the part of the Queen\r\nbecoming necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEFEAT OF THE MINISTRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _17th December 1852._\r\n(4 A.M.)\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, regrets to have to submit to your\r\nMajesty that the House of Commons, from which he has this moment\r\nreturned, has rejected the resolution for the increase of the House\r\nTax, by a majority of either nineteen or twenty-one.[59] This majority\r\nis so decisive, especially having been taken on a question which was\r\nunderstood to involve the fate of the Government, as to leave Lord\r\nDerby no alternative as to the course which it will be his duty to\r\npursue; and although, as a matter of form, it is necessary that he\r\nshould consult his Colleagues, for which purpose he has desired that\r\na Cabinet should be summoned for twelve o'clock, he can entertain no\r\ndoubt but that their opinion will unanimously concur with his own;\r\nthat he must humbly ask leave to resign into your Majesty's hands the\r\nhigh trust which your Majesty has been pleased to repose in him. Lord\r\nDerby, with your Majesty's permission, will endeavour to do himself\r\nthe honour of attending your Majesty's pleasure this evening; but it\r\nis possible that he may not be able to find the means of crossing,[60]\r\nin which case he trusts that your Majesty will honour him with an\r\naudience to-morrow (Saturday) morning. Lord Derby trusts he need\r\nnot assure your Majesty how deeply he feels the inconvenience and\r\nannoyance which this event will occasion to your Majesty, nor how\r\nanxious will be his desire that your Majesty should be enabled with\r\nthe least possible delay to form an Administration possessing more of\r\nthe public confidence. He will never cease to retain the deepest and\r\nmost grateful sense of the gracious favour and support which he has\r\non all occasions received at your Majesty's hands, and which he deeply\r\nregrets that he has been unable to repay by longer and more efficient\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: This memorable debate and its sensational\r\n    ending, with the notable speeches from Disraeli and Gladstone,\r\n    has been repeatedly described.

The\r\n    _Times_ leader (quoted by Mr Morley) was cut out and preserved\r\n    by the Queen.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60: To Osborne.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S RESIGNATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _18th December 1852._\r\n\r\nYesterday evening Lord Derby arrived from Town formally to tender his\r\nresignation. We retired to the Queen's room after dinner with him\r\nto hear what he had to say on the crisis. He complained of the\r\nfactiousness of the Opposition, which he and his Party hoped,\r\nhowever, not to imitate; was ready to support, as far as he could,\r\nany Administration which was sincerely anxious to check the growth of\r\ndemocracy. He said his calculations at the close of the Elections\r\nhad been found almost to a man verified in the late vote: 286 members\r\nvoting with the Government, and these were their regular supporters;\r\nthe other half of the House was composed of 150 Radicals, 50 of the\r\nso-called Irish Brigade, 120 Whigs, and 30 Peelites. It was clear\r\nthat, if all these combined, he would be outvoted, though none of\r\nthese Parties alone numbered as much as half of his. However, he had\r\nheard lately from good authority that the Whigs and Peelites had\r\ncome to an agreement, and were ready to form an Administration on\r\nConservative principles, to the exclusion of the Radicals, under the\r\nlead of Lord Aberdeen. Although only 150 strong, they thought, that\r\nwith all the talent they had at their command, they would be able to\r\nobtain the confidence of the country, and hold the balance between the\r\ntwo extreme Parties in the House. He felt that after having failed to\r\nobtain the confidence of Parliament himself, he could do nothing\r\nelse than retire at once, and he advised the Queen to send for Lord\r\nLansdowne, who knew better than anybody the state of Parties, and\r\nwould give the best advice. He did not advise the Queen to send for\r\nLord Aberdeen at once, because, if it were reported that he had given\r\nthis advice, many of his Party--who had already been distressed at\r\nhis declaration to them that if he was defeated he would withdraw from\r\npublic life--would think it necessary to join Lord Aberdeen as their\r\nnew appointed leader; and then the other half, which felt the deepest\r\nindignation at the treatment they had received from the Peelites,\r\nwould throw themselves into a reckless alliance with the Radicals, to\r\nrevenge themselves upon the new Government, so the great Conservative\r\nParty would be broken up, which it was so essential for the country to\r\nkeep together and moderate.\r\n\r\nI interrupted Lord Derby, saying that, constitutionally speaking, it\r\ndid not rest with him to give advice and become responsible for it,\r\nand that nobody therefore could properly throw the responsibility of\r\nthe Queen's choice of a new Minister upon him; the Queen had thought\r\nof sending for Lord Lansdowne and Lord Aberdeen together. This, Lord\r\nDerby said, would do very well; he knew that, strictly speaking, the\r\nSovereign acted upon her own responsibility, but it was always said on\r\nsuch occasions, for instance, \"Lord John advised the Queen to send for\r\nLord Derby,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nHe then gave it rather jokingly as his opinion that he thought less\r\nthan 32 could hardly be the number of the new Cabinet, so many former\r\nMinisters would expect to be taken in; the Whigs said 36. Lord John\r\nRussell was designated for the Home Office, Lord Canning for the\r\nForeign, Mr Gladstone for the Colonial Department, Lord Clanricarde\r\nfor the Post Office, Lord Granville for Ireland. These were the\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Marquis of Lansdowne._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _18th December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Lansdowne's letter, from which she was\r\nvery sorry to learn that he is suffering from the gout. Although the\r\nQueen was very anxious to have consulted with him before taking a\r\ndefinite step for the formation of a new Government consequent on the\r\nresignation of Lord Derby, she would have been very unhappy if Lord\r\nLansdowne had exposed his health to any risk in order to gratify her\r\nwishes. Time pressing, she has now sent a telegraphic message to Lord\r\nAberdeen to come down here alone, which, from the terms of the Queen's\r\nfirst summons, he had thought himself precluded from doing. Should\r\nLord Lansdowne not be able to move soon, Lord Aberdeen will confer\r\nwith him by the Queen's desire immediately on his return to Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN SUMMONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _19th December 1852._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen arrived here at three o'clock and reported that he had\r\nseen Lord Lansdowne, and had come to a perfect understanding with him;\r\nhe had also consulted with his friends, and with Lord John Russell. It\r\nwould now depend upon the decision of the Queen whom she would charge\r\nwith the formation of a Government. The Queen answered that she\r\nthought Lord Lansdowne was too old and infirm to undertake such\r\narduous duties, and that she commissioned Lord Aberdeen. He replied\r\nhe was fully aware of his own unworthiness for the task, and had\r\nexpressed his disinclination to Lord Lansdowne, while Lord Lansdowne,\r\non the other hand, had pressed him to take the responsibility himself;\r\nbut since the Queen had commissioned him, he wished to say that it was\r\nof the greatest importance that only one person should be charged with\r\nthe task and be responsible for it, and that the new Government should\r\nnot be a revival of the old Whig Cabinet with an addition of some\r\nPeelites, but should be a liberal Conservative Government in the\r\nsense of that of Sir Robert Peel; he thought this would meet with\r\nthe confidence of the country, even if excluding the Radicals. Lord\r\nAberdeen said he meant to propose to the Queen Lord John Russell as\r\nLeader of the House of Commons and Secretary of State for Foreign\r\nAffairs, which _he_ thinks he would accept. (The Queen sanctioned\r\nthis.) He would then consult Lord John upon his appointments, but\r\nhe (Lord Aberdeen) would be responsible, taking care that Lord John\r\nshould be satisfied. There was no doubt that Lord John had full claims\r\nto be Prime Minister again, but that he could give him no greater\r\nproof of confidence, having been his opponent all his life, than to\r\ngive him the lead of the House of Commons, which made him virtually\r\nas much Prime Minister as he pleased, and the Foreign Office combined\r\nwith it would satisfy Lord John as following the precedent of Mr Fox.\r\nThe Peelites would not have served under Lord Lansdowne, much less\r\nunder Lord John; but a great many Whigs even objected to Lord John.\r\nThis was a temporary and undeserved unpopularity, and still Lord John\r\nremained the first man in the country, and might be Prime Minister\r\nagain. The Peelites would know and learn to respect him when meeting\r\nhim in office. Lord Aberdeen hoped even many Conservatives now going\r\nwith Lord Derby would support such a Government, but to preserve to\r\nit a Conservative character, two Secretaries of State at least must be\r\n_Peelites_.\r\n\r\nWe next talked of Lord Palmerston, whom we agreed it would be\r\nimprudent to leave to combine in opposition with Mr Disraeli. Lord\r\nAberdeen had thought of Ireland for him; we felt sure he would not\r\naccept that. I gave Lord Aberdeen a list of the possible distribution\r\nof offices, which I had drawn up, and which he took with him as\r\ncontaining \"valuable suggestions.\" He hoped the Queen would allow him\r\nto strengthen himself in the House of Lords, where there was nobody to\r\ncope with Lord Derby, by the translation of Sir James Graham or Mr\r\nS. Herbert, if he should find this necessary. Sir James might gain in\r\nmoving from the House of Commons, as he lately fettered himself with\r\ninconvenient Radical pledges. He felt he would have great difficulty\r\nin the formation of his Government, for although everybody promised to\r\nforget his personal wishes and interests, yet when brought to the test\r\nsuch professions were often belied. The difficulty of measures lies\r\nchiefly in the Budget, as the Income Tax would have to be settled,\r\nand he was anxious to keep a good surplus. As to Reform, he felt that,\r\nconsidering the Queen to have recommended it by a Speech from the\r\nThrone, and Lord John to have actually introduced a Measure as Prime\r\nMinister, the door could not be closed against it; but it might be\r\npostponed for the present, and there was no real wish for it in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHe was very sorry that the Government had been upset, and if the\r\nBudget had been such that it could have been accepted he should much\r\nhave preferred it. Lord Derby seemed very much offended with him\r\npersonally for his speech in the House of Lords. Lord Aberdeen kissed\r\nhands, and started again at four o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n(_Undated._)[61]\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, with his humble duty, begs to inform your Majesty, that\r\non his return from Osborne last night, he saw Lord Lansdowne and Lord\r\nJohn Russell, and found them in the same disposition with respect to\r\nthe formation of the new Administration. This morning, however,\r\nLord John Russell, partly from an apprehension of the fatigue of the\r\nForeign Office, and partly from the effect likely to be produced on\r\nhis political friends by his acceptance of office, has expressed his\r\nunwillingness to form part of the Administration, although anxious to\r\ngive it his best support. Lord Aberdeen has discussed this matter\r\nvery fully with Lord John, and has requested him not to decide finally\r\nuntil to-morrow morning, which he had promised accordingly. In the\r\nmeantime, Lord Aberdeen humbly submits to your Majesty that his\r\nposition is materially affected by this irresolution on the part\r\nof Lord John. Had he not felt warranted in relying upon Lord John's\r\nco-operation, he would not have ventured to speak to your Majesty with\r\nthe confidence he yesterday evinced. With the most earnest desire to\r\ndevote himself to your Majesty's service, it becomes doubtful whether\r\nhe could honestly venture to attempt the execution of your Majesty's\r\ncommands should Lord John persevere in his present intention. At\r\nall events, nothing further can be done until this matter shall be\r\ndecided; and Lord Aberdeen will have the honour of reporting the\r\nresult to your Majesty.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: Apparently written on the 20th of December\r\n    1852.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _20th December 1852._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and is\r\ngrateful for your Majesty's condescension in informing him that your\r\nMajesty has charged the Earl of Aberdeen with the duty of constructing\r\na Government.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell is desirous of seeing a durable Government, and he\r\nwill consider with the utmost care how far he can, consistently\r\nwith his own honour and his health and strength, contribute to this\r\nend.[62]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: He consulted Lord Lansdowne, and Macaulay,\r\n    happening to call, threw his influence into the scale in\r\n    favour of his serving under Aberdeen (Walpole's _Russell_,\r\n    chap, xxiii.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR DISRAELI AND PRINCE ALBERT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _20th December 1852._\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honour to return to your Royal Highness the State\r\npaper[63] which your Royal Highness entrusted to me.

Lord Lansdowne has done his utmost to shake\r\nthe resolution, but in vain. Lord John proposes to be in the Cabinet,\r\nwithout office, but to lead the Government business in the House of\r\nCommons. Lord Aberdeen thinks this arrangement objectionable, and a\r\nnovelty, although the Duke of Wellington was Leader in the House\r\nof Lords for two years without office when Lord Hill was\r\nCommander-in-Chief. If the arrangement should be found untenable in\r\na Parliamentary view, Lord John would consent to accept a nominal\r\noffice, such as Chancellor of the Duchy. It is with great regret that\r\nLord Aberdeen makes this announcement to your Majesty, as his own\r\nposition is greatly weakened by this change; but he does not think it\r\na sufficient reason for abandoning the attempt to serve your Majesty,\r\nwhich he feared might have been the case if Lord John had persevered\r\nin his intention of not forming part of the Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S ANXIETY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _21st December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge the receipt of Lord Derby's letter.\r\nShe has since read his Speech in the House of Lords announcing his\r\nresignation most attentively, and must express her doubts, whether\r\nthat Speech was calculated to render easier the difficult task\r\nwhich has been thrown upon the Queen by the resignation of her late\r\nGovernment.[64]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 64: Lord Derby severely attacked Lord Aberdeen, in\r\n    his absence, and declared himself the victim of a factious\r\n    combination.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _21st December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen received Lord Aberdeen's letter early this morning, the\r\ncontents of which have filled her with no little anxiety.\r\n\r\nStill, she relies on the spirit of patriotism which she knows animates\r\nall the parties concerned, and which she feels sure will ultimately\r\nprevail over all difficulties, and enable a strong Government to be\r\nformed, which the country so earnestly demands and requires. The Queen\r\nis not surprised at Lord John Russell's fearing the fatigue of the\r\nForeign Office, together with the lead in the House of Commons, which\r\nLord Aberdeen's wish to show him entire confidence had prompted him to\r\noffer to Lord John; but _this_ difficulty, she trusts might easily be\r\nobviated. We intend leaving this place for Windsor to-morrow morning,\r\nand being there by two o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would wish to see Lord Aberdeen there in the course of the\r\nafternoon--either at three, four, or five--whichever time is most\r\nconvenient to him, and requests him to let her find a line from him\r\non her arrival, informing her of the hour at which he will come. Any\r\nletter, however, sent by the bag to-night or by a messenger will reach\r\nthe Queen _here_ to-morrow morning, as we do not go before a quarter\r\nto ten, and the Queen trusts therefore that Lord Aberdeen will let her\r\nhear as soon as possible how matters stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _21st December 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your dear and kind letter of the\r\n17th, which was as ever full of love and affection; but you know\r\n_very_ well that your affectionate child will never allow any mention\r\nof _your_ \"leaving the premises.\" You know--too well--how sacred\r\nduties of any kind are, and above all, those of a King, and in these\r\ndays; and how impossible it is for _us to shirk_ or abandon any of\r\nthose duties which God has imposed on us.\r\n\r\nYou will have heard of our crisis, and of the resignation of the\r\nGovernment; its overthrow was inevitable; but we must now get a strong\r\nand durable Government, one combined of the best Conservatives and\r\nLiberals, which is what the country expects, demands, and requires.\r\nLord Aberdeen has undertaken the task, but I cannot yet announce, as\r\nI wish I could, the formation of the new Government.

Lord Derby begs humbly, but most\r\nsincerely, to assure your Majesty that nothing could have been farther\r\nfrom his intention than to let fall a single word which could increase\r\nthe difficulties of the present position. He feels the full extent of\r\nthose difficulties, and he may perhaps be forgiven if he entertains a\r\nstrong opinion that a due appreciation of their magnitude might have\r\nbeen expected to have some weight with those Conservative statesmen,\r\nwhose opposition thrown into the adverse scale turned the balance\r\nagainst your Majesty's servants, and rendered their retirement from\r\noffice inevitable. Lord Derby does not affect to deny that he thinks\r\nhe has some reason, personally and politically, to find fault with the\r\ncourse which they have pursued: but to suffer any such consideration\r\nto influence his public conduct, with regard to the Government now in\r\nprocess of formation, would be entirely at variance with his sense of\r\npublic duty, and inconsistent with the deep gratitude which he must\r\never feel for the confidence with which your Majesty has honoured him.\r\nLord Derby confesses himself at a loss to understand in what manner\r\nLord Aberdeen can be enabled to reconcile the many and serious\r\ndiscrepancies, in matters both of Church and State, which would appear\r\nto exist among his presumed future colleagues; but it will give him\r\nunfeigned satisfaction to see these difficulties surmounted in such\r\na sense as to enable him to give to the Government his independent\r\nsupport; and in the meantime it is his determination honestly to\r\nundertake the task, difficult as it must be, of keeping together a\r\npowerful Party, without the excitement of opposition to a Government\r\nby which their own leaders have been superseded, and of some members\r\nof which they think they have reason to complain; and even to\r\ninduce that Party to give it their support, whenever they can do so\r\nconsistently, with their own conscientious convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW GOVERNMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd December 1852._\r\n\r\nWe arrived here from Osborne at half-past one, and saw Lord Aberdeen\r\nat half-past five, who reported the progress he had made in the\r\nformation of his Government.\r\n\r\n_The Chancellorship._--He had hoped to be able to offer to Lord St\r\nLeonards to remain, but Lord John Russell insisted, on the part of\r\nhis Party (which he personally regretted to have to do), that\r\nthe Chancellor should be a Liberal; Lord Aberdeen in consequence\r\nrecommended Lord Cranworth.\r\n\r\n_The Presidency of the Council._--The Duke of Newcastle, who might\r\nhave done for Ireland, but whose presence in the House of Lords would\r\nbe a great support to Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n_The Privy Seal._--The Duke of Argyll, to whom he had, however, not\r\nyet applied.\r\n\r\n_The Secretaries of State._--It appeared that Lord Palmerston had\r\nrepented of his decision, for he had addressed Lord Lansdowne, and\r\ntold him that he gave him his proxy--putting himself entirely into\r\nhis hands, feeling sure that he would take care of his honour. Lord\r\nLansdowne, who had been throughout very kind in his exertions to bring\r\nabout the junction of Parties, was now engaged to prevail upon him\r\nto take the Home Office. We congratulated Lord Aberdeen upon this\r\nsymptom, which augured confidence in his success. Lord Aberdeen said\r\nthat when he saw Lord Palmerston, who then declined office, nothing\r\ncould have exceeded the expressions of his cordiality; he had even\r\nreminded him that in fact they were great friends (!!!) of sixty\r\nyears' standing, having been at school together. We could not help\r\nlaughing heartily at the _Harrow Boys_ and their friendship. The\r\nForeign Office Lord John had again positively refused, contrary to the\r\nadvice of all his friends, and to please Lady John. This arrangement\r\nfailing, Lord Clarendon was to undertake it, but Lord Clarendon was\r\nnow gone himself to try to persuade Lord, or rather Lady, John to\r\naccept--at least temporarily--declaring his readiness to take it\r\noff his hands at any time if he should find the work too heavy. Lord\r\nAberdeen had no hope, however, of Lord Clarendon's success. Then\r\nthere would come the grave Constitutional Question of establishing the\r\nnovelty of a Leader in the House of Commons who held no office. Lord\r\nJohn had seen the danger of being exposed to the reproach that he had\r\nslipped into office without having gone through the popular ordeal\r\nof a re-election, and had proposed to obviate this by accepting\r\nthe Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds, and then having himself\r\nre-elected for the City of London. But this would not meet all the\r\nobjections, for it would still be considered unconstitutional that\r\nhe should lead the business of the Government in the House of Commons\r\nwithout the responsibility of office. The Leader of the House of\r\nCommons was an irresponsible person, and Lord John's saying: \"I shall\r\nrepresent you (Lord Aberdeen) in the House of Commons,\" would be\r\nequally unconstitutional. Lord John must therefore be prevailed upon\r\nto take the Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster, though he\r\nfelt no inclination to become the successor of Mr Christopher. Lord\r\nAberdeen read a Memorandum of Lord John's, containing his political\r\nviews on the crisis and the principles of the new Government, of which\r\nhe is to send the Queen a copy.\r\n\r\n_For the Colonial Office._--Lord Aberdeen wavered between Sir J.\r\nGraham and Mr Gladstone; either could be this, or Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. Lord John wished Sir James as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\nWe argued the greater capabilities of Sir James for the Administration\r\nof the Colonies, and Mr Gladstone for the Finances.\r\n\r\n  _Chancellor of the Exchequer_--therefore, Mr Gladstone.\r\n  _Admiralty_--Mr Sidney Herbert.\r\n  _Board of Control_--Sir C. Wood.\r\n  _Board of Trade_--Lord Granville.\r\n  _Board of Works_--Sir F. Baring.\r\n\r\n(Baring and Wood being the two men whom Lord John had insisted on\r\nhaving on the Treasury Bench sitting by his side.)\r\n\r\n  _Postmaster_--Lord Canning.\r\n  _Secretary-at-War_--Mr Cardwell.\r\n\r\nThese would form the Cabinet. Upon Ireland no decision had been\r\ncome to, though Lord Granville was generally pointed out as the best\r\nLord-Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen was very much pleased with the entire confidence\r\nexisting between him and Lord John. The Budget would be a formidable\r\ndifficulty, as in fact the Government would be an Income Tax\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nLord Derby's intemperate and unconstitutional behaviour would do\r\nno good to the Government; many of his friends were disgusted. Lord\r\nClanwilliam had called his speech in the House of Lords \"a great\r\noutrage.\" The Radicals might be conciliated in some of the lower\r\nOffices by the appointment of Mr Charles Villiers, Sir William\r\nMolesworth, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Malmesbury to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _23rd December 1852._\r\n\r\nLord Malmesbury presents his humble duty to the Queen, and considers\r\nit right to inform your Majesty that Count Walewski again asked him\r\nyesterday where the Prince of Hohenlohe was now residing, adding that\r\nit was the intention of the Emperor to send a person to see him, and\r\nascertain his feelings with respect to a marriage between him and the\r\nPrincess Adelaide. Lord Malmesbury confined himself to replying that\r\nhe did not know. Lord Malmesbury might perhaps in his private capacity\r\nendeavour to discourage these advances, but as long as he has the\r\nhonour of being one of your Majesty's Ministers, it appears to him\r\nthat your Majesty will be _personally_ the least committed by his\r\ninterfering as little as possible in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is becoming extremely irritable at the delay of the three\r\ngreat Powers in recognising the Empire, and he has said to M. Huebner\r\nthat, as they had plenty of time to agree among themselves what course\r\nthey should pursue when it was proclaimed, he cannot understand how\r\nAustria and Prussia can in the face of Europe humiliate themselves by\r\nwaiting for the orders of Russia--\"_les ordres de la Russie_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Malmesbury._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Malmesbury's letter.

She has also received the second communication, with\r\nthe List of the distribution of Offices. The Queen thinks it of such\r\nimportance that the Cabinet should be now announced to the world as\r\ncomplete, that she is unwilling to throw any difficulties in the way.\r\nAt the same time, she must observe that in some instances the changes\r\nare, in her opinion, not for the better. Sir J. Graham will be very\r\nunpopular in the Navy; his achievements at the Admiralty in former\r\ntimes[65] were all _retrenchments_, and have since proved in many\r\ninstances injurious to the Service. The Secretary-at-War ought\r\nproperly to be left out of the Cabinet for the well working of the\r\nArmy;[66] the President of the Board of Trade has always been in the\r\nCabinet, and in Lord Granville's case, even the Vice-President.\r\nLord Granville will have a difficulty as Chancellor of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster, being one of the chief lessees of the Duchy, and, the Queen\r\nbelieves, even engaged in a law-suit against it. The Queen has no\r\nobjection to Sir William Molesworth[67] at the Office of Works. She\r\nhopes that the Presidency of the Council will be filled at once, for\r\nwhich Lord Clarendon would be best.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Under-Secretaries of State, the Queen wishes merely to\r\nexpress her objection at seeing Mr B. Osborne[68] at the _Foreign_\r\nOffice. The Queen sees Lord Chandos's[69] name as Secretary to the\r\nTreasury; she would be very much pleased to see his services secured.\r\nAll the other proposals she approves.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must repeat in conclusion that she considers the rapid\r\ncompletion of the Government of the first importance, even if none of\r\nthe points the Queen has alluded to should be amended.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 65: From 1830 to 1834.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 66: The Secretary-at-War was not a Secretary of\r\n    State.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 67: M.P. for Southwark; well known as a\r\n    philosophical writer, the first member of the Radical Party\r\n    included in any Ministry.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 68: Mr Bernal Osborne, a well-known speaker at the\r\n    time, became Secretary of the Admiralty.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 69: Afterwards, as Duke of Buckingham, Secretary for\r\n    the Colonies and Governor of Madras.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW CABINET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has this moment received Lord Aberdeen's letter, reporting\r\nthat new difficulties have arisen in the completion of the Government\r\nby new proposals made by Lord John Russell, since the Queen's sanction\r\nhad been given to the arrangements submitted to her by Lord Aberdeen,\r\nwhich had then been agreed to by Lord John Russell. The Queen begins\r\nto fear serious mischief from the long duration of the crisis. It must\r\nweaken the prestige of the new Government, and, instead of smoothing\r\ndifficulties, is, from the nature of things, rather calculated to\r\ninvite new ones. The Queen has, in her letter of yesterday, stated\r\nsome objections _she_ felt, but added that she would waive them all\r\nfor the satisfaction of the immediate want of the country (a strong\r\nGovernment), and she must express her hope that political parties will\r\nnot fall short in patriotic spirit of the example she has thus herself\r\nset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n[_Draft--from recollection._]\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of this afternoon, and\r\nis very glad to hear that he has overcome the difficulties which he\r\nmentioned this morning, and that he has secured the services of Lord\r\nLansdowne in the Cabinet. She hopes, however, that Lord Aberdeen will\r\nremain firm on the other points, as difficulties are never overcome by\r\nyielding to more than can be fairly demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _25th December 1852._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen came this afternoon to announce the completion of his\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nFrom many of them answers have not yet been received.\r\n\r\nThe day before it looked very bad. Lord John Russell had sent in such\r\na list of persons whom he required in the Cabinet (Sir Francis\r\nBaring, Sir George Grey, etc., etc.), that, having been very yielding\r\nhitherto, Lord Aberdeen was obliged to be peremptory in his refusal.\r\nNow that the Cabinet was formed on a due proportion, he was inclined\r\nto let Lord John have his own way pretty much with regard to the\r\nminor Offices, considering that he brought 250 followers, and he (Lord\r\nAberdeen) only 50.\r\n\r\nIt was to Lord Clarendon that the persuasion of Lady John was finally\r\ndue, but Lord Aberdeen had to add his own promise to that of Lord\r\nClarendon, that the latter would take the Foreign Office whenever she\r\nthought Lord John ought to be relieved from it.\r\n\r\nLady Palmerston had been most anxious to bring her husband into office\r\nagain; Lord Aberdeen had seen the first symptom of their joint wish in\r\nthe earnestness with which Lord Palmerston's friends declared in all\r\nplaces that, had he been well enough, he would certainly have voted\r\nagainst the Government.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne's exertions and Lord Clarendon's disinterestedness were\r\nbeyond all praise.\r\n\r\nOf the Derbyites, he heard that most of them would be very quiet, and\r\nmany would be very friendly.\r\n\r\nLord Breadalbane is to be Lord Chamberlain.

As you\r\nhave not yet placed before the Queen your recommendations, I merely\r\nwrite this to you, fearing that the \"Whig Party\" may deal out places\r\nbefore you have had an opportunity of taking the Queen's pleasure.\r\nEver yours truly,\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S FAREWELL AUDIENCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _27th December 1852._\r\n\r\nLord Derby had his audience of leave yesterday afternoon. He repeated\r\nhis thanks to the Queen for the support and countenance she had given\r\nhim throughout the period he had been allowed to serve her, adding\r\nhis regrets that his services could not have been more efficient or\r\nlonger. One thing only distressed him in taking leave, and that\r\nwas the idea that the Queen might think he had unnecessarily raised\r\ndifficulties to the formation of a new Government by his Speech in\r\nthe House of Lords. Now, it had been incumbent upon him to show to\r\nhis Party that he had not quitted office on light grounds, after the\r\nsacrifices of opinion they had brought in order to support him; he had\r\nto prove that the vote in the House of Commons was not an accidental\r\nvote, but the preconcerted Union of all Parties (in opposition)\r\nagainst him, which gave them a real majority. We replied that it was\r\nnot his opinion on the late division, to the expression of which the\r\nQueen had objected, but to that of an opinion on the character of\r\nthe new Government which the Queen had not yet formed. It was of the\r\ngreatest importance to keep that in suspense, and the declaration that\r\nLord Derby knew Lord Aberdeen to profess Conservative opinions of his\r\nown (Lord Derby's) shade, had at once given the alarm to the Radicals,\r\nand made them insist upon a greater proportion of Liberals in the\r\nCabinet. Lord Derby rejoined he had expressed his doubts as to how\r\nthese differences could be reconciled; and he did not see now how this\r\nwas to be done. How could Lord Aberdeen and Lord John Russell agree\r\nupon the Foreign Policy, for instance? The Queen replied that Lord\r\nJohn's views were very sound and moderate, and that the line of\r\nForeign Policy he had formerly had to pursue had been forced upon him\r\nby Lord Palmerston, who had never left a question for the decision of\r\nthe Cabinet to which he had not already given a decided bias.\r\n\r\nDid Lord Derby know that Lord Palmerston gave it out everywhere that,\r\nhad he been well enough, he should certainly have voted _against_\r\nthe Government? Lord Derby could only say that he had allowed his\r\nson-in-law, Lord Jocelyn, to go to Italy under the firm conviction\r\nthat Lord Palmerston would refuse to join Lord Aberdeen or Lord John\r\nRussell!\r\n\r\nLord Derby took leave after five o'clock.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LADY DERBY'S LETTER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Countess of Derby to the Marchioness of Ely._[70]\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _27th December 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LADY ELY,--Lord Derby told me that he saw you yesterday,\r\nbut only for a moment. I think he was nervous about his audience of\r\nleave, but he returned deeply touched by the kindness of manner of the\r\nQueen and the Prince. I cannot resist saying to you that, during the\r\nlast year, he has been more and more impressed with the admirable\r\nqualities of the Queen, and her noble straightforwardness on all\r\noccasions, and her unvarying kindness have inspired him with the\r\nstrongest attachment (if I may venture so to express his feelings for\r\nHer Majesty). During that week of terrible suspense he continually\r\nsaid to me that his chief anxiety and regret were caused by the fear\r\nof leaving the Queen, particularly before he had had time and power to\r\ndo more in her service. I am writing in haste, having much to do this\r\nlast day in Town, but I have very often wished that the Queen knew how\r\nwarmly and sincerely Lord Derby is devoted to her service. He is also\r\nvery grateful to the Prince, for whose abilities he has the highest\r\nadmiration, often speaking of his wonderful cleverness. I am delighted\r\nto hear that the Queen is so well; he said she was looking remarkably\r\nwell yesterday. He told me that Her Majesty used some kind expression\r\nabout myself. If you should have an opportunity of saying to Her\r\nMajesty how grateful I am for all her former kindness, I should be\r\nvery much obliged to you. Ever yours very affectionately,\r\n\r\nEMMA DERBY.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 70: Submitted to the Queen by Lady Ely.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEW MINISTRY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR DISRAELI]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _28th December 1852._\r\n\r\nThe delivery of the Seals of Office of the outgoing Ministers into the\r\nQueen's hands, and her bestowal of them upon the new Ministers, took\r\nplace to-day.\r\n\r\nOf the former, Mr Disraeli seemed to feel most the loss of office.\r\n\r\nWe saw Lord Aberdeen for some time, who submitted the names of all the\r\npersons he recommended for the subordinate Offices, of whom he will\r\nsend a list. We asked him what might have passed between the last\r\nSession and this to chill his feelings for Lord Derby, who maintained\r\nthat up to the Dissolution he had sent him messages to say that he\r\nperfectly agreed with him, except on the Commercial Policy, and that\r\nhe never would join the Whigs. Lord Aberdeen disclaimed all knowledge\r\nof such messages, though he acknowledged to have been very friendly to\r\nLord Derby. At the General Election, however, it appeared to him\r\nthat there was such a total want of principle in him and his Party,\r\npledging themselves for Protection in one place and Free Trade in\r\nanother, and appearing consistent only on one point, viz. their hatred\r\nto Sir Robert Peel's memory and his friends, that he became determined\r\nto have nothing to do with them.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Government appeared to give satisfaction to the\r\ncountry, though of course the number of the disappointed must be even\r\nlarger than usual on such occasions. Lord Canning seemed very much\r\nhurt at not being taken into the Cabinet, and felt inclined to refuse\r\nthe Post Office. We agreed upon the impolicy of such a step,\r\nand encouraged Lord Aberdeen to press him. Lord Clanricarde, and\r\nparticularly Lord Carlisle, were very much grieved at being left out\r\naltogether, but there was no help for it; for each man taken in from\r\none side, two would be proposed from the other, and the Cabinet was\r\njust large enough to work.\r\n\r\nWe saw Lord Lansdowne after the Council, who seemed well satisfied\r\nwith the Government, a combination he had so much and so long wished.\r\nLord Carlisle's annoyance was the only thing which personally grieved\r\nhim. He said that from the moment he had read Mr Disraeli's Budget he\r\nhad felt sure that the Government would fall immediately; the country\r\nwould never submit to a new tax with a surplus in the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, whom we saw afterwards, seemed in very good health\r\nand spirits. He told us that the peaceful parting scene in the House\r\nof Commons had been his doing; he had told Mr Walpole that he thought\r\nMr Disraeli ought to make an apology to the House for the language he\r\nhad used, and which had given pain to a great many persons; and on\r\nMr Walpole's saying that that was a very delicate thing to tell Mr\r\nDisraeli, he had allowed it to be told him as a message from him (Lord\r\nJohn). Mr Disraeli declared his readiness, provided others would do\r\nthe same, and declared they had meant no offence.[71] We owned that\r\nwe had been astonished to find them of a sudden all so _well bred_. We\r\nasked what Lord Palmerston had been about during the crisis? Lord John\r\ntold us in reply that Lord Palmerston had certainly been disposed\r\nto join Lord Derby's Government, but always said he could not do so\r\nalone; that if eight of them were to join, then they would have the\r\nmajority in the Cabinet. He also said that he believed Lord Palmerston\r\nwould have voted _for_ some parts of the Budget and against others.\r\nLord John does not think that that large Party of Lord Derby's will\r\nlong keep together, that some would vote for the Government, others\r\nmight try to raise a Protestant cry.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston looked excessively ill, and had to walk with two\r\nsticks from the gout.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71: \"Mr Disraeli ... with infinite polish and grace\r\n    asked pardon for the flying words of debate, and drew easy\r\n    forgiveness from the member (Mr Goulburn), whom a few hours\r\n    before he had mocked as 'a weird sibyl'; the other member (Sir\r\n    James Graham), whom he could not say he greatly respected, but\r\n    whom he greatly regarded; and the third member (Sir C.\r\n    Wood), whom he bade learn that petulance is not sarcasm, and\r\n    insolence is not invective. Lord John Russell congratulated\r\n    him on the ability and the gallantry with which he had\r\n    conducted the struggle, and so the curtain fell.\" Morley's\r\n    _Gladstone_, Book III. chap. viii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _28th December 1852._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Your dear letter of the 24th reached me on Monday,\r\nand I thank you warmly for it.

A quarter of an hour before I\r\nreceived this letter from Uncle Leopold, which I sent in Ernest's\r\nletter to Ada, and in which he speaks his opinion that we ought not\r\nto say \"_No_\" _at once_, before telling Ada of it. This is very much\r\nagainst my wish and Ernest's, for we both would like to make an end\r\nof the affair as soon as possible, but cannot, as we see the truth of\r\nwhat Uncle Leopold says. I send a letter to Mamma to you, and one for\r\nAda. Mamma knows of it, as she wrote to me the other day, and I leave\r\nit to you, dearest Victoria, if you or Mamma will tell the poor child\r\nof the transaction. She will be in great distress. I wish she may at\r\nonce say \"_No_,\" but am not sure of it; and in our letters we have\r\nnot said anything for the thing, but nothing against also but what\r\nnaturally is to be said against it. She will not know what to do, and\r\nI am sure you and Mamma will not put it to her in _too_ favourable a\r\nlight, as we are of the same opinion on the subject; but yet there may\r\nbe some things in its favour too. I wish you would make Charles come\r\nto us--_if you think it wise to do so_--and he not only will try to\r\nengage us to it. But there may be so many reasons for or against which\r\nin a letter it is not possible to explain all, and which we could not\r\nanswer in time; besides by him we might learn more accurately what\r\nAda feels: but I leave it quite to your and Albert's judgment, if this\r\nwould be a good plan.

Ever\r\nyour devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening of the year 1853 saw a strong Coalition Ministry in power;\r\nthe necessity of a cordial understanding with France was obvious, but\r\nbitter and indiscreet attacks on the Emperor of the French were made\r\nby certain members of the Government, for which Mr Disraeli took them\r\nseverely to task. Lord John Russell, who had been appointed Foreign\r\nSecretary, resigned that office in February, in favour of Lord\r\nClarendon, being unable to bear the twofold burden of the Leadership\r\nof the House and the Foreign Office. Though the arrangement was\r\nquestioned, he continued during the year to lead the House without\r\noffice. A Canadian Clergy Reserves Bill, an India Bill, introducing\r\ncompetitive examination into the Civil Service, and various measures\r\nof Metropolitan improvement were passed. A more important feature of\r\nthe Session was Mr Gladstone's first Budget, dealing comprehensively\r\nwith the Income Tax, and imposing a duty on successions to real\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Question, however, overshadowed all other interests. For\r\nsome time a dispute had existed between the Latin and Greek Churches\r\nas to the guardianship of the Holy Places (including the Church of\r\nthe Holy Sepulchre) in Palestine. After long negotiations between the\r\nFrench and Russian Governments, as representing these Churches, an\r\nindecisive judgment was pronounced by the Porte, which, however, so\r\nincensed Russia that she began to make warlike demonstrations,\r\nand sent Prince Menschikoff to Constantinople to make peremptory\r\nrequisitions as to the Holy Places.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the Czar had made confidential overtures to\r\nSir Hamilton Seymour, the British Ambassador at St Petersburg,\r\nrepresenting the Sultan as a very \"sick man,\" and suggesting that,\r\non the dissolution of his Empire, a concerted disposal of the Turkish\r\ndominions should be made by England and Russia; these conversations\r\nwere reported at once to the British Government. Lord Stratford\r\nde Redcliffe, who had been sent to represent British interests\r\nat Constantinople, arrived there after Prince Menschikoff, and a\r\nsettlement of the disputes as to the Holy Places was then easily\r\neffected, Lord Stratford insisting on this question being kept\r\nindependent of any other issue. But Prince Menschikoff had come to\r\nthe conference with instructions to keep an ulterior object in view,\r\nnamely, to advance a claim, by means of a strained interpretation of\r\nthe Treaty of Kainardji of 1774, of a Russian protectorate over the\r\nChristian subjects of the Sultan. Influenced by Lord Stratford, the\r\nPorte rejected the claim, and, in retaliation, the Czar occupied the\r\nDanubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, characterising the\r\nstep not as an act of war, but a material guarantee of Russia's just\r\nrights. The French Emperor, anxious to divert the attention of his\r\nsubjects from domestic politics, was making preparations for war; and\r\nsimilar preparations were also being made in England.\r\n\r\nNegotiations took place between the Powers with a view of averting\r\nwar, and a document known as the Vienna Note, to which Great Britain\r\nand France were parties, and which Russia accepted, was proffered to\r\nthe Sultan: again Lord Stratford interposed to prevent its acceptance,\r\nand, when the Russian Government subsequently announced its own\r\ninterpretation of the Note, it was apparent that the Western Powers\r\nhad been mistaken as to its purport.\r\n\r\nAn Ultimatum, requiring the evacuation of the Principalities, was\r\nsent by the Porte to Russia and rejected: war broke out, and the first\r\nencounter at Oltenitza, on the 4th of November, resulted in favour of\r\nTurkey. Meanwhile both the British and French fleets had been sent\r\nto the East, and, on the declaration of war, the British Admiral\r\nwas instructed to take any action he thought fit to prevent Russian\r\naggression on Turkish territory. On the 30th of November the Turkish\r\nFleet in Sinope Harbour was destroyed by the Russian squadron, this\r\noccurrence provoking profound indignation in England, though it had\r\nbeen urged both within the Cabinet and outside that the despatch of\r\nthe combined Western Fleets through the Dardanelles was more likely to\r\nappear as a defiance to Russia than a support to Turkey.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year Lord Aberdeen had desired to retire, but enquiry\r\nsoon disclosed that Lord John Russell no longer had the influence\r\nnecessary to form a Ministry, and in the face of danger Lord Aberdeen\r\nremained at his post. But there were sharp dissensions in the Cabinet,\r\nespecially between Lord Palmerston, representing the anti-Russian\r\nparty, on the one hand, and on the other Lord Aberdeen, who distrusted\r\nthe Turks, and Mr Gladstone, who disavowed any obligation to uphold\r\nthe integrity of the Ottoman Empire. In December, Lord Palmerston\r\nresigned office, the ostensible reason being his opposition to the\r\ncontemplated Reform Bill of the Government. The real cause was his\r\nopinion that apathy was being shown by his colleagues in reference to\r\nthe Eastern Question; however, after arrangements had been made for\r\nreplacing him, he was, at his own desire, re-admitted to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n1853\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _4th January 1853._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--... Our new Government will really, I think,\r\ncommand a large support, and, I trust, be of duration, which is a\r\ngreat object. Their only difficulty will be the Budget.\r\n\r\nThe coldness and tardiness of the Northern Powers in recognising _our_\r\nnew _bon Frere_ annoys him very much, and produces a bad effect in\r\nFrance. I don't think it is wise. Unnecessary irritation may produce\r\n_real_ mischief. To squabble about _how_ to call him, after having\r\npraised and supported him after the _Coup d'Etat_, seems to me very\r\n_kleinlich_ and inconsistent, and I think our conduct throughout has\r\nbeen much more dignified....\r\n\r\nI have read with pleasure the loyal addresses of the Chambers, and\r\nwith peculiar satisfaction the allusion to Leopold's visit to England.\r\nLet him and Philippe come here often and regularly, and let them study\r\nthis country and her laws _a fond_--it will do them more good than\r\nall the studying and reading in the world. They all three express most\r\nwarmly to us their hopes of returning to us soon. Do let us have the\r\nhope of seeing you in February. It would be delightful!... I must now\r\nwish you good-bye. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HEADMASTERSHIP OF ETON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _9th January 1853._\r\n\r\n... Lord Aberdeen also begs to mention to your Majesty that he saw\r\nDr Hawtrey yesterday and in signifying your Majesty's gracious\r\nintentions[1] towards him, took an opportunity of expressing in very\r\nstrong terms the great importance of the choice of his successor as\r\nHeadmaster of Eton, and described the requisite qualifications for\r\nsuch a situation, as well as the objections to which some appointments\r\nmight be liable. Lord Aberdeen was perfectly understood by Dr Hawtrey,\r\nalthough no name was mentioned; and the subject was regarded as being\r\nof the utmost importance, not only to the school itself, but to the\r\nnation at large.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Dr E. C. Hawtrey was advanced to the Provostship\r\n    of Eton upon the death of the Rev. Francis Hodgson. Dr C.

Apart, however,\r\nfrom the historical interest attached to it as one of the very curious\r\nacts of the extraordinary Drama now enacting in France, the impression\r\nproduced was one that would be called forth by a magnificent\r\ntheatrical representation, and little more. This seemed to be the\r\npublic feeling, for though multitudes thronged the streets, the day\r\nbeing dry, they appeared to be animated by curiosity chiefly, and that\r\n_sober_ curiosity which now characterises the people of Paris, wearied\r\nas they are of _novelty_ and excitement. As far as one can judge,\r\nit does not seem that the lower orders take much interest in this\r\nmarriage; the ambition and vanity of _his_ partisans have been wounded\r\nby it, and, of course, his enemies do not scruple to calumniate and\r\nslander the unfortunate object of his choice disgracefully.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to ascertain anything like truth as regards her,\r\nbut her beauty and engaging manners will, it is thought by many, gain\r\nfor her, for a time at least, a greater amount of popularity than his\r\nfriends who now blame the marriage expect. That he is passionately in\r\nlove with her no one doubts, and his countenance on late occasions, as\r\nwell as yesterday, wore a radiant and joyous expression very unusual.\r\nShe, on the contrary, showed a considerable amount of nervousness at\r\nthe Civil Marriage, and was as pale as death yesterday--however, even\r\nwith the high and determined spirit she is supposed to have, this\r\nmight be expected. Lady Cowley had been kind enough to send us an\r\ninvitation, of which we were tempted to avail ourselves.[3] Nothing\r\ncould be more splendid than the decorations of the Cathedral--velvet\r\nand ermine--gold and silver--flags and hangings of all colours were\r\ncombined and harmonised with the splendid costumes of the Clergy,\r\nthe uniforms, civil and military, and the magnificent dresses of the\r\nladies. The greatest mistake was the _conflict_ of lights--the windows\r\nnot having been darkened, though countless thousands of wax candles\r\nwere lighted. The music was very fine.... The object of our neighbours\r\nseemed to be to scan and criticise the dress of the Bride, and the\r\nwonderful penetration and accuracy of their eagle glances was to us\r\nsomething incredible! Certainly, though unable ourselves at such a\r\ndistance to appreciate the details of her dress or the expression of\r\nher countenance, we saw her distinctly enough to be able to say that\r\na more lovely _coup d'[oe]il_ could not be conceived. Her beautifully\r\nchiselled features and marble complexion, her nobly _set-on head_,\r\nher exquisitely proportioned figure and graceful carriage were most\r\nstriking, and the whole was like a Poet's Vision! I believe she is\r\nequally beautiful when seen close, but at a distance at which we saw\r\nher the effect was something more than that of a lovely picture, it\r\nwas aerial, ideal. On the classically shaped head she wore a diamond\r\ncrown or diadem, round her waist a row of magnificent diamonds to\r\ncorrespond, and the same as trimming round the \"basques\" of her gown.\r\nThen a sort of cloud or mist of transparent lace enveloped her,\r\nwhich had the effect of that for which, when speaking of the hills in\r\nScotland, Princess Hohenlohe could find no English word, \"_Duft_.\" I\r\nhope your Royal Highness will not think me very much carried by what\r\npleases the eye. I felt all the while that one could view the matter\r\nbut as an outside show; as such, in as far as she was concerned,\r\nit was exquisitely beautiful--and I suppose that a sort of national\r\nprejudice made me attribute the grace and dignity of the scene,\r\nfor what there was of either came from her, to the blood of\r\n_Kirkpatrick!!!_\r\n\r\nThe carriages were ugly and the Procession by no means fine, and\r\nthose in which the Bridal party afterwards travelled to St Cloud,\r\nwere driven by individuals in the famous theatrical costume of the\r\nwell-known \"Postillon de Longjumeau!\"[4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: The Emperor of the French was married to\r\n    Mademoiselle Eugenie de Montijo on the 29th of January.\r\n    William Kirkpatrick, her maternal grandfather, had been a\r\n    merchant and American Consul at Malaga, and had there married\r\n    Francoise de Grivegnec. Their third daughter, Maria\r\n    Manuela, married, in 1817, the Count de Teba, a member of an\r\n    illustrious Spanish family, who in 1834 succeeded his brother\r\n    as Count de Montijo, and died in 1839.

Since I wrote to you _le grand evenement a eu lieu!_ We\r\ntruly live in times where at least variety is not wanting; the only\r\nmischief is that like drunkards people want more and more excitement,\r\nand it therefore will probably end by what remains the most exciting\r\nof all--War. Amusing and interesting war is, it must be confessed,\r\nmore than anything in the world, and that makes me think that it\r\nmust be the bouquet when people will be _blase_ of everything else.\r\nI enclose a letter from our Secretary of Legation at Madrid, Baron\r\nBeyens, who married a great friend of the Queen, Mademoiselle de Santa\r\nCruz, and is much _au fait_ of all things that interest the public\r\njust now. It seems by what I learned from Paris that the Empress\r\ncommunicated to a friend a communication of _son cher epoux_ when\r\nshe expressed her sense of her elevation to such eminence; as it may\r\ninterest you and Albert, I will make an extract of it here: \"Vous ne\r\nme parlez, ma chere enfant, que des avantages de la position que je\r\nvous offre, mais mon devoir est de vous signaler aussi ses dangers;\r\nils sont grands, je serai sans doute a vos cotes l'objet de plus d'une\r\ntentative d'assassinat; independamment de cela, je dois vous confier\r\nque des complots serieux se fomentent dans l'armee. J'ai l'[oe]il\r\nouvert de ce cote et je compte bien d'une maniere ou d'autre prevenir\r\ntoute explosion; le moyen sera _peut-etre la guerre_.

For poor Lady\r\nMelbourne, who devoted herself so much, it is a sad blow. We are\r\nlonging for a little cold, but it does not come though we have some\r\neast wind. I am held back in some of the _most essential_ measures for\r\nthe defence of the country by the tricks of the Chamber. I see that\r\nthe Manchester party shines in unusual Bright-ness and Cobden-ness by\r\na degress of absurdity never as yet heard of. In the American War the\r\nQuakers refused to fight; they did not besides like the extremities\r\nthe States had gone to against the mother country; but not to defend\r\nits own country against probable invasion is truly too much.\r\n\r\nPray have the goodness to give my best love to Albert, and believe me,\r\never my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _8th February 1853._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I have to thank you for two most kind letters of\r\nthe 4th and 7th (which I have just received) with very interesting\r\nenclosures, which shall be duly returned. The little report of what\r\nthe Emperor said to the Empress is very curious, and tallies with what\r\nI have also heard of his thinking much more of the insecurity of his\r\nposition than he used to do. The description of the young Empress's\r\ncharacter is an interesting one, and also agrees with what I had\r\nheard from those who know her well. It may be in her power to do much\r\ngood--and I hope she may. Her character is made to captivate a man, I\r\nshould say--particularly one like the Emperor.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that you have had trouble with your Parliament. Ours begins\r\nits work on Thursday. The accounts of the support which our\r\nGovernment will receive are most satisfactory, and the Cabinet is most\r\nharmonious....

Lord John Russell read at the Cabinet a despatch received from\r\nyour Majesty's Minister at St Petersburg, giving an account of an\r\ninterview with the Emperor, at which His Majesty appeared to expect an\r\nearly dissolution of the Turkish Empire, and proposed in such a case\r\nto act in perfect concert with the British Government. Lord John also\r\nread the rough draft of a proposed answer to this despatch, which,\r\nwith slight alterations, was fully approved.[5]\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen does not think there is anything very new in this\r\ndemonstration by the Emperor. It is essentially the same language he\r\nhas held for some years, although, perhaps, the present difficulties\r\nof Turkey may have rendered him more anxious on the subject....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: _See_ Introductory Note, p. 431.

Mr Walpole spoke privately to Lord John Russell\r\nas to his future position in leading the Government in the House of\r\nCommons without office. Mr Walpole said it was neither illegal nor\r\nunconstitutional, but might prove inconvenient as a precedent.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker said in conversation there was clearly no _constitutional_\r\nobjection, but that the leadership of the House was so laborious that\r\nan office without other duties ought to be assigned to it....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S DEFENCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _13th February 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of yesterday, and\r\nwas very glad to hear that he considers the aspect of the House of\r\nCommons as favourable to the Government.\r\n\r\nLord John alludes for the first time in his letter to a question\r\non which the Queen has not hitherto expressed her opinion to him\r\npersonally, viz., how far the proposed new arrangement of Lord John's\r\nholding the leadership of the House of Commons without office was\r\nconstitutional or not?[6] Her opinion perfectly agrees with that\r\nexpressed by Mr Walpole to Lord John. If the intended arrangement were\r\n_undoubtedly illegal_ it would clearly never have been contemplated at\r\nall; but it may prove a _dangerous precedent_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would have been quite prepared to give the proposition\r\nof the Speaker \"that the leadership of the House of Commons was so\r\nlaborious, that an Office without other duties ought to be assigned\r\nto it,\" her fullest and fairest consideration, upon its merits and its\r\nconstitutional bearings, which ought to have been distinctly set forth\r\nbefore her by her constitutional advisers for her final and unfettered\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nWhat the Queen complains of, and, as she believes with justice, is,\r\nthat so important an innovation in the construction of the executive\r\nGovernment should have been practically decided upon by an arrangement\r\nintended to meet personal wants under peculiar and accidental\r\ncircumstances, leaving the Queen the embarrassing alternative only,\r\neither to forego the exercise of her own prerogative, or to damage by\r\nher own act the _formation_ or _stability_ of the new Government, both\r\nof paramount importance to the welfare of the Country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See _ante_, pp. 417, 421.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _13th February 1853._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

Count Colloredo then said that he had another and more\r\ndisagreeable subject to discuss with Lord Clarendon. He commenced\r\nby reading a note from Count Buol[8] complaining bitterly of the\r\nrefugees, and the manner in which they abused the hospitality\r\nafforded them in this country, and attributing in great measure to the\r\nproclamations of Kossuth and Mazzini the late insurrection at Milan,\r\nand the attempt on the Emperor's life.[9] This note expressed a\r\nhope and belief that some measure would at once be adopted by\r\nyour Majesty's Government to remove the just complaints of\r\nAllied Governments, and intimated that should this hope not\r\nbe _spontaneously_ realised some measures on the part of those\r\nGovernments would become necessary for their own protection as well as\r\nto mark their sense of the wrong done to them by England.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon said that your Majesty's Government were as indignant\r\nas that of Austria could be at the disgraceful abuse of the protection\r\nafforded to these refugees; but he could hold out no hope of any\r\nlegislation for the purpose of sending them out of the country.\r\n\r\nCount Colloredo did not disguise his annoyance and disappointment at\r\nthis, and seemed to attribute it to want of goodwill on the part of\r\nyour Majesty's Government, which he felt sure would have the support\r\nof public opinion in proposing such a measure as his Government\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe discussion became rather warm, and Lord Clarendon thought it\r\nright to remark that too much importance might be given to these\r\nproclamations and too little to the causes which at home might lead\r\nthe subjects of Austria to manifest their discontent by revolutionary\r\noutbreaks, nor could we conceal from ourselves that the complaints\r\nabout the refugees were occasionally directed against the free\r\ninstitutions which gave them protection, and that we were not always\r\nviewed with favour as presenting the single but prosperous exception\r\nto that system of government which otherwise would now almost be\r\nuniform in Europe.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Austrian Ambassador.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Austrian Prime Minister.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Kossuth and Mazzini were in England, prosecuting\r\n    their schemes against Austria; the Austrian Government\r\n    attributed to them the Milanese rising, and the recent attempt\r\n    to assassinate the Emperor Francis Joseph at Vienna.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: The Refugee Question was debated in the House of\r\n    Lords on the 4th of March.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _9th March 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Palmerston's letter, and the reports on\r\nthe Militia which she returns, having marked several parts in them\r\nwhich show an absence of the most important requisites.

I trust that the bitter cold weather we have now again\r\nwill not displease you. I fear Albert's heavy cold will not be the\r\nbetter by the east wind which makes one shiver. I am thunderstruck by\r\na telegraph despatch from Marseilles of the 17th, which declares that\r\nPrince Menschikoff has not succeeded, and has therefore given orders\r\nfor the Russian fleet to come to Constantinople.[11] Heaven grant\r\nthat these news may not be true, though bad news generally turn out\r\ncorrect. I am so sorry to see the Emperor Nicholas, who had been so\r\nwise and dignified since 1848, become so very unreasonable. In Austria\r\nthey are still a good deal excited. One can hardly feel astonished\r\nconsidering circumstances; I trust that reflection may induce them to\r\nmodify their measures. The Italian Nobles have shown themselves great\r\nfools by acting as they have done, and thereby giving an opening to\r\nsocial revolution. By some accident we have been within these few days\r\nwell informed of some of the movements of the good people that enjoy\r\nan asylum in England. Kossuth is now the great director and favourite,\r\nand Republics are everywhere to spring up, till he (Kossuth) is to be\r\nagain Dictator or Emperor somewhere....

He encloses\r\na letter from Lord Cowley, which shows a considerable degree of\r\nirritation on the part of the French Government, and of embarrassment\r\nin consequence of the rash step they have taken in ordering the\r\ndeparture of their fleet from Toulon to the Greek Waters.[12] If no\r\ncatastrophe should take place at Constantinople, as Lord Aberdeen\r\nhopes and believes, this irritation will probably subside, and they\r\nmay find us useful in assisting them to escape from their difficulty\r\nwith respect to the \"Holy Places.\"\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen has seen the Instructions of Prince Menschikoff, which\r\nrelate exclusively to the claims of the Greek Church at Jerusalem; and\r\nalthough these conditions may humiliate Turkey, and wound the vanity\r\nof France, there is nothing whatever to justify the reproach\r\nof territorial aggression, or hostile ambition. If the Turkish\r\nGovernment, relying upon the assistance of England and France, should\r\nremain obstinate, the affair might become serious; but even then, Lord\r\nAberdeen is convinced that no final step will be taken by the Emperor,\r\nwithout previous communication to England.\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon the personal character of Prince Menschikoff. If\r\nhe can command himself sufficiently to wait for the arrival of Lord\r\nStratford, Lord Aberdeen does not doubt that the matter will be\r\nsettled, without coming to extremities....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Even before the Conference met, Menschikoff's\r\n    overbearing conduct and demeanour had induced Napoleon to\r\n    despatch the French Fleet from Toulon to Salamis, to watch\r\n    events.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CZAR CONCILIATORY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd March 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of yesterday, and\r\nreturns Lord Cowley's. Everything appears to her to depend upon the\r\nreal nature of the demands made by Russia, and the Queen was therefore\r\nglad to hear from Lord Aberdeen that he found nothing in Prince\r\nMenschikoff's instructions to justify the reproach of territorial\r\naggression or hostile ambition. Still the mode of proceeding at\r\nConstantinople is not such as would be resorted to towards a \"sick\r\nfriend for whose life there exists much solicitude.\" This ought\r\nclearly to be stated to Baron Brunnow, in the Queen's opinion.\r\n\r\nThe two Drafts to Sir H. Seymour and Lord Cowley struck the Queen as\r\nvery temperate, conciliatory, and dignified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_29th March 1853._\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and humbly\r\nbegs to state that he had this afternoon a satisfactory interview with\r\nthe French Ambassador, who told him that the Emperor had to a certain\r\nextent been deceived upon the Eastern Question, and that he had given\r\nhis decision without fully considering the matter in all its bearings.\r\nBut that he had since viewed it in a different light, and had so\r\nfar recognised the propriety of the course adopted by your Majesty's\r\nGovernment, that if the sailing order had not been improperly\r\npublished in the _Moniteur_ the French Fleet should not have quitted\r\nToulon.\r\n\r\nCount Walewski further stated that _the Persons_ who had thus advised\r\nthe Emperor, finding that their views were not supported by facts as\r\nthey hoped, had endeavoured to throw the blame upon England and to\r\nshow that France had been abandoned and Russia preferred by your\r\nMajesty's Government, and that hence had arisen the want of cordiality\r\nand good feeling with respect to which Lord Clarendon some days ago\r\nspoke to Count Walewski. He, however, assured Lord Clarendon that all\r\nthis had now passed away, and that the Emperor was as anxious as\r\never for a good understanding with England, and particularly upon\r\nall matters connected with the East. Lord Clarendon expressed\r\ngreat satisfaction that this momentary difference between the two\r\nGovernments should be at an end.\r\n\r\nCount Walewski in confidence requested Lord Clarendon to impress\r\nupon Lord Cowley the necessity of often seeing the Emperor, and not\r\ntrusting to the Minister, when any question of difficulty arose.\r\n\r\nCount Walewski said the Emperor was particularly anxious that your\r\nMajesty should know that the liberation of the Madiai[13] was owing to\r\nthe interference which the French Legation had been instructed by the\r\nEmperor to use in their behalf.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Two persons, husband and wife, domiciled in\r\n    Florence, who had embraced the English reformed religion.

Lords Shaftesbury and Roden went\r\n    to Florence and appealed to the Grand Duke on their behalf,\r\n    but were unsuccessful.

She had been much surprised to hear from Lord John Russell on\r\nthe 24th that \"in concert with Sir Charles Wood and Sir James Graham,\r\nhe had settled last night to propose to the Cabinet on Wednesday to\r\ndelay the measure (on the Indian Government) till next Session, and\r\nthat Sir James Graham had stated that Lord Aberdeen would be ready\r\nto assent to this course.\"[16] She did not answer Lord John until she\r\nshould have heard from Lord Aberdeen himself. From the explanation he\r\nhas now given to the Queen, she must say that it would have a _very\r\nbad_ effect if the measure were withdrawn at the eleventh hour, and\r\nafter all that has been publicly and privately stated.[17] Nothing\r\ndamages a Government more than the appearance of vacillation and\r\nuncertainty of purpose, and no Government ought to shun this more\r\nthan the _present_. The fact of a dissension in the Cabinet on a vital\r\npoint, which it cannot be hoped will remain concealed, must besides\r\nmuch impair its vigour and power....\r\n\r\nThe Queen earnestly hopes that it will not become necessary to change\r\nthe course announced by the Government.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: The India Bill, which passed during the Session,\r\n    threw open the lucrative patronage of the Company (whose\r\n    existence was continued but with less absolute control) to\r\n    competition.

The young Emperor[18] I confess I like\r\nmuch, there is much sense and courage in his warm blue eye, and it is\r\nnot without a very amiable merriment when there is occasion for it.\r\nHe is slight and very graceful, but even in the _melee_ of dancers and\r\nArchdukes, and all in uniform, he may always be distinguished as\r\nthe _Chef_. This struck me more than anything, as now at Vienna the\r\ndancing is also that general _melee_ which renders waltzing most\r\ndifficult.... The manners are excellent and free from pompousness or\r\nawkwardness of any kind, simple, and when he is graciously disposed,\r\nas he was to me, _sehr herzlich und natuerlich_. He keeps every one\r\nin great order without requiring for this an _outre_ appearance of\r\nauthority, merely because he is the master, and there is that about\r\nhim which gives authority, and which sometimes those _who have the\r\nauthority cannot succeed in getting accepted or in practising_. I\r\nthink he may be severe _si l'occasion se presente_; he has something\r\nvery _muthig_. We were several times surrounded by people of all\r\nclasses, and he certainly quite at their mercy, but I never saw his\r\nlittle _muthig_ expression changed either by being pleased or alarmed.\r\nI trust that this family connection may mitigate the only impression\r\nwhich in Austria has created a hostile feeling, viz. the suspicions\r\nin Palmerston's time that it had become a plan of England _to\r\ndestroy_ the Austrian Empire. After the _attentat_ on the Emperor the\r\nimpression on those who are attached to their country was, and\r\nstill is, that in England a sort of menagerie of Kossuths, Mazzinis,\r\nLagranges, Ledru Rollins, etc., is kept to be let occasionally loose\r\non the Continent to render its quiet and prosperity impossible. That\r\nimpression, which Lord Aberdeen stated in the House of Lords at the\r\nend of April, is strong everywhere on the Continent, in Prussia as it\r\nis in Austria, and even here our _industriels_ are convinced of it.\r\nAbout what is to be done by way of graciousness on your part we will\r\nconsider. ...Ever, my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Francis Joseph, Emperor of Austria.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Newcastle to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_7th June 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nhas the honour of bringing under your Majesty's notice a desire for\r\nsome time past felt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and by others\r\ninterested in the welfare of the Church of England in the Colonies,\r\nthat the extensive See of Capetown should be divided, and that a new\r\nBishopric of Grahamstown should be erected.\r\n\r\nAn endowment of L10,000 for the proposed See has lately been provided\r\nby the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle under these circumstances hopes that your\r\nMajesty will approve of the erection of this new See, and has the\r\nhonour to recommend to your Majesty that, in that case the Rev.

It is a sad sight, and one which keeps\r\nme in a constant state of anxiety, as one is afraid of saying or doing\r\nanything which may pain or distress him, or of his meeting with any\r\naccident; but he manages it wonderfully well, hardly ever makes a\r\nmistake, and manages so well at dinner. He is very cheerful, kind,\r\nand civil, and would be very good looking if it were not for his poor\r\neyes. He likes to go everywhere and do everything like anybody else,\r\nand speaks of things _as if he saw_ them....\r\n\r\nThe Oriental Question is at a standstill.

Lord Aberdeen is at this\r\nmoment ignorant of his real views and intentions. He has been recently\r\nmore than once thwarted in his endeavours to press a hostile policy\r\nupon the Cabinet; and it has been reported to Lord Aberdeen that he\r\nhas expressed himself in terms of great hostility. This cannot perhaps\r\nbe avoided, and is only the result of taking different views of the\r\npublic interest; but it is very essential that Lord Palmerston should\r\nhave no personal or private cause of complaint against Lord Aberdeen.\r\nFrom his office of Home Secretary he might naturally expect to have\r\nthe honour of attending your Majesty; and should this not be the\r\ncase he might probably resent it and attribute it to the jealousy and\r\nill-will of Lord Aberdeen. But whether he did this, or not, himself,\r\nthe Public and the Press would not fail to do so, and would convert\r\nthis neglect into the ground of the most hostile and bitter attacks.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty may perhaps be aware that there is no amount of flattery\r\nwhich is not offered to Lord Palmerston by the Tory party, with the\r\nhope of separating him altogether from the Government.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen fully admits that this step which he has humbly proposed\r\nto your Majesty may fail to produce any good effect, and that it may\r\neven be turned hereafter to the injury of the Government; but, at\r\nall events, Lord Aberdeen's conscience will be clear; and if Lord\r\nPalmerston has any generous feelings, it is not impossible that he\r\nmay appreciate favourably a proceeding which cannot but afford him\r\npersonal satisfaction.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: Lord Aberdeen had suggested that it would be\r\n    advisable for several reasons that Lord Palmerston should\r\n    be invited to Balmoral as Minister in attendance, and he\r\n    accordingly went there on the 15th of September.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _24th September 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has this morning received Lord Clarendon's letter of the\r\n22nd inst. She has not been surprised at the line taken by Austria,\r\nwho, Lord Clarendon will remember, the Queen never thought could\r\nbe depended upon, as she is not in that independent position which\r\nrenders a National Policy possible. The accounts from Constantinople\r\nare very alarming, and make the Queen most anxious for the future. She\r\nquite approves of the steps taken by the Government. The presence of\r\nthe Fleets at Constantinople in case of general disturbance will take\r\nfrom the Emperor of Russia what Lord Cowley calls his _coup de Theatre\r\na la Sadlers Wells_, viz.: the part of the generous protector of the\r\nSultan and restorer of Order.[24]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell led the\r\n    war party in the Cabinet; but the latter was pledged to the\r\n    introduction of a Reform Bill, while the former was opposed\r\n    to the scheme. Lord Aberdeen's pacific views were making him\r\n    increasingly unpopular in the country.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Even after the Russian occupation of the\r\n    Principalities, which the Russian Minister, Count Nesselrode,\r\n    had described as not an act of war, but a material guarantee\r\n    for the concession by Turkey of the Russian demands,\r\n    the resources of diplomacy were not exhausted. The Four\r\n    Powers--England, France, Austria, and Prussia--agreed, in\r\n    conference at Vienna, to present a note for acceptance by\r\n    Russia and the Porte, to the effect (_inter alia_) that the\r\n    Government of the Sultan would remain faithful \"to the letter\r\n    and to the spirit of the Treaties of Kainardji and Adrianople\r\n    relative to the protection of the Christian religion.\" This\r\n    was most unfortunately worded, but, however, the clause had\r\n    obtained the sanction of the English Government, and the\r\n    Czar expressed his willingness to accept it. Lord Stratford,\r\n    however, saw the danger underlying the ambiguity of the\r\n    language, and, under his advice, the Porte proposed as an\r\n    amendment the substitution of the words \"to the stipulations\r\n    of the Treaty of Kainardji, confirmed by that of Adrianople,\r\n    relative to the protection by the Sublime Porte of the\r\n    Christian religion.\" The Russian Government refused to accept\r\n    this amendment, and from that moment war was inevitable. The\r\n    British Fleet under Admiral Dundas had been sent from Malta to\r\n    the East at the beginning of June.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE VIENNA NOTE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _25th September 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of the 23rd, and is very\r\nthankful to him for this full and lucid statement of the present very\r\ncritical situation.\r\n\r\nShe transmits to him a memorandum containing our views, drawn up\r\nby the Prince with the desire he might also communicate it to Lord\r\nClarendon.[25]\r\n\r\nThe Queen must say she now rejoices the Fleets should be on their way\r\nto Constantinople.\r\n\r\nGod grant that any outbreak at Constantinople may yet be averted.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: The Memorandum stated that it would be fruitless\r\n    further to attempt to settle the dispute by the \"Redaction\" of\r\n    Notes to be exchanged between Turkey and Russia, or the\r\n    choice of particular words and expressions in public documents\r\n    designed in order to avoid naming the real objects in dispute.\r\n\r\n    \"It is evident\" (it was added) \"that Russia has hitherto\r\n    attempted to deceive us in pretending that she did not aim\r\n    at the acquisition of any _new_ Right, but required only a\r\n    satisfaction of honour and a re-acknowledgment of the Rights\r\n    she already possessed by Treaty; that she _does intend_ and\r\n    for the first time lays bare that intention, to acquire _new_\r\n    Rights of interference which the Porte does _not_ wish to\r\n    concede and cannot concede, and which the European Powers have\r\n    repeatedly declared she _ought not_ to concede....\r\n\r\n    \"If the views of Russia, for instance, with regard to\r\n    'Modification III. of the Note,' were to prevail, the\r\n    extension of the advantages and privileges enjoyed by\r\n    Christian communities, in their capacity as _foreigners_,\r\n    to the Greeks generally, with the Right granted to Russia\r\n    to intercede for them to this effect, would simply make\r\n    foreigners of 10,000,000 of the subjects of the Porte, or\r\n    depose the Sultan as their sovereign, putting the Emperor of\r\n    Russia in his place.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _6th October 1853._\r\n\r\n... The Cabinet will meet to-morrow; and Lord Aberdeen will have\r\nthe honour of humbly reporting to your Majesty the result of their\r\ndiscussions. It will be Lord Aberdeen's endeavour to prevent any rash\r\ndecision; and, above all, to keep open the possibility of peaceful\r\ncommunications. No doubt, it may be very agreeable to humiliate the\r\nEmperor of Russia; but Lord Aberdeen thinks that it is paying a little\r\ntoo dear for this pleasure, to check the progress and prosperity of\r\nthis happy country, and to cover Europe with confusion, misery, and\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MOVEMENTS OF THE FLEET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _7th October 1853._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty. As your\r\nMajesty will expect to hear from him to-day, he has the honour of\r\naddressing your Majesty, although he could wish that it had been in\r\nhis power to give your Majesty a more full and satisfactory account\r\nof the decisions of the Cabinet. The meeting was very long, and\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion prevailed in the course of the\r\ndiscussion. At length, however, Lord Aberdeen is happy to say there\r\nwas such an agreement as ensured a certain degree of unanimity. With\r\nthis view, it was determined to adhere to a defensive principle\r\nof action in the East. The Fleets may perhaps be already at\r\nConstantinople; but, at all events, they are to be brought there\r\nforthwith, and to be stationed either there or in the Bosphorus,\r\nunless the Russians should cross the Danube, or make any attack upon\r\nthe Turkish possessions on the coast of the Black Sea. In this case,\r\nthe combined Fleets would enter the Black Sea, for the defence of the\r\nTurkish territory.\r\n\r\nConsidering the position we have already assumed in this unfortunate\r\naffair, perhaps it was impossible to do less than this; and as there\r\nis very little chance of Russia undertaking any active hostilities\r\nof the nature apprehended, it may reasonably be hoped that no actual\r\ncollision will take place. At the same time it must be recollected\r\nthat Russia will regard the entrance of line of battle-ships into the\r\nBlack Sea as a virtual declaration of war against herself.\r\n\r\nThere is yet no confirmation of the actual declaration of war by\r\nthe Porte, and although there is no reason to suspect any serious\r\nimpediment to the decision of the Divan being fulfilled, it is rather\r\nstrange that intelligence to this effect has not been received. If\r\nLord Stratford should see great cause for apprehension at the prospect\r\nof the Turks in the prosecution of hostilities, it is just possible\r\nthat by his influence he may have arrested the progress of their\r\nwarlike measures; but probably this is too much to hope. At all\r\nevents, Lord Aberdeen trusts that the path of negotiation is not\r\nfinally closed, and that, notwithstanding the equivocal position of\r\nGreat Britain in this contest, it may still be possible to employ\r\nwords of conciliation and peace....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: WAR IMMINENT]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN OVERBORNE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _10th October 1853._\r\n\r\nI had a long interview with Sir James Graham this morning, and told\r\nhim that Lord Aberdeen's last letter to the Queen and him[26] made us\r\nvery uneasy. It was evident that Lord Aberdeen was, against his\r\nbetter judgment, consenting to a course of policy which he inwardly\r\ncondemned, that his desire to maintain unanimity at the Cabinet led\r\nto concessions which by degrees altered the whole character of the\r\npolicy, while he held out no hope of being able permanently to secure\r\nagreement. I described the Queen's position as a very painful one.\r\nHere were decisions taken by the Cabinet, perhaps even acted upon,\r\ninvolving the most momentous consequences, without her previous\r\nconcurrence or even the means for her to judge of the propriety or\r\nimpropriety of course to be adopted, with evidence that the Minister,\r\nin whose judgment the Queen placed her chief reliance, disapproved\r\nof it. The position was morally and constitutionally a wrong one. The\r\nQueen ought to have the whole policy in spirit and ultimate tendency\r\ndeveloped before her to give her deliberate sanction to it, knowing\r\nwhat it involved her in abroad and at home. She might now be involved\r\nin war, of which the consequences could not be calculated, chiefly by\r\nthe desire of Lord Aberdeen to keep his Cabinet together; this might\r\nthen break down, and the Queen would be left without an efficient\r\nGovernment, and a war on her hands. Lord Aberdeen renounced one of his\r\nchief sources of strength in the Cabinet, by not making it apparent\r\nthat he requires the sanction of the Crown to the course proposed by\r\nthe Cabinet, and has to justify his advice by argument before it can\r\nbe adopted, and that it does not suffice to come to a decision at the\r\ntable of the Cabinet. Sir James Graham perfectly coincided with this\r\nview and offered to go up to Town immediately. The Queen wrote the\r\nletter to Lord Aberdeen ... which Sir James takes up with him. He\r\nshall arrive at Windsor on Friday (14th), and Lord Aberdeen is to have\r\nan Audience on Saturday. Sir James will tell him that the Queen wants\r\nhis deliberate opinion on what course is best to be followed, and\r\nthat the course once adopted should be steadily and uninterruptedly\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26:\r\n\r\n    _The Earl of Aberdeen to Sir James Graham._\r\n    [_Submitted to the Queen._]\r\n\r\n    ARGYLL HOUSE, _8th October 1853._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR GRAHAM,--... When we met, Clarendon made a sort of\r\n    _resume_ of what had taken place before we all separated, but\r\n    ended with no specific proposal. After a few interlocutory\r\n    remarks from different quarters, Palmerston proposed his plan.\r\n    Lord John faintly supported it in general terms, but did not\r\n    seem much in earnest about it. I said that it appeared to\r\n    involve the necessity of a declaration of war against Russia,\r\n    and the calling together Parliament forthwith. Gladstone\r\n    strongly argued against the proposal. Clarendon then read\r\n    an outline of his proposed instructions, which were a great\r\n    abatement from Palmerston's plan. We came at last to a sort\r\n    of compromise; our great difficulty being now to deal with the\r\n    question of entering the Black Sea. I consented to this being\r\n    done, provided it was strictly in defence of some point of\r\n    attack on Turkish territory. I have no fear that this will\r\n    take place; and as long as we abstain from entering the Black\r\n    Sea, Peace may be possible between us and Russia. We have thus\r\n    assumed a strictly defensive position, which for the\r\n    moment may be sufficient, and will enable us to carry on\r\n    negotiations; but this cannot last long. Under the character\r\n    of defensive war, we should inevitably become extensively\r\n    engaged. Should the Turks be at all worsted, which is\r\n    probable, of course we must increase our assistance. We\r\n    should have a French army, and perhaps English money--all for\r\n    defence.\r\n\r\n    The aspect of the Cabinet was, on the whole, very good.\r\n    Gladstone, active and energetic for Peace; Argyll, Herbert,\r\n    C. Wood, and Granville, all in the same sense. Newcastle,\r\n    not quite so much so, but good; Lansdowne, not so warlike\r\n    as formerly; Lord John warlike enough, but subdued in\r\n    tone; Palmerston urged his views perseveringly, but not\r\n    disagreeably. The Chancellor said little, but was cordially\r\n    peaceful. Molesworth was not present, there having been some\r\n    mistake in sending the notice.\r\n\r\n    On the whole, therefore, yesterday passed off well enough;\r\n    but we shall see what to-day will bring us. Not a syllable was\r\n    said in the Cabinet on any other subject. Lord John seemed\r\n    in good humour; he came to see me a few minutes before the\r\n    Cabinet. I told you that I had spoken to Gladstone very\r\n    fully; but I did not press any decision respecting _domestic_\r\n    matters, as it would at this moment be quite unseasonable.\r\n    Nevertheless, it must not be forgotten altogether. Yours,\r\n    etc., etc.,\r\n\r\n    ABERDEEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD STRATFORD'S INSTRUCTIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _11th October 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letter. She had written to\r\nLord Aberdeen that she felt it her duty to pause before giving her\r\nconsent to the measures decided on in the Cabinet, until she should\r\nhave received an explanation on the views which dictated that\r\ndecision, and of the ulterior steps involved in it; and Sir James\r\nGraham is gone up to Town, verbally to explain more fully the Queen's\r\nfeelings. She has now received and read the Despatches, which have\r\nin the meantime been sent off to their points of destination without\r\nhaving received her sanction!\r\n\r\nThe draft to Vienna the Queen thinks very ably argued, and justly to\r\ndefine the present position of the question at issue.[27]\r\n\r\nThe instructions to Lord Stratford,[28] on the other hand, appear to\r\nher very vague, and entrusting him with enormous powers and a latitude\r\nof discretion which is hardly to be called safe. As matters have now\r\nbeen arranged, it appears to the Queen, moreover, that we have taken\r\non ourselves in conjunction with France all the risks of a European\r\nwar, without having bound Turkey to any conditions with respect to\r\nprovoking it. The hundred and twenty fanatical Turks constituting the\r\nDivan at Constantinople are left sole judges of the line of policy\r\nto be pursued, and made cognisant at the same time of the fact\r\nthat England and France have bound themselves to defend the Turkish\r\nTerritory! This is entrusting them with a power which Parliament has\r\nbeen jealous to confide even to the hands of the British Crown. It may\r\nbe a question whether England ought to go to war for the defence of\r\nso-called Turkish Independence; but there can be none that if she does\r\nso, she ought to be the sole judge of what constitutes a breach\r\nof that independence, and have the fullest power to prevent by\r\nnegotiation the breaking out of the war.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would wish copies of the enclosed papers to be sent for her\r\nuse as soon as convenient.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: In this despatch Lord Clarendon, after referring\r\n    to the interpretation which Count Nesselrode had put upon the\r\n    Vienna Note, and the Russian rejection of it as amended by\r\n    the Porte, told Lord Westmorland that it would be useless and\r\n    dishonourable to recommend it in its unaltered form, that the\r\n    Czar was contending for privileges for Christian subjects\r\n    of the Porte not hitherto enjoyed by them, and that a war\r\n    embarked upon in such a cause would be without parallel in\r\n    history.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: Authority had been given to Lord Stratford to\r\n    employ the British Fleet in the manner he might deem most fit\r\n    for defending Turkish territory from aggression, and he was\r\n    instructed that if the Russian Fleet left Sebastopol, the\r\n    British Fleet was to pass through the Bosphorus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RESENTMENT OF THE CZAR]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN AND THE PREMIERSHIP]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _16th October 1853._\r\n\r\nWe saw Lord Aberdeen yesterday. He went with us through the whole\r\nof the proceedings of the last six weeks with respect to the Eastern\r\nQuestion. Regretted Count Nesselrode's Note,[29] which Baron Brunnow\r\nowned nobody would regret more than the Count himself, acknowledged\r\nthe weakness of Austria, felt sure of Lord Stratford's insincerity\r\ntowards him and the Government,... as he had to Lord Aberdeen's\r\ncertain knowledge called \"the conduct of the Government infamous\" and\r\ndeclared \"he would let the world know that his name was Canning.\" He\r\nacknowledged the disadvantage of the course adopted by the Cabinet,\r\nwhich left the Turks at liberty to do as they pleased; he had to\r\nconcede this to the Cabinet, which would otherwise have been broken\r\nup by Lord John and Lord Palmerston. Had he known what the Queen's\r\nopinion was, he might have been more firm, feeling himself supported\r\nby the Crown, but he had imagined from her letters that there was more\r\nanimosity against Russia and leaning to war in her mind.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: In this despatch to Baron Meyendorff, the\r\n    Austrian Foreign Minister, the Count had disclosed the fact\r\n    that the Russian interpretation of the Vienna Note differed\r\n    from that of the other Powers.]\r\n\r\nYet, under all the adverse circumstances Lord Aberdeen saw still\r\nreason for hope that a peaceable settlement could be obtained. The\r\nFrench were ready to do anything we pleased, go to war, remain at\r\npeace, etc., etc.; in fact, Louis Napoleon had experienced the great\r\nadvantage for his position of the Alliance with England.... Lord\r\nStratford was thoroughly frightened, and had made a proposal himself,\r\nwhich accordingly he would support _con amore_. The Emperor of Russia\r\nhad failed in his attempt to form a Northern League against the\r\nWestern Powers.... The Emperor complained bitterly of the conduct\r\nof the Powers, who had disgraced him before the world by making him\r\naccept a Note, and sanctioning its alteration by Turkey; \"now they\r\nshould do what they pleased and settle matters with Turkey first, and\r\nbring him only what was settled and fixed, he was wearied of the whole\r\nbusiness, and anxious to get rid of it for ever.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Lord Aberdeen now proposed was to follow the Emperor's advice and\r\nagree with Turkey upon a Note, leaving out all that she had objected\r\nto in the Vienna Note as Lord Stratford recommended, and taking as\r\nmuch as possible Redschid Pasha's own words to found the proposal of\r\nit upon the declaration made by the Emperor at Olmuetz to the Powers,\r\nthat he sought for _no new_ right, privilege, or advantage, but solely\r\nfor the confirmation of the legal _status quo_, but accompanying this\r\nwith a declaration, that if Turkey created needless difficulties and\r\ntried to evade a peaceful settlement the Powers would withdraw their\r\nsupport and leave her to fight her own battle. We went over the\r\nDocuments which are not yet settled, even between Lord Aberdeen\r\nand Lord Clarendon, and will require the greatest caution in their\r\nwording. It is evident that the Turks have every inducement not to\r\nlet this opportunity slip in going to war with Russia, as they will\r\nprobably never find so advantageous a one again, as the whole of\r\nChristendom has declared them in the right, and they would fight with\r\nEngland and France actively on their side!\r\n\r\nAt home, Lord Aberdeen said matters do not stand much better. Lord\r\nJohn has convinced himself that, under present circumstances it\r\nwould not do for him to ask Lord Aberdeen to retire from the Prime\r\nMinistership and let him step in in his place; perhaps he has found\r\nout also that the Peelites will not serve under him; his own Whig\r\ncolleagues would very much regret if not object to such a change, and\r\nthat Lord Palmerston could not well submit to the arrangement. So\r\nhe told Lord Aberdeen that he had given up that idea; it was clear,\r\nhowever, that he was now looking for an opportunity to break up the\r\nGovernment on some popular ground, which it was impossible to hope\r\nthat he should not find. He now had asked for the immediate summoning\r\nof Parliament, called for by the state of the Oriental Question. This\r\nwould create the greatest alarm in the country, and embarrassment to\r\nthe Government, and was therefore resisted. Lord Aberdeen told Lord\r\nJohn quite plainly he knew what the proposal meant--he meant to break\r\nup the Government. \"I hope not,\" was Lord John's laughing reply.\r\n\r\nThe Queen taxed Lord Aberdeen with imprudence in talking to Lord\r\nJohn of his own readiness to leave office, which he acknowledged, but\r\ncalled _very natural_ in a man of seventy. Lord John was dissatisfied\r\nwith his position;... upon Lord Aberdeen telling him that he had the\r\nmost powerful and honourable position of any man in England as leader\r\nof the House of Commons, he answered, \"Oh, _there_ I am quite happy!\"\r\n\r\nI asked how under such circumstances that all-important measure of\r\nParliamentary Reform, upon which the future stability and well-being\r\nof the Country so much depended, was to be matured and brought\r\nforward? Lord Aberdeen replied that Lord John had it all ready and\r\nprepared in his pocket, and told Lord Aberdeen so, adding, however,\r\nthat under present circumstances there was no use in bringing it\r\nforward, to which Lord Aberdeen added: \"You mean unless you sit in the\r\nchair which I now occupy?\" Lord John laughed.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the probable consequences of Lord John's retirement. Lord\r\nAberdeen thought that Lord Palmerston, Lord Lansdowne, and even Lord\r\nClarendon would secede with him, but this by no means implied that the\r\nwhole party would; Lord Palmerston would not coalesce with Lord John,\r\nbut try for the lead himself; Lord Clarendon quite agreed with Lord\r\nAberdeen, and had been very angry with Lord John, but was personally\r\nunder great obligations to him, and Sir James Graham had (as he said)\r\nbeen very much struck with the change of tone in Lord Clarendon at\r\nthe last meeting of the Cabinet. Most of the Liberals seemed very much\r\npleased with their situation. Sir James Graham had, of his own accord,\r\ntold Lord Aberdeen that, in the event of Lord John's secession, he\r\nhimself could not well sit in the House of Commons under so much\r\nyounger a man as Mr Gladstone as Leader. He knew that there would be\r\nobjections to his assuming the lead himself, but he would be quite\r\nready to go to the House of Lords to support Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CZAR'S LETTER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Emperor of Russia to Queen Victoria._[30]\r\n\r\n              18\r\nTSARSKO, _ce_ -- _Octobre_ 1853.\r\n              30\r\n\r\nMADAME,--Votre Majeste connait, je l'espere, les sentiments\r\nd'affection sincere qui m'attachent a Sa personne, depuis que j'ai\r\neu l'honneur de L'approcher.

When he speaks of the sword which will not\r\nonly have to be drawn, but the scabbard thrown away, and says, the war\r\nto be successful must be a \"_very comprehensive one_\" on the part of\r\nEngland and France, the intention is unmistakable, and it becomes a\r\nserious question whether we are justified in allowing Lord Stratford\r\nany longer to remain in a situation which gives him the means of\r\nfrustrating all our efforts for peace. The question becomes still\r\ngraver when it is considered that General Baraguay d'Hilliers seems\r\nfrom Lord Cowley's account of his conversation with him equally\r\nanxious for extreme measures.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must express her surprise that Lord Stratford should have\r\ncoolly sent on so preposterous a proposal as Redschid Pasha's note\r\nasking for a Treaty of Alliance, the amalgamation of our Fleets with\r\nthe Turkish one, and the sending of our surplus ships to the \"_White_\"\r\nSea (!) without any hesitation or remark on his part. As the note\r\nends, however, by saying that the Porte desires _que les points\r\nci-dessus emenes (sic) soient apprecies par les Cours d'Angleterre\r\net de France, et que ces Cours veuillent bien declarer leur intention\r\nd'agir en consequence_, this appears to the Queen to afford an\r\nadmirable opportunity for stating plainly and strongly to the Turkish\r\nGovernment that we have _no intention_ of being used by them for their\r\nown purposes. This time such a declaration might be _handed in_ to the\r\nTurkish Government, so that there can be no mistake about the matter\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nThe Queen encloses the letter and note, and wishes Lord Aberdeen to\r\nshow her letter to Lord Clarendon.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Lord Stratford had written that Redschid Pasha\r\n    was unable to make head against his warlike colleagues, and\r\n    that unless some proposal of a decidedly satisfactory kind\r\n    should come from Vienna very soon, there would be no chance\r\n    of avoiding hostilities. Lord Stratford added that he had\r\n    obtained a promise that no act of hostility should take place\r\n    on the Turkish side before the expiration of fifteen days, and\r\n    concluded with the words: \"I fear that war is the decree of\r\n    Fate, and our wisest part will be to do what we can to bring\r\n    it to a thoroughly good conclusion.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN TO THE CZAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Emperor of Russia._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _ce 14 Novembre 1853._\r\n\r\nSIRE ET TRES CHER FRERE,--C'est avec une profonde et sincere\r\nsatisfaction que je viens de recevoir la lettre que V.M.I. a bien\r\nvoulu m'ecrire le 18/30 Octobre.

V.M. me connait assez\r\npour savoir combien ils sont reciproques.\r\n\r\nJe vous remercierai egalement, Sire, de la franchise avec laquelle\r\nvous me parlez des complications actuelles; je ne saurais mieux\r\nrepondre aux loyales intentions de V.M. qu'en lui exprimant a mon\r\ntour, et avec toute droiture, mes opinions a ce sujet, car c'est la,\r\nj'en suis sure, le meilleur moyen de conserver utilement une amitie\r\nbien veritable.\r\n\r\nJ'ai, mon cher Frere, conformement a votre desir, relu les\r\ncommunications confidentielles que vous avez bien voulu me faire, ce\r\nprintemps, par l'intermediaire du bon Sir Hamilton Seymour, et les\r\nreponses que mon Gouvernement a recu l'ordre d'adresser a V.M.\r\n\r\nBien qu'une difference d'opinion tres notable devint alors evidente\r\nentre V.M. et moi relativement a la maniere d'envisager l'etat de la\r\nTurquie et l'appreciation de sa vitalite, le Memorandum de V.M. en\r\ndate du 3/15 Avril vint neanmoins dissiper de la maniere la plus\r\nheureuse ces facheuses apprehensions; car il m'annoncait que, si nous\r\nn'etions pas d'accord sur _l'etat de sante_ de l'Empire Ottoman, nous\r\nl'etions cependant sur la necessite, pour le laisser vivre, de ne\r\npoint lui faire des demandes humiliantes, pourvu que tout le monde en\r\nagit de meme, et que personne n'abusat de sa faiblesse pour obtenir\r\ndes avantages exclusifs. V.M. dans ce but, daigna meme se declarer\r\nprete \"a travailler de concert avec l'Angleterre a l'[oe]uvre commune\r\nde prolonger l'existence de l'Empire Turque, en evitant toute cause\r\nd'alarme au sujet de sa dissolution.\"\r\n\r\nJ'avais de plus la conviction qu'il n'existait et ne pouvait\r\nexister au fond aucune divergence d'opinion entre nous au sujet des\r\nreclamations relatives aux Lieux-Saints, reclamations qui, j'avais\r\ndroit de le croire, constituaient le seul grief de la Russie contre la\r\nPorte.\r\n\r\nJe mets, Sire, la confiance la plus entiere dans la parole que V.M. a\r\nbien voulu me donner alors, et, que les assurances subsequentes, dues\r\na votre amitie, sont venues confirmer, en me donnant la connaissance\r\nde Vos intentions. Personne n'apprecie plus que moi la haute loyaute\r\nde V.M., et je voudrais que les convictions que j'ai a cet egard\r\npussent seules resoudre toutes les difficultes. Mais quelle que soit\r\nla purete des motifs qui dirigent les actions du Souverain meme le\r\nplus eleve par le caractere, V.M. sait que ses qualites personnelles\r\nne sont point suffisantes dans des transactions internationales par\r\nlesquelles un Etat se lie envers un autre en de solennels engagements;\r\net les veritables intentions de V.M. ont ete a coup sur meconnues et\r\nmal interpretees, a cause de la forme donnee au reclamations adressees\r\na la Porte.\r\n\r\nAyant a c[oe]ur, Sire, d'examiner ce qui avait pu produire ce facheux\r\nmalentendu, mon attention a ete naturellement attiree par l'article\r\n7 du Traite de Kainardji; et je dois dire a V.M. qu'apres avoir\r\nconsulte, sur le sens qui pouvait avoir ete attache a cet article,\r\nles personnes les plus competentes de ce pays-ci; apres l'avoir relu\r\nensuite moi-meme, avec le plus sincere desir d'impartialite, je suis\r\narrivee a la conviction que cet article n'etait point susceptible de\r\nl'extension qu'on y a voulu donner. Tous les amis de V.M. ont, comme\r\nmoi, la certitude que vous n'auriez point abuse du pouvoir, que vous\r\neut ainsi ete accorde; mais une demande de ce genre, pouvait a peine\r\netre acceptee par un Souverain qui tient a son independance.\r\n\r\nJe ne cacherai pas davantage a V.M. l'impression douloureuse qu'a\r\nproduit sur moi l'occupation des Principautes. Cette occupation a\r\ncause, depuis les quatres derniers mois, une perturbation generale\r\nen Europe, et pourrait amener des evenements ulterieurs que je\r\ndeplorerais d'un commun accord avec V.M. Mais, comme les intentions\r\nde V.M. envers la Porte sont, je le sais, amicales et desinteressees,\r\nj'ai toute confiance que vous trouverez le moyen de les exprimer et\r\nmettre a execution de maniere a detourner de plus graves dangers,\r\nque tous mes efforts, je vous assure, tendront sans cesse a empecher.\r\nL'attention impartiale avec laquelle j'ai suivi les causes qui ont\r\nfait echouer jusqu'a present toutes les tentatives de conciliation,\r\nme donne la ferme conviction qu'il n'existe pas d'obstacle reel qui ne\r\npuisse etre ecarte ou promptement surmonte avec l'assistance de V.M.\r\n\r\nJe n'abandonne point l'espoir de cet heureux resultat, meme apres les\r\ntristes conflits qui ont fait couler le sang dans les Principautes;\r\ncar j'ai la foi en Dieu que lorsque de toute part les intentions\r\nsont droites et lorsque les interets bien entendus sont communs, le\r\nTout-Puissant ne permettra pas que l'Europe entiere qui contient\r\ndeja tant d'elements inflammables, soit exposee a une conflagration\r\ngenerale.\r\n\r\nQue Dieu veille sur les jours de V.M.; et croyez, Sire, a\r\nl'attachement sincere avec lequel je suis, Sire et cher Frere, de\r\nvotre Majeste Imperiale, la bien bonne S[oe]ur et Amie,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nAlbert est tres sensible au souvenir de V.M. et me prie de le mettre a\r\nvos pieds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN'S SCRUPLES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _26th November 1853._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty. The Cabinet\r\nmet to-day for the consideration of the overtures made by the French\r\nGovernment for the settlement of the Eastern Question.[32] These\r\nproposals were in substance adopted; although a considerable change\r\nwas made in their form, and in some of their details. The step now\r\ntaken is evidently wise; but Lord Aberdeen can scarcely venture\r\nto hope that it will be attended with success. Pacific language is\r\naccompanied with insulting and hostile acts; and it remains to be seen\r\nwhat effect will be produced on the Emperor of Russia by the entrance\r\nof English and French ships of war into the Black Sea, under the\r\npretext of bringing off Consuls from Varna, and of looking after the\r\ngrain-ships at the Sulina mouth of the Danube. This information has\r\nhitherto been only communicated by telegraph; but it is calculated\r\nto lead to serious consequences, of which Lord Stratford must be\r\nperfectly well aware.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: The Emperor had made certain suggestions to Lord\r\n    Cowley, which the British Government were willing to adopt;\r\n    but the anti-Russian feeling was increasing daily in the\r\n    nation, and, as will be seen from the Queen's letter of the\r\n    27th of November, Lord Stratford seemed resolved on war.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _27th November 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of yesterday. She is\r\nsorry to find that after all a considerable change was made in the\r\nform of the French proposal. She is not aware at present of what that\r\nchange consists in and is therefore unable to form an opinion as\r\nto the effects of its introduction, but she quite concurs in Lord\r\nAberdeen's apprehensions with regard to the effect of Lord Stratford's\r\norders to the Fleet. The perusal of Lord Stratford's Despatches of the\r\n5th inst. has given the Queen the strongest impression that, whilst\r\nguarding himself against the possibility of being called to account\r\nfor acting in opposition to his instructions, he is pushing us deeper\r\nand deeper into the War policy which we wish to escape. Wherefore\r\nshould three poor Turkish steamers go to the Crimea, but to beard the\r\nRussian Fleet and tempt it to come out of Sebastopol, which would thus\r\nconstitute the much desired contingency for our combined Fleets to\r\nattack it, and so engage us irretrievably!\r\n\r\nThe Queen must seriously call upon Lord Aberdeen and the Cabinet to\r\nconsider whether they are justified in allowing such a state of things\r\nto continue!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CZAR TO THE QUEEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Emperor of Russia to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n                     2\r\nS.

Je ne fatiguerais certes pas l'attention de votre\r\nMajeste par un examen detaille du sens qu'elle donne a l'article 7 du\r\nTraite de Kainardji; j'assurerais seulement, Madame, que depuis 80 ans\r\nla Russie et la Porte l'ont compris ainsi que nous le faisons encore.\r\nCe sens-la n'a ete interrompu qu'en derniers temps, a la suite\r\nd'instigations que votre Majeste connait aussi bien que moi.\r\nLe retablir dans son reception primitive et la justifier par un\r\nengagement plus solennel, tel est le but de mes efforts, tel il sera,\r\nMadame, quand meme le sang devrait couler encore contre mon v[oe]u le\r\nplus ardent; parce que c'est une question vitale pour la Russie, et\r\nmes efforts ne lui sont impossibles pour y satisfaire.\r\n\r\nSi j'ai du occuper les Principautes, ce que je regrette autant que\r\nvotre Majeste, c'est encore Madame, parce que les libertes dont ces\r\nprovinces jouissent, leurs ont ete acquises _au prix du sang Russe, et\r\npar moi-meme Madame les annees_ 1828 _et_ 29.

As Lord John Russell will have the honour of seeing your Majesty\r\nto-morrow, he will be able to explain to your Majesty the present\r\nstate of the discussions on Reform, and the progress of the\r\nMeasure.[33] Lord Aberdeen feels it to be his duty to inform your\r\nMajesty that on Saturday evening he received a visit from Lord\r\nPalmerston, who announced his decided objection to the greater part\r\nof the proposed plan.[34] He did this in such positive terms that\r\nLord Aberdeen should imagine he had made up his mind not to give the\r\nMeasure his support; but Lord John entertains considerable doubt that\r\nsuch is the case.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen thinks it by no means improbable that Lord Palmerston\r\nmay also desire to separate himself from the Government, in\r\nconsequence of their pacific policy, and in order to take the lead of\r\nthe War Party and the Anti-Reformers in the House of Commons, who\r\nare essentially the same. Such a combination would undoubtedly\r\nbe formidable; but Lord Aberdeen trusts that it would not prove\r\ndangerous. At all events, it would tend greatly to the improvement of\r\nLord John's Foreign Policy.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: On the 19th of November Lord John had written to\r\n    the Queen outlining the Reform proposals of the Committee of\r\n    the Cabinet. The Queen subsequently wrote to make additional\r\n    suggestions, _e.g._, for finding a means of bringing into the\r\n    House official persons or men without local connections, and\r\n    for dealing with Ministerial re-elections.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: Lord Palmerston wrote to Lord Lansdowne, giving\r\n    an account of the affair:--\r\n\r\n    \"CARLTON GARDENS, _8th December 1853._\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR LANSDOWNE,--I have had two conversations with\r\n    Aberdeen on the subject of John Russell's proposed Reform\r\n    Bill, and I have said that there are three points in it to\r\n    which I cannot agree.\r\n\r\n    \"These points are--the extent of disfranchisement, the\r\n    extent of enfranchisement, and the addition of the Municipal\r\n    Franchise in Boroughs to the L10 Householder Franchise....\r\n\r\n    \"We should by such an arrangement increase the number of\r\n    bribeable Electors, and overpower intelligence and property by\r\n    ignorance and poverty.\r\n\r\n    \"I have told Aberdeen that I am persuaded that the Measure as\r\n    proposed by John Russell and Graham will not pass through the\r\n    two Houses of Parliament without material modifications, and\r\n    that I do not choose to be a party to a contest between the\r\n    two Houses or to an Appeal to the Country for a Measure of\r\n    which I decidedly disapprove; and that I cannot enter into a\r\n    career which would lead me to such a position, that, in\r\n    short, I do not choose to be dragged through the dirt by John\r\n    Russell. I reminded Aberdeen that on accepting his offer of\r\n    Office, I had expressed apprehension both to him and to you,\r\n    that I might find myself differing from my Colleagues on the\r\n    question of Parliamentary Reform.\r\n\r\n    \"I have thought a good deal on this matter. I should be very\r\n    sorry to give up my present Office at this moment: I have\r\n    taken a great interest in it, and I have matters in hand which\r\n    I should much wish to bring to a conclusion. Moreover, I\r\n    think that the presence in the Cabinet of a person holding the\r\n    opinions which I entertain as to the principles on which our\r\n    Foreign Affairs ought to be conducted, is useful in modifying\r\n    the contrary system of Policy, which, as I think, injuriously\r\n    to the interests and dignity of the Country, there is a\r\n    disposition in other quarters to pursue; but notwithstanding\r\n    all this. I cannot consent to stand forward as one of the\r\n    Authors and Supporters of John Russell's sweeping alterations.\r\n    Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    PALMERSTON.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON'S POSITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prince Albert to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _9th December 1853._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD ABERDEEN,--The Queen has consulted with Lord John\r\nRussell upon the Reform plan, and on the question of Lord Palmerston's\r\nposition with regard to it; and he will doubtless give you an account\r\nof what passed. She wishes me, however, to tell you likewise what\r\nstrikes her with respect to Lord Palmerston. It appears to the Queen\r\nclear that the Reform Bill will have no chance of success unless\r\nprepared and introduced in Parliament by a _united_ Cabinet; that,\r\nif Lord Palmerston has made up his mind to oppose it and to leave the\r\nGovernment, there will be no use in trying to keep him in it, and that\r\nthere will be danger in allowing him to attend the discussions of\r\nthe Cabinet, preparing all the time his line of attack; that if a\r\nsuccessor to him would after all have to be found at the Home Office,\r\nit will be unfair not to give that important member of the Government\r\nfull opportunity to take his share in the preparation and deliberation\r\non the measure to which his consent would be asked. Under these\r\ncircumstances it becomes of the highest importance to ascertain--\r\n\r\n1. What the amount of objection is that Lord Palmerston entertains to\r\nthe Measure;\r\n\r\n2. What the object of the declaration was, which he seems to have made\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nThis should be obtained _in writing_, so as to make all future\r\nmisrepresentation impossible, and on this alone a decision can well\r\nbe taken, and, in the Queen's opinion, even the Cabinet could alone\r\ndeliberate.\r\n\r\nShould Lord Palmerston have stated his objections with the view of\r\nhaving the Measure modified it will be right to consider how far that\r\ncan safely be done, and for the Queen, also, to balance the probable\r\nvalue of the modification with the risk of allowing Lord Palmerston to\r\nput himself at the head of the Opposition Party, entailing as it does\r\nthe possibility of his forcing himself back upon her as leader of that\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nShould he on the other hand consider his declaration as a \"notice\r\nto quit,\" the ground upon which he does so should be clearly put on\r\nrecord, and no attempt should be made to damage the character of the\r\nMeasure in the vain hope of propitiating him. Ever yours truly,\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD PALMERSTON RESIGNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _16th December 1853._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen arrived yesterday and returned to-day to meet the\r\nCabinet to-morrow. Lord Palmerston has sent in his resignation in a\r\nshort note to Lord Aberdeen, a further correspondence with Lord John\r\nand Lord Lansdowne, Lord Aberdeen put into my hands, and I have copied\r\nthe two most important letters which follow here.\r\n\r\nLord John is reported as very angry, calling Lord Palmerston's conduct\r\n\"treacherous,\" a term Lord Aberdeen hardly understands, as against him\r\nhe has been perfectly consistent with regard to the Reform Measure,\r\nfrom the beginning, and had frequently denied the necessity of\r\nReform.... Lord Aberdeen had advised Lord John to show boldness and\r\nenergy, and to undertake the Home Office at once himself; this would\r\nhave a great effect under the difficulties of the circumstances,\r\nwould show that he was in earnest and determined to carry his Reform\r\nMeasure. Lord John seemed hit by the idea, but asked for time to\r\nconsider; after seeing _Lady_ John, however, he declined.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen's fears are still mainly as to the Eastern Question,\r\nLord John pressing for war measures. Lord Aberdeen had followed my\r\nadvice, and had a long explanation on the subject, in which they\r\nboth agreed that their policy should be one of Peace, and he thought\r\nmatters settled when Lord John now asks for contingent engagements to\r\nmake war on Russia if her forces cross the Danube (which Lord Aberdeen\r\nthinks quite uncalled for), and to convoy the Turkish expeditions in\r\nthe Black Sea, even if directed against Russian territory, etc., etc.\r\nThe Cabinet is certain not to agree to either of these propositions.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Aberdeen announced the intended rupture with Lord Palmerston\r\nto Lord John, he drily said: \"Well, it would be very awkward for you\r\nif Palmerston quarrels one day with you about Reform, and I the next\r\nabout Turkey!\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Lord Palmerston will at once try to put\r\nhimself at the head of the late Protectionist party, and, with the\r\npresent indifference of the Country upon Reform, the fate of the Bill\r\nis by no means certain. On the question of Peace or War, Lord\r\nAberdeen is quite certain that the House of Commons will adopt no war\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nMuch will depend, however, on the line taken by Lord Lansdowne, who\r\nhas great influence in the House of Lords, and whose secession would\r\nspread great alarm over the Country as to the real tendency of the\r\nMeasure (which the Duke of Newcastle describes as in fact a great\r\nincrease of power to the land[35]). We agree that the Queen should\r\nwrite to him to prevent any hasty step.\r\n\r\nThe Queen sanctioned the offer of the Home Office to Sir George Grey,\r\nand of a seat in the Cabinet to Mr Cardwell (the President of the\r\nBoard of Trade).\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: _I.e._, the landed interest.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD LANSDOWNE AND REFORM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Marquis of Lansdowne._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _16th December 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has been made very anxious by the Resignation of Lord\r\nPalmerston, but still more so by hearing that Lord Lansdowne has\r\nnot been able to reconcile himself to the Measure of Reform as\r\nnow proposed in the Cabinet, which has caused Lord Palmerston's\r\nwithdrawal. Lord Lansdowne is aware of the paramount importance which\r\nthe Queen attaches to a safe settlement of that question, and to the\r\nmaintenance of her present Government; and she would press upon Lord\r\nLansdowne not to commit himself to a final determination before she\r\nshall have an opportunity of seeing him. The Queen will go to Windsor\r\non Thursday, and hold a Council on Friday, at which it may perhaps be\r\nconvenient to Lord Lansdowne to attend, and it will give the Queen\r\nthe greatest pleasure to find that Lord John Russell has succeeded in\r\nremoving Lord Lansdowne's objections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD STRATFORD'S DESPATCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _17th December 1853._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the enclosed Draft and Despatch to Lord Clarendon.\r\n\r\nShe has never been so much perplexed respecting any decision she has\r\nhad to make, as in the present instance. She has read Lord Stratford's\r\nDespatch (358) over several times, and she is struck, every time more,\r\nwith the consummate ability with which it is written and argued; but\r\nalso with the difficulty in which it places the person reading it to\r\nextract distinctly what the Porte will be prepared to concede.\r\n\r\nThe concluding passage of the Draft involves the most important\r\nconsequences. As the Queen understands it, it promises war with Russia\r\nin a given contingency, but the contingency is: Russia rejecting terms\r\nwhich are \"in their spirit and character such as Your Excellency sets\r\nforth in your Despatch.\" The Queen finds it impossible to make such\r\ntremendous consequences dependent upon such vague expressions. The\r\nmore so, as \"the spirit and character\" alluded to, appears to her to\r\nbe, as if purposely, obscure.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Stratford says, that the Turks would be satisfied \"with a\r\nrenewal in clear and comprehensive terms of the formal Declarations\r\nand Treaties already existing in favour of the Porte\"--the Queen\r\ncannot understand what is meant--as all the former Treaties between\r\nRussia and Turkey have certainly not been in favour of the Porte.\r\nNor is it clear to the Queen whether \"the clear and unquestionable\r\ndeliverance from Russian interference applied to spiritual matters\" is\r\ncompatible with the former treaties.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Queen, therefore, perfectly agrees in the principle\r\nthat, should Russia \"for its own unjustifiable objects, show herself\r\nregardless of the best interests of Europe\" by rejecting every fair\r\nterm, the time will have arrived \"for adopting measures of more active\r\ncoercion against her\"--she cannot sanction such a Declaration\r\nexcept on terms which are so clear in themselves as to exclude all\r\nmisinterpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SINOPE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\n(Undated.)\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letter of the 19th, and\r\nenclosures. She approves the Draft to Vienna, and asks to have a copy\r\nof it, together with the Despatch from Lord Westmorland to which it\r\nrefers.\r\n\r\nShe also approves of the Draft to Lord Cowley, with certain\r\nexceptions, viz., on the second page our accordance with the views\r\nof the French Government \"upon the utterly unjustifiable course that\r\nRussia has pursued,\" etc., is stated. If, as the Queen must read it,\r\nthis refers to the affair at Sinope,[36] it is a dangerous assertion,\r\nas we have yet no authentic account of the circumstances of the case,\r\nwhich would make it possible to judge what degree of justification\r\nthere might have been. The sentence should, at any rate, be qualified\r\nby some expression such as \"as far as we know,\" or \"should present\r\naccounts prove correct,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe word \"utterly\" might under any circumstances be left out, as a\r\nstate of War is in itself a justification of a battle.\r\n\r\nOn page four the words \"by sea\" will have to be added to make the\r\nstatement precise and correct.\r\n\r\nThe concluding sentence, the Queen must consider as tantamount to\r\na declaration of war, which, under the guarded conditions however\r\nattached to it, she feels she cannot refuse to sanction. It would, in\r\nthe Queen's opinion, be necessary, however, distinctly and fully to\r\nacquaint the Russian Government with the step now agreed upon.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston's mode of proceeding always had that advantage, that\r\nit threatened steps which it was hoped would not become necessary,\r\nwhilst those hitherto taken, started on the principle of not\r\nneedlessly offending Russia by threats, obliging us at the same time\r\nto take the very steps which we refused to threaten.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to make one more and a most _serious_ observation. The\r\nFleet has orders now to prevent a recurrence of such disasters as that\r\nof Sinope. This cannot mean that it should protect the Turkish Fleet\r\nin acts of aggression upon the Russian territory, such as an attack on\r\nSebastopol, of which the papers speak. This point will have to be made\r\nquite clear, both to Lord Stratford and the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would also wish to have copies of the Draft, when corrected,\r\nof Lord Cowley's Despatch.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: On the 30th of November the Russian Fleet from\r\n    Sevastopol attacked the Turkish squadron in the harbour of\r\n    Sinope, a naval station in the Black Sea, and destroyed it.\r\n    The feeling in the country against Russia was greatly inflamed\r\n    by the incident, which was referred to as the \"massacre of\r\n    Sinope.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PUBLIC FEELING]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _25th December 1853._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen had an Audience of the Queen yesterday afternoon.\r\nHe reported that some of his colleagues, Sir C. Wood, the Duke\r\nof Newcastle, and Mr Gladstone, had been very anxious that Lord\r\nPalmerston should be readmitted into the Cabinet; they had had\r\ninterviews with him in which he had expressed his hope to be allowed\r\nto reconsider his step. Lady Palmerston had been most urgent upon this\r\npoint with her husband. All the people best conversant with the House\r\nof Commons stated that the Government had no chance of going on with\r\nLord Palmerston in opposition, and with the present temper of the\r\npublic, which was quite mad about the Oriental Question and the\r\ndisaster at Sinope. Even Sir W. Molesworth shared this opinion.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston had written a letter to Lord Aberdeen, in which he\r\nbegs to have his resignation considered as not having taken place,\r\nas it arose entirely from a misapprehension on his part, his having\r\nbelieved that none of the details of the Reform Measure were yet\r\nopen for consideration, he had quite agreed in the principle of the\r\nMeasure! Lord Aberdeen saw Lord John and Sir J. Graham, who convinced\r\nthemselves that under the circumstances nothing else remained to be\r\ndone. Lord Aberdeen having asked Lord John whether he should tell the\r\nQueen that it was a political _necessity_, he answered: \"Yes, owing to\r\nthe shabbiness of your colleagues,\" to which Lord Aberdeen rejoined:\r\n\"Not shabbiness; _cowardice_ is the word.\"\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen owns that the step must damage the Government, although\r\nit ought to damage Lord Palmerston still more. Lord John's expression\r\nwas: \"Yes, it would ruin anybody but Palmerston.\"\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen thinks, however, that he can make no further\r\ndifficulties about Reform, and he, Lord John, and Graham were\r\ndetermined to make no material alterations in the Bill. Graham is\r\nsuspicious lest the wish to get Palmerston in again, on the part of\r\na section of the Cabinet, was an intrigue to get the Measure\r\nemasculated. Lord Aberdeen does not believe this....\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen describes Lord John's feeling as very good and cordial\r\ntowards him. He, Lord John, had even made him a long speech to show\r\nhis gratitude for Lord Aberdeen's kindness to him.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PALMERSTON RESUMES OFFICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _26th December 1853._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, with his most humble duty to your Majesty, has the\r\nhonour of enclosing copies of Lord Palmerston's letter to him,[37]\r\nand of his answer. Lord Aberdeen was not without some apprehension\r\nof receiving a rejoinder; but instead of which, a note arrived this\r\nmorning, merely asking if a Cabinet was likely to be summoned in the\r\ncourse of the week, as he was going into the country; in fact, a note\r\njust as if nothing whatever has taken place!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: Lord Palmerston wrote: \"I find ... that I was\r\n    mistaken in inferring from your letter that the details of\r\n    the intended Reform Bill had been finally settled by the\r\n    Government, and that no objection to any part of those details\r\n    would be listened to.\" He went on to say that, under the\r\n    circumstances, he could not decline to comply with the wish\r\n    of many members of the Government that he should withdraw his\r\n    resignation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by Hazell, Watson & Viney, Ld.
