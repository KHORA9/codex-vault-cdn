Grant\r\nDecember 6, 1869\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn coming before you for the first time as Chief Magistrate of this great\r\nnation, it is with gratitude to the Giver of All Good for the many benefits\r\nwe enjoy. We are blessed with peace at home, and are without entangling\r\nalliances abroad to forebode trouble; with a territory unsurpassed in\r\nfertility, of an area equal to the abundant support of 500,000,000 people,\r\nand abounding in every variety of useful mineral in quantity sufficient to\r\nsupply the world for generations; with exuberant crops; with a variety of\r\nclimate adapted to the production of every species of earth's riches and\r\nsuited to the habits, tastes, and requirements of every living thing; with\r\na population of 40,000,000 free people, all speaking one language; with\r\nfacilities for every mortal to acquire an education; with institutions\r\nclosing to none the avenues to fame or any blessing of fortune that may be\r\ncoveted; with freedom of the pulpit, the press, and the school; with a\r\nrevenue flowing into the National Treasury beyond the requirements of the\r\nGovernment. Happily, harmony is being rapidly restored within our own\r\nborders. Manufactures hitherto unknown in our country are springing up in\r\nall sections, producing a degree of national independence unequaled by that\r\nof any other power.\r\n\r\nThese blessings and countless others are intrusted to your care and mine\r\nfor safe-keeping for the brief period of our tenure of office. In a short\r\ntime we must, each of us, return to the ranks of the people, who have\r\nconferred upon us our honors, and account to them for our stewardship. I\r\nearnestly desire that neither you nor I may be condemned by a free and\r\nenlightened constituency nor by our own consciences.\r\n\r\nEmerging from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude, aided, as it was, by the\r\nsympathies and assistance of nations with which we were at peace, eleven\r\nStates of the Union were, four years ago, left without legal State\r\ngovernments. A national debt had been contracted; American commerce was\r\nalmost driven from the seas; the industry of one-half of the country had\r\nbeen taken from the control of the capitalist and placed where all labor\r\nrightfully belongs--in the keeping of the laborer. The work of restoring\r\nState governments loyal to the Union, of protecting and fostering free\r\nlabor, and providing means for paying the interest on the public debt has\r\nreceived ample attention from Congress. Although your efforts have not met\r\nwith the success in all particulars that might have been desired, yet on\r\nthe whole they have been more successful than could have been reasonably\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nSeven States which passed ordinances of secession have been fully restored\r\nto their places in the Union. The eighth (Georgia) held an election at\r\nwhich she ratified her constitution, republican in form, elected a\r\ngovernor, Members of Congress, a State legislature, and all other officers\r\nrequired. The governor was duly installed, and the legislature met and\r\nperformed all the acts then required of them by the reconstruction acts of\r\nCongress. Subsequently, however, in violation of the constitution which\r\nthey had just ratified (as since decided by the supreme court of the\r\nState), they unseated the colored members of the legislature and admitted\r\nto seats some members who are disqualified by the third clause of the\r\nfourteenth amendment to the Constitution--an article which they themselves\r\nhad contributed to ratify. Under these circumstances I would submit to you\r\nwhether it would not be wise, without delay, to enact a law authorizing the\r\ngovernor of Georgia to convene the members originally elected to the\r\nlegislature, requiring each member to take the oath prescribed by the\r\nreconstruction acts, and none to be admitted who are ineligible under the\r\nthird clause of the fourteenth amendment.\r\n\r\nThe freedmen, under the protection which they have received, are making\r\nrapid progress in learning, and no complaints are heard of lack of industry\r\non their part where they receive fair remuneration for their labor. The\r\nmeans provided for paying the interest on the public debt, with all other\r\nexpenses of Government, are more than ample. The loss of our commerce is\r\nthe only result of the late rebellion which has not received sufficient\r\nattention from you. To this subject I call your earnest attention. I will\r\nnot now suggest plans by which this object may be effected, but will, if\r\nnecessary, make it the subject of a special message during the session of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAt the March term Congress by joint resolution authorized the Executive to\r\norder elections in the States of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, to\r\nsubmit to them the constitutions which each had previously, in convention,\r\nframed, and submit the constitutions, either entire or in separate parts,\r\nto be voted upon, at the discretion of the Executive. Under this authority\r\nelections were called. In Virginia the election took place on the 6th of\r\nJuly, 1869. The governor and lieutenant-governor elected have been\r\ninstalled. The legislature met and did all required by this resolution and\r\nby all the reconstruction acts of Congress, and abstained from all doubtful\r\nauthority. I recommend that her Senators and Representatives be promptly\r\nadmitted to their seats, and that the State be fully restored to its place\r\nin the family of States. Elections were called in Mississippi and Texas, to\r\ncommence on the 30th of November, 1869, and to last two days in Mississippi\r\nand four days in Texas. The elections have taken place, but the result is\r\nnot known. It is to be hoped that the acts of the legislatures of these\r\nStates, when they meet, will be such as to receive your approval, and thus\r\nclose the work of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nAmong the evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to, is\r\nthat of an irredeemable currency. It is an evil which I hope will receive\r\nyour most earnest attention. It is a duty, and one of the highest duties,\r\nof Government to secure to the citizen a medium of exchange of fixed,\r\nunvarying value. This implies a return to a specie basis, and no substitute\r\nfor it can be devised. It should be commenced now and reached at the\r\nearliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests\r\nof the debtor class. Immediate resumption, if practicable, would not be\r\ndesirable. It would compel the debtor class to pay, beyond their contracts,\r\nthe premium on gold at the date of their purchase and would bring\r\nbankruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluctuation, however, in the paper value\r\nof the measure of all values (gold) is detrimental to the interests of\r\ntrade. It makes the man of business an involuntary gambler, for in all\r\nsales where future payment is to be made both parties speculate as to what\r\nwill be the value of the currency to be paid and received. I earnestly\r\nrecommend to you, then, such legislation as will insure a gradual return to\r\nspecie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThe methods to secure the former of these results are as numerous as are\r\nthe speculators on political economy. To secure the latter I see but one\r\nway, and that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem its own paper, at a\r\nfixed price, whenever presented, and to withhold from circulation all\r\ncurrency so redeemed until sold again for gold.\r\n\r\nThe vast resources of the nation, both developed and undeveloped, ought to\r\nmake our credit the best on earth. With a less burden of taxation than the\r\ncitizen has endured for six years past, the entire public debt could be\r\npaid in ten years. But it is not desirable that the people should be taxed\r\nto pay it in that time. Year by year the ability to pay increases in a\r\nrapid ratio. But the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as\r\ncan be done without the violation of contract. The public debt is\r\nrepresented in great part by bonds having from five to twenty and from ten\r\nto forty years to run, bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent and 5 per\r\ncent, respectively. It is optional with the Government to pay these bonds\r\nat any period after the expiration of the least time mentioned upon their\r\nface. The time has already expired when a great part of them may be taken\r\nup, and is rapidly approaching when all may be. It is believed that all\r\nwhich are now due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest not\r\nexceeding 4 1/2 per cent, and as rapidly as the remainder become due that\r\nthey may be replaced in the same way. To accomplish this it may be\r\nnecessary to authorize the interest to be paid at either of three or four\r\nof the money centers of Europe, or by any assistant treasurer of the United\r\nStates, at the option of the holder of the bond. I suggest this subject for\r\nthe consideration of Congress, and also, simultaneously with this, the\r\npropriety of redeeming our currency, as before suggested, at its market\r\nvalue at the time the law goes into effect, increasing the rate at which\r\ncurrency shall be bought and sold from day to day or week to week, at the\r\nsame rate of interest as Government pays upon its bonds.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive your\r\nattention. The revenues of the country are greater than the requirements,\r\nand may with safety be reduced. But as the funding of the debt in a 4 or a\r\n4 1/2 per cent loan would reduce annual current expenses largely, thus,\r\nafter funding, justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would be now\r\nexpedient, I suggest postponement of this question until the next meeting\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nIt may be advisable to modify taxation and tariff in instances where unjust\r\nor burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws, but a general\r\nrevision of the laws regulating this subject I recommend the postponement\r\nof for the present. I also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes, but\r\nat a reduced rate, say of 3 per cent, and this tax to expire in three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWith the funding of the national debt, as here suggested, I feel safe in\r\nsaying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely from\r\nsixty to eighty millions per annum at once, and may be still further\r\nreduced from year to year, as the resources of the country are developed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts of the\r\nGovernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869, to be $370,943,747,\r\nand the expenditures, including interest, bounties, etc., to be\r\n$321,490,597. The estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to the\r\nGovernment, and will no doubt show a much larger decrease of the public\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nThe receipts in the Treasury beyond expenditures have exceeded the amount\r\nnecessary to place to the credit of the sinking fund, as provided by law.\r\nTo lock up the surplus in the Treasury and withhold it from circulation\r\nwould lead to such a contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and\r\nseriously affect the prosperity of the country. Under these circumstances\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury and myself heartily concurred in the\r\npropriety of using all the surplus currency in the Treasury in the purchase\r\nof Government bonds, thus reducing the interest-bearing indebtedness of the\r\ncountry, and of submitting to Congress the question of the disposition to\r\nbe made of the bonds so purchased. The bonds now held by the Treasury\r\namount to about seventy-five millions, including those belonging to the\r\nsinking fund. I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the\r\nsinking fund.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury for the creation of the office of commissioner of\r\ncustoms revenue; for the increase of salaries to certain classes of\r\nofficials; the substitution of increased national-bank circulation to\r\nreplace the outstanding 3 per cent certificates; and most especially to his\r\nrecommendation for the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines, penalties,\r\nforfeitures, etc., to officers of the Government or to informers.\r\n\r\nThe office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue is one of the most arduous\r\nand responsible under the Government. It falls but little, if any, short of\r\na Cabinet position in its importance and responsibilities. I would ask for\r\nit, therefore, such legislation as in your judgment will place the office\r\nupon a footing of dignity commensurate with its importance and with the\r\ncharacter and qualifications of the class of men required to fill it\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nAs the United States is the freest of all nations, so, too, its people\r\nsympathize with all people struggling for liberty and self-government; but\r\nwhile so sympathizing it is due to our honor that we should abstain from\r\nenforcing our views upon unwilling nations and from taking an interested\r\npart, without invitation, in the quarrels between different nations or\r\nbetween governments and their subjects. Our course should always be in\r\nconformity with strict justice and law, international and local. Such has\r\nbeen the policy of the Administration in dealing with these questions. For\r\nmore than a year a valuable province of Spain, and a near neighbor of ours,\r\nin whom all our people can not but feel a deep interest, has been\r\nstruggling for independence and freedom. The people and Government of the\r\nUnited States entertain the same warm feelings and sympathies for the\r\npeople of Cuba in their pending struggle that they manifested throughout\r\nthe previous struggles between Spain and her former colonies in behalf of\r\nthe latter. But the contest has at no time assumed the conditions which\r\namount to a war in the sense of international law, or which would show the\r\nexistence of a de facto political organization of the insurgents sufficient\r\nto justify a recognition of belligerency.\r\n\r\nThe principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its own judge\r\nwhen to accord the rights of belligerency, either to a people struggling to\r\nfree themselves from a government they believe to be oppressive or to\r\nindependent nations at war with each other.\r\n\r\nThe United States have no disposition to interfere with the existing\r\nrelations of Spain to her colonial possessions on this continent. They\r\nbelieve that in due time Spain and other European powers will find their\r\ninterest in terminating those relations and establishing their present\r\ndependencies as independent powers--members of the family of nations. These\r\ndependencies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from one\r\nEuropean power to another. When the present relation of colonies ceases,\r\nthey are to become independent powers, exercising the right of choice and\r\nof self-control in the determination of their future condition and\r\nrelations with other powers.\r\n\r\nThe United States, in order to put a stop to bloodshed in Cuba, and in the\r\ninterest of a neighboring people, proposed their good offices to bring the\r\nexisting contest to a termination. The offer, not being accepted by Spain\r\non a basis which we believed could be received by Cuba, was withdrawn. It\r\nis hoped that the good offices of the United States may yet prove\r\nadvantageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife. Meanwhile a number\r\nof illegal expeditions against Cuba have been broken up. It has been the\r\nendeavor of the Administration to execute the neutrality laws in good\r\nfaith, no matter how unpleasant the task, made so by the sufferings we have\r\nendured from lack of like good faith toward us by other nations.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March last the United States schooner Lizzie Major was\r\narrested on the high seas by a Spanish frigate, and two passengers taken\r\nfrom it and carried as prisoners to Cuba. Representations of these facts\r\nwere made to the Spanish Government as soon as official information of them\r\nreached Washington. The two passengers were set at liberty, and the Spanish\r\nGovernment assured the United States that the captain of the frigate in\r\nmaking the capture had acted without law, that he had been reprimanded for\r\nthe irregularity of his conduct, and that the Spanish authorities in Cuba\r\nwould not sanction any act that could violate the rights or treat with\r\ndisrespect the sovereignty of this nation.\r\n\r\nThe question of the seizure of the brig Mary Lowell at one of the Bahama\r\nIslands by Spanish authorities is now the subject of correspondence between\r\nthis Government and those of Spain and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General of Cuba about May last issued a proclamation\r\nauthorizing search to be made of vessels on the high seas. Immediate\r\nremonstrance was made against this, whereupon the Captain-General issued a\r\nnew proclamation limiting the right of search to vessels of the United\r\nStates so far as authorized under the treaty of 1795. This proclamation,\r\nhowever, was immediately withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI have always felt that the most intimate relations should be cultivated\r\nbetween the Republic of the United States and all independent nations on\r\nthis continent. It may be well worth considering whether new treaties\r\nbetween us and them may not be profitably entered into, to secure more\r\nintimate relations--friendly, commercial, and otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe subject of an interoceanic canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans through the Isthmus of Darien is one in which commerce is greatly\r\ninterested. Instructions have been given to our minister to the Republic of\r\nthe United States of Colombia to endeavor to obtain authority for a survey\r\nby this Government, in order to determine the practicability of such an\r\nundertaking, and a charter for the right of way to build, by private\r\nenterprise, such a work, if the survey proves it to be practicable.\r\n\r\nIn order to comply with the agreement of the United States as to a mixed\r\ncommission at Lima for the adjustment of claims, it became necessary to\r\nsend a commissioner and secretary to Lima in August last. No appropriation\r\nhaving been made by Congress for this purpose, it is now asked that one be\r\nmade covering the past and future expenses of the commission.\r\n\r\nThe good offices of the United States to bring about a peace between Spain\r\nand the South American Republics with which she is at war having been\r\naccepted by Spain, Peru, and Chile, a congress has been invited to be held\r\nin Washington during the present winter.\r\n\r\nA grant has been given to Europeans of an exclusive right of transit over\r\nthe territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa Rico has given its assent,\r\nwhich, it is alleged, conflicts with vested rights of citizens of the\r\nUnited States. The Department of State has now this subject under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe minister of Peru having made representations that there was a state of\r\nwar between Peru and Spain, and that Spain was constructing, in and near\r\nNew York, thirty gunboats, which might be used by Spain in such a way as to\r\nrelieve the naval force at Cuba, so as to operate against Peru, orders were\r\ngiven to prevent their departure. No further steps having been taken by the\r\nrepresentative of the Peruvian Government to prevent the departure of these\r\nvessels, and I not feeling authorized to detain the property of a nation\r\nwith which we are at peace on a mere Executive order, the matter has been\r\nreferred to the courts to decide.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the war between the allies and the Republic of Paraguay has\r\nmade the intercourse with that country so difficult that it has been deemed\r\nadvisable to withdraw our representative from there.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the last Administration a convention was signed at\r\nLondon for the settlement of all outstanding claims between Great Britain\r\nand the United States, which failed to receive the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate to its ratification. The time and the circumstances attending\r\nthe negotiation of that treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance by the\r\npeople of the United States, and its provisions were wholly inadequate for\r\nthe settlement of the grave wrongs that had been sustained by this\r\nGovernment, as well as by its citizens. The injuries resulting to the\r\nUnited States by reason of the course adopted by Great Britain during our\r\nlate civil war--in the increased rates of insurance; in the diminution of\r\nexports and imports, and other obstructions to domestic industry and\r\nproduction; in its effect upon the foreign commerce of the country; in the\r\ndecrease and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine; in the\r\nprolongation of the war and the increased cost (both in treasure and in\r\nlives) of its suppression could not be adjusted and satisfied as ordinary\r\ncommercial claims, which continually arise between commercial nations; and\r\nyet the convention treated them simply as such ordinary claims, from which\r\nthey differ more widely in the gravity of their character than in the\r\nmagnitude of their amount, great even as is that difference. Not a word was\r\nfound in the treaty, and not an inference could be drawn from it, to remove\r\nthe sense of the unfriendliness of the course of Great Britain in our\r\nstruggle for existence, which had so deeply and universally impressed\r\nitself upon the people of this country.\r\n\r\nBelieving that a convention thus misconceived in its scope and inadequate\r\nin its provisions would not have produced the hearty, cordial settlement of\r\npending questions, which alone is consistent with the relations which I\r\ndesire to have firmly established between the United States and Great\r\nBritain, I regarded the action of the Senate in rejecting the treaty to\r\nhave been wisely taken in the interest of peace and as a necessary step in\r\nthe direction of a perfect and cordial friendship between the two\r\ncountries. A sensitive people, conscious of their power, are more at ease\r\nunder a great wrong wholly unatoned than under the restraint of a\r\nsettlement which satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor their grave\r\nsense of the grievance they have sustained. The rejection of the treaty was\r\nfollowed by a state of public feeling on both sides which I thought not\r\nfavorable to an immediate attempt at renewed negotiations. I accordingly so\r\ninstructed the minister of the United States to Great Britain, and found\r\nthat my views in this regard were shared by Her Majesty's ministers. I hope\r\nthat the time may soon arrive when the two Governments can approach the\r\nsolution of this momentous question with an appreciation of what is due to\r\nthe rights, dignity, and honor of each, and with the determination not only\r\nto remove the causes of complaint in the past, but to lay the foundation of\r\na broad principle of public law which will prevent future differences and\r\ntend to firm and continued peace and friendship.\r\n\r\nThis is now the only grave question which the United States has with any\r\nforeign nation.\r\n\r\nThe question of renewing a treaty for reciprocal trade between the United\r\nStates and the British Provinces on this continent has not been favorably\r\nconsidered by the Administration. The advantages of such a treaty would be\r\nwholly in favor of the British producer. Except, possibly, a few engaged in\r\nthe trade between the two sections, no citizen of the United States would\r\nbe benefited by reciprocity. Our internal taxation would prove a protection\r\nto the British producer almost equal to the protection which our\r\nmanufacturers now receive from the tariff. Some arrangement, however, for\r\nthe regulation of commercial intercourse between the United States and the\r\nDominion of Canada may be desirable.\r\n\r\nThe commission for adjusting the claims of the \"Hudsons Bay and Puget Sound\r\nAgricultural Company\" upon the United States has terminated its labors. The\r\naward of $650,000 has been made and all rights and titles of the company on\r\nthe territory of the United States have been extinguished. Deeds for the\r\nproperty of the company have been delivered. An appropriation by Congress\r\nto meet this sum is asked.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners for determining the northwestern land boundary between\r\nthe United States and the British possessions under the treaty of 1856 have\r\ncompleted their labors, and the commission has been dissolved.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the recommendation of Congress, a proposition was early\r\nmade to the British Government to abolish the mixed courts created under\r\nthe treaty of April 7, 1862, for the suppression of the slave trade. The\r\nsubject is still under negotiation.\r\n\r\nIt having come to my knowledge that a corporate company, organized under\r\nBritish laws, proposed to land upon the shores of the United States and to\r\noperate there a submarine cable, under a concession from His Majesty the\r\nEmperor of the French of an exclusive right for twenty years of telegraphic\r\ncommunication between the shores of France and the United States, with the\r\nvery objectionable feature of subjecting all messages conveyed thereby to\r\nthe scrutiny and control of the French Government, I caused the French and\r\nBritish legations at Washington to be made acquainted with the probable\r\npolicy of Congress on this subject, as foreshadowed by the bill which\r\npassed the Senate in March last. This drew from the representatives of the\r\ncompany an agreement to accept as the basis of their operations the\r\nprovisions of that bill, or of such other enactment on the subject as might\r\nbe passed during the approaching session of Congress; also, to use their\r\ninfluence to secure from the French Government a modification of their\r\nconcession, so as to permit the landing upon French soil of any cable\r\nbelonging to any company incorporated by the authority of the United States\r\nor of any State in the Union, and, on their part, not to oppose the\r\nestablishment of any such cable. In consideration of this agreement I\r\ndirected the withdrawal of all opposition by the United States authorities\r\nto the landing of the cable and to the working of it until the meeting of\r\nCongress. I regret to say that there has been no modification made in the\r\ncompany's concession, nor, so far as I can learn, have they attempted to\r\nsecure one. Their concession excludes the capital and the citizens of the\r\nUnited States from competition upon the shores of France. I recommend\r\nlegislation to protect the rights of citizens of the United States, as well\r\nas the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, against such an assumption. I\r\nshall also endeavor to secure, by negotiation, an abandonment of the\r\nprinciple of monopolies in ocean telegraphic cables. Copies of this\r\ncorrespondence are herewith furnished.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled political condition of other countries, less fortunate than\r\nour own, sometimes induces their citizens to come to the United States for\r\nthe sole purpose of becoming naturalized. Having secured this, they return\r\nto their native country and reside there, without disclosing their change\r\nof allegiance. They accept official positions of trust or honor, which can\r\nonly be held by citizens of their native land; they journey under passports\r\ndescribing them as such citizens; and it is only when civil discord, after\r\nperhaps years of quiet, threatens their persons or their property, or when\r\ntheir native state drafts them into its military service, that the fact of\r\ntheir change of allegiance is made known. They reside permanently away from\r\nthe United States, they contribute nothing to its revenues, they avoid the\r\nduties of its citizenship, and they only make themselves known by a claim\r\nof protection. I have directed the diplomatic and consular officers of the\r\nUnited States to scrutinize carefully all such claims for protection. The\r\ncitizen of the United States, whether native or adopted, who discharges his\r\nduty to his country, is entitled to its complete protection. While I have a\r\nvoice in the direction of affairs I shall not consent to imperil this\r\nsacred right by conferring it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimants.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of the present Administration it was found that the\r\nminister for North Germany had made propositions for the negotiation of a\r\nconvention for the protection of emigrant passengers, to which no response\r\nhad been given. It was concluded that to be effectual all the maritime\r\npowers engaged in the trade should join in such a measure. Invitations have\r\nbeen extended to the cabinets of London, Paris, Florence, Berlin, Brussels,\r\nThe Hague, Copenhagen, and Stockholm to empower their representatives at\r\nWashington to simultaneously enter into negotiations and to conclude with\r\nthe United States conventions identical in form, making uniform regulations\r\nas to the construction of the parts of vessels to be devoted to the use of\r\nemigrant passengers, as to the quality and quantity of food, as to the\r\nmedical treatment of the sick, and as to the rules to be observed during\r\nthe voyage, in order to secure ventilation, to promote health, to prevent\r\nintrusion, and to protect the females; and providing for the establishment\r\nof tribunals in the several countries for enforcing such regulations by\r\nsummary process.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully called to the law regulating the tariff on\r\nRussian hemp, and to the question whether to fix the charges on Russian\r\nhemp higher than they are fixed upon manila is not a violation of our\r\ntreaty with Russia placing her products upon the same footing with those of\r\nthe most favored nations.\r\n\r\nOur manufactures are increasing with wonderful rapidity under the\r\nencouragement which they now receive. With the improvements in machinery\r\nalready effected, and still increasing, causing machinery to take the place\r\nof skilled labor to a large extent, our imports of many articles must fall\r\noff largely within a very few years. Fortunately, too, manufactures are not\r\nconfined to a few localities, as formerly, and it is to be hoped will\r\nbecome more and more diffused, making the interest in them equal in all\r\nsections. They give employment and support to hundreds of thousands of\r\npeople at home, and retain with us the means which otherwise would be\r\nshipped abroad. The extension of railroads in Europe and the East is\r\nbringing into competition with our agricultural products like products of\r\nother countries. Self-interest, if not self-preservation, therefore\r\ndictates caution against disturbing any industrial interest of the country.\r\nIt teaches us also the necessity of looking to other markets for the sale\r\nof our surplus. Our neighbors south of us and China and Japan, should\r\nreceive our special attention. It will be the endeavor of the\r\nAdministration to cultivate such relations with all these nations as to\r\nentitle us to their confidence and make it their interest, as well as ours,\r\nto establish better commercial relations.\r\n\r\nThrough the agency of a more enlightened policy than that heretofore\r\npursued toward China, largely due to the sagacity and efforts of one of our\r\nown distinguished citizens, the world is about to commence largely\r\nincreased relations with that populous and hitherto exclusive nation. As\r\nthe United States have been the initiators in this new policy, so they\r\nshould be the most earnest in showing their good faith in making it a\r\nsuccess. In this connection I advise such legislation as will forever\r\npreclude the enslavement of the Chinese upon our soil under the name of\r\ncoolies, and also prevent American vessels from engaging in the\r\ntransportation of coolies to any country tolerating the system. I also\r\nrecommend that the mission to China be raised to one of the first class.\r\n\r\nOn my assuming the responsible duties of Chief Magistrate of the United\r\nStates it was with the conviction that three things were essential to its\r\npeace, prosperity, and fullest development. First among these is strict\r\nintegrity in fulfilling all our obligations; second, to secure protection\r\nto the person and property of the citizen of the United States in each and\r\nevery portion of our common country, wherever he may choose to move,\r\nwithout reference to original nationality, religion, color, or politics,\r\ndemanding of him only obedience to the laws and proper respect for the\r\nrights of others; third, union of all the States, with equal rights,\r\nindestructible by any constitutional means.\r\n\r\nTo secure the first of these, Congress has taken two essential steps:\r\nFirst, in declaring by joint resolution that the public debt shall be paid,\r\nprincipal and interest, in coin; and, second, by providing the means for\r\npaying. Providing the means, however, could not secure the object desired\r\nwithout a proper administration of the laws for the collection of the\r\nrevenues and an economical disbursement of them. To this subject the\r\nAdministration has most earnestly addressed itself, with results, I hope,\r\nsatisfactory to the country. There has been no hesitation in changing\r\nofficials in order to secure an efficient execution of the laws, sometimes,\r\ntoo, when, in a mere party view, undesirable political results were likely\r\nto follow; nor any hesitation in sustaining efficient officials against\r\nremonstrances wholly political.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise from\r\nleaving on the statute books the so-called \"tenure-of-office acts,\" and to\r\nearnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been the\r\nintention of the framers of the Constitution, when providing that\r\nappointments made by the President should receive the consent of the\r\nSenate, that the latter should have the power to retain in office persons\r\nplaced there by Federal appointment against the will of the President. The\r\nlaw is inconsistent with a faithful and efficient administration of the\r\nGovernment. What faith can an Executive put in officials forced upon him,\r\nand those, too, whom he has suspended for reason? How will such officials\r\nbe likely to serve an Administration which they know does not trust them?\r\n\r\nFor the second requisite to our growth and prosperity time and a firm but\r\nhumane administration of existing laws (amended from time to time as they\r\nmay prove ineffective or prove harsh and unnecessary) are probably all that\r\nare required.\r\n\r\nThe third can not be attained by special legislation, but must be regarded\r\nas fixed by the Constitution itself and gradually acquiesced in by force of\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nFrom the foundation of the Government to the present the management of the\r\noriginal inhabitants of this continent--the Indians--has been a subject of\r\nembarrassment and expense, and has been attended with continuous robberies,\r\nmurders, and wars. From my own experience upon the frontiers and in Indian\r\ncountries, I do not hold either legislation or the conduct of the whites\r\nwho come most in contact with the Indian blameless for these hostilities.\r\nThe past, however, can not be undone, and the question must be met as we\r\nnow find it. I have attempted a new policy toward these wards of the nation\r\n(they can not be regarded in any other light than as wards), with fair\r\nresults so far as tried, and which I hope will be attended ultimately with\r\ngreat success. The Society of Friends is well known as having succeeded in\r\nliving in peace with the Indians in the early settlement of Pennsylvania,\r\nwhile their white neighbors of other sects in other sections were\r\nconstantly embroiled. They are also known for their opposition to all\r\nstrife, violence, and war, and are generally noted for their strict\r\nintegrity and fair dealings. These considerations induced me to give the\r\nmanagement of a few reservations of Indians to them and to throw the burden\r\nof the selection of agents upon the society itself. The result has proven\r\nmost satisfactory. It will be found more fully set forth in the report of\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs. For superintendents and Indian agents\r\nnot on the reservations, officers of the Army were selected. The reasons\r\nfor this are numerous. Where Indian agents are sent, there, or near there,\r\ntroops must be sent also. The agent and the commander of troops are\r\nindependent of each other, and are subject to orders from different\r\nDepartments of the Government. The army officer holds a position for life;\r\nthe agent, one at the will of the President. The former is personally\r\ninterested in living in harmony with the Indian and in establishing a\r\npermanent peace, to the end that some portion of his life may be spent\r\nwithin the limits of civilized society; the latter has no such personal\r\ninterest. Another reason is an economic one; and still another, the hold\r\nwhich the Government has upon a life officer to secure a faithful discharge\r\nof duties in carrying out a given policy.\r\n\r\nThe building of railroads, and the access thereby given to all the\r\nagricultural and mineral regions of the country, is rapidly bringing\r\ncivilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of Indians. No\r\nmatter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the\r\naborigines, the fact is they do not harmonize well, and one or the other\r\nhas to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a\r\nrace is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing upon itself\r\nthe wrath of all Christendom and engendering in the citizen a disregard for\r\nhuman life and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no\r\nsubstitute for such a system, except in placing all the Indians on large\r\nreservations, as rapidly as it can be done, and giving them absolute\r\nprotection there. As soon as they are fitted for it they should be induced\r\nto take their lands in severalty and to set up Territorial governments for\r\ntheir own protection. For full details on this subject I call your special\r\nattention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War\r\nDepartment for the year ending June 30, 1869, to be $80,644,042, of which\r\n$23,882,310 was disbursed in the payment of debts contracted during the\r\nwar, and is not chargeable to current army expenses. His estimate of\r\n$34,531,031 for the expenses of the Army for the next fiscal year is as low\r\nas it is believed can be relied on. The estimates of bureau officers have\r\nbeen carefully scrutinized, and reduced wherever it has been deemed\r\npracticable. If, however, the condition of the country should be such by\r\nthe beginning of the next fiscal year as to admit of a greater\r\nconcentration of troops, the appropriation asked for will not be expended.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations estimated for river and harbor improvements and for\r\nfortifications are submitted separately. Whatever amount Congress may deem\r\nproper to appropriate for these purposes will be expended.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the General of the Army that appropriations be made\r\nfor the forts at Boston. Portland, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and\r\nSan Francisco, if for no other, is concurred in. I also ask your special\r\nattention to the recommendation of the general commanding the Military\r\nDivision of the Pacific for the sale of the seal islands of St. Paul and\r\nSt. George, Alaska Territory, and suggest that it either be complied with\r\nor that legislation be had for the protection of the seal fisheries from\r\nwhich a revenue should be derived.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War contains a synopsis of the reports of\r\nthe heads of bureaus, of the commanders of military divisions, and of the\r\ndistricts of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, and the report of the\r\nGeneral of the Army in full. The recommendations therein contained have\r\nbeen well considered, and are submitted for your action. I, however, call\r\nspecial attention to the recommendation of the Chief of Ordnance for the\r\nsale of arsenals and lands no longer of use to the Government; also, to the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary of War that the act of 3d March, 1869,\r\nprohibiting promotions and appointments in the staff corps of the Army, be\r\nrepealed. The extent of country to be garrisoned and the number of military\r\nposts to be occupied is the same with a reduced Army as with a large one.\r\nThe number of staff officers required is more dependent upon the latter\r\nthan the former condition.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy accompanying this shows the\r\ncondition of the Navy when this Administration came into office and the\r\nchanges made since. Strenuous efforts have been made to place as many\r\nvessels \"in commission,\" or render them fit for service if required, as\r\npossible, and to substitute the sail for steam while cruising, thus\r\nmaterially reducing the expenses of the Navy and adding greatly to its\r\nefficiency. Looking to our future, I recommend a liberal, though not\r\nextravagant, policy toward this branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General furnishes a clear and comprehensive\r\nexhibit of the operations of the postal service and of the financial\r\ncondition of the Post-Office Department. The ordinary postal revenues for\r\nthe year ending the 30th of June, 1869, amounted to $18,344,510, and the\r\nexpenditures to $23,698,131, showing an excess of expenditures over\r\nreceipts of $5,353,620. The excess of expenditures over receipts for the\r\nprevious year amounted to $6,437,992. The increase of revenues for 1869\r\nover those of 1868 was $2,051,909, and the increase of expenditures was\r\n$967,538. The increased revenue in 1869 exceeded the increased revenue in\r\n1868 by $996,336, and the increased expenditure in 1869 was $2,527,570 less\r\nthan the increased expenditure in 1868, showing by comparison this\r\ngratifying feature of improvement, that while the increase of expenditures\r\nover the increase of receipts in 1868 was $2,439,535, the increase of\r\nreceipts over the increase of expenditures in 1869 was $1,084,371.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully called to the recommendations made by the\r\nPostmaster-General for authority to change the rate of compensation to the\r\nmain trunk railroad lines for their services in carrying the mails; for\r\nhaving post-route maps executed; for reorganizing and increasing the\r\nefficiency of the special-agency service; for increase of the mail service\r\non the Pacific, and for establishing mail service, under the flag of the\r\nUnion, on the Atlantic; and most especially do I call your attention to his\r\nrecommendation for the total abolition of the franking privilege. This is\r\nan abuse from which no one receives a commensurate advantage; it reduces\r\nthe receipts for postal service from 25 to 30 per cent and largely\r\nincreases the service to be performed. The method by which postage should\r\nbe paid upon public matter is set forth fully in the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that the quantity of\r\npublic lands disposed of during the year ending the 30th of June, 1869, was\r\n7,666,152 acres, exceeding that of the preceding year by 1,010,409 acres.\r\nOf this amount 2,899,544 acres were sold for cash and 2,737,365 acres\r\nentered under the homestead laws. The remainder was granted to aid in the\r\nconstruction of works of internal improvement, approved to the States as\r\nswamp land, and located with warrants and scrip. The cash receipts from all\r\nsources were $4,472,886, exceeding those of the preceding year $2,840,140.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 23,196 names were added to the pension rolls\r\nand 4,876 dropped therefrom, leaving at its close 187,963. The amount paid\r\nto pensioners, including the compensation of disbursing agents, was\r\n$28,422,884, an increase of $4,411,902 on that of the previous year. The\r\nmunificence of Congress has been conspicuously manifested in its\r\nlegislation for the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the recent\r\nstruggle to maintain \"that unity of government which makes us one people.\"\r\nThe additions to the pension rolls of each successive year since the\r\nconclusion of hostilities result in a great degree from the repeated\r\namendments of the act of the 14th of July, 1862, which extended its\r\nprovisions to cases not falling within its original scope. The large outlay\r\nwhich is thus occasioned is further increased by the more liberal allowance\r\nbestowed since that date upon those who in the line of duty were wholly or\r\npermanently disabled. Public opinion has given an emphatic sanction to\r\nthese measures of Congress, and it will be conceded that no part of our\r\npublic burden is more cheerfully borne than that which is imposed by this\r\nbranch of the service. It necessitates for the next fiscal year, in\r\naddition to the amount justly chargeable to the naval pension fund, an\r\nappropriation of $30,000,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending the 30th of September, 1869, the Patent Office\r\nissued 13,762 patents, and its receipts were $686,389, being $213,926 more\r\nthan the expenditures.\r\n\r\nMessages and Papers of the Presidents, Ulysses S. Grant, vol. 6, p.3995\r\n\r\nI would respectfully call your attention to the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior for uniting the duties of supervising the\r\neducation of freedmen with the other duties devolving upon the Commissioner\r\nof Education.\r\n\r\nIf it is the desire of Congress to make the census which must be taken\r\nduring the year 1870 more complete and perfect than heretofore, I would\r\nsuggest early action upon any plan that may be agreed upon. As Congress at\r\nthe last session appointed a committee to take into consideration such\r\nmeasures as might be deemed proper in reference to the census and report a\r\nplan, I desist from saying more.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the claims of the Agricultural\r\nBureau for liberal appropriations. In a country so diversified in climate\r\nand soil as ours, and with a population so largely dependent upon\r\nagriculture, the benefits that can be conferred by properly fostering this\r\nBureau are incalculable.\r\n\r\nI desire respectfully to call the attention of Congress to the inadequate\r\nsalaries of a number of the most important offices of the Government. In\r\nthis message I will not enumerate them, but will specify only the justices\r\nof the Supreme Court. No change has been made in their salaries for fifteen\r\nyears. Within that time the labors of the court have largely increased and\r\nthe expenses of living have at least doubled. During the same time Congress\r\nhas twice found it necessary to increase largely the compensation of its\r\nown members, and the duty which it owes to another department of the\r\nGovernment deserves, and will undoubtedly receive, its due consideration.\r\n\r\nThere are many subjects not alluded to in this message which might with\r\npropriety be introduced, but I abstain, believing that your patriotism and\r\nstatesmanship will suggest the topics and the legislation most conducive to\r\nthe interests of the whole people. On my part I promise a rigid adherence\r\nto the laws and their strict enforcement.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\nDecember 5, 1870\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nA year of peace and general prosperity to this nation has passed since the\r\nlast assembling of Congress. We have, through a kind Providence, been\r\nblessed with abundant crops, and have been spared from complications and\r\nwar with foreign nations. In our midst comparative harmony has been\r\nrestored. It is to be regretted, however, that a free exercise of the\r\nelective franchise has by violence and intimidation been denied to citizens\r\nin exceptional cases in several of the States lately in rebellion, and the\r\nverdict of the people has thereby been reversed. The States of Virginia,\r\nMississippi, and Texas have been restored to representation in our national\r\ncouncils. Georgia, the only State now without representation, may\r\nconfidently be expected to take her place there also at the beginning of\r\nthe new year, and then, let us hope, will be completed the work of\r\nreconstruction. With an acquiescence on the part of the whole people in the\r\nnational obligation to pay the public debt created as the price of our\r\nUnion, the pensions to our disabled soldiers and sailors and their widows\r\nand orphans, and in the changes to the Constitution which have been made\r\nnecessary by a great rebellion, there is no reason why we should not\r\nadvance in material prosperity and happiness as no other nation ever did\r\nafter so protracted and devastating a war.\r\n\r\nSoon after the existing war broke out in Europe the protection of the\r\nUnited States minister in Paris was invoked in favor of North Germans\r\ndomiciled in French territory. Instructions were issued to grant the\r\nprotection. This has been followed by an extension of American protection\r\nto citizens of Saxony, Hesse and Saxe-Coburg, Gotha, Colombia, Portugal,\r\nUruguay, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Chile, Paraguay, and Venezuela in\r\nParis. The charge was an onerous one, requiring constant and severe labor,\r\nas well as the exercise of patience, prudence, and good judgment. It has\r\nbeen performed to the entire satisfaction of this Government, and, as I am\r\nofficially informed, equally so to the satisfaction of the Government of\r\nNorth Germany.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I learned that a republic had been proclaimed at Paris and that\r\nthe people of France had acquiesced in the change, the minister of the\r\nUnited States was directed by telegraph to recognize it and to tender my\r\ncongratulations and those of the people of the United States. The\r\nreestablishment in France of a system of government disconnected with the\r\ndynastic traditions of Europe appeared to be a proper subject for the\r\nfelicitations of Americans. Should the present struggle result in attaching\r\nthe hearts of the French to our simpler forms of representative government,\r\nit will be a subject of still further satisfaction to our people. While we\r\nmake no effort to impose our institutions upon the inhabitants of other\r\ncountries, and while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil\r\ncontests elsewhere, we can not be indifferent to the spread of American\r\npolitical ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France.\r\n\r\nWe were asked by the new Government to use our good offices, jointly with\r\nthose of European powers, in the interests of peace. Answer was made that\r\nthe established policy and the true interests of the United States forbade\r\nthem to interfere in European questions jointly with European powers. I\r\nascertained, informally and unofficially, that the Government of North\r\nGermany was not then disposed to listen to such representations from any\r\npower, and though earnestly wishing to see the blessings of peace restored\r\nto the belligerents, with all of whom the United States are on terms of\r\nfriendship, I declined on the part of this Government to take a step which\r\ncould only result in injury to our true interests without advancing the\r\nobject for which our intervention was invoked. Should the time come when\r\nthe action of the United States can hasten the return of peace by a single\r\nhour, that action will be heartily taken. I deemed it prudent, in view of\r\nthe number of persons of German and French birth living in the United\r\nStates, to issue, soon after official notice of a state of war had been\r\nreceived from both belligerents, a proclamation defining the duties of the\r\nUnited States as a neutral and the obligations of persons residing within\r\ntheir territory to observe their laws and the laws of nations. This\r\nproclamation was followed by others, as circumstances seemed to call for\r\nthem. The people, thus acquainted in advance of their duties and\r\nobligations, have assisted in preventing violations of the neutrality of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIt is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba has\r\nmaterially changed since the close of the last session of Congress. In an\r\nearly stage of the contest the authorities of Spain inaugurated a system of\r\narbitrary arrests, of close confinement, and of military trial and\r\nexecution of persons suspected of complicity with the insurgents, and of\r\nsummary embargo of their properties, and sequestration of their revenues by\r\nexecutive warrant. Such proceedings, so far as they affected the persons or\r\nproperty of citizens of the United States, were in violation of the\r\nprovisions of the treaty of 1795 between the United States and Spain.\r\n\r\nRepresentations of injuries resulting to several persons claiming to be\r\ncitizens of the United States by reason of such violations were made to the\r\nSpanish Government. From April, 1869, to June last the Spanish minister at\r\nWashington had been clothed with a limited power to aid in redressing such\r\nwrongs. That power was found to be withdrawn, \"in view,\" as it was said,\r\n\"of the favorable situation in which the island of Cuba\" then \"was,\" which,\r\nhowever, did not lead to a revocation or suspension of the extraordinary\r\nand arbitrary functions exercised by the executive power in Cuba, and we\r\nwere obliged to make our complaints at Madrid. In the negotiations thus\r\nopened, and still pending there, the United States only claimed that for\r\nthe future the rights secured to their citizens by treaty should be\r\nrespected in Cuba, and that as to the past a joint tribunal should be\r\nestablished in the United States with full jurisdiction over all such\r\nclaims. Before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be required\r\nto prove his case. On the other hand, Spain would be at liberty to traverse\r\nevery material fact, and thus complete equity would be done. A case which\r\nat one time threatened seriously to affect the relations between the United\r\nStates and Spain has already been disposed of in this way. The claim of the\r\nowners of the Colonel Lloyd Aspinwall for the illegal seizure and detention\r\nof that vessel was referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and has\r\nresulted in an award to the United States, for the owners, of the sum of\r\n$19,702.50 in gold. Another and long-pending claim of like nature, that of\r\nthe whaleship Canada, has been disposed of by friendly arbitrament during\r\nthe present year. It was referred, by the joint consent of Brazil and the\r\nUnited States, to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton, Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious task\r\nof examining the voluminous mass of correspondence and testimony submitted\r\nby the two Governments, and awarded to the United States the sum of\r\n$100,740.09 in gold, which has since been paid by the Imperial Government.\r\nThese recent examples show that the mode which the United States have\r\nproposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible,\r\nand that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. It is to be\r\nhoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without further\r\ndelay. Should the pending negotiations, unfortunately and unexpectedly, be\r\nwithout result, it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to\r\nCongress and invite its action on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe long-deferred peace conference between Spain and the allied South\r\nAmerican Republics has been inaugurated in Washington under the auspices of\r\nthe United States. Pursuant to the recommendation contained in the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of December, 1866,\r\nthe executive department of the Government offered its friendly offices for\r\nthe promotion of peace and harmony between Spain and the allied Republics.\r\nHesitations and obstacles occurred to the acceptance of the offer.\r\nUltimately, however, a conference was arranged, and was opened in this city\r\non the 29th of October last, at which I authorized the Secretary of State\r\nto preside. It was attended by the ministers of Spain, Peru, Chile, and\r\nEcuador. In consequence of the absence of a representative from Bolivia,\r\nthe conference was adjourned until the attendance of a plenipotentiary from\r\nthat Republic could be secured or other measures could be adopted toward\r\ncompassing its objects.\r\n\r\nThe allied and other Republics of Spanish origin on this continent may see\r\nin this fact a new proof of our sincere interest in their welfare, of our\r\ndesire to see them blessed with good governments, capable of maintaining\r\norder and of preserving their respective territorial integrity, and of our\r\nsincere wish to extend our own commercial and social relations with them.\r\nThe time is not probably far distant when, in the natural course of events,\r\nthe European political connection with this continent will cease. Our\r\npolicy should be shaped, in view of this probability, so as to ally the\r\ncommercial interests of the Spanish American States more closely to our\r\nown, and thus give the United States all the preeminence and all the\r\nadvantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Clay contemplated when they\r\nproposed to join in the congress of Panama.\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of Congress a treaty for the annexation of the\r\nRepublic of San Domingo to the United States failed to receive the\r\nrequisite two-thirds vote of the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced then\r\nthat the best interests of this country, commercially and materially,\r\ndemanded its ratification. Time has only confirmed me in this view. I now\r\nfirmly believe that the moment it is known that the United States have\r\nentirely abandoned the project of accepting as a part of its territory the\r\nisland of San Domingo a free port will be negotiated for by European\r\nnations in the Bay of Samana. A large commercial city will spring up, to\r\nwhich we will be tributary without receiving corresponding benefits, and\r\nthen will be seen the folly of our rejecting so great a prize. The\r\nGovernment of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this annexation. It is a\r\nweak power, numbering probably less than 120,000 souls, and yet possessing\r\none of the richest territories under the sun, capable of supporting a\r\npopulation of 10,000,000 people in luxury. The people of San Domingo are\r\nnot capable of maintaining themselves in their present condition, and must\r\nlook for outside support. They yearn for the protection of our free\r\ninstitutions and laws, our progress and civilization. Shall we refuse\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of San Domingo is desirable because of its geographical\r\nposition. It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmus\r\ntransit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, best and most capacious\r\nharbors, most salubrious climate, and the most valuable products of the\r\nforests, mine, and soil of any of the West India Islands. Its possession by\r\nus will in a few years build up a coastwise commerce of immense magnitude,\r\nwhich will go far toward restoring to us our lost merchant marine. It will\r\ngive to us those articles which we consume so largely and do not produce,\r\nthus equalizing our exports and imports. In case of foreign war it will\r\ngive us command of all the islands referred to, and thus prevent an enemy\r\nfrom ever again possessing himself of rendezvous upon our very coast. At\r\npresent our coast trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic and\r\nthose bordering on the Gulf of Mexico is cut into by the Bahamas and the\r\nAntilies. Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign countries to get\r\nby sea from Georgia to the west coast of Florida.\r\n\r\nSan Domingo, with a stable government, under which her immense resources\r\ncan be developed, will give remunerative wages to tens of thousands of\r\nlaborers not now upon the island. This labor will take advantage of every\r\navailable means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seek\r\nthe blessings of freedom and its sequence--each inhabitant receiving the\r\nreward of his own labor. Porto Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery,\r\nas a measure of self-preservation, to retain their laborers.\r\n\r\nSan Domingo will become a large consumer of the products of Northern farms\r\nand manufactories. The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnished\r\nwith food, tools, and machinery will make it necessary that contiguous\r\nislands should have the same advantages in order to compete in the\r\nproduction of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical fruits, etc. This will open\r\nto us a still wider market for our products. The production of our own\r\nsupply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred millions of our\r\nannual imports, besides largely increasing our exports. With such a picture\r\nit is easy to see how our large debt abroad is ultimately to be\r\nextinguished. With a balance of trade against us (including interest on\r\nbonds held by foreigners and money spent by our citizens traveling in\r\nforeign lands) equal to the entire yield of the precious metals in this\r\ncountry, it is not so easy to see how this result is to be otherwise\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence to the \"Monroe doctrine;\" it\r\nis a measure of national protection; it is asserting our just claim to a\r\ncontrolling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from\r\nwest to east by way of the Isthmus of Darien; it is to build up our\r\nmerchant marine; it is to furnish new markets for the products of our\r\nfarms, shops, and manufactories; it is to make slavery insupportable in\r\nCuba and Porto Rico at once, and ultimately so in Brazil; it is to settle\r\nthe unhappy condition of Cuba and end an exterminating conflict; it is to\r\nprovide honest means of paying our honest debts without overtaxing the\r\npeople; it is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries of everyday life\r\nat cheaper rates than ever before; and it is, in fine, a rapid stride\r\ntoward that greatness which the intelligence, industry, and enterprise of\r\nthe citizens of the United States entitle this country to assume among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIn view of the importance of this question, I earnestly urge upon Congress\r\nearly action expressive of its views as to the best means of acquiring San\r\nDomingo. My suggestion is that by joint resolution of the two Houses of\r\nCongress the Executive be authorized to appoint a commission to negotiate a\r\ntreaty with the authorities of San Domingo for the acquisition of that\r\nisland, and that an appropriation be made to defray the expenses of such a\r\ncommission. The question may then be determined, either by the action of\r\nthe Senate upon the treaty or the joint action of the two Houses of\r\nCongress upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case of the acquisition\r\nof Texas. So convinced am I of the advantages to flow from the acquisition\r\nof San Domingo, and of the great disadvantages--I might almost say\r\ncalamities--to flow from nonacquisition, that I believe the subject has\r\nonly to be investigated to be approved.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that our representations in regard to the injurious\r\neffects, especially upon the revenue of the United States, of the policy of\r\nthe Mexican Government in exempting from impost duties a large tract of its\r\nterritory on our borders have not only been fruitless, but that it is even\r\nproposed in that country to extend the limits within which the privilege\r\nadverted to has hitherto been enjoyed. The expediency of taking into your\r\nserious consideration proper measures for countervailing the policy\r\nreferred to will, it is presumed, engage your earnest attention.\r\n\r\nIt is the obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to provide\r\nagainst impunity to those who may have committed high crimes within their\r\nborders and who may have sought refuge abroad. For this purpose extradition\r\ntreaties have been concluded with several of the Central American\r\nRepublics, and others are in progress.\r\n\r\nThe sense of Congress is desired, as early as may be convenient, upon the\r\nproceedings of the commission on claims against Venezuela, as communicated\r\nin my messages of March 16, 1869, March 1, 1870, and March 31, 1870. It has\r\nnot been deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which has been\r\nreceived from that Government until Congress shall have acted on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe massacres of French and Russian residents at Tien-Tsin, under\r\ncircumstances of great barbarity, was supposed by some to have been\r\npremeditated, and to indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate\r\nforeigners in the Chinese Empire. The evidence fails to establish such a\r\nsupposition, but shows a complicity between the local authorities and the\r\nmob. The Government at Peking, however, seems to have been disposed to\r\nfulfill its treaty obligations so far as it was able to do so.\r\nUnfortunately, the news of the war between the German States and France\r\nreached China soon after the massacre. It would appear that the popular\r\nmind became possessed with the idea that this contest, extending to Chinese\r\nwaters, would neutralize the Christian influence and power, and that the\r\ntime was coming when the superstitious masses might expel all foreigners\r\nand restore mandarin influence. Anticipating trouble from this cause, I\r\ninvited France and North Germany to make an authorized suspension of\r\nhostilities in the East (where they were temporarily suspended by act of\r\nthe commanders), and to act together for the future protection in China of\r\nthe lives and properties of Americans and Europeans.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of Congress the ratifications of the treaty with\r\nGreat Britain for abolishing the mixed courts for the suppression of the\r\nslave trade have been exchanged. It is believed that the slave trade is now\r\nconfined to the eastern coast of Africa, whence the slaves are taken to\r\nArabian markets.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the naturalization convention between Great Britain\r\nand the United States have also been exchanged during the recess, and thus\r\na long-standing dispute between the two Governments has been settled in\r\naccordance with the principles always contended for by the United States.\r\n\r\nIn April last, while engaged in locating a military reservation near\r\nPembina, a corps of engineers discovered that the commonly received\r\nboundary line between the United States and the British possessions at that\r\nplace is about 4,700 feet south of the true position of the forty-ninth\r\nparallel, and that the line, when run on what is now supposed to be the\r\ntrue position of that parallel, would leave the fort of the Hudsons Bay\r\nCompany at Pembina within the territory of the United States. This\r\ninformation being communicated to the British Government, I was requested\r\nto consent, and did consent, that the British occupation of the fort of the\r\nHudsons Bay Company should continue for the present. I deem it important,\r\nhowever, that this part of the boundary line should be definitely fixed by\r\na joint commission of the two Governments, and I submit herewith estimates\r\nof the expense of such a commission on the part of the United States and\r\nrecommend that an appropriation be made for that purpose. The land boundary\r\nhas already been fixed and marked from the summit of the Rocky Mountains to\r\nthe Georgian Bay. It should now be in like manner marked from the Lake of\r\nthe Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of\r\nthe claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted by that\r\nGovernment during the rebellion. The cabinet of London, so far as its views\r\nhave been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that Her\r\nMajesty's Government was guilty of any negligence, or did or permitted any\r\nact during the war by which the United States has just cause of complaint.\r\nOur firm and unalterable convictions are directly the reverse. I therefore\r\nrecommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a commission to take\r\nproof of the amount and the ownership of these several claims, on notice to\r\nthe representative of Her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be\r\ngiven for the settlement of these claims by the United States, so that the\r\nGovernment shall have the ownership of the private claims, as well as the\r\nresponsible control of all the demands against Great Britain. It can not be\r\nnecessary to add that whenever Her Majesty's Government shall entertain a\r\ndesire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims the United States\r\nwill enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion\r\nconsistent with the honor and dignity of both nations.\r\n\r\nThe course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of the\r\nUnited States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly\r\nfeeling. By the first article of the convention of 1818 between Great\r\nBritain and the United States it was agreed that the inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States should have forever, in common with British subjects, the\r\nright of taking fish in certain waters therein defined. In the waters not\r\nincluded in the limits named in the convention (within 3 miles of parts of\r\nthe British coast) it has been the custom for many years to give to\r\nintruding fishermen of the United States a reasonable warning of their\r\nviolation of the technical rights of Great Britain. The Imperial Government\r\nis understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction or\r\ncontrol of these inshore fishing grounds to the colonial authority known as\r\nthe Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent but irresponsible agent\r\nhas exercised its delegated powers in an unfriendly way. Vessels have been\r\nseized without notice or warning, in violation of the custom previously\r\nprevailing, and have been taken into the colonial ports, their voyages\r\nbroken up, and the vessels condemned. There is reason to believe that this\r\nunfriendly and vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the\r\nhardy fishermen of the United States, with a view to political effect upon\r\nthis Government. The statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume a still\r\nbroader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United\r\nStates. They authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within\r\n3 marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of Canada\r\ninto port, to search the cargo, to examine the master on oath touching the\r\ncargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty if true\r\nanswers are not given; and if such a vessel is found \"preparing to fish\"\r\nwithin 3 marine miles of any of such coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors\r\nwithout a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the last\r\nlicense granted to it, they provide that the vessel, with her tackle, etc.,\r\nshall be forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations have been made\r\nunder this statute. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it,\r\nit will become my duty to take such steps as may be necessary to protect\r\nthe rights of the citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed by Her Majesty's officers that the fishing vessels of\r\nthe United States have no right to enter the open ports of the British\r\npossessions in North America, except for the purposes of shelter and\r\nrepairing damages, of purchasing wood and obtaining water; that they have\r\nno right to enter at the British custom-houses or to trade there except in\r\nthe purchase of wood and water, and that they must depart within\r\ntwenty-four hours after notice to leave. It is not known that any seizure\r\nof a fishing vessel carrying the flag of the United States has been made\r\nunder this claim. So far as the claim is founded on an alleged construction\r\nof he convention of 1818, it can not be acquiesced in by the United States.\r\nIt is hoped that it will not be insisted on by Her Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nDuring the conferences which preceded the negotiation of the convention of\r\n1818 the British commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the fishermen\r\nof the United States from \"the privilege of carrying on trade with any of\r\nHis Britannic Majesty's subjects residing within the limits assigned for\r\ntheir use;\" and also that it should not be \"lawful for the vessels of the\r\nUnited States engaged in said fishery to have on board any goods, wares, or\r\nmerchandise whatever, except such as may be necessary for the prosecution\r\nof their voyages to and from the said fishing grounds: and any vessel of\r\nthe United States which shall contravene this regulation may be seized,\r\ncondemned, and confiscated, with her cargo.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition, which is identical with the construction now put upon the\r\nlanguage of the convention, was emphatically rejected by the American\r\ncommissioners, and thereupon was abandoned by the British\r\nplenipotentiaries, and Article I, as it stands in the convention, was\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be said that this claim is founded on provincial or\r\ncolonial statutes, and not upon the convention, this Government can not but\r\nregard them as unfriendly, and in contravention of the spirit, if not of\r\nthe letter, of the treaty, for the faithful execution of which the Imperial\r\nGovernment is alone responsible.\r\n\r\nAnticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadian\r\nauthorities in the coming season to repeat their unneighborly acts toward\r\nour fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to\r\nsuspend by proclamation the operation of the laws authorizing the transit\r\nof goods, wares, and merchandise in bond across the territory of the United\r\nStates to Canada, and, further, should such an extreme measure become\r\nnecessary, to suspend the operation of any laws whereby the vessels of the\r\nDominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States.\r\n\r\nA like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on the part of Canada in\r\nthe maintenance of a claim of right to exclude the citizens of the United\r\nStates from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. This river constitutes a\r\nnatural outlet to the ocean for eight States, with an aggregate population\r\nof about 17,600,000 inhabitants, and with an aggregate tonnage of 661,367\r\ntons upon the waters which discharge into it. The foreign commerce of our\r\nports on these waters is open to British competition, and the major part of\r\nit is done in British bottoms.\r\n\r\nIf the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean,\r\nthe monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake ports with the Atlantic\r\nwould be in foreign hands, their vessels on transatlantic voyages having an\r\naccess to our lake ports which would be denied to American vessels on\r\nsimilar voyages. To state such a proposition is to refute its justice.\r\n\r\nDuring the Administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams Mr. Clay unanswerably\r\ndemonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States to the\r\nnavigation of this river, claiming that the act of the congress of Vienna\r\nin opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations showed the judgment of\r\nEuropean jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country through\r\nwhich a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the navigation\r\nof that river to and into the sea, even though passing through the\r\nterritories of another power. This right does not exclude the coequal right\r\nof the sovereign possessing the territory through which the river debouches\r\ninto the sea to make such regulations relative to the police of the\r\nnavigation as may be reasonably necessary; but those regulations should be\r\nframed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should not impose needless\r\nburdens upon the commerce which has the right of transit. It has been found\r\nin practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by mutual\r\nagreement. The United States are ready to make any reasonable arrangement\r\nas to the police of the St. Lawrence which may be suggested by Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nIf the claim made by Mr. Clay was just when the population of States\r\nbordering on the shores of the Lakes was only 3,400,000, it now derives\r\ngreater force and equity from the increased population, wealth, production,\r\nand tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced\r\nhis argument in behalf of our right the principle for which he contended\r\nhas been frequently, and by various nations, recognized by law or by\r\ntreaty, and has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty\r\nconcluded at Mayence in 1831 the Rhine was declared free from the point\r\nwhere it is first navigable into the sea. By the convention between Spain\r\nand Portugal concluded in 1835 the navigation of the Douro throughout its\r\nwhole extent was made free for the subjects of both Crowns. In 1853 the\r\nArgentine Confederation by treaty threw open the free navigation of the\r\nParana and the Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 1856 the\r\nCrimean War was closed by a treaty which provided for the free navigation\r\nof the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia by treaty declared that it regarded the\r\nrivers Amazon and La Plata, in accordance with fixed principles of national\r\nlaw, as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all\r\nnations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December,\r\n1866, the Emperor of Brazil by imperial decree declared the Amazon to be\r\nopen to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. The\r\ngreatest living British authority on this subject, while asserting the\r\nabstract right of the British claim, says: It seems difficult to deny that\r\nGreat Britain may ground her refusal upon strict law, but it is equally\r\ndifficult to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme\r\nand hard law; secondly, that her conduct with respect to the navigation of\r\nthe St. Lawrence is in glaring and discreditable inconsistency with her\r\nconduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi. On the ground\r\nthat she possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took its rise,\r\nshe insisted on the right to navigate the entire volume of its waters. On\r\nthe ground that she possesses both banks of the St. Lawrence, where it\r\ndisembogues itself into the sea, she denies to the United States the right\r\nof navigation, though about one-half of the waters of Lakes Ontario. Erie,\r\nHuron, and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan, through which the\r\nriver flows, are the property of the United States. The whole nation is\r\ninterested in securing cheap transportation from the agricultural States of\r\nthe West to the Atlantic Seaboard. To the citizens of those States it\r\nsecures a greater return for their labor; to the inhabitants of the\r\nseaboard it affords cheaper food; to the nation, an increase in the annual\r\nsurplus of wealth. It is hoped that the Government of Great Britain will\r\nsee the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to which\r\nher Canadian Provinces have urged her adherence.\r\n\r\nOur depressed commerce is a subject to which I called your special\r\nattention at the last session, and suggested that we will in the future\r\nhave to look more to the countries south of us, and to China and Japan, for\r\nits revival. Our representatives to all these Governments have exerted\r\ntheir influence to encourage trade between the United States and the\r\ncountries to which they are accredited. But the fact exists that the\r\ncarrying is done almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and while this state\r\nof affairs exists we can not control our due share of the commerce of the\r\nworld; that between the Pacific States and China and Japan is about all the\r\ncarrying trade now conducted in American vessels. I would recommend a\r\nliberal policy toward that line of American steamers--one that will insure\r\nits success, and even increased usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that can compete with\r\nforeign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the United\r\nStates than in foreign countries that without some assistance from the\r\nGovernment they can not be successfully built here. There will be several\r\npropositions laid before Congress in the course of the present session\r\nlooking to a remedy for this evil. Even if it should be at some cost to the\r\nNational Treasury, I hope such encouragement will be given as will secure\r\nAmerican shipping on the high seas and American shipbuilding at home.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the archives at the Department of State calls for the\r\nearly action of Congress. The building now rented by that Department is a\r\nfrail structure, at an inconvenient distance from the Executive Mansion and\r\nfrom the other Departments, is ill adapted to the purpose for which it is\r\nused, has not capacity to accommodate the archives, and is not fireproof.\r\nIts remote situation, its slender construction, and the absence of a supply\r\nof water in the neighborhood leave but little hope of safety for either the\r\nbuilding or its contents in case of the accident of a fire. Its destruction\r\nwould involve the loss of the rolls containing the original acts and\r\nresolutions of Congress, of the historic records of the Revolution and of\r\nthe Confederation, of the whole series of diplomatic and consular archives\r\nsince the adoption of the Constitution, and of the many other valuable\r\nrecords and papers left with that Department when it was the principal\r\ndepository of the governmental archives. I recommend an appropriation for\r\nthe construction of a building for the Department of State.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your consideration the propriety of transferring to the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to\r\nbelong, all powers and duties in relation to the Territories with which the\r\nDepartment of State is now charged by law or usage; and from the Interior\r\nDepartment to the War Department the Pension Bureau, so far as it regulates\r\nthe payment of soldiers' pensions. I would further recommend that the\r\npayment of naval pensions be transferred to one of the bureaus of the Navy\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the expenses of the Government for the next fiscal year\r\nare $18,244,346.01 less than for the current one, but exceed the\r\nappropriations for the present year for the same items $8,972,127.56. In\r\nthis estimate, however, is included $22,338,278.37 for public works\r\nheretofore begun under Congressional provision, and of which only so much\r\nis asked as Congress may choose to give. The appropriation for the same\r\nworks for the present fiscal year was $11,984,518.08.\r\n\r\nThe average value of gold, as compared with national currency, for the\r\nwhole of the year 1869 was about 134, and for eleven months of 1870 the\r\nsame relative value has been about 115. The approach to a specie basis is\r\nvery gratifying, but the fact can not be denied that the instability of the\r\nvalue of our currency is prejudicial to our prosperity, and tends to keep\r\nup prices, to the detriment of trade. The evils of a depreciated and\r\nfluctuating currency are so great that now, when the premium on gold has\r\nfallen so much, it would seem that the time has arrived when by wise and\r\nprudent legislation Congress should look to a policy which would place our\r\ncurrency at par with gold at no distant day.\r\n\r\nThe tax collected from the people has been reduced more than $80,000,000\r\nper annum. By steadiness in our present course there is no reason why in a\r\nfew short years the national tax gatherer may not disappear from the door\r\nof the citizen almost entirely. With the revenue stamp dispensed by\r\npostmasters in every community, a tax upon liquors of all sorts and tobacco\r\nin all its forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put a\r\nduty only upon those articles which we could dispense with, known as\r\nluxuries, and on those which we use more of than we produce, revenue enough\r\nmay be raised after a few years of peace and consequent reduction of\r\nindebtedness to fulfill all our obligations. A further reduction of\r\nexpenses, in addition to a reduction of interest account, may be relied on\r\nto make this practicable. Revenue reform, if it means this, has my hearty\r\nsupport. If it implies a collection of all the revenue for the support of\r\nthe Government, for the payment of principal and interest of the public\r\ndebt, pensions, etc., by directly taxing the people, then I am against\r\nrevenue reform, and confidently believe the people are with me. If it means\r\nfailure to provide the necessary means to defray all the expenses of\r\nGovernment, and thereby repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then I\r\nam still more opposed to such kind of revenue reform. Revenue reform has\r\nnot been defined by any of its advocates to my knowledge, but seems to be\r\naccepted as something which is to supply every man's wants without any cost\r\nor effort on his part.\r\n\r\nA true revenue reform can not be made in a day, but must be the work of\r\nnational legislation and of time. As soon as the revenue can be dispensed\r\nwith, all duty should be removed from coffee, tea and other articles of\r\nuniversal use not produced by ourselves. The necessities of the country\r\ncompel us to collect revenue from our imports. An army of assessors and\r\ncollectors is not a pleasant sight to the citizen, but that of a tariff for\r\nrevenue is necessary. Such a tariff, so far as it acts as an encouragement\r\nto home production, affords employment to labor at living wages, in\r\ncontrast to the pauper labor of the Old World, and also in the development\r\nof home resources.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of Congress of the 15th day of July, 1870, the Army has\r\ngradually been reduced, so that on the 1st day of January, 1871, the number\r\nof commissioned officers and men will not exceed the number contemplated by\r\nthat law.\r\n\r\nThe War Department building is an old structure, not fireproof, and\r\nentirely inadequate in dimensions to our present wants. Many thousands of\r\ndollars are now paid annually for rent of private buildings to accommodate\r\nthe various bureaus of the Department. I recommend an appropriation for a\r\nnew War Department building, suited to the present and growing wants of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows a very satisfactory reduction in\r\nthe expenses of the Army for the last fiscal year. For details you are\r\nreferred to his accompanying report.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the Navy for the whole of the last year--i.e., from\r\nDecember 1, 1869, the date of the last report--are less than $19,000,000,\r\nor about $1,000,000 less than they were the previous year. The expenses\r\nsince the commencement of this fiscal year--i.e., since July 1--show for\r\nthe five months a decrease of over $2,400,000 from those of the\r\ncorresponding months last year. The estimates for the current year were\r\n$28,205,671.37. Those for next year are $20,683,317, with $955,100\r\nadditional for necessary permanent improvements. These estimates are made\r\nclosely for the mere maintenance of the naval establishment as now is,\r\nwithout much in the nature of permanent improvement. The appropriations\r\nmade for the last and current years were evidently intended by Congress,\r\nand are sufficient only, to keep the Navy on its present footing by the\r\nrepairing and refitting of our old ships.\r\n\r\nThis policy must, of course, gradually but surely destroy the Navy, and it\r\nis in itself far from economical, as each year that it is pursued the\r\nnecessity for mere repairs in ships and navy-yards becomes more imperative\r\nand more costly, and our current expenses are annually increased for the\r\nmere repair of ships, many of which must soon become unsafe and useless. I\r\nhope during the present session of Congress to be able to submit to it a\r\nplan by which naval vessels can be built and repairs made with great saving\r\nupon the present cost.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be wise statesmanship in a Government which represents a\r\ncountry with over 5,000 miles of coast line on both oceans, exclusive of\r\nAlaska, and containing 40,000,000 progressive people, with relations of\r\nevery nature with almost every foreign country, to rest with such\r\ninadequate means of enforcing any foreign policy, either of protection or\r\nredress. Separated by the ocean from the nations of the Eastern Continent,\r\nour Navy is our only means of direct protection to our citizens abroad or\r\nfor the enforcement of any foreign policy.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Postmaster-General shows a most satisfactory\r\nworking of that Department. With the adoption of the recommendations\r\ncontained therein, particularly those relating to a reform in the franking\r\nprivilege and the adoption of the \"correspondence cards,\" a self-sustaining\r\npostal system may speedily be looked for, and at no distant day a further\r\nreduction of the rate of postage be attained.\r\n\r\nI recommend authorization by Congress to the Postmaster-General and\r\nAttorney-General to issue all commissions to officials appointed through\r\ntheir respective Departments. At present these commissions, where\r\nappointments are Presidential, are issued by the State Department. The law\r\nin all the Departments of Government, except those of the Post-Office and\r\nof Justice, authorizes each to issue its own commissions.\r\n\r\nAlways favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention to\r\none abuse of long standing which I would like to see remedied by this\r\nCongress. It is a reform in the civil service of the country. I would have\r\nit go beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of office of clerks and\r\nemployees who do not require \"the advice and consent of the Senate\" to make\r\ntheir appointments complete. I would have it govern, not the tenure, but\r\nthe manner of making all appointments. There is no duty which so much\r\nembarrasses the Executive and heads of Departments as that of appointments,\r\nnor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and\r\nRepresentatives as that of finding places for constituents. The present\r\nsystem does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men, for public\r\nplace. The elevation and purification of the civil service of the\r\nGovernment will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nReform in the management of Indian affairs has received the special\r\nattention of the Administration from its inauguration to the present day.\r\nThe experiment of making it a missionary work was tried with a few agencies\r\ngiven to the denomination of Friends, and has been found to work most\r\nadvantageously. All agencies and superintendencies not so disposed of were\r\ngiven to officers of the Army. The act of Congress reducing the Army\r\nrenders army officers ineligible for civil positions. Indian agencies being\r\ncivil offices, I determined to give all the agencies to such religious\r\ndenominations as had heretofore established missionaries among the Indians,\r\nand perhaps to some other denominations who would undertake the work on the\r\nsame terms--i.e., as a missionary work. The societies selected are allowed\r\nto name their own agents, subject to the approval of the Executive, and are\r\nexpected to watch over them and aid them as missionaries, to Christianize\r\nand civilize the Indian, and to train him in the arts of peace. The\r\nGovernment watches over the official acts of these agents, and requires of\r\nthem as strict an accountability as if they were appointed in any other\r\nmanner. I entertain the confident hope that the policy now pursued will in\r\na few years bring all the Indians upon reservations, where they will live\r\nin houses, and have schoolhouses and churches, and will be pursuing\r\npeaceful and self-sustaining avocations, and where they may be visited by\r\nthe law-abiding white man with the same impunity that he now visits the\r\ncivilized white settlements. I call your special attention to the report of\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs for full information on this subject.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 8,095,413 acres of public land were disposed\r\nof. Of this quantity 3,698,910.05 acres were taken under the homestead law\r\nand 2,159,515.81 acres sold for cash. The remainder was located with\r\nmilitary warrants, college or Indian scrip, or applied in satisfaction of\r\ngrants to railroads or for other public uses. The entries under the\r\nhomestead law during the last year covered 961,545 acres more than those\r\nduring the preceding year. Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to the\r\nfull extent of the means applicable to the purpose. The quantity of land in\r\nmarket will amply supply the present demand. The claim of the settler under\r\nthe homestead or the preemption laws is not, however, limited to lands\r\nsubject to sale at private entry. Any unappropriated surveyed public land\r\nmay, to a limited amount, be acquired under the former laws if the party\r\nentitled to enter under them will comply with the requirements they\r\nprescribe in regard to the residence and cultivation. The actual settler's\r\npreference right of purchase is even broader, and extends to lands which\r\nwere unsurveyed at the time of his settlement. His right was formerly\r\nconfined within much narrower limits, and at one period of our history was\r\nconferred only by special statutes. They were enacted from time to time to\r\nlegalize what was then regarded as an unauthorized intrusion upon the\r\nnational domain. The opinion that the public lands should be regarded\r\nchiefly as a source of revenue is no longer maintained. The rapid\r\nsettlement and successful cultivation of them are now justly considered of\r\nmore importance to our well-being than is the fund which the sale of them\r\nwould produce. The remarkable growth and prosperity of our new States and\r\nTerritories attest the wisdom of the legislation which invites the tiller\r\nof the soil to secure a permanent home on terms within the reach of all.\r\nThe pioneer who incurs the dangers and privations of a frontier life, and\r\nthus aids in laying the foundation of new commonwealths, renders a signal\r\nservice to his country, and is entitled to its special favor and\r\nprotection. These laws secure that object and largely promote the general\r\nwelfare. They should therefore be cherished as a permanent feature of our\r\nland system.\r\n\r\nGood faith requires us to give full effect to existing grants. The\r\ntime-honored and beneficent policy of setting apart certain sections of\r\npublic land for educational purposes in the new States should be continued.\r\nWhen ample provision shall have been made for these objects, I submit as a\r\nquestion worthy of serious consideration whether the residue of our\r\nnational domain should not be wholly disposed of under the provisions the\r\nhomestead and preemption laws.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the swamp and overflowed lands granted to the States in\r\nwhich they are situated, the lands taken under the agricultural-college\r\nacts and for internal-improvement purposes under the act of September,\r\n1841, and the acts supplemental thereto, there had been conveyed up to the\r\nclose of the last fiscal year, by patent or other equivalent title, to\r\nStates and corporations 27,836,257.63 acres for railways, canals, and wagon\r\nroads. It is estimated that an additional quantity of 174,735,523 acres is\r\nstill due under grants for like uses. The policy of thus aiding the States\r\nin building works of internal improvement was inaugurated more than forty\r\nyears since in the grants to Indiana and Illinois, to aid those States in\r\nopening canals to connect the waters of the Wabash with those of Lake Erie\r\nand the waters of the Illinois with those of Lake Michigan. It was\r\nfollowed, with some modifications, in the grant to Illinois of alternate\r\nsections of public land within certain limits of the Illinois Central\r\nRailway. Fourteen States and sundry corporations have received similar\r\nsubsidies in connection with railways completed or in process of\r\nconstruction. As the reserved sections are rated at the double minimum, the\r\nsale of them at the enhanced price has thus in many instances indemnified\r\nthe Treasury for the granted lands. The construction of some of these\r\nthoroughfares has undoubtedly given a vigorous impulse to the development\r\nof our resources and the settlement of the more distant portions of the\r\ncountry. It may, however, be well insisted that much of our legislation in\r\nthis regard has been characterized by indiscriminate and profuse\r\nliberality. The United States should not loan their credit in aid of any\r\nenterprise undertaken by States or corporations, nor grant lands in any\r\ninstance, unless the projected work is of acknowledged national importance.\r\nI am strongly inclined to the opinion that it is inexpedient and\r\nunnecessary to bestow subsidies of either description; but should Congress\r\ndetermine otherwise I earnestly recommend that the right of settlers and of\r\nthe public be more effectually secured and protected by appropriate\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending September 30, 1870, there were filed in the Patent\r\nOffice 19,411 applications for patents, 3,374 caveats, and 160 applications\r\nfor the extension of patents. Thirteen thousand six hundred and twenty-two\r\npatents, including reissues and designs, were issued, 1,010 extended, and\r\n1,089 allowed, but not issued by reason of the nonpayment of the final\r\nfees. The receipts of the office during the year were $136,304.29 in excess\r\nof its expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Census Bureau has been energetically prosecuted. The\r\npreliminary report, containing much information of special value and\r\ninterest, will be ready for delivery during the present session. The\r\nremaining volumes will be completed with all the dispatch consistent with\r\nperfect accuracy in arranging and classifying the returns. We shall thus at\r\nno distant day be furnished with an authentic record of our condition and\r\nresources. It will, I doubt not, attest the growing prosperity of the\r\ncountry, although during the decade which has just closed it was so\r\nseverely tried by the great war waged to maintain its integrity and to\r\nsecure and perpetuate our free institutions.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the sum paid to pensioners, including the cost\r\nof disbursement, was $27,780,811.11, and 1,758 bounty-land warrants were\r\nissued. At its close 198,686 names were on the pension rolls.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the Pension Office have been directed to the severe scrutiny\r\nof the evidence submitted in favor of new claims and to the discovery of\r\nfictitious claims which have been heretofore allowed. The appropriation for\r\nthe employment of special agents for the investigation of frauds has been\r\njudiciously used, and the results obtained have been of unquestionable\r\nbenefit to the service.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of education and agriculture are of great interest to the\r\nsuccess of our republican institutions, happiness, and grandeur as a\r\nnation. In the interest of one a bureau has been established in the\r\nInterior Department--the Bureau of Education; and in the interest of the\r\nother, a separate Department, that of Agriculture. I believe great general\r\ngood is to flow from the operations of both these Bureaus if properly\r\nfostered. I can not commend to your careful consideration too highly the\r\nreports of the Commissioners of Education and of Agriculture, nor urge too\r\nstrongly such liberal legislation as to secure their efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would sum up the policy of the Administration to be a\r\nthorough enforcement of every law; a faithful collection of every tax\r\nprovided for; economy in the disbursement of the same; a prompt payment of\r\nevery debt of the nation; a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the\r\nrequirements of the country will admit; reductions of taxation and tariff,\r\nto be so arranged as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number;\r\nhonest and fair dealings with all other peoples, to the end that war, with\r\nall its blighting consequences, may be avoided, but without surrendering\r\nany right or obligation due to us; a reform in the treatment of Indians and\r\nin the whole civil service of the country; and, finally, in securing a\r\npure, untrammeled ballot, where every man entitled to cast a vote may do\r\nso, just once at each election, without fear of molestation or proscription\r\non account of his political faith, nativity, of color.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\nDecember 4, 1871\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn addressing my third annual message to the law-making branch of the\r\nGovernment it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past year\r\nsuccess has generally attended the effort to execute all laws found upon\r\nthe statute books. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of\r\nlaws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and intent and to enforce\r\nthem accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe past year has, under a wise Providence, been one of general prosperity\r\nto the nation. It has, however, been attended with more than usual\r\nchastisements in the loss of life and property by storm and fire. These\r\ndisasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in\r\nour country and to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign\r\nnations which goes far toward alleviating the distresses occasioned by\r\nthese calamities. The benevolent, who have so generously shared their means\r\nwith the victims of these misfortunes, will reap their reward in the\r\nconsciousness of having performed a noble act and in receiving the grateful\r\nthanks of men, women, and children whose sufferings they have relieved.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be\r\nfriendly. The year has been an eventful one in witnessing two great\r\nnations, speaking one language and having one lineage, settling by peaceful\r\narbitration disputes of long standing and liable at any time to bring those\r\nnations into bloody and costly conflict. An example has thus been set\r\nwhich, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized\r\nnations, and finally be the means of returning to productive industry\r\nmillions of men now maintained to settle the disputes of nations by the\r\nbayonet and the broadside.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been\r\nconcluded since the adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic Majesty, and\r\na copy of the protocols of the conferences of the commissioners by whom it\r\nwas negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions\r\npending between the two nations.\r\n\r\nVarious questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recommend Congress\r\nat an early day to make the necessary provision for the tribunal at Geneva\r\nand for the several commissioners on the part of the United States called\r\nfor by the treaty.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation,\r\nand His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil have each consented, on the joint\r\nrequest of the two powers, to name an arbiter for the tribunal at Geneva. I\r\nhave caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the readiness with which\r\nthe joint request has been complied with, by the appointment of gentlemen\r\nof eminence and learning to these important positions.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor of Germany has been pleased to comply with the\r\njoint request of the two Governments, and has consented to act as the\r\narbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThe contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as between\r\nthemselves certain principles of public law, for which the United States\r\nhave contended from the commencement of their history. They have also\r\nagreed to bring those principles to the knowledge of the other maritime\r\npowers and to invite them to accede to them. Negotiations are going on as\r\nto the form of the note by which the invitation is to be extended to the\r\nother powers.\r\n\r\nI recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to\r\nbring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries\r\nand to the other matters touching the relations of the United States toward\r\nthe British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as the\r\nproper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its\r\npossessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may become\r\noperative before the fishermen of the United States begin to make their\r\narrangements for the coming season.\r\n\r\nI have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted herewith,\r\nto the governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,\r\nIllinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon the governments of those States,\r\nrespectively, the necessary action on their part to carry into effect the\r\nobject of the article of the treaty which contemplates the use of the\r\ncanals, on either side, connected with the navigation of the lakes and\r\nrivers forming the boundary, on terms of equality, by the inhabitants of\r\nboth countries. It is hoped that the importance of the object and the\r\nbenefits to flow therefrom will secure the speedy approval and legislative\r\nsanction of the States concerned.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining the true\r\nposition of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude where it forms the\r\nboundary between the United States and the British North American\r\npossessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the summit of the Rocky\r\nMountains. The early action of Congress on this recommendation would put it\r\nin the power of the War Department to place a force in the field during the\r\nnext summer.\r\n\r\nThe resumption of diplomatic relations between France and Germany has\r\nenabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection extended\r\nto Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the\r\nUnited States in that country. It is just to add that the delicate duty of\r\nthis protection has been performed by the minister and the consul-general\r\nat Paris, and the various consuls in France under the supervision of the\r\nlatter, with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact. Their course\r\nhas received the commendation of the German Government, and has wounded no\r\nsusceptibility of the French.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friendly\r\nfeeling toward the United States, and a desire to harmonize with the\r\nmoderate and just policy which this Government maintains in its relations\r\nwith Asiatic powers, as well as with the South American Republics. I have\r\ngiven assurances that the friendly feelings of that Government are fully\r\nshared by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the consular and naturalization conventions with the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire have been exchanged.\r\n\r\nI have been officially informed of the annexation of the States of the\r\nChurch to the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the capital of that\r\nKingdom to Rome. In conformity with the established policy of the United\r\nStates, I have recognized this change. The ratifications of the new treaty\r\nof commerce between the United States and Italy have been exchanged. The\r\ntwo powers have agreed in this treaty that private property at sea shall be\r\nexempt from capture in case of war between the two powers. The United\r\nStates have spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into the\r\nobligation of nations.\r\n\r\nThe Forty-first Congress, at its third session, made an appropriation for\r\nthe organization of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the claims of\r\ncitizens of the United States against Spain growing out of the insurrection\r\nin Cuba. That commission has since been organized. I transmit herewith the\r\ncorrespondence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be\r\nhoped that this commission will afford the claimants a complete remedy for\r\ntheir injuries.\r\n\r\nIt has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a\r\nconference at Washington between the plenipotentiaries of Spain and the\r\nallied South American Republics, which has resulted in an armistice, with\r\nthe reasonable assurance of a permanent peace.\r\n\r\nThe intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the\r\nUnited States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third son\r\nof the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his\r\nGovernment to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospitable\r\nreception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our\r\nside we share the wishes of that Government. The inexcusable course of the\r\nRussian minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall and\r\nto decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic\r\nrepresentative. It was impossible, with self-respect or with a just regard\r\nto the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. Catacazy to continue to hold\r\nintercourse with this Government after his personal abuse of Government\r\nofficials, and during his persistent interferences, through various means,\r\nwith the relations between the United States and other powers. In\r\naccordance with my wishes, this Government has been relieved of further\r\nintercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the management of the affairs of the\r\nimperial legation has passed into the hands of a gentleman entirely\r\nunobjectionable.\r\n\r\nWith Japan we continue to maintain intimate relations. The cabinet of the\r\nMikado has since the close of the last session of Congress selected\r\ncitizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance in several\r\ndepartments of Government. I have reason to think that this selection is\r\ndue to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which the\r\nUnited States have pursued toward Japan. It is our desire to continue to\r\nmaintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan.\r\nThe correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition\r\non the part of this Government to swerve from its established course.\r\n\r\nPrompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our\r\nshipwrecked sailors on the Korean coast, I instructed our minister at\r\nPeking to endeavor to conclude a convention with Korea for securing the\r\nsafety and humane treatment of such mariners.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force to\r\nprotect him in case of need.\r\n\r\nA small surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast was treacherously\r\nattacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given for explanation and\r\napology for the insult. Neither came. A force was then landed. After an\r\narduous march over a rugged and difficult country, the forts from which the\r\noutrages had been committed were reduced by a gallant assault and were\r\ndestroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vindicated the\r\nhonor of the flag, the expedition returned, finding it impracticable under\r\nthe circumstances to conclude the desired convention. I respectfully refer\r\nto the correspondence relating thereto, herewith submitted, and leave the\r\nsubject for such action as Congress may see fit to take.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable laws\r\nestablishing what is known as the \"free zone\" on the frontier of the United\r\nStates. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and also that more stringent\r\nmeasures may be taken by that Republic for restraining lawless persons on\r\nits frontiers. I hope that Mexico by its own action will soon relieve this\r\nGovernment of the difficulties experienced from these causes.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the various Republics of Central and South America\r\ncontinue, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly.\r\n\r\nI recommend some action by Congress regarding the overdue installments\r\nunder the award of the Venezuelan Claims Commission of 1866. The internal\r\ndissensions of this Government present no justification for the absence of\r\neffort to meet their solemn treaty obligations.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has\r\ntaken the initiatory step toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations\r\nwith that Empire, always cordial, will naturally be made more so by this\r\nact. It is not too much to hope that the Government of Brazil may hereafter\r\nfind it for its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance toward\r\nentire emancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates.\r\n\r\nThe true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to be found in the\r\nelevation and education of its laborers.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject for regret that the reforms in this direction which were\r\nvoluntarily promised by the statesmen of Spain have not been carried out in\r\nits West India colonies. The laws and regulations for the apparent\r\nabolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in\r\nbondage, with no hope of release until their lives become a burden to their\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nI desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the United\r\nStates, or persons claiming to be citizens of the United States, are large\r\nholders in foreign lands of this species of property, forbidden by the\r\nfundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend to Congress to\r\nprovide by stringent legislation a suitable remedy against the holding,\r\nowning or dealing in slaves, or being interested in slave property, in\r\nforeign lands, either as owners, hirers, or mortgagors, by citizens of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the island of Cuba\r\ncontinues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of a\r\nprotracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory, without\r\napparent prospect of an early termination, can not be other than an object\r\nof concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in the\r\naffairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in the\r\nundisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, and the blessings of free\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nOur naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it\r\nshould become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and\r\nproperty of bona fide American citizens and to maintain the dignity of the\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that all pending questions with Spain growing out of the\r\naffairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and conciliation\r\nwhich has hitherto guided the two powers in their treatment of such\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nTo give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic\r\nrelations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the good\r\nopinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its share of\r\nthe commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of the\r\ncommercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to\r\nsupport at least four American youths in each of those countries, to serve\r\nas a part of the official family of our ministers there. Our\r\nrepresentatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the\r\nrepresentatives of Great Britain and of some other powers. As now situated,\r\nour representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and\r\ntranslators upon natives of those countries who know our language\r\nimperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employees in\r\nforeign business houses or the interpreters to other foreign ministers.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of supporting the\r\nAmerican lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco and Japan and\r\nChina, and the Australian line--almost our only remaining lines of ocean\r\nsteamers--and of increasing their services.\r\n\r\nThe national debt has been reduced to the extent of $86,057, 126.80 during\r\nthe year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of\r\ninterest the interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that\r\nnow the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly $17,000,000\r\nless than on the 1st of March, 1869. It was highly desirable that this\r\nrapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the\r\ncountry and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every\r\ndollar of liability without bankrupting them. But in view of the\r\naccomplishment of these desirable ends: of the rapid development of the\r\nresources of the country; its increasing ability to meet large demands, and\r\nthe amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of\r\nthe country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid\r\npayment. I therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff and\r\ninternal-tax law. I recommend that all taxes from internal sources be\r\nabolished, except those collected from spirituous, vinous, and malt\r\nliquors, tobacco in its various forms, and from stamps.\r\n\r\nIn readjusting the tariff I suggest that a careful estimate be made of the\r\namount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after providing\r\nfor the current expenses of the Government, the interest count, and a\r\nsinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such a manner as to\r\nafford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many articles\r\nnot produced at home, but which enter largely into general consumption\r\nthrough articles which are manufactured at home, such as medicines\r\ncompounded, etc., etc., from which very little revenue is derived, but\r\nwhich enter into general use. All such articles I recommend to be placed on\r\nthe \"free list.\" Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would then\r\nrecommend that it be made upon those articles which can best bear it\r\nwithout disturbing home production or reducing the wages of American\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nI have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat what\r\nwill be laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The\r\npresent laws for collecting revenue pay collectors of customs small\r\nsalaries, but provide for moieties (shares in all seizures), which, at\r\nprincipal ports of entry particularly, raise the compensation of those\r\nofficials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me as if this system must\r\nat times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men,\r\nshould such get possession of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of\r\ngoods entered, to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your\r\nattention is respectfully invited to this subject.\r\n\r\nContinued fluctuations in the value of gold, as compared with the national\r\ncurrency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of\r\nthe country, in keeping up prices of all articles necessary in everyday\r\nlife. It fosters a spirit of gambling, prejudicial alike to national morals\r\nand the national finances. If the question can be met as to how to get a\r\nfixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uniformly\r\napproaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained.\r\n\r\nFor the operations of the Army in the past year, the expense of maintaining\r\nit, the estimate for the ensuing year, and for continuing seacoast and\r\nother improvements conducted under the supervision of the War Department, I\r\nrefer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress approved\r\nMarch 3, 1869, which discontinues promotions in the staff corps of the Army\r\nuntil provided for by law. I recommend that the number of officers in each\r\ngrade in the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number in any one\r\ngrade falls below the number so fixed, that the vacancy may be filled by\r\npromotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the office of\r\nchief of a corps becomes vacant the place may be filled by selection from\r\nthe corps in which the vacancy exists.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number\r\nand efficiency of the naval force, without material increase in the expense\r\nof supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted, and is\r\nbeing extended as fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels\r\nas cruisers on the several stations. By this means we have been enabled to\r\noccupy at once a larger extent of cruising grounds, to visit more\r\nfrequently the ports where the presence of our flag is desirable, and\r\ngenerally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the Navy\r\nin time of peace, without exceeding the number of men or the expenditure\r\nauthorized by law.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the Navy has, in addition to its regular service,\r\nsupplied the men and officers for the vessels of the Coast Survey, and has\r\ncompleted the surveys authorized by Congress of the isthmuses of Darien and\r\nTehuantepec, and, under like authority, has sent out an expedition,\r\ncompletely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the report as to the necessity for increasing and\r\nimproving the materiel of the Navy, and the plan recommended for reducing\r\nthe personnel of the service to a peace standard, by the gradual abolition\r\nof certain grades of officers, the reduction of others, and the employment\r\nof some in the service of the commercial marine, are well considered and\r\ndeserve the thoughtful attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that all promotions in the Navy above the rank of captain\r\nbe by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure in the\r\nhigher grades greater efficiency and hold out an incentive to young\r\nofficers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their profession.\r\n\r\nThe present cost of maintaining the Navy, its cost compared with that of\r\nthe preceding year, and the estimates for the ensuing year are contained in\r\nthe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe enlarged receipts of the Post-Office Department, as shown by the\r\naccompanying report of the Postmaster-General, exhibit a gratifying\r\nincrease in that branch of the public service. It is the index of the\r\ngrowth of education and of the prosperity of the people, two elements\r\nhighly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics. With a vast\r\nterritory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring the\r\nservices of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this\r\nDepartment can be made self-sustaining. But a gradual approach to this end\r\nfrom year to year is confidently relied on, and the day is not far distant\r\nwhen the Post-Office Department of the Government will prove a much greater\r\nblessing to the whole people than it is now.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the Postmaster-General for improvements in the\r\nDepartment presided over by him are earnestly recommended to you, special\r\nattention. Especially do I recommend favorable consideration of the plan\r\nfor uniting the telegraphic system of the United States with the postal\r\nsystem. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could\r\nbe much reduced, and the service as well, if not better, rendered. It would\r\nsecure the further advantage of extending the telegraph through portions of\r\nthe country where private enterprise will not construct it. Commerce,\r\ntrade, and, above all, the efforts to bring a people widely separated into\r\na community of interest are always benefited by a rapid intercommunication.\r\nEducation, the groundwork of republican institutions, is encouraged by\r\nincreasing the facilities to gather speedy news from all parts of the\r\ncountry. The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulate\r\neducation. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General for full\r\ndetails of the operations of last year and for comparative statements of\r\nresults with former years.\r\n\r\nThere has been imposed upon the executive branch of the Government the\r\nexecution of the act of Congress approved April 20, 1871, and commonly\r\nknown as the Kuklux law, in a portion of the State of South Carolina. The\r\nnecessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the\r\nCommittee to Investigate Southern Outrages. Under the provisions of the\r\nabove act I issued a proclamation calling the attention of the people of\r\nthe United States to the same, and declaring my reluctance to exercise any\r\nof the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, except in case of\r\nimperative necessity, but making known my purpose to exercise such powers\r\nwhenever it should become necessary to do so for the purpose of securing to\r\nall citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights\r\nguaranteed to them by the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of this law information was received from time to time\r\nthat combinations of the character referred to in this law existed and were\r\npowerful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in certain\r\ncounties in the State of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nCareful investigation was made, and it was ascertained that in nine\r\ncounties of that State such combinations were active and powerful,\r\nembracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local\r\nauthority, and having, among other things, the object of depriving the\r\nemancipated class of the substantial benefits of freedom and of preventing\r\nthe free political action of those citizens who did not sympathize with\r\ntheir own views. Among their operations were frequent scourgings and\r\noccasional assassinations, generally perpetrated at night by disguised\r\npersons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of different\r\npolitical sentiments from their own or freed persons who had shown a\r\ndisposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of\r\ninoffensive and well disposed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless\r\nviolence,\r\n\r\nThereupon, on the 12th of October, 1871, a proclamation was issued, in\r\nterms of the law, calling upon the members of those combinations to\r\ndisperse within five days and to deliver to the marshal or military\r\nofficers of the United States all arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguises,\r\nand other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawful\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThis warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another\r\nproclamation was issued, suspending the privileges of the writ of habeas\r\ncorpus in nine counties in that State.\r\n\r\nDirection was given that within the counties so designated persons\r\nsupposed, upon creditable information, to be members of such unlawful\r\ncombinations should be arrested by the military forces of the United States\r\nand delivered to the marshal, to be dealt with according to law. In two of\r\nsaid counties, York and Spartanburg, many arrests have been made. At the\r\nlast account the number of persons thus arrested was 168. Several hundred,\r\nwhose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree, were\r\nreleased for the present. These have generally made confessions of their\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nGreat caution has been exercised in making these arrests, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person is\r\nnow in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the\r\njudicial tribunals of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about\r\nto take vigorous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, and\r\nthere is good ground for supposing that all of such persons have violated\r\nthe law. A full report of what has been done under this law will be\r\nsubmitted to Congress by the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nIn Utah there still remains a remnant of barbarism, repugnant to\r\ncivilization, to decency, and to the laws of the United States. Territorial\r\nofficers, however, have been found who are willing to perform their duty in\r\na spirit of equity and with a due sense of the necessity of sustaining the\r\nmajesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor any other violation of existing\r\nstatutes will be permitted within the territory of the United States. It is\r\nnot with the religion of the self-styled Saints that we are now dealing,\r\nbut with their practices. They will be protected in the worship of God\r\naccording to the dictates of their consciences, but they will not be\r\npermitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion.\r\n\r\nIt may be advisable for Congress to consider what, in the execution of the\r\nlaws against polygamy, is to be the status of plural wives and their\r\noffspring. The propriety of Congress passing an enabling act authorizing\r\nthe Territorial legislature of Utah to legitimize all children born prior\r\nto a time fixed in the act might be justified by its humanity to these\r\ninnocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably, so far as can\r\nbe judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation.\r\nThrough the exertions of the various societies of Christians to whom has\r\nbeen intrusted the execution of the policy, and the board of commissioners\r\nauthorized by the law of April 10, 1869, many tribes of Indians have been\r\ninduced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to perform\r\nproductive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization.\r\nThey are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those\r\nstill pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity\r\nwhich is left them to avoid extermination.\r\n\r\nI recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy,\r\nnot only because it is humane, Christian like, and economical, but because\r\nit is right.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration also the policy of granting a\r\nTerritorial government to the Indians in the Indian Territory west of\r\nArkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. In doing so every right\r\nguaranteed to the Indian by treaty should be secured. Such a course might\r\nin time be the means of collecting most of the Indians now between the\r\nMissouri and the Pacific and south of the British possessions into one\r\nTerritory or one State. The Secretary of the Interior has treated upon this\r\nsubject at length, and I commend to you his suggestions.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation that the public lands be regarded as a heritage\r\nto our children, to be disposed of only as required for occupation and to\r\nactual settlers. Those already granted have been in great part disposed of\r\nin such a way as to secure access to the balance by the hardy settler who\r\nmay wish to avail himself of them, but caution should be exercised even in\r\nattaining so desirable an object.\r\n\r\nEducational interest may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of the\r\nsale of public lands to settlers. I do not wish to be understood as\r\nrecommending in the least degree a curtailment of what is being done by the\r\nGeneral Government for the encouragement of education.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior submitted with this will give\r\nyou all the information collected and prepared for publication in regard to\r\nthe census taken during the year 1870; the operations of the Bureau of\r\nEducation for the year; the Patent Office; the Pension Office; the Land\r\nOffice, and the Indian Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture gives the operations of his\r\nDepartment for the year. As agriculture is the groundwork of our\r\nprosperity, too much importance can not be attached to the labors of this\r\nDepartment. It is in the hands of an able head, with able assistants, all\r\nzealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of the\r\nnation all useful products adapted to any of the various climates and soils\r\nof our vast territory, and to giving all useful information as to the\r\nmethod of cultivation, the plants, cereals, and other products adapted to\r\nparticular localities. Quietly but surely the Agricultural Bureau is\r\nworking a great national good, and if liberally supported the more widely\r\nits influence will be extended and the less dependent we shall be upon the\r\nproducts of foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus and officials holding\r\npositions of responsibility, and requiring ability and character to fill\r\nproperly, is one to which your attention is invited. But few of the\r\nofficials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of a\r\nfamily, while their duties are such as to involve millions of interest. In\r\nprivate life services demand compensation equal to the services rendered; a\r\nwise economy would dictate the same rule in the Government service.\r\n\r\nI have not given the estimates for the support of Government for the\r\nensuing year, nor the comparative statement between the expenditures for\r\nthe year just passed and the one just preceding, because all these figures\r\nare contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented directly to\r\nCongress. These estimates have my approval.\r\n\r\nMore than six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired\r\nbetween the armies then arrayed against each other--one for the\r\nperpetuation, the other for the destruction, of the Union--it may well be\r\nconsidered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the\r\nfourteenth amendment should be removed. That amendment does not exclude the\r\nballot, but only imposes the disability to hold offices upon certain\r\nclasses. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to\r\nelect officers reflecting the views of the majority. I do not see the\r\nadvantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they\r\nwere before the rebellion of standing and character sufficient to be\r\nelected to positions requiring them to take oaths to support the\r\nConstitution, and admitting to eligibility those entertaining precisely the\r\nsame views, but of less standing in their communities. It may be said that\r\nthe former violated an oath, while the latter did not; the latter did not\r\nhave it in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath, it can not be\r\ndoubted they would have broken it as did the former class. If there are any\r\ngreat criminals, distinguished above all others for the part they took in\r\nopposition to the Government, they might, in the judgment of Congress, be\r\nexcluded from such an amnesty.\r\n\r\nThis subject is submitted for your careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Southern States is, unhappily, not such as all true\r\npatriotic citizens would like to see. Social ostracism for opinion's sake,\r\npersonal violence or threats toward persons entertaining political views\r\nopposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens, prevents\r\nimmigration and the flow of much-needed capital into the States lately in\r\nrebellion. It will be a happy condition of the country when the old\r\ncitizens of these States will take an interest in public affairs,\r\npromulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men representing their\r\nviews, and tolerate the same freedom of expression and ballot in those\r\nentertaining different political convictions.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the act of Congress approved February 21, 1871, a\r\nTerritorial government was organized in the District of Columbia. Its\r\nresults have thus far fully realized the expectations of its advocates.\r\nUnder the direction of the Territorial officers, a system of improvements\r\nhas been inaugurated by means of which Washington is rapidly becoming a\r\ncity worthy of the nation's capital. The citizens of the District having\r\nvoluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose of\r\ncontributing to the adornment of the seat of Government, I recommend\r\nliberal appropriations on the part of Congress, in order that the\r\nGovernment may bear its just share of the expense of carrying out a\r\njudicious system of improvements.\r\n\r\nBy the great fire in Chicago the most important of the Government buildings\r\nin that city were consumed. Those burned had already become inadequate to\r\nthe wants of the Government in that growing city, and, looking to the near\r\nfuture, were totally inadequate. I recommend, therefore, that an\r\nappropriation be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the square\r\non which the burned buildings stood, provided it can be purchased at a fair\r\nvaluation, or provided that the legislature of Illinois will pass a law\r\nauthorizing its condemnation for Government purposes; and also an\r\nappropriation of as much money as can properly be expended toward the\r\nerection of new buildings during this fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe number of immigrants ignorant of our laws, habits, etc., coming into\r\nour country annually has become so great and the impositions practiced upon\r\nthem so numerous and flagrant that I suggest Congressional action for their\r\nprotection. It seems to me a fair subject of legislation by Congress. I can\r\nnot now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints made by\r\nimmigrants of the treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do so during\r\nthe session of Congress, particularly if the subject should receive your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt has been the aim of the Administration to enforce honesty and efficiency\r\nin all public offices. Every public servant who has violated the trust\r\nplaced in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law. If\r\nbad men have secured places, it has been the fault of the system\r\nestablished by law and custom for making appointments, or the fault of\r\nthose who recommend for Government positions persons not sufficiently well\r\nknown to them personally, or who give letters indorsing the characters of\r\noffice seekers without a proper sense of the grave responsibility which\r\nsuch a course devolves upon them. A civil-service reform which can correct\r\nthis abuse is much desired. In mercantile pursuits the business man who\r\ngives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit\r\nfrom a stranger is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of his\r\nfriend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which\r\nwould enforce this principle against all indorsers of persons for public\r\nplace would insure great caution in making recommendations. A salutary\r\nlesson has been taught the careless and the dishonest public servant in the\r\ngreat number of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place\r\nthroughout the country in bringing to punishment those who have proven\r\nrecreant to the trusts confided to them and in elevating to public office\r\nnone but those who possess the confidence of the honest and the virtuous,\r\nwho, it will always be found, comprise the majority of the community in\r\nwhich they live.\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress one year ago I urgently recommended a reform in\r\nthe civil service of the country. In conformity with that recommendation\r\nCongress, in the ninth section of \"An act making appropriations for sundry\r\ncivil expenses of the Government, and for other purposes,\" approved March\r\n3, 1871, gave the necessary authority to the Executive to inaugurate a\r\ncivil-service reform, and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so.\r\nUnder the authority of said act I convened a board of gentlemen eminently\r\nqualified for the work to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed\r\nreform. Their labors are not yet complete, but it is believed that they\r\nwill succeed in devising a plan that can be adopted to the great relief of\r\nthe Executive, the heads of Departments, and members of Congress, and which\r\nwill redound to the true interest of the public service. At all events, the\r\nexperiment shall have a fair trial.\r\n\r\nI have thus hastily summed up the operations of the Government during the\r\nlast year, and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for your\r\nconsideration. I submit them with a confidence that your combined action\r\nwill be wise, statesmanlike, and in the best interests of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\nDecember 2, 1872\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn transmitting to you this my fourth annual message it is with\r\nthankfulness to the Giver of All Good that as a nation we have been blessed\r\nfor the past year with peace at home, peace abroad, and a general\r\nprosperity vouchsafed to but few peoples.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the recent devastating fire which swept from the\r\nearth with a breath, as it were, millions of accumulated wealth in the city\r\nof Boston, there has been no overshadowing calamity within the year to\r\nrecord. It is gratifying to note how, like their fellow-citizens of the\r\ncity of Chicago under similar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens of\r\nBoston are rallying under their misfortunes, and the prospect that their\r\nenergy and perseverance will overcome all obstacles and show the same\r\nprosperity soon that they would had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise we\r\nhave been free from pestilence, war, and calamities, which often overtake\r\nnations; and, as far as human judgment can penetrate the future, no cause\r\nseems to exist to threaten our present peace.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress adjourned in June last, a question had been raised by Great\r\nBritain, and was then pending, which for a time seriously imperiled the\r\nsettlement by friendly arbitration of the grave differences between this\r\nGovernment and that of Her Britannic Majesty, which by the treaty of\r\nWashington had been referred to the tribunal of arbitration which had met\r\nat Geneva, in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which had jeoparded the\r\nwhole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nations in most\r\nunhappy relations toward each other in a manner entirely satisfactory to\r\nthis Government and in accordance with the views and the policy which it\r\nhad maintained.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal, which had convened at Geneva in December, concluded its\r\nlaborious session on the 14th day of September last, on which day, having\r\navailed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to\r\naward a sum in gross, it made its decision, whereby it awarded the sum of\r\n$15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the\r\nUnited States for the satisfaction of all the claims referred to its\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThis decision happily disposes of a long-standing difference between the\r\ntwo Governments, and, in connection with another award, made by the German\r\nEmperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these two\r\nGovernments without a shadow upon the friendly relations which it is my\r\nsincere hope may forever remain equally unclouded.\r\n\r\nThe report of the agent of the United States appointed to attend the Geneva\r\ntribunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of the\r\narbitrators, the arguments of the counsel of both Governments, the award of\r\nthe tribunal, and the opinions given by the several arbitrators, is\r\ntransmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nI have caused to be communicated to the heads of the three friendly powers\r\nwho complied with the joint request made to them under the treaty the\r\nthanks of this Government for the appointment of arbitrators made by them\r\nrespectively, and also my thanks to the eminent personages named by them,\r\nand my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality, and great\r\nability with which they discharged their arduous and high functions.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government has communicated to me the appreciation by Her\r\nMajesty of the ability and indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams,\r\nthe arbitrator named on the part of this Government during the protracted\r\ninquiries and discussions of the tribunal. I cordially unite with Her\r\nMajesty in this appreciation.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the agent of the United States before the tribunal to record\r\nmy high appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience, and the\r\nprudence and discretion with which he has conducted the very responsible\r\nand delicate duties committed to him, as it is also due to the learned and\r\neminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this Government to\r\nexpress my sense of the talents and wisdom which they brought to bear in\r\nthe attainment of the result so happily reached.\r\n\r\nIt will be the province of Congress to provide for the distribution among\r\nthose who may be entitled to it of their respective shares of the money to\r\nbe paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the date\r\nof the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a\r\nproper examination of the several cases in which indemnification may be\r\ndue. I consequently recommend the creation of a board of commissioners for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nBy the thirty-fourth article of the treaty of Washington the respective\r\nclaims of the United States and of Great Britain in their construction of\r\nthe treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, defining the boundary line between\r\ntheir respective territories, were submitted to the arbitration and award\r\nof His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of those claims is\r\nmost in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1846.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake the\r\narbitration, has the earnest thanks of this Government and of the people of\r\nthe United States for the labor, pains, and care which he has devoted to\r\nthe consideration of this long-pending difference. I have caused an\r\nexpression of my thanks to be communicated to His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft,\r\nthe representative of this Government at Berlin, conducted the case and\r\nprepared the statement on the part of the United States with the ability\r\nthat his past services justified the public in expecting at his hands. As a\r\nmember of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given rise to the\r\ndiscussion between the two Governments, as the minister to Great Britain\r\nwhen the construction now pronounced unfounded was first advanced, and as\r\nthe agent and representative of the Government to present the case and to\r\nreceive the award, he has been associated with the question in all of its\r\nphases, and in every stage has manifested a patriotic zeal and earnestness\r\nin maintenance of the claim of the United States. He is entitled to much\r\ncredit for the success which has attended the submission.\r\n\r\nAfter a patient investigation of the case and of the statements of each\r\nparty, His Majesty the Emperor, on the 21st day of October last, signed his\r\naward in writing, decreeing that the claim of the Government of the United\r\nStates, that the boundary line between the territories of Her Britannic\r\nMajesty and the United States should be drawn through the Haro Channel, is\r\nmost in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty concluded on\r\nthe 15th of June, 1846, between the Governments of Her Britannic Majesty\r\nand of the United States.\r\n\r\nCopies of the \"case\" presented on behalf of each Government, and of the\r\n\"statement in reply\" of each, and a translation of the award, are\r\ntransmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nThis award confirms the United States in their claim to the important\r\narchipelago of islands lying between the continent and Vancouvers Island,\r\nwhich for more than twenty-six years (ever since the ratification of the\r\ntreaty) Great Britain has contested, and leaves us, for the first time in\r\nthe history of the United States as a nation, without a question of\r\ndisputed boundary between our territory and the possessions of Great\r\nBritain on this continent.\r\n\r\nIt is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt, spontaneous action of Her\r\nMajesty's Government in giving effect to the award. In anticipation of any\r\nrequest from this Government, and before the reception in the United States\r\nof the award signed by the Emperor, Her Majesty had given instructions for\r\nthe removal of her troops which had been stationed there and for the\r\ncessation of all exercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave the\r\nUnited States in the exclusive possession of the lately disputed territory.\r\nI am gratified to be able to announce that the orders for the removal of\r\nthe troops have been executed, and that the military joint occupation of\r\nSan Juan has ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive possession of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes necessary to complete the survey and determination of that\r\nportion of the boundary line (through the Haro Channel) upon which the\r\ncommission which determined the remaining part of the line were unable to\r\nagree. I recommend the appointment of a commission to act jointly with one\r\nwhich may be named by Her Majesty for that purpose.\r\n\r\nExperience of the difficulties attending the determination of our admitted\r\nline of boundary, after the occupation of the territory and its settlement\r\nby those owing allegiance to the respective Governments, points to the\r\nimportance of establishing, by natural objects or other monuments, the\r\nactual line between the territory acquired by purchase from Russia and the\r\nadjoining possessions of Her Britannic Majesty. The region is now so\r\nsparsely occupied that no conflicting interests of individuals or of\r\njurisdiction are likely to interfere to the delay or embarrassment of the\r\nactual location of the line. If deferred until population shall enter and\r\noccupy the territory, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the\r\ntwo Governments in antagonism. I therefore recommend the appointment of a\r\ncommission, to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of\r\nGreat Britain, to determine the line between our Territory of Alaska and\r\nthe conterminous possessions of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I recommended the legislation necessary on the\r\npart of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the\r\ntreaty of Washington of May 8, 1871, relating to the fisheries and to other\r\nmatters touching the relations of the United States toward the British\r\nNorth American possessions, to become operative so soon as the proper\r\nlegislation should be had on the part of Great Britain and its\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nThat legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions had not\r\nthen been had, and during the session of Congress a question was raised\r\nwhich for the time raised a doubt whether any action by Congress in the\r\ndirection indicated would become important. This question has since been\r\ndisposed of, and I have received notice that the Imperial Parliament and\r\nthe legislatures of the provincial governments have passed laws to carry\r\nthe provisions of the treaty on the matters referred to into operation. I\r\ntherefore recommend your early adoption of the legislation in the same\r\ndirection necessary on the part of this Government.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission for determining the boundary line between the United\r\nStates and the British possessions between the Lake of the Woods and the\r\nRocky Mountains has organized and entered upon its work. It is desirable\r\nthat the force be increased, in order that the completion of the survey and\r\ndetermination of the line may be the sooner attained. To this end I\r\nrecommend that a sufficient appropriation be made.\r\n\r\nWith France, our earliest ally; Russia, the constant and steady friend of\r\nthe United States; Germany, with whose Government and people we have so\r\nmany causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the other\r\npowers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message the exchange has been made of the\r\nratifications of a treaty with the Austro-Hungarian Empire relating to\r\nnaturalization; also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting consuls\r\nand trade-marks; also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway relating to\r\nnaturalization; all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session having made an appropriation to defray the\r\nexpense of commissioners on the part of the United States to the\r\nInternational Statistical Congress at St. Petersburg, the persons appointed\r\nin that character proceeded to their destination and attended the sessions\r\nof the congress. Their report shall in due season be laid before you. This\r\ncongress meets at intervals of about three years, and has held its sessions\r\nin several of the countries of Europe. I submit to your consideration the\r\npropriety of extending an invitation to the congress to hold its next\r\nmeeting in the United States. The Centennial Celebration to be held in 1876\r\nwould afford an appropriate occasion for such meeting.\r\n\r\nPreparations are making for the international exposition to be held during\r\nthe next year in Vienna, on a scale of very great magnitude. The tendency\r\nof these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization, and of\r\nthe elevation of industry and of labor, and of the increase of human\r\nhappiness, as well as of greater intercourse and good will between nations.\r\nAs this exposition is to be the first which will have been held in eastern\r\nEurope, it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will be\r\nready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the presentation of their\r\nproductions if encouraged by proper aid and protection.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of\r\none or more agents to represent this Government at the exposition. The\r\nauthority thus given has been exercised, but, in the absence of any\r\nappropriation, there is danger that the important benefits which the\r\noccasion offers will in a large degree be lost to citizens of the United\r\nStates. I commend the subject strongly to your consideration, and recommend\r\nthat an adequate appropriation be made for the purpose.\r\n\r\nTo further aid American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposition, I would\r\nrecommend, in addition to an appropriation of money, that the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between our\r\nAtlantic cities and Trieste, or the most convenient port to Vienna, and\r\nback, their articles for exhibition.\r\n\r\nSince your last session the President of the Mexican Republic,\r\ndistinguished by his high character and by his services to his country, has\r\ndied. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by\r\nthe people a proof of confidence on their part in his patriotism and wisdom\r\nwhich it is believed will be confirmed by the results of his\r\nadministration. It is particularly desirable that nothing should be left\r\nundone by the Government of either Republic to strengthen their relations\r\nas neighbors and friends.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb the\r\nquiet of the settlements on the border between our territory and that of\r\nMexico, and that complaints of wrongs to American citizens in various parts\r\nof the country are made. The revolutionary condition in which the\r\nneighboring Republic has so long been involved has in some degree\r\ncontributed to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that with a more settled\r\nrule of order through the Republic, which may be expected from the present\r\nGovernment, the acts of which just complaint is made will cease.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the commission under the convention with Mexico of the\r\n4th of July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have, unfortunately, been\r\nchecked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been taken\r\nby the two Governments which it is believed will prove successful.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed, pursuant to the joint resolution of Congress\r\nof the 7th of May last, to inquire into depredations on the Texan frontier\r\nhave diligently made investigations in that quarter. Their report upon the\r\nsubject will be communicated to you. Their researches were necessarily\r\nincomplete, partly on account of the limited appropriation made by\r\nCongress. Mexico, on the part of that Government, has appointed a similar\r\ncommission to investigate these outrages. It is not announced officially,\r\nbut the press of that country states that the fullest investigation is\r\ndesired, and that the cooperation of all parties concerned is invited to\r\nsecure that end. I therefore recommend that a special appropriation be made\r\nat the earliest day practicable, to enable the commissioners on the part of\r\nthe United States to return to their labors without delay.\r\n\r\nIt is with regret that I have again to announce a continuance of the\r\ndisturbed condition of the island of Cuba. No advance toward the\r\npacification of the discontented part of the population has been made.\r\nWhile the insurrection has gained no advantages and exhibits no more of the\r\nelements of power or of the prospects of ultimate success than were\r\nexhibited a year ago, Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in its\r\nrepression, and the parties stand apparently in the same relative attitude\r\nwhich they have occupied for a long time past.\r\n\r\nThis contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were its scene at a\r\ndistance from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent to its result,\r\nalthough humanity could not be unmoved by many of its incidents wherever\r\nthey might occur. It is, however, at our door.\r\n\r\nI can not doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is among\r\nthe strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife. A terrible\r\nwrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and\r\nthe introduction of other reforms in the administration of government in\r\nCuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It is\r\ngreatly to be hoped that the present liberal Government of Spain will\r\nvoluntarily adopt this view.\r\n\r\nThe law of emancipation, which was passed more than two years since, has\r\nremained unexecuted in the absence of regulations for its enforcement. It\r\nwas but a feeble step toward emancipation, but it was the recognition of\r\nright, and was hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in harmony with\r\nsentiments of humanity and of justice and in sympathy with the other powers\r\nof the Christian and civilized world.\r\n\r\nWithin the past few weeks the regulations for carrying out the law of\r\nemancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity of\r\nintention of the present Government to carry into effect the law of 1870. I\r\nhave not failed to urge the consideration of the wisdom, the policy, and\r\nthe justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evil\r\nwhich oppresses a race and continues a bloody and destructive contest close\r\nto our border, as well as the expediency and the justice of conceding\r\nreforms of which the propriety is not questioned.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one\r\nof the most active causes of the continuance of the unhappy condition in\r\nCuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those\r\nclaiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as\r\nproperty, but which is forbidden and denounced by the laws of the United\r\nStates. They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws,\r\ncontributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest.\r\nIn my last annual message I referred to this subject, and I again recommend\r\nsuch legislation as may be proper to denounce, and, if not prevent, at\r\nleast to discourage American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to announce that the ratifications of the convention\r\nconcluded under the auspices of this Government between Spain on the one\r\npart and the allied Republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an\r\narmistice, have been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is herewith\r\nsubmitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peace\r\nbetween the same parties.\r\n\r\nThe differences which at one time threatened the maintenance of peace\r\nbetween Brazil and the Argentine Republic it is hoped are in the way of\r\nsatisfactory adjustment.\r\n\r\nWith these States, as with the Republics of Central and of South America,\r\nwe continue to maintain the most friendly relations.\r\n\r\nIt is with regret, however, I announce that the Government of Venezuela has\r\nmade no further payments on account of the awards under the convention of\r\nthe 25th of April, 1866. That Republic is understood to be now almost, if\r\nnot quite, tranquilized. It is hoped, therefore, that it will lose no time\r\nin providing for the unpaid balance of its debt to the United States,\r\nwhich, having originated in injuries to our citizens by Venezuelan\r\nauthorities, and having been acknowledged, pursuant to a treaty, in the\r\nmost solemn form known among nations, would seem to deserve a preference\r\nover debts of a different origin and contracted in a different manner. This\r\nsubject is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such action\r\nas may be deemed proper.\r\n\r\nOur treaty relations with Japan remain unchanged. An imposing embassy from\r\nthat interesting and progressive nation visited this country during the\r\nyear that is passing, but, being unprovided with powers for the signing of\r\na convention in this country, no conclusion in that direction was reached.\r\nIt is hoped, however, that the interchange of opinions which took place\r\nduring their stay in this country has led to a mutual appreciation of the\r\ninterests which may be promoted when the revision of the existing treaty\r\nshall be undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I renew my recommendation of one year ago, that--\r\n\r\nTo give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic\r\nrelations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the good\r\nopinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its share of\r\nthe commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of the\r\ncommercial world, an appropriation be made to support at least four\r\nAmerican youths in each of those countries, to serve as a part of the\r\nofficial family of our ministers there. Our representatives would not even\r\nthen be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain\r\nand of some other powers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan and\r\nChina have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of those\r\ncountries, who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion\r\nthe services of employees in foreign business houses or the interpreters to\r\nother foreign ministers.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made on a previous occasion, of the transfer to\r\nthe Department of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to\r\nbelong, of all the powers and duties in relation to the Territories with\r\nwhich the Department of State is now charged by law or by custom.\r\n\r\nCongress from the beginning of the Government has wisely made provision for\r\nthe relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar provision,\r\nhowever, has hitherto been made for the relief of citizens in distress\r\nabroad other than seamen. It is understood to be customary with other\r\ngovernments to authorize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or\r\nsubjects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropriation to\r\ncarry it into effect are recommended in the case of citizens of the United\r\nStates destitute or sick under such circumstances. It is well known that\r\nsuch citizens resort to foreign countries in great numbers. Though most of\r\nthem are able to bear the expenses incident to locomotion, there are some\r\nwho, through accident or otherwise, become penniless, and have no friends\r\nat home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must either perish,\r\ncast themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or be relieved at the\r\nprivate charge of our own officers, who usually, even with the most\r\nbenevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare for such purposes.\r\n\r\nShould the authority and appropriation asked for be granted, care will be\r\ntaken so to carry the beneficence of Congress into effect that it shall not\r\nbe unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed. TREASURY.\r\n\r\nThe moneys received and covered into the Treasury during the fiscal year\r\nended June 30, 1872, were:\r\n\r\nFrom customs - $216,370,286.77\r\n\r\nFrom sales of public lands - 2,575,714.19\r\n\r\nFrom internal revenue - 130,642,177.72\r\n\r\nFrom tax on national-bank circulation, etc - 6,523,396.39\r\n\r\nFrom Pacific railway companies - 749,861.87\r\n\r\nFrom customs fines, etc - 1,136,442.34\r\n\r\nFrom fees--consular, patent, lands, etc - 2,284,095.92\r\n\r\nFrom miscellaneous - 412,254.71 -\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\nDecember 1, 1873\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe year that has passed since the submission of my last message to\r\nCongress has, especially during the latter part of it, been an eventful one\r\nto the country. In the midst of great national prosperity a financial\r\ncrisis has occurred that has brought low fortunes of gigantic proportions;\r\npolitical partisanship has almost ceased to exist, especially in the\r\nagricultural regions; and, finally, the capture upon the high seas of a\r\nvessel bearing our flag has for a time threatened the most serious\r\nconsequences, and has agitated the public mind from one end of the country\r\nto the other. But this, happily, now is in the course of satisfactory\r\nadjustment, honorable to both nations concerned.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States, however, with most of the other powers\r\ncontinue to be friendly and cordial. With France, Germany, Russia, Italy,\r\nand the minor European powers; with Brazil and most of the South American\r\nRepublics, and with Japan, nothing has occurred during the year to demand\r\nspecial notice. The correspondence between the Department of State and\r\nvarious diplomatic representatives in or from those countries is\r\ntransmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nIn executing the will of Congress, as expressed in its joint resolution of\r\nthe 14th of February last, and in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nresolution, a number of \"practical artisans,\" of \"scientific men,\" and of\r\n\"honorary commissioners\" were authorized to attend the exposition at Vienna\r\nas commissioners on the part of the United States. It is believed that we\r\nhave obtained the object which Congress had in view when it passed the\r\njoint resolution--\"in order to enable the people of the United States to\r\nparticipate in the advantages of the International Exhibition of the\r\nProducts of Agriculture, Manufactures, and the Fine Arts to be held at\r\nVienna.\" I take pleasure in adding that the American exhibitors have\r\nreceived a gratifying number of diplomas and of medals.\r\n\r\nDuring the exposition a conference was held at Vienna for the purpose of\r\nconsultation on the systems prevailing in different countries for the\r\nprotection of inventions. I authorized a representative from the Patent\r\nOffice to be present at Vienna at the time when this conference was to take\r\nplace, in order to aid as far as he might in securing any possible\r\nadditional protection to American inventors in Europe. The report of this\r\nagent will be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is my pleasant duty to announce to Congress that the Emperor of China,\r\non attaining his majority, received the diplomatic representatives of the\r\nWestern powers in person. An account of these ceremonies and of the\r\ninteresting discussions which preceded them will be found in the documents\r\ntransmitted herewith. The accompanying papers show that some advance,\r\nalthough slight, has been made during the past year toward the suppression\r\nof the infamous Chinese cooly trade. I recommend Congress to inquire\r\nwhether additional legislation be not needed on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe money awarded to the United States by the tribunal of arbitration at\r\nGeneva was paid by Her Majesty's Government a few days in advance of the\r\ntime when it would have become payable according to the terms of the\r\ntreaty. In compliance with the provisions of the act of March 3, 1873, it\r\nwas at once paid into the Treasury, and used to redeem, so far as it might,\r\nthe public debt of the United States; and the amount so redeemed was\r\ninvested in a 5 per cent registered bond of the United States for\r\n$15,500,000, which is now held by the Secretary of State, subject to the\r\nfuture disposition of Congress.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation, made at the opening of the last session of\r\nCongress, that a commission be created for the purpose of auditing and\r\ndetermining the amounts of the several \"direct losses growing out of the\r\ndestruction of vessels and their cargoes\" by the Alabama, the Florida, or\r\nthe Shenandoah after leaving Melbourne, for which the sufferers have\r\nreceived no equivalent or compensation, and of ascertaining the names of\r\nthe persons entitled to receive compensation for the same, making the\r\ncomputations upon the basis indicated by the tribunal of arbitration at\r\nGeneva; and that payment of such losses be authorized to an extent not to\r\nexceed the awards of the tribunal at Geneva.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved on the 14th day of February last Congress made provision\r\nfor completing, jointly with an officer or commissioner to be named by Her\r\nBritannic Majesty, the determination of so much of the boundary line\r\nbetween the territory of the United States and the possessions of Great\r\nBritain as was left uncompleted by the commissioners appointed under the\r\nact of Congress of August 11, 1856. Under the provisions of this act the\r\nnorthwest water boundary of the United States has been determined and\r\nmarked in accordance with the award of the Emperor of Germany. A protocol\r\nand a copy of the map upon which the line was thus marked are contained in\r\nthe papers submitted herewith.\r\n\r\nI also transmit a copy of the report of the commissioner for marking the\r\nnorthern boundary between the United States and the British possessions\r\nwest of the Lake of the Woods, of the operations of the commission during\r\nthe past season. Surveys have been made to a point 497 miles west of the\r\nLake of the Woods, leaving about 350 miles to be surveyed, the field work\r\nof which can be completed during the next season.\r\n\r\nThe mixed commission organized under the provisions of the treaty of\r\nWashington for settling and determining the claims of citizens of either\r\npower against the other arising out of acts committed against their persons\r\nor property during the period between April 13, 1861, and April 9, 1865,\r\nmade its final award on the 25th day of September last. It was awarded that\r\nthe Government of the United States should pay to the Government of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty, within twelve months from the date of the award, the sum\r\nof $1,929,819 in gold. The commission disallowed or dismissed all other\r\nclaims of British subjects against the United States. The amount of the\r\nclaims presented by the British Government, but disallowed or dismissed, is\r\nunderstood to be about $93,000,000. It also disallowed all the claims of\r\ncitizens of the United States against Great Britain which were referred to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI recommend the early passage of an act appropriating the amount necessary\r\nto pay this award against the United States.\r\n\r\nI have caused to be communicated to the Government of the King of Italy the\r\nthanks of this Government for the eminent services rendered by Count Corti\r\nas the third commissioner on this commission. With dignity, learning, and\r\nimpartiality he discharged duties requiring great labor and constant\r\npatience, to the satisfaction, I believe, of both Governments. I recommend\r\nlegislation to create a special court, to consist of three judges, who\r\nshall be empowered to hear and determine all claims of aliens upon the\r\nUnited States arising out of acts committed against their persons or\r\nproperty during the insurrection. The recent reference under the treaty of\r\nWashington was confined to claims of British subjects arising during the\r\nperiod named in the treaty; but it is understood that there are other\r\nBritish claims of a similar nature, arising after the 9th of April, 1865,\r\nand it is known that other claims of a like nature are advanced by citizens\r\nor subjects of other powers. It is desirable to have these claims also\r\nexamined and disposed of.\r\n\r\nOfficial information being received from the Dutch Government of a state of\r\nwar between the King of the Netherlands and the Sultan of Acheen, the\r\nofficers of the United States who were near the seat of the war were\r\ninstructed to observe an impartial neutrality. It is believed that they\r\nhave done so.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the convention with Mexico of 1868, having again\r\nbeen legally prolonged, has resumed its business, which, it is hoped, may\r\nbe brought to an early conclusion. The distinguished representative of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty at Washington has kindly consented, with the approval of\r\nhis Government, to assume the arduous and responsible duties of umpire in\r\nthis commission, and to lend the weight of his character and name to such\r\ndecisions as may not receive the acquiescence of both the arbitrators\r\nappointed by the respective Governments.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed pursuant to the authority of Congress to\r\nexamine into the nature and extent of the forays by trespassers from that\r\ncountry upon the herds of Texas have made a report, which will be submitted\r\nfor your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Venezuelan Government has been apprised of the sense of Congress in\r\nregard to the awards of the joint commission under the convention of 25th\r\nApril, 1866, as expressed in the act of the 25th of February last.\r\n\r\nIt is apprehended that that Government does not realize the character of\r\nits obligations under that convention. As there is reason to believe,\r\nhowever, that its hesitancy in recognizing them springs, in part at least,\r\nfrom real difficulty in discharging them in connection with its obligations\r\nto other governments, the expediency of further forbearance on our part is\r\nbelieved to be worthy of your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Government and that of Egypt have latterly shown a disposition\r\nto relieve foreign consuls of the judicial powers which heretofore they\r\nhave exercised in the Turkish dominions, by organizing other tribunals. As\r\nCongress, however, has by law provided for the discharge of judicial\r\nfunctions by consuls of the United States in that quarter under the treaty\r\nof 1830, I have not felt at liberty formally to accept the proposed change\r\nwithout the assent of Congress, whose decision upon the subject at as early\r\na period as may be convenient is earnestly requested.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and determination of Congress,\r\nan application of the Republic of Santo Domingo to this Government to\r\nexercise a protectorate over that Republic.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of Congress the following treaties with foreign\r\npowers have been proclaimed: A naturalization convention with Denmark; a\r\nconvention with Mexico for renewing the Claims Commission; a convention of\r\nfriendship, commerce, and extradition with the Orange Free State, and a\r\nnaturalization convention with Ecuador.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made in my message of December, 1870, that\r\nCongress authorize the Postmaster-General to issue all commissions to\r\nofficials appointed through his Department.\r\n\r\nI invite the earnest attention of Congress to the existing laws of the\r\nUnited States respecting expatriation and the election of nationality by\r\nindividuals. Many citizens of the United States reside permanently abroad\r\nwith their families. Under the provisions of the act approved February 10,\r\n1855, the children of such persons are to be deemed and taken to be\r\ncitizens of the United States, but the rights of citizenship are not to\r\ndescend to persons whose fathers never resided in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt thus happens that persons who have never resided within the United\r\nStates have been enabled to put forward a pretension to the protection of\r\nthe United States against the claim to military service of the government\r\nunder whose protection they were born and have been reared. In some cases\r\neven naturalized citizens of the United States have returned to the land of\r\ntheir birth, with intent to remain there, and their children, the issue of\r\na marriage contracted there after their return, and who have never been in\r\nthe United States, have laid claim to our protection when the lapse of many\r\nyears had imposed upon them the duty of military service to the only\r\ngovernment which had ever known them personally.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1868 it was left, embarrassed by conflicting opinions of\r\ncourts and of jurists, to determine how far the doctrine of perpetual\r\nallegiance derived from our former colonial relations with Great Britain\r\nwas applicable to American citizens. Congress then wisely swept these\r\ndoubts away by enacting that--Any declaration, instruction, opinion,\r\norder, or decision of any officer of this Government which denies,\r\nrestricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation is inconsistent\r\nwith the fundamental principles of this Government. But Congress did not\r\nindicate in that statute, nor has it since done so, what acts are to be\r\ndeemed to work expatriation. For my own guidance in determining such\r\nquestions I required (under the provisions of the Constitution) the opinion\r\nin writing of the principal officer in each of the Executive Departments\r\nupon certain questions relating to this subject. The result satisfies me\r\nthat further legislation has become necessary. I therefore commend the\r\nsubject to the careful consideration of Congress, and I transmit herewith\r\ncopies of the several opinions of the principal officers of the Executive\r\nDepartments, together with other correspondence and pertinent information\r\non the same subject.\r\n\r\nThe United States, who led the way in the overthrow of the feudal doctrine\r\nof perpetual allegiance, are among the last to indicate how their own\r\ncitizens may elect another nationality. The papers submitted herewith\r\nindicate what is necessary to place us on a par with other leading nations\r\nin liberality of legislation on this international question. We have\r\nalready in our treaties assented to the principles which would need to be\r\nembodied in laws intended to accomplish such results. We have agreed that\r\ncitizens of the United States may cease to be citizens and may voluntarily\r\nrender allegiance to other powers. We have agreed that residence in a\r\nforeign land, without intent to return, shall of itself work expatriation.\r\nWe have agreed in some instances upon the length of time necessary for such\r\ncontinued residence to work a presumption of such intent. I invite Congress\r\nnow to mark out and define when and how expatriation can be accomplished;\r\nto regulate by law the condition of American women marrying foreigners; to\r\nfix the status of children born in a foreign country of American parents\r\nresiding more or less permanently abroad, and to make rules for determining\r\nsuch other kindred points as may seem best to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of Congress, I transmitted to the American\r\nminister at Madrid, with instructions to present it to the Spanish\r\nGovernment, the joint resolution approved on the 3d of March last,\r\ntendering to the people of Spain, in the name and on the behalf of the\r\nAmerican people, the congratulations of Congress upon the efforts to\r\nconsolidate in Spain the principles of universal liberty in a republican\r\nform of government.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this new Republic was inaugurated by striking the fetters\r\nfrom the slaves in Porto Rico. This beneficent measure was followed by the\r\nrelease of several thousand persons illegally held as slaves in Cuba. Next,\r\nthe Captain-General of that colony was deprived of the power to set aside\r\nthe orders of his superiors at Madrid, which had pertained to the office\r\nsince 1825. The sequestered estates of American citizens, which had been\r\nthe cause of long and fruitless correspondence, were ordered to be restored\r\nto their owners. All these liberal steps were taken in the face of a\r\nviolent opposition directed by the reactionary slave-holders of Havana, who\r\nare vainly striving to stay the march of ideas which has terminated slavery\r\nin Christendom, Cuba only excepted. Unhappily, however, this baneful\r\ninfluence has thus far succeeded in defeating the efforts of all\r\nliberal-minded men in Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba, and in preventing\r\nthe promised reform in that island. The struggle for political supremacy\r\ncontinues there.\r\n\r\nThe proslavery and aristocratic party in Cuba is gradually arraigning\r\nitself in more and more open hostility and defiance of the home government,\r\nwhile it still maintains a political connection with the Republic in the\r\npeninsula; and although usurping and defying the authority of the home\r\ngovernment whenever such usurpation or defiance tends in the direction of\r\noppression or of the maintenance of abuses, it is still a power in Madrid,\r\nand is recognized by the Government. Thus an element more dangerous to\r\ncontinued colonial relations between Cuba and Spain than that which\r\ninspired the insurrection at Yara--an element opposed to granting any\r\nrelief from misrule and abuse, with no aspirations after freedom,\r\ncommanding no sympathies in generous breasts, aiming to rivet still\r\nstronger the shackles of slavery and oppression--has seized many of the\r\nemblems of power in Cuba, and, under professions of loyalty to the mother\r\ncountry, is exhausting the resources of the island, and is doing acts which\r\nare at variance with those principles of justice, of liberality, and of\r\nright which give nobility of character to a republic. In the interests of\r\nhumanity, of civilization, and of progress, it is to be hoped that this\r\nevil influence may be soon averted.\r\n\r\nThe steamer Virginius was on the 26th day of September, 1870, duly\r\nregistered at the port of New York as a part of the commercial marine of\r\nthe United States. On the 4th of October, 1870, having received the\r\ncertificate of her register in the usual legal form, she sailed from the\r\nport of New York and has not since been within the territorial jurisdiction\r\nof the United States. On the 31st day of October last, while sailing under\r\nthe flag of the United States on the high seas, she was forcibly seized by\r\nthe Spanish gunboat Tornado, and was carried into the port of Santiago de\r\nCuba, where fifty-three of her passengers and crew were inhumanly, and, so\r\nfar at least as relates to those who were citizens of the United States,\r\nwithout due process of law, put to death.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-established principle, asserted by the United States from the\r\nbeginning of their national independence, recognized by Great Britain and\r\nother maritime powers, and stated by the Senate in a resolution passed\r\nunanimously on the 16th of June, 1858, that--American vessels on the high\r\nseas in time of peace, bearing the American flag, remain under the\r\njurisdiction of the country to which they belong, and therefore any\r\nvisitation, molestation, or detention of such vessel by force, or by the\r\nexhibition of force, on the part of a foreign power is in derogation of the\r\nsovereignty of the United States. In accordance with this principle, the\r\nrestoration of the Virginius and the surrender of the survivors of her\r\npassengers and crew, and a due reparation to the flag, and the punishment\r\nof the authorities who had been guilty of the illegal acts of violence,\r\nwere demanded. The Spanish Government has recognized the justice of the\r\ndemand, and has arranged for the immediate delivery of the vessel, and for\r\nthe surrender of the survivors of the passengers and crew, and for a salute\r\nto the flag, and for proceedings looking to the punishment of those who may\r\nbe proved to have been guilty of illegal acts of violence toward citizens\r\nof the United States, and also toward indemnifying those who may be shown\r\nto be entitled to indemnity. A copy of a protocol of a conference between\r\nthe Secretary of State and the Spanish minister, in which the terms of this\r\narrangement were agreed to, is transmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence on this subject with the legation of the United States\r\nin Madrid was conducted in cipher and by cable, and needs the verification\r\nof the actual text of the correspondence. It has seemed to me to be due to\r\nthe importance of the case not to submit this correspondence until the\r\naccurate text can be received by mail. It is expected shortly, and will be\r\nsubmitted when received.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of this subject for the present I wish to renew the\r\nexpression of my conviction that the existence of African slavery in Cuba\r\nis a principal cause of the lamentable condition of the island. I do not\r\ndoubt that Congress shares with me the hope that it will soon be made to\r\ndisappear, and that peace and prosperity may follow its abolition.\r\n\r\nThe embargoing of American estates in Cuba, cruelty to American citizens\r\ndetected in no act of hostility to the Spanish Government, the murdering of\r\nprisoners taken with arms in their hands, and, finally, the capture upon\r\nthe high seas of a vessel sailing under the United States flag and bearing\r\na United States registry have culminated in an outburst of indignation that\r\nhas seemed for a time to threaten war. Pending negotiations between the\r\nUnited States and the Government of Spain on the subject of this capture, I\r\nhave authorized the Secretary of the Navy to put our Navy on a war footing,\r\nto the extent, at least, of the entire annual appropriation for that branch\r\nof the service, trusting to Congress and the public opinion of the American\r\npeople to justify my action.\r\n\r\nAssuming from the action of the last Congress in appointing a Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections to prepare and report to this Congress a\r\nconstitutional amendment to provide a better method of electing the\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States, and also from the\r\nnecessity of such an amendment, that there will be submitted to the State\r\nlegislatures for ratification such an improvement in our Constitution, I\r\nsuggest two others for your consideration:\r\n\r\nFirst. To authorize the Executive to approve of so much of any measure\r\npassing the two Houses of Congress as his judgment may dictate, without\r\napproving the whole, the disapproved portion or portions to be subjected to\r\nthe same rules as now, to wit, to be referred back to the House in which\r\nthe measure or measures originated, and, if passed by a two-thirds vote of\r\nthe two Houses, then to become a law without the approval of the President.\r\nI would add to this a provision that there should be no legislation by\r\nCongress during the last twenty-four hours of its sitting, except upon\r\nvetoes, in order to give the Executive an opportunity to examine and\r\napprove or disapprove bills understandingly.\r\n\r\nSecond. To provide by amendment that when an extra session of Congress is\r\nconvened by Executive proclamation legislation during the continuance of\r\nsuch extra session shall be confined to such subjects as the Executive may\r\nbring before it from time to time in writing.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to be gained by these two amendments are too obvious for me\r\nto comment upon them. One session in each year is provided for by the\r\nConstitution, in which there are no restrictions as to the subjects of\r\nlegislation by Congress. If more are required, it is always in the power of\r\nCongress, during their term of office, to provide for sessions at any time.\r\nThe first of these amendments would protect the public against the many\r\nabuses and waste of public moneys which creep into appropriation bills and\r\nother important measures passing during the expiring hours of Congress, to\r\nwhich otherwise due consideration can not be given.\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Government from all sources for the last fiscal year\r\nwere $333,738,204, and expenditures on all accounts $290,345,245, thus\r\nshowing an excess of receipts over expenditures of $43,392,959. But it is\r\nnot probable that this favorable exhibit will be shown for the present\r\nfiscal year. Indeed, it is very doubtful whether, except with great economy\r\non the part of Congress in making appropriations and the same economy in\r\nadministering the various Departments of Government, the revenues will not\r\nfall short of meeting actual expenses, including interest on the public\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nI commend to Congress such economy, and point out two sources where It\r\nseems to me it might commence, to wit, in the appropriations for public\r\nbuildings in the many cities where work has not yet been commenced; in the\r\nappropriations for river and harbor improvement in those localities where\r\nthe improvements are of but little benefit to general commerce, and for\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\nThere is a still more fruitful source of expenditure, which I will point\r\nout later in this message. I refer to the easy method of manufacturing\r\nclaims for losses incurred in suppressing the late rebellion.\r\n\r\nI would not be understood here as opposing the erection of good,\r\nsubstantial, and even ornamental buildings by the Government wherever such\r\nbuildings are needed. In fact, I approve of the Government owning its own\r\nbuildings in all sections of the country, and hope the day is not far\r\ndistant when it will not only possess them, but will erect in the capital\r\nsuitable residences for all persons who now receive commutation for\r\nquarters or rent at Government expense, and for the Cabinet, thus setting\r\nan example to the States which may induce them to erect buildings for their\r\nSenators. But I would have this work conducted at a time when the revenues\r\nof the country would abundantly justify it.\r\n\r\nThe revenues have materially fallen off for the first five months of the\r\npresent fiscal year from what they were expected to produce, owing to the\r\ngeneral panic now prevailing, which commenced about the middle of September\r\nlast. The full effect of this disaster, if it should not prove a \"blessing\r\nin disguise,\" is yet to be demonstrated. In either event it is your duty to\r\nheed the lesson and to provide by wise and well-considered legislation, as\r\nfar as it lies in your power, against its recurrence, and to take advantage\r\nof all benefits that may have accrued.\r\n\r\nMy own judgment is that, however much individuals may have suffered, one\r\nlong step has been taken toward specie payments; that we can never have\r\npermanent prosperity until a specie basis is reached: and that a specie\r\nbasis can not be reached and maintained until our exports, exclusive of\r\ngold, pay for our imports, interest due abroad, and other specie\r\nobligations, or so nearly so as to leave an appreciable accumulation of the\r\nprecious metals in the country from the products of our mines.\r\n\r\nThe development of the mines of precious metals during the past year and\r\nthe prospective development of them for years to come are gratifying in\r\ntheir results. Could but one-half of the gold extracted from the mines be\r\nretained at home, our advance toward specie payments would be rapid.\r\n\r\nTo increase our exports sufficient currency is required to keep all the\r\nindustries of the country employed. Without this national as well as\r\nindividual bankruptcy must ensue. Undue inflation, on the other hand, while\r\nit might give temporary relief, would only lead to inflation of prices, the\r\nimpossibility of competing in our own markets for the products of home\r\nskill and labor, and repeated renewals of present experiences. Elasticity\r\nto our circulating medium, therefore, and just enough of it to transact the\r\nlegitimate business of the country and to keep all industries employed, is\r\nwhat is most to be desired. The exact medium is specie, the recognized\r\nmedium of exchange the world over. That obtained, we shall have a currency\r\nof an exact degree of elasticity. If there be too much of it for the\r\nlegitimate purposes of trade and commerce, it will flow out of the country.\r\nIf too little, the reverse will result. To hold what we have and to\r\nappreciate our currency to that standard is the problem deserving of the\r\nmost serious consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the present panic has proven that the currency of the\r\ncountry, based, as it is, upon the credit of the country, is the best that\r\nhas ever been devised. Usually in times of such trials currency has become\r\nworthless, or so much depreciated in value as to inflate the values of all\r\nthe necessaries of life as compared with the currency. Everyone holding it\r\nhas been anxious to dispose of it on any terms. Now we witness the reverse.\r\nHolders of currency hoard it as they did gold in former experiences of a\r\nlike nature.\r\n\r\nIt is patent to the most casual observer that much more currency, or money,\r\nis required to transact the legitimate trade of the country during the fall\r\nand winter months, when the vast crops are being removed, than during the\r\nbalance of the year. With our present system the amount in the country\r\nremains the same throughout the entire year, resulting in an accumulation\r\nof all the surplus capital of the country in a few centers when not\r\nemployed in the moving of crops, tempted there by the offer of interest on\r\ncall loans. Interest being paid, this surplus capital must earn this\r\ninterest paid with a profit. Being subject to \"call,\" it can not be loaned,\r\nonly in part at best, to the merchant or manufacturer for a fixed term.\r\nHence, no matter how much currency there might be in the country, it would\r\nbe absorbed, prices keeping pace with the volume, and panics, stringency,\r\nand disasters would ever be recurring with the autumn. Elasticity in our\r\nmonetary system, therefore, is the object to be attained first, and next to\r\nthat, as far as possible, a prevention of the use of other people's money\r\nin stock and other species of speculation. To prevent the latter it seems\r\nto me that one great step would be taken by prohibiting the national banks\r\nfrom paying interest on deposits, by requiring them to hold their reserves\r\nin their own vaults, and by forcing them into resumption, though it would\r\nonly be in legal-tender notes. For this purpose I would suggest the\r\nestablishment of clearing houses for your consideration.\r\n\r\nTo secure the former many plans have been suggested, most, if not all, of\r\nwhich look to me more like inflation on the one hand, or compelling the\r\nGovernment, on the other, to pay interest, without corresponding benefits,\r\nupon the surplus funds of the country during the seasons when otherwise\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\nI submit for your consideration whether this difficulty might not be\r\novercome by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue at any time\r\nto national banks of issue any amount of their own notes below a fixed\r\npercentage of their issue (say 40 per cent), upon the banks' depositing\r\nwith the Treasurer of the United States an amount of Government bonds equal\r\nto the amount of notes demanded, the banks to forfeit to the Government,\r\nsay, 4 per cent of the interest accruing on the bonds so pledged during the\r\ntime they remain with the Treasurer as security for the increased\r\ncirculation, the bonds so pledged to be redeemable by the banks at their\r\npleasure, either in whole or in part, by returning their own bills for\r\ncancellation to an amount equal to the face of the bonds withdrawn. I would\r\nfurther suggest for your consideration the propriety of authorizing\r\nnational banks to diminish their standing issue at pleasure, by returning\r\nfor cancellation their own bills and withdrawing so many United States\r\nbonds as are pledged for the bills returned.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great actual contraction that has taken place in the\r\ncurrency and the comparative contraction continuously going on, due to the\r\nincrease of population, increase of manufactories and all the industries, I\r\ndo not believe there is too much of it now for the dullest period of the\r\nyear. Indeed, if clearing houses should be established, thus forcing\r\nredemption, it is a question for your consideration whether banking should\r\nnot be made free, retaining all the safeguards now required to secure bill\r\nholders. In any modification of the present laws regulating national banks,\r\nas a further step toward preparing for resumption of specie payments, I\r\ninvite your attention to a consideration of the propriety of exacting from\r\nthem the retention as a part of their reserve either the whole or a part of\r\nthe gold interest accruing upon the bonds pledged as security for their\r\nissue. I have not reflected enough on the bearing this might have in\r\nproducing a scarcity of coin with which to pay duties on imports to give it\r\nmy positive recommendation. But your attention is invited to the subject.\r\n\r\nDuring the last four years the currency has been contracted, directly, by\r\nthe withdrawal of 3 per cent certificates, compound-interest notes, and\r\n\"seven-thirty\" bonds outstanding on the 4th of March, 1869, all of which\r\ntook the place of legal-tenders in the bank reserves to the extent of\r\n$63,000,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period there has been a much larger comparative contraction\r\nof the currency. The population of the country has largely increased. More\r\nthan 25,000 miles of railroad have been built, requiring the active use of\r\ncapital to operate them. Millions of acres of land have been opened to\r\ncultivation, requiring capital to move the products. Manufactories have\r\nmultiplied beyond all precedent in the same period of time, requiring\r\ncapital weekly for the payment of wages and for the purchase of material;\r\nand probably the largest of all comparative contraction arises from the\r\norganizing of free labor in the South. Now every laborer there receives his\r\nwages, and, for want of savings banks, the greater part of such wages is\r\ncarried in the pocket or hoarded until required for use.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are thrown out for your consideration, without any\r\nrecommendation that they shall be adopted literally, but hoping that the\r\nbest method may be arrived at to secure such an elasticity of the currency\r\nas will keep employed all the industries of the country and prevent such an\r\ninflation as will put off indefinitely the resumption of specie payments,\r\nan object so devoutly to be wished for by all, and by none more earnestly\r\nthan the class of people most directly interested--those who \"earn their\r\nbread by the sweat of their brow.\" The decisions of Congress on this\r\nsubject will have the hearty support of the Executive.\r\n\r\nIn previous messages I have called attention to the decline in American\r\nshipbuilding and recommended such legislation as would secure to us our\r\nproportion of the carrying trade. Stimulated by high rates and abundance of\r\nfreight, the progress for the last year in shipbuilding has been very\r\nsatisfactory. There has been an increase of about 3 per cent in the amount\r\ntransported in American vessels over the amount of last year. With the\r\nreduced cost of material which has taken place, it may reasonably be hoped\r\nthat this progress will be maintained, and even increased. However, as we\r\npay about $80,000,000 per annum to foreign vessels for the transportation\r\nto a market of our surplus products, thus increasing the balance of trade\r\nagainst us to this amount, the subject is one worthy of your serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"Cheap transportation\" is a subject that has attracted the attention of\r\nboth producers and consumers for the past few years, and has contributed\r\nto, if it has not been the direct cause of, the recent panic and\r\nstringency.\r\n\r\nAs Congress, at its last session, appointed a special committee to\r\ninvestigate this whole subject during the vacation and report at this\r\nsession, I have nothing to recommend until their report is read.\r\n\r\nThere is one work, however, of a national character, in which the greater\r\nportion of the East and the West, the North and the South, are equally\r\ninterested, to which I will invite your attention.\r\n\r\nThe State of New York has a canal connecting Lake Erie with tide water on\r\nthe Hudson River. The State of Illinois has a similar work connecting Lake\r\nMichigan with navigable water on the Illinois River, thus making water\r\ncommunication inland between the East and the West and South. These great\r\nartificial water courses are the property of the States through which they\r\npass, and pay toll to those States. Would it not be wise statesmanship to\r\npledge these States that if they will open these canals for the passage of\r\nlarge vessels the General Government will look after and keep in navigable\r\ncondition the great public highways with which they connect, to wit, the\r\nOverslaugh on the Hudson, the St. Clair Flats, and the Illinois and\r\nMississippi rivers? This would be a national work; one of great value to\r\nthe producers of the West and South in giving them cheap transportation for\r\ntheir produce to the seaboard and a market, and to the consumers in the\r\nEast in giving them cheaper food, particularly of those articles of food\r\nwhich do not find a foreign market, and the prices of which, therefore, are\r\nnot regulated by foreign demands. The advantages of such a work are too\r\nobvious for argument. I submit the subject to you, therefore, without\r\nfurther comment.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to regain our lost commerce and carrying trade I have\r\nheretofore called attention to the States south of us offering a field\r\nwhere much might be accomplished. To further this object I suggest that a\r\nsmall appropriation be made, accompanied with authority for the Secretary\r\nof the Navy to fit out a naval vessel to ascend the Amazon River to the\r\nmouth of the Madeira; thence to explore that river and its tributaries into\r\nBolivia, and to report to Congress at its next session, or as soon as\r\npracticable, the accessibility of the country by water, its resources, and\r\nthe population so reached. Such an exploration would cost but little; it\r\ncan do no harm, and may result in establishing a trade of value to both\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIn further connection with the Treasury Department I would recommend a\r\nrevision and codification of the tariff laws and the opening of more mints\r\nfor coining money, with authority to coin for such nations as may apply.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is invited to the recommendations contained in\r\nthe report of the Secretary of War herewith accompanying.\r\n\r\nThe apparent great cost of supporting the Army is fully explained by this\r\nreport, and I hope will receive your attention.\r\n\r\nWhile inviting your general attention to all the recommendations made by\r\nthe Secretary of War, there are two which I would especially invite you to\r\nconsider: First, the importance of preparing for war in time of peace by\r\nproviding proper armament for our seacoast defenses. Proper armament is of\r\nvastly more importance than fortifications. The latter can be supplied very\r\nspeedily for temporary purposes when needed; the former can not. The second\r\nis the necessity of reopening promotion in the staff corps of the Army.\r\nParticularly is this necessity felt in the Medical, Pay, and Ordnance\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nAt this time it is necessary to employ \"contract surgeons\" to supply the\r\nnecessary medical attendance required by the Army.\r\n\r\nWith the present force of the Pay Department it is now difficult to make\r\nthe payments to troops provided for by law. Long delays in payments are\r\nproductive of desertions and other demoralization, and the law prohibits\r\nthe payment of troops by other than regular army paymasters.\r\n\r\nThere are now sixteen vacancies in the Ordnance Department, thus leaving\r\nthat branch of the service without sufficient officers to conduct the\r\nbusiness of the different arsenals on a large scale if ever required.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year our Navy has been depleted by the sale of some vessels\r\nno longer fit for naval service and by the condemnation of others not yet\r\ndisposed of. This, however, has been more than compensated for by the\r\nrepair of six of the old wooden ships and by the building of eight new\r\nsloops of war, authorized by the last Congress. The building of these\r\nlatter has occurred at a doubly fortunate time. They are about being\r\ncompleted at a time when they may possibly be much needed, and the work\r\nupon them has not only given direct employment to thousands of men, but has\r\nno doubt been the means of keeping open establishments for other work at a\r\ntime of great financial distress.\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the last month, however, the distressing\r\noccurrences which have taken place in the waters of the Caribbean Sea,\r\nalmost on our very seaboard, while they illustrate most forcibly the\r\nnecessity always existing that a nation situated like ours should maintain\r\nin a state of possible efficiency a navy adequate to its responsibilities,\r\nhas at the same time demanded that all the effective force we really have\r\nshall be put in immediate readiness for warlike service. This has been and\r\nis being done promptly and effectively, and I am assured that all the\r\navailable ships and every authorized man of the American Navy will be ready\r\nfor whatever action is required for the safety of our citizens or the\r\nmaintenance of our honor. This, of course, will require the expenditure in\r\na short time of some of the appropriations which were calculated to extend\r\nthrough the fiscal year, but Congress will, I doubt not, understand and\r\nappreciate the emergency, and will provide adequately not only for the\r\npresent preparation, but for the future maintenance of our naval force. The\r\nSecretary of the Navy has during the past year been quietly putting some of\r\nour most effective monitors in condition for service, and thus the exigency\r\nfinds us in a much better condition for work than we could possibly have\r\nbeen without his action.\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nA complete exhibit is presented in the accompanying report of the\r\npostmaster-General of the operations of the Post-Office Department during\r\nthe year. The ordinary postal revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1873, amounted to $22,996,741.57, and the expenditures of all kinds to\r\n$29,084,945.67. The increase of revenues over 1872 was $1,081,315.20, and\r\nthe increase of expenditures $2,426,753.36.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the payments made from special appropriations for mail\r\nsteamship lines, the amount drawn from the General Treasury to meet\r\ndeficiencies was $5,265,475. The constant and rapid extension of our postal\r\nservice, particularly upon railways, and the improved facilities for the\r\ncollection, transmission, distribution, and delivery of the mails which are\r\nconstantly being provided account for the increased expenditures of this\r\npopular branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nThe total number of post-offices in operation on June 30, 1873, was 33,244,\r\na net increase of 1,381 over the number reported the preceding year. The\r\nnumber of Presidential offices was 1,363, an increase of 163 during the\r\nyear. The total length of railroad mail routes at the close of the year was\r\n63,457 miles, an increase of 5,546 miles over the year 1872. Fifty-nine\r\nrailway post-office lines were in operation June 30, 1873, extending over\r\n14,866 miles of railroad routes and performing an aggregate service of\r\n34,925 miles daily.\r\n\r\nThe number of letters exchanged with foreign countries was 27,459,185, an\r\nincrease of 3,096,685 over the previous year, and the postage thereon\r\namounted to $2,021,310.86. The total weight of correspondence exchanged in\r\nthe mails with European countries exceeded 912 tons, an increase of 92 tons\r\nover the previous year. The total cost of the United States ocean steamship\r\nservice, including $725,000 paid from special appropriations to subsidized\r\nlines of mail steamers, was $1,047,271.35.\r\n\r\nNew or additional postal conventions have been concluded with Sweden,\r\nNorway, Belgium, Germany, Canada, Newfoundland, and Japan, reducing postage\r\nrates on correspondence exchanged with those countries; and further efforts\r\nhave been made to conclude a satisfactory postal convention with France,\r\nbut without success.\r\n\r\nI invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the suggestions and\r\nrecommendations of the Postmaster-General for an extension of the\r\nfree-delivery system in all cities having a population of not less than\r\n10,000; for the prepayment of postage on newspapers and other printed\r\nmatter of the second class; for a uniform postage and limit of weight on\r\nmiscellaneous matter; for adjusting the compensation of all postmasters not\r\nappointed by the President, by the old method of commissions on the actual\r\nreceipts of the office, instead of the present mode of fixing the salary in\r\nadvance upon special returns; and especially do I urge favorable action by\r\nCongress on the important recommendations of the Postmaster-General for the\r\nestablishment of United States postal savings depositories.\r\n\r\nYour attention is also again called to a consideration of the question of\r\npostal telegraphs and the arguments adduced in support thereof, in the hope\r\nthat you may take such action in connection therewith as in your judgment\r\nwill most contribute to the best interests of the country.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Utah require your early and special attention. The Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, in the case of Clinton vs. Englebrecht, decided that\r\nthe United States marshal of that Territory could not lawfully summon\r\njurors for the district courts; and those courts hold that the Territorial\r\nmarshal can not lawfully perform that duty, because he is elected by the\r\nlegislative assembly, and not appointed as provided for in the act\r\norganizing the Territory. All proceedings at law are practically abolished\r\nby these decisions, and there have been but few or no jury trials in the\r\ndistrict courts of that Territory since the last session of Congress.\r\nProperty is left without protection by the courts, and crimes go\r\nunpunished. To prevent anarchy there it is absolutely necessary that\r\nCongress provide the courts with some mode of obtaining jurors, and I\r\nrecommend legislation to that end, and also that the probate courts of the\r\nTerritory, now assuming to issue writs of injunction and habeas corpus and\r\nto try criminal cases and questions as to land titles, be denied all\r\njurisdiction not possessed ordinarily by courts of that description.\r\n\r\nI have become impressed with the belief that the act approved March 2,\r\n1867, entitled \"An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy\r\nthroughout the United States,\" is productive of more evil than good at this\r\ntime. Many considerations might be urged for its total repeal, but, if this\r\nis not considered advisable, I think it will not be seriously questioned\r\nthat those portions of said act providing for what is called involuntary\r\nbankruptcy operate to increase the financial embarrassments of the country.\r\nCareful and prudent men very often become involved in debt in the\r\ntransaction of their business, and though they may possess ample property,\r\nif it could be made available for that purpose, to meet all their\r\nliabilities, yet, on account of the extraordinary scarcity of money, they\r\nmay be unable to meet all their pecuniary obligations as they become due,\r\nin consequence of which they are liable to be prostrated in their business\r\nby proceedings in bankruptcy at the instance of unrelenting creditors.\r\nPeople are now so easily alarmed as to monetary matters that the mere\r\nfiling of a petition in bankruptcy by an unfriendly creditor will\r\nnecessarily embarrass, and oftentimes accomplish the financial ruin, of a\r\nresponsible business man. Those who otherwise might make lawful and just\r\narrangements to relieve themselves from difficulties produced by the\r\npresent stringency in money are prevented by their constant exposure to\r\nattack and disappointment by proceedings against them in bankruptcy, and,\r\nbesides, the law is made use of in many cases by obdurate creditors to\r\nfrighten or force debtors into a compliance with their wishes and into acts\r\nof injustice to other creditors and to themselves. I recommend that so much\r\nof said act as provides for involuntary bankruptcy on account of the\r\nsuspension of payment be repealed.\r\n\r\nYour careful attention is invited to the subject of claims against the\r\nGovernment and to the facilities afforded by existing laws for their\r\nprosecution. Each of the Departments of State, Treasury, and War has\r\ndemands for many millions of dollars upon its files, and they are rapidly\r\naccumulating. To these may be added those now pending before Congress, the\r\nCourt of Claims, and the Southern Claims Commission, making in the\r\naggregate an immense sum. Most of these grow out of the rebellion, and are\r\nintended to indemnify persons on both sides for their losses during the\r\nwar; and not a few of them are fabricated and supported by false testimony.\r\nProjects are on foot, it is believed, to induce Congress to provide for new\r\nclasses of claims, and to revive old ones through the repeal or\r\nmodification of the statute of limitations, by which they are now barred. I\r\npresume these schemes, if proposed, will be received with little favor by\r\nCongress, and I recommend that persons having claims against the United\r\nStates cognizable by any tribunal or Department thereof be required to\r\npresent them at an early day, and that legislation be directed as far as\r\npracticable to the defeat of unfounded and unjust demands upon the\r\nGovernment; and I would suggest, as a means of preventing fraud, that\r\nwitnesses be called upon to appear in person to testify before those\r\ntribunals having said claims before them for adjudication. Probably the\r\nlargest saving to the National Treasury can be secured by timely\r\nlegislation on these subjects of any of the economic measures that will be\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nYou will be advised of the operations of the Department of Justice by the\r\nreport of the Attorney-General, and I invite your attention to the\r\namendments of existing laws suggested by him, with the view of reducing the\r\nexpenses of that Department.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nThe policy inaugurated toward the Indians at the beginning of the last\r\nAdministration has been steadily pursued, and, I believe, with beneficial\r\nresults. It will be continued with only such modifications as time and\r\nexperience may demonstrate as necessary.\r\n\r\nWith the encroachment of civilization upon the Indian reservations and\r\nhunting grounds, disturbances have taken place between the Indians and\r\nwhites during the past year, and probably will continue to do so until each\r\nrace appreciates that the other has rights which must be respected.\r\n\r\nThe policy has been to collect the Indians as rapidly as possible on\r\nreservations, and as far as practicable within what is known as the Indian\r\nTerritory, and to teach them the arts of civilization and self-support.\r\nWhere found off their reservations, and endangering the peace and safety of\r\nthe whites, they have been punished, and will continue to be for like\r\noffenses.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Territory south of Kansas and west of Arkansas is sufficient in\r\narea and agricultural resources to support all the Indians east of the\r\nRocky Mountains. In time, no doubt, all of them, except a few who may elect\r\nto make their homes among white people, will be collected there. As a\r\npreparatory step for this consummation, I am now satisfied that a\r\nTerritorial form of government should be given them, which will secure the\r\ntreaty rights of the original settlers and protect their homesteads from\r\nalienation for a period of twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Patent Office are growing to such a magnitude and the\r\naccumulation of material is becoming so great that the necessity of more\r\nroom is becoming more obvious day by day. I respectfully invite your\r\nattention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner\r\nof Patents on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe business of the General Land Office exhibits a material increase in all\r\nits branches during the last fiscal year. During that time there were\r\ndisposed of out of the public lands 13,030,606 acres, being an amount\r\ngreater by 1,165,631 acres than was disposed of during the preceding year.\r\nOf the amount disposed of, 1,626,266 acres were sold for cash, 214,940\r\nacres were located with military land warrants, 3,793,612 acres were taken\r\nfor homesteads, 653,446 acres were located with agricultural-college scrip,\r\n6,083,536 acres were certified by railroads, 76,576 acres were granted to\r\nwagon roads, 238,548 acres were approved to States as swamp lands, 138,681\r\nacres were certified for agricultural colleges, common schools,\r\nuniversities, and seminaries, 190,775 acres were approved to States for\r\ninternal improvements, and 14,222 acres were located with Indian scrip. The\r\ncash receipts during the same time were $3,408,515.50, being $190,415.50 in\r\nexcess of the receipts of the previous year. During the year 30,488,132\r\nacres of public land were surveyed, an increase over the amount surveyed\r\nthe previous year of 1,037,193 acres, and, added to the area previously\r\nsurveyed, aggregates 616,554,895 acres which have been surveyed, leaving\r\n1,218,443,505 acres of the public land still unsurveyed.\r\n\r\nThe increased and steadily increasing facilities for reaching our\r\nunoccupied public domain and for the transportation of surplus products\r\nenlarge the available field for desirable homestead locations, thus\r\nstimulating settlement and extending year by year in a gradually increasing\r\nratio the area of occupation and cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe expressed desire of the representatives of a large colony of citizens\r\nof Russia to emigrate to this country, as is understood, with the consent\r\nof their Government, if certain concessions can be made to enable them to\r\nsettle in a compact colony, is of great interest, as going to show the\r\nlight in which our institutions are regarded by an industrious,\r\nintelligent, and wealthy people, desirous of enjoying civil and religious\r\nliberty; and the acquisition of so large an immigration of citizens of a\r\nsuperior class would without doubt be of substantial benefit to the\r\ncountry. I invite attention to the suggestion of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior in this behalf.\r\n\r\nThere was paid during the last fiscal year for pensions, including the\r\nexpense of disbursement, $29,185,289.62, being an amount less by\r\n$984,050.98 than was expended for the same purpose the preceding year.\r\nAlthough this statement of expenditures would indicate a material reduction\r\nin amount compared with the preceding year, it is believed that the changes\r\nin the pension laws at the last session of Congress will absorb that amount\r\nthe current year. At the close of the last fiscal year there were on the\r\npension rolls 99,804 invalid military pensioners and 112,088 widows,\r\norphans, and dependent relatives of deceased soldiers, making a total of\r\nthat class of 211,892; 18,266 survivors of the War of 1812 and 5,058 widows\r\nof soldiers of that war pensioned under the act of Congress of February 14,\r\n1871, making a total of that class of 23,319; 1,480 invalid navy pensioners\r\nand 1,770 widows, orphans, and dependent relatives of deceased officers,\r\nsailors, and marines of the Navy, making a total of navy pensioners of\r\n3,200, and a grand total of pensioners of 311 classes of 238,411, showing a\r\nnet increase during the last fiscal year of 6,182. During the last year the\r\nnames of 16,405 pensioners were added to the rolls, and 10,223 names were\r\ndropped therefrom for various causes.\r\n\r\nThe system adopted for the detection of frauds against the Government in\r\nthe matter of pensions has been productive of satisfactory results, but\r\nlegislation is needed to provide, if possible, against the perpetration of\r\nsuch frauds in future.\r\n\r\nThe evidently increasing interest in the cause of education is a most\r\nencouraging feature in the general progress and prosperity of the country,\r\nand the Bureau of Education is earnest in its efforts to give proper\r\ndirection to the new appliances and increased facilities which are being\r\noffered to aid the educators of the country in their great work.\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Census has been completed, the report thereof published and\r\ndistributed, and the working force of the Bureau disbanded. The Secretary\r\nof the Interior renews his recommendation for a census to be taken in 1875,\r\nto which subject the attention of Congress is invited. The original\r\nsuggestion in that behalf has met with the general approval of the country;\r\nand even if it be not deemed advisable at present to provide for a regular\r\nquinquennial census, a census taken in 1875, the report of which could be\r\ncompleted and published before the one hundredth anniversary of our\r\nnational independence, would be especially interesting and valuable, as\r\nshowing the progress of the country during the first century of our\r\nnational existence. It is believed, however, that a regular census every\r\nfive years would be of substantial benefit to the country, inasmuch as our\r\ngrowth hitherto has been so rapid that the results of the decennial census\r\nare necessarily unreliable as a basis of estimates for the latter years of\r\na decennial period.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\nUnder the very efficient management of the governor and the board of public\r\nworks of this District the city of Washington is rapidly assuming the\r\nappearance of a capital of which the nation may well be proud. From being a\r\nmost unsightly place three years ago, disagreeable to pass through in\r\nsummer in consequence of the dust arising from unpaved streets, and almost\r\nimpassable in the winter from the mud, it is now one of the most sightly\r\ncities in the country, and can boast of being the best paved.\r\n\r\nThe work has been done systematically, the plans, grades, location of\r\nsewers, water and gas mains being determined upon before the work was\r\ncommenced, thus securing permanency when completed. I question whether so\r\nmuch has ever been accomplished before in any American city for the same\r\nexpenditures. The Government having large reservations in the city, and the\r\nnation at large having an interest in their capital, I recommend a liberal\r\npolicy toward the District of Columbia, and that the Government should bear\r\nits just share of the expense of these improvements. Every citizen visiting\r\nthe capital feels a pride in its growing beauty, and that he too is part\r\nowner in the investments made here.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to Congress the propriety of promoting the establishment in\r\nthis District of an institution of learning, or university of the highest\r\nclass, by the donation of lands. There is no place better suited for such\r\nan institution than the national capital. There is no other place in which\r\nevery citizen is so directly interested.\r\n\r\nCIVIL-SERVICE REFORM.\r\n\r\nIn three successive messages to Congress I have called attention to the\r\nsubject of \"civil-service reform.\"\r\n\r\nAction has been taken so far as to authorize the appointment of a board to\r\ndevise rules governing methods of making appointments and promotions, but\r\nthere never has been any action making these rules, or any rules, binding,\r\nor even entitled to observance, where persons desire the appointment of a\r\nfriend or the removal of an official who may be disagreeable to them.\r\n\r\nTo have any rules effective they must have the acquiescence of Congress as\r\nwell as of the Executive. I commend, therefore, the subject to your\r\nattention, and suggest that a special committee of Congress might confer\r\nwith the Civil-Service Board during the present session for the purpose of\r\ndevising such rules as can be maintained, and which will secure the\r\nservices of honest and capable officials, and which will also protect them\r\nin a degree of independence while in office.\r\n\r\nProper rules will protect Congress, as well as the Executive, from much\r\nneedless persecution, and will prove of great value to the public at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nI would recommend for your favorable consideration the passage of an\r\nenabling act for the admission of Colorado as a State in the Union. It\r\npossesses all the elements of a prosperous State, agricultural and mineral,\r\nand, I believe, has a population now to justify such admission. In\r\nconnection with this I would also recommend the encouragement of a canal\r\nfor purposes of irrigation from the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains to\r\nthe Missouri River. As a rule I am opposed to further donations of public\r\nlands for internal improvements owned and controlled by private\r\ncorporations, but in this instance I would make an exception. Between the\r\nMissouri River and the Rocky Mountains there is an arid belt of public land\r\nfrom 300 to 500 miles in width, perfectly valueless for the occupation of\r\nman, for the want of sufficient rain to secure the growth of any product.\r\nAn irrigating canal would make productive a belt as wide as the supply of\r\nwater could be made to spread over across this entire country, and would\r\nsecure a cordon of settlements connecting the present population of the\r\nmountain and mining regions with that of the older States. All the land\r\nreclaimed would be clear gain. If alternate sections are retained by the\r\nGovernment, I would suggest that the retained sections be thrown open to\r\nentry under the homestead laws, or sold to actual settlers for a very low\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nI renew my previous recommendation to Congress for general amnesty. The\r\nnumber engaged in the late rebellion yet laboring under disabilities is\r\nvery small, but enough to keep up a constant irritation. No possible danger\r\ncan accrue to the Government by restoring them to eligibility to hold\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nI suggest for your consideration the enactment of a law to better secure\r\nthe civil rights which freedom should secure, but has not effectually\r\nsecured, to the enfranchised slave.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\nDecember 7, 1874\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nSince the convening of Congress one year ago the nation has undergone a\r\nprostration in business and industries such as has not been witnessed with\r\nus for many years. Speculation as to the causes for this prostration might\r\nbe indulged in without profit, because as many theories would be advanced\r\nas there would be independent writers--those who expressed their own views\r\nwithout borrowing--upon the subject. Without indulging in theories as to\r\nthe cause of this prostration, therefore, I will call your attention only\r\nto the fact, and to some plain questions as to which it would seem there\r\nshould be no disagreement.\r\n\r\nDuring this prostration two essential elements of prosperity have been most\r\nabundant--labor and capital. Both have been largely unemployed. Where\r\nsecurity has been undoubted, capital has been attainable at very moderate\r\nrates. Where labor has been wanted, it has been found in abundance, at\r\ncheap rates compared with what--of necessaries and comforts of life--could\r\nbe purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements of prosperity,\r\ntherefore, have not been denied us. A third might be added: Our soil and\r\nclimate are unequaled, within the limits of any contiguous territory under\r\none nationality, for its variety of products to feed and clothe a people\r\nand in the amount of surplus to spare to feed less favored peoples.\r\nTherefore, with these facts in view, it seems to me that wise\r\nstatesmanship, at this session of Congress, would dictate legislation\r\nignoring the past; directing in proper channels these great elements of\r\nprosperity to any people. Debt, debt abroad, is the only element that can,\r\nwith always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause any continued\r\ndepression in the industries and prosperity of our people.\r\n\r\nA great conflict for national existence made necessary, for temporary\r\npurposes, the raising of large sums of money from whatever source\r\nattainable. It made it necessary, in the wisdom of Congress--and I do not\r\ndoubt their wisdom in the premises, regarding the necessity of the\r\ntimes--to devise a system of national currency which it proved to be\r\nimpossible to keep on a par with the recognized currency of the civilized\r\nworld. This begot a spirit of speculation involving an extravagance and\r\nluxury not required for the happiness or prosperity of a people, and\r\ninvolving, both directly and indirectly, foreign indebtedness. The\r\ncurrency, being of fluctuating value, and therefore unsafe to hold for\r\nlegitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject of speculation\r\nwithin itself. These two causes, however, have involved us in a foreign\r\nindebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and lender, which should\r\nbe paid in coin, and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was\r\ncontracted--gold or its equivalent. The good faith of the Government can\r\nnot be violated toward creditors without national disgrace. But our\r\ncommerce should be encouraged; American shipbuilding and carrying capacity\r\nincreased; foreign markets sought for products of the soil and\r\nmanufactories, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a\r\nnew market can be created for the sale of our products, either of the soil,\r\nthe mine, or the manufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing our\r\nidle capital and labor to the advantage of the whole people. But, in my\r\njudgment, the first step toward accomplishing this object is to secure a\r\ncurrency of fixed, stable value; a currency good wherever civilization\r\nreigns; one which, if it becomes superabundant with one people, will find a\r\nmarket with some other; a currency which has as its basis the labor\r\nnecessary to produce it, which will give to it its value. Gold and silver\r\nare now the recognized medium of exchange the civilized world over, and to\r\nthis we should return with the least practicable delay. In view of the\r\npledges of the American Congress when our present legal-tender system was\r\nadopted, and debt contracted, there should be no delay--certainly no\r\nunnecessary delay--in fixing by legislation a method by which we will\r\nreturn to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your special\r\nattention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent\r\nrevival of business and industries until a policy is adopted--with\r\nlegislation to carry it out--looking to a return to a specie basis. It is\r\neasy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it of\r\nvalue to them to make so-called money abundant until they can throw a\r\nportion of their burdens upon others. But even these, I believe, would be\r\ndisappointed in the result if a course should be pursued which will keep in\r\ndoubt the value of the legal-tender medium of exchange. A revival of\r\nproductive industry is needed by all classes; by none more than the holders\r\nof property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from realization\r\nupon its sale. But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be\r\nbenefited by expansion, would it be honest to give it? Would not the\r\ngeneral loss be too great to justify such relief? Would it not be just as\r\nhonest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal-tenders\r\nto the extent of his liabilities? Than to do this, would it not be safer,\r\nfor fear of overissues by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debt\r\nobligations are obliterated in the United States, and now we commence anew,\r\neach possessing all he has at the time free from incumbrance? These\r\npropositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by thinking or\r\nhonest people. Yet every delay in preparation for final resumption partakes\r\nof this dishonesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out that\r\na convenient season will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming our\r\npledges to commence. It will never come, in my opinion, except by positive\r\naction by Congress, or by national disasters which will destroy, for a time\r\nat least, the credit of the individual and the State at large. A sound\r\ncurrency might be reached by total bankruptcy and discredit of the\r\nintegrity of the nation and of individuals. I believe it is in the power of\r\nCongress at this session to devise such legislation as will renew\r\nconfidence, revive all the industries, start us on a career of prosperity\r\nto last for many years and to save the credit of the nation and of the\r\npeople. Steps toward the return to a specie basis are the great requisites\r\nto this devoutly to be sought for end. There are others which I may touch\r\nupon hereafter.\r\n\r\nA nation dealing in a currency below that of specie in value labors under\r\ntwo great disadvantages: First, having no use for the world's acknowledged\r\nmedium of exchange, gold and silver, these are driven out of the country\r\nbecause there is no need for their use; second, the medium of exchange in\r\nuse being of a fluctuating value--for, after all, it is only worth just\r\nwhat it will purchase of gold and silver, metals having an intrinsic value\r\njust in proportion to the honest labor it takes to produce them--a larger\r\nmargin must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer and producer. It is\r\nmonths from the date of production to the date of realization. Interest\r\nupon capital must be charged, and risk of fluctuation in the value of that\r\nwhich is to be received in payment added. Hence high prices, acting as a\r\nprotection to the foreign producer, who receives nothing in exchange for\r\nthe products of his skill and labor except a currency good, at a stable\r\nvalue, the world over It seems to me that nothing is clearer than that the\r\ngreater part of the burden of existing prostration, for the want of a sound\r\nfinancial system, falls upon the working man, who must after all produce\r\nthe wealth, and the salaried man, who superintends and conducts business.\r\nThe burden falls upon them in two ways--by the deprivation of employment\r\nand by the decreased purchasing power of their salaries. It is the duty of\r\nCongress to devise the method of correcting the evils which are\r\nacknowledged to exist, and not mine. But I will venture to suggest two or\r\nthree things which seem to me as absolutely necessary to a return to specie\r\npayments, the first great requisite in a return to prosperity. The\r\nlegal-tender clause to the law authorizing the issue of currency by the\r\nNational Government should be repealed, to take effect as to all contracts\r\nentered into after a day fixed in the repealing act--not to apply, however,\r\nto payments of salaries by Government, or for other expenditures now\r\nprovided by law to be paid in currency, in the interval pending between\r\nrepeal and final resumption. Provision should be made by which the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may become necessary from\r\ntime to time from the date when specie redemption commences. To this might\r\nand should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenses to insure\r\nan accumulation of gold in the Treasury to sustain permanent redemption.\r\n\r\nI commend this subject to your careful consideration, believing that a\r\nfavorable solution is attainable, and if reached by this Congress that the\r\npresent and future generations will ever gratefully remember it as their\r\ndeliverer from a thraldom of evil and disgrace.\r\n\r\nWith resumption, free banking may be authorized with safety, giving the\r\nsame full protection to bill holders which they have under existing laws.\r\nIndeed, I would regard free banking as essential. It would give proper\r\nelasticity to the currency. As more currency should be required for the\r\ntransaction of legitimate business, new banks would be started, and in turn\r\nbanks would wind up their business when it was found that there was a\r\nsuperabundance of currency. The experience and judgment of the people can\r\nbest decide just how much currency is required for the transaction of the\r\nbusiness of the country. It is unsafe to leave the settlement of this\r\nquestion to Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Executive.\r\nCongress should make the regulation under which banks may exist, but should\r\nnot make banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of redeemable paper\r\ncurrency that shall be authorized. Such importance do I attach to this\r\nsubject, and so earnestly do I commend it to your attention, that I give it\r\nprominence by introducing it at the beginning of this message.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year nothing has occurred to disturb the general friendly\r\nand cordial relations of the United States with other powers.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence submitted herewith between this Government and its\r\ndiplomatic representatives, as also with the representatives of other\r\ncountries, shows a satisfactory condition of all questions between the\r\nUnited States and the most of those countries, and with few exceptions, to\r\nwhich reference is hereafter made, the absence of any points of difference\r\nto be adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe notice directed by the resolution of Congress of June 17, 1874, to be\r\ngiven to terminate the convention of July 17, 1858, between the United\r\nStates and Belgium has been given, and the treaty will accordingly\r\nterminate on the 1st day of July, 1875. This convention secured to certain\r\nBelgian vessels entering the ports of the United States exceptional\r\nprivileges which are not accorded to our own vessels. Other features of the\r\nconvention have proved satisfactory, and have tended to the cultivation of\r\nmutually beneficial commercial intercourse and friendly relations between\r\nthe two countries. I hope that negotiations which have been invited will\r\nresult in the celebration of another treaty which may tend to the interests\r\nof both countries.\r\n\r\nOur relations with China continue to be friendly. During the past year the\r\nfear of hostilities between China and Japan, growing out of the landing of\r\nan armed force upon the island of Formosa by the latter, has occasioned\r\nuneasiness. It is earnestly hoped, however, that the difficulties arising\r\nfrom this cause will be adjusted, and that the advance of civilization in\r\nthese Empires may not be retarded by a state of war. In consequence of the\r\npart taken by certain citizens of the United States in this expedition, our\r\nrepresentatives in those countries have been instructed to impress upon the\r\nGovernments of China and Japan the firm intention of this country to\r\nmaintain strict neutrality in the event of hostilities, and to carefully\r\nprevent any infraction of law on the part of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I call the attention of Congress to a\r\ngenerally conceded fact--that the great proportion of the Chinese\r\nimmigrants who come to our shores do not come voluntarily, to make their\r\nhomes with us and their labor productive of general prosperity, but come\r\nunder contracts with headmen, who own them almost absolutely. In a worse\r\nform does this apply to Chinese women. Hardly a perceptible percentage of\r\nthem perform any honorable labor, but they are brought for shameful\r\npurposes, to the disgrace of the communities where settled and to the great\r\ndemoralization of the youth of those localities. If this evil practice can\r\nbe legislated against, it will be my pleasure as well as duty to enforce\r\nany regulation to secure so desirable an end.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that negotiations between the Government of Japan and the\r\ntreaty powers, looking to the further opening of the Empire and to the\r\nremoval of various restrictions upon trade and travel, may soon produce the\r\nresults desired, which can not fail to inure to the benefit of all the\r\nparties. Having on previous occasions submitted to the consideration of\r\nCongress the propriety of the release of the Japanese Government from the\r\nfurther payment of the indemnity under the convention of October 22, 1864,\r\nand as no action had been taken thereon, it became my duty to regard the\r\nobligations of the convention as in force; and as the other powers\r\ninterested had received their portion of the indemnity in full, the\r\nminister of the United States in Japan has, in behalf of this Government,\r\nreceived the remainder of the amount due to the United States under the\r\nconvention of Simonosaki. I submit the propriety of applying the income of\r\na part, if not of the whole, of this fund to the education in the Japanese\r\nlanguage of a number of young men to be under obligations to serve the\r\nGovernment for a specified time as interpreters at the legation and the\r\nconsulates in Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths might at the same\r\ntime be educated in our own vernacular, and mutual benefits would result to\r\nboth Governments. The importance of having our own citizens, competent and\r\nfamiliar with the language of Japan, to act as interpreters and in other\r\ncapacities connected with the legation and the consulates in that country\r\ncan not readily be overestimated.\r\n\r\nThe amount awarded to the Government of Great Britain by the mixed\r\ncommission organized under the provisions of the treaty of Washington in\r\nsettlement of the claims of British subjects arising from acts committed\r\nbetween April 13, 1861, and April 9, 1865, became payable, under the terms\r\nof the treaty, within the past year, and was paid upon the 21st day of\r\nSeptember, 1874. In this connection I renew my recommendation, made at the\r\nopening of the last session of Congress, that a special court be created to\r\nhear and determine all claims of aliens against the United States arising\r\nfrom acts committed against their persons or property during the\r\ninsurrection. It appears equitable that opportunity should be offered to\r\ncitizens of other states to present their claims, as well as to those\r\nBritish subjects whose claims were not admissible under the late\r\ncommission, to the early decision of some competent tribunal. To this end I\r\nrecommend the necessary legislation to organize a court to dispose of all\r\nclaims of aliens of the nature referred to in an equitable and satisfactory\r\nmanner, and to relieve Congress and the Departments from the consideration\r\nof these questions.\r\n\r\nThe legislation necessary to extend to the colony of Newfoundland certain\r\narticles of the treaty of Washington of the 8th day of May, 1871, having\r\nbeen had, a protocol to that effect was signed in behalf of the United\r\nStates and of Great Britain on the 28th day of May last, and was duly\r\nproclaimed on the following day. A copy of the proclamation is submitted\r\nherewith.\r\n\r\nA copy of the report of the commissioner appointed under the act of March\r\n19, 1872, for surveying and marking the boundary between the United States\r\nand the British possessions from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the\r\nRocky Mountains is herewith transmitted. I am happy to announce that the\r\nfield work of the commission has been completed, and the entire line from\r\nthe northwest corner of the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky\r\nMountains has been run and marked upon the surface of the earth. It is\r\nbelieved that the amount remaining unexpended of the appropriation made at\r\nthe last session of Congress will be sufficient to complete the office\r\nwork. I recommend that the authority of Congress be given to the use of the\r\nunexpended balance of the appropriation in the completion of the work of\r\nthe commission in making its report and preparing the necessary maps.\r\n\r\nThe court known as the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, created by\r\nan act of Congress of the last session, has organized and commenced its\r\nwork, and it is to be hoped that the claims admissible under the provisions\r\nof the act may be speedily ascertained and paid.\r\n\r\nIt has been deemed advisable to exercise the discretion conferred upon the\r\nExecutive at the last session by accepting the conditions required by the\r\nGovernment of Turkey for the privilege of allowing citizens of the United\r\nStates to hold real estate in the former country, and by assenting to a\r\ncertain change in the jurisdiction of courts in the latter. A copy of the\r\nproclamation upon these subjects is herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nThere has been no material change in our relations with the independent\r\nStates of this hemisphere which were formerly under the dominion of Spain.\r\nMarauding on the frontiers between Mexico and Texas still frequently takes\r\nplace, despite the vigilance of the civil and military authorities in that\r\nquarter. The difficulty of checking such trespasses along the course of a\r\nriver of such length as the Rio Grande, and so often fordable, is obvious.\r\nIt is hoped that the efforts of this Government will be seconded by those\r\nof Mexico to the effectual suppression of these acts of wrong.\r\n\r\nFrom a report upon the condition of the business before the American and\r\nMexican Joint Claims Commission, made by the agent on the part of the\r\nUnited States, and dated October 28, 1874, it appears that of the 1,017\r\nclaims filed on the part of citizens of the United States, 483 had been\r\nfinally decided and 75 were in the hands of the umpire, leaving 462 to be\r\ndisposed of; and of the 998 claims filed against the United States, 726 had\r\nbeen finally decided, I was before the umpire, and 271 remained to be\r\ndisposed of. Since the date of such report other claims have been disposed\r\nof, reducing somewhat the number still pending; and others have been passed\r\nupon by the arbitrators. It has become apparent, in view of these figures\r\nand of the fact that the work devolving on the umpire is particularly\r\nlaborious, that the commission will be unable to dispose of the entire\r\nnumber of claims pending prior to the 1st day of February, 1875--the date\r\nfixed for its expiration. Negotiations are pending looking to the securing\r\nof the results of the decisions which have been reached and to a further\r\nextension of the commission for a limited time, which it is confidently\r\nhoped will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a final\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe strife in the Argentine Republic is to be deplored, both on account of\r\nthe parties thereto and from the probable effects on the interests of those\r\nengaged in the trade to that quarter, of whom the United States are among\r\nthe principal. As yet, so far as I am aware, there has been no violation of\r\nour neutrality rights, which, as well as our duties in that respect, it\r\nshall be my endeavor to maintain and observe.\r\n\r\nIt is with regret I announce that no further payment has been received from\r\nthe Government of Venezuela on account of awards in favor of citizens of\r\nthe United States. Hopes have been entertained that if that Republic could\r\nescape both foreign and civil war for a few years its great natural\r\nresources would enable it to honor its obligations. Though it is now\r\nunderstood to be at peace with other countries, a serious insurrection is\r\nreported to be in progress in an important region of that Republic. This\r\nmay be taken advantage of as another reason to delay the payment of the\r\ndues of our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable strife in Cuba continues without any marked change in the\r\nrelative advantages of the contending forces. The insurrection continues,\r\nbut Spain has gained no superiority. Six years of strife give to the\r\ninsurrection a significance which can not be denied. Its duration and the\r\ntenacity of its adherence, together with the absence of manifested power of\r\nsuppression on the part of Spain, can not be controverted, and may make\r\nsome positive steps on the part of other powers a matter of self-necessity.\r\nI had confidently hoped at this time to be able to announce the arrangement\r\nof some of the important questions between this Government and that of\r\nSpain, but the negotiations have been protracted. The unhappy intestine\r\ndissensions of Spain command our profound sympathy, and must be accepted as\r\nperhaps a cause of some delay. An early settlement, in part at least, of\r\nthe questions between the Governments is hoped. In the meantime, awaiting\r\nthe results of immediately pending negotiations, I defer a further and\r\nfuller communication on the subject of the relations of this country and\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nI have again to call the attention of Congress to the unsatisfactory\r\ncondition of the existing laws with reference to expatriation and the\r\nelection of nationality. Formerly, amid conflicting opinions and decisions,\r\nit was difficult to exactly determine how far the doctrine of perpetual\r\nallegiance was applicable to citizens of the United States. Congress by the\r\nact of the 27th of July, 1868, asserted the abstract right of expatriation\r\nas a fundamental principle of this Government. Notwithstanding such\r\nassertion and the necessity of frequent application of the principle, no\r\nlegislation has been had defining what acts or formalities shall work\r\nexpatriation or when a citizen shall be deemed to have renounced or to have\r\nlost his citizenship. The importance of such definition is obvious. The\r\nrepresentatives of the United States in foreign countries are continually\r\ncalled upon to lend their aid and the protection of the United States to\r\npersons concerning the good faith or the reality of whose citizenship there\r\nis at least great question. In some cases the provisions of the treaties\r\nfurnish some guide; in others it seems left to the person claiming the\r\nbenefits of citizenship, while living in a foreign country, contributing in\r\nno manner to the performance of the duties of a citizen of the United\r\nStates, and without intention at any time to return and undertake those\r\nduties, to use the claims to citizenship of the United States simply as a\r\nshield from the performance of the obligations of a citizen elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe status of children born of American parents residing in a foreign\r\ncountry, of American women who have married aliens, of American citizens\r\nresiding abroad where such question is not regulated by treaty, are all\r\nsources of frequent difficulty and discussion. Legislation on these and\r\nsimilar questions, and particularly defining when and under what\r\ncircumstances expatriation can be accomplished or is to be presumed, is\r\nespecially needed. In this connection I earnestly call the attention of\r\nCongress to the difficulties arising from fraudulent naturalization. The\r\nUnited States wisely, freely, and liberally offers its citizenship to all\r\nwho may come in good faith to reside within its limits on their complying\r\nwith certain prescribed reasonable and simple formalities and conditions.\r\nAmong the highest duties of the Government is that to afford firm,\r\nsufficient, and equal protection to all its citizens, whether native born\r\nor naturalized. Care should be taken that a right carrying with it such\r\nsupport from the Government should not be fraudulently obtained, and should\r\nbe bestowed only upon full proof of a compliance with the law; and yet\r\nfrequent instances are brought to the attention of the Government of\r\nillegal and fraudulent naturalization and of the unauthorized use of\r\ncertificates thus improperly obtained. In some cases the fraudulent\r\ncharacter of the naturalization has appeared upon the face of the\r\ncertificate itself; in others examination discloses that the holder had not\r\ncomplied with the law, and in others certificates have been obtained where\r\nthe persons holding them not only were not entitled to be naturalized, but\r\nhad not even been within the United States at the time of the pretended\r\nnaturalization. Instances of each of these classes of fraud are discovered\r\nat our legations, where the certificates of naturalization are presented\r\neither for the purpose of obtaining passports or in demanding the\r\nprotection of the legation. When the fraud is apparent on the face of such\r\ncertificates, they are taken up by the representatives of the Government\r\nand forwarded to the Department of State. But even then the record of the\r\ncourt in which the fraudulent naturalization occurred remains, and\r\nduplicate certificates are readily obtainable. Upon the presentation of\r\nthese for the issue of passports or in demanding protection of the\r\nGovernment, the fraud sometimes escapes notice, and such certificates are\r\nnot infrequently used in transactions of business to the deception and\r\ninjury of innocent parties. Without placing any additional obstacles in the\r\nway of the obtainment of citizenship by the worthy and well-intentioned\r\nforeigner who comes in good faith to cast his lot with ours, I earnestly\r\nrecommend further legislation to punish fraudulent naturalization and to\r\nsecure the ready cancellation of the record of every naturalization made in\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratification\r\nof treaties of extradition with Belgium, Ecuador, Peru, and Salvador; also\r\nof a treaty of commerce and navigation with Peru, and one of commerce and\r\nconsular privileges with Salvador; all of which have been duly proclaimed,\r\nas has also a declaration with Russia with reference to trade-marks.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made directly\r\nto Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the receipts and\r\nexpenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year, the amount\r\nreceived from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out for each of\r\nthe Departments of Government. It will be observed from this report that\r\nthe amount of receipts over expenditures has been but $2,344,882.30 for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that for the current fiscal year the\r\nestimated receipts over expenditures will not much exceed $9,000,000. In\r\nview of the large national debt existing and the obligation to add 1 per\r\ncent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to over $34,000,000\r\nper annum, I submit whether revenues should not be increased or\r\nexpenditures diminished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide for\r\nthe sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts and\r\nobligations of the Government. At the last session of Congress a very\r\nconsiderable reduction was made in rates of taxation and in the number of\r\narticles submitted to taxation; the question may well be asked, whether or\r\nnot, in some instances, unwisely. In connection with this subject, too, I\r\nventure the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especially\r\nfrom imports, have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make it\r\nquestionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to\r\ncollect, to the direct loss of the Treasury and to the prejudice of the\r\ninterests of honest importers and taxpayers.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury in his report favors legislation looking to\r\nan early return to specie payments, thus supporting views previously\r\nexpressed in this message. He also recommends economy in appropriations;\r\ncalls attention to the loss of revenue from repealing the tax on tea and\r\ncoffee, without benefit to the consumer; recommends an increase of 10 cents\r\na gallon on whisky, and, further, that no modification be made in the\r\nbanking and currency bill passed at the last session of Congress, unless\r\nmodification should become necessary by reason of the adoption of measures\r\nfor returning to specie payments. In these recommendations I cordially\r\njoin.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to Congress the propriety of readjusting the tariff so as\r\nto increase the revenue, and at the same time decrease the number of\r\narticles upon which duties are levied. Those articles which enter into our\r\nmanufactures and are not produced at home, it seems to me, should be\r\nentered free. Those articles of manufacture which we produce a constituent\r\npart of, but do not produce the whole, that part which we do not produce\r\nshould enter free also. I will instance fine wool, dyes, etc. These\r\narticles must be imported to form a part of the manufacture of the higher\r\ngrades of woolen goods. Chemicals used as dyes, compounded in medicines,\r\nand used in various ways in manufactures come under this class. The\r\nintroduction free of duty of such wools as we do not produce would\r\nstimulate the manufacture of goods requiring the use of those we do\r\nproduce, and therefore would be a benefit to home production. There are\r\nmany articles entering into \"home manufactures\" which we do not produce\r\nourselves the tariff upon which increases the cost of producing the\r\nmanufactured article. All corrections in this regard are in the direction\r\nof bringing labor and capital in harmony with each other and of supplying\r\none of the elements of prosperity so much needed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War herewith attached, and forming a part of\r\nthis message, gives all the information concerning the operations, wants,\r\nand necessities of the Army, and contains many suggestions and\r\nrecommendations which I commend to your special attention.\r\n\r\nThere is no class of Government employees who are harder worked than the\r\nArmy--officers and men; none who perform their tasks more cheerfully and\r\nefficiently and under circumstances of greater privations and hardships.\r\n\r\nLegislation is desirable to render more efficient this branch of the public\r\nservice. All the recommendations of the Secretary of War I regard as\r\njudicious, and I especially commend to your attention the following: The\r\nconsolidation of Government arsenals; the restoration of mileage to\r\nofficers traveling under orders; the exemption of money received from the\r\nsale of subsistence stores from being covered into the Treasury; the use of\r\nappropriations for the purchase of subsistence stores without waiting for\r\nthe beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made; for\r\nadditional appropriations for the collection of torpedo material; for\r\nincreased appropriations for the manufacture of arms; for relieving the\r\nvarious States from indebtedness for arms charged to them during the\r\nrebellion; for dropping officers from the rolls of the Army without trial\r\nfor the offense of drawing pay more than once for the same period; for the\r\ndiscouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by cheek, and for the\r\nestablishment of a professorship of rhetoric and English literature at West\r\nPoint. The reasons for these recommendations are obvious, and are set forth\r\nsufficiently in the reports attached. I also recommend that the status of\r\nthe staff corps of the Army be fixed, where this has not already been done,\r\nso that promotions may be made and vacancies filled as they occur in each\r\ngrade when reduced below the number to be fixed by law. The necessity for\r\nsuch legislation is specially felt now in the Pay Department. The number of\r\nofficers in that department is below the number adequate to the performance\r\nof the duties required of them by law.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the Navy has been largely increased during the last year.\r\nUnder the impulse of the foreign complications which threatened us at the\r\ncommencement of the last session of Congress, most of our efficient wooden\r\nships were put in condition for immediate service, and the repairs of our\r\nironclad fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor. The result is that most\r\nof these are now in an effective state and need only to be manned and put\r\nin commission to go at once into service.\r\n\r\nSome of the new sloops authorized by Congress are already in commission,\r\nand most of the remainder are launched and wait only the completion of\r\ntheir machinery to enable them to take their places as part of our\r\neffective force.\r\n\r\nTwo iron torpedo ships have been completed during the last year, and four\r\nof our large double-turreted ironclads are now undergoing repairs. When\r\nthese are finished, everything that is useful of our Navy, as now\r\nauthorized, will be in condition for service, and with the advance in the\r\nscience of torpedo warfare the American Navy, comparatively small as it is,\r\nwill be found at any time powerful for the purposes of a peaceful nation.\r\n\r\nMuch has been accomplished during the year in aid of science and to\r\nincrease the sum of general knowledge and further the interests of commerce\r\nand civilization. Extensive and much-needed soundings have been made for\r\nhydrographic purposes and to fix the proper routes of ocean telegraphs.\r\nFurther surveys of the great Isthmus have been undertaken and completed,\r\nand two vessels of the Navy are now employed, in conjunction with those of\r\nEngland, France, Germany, and Russia, in observations connected with the\r\ntransit of Venus, so useful and interesting to the scientific world.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for this branch of the public service do not differ\r\nmaterially from those of last year, those for the general support of the\r\nservice being somewhat less and those for permanent improvements at the\r\nvarious stations rather larger than the corresponding estimate made a year\r\nago. The regular maintenance and a steady increase in the efficiency of\r\nthis most important arm in proportion to the growth of our maritime\r\nintercourse and interests is recommended to the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Navy in time of peace might be further utilized by a direct\r\nauthorization of the employment of naval vessels in explorations and\r\nsurveys of the supposed navigable waters of other nationalities on this\r\ncontinent, especially the tributaries of the two great rivers of South\r\nAmerica, the Orinoco and the Amazon. Nothing prevents, under existing laws,\r\nsuch exploration, except that expenditures must be made in such expeditions\r\nbeyond those usually provided for in the appropriations. The field\r\ndesignated is unquestionably one of interest and one capable of large\r\ndevelopment of commercial interests--advantageous to the peoples reached\r\nand to those who may establish relations with them.\r\n\r\nEducation of the people entitled to exercise the right of franchise I\r\nregard essential to general prosperity everywhere, and especially so in\r\nrepublics, where birth, education, or previous condition does not enter\r\ninto account in giving suffrage. Next to the public school, the post-office\r\nis the great agent of education over our vast territory. The rapidity with\r\nwhich new sections are being settled, thus increasing the carrying of mails\r\nin a more rapid ratio than the increase of receipts, is not alarming. The\r\nreport of the Postmaster-General herewith attached shows that there was an\r\nincrease of revenue in his Department in 1873 over the previous year of\r\n$1,674,411, and an increase of cost of carrying the mails and paying\r\nemployees of $3,041,468.91. The report of the Postmaster-General gives\r\ninteresting statistics of his Department, and compares them with the\r\ncorresponding statistics of a year ago, showing a growth in every branch of\r\nthe Department.\r\n\r\nA postal convention has been concluded with New South Wales, an exchange of\r\npostal cards established with Switzerland, and the negotiations pending for\r\nseveral years past with France have been terminated in a convention with\r\nthat country, which went into effect last August.\r\n\r\nAn international postal congress was convened in Berne, Switzerland, in\r\nSeptember last, at which the United States was represented by an officer of\r\nthe Post-Office Department of much experience and of qualification for the\r\nposition. A convention for the establishment of an international postal\r\nunion was agreed upon and signed by the delegates of the countries\r\nrepresented, subject to the approval of the proper authorities of those\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nI respectfully direct your attention to the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General and to his suggestions in regard to an equitable\r\nadjustment of the question of compensation to railroads for carrying the\r\nmails.\r\n\r\nYour attention will be drawn to the unsettled condition of affairs in some\r\nof the Southern States.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September last the governor of Louisiana called upon me, as\r\nprovided by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to aid in\r\nsuppressing domestic violence in that State. This call was made in view of\r\na proclamation issued on that day by D. B. Penn, claiming that he was\r\nelected lieutenant-governor in 1872, and calling upon the militia of the\r\nState to arm, assemble, and drive from power the usurpers, as he designated\r\nthe officers of the State government. On the next day I issued my\r\nproclamation commanding the insurgents to disperse within five days from\r\nthe date thereof, and subsequently learned that on that day they had taken\r\nforcible possession of the statehouse. Steps were taken by me to support\r\nthe existing and recognized State government, but before the expiration of\r\nthe five days the insurrectionary movement was practically abandoned, and\r\nthe officers of the State government, with some minor exceptions, resumed\r\ntheir powers and duties. Considering that the present State administration\r\nof Louisiana has been the only government in that State for nearly two\r\nyears; that it has been tacitly acknowledged and acquiesced in as such by\r\nCongress, and more than once expressly recognized by me, I regarded it as\r\nmy clear duty, when legally called upon for that purpose, to prevent its\r\noverthrow by an armed mob under pretense of fraud and irregularity in the\r\nelection of 1872. I have heretofore called the attention of Congress to\r\nthis subject, stating that on account of the frauds and forgeries committed\r\nat said election, and because it appears that the returns thereof were\r\nnever legally canvassed, it was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen;\r\nbut from the best sources of information at my command I have always\r\nbelieved that the present State officers received a majority of the legal\r\nvotes actually cast at that election. I repeat what I said in my special\r\nmessage of February 23, 1873, that in the event of no action by Congress I\r\nmust continue to recognize the government heretofore recognized by me.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that with preparations for the late election decided\r\nindications appeared in some localities in the Southern States of a\r\ndetermination, by acts of violence and intimidation, to deprive citizens of\r\nthe freedom of the ballot because of their political opinions. Bands of\r\nmen, masked and armed, made their appearance; White Leagues and other\r\nsocieties were formed; large quantities of arms and ammunition were\r\nimported and distributed to these organizations; military drills, with\r\nmenacing demonstrations, were held, and with all these murders enough were\r\ncommitted to spread terror among those whose political action was to be\r\nsuppressed, if possible, by these intolerant and criminal proceedings. In\r\nsome places colored laborers were compelled to vote according to the wishes\r\nof their employers, under threats of discharge if they acted otherwise; and\r\nthere are too many instances in which, when these threats were disregarded,\r\nthey were remorselessly executed by those who made them. I understand that\r\nthe fifteenth amendment to the Constitution was made to prevent this and a\r\nlike state of things, and the act of May 31, 1870, with amendments, was\r\npassed to enforce its provisions, the object of both being to guarantee to\r\nall citizens the right to vote and to protect them in the free enjoyment of\r\nthat right. Enjoined by the Constitution \"to take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed,\" and convinced by undoubted evidence that violations\r\nof said act had been committed and that a widespread and flagrant disregard\r\nof it was contemplated, the proper officers were instructed to prosecute\r\nthe offenders, and troops were stationed at convenient points to aid these\r\nofficers, if necessary, in the performance of their official duties.\r\nComplaints are made of this interference by Federal authority; but if said\r\namendment and act do not provide for such interference under the\r\ncircumstances as above stated, then they are without meaning, force, or\r\neffect, and the whole scheme of colored enfranchisement is worse than\r\nmockery and little better than a crime. Possibly Congress may find it due\r\nto truth and justice to ascertain, by means of a committee, whether the\r\nalleged wrongs to colored citizens for political purposes are real or the\r\nreports thereof were manufactured for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of troops in the States of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia,\r\nFlorida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas,\r\nMississippi, Maryland, and Virginia at the time of the election was 4,082.\r\nThis embraces the garrisons of all the forts from the Delaware to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nAnother trouble has arisen in Arkansas. Article 13 of the constitution of\r\nthat State (which was adopted in 1868, and upon the approval of which by\r\nCongress the State was restored to representation as one of the States of\r\nthe Union) provides in effect that before any amendments proposed to this\r\nconstitution shall become a part thereof they shall be passed by two\r\nsuccessive assemblies and then submitted to and ratified by a majority of\r\nthe electors of the State voting thereon. On the 11th of May, 1874, the\r\ngovernor convened an extra session of the general assembly of the State,\r\nwhich on the 18th of the same month passed an act providing for a\r\nconvention to frame a new constitution. Pursuant to this act, and at an\r\nelection held on the 30th of June, 1874, the convention was approved, and\r\ndelegates were chosen thereto, who assembled on the 14th of last July and\r\nframed a new constitution, the schedule of which provided for the election\r\nof an entire new set of State officers in a manner contrary to the then\r\nexisting election laws of the State. On the 13th of October, 1874, this\r\nconstitution, as therein provided, was submitted to the people for their\r\napproval or rejection, and according to the election returns was approved\r\nby a large majority of those qualified to vote thereon; and at the same\r\nelection persons were chosen to fill all the State, county, and township\r\noffices. The governor elected in 1872 for the term of four years turned\r\nover his office to the governor chosen under the new constitution,\r\nwhereupon the lieutenant-governor, also elected in 1872 for a term of four\r\nyears, claiming to act as governor, and alleging that said proceedings by\r\nwhich the new constitution was made and a new set of officers elected were\r\nunconstitutional, illegal, and void, called upon me, as provided in section\r\n4, Article IV, of the Constitution, to protect the State against domestic\r\nviolence. As Congress is now investigating the political affairs of\r\nArkansas, I have declined to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of Executive interference with the affairs of a State is\r\nrepugnant to public opinion, to the feelings of those who, from their\r\nofficial capacity, must be used in such interposition, and to him or those\r\nwho must direct. Unless most clearly on the side of law, such interference\r\nbecomes a crime; with the law to support it, it is condemned without a\r\nheating. I desire, therefore, that all necessity for Executive direction in\r\nlocal affairs may become unnecessary and obsolete. I invite the attention,\r\nnot of Congress, but of the people of the United States, to the causes and\r\neffects of these unhappy questions. Is there not a disposition on one side\r\nto magnify wrongs and outrages, and on the other side to belittle them or\r\njustify them? If public opinion could be directed to a correct survey of\r\nwhat is and to rebuking wrong and aiding the proper authorities in\r\npunishing it, a better state of feeling would be inculcated, and the sooner\r\nwe would have that peace which would leave the States free indeed to\r\nregulate their own domestic affairs. I believe on the part of our citizens\r\nof the Southern States--the better part of them--there is a disposition to\r\nbe law abiding, and to do no violence either to individuals or to the laws\r\nexisting. But do they do right in ignoring the existence of violence and\r\nbloodshed in resistance to constituted authority? I sympathize with their\r\nprostrate condition, and would do all in my power to relieve them,\r\nacknowledging that in some instances they have had most trying governments\r\nto live under, and very oppressive ones in the way of taxation for nominal\r\nimprovements, not giving benefits equal to the hardships imposed. But can\r\nthey proclaim themselves entirely irresponsible for this condition? They\r\ncan not. Violence has been rampant in some localities, and has either been\r\njustified or denied by those who could have prevented it. The theory is\r\neven raised that there is to be no further interference on the part of the\r\nGeneral Government to protect citizens within a State where the State\r\nauthorities fail to give protection. This is a great mistake. While I\r\nremain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the\r\nConstitution, including the recent amendments added thereto, will be\r\nenforced with rigor, but with regret that they should have added one jot or\r\ntittle to Executive duties or powers. Let there be fairness in the\r\ndiscussion of Southern questions, the advocates of both or all political\r\nparties giving honest, truthful reports of occurrences, condemning the\r\nwrong and upholding the tight, and soon all will be well. Under existing\r\nconditions the negro votes the Republican ticket because he knows his\r\nfriends are of that party. Many a good citizen votes the opposite, not\r\nbecause he agrees with the great principles of state which separate\r\nparties, but because, generally, he is opposed to negro rule. This is a\r\nmost delusive cry. Treat the negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is and\r\nmust remain, and soon parties will be divided, not on the color line, but\r\non principle. Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General contains valuable recommendations\r\nrelating to the administration of justice in the courts of the United\r\nStates, to which I invite your attention.\r\n\r\nI respectfully suggest to Congress the propriety of increasing the number\r\nof judicial districts in the United States to eleven (the present number\r\nbeing nine) and the creation of two additional judgeships. The territory to\r\nbe traversed by the circuit judges is so great and the business of the\r\ncourts so steadily increasing that it is growing more and more impossible\r\nfor them to keep up with the business requiring their attention. Whether\r\nthis would involve the necessity of adding two more justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt to the present number I submit to the judgment of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is invited to the report of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior and to the legislation asked for by him. The domestic interests of\r\nthe people are more intimately connected with this Department than with\r\neither of the other Departments of Government. Its duties have been added\r\nto from time to time until they have become so onerous that without the\r\nmost perfect system and order it will be impossible for any Secretary of\r\nthe Interior to keep trace of all official transactions having his sanction\r\nand done in his name, and for which he is held personally responsible.\r\n\r\nThe policy adopted for the management of Indian affairs, known as the peace\r\npolicy, has been adhered to with most beneficial results. It is confidently\r\nhoped that a few years more will relieve our frontiers from danger of\r\nIndian depredations.\r\n\r\nI commend the recommendation of the Secretary for the extension of the\r\nhomestead laws to the Indians and for some sort of Territorial government\r\nfor the Indian Territory. A great majority of the Indians occupying this\r\nTerritory are believed yet to be incapable of maintaining their rights\r\nagainst the more civilized and enlightened white man. Any Territorial form\r\nof government given them, therefore, should protect them in their homes and\r\nproperty for a period of at least twenty years, and before its final\r\nadoption should be ratified by a majority of those affected.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior herewith attached gives much\r\ninteresting statistical information, which I abstain from giving an\r\nabstract of, but refer you to the report itself.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress providing the oath which pensioners must subscribe to\r\nbefore drawing their pensions cuts off from this bounty a few survivors of\r\nthe War of 1812 residing in the Southern States. I recommend the\r\nrestoration of this bounty to all such. The number of persons whose names\r\nwould thus be restored to the list of pensioners is not large. They are all\r\nold persons, who could have taken no part in the rebellion, and the\r\nservices for which they were awarded pensions were in defense of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture herewith contains suggestions\r\nof much interest to the general public, and refers to the sly approaching\r\nCentennial and the part his Department is ready to take in it. I feel that\r\nthe nation at large is interested in having this exposition a success, and\r\ncommend to Congress such action as will secure a greater general interest\r\nin it. Already many foreign nations have signified their intention to be\r\nrepresented at it, and it may be expected that every civilized nation will\r\nbe represented.\r\n\r\nThe rules adopted to improve the civil service of the Government have been\r\nadhered to as closely as has been practicable with the opposition with\r\nwhich they meet. The effect, I believe, has been beneficial on the whole,\r\nand has tended to the elevation of the service. But it is impracticable to\r\nmaintain them without direct and positive support of Congress. Generally\r\nthe support which this reform receives is from those who give it their\r\nsupport only to find fault when the rules are apparently departed from.\r\nRemovals from office without preferring charges against parties removed are\r\nfrequently cited as departures from the rules adopted, and the retention of\r\nthose against whom charges are made by irresponsible persons and without\r\ngood grounds is also often condemned as a violation of them. Under these\r\ncircumstances, therefore, I announce that if Congress adjourns without\r\npositive legislation on the subject of \"civil-service reform\" I will regard\r\nsuch action as a disapproval of the system, and will abandon it, except so\r\nfar as to require examinations for certain appointees, to determine their\r\nfitness. Competitive examinations will be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who have given their services, without compensation, as\r\nmembers of the board to devise rules and regulations for the government of\r\nthe civil service of the country have shown much zeal and earnestness in\r\ntheir work, and to them, as well as to myself, it will be a source of\r\nmortification if it is to be thrown away. But I repeat that it is\r\nimpossible to carry this system to a successful issue without general\r\napproval and assistance and positive law to support it.\r\n\r\nI have stated that three elements of prosperity to the nation--capital,\r\nlabor, skilled and unskilled, and products of the soil--still remain with\r\nus. To direct the employment of these is a problem deserving the most\r\nserious attention of Congress. If employment can be given to all the labor\r\noffering itself, prosperity necessarily follows. I have expressed the\r\nopinion, and repeat it, that the first requisite to the accomplishment of\r\nthis end is the substitution of a sound currency in place of one of a\r\nfluctuating value. This secured, there are many interests that might be\r\nfostered to the great profit of both labor and capital. How to induce\r\ncapital to employ labor is the question. The subject of cheap\r\ntransportation has occupied the attention of Congress. Much new light on\r\nthis question will without doubt be given by the committee appointed by the\r\nlast Congress to investigate and report upon this subject.\r\n\r\nA revival of shipbuilding, and particularly of iron steamship building, is\r\nof vast importance to our national prosperity. The United States is now\r\npaying over $100,000,000 per annum for freights and passage on foreign\r\nships--to be carried abroad and expended in the employment and support of\r\nother peoples--beyond a fair percentage of what should go to foreign\r\nvessels, estimating on the tonnage and travel of each respectively. It is\r\nto be regretted that this disparity in the carrying trade exists, and to\r\ncorrect it I would be willing to see a great departure from the usual\r\ncourse of Government in supporting what might usually be termed private\r\nenterprise. I would not suggest as a remedy direct subsidy to American\r\nsteamship lines, but I would suggest the direct offer of ample compensation\r\nfor carrying the mails between Atlantic Seaboard cities and the Continent\r\non American-owned and American-built steamers, and would extend this\r\nliberality to vessels carrying the mails to South American States and to\r\nCentral America and Mexico, and would pursue the same policy from our\r\nPacific seaports to foreign seaports on the Pacific. It might be demanded\r\nthat vessels built for this service should come up to a standard fixed by\r\nlegislation in tonnage, speed, and all other qualities, looking to the\r\npossibility of Government requiring them at some time for war purposes. The\r\nright also of taking possession of them in such emergency should be\r\nguarded.\r\n\r\nI offer these suggestions, believing them worthy of consideration, in all\r\nseriousness, affecting all sections and all interests alike. If anything\r\nbetter can be done to direct the country into a course of general\r\nprosperity, no one will be more ready than I to second the plan.\r\n\r\nForwarded herewith will be found the report of the commissioners appointed\r\nunder an act of Congress approved June 20, 1874, to wind up the affairs of\r\nthe District government. It will be seen from the report that the net debt\r\nof the District of Columbia, less securities on hand and available, is:\r\n\r\nBonded debt issued prior to July 1, 1874 - - $8,883,940.93\r\n\r\n3.65 bonds, act of Congress June 20, 1874 - - 2,088,168.73\r\n\r\nCertificates of the board of audit - - 4,770,558.45\r\n\r\n- -\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\nDecember 7, 1875\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn submitting my seventh annual message to Congress, in this centennial\r\nyear of our national existence as a free and independent people, it affords\r\nme great pleasure to recur to the advancement that has been made from the\r\ntime of the colonies, one hundred years ago. We were then a people\r\nnumbering only 3,000,000. Now we number more than 40,000,000. Then\r\nindustries were confined almost exclusively to the tillage of the soil. Now\r\nmanufactories absorb much of the labor of the country.\r\n\r\nOur liberties remain unimpaired; the bondmen have been freed from slavery;\r\nwe have become possessed of the respect, if not the friendship, of all\r\ncivilized nations. Our progress has been great in all the arts--in science,\r\nagriculture, commerce, navigation, mining, mechanics, law, medicine, etc.;\r\nand in general education the progress is likewise encouraging. Our thirteen\r\nStates have become thirty-eight, including Colorado (which has taken the\r\ninitiatory steps to become a State), and eight Territories, including the\r\nIndian Territory and Alaska, and excluding Colorado, making a territory\r\nextending from the Atlantic to the Pacific. On the south we have extended\r\nto the Gulf of Mexico, and in the west from the Mississippi to the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago the cotton gin, the steamship, the railroad, the\r\ntelegraph, the reaping, sewing, and modern printing machines, and numerous\r\nother inventions of scarcely less value to our business and happiness were\r\nentirely unknown.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 manufactories scarcely existed even in name in all this vast\r\nterritory. In 1870 more than 2,000,000 persons were employed in\r\nmanufactories, producing more than $2,100,000,000 of products in amount\r\nannually, nearly equal to our national debt. From nearly the whole of the\r\npopulation of 1776 being engaged in the one occupation of agriculture, in\r\n1870 so numerous and diversified had become the occupation of our people\r\nthat less than 6,000,000 out of more than 40,000,000 were so engaged. The\r\nextraordinary effect produced in our country by a resort to diversified\r\noccupations has built a market for the products of fertile lands distant\r\nfrom the seaboard and the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nThe American system of locating various and extensive manufactories next to\r\nthe plow and the pasture, and adding connecting railroads and steamboats,\r\nhas produced in our distant interior country a result noticeable by the\r\nintelligent portions of all commercial nations. The ingenuity and skill of\r\nAmerican mechanics have been demonstrated at home and abroad in a manner\r\nmost flattering to their pride. But for the extraordinary genius and\r\nability of our mechanics, the achievements of our agriculturists,\r\nmanufacturers, and transporters throughout the country would have been\r\nimpossible of attainment.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the miner has also been great. Of coal our production has\r\nsmall; now many millions of tons are mined annually. So with iron, which\r\nformed scarcely an appreciable part of our products half a century ago, we\r\nnow produce more than the world consumed at the beginning of our national\r\nexistence. Lead, zinc, and copper, from being articles of import, we may\r\nexpect to be large exporters of in the near future. The development of gold\r\nand silver mines in the United States and Territories has not only been\r\nremarkable, but has had a large influence upon the business of all\r\ncommercial nations. Our merchants in the last hundred years have had a\r\nsuccess and have established a reputation for enterprise, sagacity,\r\nprogress, and integrity unsurpassed by peoples of older nationalities. This\r\n\"good name\" is not confined to their homes, but goes out upon every sea and\r\ninto every port where commerce enters. With equal pride we can point to our\r\nprogress in all of the learned professions.\r\n\r\nAs we are now about to enter upon our second centennial--commenting our\r\nmanhood as a nation--it is well to look back upon the past and study what\r\nwill be best to preserve and advance our future greatness From the fall of\r\nAdam for his transgression to the present day no nation has ever been free\r\nfrom threatened danger to its prosperity and happiness. We should look to\r\nthe dangers threatening us, and remedy them so far as lies in our power. We\r\nare a republic whereof one man is as good as another before the law. Under\r\nsuch a form of government it is of the greatest importance that all should\r\nbe possessed of education and intelligence enough to cast a vote with a\r\nright understanding of its meaning. A large association of ignorant men can\r\nnot for any considerable period oppose a successful resistance to tyranny\r\nand oppression from the educated few, but will inevitably sink into\r\nacquiescence to the will of intelligence, whether directed by the demagogue\r\nor by priestcraft. Hence the education of the masses becomes of the first\r\nnecessity for the preservation of our institutions. They are worth\r\npreserving, because they have secured the greatest good to the greatest\r\nproportion of the population of any form of government yet devised. All\r\nother forms of government approach it just in proportion to the general\r\ndiffusion of education and independence of thought and action. As the\r\nprimary step, therefore, to our advancement in all that has marked our\r\nprogress in the past century, I suggest for your earnest consideration, and\r\nmost earnestly recommend it, that a constitutional amendment be submitted\r\nto the legislatures of the several States for ratification, making it the\r\nduty of each of the several States to establish and forever maintain free\r\npublic schools adequate to the education of all the children in the\r\nrudimentary branches within their respective limits, irrespective of sex,\r\ncolor, birthplace, or religions; forbidding the teaching in said schools of\r\nreligious, atheistic, or pagan tenets; and prohibiting the granting of any\r\nschool funds or school taxes, or any part thereof, either by legislative,\r\nmunicipal, or other authority, for the benefit or in aid, directly or\r\nindirectly, of any religious sect or denomination, or in aid or for the\r\nbenefit of any other object of any nature or kind whatever.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this important question I would also call your attention\r\nto the importance of correcting an evil that, if permitted to continue,\r\nwill probably lead to great trouble in our land before the close of the\r\nnineteenth century. It is the accumulation of vast amounts of untaxed\r\nchurch property.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, I believe, the church property of the United States which paid no\r\ntax, municipal or State, amounted to about $83,000,000. In 1860 the amount\r\nhad doubled; in 1875 it is about $1,000,000,000. By 1900, without check, it\r\nis safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. So\r\nvast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of Government without\r\nbearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be\r\nlooked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a growing\r\ncountry, where real estate enhances so rapidly with time as in the United\r\nStates, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by\r\ncorporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate\r\nwithout taxation. The contemplation of so vast a property as here alluded\r\nto, without taxation, may lead to sequestration without constitutional\r\nauthority and through blood.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church or\r\ncorporation, exempting only the last resting place of the dead and\r\npossibly, with proper restrictions, church edifices.\r\n\r\nOur relations with most of the foreign powers continue on a satisfactory\r\nand friendly footing.\r\n\r\nIncreased intercourse, the extension of commerce, and the cultivation of\r\nmutual interests have steadily improved our relations with the large\r\nmajority of the powers of the world, rendering practicable the peaceful\r\nsolution of questions which from time to time necessarily arise, leaving\r\nfew which demand extended or particular notice.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of the Department of State with our diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives abroad is transmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce the passage of an act by the General Cortes of\r\nPortugal, proclaimed since the adjournment of Congress, for the abolition\r\nof servitude in the Portuguese colonies. It is to be hoped that such\r\nlegislation may be another step toward the great consummation to be\r\nreached, when no man shall be permitted, directly or indirectly, under any\r\nguise, excuse, or form of law, to hold his fellow-man in bondage. I am of\r\nopinion also that it is the duty of the United States, as contributing\r\ntoward that end, and required by the spirit of the age in which we live, to\r\nprovide by suitable legislation that no citizen of the United States shall\r\nhold slaves as property in any other country or be interested therein.\r\n\r\nChile has made reparation in the case of the whale ship Good Return, seized\r\nwithout sufficient cause upward of forty years ago. Though she had hitherto\r\ndenied her accountability, the denial was never acquiesced in by this\r\nGovernment, and the justice of the claim has been so earnestly contended\r\nfor that it has been gratifying that she should have at last acknowledged\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrator in the case of the United States steamer Montijo, for the\r\nseizure and detention of which the Government of the United States of\r\nColombia was held accountable, has decided in favor of the claim. This\r\ndecision has settled a question which had been pending for several years,\r\nand which, while it continued open, might more or less disturb the good\r\nunderstanding which it is desirable should be maintained between the two\r\nRepublics.\r\n\r\nA reciprocity treaty with the King of the Hawaiian Islands was concluded\r\nsome months since. As it contains a stipulation that it shall not take\r\neffect until Congress shall enact the proper legislation for that purpose,\r\ncopies of the instrument are herewith submitted, in order that, if such\r\nshould be the pleasure of Congress, the necessary legislation upon the\r\nsubject may be adopted.\r\n\r\nIn March last an arrangement was made, through Mr. Cushing, our minister in\r\nMadrid, with the Spanish Government for the payment by the latter to the\r\nUnited States of the sum of $80,000 in coin, for the purpose of the relief\r\nof the families or persons of the ship's company and certain passengers of\r\nthe Virginius. This sum was to have been paid in three installments at two\r\nmonths each. It is due to the Spanish Government that I should state that\r\nthe payments were fully and spontaneously anticipated by that Government,\r\nand that the whole amount was paid within but a few days more than two\r\nmonths from the date of the agreement, a copy of which is herewith\r\ntransmitted. In pursuance of the terms of the adjustment, I have directed\r\nthe distribution of the amount among the parties entitled thereto,\r\nincluding the ship's company and such of the passengers as were American\r\ncitizens. Payments are made accordingly, on the application by the parties\r\nentitled thereto.\r\n\r\nThe past year has furnished no evidence of an approaching termination of\r\nthe ruinous conflict which has been raging for seven years in the\r\nneighboring island of Cuba. The same disregard of the laws of civilized\r\nwarfare and of the just demands of humanity which has heretofore called\r\nforth expressions of condemnation from the nations of Christendom has\r\ncontinued to blacken the sad scene. Desolation, ruin, and pillage are\r\npervading the rich fields of one of the most fertile and productive regions\r\nof the earth, and the incendiary's torch, firing plantations and valuable\r\nfactories and buildings, is the agent marking the alternate advance or\r\nretreat of contending parties.\r\n\r\nThe protracted continuance of this strife seriously affects the interests\r\nof all commercial nations, but those of the United States more than others,\r\nby reason of close proximity, its larger trade and intercourse with Cuba,\r\nand the frequent and intimate personal and social relations which have\r\ngrown up between its citizens and those of the island. Moreover, the\r\nproperty of our citizens in Cuba is large, and is rendered insecure and\r\ndepreciated in value and in capacity of production by the continuance of\r\nthe strife and the unnatural mode of its conduct. The same is true,\r\ndiffering only in degree, with respect to the interests and people of other\r\nnations; and the absence of any reasonable assurance of a near termination\r\nof the conflict must of necessity soon compel the States thus suffering to\r\nconsider what the interests of their own people and their duty toward\r\nthemselves may demand.\r\n\r\nI have hoped that Spain would be enabled to establish peace in her colony,\r\nto afford security to the property and the interests of our citizens, and\r\nallow legitimate scope to trade and commerce and the natural productions of\r\nthe island. Because of this hope, and from an extreme reluctance to\r\ninterfere in the most remote manner in the affairs of another and a\r\nfriendly nation, especially of one whose sympathy and friendship in the\r\nstruggling infancy of our own existence must ever be remembered with\r\ngratitude, I have patiently and anxiously waited the progress of events.\r\nOur own civil conflict is too recent for us not to consider the\r\ndifficulties which surround a government distracted by a dynastic rebellion\r\nat home at the same time that it has to cope with a separate insurrection\r\nin a distant colony. But whatever causes may have produced the situation\r\nwhich so grievously affects our interests, it exists, with all its\r\nattendant evils operating directly upon this country and its people. Thus\r\nfar all the efforts of Spain have proved abortive, and time has marked no\r\nimprovement in the situation. The armed bands of either side now occupy\r\nnearly the same ground as in the past, with the difference, from time to\r\ntime, of more lives sacrificed, more property destroyed, and wider extents\r\nof fertile and productive fields and more and more of valuable property\r\nconstantly wantonly sacrificed to the incendiary's torch.\r\n\r\nIn contests of this nature, where a considerable body of people who have\r\nattempted to free themselves of the control of the superior government have\r\nreached such point in occupation of territory, in power, and in general\r\norganization as to constitute in fact a body politic; having a government\r\nin substance as well as in name; possessed of the elements of stability and\r\nequipped with the machinery for the administration of internal policy and\r\nthe execution of its laws; prepared and able to administer justice at home,\r\nas well as in its dealings with other powers, it is within the province of\r\nthose other powers to recognize its existence as a new and independent\r\nnation. In such cases other nations simply deal with an actually existing\r\ncondition of things, and recognize as one of the powers of the earth that\r\nbody politic which, possessing the necessary elements, has in fact become a\r\nnew power. In a word, the creation of a new state is a fact.\r\n\r\nTo establish the condition of things essential to the recognition of this\r\nfact there must be a people occupying a known territory, united under some\r\nknown and defined form of government, acknowledged by those subject\r\nthereto, in which the functions of government are administered by usual\r\nmethods, competent to mete out justice to citizens and strangers, to afford\r\nremedies for public and for private wrongs, and able to assume the\r\ncorrelative international obligations and capable of performing the\r\ncorresponding international duties resulting from its acquisition of the\r\nrights of sovereignty. A power should exist complete in its organization,\r\nready to take and able to maintain its place among the nations of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWhile conscious that the insurrection in Cuba has shown a strength and\r\nendurance which make it at least doubtful whether it be in the power of\r\nSpain to subdue it, it seems unquestionable that no such civil organization\r\nexists which may be recognized as an independent government capable of\r\nperforming its international obligations and entitled to be treated as one\r\nof the powers of the earth. A recognition under such circumstances would be\r\ninconsistent with the facts, and would compel the power granting it soon to\r\nsupport by force the government to which it had really given its only claim\r\nof existence. In my judgment the United States should adhere to the policy\r\nand the principles which have heretofore been its sure and safe guides in\r\nlike contests between revolted colonies and their mother country, and,\r\nacting only upon the clearest evidence, should avoid any possibility of\r\nsuspicion or of imputation.\r\n\r\nA recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,\r\nimpracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself is\r\nthat of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nIn a former message to Congress I had occasion to consider this question,\r\nand reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful and\r\ndevastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful dignity of\r\nwar. Regarding it now, after this lapse of time, I am unable to see that\r\nany notable success or any marked or real advance on the part of the\r\ninsurgents has essentially changed the character of the contest. It has\r\nacquired greater age, but not greater or more formidable proportions. It is\r\npossible that the acts of foreign powers, and even acts of Spain herself,\r\nof this very nature, might be pointed to in defense of such recognition.\r\nBut now, as in its past history, the United States should carefully avoid\r\nthe false lights which might lead it into the mazes of doubtful law and of\r\nquestionable propriety, and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule, which\r\nhas been its guide, of doing only that which is right and honest and of\r\ngood report. The question of according or of withholding rights of\r\nbelligerency must be judged in every case in view of the particular\r\nattending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always, and justly,\r\nregarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of moral\r\nsupport to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is required, when the\r\ninterests and rights of another government or of its people are so far\r\naffected by a pending civil conflict as to require a definition of its\r\nrelations to the parties thereto. But this conflict must be one which will\r\nbe recognized in the sense of international law as war. Belligerence, too,\r\nis a fact. The mere existence of contending armed bodies and their\r\noccasional conflicts do not constitute war in the sense referred to.\r\nApplying to the existing condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized\r\nby publicists and writers on international law, and which have been\r\nobserved by nations of dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitive\r\nor selfish and unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection the\r\nexistence of such a substantial political organization, real, palpable, and\r\nmanifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinary\r\nfunctions of government toward its own people and to other states, with\r\ncourts for the administration of justice, with a local habitation,\r\npossessing such organization of force, such material, such occupation of\r\nterritory, as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebellious\r\ninsurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible footing\r\nof war, to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate it. The\r\ncontest, moreover, is solely on land; the insurrection has not possessed\r\nitself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its flag, nor has it\r\nany means of communication with foreign powers except through the military\r\nlines of its adversaries. No apprehension of any of those sudden and\r\ndifficult complications which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate\r\nupon the vessels, both commercial and national, and upon the consular\r\nofficers of other powers calls for the definition of their relations to the\r\nparties to the contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regard\r\nthe accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature as\r\nI regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of right. Such\r\nrecognition entails upon the country according the rights which flow from\r\nit difficult and complicated duties, and requires the exaction from the\r\ncontending parties of the strict observance of their rights and\r\nobligations; it confers the right of search upon the high seas by vessels\r\nof both parties; it would subject the carrying of arms and munitions of\r\nwar, which now may be transported freely and without interruption in the\r\nvessels of the United States, to detention and to possible seizure; it\r\nwould give rise to countless vexatious questions, would release the parent\r\nGovernment from responsibility for acts done by the insurgents, and would\r\ninvest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognized by our\r\ntreaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high seas, a very large part of\r\nwhich, in its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and between\r\nall of them and the States on the Pacific, passes through the waters which\r\nwash the shores of Cuba. The exercise of this supervision could scarce fail\r\nto lead, if not to abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful\r\nrelations of the two States. There can be little doubt to what result such\r\nsupervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy of the\r\nUnited States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures of\r\nquestionable right or expediency or by any indirection. Apart from any\r\nquestion of theoretical right, I am satisfied that while the accordance of\r\nbelligerent rights to the insurgents in Cuba might give them a hope and an\r\ninducement to protract the struggle, it would be but a delusive hope, and\r\nwould not remove the evils which this Government and its people are\r\nexperiencing, but would draw the United States into complications which it\r\nhas waited long and already suffered much to avoid. The recognition of\r\nindependence or of belligerency being thus, in my judgment, equally\r\ninadmissible, it remains to consider what course shall be adopted should\r\nthe conflict not soon be brought to an end by acts of the parties\r\nthemselves, and should the evils which result therefrom, affecting all\r\nnations, and particularly the United States, continue. In such event I am\r\nof opinion that other nations will be compelled to assume the\r\nresponsibility which devolves upon them, and to seriously consider the only\r\nremaining measures possible--mediation and intervention, Owing, perhaps, to\r\nthe large expanse of water separating the island from the peninsula, the\r\nwant of harmony and of personal sympathy between the inhabitants of the\r\ncolony and those sent thither to rule them, and want of adaptation of the\r\nancient colonial system of Europe to the present times and to the ideas\r\nwhich the events of the past century have developed, the contending parties\r\nappear to have within themselves no depository of common confidence to\r\nsuggest wisdom when passion and excitement have their sway and to assume\r\nthe part of peacemaker. In this view in the earlier days of the contest the\r\ngood offices of the United States as a mediator were tendered in good\r\nfaith, without any selfish purpose, in the interest of humanity and in\r\nsincere friendship for both parties, but were at the time declined by\r\nSpain, with the declaration, nevertheless, that at a future time they would\r\nbe indispensable. No intimation has been received that in the opinion of\r\nSpain that time has been reached. And yet the strife continues, with all\r\nits dread horrors and all its injuries to the interests of the United\r\nStates and of other nations. Each party seems quite capable of working\r\ngreat injury and damage to the other, as well as to all the relations and\r\ninterests dependent on the existence of peace in the island; but they seem\r\nincapable of reaching any adjustment, and both have thus far failed of\r\nachieving any success whereby one party shall possess and control the\r\nisland to the exclusion of the other. Under these circumstances the agency\r\nof others, either by mediation or by intervention, seems to be the only\r\nalternative which must, sooner or later, be invoked for the termination of\r\nthe strife. At the same time, while thus impressed I do not at this time\r\nrecommend the adoption of any measure of intervention. I shall be ready at\r\nall times, and as the equal friend of both parties, to respond to a\r\nsuggestion that the good offices of the United States will be acceptable to\r\naid in bringing about a peace honorable to both. It is due to Spain, so far\r\nas this Government is concerned, that the agency of a third power, to which\r\nI have adverted, shall be adopted only as a last expedient. Had it been the\r\ndesire of the United States to interfere in the affairs of Cuba, repeated\r\nopportunities for so doing have been presented within the last few years;\r\nbut we have remained passive, and have performed our whole duty and all\r\ninternational obligations to Spain with friendship, fairness, and fidelity,\r\nand with a spirit of patience and forbearance which negatives every\r\npossible suggestion of desire to interfere or to add to the difficulties\r\nwith which she has been surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Spain has recently submitted to our minister at Madrid\r\ncertain proposals which it is hoped may be found to be the basis, if not\r\nthe actual submission, of terms to meet the requirements of the particular\r\ngriefs of which this Government has felt itself entitled to complain. These\r\nproposals have not yet reached me in their full text. On their arrival they\r\nwill be taken into careful examination, and may, I hope, lead to a\r\nsatisfactory adjustment of the questions to which they refer and remove the\r\npossibility of future occurrences such as have given rise to our just\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nIt is understood also that renewed efforts are being made to introduce\r\nreforms in the internal administration of the island. Persuaded, however,\r\nthat a proper regard for the interests of the United States and of its\r\ncitizens entitles it to relief from the strain to which it has been\r\nsubjected by the difficulties of the questions and the wrongs and losses\r\nwhich arise from the contest in Cuba, and that the interests of humanity\r\nitself demand the cessation of the strife before the whole island shall be\r\nlaid waste and larger sacrifices of life be made, I shall feel it my duty,\r\nshould my hopes of a satisfactory adjustment and of the early restoration\r\nof peace and the removal of future causes of complaint be, unhappily,\r\ndisappointed, to make a further communication to Congress at some period\r\nnot far remote, and during the present session, recommending what may then\r\nseem to me to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe free zone, so called, several years since established by the Mexican\r\nGovernment in certain of the States of that Republic adjacent to our\r\nfrontier, remains in full operation. It has always been materially\r\ninjurious to honest traffic, for it operates as an incentive to traders in\r\nMexico to supply without customs charges the wants of inhabitants on this\r\nside of the line, and prevents the same wants from being supplied by\r\nmerchants of the United States, thereby to a considerable extent defrauding\r\nour revenue and checking honest commercial enterprise.\r\n\r\nDepredations by armed bands from Mexico on the people of Texas near the\r\nfrontier continue. Though the main object of these incursions is robbery,\r\nthey frequently result in the murder of unarmed and peaceably disposed\r\npersons, and in some instances even the United States post-offices and mail\r\ncommunications have been attacked. Renewed remonstrances upon this subject\r\nhave been addressed to the Mexican Government, but without much apparent\r\neffect. The military force of this Government disposable for service in\r\nthat quarter is quite inadequate to effectually guard the line, even at\r\nthose points where the incursions are usually made. An experiment of an\r\narmed vessel on the Rio Grande for that purpose is on trial, and it is\r\nhoped that, if not thwarted by the shallowness of the river and other\r\nnatural obstacles, it may materially contribute to the protection of the\r\nherdsmen of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the joint commission under the convention between the\r\nUnited States and Mexico of the 4th of July, 1868, on the subject of\r\nclaims, will soon be brought to a close. The result of those proceedings\r\nwill then be communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce that the Government of Venezuela has, upon further\r\nconsideration, practically abandoned its objection to pay to the United\r\nStates that share of its revenue which some years since it allotted toward\r\nthe extinguishment of the claims of foreigners generally. In thus\r\nreconsidering its determination that Government has shown a just sense of\r\nself-respect which can not fail to reflect credit upon it in the eyes of\r\nall disinterested persons elsewhere. It is to be regretted, however, that\r\nits payments on account of claims of citizens of the United States are\r\nstill so meager in amount, and that the stipulations of the treaty in\r\nregard to the sums to be paid and the periods when those payments were to\r\ntake place should have been so signally disregarded.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratification\r\nof a treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium, and of conventions\r\nwith the Mexican Republic for the further extension of the joint commission\r\nrespecting claims; with the Hawaiian Islands for commercial reciprocity,\r\nand with the Ottoman Empire for extradition; all of which have been duly\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims has prosecuted its important\r\nduties very assiduously and very satisfactorily. It convened and was\r\norganized on the 22d day of July, 1874, and by the terms of the act under\r\nwhich it was created was to exist for one year from that date. The act\r\nprovided, however, that should it be found impracticable to complete the\r\nwork of the court before the expiration of the year the President might by\r\nproclamation extend the time of its duration to a period not more than six\r\nmonths beyond the expiration of the one year.\r\n\r\nHaving received satisfactory evidence that it would be impracticable to\r\ncomplete the work within the time originally fixed, I issued a proclamation\r\n(a copy of which is presented herewith) extending the time of duration of\r\nthe court for a period of six months from and after the 22d day of July\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nA report made through the clerk of the court (communicated herewith) shows\r\nthe condition of the calendar on the 1st of November last and the large\r\namount of work which has been accomplished. One thousand three hundred and\r\neighty-two claims have been presented, of which 682 had been disposed of at\r\nthe date of the report. I am informed that 170 cases were decided during\r\nthe month of November. Arguments are being made and decisions given in the\r\nremaining cases with all the dispatch consistent with the proper\r\nconsideration of the questions submitted. Many of these claims are in\r\nbehalf of mariners, or depend on the evidence of mariners, whose absence\r\nhas delayed the taking or the return of the necessary evidence.\r\n\r\nIt is represented to me that it will be impracticable for the court to\r\nfinally dispose of all the cases before it within the present limit of its\r\nduration. Justice to the parties claimant, who have been at large expense\r\nin preparing their claims and obtaining the evidence in their support,\r\nsuggests a short extension, to enable the court to dispose of all of the\r\nclaims which have been presented.\r\n\r\nI recommend the legislation which may be deemed proper to enable the court\r\nto complete the work before it.\r\n\r\nI recommend that some suitable provision be made, by the creation of a\r\nspecial court or by conferring the necessary jurisdiction upon some\r\nappropriate tribunal, for the consideration and determination of the claims\r\nof aliens against the Government of the United States which have arisen\r\nwithin some reasonable limitation of time, or which may hereafter arise,\r\nexcluding all claims barred by treaty provisions or otherwise. It has been\r\nfound impossible to give proper consideration to these claims by the\r\nExecutive Departments of the Government. Such a tribunal would afford an\r\nopportunity to aliens other than British subjects to present their claims\r\non account of acts committed against their persons or property during the\r\nrebellion, as also to those subjects of Great Britain whose claims, having\r\narisen subsequent to the 9th day of April, 1865, could not be presented to\r\nthe late commission organized pursuant to the provisions of the treaty of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe electric telegraph has become an essential and indispensable agent in\r\nthe transmission of business and social messages. Its operation on land,\r\nand within the limit of particular states, is necessarily under the control\r\nof the jurisdiction within which it operates. The lines on the high seas,\r\nhowever, are not subject to the particular control of any one government.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 a concession was granted by the French Government to a company\r\nwhich proposed to lay a cable from the shores of France to the United\r\nStates. At that time there was a telegraphic connection between the United\r\nStates and the continent of Europe (through the possessions of Great\r\nBritain at either end of the line), under the control of an association\r\nwhich had, at large outlay of capital and at great risk, demonstrated the\r\npracticability of maintaining such means of communication. The cost of\r\ncorrespondence by this agency was great, possibly not too large at the time\r\nfor a proper remuneration for so hazardous and so costly an enterprise. It\r\nwas, however, a heavy charge upon a means of communication which the\r\nprogress in the social and commercial intercourse of the world found to be\r\na necessity, and the obtaining of this French concession showed that other\r\ncapital than that already invested was ready to enter into competition,\r\nwith assurance of adequate return for their outlay. Impressed with the\r\nconviction that the interests, not only of the people of the United States,\r\nbut of the world at large, demanded, or would demand, the multiplication of\r\nsuch means of communication between separated continents, I was desirous\r\nthat the proposed connection should be made; but certain provisions of this\r\nconcession were deemed by me to be objectionable, particularly one which\r\ngave for a long term of years the exclusive right of telegraphic\r\ncommunication by submarine cable between the shores of France and the\r\nUnited States. I could not concede that any power should claim the right to\r\nland a cable on the shores of the United States and at the same time deny\r\nto the United States, or to its citizens or grantees, an equal fight to\r\nland a cable on its shores. The right to control the conditions for the\r\nlaying of a cable within the jurisdictional waters of the United States, to\r\nconnect our shores with those of any foreign state, pertains exclusively to\r\nthe Government of the United States, under such limitations and conditions\r\nas Congress may impose. In the absence of legislation by Congress I was\r\nunwilling, on the one hand, to yield to a foreign state the right to say\r\nthat its grantees might land on our shores while it denied a similar right\r\nto our people to land on its shores, and, on the other hand, I was\r\nreluctant to deny to the great interests of the world and of civilization\r\nthe facilities of such communication as were proposed. I therefore withheld\r\nany resistance to the landing of the cable on condition that the offensive\r\nmonopoly feature of the concession be abandoned, and that the right of any\r\ncable which may be established by authority of this Government to land upon\r\nFrench territory and to connect with French land lines and enjoy all the\r\nnecessary facilities or privileges incident to the use thereof upon as\r\nfavorable terms as any other company be conceded. As the result thereof the\r\ncompany in question renounced the exclusive privilege, and the\r\nrepresentative of France was informed that, understanding this\r\nrelinquishment to be construed as granting the entire reciprocity and equal\r\nfacilities which had been demanded, the opposition to the landing of the\r\ncable was withdrawn. The cable, under this French concession, was landed in\r\nthe month of July, 1869, and has been an efficient and valuable agent of\r\ncommunication between this country and the other continent. It soon passed\r\nunder the control, however, of those who had the management of the cable\r\nconnecting Great Britain with this continent, and thus whatever benefit to\r\nthe public might have ensued from competition between the two lines was\r\nlost, leaving only the greater facilities of an additional line and the\r\nadditional security in case of accident to one of them. But these increased\r\nfacilities and this additional security, together with the control of the\r\ncombined capital of the two companies, gave also greater power to prevent\r\nthe future construction of other lines and to limit the control of\r\ntelegraphic communication between the two continents to those possessing\r\nthe lines already laid. Within a few months past a cable has been laid,\r\nknown as the United States Direct Cable Company, connecting the United\r\nStates directly with Great Britain. As soon as this cable was reported to\r\nbe laid and in working order the rates of the then existing consolidated\r\ncompanies were greatly reduced. Soon, however, a break was announced in\r\nthis new cable, and immediately the rates of the other line, which had been\r\nreduced, were again raised. This cable being now repaired, the rates appear\r\nnot to be reduced by either line from those formerly charged by the\r\nconsolidated companies.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that large amounts of capital, both at home and\r\nabroad, are ready to seek profitable investment in the advancement of this\r\nuseful and most civilizing means of intercourse and correspondence. They\r\nawait, however, the assurance of the means and conditions on which they may\r\nsafely be made tributary to the general good.\r\n\r\nAs these cable telegraph lines connect separate states, there are questions\r\nas to their organization and control which probably can be best, if not\r\nsolely, settled by conventions between the respective states. In the\r\nabsence, however, of international conventions on the subject, municipal\r\nlegislation may secure many points which appear to me important, if not\r\nindispensable for the protection of the public against the extortions which\r\nmay result from a monopoly of the right of operating cable telegrams or\r\nfrom a combination between several lines:\r\n\r\nI. No line should be allowed to land on the shores of the United States\r\nunder the concession from another power which does not admit the right of\r\nany other line or lines, formed in the United States, to land and freely\r\nconnect with and operate through its land lines.\r\n\r\nII. No line should be allowed to land on the shores of the United States\r\nwhich is not, by treaty stipulation with the government from whose shores\r\nit proceeds, or by prohibition in its charter, or otherwise to the\r\nsatisfaction of this Government, prohibited from consolidating or\r\namalgamating with any other cable telegraph line, or combining therewith\r\nfor the purpose of regulating and maintaining the cost of telegraphing.\r\n\r\nIII. All lines should be bound to give precedence in the transmission of\r\nthe official messages of the governments of the two countries between which\r\nit may be laid.\r\n\r\nIV. A power should be reserved to the two governments, either conjointly or\r\nto each, as regards the messages dispatched from its shores, to fix a limit\r\nto the charges to be demanded for the transmission of messages.\r\n\r\nI present this subject to the earnest consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and unless Congress otherwise direct, I shall not oppose\r\nthe landing of any telegraphic cable which complies with and assents to the\r\npoints above enumerated, but will feel it my duty to prevent the landing of\r\nany which does not conform to the first and second points as stated, and\r\nwhich will not stipulate to concede to this Government the precedence in\r\nthe transmission of its official messages and will not enter into a\r\nsatisfactory arrangement with regard to its charges.\r\n\r\nAmong the pressing and important subjects to which, in my opinion, the\r\nattention of Congress should be directed are those relating to fraudulent\r\nnaturalization and expatriation.\r\n\r\nThe United States, with great liberality, offers its citizenship to all who\r\nin good faith comply with the requirements of law. These requirements are\r\nas simple and upon as favorable terms to the emigrant as the high privilege\r\nto which he is admitted can or should permit. I do not propose any\r\nadditional requirements to those which the law now demands; but the very\r\nsimplicity and the want of unnecessary formality in our law have made\r\nfraudulent naturalization not infrequent, to the discredit and injury of\r\nall honest citizens, whether native or naturalized. Cases of this character\r\nare continually being brought to the notice of the Government by our\r\nrepresentatives abroad, and also those of persons resident in other\r\ncountries, most frequently those who, if they have remained in this country\r\nlong enough to entitle them to become naturalized, have generally not much\r\noverpassed that period, and have returned to the country of their origin,\r\nwhere they reside, avoiding all duties to the United States by their\r\nabsence, and claiming to be exempt from all duties to the country of their\r\nnativity and of their residence by reason of their alleged naturalization.\r\nIt is due to this Government itself and to the great mass of the\r\nnaturalized citizens who entirely, both in name and in fact, become\r\ncitizens of the United States that the high privilege of citizenship of the\r\nUnited States should not be held by fraud or in derogation of the laws and\r\nof the good name of every honest citizen. On many occasions it has been\r\nbrought to the knowledge of the Government that certificates of\r\nnaturalization are held and protection or interference claimed by parties\r\nwho admit that not only they were not within the United States at the time\r\nof the pretended naturalization, but that they have never resided in the\r\nUnited States; in others the certificate and record of the court show on\r\ntheir face that the person claiming to be naturalized had not resided the\r\nrequired time in the United States; in others it is admitted upon\r\nexamination that the requirements of law have not been complied with; in\r\nsome cases, even, such certificates have been matter of purchase. These are\r\nnot isolated cases, arising at rare intervals, but of common occurrence,\r\nand which are reported from all quarters of the globe. Such occurrences can\r\nnot, and do not, fail to reflect upon the Government and injure all honest\r\ncitizens. Such a fraud being discovered, however, there is no practicable\r\nmeans within the control of the Government by which the record of\r\nnaturalization can be vacated; and should the certificate be taken up, as\r\nit usually is, by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the\r\nGovernment to whom it may have been presented, there is nothing to prevent\r\nthe person claiming to have been naturalized from obtaining a new\r\ncertificate from the court in place of that which has been taken from him.\r\n\r\nThe evil has become so great and of such frequent occurrence that I can not\r\ntoo earnestly recommend that some effective measures be adopted to provide\r\na proper remedy and means for the vacating of any record thus fraudulently\r\nmade, and of punishing the guilty parties to the transaction.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I refer also to the question of expatriation and the\r\nelection of nationality.\r\n\r\nThe United States was foremost in upholding the right of expatriation, and\r\nwas principally instrumental in overthrowing the doctrine of perpetual\r\nallegiance. Congress has declared the right of expatriation to be a natural\r\nand inherent right of all people; but while many other nations have enacted\r\nlaws providing what formalities shall be necessary to work a change of\r\nallegiance, the United States has enacted no provisions of law and has in\r\nno respect marked out how and when expatriation may be accomplished by its\r\ncitizens. Instances are brought to the attention of the Government where\r\ncitizens of the United States, either naturalized or native born, have\r\nformally become citizens or subjects of foreign powers, but who,\r\nnevertheless, in the absence of any provisions of legislation on this\r\nquestion, when involved in difficulties or when it seems to be their\r\ninterest, claim to be citizens of the United States and demand the\r\nintervention of a Government which they have long since abandoned and to\r\nwhich for years they have rendered no service nor held themselves in any\r\nway amenable.\r\n\r\nIn other cases naturalized citizens, immediately after naturalization, have\r\nreturned to their native country; have become engaged in business; have\r\naccepted offices or pursuits inconsistent with American citizenship, and\r\nevidence no intent to return to the United States until called upon to\r\ndischarge some duty to the country where they are residing, when at once\r\nthey assert their citizenship and call upon the representatives of the\r\nGovernment to aid them in their unjust pretensions. It is but justice to\r\nall bona fide citizens that no doubt should exist on such questions, and\r\nthat Congress should determine by enactment of law how expatriation may be\r\naccomplished and change of citizenship be established.\r\n\r\nI also invite your attention to the necessity of regulating by law the\r\nstatus of American women who may marry foreigners, and of defining more\r\nfully that of children born in a foreign country of American parents who\r\nmay reside abroad; and also of some further provision regulating or giving\r\nlegal effect to marriages of American citizens contracted in foreign\r\ncountries. The correspondence submitted herewith shows a few of the\r\nconstantly occurring questions on these points presented to the\r\nconsideration of the Government. There are few subjects to engage the\r\nattention of Congress on which more delicate relations or more important\r\ninterests are dependent.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July last the building erected for the Department of State\r\nwas taken possession of and occupied by that Department. I am happy to\r\nannounce that the archives and valuable papers of the Government in the\r\ncustody of that Department are now safely deposited and properly cared\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts from customs\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, to have been $163,103,833.69, and\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1875, to have been $157,267,722.35, a\r\ndecrease for the last fiscal year of $5,936,111.34. Receipts from internal\r\nrevenue for the year ending the 30th of June, 1874, were $102,409,784.90,\r\nand for the year ending June 30, 1875, $110,007,493.58; increase,\r\n$7,597,708.68.\r\n\r\nThe report also shows a complete history of the workings of the Department\r\nfor the last year, and contains recommendations for reforms and for\r\nlegislation which I concur in, but can not comment on so fully as I should\r\nlike to do if space would permit, but will confine myself to a few\r\nsuggestions which I look upon as vital to the best interests of the whole\r\npeople--coming within the purview of \"Treasury;\" I mean specie resumption.\r\nToo much stress can not be laid upon this question, and I hope Congress may\r\nbe induced, at the earliest day practicable, to insure the consummation of\r\nthe act of the last Congress, at its last session, to bring about specie\r\nresumption \"on and after the 1st of January, 1879,\" at furthest. It would\r\nbe a great blessing if this could be consummated even at an earlier day.\r\n\r\nNothing seems to me more certain than that a full, healthy, and permanent\r\nreaction can not take place in favor of the industries and financial\r\nwelfare of the country until we return to a measure of values recognized\r\nthroughout the civilized world. While we use a currency not equivalent to\r\nthis standard the world's recognized standard, specie, becomes a commodity\r\nlike the products of the soil, the surplus seeking a market wherever there\r\nis a demand for it.\r\n\r\nUnder our present system we should want none, nor would we have any, were\r\nit not that customs dues must be paid in coin and because of the pledge to\r\npay interest on the public debt in coin. The yield of precious metals would\r\nflow out for the purchase of foreign productions and the United States\r\n\"hewers of wood and drawers of water,\" because of wiser legislation on the\r\nsubject of finance by the nations with whom we have dealings. I am not\r\nprepared to say that I can suggest the best legislation to secure the end\r\nmost heartily recommended. It will be a source of great gratification to me\r\nto be able to approve any measure of Congress looking effectively toward\r\nsecuring \"resumption.\"\r\n\r\nUnlimited inflation would probably bring about specie payments more\r\nspeedily than any legislation looking to redemption of the legal-tenders in\r\ncoin; but it would be at the expense of honor. The legal-tenders would have\r\nno value beyond settling present liabilities, or, properly speaking,\r\nrepudiating them. They would buy nothing after debts were all settled.\r\n\r\nThere are a few measures which seem to me important in this connection and\r\nwhich I commend to your earnest consideration:\r\n\r\nA repeal of so much of the legal-tender act as makes these notes receivable\r\nfor debts contracted after a date to be fixed in the act itself, say not\r\nlater than the 1st of January, 1877. We should then have quotations at real\r\nvalues, not fictitious ones. Gold would no longer be at a premium, but\r\ncurrency at a discount. A healthy reaction would set in at once, and with\r\nit a desire to make the currency equal to what it purports to be. The\r\nmerchants, manufacturers, and tradesmen of every calling could do business\r\non a fair margin of profit, the money to be received having an unvarying\r\nvalue. Laborers and all classes who work for stipulated pay or salary would\r\nreceive more for their income, because extra profits would no longer be\r\ncharged by the capitalists to compensate for the risk of a downward\r\nfluctuation in the value of the currency.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to redeem, say,\r\nnot to exceed $2,000,000 monthly of legal-tender notes, by issuing in their\r\nstead a long bond, bearing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent per annum,\r\nof denominations ranging from $50 up to $1,000 each. This would in time\r\nreduce the legal-tender notes to a volume that could be kept afloat without\r\ndemanding redemption in large sums suddenly.\r\n\r\nThird. That additional power be given to the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\naccumulate gold for final redemption, either by increasing revenue,\r\ncurtailing expenses, or both (it is preferable to do both); and I recommend\r\nthat reduction of expenditures be made wherever it can be done without\r\nimpairing Government obligations or crippling the due execution thereof.\r\nOne measure for increasing the revenue--and the only one I think of--is the\r\nrestoration of the duty on tea and coffee. These duties would add probably\r\n$18,000,000 to the present amount received from imports, and would in no\r\nway increase the prices paid for those articles by the consumers.\r\n\r\nThese articles are the products of countries collecting revenue from\r\nexports, and as we, the largest consumers, reduce the duties they\r\nproportionately increase them. With this addition to the revenue, many\r\nduties now collected, and which give but an insignificant return for the\r\ncost of collection, might be remitted, and to the direct advantage of\r\nconsumers at home.\r\n\r\nI would mention those articles which enter into manufactures of all sorts.\r\nAll duty paid upon such articles goes directly to the cost of the article\r\nwhen manufactured here, and must be paid for by the consumers. These duties\r\nnot only come from the consumers at home, but act as a protection to\r\nforeign manufacturers of the same completed articles in our own and distant\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nI will suggest or mention another subject bearing upon the problem of \"how\r\nto enable the Secretary of the Treasury to accumulate balances.\" It is to\r\ndevise some better method of verifying claims against the Government than\r\nat present exists through the Court of Claims, especially those claims\r\ngrowing out of the late war. Nothing is more certain than that a very large\r\npercentage of the amounts passed and paid are either wholly fraudulent or\r\nare far in excess of the real losses sustained. The large amount of losses\r\nproven--on good testimony according to existing laws, by affidavits of\r\nfictitious or unscrupulous persons--to have been sustained on small farms\r\nand plantations are not only far beyond the possible yield of those places\r\nfor any one year, but, as everyone knows who has had experience in tilling\r\nthe soil and who has visited the scenes of these spoliations, are in many\r\ninstances more than the individual claimants were ever worth, including\r\ntheir personal and real estate.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General, which will be submitted to Congress at\r\nan early day, will contain a detailed history of awards made and of claim\r\npending of the class here referred to.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War, accompanying this message, gives a\r\ndetailed account of Army operations for the year just passed, expenses for\r\nmaintenance, etc., with recommendations for legislation to which I\r\nrespectfully invite your attention. To some of these I invite special\r\nattention:\r\n\r\nFirst. The necessity of making $300,000 of the appropriation for the\r\nSubsistence Department available before the beginning of the next fiscal\r\nyear. Without this provision troops at points distant from supply\r\nproduction must either go without food or existing laws must be violated.\r\nIt is not attended with cost to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nSecond. His recommendation for the enactment of a system of annuities for\r\nthe families of deceased officers by voluntary deductions from the monthly\r\npay of officers. This again is not attended with burden upon the Treasury,\r\nand would for the future relieve much distress which every old army officer\r\nhas witnessed in the past--of officers dying suddenly or being killed,\r\nleaving families without even the means of reaching their friends, if\r\nfortunate enough to have friends to aid them.\r\n\r\nThird. The repeal of the law abolishing mileage, and a return to the old\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nFourth. The trial with torpedoes under the Corps of Engineers, and\r\nappropriation for the same. Should war ever occur between the United States\r\nand any maritime power, torpedoes will be among if not the most effective\r\nand cheapest auxiliary for the defense of harbors, and also in aggressive\r\noperations, that we can have. Hence it is advisable to learn by experiment\r\ntheir best construction and application, as well as effect.\r\n\r\nFifth. A permanent organization for the Signal-Service Corps. This service\r\nhas now become a necessity of peace as well as war, under the advancement\r\nmade by the present able management.\r\n\r\nSixth. A renewal of the appropriation for compiling the official records of\r\nthe war, etc.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our Navy at this time is a subject of satisfaction. It\r\ndoes not contain, it is true, any of the powerful cruising ironclads which\r\nmake so much of the maritime strength of some other nations, but neither\r\nour continental situation nor our foreign policy requires that we should\r\nhave a large number of ships of this character, while this situation and\r\nthe nature of our ports combine to make those of other nations little\r\ndangerous to us under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nOur Navy does contain, however, a considerable number of ironclads of the\r\nmonitor class, which, though not properly cruisers, are powerful and\r\neffective for harbor defense and for operations near our own shores. Of\r\nthese all the single-turreted ones, fifteen in number, have been\r\nsubstantially rebuilt, their rotten wooden beams replaced with iron, their\r\nhulls strengthened, and their engines and machinery thoroughly repaired, so\r\nthat they are now in the most efficient condition and ready for sea as soon\r\nas they can be manned and put in commission.\r\n\r\nThe five double-turreted ironclads belonging to our Navy, by far the most\r\npowerful of our ships for fighting purposes, are also in hand undergoing\r\ncomplete repairs, and could be ready for sea in periods varying from four\r\nto six months. With these completed according to the present design and our\r\ntwo iron torpedo boats now ready, our ironclad fleet will be, for the\r\npurposes of defense at home, equal to any force that can readily be brought\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nOf our wooden navy also cruisers of various sizes, to the number of about\r\nforty, including those now in commission, are in the Atlantic, and could be\r\nready for duty as fast as men could be enlisted for those not already in\r\ncommission. Of these, one-third are in effect new ships, and though some of\r\nthe remainder need considerable repairs to their boilers and machinery,\r\nthey all are, or can readily be made, effective.\r\n\r\nThis constitutes a fleet of more than fifty war ships, of which fifteen are\r\nironclad, now in hand on the Atlantic coast. The Navy has been brought to\r\nthis condition by a judicious and practical application of what could be\r\nspared from the current appropriations of the last few years and from that\r\nmade to meet the possible emergency of two years ago. It has been done\r\nquietly, without proclamation or display, and though it has necessarily\r\nstraitened the Department in its ordinary expenditure, and, as far as the\r\nironclads are concerned, has added nothing to the cruising force of the\r\nNavy, yet the result is not the less satisfactory because it is to be found\r\nin a great increase of real rather than apparent force. The expenses\r\nincurred in the maintenance of an effective naval force in all its branches\r\nare necessarily large, but such force is essential to our position,\r\nrelations, and character, and affects seriously the weight of our\r\nprinciples and policy throughout the whole sphere of national\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the regular support of this branch of the service for the\r\nnext year amount to a little less in the aggregate than those made for the\r\ncurrent year; but some additional appropriations are asked for objects not\r\nincluded in the ordinary maintenance of the Navy, but believed to be of\r\npressing importance at this time. It would, in my opinion, be wise at once\r\nto afford sufficient means for the immediate completion of the five\r\ndouble-turreted monitors now undergoing repairs, which must otherwise\r\nadvance slowly, and only as money can be spared from current expenses.\r\nSupplemented by these, our Navy, armed with the destructive weapons of\r\nmodern warfare, manned by our seamen, and in charge of our instructed\r\nofficers, will present a force powerful for the home purposes of a\r\nresponsible though peaceful nation.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General herewith transmitted gives a full\r\nhistory of the workings of the Department for the year just past. It will\r\nbe observed that the deficiency to be supplied from the General Treasury is\r\nincreased over the amount required for the preceding year. In a country so\r\nvast in area as the United States, with large portions sparsely settled, it\r\nmust be expected that this important service will be more or less a burden\r\nupon the Treasury for many years to come. But there is no branch of the\r\npublic service which interests the whole people more than that of cheap and\r\nrapid transmission of the mails to every inhabited part of our territory.\r\nNext to the free school, the post-office is the great educator of the\r\npeople, and it may well receive the support of the General Government.\r\n\r\nThe subsidy of $150,000 per annum given to vessels of the United States for\r\ncarrying the mails between New York and Rio de Janeiro having ceased on the\r\n30th day of September last, we are without direct mail facilities with the\r\nSouth American States. This is greatly to be regretted, and I do not\r\nhesitate to recommend the authorization of a renewal of that contract, and\r\nalso that the service may be increased from monthly to semi-monthly trips.\r\nThe commercial advantages to be gained by a direct line of American\r\nsteamers to the South American States will far outweigh the expense of the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nBy act of Congress approved March 3, 1875, almost all matter, whether\r\nproperly mail matter or not, may be sent any distance through the mails, in\r\npackages not exceeding 4 pounds in weight, for the sum of 16 cents per\r\npound. So far as the transmission of real mail matter goes, this would seem\r\nentirely proper; but I suggest that the law be so amended as to exclude\r\nfrom the mails merchandise of all descriptions, and limit this\r\ntransportation to articles enumerated, and which may be classed as mail\r\nmatter proper.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in the Black Hills, a portion of the Sioux\r\nReservation, has had the effect to induce a large emigration of miners to\r\nthat point. Thus far the effort to protect the treaty rights of the Indians\r\nto that section has been successful, but the next year will certainly\r\nwitness a large increase of such emigration. The negotiations for the\r\nrelinquishment of the gold fields having failed, it will be necessary for\r\nCongress to adopt some measures to relieve the embarrassment growing out of\r\nthe causes named. The Secretary of the Interior suggests that the supplies\r\nnow appropriated for the sustenance of that people, being no longer\r\nobligatory under the treaty of 1868, but simply a gratuity, may be issued\r\nor withheld at his discretion.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Indian Territory, to which I have referred in several\r\nof my former annual messages, remains practically unchanged. The Secretary\r\nof the Interior has taken measures to obtain a full report of the condition\r\nof that Territory, and will make it the subject of a special report at an\r\nearly day. It may then be necessary to make some further recommendation in\r\nregard to legislation for the government of that Territory.\r\n\r\nThe steady growth and increase of the business of the Patent Office\r\nindicates in some measure the progress of the industrial activity of the\r\ncountry. The receipts of the office are in excess of its expenditures, and\r\nthe office generally is in a prosperous and satisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nThe report of the General Land Office shows that there were 2,459,601 acres\r\nless disposed of during this than during the last year. More than one-half\r\nof this decrease was in lands disposed of under the homestead and\r\ntimber-culture laws. The cause of this decrease is supposed to be found in\r\nthe grasshopper scourge and the droughts which prevailed so extensively in\r\nsome of the frontier States and Territories during that time as to\r\ndiscourage and deter entries by actual settlers. The cash receipts were\r\nless by $690,322.23 than during the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe entire surveyed area of the public domain is 680,253,094 acres, of\r\nwhich 26,077,531 acres were surveyed during the past year, leaving\r\n1,154,471,762 acres still unsurveyed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner presents many interesting suggestions in\r\nregard to the management and disposition of the public domain and the\r\nmodification of existing laws, the apparent importance of which should\r\ninsure for them the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe number of pensioners still continues to decrease, the highest number\r\nhaving been reached during the year ending June 30, 1873. During the last\r\nyear 11,557 names were added to the rolls, and 12,977 were dropped\r\ntherefrom, showing a net decrease of 1,420. But while the number of\r\npensioners has decreased, the annual amount due on the pension rolls has\r\nincreased $44,733.13. This is caused by the greatly increased average rate\r\nof pensions, which, by the liberal legislation of Congress, has increased\r\nfrom $90.26 in 1872 to $103.91 in 1875 to each invalid pensioner, an\r\nincrease in the average rate of 15 per cent in the three years. During the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1875, there was paid on account of pensions, including\r\nthe expenses of disbursement, $29,683,116, being $910,632 less than was\r\npaid the preceding year. This reduction in amount of expenditures was\r\nproduced by the decrease in the amount of arrearages due on allowed claims\r\nand on pensions the rate of which was increased by the legislation of the\r\npreceding session of Congress. At the close of the last fiscal year there\r\nwere on the pension rolls 234,821 persons, of whom 210,363 were army\r\npensioners, 105,478 being invalids and 104,885 widows and dependent\r\nrelatives; 3,420 were navy pensioners, of whom 1,636 were invalids and\r\n1,784 widows and dependent relatives; 21,038 were pensioners of the War of\r\n1812, 15,875 of whom were survivors and 5,163 were widows.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that $29,535,000 will be required for the payment of\r\npensions for the next fiscal year, an amount $965,000 less than the\r\nestimate for the present year.\r\n\r\nThe geological explorations have been prosecuted with energy during the\r\nyear, covering an area of about 40,000 square miles in the Territories of\r\nColorado, Utah, and New Mexico, developing the agricultural and mineral\r\nresources and furnishing interesting scientific and topographical details\r\nof that region.\r\n\r\nThe method for the treatment of the Indians adopted at the beginning of my\r\nfirst term has been steadily pursued, and with satisfactory and encouraging\r\nresults. It has been productive of evident improvement in the condition of\r\nthat race, and will be continued, with only such modifications as further\r\nexperience may indicate to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe board heretofore appointed to take charge of the articles and materials\r\npertaining to the War, the Navy, the Treasury, the Interior, and the\r\nPost-Office Departments, and the Department of Agriculture, the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, and the Commission of Food Fishes, to be contributed, under\r\nthe legislation of last session, to the international exhibition to be held\r\nat Philadelphia during the centennial year 1876, has been diligent in the\r\ndischarge of the duties which have devolved upon it; and the preparations\r\nso far made with the means at command give assurance that the governmental\r\ncontribution will be made one of the marked characteristics of the\r\nexhibition. The board has observed commendable economy in the matter of the\r\nerection of a building for the governmental exhibit, the expense of which\r\nit is estimated will not exceed, say, $80,000. This amount has been\r\nwithdrawn, under the law, from the appropriations of five of the principal\r\nDepartments, which leaves some of those Departments without sufficient\r\nmeans to render their respective practical exhibits complete and\r\nsatisfactory. The exhibition being an international one, and the Government\r\nbeing a voluntary contributor, it is my opinion that its contribution\r\nshould be of a character, in quality and extent, to sustain the dignity and\r\ncredit of so distinguished a contributor. The advantages to the country of\r\na creditable display are, in an international point of view, of the first\r\nimportance, while an indifferent or uncreditable participation by the\r\nGovernment would be humiliating to the patriotic feelings of our people\r\nthemselves. I commend the estimates of the board for the necessary\r\nadditional appropriations to the favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe powers of Europe almost without exception, many of the South American\r\nStates, and even the more distant Eastern powers have manifested their\r\nfriendly sentiments toward the United States and the interest of the world\r\nin our progress by taking steps to join with us in celebrating the\r\ncentennial of the nation, and I strongly recommend that a more national\r\nimportance be given to this exhibition by such legislation and by such\r\nappropriation as will insure its success. Its value in bringing to our\r\nshores innumerable useful works of art and skill, the commingling of the\r\ncitizens of foreign countries and our own, and the interchange of ideas and\r\nmanufactures will far exceed any pecuniary outlay we may make.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, together\r\nwith the reports of the Commissioners, the board of audit, and the board of\r\nhealth of the District of Columbia, to all of which I invite your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Agriculture has accomplished much in disseminating useful\r\nknowledge to the agriculturist, and also in introducing new and useful\r\nproductions adapted to our soil and climate, and is worthy of the continued\r\nencouragement of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Education, which accompanies the report\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior, shows a gratifying progress in\r\neducational matters.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting to\r\nCongress I have called attention to the anomalous, not to say scandalous,\r\ncondition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah, and have asked for\r\ndefinite legislation to correct it. That polygamy should exist in a free,\r\nenlightened, and Christian country, without the power to punish so flagrant\r\na crime against decency and morality, seems preposterous. True, there is no\r\nlaw to sustain this unnatural vice; but what is needed is a law to punish\r\nit as a crime, and at the same time to fix the status of the innocent\r\nchildren, the offspring of this system, and of the possibly innocent plural\r\nwives. But as an institution polygamy should be banished from the land.\r\n\r\nWhile this is being done I invite the attention of Congress to another,\r\nthough perhaps no less an evil--the importation of Chinese women, but few\r\nof whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nObservations while visiting the Territories of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado\r\nduring the past autumn convinced me that existing laws regulating the\r\ndisposition of public lands, timber, etc., and probably the mining laws\r\nthemselves, are very defective and should be carefully amended, and at an\r\nearly day. Territory where cultivation of the soil can only be followed by\r\nirrigation, and where irrigation is not practicable the lands can only be\r\nused as pasturage, and this only where stock can reach water (to quench its\r\nthirst), can not be governed by the same laws as to entries as lands every\r\nacre of which is an independent estate by itself.\r\n\r\nLand must be held in larger quantities to justify the expense of conducting\r\nwater upon it to make it fruitful, or to justify utilizing it as pasturage.\r\nThe timber in most of the Territories is principally confined to the\r\nmountain regions, which are held for entry in small quantities only, and as\r\nmineral lands. The timber is the property of the United States, for the\r\ndisposal of which there is now no adequate law. The settler must become a\r\nconsumer of this timber, whether he lives upon the plain or engages in\r\nworking the mines. Hence every man becomes either a trespasser himself or\r\nknowingly a patron of trespassers.\r\n\r\nMy opportunities for observation were not sufficient to justify me in\r\nrecommending specific legislation on these subjects, but I do recommend\r\nthat a joint committee of the two Houses of Congress, sufficiently large to\r\nbe divided into subcommittees, be organized to visit all the mining States\r\nand Territories during the coming summer, and that the committee shall\r\nreport to Congress at the next session such laws or amendments to laws as\r\nit may deem necessary to secure the best interests of the Government and\r\nthe people of these Territories, who are doing so much for their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nI am sure the citizens occupying the territory described do not wish to be\r\ntrespassers, nor will they be if legal ways are provided for them to become\r\nowners of these actual necessities of their position.\r\n\r\nAs this will be the last annual message which I shall have the honor of\r\ntransmitting to Congress before my successor is chosen, I will repeat or\r\nrecapitulate the questions which I deem of vital importance which may be\r\nlegislated upon and settled at this session:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a\r\ngood common-school education to every child within their limits.\r\n\r\nSecond. No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in\r\nwhole or in part by the State, nation, or by the proceeds of any tax levied\r\nupon any community. Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all\r\npersons who can not read and write from becoming voters after the year\r\n1890, disfranchising none, however, on grounds of illiteracy who may be\r\nvoters at the time this amendment takes effect.\r\n\r\nThird. Declare church and state forever separate and distinct, but each\r\nfree within their proper spheres; and that all church property shall bear\r\nits own proportion of taxation.\r\n\r\nFourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as polygamy and the importation\r\nof women for illegitimate purposes. To recur again to the centennial year,\r\nit would seem as though now, as we are about to begin the second century of\r\nour national existence, would be a most fitting time for these reforms.\r\n\r\nFifth. Enact such laws as will insure a speedy return to a sound currency,\r\nsuch as will command the respect of the world.\r\n\r\nBelieving that these views will commend themselves to the great majority of\r\nthe right-thinking and patriotic citizens of the United States, I submit\r\nthe rest to Congress.\r\n\r\nU. S. GRANT\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\nDecember 5, 1876\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn submitting my eighth and last annual message to Congress it seems proper\r\nthat I should refer to and in some degree recapitulate the events and\r\nofficial acts of the past eight years.\r\n\r\nIt was my fortune, or misfortune, to be called to the office of Chief\r\nExecutive without any previous political training. From the age of 17 I had\r\nnever even witnessed the excitement attending a Presidential campaign but\r\ntwice antecedent to my own candidacy, and at but one of them was I eligible\r\nas a voter.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it is but reasonable to suppose that errors of\r\njudgment must have occurred. Even had they not, differences of opinion\r\nbetween the Executive, bound by an oath to the strict performance of his\r\nduties, and writers and debaters must have arisen. It is not necessarily\r\nevidence of blunder on the part of the Executive because there are these\r\ndifferences of views. Mistakes have been made, as all can see and I admit,\r\nbut it seems to me oftener in the selections made of the assistants\r\nappointed to aid in carrying out the various duties of administering the\r\nGovernment--in nearly every case selected without a personal acquaintance\r\nwith the appointee, but upon recommendations of the representatives chosen\r\ndirectly by the people. It is impossible, where so many trusts are to be\r\nallotted, that the right parties should be chosen in every instance.\r\nHistory shows that no Administration from the time of Washington to the\r\npresent has been free from these mistakes. But I leave comparisons to\r\nhistory, claiming only that I have acted in every instance from a\r\nconscientious desire to do what was right, constitutional, within the law,\r\nand for the very best interests of the whole people. Failures have been\r\nerrors of judgment, not of intent.\r\n\r\nMy civil career commenced, too, at a most critical and difficult time. Less\r\nthan four years before, the country had emerged from a conflict such as no\r\nother nation had ever survived. Nearly one-half of the States had revolted\r\nagainst the Government, and of those remaining faithful to the Union a\r\nlarge percentage of the population sympathized with the rebellion and made\r\nan \"enemy in the rear\" almost as dangerous as the more honorable enemy in\r\nthe front. The latter committed errors of judgment, but they maintained\r\nthem openly and courageously; the former received the protection of the\r\nGovernment they would see destroyed, and reaped all the pecuniary advantage\r\nto be gained out of the then existing state of affairs, many of them by\r\nobtaining contracts and by swindling the Government in the delivery of\r\ntheir goods.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the cessation of hostilities the then noble President, who\r\nhad carried the country so far through its perils, fell a martyr to his\r\npatriotism at the hands of an assassin.\r\n\r\nThe intervening time to my first inauguration was filled up with wranglings\r\nbetween Congress and the new Executive as to the best mode of\r\n\"reconstruction,\" or, to speak plainly, as to whether the control of the\r\nGovernment should be thrown immediately into the hands of those who had so\r\nrecently and persistently tried to destroy it, or whether the victors\r\nshould continue to have an equal voice with them in this control.\r\nReconstruction, as finally agreed upon, means this and only this, except\r\nthat the late slave was enfranchised, giving an increase, as was supposed,\r\nto the Union-loving and Union-supporting votes. If free in the full sense\r\nof the word, they would not disappoint this expectation. Hence at the\r\nbeginning of my first Administration the work of reconstruction, much\r\nembarrassed by the long delay, virtually commenced. It was the work of the\r\nlegislative branch of the Government. My province was wholly in approving\r\ntheir acts, which I did most heartily, urging the legislatures of States\r\nthat had not yet done so to ratify the fifteenth amendment to the\r\nConstitution. The country was laboring under an enormous debt, contracted\r\nin the suppression of rebellion, and taxation was so oppressive as to\r\ndiscourage production. Another danger also threatened us--a foreign war.\r\nThe last difficulty had to be adjusted and was adjusted without a war and\r\nin a manner highly honorable to all parties concerned. Taxes have been\r\nreduced within the last seven years nearly $300,000,000, and the national\r\ndebt has been reduced in the same time over $435,000,000. By refunding the\r\n6 per cent bonded debt for bonds bearing 5 and 4 1/2 per cent interest,\r\nrespectively, the annual interest has been reduced from over $130,000,000\r\nin 1869 to but little over $100,000,000 in 1876. The balance of trade has\r\nbeen changed from over $130,000,000 against the United States in 1869 to\r\nmore than $120,000,000 in our favor in 1876.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently believed that the balance of trade in favor of the United\r\nStates will increase, not diminish, and that the pledge of Congress to\r\nresume specie payments in 1879 will be easily accomplished, even in the\r\nabsence of much-desired further legislation on the subject.\r\n\r\nA policy has been adopted toward the Indian tribes inhabiting a large\r\nportion of the territory of the United States which has been humane and has\r\nsubstantially ended Indian hostilities in the whole land except in a\r\nportion of Nebraska, and Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana Territories--the\r\nBlack Hills region and approaches thereto. Hostilities there have grown out\r\nof the avarice of the white man, who has violated our treaty stipulations\r\nin his search for gold. The question might be asked why the Government has\r\nnot enforced obedience to the terms of the treaty prohibiting the\r\noccupation of the Black Hills region by whites. The answer is simple: The\r\nfirst immigrants to the Black Hills were removed by troops, but rumors of\r\nrich discoveries of gold took into that region increased numbers. Gold has\r\nactually been found in paying quantity, and an effort to remove the miners\r\nwould only result in the desertion of the bulk of the troops that might be\r\nsent there to remove them. All difficulty in this matter has, however, been\r\nremoved--subject to the approval of Congress--by a treaty ceding the Black\r\nHills and approaches to settlement by citizens.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Indian policy and treatment is so fully set forth by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and my\r\nviews so fully expressed therein, that I refer to their reports and\r\nrecommendations as my own.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with foreign powers continue on a\r\nfriendly footing.\r\n\r\nQuestions have arisen from time to time in the foreign relations of the\r\nGovernment, but the United States have been happily free during the past\r\nyear from the complications and embarrassments which have surrounded some\r\nof the foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic correspondence submitted herewith contains information as to\r\ncertain of the matters which have occupied the Government.\r\n\r\nThe cordiality which attends our relations with the powers of the earth has\r\nbeen plainly shown by the general participation of foreign nations in the\r\nexhibition which has just closed and by the exertions made by distant\r\npowers to show their interest in and friendly feelings toward the United\r\nStates in the commemoration of the centennial of the nation. The Government\r\nand people of the United States have not only fully appreciated this\r\nexhibition of kindly feeling, but it may be justly and fairly expected that\r\nno small benefits will result both to ourselves and other nations from a\r\nbetter acquaintance, and a better appreciation of our mutual advantages and\r\nmutual wants.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session saw fit to reduce the amount usually\r\nappropriated for foreign intercourse by withholding appropriations for\r\nrepresentatives of the United States in certain foreign countries and for\r\ncertain consular officers, and by reducing the amounts usually appropriated\r\nfor certain other diplomatic posts, and thus necessitating a change in the\r\ngrade of the representatives. For these reasons, immediately upon the\r\npassage of the bill making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular\r\nservice for the present fiscal year, instructions were issued to the\r\nrepresentatives of the United States at Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, and\r\nto the consular officers for whom no appropriation had been made, to close\r\ntheir respective legations and consulates and cease from the performance of\r\ntheir duties; and in like manner steps were immediately taken to substitute\r\ncharge's d'affaires for ministers resident in Portugal, Denmark, Greece,\r\nSwitzerland, and Paraguay.\r\n\r\nWhile thoroughly impressed with the wisdom of sound economy in the foreign\r\nservice, as in other branches of the Government, I can not escape the\r\nconclusion that in some instances the withholding of appropriations will\r\nprove an expensive economy, and that the small retrenchment secured by a\r\nchange of grade in certain diplomatic posts is not an adequate\r\nconsideration for the loss of influence and importance which will attend\r\nour foreign representatives under this reduction. I am of the opinion that\r\na reexamination of the subject will cause a change in some instances in the\r\nconclusions reached on these subjects at the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, whose functions were\r\ncontinued by an act of the last session of Congress until the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, 1877, has carried on its labors with diligence and general\r\nsatisfaction. By a report from the clerk of the court, transmitted\r\nherewith, bearing date November 14, 1876, it appears that within the time\r\nnow allowed by law the court will have disposed of all the claims presented\r\nfor adjudication. This report also contains a statement of the general\r\nresults of the labors of the court to the date thereof. It is a cause of\r\nsatisfaction that the method adopted for the satisfaction of the classes of\r\nclaims submitted to the court, which are of long standing and justly\r\nentitled to early consideration, should have proved successful and\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction that I am enabled to state that the work of the\r\njoint commission for determining the boundary line between the United\r\nStates and British possessions from the northwest angle of the Lake of the\r\nWoods to the Rocky Mountains, commenced in 1872, has been completed. The\r\nfinal agreements of the commissioners, with the maps, have been duly\r\nsigned, and the work of the commission is complete.\r\n\r\nThe fixing of the boundary upon the Pacific coast by the protocol of March\r\n10, 1873, pursuant to the award of the Emperor of Germany by Article XXXIV\r\nof the treaty of Washington, with the termination of the work of this\r\ncommission, adjusts and fixes the entire boundary between the United States\r\nand the British possessions, except as to the portion of territory ceded by\r\nRussia to the United States under the treaty of 1867. The work intrusted to\r\nthe commissioner and the officers of the Army attached to the commission\r\nhas been well and satisfactorily performed. The original of the final\r\nagreement of the commissioners, signed upon the 29th of May, 1876, with the\r\noriginal official \"lists of astronomical stations observed,\" the original\r\nofficial \"list of monuments marking the international boundary line,\" and\r\nthe maps, records, and general reports relating to the commission, have\r\nbeen deposited in the Department of State. The official report of the\r\ncommissioner on the part of the United States, with the report of the chief\r\nastronomer of the United States, will be submitted to Congress within a\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nI reserve for a separate communication to Congress a statement of the\r\ncondition of the questions which lately arose with Great Britain respecting\r\nthe surrender of fugitive criminals under the treaty of 1842.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Government gave notice, under date of January 15, 1874, of its\r\ndesire to terminate the treaty of 1862, concerning commerce and navigation,\r\npursuant to the provisions of the twenty-second article thereof. Under this\r\nnotice the treaty terminated upon the 5th day of June, 1876. That\r\nGovernment has invited negotiations toward the conclusion of a new treaty.\r\n\r\nBy the act of Congress of March 23, 1874, the President was authorized,\r\nwhen he should receive satisfactory information that the Ottoman Government\r\nor that of Egypt had organized new tribunals likely to secure to citizens\r\nof the United States the same impartial justice enjoyed under the exercise\r\nof judicial functions by diplomatic and consular officers of the United\r\nStates, to suspend the operation of the act of June 22, 1860, and to accept\r\nfor citizens of the United States the jurisdiction of the new tribunals.\r\nSatisfactory information having been received of the organization of such\r\nnew tribunals in Egypt, I caused a proclamation to be issued upon the 27th\r\nof March last, suspending the operation of the act of June 22, 1860, in\r\nEgypt, according to the provisions of the act. A copy of the proclamation\r\naccompanies this message. The United States has united with the other\r\npowers in the organization of these courts. It is hoped that the\r\njurisdictional questions which have arisen may be readily adjusted, and\r\nthat this advance in judicial reform may be hindered by no obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe necessary legislation to carry into effect the convention respecting\r\ncommercial reciprocity concluded with the Hawaiian Islands in 1875 having\r\nbeen had, the proclamation to carry into effect the convention, as provided\r\nby the act approved August 15, 1876, was duly issued upon the 9th day of\r\nSeptember last. A copy thereof accompanies this message.\r\n\r\nThe commotions which have been prevalent in Mexico for some time past, and\r\nwhich, unhappily, seem to be not yet wholly quieted, have led to complaints\r\nof citizens of the United States of injuries by persons in authority. It is\r\nhoped, however, that these will ultimately be adjusted to the satisfaction\r\nof both Governments. The frontier of the United States in that quarter has\r\nnot been exempt from acts of violence by citizens of one Republic on those\r\nof the other. The frequency of these is supposed to be increased and their\r\nadjustment made more difficult by the considerable changes in the course of\r\nthe lower part of the Rio Grande River, which river is a part of the\r\nboundary between the two countries. These changes have placed on either\r\nside of that river portions of land which by existing conventions belong to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Government on the opposite side of the river. The\r\nsubject of adjustment of this cause of difficulty is under consideration\r\nbetween the two Republics.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States of Colombia has paid the award in the\r\ncase of the steamer Montijo, seized by authorities of that Government some\r\nyears since, and the amount has been transferred to the claimants.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction that I am able to announce that the joint\r\ncommission for the adjustment of claims between the United States and\r\nMexico under the convention of 1868, the duration of which has been several\r\ntimes extended, has brought its labors to a close. From the report of the\r\nagent of the United States, which accompanies the papers transmitted\r\nherewith, it will be seen that within the time limited by the commission\r\n1,017 claims on the part of citizens of the United States against Mexico\r\nwere referred to the commission. Of these claims 831 were dismissed or\r\ndisallowed, and in 186 cases awards were made in favor of the claimants\r\nagainst the Mexican Republic, amounting in the aggregate to $4,125,622.20.\r\nWithin the same period 998 claims on the part of citizens of the Mexican\r\nRepublic against the United States were referred to the commission. Of\r\nthese claims 831 were dismissed or disallowed, and in 167 cases awards were\r\nmade in favor of the claimants against the United States, amounting in the\r\naggregate to $150,498.41.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the convention the amount of these awards is to be deducted\r\nfrom the amount awarded in favor of our citizens against Mexico, and the\r\nbalance only to be paid by Mexico to the United States, leaving the United\r\nStates to make provision for this proportion of the awards in favor of its\r\nOwn citizens.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the legislation which will be necessary to\r\nprovide for the payment.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I am pleased to be able to express the acknowledgments\r\ndue to Sir Edward Thornton, the umpire of the commission, who has given to\r\nthe consideration of the large number of claims submitted to him much time,\r\nunwearied patience, and that firmness and intelligence which are well known\r\nto belong to the accomplished representative of Great Britain, and which\r\nare likewise recognized by the representative in this country of the\r\nRepublic of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMonthly payments of a very small part of the amount due by the Government\r\nof Venezuela to citizens of the United States on account of claims of the\r\nlatter against that Government continue to be made with reasonable\r\npunctuality. That Government has proposed to change the system which it has\r\nhitherto pursued in this respect by issuing bonds for part of the amount of\r\nthe several claims. The proposition, however, could not, it is supposed,\r\nproperly be accepted, at least without the consent of the holders of\r\ncertificates of the indebtedness of Venezuela. These are so much dispersed\r\nthat it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain their\r\ndisposition on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn former messages I have called the attention of Congress to the necessity\r\nof legislation with regard to fraudulent naturalization and to the subject\r\nof expatriation and the election of nationality.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of persons of foreign birth seeking a home in the United\r\nStates, the ease and facility with which the honest emigrant may, after the\r\nlapse of a reasonable time, become possessed of all the privileges of\r\ncitizenship of the United States, and the frequent occasions which induce\r\nsuch adopted citizens to return to the country of their birth render the\r\nsubject of naturalization and the safeguards which experience has proved\r\nnecessary for the protection of the honest naturalized citizen of paramount\r\nimportance. The very simplicity in the requirements of law on this question\r\naffords opportunity for fraud, and the want of uniformity in the\r\nproceedings and records of the various courts and in the forms of the\r\ncertificates of naturalization issued affords a constant source of\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nI suggest no additional requirements to the acquisition of citizenship\r\nbeyond those now existing, but I invite the earnest attention of Congress\r\nto the necessity and wisdom of some provisions regarding uniformity in the\r\nrecords and certificates, and providing against the frauds which frequently\r\ntake place and for the vacating of a record of naturalization obtained in\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\nThese provisions are needed in aid and for the protection of the honest\r\ncitizen of foreign birth, and for the want of which he is made to suffer\r\nnot infrequently. The United States has insisted upon the right of\r\nexpatriation, and has obtained, after a long struggle, an admission of the\r\nprinciple contended for by acquiescence therein on the part of many foreign\r\npowers and by the conclusion of treaties on that subject. It is, however,\r\nbut justice to the government to which such naturalized citizens have\r\nformerly owed allegiance, as well as to the United States, that certain\r\nfixed and definite rules should be adopted governing such cases and\r\nproviding how expatriation may be accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhile emigrants in large numbers become citizens of the United States, it\r\nis also true that persons, both native born and naturalized, once citizens\r\nof the United States, either by formal acts or as the effect of a series of\r\nfacts and circumstances, abandon their citizenship and cease to be entitled\r\nto the protection of the United States, but continue on convenient\r\noccasions to assert a claim to protection in the absence of provisions on\r\nthese questions.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connection I again invite your attention to the necessity of\r\nlegislation concerning the marriages of American citizens contracted\r\nabroad, and concerning the status of American women who may marry\r\nforeigners and of children born of American parents in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nThe delicate and complicated questions continually occurring with reference\r\nto naturalization, expatriation, and the status of such persons as I have\r\nabove referred to induce me to earnestly direct your attention again to\r\nthese subjects.\r\n\r\nIn like manner I repeat my recommendation that some means be provided for\r\nthe hearing and determination of the just and subsisting claims of aliens\r\nupon the Government of the United States within a reasonable limitation,\r\nand of such as may hereafter arise. While by existing provisions of law the\r\nCourt of Claims may in certain cases be resorted to by an alien claimant,\r\nthe absence of any general provisions governing all such cases and the want\r\nof a tribunal skilled in the disposition of such cases upon recognized\r\nfixed and settled principles, either provides no remedy in many deserving\r\ncases or compels a consideration of such claims by Congress or the\r\nexecutive department of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that other governments are in advance of the United States\r\nupon this question, and that the practice now adopted is entirely\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nCongress, by an act approved the 3d day of March, 1875, authorized the\r\ninhabitants of the Territory of Colorado to form a State government, with\r\nthe name of the State of Colorado, and therein provided for the admission\r\nof said State, when formed, into the Union upon an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States.\r\n\r\nA constitution having been adopted and ratified by the people of that\r\nState, and the acting governor having certified to me the facts as provided\r\nby said act, together with a copy of such constitution and ordinances as\r\nprovided for in the said act, and the provisions of the said act of\r\nCongress having been duly complied with, I issued a proclamation upon the\r\n1st of August, 1876, a copy of which is hereto annexed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been actively\r\nemployed during the year in subduing, at the request of the Indian Bureau,\r\ncertain wild bands of the Sioux Indian Nation and in preserving the peace\r\nat the South during the election. The commission constituted under the act\r\nof July 24, 1876, to consider and report on the \"whole subject of the\r\nreform and reorganization of the Army\" met in August last, and has\r\ncollected a large mass of statistics and opinions bearing on the subject\r\nbefore it. These are now under consideration, and their report is\r\nprogressing. I am advised, though, by the president of the commission that\r\nit will be impracticable to comply with the clause of the act requiring the\r\nreport to be presented, through me, to Congress on the first day of this\r\nsession, as there has not yet been time for that mature deliberation which\r\nthe importance of the subject demands. Therefore I ask that the time of\r\nmaking the report be extended to the 29th day of January, 1877.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the resolution of August 15, 1876, the Army regulations\r\nprepared under the act of March 1, 1875, have not been promulgated, but are\r\nheld until after the report of the above-mentioned commission shall have\r\nbeen received and acted on.\r\n\r\nBy the act of August 15, 1876, the cavalry force of the Army was increased\r\nby 2,500 men, with the proviso that they should be discharged on the\r\nexpiration of hostilities. Under this authority the cavalry regiments have\r\nbeen strengthened, and a portion of them are now in the field pursuing the\r\nremnants of the Indians with whom they have been engaged during the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the War Department are made up on the basis of the number\r\nof men authorized by law, and their requirements as shown by years of\r\nexperience, and also with the purpose on the part of the bureau officers to\r\nprovide for all contingencies that may arise during the time for which the\r\nestimates are made. Exclusive of engineer estimates (presented in\r\naccordance with acts of Congress calling for surveys and estimates for\r\nimprovements at various localities), the estimates now presented are about\r\nsix millions in excess of the appropriations for the years 1874-75 and\r\n1875-76. This increase is asked in order to provide for the increased\r\ncavalry force (should their services be necessary), to prosecute\r\neconomically work upon important public buildings, to provide for armament\r\nof fortifications and manufacture of small arms, and to replenish the\r\nworking stock in the supply departments. The appropriations for these last\r\nnamed have for the past few years been so limited that the accumulations in\r\nstore will be entirely exhausted during the present year, and it will be\r\nnecessary to at once begin to replenish them.\r\n\r\nI invite your special attention to the following recommendations of the\r\nSecretary of War:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the claims under the act of July 4, 1864, for supplies taken by\r\nthe Army during the war be removed from the offices of the Quartermaster\r\nand Commissary Generals and transferred to the Southern Claims Commission.\r\nThese claims are of precisely similar nature to those now before the\r\nSouthern Claims Commission, and the War Department bureaus have not the\r\nclerical force for their examination nor proper machinery for investigating\r\nthe loyalty of the claimants.\r\n\r\nSecond. That Congress sanction the scheme of an annuity fund for the\r\nbenefit of the families of deceased officers, and that it also provide for\r\nthe permanent organization of the Signal Service, both of which were\r\nrecommended in my last annual message.\r\n\r\nThird. That the manufacturing operations of the Ordnance Department be\r\nconcentrated at three arsenals and an armory, and that the remaining\r\narsenals be sold and the proceeds applied to this object by the Ordnance\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations for river and harbor improvements for the current year\r\nwere $5,015,000. With my approval, the Secretary of War directed that of\r\nthis amount $2,000,000 should be expended, and no new works should be begun\r\nand none prosecuted which were not of national importance. Subsequently\r\nthis amount was increased to $2,237,600, and the works are now progressing\r\non this basis.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under James B.\r\nEads and his associates, is progressing favorably. At the present time\r\nthere is a channel of 20.3 feet in depth between the jetties at the mouth\r\nof the pass and 18.5 feet at the head of the pass. Neither channel,\r\nhowever, has the width required before payments can be made by the United\r\nStates. A commission of engineer officers is now examining these works, and\r\ntheir reports will be presented as soon as received.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that branch of the service to\r\nbe in condition as effective as it is possible to keep it with the means\r\nand authority given the Department. It is, of course, not possible to rival\r\nthe costly and progressive establishments of great European powers with the\r\nold material of our Navy, to which no increase has been authorized since\r\nthe war, except the eight small cruisers built to supply the place of\r\nothers which had gone to decay. Yet the most has been done that was\r\npossible with the means at command; and by substantially rebuilding some of\r\nour old ships with durable material and completely repairing and refitting\r\nour monitor fleet the Navy has been gradually so brought up that, though it\r\ndoes not maintain its relative position among the progressive navies of the\r\nworld, it is now in a condition more powerful and effective than it ever\r\nhas been in time of peace.\r\n\r\nThe complete repairs of our five heavy ironclads are only delayed on\r\naccount of the inadequacy of the appropriations made last year for the\r\nworking bureaus of the Department, which were actually less in amount than\r\nthose made before the war, notwithstanding the greatly enhanced price of\r\nlabor and materials and the increase in the cost of the naval service\r\ngrowing out of the universal use and great expense of steam machinery. The\r\nmoney necessary for these repairs should be provided at once, that they may\r\nbe completed without further unnecessary delay and expense.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, all the strength that there is in our Navy will be\r\ndeveloped and useful to its full capacity, and it will be powerful for\r\npurposes of defense, and also for offensive action, should the necessity\r\nfor that arise within a reasonable distance from our shores.\r\n\r\nThe fact that our Navy is not more modern and powerful than it is has been\r\nmade a cause of complaint against the Secretary of the Navy by persons who\r\nat the same time criticise and complain of his endeavors to bring the Navy\r\nthat we have to its best and most efficient condition; but the good sense\r\nof the country will understand that it is really due to his practical\r\naction that we have at this time any effective naval force at command.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows the excess of expenditures\r\n(excluding expenditures on account of previous years) over receipts for the\r\nfiscal year ended June 30, 1876, to be $4,151,988.66.\r\n\r\nEstimated expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, are\r\n$36,723,432.43.\r\n\r\nEstimated revenue for same period is $30,645,165, leaving estimated excess\r\nof expenditure, to be appropriated as a deficiency, of $6,078,267.43.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General, like his predecessor, is convinced that a change in\r\nthe basis of adjusting the salaries of postmasters of the fourth class is\r\nnecessary for the good of the service as well as for the interests of the\r\nGovernment, and urgently recommends that the compensation of the class of\r\npostmasters above mentioned be based upon the business of their respective\r\noffices, as ascertained from the sworn returns to the Auditor of stamps\r\ncanceled.\r\n\r\nA few postmasters in the Southern States have expressed great apprehension\r\nof their personal safety on account of their connection with the postal\r\nservice, and have specially requested that their reports of apprehended\r\ndanger should not be made public lest it should result in the loss of their\r\nlives. But no positive testimony of interference has been submitted, except\r\nin the case of a mail messenger at Spartanburg, in South Carolina, who\r\nreported that he had been violently driven away while in charge of the\r\nmails on account of his political affiliations. An assistant superintendent\r\nof the Railway Mail Service investigated this case and reported that the\r\nmessenger had disappeared from his post, leaving his work to be performed\r\nby a substitute. The Postmaster-General thinks this case is sufficiently\r\nsuggestive to justify him in recommending that a more severe punishment\r\nshould be provided for the offense of assaulting any person in charge of\r\nthe mails or of retarding or otherwise obstructing them by threats of\r\npersonal injury.\r\n\r\n\"A very gratifying result is presented in the fact that the deficiency of\r\nthis Department during the last fiscal year was reduced to $4,081,790.18,\r\nas against $6,169,938.88 of the preceding year. The difference can be\r\ntraced to the large increase in its ordinary receipts (which greatly exceed\r\nthe estimates therefor) and a slight decrease in its expenditures.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary receipts of the Post-Office Department for the past seven\r\nfiscal years have increased at an average of over 8 per cent per annum,\r\nwhile the increase of expenditures for the same period has been but about\r\n5.50 per cent per annum, and the decrease of deficiency in the revenues has\r\nbeen at the rate of nearly 2 per cent per annum.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture accompanying this message\r\nwill be found one of great interest, marking, as it does, the great\r\nprogress of the last century in the variety of products of the soil;\r\nincreased knowledge and skill in the labor of producing, saving, and\r\nmanipulating the same to prepare them for the use of man; in the\r\nimprovements in machinery to aid the agriculturist in his labors, and in a\r\nknowledge of those scientific subjects necessary to a thorough system of\r\neconomy in agricultural production, namely, chemistry, botany, entomology,\r\netc. A study of this report by those interested in agriculture and deriving\r\ntheir support from it will find it of value in pointing out those articles\r\nwhich are raised in greater quantity than the needs of the world require,\r\nand must sell, therefore, for less than the cost of production, and those\r\nwhich command a profit over cost of production because there is not an\r\noverproduction.\r\n\r\nI call special attention to the need of the Department for a new gallery\r\nfor the reception of the exhibits returned from the Centennial Exhibition,\r\nincluding the exhibits donated by very many foreign nations, and to the\r\nrecommendations of the Commissioner of Agriculture generally.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the District Commissioners and the board of health are just\r\nreceived--too late to read them and to make recommendations thereon--and\r\nare herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nThe international exhibition held in Philadelphia this year, in\r\ncommemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of American independence,\r\nhas proven a great success, and will, no doubt, be of enduring advantage to\r\nthe country. It has shown the great progress in the arts, sciences, and\r\nmechanical skill made in a single century, and demonstrated that we are but\r\nlittle behind older nations in any one branch, while in some we scarcely\r\nhave a rival. It has served, too, not only to bring peoples and products of\r\nskill and labor from all parts of the world together, but in bringing\r\ntogether people from all sections of our own country, which must prove a\r\ngreat benefit in the information imparted and pride of country engendered.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by scientists interested in and connected with the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, in a communication herewith, that the Government\r\nexhibit be removed to the capital and a suitable building be erected or\r\npurchased for its accommodation as a permanent exhibit. I earnestly\r\nrecommend this; and believing that Congress would second this view, I\r\ndirected that all Government exhibits at the Centennial Exhibition should\r\nremain where they are, except such as might be injured by remaining in a\r\nbuilding not intended as a protection in inclement weather, or such as may\r\nbe wanted by the Department furnishing them, until the question of\r\npermanent exhibition is acted on.\r\n\r\nAlthough the moneys appropriated by Congress to enable the participation of\r\nthe several Executive Departments in the International Exhibition of 1876\r\nwere not sufficient to carry out the undertaking to the full extent at\r\nfirst contemplated, it gives me pleasure to refer to the very efficient and\r\ncreditable manner in which the board appointed from these several\r\nDepartments to provide an exhibition on the part of the Government have\r\ndischarged their duties with the funds placed at their command. Without a\r\nprecedent to guide them in the preparation of such a display, the success\r\nof their labors was amply attested by the sustained attention which the\r\ncontents of the Government building attracted during the period of the\r\nexhibition from both foreign and native visitors.\r\n\r\nI am strongly impressed with the value of the collection made by the\r\nGovernment for the purposes of the exhibition, illustrating, as it does,\r\nthe mineral resources of the country, the statistical and practical\r\nevidences of our growth as a nation, and the uses of the mechanical arts\r\nand the applications of applied science in the administration of the\r\naffairs of Government.\r\n\r\nMany nations have voluntarily contributed their exhibits to the United\r\nStates to increase the interest in any permanent exhibition Congress may\r\nprovide for. For this act of generosity they should receive the thanks of\r\nthe people, and I respectfully suggest that a resolution of Congress to\r\nthat effect be adopted.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress can not be too earnestly called to the necessity\r\nof throwing some greater safeguard over the method of choosing and\r\ndeclaring the election of a President. Under the present system there seems\r\nto be no provided remedy for contesting the election in any one State. The\r\nremedy is partially, no doubt, in the enlightenment of electors. The\r\ncompulsory support of the free school and the disfranchisement of all who\r\ncan not read and write the English language, after a fixed probation, would\r\nmeet my hearty approval. I would not make this apply, however, to those\r\nalready voters, but I would to all becoming so after the expiration of the\r\nprobation fixed upon. Foreigners coming to this country to become citizens,\r\nwho are educated in their own language, should acquire the requisite\r\nknowledge of ours during the necessary residence to obtain naturalization.\r\nIf they did not take interest enough in our language to acquire sufficient\r\nknowledge of it to enable them to study the institutions and laws of the\r\ncountry intelligently, I would not confer upon them the right to make such\r\nlaws nor to select those who do.\r\n\r\nI append to this message, for convenient reference, a synopsis of\r\nadministrative events and of all recommendations to Congress made by me\r\nduring the last seven years. Time may show some of these recommendations\r\nnot to have been wisely conceived, but I believe the larger part will do no\r\ndiscredit to the Administration. One of these recommendations met with the\r\nunited opposition of one political party in the Senate and with a strong\r\nopposition from the other, namely, the treaty for the annexation of Santo\r\nDomingo to the United States, to which I will specially refer, maintaining,\r\nas I do, that if my views had been concurred in the country would be in a\r\nmore prosperous condition to-day, both politically and financially.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo is fertile, and upon its soil may be grown just those\r\ntropical products of which the United States use so much, and which are\r\nproduced or prepared for market now by slave labor almost exclusively,\r\nnamely, sugar, coffee, dyewoods, mahogany, tropical fruits, tobacco, etc.\r\nAbout 75 per cent of the exports of Cuba are consumed in the United States.\r\nA large percentage of the exports of Brazil also find the same market.\r\nThese are paid for almost exclusively in coin, legislation, particularly in\r\nCuba, being unfavorable to a mutual exchange of the products of each\r\ncountry. Flour shipped from the Mississippi River to Havana can pass by the\r\nvery entrance to the city on its way to a port in Spain, there pay a duty\r\nfixed upon articles to be reexported, transferred to a Spanish vessel and\r\nbrought back almost to the point of starting, paying a second duty, and\r\nstill leave a profit over what would be received by direct shipment. All\r\nthat is produced in Cuba could be produced in Santo Domingo. Being a part\r\nof the United States, commerce between the island and mainland would be\r\nfree. There would be no export duties on her shipments nor import duties on\r\nthose coming here. There would be no import duties upon the supplies,\r\nmachinery, etc., going from the States. The effect that would have been\r\nproduced upon Cuban commerce, with these advantages to a rival, is\r\nobservable at a glance. The Cuban question would have been settled long ago\r\nin favor of \"free Cuba.\" Hundreds of American vessels would now be\r\nadvantageously used in transporting the valuable woods and other products\r\nof the soil of the island to a market and in carrying supplies and\r\nemigrants to it. The island is but sparsely settled, while it has an area\r\nsufficient for the profitable employment of several millions of people. The\r\nsoil would have soon fallen into the hands of United States capitalists.\r\nThe products are so valuable in commerce that emigration there would have\r\nbeen encouraged; the emancipated race of the South would have found there a\r\ncongenial home, where their civil rights would not be disputed and where\r\ntheir labor would be so much sought after that the poorest among them could\r\nhave found the means to go. Thus in cases of great oppression and cruelty,\r\nsuch as has been practiced upon them in many places within the last eleven\r\nyears, whole communities would have sought refuge in Santo Domingo. I do\r\nnot suppose the whole race would have gone, nor is it desirable that they\r\nshould go. Their labor is desirable--indispensable almost--where they now\r\nare. But the possession of this territory would have left the negro \"master\r\nof the situation,\" by enabling him to demand his rights at home on pain of\r\nfinding them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI do not present these views now as a recommendation for a renewal of the\r\nsubject of annexation, but I do refer to it to vindicate my previous action\r\nin regard to it.\r\n\r\nWith the present term of Congress my official life terminates. It is not\r\nprobable that public affairs will ever again receive attention from me\r\nfurther than as a citizen of the Republic, always taking a deep interest in\r\nthe honor, integrity, and prosperity of the whole land.\r\n\r\nU.
