Houghton & Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo generations ago the average American biographer was certainly a\r\nmarvel of turgid and aimless verbosity; and the reputations of our early\r\nstatesmen have in no way proved their vitality more clearly than by\r\nsurviving their entombment in the pages of the authors who immediately\r\nsucceeded them. No one of the founders of the Constitution has suffered\r\nmore in this respect than has he who was perhaps the most brilliant,\r\nalthough by no means the greatest, of the whole number,--Gouverneur\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\nJared Sparks, hitherto Morris's sole biographer, wrote innumerable\r\nvolumes on American history, many of which are still very valuable, and\r\nsome of them almost indispensable, to the student. The value, however,\r\ncomes wholly from the matter; Mr. Sparks is not only a very voluminous\r\nwriter, but he is also a quite abnormally dull one. His \"Life of\r\nGouverneur Morris\" is typical of most of his work. He collected with\r\ngreat industry facts about Mr. Morris, and edited a large number of his\r\nletters and state papers, with numerous selections, not always well\r\nchosen, from his Diary. Other merits the book has none, and it has one\r\nor two marked faults. He failed to understand that a biographer's duties\r\nare not necessarily identical with those of a professional eulogist; but\r\nfor this he is hardly to blame, as all our writers then seemed to think\r\nit necessary to shower indiscriminate praise on every dead\r\nAmerican--whether author, soldier, politician, or what not--save only\r\nBenedict Arnold. He was funnily unconscious of his own prolix dullness;\r\nand actually makes profuse apologies for introducing extracts from\r\nMorris's bright, interesting writings into his own drearily\r\nplatitudinous pages, hoping that \"candor and justice\" will make his\r\nreaders pardon the \"negligence\" and \"defects of style,\" which the\r\nextracts contain. He could not resist the temptation now and then to\r\nimprove Morris's English, and to soften down, or omit anything that he\r\ndeemed either improper or beneath the stilted \"dignity\" of history. For\r\nexample, Morris states that Marie Antoinette, when pursued by the\r\nParisian fishwives, fled from her bed \"in her shift and petticoat, with\r\nher stockings in her hand;\" such particularity struck Mr. Sparks as\r\nshockingly coarse, and with much refinement he replaced the whole phrase\r\nby \"in her undress.\" An oath he would not permit to sully his pages on\r\nany terms; thus when Morris wrote that Pennsylvania would find Sir Henry\r\nClinton \"a most damnable physician,\" Mr. Sparks simply left out the\r\noffending sentence altogether. This kind of thing he did again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nStill he gives almost all of Morris's writings that are of political\r\ninterest. It is, however, greatly to be desired that we should have a\r\nmuch more complete edition of his letters and Diary, on account of the\r\nextremely interesting descriptions they contain of the social life of\r\nthe period, both in America and in Europe. As regards his public career,\r\nand his views and writings on public subjects, we already have ample\r\nmaterial, much of which has appeared since Sparks's biography was\r\nwritten, and some of which is here presented for the first time.\r\n\r\nMorris's speeches in the Constitutional Convention have been preserved,\r\nin summarized form, by Madison in his \"Debates:\" of these, of course,\r\nSparks was necessarily ignorant. Miss Annie Carey Morris has written two\r\narticles in \"Scribner's Magazine\" for January and February, 1887, on her\r\ngrandfather's life in Paris during the French Revolution, giving some\r\nnew and interesting details. A good article appeared in \"Macmillan's\r\nMagazine\" for November, 1885, the writer evidently having been attracted\r\nto the subject by the way in which Taine made Morris's writings a basis\r\nfor so much of his own great work on the Revolution. Decidedly the best\r\npiece upon Morris that has yet been written, however, is the admirable\r\nsketch by Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" for April,\r\n1886.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are especially due the Hon. John Jay for furnishing me many\r\nvaluable letters, hitherto unpublished, of both Jay and Morris; and for\r\ngiving me additional information about Morris's private life, and other\r\nmatters. All the letters here quoted that are not given by Sparks are to\r\nbe found either in the Jay MSS. or the Pickering MSS. Mr. Jay also\r\nfurnished me with the account of the way in which Louis Philippe was\r\nfinally persuaded to pay the debt he owed Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n                                                            PAGE\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                v\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  HIS YOUTH: COLONIAL NEW YORK                                1\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE OUTBREAK OF THE REVOLUTION: MORRIS IN\r\n  THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS                                    28\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  INDEPENDENCE: FORMING THE STATE CONSTITUTION               53\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  IN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS                                76\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  FINANCES: THE TREATY OF PEACE                              99\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  THE FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION                125\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  FIRST STAY IN FRANCE                                      169\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  LIFE IN PARIS                                             197\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  MISSION TO ENGLAND: RETURN TO PARIS                       227\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  MINISTER TO FRANCE                                        252\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  STAY IN EUROPE                                            300\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE                       320\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  THE NORTHERN DISUNION MOVEMENT AMONG THE\r\n  FEDERALISTS                                               347\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nHIS YOUTH: COLONIAL NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, on January 31, 1752, Gouverneur Morris was born in the family\r\nmanor-house at Morrisania, on the lands where his forefathers had dwelt\r\nfor three generations, New York colony contained only some eighty\r\nthousand inhabitants, of whom twelve thousand were blacks. New York city\r\nwas a thriving little trading town, whose people in summer suffered much\r\nfrom the mosquitoes that came back with the cows when they were driven\r\nhome at nightfall for milking; while from among the locusts and\r\nwater-beeches that lined the pleasant, quiet streets, the tree frogs\r\nsang so shrilly through the long, hot evenings that a man in speaking\r\ncould hardly make himself heard.\r\n\r\nGouverneur Morris belonged by birth to that powerful landed aristocracy\r\nwhose rule was known by New York alone among all the northern colonies.\r\nHis great-grandfather, who had served in the Cromwellian armies, came to\r\nthe seaport at the mouth of the Hudson, while it was still beneath the\r\nsway of Holland, and settled outside of Haerlem, the estate being\r\ninvested with manorial privileges by the original grant of the governor.\r\nIn the next two generations the Morrises had played a prominent part in\r\ncolonial affairs, both the father and grandfather of Gouverneur having\r\nbeen on the bench, and having also been members of the provincial\r\nlegislature, where they took the popular side, and stood up stoutly for\r\nthe rights of the Assembly in the wearisome and interminable conflicts\r\nwaged by the latter against the prerogatives of the crown and the powers\r\nof the royal governors. The Morrises were restless, adventurous men, of\r\nerratic temper and strong intellect; and, with far more than his share\r\nof the family talent and brilliancy, young Gouverneur also inherited a\r\ncertain whimsical streak that ran through his character. His mother was\r\none of the Huguenot Gouverneurs, who had been settled in New York since\r\nthe revocation of the Edict of Nantes; and it was perhaps the French\r\nblood in his veins that gave him the alert vivacity and keen sense of\r\nhumor that distinguished him from most of the great Revolutionary\r\nstatesmen who were his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nHe was a bright, active boy, fond of shooting and out-door sports, and\r\nwas early put to school at the old Huguenot settlement of New Rochelle,\r\nwhere the church service was still sometimes held in French; and he\r\nthere learned to speak and write this language almost as well as he\r\ncould English. Thence, after the usual preparatory instruction, he went\r\nto King's College--now, with altered name and spirit, Columbia--in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe years of his childhood were stirring ones for the colonies; for\r\nEngland was then waging the greatest and most successful of her colonial\r\ncontests with France and Spain for the possession of eastern North\r\nAmerica. Such contests, with their usual savage accompaniments in the\r\nway of Indian warfare, always fell with especial weight on New York,\r\nwhose border lands were not only claimed, but even held by the French,\r\nand within whose boundaries lay the great confederacy of the Six\r\nNations, the most crafty, warlike, and formidable of all the native\r\nraces, infinitely more to be dreaded than the Algonquin tribes with whom\r\nthe other colonies had to deal. Nor was this war any exception to the\r\nrule; for battle after battle was fought on our soil, from the day when,\r\nunassisted, the purely colonial troops of New York and New England at\r\nLake George destroyed Baron Dieskau's mixed host of French regulars,\r\nCanadian militia, and Indian allies, to that still more bloody day when,\r\non the shores of Lake Champlain, Abercrombie's great army of British and\r\nAmericans recoiled before the fiery genius of Montcalm.\r\n\r\nWhen once the war was ended by the complete and final overthrow of the\r\nFrench power, and the definite establishment of English supremacy along\r\nthe whole Atlantic seaboard, the bickering which was always going on\r\nbetween Great Britain and her American subjects, and which was but\r\npartially suppressed even when they were forced to join in common\r\nefforts to destroy a common foe, broke out far more fiercely than ever.\r\nWhile the colonists were still reaping the aftermath of the contest in\r\nthe shape of desolating border warfare against those Indian tribes who\r\nhad joined in the famous conspiracy of Pontiac, the Royal Parliament\r\npassed the Stamp Act, and thereby began the struggle that ended in the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nEngland's treatment of her American subjects was thoroughly selfish; but\r\nthat her conduct towards them was a wonder of tyranny, will not now be\r\nseriously asserted; on the contrary, she stood decidedly above the\r\ngeneral European standard in such matters, and certainly treated her\r\ncolonies far better than France and Spain did theirs; and she herself\r\nhad undoubted grounds for complaint in, for example, the readiness of\r\nthe Americans to claim military help in time of danger, together with\r\ntheir frank reluctance to pay for it. It was impossible that she should\r\nbe so far in advance of the age as to treat her colonists as equals;\r\nthey themselves were sometimes quite as intolerant in their behavior\r\ntowards men of a different race, creed, or color. The New England\r\nPuritans lacked only the power, but not the will, to behave almost as\r\nbadly towards the Pennsylvania Quakers as did the Episcopalian English\r\ntowards themselves. Yet granting all this, the fact remains, that in the\r\nRevolutionary War the Americans stood towards the British as the\r\nProtestant peoples stood towards the Catholic powers in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as the Parliamentarians stood towards the Stewarts in the\r\nseventeenth, or as the upholders of the American Union stood towards the\r\nconfederate slave-holders in the nineteenth; that is, they warred\r\nvictoriously for the right in a struggle whose outcome vitally affected\r\nthe welfare of the whole human race. They settled, once for all, that\r\nthereafter the people of English stock should spread at will over the\r\nworld's waste spaces, keeping all their old liberties and winning new\r\nones; and they took the first and longest step in establishing the great\r\nprinciple that thenceforth those Europeans, who by their strength and\r\ndaring founded new states abroad, should be deemed to have done so for\r\ntheir own profit as freemen, and not for the benefit of their more\r\ntimid, lazy, or contented brethren who stayed behind.\r\n\r\nThe rulers of Great Britain, and to a large extent its people, looked\r\nupon the American colonies as existing primarily for the good of the\r\nmother country: they put the harshest restrictions on American trade in\r\nthe interests of British merchants; they discouraged the spread of the\r\nAmericans westward; and they claimed the right to decide for both\r\nparties the proportions in which they should pay their shares of the\r\ncommon burdens. The English and Americans were not the subjects of a\r\ncommon sovereign; for the English were themselves the sovereigns, the\r\nAmericans were the subjects. Whether their yoke bore heavily or bore\r\nlightly, whether it galled or not, mattered little; it was enough that\r\nit was a yoke to warrant a proud, free people in throwing it off. We\r\ncould not thankfully take as a boon part only of what we felt to be our\r\nlawful due. \"We do not claim liberty as a privilege, but challenge it as\r\na right,\" said the men of New York, through their legislature, in 1764;\r\nand all Americans felt with them.\r\n\r\nYet, for all this, the feeling of loyalty was strong and hard to\r\novercome throughout the provinces, and especially in New York. The\r\nAssembly wrangled with the royal governor; the merchants and shipmasters\r\ncombined to evade the intolerable harshness of the laws of trade that\r\ntried to make them customers of England only; the householders bitterly\r\nresented the attempts to quarter troops upon them; while the soldiers of\r\nthe garrison were from time to time involved in brawls with the lower\r\nranks of the people, especially the sailors, as the seafaring population\r\nwas large, and much given to forcibly releasing men taken by the\r\npress-gang for the British war-ships; but in spite of everything there\r\nwas a genuine sentiment of affection and respect for the British crown\r\nand kingdom. It is perfectly possible that if British statesmen had\r\nshown less crass and brutal stupidity, if they had shown even the wise\r\nnegligence of Walpole, this feeling of loyalty would have been strong\r\nenough to keep England and America united until they had learned how to\r\naccommodate themselves to the rapidly changing conditions; but the\r\nchance was lost when once a prince like George the Third came to the\r\nthrone. It has been the fashion to represent this king as a well\r\nmeaning, though dull person, whose good morals and excellent intentions\r\npartially atoned for his mistakes of judgment; but such a view is\r\ncuriously false. His private life, it is true, showed the very admirable\r\nbut common-place virtues, as well as the appalling intellectual\r\nlittleness, barrenness, and stagnation, of the average British\r\ngreen-grocer; but in his public career, instead of rising to the level\r\nof harmless and unimportant mediocrity usually reached by the sovereigns\r\nof the House of Hanover, he fairly rivaled the Stuarts in his perfidy,\r\nwrongheadedness, political debauchery, and attempts to destroy free\r\ngovernment, and to replace it by a system of personal despotism. It\r\nneeded all the successive blunders both of himself and of his Tory\r\nministers to reduce the loyal party in New York to a minority, by\r\ndriving the moderate men into the patriotic or American camp; and even\r\nthen the loyalist minority remained large enough to be a formidable\r\npower, and to plunge the embryonic state into a ferocious civil war,\r\ncarried on, as in the Carolinas and Georgia, with even more bitterness\r\nthan the contest against the British.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this loyalist party and the strength of the conflicting\r\nelements can only be understood after a glance at the many\r\nnationalities that in New York were being blended into one. The\r\ndescendants of the old Dutch inhabitants were still more numerous than\r\nthose of any other one race, while the French Huguenots, who, being of\r\nthe same Calvinistic faith, were closely mixed with them, and had been\r\nin the land nearly as long, were also plentiful; the Scotch and Scotch-\r\nor Anglo-Irish, mostly Presbyterians, came next in point of numbers; the\r\nEnglish, both of Old and New England, next; there were large bodies of\r\nGermans; and there were also settlements of Gaelic Highlanders, and some\r\nWelsh, Scandinavians, etc. Just prior to the Revolution there were in\r\nNew York city two Episcopalian churches, three Dutch Reformed, three\r\nPresbyterian (Scotch and Irish), one French, two German (one Lutheran\r\nand one Calvinistic, allied to the Dutch Reformed); as well as places of\r\nworship for the then insignificant religious bodies of the Methodists,\r\nBaptists (largely Welsh), Moravians (German), Quakers and Jews. There\r\nwas no Roman Catholic church until after the Revolution; in fact before\r\nthat date there were hardly any Roman Catholics in the colonies, except\r\nin Maryland and Pennsylvania, and in New York they did not acquire any\r\nstrength until after the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nThis mixture of races is very clearly shown by the ancestry of the\r\nhalf-dozen great men brought forth by New York during the Revolution. Of\r\nthese, one, Alexander Hamilton, stands in the very first class of\r\nAmerican statesmen; two more, John Jay and Gouverneur Morris, come close\r\nbehind him; the others, Philip Schuyler, Robert Livingston, and George\r\nClinton, were of lesser, but still of more than merely local, note. They\r\nwere all born and bred on this side of the Atlantic. Hamilton's father\r\nwas of Scotch, and his mother of French Huguenot, descent; Morris came\r\non one side of English, and on the other of French Huguenot, stock; Jay,\r\nof French Huguenot blood, had a mother who was Dutch; Schuyler was\r\npurely Dutch; Livingston was Scotch on his father's, and Dutch on his\r\nmother's, side; the Clintons were of Anglo-Irish origin, but married\r\ninto the old Dutch families. In the same way, it was Herkomer, of German\r\nparentage, who led the New York levies, and fell at their head in the\r\nbloody fight against the Tories and Indians at Oriskany; it was the\r\nIrishman Montgomery who died leading the New York troops against Quebec;\r\nwhile yet another of the few generals allotted to New York by the\r\nContinental Congress was MacDougall, of Gaelic Scotch descent. The\r\ncolony was already developing an ethnic type of its own, quite distinct\r\nfrom that of England. No American state of the present day, not even\r\nWisconsin or Minnesota, shows so many and important \"foreign,\" or\r\nnon-English elements, as New York, and for that matter Pennsylvania and\r\nDelaware, did a century or so ago. In fact, in New York the English\r\nelement in the blood has grown greatly during the past century, owing to\r\nthe enormous New England immigration that took place during its first\r\nhalf; and the only important addition to the race conglomerate has been\r\nmade by the Celtic Irish. The New England element in New York in 1775\r\nwas small and unimportant; on Long Island, where it was largest, it was\r\nmainly tory or neutral; in the city itself, however, it was aggressively\r\npatriotic.\r\n\r\nRecent English writers, and some of our own as well, have foretold woe\r\nto our nation, because the blood of the Cavalier and the Roundhead is\r\nbeing diluted with that of \"German boors and Irish cotters.\" The alarm\r\nis needless. As a matter of fact the majority of the people of the\r\nmiddle colonies at the time of the Revolution _were_ the descendants of\r\nDutch and German boors and Scotch and Irish cotters; and in a less\r\ndegree the same was true of Georgia and the Carolinas. Even in New\r\nEngland, where the English stock was purest, there was plenty of other\r\nadmixture, and two of her most distinguished Revolutionary families\r\nbore, one the Huguenot name of Bowdoin, and the other the Irish name of\r\nSullivan. Indeed, from the very outset, from the days of Cromwell, there\r\nhas been a large Irish admixture in New England. When our people began\r\ntheir existence as a nation, they already differed in blood from their\r\nancestral relatives across the Atlantic much as the latter did from\r\ntheir forebears beyond the German Ocean; and on the whole, the\r\nimmigration since has not materially changed the race strains in our\r\nnationality; a century back we were even less homogeneous than we are\r\nnow. It is no doubt true that we are in the main an offshoot of the\r\nEnglish stem; and cousins to our kinsfolk of Britain we perhaps may be;\r\nbut brothers we certainly are not.\r\n\r\nBut the process of assimilating, or as we should now say, of\r\nAmericanizing, all foreign and non-English elements was going on almost\r\nas rapidly a hundred years ago as it is at present. A young Dutchman or\r\nHuguenot felt it necessary, then, to learn English, precisely as a young\r\nScandinavian or German does now; and the churches of the former at the\r\nend of the last century were obliged to adopt English as the language\r\nfor their ritual exactly as the churches of the latter do at the end of\r\nthis. The most stirring, energetic, and progressive life of the colony\r\nwas English; and all the young fellows of push and ambition gradually\r\nadopted this as their native language, and then refused to belong to\r\ncongregations where the service was carried on in a less familiar\r\nspeech. Accordingly the Dutch Reformed churches dwindled steadily, while\r\nthe Episcopalian and Presbyterian swelled in the same ratio, until in\r\n1764 the former gained a new and lasting lease of life by reluctantly\r\nadopting the prevailing tongue; though Dutch was also occasionally used\r\nuntil forty years later.\r\n\r\nIn fact, during the century that elapsed between the final British\r\nconquest of the colony and the Revolution, the New Yorkers--Dutch,\r\nFrench, German, Irish, and English--had become in the main welded into\r\none people; they felt alike towards outsiders, having chronic quarrels\r\nwith the New England States as well as with Great Britain, and showing,\r\nindeed, but little more jealous hostility towards the latter than they\r\ndid towards Connecticut and New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThe religious differences no longer corresponded to the differences of\r\nlanguage. Half of the adherents of the Episcopalian Church were of Dutch\r\nor Huguenot blood; the leading ministers of the Dutch Church were of\r\nScotch parentage; and the Presbyterians included some of every race. The\r\ncolonists were all growing to call themselves Englishmen; when Mayor\r\nCruger, and a board of aldermen with names equally Dutch, signed the\r\nnon-importation agreement, they prefaced it by stating that they claimed\r\n\"their rights as Englishmen.\" But though there were no rivalries of\r\nrace, there were many and bitter of class and religion, the different\r\nProtestant sects hating one another with a virulence much surpassing\r\nthat with which they now regard even Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe colony was in government an aristocratic republic, its constitution\r\nmodeled on that of England and similar to it; the power lay in the hands\r\nof certain old and wealthy families, Dutch and English, and there was a\r\nlimited freehold suffrage. The great landed families, the Livingstons,\r\nVan Rennselaers, Schuylers, Van Cortlandts, Phillipses, Morrises, with\r\ntheir huge manorial estates, their riches, their absolute social\r\npreeminence and their unquestioned political headship, formed a proud,\r\npolished, and powerful aristocracy, deep rooted in the soil; for over a\r\ncentury their sway was unbroken, save by contests between themselves or\r\nwith the royal governor, and they furnished the colony with military,\r\npolitical, and social leaders for generation after generation. They\r\nowned numerous black slaves, and lived in state and comfort on their\r\nbroad acres, tenant-farmed, in the great, roomy manor-houses, with\r\nwainscoted walls and huge fireplaces, and round about the quaint old\r\ngardens, prim and formal with their box hedges and precise flower beds.\r\nThey answered closely to the whig lords of England, and indeed were\r\noften connected with the ruling orders abroad by blood or marriage; as\r\nan example, Staats Long Morris, Gouverneur's elder brother, who remained\r\na royalist, and rose to be a major-general in the British army, married\r\nthe Duchess of Gordon. Some of the manors were so large that they sent\r\nrepresentatives to the Albany legislature, to sit alongside of those\r\nfrom the towns and counties.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the great manorial lords came the rich merchants\r\nof New York; many families, like the Livingstons, the most prominent of\r\nall, had representatives in both classes. The merchants were somewhat of\r\nthe type of Frobisher, Hawkins, Klaesoon, and other old English and\r\nDutch sea-worthies, who were equally keen as fighters and traders. They\r\nwere shrewd, daring, and prosperous; they were often their own\r\nship-masters, and during the incessant wars against the French and\r\nSpaniards went into privateering ventures with even more zest and\r\nspirit than into peaceful trading. Next came the smaller landed\r\nproprietors, who also possessed considerable local influence; such was\r\nthe family of the Clintons. The law, too, was beginning to take high\r\nrank as an honorable and influential profession.\r\n\r\nMost of the gentry were Episcopalians, theirs being practically the\r\nstate church, and very influential and wealthy; some belonged to the\r\nCalvinistic bodies,--notably the Livingstons, who were in large part\r\nPresbyterians, while certain of their number were prominent members of\r\nthe Dutch congregations. It was from among the gentry that the little\r\ngroup of New York revolutionary leaders came; men of singular purity,\r\ncourage, and ability, who, if they could not quite rank with the\r\nbrilliant Virginians of that date, nevertheless stood close behind,\r\nalongside of the Massachusetts men and ahead of those from any other\r\ncolony; that, too, it must be kept in mind, at a time when New York was\r\ninferior in wealth and population to Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, or\r\nVirginia, and little, if at all, in advance of Maryland or Connecticut.\r\nThe great families also furnished the leaders of the loyalists during\r\nthe war; such were the De Lanceys, whose influence around the mouth of\r\nthe Hudson was second to that of none others; and the Johnsons, who, in\r\nmansions that were also castles, held half-feudal, half-barbaric sway\r\nover the valley of the upper Mohawk, where they were absolute rulers,\r\nready and willing to wage war on their own account, relying on their\r\nnumerous kinsmen, their armed negro slaves, their trained bands of\r\nGaelic retainers, and their hosts of savage allies, drawn from among the\r\ndreaded Iroquois.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the people were small farmers in the country, tradesmen and\r\nmechanics in the towns. They were for the most part members of some of\r\nthe Calvinistic churches, the great majority of the whole population\r\nbelonging to the Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed congregations. The\r\nfarmers were thrifty, set in their ways, and obstinate; the townsmen\r\nthrifty also, but restless and turbulent. Both farmers and townsmen were\r\nthoroughly independent and self-respecting, and were gradually getting\r\nmore and more political power. They had always stood tenaciously by\r\ntheir rights, from the days of the early Stuart governors, who had\r\ncomplained loudly of the \"Dutch Republicans.\" But they were narrow,\r\njealous of each other, as well as of outsiders, and slow to act\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe political struggles were very bitter. The great families, under\r\nwhose banners they were carried on, though all intermarried, were\r\ndivided by keen rivalries into opposing camps. Yet they joined in\r\ndreading too great an extension of democracy; and in return were\r\nsuspected by the masses, who grumblingly followed their lead, of\r\nhostility to the popular cause. The Episcopalians, though greatly in the\r\nminority, possessed most power, and harassed in every way they dared the\r\ndissenting sects, especially the Presbyterians--for the Dutch Reformed\r\nand Huguenot churches had certain rights guaranteed them by treaty. The\r\nEpiscopalian clergy were royalists to a man, and it was in their\r\ncongregations that the main strength of the Tories lay, although these\r\nalso contained many who became the stanchest of patriots. King's College\r\nwas controlled by trustees of this faith. They were busy trying to turn\r\nit into a diminutive imitation of Oxford, and did their best to make it,\r\nin its own small way, almost as much a perverse miracle of backward and\r\ninvariable wrong-headedness as was its great model. Its president, when\r\nthe Revolution broke out, was a real old wine-bibbing Tory parson,\r\ndevoted to every worn-out theory that inculcated humble obedience to\r\nchurch and crown; and he was most summarily expelled by the mob.\r\n\r\nSome important political consequences arose from the fact that the mass\r\nof the people belonged to some one or other of the branches of the\r\nCalvinistic faith--of all faiths the most republican in its tendencies.\r\nThey were strongly inclined to put their republican principles into\r\npractice as well in state as in church; they tended towards hostility to\r\nthe crown, and were strenuous in their opposition to the extension of\r\nthe Episcopal power, always threatened by some English statesmen; their\r\ncry was against \"the King and the Bishops.\" It is worth noting that the\r\nEpiscopalian churches were shut up when the Revolution broke out, and\r\nwere reopened when the British troops occupied the city. The Calvinistic\r\nchurches, on the contrary, which sided with the revolutionists, were\r\nshut when the British came into New York, were plundered by the troops,\r\nand were not reopened until after the evacuation.\r\n\r\nThus three parties developed, although the third, destined to overwhelm\r\nthe others, had not yet come to the front. The first consisted of the\r\nroyalists, or monarchists, the men who believed that power came from\r\nabove, from the king and the bishops, and who were aristocratic in their\r\nsympathies; who were Americans only secondarily, and who stood by their\r\norder against their country. This party contained many of the great\r\nmanorial families and also of the merchants; and in certain places, as\r\nin Staten Island, the east end of Long Island, the upper valley of the\r\nMohawk, and part of Westchester County, the influence of the upper\r\nclasses combined with the jealousy and ignorance of large sections of\r\nthe lower, to give it a clear majority of the whole population. The\r\nsecond party was headed by the great families of Whig or liberal\r\nsympathies, who, when the split came, stood by their country, although\r\nonly very moderate republicans; and it held also in its ranks the mass\r\nof moderate men, who wished freedom, were resolute in defense of their\r\nrights, and had republican leanings, but who also appreciated the good\r\nin the system under which they were living. Finally came the extremists,\r\nthe men of strong republican tendencies, whose delight it was to toast\r\nPym, Hampden, and the regicides. These were led by the agitators in the\r\ntowns, and were energetic and active, but were unable to effect anything\r\nuntil the blunders of the British ministers threw the moderate men over\r\nto their side. They furnished none of the greater revolutionary leaders\r\nin New York, though the Clintons came near the line that divided them\r\nfrom the second party.\r\n\r\nThe last political contest carried on under the crown occurred in 1768,\r\nthe year in which Morris graduated from college, when the last colonial\r\nlegislature was elected. It reminds us of our own days when we read of\r\nthe fears entertained of the solid German vote, and of the hostility to\r\nthe Irish, who were hated and sneered at as \"beggars\" by the English\r\nparty and the rich Episcopalians. The Irish of those days, however, were\r\nPresbyterians, and in blood more English than Gaelic. St. Patrick's Day\r\nwas celebrated then as now, by public processions, as well as otherwise;\r\nbut when, for instance, on March 17, 1766, the Irish residents of New\r\nYork celebrated the day by a dinner, they gave certain toasts that would\r\nsound strangely in the ears of Milesian patriots of the present time,\r\nfor they included \"The Protestant Interest,\" and \"King William, of\r\nglorious, pious, and immortal memory.\"\r\n\r\nThe royalist or conservative side in this contest in 1768 was led by the\r\nDe Lanceys, their main support being drawn from among the Episcopalians,\r\nand most of the larger merchants helping them. The Whigs, including\r\nthose with republican leanings, followed the Livingstons, and were drawn\r\nmainly from the Presbyterian and other Calvinistic congregations. The\r\nmoderate men on this occasion went with the De Lanceys, and gave them\r\nthe victory. In consequence the colonial legislature was conservative\r\nand loyal in tone, and anti-republican, although not ultra-tory, as a\r\nwhole; and thus when the revolutionary outbreak began it went much\r\nslower than was satisfactory to the patriot party, and its actions were\r\nfinally set aside by the people.\r\n\r\nWhen Morris graduated from college, as mentioned above, he was not yet\r\nseventeen years old. His college career was like that of any other\r\nbright, quick boy, without over much industry or a passion for learning.\r\nFor mathematics he possessed a genuine taste; he was particularly fond\r\nof Shakespeare; and even thus early he showed great skill in discussion\r\nand much power of argument. He made the oration, or graduating address,\r\nof his class, choosing for the subject \"Wit and Beauty;\" it was by no\r\nmeans a noteworthy effort, and was couched in the dreadful Johnsonian\r\nEnglish of the period. A little later, when he took his master's degree,\r\nhe again delivered an oration,--this time on \"Love.\" In point of style\r\nthis second speech was as bad as the first, disfigured by cumbrous\r\nLatinisms and a hopeless use of the superlative; but there were one or\r\ntwo good ideas in it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he graduated, he set to work to study law, deciding on this\r\nprofession at once as being best suited for an active, hopeful,\r\nambitious young man of his social standing and small fortune, who was\r\nperfectly self-confident and conscious of his own powers. He soon\r\nbecame interested in his studies, and followed them with great patience,\r\nworking hard and mastering both principles and details with ease. He was\r\nlicensed to practice as an attorney in 1771, just three years after\r\nanother young man, destined to stand as his equal in the list of New\r\nYork's four or five noted statesmen, John Jay, had likewise been\r\nadmitted to the bar; and among the very few cases in which Morris was\r\nengaged of which the record has been kept is one concerning a contested\r\nelection, in which he was pitted against Jay, and bore himself well.\r\n\r\nBefore this, and while not yet of age, he had already begun to play a\r\npart in public affairs. The colony had been run in debt during the\r\nFrench and Indian wars, and a bill was brought forward in the New York\r\nAssembly to provide for this by raising money through the issue of\r\ninterest-bearing bills of credit. The people, individually, were largely\r\nin debt, and hailed the proposal with much satisfaction, on the theory\r\nthat it would \"make money more plenty;\" our revolutionary forefathers\r\nbeing unfortunately not much wiser or more honest in their ways of\r\nlooking at the public finances than we ourselves, in spite of our state\r\nrepudiators, national greenbackers, and dishonest silver men.\r\n\r\nMorris attacked the bill very forcibly, and with good effect, opposing\r\nany issue of paper money, which could bring no absolute relief, but\r\nmerely a worse catastrophe of bankruptcy in the end; he pointed out that\r\nit was nothing but a mischievous pretense for putting off the date of a\r\npayment that would have to be met anyhow, and that ought rather to be\r\nmet at once with honest money gathered from the resources of the\r\nprovince. He showed the bad effects such a system of artificial credit\r\nwould have on private individuals, the farmers and tradesmen, by\r\nencouraging them to speculate and go deeper into debt; and he criticised\r\nunsparingly the attitude of the majority of his fellow-citizens in\r\nwishing such a measure of relief, not only for their short-sighted\r\nfolly, but also for their criminal and selfish dishonesty in trying to\r\nprocure a temporary benefit for themselves at the lasting expense of the\r\ncommunity; finally he strongly advised them to bear with patience small\r\nevils in the present rather than to remedy them by inflicting infinitely\r\ngreater ones on themselves and their descendants in the future.\r\n\r\nAt the law he did very well, having the advantages of his family name,\r\nand of his own fine personal appearance. He was utterly devoid of\r\nembarrassment, and his perfect self-assurance and freedom from any\r\ntimidity or sense of inferiority left his manner without the least\r\ntinge of awkwardness, and gave clear ground for his talents and ambition\r\nto make their mark.\r\n\r\nHowever, hardworking and devoted to his profession though he was, he had\r\nthe true family restlessness and craving for excitement, and soon after\r\nhe was admitted to the bar, he began to long for foreign travel, as was\r\nnatural enough in a young provincial gentleman of his breeding and\r\neducation. In a letter to an old friend (William Smith, a man of\r\nlearning, the historian of the colony, and afterwards its chief\r\njustice), in whose office he had studied law, he asks advice in the\r\nmatter, and gives as his reasons for wishing to make the trip the desire\r\n\"to form my manners and address by the example of the truly polite, to\r\nrub off in the gay circle a few of the many barbarisms which\r\ncharacterize a provincial education, and to curb the vain\r\nself-sufficiency which arises from comparing ourselves with companions\r\nwho are inferior to us.\" He then anticipates the objections that may be\r\nmade on the score of the temptations to which he will be exposed by\r\nsaying: \"If it be allowed that I have a _taste_ for pleasure, it may\r\nnaturally follow that I shall avoid those low pleasures which abound on\r\nthis as well as on the other side of the Atlantic. As for these\r\npoignant joys which are the lot of the affluent, like Tantalus I may\r\ngrasp at them, but they will certainly be out of my reach.\" In this last\r\nsentence he touches on his narrow means; and it was on this point that\r\nhis old preceptor harped in making his reply, cunningly instilling into\r\nhis mind the danger of neglecting his business, and bringing up the\r\nappalling example of an \"Uncle Robin,\" who, having made three pleasure\r\ntrips to England, \"began to figure with thirty thousand pounds, and did\r\nnot leave five thousand;\" going on \"What! '_Virtus post nummos_? Curse\r\non inglorious wealth?' Spare your indignation. I, too, detest the\r\nignorant miser; but both virtue and ambition abhor poverty, or they are\r\nmad. Rather imitate your grandfather [who had stayed in America and\r\nprospered] than your uncle.\"\r\n\r\nThe advice may have had its effect; at any rate Morris stayed at home,\r\nand, with an occasional trip to Philadelphia, got all he could out of\r\nthe society of New York, which, little provincial seaport though it was,\r\nwas yet a gay place, gayer then than any other American city save\r\nCharleston, the society consisting of the higher crown officials, the\r\nrich merchants, and the great landed proprietors. Into this society\r\nMorris, a handsome, high-bred young fellow, of easy manners and far\r\nfrom puritanical morals, plunged with a will, his caustic wit and rather\r\nbrusque self-assertion making him both admired and feared. He enjoyed it\r\nall to the full, and in his bright, chatty letters to his friends\r\npictures himself as working hard, but gay enough also: \"up all\r\nnight--balls, concerts, assemblies--all of us mad in the pursuit of\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Revolution was at hand; and both pleasure and office-work had to\r\ngive way to something more important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTBREAK OF THE REVOLUTION: MORRIS IN THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Revolution,\r\nalmost all people were utterly in the dark as to what their future\r\nconduct should be. No responsible leader thought seriously of separation\r\nfrom the mother country, and the bulk of the population were still\r\nfarther from supposing such an event to be possible. Indeed it must be\r\nremembered that all through the Revolutionary War not only was there a\r\nminority actively favorable to the royal cause, but there was also a\r\nminority--so large that, added to the preceding, it has been doubted\r\nwhether it was not a majority--that was but lukewarm in its devotion to\r\nthe American side, and was kept even moderately patriotic almost as much\r\nby the excesses of the British troops and blunders of the British\r\ngenerals and ministers, as by the valor of our own soldiers, or the\r\nskill of our own statesmen. We can now see clearly that the right of\r\nthe matter was with the patriotic party; and it was a great thing for\r\nthe whole English-speaking race that that section of it which was\r\ndestined to be the most numerous and powerful should not be cramped and\r\nfettered by the peculiarly galling shackles of provincial dependency;\r\nbut all this was not by any means so clear then as now, and some of our\r\nbest citizens thought themselves in honor bound to take the opposite\r\nside,--though of necessity those among our most high-minded men, who\r\nwere also far-sighted enough to see the true nature of the struggle,\r\nwent with the patriots.\r\n\r\nThat the loyalists of 1776 were wrong is beyond question; but it is\r\nequally beyond question that they had greater grounds for believing\r\nthemselves right than had the men who tried to break up the Union three\r\nquarters of a century later. That these latter had the most hearty faith\r\nin the justice of their cause need not be doubted; and he is but a poor\r\nAmerican whose veins do not thrill with pride as he reads of the deeds\r\nof desperate prowess done by the confederate armies; but it is most\r\nunfair to brand the \"tory\" of 1776 with a shame no longer felt to\r\npertain to the \"rebel\" of 1860. Still, there is no doubt, not only that\r\nthe patriots were right, but also that they were as a whole superior to\r\nthe tories; they were the men with a high ideal of freedom, too fond of\r\nliberty, and too self-respecting, to submit to foreign rule; they\r\nincluded the mass of hard-working, orderly, and yet high-spirited yeomen\r\nand freeholders. The tories included those of the gentry who were\r\ndevoted to aristocratic principles; the large class of timid and\r\nprosperous people (like the Pennsylvania Quakers); the many who feared\r\nabove all things disorder; also the very lowest sections of the\r\ncommunity, the lazy, thriftless, and vicious, who hated their\r\nprogressive neighbors, as in the Carolinas; and finally the men who were\r\nreally principled in favor of a kingly government.\r\n\r\nMorris was at first no more sure of his soundings than were the rest of\r\nhis companions. He was a gentleman of old family, and belonged to the\r\nruling Episcopalian Church. He was no friend to tyranny, and he was a\r\nthorough American, but he had little faith in extreme democracy. The\r\nRevolution had two sides; in the northern Atlantic States at least it\r\nwas almost as much an uprising of democracy against aristocracy as it\r\nwas a contest between America and England; and the patriotic Americans,\r\nwho nevertheless distrusted ultra-democratic ideas, suffered many\r\nmisgivings when they let their love for their country overcome their\r\npride of caste. The \"Sons of Liberty,\" a semi-secret society originating\r\namong the merchants, and very powerful in bringing discontent to a head,\r\nnow showed signs of degenerating into a mob; and for mobs Morris, like\r\nother clear-headed men, felt the most profound dislike and contempt.\r\n\r\nThroughout 1774 he took little part in the various commotions, which\r\nkept getting more and more violent. He was angered by the English\r\nencroachments, and yet was by no means pleased with the measures taken\r\nto repel them. The gentry, and the moderate men generally, were at their\r\nwits' ends in trying to lead the rest of the people, and were being\r\npushed on farther and farther all the time; the leadership, even of the\r\nrevolutionary party, still rested in their hands; but it grew\r\ncontinually less absolute. Said Morris: \"The spirit of the English\r\nconstitution has yet a little influence left, and but a little. The\r\nremains of it, however, will give the wealthy people a superiority this\r\ntime; but, would they secure it, they must banish all schoolmasters and\r\nconfine all knowledge to themselves.... The gentry begin to fear this.\r\nTheir committee will be appointed; they will deceive the people, and\r\nagain forfeit a share of their confidence. And if these instances of\r\nwhat with one side is policy, with the other perfidy, shall continue to\r\nincrease and become more frequent, farewell, aristocracy. I see, and see\r\nit with fear and trembling, that if the dispute with Britain continues,\r\nwe shall be under the worst of all possible dominions; we shall be under\r\nthe dominion of a riotous mob. It is the interest of all men, therefore,\r\nto seek for reunion with the parent state.\" He then goes on to discuss\r\nthe terms which will make this reunion possible, and evidently draws\r\nideas from sources as diverse as Rousseau and Pitt, stating, as\r\npreliminaries, that when men come together in society, there must be an\r\nimplied contract that \"a part of their freedom shall be given up for the\r\nsecurity of the remainder. But what part? The answer is plain. The least\r\npossible, considering the circumstances of the society, which constitute\r\nwhat may be called its political necessity;\" and again: \"In every\r\nsociety the members have a right to the utmost liberty that can be\r\nenjoyed consistent with the general safety;\" while he proposes the\r\nrather wild remedy of divorcing the taxing and the governing powers,\r\ngiving America the right to lay her own imposts, and regulate her\r\ninternal police, and reserving to Great Britain that to regulate the\r\ntrade for the entire empire.\r\n\r\nNaturally there was no hope of any compromise of this sort. The British\r\nministry grew more imperious, and the Colonies more defiant. At last\r\nthe clash came, and then Morris's thorough Americanism and inborn love\r\nof freedom and impatience of tyranny overcame any lingering class\r\njealousy, and he cast in his lot with his countrymen. Once in, he was\r\nnot of the stuff to waver or look back; but like most other Americans,\r\nand like almost all New Yorkers, he could not for some little time\r\nrealize how hopeless it was to try to close the breach with Great\r\nBritain. Hostilities had gone on for quite a while before even\r\nWashington could bring himself to believe that a lasting separation was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, elected as shown in the previous chapter, at a moment of\r\nreaction, was royalist in tone. It contained several stanch patriots,\r\nbut the majority, although unwilling to back up the British ministers in\r\nall their doings, were still more hostile to the growing body of\r\nrepublican revolutionists. They gradually grew wholly out of sympathy\r\nwith the people; until the latter at last gave up all attempts to act\r\nthrough their ordinary representatives, and set about electing delegates\r\nwho should prove more faithful. Thereupon, in April, 1775, the last\r\ncolonial legislature adjourned for all time, and was replaced by\r\nsuccessive bodies more in touch with the general sentiment of New York;\r\nthat is, by various committees, by a convention to elect delegates to\r\nthe Continental Congress, and then by the Provincial Congress. The lists\r\nof names in these bodies show not only how many leading men certain\r\nfamilies contributed, but also how mixed the lineage of such families\r\nwas; for among the numerous Jays, Livingstons, Ludlows, Van Cortlandts,\r\nRoosevelts, Beekmans, and others of Dutch, English, and Huguenot\r\nancestry appear names as distinctly German, Gaelic-Scotch, and Irish,\r\nlike Hoffman, Mulligan, MacDougall, Connor.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The habit of constantly importing indentured Irish servants, as well\r\nas German laborers, under contract, prevailed throughout the colonies;\r\nand the number of men thus imported was quite sufficient to form a\r\nconsiderable element in the population, and to add a new, although\r\nperhaps not very valuable, strain to our already mixed blood. In taking\r\nup at random the file of the _New York Gazette_ for 1766, we find among\r\nthe advertisements many offering rewards for runaway servants; such as\r\n\"three pounds for the runaway servant Conner O'Rourke,\" \"ten pounds for\r\nthe runaway Irish servant, Philip Maginnis,\" \"five pounds apiece for\r\ncertain runaway German miners--Bruderlein, Baum, Ostmann, etc.--imported\r\nunder contract;\" all this mixed in with advertisements of rewards of\r\nabout the same money value for \"the mulatto man named Tom,\" or the\r\n\"negroes Nero and Pompey.\" Still, in speaking of the revolutionary\r\narmies, the word \"Irish\" must almost always be understood as meaning\r\nPresbyterian Irish; the Catholic Irish had but little hand in the war,\r\nand that little was limited to furnishing soldiers to some of the\r\nBritish regiments. The Presbyterian Irish, however, in the revolutionary\r\narmies, played a part as manful and valiant as, and even more important\r\nthan, that taken by the Catholic Irish soldiers who served so bravely\r\nduring the great contest between the North and South. The few free\r\nCatholic Irish already in America in 1776 were for the most part\r\nheartily loyal; but they were not numerous enough to be of the least\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nTo the Provincial Congress, from thenceforth on the regular governmental\r\nbody of the colony, eighty-one delegates were elected, including\r\nGouverneur Morris from the county of Westchester, and seventy were\r\npresent at the first meeting, which took place on May 22 at New York.\r\nThe voting in the Congress was done by counties, each being alloted a\r\ncertain number of votes roughly approximating to its population.\r\n\r\nLexington had been fought, and the war had already begun in\r\nMassachusetts; but in New York, though it was ablaze with sympathy for\r\nthe insurgent New Englanders, the royal authority was still nominally\r\nunquestioned, and there had been no collision with the British troops.\r\nFew, if any, of the people of the colony as yet aimed at more than a\r\nredress of their grievances and the restoration of their rights and\r\nliberties; they had still no idea of cutting loose from Great Britain.\r\nEven such an avowedly popular and revolutionary body as the Provincial\r\nCongress contained some few out and out tories and very many\r\nrepresentatives of that timid, wavering class, which always halts midway\r\nin any course of action, and is ever prone to adopt half-measures,--a\r\nclass which in any crisis works quite as much harm as the actively\r\nvicious, and is almost as much hated and even more despised by the\r\nenergetic men of strong convictions. The timid good are never an element\r\nof strength in a community; but they have always been well represented\r\nin New York. During the Revolutionary War it is not probable that much\r\nmore than half of her people were ever in really hearty and active\r\nsympathy with the patriots.\r\n\r\nMorris at once took a prominent place in the Congress, and he showed the\r\nnational bent of his mind when he seconded a resolution to the effect\r\nthat implicit obedience ought to be rendered to the Continental Congress\r\nin all matters pertaining to the general regulation of the associated\r\ncolonies. The Assembly, however, was by no means certain how far it\r\nwould be well to go; and the majority declined either to approve or\r\ndisapprove of the proceedings of the late Continental Congress. They\r\nagreed to subscribe to the association, and recommended the same course\r\nto their constituents; but added that they did not believe the latter\r\nshould be forced to do so.\r\n\r\nStill, with all their doubting and faint-heartedness, they did set about\r\npreparing for resistance, and for at least the possibility of concerted\r\naction with the other colonies. The first step, of course, was to\r\nprovide for raising funds; this was considered by a committee of which\r\nMorris was a member, and he prepared and drew up their report. In the\r\nstate of public feeling, which was nearly a unit against \"taxation\r\nwithout representation\" abroad, but was the reverse of unanimous as to\r\nsubmitting even to taxation with representation at home, it was\r\nimpossible to raise money by the ordinary method; indeed, though the\r\nmass of active patriots were willing to sacrifice much, perhaps all, for\r\nthe cause, yet there were quite as many citizens whose patriotism was\r\nlukewarm enough already, and could not stand any additional chilling.\r\nSuch people are always willing to face what may be called a staved-off\r\nsacrifice, however; and promises to pay in the future what they can, but\r\nwill not pay in the present, come under this head. Besides, there would\r\nhave been other difficulties in the way, and in fact it was impossible\r\nto raise the amount needed by direct taxation. Accordingly Morris, in\r\nhis report on behalf of the committee, recommended an issue of paper\r\nmoney, and advised that this should not be done by the colony itself,\r\nbut that the Continental Congress should strike the whole sum needed,\r\nand apportion the several shares to the different colonies, each of them\r\nbeing bound to discharge its own particular part, and all together to be\r\nliable for whatever any particular colony was unable to pay. This plan\r\nsecured a wide credit and circulation to the currency, and, what was\r\nequally desirable, created throughout the colonies a common interest and\r\ncommon responsibility on a most important point, and greatly\r\nstrengthened the bonds of their union. Morris even thus early showed the\r\nbreadth of his far-seeing patriotism; he was emphatically an American\r\nfirst, a New Yorker next; the whole tone of his mind was thoroughly\r\nnational. He took the chief part in urging the adoption of the report,\r\nand made a most telling speech in its favor before the Assembly, a mixed\r\naudience of the prominent men of the colony being also present. The\r\nreport was adopted and forwarded to the Continental Congress; Morris was\r\nfelt on all sides to have already taken his place among the leaders, and\r\nfrom thenceforth he was placed on almost every important committee of\r\nthe Provincial Congress.\r\n\r\nThis body kept on its course, corresponding with the other colonies,\r\nexchanging thinly veiled threats with the Johnsons, the powerful Tory\r\nover-lords of the upper Mohawk, and preparing rather feebly for defense,\r\nbeing hampered by a total lack of funds or credit until the continental\r\ncurrency was coined. But they especially busied themselves with a plan\r\nof reconciliation with England; and in fact were so very cautions and\r\nmoderate as to be reproached by their chosen agent in England, Edmund\r\nBurke, for their \"scrupulous timidity.\" The Congress, by the way, showed\r\nsome symptoms of an advance in toleration, at least so far as the\r\nProtestant sects went; for it was opened and closed by ministers of the\r\nEpiscopalian, Dutch Reformed, Presbyterian, Baptist, and other sects,\r\neach in turn; but, as will shortly be seen, the feeling against\r\nCatholics was quite as narrow-minded and intense as ever. This was\r\nnatural enough in colonial days, when Protestantism and national\r\npatriotism were almost interchangeable terms; for the hereditary and\r\nembittered foes of the Americans, the French and Spaniards, were all\r\nCatholics, and even many of the Indians were of the same faith; and\r\nundoubtedly the wonderful increase in the spirit of tolerance shown\r\nafter the Revolution was due in part to the change of the Catholic\r\nFrench into our allies, and of the Protestant English into our most\r\nactive foes. It must be remembered, however, that the Catholic gentry\r\nof Maryland played the same part in the Revolution that their Protestant\r\nneighbors did. One of the famous Carroll family was among the signers of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence; and on the other hand, one of the\r\nCliftons was a noted loyalist leader.\r\n\r\nMorris took a prominent part, both in and out of committee, in trying to\r\nshape the plan of reconciliation, although utterly disapproving of many\r\nof the ways in which the subject was handled; for he had all the\r\ncontempt natural to most young men of brains, decision, and fiery\r\ntemper, for his timid, short-sighted, and prolix colleagues. The report\r\nwas not all to his taste in the final shape in which it was adopted. It\r\nconsisted of a series of articles recommending the repeal of the\r\nobnoxious statutes of the Imperial Parliament, the regulation of trade\r\nfor the benefit of the whole empire, the establishment of triennial\r\ncolonial legislatures, and also asserting the right of the colonies to\r\nmanage their internal polity to suit themselves, and their willingness\r\nto do their part, according to their capacities, for the general defense\r\nof the empire. The eighth article contained a denial of the right of\r\n\"Great Britain, or any other earthly legislature or tribunal, to\r\ninterfere in the ecclesiastical or religious concerns of the colonies,\"\r\ntogether with a \"protest against the indulgence and establishment of\r\npopery all along their interior confines;\" this being called forth by\r\nwhat was known as the \"Quebec Bill,\" whereby the British Parliament had\r\nrecently granted extraordinary powers and privileges to the Canadian\r\nclergy, with the obvious purpose of conciliating that powerful\r\npriesthood, and thereby converting--as was actually done--the recently\r\nconquered French of the St. Lawrence valley into efficient allies of the\r\nBritish government against the old Protestant colonies.\r\n\r\nThis eighth article was ridiculous, and was especially objected to by\r\nMorris. In one of his vigorous, deliciously fresh, and humorous letters,\r\ndated June 30, 1775, and addressed to John Jay, then in the Continental\r\nCongress, he writes:--\r\n\r\n     The foolish religious business I opposed until I was weary; it was\r\n     carried by a very small majority, and my dissent entered.... The\r\n     article about religion is most arrant nonsense, and would do as\r\n     well in a high Dutch Bible as the place it now stands in.\r\n\r\n     I drew a long report for our committee, to which they could make no\r\n     objections excepting that none of them could understand it.... I\r\n     was pleased at the rejection, because, as I observed to you before,\r\n     I think the question ought to be simplified.\r\n\r\n     I address this letter to you, but I shall be glad [if] you will\r\n     read it to Livingstone, for I intend it for both of you; make my\r\n     compliments to him, and tell him that I shall write to him when I\r\n     have time to write a good letter--this is a damned bad one, and\r\n     would not exist, if I did not think it a duty to myself to show my\r\n     friends that I had no hand in that foolish religious business, I\r\n     am, as you well know, your friend, etc.\r\n\r\nMorris did not believe in a colonial assembly making overtures for a\r\nreconciliation, as he thought this was the province of the Continental\r\nCongress. The majority was against him, but he was a clever politician\r\nand parliamentary tactician, as well as a great statesman, and he fairly\r\noutwitted and hoodwinked his opponents, persuading them finally to adopt\r\nthe report in the form of a mere expression of opinions to be sent to\r\ntheir congressional delegates, with a prayer that the latter would \"use\r\nevery effort for the compromising of this unnatural quarrel between the\r\nparent and child.\" In this shape it was forwarded to the delegates, who\r\nanswered that they would do all in their power to compromise the\r\nquarrel, and added a postscript, written by Jay himself, to the effect\r\nthat they deemed it better not to make any mention of the religious\r\narticle before the Congress, as they thought it wise to bury \"all\r\ndisputes on ecclesiastical points, which have for ages had no other\r\ntendency than that of banishing peace and charity from the world.\"\r\n\r\nWhile all this was pending, and though Bunker Hill had been fought, and\r\nthe war was in full progress round Boston, New York yet maintained what\r\nmight almost be described as an attitude of armed neutrality. The city\r\nwas so exposed to the British war-ships in the bay, and the surrounding\r\npopulation was so doubtful, that the patriot party dared not take the\r\ndeciding steps, especially as so many of its members still clung to the\r\nhope of a peaceful settlement. Morris announced frankly that he did not\r\nbelieve in breaking the peace until they were prepared to take the\r\nconsequences. Indeed, when the few British troops left the city to join\r\nthe garrison in Boston, he strongly opposed the action of the Sons of\r\nLiberty, who gathered hastily together, and took away the cartloads of\r\narms and ammunition that the soldiers were taking with them. The\r\nCongress, to their honor, discouraged, to the best of their power, the\r\nrioting and mobbing of Tories in the city.\r\n\r\nIn fact, New York's position was somewhat like that of Kentucky at the\r\noutbreak of the Civil War. Her backwardness in definitely throwing in\r\nher lot with the revolutionists was clearly brought out by a rather\r\nludicrous incident. General Washington, on his way to take command of\r\nthe continental army round Boston, passed through New York the same day\r\nthe royal governor, Tryon, arrived by sea, and the authorities were cast\r\ninto a great quandary as to how they should treat two such kings of\r\nBrentford when the one rose was so small. Finally they compromised by\r\nsending a guard of honor to attend each; Montgomery and Morris, as\r\ndelegates from the Assembly, received Washington and brought him before\r\nthat body, which addressed him in terms of cordial congratulation, but\r\nended with a noteworthy phrase,--that \"when the contest should be\r\ndecided by an accommodation with the mother country, he should deliver\r\nup the important deposit that had been confided to his hands.\"\r\n\r\nThese words give us the key to the situation. Even the patriots of the\r\ncolony could not realize that there was no hope of an \"accommodation\";\r\nand they were hampered at every step by the fear of the British\r\nfrigates, and of the numerous Tories. The latter were very bold and\r\ndefiant; when Congress tried to disarm them, they banded themselves\r\ntogether, bade the authorities defiance, and plainly held the upper land\r\non Staten Island and in Queens County. New York furnished many excellent\r\nsoldiers to the royal armies during the war, and from among her gentry\r\ncame the most famous of the Tory leaders,--such as Johnson and De\r\nLancey, whose prowess was felt by the hapless people of their own native\r\nprovince; De Peyster, who was Ferguson's second in command at King's\r\nMountain; and Cruger, who, in the Carolinas, inflicted a check upon\r\nGreene himself. The Tories were helped also by the jealousy felt towards\r\nsome of the other colonies, especially Connecticut, whose people took\r\nthe worst possible course for the patriot side by threatening to \"crush\r\ndown\" New York, and by finally furnishing an armed and mounted mob which\r\nrode suddenly into the city, and wrecked the office of an obnoxious\r\nloyalist printer named Rivington. This last proceeding caused great\r\nindignation, and nearly made a split in the revolutionary camp.\r\n\r\nNew York had thus some cause for her inaction; nevertheless, her lack of\r\nboldness and decision were not creditable to her, and she laid herself\r\nopen to just reproaches. Nor can Morris himself be altogether freed from\r\nthe charge of having clung too long to the hope of a reconciliation and\r\nto a policy of half measures. He was at that time chairman of a\r\nlegislative committee which denounced any projected invasion of Canada\r\n(therein, however, only following the example of the Continental\r\nCongress), and refused to allow Ethan Allen to undertake one, as that\r\nadventurous partisan chieftain requested. But Morris was too\r\nclear-sighted to occupy a doubtful position long; and he now began to\r\nsee things clearly as they were, and to push his slower or more timid\r\nassociates forward along the path which they had set out to tread. He\r\nwas instrumental in getting the militia into somewhat better shape; and,\r\nas it was found impossible to get enough continental money, a colonial\r\npaper currency was issued. In spite of the quarrel with Connecticut, a\r\nforce from that province moved in to take part in the defense of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nYet, in the main, the policy of the New York Congress still continued\r\nboth weak and changeable, and no improvement was effected when it was\r\ndissolved and a second elected. To this body the loyalist counties of\r\nRichmond and Queens refused to return delegates, and throughout the\r\ncolony affairs grew more disorderly, and the administration of justice\r\ncame nearly to a standstill. Finding that the local congress seemed\r\nlikely to remain unable to make up its mind how to act, the continental\r\nleaders at last took matters into their own hands, and marched a force\r\ninto New York city early in February, 1776. This had a most bracing\r\neffect upon the provincial authorities; yet they still continued to\r\nallow the British war-ships in the bay to be supplied with provisions,\r\nnor was this attitude altered until in April Washington arrived with the\r\nmain continental army. He at once insisted that a final break should be\r\nmade; and about the same time the third Provincial Congress was elected.\r\nMorris, again returned for Westchester, headed the bolder spirits, who\r\nhad now decided that the time had come to force their associates out of\r\ntheir wavering course, and to make them definitely cast in their lot\r\nwith their fellow Americans. Things had come to a point which made a\r\ndecision necessary; the gathering of the continental forces on Manhattan\r\nIsland and the threatening attitude of the British fleet and army made\r\nit impossible for even the most timid to keep on lingering in a state of\r\nuncertainty. So the Declaration of Independence was ratified, and a\r\nstate constitution organized; then the die was cast, and thereafter New\r\nYork manfully stood by the result of the throw.\r\n\r\nThe two Provincial Congresses that decided on this course held their\r\nsessions in a time of the greatest tumult, when New York was threatened\r\nhourly by the British; and long before their work was ended they had\r\nhastily to leave the city. Before describing what they did, a glance\r\nshould be taken at the circumstances under which it was done.\r\n\r\nThe peaceable citizens, especially those with any property, gradually\r\nleft New York; and it remained in possession of the raw levies of the\r\ncontinentals, while Staten Island received Howe with open arms, and he\r\nwas enabled without difficulty to disembark his great force of British\r\nand German mercenaries on Long Island. The much smaller, motley force\r\nopposed to him, unorganized, ill armed, and led by utterly inexperienced\r\nmen, was beaten, with hardly an effort, in the battle that followed, and\r\nonly escaped annihilation through the skill of Washington and the supine\r\nblundering of Howe. Then it was whipped up the Hudson and beyond the\r\nborders of the State, the broken remnant fleeing across New Jersey; and\r\nthough the brilliant feats of arms at Trenton and Princeton enabled the\r\nAmericans to reconquer the latter province, southern New York lay under\r\nthe heel of the British till the close of the war.\r\n\r\nThus Morris, Jay, and the other New York leaders were obliged for six\r\nyears to hold up their cause in a half-conquered State, a very large\r\nproportion of whose population was lukewarm or hostile. The odds were\r\nheavy against the patriots, because their worst foes were those of\r\ntheir own household. English writers are fond of insisting upon the\r\nalleged fact that America only won her freedom by the help of foreign\r\nnations. Such help was certainly most important, but, on the other hand,\r\nit must be remembered that during the first and vital years of the\r\ncontest the revolutionary colonists had to struggle unaided against the\r\nBritish, their mercenary German and Indian allies, Tories, and even\r\nFrench Canadians. When the French court declared in our favor the worst\r\nwas already over; Trenton had been won, Burgoyne had been captured, and\r\nValley Forge was a memory of the past.\r\n\r\nWe did not owe our main disasters to the might of our foes, nor our\r\nfinal triumph to the help of our friends. It was on our own strength\r\nthat we had to rely, and it was with our own folly and weakness that we\r\nhad to contend. The revolutionary leaders can never be too highly\r\npraised; but taken in bulk the Americans of the last quarter of the\r\neighteenth century do not compare to advantage with the Americans of the\r\nthird quarter of the nineteenth. In our Civil War it was the people who\r\npressed on the leaders, and won almost as much in spite of as because of\r\nthem; but the leaders of the Revolution had to goad the rank and file\r\ninto line. They were forced to contend not only with the active\r\nhostility of the Tories, but with the passive neutrality of the\r\nindifferent, and the selfishness, jealousy, and short-sightedness of the\r\npatriotic. Had the Americans of 1776 been united, and had they possessed\r\nthe stubborn, unyielding tenacity and high devotion to an ideal shown by\r\nthe North, or the heroic constancy and matchless valor shown by the\r\nSouth, in the Civil War, the British would have been driven off the\r\ncontinent before three years were over.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that nearly as great a proportion of our own people were\r\nactively or passively opposed to the formation of our union originally\r\nas were in favor of its dissolution in 1860. This was one of the main\r\nreasons why the war dragged on so long. It may be seen by the fact,\r\namong others, that when in the Carolinas and Georgia a system of\r\nrelentless and undying partisan warfare not only crushed the Tories, but\r\nliterally destroyed them from off the face of the earth, then the\r\nBritish, though still victorious in almost every pitched battle, were at\r\nonce forced to abandon the field.\r\n\r\nAnother reason was the inferior military capacity of the revolutionary\r\narmies. The continental troops, when trained, were excellent; but in\r\nalmost every battle they were mixed with more or less worthless militia;\r\nand of the soldiers thus obtained all that can be said is that their\r\nofficers could never be sure that they would fight, nor their enemies\r\nthat they would run away. The revolutionary troops certainly fell short\r\nof the standard reached by the volunteers who fought Shiloh and\r\nGettysburg. The British rarely found them to be such foes as they\r\nafterwards met at New Orleans and Lundy's Lane. Throughout the\r\nRevolution the militia were invariably leaving their posts at critical\r\ntimes; they would grow either homesick or dejected, and would then go\r\nhome at the very crisis of the campaign; they did not begin to show the\r\nstubbornness and resolution to \"see the war through\" so common among\r\ntheir descendants in the contending Federal and Confederate armies.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that in 1776 our main task was to shape new political\r\nconditions, and then to reconcile our people to them; whereas in 1860 we\r\nhad merely to fight fiercely for the preservation of what was already\r\nours. In the first emergency we needed statesmen, and in the second\r\nwarriors; and the statesmen and warriors were forthcoming. A comparison\r\nof the men who came to the front during these, the two heroic periods of\r\nthe Republic, brings out this point clearly.\r\n\r\nWashington, alike statesman, soldier, and patriot, stands alone. He was\r\nnot only the greatest American; he was also one of the greatest men the\r\nworld has ever known. Few centuries and few countries have ever seen his\r\nlike. Among the people of English stock there is none to compare with\r\nhim, unless perhaps Cromwell, utterly different though the latter was.\r\nOf Americans, Lincoln alone is worthy to stand even second.\r\n\r\nAs for our other statesmen: Franklin, Hamilton, Jefferson, Adams, and\r\ntheir fellows, most surely stand far above Seward, Sumner, Chase,\r\nStanton, and Stevens, great as were the services which these, and those\r\nlike them, rendered.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to the fighting men, all this is reversed. As a mere\r\nmilitary man Washington himself cannot rank with the wonderful war-chief\r\nwho for four years led the Army of Northern Virginia; and the names of\r\nWashington and Greene fill up the short list of really good\r\nRevolutionary Generals. Against these the Civil War shows a roll that\r\ncontains not only Lee, but also Grant and Sherman, Jackson and Johnson,\r\nThomas, Sheridan, and Farragut,--leaders whose volunteer soldiers and\r\nsailors, at the end of their four years' service, were ready and more\r\nthan able to match themselves against the best regular forces of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE: FORMING THE STATE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third Provincial Congress, which came together in May, and before\r\nthe close of its sessions was obliged to adjourn to White Plains, had to\r\nact on the Declaration of Independence, and provide for the foundation\r\nof a new state government.\r\n\r\nMorris now put himself at the head of the patriotic party, and opened\r\nthe proceedings by a long and very able speech in favor of adopting the\r\nrecommendation of the Continental Congress that the colonies should form\r\nnew governments. In his argument he went at length into the history and\r\ngrowth of the dispute with Great Britain, spoke of the efforts made in\r\nthe past for reconciliation, and then showed clearly how such efforts\r\nwere now not only hopeless, but also no longer compatible with the\r\ndignity and manhood of Americans. He sneered at those who argued that we\r\nought to submit to Great Britain for the sake of the protection we got\r\nfrom her. \"Great Britain will not fail to bring us into a war with some\r\nof her neighbors, and then protect us as a lawyer defends a suit: the\r\nclient paying for it. This is quite in form, but a wise man would, I\r\nthink, get rid of the suit and the lawyer together. Again, how are we to\r\nbe protected? If a descent is made upon our coasts and the British navy\r\nand army are three thousand miles off, we cannot receive very great\r\nbenefit from them on that occasion. If, to obviate this inconvenience,\r\nwe have an army and navy constantly among us, who can say that we shall\r\nnot need a little protection against _them_?\" He went on to point out\r\nthe hopelessness of expecting Great Britain to keep to any terms which\r\nwould deprive Parliament of its supremacy over America: for no\r\nsucceeding Parliament could be held bound by the legislation of its\r\npredecessor, and the very acknowledgment of British supremacy on the\r\npart of the Americans would bind them as subjects, and make the\r\nsupremacy of Parliament legitimate. He bade his hearers remember the\r\nmaxim \"that no faith is to be kept with rebels;\" and said: \"In this\r\ncase, or in any other case, if we fancy ourselves hardly dealt with, I\r\nmaintain there is no redress but by arms. For it never yet was known\r\nthat, when men assume power, they will part with it again, unless by\r\ncompulsion.\"\r\n\r\nHe then took up the subject of independence, showed, for the benefit of\r\nthe good but timid men who were frightened at the mere title, that, in\r\nall but name, it already existed in New York, and proved that its\r\nmaintenance was essential to our well-being. \"My argument, therefore,\r\nstands thus: As a connection with Great Britain cannot again exist\r\nwithout enslaving America, an independence is absolutely necessary. I\r\ncannot balance between the two. We run a hazard in one path, I confess;\r\nbut then we are infallibly ruined if we pursue the other.... We find the\r\ncharacteristic marks and insignia of independence in this society,\r\nconsidered in itself and compared with other societies. The enumeration\r\nis conviction. Coining moneys, raising armies, regulating commerce,\r\npeace, war: all these things you are not only adepts in, but masters of.\r\nTreaties alone remain, and even those you have dabbled at. Georgia you\r\nput under the ban of empire, and received her upon repentance as a\r\nmember of the flock. Canada you are now treating with. France and Spain\r\nyou ought to treat with, and the rest is but a name. I believe, sir, the\r\nRomans were as much governed, or rather oppressed, by their emperors, as\r\never any people were by their king. But emperor was more agreeable to\r\ntheir ears than king. [So] some, nay, many, persons in America dislike\r\nthe word independence.\"\r\n\r\nHe then went on to show how independence would work well alike for our\r\npeace, liberty, and security. Considering the first, he laughed at the\r\napprehensions expressed by some that the moment America was independent\r\nall the powers of Europe would pounce down on her, to parcel out the\r\ncountry among themselves; and showed clearly that to a European power\r\nany war of conquest in America would be \"tedious, expensive, uncertain,\r\nand ruinous,\" and that none of the country could be kept even if it\r\nshould come to pass that some little portion of it were conquered. \"But\r\nI cannot think it will ever come to this. For when I turn my eyes to the\r\nmeans of defense, I find them amply sufficient. We have all heard that\r\nin the last war America was conquered in Germany. I hold the converse of\r\nthis to be true, namely, that in and by America his Majesty's German\r\ndominions were secured.... I expect a full and lasting defense against\r\nany and every part of the earth.\" After thus treating of the advantages\r\nto be hoped for on the score of peace, he turns attention \"to a question\r\nof infinitely greater importance, namely, the liberty of this country;\"\r\nand afterwards passes to the matter of security, which, \"so long as the\r\nsystem of laws by which we are now governed shall prevail, is amply\r\nprovided for in every separate colony. There may indeed arise an\r\nobjection because some gentlemen suppose that the different colonies\r\nwill carry on a sort of land piracy against one another. But how this\r\ncan possibly happen when the idea of separate colonies no longer exists\r\nI cannot for my soul comprehend. That something very like this has\r\nalready been done I shall not deny, but the reason is as evident as the\r\nfact. We never yet had a government in this country of sufficient energy\r\nto restrain the lawless and indigent. Whenever a form of government is\r\nestablished which deserves the name, these insurrections must cease. But\r\nwho is the man so hardy as to affirm that they will not grow with our\r\ngrowth, while on every occasion we must resort to an English judicature\r\nto terminate differences which the maxims of policy will teach them to\r\nleave undetermined? By degrees we are getting beyond the utmost pale of\r\nEnglish government. Settlements are forming to the westward of us, whose\r\ninhabitants acknowledge no authority but their own.\" In one sentence he\r\nshowed rather a change of heart, as regarded his former aristocratic\r\nleanings; for he reproached those who were \"apprehensive of losing a\r\nlittle consequence and importance by living in a country where all are\r\non an equal footing,\" and predicted that we should \"cause all nations to\r\nresort hither as an asylum from oppression.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was remarkable for its incisive directness and boldness, for\r\nthe exact clearness with which it portrayed things as they were, for the\r\nbroad sense of American nationality that it displayed, and for the\r\naccurate forecasts that it contained as to our future course in certain\r\nparticulars,--such as freedom from European wars and entanglements, a\r\nstrong but purely defensive foreign policy, the encouragement of the\r\ngrowth of the West, while keeping it united to us, and the throwing open\r\nour doors to the oppressed from abroad.\r\n\r\nSoon after the delivery of this speech news came that the Declaration of\r\nIndependence had been adopted by the Continental Congress; and Jay, one\r\nof the New York delegates to this body, and also a member of the\r\nProvincial Congress, drew up for the latter a resolution emphatically\r\nindorsing the declaration, which was at once adopted without a\r\ndissenting voice. At the same time the Provincial Congress changed its\r\nname to that of \"The Convention of the Representatives of the State of\r\nNew York.\"\r\n\r\nThese last acts were done by a body that had been elected, with\r\nincreased power, to succeed the third Provincial Congress and provide\r\nfor a new constitution. Just before this, Morris had been sent to the\r\nContinental Congress in Philadelphia to complain that the troops from\r\nNew England were paid more largely than those from the other colonies; a\r\nwrong which was at once redressed, the wages of the latter being raised,\r\nand Morris returned to New York in triumph after only a week's absence.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Convention of New York led a most checkered life; for\r\nthe victorious British chevied it up and down the State, hunting it in\r\nturn from every small town in which it thought to have found a peaceful\r\nhaven of refuge. At last it rested in Fiskhill, such an out-of-the-way\r\nplace as to be free from danger. The members were obliged to go armed,\r\nso as to protect themselves from stray marauding parties; and the number\r\nof delegates in attendance alternately dwindled and swelled in a\r\nwonderful manner, now resolving themselves into a committee of safety,\r\nand again resuming their functions as members of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe most important duties of the convention were intrusted to two\r\ncommittees. Of the first, which was to draft a plan for the\r\nConstitution, Morris, Jay, and Livingston were the three leading\r\nmembers, upon whom all the work fell; of the second, which was to devise\r\nmeans for the establishment of a state fund, Morris was the chairman and\r\nmoving spirit.\r\n\r\nHe was also chairman of a committee which was appointed to look after\r\nthe Tories, and prevent them from joining together and rising; and so\r\nnumerous were they that the jails were soon choked with those of their\r\nnumber who, on account of their prominence or bitterness, were most\r\nobnoxious to the patriots. Also a partial system of confiscation of Tory\r\nestates was begun. So greatly were the Tories feared and hated, and so\r\ndetermined were the attempts to deprive them of even the shadow of a\r\nchance to do harm, by so much as a word, that the convention sent a\r\nmemorial, drafted by Morris, to the Continental Congress, in which they\r\nmade the very futile suggestion that it should take \"some measures for\r\nexpunging from the Book of Common Prayer such parts, and discontinuing\r\nin the congregations of all other denominations all such prayers, as\r\ninterfere with the interests of the American cause.\" The resolution was\r\nnot acted on; but another part of the memorial shows how the Church of\r\nEngland men were standing by the mother country, for it goes on to\r\nrecite that \"the enemies of America have taken great pains to insinuate\r\ninto the minds of the Episcopalians that the church is in danger. We\r\ncould wish the Congress would pass some resolve to quiet their fears,\r\nand we are confident that it would do essential service to the cause of\r\nAmerica, at least in this State.\"\r\n\r\nMorris's position in regard to the Tories was a peculiarly hard one,\r\nbecause among their number were many of his own relatives, including his\r\nelder brother. The family house, where his mother resided, was within\r\nthe British lines; and not only did he feel the disapproval of such of\r\nhis people as were loyalists, on the one side, but, on the other, his\r\nletters to his family caused him to be regarded with suspicion by the\r\nbaser spirits in the American party. About this time one of his sisters\r\ndied; the letter he then wrote to his mother is in the usual formal\r\nstyle of the time, yet it shows marks of deep feeling, and he takes\r\noccasion, while admitting that the result of the war was uncertain, to\r\navow, with a sternness unusual to him, his intention to face all things\r\nrather than abandon the patriot cause. \"The worst that can happen is to\r\nfall on the last bleak mountain of America; and he who dies there in\r\ndefense of the injured rights of mankind is happier than his conqueror,\r\nmore beloved by mankind, more applauded by his own heart.\" The letter\r\ncloses by a characteristic touch, when he sends his love to \"such as\r\ndeserve it. The number is not great.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee on the constitution was not ready to report until March,\r\n1777. Then the convention devoted itself solely to the consideration of\r\nthe report, which, after several weeks' discussion, was adopted with\r\nvery little change. Jay and Morris led the debate before the convention,\r\nas they had done previously in committee. There was perfect agreement\r\nupon the general principles. Freehold suffrage was adopted, and a\r\nmajority of the freeholders of the State were thus the ultimate\r\ngoverning power. The executive, judicial, and legislative powers were\r\nseparated sharply, as was done in the other States, and later on in the\r\nFederal Constitution as well. The legislative body was divided into two\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nIt was over the executive branch that the main contest arose. It was\r\nconceded that this should be nominally single headed; that is, that\r\nthere should be a governor. But the members generally could not realize\r\nhow different was a governor elected by the people and responsible to\r\nthem, from one appointed by an alien and higher power to rule over them,\r\nas in the colonial days. The remembrance of the contests with the royal\r\ngovernors was still fresh; and the mere name of governor frightened\r\nthem. They had the same illogical fear of the executive that the\r\ndemagogues of to-day (and some honest but stupid people, as well)\r\nprofess to feel for a standing army. Men often let the dread of the\r\nshadow of a dead wrong frighten them into courting a living evil.\r\n\r\nMorris himself was wonderfully clear-sighted and cool-headed. He did not\r\nlet the memory of the wrong-doing of the royal governors blind him; he\r\nsaw that the trouble with them lay, not in the power that they held, but\r\nin the source from which that power came. Once the source was changed,\r\nthe power was an advantage, not a harm, to the State. Yet few or none of\r\nhis companions could see this; and they nervously strove to save their\r\nnew State from the danger of executive usurpation by trying to make the\r\nexecutive practically a board of men instead of one man, and by\r\ncrippling it so as to make it ineffective for good, while at the same\r\ntime dividing the responsibility, so that no one need be afraid to do\r\nevil. Above all, they were anxious to take away from the governor the\r\nappointment of the military and civil servants of the State.\r\n\r\nMorris had persuaded the committee to leave the appointment of these\r\nofficials to the governor, the legislature retaining the power of\r\nconfirmation or rejection; but the convention, under the lead of Jay,\r\nrejected this proposition, and after some discussion adopted in its\r\nplace the cumbrous and foolish plan of a \"council of appointment,\" to\r\nconsist of the governor and several senators. As might have been\r\nexpected, this artificial body worked nothing but harm, and became\r\nsimply a peculiarly odious political machine.\r\n\r\nAgain, Morris advocated giving the governor a qualified veto over the\r\nacts passed by the legislature; but instead of such a simple and\r\nstraightforward method of legislative revision, the convention saw fit\r\nto adopt a companion piece of foolishness to the council of appointment,\r\nin the shape of the equally complicated and anomalous council of\r\nrevision, consisting of the governor, chancellor, and judges of the\r\nsupreme court, by whom all the acts of the legislature had to be revised\r\nbefore they could become laws. It is marvelous that these two bodies\r\nshould have lived on so long as they did--over forty years.\r\n\r\nThe convention did one most praiseworthy thing in deciding in favor of\r\ncomplete religious toleration. This seems natural enough now; but at\r\nthat time there was hardly a European state that practiced it. Great\r\nBritain harassed her Catholic subjects in a hundred different ways,\r\nwhile in France Protestants were treated far worse, and, in fact, could\r\nscarcely be regarded as having any legal standing whatever. On no other\r\none point do the statesmen of the Revolution show to more marked\r\nadvantage when compared with their European compeers than in this of\r\ncomplete religious toleration. Their position was taken, too, simply\r\nbecause they deemed it to be the right and proper one; they had nothing\r\nto fear or hope from Catholics, and their own interests were in no wise\r\nadvanced by what they did in the matter.\r\n\r\nBut in the New York convention toleration was not obtained without a\r\nfight. There always rankled in Jay's mind the memory of the terrible\r\ncruelty wrought by Catholics on his Huguenot forefathers; and he\r\nintroduced into the article on toleration an appendix, which\r\ndiscriminated against the adherents of the Church of Rome, denying them\r\nthe rights of citizenship until they should solemnly swear before the\r\nsupreme court, first, \"that they verily believe in their conscience,\r\nthat no pope, priest, or foreign authority on earth has power to absolve\r\nthe subjects of this State from their allegiance to the same;\" and,\r\nsecond, \"that they renounce ... the dangerous and damnable doctrine that\r\nthe Pope or any other earthly authority has power to absolve men from\r\nsins described in and prohibited by the Holy Gospel.\" This second point,\r\nhowever important, was of purely theological interest, and had\r\nabsolutely nothing to do with the state constitution; as to the first\r\nproposition, it might have been proper enough had there been the least\r\nchance of a conflict between the Pope, either in his temporal or his\r\necclesiastical capacity, and the United States; but as there was no\r\npossibility of such a conflict arising, and as, if it did arise, there\r\nwould not be the slightest danger of the United States receiving any\r\ndamage, to put the sentence in would have been not only useless, but\r\nexceedingly foolish and harmful, on account of the intense irritation it\r\nwould have excited.\r\n\r\nThe whole clause was rejected by a two to one vote, and then all the\r\ngood that it aimed at was accomplished by the adoption, on the motion of\r\nMorris, of a proviso that the toleration granted should not be held to\r\n\"justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of this\r\nState.\" This proviso of Morris remains in the Constitution to this day;\r\nand thus, while absolute religious liberty is guaranteed, the State\r\nreserves to itself full right of protection, if necessary, against the\r\nadherents of any religious body, foreign or domestic, if they menace the\r\npublic safety.\r\n\r\nOn a question even more important than religious toleration, namely, the\r\nabolition of domestic slavery, Jay and Morris fought side by side; but\r\nthough the more enlightened of their fellow-members went with them,\r\nthey were a little too much in advance of the age, and failed. They\r\nmade every effort to have a clause introduced into the constitution\r\nrecommending to the future legislature of New York to abolish slavery as\r\nsoon as it could be done consistently with the public safety and the\r\nrights of property; \"so that in future ages every human being who\r\nbreathes the air of this State shall enjoy the privileges of a free\r\nman.\" Although they failed in their immediate purpose, yet they had much\r\nhearty support, and by the bold stand they took and the high ground they\r\noccupied they undoubtedly brought nearer the period when the abolition\r\nof slavery in New York became practicable.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was finally adopted by the convention almost\r\nunanimously, and went into effect forthwith, as there was no\r\nratification by the people at large.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was adopted a committee, which included Morris, Jay, and\r\nLivingston, was appointed to start and organize the new government. The\r\ncourts of justice were speedily put in running order, and thus one of\r\nthe most crying evils that affected the State was remedied. A council of\r\nsafety of fifteen members--again including Morris--was established to\r\nact as the provincial government, until the regular legislature should\r\nconvene. An election for governor was also held almost immediately, and\r\nClinton was chosen. He was then serving in the field, where he had done\r\ngood work, and, together with his brother James, had fought with the\r\nstubborn valor that seems to go with Anglo-Irish blood. He did not give\r\nup his command until several months after he was elected, although\r\nmeanwhile keeping up constant communication with the council of safety,\r\nthrough whom he acted in matters of state.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Burgoyne, with his eight or nine thousand troops, excellently\r\ndrilled British and Hessians, assisted by Tories, Canadians, and\r\nIndians, had crossed the northern frontier, and was moving down towards\r\nthe heart of the already disorganized State, exciting the wildest panic\r\nand confusion. The council of safety hardly knew how to act, and finally\r\nsent a committee of two, Morris being one, to the headquarters of\r\nGeneral Schuyler, who had the supreme command over all the troops in the\r\nnorthern part of New York.\r\n\r\nOn Morris's arrival he found affairs at a very low ebb, and at once\r\nwrote to describe this condition to the president of the council of\r\nsafety. Burgoyne's army had come steadily on. He first destroyed\r\nArnold's flotilla on Lake Champlain. Then he captured the forts along\r\nthe Lakes, and utterly wrecked the division of the American army that\r\nhad been told off to defend them, under the very unfortunate General St.\r\nClair. He was now advancing through the great reaches of wooded\r\nwilderness towards the head of the Hudson. Schuyler, a general of fair\r\ncapacity, was doing what he could to hold the enemy back; but his one\r\nefficient supporter was the wilderness itself, through which the British\r\narmy stumbled painfully along. Schuyler had in all less than five\r\nthousand men, half of them short service continental troops, the other\r\nhalf militia. The farmers would not turn out until after harvest home;\r\nall the bodies of militia, especially those from New England, were very\r\ninsubordinate and of most fickle temper, and could not be depended on\r\nfor any sustained contest; as an example, Stark, under whose nominal\r\ncommand the northern New Engenders won the battle of Bennington,\r\nactually marched off his whole force the day before the battle of\r\nStillwater, alleging the expiration of the term of service of his\r\nsoldiers as an excuse for what looked like gross treachery or cowardice,\r\nbut was probably merely sheer selfish wrong-headedness and mean\r\njealousy. Along the Mohawk valley the dismay was extreme, and the\r\nmilitia could not be got out at all. Jay was so angered by the abject\r\nterror in this quarter that he advised leaving the inhabitants to shift\r\nfor themselves; sound advice, too, for when the pinch came and they\r\nwere absolutely forced to take arms, they did very fairly at Oriskany.\r\nIt was even feared that the settlers of the region which afterwards\r\nbecame Vermont would go over to the enemy; still, time and space were in\r\nour favor, and Morris was quite right when he said in his first letter\r\n(dated July 16, 1777): \"Upon the whole I think we shall do very well,\r\nbut this opinion is founded merely upon the barriers which nature has\r\nraised against all access from the northward.\" As he said of himself, he\r\nwas \"a good guesser.\"\r\n\r\nHe outlined the plan which he thought the Americans should follow. This\r\nwas to harass the British in every way, without risking a stand-up\r\nfight, while laying waste the country through which they were to pass so\r\nas to render it impossible for an army to subsist on it. For the militia\r\nhe had the most hearty contempt, writing: \"Three hundred of the militia\r\nof Massachusetts Bay went off this morning, in spite of the\r\nopposition--we should have said, entreaties--of their officers. All the\r\nmilitia on the ground are so heartily tired, and so extremely desirous\r\nof getting home, that it is more than probable that none of them will\r\nremain here ten days longer. One half was discharged two days ago, to\r\nsilence, if possible, their clamor; and the remainder, officers\r\nexcepted, will soon discharge themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe council of safety grew so nervous over the outlook that their\r\nletters became fairly querulous; and they not unnaturally asked Morris\r\nto include in his letters some paragraphs that could be given to the\r\npublic. To this that rather quick-tempered gentleman took exceptions,\r\nand replied caustically in his next letter, the opening paragraph being:\r\n\"We have received yours of the 19th, which has afforded us great\r\npleasure, since we are enabled in some measure to collect from it our\r\nerrand to the northward, one of the most important objects of our\r\njourney being, in the opinion of your honorable body, to write the\r\nnews,\" and he closes by stating that he shall come back to wait upon\r\nthem, and learn their pleasure, at once.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the repeated disasters in the north had occasioned much clamor\r\nagainst Schuyler, who, if not a brilliant general, had still done what\r\nhe could in very trying circumstances, and was in no wise responsible\r\nfor the various mishaps that had occurred. The New England members of\r\nCongress, always jealous of New York, took advantage of this to begin\r\nintriguing against him, under the lead of Roger Sherman and others, and\r\nfinally brought about his replacement by Gates, a much inferior man,\r\nwith no capacity whatever for command. Morris and Jay both took up\r\nSchuyler's cause very warmly, seeing clearly, in the first place, that\r\nthe disasters were far from ruinous, and that a favorable outcome was\r\nprobable; and, in the second place, that it was the people themselves\r\nwho were to blame and not Schuyler. They went on to Philadelphia to\r\nspeak for him, but they arrived just a day too late, Gates having been\r\nappointed twenty-four hours previous to their coming.\r\n\r\nWhen Gates reached his army the luck had already begun to turn.\r\nBurgoyne's outlying parties had been destroyed, his Indians and\r\nCanadians had left him, he had been disappointed in his hopes of a Tory\r\nuprising in his favor, and, hampered by his baggage-train, he had been\r\nbrought almost to a stand-still in the tangled wilds through which he\r\nhad slowly ploughed his way. Schuyler had done what he could to hinder\r\nthe foe's progress, and had kept his own army together as a rallying\r\npoint for the militia, who, having gathered in their harvests, and being\r\ninspirited by the outcome of the fights at Oriskany and Bennington,\r\nflocked in by hundreds to the American standard. Gates himself did\r\nliterally nothing; he rather hindered his men than otherwise; and the\r\nlatter were turbulent and prone to disobey orders. But they were now in\r\nfine feather for fighting, and there were plenty of them. So Gates\r\nmerely sat still, and the levy of backwoods farmers, all good individual\r\nfighters, and with some excellent brigade and regimental commanders,\r\nsuch as Arnold and Morgan, fairly mobbed to death the smaller number of\r\ndispirited and poorly led regulars against whom they were pitted. When\r\nthe latter were at last fought out and forced to give in, Gates allowed\r\nthem much better terms than he should have done; and the Continental\r\nCongress, to its shame, snatched at a technicality, under cover of which\r\nto break the faith plighted through its general, and to avoid fulfilling\r\nthe conditions to which he had so foolishly agreed.\r\n\r\nMorris and Jay, though unable to secure the retention of Schuyler, had,\r\nnevertheless, by their representations while at Philadelphia, prevailed\r\non the authorities largely to reinforce the army which was about to be\r\nput under Gates. Morris was very angry at the intrigue by which the\r\nlatter had been given the command; but what he was especially aiming at\r\nwas the success of the cause, not the advancement of his friends. Once\r\nGates was appointed he did all in his power to strengthen him, and, with\r\nhis usual clear-sightedness, he predicted his ultimate success.\r\n\r\nSchuyler was a man of high character and public spirit, and he behaved\r\nreally nobly in the midst of his disappointment; his conduct throughout\r\naffording a very striking contrast to that of McClellan, under somewhat\r\nsimilar circumstances in the Civil War. Morris wrote him, sympathizing\r\nwith him, and asking him to sink all personal feeling and devote his\r\nenergies to the common weal of the country while out of power just as\r\nstrenuously as he had done when in command. Schuyler responded that he\r\nshould continue to serve his country as zealously as before, and he made\r\nhis words good; but Gates was jealous of the better man whose downfall\r\nhe had been the instrument of accomplishing, and declined to profit by\r\nhis help.\r\n\r\nIn a later letter to Schuyler, written September 18, 1777, Morris\r\npraised the latter very warmly for the way he had behaved, and commented\r\nroughly on Gates' littleness of spirit. He considered that with such a\r\ncommander there was nothing to be hoped for from skillful management,\r\nand that Burgoyne would have to be simply tired out. Alluding to a rumor\r\nthat the Indians were about to take up the hatchet for us, he wrote, in\r\nthe humorous vein he adopted so often in dealing even with the most\r\npressing matters: \"If this be true, it would be infinitely better to\r\nwear away the enemy's army by a scrupulous and polite attention, than\r\nto violate the rules of decorum and the laws of hospitality by making an\r\nattack upon strangers in our own country!\" He gave Schuyler the news of\r\nWashington's defeat at the battle of Brandywine, and foretold the\r\nprobable loss of Philadelphia and a consequent winter campaign.\r\n\r\nIn ending he gave a thoroughly characteristic sketch of the occupations\r\nof himself and his colleagues. \"The chief justice (Jay) is gone to fetch\r\nhis wife. The chancellor (Livingston) is solacing himself with his wife,\r\nhis farm, and his imagination. Our senate is doing, I know not what. In\r\nassembly we wrangle long to little purpose.... We have some principles\r\nof fermentation which must, if it be possible, evaporate before business\r\nis entered upon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nIN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1777, while still but twenty-five years old, Morris was\r\nelected to the Continental Congress, and took his seat in that body at\r\nYorktown in the following January.\r\n\r\nHe was immediately appointed as one of a committee of five members to go\r\nto Washington's headquarters at Valley Forge and examine into the\r\ncondition of the continental troops.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful suffering of the American army in this winter camp was such\r\nthat its memory has literally eaten its way into the hearts of our\r\npeople, and it comes before our minds with a vividness that dims the\r\nremembrance of any other disaster. Washington's gaunt, half-starved\r\ncontinentals, shoeless and ragged, shivered in their crazy huts, worn\r\nout by want and illness, and by the bitter cold; while the members of\r\nthe Continental Congress not only failed to support them in the present,\r\nbut even grudged them the poor gift of a promise of half-pay in the\r\nfuture. Some of the delegates, headed by Samuel Adams, were actually\r\ncaballing against the great chief himself, the one hope of America.\r\nMeanwhile the States looked askance at each other, and each sunk into\r\nsupine indifference when its own borders were for the moment left\r\nunthreatened by the foe. Throughout the Revolutionary War our people\r\nhardly once pulled with a will together; although almost every locality\r\nin turn, on some one occasion, varied its lethargy by a spasm of\r\nterrible energy. Yet, again, it must be remembered that we were never\r\nmore to be dreaded than when our last hope seemed gone; and if the\r\npeople were unwilling to show the wisdom and self-sacrifice that would\r\nhave insured success, they were equally determined under no\r\ncircumstances whatever to acknowledge final defeat.\r\n\r\nTo Jay, with whom he was always intimate, Morris wrote in strong terms\r\nfrom Valley Forge, painting things as they were, but without a shadow of\r\ndoubt or distrust; for he by this time saw clearly enough that in\r\nAmerican warfare the darkest hour was often followed close indeed by\r\ndawn. \"The skeleton of an army presents itself to our eyes in a naked,\r\nstarving condition, out of health, out of spirits. But I have seen Fort\r\nGeorge in 1777.\" The last sentence refers to what he saw of Schuyler's\r\nforces, when affairs in New York State were at the blackest, just before\r\nthe tide began to turn against Burgoyne. He then went on to beseech Jay\r\nto exert himself to the utmost on the great question of taxation, the\r\nmost vital of all. Morris himself was so good a financier that\r\nrevolutionary financial economics drove him almost wild. The Continental\r\nCongress, of which he had just become a member, he did not esteem very\r\nhighly, and dismissed it, as well as the currency, as having \"both\r\ndepreciated.\" The State of Pennsylvania, he remarked, was \"sick unto\r\ndeath;\" and added that \"Sir William [the British general] would prove a\r\nmost damnable physician.\"\r\n\r\nMost wisely, in examining and reporting, he paid heed almost exclusively\r\nto Washington's recommendations, and the plan he and his colleagues\r\nproduced was little more than an enlargement of the general's\r\nsuggestions as to filling out the regiments, regulating rank, modeling\r\nthe various departments, etc. In fact, Morris now devoted himself to\r\nsecuring the approval of Congress for Washington's various plans.\r\n\r\nIn urging one of the most important of these he encountered very\r\ndetermined opposition. Washington was particularly desirous of securing\r\na permanent provision for the officers by the establishment of a system\r\nof half-pay, stating that without some such arrangement he saw no hope\r\nwhatever for the salvation of the cause; for as things then were the\r\nofficers were leaving day by day; and of those who went home on furlough\r\nto the Eastern and Southern States, many, instead of returning, went\r\ninto some lucrative employment. This fact, by the way, while showing the\r\ndifficulties with which Washington had to deal, and therefore his\r\ngreatness, since he successfully dealt with them, at the same time puts\r\nthe officers of the Revolution in no very favorable light as compared\r\nwith their descendants at the time of the great rebellion; and the\r\nContinental Congress makes a still worse showing.\r\n\r\nWhen Morris tried to push through a measure providing for half-pay for\r\nlife he was fought, tooth and nail, by many of his colleagues,\r\nincluding, to their lasting discredit be it said, every delegate from\r\nNew England. The folly of these ultra-democratic delegates almost passes\r\nbelief. They seemed incapable of learning how the fight for liberty\r\nshould be made. Their leaders, like Samuel Adams and John Hancock, did\r\nadmirable service in exciting the Americans to make the struggle; but\r\nonce it was begun, their function ended, and from thence onward they\r\nhampered almost as much as they helped the patriot cause. New England,\r\ntoo, had passed through the period when its patriotic fervor was at\r\nwhite heat. It still remained as resolute as ever; and if the danger had\r\nbeen once more brought home to its very door-sill, then it would have\r\nrisen again as it had risen before; but without the spur of an immediate\r\nnecessity it moved but sluggishly.\r\n\r\nThe New Englanders were joined by the South Carolina delegates. Morris\r\nwas backed by the members from New York, Virginia, and the other States,\r\nand he won the victory, but not without being obliged to accept\r\namendments that took away some of the good of the measure. Half-pay was\r\ngranted, but it was only to last for seven years after the close of the\r\nwar; and the paltry bounty of eighty dollars was to be given to every\r\nsoldier who served out his time to the end.\r\n\r\nAt the same period Morris was engaged on numerous other committees,\r\ndealing chiefly with the finances, or with the remedy of abuses that had\r\ncrept into the administration of the army. In one of his reports he\r\nexposed thoroughly the frightful waste in the purchase and distribution\r\nof supplies, and, what was much worse, the accompanying frauds. These\r\nfrauds had become a most serious evil; Jay, in one of his letters to\r\nMorris, had already urgently requested him to turn his attention\r\nespecially to stopping the officers, in particular those of the staff,\r\nfrom themselves engaging in trade, on account of the jobbing and\r\nswindling that it produced. The shoddy contractors of the Civil War had\r\nplenty of predecessors in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWhen these events occurred, in the spring of 1778, it was already three\r\nyears after the fight at Lexington; certainly, the continental armies of\r\nthat time do not compare favorably, even taking all difficulties into\r\naccount, with the Confederate forces which, in 1864, three years after\r\nthe fall of Sumter, fronted Grant and Sherman. The men of the Revolution\r\nfailed to show the capacity to organize for fighting purposes, and the\r\nability to bend all energies towards the attainment of a given end,\r\nwhich their great-grandsons of the Civil War, both at the North and the\r\nSouth, possessed. Yet, after all, their very follies sprang from their\r\nvirtues, from their inborn love of freedom, and their impatience of the\r\ncontrol of outsiders. So fierce had they been in their opposition to the\r\nrule of foreigners that they were now hardly willing to submit to being\r\nruled by themselves; they had seen power so abused that they feared its\r\nvery use; they were anxious to assert their independence of all mankind,\r\neven of each other. Stubborn, honest, and fearless, they were taught\r\nwith difficulty, and only by the grinding logic of an imperious\r\nnecessity, that it was no surrender of their freedom to submit to rulers\r\nchosen by themselves, through whom alone that freedom could be won. They\r\nhad not yet learned that right could be enforced only by might, that\r\nunion was to the full as important as liberty, because it was the\r\nprerequisite condition for the establishment and preservation of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nBut if the Americans of the Revolution were not perfect, how their\r\nfaults dwindle when we stand them side by side with their European\r\ncompeers! What European nation then brought forth rulers as wise and\r\npure as our statesmen, or masses as free and self-respecting as our\r\npeople? There was far more swindling, jobbing, cheating, and stealing in\r\nthe English army than in ours; the British king and his ministers need\r\nno criticism; and the outcome of the war proves that their nation as a\r\nwhole was less resolute than our own. As for the other European powers,\r\nthe faults of our leaders sink out of sight when matched against the\r\nferocious frivolity of the French noblesse, or the ignoble, sordid,\r\nbloody baseness of those swinish German kinglets who let out their\r\nsubjects to do hired murder, and battened on the blood and sweat of the\r\nwretched beings under them, until the whirlwind of the French Revolution\r\nswept their carcasses from off the world they cumbered.\r\n\r\nWe must needs give all honor to the men who founded our Commonwealth;\r\nonly in so doing let us remember that they brought into being a\r\ngovernment under which their children were to grow better and not worse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWashington at once recognized in Morris a man whom he could trust in\r\nevery way, and on whose help he could rely in other matters besides\r\ngetting his officers half-pay. The young New Yorker was one of the great\r\nVirginian's warmest supporters in Congress, and took the lead in\r\nchampioning his cause at every turn. He was the leader in putting down\r\nintrigues like that of the French-Irish adventurer Conway, his ready\r\ntongue and knowledge of parliamentary tactics, no less than his ability,\r\nrendering him the especial dread and dislike of the anti-Washington\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nWashington wrote to Morris very freely, and in one of his letters\r\ncomplained of the conduct of some of the officers who wished to resign\r\nwhen affairs looked dark and to be reinstated as soon as they\r\nbrightened a little. Morris replied with one of his bright caustic\r\nletters, sparing his associates very little, their pompous tediousness\r\nand hesitation being peculiarly galling to a man so far-seeing and so\r\nprompt to make up his mind. He wrote: \"We are going on with the\r\nregimental arrangements as fast as possible, and I think the day begins\r\nto appear with respect to that business. Had our Saviour addressed a\r\nchapter to the rulers of mankind, as he did many to the subjects, I am\r\npersuaded his good sense would have dictated this text: _Be not wise\r\novermuch_. Had the several members who compose our multifarious body\r\nbeen only wise _enough_, our business would long since have been\r\ncompleted. But our superior abilities, or the desire of appearing to\r\npossess them, lead us to such exquisite tediousness of debate that the\r\nmost precious moments pass unheeded away.... As to what you mention of\r\nthe extraordinary demeanor of some gentlemen, I cannot but agree with\r\nyou that such conduct is not the most _honorable_. But, on the other\r\nhand, you must allow that it is the most _safe_ and certainly you are\r\nnot to learn that, however ignorant of that happy art in your own\r\nperson, the bulk of us bipeds know well how to balance solid pudding\r\nagainst empty praise. There are other things, my dear sir, beside\r\nvirtue, which are their own _reward_.\"\r\n\r\nWashington chose Morris as his confidential friend and agent to bring\r\nprivately before Congress a matter in reference to which he did not\r\nconsider it politic to write publicly. He was at that time annoyed\r\nbeyond measure by the shoals of foreign officers who were seeking\r\nemployment in the army, and he wished Congress to stop giving them\r\nadmission to the service. These foreign officers were sometimes\r\nhonorable men, but more often adventurers; with two or three striking\r\nexceptions they failed to do as well as officers of native birth; and,\r\nas later in the Civil War, so in the Revolution, it appeared that\r\nAmericans could be best commanded by Americans. Washington had the\r\ngreatest dislike for these adventurers, stigmatizing them as \"men who in\r\nthe first instance tell you that they wish for nothing more than the\r\nhonor of serving in so glorious a cause as volunteers, the next day\r\nsolicit rank without pay, the day following want money advanced to them,\r\nand in the course of a week want further promotion, and are not\r\nsatisfied with anything you can do for them.\" He ended by writing: \"I do\r\nmost devoutly wish that we had not a single foreigner among us, except\r\nthe Marquis de Lafayette, who acts upon very different principles from\r\nthose which govern the rest.\" To Lafayette, indeed, America owes as much\r\nas to any of her own children, for his devotion to us was as\r\ndisinterested and sincere as it was effective; and it is a pleasant\r\nthing to remember that we, in our turn, not only repaid him materially,\r\nbut, what he valued far more, that our whole people yielded him all his\r\nlife long the most loving homage a man could receive. No man ever kept\r\npleasanter relations with a people he had helped than Lafayette did with\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMorris replied to Washington that he would do all in his power to aid\r\nhim. Meanwhile he had also contracted a very warm friendship for Greene,\r\nthen newly appointed quartermaster general of the army, and proved a\r\nmost useful ally, both in and out of Congress, in helping the general to\r\nget his department in good running order, and in extricating it from the\r\nfrightful confusion in which it had previously been plunged.\r\n\r\nHe also specially devoted himself at this time to an investigation of\r\nthe finances, which were in a dreadful condition; and by the ability\r\nwith which he performed his very varied duties he acquired such\r\nprominence that he was given the chairmanship of the most important of\r\nall the congressional committees. This was the committee to which was\r\nconfided the task of conferring with the British commissioners, who had\r\nbeen sent over, in the spring of 1778, to treat with the Americans, in\r\naccordance with the terms of what were known as Lord North's\r\nconciliatory bills. These bills were two in number, the first giving up\r\nthe right of taxation, about which the quarrel had originally arisen,\r\nand the second authorizing the commissioners to treat with the revolted\r\ncolonies on all questions in dispute. They were introduced in Parliament\r\non account of the little headway made by the British in subduing their\r\nformer subjects, and were pressed hastily through because of the fear of\r\nan American alliance with France, which was then, indeed, almost\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nThree years before, these bills would have achieved their end; but now\r\nthey came by just that much time too late. The embittered warfare had\r\nlasted long enough entirely to destroy the old friendly feelings; and\r\nthe Americans having once tasted the \"perilous pleasure\" of freedom,\r\nhaving once stretched out their arms and stood before the world's eyes\r\nas their own masters, it was certain that they would never forego their\r\nliberty, no matter with what danger it was fraught, no matter how light\r\nthe yoke, or how kindly the bondage, by which it was to be replaced.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the bills were received, Morris drew up and presented\r\nhis report, which was unanimously adopted by Congress. Its tenor can be\r\ngathered from its summing up, which declared that the indispensable\r\npreliminaries to any treaty would have to be the withdrawal of all the\r\nBritish fleets and armies, and the acknowledgment of the independence of\r\nthe United States; and it closed by calling on the several States to\r\nfurnish without delay their quotas of troops for the coming campaign.\r\n\r\nThis decisive stand was taken when America was still without allies in\r\nthe contest; but ten days afterwards messengers came to Congress,\r\nbearing copies of the treaty with France. It was ratified forthwith, and\r\nagain Morris was appointed chairman of a committee, this time to issue\r\nan address on the subject to the American people at large. He penned\r\nthis address himself, explaining fully the character of the crisis, and\r\ngoing briefly over the events that had led to it; and shortly afterwards\r\nhe drew up, on behalf of Congress, a sketch of all the proceedings in\r\nreference to the British commissioners, under the title of \"Observations\r\non the American Revolution,\" giving therein a masterly outline not only\r\nof the doings of Congress in the particular matter under consideration,\r\nbut also an account of the causes of the war, of the efforts of the\r\nAmericans to maintain peace, and of the chief events that had taken\r\nplace, as well as a comparison between the contrasting motives and aims\r\nof the contestants.\r\n\r\nMorris was one of the committee appointed to receive the French\r\nminister, M. Gerard. Immediately afterwards he was also selected by\r\nCongress to draft the instructions which were to be sent to Franklin,\r\nthe American minister at the court of Versailles. As a token of the\r\ncloseness of our relations with France, he was requested to show these\r\ninstructions to M. Gerard, which he accordingly did; and some\r\ninteresting features of the conversation between the two men have been\r\npreserved for us in the despatches of Gerard to the French court. The\r\nAmericans were always anxious to undertake the conquest of Canada,\r\nalthough Washington did not believe the scheme feasible; and the French\r\nstrongly, although secretly, opposed it, as it was their policy from the\r\nbeginning that Canada should remain English. Naturally the French did\r\nnot wish to see America transformed into a conquering power, a menace to\r\nthemselves and to the Spaniards as well as to the English; nor can they\r\nbe criticised for feeling in this way, or taunted with acting only from\r\nmotives of self-interest. It is doubtless true that their purposes in\r\ngoing into the war were mixed; they unquestionably wished to benefit\r\nthemselves, and to hurt their old and successful rival; but it is\r\nequally unquestionable that they were also moved by a generous spirit of\r\nsympathy and admiration for the struggling colonists. It would, however,\r\nhave been folly to let this sympathy blind them to the consequences that\r\nmight ensue to all Europeans having possessions in America, if the\r\nAmericans should become not only independent, but also aggressive; and\r\nit was too much to expect them to be so far-sighted as to see that, once\r\nindependent, it was against the very nature of things that the Americans\r\nshould _not_ be aggressive, and impossible that they should be aught but\r\npowerful and positive instruments, both in their own persons and by\r\ntheir example, in freeing the whole western continent from European\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nAccordingly M. Gerard endeavored, though without success, to prevail on\r\nMorris not to mention the question of an invasion of Canada in the\r\ninstructions to Franklin. He also warned the American of the danger of\r\nalarming Spain by manifesting a wish to encroach on its territory in the\r\nMississippi valley, mentioning and condemning the attitude taken by\r\nseveral members of Congress to the effect that the navigation of the\r\nMississippi should belong equally to the English and Americans.\r\n\r\nMorris's reply showed how little even the most intelligent American of\r\nthat time--especially if he came from the Northern or Eastern\r\nStates--could appreciate the destiny of his country. He stated that his\r\ncolleagues favored restricting the growth of our country to the south\r\nand west, and believed that the navigation of the Mississippi, from the\r\nOhio down, should belong exclusively to the Spaniards, as otherwise the\r\nwestern settlements springing up in the valley of the Ohio, and on the\r\nshores of the Great Lakes, would not only domineer over Spain, but also\r\nover the United States, and would certainly render themselves\r\nindependent in the end. He further said that some at least of those who\r\nwere anxious to secure the navigation of the Mississippi, were so from\r\ninterested motives, having money ventures in the establishments along\r\nthe river. However, if he at this time failed fully to grasp his\r\ncountry's future, he was later on one of the first in the Northern\r\nStates to recognize it; and once he did see it he promptly changed, and\r\nbecame the strongest advocate of our territorial expansion.\r\n\r\nAccompanying his instructions to Franklin, Morris sent a pamphlet\r\nentitled \"Observations on the Finances of America,\" to be laid before\r\nthe French ministry. Practically, all that the pamphlet amounted to was\r\na most urgent begging letter, showing that our own people could not, or\r\nwould not, either pay taxes, or take up a domestic loan, so that we\r\nstood in dire need of a subsidy from abroad. The drawing up of such a\r\ndocument could hardly have been satisfactory employment for a high\r\nspirited man who wished to be proud of his country.\r\n\r\nAll through our negotiations with France and England Morris's views\r\ncoincided with those of Washington, Hamilton, Jay, and the others who\r\nafterwards became leaders of the Federalist party. Their opinions were\r\nwell expressed by Jay in a letter to Morris written about this time,\r\nwhich ran: \"I view a return to the domination of Britain with horror,\r\nand would risk all for independence; but that point ceded, ... the\r\ndestruction of Old England would hurt me; I wish it well; it afforded my\r\nancestors an asylum from persecution.\" The rabid American adherents of\r\nFrance could not understand such sentiments, and the more mean spirited\r\namong them always tried to injure Morris on account of his loyalist\r\nrelatives, although so many families were divided in this same way,\r\nFranklin's only son being himself a prominent Tory. So bitter was this\r\nfeeling that when, later on, Morris's mother, who was within the\r\nBritish lines, became very ill, he actually had to give up his intended\r\nvisit to her, because of the furious clamor that was raised against it.\r\nHe refers bitterly, in one of his letters to Jay, to the \"malevolence of\r\nindividuals,\" as something he had to expect, but which he announced that\r\nhe would conquer by so living as to command the respect of those whose\r\nrespect was worth having.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, his foes were of sufficient importance to warrant his\r\npaying attention to them individually, Morris proved abundantly able to\r\ntake care of himself, and to deal heavier blows than he received. This\r\nwas shown in the controversy which convulsed Congress over the conduct\r\nof Silas Deane, the original American envoy to France. Deane did not\r\nbehave very well, but at first he was certainly much more sinned against\r\nthan sinning, and Morris took up his cause warmly. Thomas Paine, the\r\nfamous author of \"Common Sense,\" who was secretary of the Committee of\r\nForeign Affairs, attacked Deane and his defenders, as well as the court\r\nof France, with peculiar venom, using as weapons the secrets he became\r\nacquainted with through his official position, and which he was in honor\r\nbound not to divulge. For this Morris had him removed from his\r\nsecretaryship, and in the debate handled him extremely roughly,\r\ncharacterizing him with contemptuous severity as \"a mere adventurer from\r\nEngland ... ignorant even of grammar,\" and ridiculing his pretensions to\r\nimportance. Paine was an adept in the art of invective; but he came out\r\nsecond best in this encounter, and never forgot or forgave his\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, Morris was kept too busily at work to spare time for\r\naltercations. He was chairman of three important standing committees,\r\nthose on the commissary, quartermaster's, and medical departments, and\r\ndid the whole business for each. He also had more than his share of\r\nspecial committee work, besides playing his full part in the debates and\r\nconsultations of the Congress itself. Moreover, his salary was so small\r\nthat he had to eke it out by the occasional practice of his profession.\r\nHe devoted himself especially to the consideration of our finances and\r\nof our foreign relations; and, as he grew constantly to possess more and\r\nmore weight and influence in Congress, he was appointed, early in 1779,\r\nas chairman of a very important committee, which was to receive\r\ncommunications from our ministers abroad, as well as from the French\r\nenvoy. He drew out its report, together with the draft of instructions\r\nto our foreign ministers, which it recommended. Congress accepted the\r\nfirst, and adopted the last, without change, whereby it became the\r\nbasis of the treaty by which we finally won peace. In his draft he had\r\nbeen careful not to bind down our representatives on minor points, and\r\nto leave them as large liberty of action as was possible; but the main\r\nissues, such as the boundaries, the navigation of the Mississippi, and\r\nthe fisheries, were discussed at length and in order.\r\n\r\nAt the time this draft of instructions for a treaty was sent out there\r\nwas much demand among certain members in Congress that we should do all\r\nin our power to make foreign alliances, and to procure recognitions of\r\nour independence in every possible quarter. To this Morris was heartily\r\nopposed, deeming that this \"rage for treaties,\" as he called it, was not\r\nvery dignified on our part. He held rightly that our true course was to\r\ngo our own gait, without seeking outside favor, until we had shown\r\nourselves able to keep our own place among nations, when the\r\nrecognitions would come without asking. Whether European nations\r\nrecognized us as a free people, or not, was of little moment so long as\r\nwe ourselves knew that we had become one in law and in fact, through the\r\nright of battle and the final arbitrament of the sword.\r\n\r\nBesides these questions of national policy, Morris also had to deal with\r\nan irritating matter affecting mainly New York. This was the dispute of\r\nthat state with the people of Vermont, who wished to form a separate\r\ncommonwealth of their own, while New York claimed that their lands came\r\nwithin its borders. Even the fear of their common foe, the British,\r\nagainst whom they needed to employ their utmost strength, was barely\r\nsufficient to prevent the two communities from indulging in a small\r\ncivil war of their own; and they persisted in pressing their rival\r\nclaims upon the attention of Congress, and clamoring for a decision from\r\nthat harassed and overburdened body. Clinton, who was much more of a\r\npolitician than a statesman, led the popular party in this foolish\r\nbusiness, the majority of the New Yorkers being apparently nearly as\r\nenthusiastic in asserting their sovereignty over Vermont as they were in\r\ndeclaring their independence of Britain. Morris, however, was very\r\nhalf-hearted in pushing the affair before Congress. He doubted if\r\nCongress had the power, and he knew it lacked the will, to move in the\r\nmatter at all; and besides he did not sympathize with the position taken\r\nby his State. He was wise enough to see that the Vermonters had much of\r\nthe right on their side in addition to the great fact of possession; and\r\nthat New York would be probably unable to employ force enough to conquer\r\nthem. Clinton was a true type of the separatist or states-rights\r\npolitician of that day: he cared little how the national weal was\r\naffected by the quarrel; and he was far more anxious to bluster than to\r\nfight over the matter, to which end he kept besieging the delegates in\r\nCongress with useless petitions. In a letter to him Morris put the case\r\nwith his usual plainness, telling him that it was perfectly idle to keep\r\nworrying Congress to take action, for it would certainly not do so, and\r\nif it did render a decision, the Vermonters would no more respect it\r\nthan they would the Pope's Bull. He went on to show his characteristic\r\ncontempt for half-measures, and capacity for striking straight at the\r\nroot of things: \"Either let these people alone, or conquer them. I\r\nprefer the latter; but I doubt the means. If we have the means let them\r\nbe used, and let Congress deliberate and decide, or deliberate without\r\ndeciding,--it is of no consequence. Success will sanctify every\r\noperation.... If we have not the means of conquering these people we\r\nmust let them alone. We must continue our impotent threats, or we must\r\nmake a treaty.... If we continue our threats they will either hate or\r\ndespise us, and perhaps both.... On the whole, then, my conclusion is\r\nhere, as on most other human affairs, act decisively, fight or\r\nsubmit--conquer or treat.\" Morris was right; the treaty was finally\r\nmade, and Vermont became an independent State.\r\n\r\nBut the small politicians of New York would not forgive him for the\r\nwisdom and the broad feeling of nationality he showed on this and so\r\nmany other questions; and they defeated him when he was a candidate for\r\nreelection to Congress at the end of 1779. The charge they urged against\r\nhim was that he devoted his time wholly to the service of the nation at\r\nlarge, and not to that of New York in particular; his very devotion to\r\nthe public business, which had kept him from returning to the State,\r\nbeing brought forward to harm him. Arguments of this kind are common\r\nenough even at the present day, and effective too, among that numerous\r\nclass of men with narrow minds and selfish hearts. Many an able and\r\nupright Congressman since Morris has been sacrificed because his\r\nconstituents found he was fitted to do the exact work needed; because he\r\nshowed himself capable of serving the whole nation, and did not devote\r\nhis time to advancing the interests of only a portion thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFINANCES: THE TREATY OF PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1779 Morris was thus retired to private life; and, having\r\nby this time made many friends in Philadelphia, he took up his abode in\r\nthat city. His leaving Congress was small loss to himself, as that body\r\nwas rapidly sinking into a condition of windy decrepitude.\r\n\r\nHe at once began working at his profession, and also threw himself with\r\neager zest into every attainable form of gayety and amusement, for he\r\nwas of a most pleasure-loving temperament, very fond of society, and a\r\ngreat favorite in the little American world of wit and fashion. But\r\nalthough in private life, he nevertheless kept his grip on public\r\naffairs, and devoted himself to the finances, which were in a most\r\nwretched state. He could not keep out of public life; he probably agreed\r\nwith Jay, who, on hearing that he was again a private citizen, wrote him\r\nto \"remember that Achilles made no figure at the spinning-wheel.\" At any\r\nrate, as early as February, 1780, he came to the front once more as the\r\nauthor of a series of essays on the finances. They were published in\r\nPhiladelphia, and attracted the attention of all thinking men by their\r\nsoundness. In fact it was in our monetary affairs that the key to the\r\nsituation was to be found; for, had we been willing to pay honestly and\r\npromptly the necessary war expenses, we should have ended the struggle\r\nin short order. But the niggardliness as well as the real poverty, of\r\nthe people, the jealousies of the states, kept aflame by the\r\nstates-rights leaders for their own selfish purposes, and the foolish\r\nideas of most of the congressional delegates on all money matters,\r\ncombined to keep our treasury in a pitiable condition.\r\n\r\nMorris tried to show the people at large the advantage of submitting to\r\nreasonable taxation, while at the same time combating some of the\r\ntheories entertained as well by themselves as by their congressional\r\nrepresentatives. He began by discussing with great clearness what money\r\nreally is, how far coin can be replaced by paper, the interdependence of\r\nmoney and credit, and other elementary points in reference to which most\r\nof his fellow-citizens seemed to possess wonderfully mixed ideas. He\r\nattacked the efforts of Congress to make their currency legal tender;\r\nand then showed the utter futility of one of the pet schemes of\r\nrevolutionary financial wisdom, the regulation of prices by law. Hard\r\ntimes, then as now, always produced not only a large debtor class, but\r\nalso a corresponding number of political demagogues who truckled to it;\r\nand both demagogue and debtor, when they clamored for laws which should\r\n\"relieve\" the latter, meant thereby laws which would enable him to\r\nswindle his creditor. The people, moreover, liked to lay the blame for\r\ntheir misfortunes neither on fate nor on themselves, but on some\r\nunfortunate outsider; and they were especially apt to attack as\r\n\"monopolists\" the men who had purchased necessary supplies in large\r\nquantities to profit by their rise in price. Accordingly they passed\r\nlaws against them; and Morris showed in his essays the unwisdom of such\r\nlegislation, while not defending for a moment the men who looked on the\r\nmisfortunes of their country solely as offering a field for their own\r\nharvesting.\r\n\r\nHe ended by drawing out an excellent scheme of taxation; but,\r\nunfortunately, the people were too short-sighted to submit to any\r\nmeasure of the sort, no matter how wise and necessary. One of the pleas\r\nhe made for his scheme was, that something of the sort would be\r\nabsolutely necessary for the preservation of the Federal Union, \"which,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"in my poor opinion, will greatly depend upon the management\r\nof the revenue.\" He showed with his usual clearness the need of\r\nobtaining, for financial as well as for all other reasons, a firmer\r\nunion, as the existing confederation bade fair to become, as its enemies\r\nhad prophesied, a rope of sand. He also foretold graphically the misery\r\nthat would ensue--and that actually did ensue--when the pressure from a\r\nforeign foe should cease, and the states should be resolved into a\r\ndisorderly league of petty, squabbling communities. In ending he\r\nremarked bitterly: \"The articles of confederation were formed when the\r\nattachment to Congress was warm and great. The framers of them,\r\ntherefore, seem to have been only solicitous how to provide against the\r\npower of that body, which, by means of their foresight and care, now\r\nexists by mere courtesy and sufferance.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Morris was not able to convert Congress to the ways of sound\r\nthinking, his ability and clearness impressed themselves on all the best\r\nmen; notably on Robert Morris,--who was no relation of his, by the\r\nway,--the first in the line of American statesmen who have been great in\r\nfinance; a man whose services to our treasury stand on a par, if not\r\nwith those of Hamilton, at least with those of Gallatin and John\r\nSherman. Congress had just established four departments, with\r\nsecretaries at the head of each. The two most important were the\r\nDepartments of Foreign Affairs and of Finance. Livingstone was given the\r\nformer, while Robert Morris received the latter; and immediately\r\nafterwards appointed Gouverneur Morris as Assistant Financier, at a\r\nsalary of eighteen hundred and fifty dollars a year.\r\n\r\nMorris accepted this appointment, and remained in office for three years\r\nand a half, until the beginning of 1785. He threw himself heart and soul\r\ninto the work, helping his chief in every way; and in particular giving\r\nhim invaluable assistance in the establishment of the \"Bank of North\r\nAmerica,\" which Congress was persuaded to incorporate,--an institution\r\nwhich was the first of its kind in the country. It was of wonderful\r\neffect in restoring the public credit, and was absolutely invaluable in\r\nthe financial operations undertaken by the secretary.\r\n\r\nWhen, early in 1782, the secretary was directed by Congress, to present\r\nto that body a report on the foreign coins circulating in the country,\r\nit was prepared and sent in by Gouverneur Morris, and he accompanied it\r\nwith a plan for an American coinage. The postscript was the really\r\nimportant part of the document, and the plan therein set forth was made\r\nthe basis of our present coinage system, although not until several\r\nyears later, and then only with important modifications, suggested, for\r\nthe most part, by Jefferson.\r\n\r\nAlthough his plan was modified, it still remains true that Gouverneur\r\nMorris was the founder of our national coinage. He introduced the system\r\nof decimal notation, invented the word \"cent\" to express one of the\r\nsmaller coins, and nationalized the already familiar word \"dollar.\" His\r\nplan, however, was a little too abstruse for the common mind, the unit\r\nbeing made so small that a large sum would have had to be expressed in a\r\nvery great number of figures, and there being five or six different\r\nkinds of new coins, some of them not simple multiples of each other.\r\nAfterwards he proposed as a modification a system of pounds, or dollars,\r\nand doits, the doit answering to our present mill, while providing also\r\nan ingenious arrangement by which the money of account was to differ\r\nfrom the money of coinage. Jefferson changed the system by grafting on\r\nit the dollar as a unit, and simplifying it; and Hamilton perfected it\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nTo understand the advantage, as well as the boldness, of Morris's\r\nscheme, we must keep in mind the horrible condition of our currency at\r\nthat time. We had no proper coins of our own; nothing but hopelessly\r\ndepreciated paper bills, a mass of copper, and some clipped and\r\ncounterfeited gold and silver coin from the mints of England, France,\r\nSpain, and even Germany. Dollars, pounds, shillings, doubloons, ducats,\r\nmoidores, joes, crowns, pistareens, coppers, and sous, circulated\r\nindifferently, and with various values in each colony. A dollar was\r\nworth six shillings in Massachusetts, eight in New York, seven and\r\nsixpence in Pennsylvania, six again in Virginia, eight again in North\r\nCarolina, thirty-two and a half in South Carolina, and five in Georgia.\r\nThe government itself had to resort to clipping in one of its most\r\ndesperate straits; and at last people would only take payment by weight\r\nof gold or silver.\r\n\r\nMorris, in his report, dwelt especially on three points: first, that the\r\nnew money should be easily intelligible to the multitude, and should,\r\ntherefore, bear a close relation to the coins already existing, as\r\notherwise its sudden introduction would bring business to a stand-still;\r\nand would excite distrust and suspicion everywhere, particularly among\r\nthe poorest and most ignorant, the day-laborers, the farm servants, and\r\nthe hired help. Second, that its lowest divisible sum, or unit, should\r\nbe very small, so that the price and the value of little things could be\r\nmade proportionate; and third, that as far as possible the money should\r\nincrease in decimal ratio. The Spanish dollar was the coin most widely\r\ncirculated, while retaining everywhere about the same value. Accordingly\r\nhe took this, and then sought for a unit that would go evenly into it,\r\nas well as into the various shillings, disregarding the hopelessly\r\naberrant shilling of South Carolina. Such a unit was a quarter of a\r\ngrain of pure silver, equal to the one fourteen hundred and fortieth\r\npart of a dollar; it was not, of course, necessary to have it exactly\r\nrepresented in coin. On the contrary, he proposed to strike two copper\r\npieces, respectively of five and eight units, to be known as _fives_ and\r\n_eights_. Two _eights_ would then make a penny in Pennsylvania, and\r\nthree _eights_ one in Georgia, while three _fives_ would make one in New\r\nYork, and four would make one in Massachusetts. Morris's great aim was,\r\nwhile establishing uniform coins for the entire Union, to get rid of the\r\nfractional remainders in translating the old currencies into the new;\r\nand in addition his reckoning adapted itself to the different systems in\r\nthe different states, as well as to the different coins in use. But he\r\nintroduced an entirely new system of coinage, and moreover used therein\r\nthe names of several old coins while giving them new values. His\r\noriginally proposed table of currency was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  One crown = ten dollars, or   10,000 units.\r\n  One dollar = ten bills, or     1,000  \"\r\n  One bill = ten pence, or         100  \"\r\n  One penny = ten quarters, or      10  \"\r\n  One quarter =                      1  \"\r\n\r\nBut he proposed that for convenience other coins should be struck, like\r\nthe copper _five_ and _eight_ above spoken of, and he afterwards altered\r\nhis names. He then called the bill of one hundred units a _cent_, making\r\nit consist of twenty-five grains of silver and two of copper, being thus\r\nthe lowest silver coin. Five _cents_ were to make a _quint_, and ten a\r\n_mark_.\r\n\r\nCongress, according to its custom, received the report, applauded it,\r\nand did nothing in the matter. Shortly afterwards, however, Jefferson\r\ntook it up, when the whole subject was referred to a committee of which\r\nhe was a member. He highly approved of Morris's plan, and took from it\r\nthe idea of a decimal system, and the use of the words \"dollar\" and\r\n\"cent.\" But he considered Morris's unit too small, and preferred to take\r\nas his own the Spanish dollar, which was already known to all the\r\npeople, its value being uniform and well understood. Then, by keeping\r\nstrictly to the decimal system, and dividing the dollar into one hundred\r\nparts, he got cents for our fractional currency. He thus introduced a\r\nsimpler system than that of Morris, with an existing and\r\nwell-understood unit, instead of an imaginary one that would have to be,\r\nfor the first time, brought to the knowledge of the people, and which\r\nmight be adopted only with reluctance. On the other hand, Jefferson's\r\nsystem failed entirely to provide for the extension of the old\r\ncurrencies in the terms of the new without the use of fractions. On this\r\naccount Morris vehemently opposed it, but it was nevertheless adopted.\r\nHe foretold, what actually came to pass, that the people would be very\r\nreluctant to throw away their local moneys in order to take up a general\r\nmoney which bore no special relation to them. For half a century\r\nafterwards the people clung to their absurd shillings and sixpences, the\r\ngovernment itself, in its post-office transactions, being obliged to\r\nrecognize the obsolete terms in vogue in certain localities. Some\r\ncurious pieces circulated freely up to the time of the Civil War. Still,\r\nJefferson's plan worked admirably in the end.\r\n\r\nAll the time he was working so hard at the finances, Morris nevertheless\r\ncontinued to enjoy himself to the full in the society of Philadelphia.\r\nImperious, light-hearted, good-looking, well-dressed, he ranked as a wit\r\namong men, as a beau among women. He was equally sought for dances and\r\ndinners. He was a fine scholar and a polished gentleman; a capital\r\nstory-teller; and had just a touch of erratic levity that served to\r\nrender him still more charming. Occasionally he showed whimsical\r\npeculiarities, usually about very small things, that brought him into\r\ntrouble; and one such freak cost him a serious injury. In his capacity\r\nof young man of fashion, he used to drive about town in a phaeton with a\r\npair of small, spirited horses; and because of some whim, he would not\r\nallow the groom to stand at their heads. So one day they took fright,\r\nran, threw him out, and broke his leg. The leg had to be amputated, and\r\nhe was ever afterwards forced to wear a wooden one. However, he took his\r\nloss with most philosophic cheerfulness, and even bore with equanimity\r\nthe condolences of those exasperating individuals, of a species by no\r\nmeans peculiar to revolutionary times, who endeavored to prove to him\r\nthe manifest falsehood that such an accident was \"all for the best.\" To\r\none of these dreary gentlemen he responded, with disconcerting vivacity,\r\nthat his visitor had so handsomely argued the advantage of being\r\nentirely legless as to make him almost tempted to part with his\r\nremaining limb; and to another he announced that at least there was the\r\ncompensation that he would be a _steadier_ man with one leg than with\r\ntwo. Wild accounts of the accident got about, which rather irritated\r\nhim, and in answer to a letter from Jay he wrote: \"I suppose it was\r\nDeane who wrote to you from France about the loss of my leg. His account\r\nis facetious. Let it pass. The leg is gone, and there is an end of the\r\nmatter.\" His being crippled did not prevent him from going about in\r\nsociety very nearly as much as ever; and society in Philadelphia was at\r\nthe moment gayer than in any other American city. Indeed Jay, a man of\r\nPuritanic morality, wrote to Morris somewhat gloomily to inquire about\r\n\"the rapid progress of luxury at Philadelphia;\" to which his younger\r\nfriend, who highly appreciated the good things of life, replied\r\nlight-heartedly: \"With respect to our taste for luxury, do not grieve\r\nabout it. Luxury is not so bad a thing as it is often supposed to be;\r\nand if it were, still we must follow the course of things, and turn to\r\nadvantage what exists, since we have not the power to annihilate or\r\ncreate. The very definition of 'luxury' is as difficult as the\r\nsuppression of it.\" In another letter he remarked that he thought there\r\nwere quite as many knaves among the men who went on foot as there were\r\namong those who drove in carriages.\r\n\r\nJay at this time, having been successively a member of the Continental\r\nCongress, the New York Legislature, and the State Constitutional\r\nConvention, having also been the first chief justice of his native\r\nstate, and then president of the Continental Congress, had been sent as\r\nour minister to Spain. Morris always kept up an intimate correspondence\r\nwith him. It is noticeable that the three great revolutionary statesmen\r\nfrom New York, Hamilton, Jay, and Morris, always kept on good terms, and\r\nalways worked together; while the friendship between two, Jay and\r\nMorris, was very close.\r\n\r\nThe two men, in their correspondence, now and then touched on other than\r\nstate matters. One of Jay's letters which deals with the education of\r\nhis children would be most healthful reading for those Americans of the\r\npresent day who send their children to be brought up abroad in Swiss\r\nschools, or English and German universities. He writes: \"I think the\r\nyouth of every free, civilized country should be educated in it, and not\r\npermitted to travel out of it until age has made them so cool and firm\r\nas to retain their national and moral impressions. American youth may\r\npossibly form proper and perhaps useful friendships in European\r\nseminaries, but I think not so _probably_ as among their\r\nfellow-citizens, with whom they are to grow up, whom it will be useful\r\nfor them to know and be early known to, and with whom they are to be\r\nengaged in the business of active life.... I do not hesitate to prefer\r\nan American education.\" The longer Jay stayed away, the more devoted he\r\nbecame to America. He had a good, hearty, honest contempt for the\r\nmiserable \"cosmopolitanism\" so much affected by the feebler folk of\r\nfashion. As he said he \"could never become so far a citizen of the world\r\nas to view every part of it with equal regard,\" for \"his affections were\r\ndeep-rooted in America,\" and he always asserted that he had never seen\r\nanything in Europe to cause him to abate his prejudices in favor of his\r\nown land.\r\n\r\nJay had a very hard time at the Spanish court, which, he wrote Morris,\r\nhad \"little money, less wisdom, and no credit.\" Spain, although fighting\r\nEngland, was bitterly jealous of the United States, fearing most justly\r\nour aggressive spirit, and desiring to keep the lower Mississippi valley\r\nentirely under its own control. Jay, a statesman of intensely national\r\nspirit, was determined to push our boundaries as far westward as\r\npossible; he insisted on their reaching to the Mississippi, and on our\r\nhaving the right to navigate that stream. Morris did not agree with him,\r\nand on this subject, as has been already said, he for once showed less\r\nthan his usual power of insight into the future. He wrote Jay that it\r\nwas absurd to quarrel about a country inhabited only by red men, and to\r\nclaim \"a territory we cannot occupy, a navigation we cannot enjoy.\" He\r\nalso ventured the curiously false prediction that, if the territory\r\nbeyond the Alleghanies should ever be filled up, it would be by a\r\npopulation drawn from the whole world, not one hundredth part of it\r\nAmerican, which would immediately become an independent and rival\r\nnation. However, he could not make Jay swerve a handsbreadth from his\r\nposition about our western boundaries; though on every other point the\r\ntwo were in hearty accord.\r\n\r\nIn relating and forecasting the military situation, Morris was more\r\nhappy. He was peculiarly interested in Greene, and from the outset\r\nforetold the final success of his Southern campaign. In a letter written\r\nMarch 31, 1781, after the receipt of the news of the battle of Guilford\r\nCourt-house, he describes to Jay Greene's forces and prospects. His\r\ntroops included, he writes, \"from 1,500 to 2,000 continentals, many of\r\nthem raw, and somewhat more of militia than regular troops,--the whole\r\nof these almost in a state of nature, and of whom it ought to be said,\r\nas by Hamlet to Horatio, 'Thou hast no other revenue but thy good\r\nspirits to feed and clothe thee.'\" The militia he styled the \"_fruges\r\nconsumere nati_ of an army.\" He then showed the necessity of the battle\r\nbeing fought, on account of the fluctuating state of the militia, the\r\nincapacity of the state governments to help themselves, the poverty of\r\nthe country (\"so that the very teeth of the enemy defend them,\r\nespecially in retreat,\"), and above all, because a defeat was of little\r\nconsequence to us, while it would ruin the enemy. He wrote: \"There is no\r\nloss in fighting away two or three hundred men who would go home if they\r\nwere not put in the way of being knocked on the head.... These are\r\nunfeeling reflections. I would apologize for them to any one who did not\r\nknow that I have at least enough of sensibility. The gush of sentiment\r\nwill not alter the nature of things, and the business of the statesman\r\nis more to reason than to feel.\" Morris was always confident that we\r\nshould win in the end, and sometimes thought a little punishment really\r\ndid our people good. When Cornwallis was in Virginia he wrote: \"The\r\nenemy are scourging the Virginians, at least those of Lower Virginia.\r\nThis is distressing, but will have some good consequences. In the mean\r\ntime the delegates of Virginia make as many lamentations as ever\r\nJeremiah did, and to as good purpose perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nThe war was drawing to an end. Great Britain had begun the struggle with\r\neverything--allies, numbers, wealth--in her favor; but now, towards the\r\nclose, the odds were all the other way. The French were struggling with\r\nher on equal terms for the mastery of the seas; the Spaniards were\r\nhelping the French, and were bending every energy to carry through\r\nsuccessfully the great siege of Gibraltar; the Dutch had joined their\r\nancient enemies, and their fleet fought a battle with the English,\r\nwhich, for bloody indecisiveness, rivaled the actions when Van Tromp and\r\nDe Ruyter held the Channel against Blake and Monk. In India the name of\r\nHyder Ali had become a very nightmare of horror to the British. In\r\nAmerica, the centre of the war, the day had gone conclusively against\r\nthe Island folk. Greene had doggedly fought and marched his way through\r\nthe Southern States with his ragged, under-fed, badly armed troops; he\r\nhad been beaten in three obstinate battles, had each time inflicted a\r\ngreater relative loss than he received, and, after retiring in good\r\norder a short distance, had always ended by pursuing his lately\r\nvictorious foes; at the close of the campaign he had completely\r\nreconquered the Southern States by sheer capacity for standing\r\npunishment, and had cooped up the remaining British force in\r\nCharleston. In the Northern States the British held Newport and New\r\nYork, but could not penetrate elsewhere; while at Yorktown their ablest\r\ngeneral was obliged to surrender his whole army to the overwhelming\r\nforce brought against him by Washington's masterly strategy.\r\n\r\nYet England, hemmed in by the ring of her foes, fronted them all with a\r\ngrand courage. In her veins the Berserker blood was up, and she hailed\r\neach new enemy with grim delight, exerting to the full her warlike\r\nstrength. Single-handed she kept them all at bay, and repaid with\r\ncrippling blows the injuries they had done her. In America alone the\r\ntide ran too strongly to be turned. But Holland was stripped of all her\r\ncolonies; in the East, Sir Eyre Coote beat down Hyder Ali, and taught\r\nMoslem and Hindoo alike that they could not shake off the grasp of the\r\niron hands that held India. Rodney won back for his country the\r\nsupremacy of the ocean in that great sea-fight where he shattered the\r\nsplendid French navy; and the long siege of Gibraltar closed with the\r\ncrushing overthrow of the assailants. So, with bloody honor, England\r\nended the most disastrous war she had ever waged.\r\n\r\nThe war had brought forth many hard fighters, but only one great\r\ncommander,--Washington. For the rest, on land, Cornwallis, Greene,\r\nRawdon, and possibly Lafayette and Rochambeau, might all rank as fairly\r\ngood generals, probably in the order named, although many excellent\r\ncritics place Greene first. At sea Rodney and the Bailli de Suffren won\r\nthe honors; the latter stands beside Duquesne and Tourville in the roll\r\nof French admirals; while Rodney was a true latter-day buccaneer, as\r\nfond of fighting as of plundering, and a first-rate hand at both.\r\nNeither ranks with such mighty sea-chiefs as Nelson, nor yet with Blake,\r\nFarragut, or Tegethof.\r\n\r\nAll parties were tired of the war; peace was essential to all. But of\r\nall, America was most resolute to win what she had fought for; and\r\nAmerica had been the most successful so far. English historians--even so\r\ngenerally impartial a writer as Mr. Lecky--are apt greatly to exaggerate\r\nour relative exhaustion, and try to prove it by quoting from the\r\nAmerican leaders every statement that shows despondency and suffering.\r\nIf they applied the same rule to their own side, they would come to the\r\nconclusion that the British empire was at that time on the brink of\r\ndissolution. Of course we had suffered very heavily, and had blundered\r\nbadly; but in both respects we were better off than our antagonists. Mr.\r\nLecky is right in bestowing unstinted praise on our diplomatists for\r\nthe hardihood and success with which they insisted on all our demands\r\nbeing granted; but he is wrong when he says or implies that the military\r\nsituation did not warrant their attitude. Of all the contestants,\r\nAmerica was the most willing to continue the fight rather than yield her\r\nrights. Morris expressed the general feeling when he wrote to Jay, on\r\nAugust 6, 1782: \"Nobody will be thankful for any peace but a very good\r\none. This _they_ should have thought on who made war with the Republic.\r\nI am among the number who would be extremely ungrateful for the grant of\r\na bad peace. My public and private character will both concert to render\r\nthe sentiment coming from me unsuspected. Judge, then, of others, judge\r\nof the many-headed fool who can feel no more than his own sorrowing....\r\nI wish that while the war lasts it may be real war, and that when peace\r\ncomes it may be real peace.\" As to our military efficiency, we may take\r\nWashington's word (in a letter to Jay of October 18, 1782): \"I am\r\ncertain it will afford you pleasure to know that our army is better\r\norganized, disciplined, and clothed than it has been at any period since\r\nthe commencement of the war. This you may be assured is the fact.\"\r\n\r\nAnother mistake of English historians--again likewise committed by Mr.\r\nLecky--comes in their laying so much stress on the help rendered to the\r\nAmericans by their allies, while at the same time speaking as if England\r\nhad none. As a matter of fact, England would have stood no chance at all\r\nhad the contest been strictly confined to British troops on the one\r\nhand, and to the rebellious colonists on the other. There were more\r\nGerman auxiliaries in the British ranks than there were French allies in\r\nthe American; the loyalists, including the regularly enlisted loyalists\r\nas well as the militia who took part in the various Tory uprisings, were\r\nprobably more numerous still. The withdrawal of all Hessians, Tories,\r\nand Indians from the British army would have been cheaply purchased by\r\nthe loss of our own foreign allies.\r\n\r\nThe European powers were even a shade more anxious for peace than we\r\nwere; and to conduct the negotiations for our side, we chose three of\r\nour greatest statesmen,--Franklin, Adams, and Jay.\r\n\r\nCongress, in appointing our commissioners, had, with little regard for\r\nthe national dignity, given them instructions which, if obeyed, would\r\nhave rendered them completely subservient to France; for they were\r\ndirected to undertake nothing in the negotiations without the knowledge\r\nand concurrence of the French cabinet, and in all decisions to be\r\nultimately governed by the advice of that body. Morris fiercely\r\nresented such servile subservience, and in a letter to Jay denounced\r\nCongress with well-justified warmth, writing: \"That the proud should\r\nprostitute the very little dignity this poor country is possessed of\r\nwould be indeed astounding, if we did not know the near alliance between\r\npride and meanness. Men who have too little spirit to demand of their\r\nconstituents that they do their duty, who have sufficient humility to\r\nbeg a paltry pittance at the hands of any and every sovereign,--such men\r\nwill always be ready to pay the price which vanity shall demand from the\r\nvain.\" Jay promptly persuaded his colleagues to unite with him in\r\ndisregarding the instructions of Congress on this point; had he not done\r\nso, the dignity of our government would, as he wrote Morris, \"have been\r\nin the dust.\" Franklin was at first desirous of yielding obedience to\r\nthe command; but Adams immediately joined Jay in repudiating it.\r\n\r\nWe had waged war against Britain, with France and Spain as allies; but\r\nin making peace we had to strive for our rights against our friends\r\nalmost as much as against our enemies. There was much generous and\r\ndisinterested enthusiasm for America among Frenchmen individually; but\r\nthe French government, with which alone we were to deal in making\r\npeace, had acted throughout from purely selfish motives, and in reality\r\ndid not care an atom for American rights. We owed France no more\r\ngratitude for taking our part than she owed us for giving her an\r\nopportunity of advancing her own interests, and striking a severe blow\r\nat an old-time enemy and rival. As for Spain, she disliked us quite as\r\nmuch as she did England.\r\n\r\nThe peace negotiations brought all this out very clearly. The great\r\nFrench minister Vergennes, who dictated the policy of his court all\r\nthrough the contest, cared nothing for the revolutionary colonists\r\nthemselves; but he was bent upon securing them their independence, so as\r\nto weaken England, and he was also bent upon keeping them from gaining\r\ntoo much strength, so that they might always remain dependent allies of\r\nFrance. He wished to establish the \"balance of power\" system in America.\r\nThe American commissioners he at first despised for their blunt,\r\ntruthful straightforwardness, which he, trained in the school of deceit,\r\nand a thorough believer in every kind of finesse and double-dealing,\r\nmistook for boorishness; later on, he learned to his chagrin that they\r\nwere able as well as honest, and that their resolution, skill, and\r\nfar-sightedness made them, where their own deepest interests were\r\nconcerned, over-matches for the subtle diplomats of Europe.\r\n\r\nAmerica, then, was determined to secure not only independence, but also\r\na chance to grow into a great continental nation; she wished her\r\nboundaries fixed at the great lakes and the Mississippi; she also asked\r\nfor the free navigation of the latter to the Gulf, and for a share in\r\nthe fisheries. Spain did not even wish that we should be made\r\nindependent; she hoped to be compensated at our expense, for her failure\r\nto take Gibraltar; and she desired that we should be kept so weak as to\r\nhinder us from being aggressive. Her fear of us, by the way, was\r\nperfectly justifiable, for the greatest part of our present territory\r\nlies within what were nominally Spanish limits a hundred years ago.\r\nFrance, as the head of a great coalition, wanted to keep on good terms\r\nwith both her allies; but, as Gerard, the French minister at Washington,\r\nsaid: if France had to choose between the two, \"the decision would not\r\nbe in favor of the United States.\" She wished to secure for America\r\nindependence, but she wished also to keep the new nation so weak that it\r\nwould \"feel the need of sureties, allies, and protectors.\" France\r\ndesired to exclude our people from the fisheries, to deprive us of half\r\nour territories by making the Alleghanies our western boundaries, and\r\nto secure to Spain the undisputed control of the navigation of the\r\nMississippi. It was not to the interest of France and Spain that we\r\nshould be a great and formidable people, and very naturally they would\r\nnot help us to become one. There is no need of blaming them for their\r\nconduct; but it would have been rank folly to have been guided by their\r\nwishes. Our true policy was admirably summed up by Jay in his letters to\r\nLivingston, where he says: \"Let us be honest and grateful to France, but\r\nlet us think for ourselves.... Since we have assumed a place in the\r\npolitical firmament, let us move like a primary and not a secondary\r\nplanet.\" Fortunately, England's own self-interest made her play into our\r\nhands; as Fox put it, it was necessary for her to \"insist in the\r\nstrongest manner that, if America is independent, she must be so of the\r\nwhole world. No secret, tacit, or ostensible connection with France.\"\r\n\r\nOur statesmen won; we got all we asked, as much to the astonishment of\r\nFrance as of England; we proved even more successful in diplomacy than\r\nin arms. As Fox had hoped, we became independent not only of England,\r\nbut of all the world; we were not entangled as a dependent subordinate\r\nin the policy of France, nor did we sacrifice our western boundary to\r\nSpain. It was a great triumph; greater than any that had been won by our\r\nsoldiers. Franklin had a comparatively small share in gaining it; the\r\nglory of carrying through successfully the most important treaty we ever\r\nnegotiated belongs to Jay and Adams, and especially to Jay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore peace was established, Morris had been appointed a commissioner\r\nto treat for the exchange of prisoners. Nothing came of his efforts,\r\nhowever, the British and Americans being utterly unable to come to any\r\nagreement. Both sides had been greatly exasperated,--the British by the\r\nAmericans' breach of faith about Burgoyne's troops, and the Americans by\r\nthe inhuman brutality with which their captive countrymen had been\r\ntreated. An amusing feature of the affair was a conversation between\r\nMorris and the British general, Dalrymple, wherein the former assured\r\nthe latter rather patronizingly that the British \"still remained a great\r\npeople, a very great people,\" and that \"they would undoubtedly still\r\nhold their rank in Europe.\" He would have been surprised, had he known\r\nnot only that the stubborn Island folk were destined soon to hold a\r\nhigher rank in Europe than ever before, but that from their loins other\r\nnations, broad as continents, were to spring, so that the South Seas\r\nshould become an English ocean, and that over a fourth of the world's\r\nsurface there should be spoken the tongue of Pitt and Washington.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was peace declared, and the immediate and pressing danger\r\nremoved, than the confederation relapsed into a loose knot of\r\ncommunities as quarrelsome as they were contemptible. The states-rights\r\nmen for the moment had things all their own way, and speedily reduced us\r\nto the level afterwards reached by the South-American republics. Each\r\ncommonwealth set up for itself, and tried to oppress its neighbors; not\r\none had a creditable history for the next four years; while the career\r\nof Rhode Island in particular can only be properly described as\r\ninfamous. We refused to pay our debts, we would not even pay our army;\r\nand mob violence flourished rankly. As a natural result the European\r\npowers began to take advantage of our weakness and division.\r\n\r\nAll our great men saw the absolute need of establishing a National\r\nUnion--not a league or a confederation--if the country was to be saved.\r\nNone felt this more strongly than Morris; and no one was more hopeful of\r\nthe final result. Jay had written to him as to the need of \"raising and\r\nmaintaining a national spirit in America;\" and he wrote in reply, at\r\ndifferent times:[2] \"Much of convulsion will ensue, yet it must\r\nterminate in giving to government that power without which government is\r\nbut a name.... This country has never yet been known to Europe, and God\r\nknows whether it ever will be. To England it is less known than to any\r\nother part of Europe, because they constantly view it through a medium\r\nof either prejudice or faction. True it is that the general government\r\nwants energy, and equally true it is that the want will eventually be\r\nsupplied. A national spirit is the natural result of national existence;\r\n_and although some of the present generation may feel the result of\r\ncolonial oppositions of opinion, that generation will die away, and give\r\nplace to a race of Americans_. On this occasion, as on others, Great\r\nBritain is our best friend; and, by seizing the critical moment when we\r\nwere about to divide, she has shown us the dreadful consequences of\r\ndivision.... Indeed, my friend, nothing can do us so much good as to\r\nconvince the Eastern and Southern States how necessary it is to give\r\nproper force to the federal government, and nothing will so soon operate\r\nthat conviction as foreign efforts to restrain the navigation of the\r\none and the commerce of the other.\" The last sentence referred to the\r\nlaws aimed at our trade by Great Britain, and by other powers as\r\nwell,--symptoms of outside hostility which made us at once begin to draw\r\ntogether again.\r\n\r\n[2] The italics are mine.\r\n\r\nMoney troubles grew apace, and produced the usual crop of crude theories\r\nand of vicious and dishonest legislation in accordance therewith.\r\nLawless outbreaks became common, and in Massachusetts culminated in\r\nactual rebellion. The mass of the people were rendered hostile to any\r\ncloser union by their ignorance, their jealousy, and the general\r\nparticularistic bent of their minds,--this last being merely a vicious\r\ngraft on, or rather outgrowth of, the love of freedom inborn in the\r\nrace. Their leaders were enthusiasts of pure purpose and unsteady mental\r\nvision; they were followed by the mass of designing politicians, who\r\nfeared that their importance would be lost if their sphere of action\r\nshould be enlarged. Among these leaders the three most important were,\r\nin New York George Clinton, and in Massachusetts and Virginia two much\r\ngreater men--Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry. All three had done\r\nexcellent service at the beginning of the revolutionary troubles.\r\nPatrick Henry lived to redeem himself, almost in his last hour, by the\r\nnoble stand he took in aid of Washington against the democratic\r\nnullification agitation of Jefferson and Madison; but the usefulness of\r\neach of the other two was limited to the early portion of his career.\r\n\r\nLike every other true patriot and statesman, Morris did all in his power\r\nto bring into one combination the varied interests favorable to the\r\nformation of a government that should be strong and responsible as well\r\nas free. The public creditors and the soldiers of the army--whose\r\nfavorite toasts were: \"A hoop to the barrel,\" and \"Cement to the\r\nUnion\"--were the two classes most sensible of the advantages of such a\r\ngovernment; and to each of these Morris addressed himself when he\r\nproposed to consolidate the public debt, both to private citizens and to\r\nthe soldiers, and to make it a charge on the United States, and not on\r\nthe several separate states.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the activity and ability with which he advocated a\r\nfirmer Union, the extreme states-rights men were especially hostile to\r\nhim; and certain of their number assailed him with bitter malignity,\r\nboth then and afterwards. One accusation was, that he had improper\r\nconnections with the public creditors. This was a pure slander,\r\nabsolutely without foundation, and not supported by even the pretence of\r\nproof. Another accusation was that he favored the establishment of a\r\nmonarchy. This was likewise entirely untrue. Morris was not a\r\nsentimental political theorist; he was an eminently practical--that is,\r\nuseful--statesman, who saw with unusual clearness that each people must\r\nhave a government suited to its own individual character, and to the\r\nstage of political and social development it had reached. He realized\r\nthat a nation must be governed according to the actual needs and\r\ncapacities of its citizens, not according to any abstract theory or set\r\nof ideal principles. He would have dismissed with contemptuous laughter\r\nthe ideas of those Americans who at the present day believe that\r\nAnglo-Saxon democracy can be applied successfully to a half-savage\r\nnegroid people in Hayti, or of those Englishmen who consider seriously\r\nthe proposition to renovate Turkey by giving her representative\r\ninstitutions and a parliamentary government. He understood and stated\r\nthat a monarchy \"did not consist with the taste and temper of the\r\npeople\" in America, and he believed in establishing a form of government\r\nthat did. Like almost every other statesman of the day, the perverse\r\nobstinacy of the extreme particularist section at times made him\r\ndownhearted, and caused him almost to despair of a good government being\r\nestablished; and like every sensible man he would have preferred almost\r\nany strong, orderly government to the futile anarchy towards which the\r\nultra states-rights men or separatists tended. Had these last ever\r\nfinally obtained the upper hand, either in revolutionary or\r\npost-revolutionary times, either in 1787 or 1861, the fact would have\r\nshown conclusively that Americans were unfitted for republicanism and\r\nself-government. An orderly monarchy would certainly be preferable to a\r\nrepublic of the epileptic Spanish-American type. The extreme\r\ndoctrinaires, who are fiercest in declaiming in favor of freedom are in\r\nreality its worst foes, far more dangerous than any absolute monarchy\r\never can be. When liberty becomes license, some form of one-man power is\r\nnot far distant.\r\n\r\nThe one great reason for our having succeeded as no other people ever\r\nhas, is to be found in that common sense which has enabled us to\r\npreserve the largest possible individual freedom on the one hand, while\r\nshowing an equally remarkable capacity for combination on the other. We\r\nhave committed plenty of faults, but we have seen and remedied them. Our\r\nvery doctrinaires have usually acted much more practically than they\r\nhave talked. Jefferson, when in power, adopted most of the Federalist\r\ntheories, and became markedly hostile to the nullification movements at\r\nwhose birth he had himself officiated. We have often blundered badly in\r\nthe beginning, but we have always come out well in the end. The Dutch,\r\nwhen they warred for freedom from Spanish rule, showed as much\r\nshort-sighted selfishness and bickering jealousy as even our own\r\nrevolutionary ancestors, and only a part remained faithful to the end:\r\nas a result, but one section won independence, while the Netherlands\r\nwere divided, and never grasped the power that should have been theirs.\r\nAs for the Spanish-Americans, they split up hopelessly almost before\r\nthey were free, and, though they bettered their condition a little, yet\r\nlost nine tenths of what they had gained. Scotland and Ireland, when\r\nindependent, were nests of savages. All the follies our forefathers\r\ncommitted can be paralleled elsewhere, but their successes are unique.\r\n\r\nSo it was in the few years immediately succeeding the peace by which we\r\nwon our independence. The mass of the people wished for no closer union\r\nthan was to be found in a lax confederation; but they had the good sense\r\nto learn the lesson taught by the weakness and lawlessness they saw\r\naround them; they reluctantly made up their minds to the need of a\r\nstronger government, and when they had once come to their decision,\r\nneither demagogue nor doctrinaire could swerve them from it.\r\n\r\nThe national convention to form a Constitution met in May, 1787; and\r\nrarely in the world's history has there been a deliberative body which\r\ncontained so many remarkable men, or produced results so lasting and\r\nfar-reaching. The Congress whose members signed the Declaration of\r\nIndependence had but cleared the ground on which the framers of the\r\nConstitution were to build. Among the delegates in attendance, easily\r\nfirst stood Washington and Franklin,--two of that great American trio in\r\nwhich Lincoln is the third. Next came Hamilton from New York, having as\r\ncolleagues a couple of mere obstructionists sent by the Clintonians to\r\nhandicap him. From Pennsylvania came Robert Morris and Gouverneur\r\nMorris; from Virginia, Madison; from South Carolina, Rutledge and the\r\nPinckneys; and so on through the other states. Some of the most noted\r\nstatesmen were absent, however. Adams and Jefferson were abroad. Jay was\r\nacting as Secretary for Foreign Affairs; in which capacity, by the way,\r\nhe had shown most unlooked-for weakness in yielding to Spanish demands\r\nabout the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nTwo years after taking part in the proceedings of the American\r\nConstitutional Convention, Morris witnessed the opening of the States\r\nGeneral of France. He thoroughly appreciated the absolute and curious\r\ncontrast offered by these two bodies, each so big with fate for all\r\nmankind. The men who predominated in and shaped the actions of the first\r\nbelonged to a type not uncommonly brought forth by a people already\r\naccustomed to freedom at a crisis in the struggle to preserve or extend\r\nits liberties. During the past few centuries this type had appeared many\r\ntimes among the liberty loving nations who dwelt on the shores of the\r\nBaltic and the North Sea; and our forefathers represented it in its\r\nhighest and most perfect shapes. It is a type only to be found among men\r\nalready trained to govern themselves as well as others. The American\r\nstatesmen were the kinsfolk and fellows of Hampden and Pym, of William\r\nthe Silent and John of Barneveldt. Save love of freedom, they had little\r\nin common with the closet philosophers, the enthusiastic visionaries,\r\nand the selfish demagogues who in France helped pull up the flood-gates\r\nof an all-swallowing torrent. They were great men; but it was less the\r\ngreatness of mere genius than that springing from the union of strong,\r\nvirile qualities with steadfast devotion to a high ideal. In certain\r\nrespects they were ahead of all their European compeers; yet they\r\npreserved virtues forgotten or sneered at by the contemporaneous\r\ngeneration of trans-Atlantic leaders. They wrought for the future as\r\nsurely as did the French Jacobins; but their spirit was the spirit of\r\nthe Long Parliament. They were resolute to free themselves from the\r\ntyranny of man; but they had not unlearned the reverence felt by their\r\nfathers for their fathers' God. They were sincerely religious. The\r\nadvanced friends of freedom abroad scoffed at religion, and would have\r\nlaughed outright at a proposition to gain help for their cause by\r\nprayer; but to the founders of our Constitution, when matters were at a\r\ndeadlock, and the outcome looked almost hopeless, it seemed a most fit\r\nand proper thing that one of the chief of their number should propose to\r\ninvoke to aid them a wisdom greater than the wisdom of human beings.\r\nEven those among their descendants who no longer share their trusting\r\nfaith may yet well do regretful homage to a religious spirit so\r\ndeep-rooted and so strongly tending to bring out a pure and high\r\nmorality. The statesmen who met in 1787 were earnestly patriotic. They\r\nunselfishly desired the welfare of their countrymen. They were cool,\r\nresolute men, of strong convictions, with clear insight into the future.\r\nThey were thoroughly acquainted with the needs of the community for\r\nwhich they were to act. Above all they possessed that inestimable\r\nquality, so characteristic of their race, hard-headed common sense.\r\nTheir theory of government was a very high one; but they understood\r\nperfectly that it had to be accommodated to the shortcomings of the\r\naverage citizen. Small indeed was their resemblance to the fiery orators\r\nand brilliant pamphleteers of the States General. They were emphatically\r\ngood men; they were no less emphatically practical men. They would have\r\nscorned Mirabeau as a scoundrel; they would have despised Sieyes as a\r\nvain and impractical theorist.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the convention in their result illustrated in a\r\nstriking manner the truth of the American principle, that--for\r\ndeliberative, not executive, purposes--the wisdom of many men is worth\r\nmore than the wisdom of any one man. The Constitution that the members\r\nassembled in convention finally produced was not only the best possible\r\none for America at that time, but it was also, in spite of its\r\nshort-comings, and taking into account its fitness for our own people\r\nand conditions, as well as its accordance with the principles of\r\nabstract right, probably the best that any nation has ever had, while it\r\nwas beyond question a very much better one than any single member could\r\nhave prepared. The particularist statesmen would have practically\r\ndenied us any real union or efficient executive power; while there was\r\nhardly a Federalist member who would not, in his anxiety to avoid the\r\nevils from which we were suffering, have given us a government so\r\ncentralized and aristocratic that it would have been utterly unsuited to\r\na proud, liberty-loving, and essentially democratic race, and would have\r\ninfallibly provoked a tremendous reactionary revolt.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read through the debates of the convention without\r\nbeing struck by the innumerable shortcomings of each individual plan\r\nproposed by the several members, as divulged in their speeches, when\r\ncompared with the plan finally adopted. Had the result been in\r\naccordance with the views of the strong-government men like Hamilton on\r\nthe one hand, or of the weak-government men like Franklin on the other,\r\nit would have been equally disastrous for the country. The men who\r\nafterwards naturally became the chiefs of the Federalist party, and who\r\nincluded in their number the bulk of the great revolutionary leaders,\r\nwere the ones to whom we mainly owe our present form of government;\r\ncertainly we owe them more, both on this and on other points, than we do\r\ntheir rivals, the after-time Democrats. Yet there were some articles of\r\nfaith in the creed of the latter so essential to our national\r\nwellbeing, and yet so counter to the prejudices of the Federalists, that\r\nit was inevitable they should triumph in the end. Jefferson led the\r\nDemocrats to victory only when he had learned to acquiesce thoroughly in\r\nsome of the fundamental principles of Federalism, and the government of\r\nhimself and his successors was good chiefly in so far as it followed out\r\nthe theories of the Hamiltonians; while Hamilton and the Federalists\r\nfell from power because they could not learn the one great truth taught\r\nby Jefferson,--that in America a statesman should trust the people, and\r\nshould endeavor to secure to each man all possible individual liberty,\r\nconfident that he will use it aright. The old-school Jeffersonian\r\ntheorists believed in \"a strong people and a weak government.\" Lincoln\r\nwas the first who showed how a strong people might have a strong\r\ngovernment and yet remain the freest on the earth. He seized--half\r\nunwittingly--all that was best and wisest in the traditions of\r\nFederalism; he was the true successor of the Federalist leaders; but he\r\ngrafted on their system a profound belief that the great heart of the\r\nnation beat for truth, honor, and liberty.\r\n\r\nThis fact, that in 1787 all the thinkers of the day drew out plans that\r\nin some respects went very wide of the mark, must be kept in mind, or\r\nelse we shall judge each particular thinker with undue harshness when we\r\nexamine his utterances without comparing them with those of his fellows.\r\nBut one partial exception can be made. In the Constitutional Convention\r\nMadison, a moderate Federalist, was the man who, of all who were there,\r\nsaw things most clearly as they were, and whose theories most closely\r\ncorresponded with the principles finally adopted; and although even he\r\nwas at first dissatisfied with the result, and both by word and by\r\naction interpreted the Constitution in widely different ways at\r\ndifferent times, still this was Madison's time of glory: he was one of\r\nthe statesmen who do extremely useful work, but only at some single\r\ngiven crisis. While the Constitution was being formed and adopted, he\r\nstood in the very front; but in his later career he sunk his own\r\nindividuality, and became a mere pale shadow of Jefferson.\r\n\r\nMorris played a very prominent part in the convention. He was a ready\r\nspeaker, and among all the able men present there was probably no such\r\nreally brilliant thinker. In the debates he spoke more often than any\r\none else, although Madison was not far behind him; and his speeches\r\nbetrayed, but with marked and exaggerated emphasis, both the virtues\r\nand the shortcomings of the Federalist school of thought. They show us,\r\ntoo, why he never rose to the first rank of statesmen. His keen,\r\nmasterful mind, his far-sightedness, and the force and subtlety of his\r\nreasoning were all marred by his incurable cynicism and deep-rooted\r\ndistrust of mankind. He throughout appears as _advocatus diaboli_; he\r\nputs the lowest interpretation upon every act, and frankly avows his\r\ndisbelief in all generous and unselfish motives. His continual allusions\r\nto the overpowering influence of the baser passions, and to their\r\nmastery of the human race at all times, drew from Madison, although the\r\ntwo men generally acted together, a protest against his \"forever\r\ninculcating the utter political depravity of men, and the necessity for\r\nopposing one vice and interest as the only possible check to another\r\nvice and interest.\"\r\n\r\nMorris championed a strong national government, wherein he was right;\r\nbut he also championed a system of class representation, leaning towards\r\naristocracy, wherein he was wrong. Not Hamilton himself was a firmer\r\nbeliever in the national idea. His one great object was to secure a\r\npowerful and lasting Union, instead of a loose federal league. It must\r\nbe remembered that in the convention the term \"federal\" was used in\r\nexactly the opposite sense to the one in which it was taken afterwards;\r\nthat is, it was used as the antithesis of \"national,\" not as its\r\nsynonym. The states-rights men used it to express a system of government\r\nsuch as that of the old federation of the thirteen colonies; while their\r\nopponents called themselves Nationalists, and only took the title of\r\nFederalists after the Constitution had been formed, and then simply\r\nbecause the name was popular with the masses. They thus appropriated\r\ntheir adversaries' party name, bestowing it on the organization most\r\nhostile to their adversaries' party theories. Similarly, the term\r\n\"Republican Party,\" which was originally in our history merely another\r\nname for the Democracy, has in the end been adopted by the chief\r\nopponents of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties for the convention to surmount seemed insuperable; on\r\nalmost every question that came up, there were clashing interests.\r\nStrong government and weak government, pure democracy or a modified\r\naristocracy, small states and large states, North and South, slavery and\r\nfreedom, agricultural sections as against commercial sections,--on each\r\nof twenty points the delegates split into hostile camps, that could only\r\nbe reconciled by concessions from both sides. The Constitution was not\r\none compromise; it was a bundle of compromises, all needful.\r\n\r\nMorris, like every other member of the convention, sometimes took the\r\nright and sometimes the wrong side on the successive issues that arose.\r\nBut on the most important one of all he made no error; and he commands\r\nour entire sympathy for his thorough-going nationalism. As was to be\r\nexpected, he had no regard whatever for states rights. He wished to deny\r\nto the small states the equal representation in the Senate finally\r\nallowed them; and he was undoubtedly right theoretically. No good\r\nargument can be adduced in support of the present system on that point.\r\nStill, it has thus far worked no harm; the reason being that our states\r\nhave merely artificial boundaries, while those of small population have\r\nhitherto been distributed pretty evenly among the different sections, so\r\nthat they have been split up like the others on every important issue,\r\nand thus have never been arrayed against the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nThough Morris and his side were defeated in their efforts to have the\r\nstates represented proportionally in the Senate, yet they carried their\r\npoint as to representation in the House. Also on the general question of\r\nmaking a national government, as distinguished from a league or\r\nfederation, the really vital point, their triumph was complete. The\r\nConstitution they drew up and had adopted no more admitted of legal or\r\npeaceable rebellion--whether called secession or nullification--on the\r\npart of the state than on the part of a county or an individual.\r\n\r\nMorris expressed his own views with his usual clear-cut, terse vigor\r\nwhen he asserted that \"state attachments and state importance had been\r\nthe bane of the country,\" and that he came, not as a mere delegate from\r\none section, but \"as a representative of America,--a representative in\r\nsome degree of the whole human race, for the whole human race would be\r\naffected by the outcome of the convention.\" And he poured out the flood\r\nof his biting scorn on those gentlemen who came there \"to truck and\r\nbargain for their respective states,\" asking what man there was who\r\ncould tell with certainty the state wherein he--and even more wherein\r\nhis children--would live in the future; and reminding the small states,\r\nwith cavalier indifference, that, \"if they did not like the Union, no\r\nmatter,--they would have to come in, and that was all there was about\r\nit; for if persuasion did not unite the country, then the sword would.\"\r\nHis correct language and distinct enunciation--to which Madison has\r\nborne witness--allowed his grim truths to carry their full weight; and\r\nhe brought them home to his hearers with a rough, almost startling\r\nearnestness and directness. Many of those present must have winced when\r\nhe told them that it would matter nothing to America \"if all the\r\ncharters and constitutions of the states were thrown into the fire, and\r\nall the demagogues into the ocean,\" and asserted that \"any particular\r\nstate _ought_ to be injured, for the sake of a majority of the people,\r\nin case its conduct showed that it deserved it.\" He held that we should\r\ncreate a national government, to be the one and only supreme power in\r\nthe land,--one which, unlike a mere federal league, such as we then\r\nlived under, should have complete and compulsive operation; and he\r\ninstanced the examples as well of Greece as of Germany and the United\r\nNetherlands, to prove that local jurisdiction destroyed every tie of\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nIt shows the boldness of the experiment in which we were engaged, that\r\nwe were forced to take all other nations, whether dead or living, as\r\nwarnings, not examples; whereas, since we succeeded, we have served as a\r\npattern to be copied, either wholly or in part, by every other people\r\nthat has followed in our steps. Before our own experience, each similar\r\nattempt, save perhaps on the smallest scale, had been a failure. Where\r\nso many other nations teach by their mistakes, we are among the few who\r\nteach by their successes.\r\n\r\nBe it noted also that, the doctrinaires to the contrary notwithstanding,\r\nwe proved that a strong central government was perfectly compatible\r\nwith absolute democracy. Indeed, the separatist spirit does not lead to\r\ntrue democratic freedom. Anarchy is the handmaiden of tyranny. Of all\r\nthe states, South Carolina has shown herself (at least throughout the\r\ngreater part of the present century) to be the most aristocratic, and\r\nthe most wedded to the separatist spirit. The German masses were never\r\nso ground down by oppression as when the little German principalities\r\nwere most independent of each other and of any central authority.\r\n\r\nMorris believed in letting the United States interfere to put down a\r\nrebellion in a state, even though the executive of the state himself\r\nshould be at the head of it; and he was supported in his views by\r\nPinckney, the ablest member of the brilliant and useful but\r\nunfortunately short-lived school of South Carolina Federalists. Pinckney\r\nwas a thorough-going Nationalist; he wished to go a good deal further\r\nthan the convention actually went in giving the central government\r\ncomplete control. Thus he proposed that Congress should have power to\r\nnegative by a two-thirds vote all state laws inconsistent with the\r\nharmony of the Union. Madison also wished to give Congress a veto over\r\nstate legislation. Morris believed that a national law should be allowed\r\nto repeal any state law, and that Congress should legislate in all\r\ncases where the laws of the states conflicted among themselves.\r\n\r\nYet Morris, on the very question of nationalism, himself showed the\r\nnarrowest, blindest, and least excusable sectional jealousy on one\r\npoint. He felt as an American for all the Union, as it then existed; but\r\nhe feared and dreaded the growth of the Union in the West, the very\r\nplace where it was inevitable, as well as in the highest degree\r\ndesirable, that the greatest growth should take place. He actually\r\ndesired the convention to commit the criminal folly of attempting to\r\nprovide that the West should always be kept subordinate to the East.\r\nFortunately he failed; but the mere attempt casts the gravest discredit\r\nalike on his far-sightedness and on his reputation as a statesman. It is\r\nimpossible to understand how one who was usually so cool and\r\nclear-headed an observer could have blundered so flagrantly on a point\r\nhardly less vital than the establishment of the Union itself. Indeed,\r\nhad his views been carried through, they would in the end have nullified\r\nall the good bestowed by the Union. In speaking against state jealousy,\r\nhe had shown its foolishness by observing that no man could tell in what\r\nstate his children would dwell; and the folly of the speaker himself was\r\nmade quite as clear by his not perceiving that their most likely\r\ndwelling-place was in the West. This jealousy of the West was even more\r\ndiscreditable to the Northeast than the jealousy of America had been to\r\nEngland; and it continued strong, especially in New England, for very\r\nmany years. It was a mean and unworthy feeling; and it was greatly to\r\nthe credit of the Southerners that they shared it only to a very small\r\nextent. The South in fact originally was in heartiest sympathy with the\r\nWest; it was not until the middle of the present century that the\r\ncountry beyond the Alleghanies became preponderatingly Northern in\r\nsentiment. In the Constitutional Convention itself, Butler, of South\r\nCarolina, pointed out \"that the people and strength of America were\r\nevidently tending westwardly and southwestwardly.\"\r\n\r\nMorris wished to discriminate against the West by securing to the\r\nAtlantic States the perpetual control of the Union. He brought this idea\r\nup again and again, insisting that we should reserve to ourselves the\r\nright to put conditions on the Western States when we should admit them.\r\nHe dwelt at length on the danger of throwing the preponderance of\r\ninfluence into the Western scale; stating his dread of the \"back\r\nmembers,\" who were always the most ignorant, and the opponents of all\r\ngood measures. He foretold with fear that some day the people of the\r\nWest would outnumber the people of the East, and he wished to put it in\r\nthe power of the latter to keep a majority of the votes in their own\r\nhands. Apparently he did not see that, if the West once became as\r\npopulous as he predicted, its legislators would forthwith cease to be\r\n\"back members.\" The futility of his fears, and still more of his\r\nremedies, was so evident that the convention paid very little heed to\r\neither.\r\n\r\nOn one point, however, his anticipations of harm were reasonable, and\r\nindeed afterwards came true in part. He insisted that the West, or\r\ninterior, would join the South and force us into a war with some\r\nEuropean power, wherein the benefits would accrue to them and the harm\r\nto the Northeast. The attitude of the South and West already clearly\r\nforeshadowed a struggle with Spain for the Mississippi Valley; and such\r\na struggle would surely have come, either with the French or Spaniards,\r\nhad we failed to secure the territory in question by peaceful purchase.\r\nAs it was, the realization of Morris's prophecy was only put off for a\r\nfew years; the South and West brought on the War of 1812, wherein the\r\nEast was the chief sufferer.\r\n\r\nOn the question as to whether the Constitution should be made absolutely\r\ndemocratic or not, Morris took the conservative side. On the suffrage\r\nhis views are perfectly defensible: he believed that it should be\r\nlimited to freeholders. He rightly considered the question as to how\r\nwidely it should be extended to be one of expediency merely. It is\r\nsimply idle folly to talk of suffrage as being an \"inborn\" or \"natural\"\r\nright. There are enormous communities totally unfit for its exercise;\r\nwhile true universal suffrage never has been, and never will be,\r\nseriously advocated by any one. There must always be an age limit, and\r\nsuch a limit must necessarily be purely arbitrary. The wildest democrat\r\nof revolutionary times did not dream of doing away with the restrictions\r\nof race and sex which kept most American citizens from the ballot-box;\r\nand there is certainly much less abstract right in a system which limits\r\nthe suffrage to people of a certain color than there is in one which\r\nlimits it to people who come up to a given standard of thrift and\r\nintelligence. On the other hand, our experience has not proved that men\r\nof wealth make any better use of their ballots than do, for instance,\r\nmechanics and other handicraftsmen. No plan could be adopted so perfect\r\nas to be free from all drawbacks. On the whole, however, and taking our\r\ncountry in its length and breadth, manhood suffrage has worked well,\r\nbetter than would have been the case with any other system; but even\r\nhere there are certain localities where its results have been evil, and\r\nmust simply be accepted as the blemishes inevitably attendant upon, and\r\nmarring, any effort to carry out a scheme that will be widely\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nMorris contended that his plan would work no novel or great hardship, as\r\nthe people in several states were already accustomed to freehold\r\nsuffrage. He considered the freeholders to be the best guardians of\r\nliberty, and maintained that the restriction of the right to them was\r\nonly creating a necessary safeguard \"against the dangerous influence of\r\nthose people without property or principle, with whom, in the end, our\r\ncountry, like all other countries, was sure to abound.\" He did not\r\nbelieve that the ignorant and dependent could be trusted to vote.\r\nMadison supported him heartily, likewise thinking the freeholders the\r\nsafest guardians of our rights; he indulged in some gloomy (and\r\nfortunately hitherto unverified) forebodings as to our future, which\r\nsound strangely coming from one who was afterwards an especial pet of\r\nthe Jeffersonian democracy. He said: \"In future times a great majority\r\nof the people will be without landed or any other property. They will\r\nthen either combine under the influence of their common situation,--in\r\nwhich case the rights of property and the public liberty will not be\r\nsafe in their hands,--or, as is more probable, they will become the\r\ntools of opulence and ambition.\"\r\n\r\nMorris also enlarged on this last idea. \"Give the votes to people who\r\nhave no property, and they will sell them to the rich,\" said he. When\r\ntaunted with his aristocratic tendencies, he answered that he had long\r\nceased to be the dupe of words, that the mere sound of the name\r\n\"aristocracy\" had no terrors for him, but that he did fear lest harm\r\nshould result to the people from the unacknowledged existence of the\r\nvery thing they feared to mention. As he put it, there never was or\r\nwould be a civilized society without an aristocracy, and his endeavor\r\nwas to keep it as much as possible from doing mischief. He thus\r\nprofessed to be opposed to the existence of an aristocracy, but\r\nconvinced that it would exist anyhow, and that therefore the best thing\r\nto be done was to give it a recognized place, while clipping its wings\r\nso as to prevent its working harm. In pursuance of this theory, he\r\nelaborated a wild plan, the chief feature of which was the provision for\r\nan aristocratic senate, and a popular or democratic house, which were to\r\nhold each other in check, and thereby prevent either party from doing\r\ndamage. He believed that the senators should be appointed by the\r\nnational executive, who should fill up the vacancies that occurred. To\r\nmake the upper house effective as a checking branch, it should be so\r\nconstituted to as have a personal interest in checking the other branch;\r\nit should be a senate for life, it should be rich, it should be\r\naristocratic. He continued:--It would then do wrong? He believed so; he\r\nhoped so. The rich would strive to enslave the rest; they always did.\r\nThe proper security against them was to form them into a separate\r\ninterest. The two forces would then control each other. By thus\r\ncombining and setting apart the aristocratic interest, the popular\r\ninterest would also be combined against it. There would be mutual check\r\nand mutual security. If, on the contrary, the rich and poor were allowed\r\nto mingle, then, if the country were commercial, an oligarchy would be\r\nestablished; and if it were not, an unlimited democracy would ensue. It\r\nwas best to look truth in the face. The loaves and fishes would be\r\nneeded to bribe demagogues; while as for the people, if left to\r\nthemselves, they would never act from reason alone. The rich would take\r\nadvantage of their passions, and the result would be either a violent\r\naristocracy, or a more violent despotism.--The speech containing these\r\nextraordinary sentiments, which do no particular credit to either\r\nMorris's head or heart, is given in substance by Madison in the\r\n\"Debates.\" Madison's report is undoubtedly correct, for, after writing\r\nit, he showed it to the speaker himself, who made but one or two verbal\r\nalterations.\r\n\r\nMorris applied an old theory in a new way when he proposed to make\r\n\"taxation proportional to representation\" throughout the Union. He\r\nconsidered the preservation of property as being the distinguishing\r\nobject of civilization, as liberty was sufficiently guaranteed even by\r\nsavagery; and therefore he held that the representation in the senate\r\nshould be according to property as well as numbers. But when this\r\nproposition was defeated, he declined to support one making property\r\nqualifications for congressmen, remarking that such were proper for the\r\nelectors rather than the elected.\r\n\r\nHis views as to the power and functions of the national executive were\r\nin the main sound, and he succeeded in having most of them embodied in\r\nthe Constitution. He wished to have the President hold office during\r\ngood behavior; and, though this was negatived, he succeeded in having\r\nhim made reeligible to the position. He was instrumental in giving him a\r\nqualified veto over legislation, and in providing for his impeachment\r\nfor misconduct; and also in having him made commander-in-chief of the\r\nforces of the republic, and in allowing him the appointment of\r\ngovernmental officers. The especial service he rendered, however, was\r\nhis successful opposition to the plan whereby the President was to be\r\nelected by the legislature. This proposition he combated with all his\r\nstrength, showing that it would take away greatly from the dignity of\r\nthe executive, and would render his election a matter of cabal and\r\nfaction, \"like the election of the pope by a conclave of cardinals.\" He\r\ncontended that the President should be chosen by the people at large, by\r\nthe citizens of the United States, acting through electors whom they had\r\npicked out. He showed the probability that in such a case the people\r\nwould unite upon a man of continental reputation, as the influence of\r\ndesigning demagogues and tricksters is generally powerful in proportion\r\nas the limits within which they work are narrow; and the importance of\r\nthe stake would make all men inform themselves thoroughly as to the\r\ncharacters and capacities of those who were contending for it; and he\r\nflatly denied the statements, that were made in evident good faith, to\r\nthe effect that in a general election each State would cast its vote for\r\nits own favorite citizen. He inclined to regard the President in the\r\nlight of a tribune chosen by the people to watch over the legislature;\r\nand giving him the appointing power, he believed, would force him to\r\nmake good use of it, owing to his sense of responsibility to the people\r\nat large, who would be directly affected by its exercise, and who could\r\nand would hold him accountable for its abuse.\r\n\r\nOn the judiciary his views were also sound. He upheld the power of the\r\njudges, and maintained that they should have absolute decision as to the\r\nconstitutionality of any law. By this means he hoped to provide against\r\nthe encroachments of the popular branch of the government, the one from\r\nwhich danger was to be feared, as \"virtuous citizens will often act as\r\nlegislators in a way of which they would, as private individuals,\r\nafterwards be ashamed.\" He wisely disapproved of low salaries for the\r\njudges, showing that the amounts must be fixed from time to time in\r\naccordance with the manner and style of living in the country; and that\r\ngood work on the bench, where it was especially needful, like good work\r\neverywhere else, could only be insured by a high rate of recompense. On\r\nthe other hand, he approved of introducing into the national\r\nConstitution the foolish New York state inventions of a Council of\r\nRevision and an Executive Council.\r\n\r\nHis ideas of the duties and powers of Congress were likewise very proper\r\non the whole. Most citizens of the present day will agree with him that\r\n\"the excess rather than the deficiency of laws is what we have to\r\ndread.\" He opposed the hurtful provision which requires that each\r\ncongressman should be a resident of his own district, urging that\r\ncongressmen represented the people at large, as well as their own small\r\nlocalities; and he also objected to making officers of the army and navy\r\nineligible. He laid much stress on the propriety of passing navigation\r\nacts to encourage American bottoms and seamen, as a navy was essential\r\nto our security, and the shipping business was always one that stood in\r\npeculiar need of public patronage. Also, like Hamilton and most other\r\nFederalists, he favored a policy of encouraging domestic manufactures.\r\nIncidentally he approved of Congress having the power to lay an embargo,\r\nalthough he has elsewhere recorded his views as to the general futility\r\nof such kinds of \"commercial warfare.\" He believed in having a uniform\r\nbankruptcy law; approved of abolishing all religious tests as\r\nqualifications for office, and was utterly opposed to the \"rotation in\r\noffice\" theory.\r\n\r\nOne curious incident in the convention was the sudden outcropping, even\r\nthus early, of a \"Native American\" movement against all foreigners,\r\nwhich was headed by Butler, of South Carolina, who himself was of Irish\r\nparentage. He strenuously insisted that no foreigners whomsoever should\r\nbe admitted to our councils,--a rather odd proposition, considering that\r\nit would have excluded quite a number of the eminent men he was then\r\naddressing. Pennsylvania in particular--whose array of native talent has\r\nalways been far from imposing--had a number of foreigners among her\r\ndelegates, and loudly opposed the proposition, as did New York. These\r\nStates wished that there should be no discrimination whatever between\r\nnative and foreign born citizens; but finally a compromise was agreed\r\nto, by which the latter were excluded only from the Presidency, but were\r\nadmitted to all other rights after a seven years' residence,--a period\r\nthat was certainly none too long.\r\n\r\nA much more serious struggle took place over the matter of slavery,\r\nquite as important then as ever, for at that time the negroes were a\r\nfifth of our population, instead of, as now, an eighth. The question, as\r\nit came before the convention, had several sides to it; the especial\r\ndifficulty arising over the representation of the Slave States in\r\nCongress, and the importation of additional slaves from Africa. No one\r\nproposed to abolish slavery off-hand; but an influential though small\r\nnumber of delegates, headed by Morris, recognized it as a terrible evil,\r\nand were very loath either to allow the South additional representation\r\nfor the slaves, or to permit the foreign trade in them to go on. When\r\nthe Southern members banded together on the issue, and made it evident\r\nthat it was the one which they regarded as almost the most important of\r\nall, Morris attacked them in a telling speech, stating with his usual\r\nboldness facts that most Northerners only dared hint at, and summing up\r\nwith the remark that, if he was driven to the dilemma of doing injustice\r\nto the Southern States or to human nature, he would have to do it to the\r\nformer; certainly he would not encourage the slave trade by allowing\r\nrepresentation for negroes. Afterwards he characterized the proportional\r\nrepresentation of the blacks even more strongly, as being \"a bribe for\r\nthe importation of slaves.\"\r\n\r\nIn advocating the proposal, first made by Hamilton, that the\r\nrepresentation should in all cases be proportioned to the number of free\r\ninhabitants, Morris showed the utter lack of logic in the Virginian\r\nproposition, which was that the Slave States should have additional\r\nrepresentation to the extent of three fifths of their negroes. If\r\nnegroes were to be considered as inhabitants, then they ought to be\r\nadded in their entire number; if they were to be considered as property,\r\nthen they ought to be counted only if all other wealth was likewise\r\nincluded. The position of the Southerners was ridiculous: he tore their\r\narguments to shreds; but he was powerless to alter the fact that they\r\nwere doggedly determined to carry their point, while most of the\r\nNorthern members cared comparatively little about it.\r\n\r\nIn another speech he painted in the blackest colors the unspeakable\r\nmisery and wrong wrought by slavery, and showed the blight it brought\r\nupon the land. \"It was the curse of Heaven on the states where it\r\nprevailed.\" He contrasted the prosperity and happiness of the Northern\r\nStates with the misery and poverty which overspread the barren wastes of\r\nthose where slaves were numerous. \"Every step you take through the great\r\nregion of slavery presents a desert widening with the increasing number\r\nof these wretched beings.\" He indignantly protested against the Northern\r\nStates being bound to march their militia for the defense of the\r\nSouthern States against the very slaves of whose existence the northern\r\nmen complained. \"He would sooner submit himself to a tax for paying for\r\nall the negroes in the United States than saddle posterity with such a\r\nConstitution.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the high-minded Virginian statesmen were quite as vigorous as he\r\nwas in their denunciation of the system. One of them, George Mason,\r\nportrayed the effect of slavery upon the people at large with bitter\r\nemphasis, and denounced the slave traffic as \"infernal,\" and slavery as\r\na national sin that would be punished by a national calamity,--stating\r\ntherein the exact and terrible truth. In shameful contrast, many of the\r\nNortherners championed the institution; in particular, Oliver Ellsworth,\r\nof Connecticut, whose name should be branded with infamy because of the\r\nwords he then uttered. He actually advocated the free importation of\r\nnegroes into the South Atlantic States, because the slaves \"died so fast\r\nin the sickly rice swamps\" that it was necessary ever to bring fresh\r\nones to labor and perish in the places of their predecessors; and, with\r\na brutal cynicism, peculiarly revolting from its mercantile baseness, he\r\nbrushed aside the question of morality as irrelevant, asking his hearers\r\nto pay heed only to the fact that \"what enriches the part enriches the\r\nwhole.\"\r\n\r\nThe Virginians were opposed to the slave trade: but South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia made it a condition of their coming into the Union. It was\r\naccordingly agreed that it should be allowed for a limited time,--twelve\r\nyears; and this was afterwards extended to twenty by a bargain made by\r\nMaryland and the three South Atlantic States with the New England\r\nStates, the latter getting in return the help of the former to alter\r\ncertain provisions respecting commerce. One of the main industries of\r\nthe New England of that day was the manufacture of rum; and its citizens\r\ncared more for their distilleries than for all the slaves held in\r\nbondage throughout Christendom. The rum was made from molasses which\r\nthey imported from the West Indies, and they carried there in return the\r\nfish taken by their great fishing fleets; they also carried the slaves\r\ninto the Southern ports. Their commerce was what they especially relied\r\non; and to gain support for it they were perfectly willing to make terms\r\nwith even such a black Mammon of unrighteousness as the Southern\r\nslaveholding system. Throughout the contest, Morris and a few other\r\nstout anti-slavery men are the only ones who appear to advantage; the\r\nVirginians, who were honorably anxious to minimize the evils of slavery,\r\ncome next; then the other Southerners who allowed pressing self-interest\r\nto overcome their scruples; and, last of all, the New Englanders whom a\r\ncomparatively trivial self-interest made the willing allies of the\r\nextreme slaveholders. These last were the only Northerners who yielded\r\nanything to the Southern slaveholders that was not absolutely necessary;\r\nand yet they were the forefathers of the most determined and effective\r\nfoes that slavery ever had.\r\n\r\nAs already said, the Southerners stood firm on the slave question: it\r\nwas the one which perhaps more than any other offered the most serious\r\nobstacle to a settlement. Madison pointed out \"that the real difference\r\nlay, not between the small States and the large, but between the\r\nNorthern and the Southern States. The institution of slavery and its\r\nconsequences formed the real line of discrimination.\" To talk of this\r\nkind Morris at first answered hotly enough:--\"he saw that the Southern\r\ngentlemen would not be satisfied unless they saw the way open to their\r\ngaining a majority in the public councils.... If [the distinction they\r\nset up between the North and South] was real, instead of attempting to\r\nblend incompatible things, let them at once take a friendly leave of\r\neach other.\" He afterwards went back from this position, and agreed to\r\nthe compromise by which the slaves were to add, by three fifths of their\r\nnumber, to the representation of their masters, and the slave trade was\r\nto be allowed for a certain number of years, and prohibited forever\r\nafter. He showed his usual straightforward willingness to call things by\r\ntheir right names in desiring to see \"slavery\" named outright in the\r\nConstitution, instead of being characterized with cowardly\r\ncircumlocution, as was actually done.\r\n\r\nIn finally yielding and assenting to a compromise, he was perfectly\r\nright. The crazy talk about the iniquity of consenting to any\r\nrecognition of slavery whatever in the Constitution is quite beside the\r\nmark; and it is equally irrelevant to assert that the so-called\r\n\"compromises\" were not properly compromises at all, because there were\r\nno mutual concessions, and the Southern States had \"no shadow of right\"\r\nto what they demanded and only in part gave up. It was all-important\r\nthat there should be a Union, but it had to result from the voluntary\r\naction of all the states; and each state had a perfect \"right\" to demand\r\njust whatever it chose. The really wise and high-minded statesmen\r\ndemanded for themselves nothing save justice; but they had to accomplish\r\ntheir purpose by yielding somewhat to the prejudices of their more\r\nfoolish and less disinterested colleagues. It was better to limit the\r\nduration of the slave trade to twenty years than to allow it to be\r\ncontinued indefinitely, as would have been the case had the South\r\nAtlantic States remained by themselves. The three fifths representation\r\nof the slaves was an evil anomaly, but it was no worse than allowing the\r\nsmall states equal representation in the Senate; indeed, balancing the\r\ntwo concessions against each other, it must be admitted that Virginia\r\nand North Carolina surrendered to New Hampshire and Rhode Island more\r\nthan they got in return.\r\n\r\nNo man who supported slavery can ever have a clear and flawless title to\r\nour regard; and those who opposed it merit, in so far, the highest\r\nhonor; but the opposition to it sometimes took forms that can be\r\nconsidered only as the vagaries of lunacy. The only hope of abolishing\r\nit lay, first in the establishment and then in the preservation of the\r\nUnion; and if we had at the outset dissolved into a knot of struggling\r\nanarchies, it would have entailed an amount of evil both on our race and\r\non all North America, compared to which the endurance of slavery for a\r\ncentury or two would have been as nothing. If we had even split up into\r\nonly two republics, a Northern and a Southern, the West would probably\r\nhave gone with the latter, and to this day slavery would have existed\r\nthroughout the Mississippi valley; much of what is now our territory\r\nwould have been held by European powers, scornfully heedless of our\r\ndivided might, while in not a few states the form of government would\r\nhave been a military dictatorship; and indeed our whole history would\r\nhave been as contemptible as was that of Germany for some centuries\r\nprior to the rise of the house of Hohenzollern.\r\n\r\nThe fierceness of the opposition to the adoption of the Constitution,\r\nand the narrowness of the majority by which Virginia and New York\r\ndecided in its favor, while North Carolina and Rhode Island did not come\r\nin at all until absolutely forced, showed that the refusal to compromise\r\non any one of the points at issue would have jeopardized everything. Had\r\nthe slavery interest been in the least dissatisfied, or had the plan of\r\ngovernment been a shade less democratic, or had the smaller States not\r\nbeen propitiated, the Constitution would have been rejected off-hand;\r\nand the country would have had before it decades, perhaps centuries, of\r\nmisrule, violence, and disorder.\r\n\r\nMadison paid a very just compliment to some of Morris's best points when\r\nhe wrote, anent his services in the convention: \"To the brilliancy of\r\nhis genius he added, what is too rare, a candid surrender of his\r\nopinions when the light of discussion satisfied him that they had been\r\ntoo hastily formed, and a readiness to aid in making the best of\r\nmeasures in which he had been overruled.\" Although so many of his own\r\ntheories had been rejected, he was one of the warmest advocates of the\r\nConstitution; and it was he who finally drew up the document and put the\r\nfinish to its style and arrangement, so that, as it now stands, it comes\r\nfrom his pen.\r\n\r\nHamilton, who more than any other man bore the brunt of the fight for\r\nits adoption, asked Morris to help him in writing the \"Federalist,\" but\r\nthe latter was for some reason unable to do so; and Hamilton was\r\nassisted only by Madison, and to a very slight extent by Jay.\r\nPennsylvania, the State from which Morris had been sent as a delegate,\r\nearly declared in favor of the new experiment; although, as Morris wrote\r\nWashington, there had been cause to \"dread the cold and sour temper of\r\nthe back counties, and still more the wicked industry of those who have\r\nlong habituated themselves to live on the public, and cannot bear the\r\nidea of being removed from the power and profit of state government,\r\nwhich has been and still is the means of supporting themselves, their\r\nfamilies, and dependents, and (which perhaps is equally grateful) of\r\ndepressing and humbling their political adversaries.\" In his own native\r\nstate of New York the influences he thus describes were still more\r\npowerful, and it needed all Hamilton's wonderful genius to force a\r\nratification of the Constitution in spite of the stupid selfishness of\r\nthe Clintonian faction; as it was, he was only barely successful,\r\nalthough backed by all the best and ablest leaders in the\r\ncommunity,--Jay, Livingstone, Schuyler, Stephen Van Rensselaer, Isaac\r\nRoosevelt, James Duane, and a host of others.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Morris came back to New York to live, having purchased\r\nthe family estate at Morrisania from his elder brother, Staats Long\r\nMorris, the British general. He had for some time been engaged in\r\nvarious successful commercial ventures with his friend Robert Morris,\r\nincluding an East India voyage on a large scale, shipments of tobacco to\r\nFrance, and a share in iron works on the Delaware River, and had become\r\nquite a rich man. As soon as the war was ended, he had done what he\r\ncould do to have the loyalists pardoned and reinstated in their\r\nfortunes; thereby risking his popularity not a little, as the general\r\nfeeling against the Tories was bitter and malevolent in the highest\r\ndegree, in curious contrast to the good-will that so rapidly sprang up\r\nbetween the Unionists and ex-Confederates after the Civil War.\r\n\r\nHe also kept an eye on foreign politics, and one of his letters to Jay\r\ncuriously foreshadows the good-will generally felt by Americans of the\r\npresent day towards Russia, running: \"If her ladyship (the Czarina)\r\nwould drive the Turk out of Europe, and demolish the Algerines and other\r\npiratical gentry, she will have done us much good for her own sake; ...\r\nbut it is hardly possible the other powers will permit Russia to possess\r\nso wide a door into the Mediterranean. I may be deceived, but I think\r\nEngland herself would oppose it. As an American, it is my hearty wish\r\nthat she may effect her schemes.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this it became necessary for him to sail for Europe on\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFIRST STAY IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a hard winter passage of forty days' length Morris reached France,\r\nand arrived in Paris on February 3, 1789. He remained there a year on\r\nhis private business; but his prominence in America, and his intimate\r\nfriendship with many distinguished Frenchmen, at once admitted him to\r\nthe highest social and political circles, where his brilliant talents\r\nsecured him immediate importance.\r\n\r\nThe next nine years of his life were spent in Europe, and it was during\r\nthis time that he unknowingly rendered his especial and peculiar service\r\nto the public. As an American statesman he has many rivals, and not a\r\nfew superiors; but as a penetrating observer and recorder of\r\ncontemporary events, he stands alone among the men of his time. He kept\r\na full diary during his stay abroad, and was a most voluminous\r\ncorrespondent; and his capacity for keen, shrewd observation, his\r\ntruthfulness, his wonderful insight into character, his sense of humor,\r\nand his power of graphic description, all combine to make his comments\r\non the chief men and events of the day a unique record of the inside\r\nhistory of Western Europe during the tremendous convulsions of the\r\nFrench Revolution. He is always an entertaining and in all matters of\r\nfact a trustworthy writer. His letters and diary together form a real\r\nmine of wealth for the student either of the social life of the upper\r\nclasses in France just before the outbreak, or of the events of the\r\nRevolution itself.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be premised that from the outset Morris was\r\nhostile to the spirit of the French Revolution, and his hostility grew\r\nin proportion to its excesses until at last it completely swallowed up\r\nhis original antipathy to England, and made him regard France as\r\nnormally our enemy, not our ally. This was perfectly natural, and indeed\r\ninevitable: in all really free countries, the best friends of freedom\r\nregarded the revolutionists, when they had fairly begun their bloody\r\ncareer, with horror and anger. It was only to oppressed, debased, and\r\npriest-ridden peoples that the French Revolution could come as the\r\nembodiment of liberty. Compared to the freedom already enjoyed by\r\nAmericans, it was sheer tyranny of the most dreadful kind.\r\n\r\nMorris saw clearly that the popular party in France, composed in part of\r\namiable visionaries, theoretic philanthropists, and closet\r\nconstitution-mongers, and in part of a brutal, sodden populace, maddened\r\nby the grinding wrongs of ages, knew not whither its own steps tended;\r\nand he also saw that the then existing generation of Frenchmen were not,\r\nand never would be, fitted to use liberty aright. It is small matter for\r\nwonder that he could not see as clearly the good which lay behind the\r\nmovement; that he could not as readily foretell the real and great\r\nimprovement it was finally to bring about, though only after a\r\ngeneration of hideous convulsions. Even as it was, he discerned what was\r\nhappening, and what was about to happen, more distinctly than did any\r\none else. The wild friends of the French Revolution, especially in\r\nAmerica, supported it blindly, with but a very slight notion of what it\r\nreally signified. Keen though Morris's intellectual vision was, it was\r\nimpossible for him to see what future lay beyond the quarter of a\r\ncentury of impending tumult. It did not lie within his powers to applaud\r\nthe fiendish atrocities of the Red Terror for the sake of the\r\nproblematical good that would come to the next generation. To do so he\r\nwould have needed the granite heart of a zealot, as well as the\r\nprophetic vision of a seer.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution was in its essence a struggle for the abolition of\r\nprivilege, and for equality in civil rights. This Morris perceived,\r\nalmost alone among the statesmen of his day; and he also perceived that\r\nmost Frenchmen were willing to submit to any kind of government that\r\nwould secure them the things for which they strove. As he wrote to\r\nJefferson, when the republic was well under weigh: \"The great mass of\r\nthe French nation is less solicitous to preserve the present order of\r\nthings than to prevent the return of the ancient oppression, and of\r\ncourse would more readily submit to a pure despotism than to that kind\r\nof monarchy whose only limits were found in those noble, legal and\r\nclerical corps by which the people were alternately oppressed and\r\ninsulted.\" To the down-trodden masses of continental Europe the gift of\r\ncivil rights and the removal of the tyranny of the privileged classes,\r\neven though accompanied by the rule of a directory, a consul, or an\r\nemperor, represented an immense political advance; but to the free\r\npeople of England, and to the freer people of America, the change would\r\nhave been wholly for the worse.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, Morris's attitude was natural and proper. There is\r\nno reason to question the sincerity of his statement in another letter,\r\nthat \"I do, from the bottom of my heart, wish well to this country\r\n[France].\" Had the French people shown the least moderation or wisdom,\r\nhe would have unhesitatingly sided with them against their oppressors.\r\nIt must be kept in mind that he was not influenced in the least in his\r\ncourse by the views of the upper classes with whom he mingled. On the\r\ncontrary, when he first came to Europe, he distinctly lost popularity in\r\nsome of the social circles in which he moved, because he was so much\r\nmore conservative than his aristocratic friends, among whom the closet\r\nrepublicanism of the philosophers was for the moment all the rage. He\r\nhad no love for the French nobility, whose folly and ferocity caused the\r\nRevolution, and whose craven cowardice could not check it even before it\r\nhad gathered headway. Long afterwards he wrote of some of the _emigres_:\r\n\"The conversation of these gentlemen, who have the virtue and good\r\nfortune of their grandfathers to recommend them, leads me almost to\r\nforget the crimes of the French Revolution; and often the unforgiving\r\ntemper and sanguinary wishes which they exhibit make me almost believe\r\nthat the assertion of their enemies is true, namely, that it is success\r\nalone which has determined on whose side should be the crimes, and on\r\nwhose the miseries.\" The truth of the last sentence was strikingly\r\nverified by the White Terror, even meaner, if less bloody, than the Red.\r\nBourbon princes and Bourbon nobles were alike, and Morris only erred in\r\nnot seeing that their destruction was the condition precedent upon all\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThere was never another great struggle, in the end productive of good to\r\nmankind, where the tools and methods by which that end was won were so\r\nwholly vile as in the French Revolution. Alone among movements of the\r\nkind, it brought forth no leaders entitled to our respect; none who were\r\nboth great and good; none even who were very great, save, at its\r\nbeginning, strange, strong, crooked Mirabeau, and at its close the\r\ntowering world-genius who sprang to power by its means, wielded it for\r\nhis own selfish purposes, and dazzled all nations over the wide earth by\r\nthe glory of his strength and splendor.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly blame Morris for not appreciating a revolution whose\r\nimmediate outcome was to be Napoleon's despotism, even though he failed\r\nto see all the good that would remotely spring therefrom. He considered,\r\nas he once wrote a friend, that \"the true object of a great statesman is\r\nto give to any particular nation the kind of laws which is suitable to\r\nthem, and the best constitution which they are capable of.\" There can\r\nbe no sounder rule of statesmanship; and none was more flagrantly broken\r\nby the amiable but incompetent political doctrinaires of 1789. Thus the\r\nAmerican, as a far-sighted statesman, despised the theorists who began\r\nthe Revolution, and, as a humane and honorable man, abhorred the\r\nblack-hearted wretches who carried it on. His view of the people among\r\nwhom he found himself, as well as his statement of his own position, he\r\nhimself has recorded: \"To fit people for a republic, as for any other\r\nform of government, a previous education is necessary.... In despotic\r\ngovernments the people, habituated to beholding everything bending\r\nbeneath the weight of power, never possess that power for a moment\r\nwithout abusing it. Slaves, driven to despair, take arms, execute vast\r\nvengeance, and then sink back to their former condition of slaves. In\r\nsuch societies the patriot, the melancholy patriot, sides with the\r\ndespot, because anything is better than a wild and bloody confusion.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for an outline of his views. His writings preserve them for us\r\nin detail on almost every important question that came up during his\r\nstay in Europe; couched, moreover, in telling, piquant sentences that\r\nleave room for hardly a dull line in either letters or diary.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he arrived in Paris than he sought out Jefferson, then the\r\nAmerican minister, and Lafayette. They engaged him to dine on the two\r\nfollowing nights. He presented his various letters of introduction, and\r\nin a very few weeks, by his wit, tact, and ability, had made himself\r\ncompletely at home in what was by far the most brilliant and\r\nattractive--although also the most hopelessly unsound--fashionable\r\nsociety of any European capital. He got on equally well with fine\r\nladies, philosophers, and statesmen; was as much at his ease in the\r\nsalons of the one as at the dinner-tables of the other; and all the time\r\nobserved and noted down, with the same humorous zest, the social\r\npeculiarities of his new friends as well as the tremendous march of\r\npolitical events. Indeed, it is difficult to know whether to set the\r\nhigher value on his penetrating observations concerning public affairs,\r\nor on his witty, light, half-satirical sketches of the men and women of\r\nthe world with whom he was thrown in contact, told in his usual charming\r\nand effective style. No other American of note has left us writings half\r\nso humorous and amusing, filled, too, with information of the greatest\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nAlthough his relations with Jefferson were at this time very friendly,\r\nyet his ideas on most subjects were completely at variance with those\r\nof the latter. He visited him very often; and, after one of these\r\noccasions, jots down his opinion of his friend in his usual amusing\r\nvein: \"Call on Mr. Jefferson, and sit a good while. General conversation\r\non character and politics. I think he does not form very just estimates\r\nof character, but rather assigns too many to the humble rank of fools;\r\nwhereas in life the gradations are infinite, and each individual has his\r\npeculiarities of fort and feeble:\" Not a bad protest against the dangers\r\nof sweeping generalization. Another time he records his judgment of\r\nJefferson's ideas on public matters as follows: \"He and I differ in our\r\nsystems of politics. He, with all the leaders of liberty here, is\r\ndesirous of annihilating distinctions of order. How far such views may\r\nbe right respecting mankind in general is, I think, extremely\r\nproblematical. But with respect to this nation I am sure they are wrong,\r\nand cannot eventuate well.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he began to go out in Parisian society, he was struck by the\r\ncloset republicanism which it had become the fashion to affect. After\r\nhis first visit to Lafayette, who received him with that warmth and\r\nfrank, open-handed hospitality which he always extended to Americans,\r\nMorris writes: \"Lafayette is full of politics; he appears to be too\r\nrepublican for the genius of his country.\" And again, when Lafayette\r\nshowed him the draft of the celebrated Declaration of Rights, he notes:\r\n\"I gave him my opinions, and suggested several amendments tending to\r\nsoften the high-colored expressions of freedom. It is not by sounding\r\nwords that revolutions are produced.\" Elsewhere he writes that \"the\r\nyoung nobility have brought themselves to an active faith in the natural\r\nequality of mankind, and spurn at everything which looks like\r\nrestraint.\" Some of their number, however, he considered to be actuated\r\nby considerations more tangible than mere sentiment. He chronicles a\r\ndinner with some members of the National Assembly, where \"one, a noble\r\nrepresenting the _Tiers_, is so vociferous against his own order, that I\r\nam convinced he means to rise by his eloquence, and finally will, I\r\nexpect, vote with the opinion of the court, let that be what it may.\"\r\nThe sentimental humanitarians--who always form a most pernicious body,\r\nwith an influence for bad hardly surpassed by that of the professionally\r\ncriminal class--of course throve vigorously in an atmosphere where\r\ntheories of mawkish benevolence went hand in hand with the habitual\r\npractice of vices too gross to name. Morris, in one of his letters,\r\nnarrates an instance in point; at the same time showing how this excess\r\nof watery philanthropy was, like all the other movements of the French\r\nRevolution, but a violent and misguided reaction against former abuses\r\nof the opposite sort. The incident took place in Madame de Stael's\r\nsalon. \"The Count de Clermont Tonnerre, one of their best orators, read\r\nto us a very pathetic oration; and the object was to show that no\r\npenalties are the legal compensations for crimes or injuries: the man\r\nwho is hanged, having by that event paid his debt to society, ought not\r\nto be held in dishonor; and in like manner he who has been condemned for\r\nseven years to be flogged in the galleys, should, when he has served out\r\nhis apprenticeship, be received again into good company, as if nothing\r\nhad happened. You smile; but observe the extreme to which the matter was\r\ncarried the other way. Dishonoring thousands for the guilt of one has so\r\nshocked the public sentiment as to render this extreme fashionable. The\r\noration was very fine, very sentimental, very pathetic, and the style\r\nharmonious. Shouts of applause and full approbation. When this was\r\npretty well over, I told him that his speech was extremely eloquent, but\r\nthat his principles were not very solid. Universal surprise!\"\r\n\r\nAt times he became rather weary of the constant discussion of politics,\r\nwhich had become the chief drawing-room topic. Among the capacities of\r\nhis lively and erratic nature was the power of being intensely bored by\r\nanything dull or monotonous. He remarked testily that \"republicanism was\r\nabsolutely a moral influenza, from which neither titles, places, nor\r\neven the diadem can guard the possessor.\" In a letter to a friend on a\r\ndifferent subject he writes: \"Apropos,--a term which my Lord\r\nChesterfield well observes we generally use to bring in what is not at\r\nall to the purpose,--apropos, then, I have here the strangest employment\r\nimaginable. A republican, and just as it were emerged from that assembly\r\nwhich has formed one of the most republican of all republican\r\nconstitutions, I preach incessantly respect for the prince, attention to\r\nthe rights of the nobles, and above all moderation, not only in the\r\nobject, but also in the pursuit of it. All this you will say is none of\r\nmy business; but I consider France as the natural ally of my country,\r\nand, of course, that we are interested in her prosperity; besides, to\r\nsay the truth, I love France.\"\r\n\r\nHis hostility to the fashionable cult offended some of his best friends.\r\nThe Lafayettes openly disapproved his sentiments. The Marquis told him\r\nthat he was injuring the cause, because his sentiments were being\r\ncontinually quoted against \"the good party.\" Morris answered that he was\r\nopposed to democracy from a regard to liberty; that the popular party\r\nwere going straight to destruction, and he would fain stop them if he\r\ncould; for their views respecting the nation were totally inconsistent\r\nwith the materials of which it was composed, and the worst thing that\r\ncould happen to them would be to have their wishes granted. Lafayette\r\nhalf admitted that this was true: \"He tells me that he is sensible his\r\nparty are mad, and tells them so, but is not the less determined to die\r\nwith them. I tell him that I think it would be quite as well to bring\r\nthem to their senses and live with them,\"--the last sentence showing the\r\nimpatience with which the shrewd, fearless, practical American at times\r\nregarded the dreamy inefficiency of his French associates. Madame de\r\nLafayette was even more hostile than her husband to Morris's ideas. In\r\ncommenting on her beliefs he says: \"She is a very sensible woman, but\r\nhas formed her ideas of government in a manner not suited, I think,\r\neither to the situation, the circumstances, or the disposition of\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nHe was considered too much of an aristocrat in the salon of the Comtesse\r\nde Tesse, the resort of \"republicans of the first feather;\" and at\r\nfirst was sometimes rather coldly received there. He felt, however, a\r\nmost sincere friendship and regard for the comtesse, and thoroughly\r\nrespected the earnestness with which she had for twenty years done what\r\nlay in her power to give her country greater liberty. She was a genuine\r\nenthusiast, and, when the National Assembly met, was filled with\r\nexultant hope for the future. The ferocious outbreaks of the mob, and\r\nthe crazy lust for blood shown by the people at large, startled her out\r\nof her faith, and shocked her into the sad belief that her life-long and\r\npainful labors had been wasted in the aid of a bad cause. Later in the\r\nyear Morris writes: \"I find Madame de Tesse is become a convert to my\r\nprinciples. We have a gay conversation of some minutes on their affairs,\r\nin which I mingle sound maxims of government with that piquant\r\n_legerete_ which this nation delights in. She insists that I dine with\r\nher at Versailles the next time I am there. We are vastly gracious, and\r\nall at once, in a serious tone, 'Mais attendez, madame, est-ce que je\r\nsuis trop aristocrat?' To which she answers, with a smile of gentle\r\nhumility, 'Oh, mon Dieu, non!'\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice how rapidly Morris's brilliant talents gave him\r\na commanding position, stranger and guest though he was, among the most\r\nnoted statesmen of France; how often he was consulted, and how widely\r\nhis opinions were quoted. Moreover, his incisive truthfulness makes his\r\nwritings more valuable to the historian of his time than are those of\r\nany of his contemporaries, French, English, or American. Taine, in his\r\ngreat work on the Revolution, ranks him high among the small number of\r\nobservers who have recorded clear and sound judgments of those years of\r\nconfused, formless tumult and horror.\r\n\r\nAll his views on French politics are very striking. As soon as he\r\nreached Paris, he was impressed by the unrest and desire for change\r\nprevailing everywhere, and wrote home: \"I find on this side of the\r\nAtlantic a resemblance to what I left on the other,--a nation which\r\nexists in hopes, prospects, and expectations; the reverence for ancient\r\nestablishments gone; existing forms shaken to the very foundation; and a\r\nnew order of things about to take place, in which, perhaps, even the\r\nvery names of all former institutions will be disregarded.\" And again:\r\n\"This country presents an astonishing spectacle to one who has collected\r\nhis ideas from books and information half a dozen years old. Everything\r\nis _a l'Anglaise_, and a desire to imitate the English prevails alike\r\nin the cut of a coat and the form of a constitution. Like the English,\r\ntoo, all are engaged in parliamenteering; and when we consider how novel\r\nthis last business must be, I assure you the progress is far from\r\ncontemptible,\"--a reference to Lafayette's electioneering trip to\r\nAuvergne. The rapidity with which, in America, order had come out of\r\nchaos, while in France the reverse process had been going on, impressed\r\nhim deeply; as he says: \"If any new lesson were wanting to impress on\r\nour hearts a deep sense of the mutability of human affairs, the double\r\ncontrast between France and America two years ago and at the present\r\nwould surely furnish it.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw at once that the revolutionists had it in their power to do about\r\nas they chose. \"If there be any real vigor in the nation the prevailing\r\nparty in the States-General may, if they please, overturn the monarchy\r\nitself, should the king commit his authority to a contest with them. The\r\ncourt is extremely feeble, and the manners are so extremely corrupt that\r\nthey cannot succeed if there be any consistent opposition, unless the\r\nwhole nation be equally depraved.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not believe that the people would be able to profit by the\r\nrevolution, or to use their opportunities aright. For the numerous\r\nclass of patriots who felt a vague, though fervent, enthusiasm for\r\nliberty in the abstract, and who, without the slightest practical\r\nknowledge, were yet intent on having all their own pet theories put into\r\npractice, he felt profound scorn and contempt; while he distrusted and\r\ndespised the mass of Frenchmen, because of their frivolity and\r\nviciousness. He knew well that a pure theorist may often do as much\r\ndamage to a country as the most corrupt traitor; and very properly\r\nconsidered that in politics the fool is quite as obnoxious as the knave.\r\nHe also realized that levity and the inability to look life seriously in\r\nthe face, or to attend to the things worth doing, may render a man just\r\nas incompetent to fulfil the duties of citizenship as would actual\r\nviciousness.\r\n\r\nTo the crazy theories of the constitution-makers and closet-republicans\r\ngenerally, he often alludes in his diary, and in his letters home. In\r\none place he notes: \"The literary people here, observing the abuses of\r\nthe monarchical form, imagine that everything must go the better in\r\nproportion as it recedes from the present establishment, and in their\r\nclosets they make men exactly suited to their systems; but unluckily\r\nthey are such men as exist nowhere else, and least of all in France.\"\r\nAnd he writes almost the same thing to Washington: \"The middle party,\r\nwho mean well, have unfortunately acquired their ideas of government\r\nfrom books, and are admirable fellows upon paper: but as it happens,\r\nsomewhat unfortunately, that the men who live in the world are very\r\ndifferent from those who dwell in the heads of philosophers, it is not\r\nto be wondered at if the systems taken out of books are fit for nothing\r\nbut to be put back into books again.\" And once more: \"They have all that\r\nromantic spirit, and all those romantic ideas of government, which,\r\nhappily for America, we were cured of before it was too late.\" He shows\r\nhow they had never had the chance to gain wisdom through experience. \"As\r\nthey have hitherto felt severely the authority exercised in the name of\r\ntheir princes, every limitation of that power seems to them desirable.\r\nNever having felt the evils of too weak an executive, the disorders to\r\nbe apprehended from anarchy make as yet no impression.\" Elsewhere he\r\ncomments on their folly in trying to apply to their own necessities\r\nsystems of government suited to totally different conditions; and\r\nmentions his own attitude in the matter: \"I have steadily combated the\r\nviolence and excess of those persons who, either inspired with an\r\nenthusiastic love of freedom, or prompted by sinister designs, are\r\ndisposed to drive everything to extremity. Our American example has\r\ndone them good; but, like all novelties, liberty runs away with their\r\ndiscretion, if they have any. They want an American constitution with\r\nthe exception of a King instead of a President, without reflecting that\r\nthey have not American citizens to support that constitution.... Whoever\r\ndesires to apply in the practical science of government those rules and\r\nforms which prevail and succeed in a foreign country, must fall into the\r\nsame pedantry with our young scholars, just fresh from the university,\r\nwho would fain bring everything to the Roman standard.... The scientific\r\ntailor who should cut after Grecian or Chinese models would not have\r\nmany customers, either in London or Paris; and those who look to America\r\nfor their political forms are not unlike the tailors in Laputa, who, as\r\nGulliver tells us, always take measures with a quadrant.\"\r\n\r\nHe shows again and again his abiding distrust and fear of the French\r\ncharacter, as it was at that time, volatile, debauched, ferocious, and\r\nincapable of self-restraint. To Lafayette he insisted that the \"extreme\r\nlicentiousness\" of the people rendered it indispensable that they should\r\nbe kept under authority; and on another occasion told him \"that the\r\nnation was used to being governed, and would have to be governed; and\r\nthat if he expected to lead them by their affections, he would himself\r\nbe the dupe.\" In writing to Washington he painted the outlook in colors\r\nthat, though black indeed, were not a shade too dark. \"The materials for\r\na revolution in this country are very indifferent. Everybody agrees that\r\nthere is an utter prostration of morals; but this general proposition\r\ncan never convey to an American mind the degree of depravity. It is not\r\nby any figure of rhetoric or force of language that the idea can be\r\ncommunicated. A hundred anecdotes and a hundred thousand examples are\r\nrequired to show the extreme rottenness of every member. There are men\r\nand women who are greatly and eminently virtuous. I have the pleasure to\r\nnumber many in my own acquaintance; but they stand forward from a\r\nbackground deeply and darkly shaded. It is however from such crumbling\r\nmatter that the great edifice of freedom is to be erected here. Perhaps\r\nlike the stratum of rock which is spread under the whole surface of\r\ntheir country, it may harden when exposed to the air; but it seems quite\r\nas likely that it will fall and crush the builders. I own to you that I\r\nam not without such apprehensions, for there is one fatal principle\r\nwhich pervades all ranks. It is a perfect indifference to the violation\r\nof engagements. Inconstancy is so mingled in the blood, marrow, and very\r\nessence of this people, that when a man of high rank and importance\r\nlaughs to-day at what he seriously asserted yesterday, it is considered\r\nas in the natural order of things. Consistency is a phenomenon. Judge,\r\nthen, what would be the value of an association should such a thing be\r\nproposed and even adopted. The great mass of the common people have no\r\nreligion but their priests, no law but their superiors, no morals but\r\ntheir interest. These are the creatures who, led by drunken curates, are\r\nnow on the high road _a la liberte_.\"\r\n\r\nMorris and Washington wrote very freely to each other. In one of his\r\nletters, the latter gave an account of how well affairs were going in\r\nAmerica (save in Rhode Island, the majority of whose people \"had long\r\nsince bid adieu to every principle of honor, common sense, and\r\nhonesty\"), and then went on to discuss things in France. He expressed\r\nthe opinion that, if the revolution went no further than it had already\r\ngone, France would become the most powerful and happy state in Europe;\r\nbut he trembled lest, having triumphed in the first paroxysms, it might\r\nsuccumb to others still more violent that would be sure to follow. He\r\nfeared equally the \"licentiousness of the people\" and the folly of the\r\nleaders, and doubted if they possessed the requisite temperance,\r\nfirmness, and foresight; and if they did not, then he believed they\r\nwould run from one extreme to another, and end with \"a higher toned\r\ndespotism than the one which existed before.\"\r\n\r\nMorris answered him with his usual half-satiric humor: \"Your sentiments\r\non the revolution here I believe to be perfectly just, because they\r\nperfectly accord with my own, and that is, you know, the only standard\r\nwhich Heaven has given us by which to judge,\" and went on to describe\r\nhow the parties in France stood. \"The king is in effect a prisoner in\r\nParis and obeys entirely the National Assembly. This assembly may be\r\ndivided into three parts: one, called the _aristocrats_, consists of the\r\nhigh clergy, the members of the law (note, these are not the lawyers)\r\nand such of the nobility as think they ought to form a separate order.\r\nAnother, which has no name, but which consists of all sorts of people,\r\nreally friends to a good free government. The third is composed of what\r\nis here called the _enragees_, that is, the madmen. These are the most\r\nnumerous, and are of that class which in America is known by the name of\r\npettifogging lawyers; together with ... those persons who in all\r\nrevolutions throng to the standard of change because they are not well.\r\nThis last party is in close alliance with the populace here, and they\r\nhave already unhinged everything, and, according to custom on such\r\noccasions, the torrent rushes on irresistibly until it shall have wasted\r\nitself.\" The _literati_ he pronounced to have no understanding whatever\r\nof the matters at issue, and as was natural to a shrewd observer\r\neducated in the intensely practical school of American political life,\r\nhe felt utter contempt for the wordy futility and wild theories of the\r\nFrench legislators. \"For the rest, they _discuss_ nothing in their\r\nassembly. One large half of the time is spent in hallooing and bawling.\"\r\n\r\nWashington and Morris were both so alarmed and indignant at the excesses\r\ncommitted by the revolutionists, and so frankly expressed their\r\nfeelings, as to create an impression in some quarters that they were\r\nhostile to the revolution itself. The exact reverse was originally the\r\ncase. They sympathized most warmly with the desire for freedom, and with\r\nthe efforts made to attain it. Morris wrote to the President: \"We have,\r\nI think, every reason to wish that the patriots may be successful. The\r\ngenerous wish that a free people must have to disseminate freedom, the\r\ngrateful emotion which rejoices in the happiness of a benefactor, the\r\ninterest we must feel as well in the liberty as in the power of this\r\ncountry, all conspire to make us far from indifferent spectators. I say\r\nthat we have an _interest_ in the liberty of France. The leaders here\r\nare our friends. Many of them have imbibed their principles in America,\r\nand all have been fired by our example. Their opponents are by no means\r\nrejoiced at the success of our revolution, and many of them are disposed\r\nto form connections of the strictest kind with Great Britain.\" Both\r\nWashington and Morris would have been delighted to see liberty\r\nestablished in France; but they had no patience with the pursuit of the\r\nbloody chimera which the revolutionists dignified with that title. The\r\none hoped for, and the other counseled, moderation among the friends of\r\nrepublican freedom, not because they were opposed to it, but because\r\nthey saw that it could only be gained and kept by self-restraint. They\r\nwere, to say the least, perfectly excusable for believing that at that\r\ntime some form of monarchy, whether under king, dictator, or emperor,\r\nwas necessary to France. Every one agrees that there are certain men\r\nwiser than their fellows; the only question is as to how these men can\r\nbe best chosen out, and to this there can be no absolute answer. No mode\r\nwill invariably give the best results; and the one that will come\r\nnearest to doing so under given conditions will not work at all under\r\nothers. Where the people are enlightened and moral they are themselves\r\nthe ones to choose their rulers; and such a form of government is\r\nunquestionably the highest of any, and the only one that a high-spirited\r\nand really free nation will tolerate; but if they are corrupt and\r\ndegraded, they are unfit for republicanism, and need to be under an\r\nentirely different system. The most genuine republican, if he has any\r\ncommon sense, does not believe in a democratic government for every race\r\nand in every age.\r\n\r\nMorris was a true republican, and an American to the core. He was alike\r\nfree from truckling subserviency to European opinion,--a degrading\r\nremnant of colonialism that unfortunately still lingers in certain\r\nlimited social and literary circles,--and from the uneasy self-assertion\r\nthat springs partly from sensitive vanity, and partly from a smothered\r\ndoubt as to one's real position. Like most men of strong character, he\r\nhad no taste for the \"cosmopolitanism\" that so generally indicates a\r\nweak moral and mental make-up. He enjoyed his stay in Europe to the\r\nutmost, and was intimate with the most influential men and charming\r\nwomen of the time; but he was heartily glad to get back to America,\r\nrefused to leave it again, and always insisted that it was the most\r\npleasant of all places in which to live. While abroad he was simply a\r\ngentleman among gentlemen. He never intruded his political views or\r\nnational prejudices upon his European friends; but he was not inclined\r\nto suffer any imputation on his country. Any question about America that\r\nwas put in good faith, no matter how much ignorance it displayed, he\r\nalways answered good-humoredly; and he gives in his Diary some amusing\r\nexamples of such conversations. Once he was cross-examined by an\r\ninquisitive French nobleman, still in the stage of civilization which\r\nbelieves that no man can be paid to render a service to another,\r\nespecially a small service, and yet retain his self-respect and continue\r\nto regard himself as the full political equal of his employer. One of\r\nthis gentleman's sagacious inquiries was as to how a shoemaker could, in\r\nthe pride of his freedom, think himself equal to a king, and yet accept\r\nan order to make shoes; to which Morris replied that he would accept it\r\nas a matter of business, and be glad of the chance to make them, since\r\nit lay in the line of his duty; and that he would all the time consider\r\nhimself at full liberty to criticise his visitor, or the king, or any\r\none else, who lapsed from _his_ own duty. After recording several\r\nqueries of the same nature, and some rather abrupt answers, the Diary\r\nfor that day closes rather caustically with the comment: \"This manner of\r\nthinking and speaking, however, is too masculine for the climate I am\r\nnow in.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Washington Morris made one of his usual happy guesses--if\r\nforecasting the future by the aid of marvelous insight into human\r\ncharacter can properly be called a guess--as to what would happen to\r\nFrance: \"It is very difficult to guess whereabouts the flock will settle\r\nwhen it flies so wild; but as far as it is possible to guess this (late)\r\nkingdom will be cast into a congeries of little democracies, laid out,\r\nnot according to rivers, mountains, etc., but with the square and\r\ncompass according to latitude and longitude,\" and adds that he thinks so\r\nmuch fermenting matter will soon give the nation \"a kind of political\r\ncolic.\"\r\n\r\nHe rendered some services to Washington that did not come in the line of\r\nhis public duty. One of these was to get him a watch, Washington having\r\nwritten to have one purchased in Paris, of gold, \"not a small, trifling,\r\nnor a finical ornamental one, but a watch well executed in point of\r\nworkmanship, large and flat, with a plain, handsome key.\" Morris sent it\r\nto him by Jefferson, \"with two copper keys and one golden one, and a box\r\ncontaining a spare spring and glasses.\" His next service to the great\r\nVirginian, or rather to his family, was of a different kind, and he\r\nrecords it with a smile at his own expense. \"Go to M. Hudon's; he has\r\nbeen waiting for me a long time. I stand for his statue of General\r\nWashington, being the humble employment of a manikin. This is literally\r\ntaking the advice of St. Paul, to be all things to all men.\"\r\n\r\nHe corresponded with many men of note; not the least among whom was the\r\ndaring corsair, Paul Jones. The latter was very anxious to continue in\r\nthe service of the people with whom he had cast in his lot, and in\r\ncommand of whose vessels he had reached fame. Morris was obliged to tell\r\nhim that he did not believe an American navy would be created for some\r\nyears to come, and advised him meanwhile to go into the service of the\r\nRussians, as he expected there would soon be warm work on the Baltic;\r\nand even gave him a hint as to what would probably be the best plan of\r\ncampaign. Paul Jones wanted to come to Paris; but from this Morris\r\ndissuaded him. \"A journey to this city can, I think, produce nothing but\r\nthe expense attending it; for neither pleasure nor profit can be\r\nexpected here, by one of your profession in particular; and, except that\r\nit is a more dangerous residence than many others, I know of nothing\r\nwhich may serve to you as an inducement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Morris entered into the social life of Paris with all the zest\r\nnatural to his pleasure-loving character, yet he was far too\r\nclear-headed to permit it to cast any glamour over him. Indeed, it is\r\nrather remarkable that a young provincial gentleman, from a raw, new,\r\nfar-off country, should not have had his head turned by being made\r\nsomewhat of a lion in what was then the foremost city of the civilized\r\nworld. Instead of this happening, his notes show that he took a\r\nperfectly cool view of his new surroundings, and appreciated the\r\nover-civilized, aristocratic society, in which he found himself, quite\r\nat its true worth. He enjoyed the life of the salon very much, but it\r\ndid not in the least awe or impress him; and he was of too virile fibre,\r\ntoo essentially a man, to be long contented with it alone. He likewise\r\nappreciated the fashionable men, and especially the fashionable women,\r\nwhom he met there; but his amusing comments on them, as shrewd as they\r\nare humorous, prove how little he respected their philosophy, and how\r\ncompletely indifferent he was to their claims to social preeminence.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the pleasure-loving, highly cultured society\r\nof eighteenth-century France; but to a man like Morris, of real ability\r\nand with an element of sturdiness in his make-up, both the culture and\r\nknowledge looked a little like veneering; the polish partook of\r\neffeminacy; the pleasure so eagerly sought after could be called\r\npleasure only by people of ignoble ambition; and the life that was lived\r\nseemed narrow and petty, agreeable enough for a change, but dreary\r\nbeyond measure if followed too long. The authors, philosophers, and\r\nstatesmen of the salon were rarely, almost never, men of real greatness;\r\ntheir metal did not ring true; they were shams, and the life of which\r\nthey were a part was a sham. Not only was the existence hollow,\r\nunwholesome, effeminate, but also in the end tedious: the silent,\r\ndecorous dullness of life in the dreariest country town is not more\r\ninsufferable than, after a time, become the endless chatter, the small\r\nwitticisms, the mock enthusiasms, and vapid affectations of an\r\naristocratic society as artificial and unsound as that of the Parisian\r\ndrawing-rooms in the last century.\r\n\r\nBut all this was delightful for a time, especially to a man who had\r\nnever seen any city larger than the overgrown villages of New York and\r\nPhiladelphia. Morris thus sums up his first impressions in a letter to a\r\nfriend: \"A man in Paris lives in a sort of whirlwind, which turns him\r\nround so fast that he can see nothing. And as all men and things are in\r\nthe same vertiginous condition, you can neither fix yourself nor your\r\nobject for regular examination. Hence the people of this metropolis are\r\nunder the necessity of pronouncing their definitive judgment from the\r\nfirst glance; and being thus habituated to shoot flying, they have what\r\nsportsmen call a quick sight. _Ex pede Herculem_. They know a wit by his\r\nsnuff-box, a man of taste by his bow, and a statesman by the cut of his\r\ncoat. It is true that, like other sportsmen, they sometimes miss; but\r\nthen, like other sportsmen too, they have a thousand excuses besides the\r\nwant of skill: the fault, you know, may be in the dog, or the bird, or\r\nthe powder, or the flint, or even the gun, without mentioning the\r\ngunner.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the most famous of the salons where he was fairly constant in his\r\nattendance was that of Madame de Stael. There was not a little contempt\r\nmixed with his regard for the renowned daughter of Necker. She amused\r\nhim, however, and he thought well of her capacity, though in his Diary\r\nhe says that he never in his life saw \"such exuberant vanity\" as she\r\ndisplayed about her father, Necker,--a very ordinary personage, whom the\r\nconvulsions of the time had for a moment thrown forward as the most\r\nprominent man in France. By way of instance he mentions a couple of her\r\nremarks, one to the effect that a speech of Talleyrand on the church\r\nproperty was \"excellent, admirable, in short that there were two pages\r\nin it which were worthy of M. Necker;\" and another wherein she said that\r\nwisdom was a very rare quality, and that she knew of no one who\r\npossessed it in a superlative degree except her father.\r\n\r\nThe first time he met her was after an exciting discussion in the\r\nassembly over the finances, which he describes at some length. Necker\r\nhad introduced an absurd scheme for a loan. Mirabeau, who hated Necker,\r\nsaw the futility of his plan, but was also aware that popular opinion\r\nwas blindly in his favor, and that to oppose him would be ruinous; so in\r\na speech of \"fine irony\" he advocated passing Necker's proposed bill\r\nwithout change or discussion, avowing that his object was to have the\r\nresponsibility and glory thrown entirely on the proposer of the measure.\r\nHe thus yielded to the popular view, while at the same time he\r\nshouldered on Necker all the responsibility for a deed which it was\r\nevident would in the end ruin him. It was a not very patriotic move,\r\nalthough a good example of selfish political tactics, and Morris sneered\r\nbitterly at its adoption by the representatives of a people who prided\r\nthemselves on being \"the modern Athenians.\" To his surprise, however,\r\neven Madame de Stael took Mirabeau's action seriously; she went into\r\nraptures over the wisdom of the assembly in doing just what Necker said,\r\nfor \"the only thing they could do was to comply with her father's wish,\r\nand there could be no doubt as to the success of her father's plans!\r\nBravo!\"\r\n\r\nWith Morris she soon passed from politics to other subjects. \"Presented\r\nto Madame de Stael as _un homme d'esprit_,\" he writes, \"she singles me\r\nout and makes _a talk_; asks if I have not written a book on the\r\nAmerican Constitution. 'Non, madame, j'ai fait mon devoir en assistant a\r\nla formation de cette constitution.' 'Mais, monsieur, votre conversation\r\ndoit etre tres interessante, car je vous entends cite de toute parti.'\r\n'Ah, madame, je ne suis pas digne de cette eloge.' How I lost my leg? It\r\nwas unfortunately not in the military service of my country. 'Monsieur,\r\nvous avez l'air tres imposant,' and this is accompanied with that look\r\nwhich, without being what Sir John Falstaff calls the 'leer of\r\ninvitation,' amounts to the same thing.... This leads us on, but in the\r\nmidst of the chat arrive letters, one of which is from her lover,\r\nNarbonne, now with his regiment. It brings her to a little recollection,\r\nwhich a little time will, I think, again banish, and a few interviews\r\nwould stimulate her to try the experiment of her fascinations even on\r\nthe native of a new world who has left one of his legs behind him.\"\r\n\r\nAn entry in Morris's Diary previous to this conversation shows that he\r\nhad no very high opinion of this same Monsieur de Narbonne: \"He\r\nconsiders a civil war inevitable, and is about to join his regiment,\r\nbeing, as he says, in a conflict between the dictates of his duty and\r\nhis conscience. I tell him that I know of no duty but that which\r\nconscience dictates. I presume that his conscience will dictate to join\r\nthe strongest side.\"\r\n\r\nMorris's surmises as to his fair friend's happy forgetfulness of her\r\nabsent lover proved true: she soon became bent on a flirtation with the\r\ngood-looking American stranger, and when he failed to make any advances\r\nshe promptly made them herself; told him that she \"rather invited than\r\nrepelled those who were inclined to be attentive,\" and capped this\r\nexhibition of modest feminine reserve by suggesting that \"perhaps he\r\nmight become an admirer.\" Morris dryly responded that it was not\r\nimpossible, but that, as a previous condition, she must agree not to\r\nrepel him,--which she instantly promised. Afterwards, at dinner, \"we\r\nbecome engaged in an animated conversation, and she desires me to speak\r\nEnglish, which her husband does not understand. In looking round the\r\nroom, I observe in him very much emotion, and I tell her that he loves\r\nher distractedly, which she says she knows, and that it renders her\r\nmiserable.... I condole with her a little on her widowhood, the\r\nChevalier de Narbonne being absent in Franche Comte.... She asks me if I\r\ncontinue to think she has a preference for Monsieur de Tonnerre. I reply\r\nonly by observing that each of them has wit enough for one couple, and\r\ntherefore I think they had better separate, and take each a partner who\r\nis _un peu bete_. After dinner I seek a conversation with the husband,\r\nwhich relieves him. He inveighs bitterly [poor, honest Swede] against\r\nthe manners of the country, and the cruelty of alienating a wife's\r\naffection. I regret with him on general grounds that prostitution of\r\nmorals which unfits them for good government, and convince him, I think,\r\nI shall not contribute to making him any more uncomfortable than he\r\nalready is.\" Certainly, according to Morris's evidence, Madame de\r\nStael's sensitive delicacy could only be truthfully portrayed by the\r\nunfettered pen of a Smollett.\r\n\r\nHe was an especial _habitue_ of the salon of Madame de Flahaut, the\r\nfriend of Talleyrand and Montesquieu. She was a perfectly characteristic\r\ntype; a clever, accomplished little woman, fond of writing romances, and\r\na thorough-paced _intriguante_. She had innumerable enthusiasms, with\r\nperhaps a certain amount of sincerity in each, and was a more infatuated\r\npolitical schemer than any of her male friends. She was thoroughly\r\nconversant with the politics of both court and assembly; her \"precision\r\nand justness of thought was very uncommon in either sex,\" and, as time\r\nwent on, made her a willing and useful helper in some of Morris's plans.\r\nWithal she was a mercenary, self-seeking little personage, bent on\r\nincreasing her own fortune by the aid of her political friends. Once,\r\nwhen dining with Morris and Talleyrand, she told them in perfect good\r\nfaith that, if the latter was made minister, \"they must be sure to make\r\na million for her.\"\r\n\r\nShe was much flattered by the deference that Morris showed for her\r\njudgment, and in return let him into not a few state secrets. She and he\r\ntogether drew up a translation of the outline for a constitution for\r\nFrance, which he had prepared, and through her it was forwarded to the\r\nking. Together with her two other intimates, Talleyrand and Montesquieu,\r\nthey made just a party of four, often dining at her house; and when her\r\nhusband was sent to Spain, the dinners became more numerous than ever,\r\nsometimes merely _parties carrees_, sometimes very large entertainments.\r\nMorris records that, small or large, they were invariably \"excellent\r\ndinners, where the conversation was always extremely gay.\"\r\n\r\nOnce they planned out a ministry together, and it must be kept in mind\r\nthat it was quite on the cards that their plan would be adopted. After\r\ndisposing suitably of all the notabilities, some in stations at home,\r\nothers in stations abroad, the scheming little lady turned to Morris:\r\n\"'Enfin,' she says, 'mon ami, vous et moi nous gouvernerons la France.'\r\nIt is an odd combination, but the kingdom is actually in much worse\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation occurred one morning when he had called to find madame\r\nat her toilet, with her dentist in attendance. It was a coarse age, for\r\nall the gilding; and the coarseness was ingrained in the fibre even of\r\nthe most ultra sentimental. At first Morris felt perhaps a little\r\nsurprised at the easy familiarity with which the various ladies whose\r\nfriend he was admitted him to the privacy of boudoir and bedroom, and\r\nchronicles with some amusement the graceful indifference with which one\r\nof them would say to him: \"Monsieur Morris me permettra de faire ma\r\ntoilette?\" But he was far from being a strait-laced man,--in fact, he\r\nwas altogether too much the reverse,--and he soon grew habituated to\r\nthese as well as to much worse customs. However, he notes that the\r\ndifferent operations of the toilet \"were carried on with an entire and\r\nastounding regard to modesty.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Flahaut was a very charming member of the class who, neither\r\ntoiling nor spinning, were supported in luxury by those who did both,\r\nand who died from want while so doing. At this very time, while France\r\nwas rapidly drifting into bankruptcy, the fraudulent pensions given to a\r\nhorde of courtiers, titled placemen, well-born harlots and their\r\noffspring, reached the astounding total of two hundred and seventy odd\r\nmillions of livres. The assembly passed a decree cutting away these\r\npensions right and left, and thereby worked sad havoc in the gay society\r\nthat nothing could render serious but immediate and pressing\r\npoverty,--not even the loom of the terror ahead, growing darker moment\r\nby moment. Calling on his fascinating little friend immediately after\r\nthe decree was published, Morris finds her \"_au desespoir_, and she\r\nintends to cry very loud, she says.... She has been in tears all day.\r\nHer pensions from Monsieur and the Comte d'Artois are stopped. On that\r\nfrom the king she receives but three thousand francs,--and must\r\ntherefore quit Paris. I try to console her, but it is impossible.\r\nIndeed, the stroke is severe; for, with youth, beauty, wit, and every\r\nloveliness, she must quit all she loves, and pass her life with what she\r\nabhors.\" In the time of adversity Morris stood loyally by the friends\r\nwho had treated him so kindly when the world was a merry one, and things\r\nwent well with them. He helped them in every way possible; his time and\r\nhis purse were always at their service; and he performed the difficult\r\nfeat of giving pecuniary assistance with a tact and considerate delicacy\r\nthat prevented the most sensitive from taking offense.\r\n\r\nHe early became acquainted with the Duchess of Orleans, wife of Philippe\r\nEgalite, the vicious voluptuary of liberal leanings and clouded\r\ncharacter. He met her at the house of an old friend, Madame de\r\nChastellux. At first he did not fancy her, and rather held himself\r\naloof, being uncertain \"how he would get on with royalty.\" The duchess,\r\nhowever, was attracted by him, asked after him repeatedly, made their\r\nmutual friends throw them together, and finally so managed that he\r\nbecame one of her constant visitors and attendants. This naturally\r\nflattered him, and he remained sincerely loyal to her always afterwards.\r\nShe was particularly anxious that he should be interested in her son,\r\nthen a boy, afterwards destined to become the citizen king,--not a bad\r\nman, but a mean one, and rather an unkingly king even for the nineteenth\r\ncentury, fertile though it has been in ignoble royalty. Morris's further\r\ndealings with this precious youth will have to be considered hereafter.\r\n\r\nAfter his first interview he notes that the duchess was \"handsome enough\r\nto punish the duke for his irregularities.\" He also mentioned that she\r\nstill seemed in love with her husband. However, the lady was not averse\r\nto seeking a little sentimental consolation from her new friend, to whom\r\nshe confided, in their after intimacy, that she was weary at heart and\r\nnot happy, and--a thoroughly French touch--that she had the \"besoin\r\nd'etre aimee.\" On the day they first met, while he is talking to her,\r\n\"the widow of the late Duke of Orleans comes in, and at going away,\r\naccording to custom, kisses the duchess. I observe that the ladies of\r\nParis are very fond of each other; which gives rise to some observations\r\nfrom her royal highness on the person who has just quitted the room,\r\nwhich show that the kiss does not always betoken great affection. In\r\ngoing away she is pleased to say that she is glad to have met me, and I\r\nbelieve her. The reason is that I dropped some expressions and\r\nsentiments a little rough, which were agreeable because they contrasted\r\nwith the palling polish she meets with everywhere. Hence I conclude that\r\nthe less I have the honor of such good company the better; for when the\r\nnovelty ceases all is over, and I shall probably be worse than insipid.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the \"good company\" was determined he should make one of\r\ntheir number. He was not very loath himself, when he found he was in no\r\ndanger of being patronized,--for anything like patronage was always\r\nparticularly galling to his pride, which was of the kind that resents a\r\ntone of condescension more fiercely than an overt insult,--and he became\r\na fast friend of the house of Orleans. The duchess made him her\r\nconfidant; unfolded to him her woes about the duke; and once, when he\r\nwas dining with her, complained to him bitterly of the duke's conduct in\r\nnot paying her allowance regularly. She was in financial straits at the\r\ntime; for, though she was allowed four hundred and fifty thousand livres\r\na year, yet three hundred and fifty thousand were appropriated for the\r\nhouse-servants, table, etc.,--an item wherein her American friend,\r\nalbeit not over-frugal, thought a very little economy would result in a\r\ngreat saving.\r\n\r\nHis description of one of the days he spent at Raincy with the duchess\r\nand her friends, gives us not only a glimpse of the life of the great\r\nladies and fine gentlemen of the day, but also a clear insight into the\r\nreasons why these same highly polished ladies and gentlemen had utterly\r\nlost their hold over the people whose God-given rulers they deemed\r\nthemselves to be.\r\n\r\n_Dejeuner a la fourchette_ was not served till noon,--Morris\r\ncongratulating himself that he had taken a light breakfast earlier.\r\n\"After breakfast we go to mass in the chapel. In the tribune above we\r\nhave a bishop, an abbe, the duchess, her maids and some of their\r\nfriends. Madame de Chastellux is below on her knees. We are amused above\r\nby a number of little tricks played off by Monsieur de Segur and\r\nMonsieur de Cabieres with a candle, which is put into the pockets of\r\ndifferent gentlemen, the bishop among the rest, and lighted, while they\r\nare otherwise engaged, (for there is a fire in the tribune,) to the\r\ngreat merriment of the spectators. Immoderate laughter is the\r\nconsequence. The duchess preserves as much gravity as she can. This\r\nscene must be very edifying to the domestics who are opposite to us,\r\nand the villagers who worship below.\" The afternoon's amusements were\r\nnot to his taste. They all walked, which he found very hot; then they\r\ngot into bateaux, and the gentlemen rowed the ladies, which was still\r\nhotter; and then there came more walking, so he was glad to get back to\r\nthe chateau. The formal dinner was served after five; the conversation\r\nthereat varied between the vicious and the frivolous. There was much\r\nbantering, well-bred in manner and excessively under-bred in matter,\r\nbetween the different guests of both sexes, about the dubious episodes\r\nin their past careers, and the numerous shady spots in their respective\r\ncharacters. Epigrams and \"epitaphs\" were bandied about freely, some in\r\nverse, some not; probably very amusing then, but their lustre sadly\r\ntarnished in the eyes of those who read them now. While they were\r\ndining, \"a number of persons surround the windows, doubtless from a high\r\nidea of the company, to whom they are obliged to look up at an awful\r\ndistance. Oh, did they but know how trivial the conversation, how very\r\ntrivial the characters, their respect would soon be changed to an\r\nemotion entirely different!\"\r\n\r\nThis was but a month before the Bastile fell; and yet, on the threshold\r\nof their hideous doom, the people who had most at stake were incapable\r\nnot only of intelligent action to ward off their fate, but even of\r\nserious thought as to what their fate would be. The men--the nobles, the\r\nclerical dignitaries, and the princes of the blood--chose the church as\r\na place wherein to cut antics that would have better befitted a pack of\r\nmonkeys; while the women, their wives and mistresses, exchanged with\r\nthem impure jests at their own expense, relished because of the truth on\r\nwhich they rested. Brutes might still have held sway at least for a\r\ntime; but these were merely vicious triflers. They did not believe in\r\ntheir religion; they did not believe in themselves; they did not believe\r\nin anything. They had no earnestness, no seriousness; their\r\nsensibilities and enthusiasms were alike affectations. There was still\r\nplenty of fire and purpose and furious energy in the hearts of the\r\nFrench people; but these and all the other virile virtues lay not among\r\nthe noblesse, but among the ranks of the common herd beneath them,\r\ndown-trodden, bloody in their wayward ferocity, but still capable of\r\nfierce, heroic devotion to an ideal in which they believed, and for\r\nwhich they would spill the blood of others, or pour out their own, with\r\nthe proud waste of utter recklessness.\r\n\r\nMany of Morris's accounts of the literary life of the salon read as if\r\nthey were explanatory notes to \"Les Precieuses Ridicules.\" There was a\r\ncertain pretentiousness about it that made it a bit of a sham at the\r\nbest; and the feebler variety of salon, built on such a foundation, thus\r\nbecame that most despicable of things, an imitation of a pretense. At\r\none of the dinners which Morris describes, the company was of a kind\r\nthat would have done no discredit to an entertainment of the great\r\nsocial and literary light of Eatanswill. \"Set off in great haste to dine\r\nwith the Comtesse de R., on an invitation of a week's standing. Arrive\r\nat about a quarter past three, and find in the drawing-room some dirty\r\nlinen and no fire. While a waiting-woman takes away one, a valet lights\r\nup the other. Three small sticks in a deep bed of ashes give no great\r\nexpectation of heat. By the smoke, however, all doubts are removed\r\nrespecting the existence of fire. To expel the smoke, a window is\r\nopened, and, the day being cold, I have the benefit of as fresh air as\r\ncan reasonably be expected in so large a city.\r\n\r\n\"Towards four o'clock the guests begin to assemble, and I begin to\r\nexpect that, as madame is a poetess, I shall have the honor to dine with\r\nthat exalted part of the species who devote themselves to the muses. In\r\neffect, the gentlemen begin to compliment their respective works; and,\r\nas regular hours cannot be expected in a house where the mistress is\r\noccupied more with the intellectual than the material world, I have a\r\ndelightful prospect of a continuance of the scene. Towards five, madame\r\nsteps in to announce dinner, and the hungry poets advance to the charge.\r\nAs they bring good appetites, they have certainly reason to praise the\r\nfeast. And I console myself with the persuasion that for this day at\r\nleast I shall escape an indigestion. A very narrow escape, too, for some\r\nrancid butter, of which the cook had been liberal, puts me in bodily\r\nfear. If the repast is not abundant, we have at least the consolation\r\nthat there is no lack of conversation. Not being perfectly master of the\r\nlanguage, most of the jests escaped me. As for the rest of the company,\r\neach being employed either in saying a good thing, or else in studying\r\none to say, it is no wonder if he cannot find time to applaud that of\r\nhis neighbors. They all agree that we live in an age alike deficient in\r\njustice and in taste. Each finds in the fate of his own works numerous\r\ninstances to justify this censure. They tell me, to my great surprise,\r\nthat the public now condemn theatrical compositions before they have\r\nheard the first recital. And, to remove my doubts, the comtesse is so\r\nkind as to assure me that this rash decision has been made on one of\r\nher own pieces. In pitying modern degeneracy, we rise from the table.\r\n\r\n\"I take my leave immediately after the coffee, which by no means\r\ndishonors the precedent repast; and madame informs me that on Tuesdays\r\nand Thursdays she is always at home, and will always be glad to see me.\r\nWhile I stammer out some return to the compliment, my heart, convinced\r\nof my unworthiness to partake of such attic entertainments, makes me\r\npromise never again to occupy the place from which perhaps I had\r\nexcluded a worthier personage.\"\r\n\r\nAmong Morris's other qualities, he was the first to develop that\r\npeculiarly American vein of humor which is especially fond of gravely\r\npretending to believe without reserve some preposterously untrue\r\nassertion,--as throughout the above quotation.\r\n\r\nThough the society in which he was thrown interested him, he always\r\nregarded it with half-sarcastic amusement, and at times it bored him\r\ngreatly. Meditating on the conversation in \"this upper region of wits\r\nand graces,\" he concludes that \"the sententious style\" is the one best\r\nfitted for it, and that in it \"observations with more of justice than\r\nsplendor cannot amuse,\" and sums up by saying that \"he could not please,\r\nbecause he was not sufficiently pleased.\"\r\n\r\nHis comments upon the various distinguished men he met are always\r\ninteresting, on account of the quick, accurate judgment of character\r\nwhich they show. It was this insight into the feelings and ideas alike\r\nof the leaders and of their followers which made his political\r\npredictions often so accurate. His judgment of many of his\r\ncontemporaries comes marvelously near the cooler estimate of history.\r\n\r\nHe was originally prejudiced in favor of the king, poor Louis XVI., and,\r\nbelieving him \"to be an honest and good man, he sincerely wished him\r\nwell,\" but he very soon began to despise him for his weakness. This\r\nquality was the exact one that under existing circumstances was\r\nabsolutely fatal; and Morris mentions it again and again, pronouncing\r\nthe king \"a well-meaning man, but extremely weak, without genius or\r\neducation to show the way towards that good which he desires,\" and \"a\r\nprince so weak that he can influence very little either by his presence\r\nor absence.\" Finally, in a letter to Washington, he gives a biting\r\nsketch of the unfortunate monarch. \"If the reigning prince were not the\r\nsmall-beer character that he is, there can be but little doubt that,\r\nwatching events and making a tolerable use of them, he would regain his\r\nauthority; but what will you have from a creature who, situated as he\r\nis, eats and drinks, sleeps well and laughs, and is as merry a grig as\r\nlives? The idea that they will give him some money, which he can\r\neconomize, and that he will have no trouble in governing, contents him\r\nentirely. Poor man! He little thinks how unstable is his situation. He\r\nis beloved, but it is not with the sort of love which a monarch should\r\ninspire. It is that kind of good-natured pity which one feels for a led\r\ncaptive. There is besides no possibility of serving him, for at the\r\nslightest show of opposition he gives up everything and every person.\"\r\nMorris had too robust a mind to feel the least regard for mere\r\namiability and good intentions when unaccompanied by any of the ruder,\r\nmanlier virtues.\r\n\r\nThe Count d'Artois had \"neither sense to counsel himself, nor to choose\r\ncounsellors for himself, much less to counsel others.\" This gentleman,\r\nafterwards Charles X., stands as perhaps the most shining example of the\r\nmonumental ineptitude of his royal house. His fellow Bourbon, the\r\namiable Bomba of Naples, is his only equal for dull silliness, crass\r\nimmorality, and the lack of every manly or kingly virtue. Democracy has\r\nmuch to answer for, but after all it would be hard to find, even among\r\nthe aldermen of New York and Chicago, men whose moral and mental\r\nshortcomings would put them lower than this royal couple. To our shame\r\nbe it said, our system of popular government once let our greatest city\r\nfall under the control of Tweed; but it would be rank injustice to that\r\nclever rogue to compare him with the two vicious dullards whom the\r\nopposite system permitted to tyrannize at Paris and Naples. Moreover, in\r\nthe end, we of the democracy not only overthrew the evil-doer who\r\noppressed us, but also put him in prison; and in the long run we have\r\nusually meted out the same justice to our lesser criminals. Government\r\nby manhood suffrage shows at its worst in large cities; and yet even in\r\nthese experience certainly does not show that a despotism works a whit\r\nbetter, or as well.\r\n\r\nMorris described the Count de Montmorin pithily, saying: \"He has more\r\nunderstanding than people in general imagine, and he means well, very\r\nwell, but he means it feebly.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Morris came to France, Necker was the most prominent man in the\r\nkingdom. He was a hard-working, well-meaning, conceited person, not in\r\nthe least fitted for public affairs, a banker but not a financier, and\r\naffords a beautiful illustration of the utter futility of the popular\r\nbelief that a good business man will necessarily be a good statesman.\r\nAccident had made him the most conspicuous figure of the government,\r\nadmired and hated, but not looked down upon; yet Morris saw through him\r\nat a glance. After their first meeting, he writes down in his diary: \"He\r\nhas the look and manner of the counting-house, and, being dressed in\r\nembroidered velvet, he contrasts strongly with his habiliments. His bow,\r\nhis address, say, 'I am the man.' ... If he is really a very great man,\r\nI am deceived; and yet this is a rash judgment. If he is not a laborious\r\nman, I am also deceived.\" He soon saw that both the blame and the praise\r\nbestowed on him were out of all proportion to his consequence, and he\r\nwrote: \"In their anguish [the nobles] curse Necker, who is in fact less\r\nthe cause than the instrument of their sufferings. His popularity\r\ndepends now more on the opposition he meets with from one party than any\r\nserious regard of the other. It is the attempt to throw him down which\r\nsaves him from falling; ... as it is, he must soon fall.\" To Washington\r\nhe gave a fuller analysis of his character. \"As to M. Necker, he is one\r\nof those people who has obtained a much greater reputation than he has\r\nany right to.... In his public administration he has always been honest\r\nand disinterested; which proves well, I think, for his former private\r\nconduct, or else it proves that he has more vanity than cupidity. Be\r\nthat as it may, an unspotted integrity as minister, and serving at his\r\nown expense in an office which others seek for the purpose of enriching\r\nthemselves, have acquired for him very deservedly much confidence. Add\r\nto this that his writings on finance teem with that sort of sensibility\r\nwhich makes the fortune of modern romances, and which is exactly suited\r\nto this lively nation, who love to read but hate to think. Hence his\r\nreputation. He ... [has not] the talents of a great minister. His\r\neducation as a banker has taught him to make tight bargains, and put him\r\nupon his guard against projects. But though he understands man as a\r\ncovetous creature, he does not understand mankind,--a defect which is\r\nremediless. He is utterly ignorant of politics, by which I mean politics\r\nin the great sense, or that sublime science which embraces for its\r\nobject the happiness of mankind. Consequently he neither knows what\r\nconstitution to form, nor how to obtain the consent of others to such as\r\nhe wishes. From the moment of convening the states-general, he has been\r\nafloat upon the wide ocean of incidents. But what is most extraordinary\r\nis that M. Necker is a very poor financier. This I know will sound like\r\nheresy in the ears of most people, but it is true. The plans he has\r\nproposed are feeble and inept.\"\r\n\r\nA far more famous man, Talleyrand, then Bishop of Autun, he also gauged\r\ncorrectly from the start, writing down that he appeared to be \"a sly,\r\ncool, cunning, ambitious, and malicious man. I know not why conclusions\r\nso disadvantageous to him are formed in my mind, but so it is, and I\r\ncannot help it.\" He was afterwards obliged to work much in common with\r\nTalleyrand, for both took substantially the same view of public affairs\r\nin that crisis, and were working for a common end. Speaking of his new\r\nally's plan respecting church property, he says: \"He is bigoted to it,\r\nand the thing is well enough; but the mode is not so well. He is\r\nattached to this _as an author_, which is not a good sign for a man of\r\nbusiness.\" And again he criticises Talleyrand's management of certain\r\nschemes for the finances, as showing a willingness \"to sacrifice great\r\nobjects for the sake of small ones ... an inverse ratio of moral\r\nproportion.\"\r\n\r\nMorris was fond of Lafayette, and appreciated highly his courage and\r\nkeen sense of honor; but he did not think much of his ability, and\r\nbecame at times very impatient with his vanity and his impractical\r\ntheories. Besides, he deemed him a man who was carried away by the\r\ncurrent, and could neither stem nor guide it. \"I have known my friend\r\nLafayette now for many years, and can estimate at the just value both\r\nhis words and actions. He means ill to no one, but he is very much below\r\nthe business he has undertaken; and if the sea runs high, he will be\r\nunable to hold the helm.\" And again, in writing to Washington:\r\n\"Unluckily he has given in to measures ... which he does not heartily\r\napprove, and he heartily approves many things which experience will\r\ndemonstrate to be dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThe misshapen but mighty genius of Mirabeau he found more difficulty in\r\nestimating; he probably never rated it quite high enough. He naturally\r\nscorned a man of such degraded debauchery, who, having been one of the\r\ngreat inciters to revolution, had now become a subsidized ally of the\r\ncourt. He considered him \"one of the most unprincipled scoundrels that\r\never lived,\" although of \"superior talents,\" and \"so profligate that he\r\nwould disgrace any administration,\" besides having so little principle\r\nas to make it unsafe to trust him. After his death he thus sums him up:\r\n\"Vices both degrading and detestable marked this extraordinary being.\r\nCompletely prostitute, he sacrificed everything to the whim of the\r\nmoment;--_cupidus alieni prodigus sui_; venal, shameless; and yet\r\ngreatly virtuous when pushed by a prevailing impulse, but never truly\r\nvirtuous, because never under the steady control of reason, nor the\r\nfirm authority of principle. I have seen this man, in the short space of\r\ntwo years, hissed, honored, hated, mourned. Enthusiasm has just now\r\npresented him gigantic. Time and reflection will sink this stature.\"\r\nEven granting this to be wholly true, as it undoubtedly is in the main,\r\nit was nevertheless the fact that in Mirabeau alone lay the least hope\r\nof salvation for the French nation; and Morris erred in strenuously\r\nopposing Lafayette's going into a ministry with him. Indeed, he seems in\r\nthis case to have been blinded by prejudice, and certainly acted very\r\ninconsistently; for his advice, and the reasons he gave for it, were\r\ncompletely at variance with the rules he himself laid down to Lafayette,\r\nwith even more cynicism than common sense, when the latter once made\r\nsome objections to certain proposed coadjutors of his: \"I state to him\r\n... that, as to the objections he has made on the score of morals in\r\nsome, he must consider that men do not go into an administration as the\r\ndirect road to heaven; that they are prompted by ambition or avarice,\r\nand therefore that the only way to secure the most virtuous is by making\r\nit their interest to act rightly.\"\r\n\r\nMorris thus despised the king, and distrusted the chief political\r\nleaders; and, as he wrote Washington, he was soon convinced that there\r\nwas an immense amount of corruption in the upper circles. The people at\r\nlarge he disliked even more than he did their advisers, and he had good\r\ngrounds, too, as the following extract from his journal shows: \"July\r\n22d. After dinner, walk a little under the arcade of the Palais Royal,\r\nwaiting for my carriage. In this period the head and body of M. de\r\nToulon are introduced in triumph, the head on a pike, the body dragged\r\nnaked on the earth. Afterwards this horrible exhibition is carried\r\nthrough the different streets. His crime is, to have accepted a place in\r\nthe ministry. This mutilated form of an old man of seventy-five is shown\r\nto his son-in-law, Berthier, the intendant of Paris; and afterwards he\r\nalso is put to death and cut to pieces, the populace carrying about the\r\nmangled fragments with a savage joy. Gracious God, what a people!\"\r\n\r\nHe describes at length, and most interestingly, the famous opening of\r\nthe states-general, \"the beginning of the Revolution.\" He eyed this body\r\neven at the beginning with great distrust; and he never thought that any\r\nof the delegates showed especial capacity for grappling with the\r\nterrible dangers and difficulties by which they were encompassed. He\r\ncomments on the extreme enthusiasm with which the king was greeted, and\r\nsympathizes strongly with Marie Antoinette, who was treated with\r\nstudied and insulting coldness. \"She was exceedingly hurt. I cannot help\r\nfeeling the mortification which the poor queen meets with, for I see\r\nonly the woman; and it seems unmanly to treat a woman with\r\nunkindness.... Not one voice is heard to wish her well. I would\r\ncertainly raise mine if I were a Frenchman; but I have no right to\r\nexpress a sentiment, and in vain solicit those who are near me to do\r\nit.\" ... At last \"the queen rises, and, to my great satisfaction, she\r\nhears, for the first time in several months, the sound of '_Vive la\r\nreine!_' She makes a low courtesy, and this produces a louder\r\nacclamation, and that a lower courtesy.\"\r\n\r\nThe sympathy was for the woman, not the queen, the narrow-minded,\r\nabsolute sovereign, the intriguer against popular government, whose\r\npolicy was as heavily fraught with bale for the nation as was that of\r\nRobespierre himself. The king was more than competent to act as his own\r\nevil genius; had he not been, Marie Antoinette would have amply filled\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nHe characterized the carrying of \"that diabolical castle,\" the Bastile,\r\nas \"among the most extraordinary things I have met with.\" The day it\r\ntook place he wrote in his journal, with an irony very modern in its\r\nflavor: \"Yesterday it was the fashion at Versailles not to believe that\r\nthere were any disturbances at Paris. I presume that this day's\r\ntransactions will induce a conviction that all is not perfectly quiet.\"\r\n\r\nHe used the Bastile as a text when, shortly afterwards, he read a brief\r\nlesson to a certain eminent painter. The latter belonged to that class\r\nof artists with pen or pencil (only too plentiful in America at the\r\npresent day) who always insist on devoting their energies to depicting\r\nsubjects worn threadbare by thousands of predecessors, instead of\r\nworking in the new, broad fields, filled with picturesque material,\r\nopened to them by their own country and its history. \"The painter shows\r\nus a piece he is now about for the king, taken from the AEneid: Venus\r\nrestraining the arm which is raised in the temple of the Vestals to shed\r\nthe blood of Helen. I tell him he had better paint the storm of the\r\nBastile.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMISSION TO ENGLAND: RETURN TO PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, 1790, Morris went to London, in obedience to a letter received\r\nfrom Washington appointing him private agent to the British government,\r\nand enclosing him the proper credentials.\r\n\r\nCertain of the conditions of the treaty of peace between Great Britain\r\nand the United States, although entered into seven years before, were\r\nstill unfulfilled. It had been stipulated that the British should give\r\nup the fortified frontier posts within our territory, and should pay for\r\nthe negroes they had taken away from the Southern States during the war.\r\nThey had done neither, and Morris was charged to find out what the\r\nintentions of the government were in the matter. He was also to find out\r\nwhether there was a disposition to enter into a commercial treaty with\r\nthe United States; and finally, he was to sound them as to their sending\r\na minister to America.\r\n\r\nOn our part we had also failed to fulfil a portion of our treaty\r\nobligations, not having complied with the article which provided for the\r\npayment of debts due before the war to British merchants. Both sides had\r\nbeen to blame; each, of course, blamed only the other. But now, when we\r\nwere ready to perform our part, the British refused to perform theirs.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, Morris, although he spent most of the year in\r\nLondon, failed to accomplish anything. The feeling in England was\r\nhostile to America; to the king, in particular, the very name was\r\nhateful. The English were still sore over their defeat, and hated us\r\nbecause we had been victors; and yet they despised us also, for they\r\nthought we should be absolutely powerless except when we were acting\r\nmerely on the defensive. From the days of the Revolution till the days\r\nof the Civil War, the ruling classes of England were bitterly\r\nantagonistic to our nation; they always saw with glee any check to our\r\nnational well-being: they wished us ill, and exulted in our\r\nmisfortunes, while they sneered at our successes. The results have\r\nbeen lasting, and now work much more to their hurt than to ours. The\r\npast conduct of England certainly offers much excuse for, though it\r\ncannot in the least justify, the unreasonable and virulent\r\nanti-English feeling--that is, the feeling against Englishmen\r\npolitically and nationally, not socially or individually--which is so\r\nstrong in many parts of our country where the native American blood is\r\npurest.\r\n\r\nThe English ministry in 1790 probably had the general feeling of the\r\nnation behind them in their determination to injure us as much as they\r\ncould; at any rate, their aim seemed to be, as far as lay in them, to\r\nembitter our already existing hostility to their empire. They not only\r\nrefused to grant us any substantial justice, but they were inclined to\r\ninflict on us and on our representatives those petty insults which\r\nrankle longer than injuries.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to this point, however, Morris was quite able to hold his\r\nown. He had a ready, biting tongue; and, excepting Pitt and Fox, was\r\nintellectually superior to any of the public men whom he met. In social\r\nposition, even as they understood it, he was their equal; they could\r\nhardly look down on the brother of a British major-general, and a\r\nbrother-in-law of the Duchess of Gordon. He was a man of rather fiery\r\ncourage, and any attacks upon his country were not likely to be made\r\ntwice in his presence. Besides, he never found the English congenial as\r\nfriends or companions; he could not sympathize, or indeed get along\r\nwell, with them. This distaste for their society he always retained, and\r\nthough he afterwards grew to respect them, and to be their warm\r\npartisan politically, he was at this time much more friendly to France,\r\nand was even helping the French ministers concoct a scheme of warfare\r\nagainst their neighbor. To his bright, impatient temperament, the\r\nEnglish awkwardness seemed to be an insuperable obstacle to bringing\r\npeople together \"as in other countries.\" He satirized the English\r\ndrawing-rooms, \"where the arrangement of the company was stiff and\r\nformal, the ladies all ranged in battalia on one side of the room;\" and\r\nremarked \"that the French, having no liberty in their government, have\r\ncompensated to themselves that misfortune by bestowing a great deal upon\r\nsociety. But that, I fear, in England, is all confined to the House of\r\nCommons.\" Years afterwards he wrote to a friend abroad: \"Have you\r\nreflected that there is more of real society in one week at [a\r\nContinental watering-place] than in a London year? Recollect that a\r\ntedious morning, a great dinner, a boozy afternoon, and dull evening\r\nmake the sum total of English life. It is admirable for young men who\r\nshoot, hunt, drink,--but for us! How are we to dispose of ourselves? No.\r\nWere I to give you a rendezvous in Europe, it should be on the\r\ncontinent. I respect, as you know, the English nation highly, and love\r\nmany individuals among them, but I do not love their manners.\" Times\r\nhave changed, and the manners of the Islanders with them. Exactly as the\r\n\"rude Carinthian boor\" has become the most polished of mortals, so,\r\nafter a like transformation, English society is now perhaps the\r\npleasantest and most interesting in Europe. Were Morris alive to-day, he\r\nwould probably respect the English as much as he ever did, and like them\r\na good deal more; and, while he might well have his preference for his\r\nown country confirmed, yet, if he had to go abroad, it is hard to\r\nbelieve that he would now pass by London in favor of any continental\r\ncapital or watering-place.\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging Washington's letter of appointment, Morris wrote that\r\nhe did not expect much difficulty, save from the king himself, who was\r\nvery obstinate, and bore a personal dislike to his former subjects. But\r\nhis interviews with the minister of foreign affairs, the Duke of Leeds,\r\nsoon undeceived him. The duke met him with all the little tricks of\r\ndelay, and evasion, known to old-fashioned diplomacy; tricks that are\r\nalways greatly relished by men of moderate ability, and which are\r\nsuccessful enough where the game is not very important, as in the\r\npresent instance, but are nearly useless when the stakes are high and\r\nthe adversary determined. The worthy nobleman was profuse in\r\nexpressions of general good-will, and vague to a degree in his answers\r\nto every concrete question; affected to misunderstand what was asked of\r\nhim, and, when he could not do this \"slumbered profoundly\" for weeks\r\nbefore making his reply. Morris wrote that \"his explanatory comments\r\nwere more unintelligible than his texts,\" and was delighted when he\r\nheard that he might be replaced by Lord Hawksbury; for the latter,\r\nalthough strongly anti-American, \"would at least be an efficient\r\nminister,\" whereas the former was \"evidently afraid of committing\r\nhimself by saying or doing anything positive.\" He soon concluded that\r\nGreat Britain was so uncertain as to how matters were going in Europe\r\nthat she wished to keep us in a similar state of suspense. She had\r\nrecovered with marvelous rapidity from the effects of the great war; she\r\nwas felt on all sides to hold a position of commanding power; this she\r\nknew well, and so felt like driving a very hard bargain with any nation,\r\nespecially with a weak one that she hated. It was particularly difficult\r\nto form a commercial treaty. There were very many Englishmen who agreed\r\nwith a Mr. Irwin, \"a mighty sour sort of creature,\" who assured Morris\r\nthat he was utterly opposed to all American trade in grain, and that he\r\nwished to oblige the British people, by the force of starvation, to\r\nraise enough corn for their own consumption. Fox told Morris that he and\r\nBurke were about the only two men left who believed that Americans\r\nshould be allowed to trade in their own bottoms to the British Islands;\r\nand he also informed him that Pitt was not hostile to America, but\r\nsimply indifferent, being absorbed in European matters, and allowing his\r\ncolleagues free hands.\r\n\r\nBecoming impatient at the long-continued delay, Morris finally wrote,\r\nvery courteously but very firmly, demanding some sort of answer, and\r\nthis produced a momentary activity, and assurances that he was under a\r\nmisapprehension as to the delay, etc. The subject of the impressment of\r\nAmerican sailors into British men-of-war,--a matter of chronic complaint\r\nthroughout our first forty years of national life,--now came up; and he\r\nremarked to the Duke of Leeds, with a pithy irony that should have made\r\nthe saying famous: \"I believe, my lord, that this is the only instance\r\nin which we are not treated as aliens.\" He proposed a plan which would\r\nhave at least partially obviated the difficulties in the way of a\r\nsettlement of the matter, but the duke would do nothing. Neither would\r\nhe come to any agreement in reference to the exchange of ministers\r\nbetween the two countries.\r\n\r\nThen came an interview with Pitt, and Morris, seeing how matters stood,\r\nnow spoke out perfectly clearly. In answer to the accusations about our\r\nfailure wholly to perform certain stipulations of the treaty, after\r\nreciting the counter accusations of the Americans, he brushed them all\r\naside with the remark: \"But, sir, what I have said tends to show that\r\nthese complaints and inquiries are excellent if the parties mean to keep\r\nasunder; if they wish to come together, all such matters should be kept\r\nout of sight.\" He showed that the House of Representatives, in a\r\nfriendly spirit, had recently decided against laying extraordinary\r\nrestrictions on British vessels in our ports. \"Mr. Pitt said that,\r\ninstead of restrictions, we ought to give them particular privileges, in\r\nreturn for those we enjoy here. I assured him that I knew of none except\r\nthat of being impressed, a privilege which of all others we least wished\r\nto partake of.... Mr. Pitt said seriously that they had certainly\r\nevinced good-will to us by what they had done respecting our commerce. I\r\nreplied therefore, with like seriousness, that their regulations had\r\nbeen dictated with a view to their own interests; and therefore, as we\r\nfelt no favor, we owed no obligation.\" Morris realized thoroughly that\r\nthey were keeping matters in suspense because their behavior would\r\ndepend upon the contingencies of war or peace with the neighboring\r\npowers; he wished to show that, if they acted thus, we would also bide\r\nour time till the moment came to strike a telling blow; and accordingly\r\nhe ended by telling Pitt, with straightforward directness, a truth that\r\nwas also a threat: \"We do not think it worth while to go to war with you\r\nfor the [frontier] forts; but we know our rights, and will avail\r\nourselves of them when time and circumstances may suit.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation he became convinced that we should wait until\r\nEngland herself felt the necessity of a treaty before trying to\r\nnegotiate one. He wrote Washington \"that those who, pursuing the\r\ninterests of Great Britain, wish to be on the best terms with America,\r\nare outnumbered by those whose sour prejudice and hot resentment render\r\nthem averse to any intercourse except that which may immediately\r\nsubserve a selfish policy. These men do not yet know America. Perhaps\r\nAmerica does not yet know herself.... We are yet in but the seeding-time\r\nof national prosperity, and it will be well not to mortgage the crop\r\nbefore it is gathered.... England will not, I am persuaded, enter into a\r\ntreaty with us unless we give for it more than it is worth now, and\r\ninfinitely more than it will be worth hereafter. A present bargain would\r\nbe that of a young heir with an old usurer.... But, should war break\r\nout [with a European power], the anti-American party here will agree to\r\n_any_ terms; for it is more the taste of the medicine which they\r\nnauseate than the quantity of the dose.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly all negotiations were broken off. In America his enemies\r\nblamed Morris for this failure. They asserted that his haughty manners\r\nand proud bearing had made him unpopular with the ministers, and that\r\nhis consorting with members of the opposition had still further damaged\r\nhis cause. The last assertion was wholly untrue; for he had barely more\r\nthan met Fox and his associates. But on a third point there was genuine\r\nreason for dissatisfaction. Morris had confided his purpose to the\r\nFrench minister at London, M. de la Luzerne, doing so because he trusted\r\nto the latter's honor, and did not wish to seem to take any steps\r\nunknown to our ally; and he was in all probability also influenced by\r\nhis constant association and intimacy with the French leaders. Luzerne,\r\nhowever, promptly used the information for his own purposes, letting the\r\nEnglish ministers know that he was acquainted with Morris's objects, and\r\nthus increasing the weight of France by making it appear that America\r\nacted only with her consent and advice. The affair curiously illustrates\r\nJay's wisdom eight years before, when he insisted on keeping Luzerne's\r\nsuperior at that time, Vergennes, in the dark as to our course during\r\nthe peace negotiations. However, it is not at all likely that Mr. Pitt\r\nor the Duke of Leeds were influenced in their course by anything Luzerne\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nLeaving London, Morris made a rapid trip through the Netherlands and up\r\nthe Rhine. His journals, besides the usual comments on the inns, the bad\r\nroads, poor horses, sulky postilions, and the like, are filled with very\r\ninteresting observations on the character of the country through which\r\nhe passed, its soil and inhabitants, and the indications they afforded\r\nof the national resources. He liked to associate with people of every\r\nkind, and he was intensely fond of natural scenery; but, what seems\r\nrather surprising in a man of his culture, he apparently cared very\r\nlittle for the great cathedrals, the picture galleries, and the works of\r\nart for which the old towns he visited were so famous.\r\n\r\nHe reached Paris at the end of November, but was almost immediately\r\ncalled to London again, returning in January, 1791, and making three or\r\nfour similar trips in the course of the year. His own business affairs\r\ntook up a great deal of his time. He was engaged in very many different\r\noperations, out of which he made a great deal of money, being a shrewd\r\nbusiness man with a strong dash of the speculator. He had to prosecute a\r\nsuit against the farmers-general of France for a large quantity of\r\ntobacco shipped them by contract; and he gives a very amusing\r\ndescription of the visits he made to the judges before whom the case was\r\nto be tried. Their occupations were certainly various, being those of a\r\nfarrier, a goldsmith, a grocer, a currier, a woolen draper, and a\r\nbookseller respectively. As a sample of his efforts, take the following:\r\n\"Return home and dine. At five resume my visits to my judges, and first\r\nwait upon the honorable M. Gillet, the grocer, who is in a little cuddy\r\nadjoining his shop, at cards. He assures me that the court are\r\nimpartial, and alike uninfluenced by farmers, receivers, and grand\r\nseigneurs; that they are generally of the same opinion; that he will do\r\neverything in his power; and the like. _De l'autre cote_, perfect\r\nconfidence in the ability and integrity of the court. Wish only to bring\r\nthe cause to such a point as that I may have the honor to present a\r\nmemorial. Am vastly sorry to have been guilty of an intrusion upon the\r\namusements of his leisure hours. Hope he will excuse the solicitude of a\r\nstranger, and patronize a claim of such evident justice. The whole goes\r\noff very well, though I with difficulty restrain my risible\r\nfaculties.... A disagreeable scene, the ridicule of which is so strongly\r\npainted to my own eyes that I cannot forbear laughing.\"\r\n\r\nHe also contracted to deliver Necker twenty thousand barrels of flour\r\nfor the relief of Paris; wherein, by the way, he lost heavily. He took\r\npart in sundry shipping operations. Perhaps the most lucrative business\r\nin which he was engaged was in negotiating the sale of wild lands in\r\nAmerica. He even made many efforts to buy the Virginian and\r\nPennsylvanian domains of the Fairfaxes and the Penns. On behalf of a\r\nsyndicate, he endeavored to purchase the American debts to France and\r\nSpain; these being purely speculative efforts, as it was supposed that\r\nthe debts could be obtained at quite a low figure, while, under the new\r\nConstitution, the United States would certainly soon make arrangements\r\nfor paying them off. These various operations entailed a wonderful\r\namount of downright hard work; yet all the while he remained not only a\r\nclose observer of French politics, but, to a certain extent, even an\r\nactor in them.\r\n\r\nHe called upon Lafayette as soon as he was again established in Paris,\r\nafter his mission to London. He saw that affairs had advanced to such a\r\npitch in France that \"it was no longer a question of liberty, but\r\nsimply who shall be master.\" He had no patience with those who wished\r\nthe king to place himself, as they phrased it, at the head of the\r\nRevolution, remarking: \"The trade of a revolutionist appears to me a\r\nhard one for a prince.\" What with the folly of one side and the madness\r\nof the other, things were going to pieces very rapidly. At one of his\r\nold haunts, the club, the \"sentiment aristocratique\" had made great\r\nheadway: one of his friends, De Moustin, now in favor with the king and\r\nqueen, was \"as usual on the high ropes of royal prerogative.\" Lafayette,\r\nhowever, was still wedded to his theories, and did not appear over-glad\r\nto see his American friend, all whose ideas and habits of thought were\r\nso opposed to his own; while madame was still cooler in her reception.\r\nMorris, nothing daunted, talked to his friend very frankly and\r\nseriously. He told him that the time had come when all good citizens\r\nwould be obliged, simply from lack of choice, to cling to the throne;\r\nthat the executive must be strengthened, and good and able men put into\r\nthe council. He pronounced the \"thing called a constitution\" good for\r\nnothing, and showed that the National Assembly was rapidly falling into\r\ncontempt. He pointed out, for the hundredth time, that each country\r\nneeded to have its own form of government; that an American\r\nconstitution would not do for France, for the latter required an even\r\nhigher-toned system than that of England; and that, above all things,\r\nFrance needed stability. He gave the reasons for his advice clearly and\r\nforcibly; but poor Lafayette flinched from it, and could not be\r\npersuaded to take any effectual step.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read Morris's shrewd comments on the events of the\r\nday, and his plans in reference to them, without wondering that France\r\nherself should at the crisis have failed to produce any statesmen to\r\nbe compared with him for force, insight, and readiness to do what was\r\npractically best under the circumstances; but her past history for\r\ngenerations had been such as to make it out of the question for her to\r\nbring forth such men as the founders of our own government. Warriors,\r\nlawgivers, and diplomats she had in abundance. Statesmen who would be\r\nboth hard-headed and true-hearted, who would be wise and yet\r\nunselfish, who would enact laws for a free people that would make that\r\npeople freer still, and yet hinder them from doing wrong to their\r\nneighbors,--statesmen of this order she neither had nor could have\r\nhad. Indeed, had there been such, it may well be doubted if they could\r\nhave served France. With a people who made up in fickle ferocity what\r\nthey lacked in self-restraint, and a king too timid and short-sighted\r\nto turn any crisis to advantage, the French statesmen, even had they\r\nbeen as wise as they were foolish, would hardly have been able to\r\narrest or alter the march of events. Morris said bitterly that France\r\nwas the country where everything was talked of, and where hardly\r\nanything was understood.\r\n\r\nHe told Lafayette that he thought the only hope of the kingdom lay in a\r\nforeign war; it is possible that the idea may have been suggested to him\r\nby Lafayette's naive remark that he believed his troops would readily\r\nfollow him into action, but that they would not mount guard when it\r\nrained. Morris not only constantly urged the French ministers to make\r\nwar, but actually drew up a plan of campaign for them. He believed it\r\nwould turn the popular ardor, now constantly inflamed against the\r\naristocrats, into a new channel, and that \"there was no word perhaps in\r\nthe dictionary which would take the place of _aristocrat_ so readily as\r\n_Anglais_.\" In proof of the wisdom of his propositions he stated, with\r\nabsolute truthfulness: \"If Britain had declared war in 1774 against the\r\nhouse of Bourbon, the now United States would have bled freely in her\r\ncause.\" He was disgusted with the littleness of the men who, appalled at\r\ntheir own surroundings, and unable to make shift even for the moment,\r\nfound themselves thrown by chance to the helm, and face to face with the\r\nwildest storm that had ever shaken a civilized government. Speaking of\r\none of the new ministers, he remarked: \"They say he is a good kind of\r\nman, which is saying very little;\" and again, \"You want just now great\r\nmen, to pursue great measures.\" Another time, in advising a war,--a war\r\nof men, not of money,--and speaking of the efforts made by the\r\nneighboring powers against the revolutionists in Flanders, he told his\r\nFrench friends that they must either suffer for or with their allies;\r\nand that the latter was at once the noblest and the safest course.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Washington he drew a picture of the chaos as it really\r\nwas, and at the same time, with wonderful clear-sightedness, showed the\r\ngreat good which the change was eventually to bring to the mass of the\r\npeople. Remembering how bitter Morris's feelings were against the\r\nrevolutionists, it is extraordinary that they did not blind him to the\r\ngood that would in the long run result from their movement. Not another\r\nstatesman would have been able to set forth so clearly and temperately\r\nthe benefits that would finally come from the convulsions he saw around\r\nhim, although he rightly believed that these benefits would be even\r\ngreater could the hideous excesses of the revolutionists be forthwith\r\nstopped and punished.\r\n\r\nHis letter runs: \"This unhappy country, bewildered in the pursuit of\r\nmetaphysical whimsies, presents to our moral view a mighty ruin.... The\r\nsovereign, humbled to the level of a beggar without pity, without\r\nresources, without authority, without a friend. The Assembly, at once a\r\nmaster and a slave, new in power, wild in theory, raw in practice. It\r\nengrosses all functions, though incapable of exercising any, and has\r\ntaken from this fierce, ferocious people every restraint of religion and\r\nof respect.\" Where this would all end, or what sum of misery would be\r\nnecessary to change the popular will and awaken the popular heart, he\r\ncould not say. A glorious opportunity had been lost, and for the time\r\nbeing the Revolution had failed. Yet, he went on to say, in the\r\nconsequences flowing from it he was confident he could see the\r\nfoundation of future prosperity. For among these consequences were,--1.\r\nThe abolition of the different rights and privileges which had formerly\r\nkept the various provinces asunder; 2. The abolition of feudal tyranny,\r\nby which the tenure of real property would be simplified, and the rent\r\nno longer be dependent upon idle vanity, capricious taste, or sullen\r\npride; 3. The throwing into the circle of industry those vast\r\npossessions formerly held by the clergy in mortmain, wealth conferred\r\nupon them as wages for their idleness; 4. The destruction of the system\r\nof venal jurisprudence which had established the pride and privileges of\r\nthe few on the misery and degradation of the general mass; 5. Above all,\r\nthe establishment of the principles of true liberty, which would remain\r\nas solid facts after the superstructure of metaphysical froth and vapor\r\nshould have been blown away. Finally, \"from the chaos of opinion and the\r\nconflict of its jarring elements a new order will at length arise,\r\nwhich, though in some degree the child of chance, may not be less\r\nproductive of human happiness than the forethought provisions of human\r\nspeculation.\" Not one other contemporary statesman could have begun to\r\ngive so just an estimate of the good the Revolution would accomplish; no\r\nother could have seen so deeply into its ultimate results, while also\r\nkeenly conscious of the dreadful evil through which these results were\r\nbeing worked out.\r\n\r\nThe social life of Paris still went on, though with ever less of gayety,\r\nas the gloom gathered round about. Going with Madame de Chastellux to\r\ndine with the Duchess of Orleans, Morris was told by her royal highness\r\nthat she was \"ruined,\" that is, that her income was reduced from four\r\nhundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand livres a year, so\r\nthat she could no longer give him good dinners; but if he would come and\r\nfast with her, she would be glad to see him. The poor lady was yet to\r\nlearn by bitter experience that real ruin was something very different\r\nfrom the loss of half of an enormous income.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he breakfasted with the duchess, and was introduced\r\nto her father, with whom he agreed to dine. After breakfast she went out\r\nwalking with him till nearly dinner-time, and gave him the full history\r\nof her breach with her husband, Egalite, showing the letters that had\r\npassed between them, complaining of his numerous misdeeds, and assuring\r\nMorris that what the world had attributed to fondness for her worthless\r\nspouse was merely discretion; that she had hoped to bring him to a\r\ndecent and orderly behavior, but had finally made up her mind that he\r\ncould only be governed by fear.\r\n\r\nNow and then he indulges in a quiet laugh at the absurd pretensions and\r\nexaggerated estimates of each other still affected by some of the\r\nfrequenters of the various salons. \"Dine with Madame de Stael. The Abbe\r\nSieyes is here, and descants with much self-sufficiency on government,\r\ndespising all that has been said or sung on that subject before him; and\r\nmadame says that his writings and opinions will form in politics a new\r\nera, like those of Newton in physics.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dining with Marmontel, he notes in his Diary that his host \"thinks\r\nsoundly,\"--rare praise for him to bestow on any of the French statesmen\r\nof the time. He records a _bon mot_ of Talleyrand's. When the Assembly\r\nhad declared war on the emperor conditionally upon the latter's failing\r\nto beg pardon before a certain date, the little bishop remarked that\r\n\"the nation was _une parvenue_, and of course insolent.\" At the British\r\nambassador's he met the famous Colonel Tarleton, who did not know his\r\nnationality, and amused him greatly by descanting at length on the\r\nAmerican war.\r\n\r\nHe was very fond of the theatre, especially of the Comedie Francaise,\r\nwhere Preville, whom he greatly admired, was acting in Moliere's\r\n\"Amphitryon.\" Many of the plays, whose plots presented in any way\r\nanalogies to what was actually happening in the political world, raised\r\ngreat excitement among the spectators. Going to see \"Brutus\" acted, he\r\nrecords that the noise and altercations were tremendous, but that\r\nfinally the democrats in the parterre got the upper hand by sheer lusty\r\nroaring, which they kept up for a quarter of an hour at a time, and, at\r\nthe conclusion of the piece, insisted upon the bust of Voltaire being\r\ncrowned and placed on the stage. Soon afterwards a tragedy called\r\n\"Charles Neuf,\" founded on the massacre of St. Bartholomew, was put on\r\nthe stage, to help the Assembly in their crusade against the clergy; he\r\ndeemed it a very extraordinary piece to be represented in a Catholic\r\ncountry, and thought that it would give a fatal blow to the Catholic\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe priesthood, high and low, he disliked more than any other set of\r\nmen; all his comments on them show his contempt. The high prelates he\r\nespecially objected to. The Bishop of Orleans he considered to be a\r\nluxurious old gentleman, \"of the kind whose sincerest prayer is for the\r\nfruit of good living, one who evidently thought it more important to\r\n_speak_ than to speak the _truth_.\" The leader of the great church\r\ndignitaries, in their fight for their rich benefices, was the Abbe\r\nMaury, who, Morris writes, \"is a man who looks like a downright\r\necclesiastical scoundrel.\" He met him in Madame de Nadaillac's salon,\r\nwhere were \"a party of fierce aristocrats. They have the word 'valet'\r\nwritten on their foreheads in large characters. Maury is formed to\r\ngovern such men, and they are formed to obey him or any one else. But\r\nMaury seems to have too much vanity for a great man.\" To tell the bare\r\ntruth is sometimes to make the most venomous comment possible, and this\r\nhe evidently felt when he wrote of his meeting with the Cardinal de\r\nRohan: \"We talk among other things about religion, for the cardinal is\r\nvery devout. He was once the lover of Madame de Flahaut's sister.\"\r\n\r\nBut as the tremendous changes went on about him, Morris had continually\r\nless and less time to spend in mere social pleasures; graver and\r\nweightier matters called for his attention, and his Diary deals with the\r\nshifts and stratagems of the French politicians, and pays little heed to\r\nthe sayings and manners of nobles, bishops, and ladies of rank.\r\n\r\nThe talented, self-confident, fearless American, admittedly out of\r\nsympathy with what he called \"this abominable populace,\" was now well\r\nknown; and in their terrible tangle of dangers and perplexities, court\r\nand ministry alike turned to him for help. Perhaps there has hardly been\r\nanother instance where, in such a crisis, the rulers have clutched in\r\ntheir despair at the advice of a mere private stranger sojourning in the\r\nland on his own business. The king and his ministers, as well as the\r\nqueen, kept in constant communication with him. With Montmorin he dined\r\ncontinually, and was consulted at every stage. But he could not prevail\r\non them to adopt the bold, vigorous measures he deemed necessary; his\r\nplain speaking startled them, and they feared it would not suit the\r\ntemper of the people. He drafted numerous papers for them, among others\r\na royal speech, which the king liked, but which his ministers prevented\r\nhim from using. In fact, it had grown to be hopeless to try to help the\r\ncourt; for the latter pursued each course by fits and starts, now\r\ngoverned by advice from Coblentz, now by advice from Brussels, and then\r\nfor a brief spasm going its own gait. All the while the people at large\r\nknew their own minds no better than poor Louis knew his, and cheered him\r\nwith fervent ecstasy one day, only to howl at him with malignant fury\r\nthe next. With such a monarch and such subjects it is not probable that\r\nany plan would have worked well; but Morris's was the ablest as well as\r\nthe boldest and best defined of the many that were offered to the\r\nwretched, halting king; and had his proposed policy been pursued, things\r\nmight have come out better, and they could not possibly have come out\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nAll through these engrossing affairs, he kept up the liveliest interest\r\nin what was going on in his own country, writing home shrewd\r\nobservations on every step taken. One of his remarks deserves to be kept\r\nin mind. In speaking of the desire of European nations to legislate\r\nagainst the introduction of our produce, he says that this effort has\r\nafter all its bright side; because it will force us \"to make great and\r\nrapid progress in useful manufactures. This alone is wanting to complete\r\nour independence. We shall then be, as it were, a world by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMINISTER TO FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1792, Morris received his credentials as minister to\r\nFrance. There had been determined opposition in the Senate to the\r\nconfirmation of his appointment, which was finally carried only by a\r\nvote of sixteen to eleven, mainly through the exertions of Rufus King.\r\nHis opponents urged the failure of the British negotiations, the\r\nevidences repeatedly given of his proud, impatient spirit, and above all\r\nhis hostility to the French Revolution, as reasons why he should not be\r\nmade minister. Washington, however, as well as Hamilton, King, and the\r\nother federalists, shared most of Morris's views with regard to the\r\nRevolution, and insisted upon his appointment.\r\n\r\nBut the president, as good and wise a friend as Morris had, thought it\r\nbest to send him a word of warning, coupling with the statement of his\r\nown unfaltering trust and regard, the reasons why the new diplomat\r\nshould observe more circumspection than his enemies thought him capable\r\nof showing. For his opponents asserted that his brilliant, lively\r\nimagination always inclined him to act so promptly as to leave no time\r\nfor cool judgment, and was, wrote Washington, \"the primary cause of\r\nthose sallies which too often offend, and of that ridicule of character\r\nwhich begets enmity not easy to be forgotten, but which might easily be\r\navoided if it were under the control of caution and prudence.... By\r\nreciting [their objections] I give you a proof of my friendship, if I\r\ngive none of my policy.\"\r\n\r\nMorris took his friend's advice in good part, and profited by it as far\r\nas lay in his nature. He knew that he had a task of stupendous\r\ndifficulty before him; as it would be almost impossible for a minister\r\nto steer clear of the quarrels springing from the ferocious hatred born\r\nto each other by the royalists and the various republican factions. To\r\nstand well with all parties he knew was impossible: but he thought it\r\npossible, and merely so, to stand _well_ with the best people in each,\r\nwithout greatly offending the others; and in order to do this, he had to\r\nmake up his mind to mingle with the worst as well as the best, to listen\r\nunmoved to falsehoods so foul and calumnies so senseless as to seem the\r\nravings of insanity; and meanwhile to wear a front so firm and yet so\r\ncourteous as to ward off insult from his country and injury from\r\nhimself during the days when the whole people went crazy with the\r\nblood-lust, when his friends were butchered by scores around him, and\r\nwhen the rulers had fulfiled Mirabeau's terrible prophecy, and had\r\n\"paved the streets with their bodies.\"\r\n\r\nBut when he began his duties, he was already entangled in a most\r\ndangerous intrigue, one of whose very existence he should not, as a\r\nforeign minister, have known, still less have entered into. He got\r\nenmeshed in it while still a private citizen, and could not honorably\r\nwithdraw, for it dealt with nothing less than the escape of the king and\r\nqueen from Paris. His chivalrous sympathy for the two hemmed-in, hunted\r\ncreatures, threatened by madmen and counseled by fools, joined with his\r\ncharacteristic impulsiveness and fearlessness, to incline him to make an\r\neffort to save them from their impending doom. A number of plans had\r\nbeen made to get the king out of Paris; and as the managers of each were\r\nof necessity ignorant of all the rest, they clashed with and thwarted\r\none another. Morris's scheme was made in concert with a M. de Monciel,\r\none of the royal ministers, and some other French gentlemen; and their\r\nmeasures were so well taken that they would doubtless have succeeded had\r\nnot the king's nerve invariably failed him at the critical moment, and\r\nbrought delay after delay. The Swiss guards, faithful to their salt,\r\nwere always ready to cover his flight, and Lafayette would have helped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLouis preferred Morris's plan to any of the others offered, and gave a\r\nmost striking proof of his preference by sending to the latter, towards\r\nthe end of July, to say how much he regretted that his advice had not\r\nbeen followed, and to ask him if he would not take charge of the royal\r\npapers and money. Morris was unwilling to take the papers, but finally\r\nconsented to receive the money, amounting in all to nearly seven hundred\r\nand fifty thousand livres, which was to be paid out in hiring and\r\nbribing the men who stood in the way of the escape; for most of the\r\nrevolutionists were as venal as they were bloodthirsty. Still the king\r\nlingered; then came the 10th of August; the Swiss guards were\r\nslaughtered, and the whole scheme was at an end. Some of the men engaged\r\nin the plot were suspected; one, D'Angremont, was seized and condemned,\r\nbut he went to his death without betraying his fellows. The others, by\r\nthe liberal use of the money in Morris's possession, were saved, the\r\nauthorities being bribed to wink at their escape or concealment. Out of\r\nthe money that was left advances were made to Monciel and others;\r\nfinally, in 1796, Morris gave an accurate account of the expenditures\r\nto the dead king's daughter, the Duchesse d'Angouleme, then at the\r\nAustrian court, and turned over to her the remainder, consisting of a\r\nhundred and forty-seven pounds.\r\n\r\nOf course all this was work in which no minister had the least right to\r\nshare; but the whole crisis was one so completely without precedent that\r\nit is impossible to blame Morris for what he did. The extraordinary\r\ntrust reposed in him, and the feeling that his own exertions were all\r\nthat lay between the two unfortunate sovereigns and their fate, roused\r\nhis gallantry and blinded him to the risk he himself ran, as well as to\r\nthe hazard to which he put his country's interests. He was under no\r\nillusion as to the character of the people whom he was trying to serve.\r\nHe utterly disapproved the queen's conduct, and he despised the king,\r\nnoting the latter's feebleness and embarrassment, even on the occasion\r\nof his presentation at court; he saw in them \"a lack of mettle which\r\nwould ever prevent them from being truly royal\"; but when in their\r\nmortal agony they held out their hands to him for aid, his generous\r\nnature forbade him to refuse it, nor could he look on unmoved as they\r\nwent helplessly down to destruction.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his two years' history as minister forms one of the most\r\nbrilliant chapters in our diplomatic annals. His boldness, and the\r\nfrankness with which he expressed his opinions, though they at times\r\nirritated beyond measure the factions of the revolutionists who\r\nsuccessively grasped a brief but tremendous power, yet awed them, in\r\nspite of themselves. He soon learned to combine courage and caution, and\r\nhis readiness, wit, and dash always gave him a certain hold over the\r\nfiery nation to which he was accredited. He was firm and dignified in\r\ninsisting on proper respect being shown our flag, while he did all he\r\ncould to hasten the payment of our obligations to France. A very large\r\nshare of his time, also, was taken up with protesting against the French\r\ndecrees aimed at neutral--which meant American--commerce, and with\r\ninterfering to save American ship-masters, who had got into trouble by\r\nunwittingly violating them. Like his successor, Mr. Washburne, in the\r\ntime of the commune, Morris was the only foreign minister who remained\r\nin Paris during the terror. He stayed at the risk of his life; and yet,\r\nwhile fully aware of his danger, he carried himself as coolly as if in a\r\ntime of profound peace, and never flinched for a moment when he was\r\nobliged for his country's sake to call to account the rulers of France\r\nfor the time being--men whose power was as absolute as it was ephemeral\r\nand bloody, who had indulged their desire for slaughter with the\r\nunchecked ferocity of madmen, and who could by a word have had him slain\r\nas thousands had been slain before him. Few foreign ministers have faced\r\nsuch difficulties, and not one has ever come near to facing such dangers\r\nas Morris did during his two years' term of service. His feat stands by\r\nitself in diplomatic history; and, as a minor incident, the letters and\r\ndespatches he sent home give a very striking view of the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was appointed he went to see the French minister of\r\nforeign affairs; and in answer to an observation of the latter stated\r\nwith his customary straightforwardness that it was true that, while a\r\nmere private individual, sincerely friendly to France, and desirous of\r\nhelping her, and whose own nation could not be compromised by his acts,\r\nhe had freely taken part in passing events, had criticised the\r\nconstitution, and advised the king and his ministers; but he added that,\r\nnow that he was a public man, he would no longer meddle with their\r\naffairs. To this resolution he kept, save that, as already described,\r\nsheer humanity induced him to make an effort to save the king's life. He\r\nhad predicted what would ensue as the result of the exaggerated\r\ndecentralization into which the opponents of absolutism had rushed;\r\nwhen they had split the state up into more than forty thousand\r\nsovereignties, each district the sole executor of the law, and the only\r\njudge of its propriety, and therefore obedient to it only so long as it\r\nlisted, and until rendered hostile by the ignorant whim or ferocious\r\nimpulse of the moment; and now he was to see his predictions come true.\r\nIn that brilliant and able state paper, the address he had drawn up for\r\nLouis to deliver when, in 1791, the latter accepted the constitution,\r\nthe key-note of the situation was struck in the opening words: \"It is no\r\nlonger a king who addresses you, Louis XVI. is a private individual\";\r\nand he had then scored off, point by point, the faults in a document\r\nthat created an unwieldy assembly of men unaccustomed to govern, that\r\ndestroyed the principle of authority, though no other could appeal to a\r\npeople helpless in their new-born liberty, and that created out of one\r\nwhole a jarring multitude of fractional sovereignties. Now he was to see\r\none of these same sovereignties rise up in successful rebellion against\r\nthe government that represented the whole, destroy it and usurp its\r\npower, and establish over all France the rule of an anarchic despotism\r\nwhich, by what seems to a free American a gross misnomer, they called a\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nAll through June, at the beginning of which month Morris had been\r\nformally presented at court, the excitement and tumult kept increasing.\r\nWhen, on the 20th, the mob forced the gates of the chateau, and made the\r\nking put on the red cap, Morris wrote in his Diary that the constitution\r\nhad given its last groan. A few days afterwards he told Lafayette that\r\nin six weeks everything would be over, and tried to persuade him that\r\nhis only chance was to make up his mind instantly to fight either for a\r\ngood constitution or for the wretched piece of paper which bore the\r\nname. Just six weeks to a day from the date of this prediction came the\r\n10th of August to verify it.\r\n\r\nThroughout July the fevered pulses of the people beat with always\r\ngreater heat. Looking at the maddened mob the American minister thanked\r\nGod from his heart that in his own country there was no such populace,\r\nand prayed with unwonted earnestness that our education and morality\r\nshould forever stave off such an evil. At court even the most purblind\r\ndimly saw their doom. Calling there one morning he chronicles with a\r\nmatter of fact brevity, impressive from its very baldness, that nothing\r\nof note had occurred except that they had stayed up all night expecting\r\nto be murdered. He wrote home that he could not tell \"whether the king\r\nwould live through the storm; for it blew hard.\"\r\n\r\nHis horror of the base mob, composed of people whose kind was absolutely\r\nunknown in America, increased continually, as he saw them going on from\r\ncrimes that were great to crimes that were greater, incited by the\r\ndemagogues who flattered them and roused their passions and appetites;\r\nand blindly raging because they were of necessity disappointed in the\r\ngolden prospects held out to them. He scorned the folly of the\r\nenthusiasts and doctrinaires who had made a constitution all sail and no\r\nballast, that overset at the first gust; who had freed from all\r\nrestraint a mass of men as savage and licentious as they were wayward;\r\nwho had put the executive in the power of the legislature, and this\r\nlatter at the mercy of the leaders who could most strongly influence and\r\ninflame the mob. But his contempt for the victims almost exceeded his\r\nanger at their assailants. The king, who could suffer with firmness, and\r\nwho could act either not at all, or else with the worst possible effect,\r\nhad the head and heart that might have suited the monkish idea of a\r\nfemale saint, but which were hopelessly out of place in any rational\r\nbeing supposed to be fitted for doing good in the world. Morris wrote\r\nhome that he knew his friend Hamilton had no particular aversion to\r\nkings, and would not believe them to be tigers; but that if Hamilton\r\ncame to Europe to see for himself, he would surely believe them to be\r\nmonkeys; the Empress of Russia was the only reigning sovereign whose\r\ntalents were not \"considerably below par.\" At the moment of the final\r\nshock the court was involved in a set of paltry intrigues \"unworthy of\r\nanything above the rank of a footman or a chambermaid. Every one had his\r\nor her little project, and every little project had some abettors.\r\nStrong, manly counsels frightened the weak, alarmed the envious, and\r\nwounded the enervated minds of the lazy and luxurious.\" The few such\r\ncounsels that appeared were always approved, rarely adopted, and never\r\nfollowed out.\r\n\r\nThen in the sweltering heat of August, the end came. A raving, furious\r\nhorde stormed the chateau, and murdered, one by one, the brave\r\nmountaineers who gave their lives for a sovereign too weak to be worthy\r\nof such gallant bloodshed. King and queen fled to the National Assembly,\r\nand the monarchy was over. Immediately after the awful catastrophe\r\nMorris wrote to a friend: \"The voracity of the court, the haughtiness of\r\nthe nobles, the sensuality of the church, have met their punishment in\r\nthe road of their transgressions. The oppressor has been squeezed by\r\nthe hands of the oppressed; but there remains yet to be acted an awful\r\nscene in this great tragedy, played on the theatre of the universe for\r\nthe instruction of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nNot the less did he dare everything, and jeopardize his own life in\r\ntrying to save some at least among the innocent who had been overthrown\r\nin the crash of the common ruin. When on the 10th of August the whole\r\ncity lay abject at the mercy of the mob, hunted men and women, bereft of\r\nall they had, and fleeing from a terrible death, with no hiding-place,\r\nno friend who could shield them, turned in their terror-struck despair\r\nto the one man in whose fearlessness and generous gallantry they could\r\ntrust. The shelter of Morris's house and flag was sought from early\r\nmorning till past midnight by people who had nowhere else to go and who\r\nfelt that within his walls they were sure of at least a brief safety\r\nfrom the maddened savages in the streets. As far as possible they were\r\nsent off to places of greater security; but some had to stay with him\r\ntill the storm lulled for a moment. An American gentleman who was in\r\nParis on that memorable day, after viewing the sack of the Tuileries,\r\nthought it right to go to the house of the American minister. He found\r\nhim surrounded by a score of people, of both sexes, among them the old\r\nCount d'Estaing, and other men of note, who had fought side by side with\r\nus in our war for independence, and whom now our flag protected in their\r\nhour of direst need. Silence reigned, only broken occasionally by the\r\nweeping of the women and children. As his visitor was leaving, Morris\r\ntook him to one side, and told him that he had no doubt there were\r\npersons on the watch who would find fault with his conduct as a minister\r\nin receiving and protecting these people; that they had come of their\r\nown accord, uninvited. \"Whether my house will be a protection to them or\r\nto me, God only knows; but I will not turn them out of it, let what will\r\nhappen to me; you see, sir, they are all persons to whom our country is\r\nmore or less indebted, and had they no such claim upon me, it would be\r\ninhuman to force them into the hands of the assassins.\" No one of\r\nMorris's countrymen can read his words even now without feeling a throb\r\nof pride in the dead statesman, who, a century ago, held up so high the\r\nhonor of his nation's name in the times when the souls of all but the\r\nvery bravest were tried and found wanting.\r\n\r\nSoon after this he ceased writing in his Diary, for fear it might fall\r\ninto the hands of men who would use it to incriminate his friends; and\r\nfor the same reason he had also to be rather wary in what he wrote\r\nhome, as his letters frequently bore marks of being opened, thanks to\r\nwhat he laughingly called \"patriotic curiosity.\" He was, however,\r\nperfectly fearless as regards any ill that might befall himself; his\r\ncircumspection was only exercised on behalf of others, and his own\r\nopinions were given as frankly as ever.\r\n\r\nHe pictured the French as huddled together, in an unreasoning panic,\r\nlike cattle before a thunderstorm. Their every act increased his\r\ndistrust of their capacity for self-government. They were for the time\r\nagog with their republic, and ready to adopt any form of government with\r\na huzza; but that they would adopt a good form, or, having adopted it,\r\nkeep it, he did not believe; and he saw that the great mass of the\r\npopulation were already veering round, under the pressure of\r\naccumulating horrors, until they would soon be ready to welcome as a\r\nblessing even a despotism, if so they could gain security to life and\r\nproperty. They had made the common mistake of believing that to enjoy\r\nliberty they had only to abolish authority; and the equally common\r\nconsequence was, that they were now, through anarchy, on the high road\r\nto absolutism. Said Morris: \"Since I have been in this country I have\r\nseen the worship of many idols, and but little of the true God. I have\r\nseen many of these idols broken, and some of them beaten to the dust. I\r\nhave seen the late constitution in one short year admired as a\r\nstupendous monument of human wisdom, and ridiculed as an egregious\r\nproduction of folly and vice. I wish much, very much, the happiness of\r\nthis inconstant people. I love them, I feel grateful for their efforts\r\nin our cause, and I consider the establishment of a good constitution\r\nhere as the principal means, under Divine Providence, of extending the\r\nblessings of freedom to the many millions of my fellow-men who groan in\r\nbondage on the continent of Europe. But I do not greatly indulge the\r\nflattering illusions of hope, because I do not yet perceive that\r\nreformation of morals without which liberty is but an empty sound.\"\r\nThese words are such as could only come from a genuine friend of France,\r\nand champion of freedom; from a strong, earnest man, saddened by the\r\nfollies of dreamers, and roused to stern anger by the licentious\r\nwickedness of scoundrels who used the name of liberty to cloak the worst\r\nabuses of its substance.\r\n\r\nHis stay in Paris was now melancholy indeed. The city was shrouded in a\r\ngloom only relieved by the frenzied tumults that grew steadily more\r\nnumerous. The ferocious craving once roused could not be sated; the\r\nthirst grew ever stronger as the draughts were deeper. The danger to\r\nMorris's own person merely quickened his pulses, and roused his strong,\r\nbrave nature; he liked excitement, and the strain that would have been\r\ntoo tense for weaker nerves keyed his own up to a fierce, half-exultant\r\nthrilling. But the woes that befell those who had befriended him caused\r\nhim the keenest grief. It was almost unbearable to be seated quietly at\r\ndinner, and hear by accident \"that a friend was on his way to the place\r\nof execution,\" and to have to sit still and wonder which of the guests\r\ndining with him would be the next to go to the scaffold. The vilest\r\ncriminals swarmed in the streets, and amused themselves by tearing the\r\nearrings from women's ears, and snatching away their watches. When the\r\npriests shut up in the _carnes_, and the prisoners in the _abbaie_ were\r\nmurdered, the slaughter went on all day, and eight hundred men were\r\nengaged in it.\r\n\r\nHe wrote home that, to give a true picture of France, he would have to\r\npaint it like an Indian warrior, black and red. The scenes that passed\r\nwere literally beyond the imagination of the American mind. The most\r\nhideous and nameless atrocities were so common as to be only alluded to\r\nincidentally, and to be recited in the most matter-of-fact way in\r\nconnection with other events. For instance, a man applied to the\r\nConvention for a recompense for damage done to his quarry, a pit dug\r\ndeep through the surface of the earth into the stone bed beneath: the\r\ndamage consisted in such a number of dead bodies having been thrown into\r\nthe pit as to choke it up so that he could no longer get men to work it.\r\nHundreds, who had been the first in the land, were thus destroyed\r\nwithout form or trial, and their bodies thrown like dead dogs into the\r\nfirst hole that offered. Two hundred priests were killed for no other\r\ncrime than having been conscientiously scrupulous about taking the\r\nprescribed oath. The guillotine went smartly on, watched with a devilish\r\nmerriment by the fiends who were themselves to perish by the instrument\r\ntheir own hands had wrought. \"Heaven only knew who was next to drink of\r\nthe dreadful cup; as far as man could tell, there was to be no lack of\r\nliquor for some time to come.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the new men who, one after another, sprang into the light, to\r\nmaintain their unsteady footing as leaders for but a brief time before\r\ntoppling into the dark abyss of death or oblivion that waited for each\r\nand all, Dumouriez was for the moment the most prominent. He stood\r\ntowards the Gironde much as Lafayette had stood towards the\r\nConstitutionalists of 1789: he led the army, as Lafayette once had led\r\nit; and as the constitutional monarchists had fallen before his\r\nfellow-republicans, so both he and they were to go down before the even\r\nwilder extremists of the \"Mountain.\" For the factions in Paris, face to\r\nface with the banded might of the European monarchies, and grappling in\r\na grim death-struggle with the counter-revolutionists of the provinces,\r\nyet fought one another with the same ferocity they showed towards the\r\ncommon foe. Nevertheless, success was theirs; for against opponents only\r\nless wicked than themselves they moved with an infinitely superior fire\r\nand enthusiasm. Reeking with the blood of the guiltless, steeped in it\r\nto the lips, branded with fresh memories of crimes and infamies without\r\nnumber, and yet feeling in their very marrow that they were avenging\r\ncenturies of grinding and intolerable thralldom, and that the cause for\r\nwhich they fought was just and righteous; with shameless cruelty and\r\ncorruption eating into their hearts' core, yet with their foreheads\r\nkindled by the light of a glorious morning,--they moved with a ruthless\r\nenergy that paralyzed their opponents, the worn-out, tottering, crazy\r\ndespotisms, rotten with vice, despicable in their ludicrous pride of\r\ncaste, moribund in their military pedantry, and fore-doomed to perish\r\nin the conflict they had courted. The days of Danton and Robespierre are\r\nnot days to which a French patriot cares to look back; but at any rate\r\nhe can regard them without the shame he must feel when he thinks of the\r\ntimes of Louis Quinze. Danton and his like, at least, were men, and\r\nstood far, far above the palsied coward--a eunuch in his lack of all\r\nvirile virtues--who misruled France for half a century; who, with his\r\nfollowers, indulged in every crime and selfish vice known, save only\r\nsuch as needed a particle of strength, or the least courage, in the\r\ncommitting.\r\n\r\nMorris first met Dumouriez when the latter was minister of foreign\r\naffairs, shortly before the poor king was driven from the Tuileries. He\r\ndined with him, and afterwards noted down that the society was noisy and\r\nin bad style; for the grace and charm of French social life were gone,\r\nand the raw republicans were ill at ease in the drawing-room. At this\r\ntime Morris commented often on the change in the look of Paris: all his\r\ngay friends gone; the city sombre and uneasy. When he walked through the\r\nstreets, in the stifling air of a summer hot beyond precedent, as if the\r\nelements sympathized with the passions of men, he met, instead of the\r\nbrilliant company of former days, only the few peaceable citizens left,\r\nhurrying on their ways with frightened watchfulness; or else groups of\r\nlolling ruffians, with sinister eyes and brutalized faces; or he saw in\r\nthe Champs de Mars squalid ragamuffins signing the petition for the\r\n_decheance_.\r\n\r\nMorris wrote Washington that Dumouriez was a bold, determined man,\r\nbitterly hostile to the Jacobins and all the extreme revolutionary\r\nclubs, and, once he was in power, willing to risk his own life in the\r\neffort to put them down. However, the hour of the Jacobins had not yet\r\nstruck, and the Revolution had now been permitted to gather such headway\r\nthat it could be stopped only by a master genius; and Dumouriez was none\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nStill he was an able man, and, as Morris wrote home, in his military\r\noperations he combined the bravery of a skilled soldier and the arts of\r\nan astute politician. To be sure, his victories were not in themselves\r\nvery noteworthy; the artillery skirmish at Valmy was decided by the\r\nreluctance of the Germans to come on, not by the ability of the French\r\nto withstand them; and at Jemappes the imperialists were hopelessly\r\noutnumbered. Still the results were most important, and Dumouriez\r\noverran Flanders in the face of hostile Europe. He at once proceeded to\r\nrevolutionize the government of his conquest in the most approved\r\nFrench fashion, which was that all the neighbors of France should\r\nreceive liberty whether or no, and should moreover pay the expense of\r\nhaving it thrust upon them: accordingly he issued a proclamation to his\r\nnew fellow-citizens, \"which might be summed up in a few words as being\r\nan order to them to be free forthwith, according to his ideas of\r\nfreedom, on pain of military execution.\"\r\n\r\nHe had things all his own way for the moment, but after a while he was\r\ndefeated by the Germans; then while the Gironde tottered to its fall, he\r\nfled to the very foes he had been fighting, as the only way of escaping\r\ndeath from the men whose favorite he had been. Morris laughed bitterly\r\nat the fickle people. One anecdote he gives is worth preserving: \"It is\r\na year ago that a person who mixed in tumults to see what was doing,\r\ntold me of a _sans culottes_ who, bellowing against poor Lafayette, when\r\nPetion appeared, changed at once his note to '_Vive Petion!_' and then,\r\nturning round to one of his companions, 'Vois tu! C'est notre ami, n'est\r\nce pas? Eh bien, il passera comme les autres.' And, lo! the prophecy is\r\nfulfilled; and I this instant learn that Petion, confined to his room as\r\na traitor or conspirator, has fled, on the 24th of June, 1793, from\r\nthose whom he sent, on the 20th of June, 1792, to assault the king in\r\nthe Tuileries. In short you will find, in the list of those who were\r\nordered by their brethren to be arrested, the names of those who have\r\nproclaimed themselves to be the prime movers of the revolution of the\r\n10th of August, and the fathers of the republic.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the time the _sans culottes_ had thus bellowed against Lafayette,\r\nthe latter met Morris, for the first time since he was presented at\r\ncourt as minister, and at once spoke to him in his tone of ancient\r\nfamiliarity. The Frenchman had been brought at last to realize the truth\r\nof his American friend's theories and predictions. It was much too late\r\nto save himself, however. After the 10th of August he was proclaimed by\r\nthe Assembly, found his troops falling away from him, and fled over the\r\nfrontier; only to be thrown into prison by the allied monarchs, who\r\nacted with their usual folly and baseness. Morris, contemptuously\r\nimpatient of the part he had played, wrote of him: \"Thus his circle is\r\ncompleted. He has spent his fortune on a revolution, and is now crushed\r\nby the wheel which he put in motion. He lasted longer than I expected.\"\r\nBut this momentary indignation soon gave way to a generous sympathy for\r\nthe man who had served America so well, and who, if without the great\r\nabilities necessary to grapple with the tumult of French affairs, had\r\nyet always acted with such unselfish purity of motive. Lafayette, as\r\nsoon as he was imprisoned, wrote to the American minister in Holland,\r\nalleging that he had surrendered his position as a French subject, and\r\nwas now an American citizen, and requesting the American representatives\r\nin Europe to procure his release. His claim was of course untenable;\r\nand, though the American government did all it could on his behalf\r\nthrough its foreign ministers, and though Washington himself wrote a\r\nstrong letter of appeal to the Austrian emperor, he remained in prison\r\nuntil the peace, several years later.\r\n\r\nAll Lafayette's fortune was gone, and while in prison he was reduced to\r\nwant. As soon as Morris heard this, he had the sum of ten thousand\r\nflorins forwarded to the prisoner by the United States bankers at\r\nAmsterdam; pledging his own security for the amount, which was, however,\r\nfinally allowed by the government under the name of compensation for\r\nLafayette's military services in America. Morris was even more active in\r\nbefriending Madame de Lafayette and her children. To the former he lent\r\nfrom his own private funds a hundred thousand livres, enabling her to\r\npay her debts to the many poor people who had rendered services to her\r\nfamily. To the proud, sensitive lady the relief was great, much though\r\nit hurt her to be under any obligation: she wrote to her friend that he\r\nhad broken the chains that loaded her down, and had done it in a way\r\nthat made her feel the consolation, rather than the weight, of the\r\nobligation. But he was to do still more for her; for, when she was cast\r\ninto prison by the savage Parisian mob, his active influence on her\r\nbehalf saved her from death. In a letter to him, written some time\r\nlater, she says, after speaking of the money she had borrowed: \"This is\r\na slight obligation, it is true, compared with that of my life, but\r\nallow me to remember both while life lasts, with a sentiment of\r\ngratitude which it is precious to feel.\"\r\n\r\nThere were others whose fortunes turned with the wheel of fate, for whom\r\nMorris felt no such sympathy as for the Lafayettes. Among the number was\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, now transformed into _citoyen Egalite_. Morris\r\ncredited this graceless debauchee with criminal ambitions which he\r\nprobably did not possess, saying that he doubted the public virtue of a\r\nprofligate, and could not help distrusting such a man's pretensions; nor\r\nis it likely that he regretted much the fate of the man who died under\r\nthe same guillotine which, with his assent, had fallen on the neck of\r\nthe king, his cousin.\r\n\r\nIt needed no small amount of hardihood for a man of Morris's prominence\r\nand avowed sentiments to stay in Paris when Death was mowing round him\r\nwith a swath at once so broad and so irregular. The power was passing\r\nrapidly from hand to hand, through a succession of men fairly crazy in\r\ntheir indifference to bloodshed. Not a single other minister of a\r\nneutral nation dared stay. In fact, the foreign representatives were\r\npreparing to go away even before the final stroke was given to the\r\nmonarchy, and soon after the 10th of August the entire _corps\r\ndiplomatique_ left Paris as rapidly as the various members could get\r\ntheir passports. These the new republican government was at first very\r\nreluctant to grant; indeed, when the Venetian ambassador started off he\r\nwas very ignominiously treated and brought back. Morris went to the\r\nBritish ambassador's to take leave, having received much kindness from\r\nhim, and having been very intimate in his house. He found Lord Gower in\r\na tearing passion because he could not get passports; he had burned his\r\npapers, and strongly advised his guest to do likewise. On this advice\r\nthe latter refused to act, nor would he take the broad hints given him\r\nto the effect that honor required him to quit the country. Morris could\r\nnot help showing his amusement at the fear and anger exhibited at the\r\nambassador's, \"which exhibition of spirits his lordship could hardly\r\nbear.\" Talleyrand, who was getting his own passport, also did all in his\r\npower to persuade the American minister to leave, but without avail.\r\nMorris was not a man to be easily shaken in any determination he had\r\ntaken after careful thought. He wrote back to Jefferson that his opinion\r\nwas directly opposed to the views of such people as had tried to\r\npersuade him that his own honor, and that of America, required him to\r\nleave France; and that he was inclined to attribute such counsel mainly\r\nto fear. It was true that the position was not without danger; but he\r\npresumed that, when the president named him to the embassy, it was not\r\nfor his own personal pleasure or safety, but for the interests of the\r\ncountry; and these he could certainly serve best by staying.\r\n\r\nHe was able to hold his own only by a mixture of tact and firmness. Any\r\nsigns of flinching would have ruined him outright. He would submit to no\r\ninsolence. The minister of foreign affairs was, with his colleagues,\r\nengaged in certain schemes in reference to the American debt, which were\r\ndesigned to further their own private interests; he tried to bully\r\nMorris into acquiescence, and, on the latter's point-blank refusal, sent\r\nhim a most insulting letter. Morris promptly retorted by demanding his\r\npassports. France, however, was very desirous not to break with the\r\nUnited States, the only friend she had left in the world; and the\r\noffending minister sent a sullen letter of apology, asking him to\r\nreconsider his intention to leave, and offering entire satisfaction for\r\nevery point of which he complained. Accordingly Morris stayed.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, continually exposed to insults and worries, which were\r\nalways apologized for by the government for the time being, on the\r\nground, no doubt true, that in such a period of convulsions it was\r\nimpossible to control their subordinate agents. Indeed, the changes from\r\none form of anarchy to another went on so rapidly that the laws of\r\nnations had small chance of observance.\r\n\r\nOne evening a number of people, headed by a commissary of the section,\r\nentered his house, and demanded to search it for arms said to be hidden\r\ntherein. Morris took a high tone, and was very peremptory with them;\r\ntold them that they should not examine his house, that it held no arms,\r\nand moreover that, if he had possessed any, they should not touch one of\r\nthem; he also demanded the name of \"the blockhead or rascal\" who had\r\ninformed against him, announcing his intention to bring him to\r\npunishment. Finally he got them out of the house, and the next morning\r\nthe commissary called with many apologies, which were accepted.\r\n\r\nAnother time he was arrested in the street for not having a _carte de\r\ncitoyen_, but he was released as soon as it was found out who he was.\r\nAgain he was arrested while traveling in the country, on the pretence\r\nthat his passport was out of date; an insult for which the government at\r\nonce made what amends they could. His house was also visited another\r\ntime by armed men, whom, as before, he persuaded to go away. Once or\r\ntwice, in the popular tumults, even his life was in danger; on one\r\noccasion it is said that it was only saved by the fact of his having a\r\nwooden leg, which made him known to the mob as \"a cripple of the\r\nAmerican war for freedom.\" Rumors even got abroad in England and America\r\nthat he had been assassinated.\r\n\r\nMorris's duties were manifold, and as harassing to himself as they were\r\nbeneficial to his country. Sometimes he would interfere on behalf of\r\nAmerica as a whole, and endeavor to get obnoxious decrees of the\r\nAssembly repealed; and again he would try to save some private citizen\r\nof the United States who had got himself into difficulties. Reports of\r\nthe French minister of foreign affairs, as well as reports of the\r\n_comite de salut public_, alike bear testimony to the success of his\r\nendeavors, whenever success was possible, and unconsciously show the\r\nvalue of the services he rendered to his country. Of course it was often\r\nimpossible to obtain complete redress, because, as Morris wrote home,\r\nthe government, while all-powerful in certain cases, was in others not\r\nmerely feeble, but enslaved, and was often obliged to commit acts the\r\nconsequences of which the nominal leaders both saw and lamented. Morris\r\nalso, while doing all he could for his fellow-citizens, was often\r\nobliged to choose between their interests and those of the nation at\r\nlarge; and he of course decided in favor of the latter, though well\r\naware of the clamor that was certain to be raised against him in\r\nconsequence by those who, as he caustically remarked, found it the\r\neasiest thing in the world to get anything they wanted from the French\r\ngovernment _until they had tried_.\r\n\r\nOne of his most important transactions was in reference to paying off\r\nthe debt due by America for amounts loaned her during the war for\r\nindependence. The interest and a part of the principal had already been\r\npaid. At the time when Morris was made minister, the United States had a\r\nlarge sum of money, destined for the payment of the public debt, lying\r\nidle in the hands of the bankers at Amsterdam; and this sum both Morris\r\nand the American minister to Holland, Mr. Short, thought could be well\r\napplied to the payment of part of our remaining obligation to France.\r\nThe French government was consulted, and agreed to receive the sum; but\r\nhardly was the agreement entered into before the monarchy was\r\noverturned. The question at once arose as to whether the money could be\r\nrightfully paid over to the men who had put themselves at the head of\r\naffairs, and who, a month hence, might themselves be ousted by others\r\nwho would not acknowledge the validity of a payment made to them. Short\r\nthought the payment should be stopped, and, as it afterwards turned out,\r\nthe home authorities agreed with him. But Morris thought otherwise, and\r\npaid over the amount. Events fully justified his course, for France\r\nnever made any difficulty in the matter, and even had she done so, as\r\nMorris remarked, America had the staff in her own hands, and could walk\r\nwhich way she pleased, for she owed more money, and in the final\r\nadjustment could insist on the amount paid being allowed on account of\r\nthe debt.\r\n\r\nThe French executive council owed Morris gratitude for his course in\r\nthis matter; but they became intensely irritated with him shortly\r\nafterwards because he refused to fall in with certain proposals they\r\nmade to him as to the manner of applying part of the debt to the\r\npurchase of provisions and munitions for San Domingo. Morris had good\r\nreason to believe that there was a private speculation at the bottom of\r\nthis proposal, and declined to accede to it. The urgency with which it\r\nwas made, and the wrath which his course excited, confirmed his\r\nsuspicions, and he persisted in his refusal although it almost brought\r\nabout a break with the men then carrying on the government. Afterwards,\r\nwhen these men fell with the Gironde, he wrote home: \"I mentioned to you\r\nthe plan of a speculation on drafts to have been made on the United\r\nStates, could my concurrence have been procured. Events have shown that\r\nthis speculation would have been a good one to the parties, who would\r\nhave gained (and the French nation of course have lost) about fifty\r\nthousand pounds sterling in eighty thousand. I was informed at that time\r\nthat the disappointed parties would attempt to have me recalled, and\r\nsome more tractable character sent, who would have the good sense to\r\nlook after his own interest. Well, sir, nine months have elapsed, and\r\nnow, if I were capable of such things, I think it would be no difficult\r\nmatter to have some of them hanged; indeed it is highly probable that\r\nthey will experience a fate of that sort.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of his time was also taken up in remonstrating against the attacks\r\nof French privateers on American shipping. These, however, went steadily\r\non until, half a dozen years afterwards, we took the matter into our own\r\nhands, and in the West Indies inflicted a smart drubbing, not only on\r\nthe privateers of France, but on her regular men-of-war as well. He also\r\ndid what he could for the French officers who had served in America\r\nduring the War of Independence, most of whom were forced to flee from\r\nFrance after the outbreak of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nHis letters home, even after his regular duties had begun to be\r\nengrossing, contained a running commentary on the events that were\r\npassing around him. His forecasts of events within France were\r\nremarkably shrewd, and he displayed a wonderful insight into the motives\r\nand characters of the various leaders; but at first he was all at sea in\r\nhis estimate of the military situation, being much more at home among\r\nstatesmen than soldiers. He had expected the allied sovereigns to make\r\nshort work of the raw republican armies, and was amazed at the success\r\nof the latter. But he very soon realized how the situation stood; that\r\nwhereas the Austrian and Prussian troops simply came on in well-drilled,\r\nreluctant obedience to their commanding officers, the soldiers of\r\nFrance, on the contrary, were actuated by a fiery spirit the like of\r\nwhich had hardly been seen since the crusades. The bitterness of the\r\ncontest was appalling, and so was the way in which the ranks of the\r\ncontestants were thinned out. The extreme republicans believed in their\r\ncreed with a furious faith; and they were joined by their\r\nfellow-citizens with an almost equal zeal, when once it had become\r\nevident that the invaders were hostile not only to the Republic but to\r\nFrance itself, and very possibly meditated its dismemberment.\r\n\r\nWhen the royal and imperial forces invaded France in 1792, they\r\nthreatened such ferocious vengeance as to excite the most desperate\r\nresistance, and yet they backed up their high sounding words by deeds so\r\nfaulty, weak, and slow as to make themselves objects of contempt rather\r\nthan dread. The Duke of Brunswick in particular, as a prelude to some\r\nvery harmless military manoeuvres, issued a singularly lurid and foolish\r\nmanifesto, announcing that he would deliver up Paris to utter\r\ndestruction and would give over all the soldiers he captured to military\r\nexecution. Morris said that his address was in substance, \"Be all\r\nagainst me, for I am opposed to you all, and make a good resistance, for\r\nthere is no longer any hope;\" and added that it would have been wiser\r\nto have begun with some great success and then to have carried the\r\ndanger near those whom it was desired to intimidate. As it was, the\r\nDuke's campaign failed ignominiously, and all the invaders were driven\r\nback, for France rose as one man, her warriors overflowed on every side,\r\nand bore down all her foes by sheer weight of numbers and impetuous\r\nenthusiasm. Her government was a despotism as well as an anarchy; it was\r\nas totally free from the drawbacks as from the advantages of the\r\ndemocratic system that it professed to embody. Nothing could exceed the\r\nmerciless energy of the measures adopted. Half-way wickedness might have\r\nfailed; but a wholesale murder of the disaffected, together with a\r\nconfiscation of all the goods of the rich, and a vigorous conscription\r\nof the poor for soldiers, secured success, at least for the time being.\r\nThe French made it a war of men; so that the price of labor rose\r\nenormously at once, and the condition of the working classes forthwith\r\nchanged greatly for the better--one good result of the Revolution, at\r\nany rate.\r\n\r\nMorris wrote home very soon after the 10th of August that the then\r\ntriumphant revolutionists, the Girondists or party of Brissot, who had\r\nsupplanted the moderate party of Lafayette exactly as the latter had\r\nsucceeded the aristocracy, would soon in their turn be overthrown by men\r\neven more extreme and even more bloodthirsty; and that thus it would go\r\non, wave after wave, until at last the wizard arose who could still\r\nthem. By the end of the year the storm had brewed long enough to be near\r\nthe bursting point. One of the promoters of the last outbreak, now\r\nhimself marked as a victim, told Morris that he personally would die\r\nhard, but that most of his colleagues, though like him doomed to\r\ndestruction, and though so fierce in dealing with the moderate men, now\r\nshowed neither the nerve nor hardihood that alone could stave off the\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the king, as Morris wrote home, showed in his death a better\r\nspirit than his life had promised; for he died in a manner becoming his\r\ndignity, with calm courage, praying that his foes might be forgiven and\r\nhis deluded people be benefited by his death,--his words from the\r\nscaffold being drowned by the drums of Santerre. As a whole, the Gironde\r\nhad opposed putting the king to death, and thus capping the structure\r\nwhose foundations they had laid; they held back all too late. The fabric\r\nof their system was erected on a quagmire, and it now settled down and\r\ncrushed the men who had built it. \"All people of morality and\r\nintelligence had long agreed that as yet republican virtues were not of\r\nGallic growth;\" and so the power slipped naturally into the grasp of the\r\nlowest and most violent, of those who were loudest to claim the\r\npossession of republican principles, while in practice showing that they\r\nhad not even the dimmest idea of what such principles meant.\r\n\r\nThe leaders were quite at the mercy of the gusts of fierce passion that\r\nswayed the breasts of their brutal followers. Morris wrote home that the\r\nnominal rulers, or rather the few by whom these rulers were directed,\r\nhad finally gained very just ideas of the value of popular opinion; but\r\nthat they were not in a condition to act according to their knowledge;\r\nand that if they were able to reach harbor there would be quite as much\r\nof good luck as of good management about it, and, at any rate, a part of\r\nthe crew would have to be thrown overboard.\r\n\r\nThen the Mountain rose under Danton and Marat, and the party of the\r\nGironde was entirely put down. The leaders were cast into prison, with\r\nthe certainty before their eyes that the first great misfortune to\r\nFrance would call them from their dungeons to act as expiatory victims.\r\nThe Jacobins ruled supreme, and under them the government became a\r\ndespotism in principle as well as in practice. Part of the Convention\r\narrested the rest; and the revolutionary tribunals ruled red-handed,\r\nwith a whimsical and ferocious tyranny. Said Morris: \"It is an\r\nemphatical phrase among the patriots that _terror is the order of the\r\nday_; some years have elapsed since Montesquieu wrote that the principle\r\nof arbitrary governments is _fear_.\" The prisons were choked with\r\n_suspects_, and blood flowed more freely than ever. Terror had reached\r\nits highest point. Danton was soon to fall before Robespierre. Among a\r\nhost of other victims the queen died, with a brave dignity that made\r\npeople half forget her manifold faults; and Philippe Egalite, the\r\ndissolute and unprincipled scoundrel, after a life than which none could\r\nbe meaner and more unworthy, now at the end went to his death with calm\r\nand unflinching courage.\r\n\r\nOne man had a very narrow escape. This was Thomas Paine, the Englishman,\r\nwho had at one period rendered such a striking service to the cause of\r\nAmerican independence, while the rest of his life had been as ignoble as\r\nit was varied. He had been elected to the Convention, and, having sided\r\nwith the Gironde, was thrown into prison by the Jacobins. He at once\r\nasked Morris to demand him as an American citizen; a title to which he\r\nof course had no claim. Morris refused to interfere too actively,\r\njudging rightly that Paine would be saved by his own insignificance and\r\nwould serve his own interests best by keeping still. So the filthy\r\nlittle atheist had to stay in prison, \"where he amused himself with\r\npublishing a pamphlet against Jesus Christ.\" There are infidels and\r\ninfidels; Paine belonged to the variety--whereof America possesses at\r\npresent one or two shining examples--that apparently esteems a bladder\r\nof dirty water as the proper weapon with which to assail Christianity.\r\nIt is not a type that appeals to the sympathy of an onlooker, be said\r\nonlooker religious or otherwise.\r\n\r\nMorris never paid so much heed to the military events as to the progress\r\nof opinion in France, believing \"that such a great country must depend\r\nmore upon interior sentiment than exterior operations.\" He took a half\r\nmelancholy, half sardonic interest in the overthrow of the Catholic\r\nreligion by the revolutionists; who had assailed it with the true French\r\nweapon, ridicule, but ridicule of a very grim and unpleasant kind. The\r\npeople who five years before had fallen down in the dirt as the\r\nconsecrated matter passed by, now danced the carmagnole in holy\r\nvestments, and took part in some other mummeries a great deal more\r\nblasphemous. At the famous Feast of Reason, which Morris described as a\r\nkind of opera performed in Notre Dame, the president of the Convention,\r\nand other public characters, adored on bended knees a girl who stood in\r\nthe place _ci-devant_ most holy to personate Reason herself. This girl,\r\nSaunier by name, followed the trades of an opera dancer and harlot; she\r\nwas \"very beautiful and next door to an idiot as to her intellectual\r\ngifts.\" Among her feats was having appeared in a ballet in a dress\r\nespecially designed, by the painter David, at her bidding, to be more\r\nindecent than nakedness. Altogether she was admirably fitted, both\r\nmorally and mentally, to personify the kind of reason shown and admired\r\nby the French revolutionists.\r\n\r\nWriting to a friend who was especially hostile to Romanism, Morris once\r\nremarked, with the humor that tinged even his most serious thoughts,\r\n\"Every day of my life gives me reason to question my own infallibility;\r\nand of course leads me further from confiding in that of the pope. But I\r\nhave lived to see a new religion arise. It consists in a denial of all\r\nreligion, and its votaries have the superstition of not being\r\nsuperstitious. They have this with as much zeal as any other sect, and\r\nare as ready to lay waste the world in order to make proselytes.\"\r\nAnother time, speaking of his country place at Sainport, to which he\r\nhad retired from Paris, he wrote: \"We are so scorched by a long drought\r\nthat in spite of all philosophic notions we are beginning our procession\r\nto obtain the favor of the _bon dieu_. Were it proper for _un homme\r\npublic et protestant_ to interfere, I should be tempted to tell them\r\nthat mercy is before sacrifice.\" Those individuals of arrested mental\r\ndevelopment who now make pilgrimages to our Lady of Lourdes had plenty\r\nof prototypes, even in the atheistical France of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn his letters home Morris occasionally made clear-headed comments on\r\nAmerican affairs. He considered that \"we should be unwise in the extreme\r\nto involve ourselves in the contests of European nations, where our\r\nweight could be but small, though the loss to ourselves would be\r\ncertain. We ought to be extremely watchful of foreign affairs, but there\r\nis a broad line between vigilance and activity.\" Both France and England\r\nhad violated their treaties with us; but the latter \"had behaved worst,\r\nand with deliberate intention.\" He especially laid stress upon the need\r\nof our having a navy; \"with twenty ships of the line at sea no nation on\r\nearth will dare to insult us;\" even aside from individual losses, five\r\nyears of war would involve more national expense than the support of a\r\nnavy for twenty years, and until we rendered ourselves respectable, we\r\nshould continue to be insulted. He never showed greater wisdom than in\r\nhis views about our navy; and his party, the federalists, started to\r\ngive us one; but it had hardly been begun before the Jeffersonians came\r\ninto power, and, with singular foolishness, stopped the work.\r\n\r\nWashington heartily sympathized with Morris's views as to the French\r\nRevolution; he wrote him that events had more than made good his\r\ngloomiest predictions. Jefferson, however, was utterly opposed to his\r\ntheories, and was much annoyed at the forcible way in which he painted\r\nthings as they were; characteristically enough, he only showed his\r\nannoyance by indirect methods,--leaving Morris's letters unanswered,\r\nkeeping him in the dark as to events at home, etc. Morris understood all\r\nthis perfectly, and was extremely relieved when Randolph became\r\nsecretary of state in Jefferson's stead. Almost immediately afterwards,\r\nhowever, he was himself recalled. The United States, having requested\r\nthe French government to withdraw Genet, a harlequin rather than a\r\ndiplomat, it was done at once, and in return a request was forwarded\r\nthat the United States would reciprocate by relieving Morris, which of\r\ncourse had to be done also. The revolutionary authorities both feared\r\nand disliked Morris; he could neither be flattered nor bullied, and he\r\nwas known to disapprove of their excesses. They also took umbrage at his\r\nhaughtiness; an unfortunate expression he used in one of his official\r\nletters to them, \"ma cour,\" gave great offense, as being\r\nunrepublican--precisely as they had previously objected to Washington's\r\nusing the phrase \"your people\" in writing to the king.\r\n\r\nWashington wrote him a letter warmly approving of his past conduct.\r\nNevertheless Morris was not over-pleased at being recalled. He thought\r\nthat, as things then were in France, any minister who gave satisfaction\r\nto its government would prove forgetful of the interests of America. He\r\nwas probably right; at any rate, what he feared was just what happened\r\nunder his successor, Monroe--a very amiable gentleman, but distinctly\r\none who comes in the category of those whose greatness is thrust upon\r\nthem. However, under the circumstances, it was probably impossible for\r\nour government to avoid recalling Morris.\r\n\r\nHe could say truthfully: \"I have the consolation to have made no\r\nsacrifice either of personal or national dignity, and I believe I should\r\nhave obtained everything if the American government had refused to\r\nrecall me.\" His services had been invaluable to us; he had kept our\r\nnational reputation at a high point, by the scrupulous heed with which\r\nhe saw that all our obligations were fulfilled, as well as by the firm\r\ncourage with which he insisted on our rights being granted us. He\r\nbelieved \"that all our treaties, however onerous, must be strictly\r\nfulfilled according to their true intent and meaning. The honest nation\r\nis that which, like the honest man, 'hath to its plighted faith and vow\r\nforever firmly stood, and though it promise to its loss, yet makes that\r\npromise good;'\" and in return he demanded that others should mete to us\r\nthe same justice we meted to them. He met each difficulty the instant it\r\narose, ever on the alert to protect his country and his countrymen; and\r\nwhat an ordinary diplomat could barely have done in time of peace, he\r\nsucceeded in doing amid the wild, shifting tumult of the Revolution,\r\nwhen almost every step he made was at his own personal hazard. He took\r\nprecisely the right stand; had he taken too hostile a position, he would\r\nhave been driven from the country, whereas had he been a sympathizer, he\r\nwould have more or less compromised America, as his successor afterwards\r\ndid. We have never had a foreign minister who deserved more honor than\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\nOne of the noteworthy features in his letters home was the accuracy\r\nwith which he foretold the course of events in the political world.\r\nLuzerne once said to him, \"Vous dites toujours les choses\r\nextraordinaires qui se realisent;\" and many other men, after some given\r\nevent had taken place, were obliged to confess their wonder at the way\r\nin which Morris's predictions concerning it had been verified. A notable\r\ninstance was his writing to Washington: \"Whatever may be the lot of\r\nFrance in remote futurity ... it seems evident that she must soon be\r\ngoverned by a single despot. Whether she will pass to that point through\r\nthe medium of a triumvirate or other small body of men, seems as yet\r\nundetermined. I think it most probable that she will.\" This was\r\ncertainly a remarkably accurate forecast as to the precise stages by\r\nwhich the already existing despotism was to be concentrated in a single\r\nindividual. He always insisted that, though it was difficult to foretell\r\nhow a single man would act, yet it was easy with regard to a mass of\r\nmen, for their peculiarities neutralized each other, and it was\r\nnecessary only to pay heed to the instincts of the average animal. He\r\nalso gave wonderfully clear-cut sketches of the more prominent actors in\r\naffairs; although one of his maxims was that \"in examining historical\r\nfacts we are too apt to ascribe to individuals the events which are\r\nproduced by general causes.\" Danton, for instance, he described as\r\nalways believing, and, what was worse for himself, maintaining, that a\r\npopular system of government was absurd in France; that the people were\r\ntoo ignorant, too inconstant, too corrupt, and felt too much the need of\r\na master; in short, that they had reached the point where Cato was a\r\nmadman, and Caesar a necessary evil. He acted on these principles; but he\r\nwas too voluptuous for his ambition, too indolent to acquire supreme\r\npower, and he cared for great wealth rather than great fame; so he \"fell\r\nat the feet of Robespierre.\" Similarly, said Morris, there passed away\r\nall the men of the 10th of August, all the men of the 2d of September;\r\nthe same mob that hounded them on with wild applause when they grasped\r\nthe blood-stained reins of power, a few months later hooted at them with\r\nferocious derision as they went their way to the guillotine. Paris ruled\r\nFrance, and the _sans culottes_ ruled Paris; factions continually arose,\r\nwaging inexplicable war, each in turn acquiring a momentary influence\r\nwhich was founded on fear alone, and all alike unable to build up any\r\nstable or lasting government.\r\n\r\nEach new stroke of the guillotine weakened the force of liberal\r\nsentiment, and diminished the chances of a free system. Morris wondered\r\nonly that, in a country ripe for a tyrant's rule, four years of\r\nconvulsions among twenty-four millions of people had brought forth\r\nneither a soldier nor yet a statesman, whose head was fitted to wear the\r\ncap that fortune had woven. Despising the mob as utterly as did Oliver\r\nCromwell himself, and realizing the supine indifference with which the\r\nFrench people were willing to accept a master, he yet did full justice\r\nto the pride with which they resented outside attack, and the enthusiasm\r\nwith which they faced their foes. He saw the immense resources possessed\r\nby a nation to whom war abroad was a necessity for the preservation of\r\npeace at home, and with whom bankruptcy was but a starting-point for\r\nfresh efforts. The whole energy and power lay in the hands of the\r\nrevolutionists; the men of the old regime had fled, leaving only that\r\n\"waxen substance,\" the propertied class, \"who in foreign wars count so\r\nmuch, and in civil wars so little.\" He had no patience with those\r\ndespicable beings, the traders and merchants who have forgotten how to\r\nfight, the rich who are too timid to guard their wealth, the men of\r\nproperty, large or small, who need peace, and yet have not the sense and\r\ncourage to be always prepared to conquer it.\r\n\r\nIn his whole attitude towards the Revolution, Morris represents better\r\nthan any other man the clear-headed, practical statesman, who is\r\ngenuinely devoted to the cause of constitutional freedom. He was utterly\r\nopposed to the old system of privilege on the one hand, and to the wild\r\nexcesses of the fanatics on the other. The few liberals of the\r\nRevolution were the only men in it who deserve our true respect. The\r\nrepublicans who champion the deeds of the Jacobins, are traitors to\r\ntheir own principles; for the spirit of Jacobinism, instead of being\r\nidentical with, is diametrically opposed to the spirit of true liberty.\r\nJacobinism, socialism, communism, nihilism, and anarchism--these are the\r\nreal foes of a democratic republic, for each one, if it obtains control,\r\nobtains it only as the sure forerunner of a despotic tyranny and of some\r\nform of the one-man power.\r\n\r\nMorris, an American, took a clearer and truer view of the French\r\nRevolution than did any of the contemporary European observers. Yet\r\nwhile with them it was the all-absorbing event of the age, with him, as\r\nis evident by his writings, it was merely an important episode; for to\r\nhim it was dwarfed by the American Revolution of a decade or two back.\r\nTo the Europeans of the present day, as yet hardly awake to the fact\r\nthat already the change has begun that will make Europe but a fragment,\r\ninstead of the whole, of the civilized world, the French Revolution is\r\nthe great historical event of our times. But in reality it affected only\r\nthe people of western and central Europe; not the Russians, not the\r\nEnglish-speaking nations, not the Spaniards who dwelt across the\r\nAtlantic. America and Australia had their destinies moulded by the\r\ncrisis of 1776, not by the crisis of 1789. What the French Revolution\r\nwas to the states within Europe, that the American Revolution was to the\r\ncontinents without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSTAY IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonroe, as Morris's successor, entered upon his new duties with an\r\nimmense flourish, and rapidly gave a succession of startling proofs that\r\nhe was a minister altogether too much to the taste of the frenzied\r\nJacobinical republicans to whom he was accredited. Indeed, his capers\r\nwere almost as extraordinary as their own, and seem rather like the\r\nantics of some of the early French commanders in Canada, in their\r\nefforts to ingratiate themselves with their Indian allies, than like the\r\nperformance we should expect from a sober Virginian gentleman on a\r\nmission to a civilized nation. He stayed long enough to get our affairs\r\ninto a snarl, and was then recalled by Washington, receiving from the\r\nlatter more than one scathing rebuke.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fault was really less with him than with his party and with\r\nthose who sent him. Monroe was an honorable man with a very un-original\r\nmind, and he simply reflected the wild, foolish views held by all his\r\nfellows of the Jeffersonian democratic-republican school concerning\r\nFrance--for our politics were still French and English, but not yet\r\nAmerican. His appointment was an excellent example of the folly of\r\ntrying to carry on a government on a \"non-partisan\" basis. Washington\r\nwas only gradually weaned from this theory by bitter experience; both\r\nJefferson and Monroe helped to teach him the lesson. It goes without\r\nsaying that in a well-ordered government the great bulk of the employees\r\nin the civil service, the men whose functions are merely to execute\r\nfaithfully routine departmental work, should hold office during good\r\nbehavior, and should be appointed without reference to their politics;\r\nbut if the higher public servants, such as the heads of departments and\r\nthe foreign ministers, are not in complete accord with their chief, the\r\nonly result can be to introduce halting indecision and vacillation into\r\nthe counsels of the nation, without gaining a single compensating\r\nadvantage, and without abating by one iota the virulence of party\r\npassion. To appoint Monroe, an extreme Democrat, to France, while at the\r\nsame time appointing Jay, a strong Federalist, to England, was not only\r\nan absurdity which did nothing towards reconciling the Federalists and\r\nDemocrats, but, bearing in mind how these parties stood respectively\r\ntowards England and France, it was also an actual wrong, for it made our\r\nforeign policy seem double-faced and deceitful. While one minister was\r\nformally embracing such of the Parisian statesmen as had hitherto\r\nescaped the guillotine, and was going through various other theatrical\r\nperformances that do not appeal to any but a Gallic mind, his fellow was\r\nengaged in negotiating a treaty in England that was so obnoxious to\r\nFrance as almost to bring us to a rupture with her. The Jay treaty was\r\nnot altogether a good one, and a better might perhaps have been secured;\r\nstill, it was better than nothing, and Washington was right in urging\r\nits adoption, even while admitting that it was not entirely\r\nsatisfactory. But certainly, if we intended to enter into such\r\nengagements with Great Britain, it was rank injustice to both Monroe and\r\nFrance to send such a man as the former to such a country as the latter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Morris, instead of returning to America, was forced by his\r\nbusiness affairs to prolong his stay abroad for several years. During\r\nthis time he journeyed at intervals through England, the Netherlands,\r\nGermany, Prussia, and Austria. His European reputation was well\r\nestablished, and he was everywhere received gladly into the most\r\ndistinguished society of the time. What made him especially welcome was\r\nhis having now definitely taken sides with the anti-revolutionists in\r\nthe great conflict of arms and opinions then raging through Europe; and\r\nhis brilliancy, the boldness with which he had behaved as minister\r\nduring the Terror, and the reputation given him by the French _emigres_,\r\nall joined to cause him to be hailed with pleasure by the aristocratic\r\nparty. It is really curious to see the consideration with which he was\r\neverywhere treated, although again a mere private individual, and the\r\nterms of intimacy on which he was admitted into the most exclusive\r\nsocial and diplomatic circles at the various courts. He thus became an\r\nintimate friend of many of the foremost people of the period. His\r\npolitical observation, however, became less trustworthy than heretofore;\r\nfor he was undoubtedly soured by his removal, and the excesses of the\r\nrevolutionists had excited such horror in his mind as to make him no\r\nlonger an impartial judge. His forecasts and judgments on the military\r\nsituation in particular, although occasionally right, were usually very\r\nwild. He fully appreciated Napoleon's utter unscrupulousness and\r\nmarvelous mendacity; but to the end of his life he remained unwilling to\r\ndo justice to the emperor's still more remarkable warlike genius, going\r\nso far, after the final Russian campaign, as to speak of old Kutusoff\r\nas his equal. Indeed, in spite of one or two exceptions,--notably his\r\npredicting almost the exact date of the retreat from Moscow,--his\r\ncriticisms on Napoleon's military operations do not usually stand much\r\nabove the rather ludicrous level recently reached by Count Tolstoi.\r\n\r\nMorris was relieved by Monroe in August, 1794, and left Paris for\r\nSwitzerland in October. He stopped at Coppet and spent a day with Madame\r\nde Stael, where there was a little French society that lived at her\r\nexpense and was as gay as circumstances would permit. He had never been\r\nparticularly impressed with the much vaunted society of the salon, and\r\nthis small survival thereof certainly had no overpowering attraction for\r\nhim, if we may judge by the entry in his diary: \"The road to her house\r\nis up-hill and execrable, and I think I shall not again go thither.\"\r\nMankind was still blind to the grand beauty of the Alps,--it must be\r\nremembered that the admiration of mountain scenery is, to the shame of\r\nour forefathers be it said, almost a growth of the present century,--and\r\nMorris took more interest in the Swiss population than in their\r\nsurroundings. He wrote that in Switzerland the spirit of commerce had\r\nbrought about a baseness of morals which nothing could cure but the\r\nsame spirit carried still further:--\"It teaches eventually fair dealing\r\nas the most profitable dealing. The first lesson of trade is, My son,\r\nget money. The second is, My son, get money, honestly if you can, but\r\nget money. The third is, My son, get money; but honestly, if you would\r\nget much money.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to Great Britain in the following summer, and spent a year\r\nthere. At one time he visited the North, staying with the Dukes of\r\nArgyle, Atholl and Montrose, and was very much pleased with Scotland,\r\nwhere everything he saw convinced him that the country was certain of a\r\nrapid and vigorous growth. On his return he stopped with the Bishop of\r\nLandaff, at Colgate Park. The bishop announced that he was a stanch\r\nopposition man, and a firm whig; to which statement Morris adds in his\r\ndiary: \"Let this be as it will, he is certainly a good landlord and a\r\nman of genius.\"\r\n\r\nBut Morris was now a favored guest in ministerial, even more than in\r\nopposition circles; he was considered to belong to what the czar\r\nafterwards christened the \"parti sain de l'Europe.\" He saw a good deal\r\nof both Pitt and Grenville, and was consulted by them not only about\r\nAmerican, but also about European affairs; and a number of favors, which\r\nhe asked for some of his friends among the _emigres_, were granted. All\r\nhis visits were not on business, however; as, for instance, on July\r\n14th: \"Dine at Mr. Pitt's. We sit down at six. Lords Grenville, Chatham,\r\nand another come later. The rule is established for six precisely, which\r\nis right, I think. The wines are good and the conversation flippant.\"\r\nMorris helped Grenville in a number of ways, at the Prussian court for\r\ninstance; and was even induced by him to write a letter to Washington,\r\nattempting to put the English attitude toward us in a good light.\r\nWashington, however, was no more to be carried off his feet in favor of\r\nthe English than against them; and the facts he brought out in his reply\r\nshowed that Morris had rather lost his poise, and had been hurried into\r\nan action that was ill advised. He was quite often at court; and relates\r\na conversation with the king, wherein that monarch's language seems to\r\nhave been much such as tradition assigns him--short, abrupt sentences,\r\nrepetitions, and the frequent use of \"what.\"\r\n\r\nHe also saw a good deal of the royalist refugees. Some of them he liked\r\nand was intimate with; but the majority disgusted him and made him\r\nutterly impatient with their rancorous folly. He commented on the\r\nstrange levity and wild negotiations of the Count d'Artois, and\r\nprophesied that his character was such as to make his projected attempt\r\non La Vendee hopeless from the start. Another day he was at the Marquis\r\nde Spinola's: \"The conversation here, where our company consists of\r\naristocrats of the first feather, turns on French affairs. They, at\r\nfirst, agree that union among the French is necessary. But when they\r\ncome to particulars, they fly off and are mad. Madame Spinola would send\r\nthe Duke of Orleans to Siberia. An abbe, a young man, talks much and\r\nloud, to show his _esprit_; and to hear them one would suppose they were\r\nquite at their ease in a _petit souper de Paris_.\" Of that ponderous\r\nexile, the chief of the House of Bourbon, and afterwards Louis XVIII, he\r\nsaid that, in his opinion, he had nothing to do but to try to get shot,\r\nthereby redeeming by valor the foregone follies of his conduct.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1796, Morris returned to the continent, and started on another\r\ntour, in his own carriage; having spent some time himself in breaking in\r\nhis young and restive horses to their task. He visited all the different\r\ncapitals, at one time or another; among them, Berlin, where, as usual,\r\nhe was very well received. For all his horror of Jacobinism, Morris was\r\na thorough American, perfectly independent, without a particle of the\r\nsnob in his disposition, and valuing his acquaintances for what they\r\nwere, not for their titles. In his diary he puts down the Queen of\r\nEngland as \"a well-bred, sensible woman,\" and the Empress of Austria as\r\n\"a good sort of little woman,\" and contemptuously dismisses the Prussian\r\nking with a word, precisely as he does with any one else. One of the\r\nentries in his journal, while he was staying in Berlin, offers a case in\r\npoint. \"July 23d, I dine, very much against my will, with Prince\r\nFerdinand. I was engaged to a very agreeable party, but it seems the\r\nhighnesses must never be denied, unless it be from indisposition. I had,\r\nhowever, written a note declining the intended honor; but the messenger,\r\nupon looking at it, for it was a letter patent, like the invitation,\r\nsaid he could not deliver it; that nobody ever refused; all of which I\r\nwas informed of after he was gone. On consulting I found that I must go\r\nor give mortal offense, which last I have no inclination to do; so I\r\nwrite another note, and send out to hunt up the messenger. While I am\r\nabroad this untoward incident is arranged, and of course I am at\r\nBellevue.\" While at court on one occasion he met, and took a great fancy\r\nto, the daughter of the famous Baroness Riedesel; having been born in\r\nthe United States, she had been christened America.\r\n\r\nIn one of his conversations with the king, who was timid and hesitating,\r\nMorris told him that the Austrians would be all right if he would only\r\nlend them some Prussian generals--a remark upon which Jena and Auerstadt\r\nlater on offered a curious commentary. He became very impatient with the\r\nking's inability to make up his mind; and wrote to the Duchess of\r\nCumberland that \"the guardian angel of the French Republic kept him\r\nlingering on this side of the grave.\" He wrote to Lord Grenville that\r\nPrussia was \"seeking little things by little means,\" and that the war\r\nwith Poland was popular \"because the moral principles of a Prussian go\r\nto the possession of whatever he can acquire. And so little is he the\r\nslave of what he calls vulgar prejudice, that, give him opportunity and\r\nmeans, and he will spare you the trouble of finding a pretext. This\r\nliberality of sentiment greatly facilitates negotiation, for it is not\r\nnecessary to clothe propositions in honest and decent forms.\" Morris was\r\na most startling phenomenon to the diplomatists of the day, trampling\r\nwith utter disregard on all their hereditary theories of finesse and\r\ncautious duplicity. The timid formalists, and more especially those who\r\nconsidered double-dealing as the legitimate, and in fact the only\r\nlegitimate, weapon of their trade, were displeased with him; but he was\r\nvery highly thought of by such as could see the strength and\r\noriginality of the views set forth in his frank, rather over-bold\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nAt Dresden he notes that he was late on the day set down for his\r\npresentation at court, owing to his valet having translated _halb zwoelf_\r\nas half past twelve. The Dresden picture galleries were the first that\r\ndrew from him any very strong expressions of admiration. In the city\r\nwere numbers of the _emigres_, fleeing from their countrymen, and only\r\npermitted to stop in Saxony for a few days; yet they were serene and\r\ngay, and spent their time in busy sightseeing, examining everything\r\ncurious which they could get at. Morris had become pretty well\r\naccustomed to the way in which they met fate; but such lively\r\nresignation surprised even him, and he remarked that so great a calamity\r\nhad never lighted on shoulders so well fitted to bear it.\r\n\r\nAt Vienna he made a long stay, not leaving it until January, 1797. Here,\r\nas usual, he fraternized at once with the various diplomatists; the\r\nEnglish ambassador, Sir Morton Eden, in particular, going out of his way\r\nto show him every attention. The Austrian prime minister, M. Thugut, was\r\nalso very polite; and so were the foreign ministers of all the powers.\r\nHe was soon at home in the upper social circles of this German Paris;\r\nbut from the entries in his journal it is evident that he thought very\r\nlittle of Viennese society. He liked talking and the company of\r\nbrilliant conversationalists, and he abominated gambling; but in Vienna\r\nevery one was so devoted to play that there was no conversation at all.\r\nHe considered a dumb circle round a card-table as the dullest society in\r\nthe world, and in Vienna there was little else. Nor was he impressed\r\nwith the ability of the statesmen he met. He thought the Austrian nobles\r\nto be on the decline; they stood for the dying feudal system. The great\r\nfamilies had been squandering their riches with the most reckless\r\nextravagance, and were becoming broken and impoverished; and the\r\nimperial government was glad to see the humiliation of the haughty\r\nnobles, not perceiving that, if preserved, they would act as a buffer\r\nbetween it and the new power beginning to make itself felt throughout\r\nEurope, and would save the throne if not from total overthrow, at least\r\nfrom shocks so fierce as greatly to weaken it.\r\n\r\nMorris considered Prince Esterhazy as an archtypical representative of\r\nthe class. He was captain of the noble Hungarian Guard, a small body of\r\ntall, handsome men on fiery steeds, magnificently caparisoned. The\r\nPrince, as its commander, wore a Hungarian dress, scarlet, with fur cape\r\nand cuffs, and yellow morocco boots; everything embroidered with\r\npearls, four hundred and seventy large ones, and many thousand small,\r\nbut all put on in good taste. He had a collar of large diamonds, a plume\r\nof diamonds in his cap; and his sword-hilt, scabbard, and spurs were\r\ninlaid with the same precious stones. His horse was equally bejeweled;\r\nsteed and rider, with their trappings, \"were estimated at a value of a\r\nquarter of a million dollars.\" Old Bluecher would surely have considered\r\nthe pair \"very fine plunder.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince was reported to be nominally the richest subject in Europe,\r\nwith a revenue that during the Turkish war went up to a million guilders\r\nannually; yet he was hopelessly in debt already and getting deeper every\r\nyear. He lived in great magnificence, but was by no means noted for\r\nlavish hospitality; all his extravagance was reserved for himself,\r\nespecially for purposes of display. His Vienna stable contained a\r\nhundred and fifty horses; and during a six weeks' residence in\r\nFrankfort, where he was ambassador at the time of an imperial\r\ncoronation, he spent eighty thousand pounds. Altogether, an outsider may\r\nbe pardoned for not at first seeing precisely what useful function such\r\na merely gorgeous being performed in the body politic; yet when summoned\r\nbefore the bar of the new world-forces, Esterhazy and his kind showed\r\nthat birds of such fine feathers sometimes had beaks and talons as well,\r\nand knew how to use them, the craven flight of the French noblesse to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nMorris was often at court, where the constant theme of conversation was\r\nnaturally the struggle with the French armies under Moreau and\r\nBonaparte. After one of these mornings he mentions: \"The levee was oddly\r\narranged, all the males being in one apartment, through which the\r\nEmperor passes in going to chapel, and returns the same way with the\r\nEmpress and imperial family; after which they go through their own rooms\r\nto the ladies assembled on the other side.\"\r\n\r\nThe English members of the _Corps Diplomatique_ in all the European\r\ncapitals were especially civil to him; and he liked them more than their\r\ncontinental brethren. But for some of their young tourist countrymen he\r\ncared less; and it is curious to see that the ridicule to which\r\nAmericans have rightly exposed themselves by their absurd fondness for\r\nuniforms and for assuming military titles to which they have no warrant,\r\nwas no less deservedly earned by the English at the end of the last\r\ncentury. One of Morris's friends, Baron Groshlaer, being, like the other\r\nViennese, curious to know the object of his stay,--they guessed aright\r\nthat he wished to get Lafayette liberated,--at last almost asked him\r\noutright about it. \"Finally I tell him that the only difference between\r\nme and the young Englishmen, of whom there is a swarm here, is, that I\r\nseek instruction with gray hairs and they with brown.... At the\r\nArchduchess's one of the little princes, brother to the Emperor, and who\r\nis truly an _arch_-duke, asks me to explain to him the different\r\nuniforms worn by the young English, of whom there are a great number\r\nhere, all in regimentals. Some of these belong to no corps at all, and\r\nthe others to yeomanry, fencibles and the like, all of which purport to\r\nbe raised for the defense of their country in case she should be\r\ninvaded; but now, when the invasion seems most imminent, they are\r\nabroad, and cannot be made to feel the ridiculous indecency of appearing\r\nin regimentals. Sir M. Eden and others have given them the broadest\r\nhints without the least effect. One of them told me that all the world\r\nshould not laugh him out of his regimentals. I bowed.... I tell the\r\nprince that I really am not able to answer his question, but that, in\r\ngeneral, their dresses I believe are worn for convenience in traveling.\r\nHe smiles at this.... If I were an Englishman I should be hurt at these\r\nexhibitions, and as it is I am sorry for them.... I find that here they\r\nassume it as unquestionable that the young men of England have a right\r\nto adjust the ceremonial of Vienna. The political relations of the two\r\ncountries induce the good company here to treat them with politeness;\r\nbut nothing prevents their being laughed at, as I found the other\r\nevening at Madame de Groshlaer's, where the young women as well as the\r\ngirls were very merry at the expense of these young men.\"\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Vienna he again passed through Berlin, and in a\r\nconversation with the king he foreshadowed curiously the state of\r\npolitics a century later, and showed that he thoroughly appreciated the\r\ncause that would in the end reconcile the traditional enmity of the\r\nHohenzollerns and Hapsburgs. \"After some trifling things I tell him that\r\nI have just seen his best friend. He asks who? and, to his great\r\nsurprise, I reply, the Emperor. He speaks of him well personally, and I\r\nobserve that he is a very honest young man, to which his Majesty replies\r\nby asking, \"Mais, que pensez vous de Thugut.\" \"Quant a cela, c'est une\r\nautre affaire, sire.\" I had stated the interest, which makes him and the\r\nEmperor good friends, to be their mutual apprehensions from Russia. \"But\r\nsuppose we all three unite?\" \"Ce sera un diable de fricassee, sire, si\r\nvous vous mettez tous les trois a casser les oeufs.\"\"\r\n\r\nAt Brunswick he was received with great hospitality, the Duke, and\r\nparticularly the Duchess Dowager, the King of England's sister, treating\r\nhim very hospitably. He here saw General Riedesel, with whom he was most\r\nfriendly; the general in the course of conversation inveighed bitterly\r\nagainst Burgoyne. He went to Munich also, where he was received on a\r\nvery intimate footing by Count Rumford, then the great power in Bavaria,\r\nwho was busily engaged in doing all he could to better the condition of\r\nhis country. Morris was much interested in his reforms. They were\r\ncertainly needed; the Count told his friend that on assuming the reins\r\nof power, the abuses to be remedied were beyond belief--for instance,\r\nthere was one regiment of cavalry that had five field officers and only\r\nthree horses. With some of the friends that Morris made--such as the\r\nDuchess of Cumberland, the Princess de la Tour et Taxis and others--he\r\ncorresponded until the end of his life.\r\n\r\nWhile at Vienna he again did all he could to get Lafayette released from\r\nprison, where his wife was confined with him; but in vain. Madame de\r\nLafayette's sister, the Marquise de Montagu, and Madame de Stael, both\r\nwrote him the most urgent appeals to do what he could for the prisoners;\r\nthe former writing, \"My sister is in danger of losing the life you\r\nsaved in the prisons of Paris ... has not he whom Europe numbers among\r\nthose citizens of whom North America ought to be most proud, has not he\r\nthe right to make himself heard in favor of a citizen of the United\r\nStates, and of a wife, whose life belongs to him, since he has preserved\r\nit?\" Madame de Stael felt the most genuine grief for Lafayette, and very\r\nsincere respect for Morris; and in her letters to the latter she\r\ndisplayed both sentiments with a lavish exaggeration that hardly seems\r\nin good taste. If Morris had needed a spur the letters would have\r\nsupplied it; but the task was an impossible one, and Lafayette was not\r\nreleased until the peace in 1797, when he was turned over to the\r\nAmerican consul at Hamburg, in Morris's presence.\r\n\r\nMorris was able to render more effectual help to an individual far less\r\nworthy of it than Lafayette. This was the then Duke of Orleans,\r\nafterwards King Louis Philippe, who had fled from France with Dumouriez.\r\nMorris's old friend, Madame de Flahaut, appealed to him almost\r\nhysterically on the duke's behalf; and he at once did even more than she\r\nrequested, giving the duke money wherewith to go to America, and also\r\nfurnishing him with unlimited credit at his own New York banker's,\r\nduring his wanderings in the United States. This was done for the sake\r\nof the Duchess of Orleans, to whom Morris was devotedly attached, not\r\nfor the sake of the duke himself. The latter knew this perfectly,\r\nwriting: \"Your kindness is a blessing I owe to my mother and to our\r\nfriend\" (Madame de Flahaut). The bourgeois king admirably represented\r\nthe meanest, smallest side of the bourgeois character; he was not a bad\r\nman, but he was a very petty and contemptible one; had he been born in a\r\ndifferent station of life, he would have been just the individual to\r\ntake a prominent part in local temperance meetings, while he sanded the\r\nsugar he sold in his corner grocery. His treatment of Morris's loan was\r\ncharacteristic. When he came into his rights again, at the Restoration,\r\nhe at first appeared to forget his debt entirely, and when his memory\r\nwas jogged, he merely sent Morris the original sum, without a word of\r\nthanks; whereupon Morris, rather nettled, and as prompt to stand up for\r\nhis rights against a man in prosperity as he had been to help him when\r\nin adversity, put the matter in the hands of his lawyer, through whom he\r\nnotified Louis Philippe that if the affair was to be treated on a merely\r\nbusiness basis, it should then be treated in a strictly business way,\r\nand the interest for the twenty years that had gone by should be\r\nforwarded also. This was accordingly done, although not until after\r\nMorris's death, the entire sum refunded being seventy thousand francs.\r\n\r\nMorris brought his complicated business affairs in Europe to a close in\r\n1798, and sailed from Hamburg on October 4th of that year, reaching New\r\nYork after an exceedingly tedious and disagreeable voyage of eighty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorris was very warmly greeted on his return; and it was evident that\r\nthe length of his stay abroad had in nowise made him lose ground with\r\nhis friends at home. His natural affiliations were all with the\r\nFederalist party, which he immediately joined.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1799 he did not take much part in politics, as he was\r\noccupied in getting his business affairs in order and in putting to\r\nrights his estates at Morrisania. The old manor house had become such a\r\ncrazy, leaky affair that he tore it down and built a new one; a great,\r\nroomy building, not in the least showy, but solid, comfortable, and in\r\nperfect taste; having, across the tree-clad hills of Westchester, a\r\nsuperb view of the Sound, with its jagged coast and capes and islands.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was so long since he had practiced law, he was shortly\r\nengaged in a very important case that was argued for eight days before\r\nthe Court of Errors in Albany. Few trials in the State of New York have\r\never brought together such a number of men of remarkable legal ability;\r\nfor among the lawyers engaged on one side or the other were Morris,\r\nHamilton, Burr, Robert Livingstone, and Troup. There were some sharp\r\npassages of arms: and the trial of wits between Morris and Hamilton in\r\nparticular were so keen as to cause a passing coolness.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years that had gone by since Morris sailed for Europe,\r\nthe control of the national government had been in the hands of the\r\nFederalists; when he returned, party bitterness was at the highest\r\npitch, for the Democrats were preparing to make the final push for power\r\nwhich should overthrow and ruin their antagonists. Four-fifths of the\r\ntalent, ability, and good sense of the country were to be found in the\r\nFederalist ranks; for the Federalists had held their own so far, by\r\nsheer force of courage and intellectual vigor, over foes in reality more\r\nnumerous. Their great prop had been Washington. His colossal influence\r\nwas to the end decisive in party contests, and he had in fact, although\r\nhardly in name, almost entirely abandoned his early attempts at\r\nnon-partisanship, had grown to distrust Madison as he long before had\r\ndistrusted Jefferson, and had come into constantly closer relations with\r\ntheir enemies. His death diminished greatly the chances of Federalist\r\nsuccess; there were two other causes at work that destroyed them\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nOne of these was the very presence in the dominant party of so many men\r\nnearly equal in strong will and great intellectual power; their\r\nambitions and theories clashed; even the loftiness of their aims, and\r\ntheir disdain of everything small, made them poor politicians, and with\r\nWashington out of the way there was no one commander to overawe the rest\r\nand to keep down the fierce bickerings constantly arising among them;\r\nwhile in the other party there was a single leader, Jefferson,\r\nabsolutely without a rival, but supported by a host of sharp political\r\nworkers, most skillful in marshaling that unwieldy and hitherto\r\ndisunited host of voters who were inferior in intelligence to their\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nThe second cause lay deep in the nature of the Federalist organization:\r\nit was its distrust of the people. This was the fatally weak streak in\r\nFederalism. In a government such as ours it was a foregone conclusion\r\nthat a party which did not believe in the people would sooner or later\r\nbe thrown from power unless there was an armed break-up of the system.\r\nThe distrust was felt, and of course excited corresponding and intense\r\nhostility. Had the Federalists been united, and had they freely trusted\r\nin the people, the latter would have shown that the trust was well\r\nfounded; but there was no hope for leaders who suspected each other and\r\nfeared their followers.\r\n\r\nMorris landed just as the Federalist reaction, brought about by the\r\nconduct of France, had spent itself,--thanks partly to some inopportune\r\npieces of insolence from England, in which country, as Morris once wrote\r\nto a foreign friend, \"on a toujours le bon esprit de vouloir prendre les\r\nmouches avec du vinaigre.\" The famous alien and sedition laws were\r\nexciting great disgust, and in Virginia and Kentucky Jefferson was using\r\nthem as handles wherewith to guide seditious agitation--not that he\r\nbelieved in sedition, but because he considered it good party policy,\r\nfor the moment, to excite it. The parties hated each other with\r\nrancorous virulence; the newspapers teemed with the foulest abuse of\r\npublic men, accusations of financial dishonesty were rife, Washington\r\nhimself not being spared, and the most scurrilous personalities were\r\nbandied about between the different editors. The Federalists were split\r\ninto two factions, one following the President, Adams, in his efforts to\r\nkeep peace with France, if it could be done with honor, while the\r\nothers, under Hamilton's lead, wished war at once.\r\n\r\nPennsylvanian politics were already very low. The leaders who had taken\r\ncontrol were men of mean capacity and small morality, and the State was\r\nnot only becoming rapidly democratic but was also drifting along in a\r\ndisorganized, pseudo-jacobinical, half insurrectionary kind of way that\r\nwould have boded ill for its future had it not been fettered by the\r\npresence of healthier communities round about it. New England was the\r\nonly part of the community, excepting Delaware, where Federalism was on\r\na perfectly sound footing; for in that section there was no caste\r\nspirit, the leaders and their followers were thoroughly in touch, and\r\nall the citizens, shrewd, thrifty, independent, were used to\r\nself-government, and fully awake to the fact that honesty and order are\r\nthe prerequisites of liberty. Yet even here Democracy had made some\r\ninroads.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Potomac the Federalists had lost ground rapidly. Virginia\r\nwas still a battlefield; as long as Washington lived, his tremendous\r\npersonal influence acted as a brake on the democratic advance, and the\r\nstate's greatest orator, Patrick Henry, had halted beside the grave to\r\ndenounce the seditious schemes of the disunion agitators with the same\r\nburning, thrilling eloquence that, thirty years before, had stirred to\r\ntheir depths the hearts of his hearers when he bade defiance to the\r\ntyrannous might of the British king. But when these two men were dead,\r\nMarshall,--though destined, as chief and controlling influence in the\r\nthird division of our governmental system, to mould the whole of that\r\nsystem on the lines of Federalist thought, and to prove that a sound\r\njudiciary could largely affect an unsound executive and\r\nlegislature,--even Marshall could not, single-handed, stem the current\r\nthat had gradually gathered head. Virginia stands easily first among all\r\nour commonwealths for the statesmen and warriors she has brought forth;\r\nand it is noteworthy that during the long contest between the\r\nnationalists and separatists, which forms the central fact in our\r\nhistory for the first three quarters of a century of our national life,\r\nshe gave leaders to both sides at the two great crises: Washington and\r\nMarshall to the one, and Jefferson to the other, when the question was\r\none of opinion as to whether the Union should be built up; and when the\r\nappeal to arms was made to tear it down, Farragut and Thomas to the\r\nnorth, Lee and Jackson to the south.\r\n\r\nThere was one eddy in the tide of democratic success that flowed so\r\nstrongly to the southward. This was in South Carolina. The fierce little\r\nPalmetto state has always been a free lance among her southern sisters;\r\nfor instance, though usually ultra-democratic, she was hostile to the\r\ntwo great democratic chiefs, Jefferson and Jackson, though both were\r\nfrom the south. At the time that Morris came home, the brilliant little\r\ngroup of Federalist leaders within her bounds, headed by men of national\r\nrenown like Pinckney and Harper, kept her true to Federalism by\r\ndownright force of intellect and integrity; for they were among the\r\npurest as well as the ablest statesmen of the day.\r\n\r\nNew York had been going through a series of bitter party contests; any\r\none examining a file of papers of that day will come to the conclusion\r\nthat party spirit was even more violent and unreasonable then than now.\r\nThe two great Federalist leaders, Hamilton and Jay, stood head and\r\nshoulders above all their democratic competitors, and they were backed\r\nby the best men in the state, like Rufus King, Schuyler and others. But,\r\nthough as orators and statesmen they had no rivals, they were very\r\ndeficient in the arts of political management. Hamilton's imperious\r\nhaughtiness had alienated the powerful family of the Livingstones, who\r\nhad thrown in their lot with the Clintonians; and a still more valuable\r\nally to the latter had arisen in that consummate master of \"machine\"\r\npolitics, Aaron Burr. In 1792, Jay, then chief justice of the United\r\nStates, had run for governor against Clinton, and had received the\r\nmajority of the votes; but had been counted out by the returning board\r\nin spite of the protest of its four Federalist members--Gansevoort,\r\nRoosevelt, Jones, and Sands. The indignation was extreme, and only Jay's\r\npatriotism and good sense prevented an outbreak. However, the memory of\r\nthe fraud remained fresh in the minds of the citizens, and at the next\r\nelection for governor he was chosen by a heavy majority, having then\r\njust come back from his mission to England. Soon afterwards his treaty\r\nwas published, and excited a whirlwind of indignation; it was only\r\nratified in the senate through Washington's great influence, backed by\r\nthe magnificent oratory of Fisher Ames, whose speech on this occasion,\r\nwhen he was almost literally on his death-bed, ranks among the half\r\ndozen greatest of our country. The treaty was very objectionable in\r\ncertain points, but it was most necessary to our well-being, and Jay was\r\nprobably the only American who could have negotiated it. As with the\r\nAshburton treaty many years later, extreme sections in England attacked\r\nit as fiercely as did the extreme sections here; and Lord Sheffield\r\nvoiced their feelings when he hailed the war of 1812 as offering a\r\nchance to England to get back the advantages out of which \"Jay had duped\r\nGrenville.\"\r\n\r\nBut the clash with France shortly afterwards swept away the recollection\r\nof the treaty, and Jay was reelected in 1798. One of the arguments, by\r\nthe way, which was used against him in the canvass was that he was an\r\nabolitionist. But, in spite of his reelection, the New York Democrats\r\nwere steadily gaining ground.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when Morris returned. He at once took high rank\r\namong the Federalists, and in April, 1800, just before the final wreck\r\nof their party, was chosen by them to fill an unexpired term of three\r\nyears in the United States Senate. Before this he had made it evident\r\nthat his sympathies lay with Hamilton and those who did not think highly\r\nof Adams. He did not deem it wise to renominate the latter for the\r\nPresidency. He had even written to Washington, earnestly beseeching him\r\nto accept the nomination; but Washington died a day or two after the\r\nletter was sent. In spite of the jarring between the leaders, the\r\nFederalists nominated Adams and Pinckney. In the ensuing Presidential\r\nelection many of the party chiefs, notably Marshall of Virginia, already\r\na strong Adams man, faithfully stood by the ticket in its entirety; but\r\nHamilton, Morris, and many others at the North probably hoped in their\r\nhearts that, by the aid of the curious electoral system which then\r\nexisted, some chance would put the great Carolinian in the first place\r\nand make him President. Indeed, there is little question that this might\r\nhave been done, had not Pinckney, one of the most high-minded and\r\ndisinterested statesmen we have ever had, emphatically declined to\r\nprofit in any way by the hurting of the grim old Puritan.\r\n\r\nThe house thus divided against itself naturally fell, and Jefferson was\r\nchosen President. It was in New York that the decisive struggle took\r\nplace, for that was the pivotal state; and there the Democrats, under\r\nthe lead of the Livingstones and Clintons, but above all by the masterly\r\npolitical manoeuvres of Aaron Burr, gained a crushing victory. Hamilton,\r\nstung to madness by the defeat, and sincerely believing that the success\r\nof his opponents would be fatal to the republic,--for the two parties\r\nhated each other with a blind fury unknown to the organizations of the\r\npresent day,--actually proposed to Jay, the governor, to nullify the\r\naction of the people by the aid of the old legislature, a Federalist\r\nbody, which was still holding over, although the members of its\r\nsuccessor had been chosen. Jay, as pure as he was brave, refused to\r\nsanction any such scheme of unworthy partisanship. It is worth noting\r\nthat the victors in this election introduced for the first time the\r\n\"spoils system,\" in all its rigor, into our state affairs; imitating the\r\nbad example of Pennsylvania a year or two previously.\r\n\r\nWhen the Federalists in Congress, into which body the choice for\r\nPresident had been thrown, took up Burr, as a less objectionable\r\nalternative than Jefferson, Morris, much to his credit, openly and\r\nheartily disapproved of the movement, and was sincerely glad that it\r\nfailed. For he thought Burr far the more dangerous man of the two, and,\r\nmoreover, did not believe that the evident intention of the people\r\nshould be thwarted. Both he and Hamilton, on this occasion, acted more\r\nwisely and more honestly than did most of their heated fellow-partisans.\r\nWriting to the latter, the former remarked: \"It is dangerous to be\r\nimpartial in politics; you, who are temperate in drinking, have never\r\nperhaps noticed the awkward situation of a man who continues sober after\r\nthe company are drunk.\"\r\n\r\nMorris joined the Senate at Philadelphia in May, 1800, but it almost\r\nimmediately adjourned, to meet at Washington in November, when he was\r\nagain present. Washington, as it then was, was a place whose straggling\r\nsqualor has often been described. Morris wrote to the Princess de la\r\nTour et Taxis, that it needed nothing \"but houses, cellars, kitchens,\r\nwell-informed men, amiable women, and other little trifles of the kind\r\nto make the city perfect;\" that it was \"the very best city in the world\r\nfor a future residence,\" but that as he was \"not one of those good\r\npeople whom we call posterity,\" he would meanwhile like to live\r\nsomewhere else.\r\n\r\nDuring his three years' term in the Senate he was one of the strong\r\npillars of the Federalist party; but he was both too independent and too\r\nerratic to act always within strict party lines, and while he was an\r\nultra-Federalist on some points, he openly abandoned his fellows on\r\nothers. He despised Jefferson as a tricky and incapable theorist,\r\nskillful in getting votes, but in nothing else; a man who believed \"in\r\nthe wisdom of mobs, and the moderation of Jacobins,\" and who found\r\nhimself \"in the wretched plight of being forced to turn out good\r\nofficers to make room for the unworthy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the election that turned them out of power, but just before their\r\nopponents took office, the Federalists in the Senate and House passed\r\nthe famous judiciary bill, and Adams signed it. It provided for a number\r\nof new federal judges to act throughout the states, while the supreme\r\ncourt was retained as the ultimate court of decision. It was an\r\nexcellent measure, inasmuch as it simplified the work of the judiciary,\r\nsaved the highest branch from useless traveling, prevented the calendars\r\nfrom being choked with work, and supplied an upright federal judiciary\r\nto certain districts where the local judges could not be depended upon\r\nto act honestly. On the other hand, the Federalists employed it as a\r\nmeans to keep themselves partly in power, after the nation had decided\r\nthat they should be turned out. Although the Democrats had bitterly\r\nopposed it, yet if, as was only right, the offices created by it had\r\nbeen left vacant until Jefferson came in, it would probably have been\r\nallowed to stand. But Adams, most improperly, spent the last hours of\r\nhis administration in putting in the new judges.\r\n\r\nMorris, who heartily championed the measure, wrote his reasons for so\r\ndoing to Livingstone; giving, with his usual frankness, those that were\r\npolitical and improper, as well as those based on some public policy,\r\nbut apparently not appreciating the gravity of the charges he so lightly\r\nadmitted. He said: \"The new judiciary bill may have, and doubtless has,\r\nmany little faults, but it answers the double purpose of bringing\r\njustice near to men's doors, and of giving additional fibre to the root\r\nof government. You must not, my friend, judge of other states by your\r\nown. Depend on it, that in some parts of this Union, justice cannot be\r\nreadily obtained in the state courts.\" So far, he was all right, and the\r\ntruth of his statements, and the soundness of his reasons, could not be\r\nchallenged as to the propriety of the law itself; but he was much less\r\nhappy in giving his views of the way in which it would be carried out:\r\n\"That the leaders of the federal party may use this opportunity to\r\nprovide for friends and adherents is, I think, probable; and if they\r\nwere my enemies, I should blame them for it. Whether I should do the\r\nsame thing myself is another question.... They are about to experience a\r\nheavy gale of adverse wind; can they be blamed for casting many anchors\r\nto hold their ship through the storm?\" Most certainly they should be\r\nblamed for casting this particular kind of anchor; it was a very gross\r\noutrage for them to \"provide for friends and adherents\" in such a\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe folly of their action was seen at once; for they had so maddened the\r\nDemocrats that the latter repealed the act as soon as they came into\r\npower. This also was of course all wrong, and was a simple sacrifice of\r\na measure of good government to partisan rage. Morris led the fight\r\nagainst it, deeming the repeal not only in the highest degree unwise\r\nbut also unconstitutional. After the repeal was accomplished, the\r\nknowledge that their greed to grasp office under the act was probably\r\nthe cause of the loss of an excellent law, must have been rather a\r\nbitter cud for the Federalists to chew. Morris always took an\r\nexaggerated view of the repeal, regarding it as a death-blow to the\r\nconstitution. It was certainly a most unfortunate affair throughout; and\r\nmuch of the blame attaches to the Federalists, although still more to\r\ntheir antagonists.\r\n\r\nThe absolute terror with which even moderate Federalists had viewed the\r\nvictory of the Democrats was in a certain sense justifiable; for the\r\nleaders who led the Democrats to triumph were the very men who had\r\nfought tooth and nail against every measure necessary to make us a free,\r\norderly, and powerful nation. But the safety of the nation really lay in\r\nthe very fact that the policy hitherto advocated by the now victorious\r\nparty had embodied principles so wholly absurd in practice that it was\r\nout of the question to apply them at all to the actual running of the\r\ngovernment. Jefferson could write or speak--and could feel too--the most\r\nhigh-sounding sentiments; but once it came to actions he was absolutely\r\nat sea, and on almost every matter--especially where he did well--he had\r\nto fall back on the Federalist theories. Almost the only important\r\npoint on which he allowed himself free scope was that of the national\r\ndefenses; and here, particularly as regards the navy, he worked very\r\nserious harm to the country. Otherwise he generally adopted and acted on\r\nthe views of his predecessors; as Morris said, the Democrats \"did more\r\nto strengthen the executive than Federalists dared think of, even in\r\nWashington's day.\" As a consequence, though the nation would certainly\r\nhave been better off if men like Adams or Pinckney had been retained at\r\nthe head of affairs, yet the change resulted in far less harm than it\r\nbade fair to.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the Federalists cut a very sorry figure in opposition.\r\nWe have never had another party so little able to stand adversity. They\r\nlost their temper first and they lost their principles next, and\r\nactually began to take up the heresies discarded by their adversaries.\r\nMorris himself, untrue to all his previous record, advanced various\r\nstates-rights doctrines; and the Federalists, the men who had created\r\nthe Union, ended their days under the grave suspicion of having desired\r\nto break it up. Morris even opposed, and on a close vote temporarily\r\ndefeated, the perfectly unobjectionable proposition to change the\r\nelectoral system by designating the candidates for President and\r\nVice-President; the reason he gave was that he believed parties should\r\nbe forced to nominate both of their best men, and that he regarded the\r\nJefferson-Burr tie as a beautiful object-lesson for teaching this point!\r\n\r\nOn one most important question, however, he cut loose from his party,\r\nwho were entirely in the wrong, and acted with the administration, who\r\nwere behaving in strict accordance with Federalist precepts. This was in\r\nreference to the treaty by which we acquired Louisiana.\r\n\r\nWhile in opposition, one of the most discreditable features of the\r\nRepublican-Democratic party had been its servile truckling to France,\r\nwhich at times drove it into open disloyalty to America. Indeed this\r\nsubservience to foreigners was a feature of our early party history; and\r\nthe most confirmed pessimist must admit that, as regards patriotism and\r\nindignant intolerance of foreign control, the party organizations of\r\nto-day are immeasurably superior to those of eighty or ninety years\r\nback. But it was only while in opposition that either party was ready to\r\nthrow itself into the arms of outsiders. Once the Democrats took the\r\nreins they immediately changed their attitude. The West demanded New\r\nOrleans and the valley of the Mississippi; and what it demanded it was\r\ndetermined to get. When we only had the decaying weakness of Spain to\r\ndeal with, there was no cause for hurry; but when Louisiana was ceded to\r\nFrance, at the time when the empire of Napoleon was a match for all the\r\nrest of the world put together, the country was up in arms at once.\r\n\r\nThe Administration promptly began to negotiate for the purchase of\r\nLouisiana. Morris backed them up heartily, thus splitting off from the\r\nbulk of the Federalists, and earnestly advocated far stronger measures\r\nthan had been taken. He believed that so soon as the French should\r\nestablish themselves in New Orleans, we should have a war with them; he\r\nknew it would be impossible for the haughty chiefs of a military\r\ndespotism long to avoid collisions with the reckless and warlike\r\nbackwoodsmen of the border. Nor would he have been sorry had such a war\r\ntaken place. He said that it was a necessity to us, for we were\r\ndwindling into a race of mere speculators and driveling philosophers,\r\nwhereas ten years of warfare would bring forth a crop of heroes and\r\nstatesmen, fit timber out of which to hew an empire.\r\n\r\nAlmost his last act in the United States Senate was to make a most\r\npowerful and telling speech in favor of at once occupying the territory\r\nin dispute, and bidding defiance to Napoleon. He showed that we could\r\nnot submit to having so dangerous a neighbor as France, an ambitious and\r\nconquering nation, at whose head was the greatest warrior of the age.\r\nWith ringing emphasis he claimed the western regions as peculiarly our\r\nheritage, as the property of the fathers of America which they held in\r\ntrust for their children. It was true that France was then enjoying the\r\npeace which she had wrung from the gathered armies of all Europe; yet he\r\nadvised us to fling down the gauntlet fearlessly, not hampering\r\nourselves by an attempt at alliance with Great Britain or any other\r\npower, but resting confident that, if America was heartily in earnest,\r\nshe would be able to hold her own in any struggle. The cost of the\r\nconquest he brushed contemptuously aside; he considered \"that\r\ncounting-house policy, which sees nothing but money, a poor,\r\nshort-sighted, half-witted, mean, and miserable thing, as far removed\r\nfrom wisdom as is a monkey from a man.\" He wished for peace; but he did\r\nnot believe the Emperor would yield us the territory, and he knew that\r\nhis fellow-representatives, and practically all the American people,\r\nwere determined to fight for it if they could get it in no other way;\r\ntherefore he advised them to begin at once, and gain forthwith what they\r\nwanted, and perhaps their example would inspirit Europe to rise against\r\nthe tyrant.\r\n\r\nIt was bold advice, and if need had arisen it would have been followed;\r\nfor we were bound to have Louisiana, if not by bargain and sale then by\r\nfair shock of arms. But Napoleon yielded, and gave us the land for\r\nfifteen millions, of which, said Morris, \"I am content to pay my share\r\nto deprive foreigners of all pretext for entering our interior country;\r\nif nothing else were gained by the treaty, that alone would satisfy me.\"\r\n\r\nMorris's term as senator expired on March 4th, 1803, and he was not\r\nreelected; for New York State had passed into the hands of the\r\nDemocrats. But he still continued to play a prominent part in public\r\naffairs, for he was the leader in starting the project of the Erie\r\ncanal. It was to him that we owe the original idea of this great\r\nwater-way, for he thought of it and planned it out long before any one\r\nelse. He had publicly proposed it during the revolutionary period; in\r\n1803 he began the agitation in its favor that culminated in its\r\nrealization, and he was chairman of the Canal Commissioners from the\r\ntime of their appointment, in 1810, until within a few months of his\r\ndeath. The three first reports of the Commission were all from his pen.\r\nAs Stephen Van Rensselaer, himself one of the commissioners from the\r\nbeginning, said, \"Gouverneur Morris was the father of our great canal.\"\r\nHe hoped ultimately to make it a ship canal. While a member of the\r\ncommission, he not only discharged his duties as such with\r\ncharacteristic energy and painstaking, but he also did most effective\r\noutside work in advancing the enterprise, while he mastered the subject\r\nmore thoroughly in all its details than did any other man.\r\n\r\nHe spent most of his time at Morrisania, but traveled for two or three\r\nmonths every summer, sometimes going out to the then \"far West,\" along\r\nthe shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario, and once descending the St.\r\nLawrence. At home he spent his time tilling his farm, reading, receiving\r\nvisits from his friends, and carrying on a wide correspondence on\r\nbusiness and politics. Jay's home was within driving distance, and the\r\ntwo fine old fellows saw much of each other. On the 25th of December,\r\n1809, Morris, then fifty-six years old, married Miss Anne Cary Randolph,\r\na member of the famous Virginia family; he was very happy with her, and\r\nby her he had one son. Three weeks after the marriage he wrote Jay a\r\npressing request to visit him: \"I pray you will, with your daughters,\r\nembark immediately in your sleigh, after a very early breakfast, and\r\npush on so as to reach this house in the evening. My wife sends her\r\nlove, and says she longs to receive her husband's friend; that his\r\nsickness must be no excuse, for she will nurse him. Come, then, and see\r\nyour old friend perform his part in an old-fashioned scene of domestic\r\nenjoyment.\" Jay was very simple in his way of living; but Morris was\r\nrather formal. When he visited his friend he always came with his valet,\r\nwas shown straight to his room without seeing any one, dressed himself\r\nwith scrupulous nicety,--being very particular about his powdered\r\nhair,--and then came down to see his host.\r\n\r\nAlthough his letters generally dealt with public matters, he sometimes\r\nwent into home details. He thus wrote an amusing letter to a good friend\r\nof his, a lady, who was desirous, following the custom of the day, to\r\nsend her boy to what was called a \"college\" at an absurdly early age; he\r\nclosed by warning her that \"these children of eleven, after a four\r\nyears' course, in which they may learn to smatter a little of\r\neverything, become bachelors of arts before they know how to button\r\ntheir clothes, and are the most troublesome and useless, sometimes the\r\nmost pernicious, little animals that ever infested a commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nAt one time he received as his guest Moreau, the exiled French general,\r\nthen seeking service in the United States. Writing in his diary an\r\naccount of the visit, he says: \"In the course of our conversation,\r\ntouching very gently the idea of his serving (in case of necessity)\r\nagainst France, he declares frankly that, when the occasion arrives, he\r\nshall feel no reluctance; that France having cast him out, he is a\r\ncitizen of the country where he lives, and has the same right to follow\r\nhis trade here as any other man.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the keenest pleasure in his life, and always insisted that\r\nAmerica was the pleasantest of all places in which to live. Writing to a\r\nfriend abroad, and mentioning that he respected the people of Britain,\r\nbut did not find them congenial, he added: \"But were the manners of\r\nthose countries as pleasant as the people are respectable, I should\r\nnever be reconciled to their summers. Compare the uninterrupted warmth\r\nand splendor of America, from the first of May to the last of September,\r\nand her autumn, truly celestial, with your shivering June, your July and\r\nAugust sometimes warm but often wet, your uncertain September, your\r\ngloomy October, and your dismal November. Compare these things, and then\r\nsay how a man who prizes the charm of Nature can think of making the\r\nexchange. If you were to pass one autumn with us, you would not give it\r\nfor the best six months to be found in any other country.... There is a\r\nbrilliance in our atmosphere of which you can have no idea.\"\r\n\r\nHe thoroughly appreciated the marvelous future that lay before the race\r\non this continent. Writing in 1801, he says: \"As yet we only crawl along\r\nthe outer shell of our country. The interior excels the part we inhabit\r\nin soil, in climate, in everything. The proudest empire in Europe is but\r\na bauble compared to what America _will_ be, _must_ be, in the course of\r\ntwo centuries, perhaps of one!\" And again, \"With respect to this\r\ncountry, calculation outruns fancy, and fact outruns calculation.\"\r\n\r\nUntil his hasty, impulsive temper became so soured by partisanship as to\r\nwarp his judgment, Morris remained as well satisfied with the people and\r\nthe system of government as with the land itself. In one of his first\r\nletters after his return to America he wrote: \"There is a fund of good\r\nsense and calmness of character here, which will, I think, avoid all\r\ndangerous excesses. We are free: we know it: and we know how to continue\r\nfree.\" On another occasion, about the same time, he said: \"_Nil\r\ndesperandum de republica_ is a sound principle.\" Again, in the middle of\r\nJefferson's first term: \"We have indeed a set of madmen in the\r\nadministration, and they will do many foolish things; but there is a\r\nvigorous vegetative principle at the root which will make our tree\r\nflourish, let the winds blow as they may.\"\r\n\r\nHe at first took an equally just view of our political system, saying\r\nthat in adopting a republican form of government he \"not only took it,\r\nas a man does his wife, for better or worse, but, what few men do with\r\ntheir wives, knowing all its bad qualities.\" He observed that there was\r\nalways a counter current in human affairs, which opposed alike good and\r\nevil. \"Thus the good we hope is seldom attained, and the evil we fear is\r\nrarely realized. The leaders of faction must for their own sakes avoid\r\nerrors of enormous magnitude; so that, while the republican form lasts,\r\nwe shall be fairly well governed.\" He thought this form the one best\r\nsuited for us, and remarked that \"every kind of government was liable to\r\nevil; that the best was that which had fewest faults; that the\r\nexcellence even of that best depended more on its fitness for the nation\r\nwhere it was established than on intrinsic perfection.\" He denounced,\r\nwith a fierce scorn that they richly merit, the despicable demagogues\r\nand witless fools who teach that in all cases the voice of the majority\r\nmust be implicitly obeyed, and that public men have only to carry out\r\nits will, and thus \"acknowledge themselves the willing instruments of\r\nfolly and vice. They declare that in order to please the people they\r\nwill, regardless alike of what conscience may dictate or reason approve,\r\nmake the profligate sacrifice of public right on the altar of private\r\ninterest. What more can be asked by the sternest tyrant of the most\r\ndespicable slave? Creatures of this sort are the tools which usurpers\r\nemploy in building despotism.\"\r\n\r\nSounder and truer maxims never were uttered; but unfortunately the\r\nindignation naturally excited by the utter weakness and folly of\r\nJefferson's second term, and the pitiable incompetence shown both by\r\nhim, by his successor, and by their party associates in dealing with\r\naffairs, so inflamed and exasperated Morris as to make him completely\r\nlose his head, and hurried him into an opposition so violent that his\r\nfollies surpassed the worst of the follies he condemned. He gradually\r\nlost faith in our republican system, and in the Union itself. His old\r\njealousy of the West revived more strongly than ever; he actually\r\nproposed that our enormous masses of new territory, destined one day to\r\nhold the bulk of our population, \"should be governed as provinces, and\r\nallowed no voice in our councils.\" So hopelessly futile a scheme is\r\nbeneath comment; and it cannot possibly be reconciled with his previous\r\nutterances when he descanted on our future greatness as a people, and\r\nclaimed the West as the heritage of our children. His conduct can only\r\nbe unqualifiedly condemned; and he has but the poor palliation that, in\r\nour early history, many of the leading men in New York, and an even\r\nlarger proportion in New England, felt the same narrow, illiberal\r\njealousy of the West which had formerly been felt by the English\r\nstatesmen for America as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt is well indeed for our land that we of this generation have at last\r\nlearned to think nationally, and, no matter in what state we live, to\r\nview our whole country with the pride of personal possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN DISUNION MOVEMENT AMONG THE FEDERALISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a painful thing to have to record that the closing act in a great\r\nstatesman's career not only compares ill with what went before, but is\r\nactually to the last degree a discreditable and unworthy performance.\r\n\r\nMorris's bitterness and anger against the government grew apace; and\r\nfinally his hatred for the administration became such, that, to hurt it,\r\nhe was willing also to do irreparable harm to the nation itself. He\r\nviolently opposed the various embargo acts, and all the other\r\ngovernmental measures of the decade before the war; and worked himself\r\nup to such a pitch, when hostilities began, that, though one of the\r\nfounders of the Constitution, though formerly one of the chief exponents\r\nof the national idea, and though once a main upholder of the Union, he\r\nabandoned every patriotic principle and became an ardent advocate of\r\nNorthern secession.\r\n\r\nTo any reasoning student of American history it goes without saying that\r\nthere was very good cause for his anger with the administration. From\r\nthe time the House of Virginia came into power, until the beginning of\r\nMonroe's administration, there was a distinctly anti-New England feeling\r\nat Washington, and much of the legislation bore especially heavily on\r\nthe Northeast. Excepting Jefferson, we have never produced an executive\r\nmore helpless than Madison, when it came to grappling with real dangers\r\nand difficulties. Like his predecessor, he was only fit to be President\r\nin a time of profound peace; he was utterly out of place the instant\r\nmatters grew turbulent, or difficult problems arose to be solved, and he\r\nwas a ridiculously incompetent leader for a war with Great Britain. He\r\nwas entirely too timid to have embarked on such a venture of his own\r\naccord, and was simply forced into it by the threat of losing his second\r\nterm. The fiery young Democrats of the South and West, and their\r\nbrothers of the Middle States, were the authors of the war; they\r\nthemselves, for all their bluster, were but one shade less incompetent\r\nthan their nominal chief, when it came to actual work, and were\r\nshamefully unable to make their words good by deeds.\r\n\r\nThe administration thus drifted into a war which it had neither the\r\nwisdom to avoid, nor the forethought to prepare for. In view of the fact\r\nthat the war was their own, it is impossible to condemn sufficiently\r\nstrongly the incredible folly of the Democrats in having all along\r\nrefused to build a navy or provide any other adequate means of defense.\r\nIn accordance with their curiously foolish theories, they persisted in\r\nrelying on that weakest of all weak reeds, the militia, who promptly ran\r\naway every time they faced a foe in the open. This applied to all,\r\nwhether eastern, western, or southern; the men of the northern states in\r\n1812 and 1813 did as badly as, and no worse than, the Virginians in\r\n1814. Indeed, one of the good results of the war was that it did away\r\nforever with all reliance on the old-time militia, the most expensive\r\nand inefficient species of soldiery that could be invented. During the\r\nfirst year the monotonous record of humiliations and defeats was only\r\nrelieved by the splendid victories of the navy which the Federalists had\r\ncreated twelve years previously, and which had been hurt rather than\r\nbenefited in the intervening time. Gradually, however, the people\r\nthemselves began to bring out leaders: two, Jackson and Scott, were\r\nreally good generals, under whom our soldiers became able to face even\r\nthe English regulars, then the most formidable fighting troops in the\r\nworld; and it must be remembered that Jackson won his fights absolutely\r\nunhelped by the administration. In fact, the government at Washington\r\ndoes not deserve one shred of credit for any of the victories we won,\r\nalthough to it we directly owe the greater number of our defeats.\r\n\r\nGranting, however, all that can be said as to the hopeless inefficiency\r\nof the administration, both in making ready for and in waging the war,\r\nit yet remains true that the war itself was eminently justifiable, and\r\nwas of the greatest service to the nation. We had been bullied by\r\nEngland and France until we had to fight to preserve our national\r\nself-respect; and we very properly singled out our chief aggressor,\r\nthough it would perhaps have been better still to have acted on the\r\nproposition advanced in Congress, and to have declared war on both.\r\nAlthough nominally the peace left things as they had been, practically\r\nwe gained our point; and we certainly came out of the contest with a\r\ngreatly increased reputation abroad. In spite of the ludicrous series of\r\nfailures which began with our first attempt to invade Canada, and\r\nculminated at Bladensburg, yet in a succession of contests on the ocean\r\nand the lakes, we shattered the charmed shield of British naval\r\ninvincibility; while on the northern frontier we developed under Scott\r\nand Brown an infantry which, unlike any of the armies of continental\r\nEurope, was able to meet on equal terms the British infantry in pitched\r\nbattle in the open; and at New Orleans we did what the best of\r\nNapoleon's marshals, backed by the flower of the French soldiers, had\r\nbeen unable to accomplish during five years of warfare in Spain, and\r\ninflicted a defeat such as no English army had suffered during a quarter\r\nof a century of unbroken warfare. Above all, the contest gave an immense\r\nimpetus to our national feeling, and freed our politics forever from any\r\ndependence on those of a foreign power.\r\n\r\nThe war was distinctly worth fighting, and resulted in good to the\r\ncountry. The blame that attaches to Madison and the elder\r\ndemocratic-republican leaders, as well as to their younger associates,\r\nClay, Calhoun, and the rest, who fairly flogged them into action,\r\nrelates to their utter failure to make any preparations for the contest,\r\nto their helpless inability to carry it on, and to the extraordinary\r\nweakness and indecision of their policy throughout; and on all these\r\npoints it is hardly possible to visit them with too unsparing censure.\r\n\r\nYet, grave though these faults were, they were mild compared to those\r\ncommitted by Morris and the other ultra-Federalists of New York and New\r\nEngland. Morris's opposition to the war led him to the most extravagant\r\nlengths. In his hatred of the opposite party he lost all loyalty to the\r\nnation. He championed the British view of their right to impress seamen\r\nfrom our ships; he approved of peace on the terms they offered, which\r\nincluded a curtailment of our western frontier, and the erection along\r\nit of independent Indian sovereignties under British protection. He\r\nfound space in his letters to exult over the defeats of Bonaparte, but\r\ncould spare no word of praise for our own victories.\r\n\r\nHe actually advocated repudiating our war debt,[3] on the ground that it\r\nwas void, being founded on a moral wrong; and he wished the Federalists\r\nto make public profession of their purpose, so that when they should\r\ncome back to power, the holders might have no reason to complain that\r\nthere had been no warning of their intention. To Josiah Quincy, on May\r\n15th, he wrote: \"Should it be objected, as it probably will to favor\r\nlenders and their associates, that public faith is pledged, it may be\r\nreplied that a pledge wickedly given is not to be redeemed.\" He thus\r\nadvanced the theory that in a government ruled by parties, which come\r\ninto power alternately, any debt could be repudiated, at any time, if\r\nthe party in power happened to disapprove of its originally being\r\nincurred. No greenback demagogue of the lowest type ever advocated a\r\nproposition more dishonest or more contemptible.\r\n\r\n[3] As, for instance, in a letter to David R. Ogden, April 5, 1813.\r\n\r\nHe wrote that he agreed with Pickering that it was impious to raise\r\ntaxes for so unjust a war. He endeavored, fortunately in vain, to induce\r\nRufus King in the Senate to advocate the refusal of supplies of every\r\nsort, whether of men or money, for carrying on the war; but King was far\r\ntoo honorable to turn traitor. Singularly forgetful of his speeches in\r\nthe Senate ten years before, he declared that he wished that a foreign\r\npower might occupy and people the West, so as, by outside pressure, to\r\nstifle our feuds. He sneered at the words union and constitution, as\r\nbeing meaningless. He railed bitterly at the honest and loyal majority\r\nof his fellow-Federalists in New York, who had professed their devotion\r\nto the Union; and in a letter of April 29th, to Harrison Gray Otis,--who\r\nwas almost as bad as himself,--he strongly advocated secession, writing\r\namong other things that he wished the New York Federalists to declare\r\npublicly that \"the Union, being the means of freedom, should be prized\r\nas such, but that the end should not be sacrificed to the means.\" By\r\ncomparing this with Calhoun's famous toast at the Jefferson birthday\r\ndinner in 1880, \"The Union; next to our liberty the most dear; may we\r\nall remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of\r\nthe states and distributing equally the benefit and the burden of the\r\nUnion,\" it can be seen how completely Morris's utterances went on all\r\nfours with those of the great nullifier.\r\n\r\nTo Pickering he wrote, on October 17th, 1814: \"I hear every day\r\nprofessions of attachment to the Union, and declarations as to its\r\nimportance. I should be glad to meet with some one who could tell me\r\nwhat has become of the Union, in what it consists, and to what useful\r\npurpose it endures.\" He regarded the dissolution of the Union to be so\r\nnearly an accomplished fact that the only question was whether the\r\nboundary should be \"the Delaware, the Susquehanna, or the Potomac\"; for\r\nhe thought that New York would have to go with New England. He nourished\r\ngreat hopes of the Hartford convention, which he expected would formally\r\ncome out for secession; he wrote Otis that the convention should declare\r\nthat the Union was already broken, and that all that remained to do was\r\nto take action for the preservation of the interests of the Northeast.\r\nHe was much chagrined when the convention fell under the control of\r\nCabot and the moderates. As late as January 10, 1815, he wrote that the\r\nonly proceeding from which the people of his section would gain\r\npractical benefit would be a \"severance of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, throughout the war of 1812 he appeared as the open champion of\r\ntreason to the nation, of dishonesty to the nation's creditors, and of\r\ncringing subserviency to a foreign power. It is as impossible to\r\nreconcile his course with his previous career and teachings as it is to\r\ntry to make it square with the rules of statesmanship and morality. His\r\nown conduct affords a conclusive condemnation of his theories as to the\r\ngreat inferiority of a government conducted by the multitude, to a\r\ngovernment conducted by the few who should have riches and education.\r\nUndoubtedly he was one of these few; he was an exceptionally able man,\r\nand a wealthy one; but he went farther wrong at this period than the\r\nmajority of our people--the \"mob\" as he would have contemptuously called\r\nthem--have ever gone at any time; for though every state in turn, and\r\nalmost every statesman, has been wrong upon some issue or another, yet\r\nin the long run the bulk of the people have always hitherto shown\r\nthemselves true to the cause of right. Morris strenuously insisted upon\r\nthe need of property being defended from the masses; yet he advocated\r\nrepudiation of the national debt, which he should have known to be quite\r\nas dishonest as the repudiation of his individual liabilities, and he\r\nwas certainly aware that the step is a short one between refusing to pay\r\na man what _ought_ to be his and taking away from him what actually _is_\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nThere were many other Federalist leaders in the same position as\r\nhimself, especially in the three southern New England states, where the\r\nwhole Federalist party laid itself open to the gravest charges of\r\ndisloyalty. Morris was not alone in his creed at this time. On the\r\ncontrary, his position is interesting because it is typical of that\r\nassumed by a large section of his party throughout the Northeast. In\r\nfact, the Federalists in this portion of the Union had split in three,\r\nalthough the lines of cleavage were not always well marked. Many of them\r\nremained heartily loyal to the national idea; the bulk hesitated as to\r\nwhether they should go all lengths or not; while a large and influential\r\nminority, headed by Morris, Pickering, Quincy, Lowell and others, were\r\navowed disunionists. Had peace not come when it did, it is probable that\r\nthe moderates would finally have fallen under the control of these\r\nultras. The party developed an element of bitter unreason in defeat; it\r\nwas a really sad sight to see a body of able, educated men, interested\r\nand skilled in the conduct of public affairs, all going angrily and\r\nstupidly wrong on the one question that was of vital concern to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to try to justify the proceedings of the Hartford convention,\r\nor of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislatures. The decision to\r\nkeep the New England troops as an independent command was of itself\r\nsufficient ground for condemnation; moreover, it was not warranted by\r\nany show of superior prowess on the part of the New Englanders, for a\r\nportion of Maine continued in possession of the British till the close\r\nof the war. The Hartford resolutions were so framed as to justify\r\nseceding or not seceding as events turned out; a man like Morris could\r\nextract comfort from them, while it was hoped they would not frighten\r\nthose who were more loyal. The majority of the people in New England\r\nwere beyond question loyal, exactly as in 1860 a majority of Southerners\r\nwere opposed to secession; but the disloyal element was active and\r\nresolute, and hoped to force the remainder into its own way of thinking.\r\nIt failed signally, and was buried beneath a load of disgrace; and New\r\nEngland was taught thus early and by heart the lesson that wrongs must\r\nbe righted within, and not without the Union. It would have been well\r\nfor her sister section of the South, so loyal in 1815, if forty-five\r\nyears afterwards she had spared herself the necessity of learning the\r\nsame lesson at an infinitely greater cost.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that it is nonsense to reproach any one section with being\r\nespecially disloyal to the Union. At one time or another almost every\r\nstate has shown strong particularistic leanings; Connecticut and\r\nPennsylvania, for example, quite as much as Virginia or Kentucky.\r\nFortunately the outbursts were never simultaneous in a majority. It is\r\nas impossible to question the fact that at one period or another of the\r\npast, many of the states in each section have been very shaky in their\r\nallegiance as it is to doubt that they are now all heartily loyal. The\r\nsecession movement of 1860 was pushed to extremities, instead of being\r\nmerely planned and threatened, and the revolt was peculiarly abhorrent,\r\nbecause of the intention to make slavery the \"corner-stone\" of the new\r\nnation, and to reintroduce the slave-trade, to the certain ultimate ruin\r\nof the Southern whites; but at least it was entirely free from the\r\nmeanness of being made in the midst of a doubtful struggle with a\r\nforeign foe. Indeed, in this respect the ultra-Federalists of New York\r\nand New England in 1814 should be compared with the infamous Northern\r\ncopperheads of the Vallandigham stripe rather than with the gallant\r\nconfederates who risked and lost all in fighting for the cause of their\r\nchoice. Half a century before the \"stars and bars\" waved over Lee's last\r\nintrenchments, perfervid New England patriots were fond of flaunting\r\n\"the flag with five stripes,\" and drinking to the health of\r\nthe--fortunately stillborn--new nation. Later on, the disunion movement\r\namong the Northern abolitionists, headed by Garrison, was perhaps the\r\nmost absolutely senseless of all, for its success meant the immediate\r\nabandonment of every hope of abolition.\r\n\r\nIn each one of these movements men of the highest character and capacity\r\ntook part. Morris had by previous services rendered the whole nation his\r\ndebtor; Garrison was one of the little band who, in the midst of general\r\napathy, selfishness, and cowardice, dared to demand the cutting out of\r\nthe hideous plague spot of our civilization; while Lee and Jackson were\r\nas remarkable for stainless purity and high-mindedness as they were for\r\ntheir consummate military skill. But the disunion movements in which\r\nthey severally took part were wholly wrong. An Englishman of to-day may\r\nbe equally proud of the valor of Cavalier and Roundhead; but, if\r\ncompetent to judge, he must admit that the Roundhead was right. So it is\r\nwith us. The man who fought for secession warred for a cause as evil and\r\nas capable of working lasting harm as the doctrine of the divine right\r\nof kings itself. But we may feel an intense pride in his gallantry; and\r\nwe may believe in his honesty as heartily as we believe in that of the\r\nonly less foolish being who wishes to see our government strongly\r\ncentralized, heedless of the self-evident fact that over such a vast\r\nland as ours the nation can exist only as a Federal Union; and that,\r\nexactly as the liberty of the individual and the rights of the states\r\ncan only be preserved by upholding the strength of the nation, so this\r\nsame localizing of power in all matters not essentially national is\r\nvital to the wellbeing and durability of the government.\r\n\r\nBesides the honorable men drawn into such movements there have always\r\nbeen plenty who took part in or directed them for their own selfish\r\nends, or whose minds were so warped and their sense of political\r\nmorality so crooked as to make them originate schemes that would have\r\nreduced us to the impotent level of the Spanish-American republics.\r\nThese men were peculiar to neither section. In 1803, Aaron Burr of New\r\nYork was undoubtedly anxious to bring about in the Northeast[4] what\r\nsixty years later Jefferson Davis of Mississippi so nearly succeeded in\r\ndoing in the South; and the attempt in the South to make a hero of the\r\none is as foolish as it would be to make a hero of the other in the\r\nNorth. If there are such virtues as loyalty and patriotism, then there\r\nmust exist the corresponding crime of treason; if there is any merit in\r\npracticing the first, then there must be equal demerit in committing the\r\nlast. Emasculated sentimentalists may try to strike from the national\r\ndictionary the word treason; but until that is done, Jefferson Davis\r\nmust be deemed guilty thereof.\r\n\r\n[4] People sometimes forget that Burr was as willing to try sedition in\r\nthe East as in the West.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, very few of our statesmen whose characters can be\r\npainted in simple, uniform colors, like Washington and Lincoln on the\r\none hand, or Burr and Davis on the other. Nor is Morris one of these\r\nfew. His place is alongside of men like Madison, Samuel Adams, and\r\nPatrick Henry, who did the nation great service at times, but each of\r\nwhom, at some one or two critical junctures, ranged himself with the\r\nforces of disorder.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace Morris accommodated himself to the altered condition\r\nwith his usual buoyant cheerfulness; he was too light-hearted, and, to\r\nsay the truth, had too good an opinion of himself, to be cast down even\r\nby the signal failure of his expectations and the memory of the by no\r\nmeans creditable part he had played. Besides, he had the great virtue of\r\nalways good-humoredly yielding to the inevitable. He heartily wished the\r\ncountry well, and kept up a constant correspondence with men high in\r\ninfluence at Washington. He disliked the tariff bill of 1816; he did not\r\nbelieve in duties or imposts, favoring internal, although not direct,\r\ntaxation. He was sharp-sighted enough to see that the Federal party had\r\nshot its bolt and outlived its usefulness, and that it was time for it\r\nto dissolve. To a number of Federalists at Philadelphia, who wished to\r\ncontinue the organization, he wrote strongly advising them to give up\r\nthe idea, and adding some very sound and patriotic counsel. \"Let us\r\nforget party and think of our country. That country embraces both\r\nparties. We must endeavor, therefore, to save and benefit both. This\r\ncannot be effected while political delusions array good men against each\r\nother. If you abandon the contest, the voice of reason, now drowned in\r\nfactious vociferation, will be listened to and heard. The pressure of\r\ndistress will accelerate the moment of reflection; and when it arrives\r\nthe people will look out for men of sense, experience, and integrity.\r\nSuch men may, I trust, be found in both parties; and if our country be\r\ndelivered, what does it signify whether those who operate her salvation\r\nwear a federal or democratic cloak?\" These words formed almost his last\r\npublic utterance, for they were penned but a couple of months before his\r\ndeath; and he might well be content to let them stand as a fit closing\r\nto his public career.\r\n\r\nHe died November 6, 1816, when sixty-four years old, after a short\r\nillness. He had suffered at intervals for a long time from gout; but he\r\nhad enjoyed general good health, as his erect, commanding, well-built\r\nfigure showed; for he was a tall and handsome man. He was buried on his\r\nown estate at Morrisania.\r\n\r\nThere has never been an American statesman of keener intellect or more\r\nbrilliant genius. Had he possessed but a little more steadiness and\r\nself-control he would have stood among the two or three very foremost.\r\nHe was gallant and fearless. He was absolutely upright and truthful; the\r\nleast suggestion of falsehood was abhorrent to him. His extreme,\r\naggressive frankness, joined to a certain imperiousness of disposition,\r\nmade it difficult for him to get along well with many of the men with\r\nwhom he was thrown in contact. In politics he was too much of a free\r\nlance ever to stand very high as a leader. He was very generous and\r\nhospitable; he was witty and humorous, a charming companion, and\r\nextremely fond of good living. He had a proud, almost hasty temper, and\r\nwas quick to resent an insult. He was strictly just; and he made open\r\nwar on all traits that displeased him, especially meanness and\r\nhypocrisy. He was essentially a strong man, and he was an American\r\nthrough and through.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his greatest interest for us lies in the fact that he was a\r\nshrewder, more far-seeing observer and recorder of contemporary men and\r\nevents, both at home and abroad, than any other American or foreign\r\nstatesman of his time. But aside from this he did much lasting work. He\r\ntook a most prominent part in bringing about the independence of the\r\ncolonies, and afterwards in welding them into a single powerful nation,\r\nwhose greatness he both foresaw and foretold. He made the final draft of\r\nthe United States Constitution; he first outlined our present system of\r\nnational coinage; he originated and got under way the plan for the Erie\r\nCanal; as minister to France he successfully performed the most\r\ndifficult task ever allotted to an American representative at a foreign\r\ncapital. With all his faults, there are few men of his generation to\r\nwhom the country owes more than to Gouverneur Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adams, John, 52;\r\n    appointed

That Mr. Morse's conclusions will in the main be\r\nthose of posterity we have very little doubt, and he has set an\r\nadmirable example to his coadjutors in respect of interesting narrative,\r\njust proportion, and judicial candor.--_New York Evening Post_.\r\n\r\n_HAMILTON_. The biography of Mr. Lodge is calm and dignified throughout.\r\nHe has the virtue--rare indeed among biographers--of impartiality. He\r\nhas done his work with conscientious care, and the biography of Hamilton\r\nis a book which cannot have too many readers. It is more than a\r\nbiography; it is a study in the science of government.--_St. Paul\r\nPioneer-Press_.\r\n\r\n_CALHOUN_. Nothing can exceed the skill with which the political career\r\nof the great South Carolinian is portrayed in these pages. The work is\r\nsuperior to any other number of the series thus far, and we do not think\r\nit can be surpassed by any of those that are to come. The whole\r\ndiscussion in relation to Calhoun's position is eminently philosophical\r\nand just.--_The Dial_ (Chicago).\r\n\r\n_JACKSON_. Professor Sumner has ... all in all, made the justest long\r\nestimate of Jackson that has had itself put between the covers of a\r\nbook.--_New York Times_.\r\n\r\n_RANDOLPH_. The book has been to me intensely interesting.... It is rich\r\nin new facts and side lights, and is worthy of its place in the already\r\nbrilliant series of monographs on American Statesmen.--Prof. MOSES COIT\r\nTYLER.\r\n\r\n_MONROE_. In clearness of style, and in all points of literary\r\nworkmanship, from cover to cover, the volume is well-nigh perfect. There\r\nare also a calmness of judgment, a correctness of taste, and an absence\r\nof partisanship which are too frequently wanting in biographies, and\r\nespecially in political biographies.--_American Literary Churchman_\r\n(Baltimore).\r\n\r\n_JEFFERSON_. The book is exceedingly interesting and readable. The\r\nattention of the reader is strongly seized at once, and he is carried\r\nalong in spite of himself, sometimes protesting, sometimes doubting, yet\r\nunable to lay the book down.--_Chicago Standard_.\r\n\r\n_WEBSTER_. It will be read by students of history; it will be invaluable\r\nas a work of reference; it will be an authority as regards matters of\r\nfact and criticism; it hits the keynote of Webster's durable and\r\never-growing fame; it is adequate, calm, impartial; it is\r\nadmirable.--_Philadelphia Press_.\r\n\r\n_GALLATIN_. It is one of the most carefully prepared of these very\r\nvaluable volumes, ... abounding in information not so readily accessible\r\nas is that pertaining to men more often treated by the biographer....\r\nThe whole work covers a ground which the political student cannot afford\r\nto neglect.--_Boston Correspondent Hartford Courant_.\r\n\r\n_MADISON_. The execution of the work deserves the highest praise. It is\r\nvery readable, in a bright and vigorous style, and is marked by unity\r\nand consecutiveness of plan.--_The Nation_ (New York).\r\n\r\n_JOHN ADAMS_. A good piece of literary work.... It covers the ground\r\nthoroughly, and gives just the sort of simple and succinct account that\r\nis wanted.--_Evening Post_ (New York).\r\n\r\n_MARSHALL_. Well done, with simplicity, clearness, precision, and\r\njudgment, and in a spirit of moderation and equity. A valuable addition\r\nto the series.--_New York Tribune_.\r\n\r\n_SAMUEL ADAMS_. Thoroughly appreciative and sympathetic, yet fair and\r\ncritical.... This biography is a piece of good work--a clear and simple\r\npresentation of a noble man and pure patriot; it is written in a spirit\r\nof candor and humanity.--_Worcester Spy_.\r\n\r\n_BENTON_. An interesting addition to our political literature, and will\r\nbe of great service if it spread an admiration for that austere public\r\nmorality which was one of the marked characteristics of its chief\r\nfigure.--_The Epoch_ (New York).\r\n\r\n_CLAY_. We have in this life of Henry Clay a biography of one of the\r\nmost distinguished of American statesmen, and a political history of the\r\nUnited States for the first half of the nineteenth century. In each of\r\nthese important and difficult undertakings, Mr. Schurz has been\r\neminently successful. Indeed, it is not too much to say that, for the\r\nperiod covered, we have no other book which equals or begins to equal\r\nthis life of Henry Clay as an introduction to the study of American\r\npolitics.--_Political Science Quarterly_ (New York).\r\n\r\n_HENRY_. Professor Tyler has not only made one of the best and most\r\nreadable of American biographies; he may fairly be said to have\r\nreconstructed the life of Patrick Henry, and to have vindicated the\r\nmemory of that great man from the unappreciative and injurious estimate\r\nwhich has been placed upon it.--_New York Evening Post_.\r\n\r\n_MORRIS_. Mr. Roosevelt has produced an animated and intensely\r\ninteresting biographical volume.... Mr. Roosevelt never loses sight of\r\nthe picturesque background of politics, war-governments, and\r\ndiplomacy.--_Magazine of American History_ (New York).\r\n\r\n_VAN BUREN_. No more generous, appreciative, or just biography, and no\r\nmore interesting or philosophical piece of political history has\r\nappeared in this valuable series ... than this absorbing book.... To\r\ngive any adequate idea of the personal interest of the book, or its\r\nintimate bearing on nearly the whole course of our political history\r\nwould be equivalent to quoting the larger part of it.--_Brooklyn Eagle_.\r\n\r\n_WASHINGTON_. Mr. Lodge has written an admirable biography, and one\r\nwhich cannot but confirm the American people in the prevailing estimate\r\nconcerning the Father of his Country; but its deepest and most important\r\nsignificance appears to us to consist in its testimony to the exaltation\r\nand the uniqueness of a character whose like comes seldom to the world,\r\nand only in periods of great stress and crisis.--_New York Tribune_.\r\n\r\n_FRANKLIN_. He has managed to condense the whole mass of matter gleaned\r\nfrom all sources into his volume without losing in a single sentence the\r\nfreedom or lightness of his style or giving his book in any part the\r\ncrowded look of an epitome. He has plenty of time and plenty of room for\r\nall he wishes to say, and says it in the very best and most interesting\r\nmanner.--_The Independent_ (New York).\r\n\r\n\r\n*** _For sale by all Booksellers.
