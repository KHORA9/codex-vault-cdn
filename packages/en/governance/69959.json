The keynote of woman’s long struggle for\r\nthe ballot has been her ardent desire for service. Now that she has\r\nbeen given the vote, she is eager to learn how she can best render\r\nthat service.\r\n\r\nCitizenship has been very lightly regarded by our country in the\r\npast. It has been given to the immigrant without any ceremony, in the\r\nmidst of the sordid surroundings of a local court-room; it has come\r\nto the boy of twenty-one without any special preparation on his part;\r\nit has often been bought and sold. It remains now for women to treat\r\nit with a new dignity and to give it the importance it deserves.\r\n\r\nCivics should be taught in every school in the land. The ballot\r\nshould be regarded as a sacred trust. Every man and woman who grows\r\nup under the protection of our flag should feel the obligation to\r\ngive of his and her best to make our democracy a better expression of\r\nour ideals.\r\n\r\nI hope that this book will help to start some new citizens in the\r\nright way.\r\n\r\n  CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere never seems to be just the right book on a topic that one has\r\nvery much at heart.\r\n\r\nWhen the vote for New York women was an accomplished fact there came\r\na sudden and pressing need for a book on government that would give\r\nthe busy housewife or the overworked woman in the factory the simple\r\noutline of her government and the officials for whom she was going\r\nto vote, with the duties and requirements of their positions; but\r\nthat was not all. There are certain problems of government to-day\r\nand certain departments of politics which have to do with things\r\nwhich are of special interest to women. The protection and care of\r\nhuman life has always been woman’s great business in life. So a book\r\non civics for women must include an outline of what the state is\r\ndoing for its children, for its poor, for working-women, for public\r\nhealth and recreation; in short, for the same things in government\r\nwith which she is concerned in her individual capacity as a woman.\r\nThese are also the departments of government which seem to need her\r\nattention the most. It is natural that men should have given the\r\ngreater care in government to business and material affairs. To\r\ncounterbalance this, woman’s work and votes are needed for the human\r\nside.\r\n\r\nTo be an intelligent voter some knowledge of the structure of\r\ngovernment is needed. Also one must know the duties of an office\r\nin order to judge of the qualifications of would-be candidates, so\r\nChapters II to VII give an outline of the different divisions of\r\ngovernment, beginning with the local offices, for which women will\r\ncast their first votes, and going through the State to the National\r\nGovernment. Chapters VII to X, inclusive, deal with the actual\r\ncasting of the ballot in the elections, the organization of political\r\nparties, and the management of elections. The major part of the book\r\nis then given to those departments of political affairs in which\r\nwomen are undoubtedly most deeply concerned.\r\n\r\nThe substance of some of these chapters has been used as a\r\ncorrespondence course in citizenship by the New York State Woman\r\nSuffrage Party, and is published by special arrangement with them.\r\nThrough four years of continuous intensive educational work in the\r\nState the Woman Suffrage Party has come closely in touch with many\r\nthousands of women; it has learned to know their idealism, their\r\nfervent belief in democracy, and their desire to make democracy more\r\neffective. It knows also that there are many other women who have\r\nnever thought about voting, but who are equally conscientious and are\r\nnow eager to learn. It knows the problems of women as does probably\r\nno other organization of women.\r\n\r\nIt also has a deep feeling of responsibility. It feels its obligation\r\nto furnish all the help possible to the new women voters to meet\r\ntheir new duties wisely. It hopes to bring home to women the human\r\nside of government, to arouse a desire for further study, and\r\nespecially to encourage them to regard their vote as a trust to be\r\nused not to advance partisan politics, but to further human welfare.\r\n\r\nThis is a book for amateur citizens written by an amateur citizen.\r\nIt may be found to differ from the others in that it deals with the\r\nsubject of civics from the standpoint of the woman voter.\r\n\r\n  GERTRUDE FOSTER BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=YOUR VOTE AND HOW TO USE IT=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR VOTE AND HOW TO USE IT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nPOLITICS AND WOMAN’S INTERESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average woman has never thought of politics as having an intimate\r\nrelation to her daily life. She has not realized that government has\r\na direct effect on the comfort and happiness of the family in the\r\nhome, on the successful upbringing of children, and on the health and\r\nsafety of men and women workers.\r\n\r\nShe has known vaguely that government controls the fundamental\r\nquestion of war or peace; that it has to do with taxation; that it\r\nhandles the mail, but that it also plays a large part in domestic and\r\nsocial life is a fact that she has only recently been learning.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid extension of the vote to women, especially the recent\r\ngranting of suffrage to the women of New York State, there is a new\r\nand wide-spread interest in how government works, and a realization\r\nof the importance of good government and the dire peril of bad\r\ngovernment. Women are conscientious; they are accepting their new\r\nresponsibilities with much seriousness. They are eager to learn how\r\nto be good citizens. The war also has made everybody think. It has\r\nmade government seem a more personal affair.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS GOVERNMENT?\r\n\r\n=Government is the management of those common affairs of a people\r\nwhich can be handled in a more effective and more economical way by a\r\ncommunity acting together than by each individual acting for himself.=\r\n\r\nIn a sparsely settled community government is less apparent than in\r\na city. Its functions are simple. Sometimes it does not seem very\r\nimportant. But as people congregate closer together it becomes more\r\ncomplicated and comes in closer and closer touch with the individual\r\nand family life.\r\n\r\nFor example, a man living in the country may rely on himself to\r\nprotect his home and property; but in the city life and property are\r\nbetter protected by a police force than if each individual citizen\r\nhad to provide his own protection. A woman in a pioneer country may\r\nbring up her child as she pleases. She may teach him when and how she\r\nchooses. But as population increases and government is established,\r\na large part of the child’s training is dictated by it. He must go\r\nto school at a certain age; he must stay there so many hours a day;\r\nhe must study certain things in a certain way. He cannot be put to\r\nwork until he has reached a certain age. If he contracts a contagious\r\ndisease the city takes control of the case.\r\n\r\nDirectly and indirectly the government in a city affects a woman’s\r\nlife and interests in innumerable ways.\r\n\r\nShe is dependent on it for the light and sunshine that comes into her\r\nhome. Laws concerning housing and building and tenement departments\r\nof government are very important to the health, comfort, and even\r\ndecency of the family. She is dependent on government for the safety\r\nof the milk she has to feed her baby. The health of the family\r\ndepends as much on the city department of health as on the mother’s\r\ncare. It is of the utmost importance to the city mother that the\r\nstreets be kept clean, because they are usually the only place that\r\nher children have in which to play. The street cleaning department,\r\ntherefore, touches her closely. It is of vital moment to her that the\r\nstreets be kept free of criminal influence, therefore the management\r\nof the police department is of great importance to her. If the town\r\nis run “wide open” it may mean that her husband’s wages may be\r\ndissipated. The way in which the excise law and the laws against\r\ngambling are enforced is a matter which deeply concerns her.\r\n\r\nIf she lives in the country the relation of government to her life\r\nis not so varied, but she is still dependent on it for the education\r\nof her child, for the socializing influences of the community, and\r\nfor much of the business prosperity of the farm. Are telephone\r\nconnections cheap, are the roads passable at all seasons, are good\r\nmarket facilities provided? These are all questions that greatly\r\naffect her welfare, and they depend largely on the government.\r\n\r\n=It is the business of government to maintain peace and to provide\r\nfor the common defense.=\r\n\r\nThis is a function of government so fundamental as to need little\r\ncomment. It is the first essential to the safe existence of the home.\r\n\r\n=It is the business of government to assure justice and equality of\r\ntreatment to all citizens.=\r\n\r\nThis becomes more difficult as population increases and life grows\r\nmore complicated. Nearly every human being to-day is dependent on\r\nthe work of other people for most of the necessities, as well as the\r\ncomforts and conveniences, of life. The food that we eat, the cotton\r\nand wool in the garments we wear, the coal that heats our houses, we\r\nowe to the toil of other people who in return may be dependent on us\r\nfor something that they use. It is a matter that concerns every one\r\nof us that in producing these things that we use human life shall be\r\nsafeguarded, that living wages shall be paid, and that standards of\r\ncivilization shall be maintained and advanced.\r\n\r\nAs individuals we cannot control conditions even for ourselves,\r\nas individuals we cannot control them for other people; but all\r\nof us working together in government can secure these fundamental\r\nnecessities for every one of us.\r\n\r\nSince government in a democracy is made by the people themselves, it\r\nis a responsibility that every one should share to help secure these\r\ncommon needs.\r\n\r\n=It is also a function of modern government to raise the standard of\r\nhealth, education, and living.=\r\n\r\nPlato said, “Only that state is healthy and can thrive which\r\nunceasingly endeavors to improve the individuals who constitute it.”\r\n\r\nSociety must be protected from vicious and destructive influence;\r\nthe intelligence and knowledge of all the people are needed for the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nAs human beings have become dependent on one another, the well-being\r\nor the degradation of one individual or family does not stop there.\r\nIt strongly influences the welfare of other individuals and families.\r\nFor their own protection people have not only the right, but the\r\nobligation to make a government that shall foster and advance the\r\ncommon welfare.\r\n\r\n_The basis of good government is the golden rule._ To help secure\r\nfor others the protection that you demand for yourself is part of\r\nthe obligation of good citizenship. The honesty and efficiency of\r\ngovernment in a republic like the United States depend on the voters;\r\non their sense of responsibility, and on the intelligence with\r\nwhich they use their power. The feeling of responsibility of each\r\nindividual, for the public welfare, cannot be too highly developed.\r\n\r\nDemocracy can only be a success in the degree that the people who\r\nmake that democracy are determined that it shall deal with justice,\r\nand that it shall offer opportunity to every one within its borders.\r\nThey must also be vigilant to see that it shall deal wisely with\r\ntheir common problems as they develop.\r\n\r\nTo be a citizen of such a democracy and to have the power to help it\r\ngrow along these lines, to be able to serve one’s country loyally in\r\nthe full efficiency of citizenship, are great privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTOWN AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n=The United States is both a Democracy and a Republic.=\r\n\r\n=A Democracy= means, literally, a government by the people.\r\n\r\n=A Republic= is a democracy in which the people elect representatives\r\nto carry on the government for them.\r\n\r\nThe United States is a federation of forty-eight States. For\r\nconvenience of government each State is subdivided into smaller units.\r\n\r\nIn every political division of the State there are three distinct\r\ndepartments:\r\n\r\n=The Legislative=, the part that makes the law.\r\n\r\n=The Administrative=, the part that administers the law.\r\n\r\n=The Judicial=, the part that interprets the law.\r\n\r\nEven in a sparsely settled community people have certain interests in\r\ncommon. Roads have to be made, schools established, the poor cared\r\nfor, and taxes levied. Who does these things? If a cow breaks into a\r\nneighbor’s cornfield, or if there is an epidemic, whose business is\r\nit to look after it?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the school district, which has to do only with\r\nthe public schools, the town[1] or township is the smallest division\r\nof the State for purposes of government. The government of the town\r\nis the nearest approach we have to a direct government by the people\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n=The Town Meeting= brings people together to discuss their local\r\naffairs, to elect officers, and to appropriate the money necessary to\r\ncarry out their plans. It is held in New York State every other year,\r\nsome time between February 1st and May 1st.\r\n\r\nThe business of the town meeting includes the disposal of town\r\nproperty, the care of bridges and roads, the care of the poor, the\r\nnumber of constables, matters concerning public health, and the care\r\nof stray animals.\r\n\r\nAny citizen has a right to bring up any suggestion he pleases for\r\nthe people to consider and debate in open meeting, and then to take\r\nwhatever action they choose. In a matter of taxation or incurring a\r\ntown debt, only taxpaying citizens can vote.\r\n\r\nWhere it exists at its best, the town meeting has an admirable\r\neffect in stimulating interest in local affairs and in developing\r\npublic spirit. A special town meeting can be called by a petition of\r\ntwenty-five taxpayers, or at the request of certain officials.\r\n\r\nThe town meeting is a form of government particularly adapted to a\r\nsmall community. With the increase in population it has been given up\r\nin many counties, and the election of town officers now usually takes\r\nplace at the regular fall election.\r\n\r\n=Town Officers=: =The Supervisor= is the chief executive officer of\r\nthe town, and is elected for two years. He receives and pays out all\r\nmoney except that raised for public roads and the care of the town\r\npoor. If the town roads are in bad condition or if the poor are not\r\nproperly cared for, he is responsible. The honesty and efficiency of\r\nthe administration of town affairs are in his hands. He represents\r\nthe town on the county board of supervisors.\r\n\r\n=The Town Board= consists of the supervisor, town clerk, and at\r\nleast two justices of the peace. It meets regularly twice a year.\r\nIt is the business of the board to receive the accounts of the town\r\nofficers and examine them, to hear and decide claims against the\r\ntown. An appeal may be taken from their decision to the county board\r\nof supervisors. They may also frame propositions to be submitted to\r\nthe voters, and may borrow money to meet appropriations made at the\r\ntown meeting. They may appoint a physician to aid as health officer\r\nfor the town.\r\n\r\n=The Town Clerk= is the general secretary and bookkeeper for the\r\ntown. He records births, marriages, and deaths, chattel mortgages\r\nand property notes. He keeps the records of the town meetings. He\r\nposts election notices. He issues marriage licenses, permissions for\r\nburial, hunting licenses, etc.\r\n\r\n=The Superintendent of Roads= has charge of building and maintaining\r\nthe town highways, bridges, and culverts outside of the incorporated\r\nvillages. He is paid by the day, and may hire machines and horses or\r\npurchase tools and material for road making. The opportunities for\r\ndishonest money in this office have sometimes made it sought after. A\r\ncontract may contain a “rake-off,” bills may be padded, and materials\r\naccepted which are different from specifications.\r\n\r\n=Three Assessors and a Collector=: The assessors determine the value\r\nof taxable property in the town, and divide the amount of taxes to\r\nbe raised among the owners of the property. If a property-owner is\r\ndissatisfied with his assessment he may appear in August before the\r\nassessors and “swear off” what he considers an exorbitant amount.\r\nAssessment rolls are made out, and it is the duty of the collector\r\nto collect the money. Town collectors are paid 1 per cent. on taxes\r\ncollected within thirty days after due, with increasing fees for\r\ncollecting taxes after that time. This is an encouragement to the\r\ncollector to be dilatory in his collections, and is a disadvantage to\r\nthe town. It has been suggested that penalties for delinquent taxes\r\nshould go to the town and not to the collector.\r\n\r\n=The Town Constables= have the duty of keeping the peace and carrying\r\nout the orders of the justice of the peace. They may arrest people\r\naccused or suspected of crime. There may not be more than five in a\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n=The Overseers of the Poor= are charged with the duty of looking\r\nafter persons who are destitute and have no relative to support them.\r\nThey may assist such persons in their own homes or send them to the\r\ncounty poorhouse. This office often conflicts with that of county\r\nsuperintendent of the poor, and it has been recommended that it be\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\n=The Justice of the Peace= is the judicial officer of the town. Each\r\ntown has four such officers, each elected for four years. The justice\r\nof the peace may hear civil cases where the sum involved is not over\r\ntwo hundred dollars. He may try petty offenses of all kinds, breaches\r\nof the peace, drunkenness, and petty larceny. He may issue warrants\r\nand may hold persons suspected of serious crime to await action by\r\nthe grand jury.\r\n\r\n=Terms of Town Officials=: Each official is elected for two years,\r\nexcept the justices of the peace and sometimes one or two assessors,\r\nwho are elected for four years.\r\n\r\n=Pay of Town Officials=: Most of these officers are paid from two\r\nto four dollars for every day of actual service. The town clerk,\r\njustices of the peace, and constables are paid certain fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY\r\n\r\nThe county comprises a number of townships. It is a political\r\ndivision created by the State to administer certain local affairs, to\r\nact as agent for the State, to collect State taxes, and to enforce\r\nState law. The county owns the court-house and jail; it can sue or be\r\nsued.\r\n\r\nIn most of New York State the county has become more important\r\nin administering local affairs than the town. New York State has\r\nsixty-two counties, of which five are in Greater New York. They vary\r\nin size from Richmond County (Staten Island), which has only 59\r\nsquare miles, to St. Lawrence County, which has 2,880 square miles.\r\nThey vary also in population from Hamilton County, with 2,000 people,\r\nto New York County with two million.\r\n\r\n=Elected Officials=: =The Board of Supervisors= is the legislative\r\nbody of the county. This board is composed of the supervisors elected\r\nby each township, and also one member from each ward of a city in the\r\ncounty. They elect their own chairman.\r\n\r\nThe board of supervisors have the custody and control of the\r\ncourt-house, jail, poorhouse, and all county property; they receive\r\nand decide claims against the county; they direct the raising of\r\nmoney by taxation to meet the expenses of the county and the county’s\r\nshare in State taxes; they fix salaries for county officials; borrow\r\nmoney for county needs; they regulate laws for the protection of\r\nfish and game; they open county highways, erect bridges, and may\r\nprovide hospitals for tuberculosis. They also act as a board of\r\ncanvassers to canvass the returns after an election.\r\n\r\n=The Sheriff=, the executive officer of the county, is elected to\r\nenforce the law. On him rests the security of life and property. He\r\nmust preserve the peace, arrest offenders against the law, and hold\r\nthem in custody. He must not allow fear or sympathy to interfere\r\nwith his enforcement of the law. He summons jurors and witnesses for\r\ncounty lawsuits and executes the orders of the court. Until recently\r\nthe fees which he received made the sheriff’s office one much sought\r\nafter. These now go to the treasurer in many counties, and the\r\nsheriff is paid a salary. He cannot serve two consecutive terms. He\r\nmay appoint an under-sheriff and deputy sheriffs.\r\n\r\n=The District Attorney= is the public prosecutor for the county, and\r\nbrings suit “in the name of the people of the State.” He is also\r\nthe legal adviser for county affairs. It is his business to protect\r\nthe public against crime of all kinds. If corruption exists in any\r\ndepartment, it is his duty to bring it to light. The good order of\r\nthe community and the efficiency of government in the county depend\r\nmuch on him. He determines what cases shall come before the grand\r\njury.\r\n\r\n=The County Clerk= keeps all the important records for the county,\r\nincluding deeds, mortgages, and maps, and makes out the election\r\ncertificates. Public documents must always be open for public\r\ninspection. In some counties there is a recorder of deeds. The clerk\r\nalso acts as clerk of the county court. His office has an income\r\nfrom fees which used to go to the clerk and made this office very\r\nlucrative. In most counties the fees now go to the county treasurer,\r\nand the clerk is paid a salary.\r\n\r\n=The County Treasurer= receives and disburses all public moneys for\r\nthe county. He receives money from the town supervisor, collected\r\nfor county and State taxes, the latter of which he pays to the State\r\ntreasurer. He receives from the State money for the public schools,\r\nwhich he in turn passes on to the towns. He must give a bond for the\r\nsafe-keeping of these public funds. He also chooses the bank in which\r\npublic funds are kept, and ought to give a careful accounting of the\r\ninterest which must go into the county treasury.\r\n\r\n=The Superintendent of the Poor= disburses the money raised to\r\ncare for the poor of the county. The superintendents of all the\r\npublic charities in the county make their reports to him, and he is\r\nresponsible for them to the board of supervisors. He also makes an\r\nannual report to the State Board of Charities.\r\n\r\n=Coroners=: From one to four coroners may be elected in each county,\r\nexcept those in Greater New York. Their duty is to investigate sudden\r\nand suspicious deaths, and sometimes the cause of a suspicious fire.\r\nThey are often practising physicians or they may employ physicians to\r\nconduct inquests or autopsies.\r\n\r\n=The County Superintendent of Highways= is appointed by the board of\r\nsupervisors for four years.\r\n\r\n=The County Judge= presides over the county court. His salary\r\nvaries and is fixed by State law, although paid by the county. This\r\noffice should be most carefully filled. The county judge is not\r\nonly important because of his decisions, but he is one of the most\r\npowerful men politically in the county. Only a man of strict probity\r\nshould be elected to this office.\r\n\r\n=The Surrogate= administers estates of persons deceased, controls the\r\nprobate of wills, and appoints guardians for the property of minors.\r\nHis term is six years. In counties with small populations the county\r\njudge acts as surrogate.\r\n\r\nThe term of office for county officials is three years, except that\r\nof the supervisors elected by the towns for two years, and the judges\r\nelected for six years.\r\n\r\n=Political Honesty=: The question is often asked, are these\r\nlocal offices honestly managed? Are there possible loopholes for\r\ncorruption? The following answer to these questions was given\r\nrecently by one in a position to know:\r\n\r\n“The impelling motive of most politicians is the enjoyment of a\r\nsense of power and influence. The day laborer who loafs through his\r\npolitical job and the salaried higher officer who neglects his work\r\nand engages in private business are examples of the most usual and\r\nformidable class of political grafters. The heads of departments and\r\nhigher elected officers are apt to do their work as well as they\r\ncan, in order to qualify themselves for re-election. The days when a\r\nman could dishonestly make a fortune in one political term are past\r\nin this country, and waste, favoritism, and stupidity are the only\r\ndangerous elements which we must look for.\r\n\r\n“The greatest waste in expenditure of moneys by boards of supervisors\r\nis usually on county roads and highways, where in some years\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars are lost by unscientific building\r\nand upkeep. This also is an easy way for a dishonest supervisor to\r\nreward political supporters by paying them for work on the road which\r\nthey do not do. The same things obtain in the matter of purchase of\r\nsupplies and the county printing. The cure for this is to have all\r\nexpenditures beyond a nominal amount made on public bids.\r\n\r\n“Another opportunity of abuse is the payment of supervisors in fees.\r\nMany counties still adhere to the old rule of fees: $4 per day for\r\nattending board meetings; 8 cents per mile for going and returning;\r\n$4 per day while actually engaged in any investigation or any other\r\nlawful duty. For copying the assessment roll and extending taxes on\r\nthe tax roll supervisors receive commissions which, in some counties,\r\nrun into thousands of dollars. The remedy for the numberless evils\r\nwhich accompany the fee system is to put the supervisors on a salary\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n“The sheriff has charge of the prisoners in the jail. Therein lies\r\nhis opportunity for dishonesty and extortion. Sheriffs should\r\nreceive salaries and not fees, and every county should have a\r\nwell-organized board of women visitors to inspect the jails and\r\nlockups at least every two weeks.\r\n\r\n“The district attorney has an opportunity for dishonesty in the\r\nexpenditure of the contingent fund, which is always provided for\r\nhim, and which he can pay out with little or no check. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, most men elected to the office of district attorney are of\r\nhigh enough caliber to make the percentage of dishonesty almost _nil_.\r\n\r\n“If the county clerk is paid by fees it is difficult to expect an\r\nabsolute, ethical fulfilment of his duty, and probable that he will\r\nbe working for himself rather than the county.\r\n\r\n“The duties of the county superintendent of the poor are in continual\r\nconflict with those of the overseers of the poor. The opportunity to\r\nwaste and misappropriate county funds without detection is not as\r\ngreat as it used to be, because of the close supervision of the State\r\nBoard of Charities; but the county superintendent has wide discretion\r\nin giving alms and caring for the county poor, and the office is,\r\ntherefore, usually sought by a minor political leader, who, by virtue\r\nof his office, can provide for his dependent supporters, which he\r\nusually does in the sincere belief that he is properly dispensing\r\ncharity. In no case, however, is any great amount wasted, and on the\r\nwhole the work is fairly well done.\r\n\r\n“Justices of the peace and constables and town clerks usually receive\r\nfees. They should be put on a salary basis.\r\n\r\n“Overseers of the poor have opportunities for fees and\r\nmisappropriation of small amounts because they are allowed liberal\r\ndiscretion in selecting objects of the town’s bounty. The office\r\nshould be wiped out, the distinction between town and county\r\npoor abolished; all the work should be done through the county\r\nsuperintendent of the poor, who should be responsible to the State\r\nBoard of Charities.”\r\n\r\n=The Relation of Country to City, State, and Nation=: While the\r\nproblems of government in rural districts are simple and few, the\r\nclose relations of city and country have made the wise management\r\nof country affairs of great importance to those who live in cities.\r\nOn the other hand, the handling of the more complex and difficult\r\ncity problems are of equally grave importance to country dwellers.\r\nComfortable, prosperous life in a rural community is dependent not\r\nonly on local conditions, but also on State and National government.\r\n\r\nGood roads are equally important to city and country, and they\r\ndepend largely on the State. The kind of education that the village\r\nor country school gives will determine the intelligence and earning\r\ncapacity of many of the coming generations of city dwellers, and this\r\ninstruction is determined both by the State and by the local school\r\nboards.\r\n\r\nLow telephone rates and good interurban car lines will put the woman\r\non the farm in close touch with her neighbors, and so will stimulate\r\nher interest in outside affairs. Healthy community life and rural\r\namusements will keep the young people content at home and help\r\nprevent the drift toward the city. The farmer’s produce is handled\r\nby city shops and markets, and the manufactured articles of city\r\nfactories go into the homes of every rural district.\r\n\r\nNot only are city and country dependent on each other, but also one\r\npart of the country is dependent on some other part, far distant, for\r\nsome of the necessities of life. Our cotton comes from the South,\r\nwheat comes from the West, sugar may come from Colorado or Cuba.\r\nThe whole country is linked together in trade relationship, and\r\nfreight rates and interstate commerce are controlled by the Federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe good citizen, then, has a vital interest not only in his\r\nsupervisor and local affairs, but in both State and National\r\ngovernment. When he realizes that the size of his income, the comfort\r\nof his family life, the welfare of his children, and their getting on\r\nin life, depend to an appreciable degree on government, he and she\r\nwill begin to take a livelier interest in politics. The discussion\r\nof these affairs in the home will serve to stimulate the interest of\r\nthe entire family in what is, after all, an important part of their\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nA small community has one problem all its own. If there is some\r\noffense against the public welfare, no one wants to complain. It\r\nmay be something merely disagreeable, or it may be a serious menace\r\nto public health; but every one is slow to make a fuss about it\r\nbecause he cannot hide his identity, and he is afraid he might become\r\nunpopular. This fear is usually groundless because it is likely that\r\nmost of his neighbors agree with him in wanting to have the condition\r\nchanged. A country community needs fearless, public-spirited\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The word town as used in New York does not mean a village or\r\ncity, but a political division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE INCORPORATED VILLAGE AND CITY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs population grows government needs increase. When people establish\r\ntheir homes close together and form a populous community within\r\na limited area, it becomes necessary to have streets opened up,\r\nsidewalks made, the streets lighted, protection from fire, and other\r\nthings that the township does not provide.\r\n\r\nA territory of not over one square mile, having a population of\r\nat least two hundred people, may be incorporated as a village.\r\nOn a petition of the taxpayers they may vote on the proposition,\r\nwhether or not they shall become an incorporated village, and have a\r\ngovernment of their own distinct from that of the town. Even if they\r\nincorporate they still remain a part of the town, and take the same\r\npart in town government as before.\r\n\r\n=There Are Four Classes of Villages=: First class, those with a\r\npopulation of 5,000 or over; second class, with a population between\r\n3,000 and 5,000; third class, with a population of between 1,000 and\r\n3,000; fourth class, with a population of less than 1,000. In many\r\nWestern States a village of one or two thousand inhabitants usually\r\nbecomes a city. In New York State there are villages of more than\r\n15,000 population.\r\n\r\n=The Village President=, who serves one year, is the chief executive,\r\nand serves without pay. He is the head of the village board of\r\ntrustees, and in small villages is the head of the police. Local\r\norder, peace, health, and sanitation depend on him.\r\n\r\n=The Board of Trustees= consists of from two to four men in villages\r\nof the third and fourth class; from two to six men in villages of\r\nthe second class, and from two to eight men in villages of the first\r\nclass, elected for two years, half of them elected each year. They\r\nserve without pay. They make ordinances for the government of the\r\nvillage and administer its affairs. They decide where sidewalks\r\nshall be built, whether streets shall be paved, how garbage shall\r\nbe handled; they provide light and a water-supply; they provide for\r\nthe raising of money by taxes; if a sewerage system is needed it\r\nmust be done under the supervision of the State Board of Health.\r\nPropositions relating to the large expenditure of funds must be\r\nsubmitted to the taxpayers.\r\n\r\nQuestions of police, water-supply, fire protection, lights, sewers,\r\nare sometimes handled by the board of trustees, or if the village\r\nis large enough there may be separate boards or commissioners\r\nestablished for some of these things.\r\n\r\nA Fire Department, with fire house, hose and wagon, exists in most\r\nvillages, voluntary in small places, and a paid force in the larger\r\nvillages. The fire company is a popular department of public service,\r\nbecause of the social pleasure involved and because firemen are\r\nexempt from jury duty.\r\n\r\n=A Treasurer, Assessors, a Collector, and a Village Clerk=,\r\nare usually elected and sometimes =a Street Commissioner=. Not\r\ninfrequently the latter office is considered a sinecure, and streets\r\nlittered with waste paper and other refuse are common in the average\r\nvillage. The commissioner should be held up to his duty by all the\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n=A Board of Health= of from three to seven members must be appointed\r\nby the trustees to work in connection with the State Board of Health.\r\nThis board elects a health officer, who must be a physician. The\r\nbusiness of the board is to watch over drains, cesspools, to prevent\r\nnuisances and contagion from disease. Health officers should be\r\nvigilant and morally courageous, otherwise the community will pay in\r\nillness.\r\n\r\n=A Police Justice=, elected for four years, handles cases involving\r\nviolations of village ordinances. The board of trustees may appoint a\r\nvillage attorney to represent them in case of lawsuits.\r\n\r\n=The Annual Village Election= usually takes place the third Tuesday\r\nin March. A special village election, similar to a town meeting, may\r\nbe called for taxpaying citizens to vote on special questions, such\r\nas the removal of garbage at public expense, or the purchase of water\r\nor lighting plants.\r\n\r\nA water-supply is usually furnished by a village of any size. An\r\nabundant supply is necessary, not only for homes, but for fire\r\nprotection and for any sewerage system. New York villages and cities\r\nare very well lighted. Whether there should be public or private\r\nownership of public utilities is a question which is much discussed.\r\nWhile the water-supply is usually owned by the municipality, the\r\nlighting system more often belongs to a private company.\r\n\r\nSewage disposal is a matter which has to be taken up sooner or later\r\nby a village as it grows in population. For too long our villages\r\nhave polluted the convenient stream. They have been slow to study the\r\nquestion, and to dispose of sewage and garbage in a way that is both\r\nsatisfactory and economical. Foreign cities often make a profit out\r\nof the disposal of their refuse, whereas it usually costs us money.\r\nThese questions need more intelligent consideration than is usually\r\ngiven them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a community grows larger it outgrows the simple form of village\r\ngovernment and needs one more adapted to its complex and growing\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nThe growth of cities in the past hundred years is phenomenal. In\r\n1820, 83 per cent. of the people of the United States lived on farms;\r\nin 1910 only 32 per cent. The problems that a city government has to\r\nmeet are many and difficult, especially in the cities of New York\r\nState, where a large proportion of the people are foreign-born, and\r\nwhere there is often a large floating population without civic pride\r\nor interest. In smaller communities, where every one is known, the\r\nfear of public opinion acts as a restraining influence which is not\r\nfelt in a city where the individual identity is often submerged.\r\n\r\n=A CITY GOVERNMENT= works under a charter granted by the State, which\r\nlimits its powers. These charters used to be made out separately for\r\neach city, and the legislature interfered with the management of the\r\nlocal affairs of a city in a way that caused a demand for “Home rule”\r\nfor cities. This has been partially granted, and cities in New York\r\nState now have large power to provide public works and to control\r\npublic education, health, safety, recreation, and charities, although\r\nthey are still occasionally interfered with by the State legislature.\r\n\r\nThe city is a direct agent of the State, and does not work as the\r\nvillage does, through the town and county.\r\n\r\n=Three Classes of Cities=: First-class cities have a population of\r\n175,000 or over. Second-class cities have a population of 50,000\r\nto 175,000; third-class cities are all those with a population of\r\nless than 50,000. The object of this division is to enable the\r\nState to legislate for the needs of groups of cities instead of\r\nindividual ones. The mayor of a city may veto a measure passed by the\r\nlegislature, but if approved by the legislature and signed by the\r\ngovernor, it may become law in spite of his veto.\r\n\r\nThe needs of government in a city are those of the village multiplied\r\nin size; they include police protection, care of the public health,\r\na pure water-supply, inspection of food-supplies, supervision of\r\nweights and measures, adequate housing inspection, economic and\r\nsatisfactory garbage and sewage disposal, fire protection, gas\r\nand electric lighting, good paving, clean streets, the care of\r\ndependents, maintenance of hospitals and libraries, good educational\r\nfacilities, transportation, and many other activities.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of government for cities is the same in all the\r\nclasses. Cities of the first class are New York City, Buffalo, and\r\nRochester (see Greater New York).\r\n\r\n=Cities of the Second Class=: =The Mayor=, who is elected for two\r\nyears, is the chief executive officer. He has as important and\r\nresponsible a position as any man at the head of a big corporation.\r\nThe management of the city is in his hands. The health and welfare\r\nof its dwellers depend on him. While the city council legislates\r\nfor the city, it is his business to see that laws and ordinances\r\nare enforced. He may veto an ordinance passed by the city council,\r\nalthough they may pass it over his veto by a two-thirds vote. The\r\nmayor has the power of appointing the heads of most of the important\r\ndepartments of the city’s business. Sometimes the city council has\r\nto confirm an appointment, and an official can only be removed for\r\ngood cause, and he must be given a hearing and an opportunity to\r\nanswer charges. To elect to the position of mayor and to put the\r\nentire responsibility of all the complex problems of city government\r\non a man of no training or fitness for the position, is to invite\r\nextravagance, incompetence, and corruption.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of convenience in government a city is divided into\r\nsubdivisions called _wards_, and for elections, into certain voting\r\nprecincts called _election districts_.\r\n\r\n=The Board of Aldermen or The Common Council= consists of one\r\nalderman chosen from each ward and a president of the board. They\r\nare elected for two years, and are to the city about the same\r\nthat the board of trustees are to the village. Their powers are\r\nlimited by the city charter. In general, they may pass ordinances\r\nrelating to streets, sewers, parks, public buildings, amusements,\r\ngrant franchises, regulate traffic, levy taxes, and borrow money\r\nunder certain restrictions for the use of the city. An alderman has\r\npower over many local interests in his district. It is an important\r\nposition which in the main has been disregarded; it should be filled\r\nby a man chosen for fitness as a local representative and not as a\r\nreward for party service. No man should be elected to this board whom\r\nyou would not trust as the custodian of your own property or the\r\nguardian of your children, because in a public sense that is what he\r\nis.\r\n\r\n=The Board of Estimate and Apportionment= is one of the most\r\nimportant departments of city government. It has large control over\r\nthe city’s finances, and determines its policies in all financial\r\nmatters, franchises, privileges and permits, and makes the city\r\nbudget. It consists of the mayor, comptroller, corporation counsel,\r\npresident of the common council, and the city engineer.\r\n\r\n=The Department of Contract and Supply= lets contracts for material\r\nand work required by the city. With the constant growth of city\r\ndepartments and city business, in which supplies and materials of\r\nmany kinds are needed, this is also an important committee.\r\n\r\nOther elected officers are comptroller, treasurer, president of the\r\ncommon council, and assessors.\r\n\r\nThe department of finance is managed by the comptroller and the\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nThe department of assessment and taxation, which makes the\r\nassessment rolls, consists of four assessors, elected two at a time,\r\nfor four years each.\r\n\r\nThe department of law is presided over by a corporation counsel,\r\nappointed by the mayor. The mayor also appoints the city engineer and\r\nthe heads of the following departments:\r\n\r\nThe department of public works, which controls the water-supply,\r\nstreets, sewers, buildings, and public markets; the department of\r\npublic safety, which includes the bureaus of gas and electricity;\r\ndepartments of police, health, charities and correction, and the\r\nboard of education.\r\n\r\nCities of the third class are not uniform in their government, but\r\nthe general outline is the same as for cities of the second class.\r\n\r\n=City Elections= are held in the odd-numbered years. State officials\r\nare elected in the even-numbered years. The purpose of setting\r\na different time for these elections is to keep city politics\r\nindependent of State political machines. Party issues have little to\r\ndo with the problems of a city. It is evident that the government of\r\na large city is a very important and complicated business. There are\r\nseveral offices which demand as great executive ability as would be\r\nrequired of a man at the head of a large business corporation. But\r\ncity offices are usually given to men not for fitness, but because\r\nof party affiliation. Public sentiment is beginning to ask why high\r\nstandards of competence and efficiency should not be as much demanded\r\nin public as in private business.\r\n\r\n=The Budget=: The heads of the various departments decide how much\r\nmoney will be required to run each department for the ensuing year.\r\nThe Board of Estimate and Apportionment considers these requests and\r\nfixes the tax-rate necessary to raise the money needed (see Chapters\r\nIV and XI).\r\n\r\n=Franchise Rights=: A city has many sources of revenue of its own.\r\nPublic utilities which furnish such necessities as transportation,\r\nwater, gas, and electric light, earn enormous profits. In some places\r\nsome of these things are owned by the city and the revenues go to\r\nthe city. In others, the right to build and operate such a public\r\nbusiness is given to a private corporation through a franchise. It is\r\nevident that these franchise rights are extremely valuable and should\r\nnot be given away without adequate compensation to the city, as well\r\nas the insuring of good service. The rates that are charged, and\r\nthe service rendered, are matters of vast importance to the people\r\nof a city. Municipal ownership of such utilities has never been as\r\nextensive in this country as abroad, but the sentiment in favor of it\r\nis growing. Franchise rights used to be given for long terms, even in\r\nperpetuity, but public sentiment now demands that they be subject to\r\nrevision at reasonable intervals. Most cities to-day own their own\r\nwater-supply, and some of them have their own lighting plants.\r\n\r\n=Commission Form of Government=: So many officials are needed to\r\nmanage the complex affairs of a city that even if well qualified\r\nmen are put up for office, with so many candidates to be elected,\r\nit is impossible for the voters to know the merit of them all.\r\nCity government has been the weakest spot in our political life.\r\nIn an effort to meet its defects, a number of cities have adopted\r\nthe policy of doing away entirely with the form of government as\r\noutlined, and electing on a non-partisan ticket several commissioners\r\n(sometimes headed by a mayor), each one of whom is put in charge of a\r\ndivision of the city’s administration, and made responsible for the\r\nwork of this department.\r\n\r\nThe fact is being recognized that skill and expert training are\r\nneeded in public officials; that the power should be given to a few\r\nmen, and that they should be held responsible for the success of\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nBuffalo now has a commission form of government.\r\n\r\n=The City Manager Plan= gives the management of a city to one man,\r\nwho is engaged by the city, and held responsible for the conduct of\r\ncity affairs, in the same way that a large business enterprise would\r\nengage a manager. A city manager should be a man who has made a study\r\nand profession of city government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGREATER NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of New York includes five counties: New York, Kings, Queens,\r\nBronx, and Richmond. In one hundred years, the population of New York\r\nCity grew from 50,000 to 4,000,000 people. It now has a population\r\nof nearly 6,000,000, which is about one-half the population of the\r\nState, and it is the second city in size in the world.\r\n\r\nThe government of the city is strictly prescribed by its charter; for\r\nany improvement that it desires outside of the provisions of that\r\ncharter, the city must go for permission to the State Legislature.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in government the city is divided into five boroughs:\r\nManhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Richmond (Staten Island).\r\n\r\n=The Mayor= is the chief executive of the city. He is elected for\r\nfour years and has a salary of $15,000. He has powers of appointment\r\nand removal over a vast number of important positions, including the\r\nheads of the big city departments. Like the Governor of the State\r\nand the President of the United States, he initiates legislation by\r\nsending once a year a message to the Board of Aldermen containing a\r\ngeneral statement of the government and financial condition of the\r\ncity, and recommending such measures as he deems advisable. He may\r\nask for special legislation at any time.\r\n\r\nAll ordinances and by-laws passed by the Board of Aldermen go to the\r\nMayor for approval. If he vetoes a measure, the Board of Aldermen may\r\npass it over his veto by a two-thirds or three-fourths vote, with\r\nthe exception of the granting of franchise rights, where his veto is\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\n=The Comptroller= is at the head of the financial affairs of the\r\ncity. His term of office is four years, and salary $15,000. He\r\nmay appoint three deputies at $7,500 each, an assistant deputy at\r\n$3,000, besides other heads of the various divisions of the finance\r\ndepartment; but the minor positions are under the Civil Service.\r\n\r\n=The President of the Board of Aldermen= is elected for the same term\r\nas the Mayor, and receives a salary of $7,500. He takes the Mayor’s\r\nplace in case of absence or death.\r\n\r\n=The Presidents of Manhattan, Bronx, and Brooklyn Boroughs= receive\r\n$7,500 a year; of Queens and Richmond Boroughs, $5,000. They are\r\nelected for four years, and each president has general oversight\r\nover streets, bridges, sewers, and buildings in his borough. He may\r\nappoint a commissioner of public works, and a superintendent of\r\nbuildings for his borough, and local school boards. In Queens and\r\nRichmond the borough presidents have charge of street-cleaning.\r\n\r\n=The Board of Aldermen= is the legislative body of the city. It\r\nconsists of seventy-three men elected from Aldermanic districts.\r\nThey serve for a term of two years, and receive a salary of $2,000\r\neach. This board makes the ordinances for the government of the\r\ncity. It makes and enforces police, fire, building, health, and\r\npark regulations; it makes by-laws for the regulation of public\r\nmarkets, streets, public buildings, docks; for inspection of weights\r\nand measures; regulating places of amusement, height of buildings;\r\nlicensing cabs, truckmen, and pawnbrokers, and regulations for the\r\nsuppression of vice. A city clerk and a clerk of the board at a\r\n$7,000 salary each, are appointed by the board.\r\n\r\n=The Board of Estimate and Apportionment= is the most important of\r\nthe city boards. It frames the city budget, which has to be adopted\r\nby the Board of Aldermen. It also passes on bills granting franchise\r\nrights. It represents the whole city, and consists of the Mayor,\r\nComptroller, President of the Board of Aldermen, each with three\r\nvotes; Presidents of Manhattan and Brooklyn Boroughs, with two votes\r\neach; and Presidents of Bronx, Richmond, and Queens Boroughs, with\r\none vote each.\r\n\r\nAmong the important appointive positions of the city which are in the\r\nhands of the Mayor are the following:\r\n\r\n=The Corporation Counsel=, with a salary of $15,000 a year, is the\r\nhead of the law department of the city, and is the city’s legal\r\nadviser. He has over fifty assistant counsels to appoint, with\r\nsalaries ranging from $3,000 to $10,000 a year, and a host of deputy\r\nand junior assistants.\r\n\r\n=The City Chamberlain= receives and pays out all moneys for the\r\ncity—salary $12,000. He may appoint a deputy at $5,000 a year. The\r\nabolishment of the office of Chamberlain as being unnecessary was\r\nrecommended by a recent incumbent; but it is too large a plum to be\r\nlightly discarded.\r\n\r\n=The President of the Department of Taxes and Assessments= receives\r\n$8,000 a year. Six other tax commissioners are appointed with\r\nsalaries of $7,000 each, two of whom must be of the opposing party.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of Accounts, of Correction, of Docks and Ferries,\r\nand of Health, the Fire Commissioner, Police Commissioner,\r\nCommissioner of Licenses, of Plants and Structures, of Public\r\nCharities, the Street-cleaning and Tenement House Commissioners,\r\nCommissioner of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity, and the chairman\r\nof the Parole Commission, all receive $7,500 a year; the Commissioner\r\nof Weights and Measures, $5,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThere is a new Commissioner of Public Markets, and a Supervisor of\r\nthe _City Record_, a city publication which must print all ordinances\r\nwhich involve the spending of city money, granting a franchise, or\r\nmaking a specific improvement, before they are passed by the Board of\r\nAldermen.\r\n\r\nThere are many other less important offices to be filled, and the\r\nBorough Presidents have still further appointments.\r\n\r\n=The Board of Education= has been reduced from forty-six to seven\r\nmembers, of whom two are now women. In addition there are forty-six\r\nlocal school boards in the various school districts, each consisting\r\nof five members appointed by the Borough President and the District\r\nSuperintendent of the local school district. These have now been\r\ndivided among the seven members of the new School Board.\r\n\r\n=The Board of Elections= consists of four commissioners, two\r\nRepublicans and two Democrats, appointed by the Board of Aldermen for\r\ntwo years, with a salary of $5,000 each. This board determines the\r\nelection-district boundaries, chooses about 2,000 polling-places,\r\nand appoints about 17,000 election officials. Since 1915 the city\r\nhas allowed school-houses and other public buildings to be used as\r\npolling-places, and at the last election nearly 1,000 districts were\r\nsupplied in this way.\r\n\r\n=Local Improvement Boards=: The city is divided into twenty-five\r\ndistricts, in each of which there is a Local Improvement Board,\r\nconsisting of the Borough President and the Aldermen of the\r\nAldermanic districts included in the local improvement district.\r\n\r\n=County Government Within the City=: Each county included in the\r\ncity of New York has a separate county government, independent of\r\nthe city, with its sheriff, county clerk, district attorney, and\r\nits county court in every county but New York. The office of Sheriff\r\nin New York County has been one of the highest paid offices in the\r\nState, because of its fees. These have amounted to from $80,000 to\r\n$100,000 or more a year, and the county and Sheriff have divided\r\nthem. The county now receives all the fees, and the Sheriff a salary\r\nof $12,000 a year; but he cannot be re-elected, and the term of\r\noffice has been increased from two to four years.\r\n\r\n=Courts=—=Supreme Courts=: The first judicial department, and the\r\nfirst judicial district of the State are formed by New York and Bronx\r\nCounties. Brooklyn, Queens, and Richmond form the second. The Special\r\nand Trial terms of the Supreme Court try both criminal and civil\r\ncases with and without a jury, as in other counties.\r\n\r\n=County Courts= are held in Kings, Queens, Bronx, and Richmond\r\nCounties, and each of them except Richmond has a _Surrogate’s Court_.\r\nNew York County elects two Surrogates, for a term of fourteen years\r\neach, at a salary of $15,000 a year. In place of the County Court,\r\nNew York County has a _City Court_, which tries civil suits and is\r\na naturalization court, and a _Court of General Sessions_, which\r\ntries criminal cases. The _Court of Special Sessions_, with a chief\r\njustice and fifteen assistant justices appointed by the Mayor,\r\ntries cases of misdemeanors, and offenders sent to them by the City\r\nMagistrates. One division of this court is the Children’s Court, with\r\none presiding justice and five associate justices, with a court in\r\neach borough. These justices hold office for a term of ten years.\r\n\r\n=Magistrates’ Courts= are held by a large number of magistrates,\r\nappointed by the Mayor, and a chief magistrate who has general\r\nsupervision of them. _Municipal Courts_ are held in various parts of\r\nthe city to try small civil suits. There are forty-five Municipal\r\nCourt districts, in each of which there is a judge elected by the\r\npeople of the district for a term of ten years.\r\n\r\nThere are separate Night Courts for both men and women, a Domestic\r\nRelations Court, which deals with cases of non-support of wives and\r\nchildren, and poor relations, and a Traffic Court, which deals solely\r\nwith violations of the traffic laws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo even mention the various institutions in the city of New York\r\nwhich are engaged in improving the health and social welfare of the\r\npeople would take many pages. There is great need among them of\r\na more clean-cut division of activities, and less overlapping of\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n_The Commissioner of Public Charities_, appointed by the Mayor, is\r\nresponsible for the care of the city’s dependents. In 1915, 350,362\r\nfree lodgings were given to dispossessed families and needy men and\r\nwomen. There are 329 institutions receiving money from the city\r\nfor the care of dependent children, and 22,753 children were in\r\ntheir charge on January 1, 1916. The care which these children have\r\nreceived has been severely criticized. The conflicting authority of\r\nthe State Board of Charities and the City Board of Inspection of\r\nCharitable Institutions, is said to be responsible for this. In the\r\nfuture, the city is to conduct its own inspections. Widows’ pensions\r\nare administered for all of Greater New York by one _Child Welfare\r\nBoard_ of nine members appointed by the Mayor, of whom two must be\r\nwomen. They serve for a term of eight years without salary.\r\n\r\n_The Tenement House Department_ looks after the 103,882 tenement\r\nbuildings of the city, and has a force of 193 inspectors, of whom\r\neight are women. There are still about 9,000 dark rooms in the old\r\ntenements, built before the law was passed requiring a certain\r\namount of light and air, which have not been made over to meet the\r\nnew requirements.\r\n\r\n_The Street-cleaning Department_ employs regularly about 5,400 men at\r\nsalaries ranging from $720 to $860 a year.\r\n\r\n_The Board of Inebriety_ was organized to take charge of persons who\r\nare chronic addicts to alcohol or drugs, to treat them as victims\r\nof disease, and send them to a farm where treatment looking toward\r\na cure is combined with farm work, truck gardening, etc. The great\r\nneeds of this work cannot be met until further accommodations are\r\nmade for patients.\r\n\r\n=The Municipal Civil Service Commission=, consisting of three members\r\nappointed by the Mayor, maintains a regular staff of examiners of\r\napplicants for city positions. The regular payroll of the city\r\nincludes nearly 85,000 persons, of whom about 30,000 are not under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Civil Service. There are also about 20,000\r\nothers who are employed part of the time.\r\n\r\nThere is a free _public employment bureau_ which is growing\r\nsteadily and is placing over two thousand applicants a month, and a\r\nCommissioner of Weights and Measures.\r\n\r\nThe management of each one of the large departments of city\r\ngovernment requires special and technical training. A corporation\r\nmanager would search the country for the best man to be found for\r\neach particular department.\r\n\r\nSchool-teachers and school superintendents are chosen because of\r\ntheir training and experience. Minor city employees are appointed\r\nfrom Civil Service lists; but the custom of American cities is to\r\nappoint men at the heads of city departments who have distinguished\r\nthemselves for party service.\r\n\r\n=The Budget for Greater New York= is made up, beginning in June,\r\nand being adopted November 1st. Estimates of the needs of each\r\ndepartment for the coming year are submitted to the Board of Estimate\r\nand Apportionment, and are studied by sub-committees who conduct\r\npublic hearings, when the representatives of each department and\r\nthe official examiners report on their estimates and each item\r\nmay be examined and discussed. A tentative budget is printed for\r\npublic use and the last week in October public hearings are held. By\r\nNovember 1st the budget must be adopted by the Board of Estimate and\r\nApportionment and sent to the Board of Aldermen for their approval.\r\n\r\n“Pay as you go” was a financial policy adopted in 1914 to relieve the\r\ntremendous piling up of future indebtedness of the city for permanent\r\nimprovements of the non-revenue producing class. During the years\r\n1914-1918 an annually increasing proportion of the cost of these\r\nimprovements was to be included in the tax budget, and by 1918 the\r\nentire cost was to be met by taxation, and thereafter no bonds were\r\nto be issued for this class of improvement. Every dollar borrowed at\r\n4½ per cent. interest on a fifty-year bond costs $1.69 in interest\r\ncharges. While taxes are higher for a time under the pay-as-you-go\r\nplan, the actual cost of improvements to the city is much less.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of New York City is the head of a corporation whose\r\nbudget of expenditure, in 1916, was $212,000,000. Before the war\r\nthe general expenses of the United States Steel Corporation were\r\nabout $34,000,000 a year. The salary of the president of the Steel\r\nCorporation, or of any one of the largest business corporations of\r\nthe country, would be from $50,000 to $100,000 a year. The Mayor of\r\nNew York City receives $15,000 a year. But a business corporation\r\nwould insist on having for president a man whose training and\r\nbusiness experience had made him peculiarly fitted for the job,\r\nwhile our practice in choosing a man for mayor is to give little\r\nconsideration to special training and experience in the work of city\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSTATE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State has such large powers over its people, and over all\r\npolitical divisions within it, that it is often called the “Sovereign\r\nState.” The State regulates the ownership and transfer of property;\r\nit punishes murder and other crimes; it regulates business relations;\r\nit prescribes the form of marriage and the reasons for divorce; it\r\nauthorizes the levying of taxes; it makes its own election laws and\r\nprovides for education; until recently it has controlled railroads\r\noperating within its borders.\r\n\r\n=The State Constitution=, adopted by a majority of the voters of the\r\nState, is the fundamental law of the State. It can only be changed by\r\na constitutional convention or by the adoption of a constitutional\r\namendment, which is done with considerable difficulty.\r\n\r\nA constitutional convention is an assemblage of men chosen by the\r\nvoters to revise the constitution. The result of their deliberation\r\nis then submitted to the voters, who can accept or reject it. The\r\nlast revision took place in 1915 and was overwhelmingly defeated at\r\nthe polls. The law now provides for a revision every twenty years if\r\nthe voters desire it.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the constitution can be proposed in the Legislature.\r\nIt has to pass both houses of the Legislature during two different\r\nbut successive sessions (a new session of the Legislature comes only\r\nevery other year, when a new Senate is elected), and must then be\r\nsubmitted to the voters of the State for their approval. A majority\r\nvote makes it a law.\r\n\r\n=The Legislature= has authority under the State constitution to make\r\nlaws for the State. It meets every year on the first Wednesday in\r\nJanuary at the Capitol in Albany, and remains in session until its\r\nbusiness is completed, usually about April 1st. It is composed of two\r\ndivisions or “houses,” the Assembly and the Senate.\r\n\r\nEvery ten years, in a year ending with the figure five, a census is\r\ntaken of the people of the State, and on this basis there is a new\r\napportionment of Senators and Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n=The Senate= at present is composed of fifty-two members, elected\r\nfrom certain divisions of the State known as Senatorial Districts. In\r\ngeneral, each fiftieth of the population of the State is entitled to\r\none Senator. (This rule is not followed mathematically, for a county\r\nmay not be divided except to form two or more districts within it;\r\nno one county may have more than one-third of all the Senators, and\r\nno two counties may have more than one-half of the total number.\r\nThis is intended as a check to a congested district having an undue\r\nrepresentation.)\r\n\r\nIf a county which already has three or more Senators shows a\r\nsufficient increase in population to entitle it to another one,\r\nthe additional Senator adds one more to the fifty Senators already\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\n=The Assembly= is composed of one hundred and fifty members, and,\r\nroughly speaking, every one hundred and fiftieth part of the\r\npopulation of the State is entitled to one Assemblyman. In practice\r\nthe rural county of small or medium size which does not contain\r\na large city is one Assembly District. Chautauqua, Dutchess,\r\nSchenectady, Niagara, Orange, Rensselaer, St. Lawrence, Steuben,\r\nRichmond, Suffolk, and Broome have each two Assembly Districts.\r\nAlbany, Oneida, and Onondaga have three each; Queens has six;\r\nWestchester and Monroe, five; Bronx and Erie, eight; Kings and New\r\nYork, twenty-three each; Hamilton and Fulton counties have only\r\none between them. Nassau County has recently been divided into two\r\nAssembly Districts. This division is made by the County Board of\r\nSupervisors.\r\n\r\nThe presiding officer of the Senate is the _Lieutenant Governor_. The\r\npresiding officer of the Assembly is elected by its members, and is\r\ncalled the _Speaker_. He appoints the standing committees, and has\r\nmuch control over legislation. He usually belongs to the political\r\nparty which is in the majority in the Assembly. This party also\r\nelects a majority leader to control legislation on the floor. The\r\nchoice of the other party is called the _leader of the minority_, and\r\nhe is recognized as the leader of this party in the Legislature. The\r\nSenate also has majority and minority leaders.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen are elected for one year, and Senators for two years.\r\nBoth receive $1,500 salary and an allowance of ten cents a mile\r\ntraveling expenses once during the session.\r\n\r\n=How to Get a Law Passed by the Legislature=: A bill may be\r\nintroduced by any member, beginning, “The People of the State of New\r\nYork, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact,” etc.\r\n\r\nIt may be introduced into either the Senate or the Assembly, or it\r\ncan be introduced in both houses simultaneously. It has a first\r\nreading and is referred to a committee. The committee may pigeonhole\r\nit and never report, or it may report it too late in the session for\r\naction by the Legislature, or it may report it favorably, or with a\r\nrecommendation that it be rejected. If it is reported favorably it\r\nis put on the calendar to await its turn for consideration. It then\r\ncomes up for a second reading, when it may be amended and sent back\r\nto the committee; after a third reading a vote is taken. If it is\r\npassed in one house it then goes to the other house, where it goes\r\nthrough the same procedure. If it is passed by the second house,\r\nit then goes to the Governor for his signature. If it is a bill\r\nconcerning the government of a city it goes to the mayor of the city\r\nfor his approval.\r\n\r\nIf either house changes the bill it has to go back to the first house\r\nfor action in its amended form. The Governor has the power to veto a\r\nbill, but it can be repassed over his veto by a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\n=The Governor= is the chief executive officer of the State. It is\r\nhis business to enforce the laws, through his appointive officers.\r\nHe has control of the military forces of the State, which must\r\nconsist of not less than twenty thousand men, of whom two thousand\r\nmust be a naval militia. He has the power to grant pardons. He is\r\nelected for two years, and receives a salary of $10,000 and the use\r\nof the Executive Mansion. He may also initiate legislation. At every\r\nregular session of the Legislature his duty is to send a “message,”\r\ntelling the Legislature about the condition of public affairs and\r\nrecommending measures for their consideration. He may also, at any\r\ntime, ask for special legislation, and may call the Legislature\r\ntogether in an extra session. He has the power of many important\r\nappointments to State positions, but subject to the approval of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n=The Lieutenant Governor=, with a salary of $5,000 a year, takes the\r\nGovernor’s place in case of need. He presides over the Senate.\r\n\r\n=The Secretary of State= has charge of all public documents and\r\nrecords. He grants certificates of incorporation, and has charge of\r\nelections and the taking of the census. His salary is $6,000 a year.\r\n\r\n=The Comptroller= must sign every warrant for payment of State\r\nfunds. He acts as auditor for the State, reports to the Legislature\r\nconcerning State funds, and superintends the collection of State\r\ntaxes. He designates the banks in which State money shall be\r\ndeposited. His salary is $8,000 a year.\r\n\r\n=The State Treasurer= is the custodian of State funds, and pays them\r\nout only on order of the Comptroller. His salary is $6,000 a year.\r\n\r\n=The Attorney-General= is the general legal adviser of the State. He\r\nprosecutes and defends all actions in which the State is interested.\r\nHis salary is $10,000.\r\n\r\n=The State Engineer and Surveyor= must be a practical engineer. He\r\nhas charge of the canals, and the surveying and mapping of all the\r\npublic lands of the State.\r\n\r\n=Appointive Offices=: Among these are two _Public Service\r\nCommissions_, each with five members. The first has jurisdiction\r\nover Greater New York, and the second over the rest of the State.\r\nIn general, they have power to regulate railroads and street-cars,\r\nto establish rates, and to compel adequate service. They also\r\ncontrol express companies, gas and electrical companies, telephone\r\nand telegraph lines. No company can raise its rates without their\r\nconsent. Their business is to see that the needs of the public are\r\nadequately served, and also to protect the companies from unjust\r\ntreatment. These commissions are considered so important that the\r\nsalary of each commissioner was made $15,000 a year.\r\n\r\n=The State Tax Commissioners= have general supervision of the methods\r\nof raising taxes throughout the State. There are three of them\r\nappointed for three years, and they must visit every county in the\r\nState at least once in two years. Their salary is $6,000 a year each.\r\n\r\n=The State Board of Equalization=, which consists of the tax\r\ncommissioners and commissioners of the land office, has to equalize\r\nthe assessments in each county, and fix the amount on which the State\r\ntax is to be levied.\r\n\r\n=The Superintendent of Banks= controls the banks, trust companies,\r\nbuilding and loan associations, which make reports to him quarterly,\r\nfrom which he in turn makes a report to the Legislature annually. His\r\nsalary is $10,000, and his term three years.\r\n\r\n=The Superintendent of Insurance= has control over all the insurance\r\ncompanies and reports annually to the Legislature. His salary is\r\n$10,000, and term three years.\r\n\r\n=The Commissioner of Health= must be a physician. He has general\r\noversight of the health of the State, and supervises the registration\r\nof births, marriages, and deaths in the towns and cities. His salary\r\nis $8,000, and he has a four-year term.\r\n\r\n=The Commissioner of Excise= issues tax certificates for the sale of\r\nliquor and collects the excise tax, of which the State gets one-half,\r\nand the city or town in which the liquor is sold gets one-half. His\r\nsalary is $7,000, term five years.\r\n\r\n=The Commissioner of Agriculture= appoints the directors of farmers’\r\ninstitutes, watches over the sale of food products that might be\r\ninjurious to health, and has general care of the agricultural needs\r\nof the State. His salary is $8,000, term three years.\r\n\r\n=The Commissioner of Highways=, who is in charge of State roads and\r\nimprovements, serves for two years with a salary of $12,000 a year.\r\n\r\n=The Department of Labor=, which is a very important branch of the\r\nState government, works to improve the conditions of labor. There\r\nare five commissioners who serve six years, each with a salary of\r\n$8,000. In this department are several bureaus: _viz._, Inspection,\r\nEmployment, Workmen’s Compensation, Mediation and Arbitration,\r\nStatistics and Information, Industries, and Immigration.\r\n\r\n=The Conservation Commissioner= controls departments for preserving\r\nand propagating fish and game, for protecting lands and forests, and\r\nthe control of inland waters. He appoints a head for each division.\r\n(Forests owned by the State must be kept wild. They may not be\r\nloaned, sold, or exchanged, and no wood may be cut.) He serves six\r\nyears, with a salary of $8,000 a year.\r\n\r\n=The Civil Service Commission= consists of three commissioners who\r\nhave the duty of determining the rules with which to test the fitness\r\nof applicants for employment under the civil service laws. The civil\r\nservice is intended to prevent the appointment of men to government\r\npositions through partisan politics or personal “pull.” Positions are\r\nclassified, competitive examinations are held, and appointments made\r\nin order of merit. The custom has usually been to have separate lists\r\nmade out of men and women, and it has been complained that preference\r\nhas been given to the men’s lists.\r\n\r\nThere is a _Superintendent of Public Works_, with a salary of $8,000;\r\na _Superintendent of Prisons_, salary of $6,000, and a _State\r\nCommission of Prisons_ of seven members who get $10 a day each for\r\neach day of service; a _State Board of Charities_; a _State Hospital\r\nCommission in Lunacy_ of three members, the president of which is\r\npaid $7,000, and other members $5,000.\r\n\r\nThere is also a _State Food Commission_ of three members who serve\r\nwithout pay, appointed only for the period of the war, and a recently\r\ncreated _Farms and Markets Council_.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the heads of the administrative departments of the\r\nState government are appointed by the Governor, the terms of office\r\nof many of them are longer than the term of the Governor who\r\nappoints them. As a consequence, a Governor may be in office, and\r\nimportant departments like the Excise Commission, the Public Health\r\nand Public Service, and Industrial Commissions, may be in the hands\r\nof appointees of a preceding Governor. They can be removed from\r\noffice only by preferring charges and after a hearing. Also certain\r\nother important State officials, including the Comptroller and\r\nthe Secretary of State, are elected by the people, and may differ\r\nradically from the Governor on questions of public policy. They may\r\neven belong to a different political party.\r\n\r\nIt is by some considered a weakness in the management of the affairs\r\nof the State, that the conduct of some of the most important\r\ndepartments of an administration may be out of the control of the\r\nGovernor who is responsible for them.\r\n\r\nThe business of the State requires about 17,500 regular employees,\r\nand the payroll is about $22,250,000. It is probable that some of\r\nthese public officials in the service of the State might be dispensed\r\nwith if they were required to work as many hours a day and as many\r\ndays a year as they would be obliged to do in any private business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nNATIONAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sovereign power of the United States is vested in the National\r\ngovernment, the federal union of all the States, each self-governing,\r\nbut all uniting for certain purposes. The Constitution of the United\r\nStates is the supreme law of the land.\r\n\r\nThe National government, like that of the State and municipality,\r\nhas three distinct divisions: the legislative, the executive, and\r\nthe judicial. The legislative power rests with Congress, which is\r\ncomposed of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\r\n\r\n=The House of Representatives= is elected every two years by the\r\nvoters of the States. After the census, which is taken every ten\r\nyears, Congress determines what the total number of Representatives\r\nshall be. These are then apportioned among the States according to\r\npopulation. After the census of 1910 the House of Representatives\r\nwas increased to 435 members, which gave one member for every\r\n211,877 inhabitants. New York has 43 Representatives, the largest\r\nnumber from any State in the Union. Every State is entitled to at\r\nleast one Representative, although it may not have the requisite\r\npopulation. _The Congressional District_ from which a member is\r\nelected is determined by the State Legislature. Greater New York has\r\n23 Congressmen.\r\n\r\n=Qualifications for Representatives to Congress=: A man must be\r\ntwenty-five years old and have been a citizen of the United States\r\nfor at least seven years, and be a resident of the State from which\r\nhe is chosen. The salary is $7,500 a year, with an allowance for a\r\nclerk, for stationery, and for traveling expenses.\r\n\r\n=The Senate= is composed of ninety-six members, two members from\r\nevery State in the Union, elected for a term of six years. In order\r\nthat there shall always be experienced men in the Senate, only\r\none-third of that body is elected at a time. The Senate is divided\r\ninto three classes, and the men belonging to one of the three classes\r\nare elected every two years.\r\n\r\nA Senator may be re-elected as many times as a State chooses, and\r\nmany Senators have served twenty years or more. This makes the Upper\r\nHouse of Congress a very conservative, stable body of men. Senators,\r\nas well as Representatives, receive a salary of $7,500 a year. The\r\n_Vice-President_ of the United States is the presiding officer of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe election of Senators was formerly a prerogative of the State\r\nLegislature. The Seventeenth Amendment to the National Constitution,\r\npassed in 1913, provides that they shall be elected by direct voice\r\nof the voters of the States.\r\n\r\n=Qualifications of Senators=: A candidate for the Senate must be\r\nthirty years old and have been a citizen for at least nine years.\r\n\r\n=Sessions of Congress=: A new Congress comes into existence on the\r\nfourth day of March every odd year, although it does not meet in\r\nregular session until the following winter. The long session begins\r\nthe first Monday in December in the odd-numbered year, and usually\r\nlasts until spring or summer. The short session begins the same time\r\nin the even-numbered year and lasts until the following March 4th,\r\nwhen the new Congress, elected the previous November, comes into\r\nexistence, although it does not meet until the following December,\r\nunless the President calls an extraordinary session. A Congressman,\r\ntherefore, is elected more than a year before he takes his seat. The\r\nSixty-fifth Congress will end March 4, 1919. The members of the Lower\r\nHouse of the Sixty-sixth Congress will be elected in November, 1918.\r\n\r\n=Congressional Committees=: The work of Congress is largely done\r\nthrough committees. The House of Representatives, as constituted\r\nto-day, is an unwieldy body. It is obvious that four hundred and\r\nthirty-five men is too large a number to work effectively as a whole.\r\nEvery bill, even a recommendation from the President, is referred to\r\nan appropriate committee. It is only because of these many committees\r\nthat it is possible to transact the very large amount of business\r\nthat comes before Congress every year.\r\n\r\n=How a Bill Is Passed=: The procedure in Congress is similar to that\r\nin the State Legislature. A bill may be introduced by any member in\r\neither house, and must pass through both houses.\r\n\r\n=Powers of Congress=: Congress has absolute power to levy and collect\r\ntaxes. Revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\r\nCongress has the exclusive power to declare war, to raise and\r\nsupport an army and navy, and to regulate commerce. It controls\r\nnaturalization laws and immigration; it establishes post-offices;\r\ngrants patents and copyrights. It has the power to coin and to borrow\r\nmoney. It also governs the District of Columbia and the Territories.\r\n\r\n=An Amendment to the Constitution of the United States= must be\r\npassed by a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast in both houses\r\nof Congress. It is then submitted to the States for ratification by\r\nthe State Legislatures. When the Legislatures of three-fourths of the\r\nforty-eight States have ratified such an amendment by a majority vote\r\nof their members it becomes law.\r\n\r\n=The Executive=: The President of the United States has greater\r\npowers than have the heads of many other nations. He is the\r\nCommander-in-chief of the Army and Navy; he conducts official\r\nbusiness with foreign nations and makes treaties with them, subject\r\nto the approval of the Senate; he appoints, with the consent of the\r\nSenate, ambassadors, ministers, high officials of Army and Navy,\r\njustices of the Supreme Court, and a vast number of other officers.\r\nHe may veto measures passed by Congress, but they can be passed over\r\nhis veto by a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nThe President has power to initiate legislation by sending a message\r\nto Congress, giving them information about important affairs and\r\nrecommending legislative measures for their consideration. The degree\r\nto which he can force legislation through Congress depends both on\r\nthe strength of the party in Congress to which he belongs, and on\r\nthe personal power and prestige of the President himself. President\r\nWilson is the first President, for more than a century, to appear in\r\nperson before a joint session of Congress and read his message.\r\n\r\n=Election of the President=: The President is chosen by presidential\r\nelectors, elected by the voters of the various States, the number\r\nof electors for each State being the same as the total number of\r\nRepresentatives and Senators in Congress from that State. The\r\nelectors of a State meet at the State Capitol on the second Monday of\r\nJanuary following the election, to cast their votes for President.\r\nThe electors are merely machines to register the vote of the State,\r\nand usually the entire electoral vote of a State goes to one\r\ncandidate, although the majority of the popular vote for him may have\r\nbeen small. This system makes the presidential election virtually\r\nan election by States. A State “goes” Republican or Democratic. The\r\nstruggle is concentrated in a few doubtful States. To win or lose\r\nthem may mean to win or lose the election. It has happened that\r\none candidate has actually received a larger popular vote than his\r\nopponent, and yet has not been elected, because the number of votes\r\nin the electoral college from the States that gave him a majority was\r\nsmaller than the number of electoral votes from the other States.\r\nThere is a movement toward the abolition of the electoral college and\r\ndirect nomination and direct election of the President by the voters.\r\n\r\n=The Vice-President= must be eligible to the office of President. He\r\nis elected for the same term, and his salary is $12,000 a year. His\r\nonly duty is to preside over the Senate and to succeed the President\r\nin case of need.\r\n\r\n=The Cabinet= consists of ten officials appointed by the President\r\nwith the consent of the Senate to conduct for him certain departments\r\nof public business. The salary of a Cabinet member is $12,000.\r\n\r\nCabinet members have no vote in either House of Congress, and are not\r\nresponsible to it in any way. Like the President himself, they may\r\nbelong to the party which is in the minority in Congress. The Cabinet\r\nis an advisory body to the President, but its members have no legal\r\nstanding in that way, and he may ignore them if he chooses. Each\r\nCabinet officer is the administrative head of his department.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State heads the Department of State, and is\r\nresponsible for all official negotiations and relations with foreign\r\ngovernments. He is the medium of communication between the President\r\nand the Governors of the States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury manages national finances, administers\r\nrevenue, currency, and national banking laws.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War has charge of all matters of national defense,\r\nriver and harbor improvements, and is responsible for the maintenance\r\nof the Army.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General is the legal adviser of the President and the\r\nNational government.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General conducts the affairs of the United States\r\nPost-Office Department and the transportation of the mail.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy has charge of the Navy and its equipment,\r\nyards, and docks.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior and his department have charge of\r\npublic lands and Indian affairs. He has the granting of pensions and\r\npatents.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Agriculture has for his business the improvement of\r\nagriculture in the United States. He also has charge of the Weather\r\nBureau, animal and plant industry, and the forest service.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Commerce must aid and develop the commercial\r\ninterests of the country, including mining and transportation. He\r\ntakes the census every ten years.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Labor and the Department of Labor are designed to\r\nprotect the welfare of the wage earners. To this department belong\r\nthe Bureau of Immigration and the Children’s Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the past few years has been to enlarge the powers\r\nof the National government. With the rapid increase of means of\r\ntransportation distant parts of the country have been brought close\r\ntogether. Sectionalism is diminishing. To “States’ rights” is being\r\nadded a national pride. In the administration of the business of the\r\nnation, State boundaries can often no longer be considered without\r\na distinct loss of economy and efficiency. To give one example: the\r\nState control of railroads resulted in obstructive and entirely\r\ndifferent requirements being made by neighboring States, on the same\r\nrailroad passing through several of them. The power of separate\r\nStates to control, independent of each other, such things as marriage\r\nand divorce laws, has resulted in the deplorable situation that a\r\ncouple may be legally married in one State and the marriage may not\r\nbe recognized in another.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that with the growth in influence and importance of the\r\nUnited States, the National government is gradually assuming many\r\nfunctions which formerly were left to the separate States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWHO CAN VOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one way in which the government of a republic like the\r\nUnited States differs from other forms of government—_viz._, in\r\na republic _the source of all power rests with the people_. They\r\nchoose the men to whom they give the right to speak for them and to\r\nrepresent them.\r\n\r\nThe right to vote for the man who is to represent you, who is to make\r\nthe law for you and to enforce that law, is the most sacred right of\r\na free country.\r\n\r\nThe success or failure of government in the United States, and in\r\nevery political division of the State, rests with the men and women\r\nwho have the power of the vote.\r\n\r\nOne of the great dangers of a democracy is the carelessness and\r\nindifference of the voter. If a government “by the people” is to\r\nbe a success, the people themselves must see to it that honest,\r\nresponsible, and efficient officials are chosen.\r\n\r\n=Every Person in the State Is Either a Citizen or an Alien.\r\nCitizenship Is Conferred by the National Government and the State Has\r\nNo Power to Confer or Withhold It.=\r\n\r\n=A Citizen= is defined in the Constitution of the United States: “All\r\npersons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the\r\njurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the\r\nState in which they reside.” Native-born Indians who have had land\r\nallotted them and have given up their tribal life are citizens. All\r\npersons born out of the country of citizen parents are also citizens,\r\nexcept where the father has never resided in the United States.\r\n\r\n=Naturalization=: Congress makes uniform laws of naturalization for\r\nall the States.\r\n\r\n=An Alien= is a person born in a foreign country who lives here but\r\nis still a subject of some other country.\r\n\r\n=An Alien May Become a Citizen= of the United States, and thus\r\nof New York State, after he has lived in the country five years\r\ncontinuously, and in the State one year. He must be able to write his\r\nown language, to read and speak English, and be of moral character.\r\nHis first step is to go to a Federal court, or a court of record,\r\nand swear that it is his intention to become a citizen and renounce\r\nhis allegiance to any foreign power. He is then given his “first\r\npapers.” Not less than two years, or more than seven years later, he\r\nmust appear again with two witnesses to swear to his good character\r\nand loyalty, and file a petition. After ninety days his application\r\nis heard by the court and he is examined by the judge and renews\r\nhis oath of allegiance. If the judge is satisfied he is given his\r\ncertificate of naturalization which makes him a citizen. Fees\r\namounting to five dollars are now charged.\r\n\r\n=Only White Persons and Negroes May Become Naturalized=: Chinese,\r\nJapanese and East Indians cannot become citizens unless born in the\r\nUnited States. Polygamists are excluded.\r\n\r\n=An Unmarried Woman= can take out papers of naturalization and become\r\na citizen in the same way as does a man.\r\n\r\n=A Married Woman= is only a citizen if her husband is a citizen.\r\nUnder the present law, she cannot become naturalized by herself.\r\nAlso, under a strict interpretation of the law, she has the residence\r\nof her husband and must vote from the same place.\r\n\r\n=A Woman Born= in the =United States= who =marries= an =alien=,\r\nalthough she may never leave her own country, =ceases to be an\r\nAmerican citizen= and becomes a subject of the country to which\r\nher husband belongs. Therefore, the wife of a man not a citizen of\r\nthe United States cannot vote in this country.[2] If a resident of\r\nthe United States, she resumes her citizenship at the death of her\r\nhusband, or if she is divorced. =A foreign-born woman= who =marries=\r\na =citizen becomes= a =citizen=. Children under age become citizens\r\nwith their parents.\r\n\r\nAn American-born man may live abroad many years and not lose his\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nA naturalized citizen is considered as losing his citizenship if he\r\nreturns to his native country and resides there two years.\r\n\r\nA citizen has the right to withdraw from the United States, renounce\r\nhis allegiance, and acquire citizenship in another country.\r\n\r\nAn alien enjoys the same protection of the law as does the citizen.\r\nThe government extends its protection to the native-born and the\r\nnaturalized citizen alike. A naturalized citizen is protected while\r\nabroad, even in his native country, by our government in exactly\r\nthe same degree as a native-born citizen would be. A naturalized\r\ncitizen may fill any office in the land with the exception of that of\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n=A Citizen Is Not Always a Voter=: Women were citizens of New York\r\nState before they were given the right to vote, if (1) they were\r\nborn in the United States, (2) were married to citizens, or (3) if,\r\nunmarried, they had taken out their own naturalization papers.\r\n\r\n=The State Confers the Right to Vote and Fixes the Qualifications for\r\nVoters.=\r\n\r\n=Who May Vote=: “Every citizen of the age of twenty-one years who\r\nshall have been a citizen for ninety days, an inhabitant of the State\r\nfor one year, and a resident of the county for four months, and a\r\nresident of the election district for thirty days, has a right to\r\nvote” (Act II, Sec. I, Constitution of New York State). Foreign-born\r\nwomen whose husbands are citizens must live in the country five\r\nyears before they can vote. In time of war soldiers and sailors may\r\nvote wherever they are, and their ballots are counted in their home\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable that a certain length of residence should be\r\nrequired before a person is permitted to vote, in order that he may\r\nhave a chance to become familiar with the interests of a community,\r\nand acquainted with the qualifications of the candidates.\r\n\r\n=Who May Not Vote=: A naturalized citizen who has not been\r\nnaturalized for at least ninety days before election; a person whose\r\nname and address is not registered with election officials at least\r\nten days before an election; a person convicted of bribery or an\r\ninfamous crime; a deserter from the Army or Navy. A person who bets\r\non an election is disqualified for voting at that election.\r\n\r\nThe Governor may restore citizenship to a person who has lost it.\r\n\r\n=The State Cannot Interfere with the Rights of Citizens=: While\r\nthe State prescribes the qualifications for suffrage for its own\r\ncitizens, by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the National\r\nConstitution, the Federal government prohibits any State from\r\nabridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United\r\nStates, and declares that the State in making the qualifications for\r\nthe suffrage cannot discriminate because of _color_ or _race_.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment further provides that when the right to\r\nvote is denied to any of the male citizens of a State, its basis of\r\nrepresentation shall be reduced in proportion.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Southern States have restricted the suffrage by\r\neducational and property qualifications, but have excluded from these\r\nqualifications those who were voters in 1867 (before the negroes\r\nwere enfranchised) and their descendants. This discrimination of\r\nthe so-called “grandfather” clause was held unconstitutional by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in 1915, but the reduction\r\nin representation has never been enforced. Massachusetts has an\r\neducational qualification and Pennsylvania a tax qualification, which\r\nalso exclude many male citizens; but the Fourteenth Amendment has\r\nnever been seriously enforced in either case.\r\n\r\n=The National Amendment for Woman Suffrage=: An amendment to the\r\nFederal Constitution is pending which provides that the _right to\r\nvote shall not be denied on account of sex_.\r\n\r\nWhile New York State has given the vote to its women, this permission\r\ndoes not extend beyond its borders. New York women lose their vote\r\nif they go to Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or any adjoining State.\r\nTwelve States have given women full suffrage, and nineteen States\r\nhave given them the right to vote for President. The Woman Suffrage\r\nAmendment, when passed by Congress and ratified by three-fourths of\r\nall the States, will secure the right to vote to all the women of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] A bill is now before Congress to change this law and make it\r\npossible for a married woman to choose her country for herself, as a\r\nman does, and to require that she be obliged to go through the same\r\nprocess of naturalization that a man does, including the oath of\r\nallegiance. It is only through a Federal law that this change can be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nA political party is a group of voters organized for the purpose\r\nof putting certain policies into effect, to elect certain men to\r\noffice, and to control the machinery of government. Under a popular\r\ngovernment, where public officials are chosen by the people and\r\npolitical policies are formulated by them, political parties have\r\nseemed the most expedient device as yet discovered to accomplish\r\nthese ends.\r\n\r\nThe political party was not originally a part of the government;\r\nbut as the country developed and government needs and opportunities\r\nmultiplied, party machinery grew more complex, and its powers\r\nincreased to such a dangerous degree that for the sake of its own\r\nintegrity, the State was forced to regulate it. Party conventions,\r\nprimaries, and much of the party machinery are now controlled by law.\r\n\r\n=Two Parties=: The United States has always had two principal\r\nparties. They have had different names, and under the same name they\r\nhave advocated different principles. The first parties were the\r\nFederalists, who believed in a strong central government that should\r\nexercise all the powers that the Constitution could be interpreted\r\nto permit, and the Anti-Federalists, who believed in limiting the\r\nfunctions of the Federal government and reserving as much power as\r\npossible to the States.\r\n\r\n=The Republican and Democratic Parties=: It is difficult to define\r\nthe difference between the present principal parties. The Republican\r\nparty is the successor of the Federalists. It was formed shortly\r\nbefore the Civil War to prevent the extension of slavery. In\r\ngeneral it has believed in a liberal interpretation of the Federal\r\nConstitution, and has wished to see the powers of the National\r\ngovernment extended. The Democratic party has advocated “States’\r\nrights,” the right of the individual States to settle their own\r\naffairs. It has held to a strict interpretation of the Constitution,\r\nand has believed in limiting the power of the National government.\r\nBesides the doctrine of States’ rights, the principal difference\r\nbetween the Republican and Democratic parties has been the tariff.\r\nThe Republican party has advocated a high tariff, and the Democratic\r\nparty a tariff “for revenue only.” While these have been the two\r\nissues most discussed between the two parties, even on these\r\nquestions the lines have often been confused. Democratic members\r\nof Congress have advocated measures which distinctly contradicted\r\nthe principles of States’ rights, and the Republican party as often\r\nhas adopted them for its own purposes. The Democratic party has not\r\nalways stood on its low-tariff platform, and Republicans have often\r\nbeen against protection. Even before the present war old party lines\r\nhad begun to fade. With the dangers threatening the country, which\r\nwar has brought, these lines have been almost obliterated. What they\r\nwill be when the war is over no one can predict with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party came into power in 1860, when it elected\r\nAbraham Lincoln President, and until 1913 it controlled the National\r\ngovernment, except for two terms of four years each when Grover\r\nCleveland was President.\r\n\r\nIn general the Southern States are Democratic, preserving a “solid\r\nSouth.” The Northern States are apt to be Republican.\r\n\r\n=The Progressive Party= was organized in 1912 as the result of a\r\nsplit in the Republican ranks, by men who wanted more progressive\r\nmeasures than those advocated by either the Republican or Democratic\r\nparty. It advocated public ownership of mines, forests, and water\r\npower; a larger measure of justice for the working-classes and\r\nsuffrage for women. It has disintegrated, but it had a large effect\r\nin liberalizing both the older parties, and many of its policies have\r\nbeen adopted by them.\r\n\r\n=The Prohibition Party= was organized in 1872 to bring about complete\r\nprohibition of alcoholic drinks. It has elected candidates to the\r\nLegislature and has secured an ever larger measure of local option\r\nand even State-wide prohibition.\r\n\r\n=The Socialist Party=, organized in 1900, advocates government\r\nownership of land, railroads, telegraph and telephones, mines,\r\nand all vital industries. It has become largely the party of the\r\nindustrial workers.\r\n\r\nMinor parties have come and gone, but they have usually left a\r\nlasting effect on the dominant parties.\r\n\r\nIn New York State, any organization is considered “a party” which\r\npolled at least 10,000 votes for Governor at the last election.\r\n\r\n=Party Organization=: The individual voter, or group of voters, is\r\nhelpless to change conditions or to elect a man. It is only through\r\nthe organization of many men who want the same thing that they become\r\neffective. Political parties are organized for National, State, and\r\nlocal campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe great work of the political parties is the nomination and\r\nelection of a President every four years. For this purpose there must\r\nbe a national party organization.\r\n\r\n=The National Committee= of each party is composed of one member from\r\neach State. It organizes the National Convention of the party, which\r\nis held early in the summer before the presidential election, and at\r\nwhich party policies are formulated, and candidates for President\r\nand Vice-President are nominated. In the spring the chairman of the\r\nNational Committee calls a meeting of this committee to decide where\r\nand when the convention shall meet.\r\n\r\nBesides nominating candidates for President and Vice-President, the\r\nconvention adopts a “platform” in which is set forth the principles\r\nwhich the party holds and its attitude on important public questions.\r\nA new National Committee is appointed to carry on the campaign and\r\nto act until the next convention.\r\n\r\nThe platform adopted by the party at its National convention is an\r\nexpression of the principles for which the party stands. A “plank”\r\nmay be put in simply to catch votes; on some question the plank may\r\nnot be explicit, but may “straddle” the issue. While in the main the\r\nNational platform sets forth the principles to which the party is\r\ncommitted and its proposals for future action, the speech or letter\r\nof acceptance of the candidate for the presidency usually contains a\r\nmore reliable statement of the policies which he would advocate if\r\nelected.\r\n\r\n=The State Committee= is the party organization in control of the\r\nparty in the State. It is composed of one man from each of the one\r\nhundred and fifty Assembly Districts in the State, who are elected by\r\nthe enrolled members of the party in each district. The chairman is\r\nelected by the committee to serve for two years.\r\n\r\nParty members are all those who at the last registration, or last\r\ngeneral election, enrolled in the party.\r\n\r\nState platforms count for little. They usually “point with pride” to\r\nthings the party has done, and denounce the acts of the opposing\r\nparty. Most voters pay little attention to them.\r\n\r\n=The County Committee= consists of one man from every election\r\ndistrict in the county; the _City Committee_, one from each ward\r\nor election district in the city. (New York County has its own\r\norganization, different from the others.) The chairman of each of\r\nthese committees is elected at the party primaries. He is usually an\r\nexperienced politician, and each committee is the party authority\r\nlocally.\r\n\r\n=The Election District=: The election district captain, or county\r\ncommitteeman, is the man who comes in direct personal touch with the\r\nvoter. His business is to deliver the vote of his election district\r\nto his party. He must know every voter in his district, find out how\r\neach one is going to vote, and keep track of new voters, especially\r\nthe first voter who has yet to choose his party. He is an inspector\r\nat elections; he selects poll clerks and watchers, and handles the\r\nmoney sent by his party to his district. The Assembly District\r\nleader or County Chairman distributes the patronage and the election\r\ndistrict captain may recommend men to him. The more offices that can\r\nbe filled, and the greater the number of “the faithful” who can\r\nbe provided for, the stronger the party at the next election. The\r\none quality necessary for the election district captain is complete\r\nloyalty to his chairman and party.\r\n\r\nIf ordinary party members pay no attention to the organization\r\nlocally it is bound to fall into the hands of those who make their\r\nliving out of politics.\r\n\r\n=Party Funds= are contributed by members of the party, subscriptions\r\nfrom interested men, from party candidates and interests which expect\r\nto be benefited if a certain party comes into power.\r\n\r\nIt is a crime to levy on the salary of any public official for\r\ncampaign expenses, but such contributions are often still expected.\r\n\r\nIf a party elects its candidate, he has many officials to appoint,\r\nand these offices are often unfortunately regarded as rewards for\r\nparty loyalty and work. The civil service was created to take offices\r\naway from party control and prevent the “spoils system.”\r\n\r\n=The Use and Abuse of Party=: The political party has a very\r\ndefinite place in popular government. In the conduct of a campaign\r\norganization is indispensable. The danger lies in the difficulty\r\nof sufficiently safeguarding the interests of the public from the\r\nspoilsmen of either party. It is through the party that citizens\r\nmust work for political measures, but it is also through the party\r\nmachine that anti-social forces are able to successfully carry out\r\ntheir plans.\r\n\r\nThere is tremendous power for a party in its control of the\r\ngovernment of a city or a State. A multitude of offices have to\r\nbe filled, franchises to be granted, valuable contracts let, and\r\nthere are a thousand opportunities for public plunder and private\r\nenrichment. The party in power nationally, has untold possibilities\r\nin the control of the fabulous resources of the country. In order\r\nthat a party may come into power in the National government, it is\r\nnecessary for it to be in control in the State, and to control the\r\nState it tries to hold minor political divisions. To gain control\r\nlocally it partitions out the offices where they will do the most\r\ngood; it gains support from every quarter through any means; it seeks\r\nto have men in positions of authority who can be so controlled that\r\nthey will subordinate everything to the party welfare.\r\n\r\nThe average voter not infrequently supports his party at all\r\nelections, without regard for the merits of the candidates. He is\r\noften a Republican or a Democrat, without any clear idea of the\r\ndifferent principles of the two parties. Or he may have become a\r\nRepublican or a Democrat because he agreed with the party in regard\r\nto some National question. So he follows it blindly in State and city\r\nelections, which have nothing to do with National questions. It is\r\nseldom that important issues of party principles are involved in a\r\nlocal election; but the tradition of party support is strong and the\r\ntemptation to hold party allegiance even at the expense of the public\r\nis almost irresistible.\r\n\r\n=The Independent Voter=: Undoubtedly the number of independent voters\r\nis growing. Whenever for any reason a group of non-partisan voters\r\nabstain from party allegiance, are alert to the sincerity of party\r\npromises, and are watchful of the qualifications of candidates, both\r\nparties begin to clean house and put up as candidates the best men\r\navailable, in order to bid for the independent vote. Such a body\r\nof non-partisan voters may be the decisive factor in an election,\r\nespecially if the two parties are about evenly divided.\r\n\r\nThe independent voter is not popular with the machine politician. The\r\nlarger the number of non-partisan voters the more difficult it is for\r\nhim to perform his duties, and to control and deliver the vote.\r\n\r\nIn city and village elections, party issues have no place, and there\r\nis a growing feeling that qualification for office should be the only\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt all comes back to the voting citizen. Politics and political\r\nparties are what the people make them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nHOW CANDIDATES ARE NOMINATED\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile any man’s name can be put in nomination for any office, he has\r\nlittle chance of being elected in most elections without being the\r\ncandidate of a political party. For a long time parties were allowed\r\nto nominate candidates as they chose, and party bosses dictated\r\nnominations without regard for the wishes of the rest of the party\r\nor for the interests of the public. For some time past the State has\r\nregulated the methods of nominations.\r\n\r\nCandidates for all offices are nominated in one of three ways: (1) At\r\na party convention; (2) by direct primaries; (3) by petition.\r\n\r\n=Candidates for President and Vice-President= are nominated at\r\nNational conventions, which are the most spectacular events of our\r\npolitical life. Delegates to the National convention are elected\r\nat special party primaries held the first Tuesday in April of the\r\npresidential year. Every State is allowed double as many delegates\r\nas it has Senators and Representatives in Congress. The four men\r\ncorresponding to the representation of the State in the Senate are\r\ndelegates-at-large; the others are district delegates. The National\r\nconvention is, therefore, composed of about one thousand delegates,\r\nand its meetings draw other thousands of spectators. There are few\r\nauditoriums in the country big enough to house the convention. There\r\nare usually several candidates, each one of whom is the choice of a\r\ngroup of men in the party. The name of each candidate is presented to\r\nthe convention by a carefully selected orator, under circumstances\r\nplanned to arouse enthusiasm, and, if possible, to stampede the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nA majority vote is sufficient to nominate the candidate in the\r\nRepublican convention, but the Democratic party requires a two-thirds\r\nvote. Sometimes not one of the candidates presented is able to secure\r\na majority. Days may be consumed in discussion and bargaining, and in\r\nthe end an unexpected candidate, a “dark horse,” may be nominated.\r\nThe members of the National Committee who are to serve during the\r\nnext four years are elected in the convention, one member from each\r\nState.\r\n\r\n=How Candidates for Office in New York State Are Nominated=: The\r\ndirect primary is the method now used in New York State by which\r\ncandidates for all offices except those in towns and villages are\r\nnominated, and the conduct of these “official primaries,” as they\r\nare called to distinguish them from the unofficial primaries of the\r\nparty, is carefully prescribed by State law. A primary election is\r\nheld thirty days before the general election, and is conducted on the\r\nsame plan and in the same general way as the election. Candidates of\r\neach party for all the elected offices are nominated by the enrolled\r\nparty members. At the same time leaders for the district of each\r\npolitical party are elected. The ballots for each party are printed\r\nby the State and differ in color. The candidates whose names are\r\nprinted on the primary ballot are designated by party committees, and\r\nother persons may have their names added by petition.\r\n\r\n=Who May Vote at the Official Primaries—Enrolment of Voters=:\r\nOnly those who have enrolled themselves as members of the party\r\nare permitted to vote at the official primaries. At the time of\r\nthe registration of voters in the cities, or at the last general\r\nelection in the country, voters are given a party enrolment blank to\r\nfill out. These enrolments are placed in sealed envelopes and opened\r\na week after the regular election, when enrolment lists of each party\r\nare made out. Such enrolment is not compulsory, but unless a voter\r\nenrolls he is not able to take part in the nomination of candidates.\r\nBy enrolling he does not pledge himself to vote the party ticket at\r\nthe election (except in the case of the Socialist party); but he is\r\nallowed to vote at the primary for candidates of the party in which\r\nhe enrolls.\r\n\r\n=Objections to Direct Primaries= are made that few voters take the\r\ntrouble to vote at them, and that the choice of candidates is very\r\nlimited and is still controlled by party leaders. They are also very\r\nexpensive for a candidate, especially if he is not backed by these\r\nleaders. To stand any chance of nomination a candidate has to canvass\r\nthe voters and make himself known to them. A poor man cannot afford\r\nto enter a contest in a direct primary unless funds are supplied him\r\nor unless he expects to recoup himself later at the public expense.\r\nAlso, as that candidate wins the primary election who receives the\r\nlargest number of votes, the successful candidate may be one who\r\nhas had the votes of only a small proportion of the party which is\r\nexpected to support him later at the polls.\r\n\r\nSo far in New York State the primaries, even in city elections, are\r\nlargely party affairs. The suggestion has been advanced that city\r\nprimaries should be strictly non-partisan, and that party emblems\r\nshould be eliminated from the primary ballots.\r\n\r\n=Nomination by a Convention= is a method still used in some States,\r\nand until it was superseded by the direct primary it used to be\r\nthe manner of nominating candidates in New York. An official party\r\nconvention is made up of delegates elected by members of the party\r\nfrom the different parts of the State. Names of possible candidates\r\nare presented to the members in open convention, who express their\r\nchoice by ballot.\r\n\r\n=Objections to the Convention System= are based on the fact that the\r\nregular party convention is usually controlled by a few leaders who\r\ndecide beforehand every detail of the business of the convention and\r\nmake up the slate. They may trade with another group and concede part\r\nof the ticket to them in return for certain concessions which they\r\nmay obtain for themselves. The delegates are often there simply to\r\nfollow orders and to nominate the men agreed upon by the party bosses.\r\n\r\nThe “slate” is the list of candidates for the various offices to be\r\nfilled. Nominations for these positions are usually influenced not\r\nso much by the qualifications of the men proposed for office, as by\r\nthe ability of the proposed candidates to get out the vote and to add\r\nstrength to the ticket, also by geographical considerations, that\r\neach part of the State or district may be represented on the ticket.\r\n\r\nUnofficial State conventions are still held by the leading parties\r\nin New York. Their principal business is to frame a platform. This\r\nconvention also appoints the central committee.\r\n\r\n=The Primary Is Important to Every Voter= because it is there that\r\npolicies are determined and party leaders elected, as well as\r\ncandidates nominated for offices. Unless the members of the party\r\ntake the trouble to vote at the primary, the choice of candidates is\r\nleft to the few leaders who make a business of politics. This leaves\r\nthe field clear for “the boss” to put up candidates whom he can\r\ncontrol after election.\r\n\r\nThe vote at the primary election is always small. The proportion of\r\nvoters who vote for the nomination of candidates is often as low as\r\n18 or 20 per cent. of the vote cast at the election. The reason for\r\nthis is not difficult to understand. The primary election comes at a\r\ntime when little public interest has yet been aroused in the coming\r\nelection. By election-time the voters have been circularized and\r\ncanvassed and the newspapers have devoted much space to the subject.\r\nAlso much more effort is made by the party to get out the vote at\r\nelection-time than at the primary. Party leaders can count on the\r\nfaithful coming to the primary election without urging, and they are\r\nthe ones who often choose the candidates.\r\n\r\n=Nomination by Petition=: Most candidates on the ballot are nominated\r\nby a party, but a man may also be nominated by a petition of\r\nindependent voters. The petition must contain the title of the office\r\nto be filled, the name and address of the candidate, and be signed by\r\na certain number of voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nELECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nLaws concerning the holding of elections have grown much more\r\nstringent in the last few years. Every detail of the casting of a\r\nballot is now prescribed by law and every precaution taken to insure\r\nhonesty of elections. The precautions apply more to cities than to\r\nrural communities, with the result that more corruption may sometimes\r\nbe found to-day in country elections than in those in cities.\r\n\r\n=Registration of Voters=: In large places or densely populated\r\ndistricts it is impossible for the election officials to know every\r\nvoter, therefore the law requires that in cities and villages of over\r\nfive thousand inhabitants every voter shall appear every year before\r\nthe board of registration and have his name put on the registration\r\nlist. He is required to answer certain questions as to his age, his\r\nexact residence, his business, and where his last vote was cast, and\r\nto sign his own name for purposes of identification and to prevent\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\nIn smaller places and in rural districts, the signature is not\r\nrequired, and after a man’s name is once registered it remains on\r\nthe book as long as the voter remains in the district. In practice\r\nit remains on the book until some one takes it off; and the names\r\nof men who have died or moved away are frequently found in a rural\r\nregistration book.\r\n\r\n=Time of Elections=: The general elections take place in the fall,\r\non the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. National\r\nelections for President and Vice-President take place every four\r\nyears, in the year that ends with the figure four or its multiple.\r\nElections for representatives to Congress and State elections are\r\nheld the same day every two years, in the even-numbered years. City\r\nelections are held the same day in the odd-numbered years. City\r\nelections are held separate from State elections in order to keep\r\nNational and State issues from intruding in the election of municipal\r\nofficers. Local elections usually take place the same day, with the\r\nexception of the spring village election and town meeting.\r\n\r\n=The Election District=: For convenience every county or city is\r\ndivided into election districts, each with one polling-place. The\r\naverage number of voters to an election district in New York State is\r\nfrom two hundred and fifty to four hundred. When a district grows to\r\nfive hundred voters it is usually divided. In Chicago, since women\r\nwere given the vote, an election district contains from five to six\r\nhundred voters. It has been found that the women vote at the hours\r\nwhen men are busy, and that the same election officials can handle\r\nmany more votes than is customary in New York.\r\n\r\n=Election Officers=: Boards of elections, appointed by the county\r\nboard of supervisors, are in general charge of the elections in the\r\ncounty, and there is a State Superintendent of Elections appointed\r\nby the Governor. At each polling-place on Election Day there is an\r\nelection board consisting of four election inspectors, two ballot\r\nclerks, and two poll clerks. The law provides that election boards\r\nand boards of registration shall consist of equal representatives\r\nfrom the two political parties that cast the highest number of\r\nvotes at the last election. This does not apply to town and village\r\nelections. Each party also is allowed two watchers. A railing shuts\r\nin the voting-booths and tables, and no one but the election board\r\nand the official watchers is allowed under the law to be inside this\r\nrailing.\r\n\r\nThe polls are open from six o’clock in the morning until five o’clock\r\nin the afternoon. Before voting begins the ballot-boxes are opened\r\nand inspected to see that they are empty. The official watchers\r\nhave a right to see everything that is done. Electioneering is\r\nforbidden within one hundred feet of the polls. The voting-booths are\r\nconstructed so as to insure privacy while the voter is marking his\r\nballot, and the ballot is folded so that no one but the voter himself\r\nknows how he has voted.\r\n\r\n=The Election=: When the voter appears to cast his ballot, he gives\r\nhis name and address, and the registration book is consulted to see\r\nthat he is registered, the number of the ballot given to him is\r\ncalled out by the ballot clerk, and his name and the number of his\r\nballot are entered in the poll-book.\r\n\r\nOfficial ballots are provided for every polling-place, twice as many\r\nas there are registered voters in the district.\r\n\r\nAll the candidates for one office are grouped together on the ballot,\r\neach name with a blank square beside it. To vote for a candidate the\r\nvoter must make a cross with a lead-pencil (not ink) inside of the\r\nbox beside the name of the candidate: [Illustration: X in box]. If\r\nthe cross extends beyond the box, or if the word “yes” is written,\r\nif the ballot is erased or in any way defaced, it will be thrown out\r\nat the count as void. If a voter spoils a ballot he should ask for\r\nanother one. An illiterate person is allowed assistance in marking\r\nhis ballot.\r\n\r\nWhen the voter comes out of the booth, where he has marked his ballot\r\nin secret and folded it so it cannot be read, he gives the ballot\r\nto an election official, who announces the name of the voter and\r\nthe number of his ballot, tears off the stub, and drops the ballot\r\nunopened into the box. A person’s vote may be challenged by an\r\ninspector or watcher, or at the written request of any voter. If,\r\nunder oath, he is questioned and swears that he is eligible, his vote\r\nis recorded, but is marked challenged.\r\n\r\n=The Count=: At five o’clock the polls are closed and the ballots\r\nare counted. They must not be handled by any one but the election\r\nofficials, although the watchers may see every ballot and watch the\r\ncount. The count for each office to be filled is made separately,\r\nand if there are many candidates it may take many hours to complete\r\nthe count and know the result. Official tally sheets are provided.\r\nThe result is filed with the County Clerk. The board of supervisors\r\nmeet as a board of canvassers to canvass the result, and the returns\r\nare sent to the State board of canvassers.\r\n\r\n=The Australian Ballot= is the only one used in New York State\r\nelections. It has on one ballot the names of all candidates of all\r\nparties for all the offices to be voted for. The names are grouped\r\nby offices, and the first name in each group is the candidate of\r\nthe party that cast the largest vote at the last election. The only\r\nballots shown before Election Day are sample ballots printed on pink\r\npaper, while the ballots used at the election are white. They are all\r\nnumbered, and every one must be accounted for.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the ballot was printed with a column for each party,\r\nso that the easiest thing the voter could do was to put a cross\r\nwithin a circle at the head of the column, and thus vote for every\r\ncandidate of that party—what is called a “straight ticket.” The\r\nballot used at present requires a separate cross for every separate\r\ncandidate, and so encourages independence and intelligence on the\r\npart of the voter. There are blank places so the voter may write in\r\nany name he wishes for any office.\r\n\r\n=Short Ballot=: It is evident from the brief outline of the structure\r\nof government contained in the earlier chapters, that there are a\r\ngreat many officers to be elected. It is impossible for even the most\r\nintelligent and most interested voter to know the merits of as many\r\ncandidates as often appear on one ballot. In some elections ballots\r\nare used which can be measured only in feet, and sometimes even in\r\nyards. To remedy this evil there is a strong movement toward a _short\r\nballot_. This would mean cutting down the number of elective offices.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of government to-day is to concentrate the\r\nresponsibility on one man or a few men, to let them make\r\nappointments, and to hold them accountable for results.\r\n\r\n=Corrupt Practices Act=: The cost of campaigns and elections to the\r\npolitical parties and to many candidates is great. While there are\r\nmany legitimate expenses connected with an election, the uncontrolled\r\nuse of large funds leads to grave corruption and has brought about\r\ncareful regulation by the State of money used at election-time.\r\nContributions from corporations are prohibited.\r\n\r\nA public statement of campaign funds must be made by every candidate\r\nand every organization taking part in a campaign, of all money\r\nreceived for campaign purposes and how it has been expended. This\r\nstatement must be filed with the Secretary of State within twenty\r\ndays after the election, and be open to public inspection. Even these\r\nprecautions, while more severe than those found in most States,\r\nhave not succeeded in putting an end to the corrupt use of money in\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed recently that an addition to the Corrupt\r\nPractices Act should be made to require all candidates and campaign\r\nmanagers to file, five days _before_ election, instead of twenty days\r\n_after_, a list of receipts and expenditures, so that voters might\r\nknow before the election the sources of political contributions and\r\nthe use to which the money is put.\r\n\r\nA second proposal has been made in regard to the personnel of\r\nthe election officers, that instead of these boards being party\r\nappointees they should be appointed from the civil service lists.\r\nIt is argued that with civil service appointees handling the count\r\nof ballots there would be less likelihood of mistakes or deliberate\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\nOregon has adopted the plan of having a pamphlet printed by the State\r\nfor both the primaries and the elections, in which is set forth the\r\nclaims of candidates of all parties, and both sides of all public\r\nquestions to be voted on. This pamphlet is sent at public expense to\r\nevery voter in that State.\r\n\r\n=Voting-machines= are expensive, but they do away with the necessity\r\nfor voting-booths, and require fewer election officials. Perhaps\r\nthat is one reason they have not been more popular. They register\r\nthe number of votes cast for each candidate, and the result of the\r\nelection is known as soon as the polls are closed, and does not have\r\nto await the long, tedious, and often incorrect count by hand.\r\n\r\n=The Use of School-houses= and other public buildings for\r\nregistration- and polling-places is growing more common. It not only\r\nsaves the large rent usually charged for the use of other buildings\r\nfor polling-places, but it also gives more room and more convenient\r\nsurroundings than are afforded by the kind of place often rented for\r\nuse on Election Day. Unless provision is made by a city charter or\r\nsome special permission school-houses may be used in this way only by\r\na vote of the people of the district.\r\n\r\n=The Cost of Elections= in proportion to other expenses of\r\ngovernment is small. In the budget for New York City it figures\r\nless than 1 per cent. of the total budget. At the same time it\r\ncould undoubtedly be lowered by economy. High rent is paid for\r\npolling-places, double the number of ballots necessary and liberal\r\nsupplies are given to each district. It was found in Chicago, when\r\nwomen became voters, that the cost of elections was increased very\r\nlittle. The supplies furnished, and the same number of election\r\nofficials, were found to be able to care for a large increase in the\r\nnumber of voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTAXATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident that to carry on the necessary business of a city,\r\na county, the State, or the nation requires money. Also, since\r\neverybody shares in the benefits of government, every one should help\r\npay the bill.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult problems of government is to devise a\r\nsystem of taxation that cannot be evaded, that will raise sufficient\r\nmoney for expenses, and that will treat every one with equal justice.\r\n\r\nTaxation may be divided into two general classes, direct and\r\nindirect. _Direct taxes_ are those imposed directly upon property\r\nor persons; such as taxes imposed upon land, personal property, or\r\nincome. The term _indirect tax_ is applied to taxes upon activities\r\nsuch as carrying on some business or upon buying, selling,\r\nmanufacturing, or importing certain articles.\r\n\r\nA direct tax, as a rule, cannot be evaded or shifted to some other\r\nperson. Indirect taxes can be evaded by abstaining from the activity\r\nthat is taxed. They can usually also be shifted to others, and are\r\ngenerally paid by the consumer, or user of the article that is taxed.\r\nIn general, direct taxes are levied by the State and municipal\r\ngovernments, while the National government derives its revenue (with\r\nthe exception of the income tax) mainly from indirect taxes.\r\n\r\nTaxes for local purposes are levied largely on houses and land, on\r\nwhat is called _real property_. _Personal property_, which is movable\r\nproperty, such as mortgages, live stock, furniture, etc., is also\r\nsubject to taxation, but it is assessed only upon the balance of its\r\nvalue in excess of the indebtedness of the person taxed. It is a more\r\ndifficult tax to collect than the tax on real property, and is evaded\r\nto such a large extent that many economists believe that it should be\r\nabolished, and some tax substituted more possible to impose equally\r\nand to collect.\r\n\r\nVillage and school taxes are usually collected independently by\r\nvillage and school officials.[A] Town, county, State, and city taxes\r\nare assessed and collected at the same time.\r\n\r\n=Tax Districts=: The State is divided into tax districts which have\r\nusually the boundaries of the township or city, and there are three\r\ntax assessors in each tax district elected by the people in the town,\r\nand usually appointed in the city.\r\n\r\n=How Taxes Are Assessed=: The State Legislature decides the amount\r\nneeded for carrying on the government of the State. The largest\r\npart of these expenses are met by special indirect State taxes.\r\nThe remainder of the amount to be raised is apportioned among the\r\ncounties according to the value of taxable property in each (see\r\nState Board of Equalization).\r\n\r\nThe county board of supervisors decides how much is needed for county\r\naffairs. The town meetings, or the town boards and the voters through\r\nvoting on propositions submitted by the town boards, decide how much\r\nmoney is needed for the business of the towns. This sum is added to\r\nthe total amount of taxes necessary for the county government, and\r\nto the county’s share of taxes for the State government, and the\r\ncombined sum is the amount that must be levied on the property in\r\nthat county. The amount needed to carry on the government of a city\r\nin the county is reported to the county board of supervisors and to\r\nthis sum is added in the same way the proportion of county and State\r\ntaxes which the city must pay.\r\n\r\nAssessing the amount each taxpayer shall pay is the duty of the\r\nassessors. They make up an _Assessment roll_ which must contain the\r\nname of every person in the district who owns property, and the\r\nassessed value of his property. The way the assessors do this work\r\nvaries largely. The policy governing assessments in rural districts\r\nis to place as low a valuation on property as possible, in order\r\nthat the total assessed valuation for the county shall be kept down,\r\nso that the apportionment given to the county for State taxes shall\r\nbe low, and the larger burden of taxation shall fall on the cities.\r\nWhen the assessment roll is completed the assessors notify the public\r\nthat it is open for inspection, and a time and place are fixed for\r\na hearing, when any one who thinks he has been unfairly treated may\r\ncomplain. If such a person is not satisfied with the decision of the\r\nlocal assessors he may appear before the County Board of Equalization\r\nwith his complaint.\r\n\r\n=The County Board of Equalization= is the county board of\r\nsupervisors. They have power to equalize the assessed value of the\r\nreal property in any tax district in the county. They apportion the\r\namount of State and county tax due from each town or city, add the\r\ntown or city tax, then ascertain the amount each person shall pay\r\naccording to the assessed valuation of his property. This sum is\r\nnoted on the assessment roll opposite each person’s name and the roll\r\nthen becomes the tax roll of the district.\r\n\r\n_A practical example_: Suppose X owns a house and lot which the\r\nassessors value at $5,000. The county board of equalization finds\r\nthat the city where X lives must raise $100,000 in taxes; $90,000\r\nis required for the city government; $9,000 is the sum the city is\r\nrequired to contribute to the expenses of the county, and $1,000 is\r\nthe share the city has to pay toward the government of the State. The\r\nvalue of taxable property in the city is $5,000,000. Every dollar of\r\nassessed property in the city must therefore pay two cents in taxes,\r\nand X’s taxes will be $100, of which $90 will go to the city, $9 to\r\nthe county, and $1 to the State. A mortgage on the property does not\r\ndecrease the amount to be paid.\r\n\r\n=Collecting Taxes=:[3] If a person fails to pay his real-estate\r\ntaxes the county treasurer is authorized to sell his property for the\r\nunpaid taxes. The property may be redeemed by the former owner on\r\npayment of back taxes with interest due and the cost and expenses of\r\nthe tax sale.\r\n\r\nPublic buildings, religious and charitable institutions, are usually\r\nfree from taxation; they are for the benefit of the entire community.\r\n\r\n=State Taxes=: The ordinary expenses of the State government are met\r\nby revenues derived from special indirect State taxes, so that for\r\nyears there was no direct State tax. State revenues are provided\r\nthrough taxes on stock transfers, mortgage taxes, inheritance taxes,\r\nexcise, franchise, and corporation taxes. One-half the amount derived\r\nfrom the excise tax goes to the State and one-half to the community\r\nfrom which it comes.\r\n\r\nEvery stock company incorporated under any law of the State must pay\r\na tax upon the amount of its capital stock and upon any subsequent\r\nincrease. The earnings of corporations doing business in the State\r\nare also taxed.\r\n\r\n=An Inheritance Tax= is a tax imposed on the transfer of property at\r\ndeath by will, or by operation of law in case of intestacy. The rate\r\nof this tax varies according to the value of the property or share of\r\nthe recipient and his kinship to decedent. A higher rate is levied on\r\na large bequest or share than on a small one, and a larger percentage\r\nis levied when the bequest or share goes to distant kin or to a\r\nstranger than when it goes to a close relative.\r\n\r\nThe direct property tax is now used to pay off the interest and\r\ngradually the principal of the State debt.\r\n\r\nThe estimated resources and revenues, not including the direct tax,\r\nfor the State for 1918 are:\r\n\r\n  Cash balance, July 1st     $11,084,423\r\n  Stenographers’ tax             431,607\r\n  Excise tax                   5,750,000\r\n  Corporation tax             20,000,000\r\n  Incorporation tax            1,400,000\r\n  Inheritance tax             14,000,000\r\n  Stock transfer tax           6,100,000\r\n  Investment tax               2,500,000\r\n  Mortgage tax                 1,180,000\r\n  Motor Vehicle tax            2,375,000\r\n  Canal maintenance receipts     150,000\r\n  Other revenues               4,554,150\r\n                             ———————————\r\n  Total                      $69,525,180\r\n\r\n=The Board of Equalization= meets in Albany once a year to examine\r\nthe reports from the different counties of the value of their taxable\r\nproperty, and to equalize the amount of their taxation. The State tax\r\ncommissioners, who must personally visit the counties and examine the\r\nlocal rolls, and the land office commissioners form this board.\r\n\r\n=Federal Taxes=: The United States government even before the war\r\nrequired an enormous amount of money with which to conduct its\r\nbusiness. In the past its chief sources of revenue have been custom\r\nduties and internal-revenue taxes.\r\n\r\n=Custom Duties= are taxes levied on the importation of articles\r\ninto the United States from foreign countries. The tariff, which\r\nfixes the rates of the impost taxes, has been a constant subject\r\nfor dispute between the major political parties. Whether the tariff\r\nshould be imposed “for revenue only,” or whether it should be “a\r\nprotective tariff” to protect American industries and American labor\r\nfrom the cheap labor of other countries, has been the chief point of\r\ndifference between Republicans and Democrats at National elections.\r\nImpost taxes are indirect taxes which eventually come out of the\r\npockets of the people in increased prices of the articles imported,\r\nand incidentally they raise the prices of similar articles of\r\ndomestic manufacture.\r\n\r\n=Internal Revenue= or =Excise Taxes= are taxes imposed on business\r\nor on the manufacture and sale of articles in the United States.\r\nThe most important taxes of this character are those on the\r\nmanufacture and sale of liquor and tobacco. The manufacture and sale\r\nof cosmetics, perfumes, oleomargarine, and playing-cards are also\r\nsubject to internal-revenue taxes. In many cases these taxes are paid\r\nby the sale of stamps to the manufacturer, who has to affix them to\r\nthe article before it is sold. As with many other kinds of taxation,\r\nthe public, the ultimate consumer, pays this tax.\r\n\r\n=The Income Tax= is a tax on the income of a person. Many who do not\r\nown land or other tangible property enjoy an income. As a farmer has\r\nto pay a tax on his farm, so a lawyer who has a lucrative practice,\r\nbut does not own land or stocks, and the man who has an income from\r\ninvestments, are all required to pay their share of government\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nThe income-tax law of 1916 taxes all incomes of married couples in\r\nexcess of $4,000, and all incomes of unmarried persons in excess of\r\n$3,000. To provide further war revenue, an additional tax was imposed\r\nin 1917 on the income of every unmarried person in excess of $1,000\r\na year, and of every married couple in excess of $2,000 a year.\r\nThe rate of these taxes increases with the size of the income. The\r\ncombined income taxes may amount to as much as 67 per cent. in case\r\nof the largest incomes.\r\n\r\n=Public Debt; Bonds=: If the government needs more money than it\r\nwishes to raise by taxation, it can borrow it by issuing bonds. A\r\nbond is a promise to pay a certain definite sum of money at a certain\r\ntime with a fixed rate of interest. United States government bonds\r\nare the safest investment in the world. The State and municipalities\r\nmay also issue bonds, although the amount a city may borrow may be\r\nlimited by the value of its assessed property. The interest on bonds\r\nand the payment of the principal must be met by taxation.\r\n\r\nBonds should not be issued to pay for the running expenses of\r\ngovernment, because that is putting on future generations the unjust\r\nburden of paying for something for which they receive no return.\r\nTheir legitimate use is to meet the cost of some improvement which\r\nwill continue to benefit those who go on paying for it.\r\n\r\nWhen bonds are issued provision should be made for the redemption of\r\ntheir principal. This is done in New York State by raising annually\r\nby direct taxation a fixed sum to be invested and kept as a separate\r\nfund called a “sinking fund,” to be used only for this purpose. A\r\nsinking fund for the payment of the interest and for the redemption\r\nof the debt of the State is required by the State constitution.\r\n\r\n=The Budget=: Before undertaking an enterprise a wise man considers\r\nhow much it is going to cost, and where the money is coming from. A\r\nbudget is a summary of the estimated expenses for the following year\r\nof the different departments of the government. It is a business-like\r\nmethod of determining the amount of money which should be raised by a\r\nState or municipality to meet its necessary expenses. The budget for\r\nNew York State is made by the Legislature from an estimate furnished\r\nby each of the administrative departments of the State. It includes\r\nin detail the amount of salaries, traveling expenses, and maintenance\r\nof each department.\r\n\r\nThe making of a budget for a city is of the greatest importance to\r\nthe taxpayers. Public hearings are held on it, when taxpayers may\r\nbe heard for or against the use of the money in the designated way,\r\nand when they may ask for additional appropriations for some city\r\nactivity. Public servants in this, as in every other department of\r\nservice, work best under supervision. The taxpayer owes it to himself\r\nto maintain adequate representation at these hearings. It is on the\r\nbasis of the budget as finally adopted that taxes are adjusted for\r\nthe following year. (See Chapter IV on Greater New York.)\r\n\r\nThe National government has not yet adopted the budget plan, and the\r\nPresident has not the power to veto any item of an appropriation bill\r\nunless he vetoes the entire measure.\r\n\r\nThis is a limitation which is greatly deplored, as it prevents\r\nhim from cutting out any provision in the bill which he may\r\nthink unwarranted or extravagant, or which has come out of the\r\n“pork-barrel.” This is a term applied to appropriations given by\r\nCongress to certain local communities for some Federal building or\r\nfor the development of some local resource which is not of advantage\r\nto the National government, and which is given not because there is\r\nany need for it, but because the representative from that district\r\nin Congress wants to make himself popular with his constituents by\r\ngetting for them some public plunder.\r\n\r\n=Every Dollar That Is Spent in Any Department of Government Comes\r\nOut of the Pockets of the People=: It is not easy for the public to\r\nrealize this. The Congressman who gets an extra appropriation for a\r\npost-office or other public building that is not needed, in order\r\nto please his home people, may get more votes, but he is adding to\r\nthe public burden. In return for a vote for his post-office he may\r\nhave to give his vote to a fellow-Congressman for an unnecessary\r\nexpenditure in another State. The chain so formed is practically\r\nendless, and its inevitable effect is to raise the cost of government\r\nunwarrantably. Every such expenditure, every unnecessary public\r\nsalary, every dishonest public official, every tax-dodger, every\r\nincompetent piece of public work, adds to the burden of taxation\r\nwhich the people have to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] In some counties local arrangements make it difficult for absent\r\nowners of property to know when and where taxes are due. Every\r\ntax-collector should be obliged to follow the usage of any good\r\nbusiness house and mail a bill for taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nPUBLIC HIGHWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad-making has been a function of government since the early ages.\r\nThe old Roman roads still exist as evidence of the labor and care\r\nthat were put into them.\r\n\r\nEase of communication, which permits people to journey from home and\r\nsee what the rest of the world is doing, is a great factor in binding\r\npeople together, and tends to promote progress.\r\n\r\nGood roads are important to every citizen, not only because of the\r\nincreased use of the automobile, but because they are a vital part of\r\nthe business life of the country. The farmer needs them to move his\r\ncrops to market. Without them he may be unable to sell his produce at\r\nthe time it is most needed and when he could get the best prices for\r\nit. The merchant needs them to receive supplies and make deliveries;\r\nthe manufacturer needs them for the moving of his raw material; the\r\ncity-dweller needs them so that food may come into city markets.\r\nPublic highways are the connecting arteries between city and country.\r\n\r\nNew York State has recognized the need of good roads, and has\r\nspent an immense amount of money to secure them. Some years ago a\r\nbond issue of $50,000,000 was authorized in the belief that such a\r\nlarge sum of money would put the roads in a condition to meet all\r\nrequirements for many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the Legislature approved contracts for 8,300 miles of county\r\nhighways, believing that the money available would be sufficient.\r\nThe following year it approved contracts for 3,600 miles of State\r\nhighways and another bond issue of $50,000,000 was found necessary.\r\nNot only had the cost of labor and material greatly increased, but in\r\naddition the use of motor-trucks and motor-buses was beginning to put\r\na strain on roads and road-beds which had not been anticipated.\r\n\r\nOld roads began to go to pieces rapidly and needed constant repair\r\nand often replacing. Even the new roads, where the road-beds were\r\nof stone only six inches deep, soon spread and disintegrated under\r\ntrucks weighing from one to fifteen tons. This use of motor-trucks\r\nis increasing, and is necessary for the traffic requirements of the\r\nState, but highways are being subject to a strain hitherto unknown,\r\nand this strain will increase in both quantity and severity.\r\n\r\nHow to meet the requirements and maintain and repair roads built for\r\nlight traffic which are giving way under the new demands, and how\r\nto build new roads strong enough to stand up under the strain, are\r\nproblems the State finds it difficult to meet. New road-beds are now\r\nrequired of stone from nine to twelve inches deep.\r\n\r\nSome roads are built by the State, some by the county, and some by\r\nthe town. In many cases the cost of the work is divided between\r\ncounty and town, or between county and State. The State may help a\r\ntown build a road, but it can only contribute the same amount or less\r\nthan the town appropriates.\r\n\r\nAll material that is used in road-building must be tested in the\r\nlaboratories maintained by the State Highway Department, and constant\r\nexperiments are being made to test materials and specifications to\r\nfind out what will stand the hardest wear.\r\n\r\nAll roads must be built and repaired under the direction of the State\r\nHighway Commissioner, but whether these instructions are carried\r\nout often depends on local officials. The public believes that there\r\nhas been no part of government in New York State more honeycombed\r\nwith fraud than the one of road-building and maintaining; that\r\nspecifications have been skimped or ignored, different materials have\r\nbeen substituted from those prescribed, cheaper construction of every\r\nkind passed by inspectors, and that the result has been that many\r\nroads of the State have cost vast sums of money for which the State\r\nis in debt and have not lasted even a few years.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the State had a total of 4,027 miles of macadam roads and\r\n5,836 miles of gravel town roads, and more than half of all the\r\nimproved roads in the State had been constructed within five years.\r\nThere were 728 patrolmen employed looking after repairs.\r\n\r\nThe entire cost of bridges is met by the towns with occasional aid\r\nfrom the county. If a State road goes through a village, the same\r\namount is allowed as for the rest of the construction, and if the\r\nvillage wants another kind of a paving or a wider road it must\r\npay the difference in cost. The State Highway Department gives as\r\naverages of cost: for macadam roads $10,000 a mile; first-class\r\nconcrete, $15,000 a mile; and brick paving, $25,000 a mile.\r\n\r\nThe State highway law provides that all construction must be done by\r\ncontract. Prison labor is not employed on State and county roads as\r\nin some States, but it has been used on roads built by towns.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the huge appropriations, the State roads are far from\r\ncomplete as planned. Nearly $750,000 will be available in 1918 from\r\nthe National government as part of New York State’s share in the\r\nFederal appropriation for roads.\r\n\r\n“Working out” a road tax was never a method which contributed to good\r\nroads. The earth roads on which the taxpayer puts his unskilled labor\r\nare usually impassable many months of the year.\r\n\r\n=City Streets=: The local government decides where a road or street\r\nis needed, and with the consent of a sufficient proportion of the\r\nproperty-owners may purchase or condemn the necessary property. If\r\nthe owner is not satisfied with the payment offered, appraisers must\r\nbe appointed to decide the amount that should be paid.\r\n\r\nCity streets must be maintained by the city government. If a person\r\nis injured by the failure of the government to keep sidewalks\r\nin repair he has a right to sue the government for damages. The\r\nmunicipal government, on the other hand, may require property-owners\r\nto keep their sidewalks in good condition.\r\n\r\n=Street-cleaning=: Since many thousands of children have no\r\nplayground but the street, the condition in which city streets are\r\nkept is of great importance to their health and general welfare.\r\nDisease germs are heavy and are most numerous near the ground. If\r\nplaygrounds could be arranged on the roofs of high buildings the\r\nchildren would be the gainers from the pure air. Unfortunately, the\r\nstreets in which they play are not usually the ones which are cleaned\r\nmost frequently by the street-cleaning department. Old and young are\r\ndisorderly—newspapers, cigarette-butts, and fruit-skins are thrown\r\ndown anywhere. Streets littered with papers, with dust-laden pieces\r\nblowing back and forth, increase the dangers from disease.\r\n\r\nCarelessness on the part of the public in throwing things into the\r\nstreets adds many thousands of dollars to the cost of street-cleaning\r\ndepartments. Every time that a person throws a paper or any object\r\ninto the street eventually some one else must be paid to pick it up.\r\n\r\nMost municipalities have ordinances against littering the streets,\r\nbut they are often dead letters.\r\n\r\nThe cleanliness and good order of city streets pay in dollars and\r\ncents, in public comfort and convenience, and in a lowered death-rate.\r\n\r\n=Parks=: With the congestion of population that is not confined to\r\nNew York City or any one part of the State, parks large and small\r\nhave become a necessity not only for pleasure and beauty, but for\r\nthe health of the community. In the country people can be out of\r\ndoors as much as they please, but when families are obliged to live\r\nclose together, “breathing-places” are of actual physical benefit,\r\nespecially if they can be green with grass and trees. Communities\r\noften awaken to the need of parks too late, after all available\r\nplaces are occupied, when in order to provide the necessary oasis\r\nproperty has to be condemned and often enormous sums of money paid\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n=City Planning=: Most of our cities have grown up haphazard without\r\nany definite plan of development. As new industries have come in\r\nthey have brought in large numbers of employees, who have had to be\r\nprovided with living-places, and a new section of the city has been\r\nstarted. Or a real-estate boom, fostered by some private enterprise,\r\nwill develop another quarter without consideration for the welfare\r\nof the incoming population. As land values advance, in order to\r\nsqueeze all the profit possible out of this increase, high crowded\r\nbuildings spring up, planned to house as many people as possible in a\r\nrestricted area. New York City and many other places are continuing\r\nto create new tenement districts in outlying quarters of the city\r\nwhere land is still plentiful.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to change congested areas built up in the past, but it\r\nis a wrong to coming generations to continue to allow considerations\r\nof health and decency to be ignored in the future growth of cities.\r\nHaphazard growth has cost the public dearly in actual money values.\r\nUnrestricted crowded living conditions have cost still more dearly\r\nin the moral and physical vitality of the people who have had to put\r\nup with them. These mistakes of the past cannot be remedied, but\r\ncities and villages are still growing, and the wise community is\r\nnow developing a plan in advance for its future growth, which will\r\nsafeguard public health and welfare, and the convenience as well as\r\nthe beauty of the city.\r\n\r\n=The Value of Beauty=: Streets and roads do not need to be bare and\r\nugly. Some attention paid to appearance costs very little and is a\r\ndistinct benefit to the public. Weeds are usually cut down along the\r\nroadside, but so, too often, are the trees. When one thinks of the\r\nmany years it takes for a tree to attain a fine growth, one wonders\r\nat the carelessness with which they are sacrificed. A well-shaded\r\nroad bordered by trees, or a shaded city street, testifies to the\r\nintelligence and thrift of the people responsible for them. Such care\r\nis apt to be repaid by increased property values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nCOURTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States there are two classes of courts—State courts\r\nand United States or Federal courts. The State courts of each State\r\nderive their jurisdiction and powers from the constitution and laws\r\nof the State. The United States courts derive their jurisdiction and\r\npowers from the Constitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the courts are to hear and decide criminal and civil\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n=Criminal Cases= are prosecutions or proceedings by the State or\r\nFederal government to enforce the laws made for the preservation\r\nof peace, law, and order in the community, by the imposition of\r\nfines, or imprisonment, or the punishment of death, in case of their\r\nviolation.\r\n\r\n=Civil Cases= are suits or proceedings brought for the enforcement\r\nor protection of personal or property rights; as, for example, suits\r\nto recover compensation or damages for personal injuries, or the\r\ndestruction of property, or for breaches of contract, or to recover\r\nproperty wrongfully taken, or to restrain by injunction threatened\r\nwrongful acts for which a suit for money damages would not be an\r\nadequate remedy.\r\n\r\nAt the trial of a criminal or civil case, the judge supervises and\r\ndirects the proceedings, and decides any question of law which may\r\narise. Questions of fact, arising in criminal cases, and in most\r\ncivil cases, are decided by a jury of twelve qualified citizens drawn\r\nfrom a panel or list; but in certain classes of civil cases the judge\r\ndecides questions of fact as well as questions of law.\r\n\r\nCivil as well as criminal cases must be commenced and carried on in\r\na manner prescribed by law or by rules of the courts. In New York\r\nthe laws of procedure are commonly believed to be unnecessarily\r\ncomplicated and technical. Innumerable controversies have arisen as\r\nto their meaning and effect. They have been amended and supplemented\r\nby many statutes, and there is a strong movement among lawyers\r\nto secure the adoption of a simpler and more workable system of\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nIn New York State the courts are of the following classes: _Justices\r\nof the Peace, or Justices’ Courts_, try petty criminal cases\r\ninvolving small thefts, drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and breach\r\nof the peace, and certain ordinary civil suits involving sums of not\r\nover $200. A person accused of serious crime before a justice of the\r\npeace may be held to await action of a grand jury.\r\n\r\nIn New York City, and in various other cities of the State, the\r\nfunctions of the justices’ courts are performed by courts called\r\n_Municipal Courts_, _City Courts_, _Magistrates_ or _Police Courts_,\r\nthe latter having jurisdiction only over petty criminal cases. The\r\npowers and duties, as well as the names of these lower courts, vary\r\nin the different cities.\r\n\r\nIt is most important that honest, sympathetic men should preside over\r\nthese lower courts, for in them are tried the small offenses which\r\nmay be due to ignorance of law, and a large number of people come in\r\ncontact with government in no other way.\r\n\r\nMost arrests are for minor offenses such as drunkenness, disorderly\r\nconduct, etc. They are tried here, and many of them bring first\r\noffenders into court, where the treatment received by the person\r\naccused may determine whether he will become a habitual offender\r\nor whether he will be set straight. Many foreigners come into these\r\ncourts, and receive in them their first impression of justice as\r\nadministered in this country. Oftentimes the offense is committed\r\nthrough ignorance or stupidity. A kind word or a helping hand may\r\nmake all the difference between a future good citizen or a crook. In\r\nthese courts, as in the justices courts of the town or village, there\r\nis great need of a careful choice of magistrates.\r\n\r\n=County Courts=: In every county except New York there is a county\r\ncourt presided over by the elected county judge. In these county\r\ncourts may be tried civil suits in which the sum involved is not over\r\n$2,000 and all crimes except those punishable by death. They also\r\nhear appeals from the justices’ courts. The county courts in Queens,\r\nBronx, Richmond, Kings, Ulster, and Albany counties may try cases\r\ninvolving the death penalty.\r\n\r\n=Surrogates’ Courts=: In each county there is a surrogate court,\r\nheld by a judge called “the Surrogate,” who is elected by the voters\r\nof the county for a term of six years (except in the county of New\r\nYork). In this court wills are probated, the estates of persons\r\ndeceased are settled, and guardians for minors and executors or\r\nadministrators for estates of decedents are appointed. It is evident\r\nthat a county surrogate should be a man of strictest probity as well\r\nas good business sense.\r\n\r\n=Court of Claims=: Any one who has a claim against the State may take\r\nit to the Court of Claims, which consists of three judges appointed\r\nby the governor with the approval of the Senate. Appeals from its\r\ndecisions may be taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n=The Supreme Court=: Above the county courts are the Supreme Courts,\r\nwhich, however, are not really supreme, as their decisions are\r\nsubject to review, and may be reversed upon appeal by the Appellate\r\nDivision or the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Courts may try any\r\ncivil or criminal cases, including prosecutions for murder. There are\r\nmore than one hundred Supreme Court justices in the State, elected by\r\nthe voters of the various districts, and the entire State is divided\r\ninto nine judicial districts, in which certain of these Supreme Court\r\njustices sit. In every county, at a certain time, a Supreme Court\r\njustice holds a _trial court_, where both civil and criminal cases\r\nare heard before a trial jury. He also holds a _special term_, where\r\nhe hears and decides motions and civil cases in which no jury trial\r\nis required.\r\n\r\n=Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court=: As judges are human\r\nand may make mistakes, the law provides a right of appeal from the\r\ncourt in which a case is tried. The whole State is divided into four\r\njudicial departments, in each of which there is an Appellate Division\r\nof the Supreme Court. From the Supreme Court justices the governor\r\nchooses the justices for the Appellate Divisions. These Appellate\r\nDivisions hear appeals from decisions of the county courts and of\r\nthe Supreme Courts, and they may sit wherever the public interest\r\ndemands. They do not try cases originally, but only hear appeals.\r\n\r\n=The Court of Appeals= is composed of a chief judge and nine\r\nassociate judges, but only seven judges sit at one time. This court\r\nis the State court of last resort, and it may reverse a decision of\r\nan Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. In most cases no appeal\r\nlies to the Court of Appeals from a decision of a question of fact\r\nby a lower court, but only questions of law can be reviewed; but in\r\ncriminal cases where the sentence is death the entire case may be\r\nreviewed.\r\n\r\n=Courts of Record= are those courts that have an official seal and\r\nkeep an official record of all proceedings. The Surrogate’s Court,\r\nthe County Court, the Supreme Court and its appellate divisions,\r\nand the Court of Appeals are courts of record. Justices’ Courts and\r\nMagistrates’ Courts are not courts of record.\r\n\r\n=Federal Courts=: The jurisdiction of the United States or Federal\r\ncourts extends to all cases in law and equity arising under the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States, to all cases affecting\r\nambassadors and other public ministers and consuls, to admiralty\r\nand maritime cases, and to controversies between States or between\r\ncitizens of different States. Federal courts are organized in a\r\nsimilar way to State courts.\r\n\r\n=The United States District Courts= hear, in the first instance,\r\nall classes of cases over which the United States courts have\r\njurisdiction, except the cases mentioned below. The entire country is\r\ndivided into ninety judicial districts, and each State has at least\r\none district.\r\n\r\n=The United States Court of Claims=, which is located in Washington,\r\nhas jurisdiction over claims against the United States government.\r\n\r\n=The Circuit Court of Appeals= is an appellate court by which\r\ndecisions of the United States district courts may be reviewed.\r\n\r\n=The United States Supreme Court= is the highest tribunal in the\r\nland. In cases affecting ambassadors and consuls, and those to which\r\nthe State is a party, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction.\r\nOther cases can come before it only upon an appeal, or writ of error,\r\nto review a decision of a lower United States court or a decision of\r\nthe highest State court involving a question of Federal law. There is\r\na chief justice and eight associate justices of the Supreme Court,\r\nwho are appointed for life. To be a justice of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States is considered one of the highest honors in the land.\r\n\r\nThe judges of all the Federal courts are appointed by the President\r\nwith the consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\n=Constitutionality of the Law=: One important power which the courts\r\nhave is to interpret the meaning of the Constitution and laws,\r\nbut they have no power to do so except so far as necessary to the\r\ndisposal of cases before them.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the State is its fundamental law, as that of\r\nthe United States (together with the laws made by Congress under it\r\nand treaties made by the United States) is the supreme law of the\r\nentire United States. A question may arise as to the precise meaning\r\nand scope of a constitutional provision. In this case the court\r\nmay interpret its meaning, and may declare void a law because in\r\nviolation of the constitution.\r\n\r\n=An Injunction= is an order or decree issued by a court, restraining\r\nsome person or persons or corporation from performing certain acts,\r\non the ground that such acts would cause an injury or loss, for which\r\na suit to recover money damages would not furnish adequate redress.\r\nA temporary injunction, or restraining order, may be issued upon\r\naffidavits, in advance of the final trial of a case, when it may\r\neither be dissolved or be made permanent. An injunction may also\r\ncommand the performance of some act. In such cases it is called\r\na mandatory injunction. If an injunction is violated, the person\r\ndisobeying can be arrested and sent to jail or fined “for contempt of\r\ncourt” without trial by jury. Many efforts have been made to limit\r\nthis power of the courts. In Oklahoma, the law provides for jury\r\ntrial in case of contempt of court for violation of an injunction.\r\n\r\nJudges are elected for a longer term of years than are other public\r\nofficials. County judges have a six-year term. Supreme Court justices\r\nand judges of the Court of Appeals are elected for a term of fourteen\r\nyears. The reason for the longer term of service is that the\r\nincreased experience is supposed to make a judge more valuable to the\r\nState; also, on account of the long term, he is supposed to be less\r\naffected by political considerations.\r\n\r\nWhether _judges_ should be _appointed or elected_ has been a matter\r\nof considerable controversy. It is argued that if they are appointed,\r\nthe appointment may be a reward for political service instead of\r\nbecause of fitness for the position. On the other hand, if judges\r\nare elected, it is objected that they must take part in political\r\ncontests, and are apt to give decisions more with regard to popular\r\nfavor than to actual justice. Many persons think that in practice\r\nbetter judges are obtained by appointment than by popular election.\r\nState judges are usually elected, but the Federal judges are\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nThe election of proper men for the position of judge is one of the\r\nmost important duties of an electorate. Whether the process of the\r\nlaw insures justice and increases public security depends often more\r\non the judge than on the letter of the law. Decisions involving the\r\nhappiness, rights, and lives of countless people go through the\r\ncourts of the State. These decisions should not be in the hands of\r\nmen to whom the office has been given as a reward for party service,\r\nor who have been put in the position by prejudiced interests. A wise,\r\nintelligent, public-spirited judge has enormous opportunity to add to\r\nthe sum of public welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nA crime is an offense against the people of the State. Also every\r\naction that is brought before a court costs the State money and adds\r\nto the burden of taxation borne by the people.\r\n\r\nA free government carefully guards the rights of an accused person.\r\nHe must be told of the charges against him and be given every chance\r\nto answer them. He is presumed by the law to be innocent until he\r\nis proved guilty, and is not obliged to answer any questions that\r\nmay incriminate himself. He may be examined at once by a magistrate,\r\nor, if he prefers, may be committed to jail to await a future\r\nexamination. If held for any except the most serious crime he may\r\nbe allowed his liberty by some one “giving bail”—that is, giving a\r\npledge of money or property to insure his appearance in court at a\r\ncertain date. If he “jumps his bail” the money is forfeited to the\r\nState, although that does not protect him if he can be found. If the\r\ncharge of which he is accused is a serious one, it must come before a\r\ngrand jury.\r\n\r\n=The Grand Jury= is a body of men chosen from the taxpayers of a\r\ncounty to inquire into alleged crimes during a particular term of\r\ncourt. The supervisors or the commissioner of jurors makes out a\r\nlist of three hundred names of men of integrity and sound judgment,\r\nfrom which the names of twenty-four men are drawn by lot.[B] From\r\nsixteen to twenty-three of these men sit in secret session, and hear\r\nthe presentment of a case, and decide by a vote of at least twelve\r\nmembers whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant holding the\r\naccused for trial.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of a case coming before the grand jury often causes\r\nmuch delay in a trial, as the jury can only be called when court\r\nis in session, and there are often long periods of time between\r\ncourts. On the other hand, the fact that the grand jury is made up\r\nof a man’s neighbors and friends, who would be disposed to give him\r\nfair treatment, is a safeguard to his interests. If “a true bill”\r\nis found, the accused person comes before the court and the charge\r\nagainst him is read to him. If he pleads guilty the judge imposes a\r\nsentence. If he pleads “not guilty” the trial proceeds.\r\n\r\nIf the accused has no lawyer, the court must appoint one for him.\r\nWhile a man so appointed must defend the case, the best lawyers are\r\nnot secured in this way. There has been considerable demand for the\r\ncreation of the office of public defender for accused persons. The\r\nState employs public prosecutors, and it is argued that it should be\r\nas much interested in proving a man’s innocence as in proving his\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\n=Trial by Jury= is a right guaranteed by the constitutions of both\r\nthe State and the nation. A trial jury is composed of twelve men\r\nchosen from a list of qualified men in the county where the crime is\r\ncommitted, or is being tried. After the evidence in the case has been\r\npresented and the judge makes his charge as to the law applicable to\r\nthe case, the jury retires to a secret session, where they are kept\r\nin confinement until they reach a unanimous verdict. In England it\r\nrequires only a majority of the jury to render a verdict.\r\n\r\n=Jury Service= is one of the important duties of a citizen. It is not\r\nrequired of certain classes of men—_viz._, clergymen, physicians,\r\ndruggists, lawyers, and newspaper-men, among others—and judges have\r\nthe power to excuse men on whom jury service would entail special\r\nhardship. Jurors are paid a small sum by the day, and to many men\r\njury service means serious inconvenience and financial loss. But\r\nto leave the settlement of cases which involve the serious welfare\r\nof both individuals and the public, to professional jurors, the\r\nhangers-on of a court-room, is a great wrong to the community.\r\n\r\n=Women Jurors=[C] have not yet been permitted in New York State,\r\nalthough in some Western States they have served with much success.\r\nThere are certain cases involving young girls and children where it\r\nwould seem that only women should be allowed on the jury. Cases of\r\nmurder committed by a woman might be treated with more impartial\r\njustice if women served on such juries. Sentimental considerations\r\nwould not influence them as they do some men in such cases.\r\n\r\n=The Police=: Much of the public welfare and safety of a city\r\ndepends on its police force. A modern police is organized on a\r\nmilitary basis. The men hold their positions for life or during\r\ngood behavior. Promotions are based on merit, and pensions are\r\npaid men who have served a certain term of years. This plan has\r\nimproved conditions by taking the police out of politics to a large\r\ndegree. The policy of the head of the department is of the greatest\r\nimportance to the public. The temptations for graft and corruption\r\nin a police department are enormous, but the assurance of a square\r\ndeal all up and down the line, strict orders to uphold the law, and\r\na well-defined policy against graft of every description, will do\r\nwonders to keep a department honest and efficient.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the plan has been developed of making the police\r\nhelpful in many ways in the life of the city. The uniformed officer\r\nhas many opportunities to help and direct children, especially the\r\nboys on the streets, to prevent violations of the city’s ordinances,\r\nthe littering of the streets, and in many ways to prevent before the\r\nact, rather than to arrest after it has been committed.\r\n\r\nThis helpful spirit has been adopted by the police of New York City,\r\nto the great good of the city. It is exemplified in the Christmas\r\ntrees in the station-houses for the poorer children of a neighborhood\r\nat Christmas-time.\r\n\r\n=Prison Reform=: Modern government is learning not to avenge\r\nitself on a criminal, but to impose a sentence which will tend to\r\nreform him. Instead of sentencing a person to a definite term of\r\nimprisonment, an indeterminate sentence may be given him, the length\r\nof which will be determined by his behavior, and by the promise he\r\nmay show of leading a better life if set free. If he is released he\r\nmay be put on probation. This means that he is required to report\r\nat regular intervals to the court, or to a probation officer, to\r\nshow that his conduct is law-abiding. If he goes wrong again, he is\r\nremanded to serve out his sentence.\r\n\r\nMen and women, wherever confined, must be given employment. Idleness\r\nis bad for even an educated person. Imposed on one who has no\r\nresources within himself, it becomes a source of demoralization\r\nscarcely to be measured. The old custom was to hire prisoners out to\r\ncontractors at low wages. This brought goods manufactured by prison\r\nlabor into unfair competition with honest labor.\r\n\r\nThe modern idea is to teach the prisoner a useful occupation and to\r\npay the wages to his family. It is not common-sense to support a man\r\nin prison at the expense of the State, and to allow his family to\r\nsuffer from having his support taken away from them.\r\n\r\n=Probation=: First offenders, or persons committing minor offenses,\r\nare often put at once on probation, with the sentence suspended\r\nduring good behavior. This has proved of great value in saving many\r\nfrom a criminal career. It is far less costly to the State than\r\nkeeping them in prison, and often leads to the establishment of an\r\nhonest life.[4]\r\n\r\n=Jails and Prisons=: Every community has some kind of jail for the\r\ndetention of offenders. Those who come in contact with the law are\r\noften the poor and the friendless who cannot get bail. Even innocent\r\npersons may be held some time awaiting trial, or the action of the\r\ngrand jury. Young girls are often detained, sometimes as witnesses,\r\nsometimes pending investigation of their own cases, sometimes as\r\nrunaways from home. In such a case there is no place of detention but\r\nthe local jail. These jails are often filthy and unsanitary, unfit\r\nfor human habitation. Their surroundings, and the character of the\r\nsheriff or constable, and jail officials, must inevitably have an\r\neffect on the prisoners, especially on the younger women. It is most\r\nimportant to the community that a woman shall not be sent out from\r\njail a more hardened criminal because of her confinement there. It is\r\na wrong, the responsibility for which every woman in the neighborhood\r\nmust share, that there is no better place of detention for young\r\ngirls. Women matrons in all prisons where women are held and women\r\nprobation officers are now recognized as essential.\r\n\r\nIt is unintelligent to allow a man to leave jail penniless far\r\nfrom his home and friends, to become a tramp or to be tempted to a\r\nnew offense to get money. The modern ideal of criminology is that\r\nhis stay in prison should teach a man an honest way of earning his\r\nliving; also that he should be given some supervision after he has\r\nleft the prison doors, to help him to lead an honest life.\r\n\r\n=City Farms= for the detention of offenders are a great improvement\r\non indoor prisons, and the open-air occupation both saves the State\r\nmoney and is beneficial to the prisoner.\r\n\r\n=The Prevention of Crime=: If as much money and organized effort\r\ncould be put on the prevention of crime as is given to its\r\npunishment, the need of jails and prisons would be greatly lessened.\r\nThe chief causes of crime are drunkenness, feeble-mindedness,\r\novercrowded living conditions, low wages, and insufficient\r\neducation and recreation. Drunkenness is now known to be a disease;\r\nfeeble-minded persons should not be allowed freedom of action; the\r\nState may prevent congested living, it may establish a living wage,\r\nand it has the power to provide proper vocational training and\r\nsufficient facilities for healthful recreation. It tries to separate\r\nthe young offenders from the older ones, and the first offenders\r\nfrom the hardened ones. It has not succeeded very well in preventing\r\ninequalities before the law. The rich man has the advantage of being\r\nable to employ the most skilful lawyers and to appeal his case to\r\ncourt after court and drag it out over a number of years. When a fine\r\nis imposed he can pay it and so sometimes escape punishment. The poor\r\nman may have to go to jail because he cannot pay his fine and he is\r\noften unable to fight a suit.\r\n\r\nTo lessen the hardships and secure equality of treatment for all\r\nalike should be the endeavor of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] The last report of the New York State Probation Commission shows\r\nthat on September 30, 1916, there were 13,433 persons on probation,\r\nand that the number of inmates of the penal and reformatory\r\ninstitutions in the State was decreasing. Probation officers had\r\nthemselves collected $139,000 for cases of non-support, and had\r\ncaused to be paid another sum of $206,000 for these cases. They had\r\nassisted men to pay, in instalments, fines amounting to $30,000,\r\nwhich meant that these men were kept out of jail and at work, and had\r\nhelped men who had stolen something or had done material damage to\r\nsome one to repay those they had injured the sum of $39,000. It is\r\nevident that there is a saving of hard cash to the State in this work\r\nas well as much of social value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nWOMEN OFFENDERS AND THE LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States guarantees to a person accused\r\nof crime a trial by an impartial jury, or by a jury of one’s peers.\r\nThe handling of cases against women offenders has little regard\r\nfor that guarantee. Discriminations against women who have come in\r\ncontact with the law are the custom.\r\n\r\nIf any one is inclined to doubt this, let him imagine the case\r\nreversed and applied to himself. Suppose a man accused of an offense\r\nagainst the law should be accused by a woman, arrested by a woman,\r\nheld in jail by a woman, tried in a court-room filled with women,\r\nbefore a jury composed only of women, and sentenced by a woman judge.\r\nWould such a man feel that he was getting impartial justice given him\r\nby his peers?\r\n\r\nAlso in the treatment of cases involving sex, the penalty of the\r\nlaw rests heavily on the woman and the man usually goes free. Sex\r\nimmorality is a crime for a woman, but the man, the partner in the\r\ncrime, is rarely touched by the law. Until recently in New York\r\nState, even pandering, or living off the earnings of a prostitute,\r\nwas classed, as it still is in some other States, as disorderly\r\nconduct, in the same class of offenses as selling a street-car\r\ntransfer. In some States adultery is still a misdemeanor. It did\r\nnot become a criminal offense in New York until 1907, and it is\r\nstill almost impossible to obtain a conviction unless there are\r\nsome unusually revolting circumstances. Many cases have come into\r\nthe courts of the State where women have been arrested in a raid\r\non a disorderly house, and where the men found with them have been\r\nreleased, and the women held.\r\n\r\nThe large majority of the arrests of women are for the two offenses\r\nof intoxication, and prostitution or street-walking. The usual\r\nsentence for both of these offenses is commitment to the workhouse\r\nfor from eleven to sixty days. Nearly half the cases of intoxication\r\nare of old offenders who are sentenced over and over again. Some\r\nyears ago the Legislature passed a measure making provision for a\r\nState farm where these women could be sent for care and treatment,\r\nand where they could have useful occupation; but it has not yet been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n=Prostitution=: The same sentence to the workhouse for varying\r\nperiods of from five to ninety days, or even six months, is the\r\ncommon one for prostitution. It is doubtful if a sentence of\r\nthis kind has ever been of the slightest benefit to any woman so\r\nsentenced. The usual court procedure is a mill through which this\r\nclass of unhappy beings goes, without either their reformation being\r\naccomplished, or their danger being lessened to the community. When\r\nit is realized also, that a considerable percentage of these women\r\nare feeble-minded or at least sub-normal, the necessity of facilities\r\nfor examination and classification and proper segregation are\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThe entire process of dealing with the problem of public prostitution\r\nin New York City is one that is revolting from a woman’s viewpoint.\r\nTo rid the streets of street-walkers and to keep them “clean,” a\r\nforce of police in plain clothes patrols the streets. These police\r\nare usually the new men on the force selected for their youth and\r\ngood looks. Promotion often rests on the number of arrests that they\r\nmake. A smile or a nod, and a girl may respond. If she speaks, an\r\narrest can and often does follow.\r\n\r\nThis kind of training for the young men of the police force is\r\ndegrading to them. Also, the fact that arrests in nine cases out\r\nof ten are those of women of the street, does not preclude the\r\npossibility of the arrest of a silly, ignorant, but innocent girl.\r\nBrought into court, the presumption is that she is guilty.\r\n\r\nThere is always a first arrest for any offender against the law.\r\nThe records of the magistrates’ courts show that nearly one-third\r\nof the women’s cases brought into court are first offenders. Called\r\nfor the first time before a judge in an open court-room, incoherent\r\nwith fright, the girl is often unable to say a word for herself. If\r\nshe is fined, or sentenced to the workhouse, or held in detention\r\npending investigation, and is kept in association with other women of\r\ndegraded lives, the chances of her being reclaimed are practically\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nThe law holds an accused person innocent until proved guilty, but a\r\nwoman accused of a crime against morality has to prove that she is\r\ninnocent. Under the usual court procedure, a prostitute is outside\r\nthe protection of the law and her word has no value in the court.\r\n\r\n=Night Courts= have been established in order that offenders arrested\r\nat night, after the day courts have closed, may come immediately\r\nbefore a magistrate, without having to spend the night in jail\r\nawaiting trial. There are separate night courts for women in New York\r\nCity, and all arrests for prostitution or loitering are tried in\r\nthese courts.\r\n\r\nThe motive behind the establishment of the Women’s Night Court is\r\nhumanitarian, but it is there that one sees the discrimination\r\nagainst women as the fundamental of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nWomen are sentenced to terms in prison for offenses far less\r\nserious than those for which men are discharged. The discrimination\r\nagainst women, and in favor of men, even extends to the cadet, who\r\npursues the most shameful business in the world, that of exploiting\r\nunfortunate women. Until a few years ago the maximum penalty for such\r\na man was six months in the workhouse.\r\n\r\nThe law now permits a sentence of from two to twenty years, but\r\nconvictions are rare. Nearly every prostitute is exploited by some\r\nman who takes her earnings, and on whom she relies to protect her\r\nfrom the police. If these cadets and procurers could be eliminated\r\nit would greatly diminish professional prostitution, but they are\r\nmost difficult to reach. The women they exploit will often perjure\r\nthemselves to save these men from the vengeance of the law. Also,\r\nthe fact that no conviction can be had on the testimony of the woman\r\nunless supported by corroborative evidence, makes her afraid to\r\ntestify against one of them.\r\n\r\n=The Penalty of Fines=: Imposing a fine as a punishment for\r\nprostitution should be absolutely prohibited. It does not act as a\r\nrestraint, and simply means that the woman must go out on the street\r\nto earn her fine, and it makes the State a partner to her crime. It\r\nhas been abolished in practice by some judges; but it is still the\r\ncustom in some courts in New York State, and is even imposed by some\r\njudges in New York City. A bill to abolish fines throughout the State\r\nwas introduced in the Legislature of 1916, but failed to pass.\r\n\r\n=Young Girls=: Girls between the ages of sixteen and eighteen are\r\nin the most dangerous period of life. Figures show that the great\r\nmajority of girls who become prostitutes are ruined before they reach\r\nseventeen years of age.\r\n\r\nA girl of sixteen in New York State is too old for the Children’s\r\nCourt. She may therefore be held in jail with the hardened\r\nstreet-walker and the habitual drinker. If she is without the\r\nprotection of home or family, she may be left alone, for the State\r\nmakes no provision for a guardian for her unless she has property,\r\nwhen the State is required to provide one for her.\r\n\r\nDelinquency, thefts, and misdemeanors on the part of young girls are\r\noften the results of natural instincts gone wrong. Love of pleasure,\r\na desire for pretty things, and a wish to be attractive is common to\r\nall girls. A false step, a yielding to temptation, followed by an\r\narrest and a trial in an open court-room, often mean an ordeal which\r\nleaves an indelible mark on the girl’s soul, and a disgrace which it\r\nis almost impossible for her to live down.\r\n\r\n=Girl Victims=: The most pitiful cases are those of very young girls\r\nbrought into court as the victims of crime. It is difficult to get\r\nconviction in these cases, as corroborative evidence is necessary.\r\nThe shock to the sensibilities of such a girl at having to tell her\r\nstory to men and having to answer questions in an open court-room can\r\nscarcely be exaggerated. The need of women in places of authority, to\r\nhelp in cases of such crimes, is great. Women probation officers are\r\nonly the first step in the right direction, but there are too few of\r\nthem, and whenever a movement is made toward economy, they are the\r\nfirst to be dismissed.\r\n\r\n=Houses of Detention=: A great need of New York City, and a need\r\nshared by every city in the State, is a proper place of detention for\r\nwomen. As delinquent children are now separated from older offenders,\r\nso delinquent girls, first offenders and old offenders, and other\r\nclasses of women who are held awaiting trial, or for investigation,\r\nor as witnesses, should not be obliged to associate indiscriminately\r\nwith one another while awaiting the disposition of their cases.\r\n\r\nThe need of a building large enough to provide for the separate\r\ndetention of the various classes of women who are in the care of the\r\ncourt has been recognized, but so far little provision has been made\r\nto meet it. In other places in the State, wherever there is a court,\r\nthere is need of a place of detention for women where they will be\r\nsafe from degrading influences, and where they will be under the care\r\nof other women.\r\n\r\n=Women Judges or Judges’ Assistants=: The system which has been\r\ninstituted in Chicago since women were given the vote, of a quiet\r\ntalk with a woman assistant in the Court of Special Sessions, in\r\nher own private office, instead of an open trial, has resulted in\r\nsaving many a girl who otherwise would have become an outcast. In\r\ncertain intimate matters it is a woman’s task to question girls.\r\nContrast the picture of an open court-room: the judge on the bench,\r\nthe jury, if there is one, composed of men, the room filled with men\r\nof all descriptions, and the frightened, trembling child, with this\r\nprivate room with the young offender telling her story alone to an\r\nexperienced woman. Which offers the best chance for saving the girl\r\nfrom a ruined life?\r\n\r\nFrequently the girl comes from a family where crowded living\r\nconditions make decent living almost impossible. Instead of her first\r\noffense coming up for inevitable punishment, it is treated with the\r\nsole object of prevention and cure.\r\n\r\nJudges in New York State cannot appoint women assistants without\r\nauthority from the Legislature, and that authority the Legislature\r\nhas always refused to give.\r\n\r\n=Policewomen=, or =Women Protective Officers=, are now recognized\r\nas a necessary part of the correctional work of a city. The work\r\nof the woman protective officer is very different from that of the\r\npoliceman. The policewoman protects and controls, rather than\r\narrests. In protecting children, in caring for lost children, in\r\nacting as mother to the motherless, in watching over young girls, in\r\ngetting evidence against cadets, she does an invaluable work. The\r\ndisorderly saloon, the dance-hall, and the moving-picture theater are\r\nall hunting-grounds for the white-slaver. In getting evidence in this\r\nsort of crime she is more effective than the policeman. There are\r\npolicewomen now in fifty cities of the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat the whole subject of prostitution and the law is a most\r\ndifficult one to deal with, there can be no question. It needs the\r\ncombined intelligence of both men and women engaged not only in\r\ntheorizing over the problem, but in actual efforts to grapple with\r\nit. Until public opinion supports the single standard of morality,\r\nthe courts will continue to discriminate against women.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, women of all ages, even very young girls, are\r\narrested. Sometimes they are guilty, sometimes innocent, sometimes\r\nsinned against, sometimes only the victims of circumstances, but\r\nalways unfortunate. Their misfortune and its results on their lives\r\nare more terrible than they need be, because they are usually\r\ndeprived of the help of women in places of authority.\r\n\r\nIn the Chicago Court of Morals women are welcome, and there are women\r\ncourt officers, women police, and women probation officers who create\r\nan atmosphere entirely different from the usual court-room. There is\r\nalso no division of sex; when it is a question of morality, the man\r\nand woman are both held. A physical examination is made by a woman\r\nphysician. When a woman is found to be diseased she is sent to a\r\nhospital to be cured.\r\n\r\nSome of the most progressive magistrates and judges are endeavoring\r\nto improve the methods of handling cases of women offenders, but it\r\nwould seem that wherever the welfare and disposition of women are\r\ninvolved other women should be part of the machinery which deals with\r\nthem. This is not so much because of sentimental considerations, for\r\nin some cases women would be less influenced by sentiment than men,\r\nbut there are certain peculiarities, tendencies, and experiences\r\ncommon to each sex which only those of that sex can understand. In\r\nall cases of women offenders against the law other women must be\r\nconcerned, and should be equally responsible with men for their\r\nhandling and disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nPUBLIC EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best foundation for a democracy rests on free educational\r\nfacilities for all the people. An ideal school system is one that\r\nreaches out to every child and prepares him for a useful occupation,\r\nthat is also available for the further development of every member\r\nof the State, and that will give every individual the knowledge\r\nnecessary for him to do his part in government. A self-governing\r\npeople cannot afford a class too ignorant to vote.\r\n\r\nIn New York State, school attendance is compulsory for children\r\nbetween the ages of seven and sixteen years. An exception is made of\r\nchildren between fourteen and sixteen, who have completed the first\r\nsix years of school, and have been to school 130 days since their\r\nfourteenth birthday. Such children may be employed if they have a\r\nduly signed work certificate. In cities of the first and second\r\nclasses, boys between fourteen and sixteen who are employed during\r\nthe day, who do not hold certain certificates, must attend night\r\nschool sixteen weeks in the year. Truant officers must be appointed\r\nin every city, town, and village to enforce the law. Parents who fail\r\nto send their children to school are guilty of a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\n=The School District= is the smallest division of the State, and must\r\nmaintain a free common school at least thirty-six weeks in the year.\r\nIn 1917, an amendment to the school law was passed which abolished\r\nthe old school-district system, that dated from 1795, and which makes\r\nit possible for the children of the rural districts to have some\r\nof the facilities for modern education which have heretofore been\r\nconfined to larger communities.\r\n\r\nIn place of the former school trustees for the separate school\r\ndistricts, there is now one board of education for each town, and\r\nthis board has charge of all the schools in the town. There are 4,000\r\nschools in the State which have less than ten pupils each. The value\r\nof taxable property in many of these school districts is very small.\r\nThe school tax has been the only State tax which has been assessed\r\nin such small units. The needs of each school district had to be met\r\nby the taxation of that one district. For all other State expenses\r\nthe county is the unit of taxation and taxes are assessed equally all\r\nover the county, and the apportionment made according to the needs of\r\neach district. Under the present law, by treating the town as a unit\r\nfor school taxes, all property in the town is assessed equally, and\r\nthe money raised is used for the benefit of all the town.\r\n\r\nIn this way the rich and poor districts share more equally in school\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nThe initial expenses of making the change have increased school taxes\r\nin some places for the first year, but the change will undoubtedly\r\nwork to the great benefit of the children of the State, and is\r\nalong the lines adopted some years ago by most of the other States.\r\nVillages of over 1,500 people are outside the provision of the\r\nnew town law. If the people of two or more school districts wish\r\nto combine, they may vote to consolidate and establish a central\r\nschool.[D]\r\n\r\n=The Town Board of Education= consists of from three to five members\r\nwho are elected for a term of three years each and who appoint their\r\nown clerk and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey have larger power than was given to the former school trustee.\r\nThey have charge of all school property; they determine the kind of\r\nschools that are needed; they may establish high schools, vocational,\r\nindustrial, agricultural, and night schools; they determine the\r\nnumber of teachers to be employed, and their salaries; they may\r\nemploy medical inspectors and nurses, and may provide transportation\r\nfor children attending school.\r\n\r\n=The Annual School Meeting= to elect the Board of Education is held\r\nthe first Tuesday in May.\r\n\r\nQualifications for Voters: At this meeting any one living in the\r\ndistrict can vote who is a citizen twenty-one years old, a resident\r\nin the district for thirty days, who owns or rents or has under\r\ncontract of purchase taxable property in the district; or has had a\r\nchild, either his own or residing with him, in school for at least\r\neight weeks during the year preceding; or who owns personal property\r\nexceeding $50 which was assessed on the last assessment roll.\r\n\r\nCandidates for the board of education may be nominated on petition of\r\ntwenty-five voters. Men and women who are duly qualified electors are\r\neligible to the board.\r\n\r\n=Annual School Budget=: The board of education must prepare an\r\nitemized budget of the amount necessary to be raised for school\r\npurposes, and must publish it in July for public consideration.\r\nAdditional money may only be raised by a vote of the school district\r\nindorsed by the district superintendent. The building of a school,\r\nor repairs costing over $5,000, must be submitted to a vote of the\r\nschool electors.\r\n\r\nA board of school directors is elected in each town, consisting of\r\ntwo men, each with a term of five years, but elected in different\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n=The Supervisory District=: Each county, except those in Greater\r\nNew York, is divided into from one to eight supervisory districts.\r\n(Villages and cities of over 5,000 people are not included, as they\r\nmake their own provisions. Each of these has a board of education.)\r\n\r\n=The District Superintendent= is the director of a supervisory\r\ndistrict. He is chosen by the board of school directors and is\r\nengaged for a term of five years and paid $1,200 a year by the State,\r\nwith an additional allowance of $300 for traveling expenses. The\r\nsupervisors of the towns in his district may vote to increase his\r\nsalary, the increase to come out of the taxes raised in the towns in\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\nA man or a woman twenty-one years of age, and a citizen and resident\r\nof the State, is eligible for the office, provided he or she has\r\na State teacher’s certificate and can pass an examination in the\r\nteaching of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe District Superintendent has the general supervision of the\r\nschools in his district. He is responsible for the instruction\r\ngiven in them and the discipline that is maintained. He examines\r\ncandidates for teachers’ positions, under the direction of the State\r\nCommissioner of Education.\r\n\r\n=Union Free School Districts= have been permitted under State law\r\nfor many years in cities and villages. Some years ago this law\r\nwas extended to include rural districts, and during the past few\r\nyears about 500 rural school districts have been discontinued and\r\nconsolidated with adjoining districts. Many of the discontinued\r\nschools had only a handful of pupils, the buildings and equipment\r\nwere primitive and inadequate, and the small amount of money\r\navailable made it impossible for the school to offer any advantages.\r\nThe union of school districts has given better educational facilities\r\nto the rural districts. The children have been taken to school by\r\nwagons provided for their transportation, and have had the advantages\r\nof a larger school, a higher grade of teachers, and better\r\nfacilities of all kinds for modern education. The new educational law\r\nprovides still greater development in this direction.\r\n\r\n=Physical Training= is compulsory in all schools, public and private,\r\nfor children over eight years of age for at least twenty minutes a\r\nday. The State gives financial aid in the training.\r\n\r\nMilitary training is compulsory for boys between the ages of sixteen\r\nand nineteen in public and private secondary schools and colleges.\r\nThe name “military” is misleading, for the law provides that the\r\ndevelopment of “correct bearing, mental and physical alertness,\r\ndisciplined initiative, sense of duty, self-control, and a spirit of\r\nco-operation under leadership” is to be given special attention.\r\n\r\n=School Money=: For many years it has been recognized that sufficient\r\neducational facilities could not be provided for every part of the\r\nState through local taxation.\r\n\r\nBesides the money raised by the school districts, the State\r\ncontributes large sums of money for the support of public schools.\r\nPart of this money is the income from certain educational funds\r\nbelonging to the State which cannot be used for any other purpose,\r\nand part is money appropriated by the State Legislature. This money\r\nis distributed by the State Commissioner of Education according to\r\nthe needs of the school districts.\r\n\r\nCity schools are subject to the same general supervision of the State\r\nCommissioner of Education, but are under the direction of local\r\nboards of education, and local superintendents of schools.\r\n\r\n=Normal Schools= for training teachers are maintained by the\r\nState out of school funds, and teachers’ meetings are held in the\r\nsupervisory districts to help and improve teachers.\r\n\r\n=The University of the State of New York=, which is at the head of\r\nthe entire educational system of the State, is not a university in\r\nthe ordinary sense of the word. It is a combination of all of the\r\ncolleges and secondary schools of the State. It is governed by a\r\nBoard of Regents, twelve men elected by the State Legislature for\r\ntwelve years each, but whose terms begin in different years, who\r\nhave large powers of control over all the higher institutions in the\r\nState, universities, colleges, technical and professional schools.\r\nThey have the management of the State Library and Museum. They\r\nprepare Regents’ examinations and grant Regents’ certificates, and\r\nsupervise the granting of degrees.\r\n\r\nThe president of the University of the State of New York is elected\r\nby the Regents. He is also the _State Commissioner of Education_,\r\nand as such is the head of the State Department of Education which\r\nsupervises the free public schools and normal schools of the State\r\nand apportions the State school funds.\r\n\r\n=The National Commissioner of Education= is at the head of the\r\nNational Bureau of Education in Washington. The work of this bureau\r\nis largely to collect and publish information about educational\r\nconditions and progress in the United States.\r\n\r\n=Agricultural Help=: There are four free agricultural schools besides\r\nthe State College of Agriculture in Ithaca. Much assistance is given\r\nby the government to the agricultural needs of the State. Special\r\ncourses are provided at many colleges for the various departments of\r\nagricultural work. Short courses are arranged for those who can only\r\nattend a few weeks, and at times in the year when farm work is slack.\r\n\r\n=Farmers’ Institutes= are organized, at which experts discuss the\r\nbest way of doing the varied work of the farm, especially how to\r\nincrease production and to make the farm more profitable.\r\n\r\n=Vocational Training=:[5] If the public school is going to prepare\r\nyoung people for their work in the world, some guidance in the\r\nselection of an occupation, and some practical training in a trade or\r\nprofession, must be included in their school work.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of children leave school at an early age to go\r\nto work. Without specialized training they have little chance for\r\nadvancement, but fill the ranks of untrained labor, to the great loss\r\nof the world and their own disadvantage.\r\n\r\n=State Scholarships=: Each of the 150 Assembly districts of the State\r\nhas five free scholarships valued at $400 each. The scholarships are\r\nawarded by the Commissioner of Education and the holder may attend\r\nany college in the State, and receive $100 for each of the four years\r\nhe or she attends.\r\n\r\n=Domestic Training=: The majority of girls, even though they are\r\nwage-earners for a time, sooner or later marry, and have children\r\nand a household to take care of. In the olden days, when the home\r\nwas a workshop, girls were taught cooking at home; they learned\r\nto care for babies through taking care of the little ones in the\r\nfamily. Now they often leave school to go to the factory, and only\r\nleave the factory when they marry. They have no knowledge of cooking,\r\nhousekeeping, or the care of children. Unless domestic economy of\r\nthe most practical kind is taught in the school-room, there is no\r\nway they can be prepared for the important business of housekeeper\r\nand mother. If every girl were taught to cook and were trained in\r\nthe proper care of an infant, it would add immeasurably to the sum\r\ntotal of the comfort and health of family life. It would be an\r\nadvantage to every boy, likewise, if he were taught to use his hands\r\nin carpentering or other manual work. Whatever comes in later life,\r\nhands that have been trained to be useful are a great asset to any\r\nman or woman.\r\n\r\n=Schools as Community Centers=: Education does not stop at any age.\r\nPublic free lectures, mothers’ meetings, and the use of schools for\r\ncommunity recreation are helping to make the school-house 100 per\r\ncent. efficient as an educational center. The school plant that is\r\nclosed when school is not in session is an extravagance which no\r\ncommunity can afford.\r\n\r\nThe demand for the use of the school-house for political meetings,\r\nand as polling-places at election-time, is growing. Outside of New\r\nYork City school-buildings may only be so used by special permission\r\nof the voters. Since one of the purposes of education is to train\r\npeople in citizenship, the use of the school-house as the center of\r\neverything that pertains to the people’s part in government seems\r\nlegitimate.\r\n\r\n=Health=: Compulsory education is futile unless at the same time\r\nthe health of children is maintained. It is as much the duty of\r\ngovernment to watch over the proper development of the body as of the\r\nmind, yet more attention is often given to decoration of schoolrooms\r\nthan to matters of health.\r\n\r\nAn appallingly large number of children have defective teeth, poor\r\neyes, or obstructed breathing. Neglected teeth mean an undernourished\r\nbody and are a common source of disease.\r\n\r\nPeriodic medical examinations are required by State law, and\r\nschool nurses may be engaged as part of the regular school force.\r\nThe value of the law depends on the way it is enforced by local\r\nschool authorities, and this is often far from satisfactory. These\r\nprovisions are found to repay their cost in the added strength and\r\nproductive powers that they give to the community.\r\n\r\n=Co-operation=: The greatest of all needs in connection with our\r\nschools is a lively interest in them on the part of women. The woman\r\nwho cares about the future of her child must be interested in school\r\nmeetings and the election of school-boards, who should be carefully\r\nchosen. Frequent visits to the school in city and country are a help\r\nand inspiration to both teachers and parents.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Under a provision of a recent Federal law, a certain sum of money\r\nis available for use in any State for the teaching of home economics,\r\nindustrial training, or for any vocational work, provided that the\r\nState appropriates an equal amount for the purpose, which New York\r\nState has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nHEALTH AND RECREATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great majority of men and women, and even many children, have to\r\nwork for a living. To keep healthy they need time and opportunity for\r\nwholesome recreation.\r\n\r\nRecreation is as much a necessary part of normal life as food or\r\ndrink; a fact that has been partially lost sight of in this economic\r\nage, but throughout the world’s history there have been frequent\r\nexamples of governments which made careful provision to supply\r\nnecessary amusements for their citizens. In Greece great stadiums\r\nwere erected for games and contests; in medieval times the knights\r\nheld tournaments, even the churches celebrated their saints’ days\r\nwith gay street processions.\r\n\r\nThe need for recreation is particularly great to-day because the\r\ncongestion of population of our cities has left few open spaces for\r\nleisure time, and crowded living and small, dark rooms where all the\r\nwork of the household must be done, preclude any social life in the\r\nhomes of many families. Many young girls who crave companionship and\r\nsocial intercourse with friends have to go outside their homes to\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\nCrowded tenements without light or air, dirty streets with no\r\nprovision for wholesome recreation, are proofs of poor government and\r\ninefficient democracy, no matter how prosperous and contented a city\r\nmay look in its richer quarters.\r\n\r\nPeople who are obliged to live in the crowded districts have a\r\nlowered vitality and a lessened value to the world; and the same\r\nnatural impulses which, rightly directed, lead to an orderly,\r\nuseful, contented life, may be the causes of delinquency if stunted\r\nor misdirected. The slum is an economic crime, condoned by a public\r\nwhich pays the penalty in contamination and contagion thrust back\r\nupon itself.\r\n\r\n=Housing=: Air and sunshine are the first requisites of healthy life.\r\nThe government recognizes a certain responsibility in insuring these\r\nnecessities, and prescribes by law regulations for the construction\r\nand inspection of living accommodations. Many families cannot choose\r\ntheir homes, but are obliged to live in the kind of buildings that\r\nare to be found near their work. Inside rooms without windows, rooms\r\ninto which a ray of sunshine has never penetrated, are common in\r\nevery city in the State. The law prohibits, in cities of the first\r\nclass, the building of new tenements with inside rooms without\r\nwindows, but many old ones are in existence, and two-family houses\r\nmay still be built with inside rooms. In other cities there are\r\npractically no restrictions, except by occasional ineffectual city\r\nordinances. Sanitary arrangements, and the water-supply in many\r\ntenement-houses, are insufficient for health or even decency.\r\n\r\nTenement-house inspection is a part of city government in which women\r\nare particularly fitted to serve. In New York City, there are 103,688\r\ntenement-houses and 193 inspectors. Only eight of these are women.\r\n\r\nThe war has greatly intensified the housing problem. With the\r\ntremendous increase in certain industries which has brought thousands\r\nof people to work in new factories, there is a corresponding demand\r\nfor living accommodations near their work. These factories may not\r\nbe permanent, and so private capital hesitates to build houses near\r\nthem. The result is a terrible crowding of people in unsanitary and\r\nunfit buildings. The consequences of such overcrowding is seen in the\r\nincrease of child delinquency, immorality and disease, an increased\r\ndeath-rate, and the inevitable unrest from such unhappiness which\r\nresults in strikes and labor troubles.\r\n\r\n=Recreation=: The modern city so far has made little provision for\r\nthe natural irresistible desire of youth for play.\r\n\r\nThis is all the more dangerous because young men and women are being\r\ndrawn in great numbers from the protection of the home, for work\r\nin factories and shops. They have a freedom from restraint such as\r\nthey have never had before. They have money which they have earned;\r\nthey are eager for amusement. When they come to the end of a day of\r\nexhausting work their love of pleasure will not be denied. If they\r\nare not given the right kind of amusement, they will take the wrong\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nInstead of recognizing this natural instinct for play, and providing\r\nsafe channels for its expression, all provisions for recreation are\r\nusually left to commercial interests, to be used for their own gain,\r\nwithout supervision or control. Vice is often deliberately disguised\r\nas pleasure, and the most normal and healthy impulses of young men\r\nand women, that, properly directed, lead to happy married life, are\r\nfrequently used as a means to their downfall.\r\n\r\nLoneliness also plays a part. Many a young man or girl comes to\r\nthe city to find work. Where can they find the social intercourse\r\nand companionship necessary to normal life? The homeless boy often\r\nstands around the edge of the dance-hall, vainly hoping to make\r\nthe acquaintance of some “nice girl.” The lonely girl, living in\r\na cheerless hall bedroom, turns to the dance-hall as a place to\r\nfind companionship. Proper provision for public recreation, well\r\nsupervised, would help to bring this boy and girl together in decent,\r\nwholesome surroundings.\r\n\r\n=The Dance=: In young girls, the social instinct, the desire to meet\r\nand know other people, and especially those of the opposite sex,\r\nbecomes a dominant factor between the ages of fifteen and twenty.\r\n\r\nThe most natural expression of youthful spirits is the dance. To\r\nallow it to become a snare to spoil the lives of young people is one\r\nof the great deficiencies of city life. In every city dance-halls,\r\nranging from the back room of a saloon to the casino or “gin-palace,”\r\nhold out temptations to young people.\r\n\r\nIn New York City there are over five hundred licensed dance-halls.\r\nThis means, at a moderate estimate, one-quarter of a million young\r\npeople every night in these public dance-halls, most of which are run\r\nin connection with the liquor trade.\r\n\r\nThe obligation to regulate places of public amusement, and to provide\r\ngood amusement in place of bad, rests with the community.\r\n\r\nThe minute you begin to regulate the dance-hall you are interfering\r\nwith many kinds of business; first and foremost the liquor trade\r\nand all the interests it involves; then, with the business of those\r\nwhose livelihood depends upon the vile trade that is stimulated by\r\nthe usual dance-hall; and behind these groups, an unknown number of\r\nperfectly respectable businesses whose trade is increased by the\r\nconditions which characterize a “wide open” town. All these manifold\r\ninterests are rooted deep in the fabric of the government of most of\r\nour American cities, and, because their connections are in so many\r\ninstances seemingly innocent, are all the more difficult to defeat\r\nand dislodge.\r\n\r\n=Playgrounds=: The need of organized recreation facilities for\r\nchildren has become pressing, as congestion of population has left\r\nno place, not even the streets, in which they can play.\r\n\r\nThere are many blocks in New York City where the population is\r\ngreater than in any other place of like area in the world. Where can\r\nthe great throng of children go to find innocent amusement? Where\r\nshall they go out of school hours?\r\n\r\nIn 1915 it was estimated that there were 734,000 children between\r\nfive and fourteen years of age who had to play away from home. To\r\nprovide for them, the city furnished school and park playgrounds for\r\nfrom 100,000 to 185,000, leaving at least half a million children\r\nwith no provision of any kind for play, except the already crowded\r\ncity streets.\r\n\r\n=Vacation Schools=: Keeping the schools and playgrounds open during\r\nthe summer months takes the children away from the hot, crowded\r\nstreets, at least part of the time. Like public playgrounds, the\r\nnumber of vacation schools is always dependent on appropriations.\r\nThe makers of the city budget find a greater pressure exerted from\r\nthe multitude of business interests that want consideration, than\r\nthey do in support of appropriations for public health and comfort.\r\nIt will be necessary for women to be as alive in supporting such\r\nmeasures, as men are in demanding that their interests shall be\r\nconsidered. Also facts must be given to prove that the cost of such\r\nappropriations is saved in the increased productive powers of a\r\nhealthier people. It has been stated that a healthy laborer increases\r\nthe wealth of the country by some $30,000 during a normal lifetime.\r\nIf this is true, it should be merely intelligent business on the part\r\nof the commonwealth to expend a reasonable pro rata of this sum, when\r\nnecessary, to insure that a child when full grown is healthy.\r\n\r\n=Recreation Centers= have been established in some of the Western\r\ncities. Chicago has a series of small parks in various parts of the\r\ncity, with outdoor playgrounds, and in each one a large building\r\nwhere there is a gymnasium, swimming-pool, and assembly-rooms, large\r\nand small. On a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, these places show many\r\nhappy pictures of thousands of families, with both the old and young\r\nspending their leisure in a way that increases their own happiness,\r\nand their value to the world.\r\n\r\n=Municipal Dance-halls= have also been tried. In the recreation\r\ncenters of Chicago there are dance-halls under careful supervision.\r\nBut whether the city provides municipal dance-halls or not, public\r\ndance-halls should be divorced from the liquor business, and there\r\nshould be careful policing and supervision of private halls, and for\r\nthis work women police officials are necessary.\r\n\r\n=Municipal Bathing Beaches= are also possible for any community with\r\na water-front. They are one of the great attractions of Chicago,\r\nwhere a large part of the lakefront draws hundreds of thousands\r\nof men, women, and children, who may easily reach these public\r\nbeaches from any part of the city. The New York State law makes the\r\nconstruction of free baths obligatory in cities of 50,000 or more\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n=The “Movies”=: Millions of children attend moving-picture theaters\r\nevery day of the year. In New York City alone, the daily attendance\r\nof children is estimated at 200,000. The pictures impress the minds\r\nof children like scenes in real life. For good or for evil, moving\r\npictures are the great teachers of the youth of to-day.\r\n\r\nMany of the lessons taught on the screen are not suitable for\r\nchildren. They give intimate views of the underworld, of assault and\r\ninfidelity, and barroom brawls. They show fair heroines and gallant\r\nheroes committing crimes, and being pardoned and living happily ever\r\nafter. They show picture after picture that tends to destroy moral\r\nstandards that home and school have tried to teach.\r\n\r\n=Causes for Juvenile Crime=: The natural craving for excitement and\r\nlove of adventure, with no provision for its legitimate expression,\r\nis responsible for much of the crime of our cities. Some years ago,\r\nit was estimated that of the 15,000 young people under twenty years\r\nof age who were arrested in Chicago during a year, most of them had\r\nbroken the law in their blundering efforts to find adventure. It is\r\nsaid that the machinery of the grand juries and criminal courts is\r\nmaintained, in a large measure, for the benefit of youths between\r\nthe ages of thirteen and twenty-five. The so-called “gangs” of our\r\ncities are an expression of the recklessness and bravado, common to\r\nboys, which, well-directed, is of great service to the world, and,\r\nmisdirected, is responsible for much misery.\r\n\r\n=The Use of School-buildings as Social Centers= meets a very real\r\nproblem. Halls for dancing and for entertainments, lectures and\r\ndebates, rooms for games, even gymnasiums, could easily be brought\r\nwithin the reach of most of the people. Grown-ups, as well as young\r\npeople, would find them of value. This use of the schools, outside of\r\nthe regular school hours, has greatly increased in the West, and the\r\nschool plant has become an increased factor for good in the life of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n=Rural Needs=: Some of our indifference in regard to proper\r\nprovisions for recreation may be due to the fact that we were so\r\nlong a rural nation. The boy who lived on a farm or in a village,\r\nwho had the swimming-hole in summer, the farm with its hay-loft,\r\nand in winter sledding and skating, was able to satisfy his love of\r\nadventure. To-day, even rural conditions have changed, and there\r\nis as much need of decent and wholesome recreation in the country\r\nand small villages as in cities. Churches are open only on Sunday,\r\nschools are closed two days in the week, the only meeting-place is\r\nthe corner store, or the saloons, and the streets. The use of the\r\nschool-building and grounds when school is not in session and on\r\nSaturdays and Sundays, would take many boys off the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF DEPENDENT AND DELINQUENT CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\n=The State of New York has the largest actual number of dependent\r\nchildren, and the largest number in proportion to population, of any\r\nState in the Union.=\r\n\r\nIn the early days it was the women who cared for the neglected\r\nchildren of a neighborhood, and children left homeless were usually\r\ntaken into some one’s home. This care has gradually gone into the\r\nhands of the town, the county, or the State, and has become a\r\ndepartment of government.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of caring for homeless children: one is to place\r\nthem in institutions, the other is to place them in private families.\r\nIn both cases the State usually has to pay for their support. If\r\nthe right kind of a home can be found for a child it seems to have\r\na much better chance for a healthy, happy childhood, and for a\r\nuseful future when placed with a family, than when placed in an\r\ninstitution. The custom in New York State has been to place children\r\nin institutions.\r\n\r\nIt is the business of each local official, town overseer of the\r\npoor, county superintendent of the poor, and city commissioner of\r\ncharities, to provide for destitute children. In the early days he\r\nused to provide for them by giving what was called “outdoor relief”\r\nto the parent, if either parent was living; if the child was homeless\r\nit was sent to the almshouse. For many years past, children between\r\nthe ages of three and sixteen have not been allowed in almshouses,\r\nbut have been committed to institutions.\r\n\r\nBesides this public care, private charitable agencies began to\r\nestablish orphan asylums, and homes for friendless children. These\r\ninstitutions often developed from small beginnings into large\r\nestablishments, and began to draw on the public funds for at least\r\na part of the maintenance of their inmates, and sometimes for their\r\nentire support. It was argued that if the State did not pay for the\r\nsupport of the children in the orphan asylum it would have to take\r\ncare of them elsewhere.\r\n\r\n=No Definite Authority=: For many years the authority between State\r\nand local governing boards has been divided. As a consequence,\r\ninspection of children’s institutions has amounted to very little, or\r\nhas been, at least, ineffectual.\r\n\r\nThis inadequate inspection, in addition to divided authority,\r\nencouraged neglect and abuse. The report of conditions in private\r\ninstitutions in New York City, made in 1916 as the result of an\r\nofficial investigation, showed that dirt, insufficient food, vermin,\r\ndisease, and lack of common sanitary precautions were common.\r\nEducation was so much below the standard of the public school, with\r\nlittle or no vocational training, that children were discharged with\r\nno preparation for earning a living. There was not only an utter\r\nabsence of home atmosphere, but methods and restrictions were used\r\nlike a prison or reformatory. So little care was given when the\r\nchildren left the institution, that they often went out entirely\r\nfriendless, with no one to call upon for council or advice, and\r\nutterly unprepared for independent life.\r\n\r\nThese conditions were allowed to exist, partly because of the divided\r\nauthority and responsibility, largely because those in authority\r\nwere not deeply interested. As the report said, “the committing\r\nauthorities have not looked upon the problem as of sufficient moment\r\nto make it any part of their business to formulate and promulgate any\r\ncompetent standard to govern the service maintained in children’s\r\ninstitutions.”\r\n\r\nNew York City has tried the experiment of “boarding out” all\r\ndependent children between two and seven years of age, taking care to\r\nplace Catholic children in Catholic homes, Jewish children in Jewish\r\nhomes, and so forth. In some respects, this is a better method than\r\ncommitting children to institutions, but it is only successful if\r\nthe child is carefully placed, and its welfare watched by appointed\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nIn New York State, 1900-1913, the average infant mortality-rate\r\nof children under two years of age was 86.4 per 1,000, while the\r\ndeath-rate in eleven large infant asylums was 422.5 per 1,000. That\r\nis, under the care of the mother, even including the ignorant mother,\r\nonly one-fifth as many babies died as when the children were cared\r\nfor by the State.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that children are not only safer and healthier\r\nwith their own mothers than in institutions, but that they have a\r\nbetter chance with foster mothers than in asylums. In 1914, the New\r\nYork City Health Department, as an experiment, placed seventy-five\r\ninfants to board with foster mothers, with the result that the infant\r\ndeath-rate dropped forty-eight per cent.\r\n\r\n=Boards of Child Welfare=: In 1915, the Legislature authorized\r\nthe appointment of boards of child welfare in each county. These\r\nboards were to investigate needy cases and had the power to grant an\r\nallowance to a destitute mother for the care of her children.[6] This\r\nwork is dependent on the appropriations granted by the county. County\r\nauthorities are slow to act in matters that require appropriations.\r\nAt the end of the first year, fifty-seven counties had organized\r\nboards, but only thirty-four had made appropriations; 6,014 children\r\nhad been kept from asylums and 1,969 homes had been saved from being\r\nbroken up. In New York City, the number of children in institutions\r\nhas decreased 3,000 since the Child Welfare Board began its work. In\r\n1917 New York City appropriated $1,250,000 for widowed mothers. The\r\n_average monthly allowance_, the first year of the Welfare Board’s\r\nwork, for each child under sixteen, was _$7.99_, which is _$3 less_\r\nthan it would have cost to keep the child in an institution.\r\n\r\nIt is now admitted that everything possible should be done to\r\nprevent a home from being broken up by poverty; that if the mother\r\nis living, and is a fit person to bring up her children, it should\r\nbe made possible for her to keep them. That the mother is usually a\r\nfit person to bring up her child, is proved by the experience of the\r\nBoard of Child Welfare of New York City, which examined four thousand\r\ncases of mothers who applied for pensions, and found only in fourteen\r\ncases that the mother was not to be so trusted.\r\n\r\nIn many of the Western States the widowed mothers’ compensation, or\r\npension laws, have been extended to cover children of delinquent,\r\ninjured, or crippled fathers, and sometimes even of fathers\r\nimprisoned in penal institutions.\r\n\r\nSome States also have other provisions which reduce the number of\r\ndependent children. In Washington a man who deserts his family is\r\nput to work and his wages are paid to his wife and children. This\r\nseems more sensible than the law which imprisons the man, and lets\r\nthe State support him, while his wife has to support herself and\r\nchildren. In Kansas, the wages of a prisoner are given to his\r\nfamily. In California and Illinois, the father must help support the\r\nillegitimate child.\r\n\r\nThe care of dependent children is work for which women are especially\r\nfitted by both training and inclination. In Colorado, the State Home\r\nfor Dependent Children must have two women on its board of five\r\nmembers. In the State Industrial Home for Girls, three of the five\r\nmembers of the board must be women.\r\n\r\n=The Problem of the Delinquent Child= is one that needs the greatest\r\ncare and expert attention. If the dependent child is an appealing\r\nfigure, the delinquent child is an indictment of a community. He\r\nis usually the product of neglect, of overcrowding, of bad living\r\nconditions, and of defects in the educational system.\r\n\r\nTo treat the child offender as if he were grown up and responsible,\r\nand to punish him in the same way as an adult, is to make a criminal\r\nof him. The manner in which his first offense against the law is\r\nhandled, often determines the future of such a child.\r\n\r\n=Children’s Courts=: It used to be common for children of all ages to\r\nbe detained with older, hardened criminals indiscriminately, exposed\r\nto contamination and disease, and to try them in an open court-room\r\nwith all other cases. The modern policy is to try all cases against\r\nchildren, with the exception of murder, in special courts.\r\n\r\nThe entire policy of a children’s court is based on prevention\r\ninstead of punishment, to make friends with a delinquent child, to\r\nshow him the danger ahead of him, to watch over him like an older,\r\nwiser friend, and to help him to keep straight. The terror and\r\ndisgrace of an open court-room are replaced by a quiet, friendly talk\r\nin the judge’s room.\r\n\r\nA large number of all children who are arrested are ungovernable\r\nor disorderly, children who have run away from home, or who are\r\nassociating with dissolute or vicious persons. Another large class\r\ncomes into the courts because of improper guardianship; neglected\r\nchildren, or those exposed to physical or moral danger. These cases\r\nare not classed technically as delinquents, but are tried by what are\r\nknown as special proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe total number of children arraigned in the children’s courts of\r\nNew York City in 1916 for delinquency was: boys, 5,929; girls, 150;\r\nin special proceedings, boys, 3,893; girls, 2,972, a total of 12,944.\r\nThe largest percentage of cases for any offense for boys was petty\r\nlarceny, and for girls was sex offenses and incorrigibility.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the Police Department of New York City made in its report\r\nan analysis of juvenile arrests, showing the nature of the offense,\r\nthe age, sex, nativity, occupation, and employment of the child.\r\nThe largest number of arrests were for offenses against property.\r\nPractically half of all the delinquents were native-born children of\r\nforeign-born parents.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the police force of New York City during the last\r\nfew years has been helpful in handling the problem of juvenile\r\ndelinquency. The police are now instructed to try to prevent small\r\ninfringements of the law by children, and many trivial offenses are\r\nadjusted out of court.\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of the children who come repeatedly into\r\nthe children’s courts are feeble-minded. During 1917, the children’s\r\ncourt of New York City, for the first time, had a clinic attached\r\nto the court, where children suspected of being mentally deficient\r\ncould be examined. There is still, however, no place where they can\r\nbe committed temporarily for observation, and there is great need of\r\na graded institution that will provide for the treatment and care of\r\nthe different classes of mentally deficient children.\r\n\r\nThe system of probation for child offenders is of the greatest\r\npossible assistance in reclaiming the child; it also decreases the\r\nnumber of children who are committed to institutions, thus saving the\r\nState money. To make probation effective, children must be visited\r\nfrequently in their homes, and be kept on probation long enough to\r\nmake probable a complete reformation. Women, and not men, should be\r\nappointed as probation officers for delinquent girls, but, as the\r\nappointments are often political, men are given the preference, and\r\nare even put in charge of girls.\r\n\r\nThe present Children’s Court in Greater New York dates from 1915, and\r\nunder the presiding justice of the court has been brought to a high\r\nstate of intelligent and sympathetic handling. The city of Buffalo\r\nalso makes special provision for delinquent children. In most of the\r\ncities of the State, the judges of the court of special sessions set\r\ncertain days for children’s cases.\r\n\r\nAmong the improvements needed in the New York State law is a\r\nprovision to give the children’s court jurisdiction over children\r\nof sixteen and seventeen years of age. This is especially needed\r\nin cases of wayward girls. In Colorado the juvenile court handles\r\ncases of offenders under eighteen. Also, it is a criminal offense\r\nin Colorado to contribute to the delinquency of a child, and the\r\nchildren’s court has jurisdiction over adults contributing to such\r\ndelinquency. This is a provision needed in the New York State law.\r\nColorado also has a law prohibiting the publication of the name or\r\npicture of a girl under eighteen in a case of delinquency. This is\r\nimportant, as procurers and other men who have been the cause of a\r\ngirl’s delinquency often go free, because the girl and her family\r\nwish to avoid publicity.\r\n\r\nThe children’s courts in New York State should also have the power to\r\nappoint legal guardians for children in case of need.\r\n\r\nTo be a judge of a juvenile court requires exceptional\r\nqualifications: quick sympathy, and intelligent understanding of the\r\nmany causes which contribute to child delinquency.\r\n\r\nA large part of the problem comes back to the environment of the\r\nchild, to crowded living conditions, deficient education, lack of\r\nvocational training, and absence of opportunities for recreation.\r\nThe pitiful striving of children for pleasure and play, and the\r\ninadequate provisions of our cities to meet this need, are often\r\nresponsible for the first delinquent step. Many improvements in this\r\ndirection, as well as improvements in the law, are needed to bring\r\nthe protection that New York State gives its children up to the level\r\nof the best found in other States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Unfortunately, the law expressly excludes in its provisions for\r\nrelief families with alien fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nCHILD WAGE-EARNERS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Children are the most important assets of a nation.=\r\n\r\nWhile every one, individually, would admit this statement, it is not\r\neasy to persuade the government that the protection and development\r\nof child life cannot be left safely to private initiative, any more\r\nthan can animal or plant life; that, in addition to the protection\r\nof the individual family, children need the fostering care of the\r\norganized government. For many years, the government, both State and\r\nNational, has dealt generously with the agricultural interests of the\r\ncountry. When disease has broken out among either animals or plants,\r\nit has had its experts ready to send out at a moment’s notice to any\r\npart of the country. It has spent vast sums of money to investigate\r\nand eradicate boll-weevil in cotton, and hoof-and-mouth disease among\r\ncattle, and to develop a better strain in many animals and plants,\r\nbut it is only very recently that it has been willing to investigate\r\nthe needs of the children of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations of the Federal government for animal life, in\r\n1915, were over $5,000,000; for child life, $164,000. In 1917, an\r\nadditional appropriation of $150,000 was made for the enforcement of\r\nthe Federal Child Labor Law.\r\n\r\n=Federal Child Labor Law=: For fourteen years, the National Child\r\nLabor Committee has tried to get laws passed which would limit the\r\nhours of work for children, the kind of work they might do, and the\r\nage at which they might be put to work. Discouraged by the State by\r\nState method, the committee inaugurated a campaign for a Federal\r\nchild labor law, and after three years of effort succeeded in getting\r\nit passed.\r\n\r\nMen have an eight-hour day in many States. Women have an eight-hour\r\nday in a few States. Until the Federal bill was passed, children of\r\ntender years in a number of States could be employed almost unlimited\r\nhours and all night.\r\n\r\nAt the time the bill was passed three States permitted children\r\nunder fourteen to work ten and eleven hours a day, and two States\r\npermitted them to work at night. Nineteen mining States permitted\r\nchildren under sixteen to work in mines.\r\n\r\nNine States permitted children under sixteen to do night work. In\r\nthree Southern States, one-fifth of all the cotton-mill workers, in\r\n1913, were children less than sixteen years of age.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Child Labor Bill, which went into effect September 1,\r\n1917, was declared unconstitutional by a United States District\r\nCourt in North Carolina, and is now before the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. This law prohibits the interstate commerce of articles\r\nwhich children have helped to make. It does not control the labor\r\nof children in local occupations. Street trades, messenger service,\r\nagricultural work, and housework are not touched by it. This law is a\r\ngreat step in advance for the protection of children, but there are\r\nstill 1,859,000 children, from ten to sixteen years old, at work in\r\nthe United States whom the Federal law does not touch.\r\n\r\n=New York State Laws=: For many years New York State has been\r\nbuilding up a code of protection for the children of the State.\r\nChildren under sixteen years of age are not permitted to work unless\r\nthey have a special permit, and they must have completed the sixth\r\ngrade in school. A physical examination of the child is required to\r\nsee that he is able to stand the strain of the industry in which he\r\nis about to engage, and proof of age is required. To sell newspapers,\r\nboys from twelve to fourteen must have a permit and a badge. Boys\r\nof fourteen and fifteen are required to have badges if they have a\r\nprescribed route for the delivery of newspapers, but not if they are\r\nselling for themselves. Children under sixteen are not allowed to\r\nwork more than eight hours a day. To enforce these laws adequately,\r\nmany inspectors are needed and unceasing vigilance on the part of the\r\npublic. While the provisions of the law concerning newsboys are very\r\nclear, and are generally obeyed in New York City, they are seldom\r\nenforced elsewhere in the State.\r\n\r\nTo allow children to enter the industrial world at an early age,\r\nwithout preparation, and with no guidance as to the sort of work\r\nfor which they are best fitted, is unfair to them. The boy or girl\r\nwho gets a job at fourteen, without any vocational training, is apt\r\nto remain an unskilled worker all his or her life. The range of\r\noccupations open to such children is small. The largest number of\r\nboys who go to work at an early age become delivery boys, errand\r\nor wagon boys, or newsboys. There is little chance among these\r\nemployments for real training or for any future advancement.\r\n\r\nA careful study, by the National Child Labor Committee, of certain\r\ncases brought into the Children’s Court, has established the fact\r\nthat a large proportion of the boys and girls who come into the\r\ncourt come from the ranks of child workers. This investigation has\r\nalso proved the need of adequate vocational guidance. The present\r\nschool course gives little help in this direction to children who\r\nare leaving school at fourteen or fifteen, and parents are often as\r\nignorant of industrial conditions as the children. After a few years\r\nin an occupation that offers no opportunity for development, the boy\r\nor girl who went to work so young is often left stranded, not only\r\nuntrained, but demoralized.\r\n\r\nThere is need also of making parents understand that better\r\nopportunities are open to children who have had education beyond the\r\nelementary grades.\r\n\r\n=Street Trades= of all kinds are regarded by social experts as unsafe\r\nfor children. Some authorities recommend the absolute prohibition of\r\nall street trading for boys under seventeen. These trades, including\r\nselling newspapers, appeal to boys because they like the excitement\r\nof street life, and the spending-money which they give them.\r\n\r\nA judge of the Detroit Juvenile Court says, “At least fifty per cent.\r\nof the boys brought into the juvenile court are newsboys.” An old\r\nnewsboy, when asked what night work on the streets had done for him,\r\nsaid: “When I was a kid, it wasn’t like it is now. They didn’t have\r\nno midnight edition—I always had to be home by eight o’clock. When I\r\ngot to selling at night I started in high school, but when it came\r\ntime for the first examination, I said, ‘Oh, I’ll just quit. I’d\r\nrather be out on the streets, anyway.’” In Baltimore it is estimated\r\nthat 45 per cent. of all the children in the near-by reform school\r\nhave been street workers.\r\n\r\nInvestigations have proved the theory is false that a child is\r\nusually put to work “to support a widowed mother.” More often the\r\nchild in a street trade is found to come from a home where there is\r\nno need of his work, and in these trades the earnings of children are\r\nvery small. In a recent investigation, in Seattle, the earnings of\r\nnewsboys were found in 46 per cent. of the cases of the elementary\r\nschool paper-sellers to be less than $5 a month.\r\n\r\nThe night messenger service is known to be a demoralizing occupation,\r\nunfit for any small boy, and in New York it is prohibited to all boys\r\nunder twenty-one. The same protection of the law is now needed for\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nMany parents do not realize the serious results of letting their\r\nchildren go to work too young, or the bad effects of over-work\r\non them. The tendency of over-fatigue is to break down the moral\r\nresistance. The release from supervision which is brought about by\r\ntheir wage-earning, and the danger of their having money of their own\r\nto spend, added to the interruption of their education, cannot help\r\nbut have a demoralizing effect on them.\r\n\r\n=Rural Child Workers= are quite as common as city workers, but they\r\nare not so often wage-earners. Their labor is usually taken by\r\nparents as a matter of course, and they are not paid. Farming and\r\nhousework are two occupations which engage many children, and there\r\nis almost a complete absence of laws regulating them.\r\n\r\nA distinction should be made between the farmer lad who does\r\n“chores” night and morning, and the boy who is kept out of school\r\nmost of the year to be a farm-hand; and between the girl who helps\r\nher mother out of school hours, and the girl who is kept at work\r\nin a canning-factory, and goes from one to another as fruits and\r\nvegetables ripen; but neither the chores nor the housework should be\r\nallowed to interfere with the regularity of school attendance. The\r\nboy who is kept at farm labor, without education, and the girl who is\r\nkept at work in the canning industry at the expense of her schooling,\r\nare as much in the ranks of child laborers as the cotton-mill\r\nworkers, and they suffer in the same way from lack of training for a\r\nuseful future.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made in combining the work that the boy does\r\nnight and morning on the farm, with the school work. Under proper\r\nguidance, the chores that the boy has to do at home can be made a\r\nmeans of education. For example: a pupil who assists at home in the\r\nmilking might be required to keep a daily record of each cow, with\r\nthe fluctuations in the yield of milk, due to weather and food. This\r\ncombining of the necessary home work with the instruction of the\r\nschool has been made a success in some of the Western States, where\r\ncounty superintendents supervise the home-school work and make it of\r\nthe greatest possible educational value.\r\n\r\nRural school terms are usually shorter than city terms, and irregular\r\nattendance is more frequent. Only 68 per cent. of the pupils enrolled\r\nin rural schools attend daily, while in cities the percentage is 80.\r\nThe absences of girls are caused largely by housework.\r\n\r\nThe results of child labor in the country are seen in the high\r\npercentage of rejections from military service on account of physical\r\ndefects in men from rural districts, and the larger percentage of\r\nilliteracy in country communities compared with that in cities.\r\nBetter and more adequate education for the thousands of children on\r\nthe farms of the State is one of our immediate needs.\r\n\r\nIt is the right of every child to be given enough education to give\r\nhim a good start in life. The child-labor problem is largely a school\r\nproblem. Keep the children in school, and there will be no child\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n=War and Children=: The war has brought a new demand for the labor\r\nof children, and new evidence of the serious consequences of using\r\nthis labor. In England and France, juvenile delinquency due to the\r\nbreaking down of educational facilities, and the exploitation of\r\nchildren in shops and factories, has increased to a point where both\r\nnations are aroused by a new national danger. To meet the sudden\r\ngreat need for munitions, and the speeding up of all industry,\r\nchildren of all ages, and women of all classes, went into the\r\nfactories. In England, it is estimated that 200,000 children from\r\neleven to thirteen years of age left school to go to work. Abnormally\r\nhigh wages were paid them. With fathers at the front and mothers away\r\nfrom home in munition factories, these children roamed the streets\r\nafter their work was done, with pockets filled with money to spend,\r\nand no one to exercise a restraining hand.\r\n\r\nStreets are unlighted, the police force has been decreased, churches,\r\nschools, and settlement work are interrupted. Is it any wonder that\r\nsince the war began juvenile delinquency has increased 46 per cent.\r\nin Edinburgh, 56 per cent. in Manchester, and thefts 50 per cent.?\r\n\r\nThe same demand for child labor has begun to be manifest in this\r\ncountry. The United States is being called on to feed the world, and\r\nto make supplies of all kinds for our allies, besides the tremendous\r\nneed of supplies for our own armies. Millions of men are being drawn\r\nfrom the ranks of producers, and have become consumers. The world is\r\nconsuming and destroying on a scale never known before in history.\r\nThe demand for more and more labor is becoming ever more insistent.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the warnings which have come to us from England and\r\nFrance, of the necessity of guarding against the exploitation of our\r\nchildren during the war, New York State was one of the first to try\r\nto break down the restrictions built up during many years of the past\r\nwith such infinite labor.\r\n\r\nThe Brown bills, which passed the Legislature last winter, were\r\na frank attempt to utilize the labor of children. They made it\r\npossible, at the discretion of the State Labor Commission, to\r\nabrogate every law that has been passed in New York State to\r\nsafeguard its children. One bill would have made it possible to\r\nutilize the labor of children unlimited hours, seven days in the\r\nweek, including night labor. This was vetoed by the Governor.\r\nThe other, which makes possible the suspension of the compulsory\r\neducation law, in order that children may work on the farms, has\r\nbecome a law. Other attempts will undoubtedly be made to exploit\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIt will require unceasing vigilance on the part of the people of\r\nthe State to see that measures detrimental to children shall not be\r\nsuccessful. Attempts are being made to remove the limit of hours, and\r\nto abolish the requirement that children between fourteen and sixteen\r\nshall have working papers. Such measures mean that the physical\r\nexamination now required would not be made, and that the necessity\r\nof furnishing proof of the age of the applicant would be eliminated.\r\nThe first would permit weak, sickly children to go to work in the\r\nfactories, and the second would encourage the employment of children\r\nunder fourteen.\r\n\r\nThe need for increased labor is a real one, and as long as the war\r\nlasts it will continue to grow. But the nation that exploits its\r\nchildren while at war is bleeding at both ends. It is the province of\r\nwomen to watch over and guard all children. Now that they have the\r\nvote, the responsibility has been put directly on them, and they have\r\nthe power to meet it.\r\n\r\nBecause of the tremendous cost of war in human life itself, it\r\nbecomes doubly important to safeguard human life at its source, and\r\nthat is our job.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—The material used in this chapter is largely taken from\r\n  publications of the National Child Labor Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nPUBLIC CHARITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public institutions of the State are grouped under three heads:\r\nthe State Commission in Lunacy, the Prison Commission, and the State\r\nBoard of Charities.\r\n\r\n=The State Board of Charities=, which has general supervision of the\r\ncharitable institutions of the State, consists of twelve members, of\r\nwhom nine must be appointed as commissioners from the nine judicial\r\ndistricts of the State, and three from New York City. The law\r\nprescribes otherwise no qualifications for membership on this board.\r\n(A recent innovation has been made in the appointment of a woman on\r\nthe board.) The commissioners serve without salary, but each one is\r\npaid his expenses and $10 for each day’s attendance at meetings, not\r\nto exceed $500 a year.\r\n\r\n=Partly State, Partly Private=: Some charitable institutions in the\r\nState are wholly controlled by the State or one of its subdivisions;\r\nothers are controlled by private corporations, but are maintained\r\neither wholly, or in part, by State funds. There are over six hundred\r\nand forty charitable institutions which receive money from the State.\r\nThere are still other institutions which are entirely supported by\r\nprivate funds. The State Board of Charities has not the authority\r\nat present to inspect organized charities which do not receive\r\npublic money, so there are many institutions which are without the\r\nprotection of State inspection, and the total amount of dependency in\r\nthe State is not known officially.\r\n\r\n=Duties of the Board=: Besides its duties of inspection and general\r\nsupervision of charitable institutions, the board has the control of\r\nthe incorporation of charitable institutions, and must approve of\r\nan application for a certificate of incorporation before it can be\r\ngranted. It also issues licenses for medical dispensaries, and makes\r\nrules and regulations under which they must work.\r\n\r\n=The Powers of the Board Are Limited=, as the carrying out of its\r\nrecommendations often depends on action by the State Legislature,\r\nand especially on the amount of the appropriations granted for the\r\nwork. The powers originally given the board have also been greatly\r\nimpaired by the action of the Legislature from time to time in\r\ncreating other agencies, which have resulted in a duplication of\r\nwork and an overlapping of authority. There is much complaint of\r\ninstitutions being overrun by official visitors, and inspectors with\r\nconflicting authority, who are said to interfere with the work of the\r\ninstitutions without accomplishing adequate results.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the board have been especially curtailed since the\r\noffice of _Fiscal Supervisor of State Charities_ was created in 1902.\r\nWhen decisions are to be made concerning appropriations for State\r\ncharities, in making up the legislative budget, the Fiscal Supervisor\r\nis consulted to the exclusion of the State Board. In reality the\r\nFiscal Supervisor has far greater powers than the State Board of\r\nCharities, as no appropriations can be made unless approved by him.\r\nHis effort is to keep down appropriations wherever possible, and he\r\ndoes not come in direct personal touch with the needs of the work.\r\n\r\nThe power to fix salaries and establish positions has been given to\r\nthe _Salary Classification Commission_, and to locate new buildings\r\nto the _Commission on Sites, Grounds, and Buildings_.\r\n\r\nThe general dissatisfaction with the confused and conflicting\r\nauthority, which had come with different legislative enactments, led\r\nto the appointment in 1916, of a commissioner to investigate State\r\ncharities and to report to the Governor, with recommendations of\r\nchanges he deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nAmong the changes recommended were:\r\n\r\n(1) That instead of an unpaid board of twelve members, appointed from\r\nthe judicial districts, there should be a board of nine, of whom\r\none should be a woman; three members should be paid and should give\r\nall their time to the work, one of the three to be president of the\r\nboard, one the chairman of a bureau for mental deficiency, and the\r\nthird, chairman of a bureau for dependent children; the six unpaid\r\nmembers were to be specialists in the special classes of work which\r\nis supervised by the board.\r\n\r\nThe present State Board of Charities objects to this change on the\r\nground that a board so organized would become political. They also\r\nfeel that the appointments should continue to be made from the\r\njudicial districts, in order that every part of the State should have\r\na resident member of the State Board.\r\n\r\nThe report further recommended: (2) Prompt provision for defective\r\ndelinquents; (3) a careful revision of the State charities and\r\npoor law; (4) that power should be given the State Board to\r\ninspect private charitable institutions; (5) the creation of a new\r\nbureau for dependent children; (6) the abolition of the office\r\nof Fiscal Supervisor of Charities, in order that recommendations\r\nfor appropriations should come directly from the State Board of\r\nCharities; (7) the abolition of other conflicting authorities, and\r\nrestoring the authority of the State Board.\r\n\r\nNone of these recommendations have been acted upon as yet.\r\n\r\nThe State institutions that are under the State are the following:\r\nState Agricultural and Industrial School, Industry; Syracuse State\r\nInstitution for Feeble-minded Children, Syracuse; New York State\r\nSchool for the Blind, Batavia; Thomas Indian School, Iroquois; State\r\nCustodial Asylum for Feeble-minded Women, Newark; New York State\r\nSoldiers’ and Sailors’ Home, Bath; New York State Training School\r\nfor Girls, Hudson; Western House of Refuge for Women, Albion; New\r\nYork State Reformatory for Women, Bedford Hills; Rome Custodial State\r\nAsylum, Rome; Craig Colony for Epileptics, Sonyea; New York State\r\nWoman’s Relief Corps Home, Oxford; New York State Hospital for the\r\nCare of Crippled and Deformed Children, West Haverstraw; New York\r\nState Hospital for the Treatment of Incipient Pulmonary Tuberculosis,\r\nRaybrook; New York State Training School for Boys, established by\r\nlaw in 1904, not yet ready to receive inmates; Letchworth Village\r\nfor Feeble-minded, Rockland County; and authorized in 1911-12, but\r\nnot yet open: The State Industrial Farm Colony, Green Haven; and the\r\nState Reformatory for Misdemeanants.\r\n\r\nPrivate institutions supported mainly by State appropriations are:\r\nNew York Institution for the Instruction of Deaf and Dumb; New York\r\nSociety for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents in the City\r\nof New York; New York Institute for the Education of the Blind;\r\nInstitutions for Deaf Mutes in New York City, Buffalo, Westchester,\r\nRome, Rochester; Malone and Albany Home Schools for the Oral\r\nInstruction of the Deaf.\r\n\r\n=County and City Institutions=: County and city almshouses are\r\nunder the supervision of the State Board of Charities, and also the\r\nrecently established county sanatoria for tuberculosis, of which\r\nthere are about thirty. The small number of patients in these county\r\nhospitals for tuberculosis makes it impossible for some of them to\r\ngive as expert and efficient care as a larger and better equipped\r\nhospital might offer.[7]\r\n\r\n=The Department of State and Alien Poor=, of the State Board of\r\nCharities, has the supervision of the State poor, and of alien and\r\nIndian dependents. It also has the power to transfer aliens, or\r\nnon-residents, who have become public charges, to their home county\r\nor State, or, in co-operation with the United States Immigration\r\nauthorities, to return them to their home countries. This department\r\nhas saved the State large sums of money.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, 810 persons were returned to their homes in other States or\r\ncountries, by this department, of whom 250 were alien poor.\r\n\r\n=Local Boards of Managers=: Each State charitable and reformatory\r\ninstitution is administered and controlled by a board of local\r\nmanagers, appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate.\r\nThese boards usually consist of seven persons who serve without pay,\r\nfor their expenses only. There are some women on these local boards,\r\nbut not nearly as many as there might be, considering the number of\r\ninstitutions which have women in their charge.\r\n\r\nThe superintendents of State institutions are all carefully selected\r\nfrom the civil service lists.\r\n\r\nThe employees of these institutions form a difficult problem. The old\r\nconception of an attendant for a public institution was exceedingly\r\nlow; the standard is still far from good. The salaries paid are\r\ninsufficient to attract intelligent service.\r\n\r\n=The Department of Inspection=: There are over six hundred\r\ninstitutions in the State which come under the Department of\r\nInspection. To handle them there are eight inspectors, and one\r\nsuperintendent of inspection.\r\n\r\n=Almshouses= are inspected and graded in three classes. Of the\r\ncounties that were reported in 1917 as first class in both\r\nadministration and plant are: Allegany, Chautauqua, Genesee,\r\nJefferson, Lewis, Monroe, Niagara, Saratoga, Schenectady, and Wayne\r\ncounties. Those second class in both administration and plant\r\nwere: Dutchess, Herkimer, Madison, Rockland, Schoharie, and Ulster\r\ncounties. The only one third class in both plant and administration\r\nwas in Sullivan County.\r\n\r\n=Provision for the Feeble-minded= is the greatest present need of the\r\ncharities of the State. Mental defectives are at large all over the\r\nState, and they are found in all institutions. They are a source of\r\ntrouble in the public schools, and are a constant danger to the State.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there are not less than 30,000 of these\r\nunfortunates. The State institutions have room for about 5,700, but\r\nthey are actually caring for 6,700. For years efforts have been\r\nmade to get the Legislature to make adequate provision for their\r\nsegregation. The report of one institution for feeble-minded women\r\nsays, “nine of the women admitted were married and had given birth\r\nto thirty-seven children; twenty-six of those admitted had borne\r\nforty-three illegitimate children; making a total of eighty children\r\nborn to those unfortunate women.”\r\n\r\nLetchworth Village, in Rockland County, a plot of 2,000 acres,\r\nwas planned to provide for 2,500 to 3,000 feeble-minded. It was\r\nestablished in 1907, and in 1916 still had a capacity of only 330.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the State to complete a project it had undertaken is\r\nshown also in the New York State Training School for Boys at Yorktown\r\nHeights. This was planned to be a reformatory of the modern cottage\r\ntype to take the place of the very old one on Randall’s Island, and\r\nwas greatly needed for delinquent boys. After twelve years of delay,\r\nand after $800,000 had been appropriated by the State and most of it\r\nexpended, this project has been abandoned. The reason given for the\r\nfinal decision to abandon the site, was the possible contamination\r\nof the Croton water supply by the institution. With modern methods\r\nof sewage disposal it seems as if it would have been possible to\r\nguard against this danger. It would have been easier to insure proper\r\ntreatment of the sewage from such an institution than from the towns\r\nand villages which exist in the Croton watershed. The State Board of\r\nCharities recommends now an appropriation of $150,000 for a new site\r\nand plans.\r\n\r\n=Recommendations of the State Board=: Intelligent handling of the\r\nproblem of dependency must deal with causes. Probably the major part\r\ncould be done away with if the State would adopt adequate preventive\r\nmeasures. The board recommends as an aid to this end: (1) Industrial\r\ninsurance; (2) better housing, including the destruction of the worst\r\ncongested areas in cities, and the prevention of further congestion;\r\n(3) vocational training for children; (4) improved labor laws,\r\nrestricting the hours of labor, and compensation for accidents to\r\nemployees; (5) adequate pensions to widowed mothers.\r\n\r\nThey also recommend: That further provision be made for tuberculosis,\r\nwhich the records of the State Health Department show is increasing;\r\nthat the office of County Superintendent of the Poor should be\r\nappointive and be included in the Civil Service. The frequent\r\nchanging of poor-law officials, and their lack of knowledge of the\r\nsubject, are drawbacks in the discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\n=The State Commission in Lunacy= has charge of the hospitals for the\r\ninsane. All the insane come under the direct charge of the State.\r\nThis is a salaried commission consisting of three members. There are\r\nlocal boards of managers for these insane asylums as for the other\r\ncharitable institutions, and a majority of the members of these local\r\nboards are required to visit the hospitals at least once a month for\r\ninspection.[8]\r\n\r\n=The State Prison Commission=, like the State Board of Charities,\r\nis an unpaid board, but the Superintendent of Prisons is a State\r\nofficial with a salary.\r\n\r\nThere has been for years a provision of the State law which gives one\r\nscale of salaries for men employed in these institutions and a lower\r\none for women.\r\n\r\n  Pay of Stenographers (male)    $70-80  a month\r\n    ”          ”       (female)   50-68     ”\r\n  Chief Supervisors (male)        55-68     ”\r\n    ”        ”      (female)      50-62     ”\r\n\r\nSince women have been given the vote, it is probable that this law\r\nwill be changed and equal pay given for equal work.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] It is hoped that when the Boards of Managers for these county\r\ntuberculosis hospitals are appointed, local women will be placed on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[8] The number of insane in the State is increasing far more rapidly\r\nthan the provision which is being made for them. The last report of\r\nthe State Hospital Commission shows that in hospitals for the insane,\r\nplanned to accommodate 27,890 patients, there were in June, 1916,\r\n33,873 patients, an overcrowding of 21.5 per cent. The State Hospital\r\nCommission urgently requests a bond issue to provide immediately for\r\nthe construction of new buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTHE PROTECTION OF WORKING-WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war has brought a revolution in woman’s work.\r\n\r\nBecause of the increased demand for labor, trades and all kinds of\r\nemployment that have been considered exclusively the province of\r\nmen, have been opened to women. The universal verdict is that they\r\nhave everywhere made good. Work that demands the greatest exactness\r\nand care, specialized technical operations that have been supposed\r\nto require a man’s brain, have been done by them quite as well as by\r\nmen. But their employment in many of the new industries has brought\r\nnew industrial problems, and they have gone into many new occupations\r\nwhich are not included in the protection extended by existing labor\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nEven before the war New York State was the greatest industrial State\r\nin the Union. More women were at work here than in any other State,\r\nand more women were at work in New York City than in any entire State\r\nexcept Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThere were 248 separate manufacturing industries in this State, and\r\nwomen worked in all trades in which over 1,000 workers were employed,\r\nexcept in the manufacture of bricks, tiles, fertilizers, and ice.\r\n\r\nThey were doing everything, from making cores in foundries, sausages\r\nin packing-houses, pickles and candies, to working in human hair,\r\nchemicals, and rags.\r\n\r\nWomen have always done their share of the world’s work, but in the\r\npast their labor was in the home. During the early years of our\r\nnation there were very few women who did not work or supervise work,\r\nbut they did this in their homes for their homes, and they were not\r\npaid in money.\r\n\r\nWhen the cotton-gin was invented and the use of steam was discovered,\r\nit was the dream of the inventors that their machines should be\r\nreally labor-saving, and that people would have leisure for the\r\ndevelopment of the wider and deeper things of life. This became true\r\nfor some people, and to-day there are many women of comparative\r\nleisure who can do as they please with their time. But on the other\r\nhand, undreamed-of evils and dangers have come to women who toil,\r\nand necessity compels women by the millions to seek work in the\r\nindustrial world. In spite of the fact that the wages of women have\r\nbeen appallingly low, the woman who must earn money in order to live\r\nhas had to find work outside of her own home.\r\n\r\n=Number of Women Wage-earners=: In 1910, according to the census,\r\nthere were in New York State 3,291,714 women over fifteen years of\r\nage; only 1,793,558 were married, and 1,498,156 were unmarried or\r\nwidowed; 983,686 of these had to work in order to live, or to support\r\nsome members of their families. This number did not include the great\r\nmass of women who work in their homes.\r\n\r\n=Clothing Manufacturers=: Before the United States entered the war,\r\n184,691 women were working in New York State making every conceivable\r\ngarment for people to wear. The work is subdivided so that one worker\r\ndoes one thing all day long. There are sixty-five operations in\r\nthe making of trousers. Twenty to sixty different operations take\r\nplace in the making of men’s shirts. Women tuck or hem materials for\r\nwomen’s wear hour by hour, driven by the juggernaut electric machine\r\nwhich knows no fatigue and needs no rest.\r\n\r\n=Laundries=: Ten thousand women worked in laundries in this State,\r\nwhere the washing and ironing are done usually by machines. They\r\nstand and push down a treadle of the ironing-machine with their feet,\r\nmaking as many as sixty-three to eighty-one foot pressures a minute.\r\nIn this action a bad twist of the body is necessary, which may\r\nresult in permanent injury. Clouds of steam rise from the mangles,\r\nand when no exhaust hoods are used, the room is filled with steam.\r\nTuberculosis is a common disease among laundry workers. Unprotected\r\nmachinery is a constant danger.\r\n\r\n=Restaurant Workers=: There were fifteen thousand restaurant workers,\r\nwaitresses, cooks, kitchen girls, and pantry hands. Until 1917,\r\nthey were without any protection by law. They worked any number of\r\nhours, and seven days a week. They now come under the fifty-four-hour\r\nlaw, in first and second class cities, but the law is difficult to\r\nenforce. They often walk five miles a day carrying heavy trays; and\r\nvaricose veins, flat feet, and pelvic disorders are common.\r\n\r\n=Textile Operators=: In New York State 35,168 women worked in\r\ntextile-mills making silks, woolens, cottons, carpets, knit\r\nunderwear, etc. The din of machinery is deafening in many of these\r\nfactories, and often the machinery is so closely placed that there is\r\ndifficulty in passing without danger of skirts catching.\r\n\r\nThe whole development of machinery in industry has been worked out\r\nfor the purpose of extending trade and output, without consideration\r\nof the human factor involved. Machines have been watched so they did\r\nnot wear out or break, and they have been carefully repaired. Girls\r\nand women, the human factor, have been discarded if they wore out;\r\nthey are of less worth to the employer and can be easily replaced\r\nwithout cost to him. But the cost to the State has been heavy in\r\nthe toll of hospitals, insane asylums, and homes for destitutes and\r\ndelinquents.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a trade which has not some elements of danger or\r\nunhealthfulness in it. Women working in meat-packing plants in\r\nsausage-making rooms stand all day at their work on water- and\r\nslime-soaked floors. Women work in industries where industrial\r\npoisons are used or where they are generated in the process of\r\nmanufacturing. The pressure of piece-work, the monotony of one single\r\noperation, are nerve-racking and nerve-exhausting.\r\n\r\nThe health of women who spend hours a day in factories depends\r\nlargely upon factory laws and sanitary codes. Light, air, sanitation,\r\novercrowding in factories, mills, and shops, all vitally affect the\r\nhealth of the workers. No one can measure the cost of industry in\r\nthe life of women. The strength and vitality taken from them will\r\nshow in the lowered vitality of their children. A low birth-rate, a\r\nhigh death-rate, and an impaired second generation are the inevitable\r\nresults. Infant mortality where the mothers work in factories is\r\nnotoriously high.[9]\r\n\r\n=War and Woman’s Work=: With the insistent demand for increased\r\nproduction occasioned by the war, women have been brought into\r\nmany new positions formerly held only by men. They have gone\r\ninto the steel-mills; they are employed in large numbers in the\r\nmunition-factories; they are working on the railroads, in railroad\r\nyards, and inspecting tracks, as well as in the ticket-offices and\r\nbaggage-rooms. The Pennsylvania Railroad has 2,300 women employed as\r\ncar-cleaners, track-walkers, upholsterers, locomotive despatchers,\r\nand machine-hands. Some are operating trains. They are engaged as\r\nconductors on street-cars and subways, and as elevator operators.\r\n\r\nThese new industries are not included in the provisions for women of\r\nthe State labor laws.\r\n\r\nNew York State has a nine-hour day for women working in factories\r\nand mercantile occupations, and night work is prohibited in\r\nthese industries; but this protection does not extend into other\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nAn eight-hour working-day has been given to men in many States and\r\nin many occupations, but in only a few of the Western States has it\r\nbeen given to women. After three or four years in most industries,\r\nyoung women begin to wear out, the speeding up and the strain put\r\non their youth begin to tell, their capacity lessens, and their\r\noutput diminishes. Although the effect of long hours and monotonous\r\noccupation is harder on them than it is on men, the protection of\r\nthe law has been extended to them to a far less extent. In these\r\nnew industries there is none. Women may work in them twelve hours a\r\nday and all night. The demand of some of the street railways is for\r\na twelve-hour night for women conductors (with two hours off for\r\nsupper). Elevator operators work twelve hours a day, in day and\r\nnight shifts, and girls employed all night are subject to insult if\r\nnot actual danger.\r\n\r\nSince boys have been difficult to get, girls, including some under\r\nsixteen, have been delivering letters and packages in messenger\r\nservice. The State law prohibits boys under twenty-one being employed\r\nas messengers at night, because of the dangers of contamination from\r\nthe night life of a city. Under present conditions a girl employed\r\nas messenger has no protection, and may even be sent to houses of\r\ndoubtful character.\r\n\r\nThe new industries for women also include manual work that has\r\nheretofore been considered too heavy for them. The high wages paid\r\nthem, while lower than would have to be paid now to men for the same\r\nwork, are still high enough to attract women from other occupations\r\nwhere wages have not had the same advance.\r\n\r\nWhile there is an increasing demand that women shall be paid the\r\nsame wages as a man would be paid for exactly the same work, the\r\nidea still prevails that it is only fair to pay men more than women\r\nbecause they have families to support, while women support only\r\nthemselves. =This is not true.= On the backs of many women rests the\r\nsole support of aged parents, or of younger brothers and sisters. A\r\nlarge proportion of them give up all their earnings to the family\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer a question of the ability of women to do many kinds\r\nof work formerly held to be the exclusive province of men; but of the\r\neffect of her so doing on the future health and welfare of the race.\r\n\r\nWomen, like men, must work in order to live, but society and the\r\nState owe it to themselves, as a vital matter of self-protection, to\r\nsafeguard that work, so that future generations shall not suffer from\r\nits effects.\r\n\r\nThe whir of machinery, the noise, the constant standing or the\r\nclose bending over work, the meager wages, have been the conditions\r\nwoman has had to meet for years in her struggle for a livelihood;\r\nto them are now added the dangers and excessive hours of these new\r\noccupations, with their further call on her strength and endurance.\r\n\r\nThese new industries for women should be included in the laws\r\nregulating the hours and condition of women’s work. Public messenger\r\nservice is too dangerous for young girls to be employed in it.\r\n\r\nIf the eight-hour working-day is right for men, it is even more\r\nneeded by women. Laws regulating factory conditions are of little\r\nvalue unless there is sufficient inspection to enforce them, and the\r\nnumber of inspectors employed is always inadequate. Women inspectors\r\nare needed for factories in which women are employed; but there are\r\nonly four women factory inspectors in the entire State.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago the New York State Factory Investigating Commission\r\nmade an exhaustive investigation of women’s wages, and found that\r\nwomen and girls were so underpaid as to endanger their health\r\nand productiveness. Since then the cost of living has advanced\r\nprodigiously, with no corresponding increase in wages, especially\r\namong young unorganized women.\r\n\r\nA minimum wage bill, similar to the one in force in Oregon, which has\r\nbeen declared constitutional by the United States Supreme Court, is\r\nnow before the Legislature, drawn on the recommendation of the State\r\nFactory Investigating Commission.\r\n\r\nIf the war continues, the demand, not for more protection, but\r\nfor the suspension of existing labor laws, will become more\r\ninsistent. The needs of the country for increased production will be\r\nirresistible and will not be satisfied for many years.\r\n\r\nThe test which the government should insist shall be applied to every\r\noccupation in which women engage is this: What effect will it have on\r\nthe one business in life which is especially theirs, the production\r\nand conservation of human life? How can it be safeguarded so it shall\r\nnot exact too great a toll from their health and vitality?\r\n\r\nEvery consideration that individuals and the State can give must be\r\nengaged in the study of this question. With the vote in her hands,\r\nthe woman in industry will be able to protect herself better than\r\nbefore, but the responsibility for her welfare rests not on herself\r\nalone, but on other women, especially on those who are free from\r\nthe grinding struggle themselves, and can do as they choose with\r\ntheir time. It is part of their responsibility to see that the most\r\nconscientious and careful consideration be given to this question.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Thanks are due Miss Mary Dreier, a member of the recent New York\r\nState Factory Investigating Commission, for this picture of the work\r\nwhich women are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nAMERICANIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States is still a medley of foreign nationalities,\r\nrepresenting all the races of the world, with their social\r\ncharacteristics, customs, prejudices, and even language unchanged.\r\nNo one need be disconcerted by this fact, for the people who came\r\nover in the _Mayflower_ were foreign-born, the founders of the city\r\nof New York were of foreign birth, and so were the first families of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nIn New York State only 35 per cent. of the population is of native\r\nbirth and descent. Almost one-third is foreign-born; one-third of the\r\nchildren born here have one or both parents of foreign birth. Even\r\nwith all the resources at our command it would have been a giant task\r\nto have assimilated such huge numbers of such divergent races.\r\n\r\nThe United States was established as a nation where justice, freedom,\r\nand opportunity were to be assured to all the people. For over a\r\ncentury it has been a refuge for men and women of foreign lands, who\r\nhave been oppressed and have longed for freedom, and who have sought\r\nwider opportunity for themselves and their children.\r\n\r\nNative-born Americans have accepted their privileges as a matter of\r\ncourse, and without feeling the obligations they imply. They have\r\ndemanded justice and opportunity for themselves, but they have not\r\nfelt the responsibility of seeing that it was extended in equal\r\nmeasure to those who come to our shores. They have not realized\r\nthat it is the obligation of every one enjoying the privileges and\r\nbenefits of a democracy to see that these are shared and safeguarded\r\nby all the people.\r\n\r\nThe war has brought home to the nation the stern necessity of a\r\nunited country. For the safety of the nation our ideals of freedom,\r\njustice, and opportunity must be put into practice for all the people\r\nof the nation. The “square deal” that we stand for must be given\r\nat home, the opportunity for better living and the development of\r\ncharacter must not be denied any of our people. Only in this way\r\nshall we have loyal American citizens who value their allegiance and\r\nwho feel the obligation to uphold our national ideals.\r\n\r\n=The Immigrant Is a Great National Asset=: The country has been\r\nbuilt up largely by his work. The railroads, the mines, the great\r\nbuildings, the subways, waterworks, steel-mills, sugar-refining,\r\nclothes, cigars, furniture, most of the products of our factories,\r\nare made by immigrants. The great industries of the country would\r\nstop without the millions of hands that they supply.\r\n\r\nThe immigrant often comes here with high hopes of improving his\r\ncondition, and he finds himself looked down on with contempt by the\r\nnative American, exploited at every turn, and every advantage taken\r\nof his ignorance. After an alien is once admitted, there has been\r\nrelatively little attempt made to protect him, to see that he is\r\nhelped to settle where his skill can best be utilized, or even to aid\r\nhim in learning our language and customs.\r\n\r\nMany foreigners were skilled farmers before they came to this\r\ncountry, but although there is great need for such labor on the farms\r\nhere, little provision is made to use their skill in that way. The\r\nimmigrant often has to pay to get a chance to earn his living. When\r\nhe gets a job his labor is exploited; he has to accept lower wages\r\nthan an American would take; the living-quarters provided for him may\r\nnot be fit for human habitation.\r\n\r\nHere is a recent picture of a suburb of New York City, a community of\r\n16,000 foreign-born workers: The married workman pays from fifteen to\r\ntwenty dollars a month rent for a three- or four-room flat, the rooms\r\nabout ten feet square, with no light but kerosene-lamps. The average\r\nfamily has four children, and each family takes from two to six\r\nboarders to help pay the rent. The only running water is on the first\r\nfloor, and there is one out-of-door toilet. Is it any wonder that the\r\nchildren, the younger generation, are both sickly and lawless?\r\n\r\nThe factory buildings are large and well lighted, but in many\r\ncommunities of foreign-born unskilled workmen the housing provisions\r\nallow for no privacy and are a detriment to family life and morality.\r\nSuch conditions are particularly bad for the immigrant woman whose\r\nwork confines her indoors.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that the foreigner should settle with others of his\r\nown nationality, so almost every city and village in the State has\r\na colony “across the track.” In the native section there will be\r\npolice protection, paved streets, running water, sewage and garbage\r\ndisposal, but this protection often does not extend “across the\r\ntrack.” There, disorder and filth abound and the death-rate is much\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n=Every injustice to the immigrant reacts on us as a people.= He must\r\nbe given a square deal before he can be made into a loyal American.\r\n\r\nA common language is the first essential of a united nation. There\r\nare solid blocks in New York and other cities where not a word of\r\nEnglish is spoken or understood. It is hopeless to try to make\r\nAmericans of persons who do not understand our language. Speaking\r\nEnglish is the first step in citizenship, and the public schools are\r\nthe logical centers in which to make loyal Americans of our alien\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n=Night Schools= are sometimes provided, but there are many localities\r\nstill without them; and, after all, it is difficult for a man who\r\nhas been at manual labor all day to study at night. They are most\r\nsuccessful when they are made interesting with stories and games.\r\nExperiments have been made with classes held from five to seven\r\no’clock in the afternoon in the factory buildings, and employers\r\noften welcome them.\r\n\r\n=Neighborhood Classes for Women= are being held in the afternoon in\r\nsome localities. In this case the babies must be included. Provision\r\nis made for them in a separate room with a nurse or kindergartner\r\nto take charge of them. The best lessons for the mothers are not\r\nfound in books, but are based on the interests connected with their\r\ndaily lives and their domestic duties. Paper patterns and a lesson\r\nin how to make garments for her baby will chain her attention, and\r\nthe English names of articles used will be learned unconsciously.\r\n“Playing store” with the articles she depends on to feed her family\r\nwill fascinate her and teach her more practical English.\r\n\r\nThe immigrant woman is often keen to learn American ways and customs.\r\nShe is eager to know how to take better care of her family. When the\r\npublic schools of New York City give away pamphlets about economical\r\ncooking, the call for them from the mothers of the pupils is so great\r\nthat the supply is soon exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe need for some special help for the foreign woman was never\r\nas great as it is to-day. There are about four hundred thousand\r\nof them in New York State who have become citizens because their\r\nhusbands are citizens. They are going to vote. Many of them cannot\r\nspeak English. In the course of time the law providing that a woman\r\nshall take the citizenship of her husband without qualifying for it\r\nherself, may be changed, but meanwhile these women are voters. They\r\nneed help and education, and for the protection of the State the\r\ncommunity must give it to them.\r\n\r\n=Home Teaching= of women in the tenements as part of the regular\r\nschool system is being tried in California. Teachers are sent into\r\nthe homes to show by practical demonstration economical cooking, how\r\nto improve sanitary conditions, and to teach the mother how to care\r\nfor her children.\r\n\r\n=Naturalization= would do more to arouse a sense of responsibility\r\nin the alien if it were conferred with a ceremony which would appeal\r\nto the imagination. Many of the people who come to our shores come\r\nfrom countries where beauty and ceremonial are part of the national\r\nlife. The process of naturalization, as conducted in many courts, is\r\nusually perfunctory and often sordid. If the courts are crowded, an\r\napplicant may have to come six or eight times with his witnesses,\r\nlosing not only time, but being in danger of losing his job. He is\r\noften ignorant of the whole subject of government; he may know\r\nnothing of the questions involved in an election, but there is\r\nrarely an effort made to teach him anything of American ideals. The\r\npolitical club that wants his vote is the only thing connected with\r\ngovernment that pays any attention to him, or offers him help. Often\r\nhe finds that his vote has a market value. So the ballot, the symbol\r\nof freedom and self-government, becomes to him only a bit of graft.\r\nDefinite standards of citizenship that apply to all alike, better\r\ntests of their knowledge of English and of our government, would help\r\nto impress on aliens the meaning of the oath of allegiance.\r\n\r\n=Uniform Naturalization Laws=: In New York State an alien has to wait\r\nfive years to become a citizen with a vote. In Nebraska, a Turk or a\r\nGreek or an Armenian who landed six months before, if he has taken\r\nout his citizenship papers, is permitted to vote, although he may\r\nhave no educational qualifications of any kind, and know no English\r\nnor anything about our government. In seven other States a man can\r\nvote simply by declaring his intention of becoming a citizen.\r\n\r\n=Ignorance of Laws=: Besides the lack of provision for learning the\r\nduties of citizenship, there is little opportunity for the immigrant\r\neither to become familiar with our laws or to learn respect for\r\nthe law. He gets his knowledge of the vote from the ward boss, and\r\nhe learns contempt for the law when he sees the curtains of the\r\nsaloons pulled down in front, and the back door open. As he sees the\r\nconstant disregard for law all around him, liberty becomes license in\r\nhis mind. Then as he prospers and grows well-to-do, building laws,\r\nfactory inspection, fire protection, and other attempts at government\r\nregulations, often seem to him restrictions which are to be evaded as\r\nmuch as possible.\r\n\r\nSweatshops and the padrone system are to his mind part of the\r\nAmerican system for getting rich. In taking advantage of them for\r\nhis own profit he feels that he is only following the custom of the\r\ncountry. A contempt for law and opposition to any attempt of the\r\nlaw to interfere with what he considers his rights are the natural\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe study of civics[10] in the public schools should begin not in\r\nthe high schools and colleges, but in the lower grades. A majority\r\nof children leave school before they reach the grammar school. A\r\npractical course in government may be made simple and interesting\r\neven for them.\r\n\r\nThe idea has been seriously advanced that the oath of allegiance,\r\naccompanied by a dignified and beautiful ceremony, might be\r\nadministered to groups of boys and girls as they reach twenty-one\r\nyears of age, in a manner to impress on the public mind the value of\r\ncitizenship. The “citizen receptions” which have been given monthly\r\nin Cleveland and Los Angeles, to the new citizens of that period,\r\nhave done this. After a patriotic program, with the judge of the\r\ncourt presiding, each successful applicant is very proud when he\r\nreceives his naturalization papers like a diploma, awarded before\r\nhis family and friends. Such a ceremonial cannot fail to carry home\r\nthe conviction of the value of the citizenship so conferred, and the\r\nimportance of living up to the responsibility imposed by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The study of citizenship in the public schools may be made a\r\nvigorous aid to Americanization. Many foreign parents depend on their\r\nchildren for their knowledge of the customs of the new country. What\r\nthe children learn in the public schools has its influence on the\r\nlife of the family at home. If the children are taught orderliness,\r\nconsideration for others, and respect for authority, they carry those\r\nqualities home. If they are undisciplined, they take home disregard\r\nfor parental authority, and a lack of consideration for the rights of\r\nothers, that will stand in the way of their comprehending the first\r\nprinciples of good citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nPATRIOTISM AND CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of history there have always been individuals who\r\nhave chosen death rather than slavery. As intelligence has grown and\r\nhas displaced ignorance, their number has increased, but it is only\r\nwithin the last century and a half that people have demanded liberty\r\nin sufficient numbers to make it the fundamental principle in the\r\nforming of great nations.\r\n\r\nWe, in the United States, are the inheritors of the most courageous\r\nand forward thinking of the men and women of all nations who cared\r\nenough for human liberty to break all ties of home and country\r\nin order that they might “establish justice, insure domestic\r\ntranquillity, provide for the common defense, and secure the\r\nblessings of liberty” for themselves and for us.\r\n\r\nThese phrases from the Constitution of the United States have\r\nusually been only words to us. We have been safe, our homes have\r\nbeen secure, our loved ones have been protected. Most of us have not\r\npersonally been conscious of any overwhelming injustices, and those\r\nthat we have heard of have been far enough away not to be disturbing.\r\nWe have come and gone as we chose; we have thought and spoken as we\r\npleased; we have worshiped as we would; our property has been safe;\r\nwe have damned the government or any man in any public office without\r\nthought of danger to ourselves; we have feared no man. Why should we\r\nhave talked about liberty or human freedom—it has been secure enough.\r\nSo the call to defend liberty to some has fallen on dull ears,\r\nand the demand for an awakened patriotism in some places has gone\r\nunheeded. As a people, we have forgotten about the long centuries of\r\nfighting for freedom, the tremendous cost that has been paid, and the\r\nblood that has been shed.\r\n\r\nThink what those words, “safety, defense, tranquillity, justice,”\r\nmust have meant throughout the centuries when no man’s life was safe,\r\nwhen not only his welfare, but that of his family, was subject to the\r\nwhim of the government, when he could be thrown into prison without\r\nknowing the reason why, when the honor of his wife or daughter could\r\nbe taken without his being able to protest. Read your history again,\r\nof the middle ages, of England in the seventeenth century, of France\r\nbefore the Revolution, of Germany in the eighteenth century. Then\r\nread of the early struggles in America. It was nature and the Indians\r\nthat man was fighting then. For personal safety he fought to make\r\nwar and raiding unprofitable; he had to meet brute force with brute\r\nforce, to prove his mastery over nature and savagery, and to gain\r\npeace and safety for himself and his home.\r\n\r\nIt is the untold sacrifices of countless men and women that have made\r\nliberty possible. That it shall be maintained, and that the world\r\nshall not be allowed to slip back, is a debt that every man and woman\r\nowes to the past.\r\n\r\nThose who inherit the fruits of this age-long struggle must be ready\r\nto pay their part, for themselves and for the sake of those they\r\nlove, for the sake of those who won it for them, and for those who\r\nshall come after them. The duty which rests on them is as great as\r\nthe duty that was on the men of the Revolution, and on those who won\r\nthe Magna Charta. If they do not, they are weakening the forces of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nFor liberty is not yet complete. There may be as great a struggle\r\nahead of the world as lies in the past. Before the tremendous\r\nupheaval of the war, we took it for granted that the liberties we\r\npossess were common, more or less, in most of the civilized world.\r\nSince then the horrors, the unbelievable human suffering, the\r\nsuspension of all human rights, in the region of the great struggle,\r\nwe have laid to the war, and have not realized that in many parts of\r\ncivilized Europe, before the war, human freedom as we know it did\r\nnot exist, and that the denial of certain rights which we claim as\r\nfundamental, was common.\r\n\r\nAt the foundation of our national existence has been that belief\r\nin the principles of liberty, justice, and opportunity which the\r\nConstitution expresses. The rights given us by the founders of our\r\nnation have been the ideals which other democratic governments have\r\nsought to follow. They have been sufficiently elastic to meet the\r\ngrowth of the world’s belief in democracy, and to provide for all\r\nnew developments in the ideals of human liberty. If these ideals\r\nhave been denied to any of our people, it has been the fault of us\r\nas citizens. The degree in which they are maintained depends on us.\r\nInstead of denying the liberties that we actually enjoy, would we\r\nnot do better to advance them and add to them? In place of tearing\r\ndown the great structure already erected, is it not wiser to help to\r\ncorrect its imperfections and to continue to build on it?\r\n\r\nThere is an intelligent part of the public that desires good\r\ngovernment and will help to maintain our ideals of justice, but they\r\nare in the minority. There is also a part that sees in government\r\nonly their own selfish profit, but they are also a minority. The\r\ngreat mass of people are indifferent until something arouses them.\r\nThey would rather be left alone by bad government than be bothered\r\nby good government. That is the great problem of democracy—to arouse\r\nall the people to a realization of the necessity of their active\r\ninterest in and support of that democracy, to increase their sense\r\nof individual responsibility; and that is the reason for universal\r\nsuffrage—to put yeast into a people and to ferment their dormant\r\ninterest. Democracy is not static. It exists only as it is upheld.\r\n\r\nWe hear about the denials of justice and the failures of democracy\r\nmore than we do about its blessings. Our sense of perspective is\r\noften wrong. We talk about an act of lawlessness in the United\r\nStates, even if it is being prosecuted with energy by the government,\r\nand class it with a deliberate attempt by a government to crush a\r\npeople. We make no distinction between a State with deficient labor\r\nlaws and a country where the laboring classes have no right to make\r\nthemselves heard. We see no difference between a suppression of\r\ndisloyal utterances in time of war and a people that is never allowed\r\nto speak freely, or a censoring of papers in war-time and a press\r\nthat never prints anything but what it is told to print.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to magnify the evils of democracy at home, and to forget\r\nthe magnificent heritage of liberty that belongs to us.\r\n\r\nWhat are the special privileges which we enjoy?\r\n\r\n_First._—_Personal Security_, the right to live our daily lives\r\nwithout fear of personal danger, the right of being secure from\r\nunwarrantable seizure of person. This right has been ours so long\r\nthat we do not know how precious a right it is. It is difficult even\r\nto conjure up in imagination an idea of what it would mean to be in\r\ndaily fear of one’s safety.\r\n\r\n_Second._—_Personal Liberty: Freedom of Thought and Speech._ Life\r\nwould be unthinkable to us without this liberty. To stifle one’s\r\nthought, to be afraid to let a suspicion of it leak out would mean to\r\nmake life unbearable. _Freedom of the Press_ is a right that we enjoy\r\nmore than any other nation. _Freedom of Worship_ has so long been\r\nunquestioned that we forget that it has been little more than a short\r\ncentury since it was established. _Freedom of Assembly_ is a right\r\nwhich we accept without question.\r\n\r\n_The Right of Petition_ was won by a bitter struggle. We can scarcely\r\nimagine that there was ever a time when it was denied.\r\n\r\n_Third._—_Equality before the Law_ is a right that is guaranteed by\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, the right to a fair trial by\r\njury, of habeas corpus, and due process of the law.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._—_Security of Property_ is guaranteed by our Constitution.\r\nPrivate property may not be taken even by the government without a\r\nfair price being paid for it.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._—_Political Rights_ are guaranteed to our people, universal\r\nsuffrage, complete political liberty. This is the most valuable\r\nof all rights, because it is the right that secures all other\r\nrights.[11]\r\n\r\nThese rights are not absolute; they are dependent on public opinion\r\nas well as on the law. They are imperfectly administered. To the\r\nextent that they are denied, we must each one of us accept part\r\nof the blame, because liberty of action is ours. In time of war\r\npublic safety may demand their suspension, and the people may give\r\npermission that this may be done temporarily.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of citizenship brings with it the obligation to defend\r\nthe government of which that citizenship is a part. The right to\r\nvote is a right which might well be dependent on the loyalty of the\r\ncitizen, and on his willingness to defend and maintain his country.\r\n\r\nMen say even to-day that the vote has no value, that they do not care\r\nabout it. Let them live for a time in a country where they would not\r\nbe allowed to vote, where the people are governed by an autocratic\r\npower, and how long before they would be willing to sacrifice\r\nanything, even life itself, for political liberty?\r\n\r\nThe citizen of a democracy has not only the duty to defend his\r\ncountry, but is bound to transmit to future generations something\r\nbetter than he inherited from the past. As it is his part in time of\r\nwar to defend the liberties that he enjoys, so it is his duty in time\r\nof peace to do his best to develop and strengthen liberty and justice.\r\n\r\nThat is a task even more difficult than to fight in time of war. The\r\ndiscouragements, the disappointments, are many.\r\n\r\nWomen are bound to meet these disappointments. The vote for which\r\nthey have worked so hard and so long will not accomplish what they\r\nwish. Often it will seem to accomplish very little. The machinery of\r\ndemocracy is cumbersome and very imperfect. It is often heartbreaking\r\nto try to move it. It does not easily register the popular will.\r\nBut in spite of the imperfections, and the discouragements, and\r\nthe downright corruption, the foundation on which it is built is\r\nthe best that the world has yet found. There are many labor-saving\r\ndevices still to be invented for the bettering of the machinery\r\nof government—protective measures to be found against political\r\ncorruption and to safeguard the interests of the people.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the improvement in the mechanism of government must\r\ncome a quickening of the public conscience. The yeast of universal\r\nsuffrage is already working toward that end. The golden rule as the\r\nstandard of action in government will make few mistakes. The prospect\r\nfor an improved democracy in New York State is bright. The war has\r\nswept away many prejudices and has clarified many problems. Men and\r\nwomen are working together as never before, whole-heartedly, for\r\nthe benefit of the State. To adapt the words of President Wilson,\r\n“the climax of the culminating and final war for human liberty has\r\ncome, and we must be ready to put our own strength, our own highest\r\npurpose, our own integrity and devotion to the test,” and we must do\r\nthis not only now in time of war, but also after peace has come, in\r\nthe dedication of ourselves to the service of justice, freedom, and\r\nopportunity for all in our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Universal suffrage has meant in the past only manhood suffrage.\r\nWith the ratification of the woman suffrage amendment to the National\r\nConstitution, universal suffrage will become for the first time a\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nSOME DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Habeas Corpus=: Both the Federal and State constitutions guarantee\r\nto the people the right to the writ of habeas corpus, “unless where\r\nin cases of rebellion or invasion, public safety may require its\r\nsuspension.” This is an order that may be obtained from a certain\r\njudge commanding that a prisoner shall be brought into court without\r\ndelay. This writ secures to any person imprisoned for any cause the\r\nright to be heard immediately, in order that the purpose of his\r\ndetention may be made known, the facts be examined, and the prisoner\r\neither released or remanded for trial. This is one of our most highly\r\nprized rights, and is based on a promise contained in the Magna\r\nCharta.\r\n\r\n=The Initiative and Referendum= give to the voters the power to\r\ninitiate legislation, and the right to compel a referendum on any\r\nlegislative act.\r\n\r\n=The Initiative= enables the people to enact some measure that they\r\nmay desire, when it has been ignored, or defeated, or amended out\r\nof shape by the Legislature. The initiative may be used to pass a\r\nnew law, or to amend or repeal existing laws. If a group of citizens\r\ncan get a certain percentage of the voters to sign the requisite\r\npetition to a measure, it then goes to the Legislature, and if it is\r\nnot adopted by that body, the measure must be given to the people for\r\ntheir decision by popular vote. If a majority of the voters indorse\r\nthe measure it becomes a law without waiting for action by the\r\nLegislature. In Oregon, initiative measures go directly to the people\r\nwithout being submitted to the Legislature.\r\n\r\n=The Referendum= provides that a certain percentage of voters may\r\ndemand that any statute passed by the Legislature must be submitted\r\nto the voters, and approved by them before it becomes a law.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a provision for the initiative and referendum\r\nis said to reduce the need of interference with the work of the\r\nLegislature, and the actual number of measures coming to a popular\r\nvote is very small.\r\n\r\n=The Recall= provides that the voters who put an official into office\r\nmay vote to remove him before his term of office is over. If people\r\nare dissatisfied with the conduct of a public official, on petition\r\nof a certain number of voters, he may be compelled to submit to a new\r\nelection so that the voters may pass judgment on his conduct of his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n=The Red-light Injunction and Abatement Act= is recognized as the\r\nmost effective way yet found of minimizing the social evil. The\r\nusual method of handling such offenses is to arrest the woman and\r\nfine her. The injunction and abatement act puts the responsibility on\r\nthe owner of the property used for this business. If it can be proved\r\nthat it is used for immoral purposes, the house is closed, and the\r\nowner fined and put under heavy bond to insure its not being used\r\nagain in this way. Property used for this purpose brings much higher\r\nrent than when used for legitimate business, so that this procedure\r\nstrikes at one root of the evil. New York State has an abatement act,\r\nbut it is not well enforced. It is not easy in many cases to find the\r\nowner of a piece of property.\r\n\r\n=The Tin Plate Ordinance= puts the name of the owner of a building\r\non a plate outside the building, and thus prevents the concealment\r\nof his or her identity. It was first put into operation in Portland,\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\n=Prohibition=, =High License=, =Local Option=, and the =Guttenburg\r\nSystem= are all ways of dealing with the liquor traffic.\r\n\r\n=Prohibition= has been of many different degrees in various places in\r\nthe United States. A complete National prohibition measure has now\r\nbeen passed by Congress, and is before the States for ratification.\r\n\r\n=High License= is intended to decrease the number of places where\r\nliquor is sold by placing a tax on them so large that it will be\r\nimpossible for many of them to pay it.\r\n\r\n=Local Option=, which allows communities of various sizes to decide\r\nfor themselves whether the sale of liquor shall be licensed or not,\r\nhas been fought step by step by the liquor trade.\r\n\r\n=The Scandinavian or Guttenburg System= of controlling the liquor\r\nbusiness, in general, provides for eliminating all private profit\r\nfrom the business, but there are many variations of details in\r\ndifferent places in carrying out the system. The Scandinavian idea\r\nis that if the money profit is done away with the business will\r\ntake care of itself. A few licenses are given for short periods to\r\ncompanies formed for manufacturing wines and liquors, and 5 per\r\ncent. interest is allowed on the capital invested. All remaining\r\nprofits go to the State. The government has the right to withdraw the\r\nlicense without compensation. Retail shops are open only from eight\r\nin the morning until seven-thirty in the evening; they are closed\r\non holidays, and from one on Saturday until eight A.M. on Monday.\r\nBartenders are under the civil service and are given bonuses for\r\nselling soft drinks.\r\n\r\n=The Single Tax= is a proposal to place the entire burden of taxation\r\non land alone, without regard for the value of its improvements.\r\nLand which is not improved, and is entirely non-productive, often\r\nincreases in value with the growth of population and the improvements\r\nmade on neighboring property, without any effort on the part of the\r\nowner, or any service rendered by him in return. Improvements on\r\nproperty increase the taxes on that property, while the owner of\r\nthe unimproved property escapes the same increase as long as his\r\nland remains unimproved. In other words, the improvements which add\r\nto public prosperity are made to pay an increase which the stagnant\r\nproperty escapes. The proposal of the single-taxers is that the\r\n“unearned increment” on such land should go into the public treasury.\r\n\r\n=The House of Governors= originated when President Roosevelt, in\r\n1908, invited the Governors of all the States to meet in Washington\r\nto confer over important matters. Several times since then this\r\n“House of Governors” has met together to discuss questions of mutual\r\ninterest which are important to the welfare of the several States.\r\n\r\n=Proportional Representation= would give representation in Congress\r\nto each party, in proportion to its membership in the State. At\r\npresent the representation of each party is based on its comparative\r\nstrength in each congressional district. The division of the State\r\ninto congressional districts is made by the State Legislature. The\r\npolitical party in control of the Legislature may divide the State\r\nin such a way that it may be able to elect an unfair number of\r\nrepresentatives. It may put counties, or assembly districts which\r\nhave a large majority of voters belonging to the opposite party, in\r\none congressional district, and economize its own voting strength\r\nby spreading it over as many congressional districts as possible,\r\nwhere it can be sure of electing its candidates by small majorities.\r\nThis is known as “gerrymandering.” In New York State, instead of the\r\ndivision of the State into congressional districts being based fairly\r\non population, districts have been created by the party in control\r\nof the Legislature which contain more than twice as many voters as\r\nsome other districts.[12] It is said that proportional representation\r\nwould also tend to make Congressmen so elected work for the service\r\nof the State as a whole instead of for one local district.\r\n\r\n=Workmen’s Compensation Laws= are designed to provide for the\r\ncompensation of employees when they are injured at their work. More\r\nworking-men are injured in the industries of the United States, in\r\nproportion to the number employed, than in any other country in the\r\nworld. To let the working-man and his family alone bear the burden of\r\ninjury or death is recognized as an injustice. For such an injured\r\nperson, or his family, to be obliged to sue through the courts is\r\nusually a long and expensive process.

Compensation laws require employers, regardless of\r\nfault, to pay injured workmen certain amounts for injuries resulting\r\nfrom accidents, without the workmen being obliged to go to court and\r\nsue for damages.\r\n\r\nThe State Federation of Labor is working to have all compensation\r\ninsurance placed in the State fund, to eliminate direct settlement\r\nof damages between the workers and the employer, and to have all\r\noccupational diseases included in the provision of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES\r\n\r\n  Page 109: School taxes under the new Township law are collected by\r\n  Town authorities.\r\n\r\n  Page 142: In New York County the Grand Jury is composed of\r\n  thirty-six men.\r\n\r\n  Page 144: A bill to make women eligible for jury service is before\r\n  the Legislature of New York State.\r\n\r\n  Page 163: Efforts are being made to repeal the Township school law\r\n  and to go back to the School District system of 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Also under our present system a large minority of voters may\r\nbe without representation.
