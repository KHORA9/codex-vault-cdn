Sanford, M.A.\r\nProfessor of History, State Normal School, La Crosse, Wisconsin\r\n\r\n1903, 1913\r\nCharles Scribner's Sons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject matter herewith presented partially represents the plan\r\npursued by the authors as teachers of civil government for a number of\r\nyears in high school, academy, and normal school. It has been found that\r\na study of the methods by which the affairs of government are conducted\r\ngives constant interest to the work, and, consequently, the practical\r\nside of government has been emphasized. But while our desire has been to\r\nbring the actual working of the institutions under which the student\r\nlives into prominence, we have also attempted to give such accounts of\r\nthe origin and early development of forms of government as will assist\r\nin explaining their process of growth. The plan of discussion is similar\r\nto that followed in \"Government in State and Nation.\" The general favor\r\nwith which that text has been received leads to the belief that it fully\r\nmeets the requirement of the Committee of Five for such schools as\r\npresent civil government in the third or fourth year of the course. In\r\nmany cases, however, the subject is taught earlier in the course, and\r\nthe present work has been prepared in answer to the requests of teachers\r\nfor a text suitable to this class of students.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement is such that either Local (Part I), National (Part II),\r\nor State Government (Part III) may be studied first. In the work on\r\nlocal and State government it is not expected that the student will\r\n_learn_ all of the different practices found in the various States, but\r\nthat he will compare them with those of his own State.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the discussions and many of the suggestive questions are\r\nintended to make students realize more completely their duties as\r\ncitizens, many more having a local bearing will occur to teachers. It is\r\nscarcely to be hoped that all of the books and magazines mentioned will\r\nbe found in any high school library, but the need for supplementary\r\nreading is being met through the rapid increase of public libraries. A\r\nworking-library on the subject of civics may be accumulated in a short\r\ntime if only a few of the books given in Appendix D are procured each\r\nyear. No attempt has been made to give references to all of the material\r\nwhich has appeared within the past few years.\r\n\r\nThe ability of the reader and the time to be devoted to the subject have\r\nbeen kept constantly in mind. There may be more supplementary questions\r\nand references than can be used by any one class. Should it happen, on\r\nthe other hand, that more work of this character is desired, the need\r\nmay be met by reference to similar questions in \"Government in State and\r\nNation.\"\r\n\r\nIn preparing this new edition, we take the opportunity of acknowledging\r\nthe assistance given by many teachers of civics, strangers to us, who\r\nare using \"Government in State and Nation,\" and others who are using\r\n\"Our Government,\" for their helpful suggestions.\r\n\r\nEVANSTON, ILLINOIS,\r\nJuly 1, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n   I.

We think of this function\r\nmost frequently as exercised in the arrest of offenders who violate the\r\nlaw. In fact, most young persons receive their earliest ideas of\r\ngovernment by seeing the policeman, or constable, who stands for the\r\nauthority of the government. But he is not the only officer who is\r\nconcerned in preserving order. The police officer who makes an arrest\r\ncannot punish his prisoner, but must merely hold him until it is decided\r\nthat he deserves punishment. This is the work of a court, with its\r\njustice, or judge, and the jury. If the prisoner is declared guilty,\r\nthen the police officer executes the orders of the court by collecting a\r\nfine or by imprisoning him. We have here illustrated two divisions of\r\ngovernmental authority: (1) the _judicial_, which decides whether the\r\nlaw applies in particular cases; and (2) the _executive_, which carries\r\nout the requirements of the law and the orders of the court.\r\n\r\nLaw-Making.--The executive and the judicial officers are both\r\nsubject to higher authority: the one applies and the other executes _the\r\nlaw_. The framing of the law is the third function of government. This\r\nwork is called _legislation_, and is carried on by such bodies as the\r\ntown board, the village board, and the city council. But these\r\nlaw-making bodies do not have independent authority; they are bound more\r\nor less strictly by the opinions of those who elected them to office;\r\ni.e., the body of voters.\r\n\r\nThe Three Divisions of Government.--We say, then, that in our\r\ncountry government is based finally upon _the will of the people_. For\r\nthe expression of their will they choose numerous officers, who may be\r\ngrouped under three heads, corresponding to the general divisions of\r\ngovernment: legislative, executive, and judicial.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Just as it would be impossible for all the voters to take part in\r\n     applying or interpreting the law, so it is in most cases impossible\r\n     for them to assemble in a body and make the laws. They generally\r\n     delegate this work to legislators; but in some States the voters of\r\n     a town (or township) assemble yearly in town meeting, where all may\r\n     take part in discussion and in voting.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoads and Streets.--The preservation of order is but one of the\r\nfunctions of government. In towns where the population is scattered,\r\nroads must be built, and it is still more necessary that in villages and\r\ncities, where many people live within a small area, streets should be\r\ngraded and paved and sidewalks maintained. This is an illustration of\r\nthe way in which, through the machinery of government, people provide\r\nthemselves with many conveniences that it would be impossible for each\r\ncitizen to provide for himself. The legislative bodies already mentioned\r\ndetermine the extent to which these things shall be done: the town board\r\norders the laying out of a new road; the village board or the city\r\ncouncil passes ordinances saying what streets shall be paved and what\r\nmaterials shall be used in the work.\r\n\r\nExecutive Officers, General and Special.--The actual execution of\r\nthe work involved in public improvements is generally in charge of a\r\nspecial officer, such as the road or street commissioner. But since\r\nthere are many other matters of public concern that require attention,\r\neach under the control of an executive officer, it is necessary that a\r\ngeneral officer should be in authority over all of these as the _chief\r\nexecutive_ of the local government. This officer is known by various\r\ntitles, as, in the town, the _chairman_, in the village, the\r\n_president_, and in the city, the _mayor_. In any case, he has all or\r\nmost of the important executive work of government under his control. It\r\nis his duty to see that the laws are obeyed, so the police officers are\r\nsubject to his orders. The chief executive is guardian of the people's\r\ninterests; for he must see that the minor officers do not injure the\r\npublic welfare by neglect of duty, and he must defend the public from\r\nall persons who would encroach upon its rights.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider some of the other ordinary functions of local\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Poor.--Poor relief may be mentioned first. How much aid shall\r\nbe granted to paupers, and how shall it be distributed, are questions\r\nthat everywhere require attention.\r\n\r\nPublic Health.--Public health is also an important subject upon\r\nwhich local laws must been enacted. In cities, particularly, the council\r\npasses strict regulations for preventing diseases and for checking the\r\nspread of such as are contagious. City ordinances are also enacted\r\nregulating the construction of sewers and drains. The health\r\ncommissioner and the city physicians are the particular officers who\r\ndirect the execution of laws upon these subjects.\r\n\r\nEducation.--Public education is among the most important of the\r\nlocal government's functions. The free schools which exist everywhere in\r\nour country are supported and controlled chiefly by the towns, villages,\r\nand cities. In many States, however, there are other divisions, called\r\nschool districts, which have boards and officers for this purpose.\r\n\r\nOther Necessary Functions.--Protection from fire is so important in\r\ncommunities where population is dense that special officers and\r\napparatus must be provided. So, too, streets must be lighted, and a pure\r\nwater-supply provided.\r\n\r\nParks, Museums, and Libraries.--Besides the functions of government\r\nthat are readily seen to be necessary, there are others which may not at\r\nfirst appear to be so. We have cities providing parks, with beautiful\r\nlawns and flower-gardens; museums, where articles of historical and\r\nscientific interest are kept; aquariums and zoological gardens;\r\nlibraries, with books, magazines, and papers for the free use of all\r\ncitizens. If one looks closely, he will see a reason in each case why\r\nthe government undertakes these various enterprises.\r\n\r\nWhy Taxes Are Levied.--We have now to consider a power of\r\ngovernment, without which none of the others so far named could be\r\nexercised. This is the taxing power. In every case money must be used by\r\nlocal governments in exercising their functions. Officers, who are\r\nagents of the people, depend largely upon taxes for their salaries.\r\nTaxes are levied by the legislative bodies that we have found in towns,\r\nvillages, and cities. Other officers, _assessors_ and _treasurers_,\r\ndetermine the amount to be paid by each citizen and collect the taxes.\r\nThe treasurer also has charge of public money, and pays it out when\r\nordered to do so by the proper authorities.\r\n\r\nAll of the operations of government are matters of record. While each\r\nofficer is expected to keep strict account of the operations of his own\r\ndepartment, the general records of towns, villages, and cities are kept\r\nby the _clerks_.\r\n\r\nThis general view of local governments may now be summarized in two\r\nforms:--\r\n\r\nI. THE FUNCTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n1. _Protection_:--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preservation of order.\r\nProtection against fire.\r\nProtection of public health.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Providing Necessities and Conveniences_:--\r\n\r\n\r\nRoads--Streets--Sidewalks.\r\nWater--Lights--Sewers.\r\nPoor relief--Education.\r\nParks--Libraries--Museums.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. OFFICERS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWN.                  VILLAGE.                 CITY.\r\n\r\nBoard                  Board                    Council\r\nChairman               President                Mayor\r\nClerk                  Clerk                    Clerk\r\nTreasurer              Treasurer                Treasurer\r\nAssessors              Assessors                Assessors\r\nConstables             Constables               Police\r\nRoad Commissioner      Street Commissioner      Street Commissioner\r\nJustices               Justices                 Justices\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The list here given is not complete, and the official\r\ntitles are not the same in all States.]\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nMake a study of your local (town, village, or city) government.\r\n\r\n1. Group the officers as legislative, executive, and judicial,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n2. How many different methods are used in paying these officers?\r\n\r\n3. Do all the voters ever assemble to make laws? If not, how is the will\r\nof the majority expressed?\r\n\r\n4. What are some of the local regulations regarding the poor?[2] public\r\nhealth? protection from fire?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For a general account under this topic, see James and\r\nSanford, \"Government in State and Nation,\" Chapter VIII. Health\r\nregulations are discussed in the same work, pp. 70-72.]\r\n\r\n5. Who pays for the education that young people receive in the public\r\nschools?\r\n\r\n6. How much has your local government done toward furnishing things that\r\nare not merely conveniences? How do you justify expenditures for these\r\npurposes?\r\n\r\n7. Does the management of local government excite as much interest among\r\nthe citizens as it should?\r\n\r\n8. In what ways are students directly interested in having efficient\r\nlocal governments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nWhy There Are Counties.--If the local organizations discussed in\r\nChapter I could attend to all the interests that citizens have in\r\ncommon, then government would be a much simpler matter than it is. But\r\njust as almost every citizen has business and social relations outside\r\nof the neighborhood in which he lives, so different communities must\r\nhave political relations with each other if they are to live in harmony.\r\n(For this and other reasons, which we shall learn presently, county\r\ngovernments are established. Their organization and functions correspond\r\nquite closely to those of the towns, villages, and smaller cities.)\r\n\r\nImportant County Officers.--The local governments cannot undertake\r\nalone the preservation of order or the protection of citizens against\r\ncriminals. We have, consequently, an important officer, the _sheriff_,\r\nwho with his deputies has power to make arrests. There is also the\r\njudicial side of county governments, seen in the _court_, with its\r\njudge. In this court another county officer, called the _district_ or\r\n_State's attorney_, prosecutes persons who are accused of crime; i.e.,\r\nhe finds evidence of the prisoner's guilt and causes this evidence to be\r\ngiven by witnesses at the trial.\r\n\r\nFunctions of County Government.--Public highways are also matters\r\nof more than local interest. When an expensive bridge is to be built, or\r\nan important road in which several communities are interested is to be\r\nconstructed, the county government can best raise the money and manage\r\nthe work. So, too, in caring for the poor, the county may aid the local\r\ngovernments, or it may take entire charge of the paupers, and maintain a\r\npoorhouse.\r\n\r\nThe County Board.--It is evident that there must be a legislative\r\nbody which shall determine the policy of the county in these matters.\r\nThis is the _county board_, or as it is called in some States, the\r\n_county court_. In most States this body is composed of _commissioners_.\r\nThese are elected by either of two methods: (1) at large, when every\r\nvoter may vote for the entire number of commissioners; (2) they may be\r\nelected from districts into which the county has been divided. In some\r\nStates the members of the county board are called _supervisors_, and\r\nthey represent the towns, villages, and wards of cities. Under this\r\nsystem the county board is generally larger than under the commissioner\r\nsystem. There is another difference between the two systems: in the\r\nStates that have county commissioners, the county government has a\r\nlarger number of functions than in the other States. That is, the county\r\ngovernment has almost entire control of such matters as roads and poor\r\nrelief, leaving the local governments with little authority in these\r\ndirections. On the other hand, where the supervisor system exists, the\r\ntowns and villages have chief authority in legislating upon these\r\nmatters, and the county assists or takes only such part as it finds\r\nnecessary for the general good.\r\n\r\nPower of the Board.--The county board holds annual meetings and\r\nmakes laws for the county as a whole. It has charge of the county\r\nproperty, including the court-house, jail, and poorhouse. Since it must\r\nprovide for the expense of maintaining these buildings, for the salaries\r\nof county officers, and for other expenses connected with roads, poor,\r\nand other county business, the board must also have the power of levying\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Schools.--Education is another function of\r\ngovernment which is not managed solely by the local units. There is a\r\ncounty officer, called the _superintendent of schools_, who has\r\nsupervisory powers, and he usually examines teachers and certifies to\r\ntheir qualifications.\r\n\r\nRegister of Deeds.--The _register of deeds_, or _recorder_, is a\r\ncounty officer who keeps records of certain kinds. Among other things,\r\ncopies of deeds are registered or kept in his office. A person wishing\r\nto buy real estate (i.e., houses or lands) may, by consulting the\r\nrecords in this office, learn whether the owner has a clear title to the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nCoroner.--The _coroner_ has the duty of holding inquests when\r\npersons meet death by violence or in some unexplained way. He may also\r\nperform the duties of the sheriff when the latter cannot perform them.\r\n\r\nSurveyor.--The county _surveyor_ makes surveys at the request of\r\npublic authorities, as well as for individuals. He keeps the official\r\nrecords of the boundaries of farms and lots.\r\n\r\nClerk and Treasurer.--Of course the county must have its _clerk_\r\nand _treasurer_, the officers whose duties are to keep the records and\r\nto handle county moneys.\r\n\r\nWe may now pass in review the principal features of county government:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI. LEGISLATIVE.\r\n\r\n1. _County Boards_:--\r\n\r\n  Commissioner type\r\n  Supervisor type\r\n\r\n2. _Functions_:--\r\n\r\n  County buildings\r\n  Poor--Education\r\n  Roads and bridges\r\n  Taxation\r\n\r\nII. EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n  Sheriff and Deputies\r\n  Clerk\r\n  Treasurer\r\n  Register of Deeds, or Recorder\r\n  Attorney\r\n  Superintendent of Schools\r\n  Coroner\r\n  Surveyor\r\n\r\n\r\n(In some States, Assessors and Collectors of Taxes, and Auditors.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. JUDICIARY.\r\n\r\n  County Court\r\n  District Court\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations of Local Officers to State Law.--There are other reasons\r\nthan those already given why States are divided into counties. One is\r\nbecause, in the performance of their duties, the county officers act as\r\nagents for the State; that is, they carry out the State law in their own\r\nlocalities. For instance, criminals are brought to trial and punished\r\nunder State law, but it is administered by local or county officials. So\r\nthe surveyor, superintendent of schools, register of deeds, and other\r\nofficers act under State laws. While it seems best to have one general\r\nlaw for the State upon important subjects, it is also the policy of our\r\ngovernment to intrust the execution of the law, in most cases, to local\r\nrather than to State officials. These officers, being elected by the\r\npeople of the various localities, feel their responsibility more keenly\r\nthan if they obtained office by appointment from State authorities.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said concerning the relation of the county to the State\r\ngovernment is true to a considerable extent concerning the town,\r\nvillage, and city governments. Here, too, elections are held, taxes are\r\ncollected, and trials are conducted by local officers in accordance with\r\nState law. Indeed, it is true that these local divisions owe their\r\nexistence to State law. Towns are laid out, villages and cities are\r\nincorporated, in accordance with the provisions of laws enacted by State\r\nlegislatures. The State is the source of all the authority exercised by\r\nthe officers and governing bodies of these local governments.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nMake a study of your county government.\r\n\r\n1.

We shall now see how local government grew in the colonies, for\r\nhere we have the beginnings of the systems that are in operation to-day.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in the colonies the English settlers brought to their new\r\nhomes the ancient customs of the mother-country. Differences in physical\r\ngeography, and in the character and motives of the colonists, caused\r\ndifferences in the resulting local governments. This fact is best\r\nillustrated by an account of what took place in New England and in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Method of Settlement in New England.--These colonies were settled\r\nby emigrants who came, in the main, from the same classes of Englishmen.\r\nThe New Englanders, however, were Puritans. The church and its services\r\nwere a very important part of their daily lives. The requirement of\r\nchurch attendance was one reason for grouping their homes near the\r\nmeeting-house. Moreover, the region in which they settled had a stony\r\nsoil, difficult to cultivate. Their farms required careful cultivation,\r\nand therefore could not be very large. The New Englander was content to\r\nlive near the coast. Means of traveling to the interior were not easy,\r\nfor the rivers, with few exceptions, were short and rapid. The sea\r\nfisheries tempted the settlers to remain near the coast, and fishing,\r\nwith ship-building and commerce, became their important industries.\r\n\r\nTown Meetings and Officers.--For these reasons New England was a\r\nregion of small farms and towns, and the local government which grew up\r\nwas adapted to these conditions. The voters of each town (or township)\r\nmet annually, or oftener, in \"town meeting.\" Here their common local\r\naffairs were discussed and regulated. The church, the schools, roads,\r\nthe poor, and many other matters were under the complete control of this\r\nmeeting, and of the officers elected by the assembled voters. These\r\nofficers were the selectmen,--which was a board having general\r\nsupervision of the town affairs,--the clerk, treasurer, assessors, fence\r\nviewers, constables, and numerous others.\r\n\r\nThe County in New England.--Because the people lived in towns and\r\ncould most easily regulate their affairs through the machinery of town\r\ngovernment, they had no counties whatever at first; but these were soon\r\nestablished, though merely for judicial purposes. The governor appointed\r\njustices who held court in each county.\r\n\r\nThe leading features of New England local government, then, were (1)\r\nits democratic character, seen particularly in the town meeting; and (2)\r\nthe fact that nearly all local affairs were managed by the town\r\ngovernment, leaving but one important function, and that judicial in its\r\nnature, for the county.\r\n\r\nThe Settlement of Virginia.--In the colony of Virginia we find\r\nconditions that bring about entirely different results in the\r\norganization and workings of local government. Here the settlers were\r\nnot bound by religious or other ties into compact social bodies as the\r\nPuritans were. Natural conditions in Virginia made it better for the\r\nsettlers to live apart, so that nearly all their attempts to form cities\r\nand towns failed. The cultivation of tobacco, of course, explains this\r\nto a large extent. The fertile soil and the ease of raising this product\r\nled to the formation of large plantations. The broad rivers made\r\nprogress into the interior remarkably easy; and there seemed little\r\nnecessity for towns as shipping ports, because ocean vessels could stop\r\nat the private wharves of the various plantations. The rich planters\r\nwere most prominent in the social and political life of the colony, and\r\nlocal government fell under their control.\r\n\r\nThe Importance of the County.--Now, of the various local\r\norganizations to which the Virginians had been accustomed in England,\r\nthe one best suited to their condition in the colony was the county. So\r\nthey copied the English county and made it their chief organ of local\r\ngovernment. The principal governing body was the _county court_,\r\ncomposed of justices appointed at first by the governor of the colony.\r\nThe court had both legislative and judicial functions. It managed such\r\nmatters as roads, licenses, and taxation; it also tried civil and\r\ncriminal cases. Other county officers were the sheriff and the\r\nlieutenant, the latter being commander of the militia.\r\n\r\nThe Parish and the Vestry.--That part of the Virginia local\r\ngovernment which corresponded to the New England town was the _parish_;\r\nbut it is apparent that few functions remained to be exercised in this,\r\ntheir smallest political organization. The counties were generally\r\ncomposed of several parishes. The governing body of each was the vestry;\r\nit had charge of church affairs and of poor relief. The members of the\r\nvestry and also the justices of the county court were not elected by the\r\npeople, as the town officers were in New England. On the contrary, both\r\nthe vestry and the county court filled vacancies in their own number,\r\nwithout popular election.\r\n\r\nThis fact serves to illustrate the general truth that local government\r\nwas democratic in New England and aristocratic in Virginia; in the\r\nformer colony the mass of voters took part most actively in local\r\ngovernment, while in the latter a few men constituted the ruling class.\r\nThis does not mean that local affairs in Virginia were badly managed,\r\nfor the leading men were on the whole intelligent and public-spirited;\r\nand in the years of the Revolution they were among the foremost in the\r\ndefense of American liberties. In New England, however, it was\r\nnoticeable that the mass of voters were intelligent and understood the\r\npractical management of political affairs--a result which doubtless\r\ncame largely from their training in the town meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Three Types of Local Organization.--We have now seen that in\r\nNew England the town had the most important functions of local\r\ngovernment, and this is called, therefore, the _town type_; while in\r\nVirginia the county had the greater share of governing powers, and there\r\nwe find the _county type_. Virginia influenced the colonies that lay\r\nsouth of her, so that the county type was found also in the Carolinas\r\nand Georgia. In the middle colonies there existed both counties and\r\ntowns, and here there was a much more equal division of powers between\r\nthese organizations. Hence we call theirs the _mixed_ or\r\n_township-county type_ of local government.\r\n\r\nLocal Government in the West.--The people who migrated to the new\r\nStates west of the Alleghenies carried with them the forms of local\r\ngovernment which have just been described as growing up in the colonies.\r\nThis statement needs some modification, for nowhere in the West was the\r\npure town type adopted. Everywhere in the North we find the mixed type,\r\nwhile the Southern States have, in general, the county type. In the\r\nlatter the county commissioners, elected at large or from precincts,\r\ntogether with other county officers, exercise most of the local powers\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nTwo Forms in the North.--In the greater number of the States that\r\nhave the mixed type, the county is governed by a board of commissioners\r\nelected by either of the methods just mentioned as prevailing in the\r\nSouth. In a few States (such as Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin), the\r\ncounty board is composed of _supervisors_, who represent the towns,\r\nvillages, and wards of the county. Here we find the town meeting, copied\r\nafter that of New England or New York, and the town government has more\r\nfunctions than in those States where commissioners compose the town\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nLocal Self-Government.--Such is the way in which local government\r\nhas come about in the various States of the Union. Rooted in the systems\r\nthat Englishmen have developed through the centuries, adapted to the new\r\nlife and the peculiar conditions of the colonial period, it has spread\r\nwith the population throughout the land. The management of local affairs\r\nby the people and their chosen representatives is a sound principle of\r\ngovernment which holds a firm place in every part of our country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1. Which type of local government exists in your State? Can you account\r\nfor its origin?\r\n\r\n2. Is the system of local government uniform throughout your State? If\r\nso, why is this true? If not, can you account for the lack of\r\nuniformity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF CITIES.\r\n\r\nThe General Plan of City Government.--The general framework of city\r\ngovernment is not very different from that of the other governmental\r\ndivisions. There are the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\ndepartments, whose organization and functions are stated in the\r\n_charter_, or fundamental law of the city. The city legislature is the\r\n_council_ or _board of aldermen_. In most cases this body is a single\r\nhouse, though in some cities there are two houses. The members are\r\nelected from the wards into which the city is divided. The council may\r\npass ordinances for the government of the city, but it is limited in the\r\nextent of its powers by the terms of the city charter.\r\n\r\nCity Charters Granted by Legislatures.--The source of the charter\r\nis the State legislature. In most States the constitution provides that\r\nthe legislature shall pass _general laws_ prescribing the framework of\r\nall cities, or of the classes into which the cities of a State may be\r\ndivided, according to their population. These laws also contain\r\nregulations that are safeguards against the abuses of municipal\r\ngovernment, such as heavy taxation and the accumulation of debts. The\r\nrequirement of general laws secures uniformity in the most important\r\nfeatures of city government, and it prevents the practice, which is\r\notherwise liable to prevail, of constant interference by State\r\nlegislatures in the affairs of certain cities. Such _special laws_\r\nshould be enacted with great caution, if at all; for when a legislature\r\nregulates the affairs of a particular city, it too often does so at the\r\nrequest of persons or corporations having advantages to gain at the\r\nexpense of the public.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In some States where the constitutions require general laws\r\napplying to classes of cities, single cities have been put in classes by\r\nthemselves; so the legislature has virtually governed them by special\r\nlaws.]\r\n\r\nThe Mayor.--The chief executive of the city is the mayor. He is the\r\nhead of the police department and has more or less authority over the\r\nother administrative departments to be discussed later in this chapter.\r\nIn the cases of both mayor and aldermen, the facts concerning their\r\nterms, salaries, and other details vary so greatly in different cities\r\nthat no general description is possible.\r\n\r\nThe city judiciary includes the ordinary State courts and also special\r\nor municipal courts of various degrees.\r\n\r\nOther City Officials.--Besides the officers enumerated, every city\r\nhas its clerk, treasurer, attorney, and assessors. The auditor, or\r\ncomptroller, is an important official who controls city finances.\r\n\r\nAdministrative Departments.--The greatest difficulties of city\r\ngovernment arise in connection with the numerous administrative\r\ndepartments; these are quite complex in their operation. In large cities\r\nthe number of officials and the variety of their duties render it almost\r\nimpossible for the average citizen to become informed concerning these\r\naffairs; consequently, opportunities for fraud and mismanagement occur\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, is such complex machinery necessary in municipal\r\ngovernment? It is because social and industrial conditions (that is, the\r\ncircumstances under which men live and work) are quite different from\r\nthose that we find in towns and villages; and city government must be\r\nadapted to these conditions.\r\n\r\nConditions Peculiar to City Life.--Let us notice some of the ways\r\nin which this is true. (1) The mere fact that population is dense\r\nincreases the possibility that a citizen may interfere with the rights\r\nof his neighbors even in the conduct of ordinary business. (2) There is\r\ngreater liability that public health and safety may be endangered, both\r\nin the homes and in the shops and factories of cities, than in less\r\ndensely settled communities. (3) The opportunities for evil-doing and\r\nfor concealment that exist in cities draw to them a larger proportion of\r\nthe vicious classes who need control and suppression. (4) Finally, in\r\ncities it is less easy than in the country for each family to supply\r\nitself with certain conveniences, such as water, light, and\r\ntransportation; consequently, the government must regulate to some\r\nextent the supply of these necessities.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the conditions that are peculiar to city life; and we\r\nfind here the reasons why the government in a city must undertake a\r\nlarge number of functions. At every point the safety of the citizen and\r\nhis property must be guarded; and in a great many ways the conveniences\r\nof life must be supplied by the city or under the control of city\r\nofficials. Thus we account for the fact that city government is\r\ncomplex--the principal source of the difficulties and the evils that we\r\nfind in connection with administrative departments.\r\n\r\nFire and Police Departments.--The number and the organization of\r\nadministrative departments vary considerably in different cities.\r\nEverywhere we find the police, fire, and health departments. Fire\r\ndepartments are, as a rule, very efficient; for the citizens will not\r\nallow laxness in the protection of their property. The efficiency of\r\npolice departments varies greatly in different cities. When the\r\nselection of police officers is on a political basis, the standards are\r\napt to be low, and the police may then protect or even assist violators\r\nof the law. Instances have been known where policemen received,\r\nregularly, money payments from law-breakers whom they did not arrest.\r\nThe detection of this form of corruption is difficult; nevertheless, if\r\nit continues, the people are evidently not awake to their own best\r\ninterests. In other cities, on the other hand, the police force is\r\nmaintained upon a high standard. Sometimes civil-service-reform methods\r\nare used in the selection of policemen; the passing of an examination is\r\nnecessary for appointment. This, with a fair system of promotions,\r\nshould render a police force more like a military organization in its\r\nrelation to the enforcement of law.\r\n\r\nThe Health Department.--The department of public health has duties\r\nthat are of vital importance. Sewerage systems, sanitation, and the\r\nwater-supply are the chief objects of its inspection. Health officers\r\nalso have powers which enable them to detect and prohibit the sale of\r\nimpure foods. The milk-supply should receive its particular attention,\r\nfor the purity of this product is an important matter. The enforcement\r\nof strict health regulations in the crowded tenement districts of large\r\ncities is very difficult; but the neglect of these matters by city\r\nofficials is nothing less than criminal.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Streets.--This department, which has in charge\r\nthe construction of streets and pavements, affects the convenience of\r\nevery citizen. Here vast sums of money are expended, sometimes wisely,\r\nand sometimes under the supervision of officials who are lacking in the\r\ntechnical knowledge required by this kind of work. Opportunity for\r\ndishonest handling of public money may be found in the letting of\r\ncontracts and in the purchase of supplies. Street-cleaning has received\r\ncomparatively little attention in American cities. In this respect we\r\nare far behind many European cities. This is because the relation of\r\nclean streets to public health, and to civic beauty, is not fully\r\nappreciated by the average citizen of our country.\r\n\r\nPublic Charities.--The administration of public charities is\r\neverywhere a difficult matter, and, naturally, its difficulty is\r\ngreatest in large cities, where we find the greatest number of those who\r\nseek relief. Two problems confront the department of public charities:\r\n(1) How can it distinguish between those who actually need assistance\r\nand those who do not? (2)How can it help those who need assistance\r\ntemporarily, without weakening their desire to become self-supporting?\r\nThe same problems must be solved by the citizen in connection with his\r\nprivate charities. In general, it may be said that charitable work is\r\nbest managed by private organizations, in charge of trained workers, who\r\ncan investigate all cases of application for aid.\r\n\r\nThe Public Schools.--Public education is another department of\r\nmunicipal activity.[4] City governments spend great amounts of public\r\nmoney for this purpose. The work of our educational institutions is\r\nconstantly being enlarged; courses in commerce, manual training, and\r\ndomestic science are intended to strengthen the practical side of\r\neducation. In some cities special schools are maintained for the\r\ndefective classes and for truants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This subject is also treated in the chapter on Public\r\nSchool Systems.]\r\n\r\nLibraries, Parks, and Playgrounds.--The educational advantages\r\nfurnished by the city are not for the children alone. Public libraries\r\nand museums serve adults as well. Recreation is provided by means of\r\nparks, public playgrounds, and open-air gymnasiums. These will become\r\nmore common when their educational influence is more fully understood.\r\n\r\nCommittees or Boards.--The important questions that arise in\r\nconnection with administrative departments are, how shall they be\r\norganized? and how shall the officers who control them be appointed? Two\r\ngeneral methods prevail: (1)In the smaller cities the members of the\r\ncouncil are grouped into _committees_, which have charge of the various\r\nadministrative departments. In large cities there are _boards_ or\r\n_commissioners_, distinct from the council, and these may be composed of\r\nsalaried officers. In either case the board may employ a superintendent\r\nto take charge of the work under its jurisdiction. The principal\r\ncriticism which can be offered against this method of managing\r\nadministrative departments is that responsibility cannot be definitely\r\nlocated. No single member of a board or commission will assume\r\nresponsibility for mismanagement; and when responsibility is divided\r\namong several persons, none of them feels it very strongly.\r\n\r\n(2)Single Heads of Departments.--As a remedy for this defect,\r\nadministrative departments in some cities are placed under the control\r\nof _single officers_. These are given authority to appoint their\r\nsubordinates, and they are held strictly accountable for the management\r\nof the department. Responsibility is further concentrated in some cities\r\nby giving the mayor power to appoint these heads of departments.\r\n\r\nThe Commission Form of City Government.--This form is found in a\r\nnumber of cities throughout the country. In place of the mayor and\r\ncouncil these cities have a small body of men (generally three or five)\r\nwho both make and execute city ordinances. They are elected at large\r\nfrom the city. Each of the commissioners is in charge of one or more of\r\nthe city departments, and all subordinate officers are appointed by\r\nthem. The commissioners are expected to devote their entire time to\r\ntheir duties and they are paid liberal salaries. Thus, it is hoped, city\r\ngovernment will become more business-like and efficient.\r\n\r\nIn most cities that have the commission form provision is made for the\r\n_initiative, referendum_, and _recall_. The initiative enables a body of\r\ncitizens who sign a petition to obtain a certain law by popular vote, if\r\nthe commission refuses to pass it. The referendum enables citizens to\r\nvote for or against a law that the commission has passed, and thus to\r\nrepeal it if they desire. Under the recall a member of the commission\r\ncan be made to stand for re-election, or else to resign, at any time\r\nduring his term of office, if a certain number of citizens petition for\r\nthis action.\r\n\r\nQualifications of City Officers.--Grave questions are involved in\r\nthese matters of organization, but the efficiency of city government\r\ndepends in the greatest measure upon the character of the officers who\r\nare placed in power. We need to recognize the importance, in city\r\naffairs as in private business, of securing officials who are qualified\r\nby training and by successful experience to serve the public. Economy\r\nand honesty in municipal government cannot be expected when politics\r\nalone determines appointments to office. The establishment of\r\ncivil-service-examination systems in certain cities is a step in the\r\nright direction.\r\n\r\nPublic Utilities.--Besides the administrative departments already\r\nmentioned, we have in large cities those which control the supply of\r\nwater, light, and transportation facilities. The industries furnishing\r\nthese necessities may belong to the city, but in most cases they are\r\nowned by individuals and corporations.[5] Even then they should be\r\nsubject to strict regulation by the city, for several reasons: (1) These\r\nindustries make use of public streets. The right to do this is granted\r\nby the council in a _franchise_. (2) The product that is supplied being\r\nin each case a necessity, it is the duty of the city government to\r\nprotect the citizens from any abuse or inconvenience that may arise in\r\nconnection with it. (3) In nearly every case the industries in question\r\nare monopolies; i.e., competition between rival plants is not\r\npossible. For this reason the public may suffer either from high rates\r\nor from imperfect service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: On this topic see \"Government in State and Nation,\" pp.\r\n33-36.]\r\n\r\nThe Question of Municipal Ownership.--The opinion is gaining ground\r\nthat no amount of municipal control will cure the evils of private\r\nownership in these industries. Since they are \"natural monopolies,\" it\r\nis argued they should be operated by the city government. This opinion\r\nis seen to have great weight when we consider the corruption and the\r\nlack of attention to the public welfare that accompany the granting of\r\nfranchises to corporations. The bribery of aldermen and the granting of\r\nvaluable privileges without compensation are frequent occurrences. On\r\nthe other hand, the facts that bad officers are sometimes elected in our\r\ncities, and that they ignore public interests, raise a very serious\r\nquestion whether they should be intrusted with the management of great\r\nindustries, such as water and lighting plants and street-car systems.\r\n\r\nReasons for Poor City Government.--Other arguments may be made on\r\nboth sides of this question of municipal ownership; but there are\r\nfundamental reasons why the cities of the United States are, on the\r\nwhole, poorly governed, which must receive consideration before this\r\nquestion can be settled. The conditions accounting for the evils of\r\nmunicipal government may be briefly stated as follows: (1) City\r\ngovernments are necessarily complex, and, in their administrative\r\ndepartments especially, a multitude of details must receive attention.\r\nCitizens find it difficult to understand these transactions and even\r\nmore difficult to follow them closely. (2) City governments must spend\r\nvast sums of money, and this fact is a standing temptation to dishonest\r\nmen both in and out of office. (3) The rapidity with which cities have\r\ngrown has increased the difficulty of their problems. (4) Individuals\r\nand corporations have found it necessary to secure franchises from\r\ncities for the operation of important industries; this has opened many\r\nopportunities for corruption in city affairs. (5) The presence of large\r\nnumbers of foreigners who are ignorant of governmental affairs has\r\nenabled corrupt politicians to exert great influence upon the voters in\r\ncity elections.\r\n\r\nThe Reform of Municipal Governments.--Having reviewed the principal\r\ncauses for the evils of municipal government, let us now consider some\r\nof the conditions that are necessary for bringing about reforms.\r\n\r\n(1) National politics should be entirely separated from city affairs. It\r\nmay be impossible to prevent the nomination of candidates by the regular\r\npolitical parties; but within each party local issues, not national,\r\nshould determine the selection of candidates. At the polls the voter\r\nshould cast his ballot independently of party considerations.\r\n\r\n(2) Public interest in municipal affairs and the existence of a strong\r\ncivic pride are conditions that are essential to the election of good\r\nofficers and to the purity of city government.\r\n\r\n(3) Before we can have better city governments every citizen must\r\nrecognize his _responsibility_, not only on election day, but on every\r\noccasion when he can help in the work of detecting wrong, punishing\r\ncorrupt officials, and encouraging better things in all departments of\r\ncity life. This means unselfishness in one's attitude toward the public\r\nwelfare; it means willingness to sacrifice time and effort in the public\r\nservice. The example set by many eminent persons who have devoted\r\nthemselves unselfishly to the accomplishment of reforms in our great\r\ncities may well be imitated by every citizen in the smaller affairs of\r\nhis city or his ward. And the younger generation of citizens, who are\r\nyet students in the public schools, may exert no little influence toward\r\nthe betterment of the city; and they may aid in the formation of that\r\nbetter public sentiment without which no improvement in our standards of\r\nmunicipal government is possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nOutline for the study of your city government.\r\n\r\n1.

How was it\r\nfinally accomplished? These are always questions of great interest to\r\nthe student of American government. We note the general indifference\r\ntoward union among the colonies before the Revolutionary War. This may\r\nbe partially accounted for by the fact that each colony had its own\r\nseparate government, and was jealous of all outside interference. Lack\r\nof good roads and methods of travel made extensive communication between\r\nthe scattered settlements difficult. Prejudice against strangers, and\r\nespecially those of a different religious belief, was common. Bonds of\r\nsympathy, however, between the citizens of different colonies were not\r\nwholly lacking. Their language and customs were mainly English. Their\r\nchief desire was to develop a government according to their own plans.\r\nCommon interests were at times created because of the necessity for\r\nproviding protection against their Indian, French, and Dutch foes. In\r\ngeneral, we may say, confederation was early brought about through need\r\nfor defense, but union has been the result of two centuries and a half\r\nof growth.\r\n\r\nUnion of the New England Colonies, 1643.--A notable attempt was\r\nmade to form a confederation among the colonies in 1643. It is known as\r\nthe New England Confederation, and included Massachusetts Bay, New\r\nPlymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven colonies. Their united energies\r\nwere necessary to furnish protection against dangers from the Indians.\r\nThe Dutch and French also tended constantly to encroach upon their\r\nrights. The governing body of this confederation was a board of\r\ncommissioners. In the annual meetings of the commissioners, two being\r\nsent from each colony, questions of war, relations with the Indians, and\r\nother matters of mutual interest were discussed. But this central\r\ngovernment possessed advisory powers only. The colonies were to provide\r\nfor their own local government. The confederation became constantly\r\nweaker, and was finally dissolved in 1684. Seventy years were to elapse\r\nbefore the call was sent out for a meeting of delegates from all the\r\ncolonies at Albany, but the influence of the New England Confederacy was\r\nfelt, no doubt, during that period.\r\n\r\nThe Albany Congress, 1754.--Open hostilities with their enemies\r\nbecame more and more frequent. From the outbreak of King William's War,\r\nin 1689, to 1754, the date of the Albany Congress, there were at least a\r\ndozen intercolonial conferences called to consider means for the common\r\ndefense. Plans for union were also prepared. The most interesting is\r\nthat of William Penn. In it the word \"Congress\" is used for the first\r\ntime in connection with American affairs. As the final struggle with\r\nFrance for the possession of America was about to begin, a \"Congress\" of\r\ntwenty-five of the leading men from seven different colonies met at\r\nAlbany. They were called, primarily, for the purpose of making a treaty\r\nwith the Iroquois Indians. This object secured, the resolution was then\r\nunanimously adopted that \"A union of all the colonies is at present\r\nabsolutely necessary for security and defense.\" Franklin's famous plan\r\nproviding for a permanent federation of all the colonies was also\r\nadopted. When submitted to the colonies, it failed to receive the\r\nratification of a single one. Nor was it acceptable to the English\r\ngovernment. Said Franklin, \"The assemblies all thought there was too\r\nmuch prerogative, and in England it was thought to have too much of the\r\ndemocratic.\"\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act Congress, 1765.--After the passing of the stamp act\r\nby the English government, the Massachusetts house of representatives\r\ninvited the other colonial assemblies to send delegations to a general\r\ncongress. Nine colonies responded by sending twenty-eight men to the\r\ncongress in New York City, October 7, 1765.[6] During the session of two\r\nweeks, these delegates drafted petitions to the English government and\r\ndeclared that the rights of the colonists were the same as those of the\r\nnatural-born subjects of England. It is noteworthy that representatives\r\nhad again assembled on the motion of the colonists themselves. The\r\ngrowth of common interests was well expressed by Christopher Gadsden of\r\nSouth Carolina, when he said: \"There ought to be no New England man, no\r\nNew Yorker, known on the continent; but all of us Americans.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Virginia, New Hampshire, Georgia, and North Carolina\r\nsympathized with the movement, but did not send delegates.]\r\n\r\nCommittees of Correspondence.--Nine years were to go by before the\r\nmeeting of another congress, but the colonists were prepared for a\r\nunited effort at the end of this period. No sooner were the contents of\r\nthe Townshend acts of 1767 known than Massachusetts issued a circular\r\nletter to the other colonies, asking for combined action against all\r\nsuch unconstitutional measures. The other colonial assemblies agreed\r\nwith Massachusetts. Another movement which made the Revolution possible\r\nwas begun by Samuel Adams. In November, 1772, he prevailed upon the\r\nBoston town meeting to appoint a committee which should carry on a\r\ncorrespondence with committees organized in other towns of that colony.\r\nRights and grievances were the chief subjects for consideration. Other\r\ncolonies adopted this plan. Led by Virginia, the idea was carried one\r\nstep further, and in 1773 were formed committees of correspondence\r\nbetween the different colonies. Thus they were prepared for united\r\naction in the First and Second Continental Congresses.\r\n\r\nThe First Continental Congress, 1774.--When the coercive acts of\r\n1774 had been passed, Massachusetts, now in greatest need, called for a\r\ncongress of all the colonies. Delegates from all, Georgia[7] excepted,\r\nassembled at Philadelphia, September 5, 1774. In the Declaration of\r\nRights, and in the adoption of the Articles of Association, they gave\r\nfull expression to colonial sentiment. They commended the resistance of\r\nthe people of Massachusetts. They declared that all \"America ought to\r\nsupport them in their opposition,\" if force should be used in carrying\r\nout the measures of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Georgia was in sympathy with this movement.]\r\n\r\nThe Second Continental Congress, 1775.--Before adjourning, the\r\nFirst Continental Congress provided for the meeting of another congress,\r\nin May, 1775, unless the causes for colonial grievances should be\r\nearlier removed by the English government. But other measures of\r\nrepression were quickly passed, and before the Second Continental\r\nCongress met, the battle of Lexington had been fought and the American\r\nforces were blockading Boston. This congress convened in Philadelphia\r\nMay 10, 1775, and continued in session, with adjournments from time to\r\ntime, until May 1, 1781. All of the colonies were represented. Like\r\nprevious congresses, this was, at first, merely an advisory body, but\r\nnecessity compelled it to act as a real government. It took control of\r\nmilitary affairs, provided for a currency, threw open American ports to\r\nthe ships of all nations, and did whatever else the necessities of the\r\ntime seemed to demand. Having been appealed to for advice, this congress\r\ntook a most notable position in recommending that new forms of\r\ngovernment should be established in the several States. By the year 1777\r\nten States had framed new constitutions. It furthered independence by\r\nappointing a committee to draft resolutions based on the ideas of\r\nindependence then everywhere present. The Declaration of Independence\r\nwas the result.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation.--Franklin early saw the need for a\r\nmore effective government than that of a revolutionary assembly. On July\r\n21, 1775, he presented to Congress a plan for \"perpetual union.\" Nearly\r\na year elapsed before a committee was appointed to prepare some form for\r\nconfederation to be entered into between the colonies. Another period of\r\na year and five months was to go by before the report of this committee\r\nwas adopted by the Continental Congress. It was then submitted to the\r\nState legislatures for approval. After three years and a half, on March\r\n1, 1781, Maryland, the last State, was induced to ratify the Articles of\r\nConfederation. The adoption of these articles is one of the most\r\nimportant events in the history of our nation. While the Articles of\r\nConfederation must always be regarded as a weak instrument of\r\ngovernment, we must not forget that the Continental Congress was then\r\nworking out problems in the province of government that were almost\r\nwholly new. The solution, faulty as it was, went far to establish the\r\nplace of the written Constitution as a basis for government.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Said John Fiske: \"Almost everything else in our fundamental\r\n     institutions was brought by our forefathers in a more or less\r\n     highly developed condition from England; but the development of the\r\n     written Constitution, with the consequent relation of the courts to\r\n     the law-making power, has gone on entirely upon American soil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical Working of the Government.--Conditions soon proved the\r\narticles unsatisfactory. The States were almost independent of the\r\ncentral government. There was no separate executive power to enforce,\r\nand no judiciary to interpret the laws. The nation was deep in debt, and\r\nwithout means for payment. Paper money of the period was worthless, and\r\ndebtors were rebellious. Disputes between the various States brought\r\nthem to the verge of civil war. Each State had its own system of duties\r\nand imposts, which led to great confusion in commerce. No important\r\nresolution could be passed in Congress without the votes of nine States.\r\nNo amendment was possible, except by the votes of all the States.\r\nCongress became constantly weaker as various members resigned to accept\r\npositions under State authority. In that most dangerous period of our\r\nhistory, extending from 1783 to 1788, aptly called the \"critical\r\nperiod,\" it became constantly more apparent that government under the\r\nArticles of Confederation was a failure. Fortunately, in this hour of\r\ngloom, there came forward Washington, Hamilton, Madison, and other\r\nleaders, who were prepared, if need be, to make compromises, but who\r\nwere determined to preserve the elements of the union already secured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

Finally, in March, 1785,\r\ncommissioners from these States met at Alexandria to consider these\r\ndifficulties. The outcome of the meeting was that Virginia proposed a\r\nconvention and called for delegates from all of the States to meet to\r\nconsider how commerce should be controlled. Delegates from five States\r\nonly were present at Annapolis on the day appointed, September 11, 1786.\r\nNothing permanent could be accomplished with so few States represented.\r\nBefore adjourning, however, they agreed to a resolution, framed by\r\nAlexander Hamilton, which proposed the calling of a convention at\r\nPhiladelphia to amend the Articles of Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Convention, 1787; Delegates.--All of the States, Rhode\r\nIsland excepted, were finally represented in this, one of the most\r\nnotable conventions in the history of the world. Among the fifty-five\r\ndelegates assembled were many who had already been conspicuous in public\r\naffairs. They were the choice men of the States from which they came.\r\nTwenty-nine of the number were university men. Washington and Franklin\r\nwere present, and Washington was unanimously chosen president of the\r\nconvention. Neither of these men took an active part in the debates; but\r\ntheir presence gave inspiration to the other members, and they had\r\nuntold influence at critical times. Among the ablest members were\r\nAlexander Hamilton of New York; James Madison of Virginia; Oliver\r\nEllsworth and William S. Johnson of Connecticut; James Wilson and\r\nGouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania; Rufus King of Massachusetts; and\r\nCharles C. Pinckney of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Our Knowledge of the Convention.--The Convention lasted from\r\n     May 25 to September 17, 1787. The sessions were secret. Fortunately\r\n     we are not dependent on the secretary's report alone for our\r\n     knowledge of the meetings.[8] Mr. Madison seemed to understand the\r\n     full meaning of the convention from the first, and decided to give\r\n     an accurate account of the proceedings. He wrote: \"Nor was I\r\n     unaware of the value of such a contribution to the fund of\r\n     materials for the history of a Constitution on which should be\r\n     staked the happiness of a people great even in its infancy, and\r\n     possibly the cause of liberty throughout the world.\" His notes were\r\n     purchased by the government from Mrs. Madison, in 1837, for the sum\r\n     of thirty thousand dollars. They were published as \"Madison's\r\n     Journal of the Constitutional Convention.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: It was published in 1819 as a part of Volume I of \"Elliot's\r\nDebates.\"]\r\n\r\nPlans for a Government; Virginia Plan.--The magnitude of the labors\r\nof this convention can be understood only when we read the report of the\r\ndiscussions as given by Madison. It was at once determined that no time\r\nshould be lost in patching up the articles, but that a new Constitution\r\nshould be formed. Two sets of resolutions were early submitted, each\r\nsetting forth a plan of government. The Virginia plan was largely the\r\nwork of Mr. Madison. It provided for the establishment of a national\r\ngovernment with supreme legislative, executive, and judicial powers. The\r\nlegislative power was to be vested in a Congress of two separate houses.\r\nThe executive was to be chosen by both houses of Congress and the\r\njudiciary by the Senate. Representation in both houses of Congress was\r\nto be based on population or the contributions to the support of the\r\ngovernment. This scheme was fiercely attacked by the delegates from the\r\nsmall States, for it would clearly give control into the hands of the\r\nmore powerful States.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey Plan.--The New Jersey plan, presented by Mr.\r\nPatterson of that State, was agreed upon by the members from\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. This\r\nSmall-State plan, so called, provided for a continuance of the\r\ngovernment under the Articles of Confederation. They were to be revised\r\nin such a manner as to give Congress the power to regulate commerce, to\r\nraise revenue, and to coerce the States. The Small-State party insisted\r\nthat the Virginia plan, if adopted, would destroy the sovereignty of the\r\nStates. They would rather, they said, submit to a foreign power than be\r\ndeprived of equality of suffrage in both branches of the legislature.\r\nMadison, Wilson, King, and other leaders of the Large-State party\r\ndeclared that the basis for the new government was to be the people and\r\nnot the States; that it would be unfair to give Delaware as many\r\nrepresentatives as Virginia or Pennsylvania. After many days of\r\nfruitless debate, a compromise, sometimes called the \"First Great\r\nCompromise,\" was presented and finally adopted. This provided that the\r\nHouse of Representatives should be composed of members elected on the\r\nbasis of population. In the Senate, large and small States were to be\r\nequally represented.\r\n\r\nThe Slavery Problem; Second Compromise.--How was the number of the\r\nrepresentatives to be found? Were slaves to be counted a part of the\r\npopulation? A heated debate arose over these questions. The delegates\r\nfrom South Carolina maintained that slaves were a part of the population\r\nand as such should be counted. The answer was made that slaves were not\r\nrepresented in the legislatures of that and other States; that slaves\r\nwere regarded in those States merely as so much property, and as such\r\nought never to be represented. Finally, when it seemed that the work of\r\nthe convention must fail, a compromise, known as \"the three-fifths\r\ncompromise,\" was accepted. This provided that all free people should be\r\ncounted and three-fifths of the slaves.\r\n\r\nThe Third Compromise.--Slave-trade and commerce were the causes for\r\na third compromise. South Carolina and Georgia desired to have the\r\nimportation of slaves continued. Some of the other Southern States and\r\nthe Northern States generally were opposed. The New England members were\r\nanxious that the National government should have complete control of\r\nforeign commerce. This was resisted by some of the Southern delegates,\r\nwho feared that the importation of slaves might thereby be prohibited.\r\nFinally, a compromise was agreed upon which gave Congress power over\r\nforeign and interstate commerce, but forbade any act which might\r\nprohibit the importation of slaves before 1808. It was also agreed that\r\na tax of ten dollars each might be laid on all slaves imported. While\r\nthe entire Constitution may be said to be made up of compromises, the\r\nagreement upon these three rendered the further work of the convention\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nSigning the Constitution.--Gouverneur Morris was selected to give\r\nthe document its final form. The clear, simple English used is due\r\nlargely to him. After thirty-nine members, representing twelve different\r\nStates, had signed the Constitution, the convention adjourned. While the\r\nlast signatures were being written, Franklin said to those standing near\r\nhim, as he called attention to a sun blazoned on the back of the\r\nPresident's chair: \"I have, often and often, in the course of the\r\nsession, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue,\r\nlooked at that behind the President, without being able to tell whether\r\nit was rising or setting; but now, at length, I have the happiness to\r\nknow that it is a rising and not a setting sun.\"\r\n\r\nDifficulties of Ratification.--The convention submitted the\r\nConstitution to Congress. Here, for eight days, it was attacked by its\r\nopponents. Finally, Congress passed it on to the State legislatures. It\r\nwas sent by them to State conventions elected by the people. This\r\nratification was provided for by Article VII of the Constitution, as\r\nfollows: _The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be\r\nsufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the States\r\nso ratifying the same._\r\n\r\nThe period included between September 28, 1787, when Congress\r\ntransmitted the Constitution to the State legislatures, and June 21,\r\n1788, when New Hampshire, the last of the necessary nine States,\r\nratified, was one of the most critical in our history. Political\r\nparties, in a truly National sense, were formed for the first time.\r\nAmong the leaders who defended ably the views of those who opposed the\r\nratification of the Constitution were Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee,\r\nElbridge Gerry, and George Clinton. It was urged that there was no bill\r\nof rights,[9] that the President would become a despot, and that\r\nequality of representation in the Senate was an injustice to the larger\r\nStates. \"Letters from the Federal Farmer,\" prepared for the press of the\r\ncountry by Richard Henry Lee, set forth clearly the views of the\r\nAnti-Constitutional party.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: A bill of rights, in which the idea of the rights of man\r\nwere set forth, was a significant part of nearly all the State\r\nconstitutions. Englishmen, generally, had been familiar with the formal\r\nstatement of these principles since 1689, when William and Mary accepted\r\nthe Declaration of Rights as a condition of their receiving the crown of\r\nEngland. During the same year Parliament gave the Declaration of Rights\r\nthe form of a statute, under the name of the Bill of Rights. Among other\r\nrights it demanded that the king, without the sanction of Parliament,\r\nshould not raise an army, secure money, or suspend the laws; also, that\r\nthe right of petition, freedom in the exercise of religion, and equality\r\nunder the laws were to be granted all subjects.]\r\n\r\n\"The Federalist.\"--No influence was more noteworthy in bringing\r\nabout ratification than a series of political essays afterward collected\r\nunder the name of \"The Federalist.\" It is considered to-day the best\r\ncommentary on the Constitution ever written. Alexander Hamilton\r\noriginated the plan, and wrote 51 of the 85 numbers. James Madison wrote\r\n29, and John Jay 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Influence of Washington.--Washington was again a giant in\r\n     his support of the Constitution. In a letter to Patrick Henry he\r\n     early sounded an effective note of warning against anarchy,\r\n     expressing the very fear that finally led many in the conventions\r\n     to vote for the Constitution. He wrote: \"I wish the Constitution\r\n     which is offered had been more perfect; but it is the best that\r\n     could be obtained at this time, and a door is open for amendments\r\n     hereafter. The political concerns of this country are suspended by\r\n     a thread. The convention has been looked up to by the reflecting\r\n     part of the community with a solicitude which is hardly to be\r\n     conceived, and if nothing had been agreed upon by that body,\r\n     anarchy would soon have ensued, the seeds being deeply sown in\r\n     every soil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRatification Secured.--Delaware, the first State, ratified December\r\n6, 1787, without a dissenting vote. Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia,\r\nand Connecticut followed quickly. Much depended on the action of the\r\nMassachusetts convention. After prolonged debate, the delegates were\r\nfinally influenced by the statement that amendments might be made, and\r\nthey ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. The ninth State\r\nwas secured in the ratification by New Hampshire, June 21, 1788. It was\r\nnot until November 21, 1789, however, that North Carolina voted to\r\naccept the Constitution. Rhode Island held out until May 29, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe New Government Put into Operation.--When the ratification of\r\nthe ninth State had been secured, Congress appointed a special committee\r\nto frame an act for putting the Constitution into operation. It was\r\nenacted that the first Wednesday in January should be the day for\r\nappointing electors; that the electors should cast their votes for\r\nPresident on the first Wednesday in February, and that on the first\r\nWednesday of March the new government should go into operation. It was\r\nnot until April 1 that a quorum was secured in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and in the Senate not until April 6. The electoral\r\nvotes were counted in the presence of the two houses on April 6.[10] The\r\ninauguration of President Washington did not take place, however, until\r\nApril 30.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: New York did not choose electors. North Carolina and Rhode\r\nIsland, as we have seen, had not ratified the Constitution.]\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Constitution.--Before making a study of this\r\nepoch-making document, let us inquire briefly as to its origin. An\r\nanalysis of the Constitution shows that there are some provisions which\r\nare new and that English precedent had an influence. The main features,\r\nhowever, were derived from the constitutions of the States with whose\r\npractical workings the delegates were familiar. The following well-known\r\nstatement is an excellent summary: \"Nearly every provision of the\r\nFederal Constitution that has worked well is one borrowed from or\r\nsuggested by some State constitution; nearly every provision that has\r\nworked badly is one which the convention, for want of a precedent, was\r\nobliged to devise for itself.\"\r\n\r\nAuthority and Objects of the Constitution.--It was evidently the\r\nintention of the framers of the Constitution to found a government\r\nderiving its authority from the people rather than from the States. The\r\npurposes for which this was done are set forth in the following\r\nenacting clause, commonly called the preamble:--\r\n\r\n\"_We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the\r\ncommon defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this\r\nConstitution for the United States of America_.\"\r\n\r\nThis clause was attacked vigorously by the opponents of the\r\nConstitution, and especially in the Virginia and the North Carolina\r\nconventions. Said Patrick Henry: \"And here I would make this inquiry of\r\nthose worthy characters who composed a part of the late Federal\r\nConvention.... I have the highest veneration for those gentlemen; but,\r\nsir, give me leave to demand what right had they to say, 'We, the\r\npeople'?... Who authorized them to speak the language of, We, the\r\npeople, instead of, We, the States? If the States be not the agents of\r\nthis compact, it must be one great, consolidated, national government of\r\nthe people of all the States.\" It was argued, on the other hand, by\r\nRandolph, Madison, and others, that the government, under the Articles\r\nof Confederation, was a failure, and that the only safe course to pursue\r\nwas to have a government emanating from the people instead of from the\r\nStates, if the union of the States and the preservation of the liberties\r\nof the people were to be preserved.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND READINGS.\r\n\r\n1.

It was believed that with two houses one would be a check upon\r\nthe other, and that there would be less danger of hasty and oppressive\r\nlegislation. Another reason for the formation of a congress having two\r\nhouses was that the colonists were familiar with this kind of\r\nlegislature. It existed in all of the States, Pennsylvania and Georgia\r\nexcepted.\r\n\r\nTerm of Members and Qualifications of Electors.--Section 2, Clause\r\n1. _The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen\r\nevery second year by the people of the several States, and the electors\r\nin each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of\r\nthe most numerous branch of the State legislature_.\r\n\r\nA short term for representatives was agreed upon, for it was the design\r\nto make them dependent on the will of the people. The question\r\nfrequently arises, therefore, ought representatives to be compelled to\r\nreceive instructions from those who elect them? May we not agree that\r\nour legislation would often be more efficient if the welfare of the\r\nnation were considered, rather than what seems, for the moment, to be\r\nonly the concern of a district or even, a State? Securing the best\r\ninterests of all may mean at times, also, the sacrifice of mere party\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nWho May Vote for Representatives.--By the words _people_ and\r\n_electors_ is meant voters. With the desire to make the House of\r\nRepresentatives the more popular branch, it was decided to grant the\r\nright of voting for a representative to any person who might be\r\nprivileged to vote for a member of the lower house of the legislature of\r\nhis State. The freedom of a State to determine what these qualifications\r\nare is limited only by the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment:--\r\n\r\nAmendment XV. _The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall\r\nnot be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on\r\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude_.\r\n\r\nThis amendment was proposed by Congress in February, 1869, and was\r\ndeclared in force, March 30, 1870. It was for the purpose of granting\r\nmore complete political rights to the negroes, recently declared, by\r\nAmendment XIV, to be citizens.\r\n\r\nMethod and Time of Choosing Representatives.--The Constitution\r\nprescribes that representatives shall be elected by the people.\r\nCongress has provided that representatives shall be chosen on the\r\nTuesday next after the first Monday in November of the even-numbered\r\nyears.[11] Congress has also decreed that representatives shall be\r\nchosen by districts; but the State legislature has complete control of\r\nthe districting of its State. However, Congress has declared that these\r\ndistricts shall be composed of contiguous territory, and contain, as\r\nnearly as practicable, an equal number of inhabitants. Now, usage has\r\ndefined territory to be contiguous when it touches another portion of\r\nthe district at any one point. As a result of this questionable\r\ninterpretation, some States have been divided into districts of\r\nfantastic shapes, to promote the interests of the party having the\r\nmajority in the State legislature.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The only exceptions to this rule are: Maine holds its\r\nelection on the second Monday in September, and Vermont on the first\r\nTuesday in November.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: This process is called \"gerrymandering.\" See, also,\r\n\"Government in State and Nation,\" pp. 135, 136.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Proportional Representation.--Proportional representation,\r\n     which is coming into favor in these days, would doubtless do much\r\n     toward remedying this abuse. According to the present system of\r\n     electing representatives by districts, large minorities of voters\r\n     are not represented. Numerous plans of \"Proportional\r\n     Representation\" have been advocated. One such plan is in operation\r\n     in Illinois[13] for the election of members to the State house of\r\n     representatives. Each district elects three members on a general\r\n     ticket. The voter may give one vote to each candidate, or one and a\r\n     half votes to each of two candidates, or three votes to a single\r\n     candidate. Therefore, the minority, by concentrating their votes on\r\n     one candidate, may elect a representative to the legislature, when\r\n     under the district system they would not be represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: On proportional representation, read \"Government in State\r\nand Nation,\" pp. 14, 15.]\r\n\r\nQualifications of Representatives.--Section 2, Clause 2. _No\r\nperson shall be a representative who shall not have attained to the age\r\nof twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the United\r\nStates, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State\r\nin which he shall be chosen._\r\n\r\nIn the original States there was great diversity of qualifications for\r\nmembers of the lower houses of their legislatures. But some uniform\r\nsystem was necessary for the National organization, and so the few\r\nsimple requirements of this clause were introduced. It is understood,\r\nhowever, that the States may not add other qualifications. While a\r\nrepresentative must be an inhabitant of the State in which he is chosen,\r\nhe need not, so far as the Constitution requires, be an inhabitant of\r\nthe district. But the instances have been few in which a member of the\r\nHouse has not been also an inhabitant of the district which he\r\nrepresents. According to the English system of representation, a member\r\nof the House of Commons frequently represents a borough or county in an\r\nentirely different part of the kingdom from that of which he is an\r\ninhabitant.\r\n\r\n\r\n     May the House refuse to admit a person duly elected and possessing\r\n     the necessary qualifications? This question arose in the 56th\r\n     Congress, in the case of Brigham Roberts of Utah. He was finally\r\n     excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent System of Apportioning Representatives.--Section 2 of\r\nAmendment XIV contains the rule of apportionment that is now in\r\noperation. This became a part of the Constitution, July 28, 1868.\r\n\r\n_Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States\r\naccording to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of\r\npersons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right\r\nto vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and\r\nVice-President of the United States, representatives in Congress, the\r\nexecutive and judicial officers of a State, or the members of the\r\nlegislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such\r\nState, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States,\r\nor in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other\r\ncrime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the\r\nproportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the\r\nwhole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State_.\r\n\r\nThe second sentence of this section was framed in the belief that the\r\nStates, rather than lose a portion of their representatives in Congress,\r\nwould grant the right of suffrage to negroes already declared to be\r\ncitizens. But proportional reduction of representatives was never put\r\ninto practical operation, for before the next apportionment of\r\nrepresentatives, Amendment XV became a part of the Constitution, and\r\nnegro suffrage was put on the same basis as white. However, the\r\nenforcement of Section 2 of Amendment XIV has been strongly urged in our\r\nown time. This is because it is estimated that many thousands have been\r\ndisfranchised through the restrictions on the right of suffrage found in\r\nseveral of our State constitutions. Some require an educational test and\r\nothers a property qualification for voting.\r\n\r\nThe \"Indians not taxed\" doubtless refers to those Indians who still\r\nmaintain their tribal relations or who live on reservations in the\r\nseveral States. Their member, according to the census of 1910, was\r\n129,518.\r\n\r\nEarly Apportionment.--The number of representatives to which each\r\nof the States was originally entitled is given in Section 2, Clause 3,\r\nof the article we are now considering as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several\r\nStates which may be included within this Union, according to their\r\nrespective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole\r\nnumber of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of\r\nyears, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other\r\npersons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after\r\nthe first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every\r\nsubsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law\r\ndirect. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every\r\nthirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one representative;\r\nand until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire\r\nshall be entitled to choose three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and\r\nProvidence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey\r\nfour, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten,\r\nNorth Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three_.\r\n\r\nThe three-fifths rule was rendered void by the adoption of Amendment\r\nXIII, which abolished slavery, since there were no longer the \"other\r\npersons.\" That part of the clause which provides for the laying of\r\ndirect taxes is still in force.\r\n\r\nThe Census.--In order to carry out the provision of the\r\nConstitution, an \"actual enumeration\" was made in 1790. Since that date\r\nthere has been a census every ten years. The taking of the census and\r\nthe compilation and publication of the statistics connected with it are\r\nunder the supervision of the director of the census. Work on the\r\nthirteenth census was begun April 15, 1910, and required some 65,000\r\nenumerators, 3500 clerks, and 1800 special agents. The cost was some\r\n$12,000,000. The most important volumes found in the report are those on\r\npopulation,[14] manufactures, and agriculture. The taking of the census\r\nwill, in the future, be more economical and efficient because of the\r\nestablishment of the permanent census bureau by an act of Congress in\r\n1902.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The population of the United States, according to the\r\nfirst census, was 3,929,214. The population in 1910 was 91,972,266;\r\nincluding the possessions and dependencies, 101,000,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ratio of Representation.--The Constitution provided that there\r\n     should be 65 members in the first House of Representatives. After\r\n     the first census, Congress agreed that there should be one\r\n     representative for each 33,000 of the population. This gave a house\r\n     with 105 representatives. From that time the ratio of\r\n     representation has been changed every ten years. Otherwise, with\r\n     the rapid increase in population, the House would soon become too\r\n     large. The ratio adopted by the act of 1911 was one representative\r\n     to 211,877 people.[15] After March 4, 1913, therefore, there will\r\n     be at least 433 members, an increase of 42.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: For the method of apportionment, see \"Government in State\r\nand Nation,\" p. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The number of members in the English House of Commons is\r\n670; in the French Chamber of Deputies, 584; and in the German\r\nReichstag, 396.]\r\n\r\nMembers from New States.--Should a new State be admitted after the\r\napportionment is made, its representatives are always additional to the\r\nnumber provided for by law.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that each State shall have at least one\r\nrepresentative. If this provision had not been made, the States of\r\nArizona, Delaware, Nevada, and Wyoming, each having a smaller\r\npopulation than the ratio adopted in 1910, would not be represented.\r\n\r\nTerritorial Delegates.--The organized Territories are each entitled\r\nto send a delegate to the House of Representatives. He is allowed to\r\nspeak on any question that has to do with his Territory, but may not\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nVacancies.--Section 2, Clause 4. _When vacancies happen in the\r\nrepresentation from any State, the executive authority thereof shall\r\nissue writs of election to fill such vacancies_.\r\n\r\nWhen a vacancy occurs in the representation from any State on account of\r\ndeath, expulsion, or for other cause, it is made the duty of the\r\ngovernor of the State in which the vacancy exists to call for a special\r\nelection in that district to choose a representative for the remainder\r\nof the term.\r\n\r\nOfficers.--Section 2, Clause 5. _The House of Representatives shall\r\nchoose their Speaker and other officers, and shall have the sole power\r\nof impeachment_.\r\n\r\nThe speaker, who is the presiding officer, has always been a member of\r\nthe House, but the Constitution does not say that he _shall_ be. The\r\nother officers are the clerk, sergeant-at-arms, doorkeeper, postmaster,\r\nand chaplain, none of whom is a member of the House.\r\n\r\nNumber and Term of Office of Senators.--Section 3, Clause 1. _The\r\nSenate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from each\r\nState, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each senator\r\nshall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the\r\nqualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the\r\nState legislature_.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the provision that there should be two senators from\r\neach State was the result of a compromise. Consequently, New York and\r\nPennsylvania have the same number as Delaware and Nevada.[17] The term\r\nof six years for senators was likewise a compromise measure. There were\r\nmembers of the convention who favored three years; others wanted nine\r\nyears, and Hamilton desired that the term should be during good\r\nbehavior. Many States have practically lengthened the prescribed term by\r\nthe wise policy of returning acceptable senators for more than one term.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The Senate now contains 96 members; the English House of\r\nLords, 560; and the French Senate, 300.]\r\n\r\nPrior to April 8, 1913, when the Seventeenth Amendment became a part of\r\nthe Constitution, through ratification by the requisite votes of\r\nthree-fourths of the State legislatures, senators were chosen by the\r\nState legislatures. For years the demand for such an amendment was\r\ninsistent. More than two-thirds of the State legislatures had gone on\r\nrecord in favor of such a reform. The House of Representatives had\r\npassed such a resolution a number of times, but the requisite two-thirds\r\nvote could not be secured in the Senate. The leading reasons for the\r\namendment were: the frequent deadlocks in the legislatures, thus\r\ninterrupting the course of regular legislation, and the use of bribery.\r\n\r\nClasses of Senators and Vacancies.--Section 3, Clause 2.\r\n_Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first\r\nelection, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three\r\nclasses. The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated\r\nat the expiration of the second year; of the second class, at the\r\nexpiration of the fourth year; and of the third class, at the expiration\r\nof the sixth year; so that one-third may be chosen every second year.\r\nWhen vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate,\r\nthe executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to\r\nfill such vacancies. Provided, that the legislature of any State may\r\nempower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the\r\npeople fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct_.\r\n\r\n_This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or\r\nterm of any senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the\r\nConstitution_.\r\n\r\nThis provision makes the Senate a permanent body, since only one-third\r\nof the members go out of office every two years. In the first session of\r\nthe first Congress, the senators were divided into three classes. It has\r\nbeen the custom to place the senators from new States in different\r\nclasses. This is done in order to preserve, so far as possible, the\r\nequality of numbers in each class. Besides, a State is thus enabled to\r\nkeep one man of experience in the Senate. When a new State is admitted,\r\nthe senators from that State determine by lot, drawn in the presence of\r\nthe Senate, which classes they are to enter.\r\n\r\nQualifications of Senators.--Section 3, Clause 3. _No person shall\r\nbe a senator who shall not hove attained to the age of thirty years, and\r\nbeen nine years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when\r\nelected, be an inhabitant of that State from which he shall be chosen_.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for requiring different qualifications in senators from\r\nthose of representatives is expressed in \"The Federalist\" as follows:\r\n\"The propriety of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the\r\nsenatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent of information and\r\nstability of character, requires at the same time that the senator\r\nshould have reached a period of life most likely to supply these\r\nadvantages.\" The attitude of Americans toward the Senate to-day differs\r\nfrom that manifest during the first quarter century of our history. Has\r\nthe Senate degenerated is a question frequently asked. The presence in\r\nthat body of numerous millionaires has also excited unfavorable comment.\r\nThere have been two instances only in which senators have been\r\ndisqualified because of inadequate citizenship.\r\n\r\nTimes and Places for Electing Senators and\r\nRepresentatives.--Section 4, Clause 1. _The times, places, and\r\nmanner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be\r\nprescribed in each State by the legislature thereof; but the Congress\r\nmay at any time, by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to\r\nthe place of choosing senators_.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that Congress should have the _final_ authority in\r\nproviding for the election of its own members, because the very\r\nexistence of the Union might otherwise be left, at times, to the whims\r\nof the State legislatures.\r\n\r\nPresident of the Senate.--Section 3, Clause 4. _The Vice-President\r\nof the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no\r\nvote unless they be equally divided_.\r\n\r\nOther Officers.--Section 3, Clause 5. _The Senate shall choose\r\ntheir other officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the absence\r\nof the Vice-President, or when he shall exercise the office of President\r\nof the United States_.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President of the United States is the presiding officer of the\r\nSenate. He cannot take part in debates, and has no vote unless there be\r\na tie. In marked contrast with the power of the speaker, he cannot name\r\nthe committees, and has no direct authority in legislation. Indeed, the\r\noffice is regarded as one of so little influence that it is sometimes\r\ndifficult to secure, as candidates for it, men of recognized prominence.\r\n\r\nThe other officers of the Senate are secretary, chief clerk,\r\nsergeant-at-arms, chaplain, postmaster, librarian, and doorkeeper, none\r\nof whom is a member of the Senate. It is desirable, in the absence of\r\nthe Vice-President, that the Senate should have a presiding officer. At\r\nthe opening of the session, therefore, that body chooses from its own\r\nmembers a president _pro tempore_. He may vote on any question, but\r\ncannot cast the deciding vote in case of a tie.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress Meets.--Section 4, Clause 2. _The Congress shall\r\nassemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall be on the\r\nfirst Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint a different\r\nday_.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, representatives are elected for a term of two\r\nyears. This period defines the length of a Congress. Representatives, as\r\nwe know, are chosen on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in\r\nNovember. Now the term of office of a representative begins legally on\r\nthe fourth of March succeeding the time of his election.[18] The first\r\nregular session of the Congress to which he was elected does not begin\r\nuntil the first Monday of the following December, or thirteen months\r\nafter the election. It would seem desirable that the members should be\r\ngiven an earlier opportunity to express themselves on the issues upon\r\nwhich they have been chosen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: The limits of the 63d Congress will be March 4, 1913, to\r\nMarch 4, 1915.]\r\n\r\nSessions of Congress.--Each Congress has two regular sessions. The\r\nfirst is called the \"long session,\" for its length is not determined by\r\na definite date of adjournment. It usually lasts until midsummer and may\r\nnot extend beyond the first Monday in December, the time fixed for the\r\nbeginning of the next session. The second, or \"short session,\" cannot\r\nextend beyond 12 M. of March 4, the time set for a new Congress to\r\nbegin. The President may convene Congress in special session.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Organization of Congress.--The first Monday in December of\r\n     each second year is a notable day in Washington, for the formal\r\n     opening of a new Congress is regarded as an important event. The\r\n     House of Representatives must go through the entire process of\r\n     organization. To the clerk of the preceding House are intrusted the\r\n     credentials of the members, and from these he makes out a list of\r\n     those who are shown to be regularly elected. At the hour of\r\n     assembly he calls the roll from this list, announces whether or not\r\n     a quorum is present, and states that the first business is to elect\r\n     a speaker. After his election the speaker takes the oath of office,\r\n     which is administered by the member who has had the longest service\r\n     in the House. The speaker then administers the oath to the members\r\n     by States. The election of the chief clerk and the other officers\r\n     follows, after which the House is said to be organized.\r\n\r\n     The Senate is a \"continuing body,\" and no formal organization is\r\n     necessary. At the opening of a new Congress the Vice-President\r\n     calls the Senate to order and the other officers resume their\r\n     duties. After the president _pro tempore_ has been chosen, the\r\n     newly elected members are escorted to the desk in groups of four,\r\n     and the oath is administered by the president of the Senate. Each\r\n     house, when organized, notifies the other of the fact, and a joint\r\n     committee of the houses is appointed to wait upon the President and\r\n     inform him that quorums are present and are ready to receive any\r\n     communication he may desire to send.\r\n\r\n     The House of Representatives occupies a large hall in the south\r\n     wing of the capitol. The desks of the members are arranged in a\r\n     semicircle about that of the speaker, with the Republicans on his\r\n     left and the Democrats on his right. When a member gains the floor,\r\n     he speaks from his own desk or from the space in front of the\r\n     speaker's desk. Unless the question is one of importance, but\r\n     little attention is paid to the course of debate. Consequently a\r\n     visitor can hear only with great effort because of the constant din\r\n     produced by the shuffling of papers, clapping of hands for pages,\r\n     etc. The real work of Congress, as we shall see, is done in\r\n     committees. The Senate occupies a hall at the opposite end of the\r\n     capitol. It is, of course, much smaller than that occupied by the\r\n     House, but is similarly arranged. In general, the proceedings on\r\n     the floor of the Senate are conducted in a much more orderly manner\r\n     than is usual in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

IMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\nArticle II, Section 4. _The President, Vice-President and all civil\r\nofficers of the United States, shall be removed from office on\r\nimpeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors._\r\n\r\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause 5. _The House of Representatives shall ...\r\nhave the sole power of impeachment._\r\n\r\nSection 3, Clause 6. _The Senate shall have the sole power to try all\r\nimpeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or\r\naffirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief\r\nJustice shall preside; and no person shall be convicted without the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds of the members present._\r\n\r\nSection 3, Clause 7. _Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend\r\nfurther than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and\r\nenjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but\r\nthe party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to\r\nindictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law._\r\n\r\nThere have been but seven impeachment trials in the history of our\r\ngovernment. Section 4 of Article II declares who may be impeached. The\r\nexpression \"civil officer\" does not include military and naval officers.\r\nThey are subject to trial by court-martial. Members of Congress may not\r\nbe impeached, since the Constitution authorizes each house to bring to\r\ntrial and punish its own members. Clause 5 of Section 2, and Clauses 6\r\nand 7 of Section 3, Article I, give the method of procedure against an\r\nofficer who may be charged with \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes\r\nand misdemeanors.\" The articles of impeachment preferred by the House of\r\nRepresentatives correspond to the indictment in a criminal trial. The\r\nmanner of conducting an impeachment trial, in the Senate, resembles also\r\na trial by jury.[19] That the \"Chief Justice shall preside\" during the\r\ntrial of the President of the United States is a wise provision, because\r\nit is easy to presume that a Vice-President might be personally\r\ninterested in the conviction of a President.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See \"Government in State and Nation,\" p. 159.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE QUORUM, JOURNAL, AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH.\r\n\r\nDetermination of Membership and Quorums.--Section 5, Clause 1.\r\n_Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall\r\nconstitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn\r\nfrom day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of\r\nabsent members, in such manner and under such penalties as each house\r\nmay provide._\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the right of a senator to a seat in the Senate was challenged by\r\nthe citizens of his State on the ground that his election was secured\r\nthrough bribery and corruption. In a memorial of the citizens forwarded\r\nby the governor, the matter formally came before the Senate. The case\r\nwas referred to the Committee on Privileges and Elections, which\r\nunanimously reported, after careful deliberation, that the senator was\r\nnot duly and legally elected by the legislature of his State. The\r\ncommittee found that he had obtained through illegal and corrupt\r\npractices more than eight votes which would otherwise have been cast\r\nagainst him and changed the result. Before a vote was taken in the\r\nSenate on this resolution the senator resigned his seat.\r\n\r\nIn the House the name of the person possessing the certificate of\r\nelection signed by the governor of his State is entered on the roll of\r\nthe House, but the seat may still be contested. Many cases of contested\r\nelections are considered by each new House. There were thirty-two seats\r\ncontested in the 54th Congress. Such cases are referred to the Committee\r\non Elections, which hears the testimony, and presents it to the House\r\nfor final decision. Each of the cases when presented to the House\r\nconsumes from two to five days which might otherwise be used for the\r\npurposes of legislation. The law provides that no more than $2000 shall\r\nbe paid either of the contestants for expenses, but even then, it is\r\nestimated, these contests cost the government, all told, $40,000\r\nannually. When the decision is rendered by the House, the vote is, in\r\nmost cases, strictly on party lines, regardless of the testimony. In\r\nview of these facts, it has been suggested that the Supreme Court decide\r\nall contested elections.\r\n\r\nHow a Quorum is Secured.--If it appears, upon the count of the\r\nspeaker, or upon the roll-call of the House, that a majority is not\r\npresent, business must be suspended until a quorum is secured. Fifteen\r\nmembers, including the speaker, may be authorized to compel the\r\nattendance of absent members. This is accomplished as follows: the doors\r\nof the House are closed, the roll is called, and absentees noted. The\r\nsergeant-at-arms, when directed by the majority of those present, sends\r\nfor, arrests, and brings into the House those members who have not\r\nsufficient excuse for absence. When a quorum is secured, business is\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nRules and Discipline.--Section 5, Clause 2. _Each house may\r\ndetermine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for\r\ndisorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a\r\nmember._\r\n\r\nThe Journal.--Section 5, Clause 3. _Each house shall keep a journal\r\nof its proceedings and from time to time publish the same, excepting\r\nsuch parts as may in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and\r\nnays of the members of either house on any question shall, at the desire\r\nof one-fifth of those present, be entered on the journal._\r\n\r\nOur Knowledge of Congressional Proceedings.--As citizens in a\r\nrepublican government, it is our duty to keep informed on the problems\r\nwhich our representatives are called upon to solve. Means of gaining\r\ninformation are not wanting. The public galleries of both houses are\r\nusually open to visitors. The official record of the proceedings of\r\nCongress is made known to the public through the Journal, which is read\r\nat the opening of each day's session. Reports of the debates do not\r\nappear in the Journal, but are published each day in the _Congressional\r\nRecord_.\r\n\r\nAnother means of keeping constituents informed on the position of their\r\nrepresentatives is through the recording in the Journal of the vote of\r\neach member when demanded by one-fifth of those present. In voting by\r\nthe \"yeas and nays,\" the clerk calls the roll of members and places\r\nafter each name, \"yea,\" \"nay,\" \"not voting,\" or \"absent.\" The Senate\r\nrules specify this as the only method of voting. (Other methods of\r\nvoting in the House are indicated on page 77.)\r\n\r\nPower to Adjourn.--Section 5, Clause 4. _Neither house, during the\r\nsession of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn\r\nfor more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the\r\ntwo houses shall be sitting._\r\n\r\nIf there is a disagreement between the two houses with respect to the\r\ntime of adjournment, the President may adjourn them to such a time as he\r\nthinks proper. This right has never yet been exercised.\r\n\r\nCompensation and Freedom from Arrest.--Section 6, Clause 1. _The\r\nsenators and representatives shall receive a compensation for their\r\nservices, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury of the\r\nUnited States. They shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and\r\nbreach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance\r\nat the sessions of their respective houses, and going to and returning\r\nfrom the same; and for any speech or debate in either house, they shall\r\nnot be questioned in any other place._\r\n\r\nShould the members of Congress be paid a salary, or should the office be\r\nregarded as exclusively one of honor? These questions were discussed at\r\nlength in the Constitutional Convention. Some of the delegates favored\r\nthe English custom, by which members of Parliament receive no salary. It\r\nwas finally concluded to adopt the provisions as given, in order that\r\nmen of ability, though poor, might become members of the National\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n     By a law of 1789 the compensation of senators and representatives\r\n     was fixed at six dollars per day and thirty cents for every mile\r\n     traveled, by the most direct route, in going to and returning from\r\n     the seat of government. Prior to 1873 this amount was changed\r\n     several times by act of Congress. The compensation then agreed upon\r\n     and until 1907 was $5000 per year, with mileage of twenty cents,\r\n     and $125 per annum for stationery. The speaker received $8000 a\r\n     year and mileage. The president _pro tempore_ received the same\r\n     amount while acting as president of the Senate.\r\n\r\n     To many people $5000 seemed a large salary, but the great expense\r\n     of living in Washington renders the salary quite inadequate.\r\n     Members have been known to pay more than their salaries for\r\n     house-rent alone. Accordingly, in 1907, the salary of senators and\r\n     representatives was increased to $7500 and that of the speaker and\r\n     president _pro tempore_ of the Senate to $12,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Hold Other Offices. Disqualification.--Section 6, Clause 2. _No\r\nsenator or representative shall, during the time for which he is\r\nelected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the\r\nUnited States which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof\r\nshall have been increased, during such time; and no person holding any\r\noffice under the United States shall be a member of either house during\r\nhis continuance in office._\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this provision seems to have been to remove the\r\ntemptation on the part of Congressmen to create offices, or to increase\r\nthe emoluments of those already existing, in order to profit by such\r\nlegislation. The exclusion of United States officials from seats in\r\nCongress was due to the desire of appeasing State jealousy, which\r\nasserted that the National government would in this way secure an undue\r\ninfluence over the State governments. It is advocated, with good reason,\r\nthat members of the Cabinet should be privileged to take part in the\r\ndiscussion of measures in Congress which pertain to their own\r\ndepartments. Alexander Hamilton asked for this privilege. It was refused\r\nbecause of the belief that he would exert too great influence over the\r\nmembers. The precedent thus established has always been retained.\r\n\r\nBut since executive officers are often invited to present their views\r\nbefore committees of Congress, they may, in this way, exert great\r\ninfluence upon legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LAWS ARE MADE BY CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nMethods of Procedure Developed by Custom.--Very little can be\r\nlearned directly from the Constitution concerning the actual methods\r\nemployed in the enactment of laws by Congress. In both houses the ways\r\nin which business is conducted have been developed by custom; and they\r\nhave changed from time to time according to circumstances. These methods\r\nof procedure are different from those in use when the government was\r\nnew. The principal reason for this is found in the growth of the amount\r\nof business that Congress must consider; this, in turn, has been caused\r\nby the growth of population and wealth, and by the expansion of business\r\nrelations throughout this country and with other nations.\r\n\r\nI. _The Committee System._--An understanding of this system is necessary\r\nin order that we may follow the steps taken in the making of laws. Two\r\nfacts made the committee system necessary in the houses of Congress. (1)\r\nThe number of members, especially in the House of Representatives, is so\r\nlarge that business cannot be transacted quickly by the entire body. (2)\r\nThe number of bills introduced is so very great that it is impossible\r\nfor either house to consider all of them; hence it is necessary that\r\ncommittees shall examine the bills and decide which are worthy of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n     In the long session of the 61st Congress more than 33,000 bills\r\n     were introduced into the House. The number of committees in the\r\n     House was 61, the membership varying from 5 to 19. The most\r\n     important House committees are those on Ways and Means (which has\r\n     charge of all bills for raising revenue), Appropriations, Banking\r\n     and Currency, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs. In the Senate\r\n     of the 61st Congress there were 72 standing committees. The number\r\n     of members on a committee was in most cases 9 or 11. A few of the\r\n     Senate committees are those on Finance (corresponding to the\r\n     Committee on Ways and Means in the House), Agriculture, Commerce,\r\n     and Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\n     Both in the House and in the Senate every member is on some\r\n     committee, and some members have places on several committees. In\r\n     both houses the committees are elected. The chairman and a majority\r\n     of the members of each committee are from the members of the party\r\n     that has a majority in the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps in the Progress of a Bill.--(1) The first step in the\r\nprogress of a bill is its _introduction_. This is done in the House by\r\nmerely placing the bill in a basket on the clerk's desk. In the Senate\r\nthe member introducing a bill rises and asks leave to introduce it.\r\n\r\n(2) The bill is next _referred_ to a committee.\r\n\r\n(3) If the committee decides that the bill should go further they\r\n_report it_ back to the house.\r\n\r\nThe house will in a great majority of cases pass or reject it according\r\nto the committee's recommendation. Few bills are debated in either\r\nhouse, and in the most of these cases the discussion has no influence\r\nupon the fate of the bill--it is meant merely to be heard or to be\r\nprinted. Hence, it is in that intermediate stage between the reference\r\nof the bill to a committee and the report on it that the real work of\r\nlegislation is accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Power of Committees over Bills.--A committee may exercise the\r\nutmost freedom with respect to the bills referred to it. The greater\r\nnumber of bills receive no consideration whatever from the committees;\r\nthese may never be reported if the committees see fit to ignore them.\r\nOther bills are amended by the committees, or new bills are substituted\r\nfor them. Such is the power intrusted to Congressional committees.\r\nHowever, if a majority of the house wishes, it may take up for\r\ndiscussion a bill which one of its committees has decided not to report\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Many of the important committees have separate rooms where their\r\n     meetings are held. Here the members may confer in secret, or they\r\n     may hold public hearings; i.e., persons are invited to give\r\n     testimony or to make arguments. Frequently the majority members of\r\n     a committee hold separate meetings, determine their policy, and\r\n     then adhere to it regardless of the wishes of the minority members.\r\n     The latter may present a separate report called the _minority\r\n     report_ of the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsideration of Bills.--(4) In the next step, the bill is brought\r\nbefore the house for consideration. How is it determined which bills\r\nshall be thus favored? In some measure this depends upon the importance\r\nand the merits of the bill; but it depends more upon the skill and\r\ninfluence of the member (generally the chairman of the committee\r\nreporting the bill) who is particularly interested in seeing it enacted\r\ninto law. In the House of Representatives this important matter is most\r\noften decided by the Committee on Rules, which is composed of ten\r\nmembers, six being of the party that has a majority in the House. In\r\nmost cases this committee decides which bills shall be considered, and\r\nhow much time shall be given to the discussion of each one. So it is\r\nnecessary for the chairman of a committee to make a previous arrangement\r\nwith the speaker to be recognized before he can bring up his bill. But\r\non Wednesday of each week the chairmen of committees may call up their\r\nbills in the order in which they secure recognition. And the Committee\r\non Rules does not control the bills which the House takes out of the\r\nhands of committees.\r\n\r\nII. _The Power of the Speaker._--The speaker is the executive officer\r\nwho sees that the decisions of the Committee on Rules are carried out.\r\nIn most important matters it is necessary for a member to make an\r\narrangement with the speaker in order to secure recognition when he\r\nwishes to address the House.\r\n\r\nIn exercising the power of _recognition_, the speaker will, of course,\r\ngive both the sides a fair opportunity to debate upon important\r\nmeasures. He will not permit members to make motions or lengthy speeches\r\nmerely for the sake of delaying some action to which they are opposed.\r\nSuch actions are called _obstructive tactics_, or _filibustering_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Lobby, Log-rolling, and Patronage.--Not all the bills that\r\n     come before Congress are passed or rejected because they are wise\r\n     or unwise. The influences that determine the course of legislation\r\n     at Washington are very numerous and complicated. Some of these\r\n     influences are to a greater or less extent legitimate, and others\r\n     are totally bad. The _lobby_, in its broadest sense, is composed of\r\n     all those persons who go to Washington in order to exert pressure\r\n     upon Congressmen in favor of or against certain measures. Some of\r\n     the best laws and some of the worst are enacted through the\r\n     influence of the lobbyist. _Log-rolling_ is an important influence\r\n     in determining legislation; a member votes for the pet measure of\r\n     his fellow Congressman on condition that the latter will vote for\r\n     the bill in which he is particularly interested. Political\r\n     _patronage_ is a great factor in determining votes in Congress; the\r\n     power of members to recommend appointments, and the influences\r\n     exerted in their favor by the appointees, often determine the\r\n     question of their continuance in office. Consequently, there is a\r\n     great temptation to use patronage in exchange for votes. The use of\r\n     money directly in _bribery_ is difficult of detection, but other\r\n     favors and privileges of money value are no less effective in the\r\n     purchase of the votes of those members who are so unscrupulous as\r\n     to be open to such influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nDebate in Congress.--It is now apparent that many other things\r\nbesides the arguments used in debate determine which bills shall pass\r\nand which shall fail. In the House the time for debate is strictly\r\nlimited, on account of the amount of business. The chairman of the\r\ncommittee reporting a bill generally has one hour in which to urge the\r\npassage of his measure; for a portion of the time he may _yield the\r\nfloor_ to other members, both friends and opponents of the bill. Of\r\ncourse, much more than one hour is given to debate on important bills.\r\nMany of the speeches which are printed in the _Congressional Record_\r\nhave not been delivered; but they are intended for circulation among the\r\nconstituents of representatives, and for use as campaign documents. Many\r\nof the speeches that are actually delivered receive scant attention; the\r\nlack of interest in them is made evident by the noise and confusion\r\nthat very often prevail during sessions of the House.\r\n\r\nSenate Procedure.--In the Senate debate is not limited. Senators\r\nare expected to regard each other's rights with respect to the amount of\r\ntime and attention they may demand; yet a bill may be \"talked to death\"\r\nin the Senate. As a result, the Senate is less business-like in its\r\nprocedure than the House, and some means of checking unlimited\r\ndiscussion have often been proposed for it.\r\n\r\nConference Committees.--A bill which has passed one house must be\r\nsent to the other. Here it is introduced and goes through the stages\r\nabove described. If one house amends a bill which has already passed the\r\nother, it must be returned for re-passage to the house where it\r\noriginated. This is a frequent cause of conflict between the two houses,\r\nand each tries to insist on its rights.\r\n\r\nWhen such a dispute cannot be easily adjusted, a _conference committee_\r\nmust be appointed. This is composed of members from each house, and they\r\nendeavor to arrange a compromise which will be acceptable to both\r\nhouses. Generally their decision is ratified without question, but\r\nsometimes even this method of settlement fails.\r\n\r\nMethods of Voting.--There are three methods of voting in Congress.\r\n(1) Members respond \"aye\" or \"no\" by acclamation. (2) If a _division_ is\r\ncalled for, a rising vote is taken and the members are counted. In the\r\nHouse the counting is done by two tellers, who stand near the speaker's\r\ndesk, while the members pass between them in single file, first those\r\nvoting in the affirmative, and afterward those opposing the motion. (3)\r\nWhen the \"yeas and nays\" are called for, or whenever the rules of either\r\nhouse require them, the roll is called and each member votes as he\r\nresponds to his name. This vote is entered on the Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n     After the roll-call is completed, the presiding officer announces\r\n     the _pairs_. Members who belong to different political parties may\r\n     agree that they shall be recorded on opposite sides of party\r\n     questions, whether they are present or not. Or pairs may be\r\n     arranged for particular votes only. This device enables a member to\r\n     be absent from his seat without feeling that his vote is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Power in Law-Making.--A bill which has received a\r\nmajority vote in both houses is next sent to the President.\r\n\r\nArticle 1, Section 7, Clause 2. _Every bill which shall have passed the\r\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate shall, before it become a law,\r\nbe presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he\r\nshall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections, to\r\nthat house in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the\r\nobjections at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it. If\r\nafter such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass\r\nthe bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other\r\nhouse, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by\r\ntwo-thirds of that house it shall become a law. But in all such cases\r\nthe votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the\r\nnames of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered\r\non the journal of each house respectively. If any bill shall not be\r\nreturned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it\r\nshall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like\r\nmanner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their adjournment\r\nprevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law._\r\n\r\nThere are then three ways in which a bill may become a law. (1) It may\r\npass by majority vote in both houses and be signed by the President. (2)\r\nIt may, after being vetoed by the President, be passed by two-thirds\r\nvote in both houses. (3) It will become a law if the President neither\r\nsigns nor vetoes it within ten days, unless these are at the end of the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution intended that the veto power should be a\r\ncheck, though not an absolute one, upon hasty or unwise legislation. The\r\nPresident may cause a bill to fail by neither signing nor vetoing it\r\nduring the last ten days of a session. The term _pocket veto_ has been\r\napplied to this method of defeating bills.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

NATIONAL FINANCES.\r\n\r\nThe Power of Taxation.--When we speak of the finances of a country,\r\nwe mean its revenues and expenditures. Revenues have their origin\r\nchiefly[20] in taxation, and the power vested in Congress by virtue of\r\nwhich taxes are imposed and collected is found in the following clause:\r\n\r\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 1. _The Congress shall have power to lay\r\nand collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and\r\nprovide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States;\r\nbut all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the\r\nUnited States._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Considerable sums are derived by our National government\r\nfrom the sale of public lands. See Chapter on Territories and Public\r\nLands.]\r\n\r\nDuties on Imports.--The two forms of taxes relied upon by the\r\nUnited States for its revenues are (1) duties and (2) excises.[21] A\r\nduty is a tax levied upon goods that are imported into the United\r\nStates.[22] The merchant doing business in New York, for example, cannot\r\nobtain possession of the goods he has imported until the officers of the\r\ncustom-house at that port have examined the _invoice_, or the list of\r\narticles in each package, with their prices; and the officers may\r\nexamine the goods, also, to see if they correspond in amount and quality\r\nto the statements of the invoice. The importer then pays to the\r\ncollector of the port of New York the amount of the duty levied on his\r\nimportation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The terms _duties_ and _imposts_ have nearly the same\r\nmeaning.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Duties on exports are prohibited in Section 9, Clause 5,\r\nof Article I: _No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from\r\nany State_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Kinds of Duties.--These are of two kinds. (1) _Specific_\r\n     duties are fixed amounts levied on certain units of measurement of\r\n     commodities, as the pound, yard, or gallon. Under the tariff law of\r\n     1909 the duty on tin-plate was one and two-tenths cents for each\r\n     pound. (2) _Ad valorem_ duties are levied at a certain rate per\r\n     cent on the value of the articles taxed. The law of 1909 laid a\r\n     duty of 60 per cent on lace manufactures.\r\n\r\n     On some articles both kinds of duties are levied. Under the law\r\n     just mentioned, the duties on carpets and rugs were 10 cents per\r\n     square foot and 40 per cent _ad valorem_ in addition.\r\n\r\n     Passengers on steamships coming from foreign countries are required\r\n     to declare what dutiable goods they have among their baggage, each\r\n     person being allowed to enter $100 worth of goods free of duty.\r\n     Upon landing, their baggage is examined; trunks and valises are\r\n     opened, and in suspected cases the persons of travelers are\r\n     searched for concealed dutiable goods. The temptation to\r\n     undervaluation and to smuggling, in order to escape this form of\r\n     taxation, is so great that constant vigilance is necessary at\r\n     custom-houses and along the borders of the United States to prevent\r\n     these frauds. Special agents and revenue cutters are employed to\r\n     detect violations of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\nTariff Laws.--A _tariff_ is the list of the rates of duties fixed\r\nby law. An importer of foreign goods must consider the amount of the\r\nduties he has paid as part of the cost of the goods when he sells them.\r\nIf a higher price is caused in this way, less of such goods will be\r\nimported and the production of the goods in this country will be\r\nencouraged. Consequently, high rates of duties may have a decided\r\ninfluence upon the industries of a country. When the rates of duties are\r\nso fixed as to bring about this result, we have a _protective_ tariff;\r\ni.e., one under which persons can produce in this country certain\r\narticles which otherwise they could not produce, because of their\r\ncheapness when imported from a foreign country. The duties are made so\r\nhigh that it is not profitable to import the articles. When rates of\r\nduties are fixed primarily with the object of raising revenue, and\r\nwithout regard to their effect upon the industries of the country, we\r\nhave a _tariff for revenue_. This kind of tariff is generally meant when\r\nthe term _free trade_ is used. Articles on which no duties are imposed\r\nare said to be on the _free list_. There is no country which fails to\r\ncollect duties on some of its importations.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Reciprocity Agreements.--The United States has entered into\r\n     _reciprocity treaties_ with various countries for securing the\r\n     reduction of tariff rates. Each country agrees to admit certain\r\n     products of the other country at reduced rates, or free of duty.\r\n     These are generally commodities in the production of which there is\r\n     little or no competition between the parties to the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Revenue Taxes.--Excises are taxes laid upon the\r\nmanufacture and sale of certain products within the country. At the\r\npresent time these _internal revenue_ taxes are levied by the National\r\ngovernment upon liquors,[23] tobacco, snuff, opium, oleomargarine,\r\nfilled cheese, mixed flour, and playing cards. The greater number of\r\nthese taxes are paid by the purchase of stamps, which must be affixed,\r\nin the proper denominations, to the articles taxed. When the packages\r\nare broken, the stamps must be destroyed so that they cannot be used\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Taxes are levied, not only upon the liquors themselves,\r\nbut upon the business of brewing and rectifying; of selling by wholesale\r\nand by retail; of manufacturing stills; and upon the stills themselves.\r\nA list of these taxes may be obtained from the collector of any internal\r\nrevenue district.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     War Taxes.--Because taxes of this kind are so easily\r\n     collected, the government has extended them to a great number of\r\n     articles when it suddenly needed a large revenue, as in the War of\r\n     1812, the Civil War, and the Spanish War of 1898. The law of 1898\r\n     increased the taxes on liquors and tobacco, and imposed new taxes\r\n     on (1) proprietary articles, and (2) documents. Under the first\r\n     heading fall patent medicines and compounds of various kinds.\r\n     Documentary taxes[24] were imposed upon legal papers, such as\r\n     deeds, mortgages, etc., and also upon bank checks and drafts,\r\n     telegraph and telephone messages, and express receipts. Under this\r\n     law the internal revenue receipts rose from $170,000,000 in 1898,\r\n     to $273,000,000 in 1899. Congress has repealed these special war\r\n     taxes.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 24: These were exactly like those imposed by Parliament\r\n     in the Stamp Act of 1765.]\r\n\r\n     Corporation Tax.--In 1909 Congress levied a tax upon\r\n     corporations. Every corporation doing interstate business is\r\n     required to report its earnings and its expenses. The difference\r\n     between these amounts is its _net earnings_. The law requires the\r\n     payment of one per cent of the net earnings that are in excess of\r\n     $5000.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules for Levying Taxes.--The Constitution contains three rules by\r\nwhich Congress must be guided in the levying of taxes. We have seen,\r\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 1, that _duties, imposts and excises must\r\nbe uniform throughout the United States_; that is, the same rates must\r\nprevail everywhere. Another provision, Article I, Section 2, Clause 3,\r\nis that _representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among\r\nthe several States ... according to their respective numbers_.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See also Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4: _No capitation,\r\nor other direct, tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or\r\nenumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken._]\r\n\r\nThe third provision is the Sixteenth Amendment, which became a part of\r\nthe Constitution in February, 1913: Article 16. _The Congress shall have\r\npower to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived,\r\nwithout apportionment among the several States, and without regard to\r\nany census or enumeration._\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, the following classification:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Direct    | persons,[26]|  Must be apportioned among\r\n   taxes,    | lands,      |    the States according to\r\n   levied on |             |    population.\r\n\r\nII. Indirect |   duties,   |  Must be uniform throughout\r\n    taxes    |   imposts,  |    the United States.\r\n             |   excises,  |\r\n             |   income    |\r\n             |    taxes.   |\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: These are _poll taxes_. Such a tax was levied on slaves in\r\n1798 and 1813.]\r\n\r\nSo far, we have discussed the indirect taxes only, for at present the\r\nUnited States levies no direct taxes. In our previous history, however,\r\nthe government has imposed all the kinds of taxes mentioned in the\r\noutline above. In levying a direct tax, Congress must determine the\r\ntotal amount to be raised (as $2,000,000 in 1798, and $20,000,000 in\r\n1861), and then apportion this amount among the States, according to\r\ntheir population.\r\n\r\nThe bills introduced into Congress which provide for taxation are\r\ncalled \"bills for raising revenue.\" They must originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives (Article I, Section 7, Clause 1). The Committee on Ways\r\nand Means frames these bills. In the Senate such bills are referred to\r\nthe Committee on Finance, and here the bills may be amended.\r\n\r\nThe Appropriation of Money.--Appropriation bills are those which\r\nprovide for the expenditure of the government's funds, and these bills\r\nare in charge of the committee on appropriations in each house.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of the principal items in the revenues and\r\nappropriations for the year ending June 30, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n          REVENUES.\r\nDuties                         $333,000,000\r\nInternal revenue                290,000,000\r\nMiscellaneous                    52,000,000\r\n                                -----------\r\nTotal                          $675,000,000\r\n\r\n        EXPENDITURES.\r\nWar Department                 $156,000,000\r\nNavy Department                 123,000,000\r\nIndian Bureau                    18,000,000\r\nPensions                        160,000,000\r\nInterest on public debt          21,000,000\r\nCivil list and miscellaneous    180,000,000\r\n                                -----------\r\nTotal                          $659,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Power to Borrow Money.--We have now seen how money is provided\r\nfor the government under ordinary circumstances. In extraordinary cases\r\nthis revenue is not sufficient; accordingly, Congress has been given\r\npower by Article 1, Section 8, Clause 2, _To borrow money on the credit\r\nof the United States_.\r\n\r\nMoney is borrowed in most cases by the sale of bonds. These are of the\r\nsame nature as the promissory notes by which individuals obtain loans.\r\nNational bonds state the promise of the United States to pay a certain\r\namount, at a stated time, with interest. A \"registered\" bond contains\r\nthe name of the owner, and this is a matter of record at the Treasury\r\nDepartment. When this bond is sold, the record must be changed. \"Coupon\"\r\nbonds are usually payable to bearer; they have attached to them a number\r\nof coupons equal to the number of interest payments due during the term\r\nof the bond. Each of these is cut off as the payment becomes due, and\r\ncan be cashed at any bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Bonds are bought and sold on the market, and their prices are\r\n     quoted in the daily papers. When the bonds fall due, they are\r\n     _redeemed_ by the government at their face value, or \"at par.\" On\r\n     the market all United States bonds are now selling \"at a premium.\"\r\n     Issues of bonds were made in 1898, the rate of interest being 3 per\r\n     cent, and in 1900, the rate being 2 per cent. The Public Debt\r\n     Statement issued monthly by the Treasury Department gives the\r\n     divisions of the bonded debt and the amount outstanding. On\r\n     December 1, 1910, the amount of the interest-bearing debt was\r\n     $913,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE POWER OF CONGRESS OVER COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nThe Control of Commerce.--The power over commerce, which we are\r\nnext to discuss, was given to Congress because the history of the\r\ncountry under the Articles of Confederation showed clearly that State\r\ncontrol of commerce resulted in confusion and constant disputes. It is\r\nnecessary that merchants and ship-owners should conduct their business\r\nunder laws that are as _uniform_ as possible. It is also necessary that\r\nthey should be _certain_ as to the terms of the law. These conditions\r\ncould not exist if each State were to make laws controlling the commerce\r\ngoing to other States and to foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution gives Congress the power, in Article I, Section 8,\r\nClause 3, _To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the\r\nseveral States, and with the Indian tribes_. Not all commerce that is\r\ncarried on by the citizens of this country is subject to control by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast amount of commerce that is carried on entirely within\r\nthe limits of the different States. Over this commerce Congress has no\r\npower; it is regulated by State laws relating to trade and\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nInterstate Commerce.--The distinction between State and interstate\r\ncommerce is not readily seen in many cases; but in general it may be\r\nsaid that if a commodity starts in one State destined for another, its\r\ncontrol throughout its course lies within the power of Congress. This\r\nprinciple applies to both land and water transportation. So the coast\r\ntrade among the States lies within the jurisdiction of Congress; also,\r\ncommerce upon those rivers that form highways between different States.\r\nThe harbors and waterways of the United States have been improved by the\r\nexpenditure of many millions of dollars. This money has been\r\nappropriated in the \"River and Harbor Bills\" that are passed by almost\r\nevery Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Law.--The importance of railroad\r\ntransportation led to the enactment, in 1887, of the \"Interstate\r\nCommerce Law,\" controlling this form of commerce. The law became\r\nnecessary because of certain abuses which had arisen. In many instances\r\nthe railroads gave lower freight rates to certain persons than to others\r\ndoing the same kind of business; again, the merchants or manufacturers\r\nof certain cities were favored by more liberal rates than could be\r\nobtained by those who were engaged in the same industries in other\r\ncities. As a result, the business of many persons and places suffered\r\ninjury, while the business of their rivals prospered through the\r\nadvantages given to them by the railroads.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these and other evils, various laws, beginning with\r\nthat of 1887, have been passed to control not only railroad and\r\nsteamboat lines, but also telegraph, telephone, express, and\r\nsleeping-car companies in so far as they are engaged in interstate and\r\nforeign commerce.\r\n\r\nSome provisions of these laws will now be stated, (1) Charges must be\r\njust and reasonable. The Interstate Commerce Commission has power to\r\ndecide what is reasonable, and to _fix rates,_ after an investigation.\r\n(2) It is unlawful to give one person or corporation a better rate than\r\nanother for the same service. This is called \"discrimination.\" Passes\r\ncannot be granted, except to employees. (3) All rates must be posted\r\nwhere they can be consulted by any person. (4) All companies engaged in\r\ninterstate commerce must open their books to inspection by the\r\ncommission and must make reports that they require. (5) If any person\r\nobjects to a decision of the commission, he may appeal to the Commerce\r\nCourt, which has been created to consider such cases.\r\n\r\nThe Control of Trusts.--Among the abuses arising in connection with\r\ninterstate commerce are those which result when persons enter into\r\nagreements or combinations to prevent free competition; for under these\r\ncircumstances prices are raised, or certain persons are favored in\r\ntrade. In 1890, Congress passed a law prohibiting such combinations \"in\r\nrestraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign\r\nnations.\" This is known as the Sherman Anti-trust Law.-Now, a trust is\r\nsimply a large corporation which has absorbed or killed off, more or\r\nless completely, other establishments engaged in the same industry. The\r\ntrust may or may not have a monopoly, that is, complete control in that\r\nline of business; and it may or may not be engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce. An agreement among certain, railroad companies to establish\r\nand maintain freight rates was declared to be in violation of the law of\r\n1890. Also, a combination, or \"conspiracy,\" among railroad employees to\r\nstop the running of trains was declared illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The \"trust problem,\" which is so prominent in current political\r\n     discussion, is the question of preventing the evils of combination\r\n     in industry. These evils become evident when excessive prices are\r\n     charged by persons who control certain lines of business; that is,\r\n     when free competition is prevented in the production,\r\n     transportation, or sale of commodities. If the business conducted\r\n     by a trust lies entirely within the limits of a single State's\r\n     boundaries, then it must be regulated by State law.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE MONEY of THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nOur National Currency.--Another of the most important powers of\r\nCongress is that granted in the following clause:--\r\n\r\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 5. _To coin money, regulate the value\r\nthereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and\r\nmeasures._\r\n\r\nIn civilized countries it is the practice of the government to furnish\r\nthe people a \"circulating medium\" for use in trade and commerce. Two\r\nkinds of money are in use in the United States: (1) coin or specie; and\r\n(2) paper money. The total amount of money in circulation in the United\r\nStates on November 1, 1910, was $3,124,679,057 or $35.01 _per capita_\r\nfor the whole population. We shall first consider the coins of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nHow Coins Are Made.--The coinage of money takes place at the mints,\r\nwhich are located at Philadelphia, Denver, New Orleans, and San\r\nFrancisco. Gold and silver come to the mints in the form of bricks, or\r\nrough bars, to which the term _bullion_ is applied. Alloy must be added\r\nto the pure metal for the purpose of rendering it of sufficient hardness\r\nto withstand wear. In our gold and silver coins one-tenth of the weight\r\nis an alloy composed of copper and nickel. A quantity of the bullion of\r\nthe required purity is first melted and then cast into ingots, or long\r\nbars. Each bar is next run between heavy rollers until it takes the form\r\nof a thin strip. From the strip are punched round pieces, called\r\n\"blanks,\" of the size and thickness of the coin that is being made. In\r\nthe next process the blank is weighed on a delicate balance; when found\r\nto be of the correct weight, the coin is placed in a powerful press, and\r\nfrom this it comes with its edge raised above the face and its edge\r\nmilled. In a similar press the designs are stamped upon the faces of the\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of the coins now being minted.\r\n\r\n\r\n              GOLD Coins.[27]\r\n\r\nDouble eagle                 Half-eagle\r\nEagle                        Quarter-eagle\r\n\r\n              SILVER COINS.\r\n\r\nStandard dollar              Quarter-dollar\r\nHalf-dollar                  Dime\r\n\r\n              MINOR COINS.\r\nFive-cent (nickel)           One-cent (bronze)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silver coins less in value than one dollar are called _subsidiary_\r\ncoins.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: No gold one-dollar pieces have been coined since 1890.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Ratio of Gold and Silver Coins.--The law fixes the weight\r\n     of pure metal in a silver dollar at 371.25 grains, troy weight, and\r\n     that of the pure metal in a gold dollar at 23.22 grains. The _ratio\r\n     _ of these weights is 15.988+: 1, or nearly 16:1. This indicates\r\n     the origin of the famous expression, \"sixteen to one.\"\r\n\r\n     Free Coinage.--By _free coinage _is meant a policy\r\n     established by law, under which any person may bring bullion to the\r\n     mint in any amount and have it coined; that is, the amount which\r\n     the government will coin is _unlimited_ by law. Our country has\r\n     always had the policy of free coinage with respect to gold. This\r\n     was also the policy in the coinage of our silver dollars until\r\n     1873. At that time the coinage of the silver dollar was\r\n     discontinued until a law was passed in 1878 (the Bland Act)\r\n     renewing its coinage, but in _limited_ quantities. The government\r\n     purchased silver bullion under this law, and under the Sherman Act\r\n     (1890), but since 1893 no silver bullion has been purchased for the\r\n     coinage of silver dollars, but the bullion already on hand has been\r\n     used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper Money.--We have in the United States five kinds of paper\r\nmoney in general circulation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       Kinds.                 Amounts in circulation, Nov. 1, 1910.\r\n1. United States notes                           $341,000,000\r\n2. Gold certificates                              836,000,000\r\n3. Silver certificates                            483,000,000\r\n4. National bank notes                            706,000,000\r\n5. Treasury notes of 1890                           3,500,000\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of United States Notes.--United States notes, or\r\n\"greenbacks,\" as they are commonly called, originated during the Civil\r\nWar. When the government was without specie (i.e., gold and silver\r\nmoney) with which to purchase supplies for the army and pay other\r\nexpenses, it issued these notes. Each note says on its face, \"The United\r\nStates will pay to bearer $----.\" Since no time was set for the\r\nfulfillment of this promise, and since there was neither gold nor silver\r\nin the Treasury with which to redeem the notes, people would naturally\r\nhesitate to accept them in payment for goods or salaries. Consequently,\r\nCongress made the notes \"legal tender\";[28] that is, the law compelled\r\ncreditors to receive this kind of money in payment for debts. The notes\r\npassed into circulation, therefore, because people were forced to take\r\nthem; but their value depreciated greatly during the war. In 1879 the\r\ngovernment began the redemption of the notes in specie, and since that\r\ntime they have been worth their face value.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Our full legal-tender coins at present are the gold coins,\r\nsilver dollars, United States notes, and Treasury notes of 1890.\r\nSubsidiary silver coins are legal tender in amounts not greater than\r\n$10.00, and the minor coins are legal tender to the amount of\r\ntwenty-five cents.]\r\n\r\nGold and Silver Certificates.--It is much more convenient to handle\r\npaper money than coins. When a person deposits gold or silver coin in\r\nthe Treasury, he may receive these certificates in exchange.\r\nConsequently, the value of these certificates in circulation represents\r\nan equal amount of gold coin and silver dollars stored in the United\r\nStates Treasury and ready for exchange for the certificates at any time.\r\n\r\nNational Bank Notes.--The fourth kind of paper money is issued by\r\nNational banks. These are organized under United States law and subject\r\nto control by an officer of the Treasury Department. Like banks that are\r\norganized under State law, National banks conduct the ordinary banking\r\noperations. That is, they receive deposits, loan money, and buy and sell\r\ndrafts in the ordinary course of business. In addition, these banks are\r\ngiven the right \"to issue notes.\" In doing this, the bank first buys on\r\nthe market a certain amount of United States bonds; these it sends to\r\nthe Treasury at Washington and leaves there on deposit. The bank will\r\nthen receive from the Treasury \"National bank notes\" equal in amount to\r\nthe face value of the bonds deposited. These notes say that \"The\r\nNational Bank of ---- will pay the bearer $----, on demand.\" Now, the\r\nbank may fail, i.e., it may not be able to pay what it owes to its\r\ndepositors and other creditors. But the holders of National bank notes\r\nwill not suffer loss. For the Treasury will sell the bonds and thus\r\nobtain cash with which it can redeem the notes held by individuals.\r\n\r\nThe amount of Treasury notes of 1890 is comparatively small, and this\r\nkind of money is destined to disappear within a few years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1. The tariff schedule in force at the present time may be found in\r\nnewspaper almanacs. Is this tariff high, low, or moderate in its rate?\r\n\r\n2.

POWER OF NATURALIZATION.\r\n\r\nWho Are Citizens.--Who are citizens of the United States is always\r\na question of interest. We find it clearly answered in the first clause\r\nof the Fourteenth Amendment as follows: _All persons born or naturalized\r\nin the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are\r\ncitizens of the United States, and of the States wherein they reside._\r\n\r\nThus there are two classes of citizens: (1) those who are citizens by\r\nbirth; (2) those who have been naturalized. Children born in this\r\ncountry, though of foreign parentage, and residing here, may be\r\nconsidered American citizens if they choose. According to an Act of\r\nCongress, passed in 1882, Chinese aliens may not be naturalized; but our\r\nSupreme Court has decided that a child born in the United States of\r\nChinese parents is a citizen, if he desires to be. Though born in a\r\nforeign country, a child whose father is an American citizen may claim\r\nthe privilege of American citizenship. Indians who keep their tribal\r\nrelations are not included under the provisions of this section.\r\n\r\nNaturalized Citizens.--The second class of citizens are those who\r\nare naturalized. That the rules should be uniform by which aliens\r\nbecome citizens, is self-evident. After a brief discussion, the\r\nConstitutional Convention provided in Section 8, Clause 4, that\r\n_Congress shall have the power to establish a uniform rule of\r\nnaturalization, and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies\r\nthroughout the United States._\r\n\r\nProcess of Naturalization.--(1) The foreigner desiring to become a\r\ncitizen goes before the clerk of any court of record and declares, \"upon\r\noath,\" that it is his intention to become a citizen of the United\r\nStates, and to renounce all allegiance to the government which has\r\njurisdiction over him. He then receives his \"first papers.\" (2) After he\r\nhas resided in the United States for five years, providing two years\r\nhave elapsed since his \"declaration of intention,\" he may secure his\r\ncertificate of naturalization. He must appear in open court and swear\r\nthat he will support the Constitution of the United States, and renounce\r\nall allegiance to any foreign power. Two witnesses must testify to his\r\nterm of residence, and declare that he is a man of good moral character.\r\nThe applicant must be able to speak the English language. His wife, and\r\nthose of his children who are under twenty-one years of age, become\r\ncitizens at the same time. In certain cases Congress has, by a single\r\nact, admitted large numbers of aliens to American citizenship, as it did\r\nat the time of the purchase of Louisiana, the annexation of Texas, and\r\nof Hawaii.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Bankrupt Laws.--It sometimes happens, because of general\r\n     depression in trade throughout the country, on account of losses,\r\n     or for other reasons, that business men become heavily involved in\r\n     debt. They are said to be insolvent. Now, it is but just that such\r\n     property as they have should be divided in some equitable way among\r\n     the creditors. A bankrupt law secures such a division, and the\r\n     debtor is, at the same time, freed from all legal obligation to pay\r\n     the debts which cannot be met in this way. The first law of\r\n     Congress on this subject was passed in 1802, and repealed in 1803.\r\n     Since that time there have been three other bankrupt laws, but the\r\n     total time during which they have been in force amounts only to\r\n     some twenty years. The last law, that of 1898, is still in\r\n     operation.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See \"Government in State and Nation,\" p. 193, for a\r\nfurther discussion of bankrupt laws--especially that of 1898.]\r\n\r\nSome States have also passed insolvency laws. However, these must not in\r\nany way conflict with the provisions of the National bankrupt laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE POSTAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nOrganization of the Post-office Department.--We can appreciate\r\nsomewhat the advancement made in the postal service rendered by the\r\ngovernment when we read that an Act of Congress in 1782 directed that\r\nmail should be carried \"at least once in each week from one office to\r\nanother.\" Our well-organized postal system, declared recently by the\r\nPostmaster-General to be the \"greatest business concern\" in the\r\nworld,[30] has been evolved through laws made in carrying out the\r\nprovision of the Constitution that _Congress shall have power to\r\nestablish post-offices and post-roads._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The total receipts of the Post-office Department for 1910\r\nwere $224,128,657.]\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the Postmaster-General, a member of the President's\r\nCabinet, is at the head of this department of government. One of the\r\nchief burdens of the Post-office Department was formerly the\r\nappointment of the so-called fourth-class postmasters, intrusted to the\r\nFourth Assistant Postmaster-General. Executive orders of Presidents\r\nRoosevelt and Taft placed 50,000, or about five-sevenths, of these\r\npostmasters in the _classified_ service. An order of President Wilson,\r\nin 1913, applied the _merit_ system to these offices, by which these\r\npostmasters were compelled to demonstrate their fitness for these\r\nappointments. This order included all fourth-class postmasters except\r\nthose paying less than $180 a year. The other three classes, in which\r\nare included those postmasters whose salaries are not less than $1000,\r\nare appointed by the President, with the consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Classes of Mail.--Mail matter belongs to one of four classes.\r\n     In general, the classes and rates are as follows: First\r\n     class--letters, two cents an ounce; second class--newspapers and\r\n     periodicals, one cent a pound; third class--books, one cent for two\r\n     ounces; and fourth class--merchandise, limited to four-pound\r\n     packages, one cent an ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\nFree Delivery.--Among the notable advances in the mail service was\r\nthe provision for the free distribution of mail in the cities of 10,000\r\ninhabitants, or where the annual postal receipts are $10,000 and above.\r\n\r\nRural Free Delivery.--No innovation in postal methods has been more\r\nsuccessful than the free delivery of mails in the country districts. The\r\ndevelopment of the system, since its establishment in 1897, has been\r\nremarkable.[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: According to the report of the superintendent for the year\r\nending June 30, 1910, 41,079 routes had been established. The rural\r\npopulation receiving daily mail service amounted to more than\r\n18,000,000. Two thousand one hundred and twenty-four new rural routes\r\nwere authorized in 1911, aggregating 51,230 miles in length. President\r\nTaft urged a further extension of the system.]\r\n\r\nAmong the good effects resulting from its extensive introduction may be\r\nmentioned the following: (1) Correspondence in the communities affected\r\nhas increased. (2) The circulation of the daily newspaper and of\r\nperiodical literature has been greatly enlarged, and interest has grown\r\nin public affairs. (3) Good roads have been multiplied, for they are\r\nmade one of the conditions for the introduction of the service. (4)\r\nBecause the country districts are brought into daily communication with\r\nthe centres of population, the tendency to quit the farm for the town\r\nhas been lessened and thus rural free delivery is helping, in some\r\ndegree, to solve one of the problems of our social and industrial life.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Postal Savings-Banks.--At various times bills have been before\r\n     Congress providing for the establishment of postal savings-banks in\r\n     connection with post-offices. It is proposed that they shall\r\n     receive small amounts on deposit, paying a low rate of interest,\r\n     and that the funds secured be invested in government bonds. A law\r\n     was passed in 1910 which provided for the establishment of postal\r\n     savings-banks. The plan has proved a success.\r\n\r\n     Some of the Defects in Our Postal System.--(1) For thirty\r\n     years prior to 1911 there has been an annual deficit of several\r\n     million dollars. This was caused largely through the transportation\r\n     of second-class matter, so-called periodical publications. But in\r\n     1911 there was a postal surplus of nearly $220,000, which was due\r\n     largely to more business-like methods in management. That this is\r\n     an unjust drain upon the public funds is clear, when we consider\r\n     that, in a recent year, the government expended $17,277,783 more\r\n     than it received for carrying second-class mail. (2) Another\r\n     serious defect has existed in the payment of exorbitant rates to\r\n     railroad companies for carrying the mails. (3) Some Congressmen\r\n     abuse the privilege granted them of sending government publications\r\n     free. (4) The postal system has offered one of the best fields for\r\n     the manipulation of the spoilsman. Postmasters have been usually\r\n     appointed on the recommendation of representatives, and, too\r\n     frequently, the one essential to securing an office is that the\r\n     applicant must be influential in politics.\r\n\r\n     Parcels Post.--On January 1, 1913, a far-reaching innovation\r\n     was put into operation by the Post-office Department. The\r\n     parcels-post system was used for the first time. Bills providing\r\n     for such a system had been introduced into Congress, but failed to\r\n     pass owing largely to the opposition of express companies and other\r\n     common carriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS.\r\n\r\nCopyrights and Patents.--Section 8, Clause 8. _To promote the\r\nprogress of science and useful arts, by securing, for limited times, to\r\nauthors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings\r\nand discoveries._\r\n\r\nThe development of American literature has been greatly aided through\r\nthe operation of laws based on this clause. Copyrights are secured from\r\nthe Librarian of Congress. Any person obtaining a copyright has the sole\r\nright to print, copy, or sell the book, chart, engraving, music, etc.,\r\nfor a period of twenty-eight years. A copyright may be renewed for\r\nfourteen years longer. It may be sold or transferred providing a record\r\nof the transfer be made in the office of the Librarian of Congress\r\nwithin sixty days.\r\n\r\nPatents.--Americans have been rightly named the great inventors of\r\nthe world. Not a little of our marvelous industrial progress has been\r\ndue to this inventive ability. The government has contributed to the\r\nsame end, through the enactment of laws protecting those inventors who\r\nsecure patents. A person desiring a patent must declare upon oath, in\r\nhis petition addressed to the Commissioner of Patents, that he believes\r\nhimself to be the first inventor of the article for which he solicits a\r\npatent. The sum of fifteen dollars is charged for filing the\r\napplication, and twenty dollars for issuing the patent. A patent is\r\ngranted for seventeen years, but may be extended for seven years more.\r\nDuring this period, the patentee has the exclusive right to manufacture,\r\nsell, or transfer his invention.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: In the year 1910, 37,421 patents were granted by our\r\ngovernment.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. MILITARY POWERS IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nSection 8, Clauses 11, 12, 13, 14. _To declare war, grant letters of\r\nmarque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTo raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use\r\nshall be for a longer term than two years.\r\n\r\nTo provide and maintain a navy.\r\n\r\nTo make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval\r\nforces._\r\n\r\nThe Army.--Americans are always impressed by the military spirit so\r\nprevalent in European nations. Compared with the standing army of\r\nGermany, which has some 700,000 men, and with that of Russia, containing\r\n1,000,000 men, or with that of most European nations, our army is\r\ninsignificant in size. According to a law of 1901, the army of the\r\nUnited States cannot contain more than 100,000 men.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: The minimum number of men was fixed at 57,000. In 1908,\r\nthe number of officers and men in the army was 72,628.]\r\n\r\nFortunately, there has always existed in the United States the desire to\r\nkeep the standing army from becoming unduly large. The Constitution\r\nitself indicates that appropriations for the army shall not be for a\r\nlonger time than two years. At the end of this period, the people may\r\ncheck the growth of the army through the election of representatives\r\nopposed thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Officers and Classification of the Army.--The President is,\r\n     _ex officio_, commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United\r\n     States. The office of general was created, by Congress, March 3,\r\n     1799, but was not filled. It was revived in 1866 for General Grant,\r\n     General Sherman succeeding to the title in 1869. The same rank was\r\n     bestowed on General Sheridan in 1888. The lieutenant-general is\r\n     next in rank to the general. The army is distributed geographically\r\n     as follows: Division of the Philippines and the Departments of\r\n     California, of the Colorado, of the Columbia, of Dakota, of the\r\n     East, of the Lakes, of the Missouri, and of Texas. The division is\r\n     in charge of a major-general, and the departments are each in\r\n     charge of a major-general or of a brigadier-general. The commands\r\n     which correspond to each grade are: major-general, four regiments;\r\n     brigadier-general, two regiments; colonel, one regiment;\r\n     lieutenant-colonel or major, a battalion or squadron; captain, a\r\n     company. As now organized, infantry regiments consist of 12\r\n     companies, of 65 men each. Cavalry regiments contain 12 troops,\r\n     each having 65 enlisted men.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Navy.--We are told by competent authorities that one of our\r\nbest means of preserving peace with foreign powers is to maintain a\r\nstrong navy. This has become much more necessary since the United States\r\nhas begun to acquire insular possessions. Although the construction of\r\nthe modern American navy was not begun until 1883, there has been a\r\nnotable advance within the past few years. In 1910 it was estimated that\r\nour navy is excelled in strength only by that of Great Britain.\r\nCongress, in 1910, continued the policy of \"adequate preparation\" by\r\nauthorizing the construction of two battle-ships a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Names of Vessels.--A ship of the first class is given the name\r\n     of a State; one of the second class that of a principal city or\r\n     river, and the names for ships of the third class are selected by\r\n     the President. The navy now contains 312 vessels.\r\n\r\n     Officers in the Navy.--The titles admiral and vice-admiral,\r\n     corresponding to the grades of general and lieutenant-general in\r\n     the army, were created by act of Congress to be bestowed on the\r\n     following men as recognition for distinguished services during the\r\n     Civil War: Admirals Farragut and Porter; and Vice-Admirals\r\n     Farragut, Porter, and Rowan. Admiral Dewey was granted his title by\r\n     a special Act of Congress after the Battle of Manila. The officers\r\n     of the navy ranking with major-generals, brigadier-generals,\r\n     colonels, and so on, in the army, are rear-admirals, commodores,\r\n     captains, commanders, lieutenant-commanders, lieutenants, masters,\r\n     ensigns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Militia.--With but little opposition in the Constitutional\r\nConvention, Congress was given the power to make provision for\r\ncitizen-soldiers as follows:--\r\n\r\nSection 8, Clause 15. _To provide for calling forth the militia to\r\nexecute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel\r\ninvasions._\r\n\r\nClause 16. _To provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the\r\nmilitia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the\r\nservice of the United States, reserving to the States respectively the\r\nappointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia\r\naccording to the discipline prescribed by Congress._\r\n\r\nNumber of the Militia.--All able-bodied male citizens of the United\r\nStates and males between eighteen and forty-five years of age who have\r\ndeclared their intention to become citizens are regarded as the militia\r\nforce of the country. As a matter of fact, there are at present only\r\nabout 100,000 men enrolled in this service. But in the case of an\r\nemergency the President may compel the governors of the various States\r\nto furnish the troops needed. The militia may thus be called into\r\nservice, under their own State officers, for a period of nine months.\r\nThe War of 1812 and the Civil War furnish the best illustrations of the\r\nenforcement of this provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Volunteers of 1898.--We should note here the manner in which\r\n     men were secured for the war against Spain. We see, according to\r\n     Clause 15, that the militia may be called out only for the purposes\r\n     of executing the laws of the Union, suppressing insurrections, and\r\n     repelling invasions. Now, in the case given, the war was to be\r\n     conducted in foreign territory, and President McKinley called for\r\n     200,000 volunteers. It was understood, however, that preference\r\n     would be given to those volunteers who were already members of the\r\n     organized militia.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. LOCATION OF THE CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 8, Clause 17. _Congress shall have the power to exercise\r\nexclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district (not\r\nexceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States and\r\nthe acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the\r\nUnited States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased\r\nby the consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall\r\nbe, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards and other\r\nneedful buildings._\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting contests in American history arose in the\r\nselection of a site for the capital city. Congress finally accepted, for\r\nthis purpose, one hundred square miles of land on the Potomac River,\r\nwhich was ceded by Maryland and Virginia. The thirty square miles given\r\nby Virginia were afterward returned to that State. The capital was to be\r\nin New York until 1790, then in Philadelphia until 1800. In 1800 it was\r\ntransferred to the new district, called the District of Columbia.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: For the government of this district, see \"Government in\r\nState and Nation,\" p. 204.]\r\n\r\nVI. IMPLIED POWERS.\r\n\r\nStrict and Loose Construction.--Our national development has been,\r\nin large measure, dependent on the interpretation of the next clause of\r\nthe Constitution. It is often called the elastic clause.\r\n\r\nSection 8, Clause 18. _To make all laws which shall be necessary and\r\nproper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other\r\npowers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United\r\nStates or in any department or officer thereof._\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, the problem has always been, Has Congress the right to\r\nexercise powers not definitely granted by the Constitution? Alexander\r\nHamilton first set forth the doctrine of _implied_ powers. He urged that\r\nCongress might, in carrying out specific powers, use methods not\r\n_expressly_ provided for in the Constitution, as in the creation of a\r\nbank or mint. Since the time of this interpretation, which, fortunately\r\nfor American interests, was sanctioned by Washington and later by the\r\nSupreme Court through its great Chief-Justice John Marshall, the\r\nadvocates of the doctrines of strict and loose construction have\r\ncontended for their principles. Does the Constitution permit the\r\nacquisition of territory? May Congress establish a protective tariff, or\r\na system of internal improvements? We have here but three of the great\r\nquestions which have led to a definition of these opposing views.\r\nSpeaking in general terms, the party in power has favored loose\r\nconstruction, while the party out of power has advocated strict\r\nconstruction. Said Mr. Bryce, \"The Americans have more than once bent\r\ntheir Constitution in order that they might not be forced to break\r\nit.\"[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Bryce, \"American Commonwealth,\" I, 390.]\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

If, after such\r\ninquiry, it is found that the person is detained for insufficient cause,\r\nhe is granted his freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n     President Lincoln and the Writ of Habeas Corpus.--President\r\n     Lincoln, as a military necessity, in 1861, suspended the privilege\r\n     of the writ over a limited area, constituting a large part of the\r\n     State of Maryland. The Supreme Court, however, declared his order\r\n     non-effective, maintaining that the right of suspending the writ of\r\n     _habeas corpus_ lay with Congress, though it might be granted to\r\n     the President. This attempt on the part of the Supreme Court to\r\n     restrain Mr. Lincoln was a failure, and shows that even the highest\r\n     of our tribunals may not have its usual power in time of war. It\r\n     was not until March 3, 1863, that Congress made the decree of\r\n     President Lincoln legal by authorizing him to suspend the writ\r\n     whenever he believed the public safety demanded it. In September of\r\n     that year he declared the suspension general throughout the\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n\r\nEx Post Facto Laws.--Clause 3. _No bill of attainder or ex post\r\nfacto laws shall be passed._\r\n\r\nAn ex post facto law, as defined by the Supreme Court, is a \"law which\r\nrenders an act punishable in a manner in which it was not punishable\r\nwhen it was committed.\" It applies to acts of a criminal nature\r\nonly.[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Clause 4 is discussed under National Finances, p. 84.]\r\n\r\nCare of Public Money.--Clause 7. _No money shall be drawn from the\r\nTreasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law; and a\r\nregular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all\r\npublic money shall be published from time to time._\r\n\r\nIt is proper in a government such as ours that the control of the public\r\nmoney should be lodged with the representatives of the people. Through\r\nthe annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury, the people may know\r\nfrom what sources our revenues are derived and for what purposes the\r\nmoney is expended.\r\n\r\nTitles of Nobility and Gifts.--Clause 8. _No title of nobility\r\nshall be granted by the United States; and no person holding any office\r\nof profit or trust under them shall, without the consent of the\r\nCongress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind\r\nwhatever from any king, prince, or foreign state._\r\n\r\nAccording to the wording of the clause, Congress may allow gifts, of the\r\nkind mentioned, to be accepted by our National officials. Usually,\r\nhowever, such gifts pass into the keeping of government.\r\n\r\nPowers Denied the States.--We recall the power of the States and\r\nweakness of the general government under the Articles of Confederation.\r\nIt was plain to the members of the Constitutional Convention that\r\nhopeless confusion would arise if the States should also be given the\r\nright to coin money, pass ex post facto laws, etc. Therefore, certain\r\nprohibitions were made on the powers of the States. In Section 10,\r\nClause 1, we note that these prohibitions are absolute, as:--\r\n\r\n_No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance or confederation; grant\r\nletters of marque and reprisal, coin money, emit bills of credit; make\r\nanything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any\r\nbill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts, or grant any title of nobility._[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: In the celebrated Dartmouth College case, it was finally\r\ndetermined that a State legislature may not modify the terms of a\r\ncontract. See Life of John Marshall, by Magruder, \"American Statesmen,\"\r\nnew ed., 188-190.]\r\n\r\nIn Section 10, Clauses 2 and 3, the prohibitions are only conditional;\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n_No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any impost or\r\nduties on imports or exports except what may be absolutely necessary\r\nfor executing its inspection laws; and the net produce of all duties and\r\nimposts laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the use of\r\nthe Treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be subject to\r\nthe revision and control of the Congress.\r\n\r\nNo State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of\r\ntonnage, keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any\r\nagreement or compact with another State or with a foreign power, or\r\nengage in war, unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as\r\nwill not admit of delay._\r\n\r\nMore Complete Protection of Personal Rights.--By a careful reading\r\nof Sections 9 and 10, it is seen that some of the rights of the\r\nindividual are guarded against encroachment on the part of government,\r\neither National or State. But the people felt that there were other\r\npersonal rights which needed protection. They were familiar with the\r\nbills of rights in their own State constitutions. That the National\r\nConstitution did not also contain a bill of rights was, as we have seen,\r\none of the chief arguments made against its adoption in the State\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nThe First Ten Amendments.--A large number of propositions,\r\ntherefore, were submitted to the first Congress by the States. Seventeen\r\nof these were selected by the House of Representatives, and proposed as\r\namendments to the Constitution. Twelve of these were acceptable to the\r\nSenate also, and ten were ratified by the required three-fourths of the\r\nState legislatures. We call them the first ten amendments to the\r\nConstitution. If we read these amendments, we shall find that really\r\nthey are a bill of rights, for the preservation or protection of rights\r\nof the people is expressed in all.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: See Appendix A.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe President and His Election.--We have seen that the one great\r\nweakness of the government under the confederation was that there\r\nexisted no adequate executive. After much discussion in the convention,\r\nthe fear of a despot at the head of affairs gave place to the desire to\r\nsecure executive energy and responsibility. To-day the President is the\r\nmost notable personage among all our officials. Mr. Bryce calls the\r\nPresidential office the greatest office in the world unless we except\r\nthe papacy. In the Executive Department the President's power is\r\npractically absolute. He may appoint and remove, either directly or\r\nindirectly, all officials of the department, and they are finally\r\nresponsible to him in the performance of their duties. His control of\r\ninternational relations and his influence on legislation are, as we\r\nshall see, extensive.\r\n\r\nLength of Term.--Article II, Section 1, Clause 1. _The executive\r\npower shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He\r\nshall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with\r\nthe Vice-President, chosen for the same term, be elected as follows:_--\r\n\r\nMethod of Election.--How shall the President be chosen? This\r\nproblem is said to have taken one-seventh of the entire time of the\r\nconvention. While there were those who believed that election by the\r\npeople would be wise, still this sentiment was not general. It was\r\nthought that a choice in this way would cause great \"tumult and\r\ndisorder.\" Besides, it was urged that the people would not be\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the men who have the necessary\r\nqualifications for such high office. For a special investigation of this\r\nsort, they agreed that it would be best to select a small number of\r\npersons who would be most likely to possess the required information and\r\ndiscernment. The appointment of these independent electors was provided\r\nfor as follows:--\r\n\r\nAppointment of Electors.--Section 1, Clause 2. _Each State shall\r\nappoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number\r\nof electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to\r\nwhich the State may be entitled in the Congress; but no senator or\r\nrepresentative or person holding an office of trust or profit under the\r\nUnited States, shall be appointed an elector._\r\n\r\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 3. _The Congress may determine the time of\r\nchoosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes,\r\nwhich day shall be the same throughout the United States._\r\n\r\nAt present, the appointment of electors is a necessary but a\r\ncomparatively unimportant step in the election of a President.\r\n\r\nThe real power exists in the National conventions of the great political\r\nparties. Instead of exercising the right of free choice, as they were\r\noriginally expected to do, the electors are really bound to vote for\r\ncandidates nominated in these conventions. Let us consider, then, some\r\nof the chief points in the history and practical working of National\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Early Methods of Nominating.--Like the development of other\r\n     political usages, the method of nominating a President passed\r\n     through several stages before the present plan of nominating\r\n     conventions was reached. No nominations were made in the first two\r\n     Presidential elections. In 1796, Washington having refused to be a\r\n     candidate for a third term, party managers in Congress agreed\r\n     informally on Adams and Jefferson as the candidates of the\r\n     Federalist and the Republican parties respectively. A caucus of\r\n     Federalist Congressmen, in 1800, nominated Adams and Pinckney, and\r\n     a caucus of Republican Congressmen nominated Jefferson and Burr,\r\n     for the offices of President and Vice-President. The Republican\r\n     members of Congress continued to hold a regular caucus and thus to\r\n     direct the votes of the party electors until 1824. In that year\r\n     William H. Crawford, the last Congressional nominee, was defeated.\r\n     There was opposition to the Congressional caucus from the\r\n     beginning, for such a method was regarded as undemocratic. In 1824\r\n     and 1828 the several State legislatures put forward their favorites\r\n     for the office of President.\r\n\r\n     Development of National Conventions.--As early as 1812, De\r\n     Witt Clinton was nominated as the candidate of the Federalists in a\r\n     convention held in New York City, made up of seventy delegates, who\r\n     represented eleven States. But the National nominating convention,\r\n     as we know it, was used for the first time by the Anti-Masonic\r\n     party, which selected William Wirt for its candidate in 1831. This\r\n     method was followed in the same year by the National Republican\r\n     party, which nominated Henry Clay. The National convention of the\r\n     Democratic party in 1832 nominated Andrew Jackson, who had already\r\n     been nominated by many local conventions and State legislatures.\r\n     Many years elapsed before the present complex organization was\r\n     reached, but since 1836, with the single exception of the Whig\r\n     party in that year, parties have regarded the National convention\r\n     as an essential factor in electing President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\n     Prior to the nominations for the Presidency in 1912, the usual plan\r\n     was to select two delegates to the National convention from each of\r\n     the Congressional districts, and also four delegates at large. The\r\n     district delegates were chosen in the district conventions of the\r\n     different parties, and the delegates at large in State conventions.\r\n     In some of the States all of the delegates were selected in the\r\n     State conventions.\r\n\r\n     It now seems probable before another Presidential election that\r\n     some form of the _direct primary_ will be in use in all of the\r\n     States. The growth of sentiment in favor of the selection of\r\n     delegates to the National convention by the direct primary has been\r\n     most remarkable. Oregon, California, Nebraska, New Jersey, North\r\n     Dakota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, and\r\n     Michigan passed such primary laws prior to the election of 1912.\r\n     Pennsylvania had a modified primary law, and in a number of other\r\n     States there were voluntary primaries.\r\n\r\n     Election of Delegates to the National Conventions.--The\r\n     National conventions of the Republican and the Democratic parties\r\n     are made up of twice as many delegates from the different States as\r\n     these States have representatives and senators in Congress.\r\n\r\n     The National Convention.--The National convention is held in\r\n     some leading city during the month of June or July of the year in\r\n     which a President is to be elected. A few days before the time set\r\n     for the convention, the delegates, together with many thousands of\r\n     politicians and sight-seers, flock to that city. Headquarters are\r\n     established and delegates are interviewed on behalf of the\r\n     different candidates. On the day appointed, the convention is\r\n     called to order by the chairman of the National committee, under\r\n     whose auspices the convention is to be held. A temporary chairman\r\n     is elected, and clerks and secretaries are appointed. Committees\r\n     are also appointed, the most important being those on credentials\r\n     and on resolutions. Each State delegation selects one of its\r\n     members for each of the committees. In the next session, a\r\n     permanent chairman is usually selected, and the committee on\r\n     resolutions presents its report, which sets forth the platform\r\n     embodying party doctrines and principles. Nominations are then in\r\n     order. The roll of States is called, and the various delegations\r\n     place before the convention the favorite of their State. A State\r\n     often waives its privilege in behalf of some other State which has\r\n     a candidate to present. Again the clerk calls the roll of the\r\n     States, and each chairman of a delegation announces the votes from\r\n     his State. In the Republican convention a majority of the number of\r\n     delegates voting is sufficient to nominate; but no nomination is\r\n     possible in the Democratic convention except by a vote of\r\n     two-thirds of the delegates. Then follows the selection of a\r\n     candidate for Vice-President. In this choice the attempt is made to\r\n     secure some man who will add strength to the party, and who comes\r\n     from a different section of the country from that represented by\r\n     the candidate for the Presidency. He may, as in the cases of Tyler\r\n     and Johnson, represent a faction of the party that is not in entire\r\n     agreement with the majority.\r\n\r\n     The National Committee.--A National committee is also\r\n     appointed, made up of one member from each State, who is nominated\r\n     by the State delegation. The wishes of the Presidential candidate\r\n     are of influence in the choice of the chairman, who need not be a\r\n     member of the convention. The committee occupies a position of\r\n     great importance, for by it the platform of the party is largely\r\n     determined. We have here a body of men not mentioned by the\r\n     Constitution, but exerting vastly greater influence upon the\r\n     election of President than does the electoral college itself. It\r\n     organizes the campaign, secures money, selects speakers, and sends\r\n     out party literature. The committee looks after the interests of\r\n     the party during the ensuing four years and issues the call for the\r\n     next National convention.\r\n\r\n\r\nElection of Electors.--We are now ready to consider the place of\r\nthe electors in the choice of a President. The nominations of candidates\r\nfor the office of elector are usually made at the State conventions of\r\nthe different parties when State tickets are nominated. These occur,\r\nordinarily, in August or September preceding the November election.\r\nEach political party nominates as many electors as the State has\r\nsenators and representatives in Congress. The names of the electors are\r\nthen placed on the general party ticket, on which appear also the names\r\nof the candidates for President and Vice-President; each person then\r\nvotes for the entire number of electors to which his State is entitled,\r\nand will naturally vote for all the electors on his party ticket. The\r\npolitical party, therefore, which receives the majority of votes in a\r\nState secures all the electoral votes of that State.[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: It has sometimes happened, however, when the election in a\r\nState has been close, that one or more of the electors on a minority\r\nticket have run ahead of the other candidates on that ticket, and have\r\nsecured a larger number of votes than candidates on the majority ticket,\r\nthus obtaining an election. California, in 1892, gave one electoral vote\r\nto Mr. Harrison and eight to Mr. Cleveland, and again, in 1896, gave\r\neight votes to Mr. McKinley and one to Mr. Bryan. Kentucky, in 1896, cast\r\ntwelve votes for Mr. McKinley and one for Mr. Bryan.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Vacancies in the Offices of Electors.--Congress enacted in\r\n     1845 that each State might provide, by law, for the filling of\r\n     vacancies in the electoral college, and that if any State failed to\r\n     choose electors on the regular day, that they might be appointed on\r\n     a later day in such manner as the State might, by law, direct.\r\n     Nearly all of the State legislatures have conferred on the college\r\n     itself the power of filling vacancies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunction of Electors.--The steps prescribed by the Constitution\r\nmust still be followed, although we know, long before the electors cast\r\ntheir votes, who the next President will be. The actual function of the\r\nelectors is given in Amendment XII, as follows:--\r\n\r\n_The electors shall meet in their respective States and vote by ballot\r\nfor President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an\r\ninhabitant of the same State with themselves; they shall name in their\r\nballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the\r\nperson voted for as Vice-President; and they shall make distinct lists\r\nof all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as\r\nVice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they\r\nshall sign, and certify, and transmit, sealed, to the seat of government\r\nof the United States, directed to the President of the Senate;--the\r\nPresident of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then\r\nbe counted;--the person having the greatest number of votes for\r\nPresident shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the\r\nwhole number of electors appointed; and if no person have such majority,\r\nthen, from the persons having the highest numbers, not exceeding three,\r\non the list of those voted for as President, the House of\r\nRepresentatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But\r\nin choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the\r\nrepresentation from each State having one vote; a quorum for this\r\npurpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the\r\nStates, and a majority of the States shall be necessary to a choice. And\r\nif the House of Representatives shall not choose a President, whenever\r\nthe right to choose shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of\r\nMarch next following, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as\r\nin the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the\r\nPresident.--The person having the greatest number of votes as\r\nVice-President shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority\r\nof the whole number of electors appointed; and if no person have a\r\nmajority, then, from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate\r\nshall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist\r\nof two-thirds of the whole number of senators, and a majority of the\r\nwhole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person\r\nconstitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible\r\nto that of Vice-President of the United States._\r\n\r\nVoting of the Electors.--The formal election of President takes\r\nplace on the second Monday in January, when the electors meet at their\r\nvarious State capitals and cast their votes. Separate ballots are given\r\nfor Vice-President. Three separate sealed lists of the results are then\r\nprepared. Two of these are sent to the President of the Senate, one by\r\nmail and the other by special messenger. The third is deposited with the\r\nUnited States district judge of the district in which the electors meet.\r\nOn the second Wednesday in February the votes are opened by the\r\nPresident of the Senate, in the presence of the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, and counted. That person having a majority of the\r\nelectoral votes case for President is declared to be duly elected. The\r\none who has a majority of the electoral votes cast for Vice-President is\r\nalso elected to that office.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Election of President by the House of Representatives.--In\r\n     case no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral\r\n     votes, the election goes to the House of Representatives, as is\r\n     provided in the amendment we are considering. Here the three\r\n     candidates having the highest number of votes are alone considered.\r\n     The voting is by States. In 1825 John Quincy Adams was elected\r\n     President in this way. He had fewer popular and fewer electoral\r\n     votes than Andrew Jackson, but he received the votes of thirteen\r\n     out of twenty-four States in the House.\r\n\r\n     Choice of Vice-President by the Senate.--The Senate is called\r\n     on to select the Vice-President in case no candidate has received a\r\n     majority of the electoral votes. The two candidates having the\r\n     highest number of votes are considered. The only instance of the\r\n     election of a Vice-President in this way occurred in 1837.\r\n\r\n     Disputed Returns, Election of 1876.--Disputes have arisen,\r\n     from time to time, over some of the returns of the electoral votes.\r\n     The most notable contest was that over the returns from Florida,\r\n     Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon, in 1877. If the twenty-one\r\n     electoral votes from these States should be counted for the\r\n     Republican candidates, they would be elected. Should just one of\r\n     those votes be given to the Democratic nominees, the Republicans\r\n     would lose the election. Now the Senate at this time was\r\n     Republican, and the House Democratic, and therefore no\r\n     satisfactory adjustment could be reached, because of party\r\n     prejudices. The excitement throughout the country was finally\r\n     relieved by the agreement on the part of both houses to refer the\r\n     decision to an \"Electoral Commission.\"\r\n\r\n     This commission consisted of five judges of the Supreme Court, five\r\n     representatives, and five senators. After examining the returns,\r\n     the commission decided, March 2, 1877, by a vote of eight to seven,\r\n     that Hayes and Wheeler, the Republican candidates, had received the\r\n     twenty-one votes in dispute, thus giving them one hundred and\r\n     eighty-five electoral votes, and that Tilden and Hendricks, the\r\n     Democratic candidates, had received one hundred and eighty-four\r\n     electoral votes.\r\n\r\n     In consequence of the grave problem which arose in 1877, Congress\r\n     passed an act February 3, 1887, which provides that any contest in\r\n     the choice of electors in a State must be decided by the State\r\n     authorities under the laws of the State.\r\n\r\n     The Original Method of Choosing the President.--Because\r\n     Presidents Washington, Adams, and Jefferson for his first term,\r\n     were chosen by the plan given in the original clause, let us\r\n     notice, briefly, the method used at that time, and especially the\r\n     reasons for the change to the present plan.\r\n\r\n     Section 1, Clause 2. _The electors shall meet in their respective\r\n     States, and vote by ballot for two persons, one of whom, at least,\r\n     shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And\r\n     they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the\r\n     number of votes for each; which list they sign and certify, and\r\n     transmit, sealed, to the seat of the government of the United\r\n     States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of\r\n     the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of\r\n     Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall\r\n     then be counted. The person then having the greatest number of\r\n     votes shall be President, if such number be a majority of the whole\r\n     number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who\r\n     have such a majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the\r\n     House of Representatives shall immediately choose, by ballot, one\r\n     of them for President; and if no person have a majority, then, from\r\n     the five highest on the list, the said House shall, in like manner,\r\n     choose the President. But in choosing the President, the votes\r\n     shall be taken by States, the representation from each State having\r\n     one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or\r\n     members from two-thirds of the States, and a majority of all the\r\n     States be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of\r\n     the President, the person having the greatest number of votes of\r\n     the electors shall be the Vice-President. But if there should\r\n     remain two or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose\r\n     from them, by ballot, the Vice-President._\r\n\r\n     According to this clause, we note that the electors voted for two\r\n     persons without stating which was to be President and which\r\n     Vice-President. In the official count, the candidate receiving the\r\n     highest number of votes, provided it was a majority of the whole\r\n     number of the electoral votes, became President, and the one\r\n     receiving the next highest became Vice-President.\r\n\r\n     Election of 1796.--In the election of 1796, John Adams, who\r\n     received the highest number, seventy-one, out of one hundred and\r\n     thirty-two electoral votes, was elected President. Thomas\r\n     Jefferson, his opponent, became Vice-President, having received\r\n     sixty-eight votes, or the next highest number. Thus there were\r\n     elected a President of one party and a Vice-President of the\r\n     opposing party.\r\n\r\n     Election of 1800.--The election of 1800 also showed the plan\r\n     to be impracticable. At this time, the Democratic-Republican party\r\n     was determined to have Mr. Jefferson for President and Aaron Burr\r\n     for Vice-President. They both received seventy-three votes, a\r\n     majority of all the votes. But since the number was equal, it\r\n     devolved upon the House of Representatives to determine whether\r\n     Jefferson or Burr should be President. For seven days the House was\r\n     in continuous session, and civil war threatened. On the\r\n     thirty-sixth ballot, however, Jefferson received the votes of ten\r\n     States out of sixteen, and was elected.\r\n\r\n     In order to prevent a recurrence of the conditions which obtained\r\n     in 1796, or of the dangers incident to a contest like that of 1800,\r\n     the Twelfth Amendment was proposed by Congress, and, after\r\n     ratification, was declared in force September 25, 1804. This\r\n     provides, as we have seen, that the electoral votes must be cast\r\n     separately for President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\n     The Presidential Term.--Shall the President hold office for a\r\n     term of three years, of seven years, or during good behavior? These\r\n     were questions of great interest in the Constitutional Convention.\r\n     A term of seven years with no re-election was agreed upon, but\r\n     toward the end of the convention the clause as given was adopted.\r\n\r\n     Re-election of a President.--The Constitution does not limit\r\n     the number of terms for which a President may be chosen, but the\r\n     \"third-term tradition\" has now made it practically impossible for\r\n     the same man to be elected for more than two terms. This custom was\r\n     inaugurated by the refusal of President Washington to accept a\r\n     third term. President Jefferson was also urged to stand for a third\r\n     term, but he, too, preferred to retire to private life as\r\n     Washington had done. The adherents of General Grant strove to break\r\n     down this precedent in 1880 but were defeated. Although President\r\n     Roosevelt had served a part of a term and one full term the\r\n     argument of a third term was brought against him.\r\n\r\n     A Longer Term.--It is frequently urged that the Constitution\r\n     should be amended in such a manner as to provide for a term of six\r\n     or seven years for the President, with no re-election. Among the\r\n     reasons for this change are the following: (1) a new President has\r\n     most of his time, for months, at the beginning of his term,\r\n     consumed in hearing the claims of applicants for office, and in\r\n     making appointments; (2) there is danger that he may be influenced\r\n     in his official actions through desire to secure a second term; (3)\r\n     the commercial depression that usually exists during a campaign\r\n     would thus come less frequently. These arguments may be used in\r\n     opposition to such a change: (1) in the case of an inefficient\r\n     President, the short term is to be preferred; (2) the Presidential\r\n     campaign is of value, in that the attention of Americans generally\r\n     is for a time fixed on the problems connected with the conduct of\r\n     our government. It furnishes the opportunity for imparting to our\r\n     citizens many lessons in their political education.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualifications for President and Vice-President.--The\r\nqualifications for President and Vice-President are naturally the same,\r\nand are as follows:--\r\n\r\nSection 1, Clause 4. _No person, except a natural-born citizen, or a\r\ncitizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this\r\nConstitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither\r\nshall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained\r\nto the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident\r\nwithin the United States._\r\n\r\nVacancies.--The chief reason for creating the office of\r\nVice-President seems to have been to provide for the emergency of a\r\nvacancy in the Presidency.\r\n\r\nSection 1, Clause 5. _In case of the removal of the President from\r\noffice or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the\r\npowers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the\r\nVice-President, and the Congress may, by law, provide for the case of\r\nremoval, death, resignation, or inability both of the President and\r\nVice-President, declaring what officer shall then act as President, and\r\nsuch officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or\r\na President shall be elected._\r\n\r\nPresidential Succession.--In 1886 Congress provided that in case of the\r\ndeath, resignation, or disability[41] of both President and\r\nVice-President, the succession should be in the following order:\r\nSecretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War,\r\nAttorney-General, Postmaster-General, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary\r\nof the Interior. The Secretary of Agriculture was added in 1889.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: What constitutes disability has not been settled.\r\nPresident Garfield performed only the single executive act of signing an\r\nextradition paper from July 2 to September 19, 1881. The fact of his\r\ninability to discharge the duties of President was not formally\r\nestablished. Nor was there declared disability in the case of President\r\nMcKinley, between September 6 and the day of his death, September 14,\r\n1901.]\r\n\r\nSalary of the President.--Section I, Clause 6. _The President shall, at\r\nstated times, receive for his services a compensation, which shall\r\nneither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he may\r\nhave been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other\r\nemolument from the United States or any of them._\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the salary of the President was changed from $50,000 to $75,000\r\na year. The custom has been established that no President shall receive\r\na gift from any civil body, such as a city council, a State legislature,\r\nor a foreign state. In addition to his salary, the President is provided\r\nwith an \"executive mansion,\" the \"White House,\" which is furnished at\r\nthe expense of the government. The Vice-President receives $12,000\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Salaries of Foreign Rulers.--The salary paid our President is\r\n     small when we compare it with the grants made to European rulers.\r\n     In 1901 the English government voted some $4,000,000 for the annual\r\n     use of the royal household. The Czar of Russia receives $6,500,000\r\n     annually, in addition to revenues derived from 1,000,000 square\r\n     miles of crown domains. The President of France receives $231,600\r\n     annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nInauguration Day.--One of the most notable of our civic festivals occurs\r\non the fourth of March[42] after the Presidential election. Then\r\nthousands of people go to Washington to witness the inaugural exercises,\r\nby which the President and Vice-President are formally invested with\r\ntheir offices. The Constitution provides that the President shall take\r\nthe following oath of office before entering on his duties:--\r\n\r\nSection I, Clause 7. _I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will\r\nfaithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and\r\nwill to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: It is frequently urged, with good reason, that this date\r\nshould be changed to a time of year when the weather in Washington would\r\nbe more favorable. An amendment, recently sanctioned by the Senate,\r\nprovides that the date for the inauguration shall be the last Thursday\r\nof April. The chief objection to this change seems to be the further\r\nextension of time between the election and the assuming of duties.]\r\n\r\nIt has been established, by custom, that the oath shall be administered\r\nby the Chief Justice of the United States, at the east front of the\r\nCapitol. After taking the oath the President gives his inaugural\r\naddress, which outlines the policy he purposes to carry out.\r\nImmediately after his inauguration, unless it be his second term, he\r\ncalls the Senate together, and places before it his nominations for\r\nmembers of the cabinet, and for such other important offices as he may\r\ndesire to make.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

A reprieve is the temporary suspension of the execution of\r\na sentence. By means of a reprieve the President may gain time to look\r\ninto the evidence more carefully. Complete release from a sentence is\r\nsecured by a pardon.[46]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: For the power of the President over legislation by means\r\nof the veto, see pp. 78, 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: President Harrison was called upon to consider 779\r\nrequests for pardon. Of these 527 were granted, wholly or partially.\r\nPresident Cleveland acted on 907 such cases, and granted 506, in whole\r\nor in part.]\r\n\r\nTreaty-Making Power.--Section 2, Clause 2. _He shall have power, by\r\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties,\r\nprovided two-thirds of the senators present concur_.\r\n\r\nWhile the power to conclude treaties seems to be without restriction, it\r\nis implied that no treaty shall in any way interfere with the authority\r\nof the Constitution. The usual steps in the negotiation of treaties are\r\nas follows: (1) In time of peace they are conducted at the capital of\r\nthe nation that begins the negotiation. If this is in Washington, the\r\nterms are considered by the Secretary of State and the minister of the\r\nother nation; if in a foreign capital, our minister acts under\r\ninstructions sent him by the Secretary of State. At times, one or more\r\nspecial ministers are sent abroad for the purpose of negotiating a\r\ntreaty. (2) In time of war, the minister of the nation with which we are\r\nat war leaves the United States. The interests of his nation are then\r\nintrusted to the minister of some neutral power, and through this\r\nminister negotiations for peace are usually begun. (3) The treaty of\r\npeace at the close of a war is generally negotiated in some neutral\r\ncountry by special commissioners appointed by the nations at war.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the President exercises general control over the\r\nnegotiation and framing of treaties. After an agreement has been\r\nreached, the treaty is sent to the Senate. It is discussed in executive\r\nor secret session. This means that the treaty and all matters pertaining\r\nto it are kept secret until, by a resolution, the Senate allows the\r\ndiscussion to be made public. The Senate may approve, reject, or modify\r\nthe terms. If amendments are made, they must be agreed to by the\r\nPresident and by the other nation interested. When a treaty has been\r\nfinally approved by the officials of both countries, duplicate copies of\r\nit are made on parchment. Both of these copies are signed by the chief\r\nofficers of each country, and the copies are then exchanged. This is\r\ncalled the \"exchange of ratification.\" An official copy of the treaty is\r\nthus secured by each nation. The President then publishes the treaty\r\naccompanied by a proclamation, in which it is declared to be a part of\r\nthe law of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n     If the terms of a treaty call for the payment of money by the\r\n     United States, the necessary amount can be appropriated only by an\r\n     Act of Congress. The House of Representatives may refuse to give\r\n     its sanction to such an appropriation, and may thus prevent the\r\n     treaty going into effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nPower of Appointment.--When it is considered that the President has\r\nthe _nominal_ power of appointing over 150,000 persons to office, we\r\ncan readily see that this comprises one of his chief powers. His right\r\nto select office-holders is granted in Section 2, Clause 2. _He shall\r\nnominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall\r\nappoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the\r\nSupreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose\r\nappointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be\r\nestablished by law; but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of\r\nsuch inferior officers as they think proper, in the President alone, in\r\nthe courts of law, or in the heads of departments._\r\n\r\nVacancies.--Section 2, Clause 3. _The President shall have power to fill\r\nup all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by\r\ngranting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next\r\nsession._\r\n\r\nPresidential Appointments.--It would be quite impossible for the\r\nPresident, personally, to oversee all of these appointments, and so a\r\nlarge percentage of them is made by officials in the different\r\ndepartments. There are, besides the ambassadors, consuls, and judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, some 7000 so-called Presidential officers, whose\r\nappointments must receive the sanction of the Senate. More than one-half\r\nof these are postmasters of the first class[47]. Among the most\r\nimportant of these officers are the Cabinet, interstate commerce\r\ncommissioners, district attorneys, and all military and naval officers\r\nwhose appointment is not otherwise ordered by law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Those who receive an annual salary of $1000 and above.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Official Patronage.--In making his appointments the President\r\n     is largely dependent upon the advice of the head of that department\r\n     under whose direction the officer will come, or upon the\r\n     recommendation of the representatives and senators of his party\r\n     from the State in which the office is located. This official\r\n     patronage, through which political assistants in a State may be\r\n     rewarded with a Federal office, has become so burdensome that many\r\n     Congressmen complain of it and desire to be freed from its\r\n     exactions.\r\n\r\n     Senatorial Courtesy.--There has grown up an almost invariable\r\n     custom, known as senatorial courtesy. This demands that if the\r\n     office to be filled is located in a State, the appointment be not\r\n     confirmed unless it receives the sanction of one or both of the\r\n     senators of the State concerned, provided they are members of the\r\n     same political party as the President.\r\n\r\n     Action of the Senate on Nominations.--All of the nominations\r\n     sent by the President to the Senate are submitted to appropriate\r\n     committees, as, postmasters to the Post Office Committee,\r\n     ambassadors to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The report of the\r\n     committee is considered in secret session, and the nomination is\r\n     then voted on. If the vote is adverse, the President must make\r\n     another nomination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spoils System.--During the first forty years of our government\r\nthere were only seventy-four removals from office. The opinion was\r\ngeneral that there were a large number of strictly non-political offices\r\nin the departments and elsewhere, the holders of which should be\r\nregarded as agents or clerks whose duty it was to assist in carrying on\r\nthe business of government. Therefore the best results could be secured,\r\nit was believed, only as these positions should be filled by persons the\r\nmost competent, who might hope to retain the office so long as they gave\r\nefficient service. But with the coming in of President Jackson the\r\n\"spoils system\" was introduced. This system, in practice, provides that\r\npolitical workers belonging to a victorious party may, as far as\r\npossible, receive reward for their services in the shape of some office.\r\n\"To the victors belong the spoils of the enemy\" is the familiar motto of\r\nthose who have advocated this system. During the first year of President\r\nJackson's administration 2000 officials were deprived of their offices,\r\nand friends of the administration were put in their positions. From that\r\ntime there has been great pressure on every new President similarly to\r\nreward his followers.\r\n\r\nCivil Service Reform.--While the evils had been pointed out at\r\nvarious times, little was done to remedy the spoils system until\r\nCongress, in 1883, passed the Civil Service Law, known as the Pendleton\r\nBill. It provides for a Civil Service Commission of three members, not\r\nmore than two of whom may belong to the same political party. This\r\ncommission gives competitive examinations, which are required for\r\ntesting the fitness of applicants for certain positions in the public\r\nservice. The number of offices originally included under the act was\r\nabout 14,000. The President is given the power to direct the further\r\nextension of the \"classified service,\" that is, those positions that are\r\nto be filled by persons who have passed the best examinations. In 1913\r\nthere were some 284,000 classified offices. While much has been\r\naccomplished, during the past twenty years, toward reforming civil\r\nservice appointments, it is to be hoped that a large number of the\r\nunclassified offices will, at an early date, be placed on the list to be\r\nfilled only after examination.[48] The National government may thus\r\nfurther assist in the movement for like reforms already so well begun in\r\nsome of our States and cities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: In 1913 there were 100,000 unclassified or excepted\r\noffices. During the year 1901-1902, the civil service rules providing\r\nfor competitive examinations were extended by order of the President or\r\nby act of Congress so as to include the rural free delivery service,\r\nemployees of the permanent census bureau, and additional employees made\r\nnecessary because of the war with Spain. Five thousand eight hundred\r\noffices were placed on the competition basis in 1911, and 50,000 in\r\n1913.]\r\n\r\nDuties of the President.--Section 3. _He shall, from time to time,\r\ngive to the Congress information of the state of the Union, and\r\nrecommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge\r\nnecessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary occasions, convene\r\nboth houses, or either of them, and in case of disagreement between\r\nthem, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to\r\nsuch time as he shall think proper; he shall receive ambassadors and\r\nother public ministers; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully\r\nexecuted, and shall commission all the officers of the United States._\r\n\r\nPresidential Messages.--By means of the annual message sent to\r\nCongress at the opening of the session, and special messages on\r\nparticular occasions, the President is enabled to call attention to the\r\nlegislative needs of the country. The plan of having a message read in\r\neach house by the clerk or secretary was introduced by President\r\nJefferson. Presidents Washington and Adams addressed, in person,\r\nCongress assembled in joint session. Various reasons have been alleged\r\nfor this change. President Jefferson was a poor speaker, and it is said\r\nthat he regarded the formal address as monarchical. President Wilson\r\nread his message before Congress in the special session of April, 1913.\r\n\r\nEnforcement of the Laws.--The most important duty of the President\r\nis to see that all laws passed by Congress are faithfully executed. Laws\r\nare useless unless they are enforced, and it is chiefly for the\r\nperformance of this task that the Executive was originally created. It\r\nis not contemplated that this duty shall be performed by him in person,\r\nbut through officials who are directly responsible to him. The United\r\nStates marshals and their deputies exercise a wide influence in seeing\r\nthat the laws are enforced. They usually act under an order from a\r\nUnited States court, but may, at times, act without such a writ. If\r\nnecessary, the President may send the army and navy of the United States\r\nor call out the militia of the States to overcome any resistance to\r\nFederal law.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Each State possesses the power of enforcing its own laws and is of\r\n     right protected in the exercise of this prerogative. In case of an\r\n     insurrection, however, the State militia is sent by order of the\r\n     governor to suppress it. Should they fail to restore order, the\r\n     legislature, or the executive (when the legislature cannot be\r\n     convened), applies to the President for military aid.[49] If the\r\n     uprising has interfered in any way with the carrying out of the\r\n     laws of the nation, the President may, at his discretion, send\r\n     troops to suppress it without having been asked to do so by the\r\n     legislature or the governor. There was a notable illustration of\r\n     this point during the time of the Chicago riots, in July, 1894.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 49: Article IV, Section 4. _The United States shall\r\n     guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of\r\n     government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on\r\n     application of the legislature, or the executive (when the\r\n     legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence._]\r\n\r\n     President Cleveland _vs_. The Governor of Illinois.--In\r\n     addition to destroying property belonging to the railways centering\r\n     in Chicago, the striking employees prevented the free movement of\r\n     the trains. Mr. Altgeld, then governor of Illinois, did not provide\r\n     against these abuses, and President Cleveland ordered the United\r\n     States troops under General Miles to suppress the rioting. The\r\n     President, who was severely criticized by Mr. Altgeld, justified\r\n     his sending the troops on the following grounds: (1) that the\r\n     processes of the Federal courts could not be executed; (2) that the\r\n     transportation of the United States mails was obstructed; and (3)\r\n     that the laws on interstate commerce were not enforced.\r\n\r\n     The United States Supreme Court took the same position as President\r\n     Cleveland in a case which grew out of these riots. Mr. Justice\r\n     Brewer, in delivering the opinion of the court, said: \"We hold that\r\n     the government of the United States is one having jurisdiction over\r\n     every foot of soil within its territory and acting directly upon\r\n     each citizen; that, while it is a government of enumerated powers,\r\n     it has within the limits of those powers all the attributes of\r\n     sovereignty; that to it is committed power over interstate commerce\r\n     and the transmission of the mails, and that these powers have been\r\n     assumed and put into practical exercise by the legislation of\r\n     Congress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

What were the chief points discussed in the President's last annual\r\nmessage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET.\r\n\r\nFormation of Departments.--The Constitution nowhere mentions the\r\nPresident's Cabinet. It was taken for granted, however, that departments\r\nsimilar to those found in the Cabinet would be formed. The Constitution\r\ndeclares that the President \"may require the opinions in writing of the\r\nheads of the executive departments,\" and again, that \"Congress may vest\r\nthe appointment of certain inferior officers in the heads of these\r\ndepartments.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1789 the first Congress created the Departments of State, War, and\r\nTreasury, also the office of Attorney-General. President Washington's\r\nCabinet consisted of the officials whom he appointed to fill these four\r\npositions. The Navy Department was added in 1798. While a Post-Office\r\nDepartment was established in 1794, the Postmaster-General was not made\r\na member of the Cabinet until 1829. In 1849, the Interior Department was\r\ncreated by grouping under it certain duties which had belonged to other\r\ndepartments. The Department of Agriculture was made a Cabinet position\r\nin 1889. In 1903 the Department of Commerce and Labor was authorized by\r\nan Act of Congress, and in 1913 the Department of Labor was created.\r\nMembers of the Cabinet receive an annual salary of $12,000.\r\n\r\nThe President and His Cabinet.--One of the first official acts of\r\na President is to send to the Senate, for its approval, the names of the\r\nmen whom he desires shall constitute his Cabinet. This is now a mere\r\nformality. The President is himself the one most interested in the\r\nsuccess of his administration and is of right given complete freedom in\r\nselecting his immediate advisers. While the views of the members of the\r\nCabinet usually have weight with the President, he is not obliged to\r\ntake their advice. Indeed, in some instances the President has carried\r\nout a line of action which was against the wishes of the secretary of\r\nthe department affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State.--The Secretary of State is commonly called\r\nthe head of the Cabinet. He is first in rank at the Cabinet table, and\r\noccupies the seat of dignity at the right of the President. Under the\r\ndirection of the President he conducts all negotiations relating to the\r\nforeign affairs of the nation; carries on the correspondence with our\r\nrepresentatives in other countries; receives the representatives of\r\nforeign powers accredited to the United States, and presents them to the\r\nPresident. Through him the President communicates with the executives of\r\nthe different States. He has charge of the treaties made with foreign\r\npowers, and negotiates new ones. He has also in his keeping the laws of\r\nthe United States and the great seal which he affixes to all executive\r\nproclamations, commissions, and other official papers. During the year\r\n1909 the department was reorganized in such a manner as to create a\r\ndivision of Latin-American affairs and divisions for Far Eastern, Near\r\nEastern, and Western European affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Bureau.--The United States, in common with other\r\nnations, sends representatives to the foreign capitals. They are the\r\nagents through whom the Secretary of State communicates and negotiates\r\nwith other powers. Such affairs are conducted through the Diplomatic\r\nBureau. The United States has now about thirty-five ambassadors and\r\nministers. Our representatives at the courts of England, France,\r\nGermany, Russia, Italy, Austria, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, and Turkey are\r\nknown as ambassadors. The ambassadors to these countries receive a\r\nsalary of $17,500 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The social demands made upon our ambassadors are great, and they\r\n     are also obliged to provide for their places of residence. The\r\n     salaries paid are not sufficient to meet these necessary expenses,\r\n     and are small in comparison with those paid by the European nations\r\n     to officers of the same rank. Thus, the English ambassador at\r\n     Washington receives a salary of $32,500. Besides the English, the\r\n     German, the Japanese, and some other nations have provided houses\r\n     for their legations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consular Bureau.--A consul is sent by the United States to each\r\nof the chief cities in the consular districts into which foreign\r\ncountries are divided by our State Department. These consuls, of whom\r\nthere are three grades, consuls-generals, consuls, and consular agents,\r\nlook after the commercial interests of the United States in those\r\ndistricts. They make monthly reports on improvements in agricultural\r\nand manufacturing processes. These reports also give information\r\nregarding good markets for our products and of the best markets in which\r\nto purchase foreign products.[50]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Among scores of similar subjects, our consuls reported,\r\nwithin recent years, on the following: American goods in Syria; American\r\ncommerce with Asia Minor and Eastern Europe; German opinion of American\r\nlocomotives; American coal in Germany; European and American\r\ncompetition.]\r\n\r\nConsuls care for destitute American sailors and protect the interests of\r\nour citizens in foreign countries. In some of the non-Christian nations,\r\nsuch as China and Turkey, they also have jurisdiction over all criminal\r\ncases in which any American citizen may be a party. The importance of\r\nsuch services to our country is self-evident. The appointment of these\r\nofficials was formerly secured under party pressure. According to the\r\nrule adopted in 1906, all vacancies in the consular service are\r\nhereafter to be filled by promotion for ability and efficiency in the\r\nservice or by appointment of those who have passed the civil service\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury.--The Department of the Treasury is\r\nthe most extensive and complex of the executive departments. In general,\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury has charge of the finances of the nation.\r\nHe is required to prepare plans for the creation and improvement of the\r\nrevenues and the public credit and to superintend the collection of the\r\nrevenue. He gives orders for all moneys drawn from the Treasury in\r\naccordance with appropriations made by Congress, and submits an annual\r\nreport to Congress which contains an estimate of the probable receipts\r\nand expenditures of the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Auditors.--It is very important that the accounts of the\r\n     government should be carefully scrutinized, and one of the six\r\n     auditors connected with the Treasury Department must pass upon the\r\n     accounts of every public officer who pays out money. Thus, the\r\n     Auditor for the Treasury Department examines all accounts of\r\n     salaries and incidental expenses of the office of the Secretary of\r\n     the Treasury and all other offices under his immediate direction,\r\n     such as the Treasurer and Directors of the Mints.\r\n\r\n     The Treasurer.--All the money of the United States is under\r\n     the care of the Treasurer. He receives and pays it out upon the\r\n     warrant of the Secretary of the Treasury or a designated assistant,\r\n     redeems the notes of the National banks, and manages the\r\n     Independent Treasury System. This system renders the Treasury\r\n     Department practically independent of the banks of the country. It\r\n     includes the Treasury at Washington and sub-treasuries, each in\r\n     charge of an assistant treasurer at Boston, New York, Philadelphia,\r\n     Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, New Orleans, and San\r\n     Francisco. While the greater part of the money belonging to the\r\n     government is found in these places, about two hundred National\r\n     banks have also been designated as public depositories.\r\n\r\n     The Chief of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.--The\r\n     Bureau[51] of Engraving and Printing is one of the largest in the\r\n     department and employs about 1600 people. It has been said that the\r\n     products of this bureau, in the course of a single year, represent\r\n     a sum equal in value to all the money in circulation in the United\r\n     States; for here the engraving of the plates and the printing of\r\n     all the United States circulating notes, bonds, revenue stamps, and\r\n     postage stamps are done.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: The work of each department is usually distributed among\r\nthe bureaus. Bureaus are again divided into divisions. At the head of\r\neach bureau is a commissioner, and of each division a chief.]\r\n\r\nOther Officers of the Treasury Department.--Among the other\r\nleading officials of the Treasury Department are: Comptroller of the\r\nCurrency, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, General Superintendent of\r\nthe Life-saving Service, Solicitor of the Treasury, Supervising\r\nSurgeon-General, and Supervising Architect.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Life-Saving Service.--This is one of the most important\r\n     offices in the Treasury Department. More than 2000 men are employed\r\n     in the 273 stations, located generally at danger points on the\r\n     oceans and the Great Lakes. Out of the 6000 lives imperiled in the\r\n     year 1910 in the disasters on water, only 53 were lost. Of the 1463\r\n     vessels of all kinds in distress, 1407 were rendered assistance by\r\n     life-savers. It has been estimated that over 230,000 lives have\r\n     been saved through this service since it was founded in 1848.\r\n\r\n     The Solicitor of the Treasury.--The Solicitor of the Treasury\r\n     is the law officer of the department, and has charge of all\r\n     prosecutions by the government arising out of the counterfeiting of\r\n     the government securities, or of the infringement of customs\r\n     revenue, and of all suits for the collection of moneys due the\r\n     United States, except those due under the internal revenue laws.\r\n\r\n     The Supervising Surgeon-General.--The Supervising\r\n     Surgeon-General superintends the twenty-two marine hospitals where\r\n     our sick sailors are cared for; conducts the quarantine service of\r\n     the United States, and directs the laboratories for the\r\n     investigation of the causes of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War.--The Secretary of War, under the direction of\r\nthe President, has charge of the military affairs of the government. He\r\nsupervises all estimates of appropriations for the expenses of the\r\ndepartment.[52] He has under his supervision also the military academy\r\nat West Point, all National cemeteries, and river and harbor\r\nimprovement. The chiefs of the eleven bureaus are regular army officers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: The annual appropriation by Congress for the army alone in\r\n1912 amounted to $90,483,403.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Adjutant-General.--The Adjutant-General issues orders for\r\n     the muster of troops and for their movement, conducts the\r\n     correspondence of the department, and keeps the records.\r\n\r\n     The Inspector-General.--The Inspector-General examines and\r\n     reports on all places where United States troops are stationed; on\r\n     public works carried on by army officers; and on the military\r\n     academy and prisons.\r\n\r\n     The Quartermaster-General.--Under direction of the\r\n     Quartermaster-General the army is transported, clothed, and\r\n     equipped.\r\n\r\n     The Chief of Ordnance.--Arms are supplied by the Chief of\r\n     Ordnance. The arms used are manufactured chiefly in the United\r\n     States arsenals. The arsenals at Springfield, Mass., and Rock\r\n     Island, Ill., manufacture rifles and carbines; and that at West\r\n     Troy, N.Y., cannon and mortars.\r\n\r\n     The United States Military Academy.--The United States\r\n     Military Academy at West Point was founded in 1802. The corps of\r\n     cadets is made up of one cadet from each of the Congressional\r\n     districts, one from each of the Territories and the District of\r\n     Columbia, and one hundred from the United States at large. Prior to\r\n     the year 1900 there were only ten cadets at large. The act of that\r\n     year also provided that thirty cadets were to be named by the\r\n     President directly and the remainder apportioned among the States.\r\n     They all receive their appointments from the President, but it has\r\n     become the custom for the representatives and delegates to select\r\n     (usually after a competitive examination) those from the\r\n     Congressional districts and the Territories. The cadet must be\r\n     between seventeen and twenty-two years of age. Each receives $540 a\r\n     year during the four years of his course. Upon graduation, the\r\n     cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants in the united States\r\n     army. In case there are more graduates than vacancies, those in\r\n     excess are honorably discharged with the payment of one year's\r\n     salary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy--The duties of the Secretary of the Navy\r\npertain to the construction, manning, arming, quipping, and employment\r\nof war-vessels.[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The appropriation for this department in 1913 was\r\n$140,000,000.]\r\n\r\nThe United States Naval Academy.--The naval academy at Annapolis\r\nwas established in 1846. One cadet is allowed in the naval academy for\r\neach member or delegate of the House of Representatives, one for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and ten at large. Candidates for admission, at the\r\ntime of their examination, must be between the ages of fifteen and\r\ntwenty years. The nomination of a candidate to fill a vacancy is made\r\nupon recommendation of a representative or delegate if made before July\r\n1; but if no recommendation be made by that time, the Secretary of the\r\nNavy fills the vacancy by appointing an actual resident of the district\r\nin which the vacancy exists. The President selects the candidates at\r\nlarge and the cadet for the District of Columbia. At the conclusion of\r\nthe six years' course, two of which are spent at sea, the graduates are\r\nassigned in order of merit to the vacancies that may have occurred in\r\nthe lower grades of the line of the navy and of the marine corps. Cadets\r\nwho are not assigned to service after graduation are honorably\r\ndischarged and are given $500, the amount they have received each year\r\nof their course at the academy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General.--The Attorney-General is the legal adviser of\r\nthe President and of the heads of the departments. He supervises the\r\nwork of all the United States district attorneys and marshals, and is\r\nassisted by the Solicitor-General. Unless otherwise directed, all cases\r\nbefore the Supreme Court and the Court of Claims in which the United\r\nStates is a party are argued by the Attorney-General and the\r\nSolicitor-General.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General.--The Postmaster-General is at the head of\r\nthis department. He appoints all of the officers of the department with\r\nthe exception of the four assistant postmasters-general and postmasters\r\nof the first class, whose appointments are made by the President with\r\nthe consent of the Senate. The Postmaster-General may, with the consent\r\nof the President, let contracts and make postal treaties with foreign\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Postal Union.--Since 1891 the United States has been a\r\n     member of the Universal Postal Union. By this union over fifty\r\n     distinct powers became parties to an agreement by which uniform\r\n     rates of postage were agreed upon and every facility for carrying\r\n     mails in each country was extended to all the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior.--The Interior Department, under the\r\nsupervision of the Secretary of the Interior, is one of the most\r\ncomplex and important of the departments. There are two assistant\r\nsecretaries in the department, while at the head of the other offices\r\nare six commissioners and two directors.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Commissioner of the General Land Office.--The Commissioner\r\n     of the General Land Office has charge of all the public lands of\r\n     the government, and supervises the surveys, sales, and issuing of\r\n     titles to this property.\r\n\r\n     The Commissioner of Education.--The Commissioner of Education\r\n     is the chief of the Bureau of Education. This bureau has charge of\r\n     the collection of facts and statistics relating to the educational\r\n     systems and to progress along educational lines in the several\r\n     States and Territories, and also in foreign countries. The reports\r\n     issued by the bureau are of great value to those interested in\r\n     education. The commissioner has advisory power only, except in\r\n     Alaska. Here he directs the management of the schools.\r\n\r\n     The Commissioner of Pensions.--The Commissioner of Pensions\r\n     supervises the examination and adjustment of all claims arising\r\n     under the laws of Congress granting bounty land or pensions on\r\n     account of services in the army or navy during the time of war.\r\n     That our government has not been ungrateful may be gathered from\r\n     the report of the commissioner for 1913. There were in that year\r\n     921,000 pensioners, to whom were paid approximately $180,000,000,\r\n     or an amount equal to about one-fifth of the total revenues of the\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n     The Commissioner of Indian Affairs.--Prior to 1871 the Indian\r\n     tribes were treated as independent nations by the United States,\r\n     but by a law of that year the general government was made the\r\n     guardian of their interests. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\n     exercises a protecting care over these \"wards\" by directing the\r\n     work of the Indian agents and of the superintendents of Indian\r\n     schools.\r\n\r\n     There are some 300,000 Indians on the 150 reservations which are in\r\n     the various States and Territories.[54] The lands of these\r\n     reservations are held in common; that is, the ownership is tribal\r\n     rather than individual. It is the policy of the government,\r\n     however, to bring about the allotment of lands \"in severally,\" and\r\n     thus to encourage the Indians to adopt an agricultural life. The\r\n     Indians are only partially self-supporting. Some tribes derive an\r\n     income from funds which are the proceeds derived from the sales and\r\n     cessions of their lands. The National government holds this money\r\n     in trust for them, and, by direct appropriation, supplies the\r\n     money, food, and clothing necessary to complete their support. The\r\n     appropriation for the Indians in 1912 was $9,854,000. Over\r\n     one-fourth of this sum was spent for their education in Indian\r\n     schools, numbering about 300, which are under the direct control of\r\n     the department.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 54: Report of the Secretary of the Interior, 1910. Within\r\n     twelve years 89,000 Indians were granted full rights as citizens.]\r\n\r\n     The Director of the Geological Survey.--The Director of the\r\n     Geological Survey collects much valuable information through the\r\n     examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and\r\n     mineral products of the United States. He has charge, also, of the\r\n     survey of the forest reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Agriculture.--The duties of the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture are, \"To acquire and diffuse among the people of the United\r\nStates useful information on subjects connected with agriculture in the\r\nmost comprehensive sense of that word.\" The activities of the department\r\nare along many lines, as indicated by the names of the bureaus and\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Bureau of Animal Industry.--Continuous advancement is being\r\n     made by the government toward placing the agricultural pursuits\r\n     upon a more scientific basis. One of its most important services is\r\n     performed in the Bureau of Animal Industry, which inspects the\r\n     greater part of the meat products exported to European countries.\r\n     The law providing for this inspection was necessary because of the\r\n     claim in European markets that diseased meats were shipped from the\r\n     United States. An inspection is also provided for live animals\r\n     intended for exportation and for animals imported. Much scientific\r\n     work is also devoted to a study of the various diseases of animals.\r\n\r\n     The Division of Seeds.--Over $100,000 are expended each year\r\n     by the Division of Seeds in the purchase of \"rare and valuable\"\r\n     seeds, bulbs, and plants. These are distributed free throughout the\r\n     country for the purpose of fostering the introduction of new and\r\n     more valuable crops.\r\n\r\n     Public Road Inquiries.--Another important interest is carried\r\n     on by the Office of Public Road Inquiries. Here experiments are\r\n     made with regard to the best system of road-making and the best\r\n     materials to be used for that purpose.\r\n\r\n     Weather Bureau.--Through the Weather Bureau daily forecasts\r\n     and warning of storms are sent to over 50,000 different points,\r\n     and storm signals are displayed at 300 places on our coasts. By its\r\n     operation, millions of dollars are saved each year to the\r\n     agricultural and maritime interests of the country. A recent decree\r\n     of the Post-office Department renders the reports of the bureau of\r\n     still greater service. Slips of paper having the storm, frost, or\r\n     other warnings printed on them are distributed by the rural mail\r\n     carriers at the various houses in the districts affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nNature of the Department.--Because of the nature of the subjects\r\nassigned to this new department, it has rapidly become one of the most\r\nimportant of the departments. Among the duties of the Secretary of\r\nCommerce are these: to promote the commerce and the mining,\r\nmanufacturing, shipping, fishery, and transportation interests of the\r\nUnited States. The President is given the power to transfer to the\r\ndepartment those bureaus in other departments which are engaged in\r\nscientific or statistical work, the Interstate Commerce Commission and\r\nthe scientific divisions of the Agricultural Department being excepted.\r\nThe offices which have been transferred are as follows: the Bureau of\r\nStatistics; Census Bureau; Bureau of Standards of Weights and Measures;\r\nBureau of Navigation; the Steamboat Inspection Service; Bureau of\r\nFisheries; Coast and Geodetic Survey and Light-house Board. The Bureau\r\nof Corporations was created for the department. The Commissioner of\r\nCorporations is expected to investigate the organization, conduct, and\r\nmanagement of the business of corporations and other combinations\r\nengaged in interstate or foreign commerce, except such carriers as may\r\nbe subject to the interstate commerce act.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Chief of the Bureau of Statistics.--The Chief of the\r\n     Bureau of Statistics collects and publishes the annual statistics\r\n     on commerce. These reports are of such a character that they are\r\n     invaluable to the President in the preparation of his messages; and\r\n     they are used extensively by the heads of departments, members of\r\n     Congress, and the public. Tariff laws, special legislation for\r\n     particular industries, and all international trade treaties are\r\n     also based on these compilations. The greatest demand is for the\r\n     Annual Statistical Abstract, which presents in a condensed form the\r\n     history of the commerce of the United States for a number of\r\n     preceding years.\r\n\r\n     The Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.--This\r\n     officer superintends the survey of the coasts and rivers of the\r\n     United States. He has charge of the publication of charts and\r\n     sailing directions which are of inestimable value to mariners.\r\n\r\n     The Light-House Board.--The Light-house Board has charge of\r\n     the light-houses, of which 1199 had been established previous to\r\n     the year 1899, besides the light vessels and beacons used for the\r\n     protection of navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.\r\n\r\nOn March 4, 1913, the bill was signed by the President which created the\r\nDepartment of Labor. It is evidence of the spirit manifested by the\r\nAmericans to make their government serve the cause of human\r\nconservation. Besides the Bureau of Information, which was created for\r\nthe department, there were transferred from other departments the Bureau\r\nof Immigration[55] and the Children's Bureau. The Division of\r\nNaturalization was made a bureau, and the Bureau of Labor was\r\nconstituted the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: In 1912 there were 838,172 immigrants to the United\r\nStates, and 2853 were refused admission. Of these there were 767\r\npaupers, 31 contract laborers, 749 diseased persons.]\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

If we consider the nature of our\r\npresent government, it is easily seen that some form of independent\r\ntribunal is necessary. We have a central government exercising complete\r\ncontrol over National affairs and foreign relations and, at the same\r\ntime, the State governments with equally complete control over questions\r\narising within their limits. If differences arise, then, as to the\r\nauthority of National or State government over a given question, how are\r\nthese disputes to be settled peaceably? After a brief discussion, the\r\nproblem was answered in the Constitutional Convention by the formation\r\nof a Federal judiciary.\r\n\r\nOrganization of the Judiciary.--The organization of the judiciary\r\nis provided for as follows: Section 1. _The judicial power of the United\r\nStates shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts\r\nas the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges,\r\nboth of the Supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices\r\nduring good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their\r\nservices a compensation which shall not be diminished during their\r\ncontinuance in office._\r\n\r\nIn 1789 Congress provided that the Supreme Court should consist of a\r\nchief justice and five associates. Circuit and district courts were also\r\nestablished. The Supreme Court at present consists of the chief justice\r\nand eight associate justices. It holds one session annually, at\r\nWashington, beginning on the second Monday in October and continuing\r\nuntil about May 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n     District Courts.--The territory of the United States has been\r\n     divided into judicial districts, none of them crossing State lines\r\n     and each having a district court. New York and Texas have each four\r\n     districts; Alabama, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee three each;\r\n     Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky,\r\n     Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio,\r\n     Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia two\r\n     each; and the remaining States have each a single district. Alaska\r\n     and Hawaii constitute a district. Generally there is a judge for\r\n     each district, but a single judge is at times assigned to two\r\n     districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited States District Attorneys and Marshals.--A district attorney\r\nand marshal are appointed by the President for each district court. The\r\nUnited States district attorney is required to prosecute all persons\r\naccused of the violation of Federal law and to appear as defendant in\r\ncases brought against the government of the United States in his\r\ndistrict. The United States marshal executes the warrants or other\r\norders of the United States district court, and, in general, performs\r\nduties connected with the enforcement of the Federal laws which\r\nresemble the duties of sheriffs under State laws.\r\n\r\nCircuit Courts and Courts of Appeals.--Established by the act of\r\n1789, each circuit court was at first presided over by a justice of the\r\nSupreme Court and a district judge. The policy was to have as many\r\ncircuit courts as there were justices of the Supreme Court. It was not\r\nuntil 1869 that a circuit judge was provided for each of the nine\r\ncircuits. By an Act of Congress during the year 1911, in response to the\r\nagitation for a simplified Federal judicial system and greater\r\nexpedition in the hearing of cases, the circuit courts were abandoned.\r\nJudges of these courts were transferred to the circuit courts of\r\nappeals. The circuit courts of appeals consist of three judges each, any\r\ntwo constituting a quorum. Supreme Court judges and district judges may\r\nsit in these courts. The Court of Claims was established in 1855 and\r\nconsists of a chief justice and four associates. It holds an annual\r\nsession in Washington.\r\n\r\nTerms and Salaries of the Judges.--That the judiciary should be\r\nindependent of parties and of other influences cannot be questioned.\r\nHence the wisdom of the provision that United States judges shall hold\r\ntheir offices during good behavior and shall receive a compensation for\r\ntheir services which shall not be diminished during their continuance in\r\noffice. Judges of the United States courts are appointed by the\r\nPresident with the consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of Congress of 1911 the salary of the Chief Justice was fixed\r\nat $15,000 per annum; that of associate justices, $14,500; and district\r\njudges, $6000.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction of the National Courts.--We are next to consider the\r\njurisdiction of the several courts that have been described.\r\n\r\nSection 2, Clause 1. _The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in\r\nlaw and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United\r\nStates, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their\r\nauthority;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers\r\nand consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to\r\ncontroversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to\r\ncontroversies between two or more States;--between a State and citizens\r\nof another State;--between citizens of different States;--between\r\ncitizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different\r\nStates, and between a State, or the citizens thereof, and foreign\r\nstates, citizens or subjects_. A careful consideration of this clause\r\nshows the wide extent of the powers of the United States courts. It\r\nshows also the desirability of having all such cases under their\r\njurisdiction rather than under the authority of the State courts.\r\nAssociate Justice Brewer wrote, with reference to the influence of the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court on the history of the country:[56] \"Its\r\ndecisions have always been in harmony with and sustaining the\r\nproposition that this republic is a nation acting directly upon all its\r\ncitizens, with the attributes and authority of a nation, and not a mere\r\nleague or confederacy of States. The importance of this cannot be\r\noverestimated, and will be appreciated by all who compare the weakness\r\nof the old confederacy with the strength and vigor of the republic under\r\nthe present Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: \"The Supreme Court of the United States,\" _Scribner's\r\nMag_., 33:275,276.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Suit against a State by a Citizen of Another State.--In the\r\n     notable case of Chisholm vs. Georgia in 1793, Chisholm, a citizen\r\n     of North Carolina, began action against the State of Georgia in the\r\n     Supreme Court of the United States. That court interpreted the\r\n     clause as applying to cases in which a State is defendant, as well\r\n     as to those in which it is plaintiff. The decision was received\r\n     with disfavor by the States, and Congress proposed the Eleventh\r\n     Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1798 and is as\r\n     follows:--\r\n\r\n     _The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to\r\n     extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted\r\n     against one of the United States, by citizens of another State, or\r\n     by citizens or subjects of any foreign state_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal and Appellate Jurisdiction.--Clause 2. _In all cases\r\naffecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in\r\nwhich a State shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have original\r\njurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court\r\nshall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such\r\nexceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make_.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in \"all cases affecting\r\nambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a\r\nState shall be a party.\" Original jurisdiction means that these cases\r\nmay be begun in the Supreme Court. Other cases are brought to the\r\nSupreme Court from the inferior United States courts or from the\r\nsupreme courts of the States and Territories by appeal. In such cases\r\nthe Supreme Court is said to have appellate jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction of the Inferior Courts.--It is difficult in brief\r\nspace to define minutely the province of each court The following\r\naccounts, therefore, give only a general description:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The circuit courts of appeals are given final jurisdiction in\r\n     certain cases appealed to them from the district courts, such as\r\n     those arising under the patent, revenue, and criminal laws, as well\r\n     as admiralty and other cases in which the opposing parties to a\r\n     suit are an alien and a citizen, or are citizens of different\r\n     States. There is reserved to the Supreme Court the decision of\r\n     cases involving constitutionality.\r\n\r\n     The circuit courts of appeals have the final decision in nearly all\r\n     other cases involving merely the application of ordinary law.\r\n\r\n     The jurisdiction of the district courts embraces criminal cases,\r\n     admiralty cases, bankruptcy proceedings, suits for penalties, and\r\n     the like. In general, the jurisdiction of cases formerly in the\r\n     circuit courts was transferred to the district courts when the\r\n     circuit courts were discontinued.\r\n\r\n     The Court of Claims \"shall hear and determine all claims founded\r\n     upon any law of Congress, or upon any regulation of an executive\r\n     department, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the\r\n     government of the United States, which may be suggested to it by a\r\n     petition filed therein; and also all claims which may be referred\r\n     to said court by either house of Congress.\"[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Statutes at Large, 612.]\r\n\r\nTrial by Jury.--The right of trial by jury in all criminal cases\r\nhad been insisted upon by Englishmen for centuries prior to the\r\nformation of our Constitution. There were two branches to the system,\r\nthe grand and the petit juries. Each performed the same duties as they\r\ndo now. The Constitution provides in Section 2, Clause 1, that\r\n\r\n_The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by\r\njury, and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crime\r\nshall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the\r\ntrial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have\r\ndirected_.\r\n\r\nThis clause was attacked by the opponents of the Constitution in the\r\nState conventions. It was believed that the Constitution did not furnish\r\nadequate safeguards against unjust prosecutions. Because of this\r\nagitation, Congress, in its first session, proposed Amendments V, VI,\r\nVII, and VIII, which were duly ratified by the several States.\r\n\r\nAmendment V. _No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or\r\notherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a\r\ngrand jury, etc._[58]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See Appendix A.]\r\n\r\nAuthorities have had difficulty in giving an exact definition of an\r\ninfamous crime. That given by Judge Cooley is the most satisfactory. He\r\nsays: \"But the punishment of the penitentiary must always be deemed\r\ninfamous, and so must any punishment that involves the loss of civil or\r\npolitical privileges.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jury.--A grand jury consists of from twelve to\r\ntwenty-three men. They sit in secret, and no accusation can be made by\r\nthem without the concurrence of at least twelve. An indictment is a\r\nwritten accusation of an offense drawn up by a prosecuting officer on\r\nbehalf of the government and laid before the grand jury. \"A presentment\r\nis an accusation by a grand jury of an offense upon their own\r\nobservation and knowledge, or upon evidence before them, and without any\r\nbill of indictment laid before them at the suit of government.\"[59] In\r\nthe case of a presentment, the party accused cannot be held to trial\r\nuntil he has been indicted. After hearing the evidence, if the grand\r\njury concludes that the accusation is not true, they write on the back\r\nof the bill, \"Not a true bill\" or \"Not found.\" The accused, if held in\r\ncustody, is then given his freedom, but he may be again indicted by\r\nanother grand jury. If the grand jury decides that the accusation is\r\ntrue, they then write on the back of the bill, \"A true bill\" or \"Found.\"\r\nThe indicted person must be held to answer the charges made against him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Story, \"Commentaries on the Constitution,\" ยง 1784.]\r\n\r\nRights of the Accused.--Amendment VI. _In all criminal\r\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public\r\ntrial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime\r\nshall have been committed, etc. _(See Appendix A).\r\n\r\nAmendment VII. _In suits at common law, where the value in controversy\r\nshall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be\r\npreserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in\r\nany court of the United States, than according to the rules of the\r\ncommon law._\r\n\r\nThe accused must be given a public and speedy trial before an impartial\r\njury, known as the petit jury, consisting of twelve men from the\r\ndistrict wherein the crime was committed. The decision must be unanimous\r\nbefore a verdict can be rendered. The accused is given a copy of the\r\nindictment in which the nature of the accusation is clearly set forth\r\nand is granted time in which to prepare for his defense. Equally just\r\nand significant are the provisions that he shall be confronted by the\r\nwitnesses against him, may compel the attendance of witnesses in his\r\nfavor, and may employ counsel for his defense. In case he is not able to\r\npay for his own counsel, the judge appoints one whose services are paid\r\nfor out of the public treasury. If the verdict has been rendered by a\r\njury and the judgment pronounced, the accused cannot be again brought to\r\ntrial on the same charge.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

Here several of the original States (viz.,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and Virginia) had had claims,\r\nwhich they ceded to the general government during the period of the\r\nConfederation. This region was given the name Northwest Territory. It\r\nwas governed under the Ordinance of 1787 enacted by Congress for this\r\npurpose. As settlers came into this region, Congress passed special acts\r\nfor the government of the different Territories that were erected where\r\nnow we find the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the region lying south of Kentucky was ceded to the\r\nUnited States by the Carolinas and Georgia, and was then formed into\r\nTerritories and governed by Congress. Next, the Louisiana Purchase,\r\nFlorida, the Mexican Cession, and the Oregon Territory came under the\r\ncontrol of Congress; a succession of Territories was thus created, all\r\nof which have now been admitted into the Union as States. In the\r\ngovernment of these Territories, Congress has acted in accordance with\r\nan important power granted to it by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nArticle IV, Section 3, Clause 3. _The Congress shall have power to\r\ndispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the\r\nterritory or other property belonging to the United States._\r\n\r\nThe Government of Territories.--Our Territories at present are\r\nAlaska, Porto Rico, and Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe governing authorities in each are: (1) a governor, appointed by the\r\nPresident, with the consent of the Senate; (2) administrative\r\nofficers--secretary, treasurer, auditor, attorney-general,\r\nadjutant-general, and superintendent of education, all appointed in the\r\nsame way; (3) a legislature consisting of two houses, the members of the\r\nlower house, at least, being elected by popular vote; (4) a system of\r\ncourts in which the judges are appointed by the President and Senate.\r\n\r\nRelations between Territories and Congress.--A Territory is\r\norganized by an Act of Congress which provides for these officers and\r\nprescribes their powers. The Territorial legislature controls the\r\ninternal affairs of the Territory; but its acts may be changed or vetoed\r\nby Congress. The people of a Territory have no voice in National\r\naffairs, but they elect a delegate to Congress, who may debate but not\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Porto Rico.--The government of Porto Rico is different at some\r\n     points from that of the other organized Territories. The upper\r\n     house of its legislature is the Executive Council and consists of\r\n     the administrative officers of the Territory (secretary, treasurer,\r\n     auditor, commissioner of the interior, attorney-general, and\r\n     commissioner of education) and five other persons appointed by the\r\n     President. Five of the eleven members of this council must be\r\n     natives of Porto Rico. The House of Delegates has thirty-five\r\n     members, elected triennially by the voters. There is elected by the\r\n     people a \"resident commissioner\" to the United States, who, unlike\r\n     the delegates from other Territories, has no seat in Congress, but\r\n     rather has official relations with the President.\r\n\r\n     The Territory of Hawaii.--Hawaii was annexed to the United\r\n     States in 1898, and its government was established by Congress in\r\n     1900. The administrative officers in this Territory are appointed\r\n     by the governor, instead of by the President. Voters in Hawaii must\r\n     be able to read and write either the English or Hawaiian language.\r\n\r\n     Alaska.--By a law of 1912, Alaska was given for the first time\r\n     a Territorial legislature, consisting of two houses, elected by the\r\n     people.\r\n\r\n     Our Government in the Philippine Islands.--The Philippines\r\n     constitute the largest part of \"our insular possessions,\" and are\r\n     not classed as Territories. The word \"colonies\" better expresses\r\n     their relations to the United States. They are governed by a\r\n     commission of nine members: the governor, four heads of departments\r\n     (Americans), and four Filipinos. All are appointed by the President\r\n     with the consent of the Senate. This commission constitutes the\r\n     upper house of the legislative body; the lower house or assembly is\r\n     elected from certain districts of the islands where the people are\r\n     considered civilized and are at peace. Voters must be\r\n     property-owners and be able to read and write English or Spanish.\r\n\r\n     The entire group of islands is divided into provinces. In some of\r\n     these the people have local self-government; in others there is\r\n     military government under the United States army. In many cities\r\n     the government is similar to that of American cities.\r\n\r\n     Besides numerous other small islands the United States possesses\r\n     Tutuila in the Samoan group, Guam, and Wake Island. These are\r\n     governed directly by the naval authorities of the government.\r\n\r\n     The Panama Canal Zone is governed by the Isthmian Canal Commission,\r\n     consisting of seven men appointed by the President. The commission\r\n     is subordinate to the War Department at Washington.\r\n\r\n     Political Relations with Cuba.--Cuba was under the control of\r\n     our military authority between the time when our troops occupied\r\n     the island, during the Spanish-American War, and the announcement\r\n     of its independence in May, 1902. Although Cuba is now an\r\n     independent republic, it is considered as a \"protectorate\" of the\r\n     United States, and is subject to the influence of this nation in\r\n     its dealings with other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Admission of Territories to Statehood.--While Territories\r\ndepend to a greater or less extent upon the nation for their government,\r\nit has always been the policy of the United States to admit them into\r\nthe Union as States when conditions became right for this action. That\r\nthe power to admit States into the Union belongs exclusively to Congress\r\nis evident from the language of the Constitution:\r\n\r\nArticle IV, Section 3, Clause 1. _New States may be admitted by the\r\nCongress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by\r\nthe junction of two or more States or parts of States, without the\r\nconsent of the legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the\r\nCongress._\r\n\r\nTerritories first apply for admission to the Union, and then either of\r\ntwo processes may follow: (1) Congress passes an enabling act\r\nauthorizing the Territory to frame a constitution, which is submitted to\r\nCongress for approval. (2) Or, the Territory frames its constitution\r\nwithout waiting for the enabling act; with this in its hand the\r\nTerritory then applies to Congress for admission. In either case,\r\nbefore giving its approval to the admission of a State, Congress must\r\nsee that the constitution submitted contains nothing that is\r\ninconsistent with a republican form of government.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Public Land Policy.--In the Territories which lay between the\r\nAllegheny Mountains and the Mississippi River, and in all the\r\nacquisitions that have since been made, the unoccupied[60] lands became\r\nthe property of the United States. So the National government became the\r\npossessor of many millions of acres of land, and it still holds immense\r\ntracts in the Western States and in its distant possessions. Upon the\r\nadmission of a Territory as a State, the ownership of its public lands\r\ndoes not pass to the new State, but remains with the National\r\ngovernment. The latter has followed a most liberal policy in dealing\r\nwith its lands, (1) It has granted great amounts to the States. The\r\nschool lands which are the basis of the common school funds in the\r\nWestern States were acquired in this way. (2) Many thousands of square\r\nmiles have been granted to railroad companies as aid in the construction\r\nof their lines. These lands are still being purchased at low rates by\r\nsettlers in the West. (3) The \"homestead law\" provides that citizens may\r\nacquire 160 acres of land, or less, free of cost, on condition of living\r\nupon it for five years and improving it. (4) Millions of acres are still\r\nheld by the government, subject to sale at low prices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Exceptions to this statement must be made to cover certain\r\nlands reserved by some of the original States that ceded their claims to\r\nthe United States; as, for instance, the Western Reserve in Ohio\r\nretained by Connecticut, and other lands in the same State retained by\r\nVirginia.]\r\n\r\nAt present the larger part of the public lands of the United States are\r\narid; that is, they cannot be cultivated without irrigation. By a law of\r\n1902, the proceeds received from the sale of public lands in certain\r\nWestern States and Territories will be expended by the National\r\ngovernment in the construction of irrigation works. This law is destined\r\nto have a great influence upon the future of our Western States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National System of Survey.--In the thirteen original States\r\nthere was no uniform system of land survey, but each tract of land was\r\nsurveyed as necessity required, generally after settlement had been\r\nmade upon it. The tracts were of very irregular shapes. The boundary\r\nlines, usually starting from some natural object, were measured by rods\r\nor chains, running in certain directions as ascertained by the use of\r\nthe compass. This method of survey is still in use in the Eastern\r\nStates. According to a law of 1785, a uniform system of \"rectangular\r\nsurvey\" was applied to all lands belonging to the United States. This\r\nsurvey has preceded settlers, and has to some extent influenced the\r\nmethod of settlement and the nature of local government throughout the\r\nWest. The lands surveyed have been divided into townships six miles\r\nsquare. For the boundaries of townships the law requires the use of\r\nnorth-and-south and east-and-west lines. To secure starting points from\r\nwhich to run these lines, it was necessary to designate certain\r\nmeridians as Principal Meridians and certain parallels as Base Lines.\r\n\r\nMethod of Land Description.--The map indicates the location of\r\nPrincipal Meridians and Base Lines in the States north of the Ohio\r\nRiver. Starting, then, from any Principal Meridian, the tier of\r\ntownships directly east is called Range I; the other ranges are numbered\r\neast and west of that meridian. Counting also from the Base Line, the\r\ntownships are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., both north and south. It thus\r\nbecomes possible to locate precisely any particular township by a simple\r\ndescription: e.g., township 5 north, Range VIII east of the first\r\nPrincipal Meridian.\r\n\r\nSince the eastern and western boundaries of townships are meridians,\r\nthey approach nearer to each other as they go farther north. Hence the\r\ntownships become less than six miles from east to west as the survey\r\nproceeds northward from any base line. This necessitates the running of\r\nstandard parallel lines, or correction lines, at frequent intervals, to\r\nbe used as new base lines (Figure 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1]\r\n\r\nTo still further facilitate the sale and description of lands, the law\r\nprovides for exact methods of subdividing the township into sections,\r\none mile square, numbered as in Figure 2.\r\n\r\nEach section is subdivided into rectangular tracts known as halves,\r\nquarters, half-quarters, and quarter-quarters. The designations of these\r\ndivisions are by abbreviations and fractions. (See Figure 3.) The number\r\nof acres in each tract is easily computed.\r\n\r\nThe rectangular system of survey has been a great aid in the subdivision\r\nand location of farm lands; it greatly reduces the number of boundary\r\ndisputes, it determines very largely the location of country roads.\r\nMoreover, the Congressional township has become, in a great many\r\ninstances, the area within which the political township or town has been\r\norganized. This town, however, need not coincide with the Congressional\r\ntownship; it may be greater or smaller in area.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Six MILES SQUARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n|----------------------------|\r\n| 6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  1 |\r\n|----------------------------|\r\n| 7 |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |\r\n|----------------------------|\r\n|18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 |\r\n|----------------------------|\r\n|19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 |\r\n|----------------------------|\r\n|30 | 29 | 28 | 27 | 26 | 25 |\r\n|----------------------------|\r\n|31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 |\r\n|----------------------------|\r\n\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--One mile square\r\n\r\n\r\n|------------------------------|\r\n|             | N 1/2 NE 1/4   |\r\n|   NW 1/4    |----------------|\r\n|             |       | SE 1/4 |\r\n|             |       | NE 1/4 |\r\n|------------------------------|\r\n|                              |\r\n|           S 1/2              |\r\n|                              |\r\n|------------------------------|\r\n\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

It now\r\nremains to consider, briefly, the methods of amending the Constitution\r\nand a few other provisions found in the amendments. Article V provides\r\nfor amendments as follows:--\r\n\r\n_The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it\r\nnecessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the\r\napplication of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several States,\r\nshall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case,\r\nshall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this\r\nConstitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the\r\nseveral States, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one\r\nor the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress;\r\nprovided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one\r\nthousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first\r\nand fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that\r\nno State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage\r\nin the Senate_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: For Amendment XI, see p. 160; for Amendment XII, see p.\r\n119.]\r\n\r\nThus, amendments may be proposed in either of two ways: by a vote of\r\ntwo-thirds of both houses of Congress; or by a National convention\r\ncalled by Congress for that purpose on the application of two-thirds of\r\nthe State legislatures. The convention method has never been used in\r\nproposing amendments to this Constitution.\r\n\r\nAmendments may also be ratified in two ways: by the legislatures in\r\nthree-fourths of the several States; or by conventions in three-fourths\r\nthereof. Congress has always selected the first of these methods.\r\n\r\nAmending the Constitution Difficult.--That it is difficult to amend\r\nthe Constitution may be seen when we consider that some two thousand\r\namendments have been proposed in an official way. During a single\r\nsession of the Fifty-seventh Congress, fifty amendments, on twenty\r\ndifferent phases of government, were proposed in one or other of the\r\nhouses of Congress.\r\n\r\nAmendment XIII.--The purpose of the first ten amendments has\r\nalready been noted on p. 112.\r\n\r\nThe Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments were the results of\r\nnegro slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation granted freedom to all of\r\nthe slaves in the States then in rebellion. There were some States,\r\nhowever, as Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri, where slavery might still\r\nexist legally. In order to be rid of this institution altogether,\r\nCongress proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n_Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\r\ncrime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist\r\nwithin the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction._\r\n\r\n_Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\r\nlegislation._\r\n\r\nIt was declared a part of the Constitution, December 18, 1865.\r\n\r\nAmendment XIV.--This amendment was proposed by Congress, June 16,\r\n1866, as a part of the general plan for reconstruction. The Southern\r\nStates were not to be regarded as a part of the Union until they should\r\nratify it. The entire amendment, given in Appendix A, should be read.\r\nSections 1 and 2, however, contain the most important provisions.\r\nSection 1 has already been partially discussed on p. 95, under the\r\nquestion, \"Who are citizens?\" Section 2 has also been considered on p.\r\n54, in connection with the apportionment of representatives.\r\n\r\nCongress has at different times removed the disabilities from certain of\r\nthe classes mentioned in Section 3. Finally, an act of June 6, 1898,\r\nremoved the last disability imposed by this section.\r\n\r\nAmendment XV.--In order to secure full political rights for the\r\nnegroes, the Fifteenth Amendment was passed, as indicated on p. 51.\r\n\r\n_The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied\r\nor abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of race,\r\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude._\r\n\r\n_The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\r\nlegislation._\r\n\r\nAmendment XVI.--_The Congress shall have power to lay or collect\r\ntaxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment\r\namong the several States, and without regard to any census or\r\nenumeration_.\r\n\r\nThis amendment, which provides for the laying of an income tax, was\r\nadopted by the thirty-sixth legislature, the requisite three-fourths, on\r\nFebruary 3, 1913. It was hoped that the money supplied from this tax\r\nwould make up for any loss of revenue due to the reduction of tariff\r\nduties. The new tax will affect those whose yearly incomes are in excess\r\nof a certain line of exemption.\r\n\r\nAmendment XVII.--_The Senate of the United States shall be composed\r\nof two senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six\r\nyears; and each senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State\r\nshall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most\r\nnumerous branch of the State legislature_.\r\n\r\n_When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate\r\nthe executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to\r\nfill such vacancies. Provided, that the legislature of any State may\r\nempower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the\r\npeople fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct_.\r\n\r\n_This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or\r\nterm of any senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the\r\nConstitution_.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

The real\r\nnature of our republic may be made more apparent by a comparison of our\r\nsystem with that of other republics, and with the governments of certain\r\ngreat monarchies.\r\n\r\nOur Federal Republic.--It has been emphasized in the course of our\r\nstudy that the States are important parts in the political system which\r\nwe call the Republic of the United States. The States are not mere\r\nadministrative divisions of the nation; they do not stand in the same\r\nrelation to the National government that counties bear to the State.\r\nThey do not derive their powers from the National government; nor, on\r\nthe other hand, does the latter derive its powers from the States. The\r\nsource of power for both is the same--\"the people themselves, as an\r\norganized body politic.\" The United States is, then, a _Federal\r\nRepublic_. It is essential to understand that, in the division of powers\r\nbetween States and nation, the latter is sovereign over the matters that\r\nare placed within its jurisdiction; but it is a feature of our system\r\nno less essential (though less clearly understood by the people) that\r\nthe States are as completely sovereign over matters that lie within\r\ntheir control.\r\n\r\nFrance a Centralized Republic.--In France we find an entirely\r\ndifferent type of republic--not federal, but centralized. France is\r\ndivided into eighty-six departments, which correspond in some respects\r\nto our States. But in their relation to the central government the\r\ndifference is very striking; for the departments are merely\r\nadministrative divisions of the central government. They are completely\r\nsubject to the national government. The chief authority in each\r\ndepartment is a prefect, who is appointed by the ministry of France (the\r\ncentral executive body) and is responsible to it. There is a legislative\r\nbody in each department, called the general council, but the powers of\r\nthis body are very much restricted.\r\n\r\nThe national government of France exercises legislative authority upon\r\nmany subjects in the departments, and it administers the laws directly.\r\nConsequently, the people's powers of local self-government are very much\r\nless extensive than those enjoyed by the people in the United States.\r\nThere result in France much greater uniformity of legislation and more\r\neffective administration; while in many parts of the United States local\r\nself-government results in corrupt laws and wasteful administration. But\r\nwe believe that the people will become educated in the use of political\r\npower if the responsibility for its use rests upon them, rather than\r\nupon some central authority.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Republic.--An example of a federal republic is the\r\ngovernment of Switzerland. Here the cantons correspond to our States,\r\nand each canton has control over its own local affairs, without\r\ninterference from the federal government. The chief features of the\r\nFrench and the Swiss governments are indicated in the accompanying\r\noutline:[62]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Among the South American republics, Brazil, Mexico, and\r\nArgentine Republic are federal in nature, like the United States and\r\nSwitzerland.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES          SWITZERLAND            FRANCE\r\n\r\n_Congress            Federal Assembly       The Chambers_\r\n_ Senate               State Council          Senate_\r\nTwo members from    Two members from      300 members elected\r\n  each state          each canton          by an electoral college\r\n  Six years                                in each department\r\n\r\n_House of             National Council      Chamber of Deputies_\r\n_Representatives_\r\n433 members elected    147 members elected   591 deputies elected\r\n  by people              by people               by people\r\nTwo years              Three years            Four years\r\n\r\n_President            President                President_\r\nElected by electors,    Elected by Federal      Elected by National\r\n i.e., by the              Assembly              Assembly; i.e.\r\npeople of the States      One year                Senate and Chamber\r\n  Four years                                      of Deputies in joint\r\n                                                   session\r\n                                                  Seven years\r\n\r\n_Cabinet                Federal Council           Ministry_\r\nNine members appointed     Seven members      Twelve members appointed\r\nby President             elected by Federal      by President\r\nand Senate                 Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitutional Monarchies--Monarchies are classified as (1)\r\nconstitutional and (2) absolute. In constitutional monarchies the ruler\r\nholds his position by heredity, but there exists also a constitution,\r\nwhich defines the distribution of powers among the branches that compose\r\nthe government and fixes the limits of authority vested in each. The\r\nBritish constitution is partly written, as found in the great historical\r\ndocuments of English history, such as Magna Charta (1215), the Petition\r\nof Right (1628), and the Bill of Rights (1689);[63] and partly\r\nunwritten, consisting of precedents and customs which are recognized as\r\nauthoritative. The constitutions of the other monarchies of Europe were\r\nmade during the nineteenth century, and consequently they are younger\r\nthan that of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Compare the \"Bill of Rights\" in our Constitution; see pp.\r\n256-260.]\r\n\r\nIn all the constitutional monarchies we find legislative bodies similar\r\nto our Congress. In every case the lower house is elected by the\r\nvoters;[64] in England, the Austrian Empire, Italy, and Spain a number\r\nof the members of the upper house hold their position by hereditary\r\nright. In respect to legislation, therefore, the constitutional\r\nmonarchies are all more or less republican in principle; that is, they\r\nall recognize the supreme authority of the people acting through their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Property qualifications for suffrage are common in\r\nEuropean countries.]\r\n\r\nAn absolute monarchy is one in which the authority of the ruler is not\r\nheld in check by a constitution or by a body of men elected by the\r\npeople. No civilized country now has this form of government. Until\r\nrecently there existed in Europe two absolute monarchies--Russia and\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet System of Government.--In the relations existing\r\nbetween their legislative and executive departments, the European\r\ngovernments differ considerably from that of the United States. In our\r\ngovernment we find, in theory at least, that these departments are\r\nseparated; in the European governments there is a close relation of the\r\nlegislative and executive branches, through some form of \"cabinet\r\nresponsibility.\" This \"cabinet system\" of government is found in the\r\nrepublics as well as in the constitutional monarchies of Europe, and in\r\nthe self-governing British possessions, such as Canada and the\r\nAustralian colonies.[67] The difference between the congressional and\r\nthe cabinet systems is greater in appearance than in reality; for in the\r\nUnited States the President and his Cabinet exert considerable influence\r\nupon legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND                          GERMANY\r\n\r\nMonarch--hereditary in the       Emperor--hereditary\r\nline fixed by Parliament         King of Prussia\r\n\r\n_Cabinet_                   _Ministry_\r\nNineteen members[65] chosen by   Eight ministers, Chancellor at\r\nthe Prime minister               the head, appointed by the\r\n                                 Emperor\r\n\r\n_Parliament_                _Parliament_\r\nLimit of term, seven years       Term, five years\r\n\r\n_House of Lords_            _Bundesrath or General Council_\r\n586 members, holding seats       58 members appointed by the\r\n(1) by heredity, (2) by          German States\r\nappointment by crown,\r\n(3) by election[66]\r\n\r\n_House of Commons_          _Reichstag or Diet of the Realm_\r\n670 members elected by the       397 members elected by the\r\npeople of England, Scotland,     people\r\nand Ireland\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: The number of members in the ministries of England and\r\nGermany varies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Irish peers are elected for life, and Scottish peers are\r\nelected for the duration of a Parliament.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: This system finds its best illustration in the English\r\ngovernment, of which a brief description will be found in \"Government in\r\nState and Nation,\" pp. 157-160. For references, see questions 14 and 15,\r\np. 161.]\r\n\r\nThe Form and the Spirit of Government.--The study of other\r\ngovernments and the comparison of them with our own will teach us that\r\nthe virtue of a government resides, not in its framework, but in its\r\nspirit. A government may be monarchical in form and republican in its\r\npractical workings. In England, and in others of the European\r\nmonarchies, the will of the people is the law of the land. On the other\r\nhand, a government may be republican in form, and very unrepublican in\r\nits methods of operation. There are cities and States in our country\r\nwhere one man, the political boss, or a group of men, the political\r\nmachine, dictates the course of legislation and controls the\r\nadministration of the law. Here we find, in reality, not republican\r\ngovernments, but despotisms or oligarchies.\r\n\r\nThe final test of a government is found in the responsiveness of the\r\ngoverning authorities to the will of the majority of the people.\r\nWherever republican institutions are found, whether in republics or in\r\nmonarchies, the people may rule if they will. Monarchical and\r\naristocratic institutions do not in our time stand long in opposition to\r\na determined public opinion; and, on the other hand, a framework of\r\nrepublican institutions will not insure the execution of the popular\r\nwill. This can only be secured where high-minded citizens are vigilant\r\nin the performance of their political duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n1.

All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a\r\nCongress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nSECT. II. 1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of members\r\nchosen every second year by the people of the several States, and the\r\nelectors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for\r\nelectors of the most numerous branch of the State Legislature.\r\n\r\n2. No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to\r\nthe age of twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the\r\nUnited States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that\r\nState in which he shall be chosen.\r\n\r\n3. Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the\r\nseveral States which may be included within this Union, according to\r\ntheir respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the\r\nwhole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a\r\nterm of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all\r\nother persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years\r\nafter the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within\r\nevery subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law\r\ndirect. The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every\r\nthirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one representative;\r\nand until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire\r\nshall be entitled to choose three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and\r\nProvidence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey\r\nfour, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten,\r\nNorth Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.\r\n\r\n4.

The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other\r\nofficers; and shall have the sole power of impeachment.\r\n\r\nSECT. III. 1. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two\r\nSenators from each State, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six\r\nyears; and each Senator shall have one vote. (See Amendment XVII.)\r\n\r\n2. Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first\r\nelection, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes.\r\nThe seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the\r\nexpiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of\r\nthe fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth\r\nyear, so that one third may be chosen every second year; and if\r\nvacancies happen by resignation or otherwise, during the recess of the\r\nlegislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary\r\nappointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then\r\nfill such vacancies. (See Amendment XVII.)\r\n\r\n3. No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age\r\nof thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and\r\nwho shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State for which he\r\nshall be chosen.\r\n\r\n4. The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of the\r\nSenate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.\r\n\r\n5. The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also a President\r\n_pro tempore_, in the absence of the Vice-President, or when he shall\r\nexercise the office of President of the United States.\r\n\r\n6. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When\r\nsitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the\r\nPresident of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall\r\npreside: and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two\r\nthirds of the members present.\r\n\r\n7. Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to\r\nremoval from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office\r\nof honor, trust or profit under the United States: but the party\r\nconvicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial,\r\njudgment and punishment, according to law.\r\n\r\nSECT. IV. 1. The times, places and manner of holding elections for\r\nSenators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the\r\nlegislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or\r\nalter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators.\r\n(See Amendment XVII.)\r\n\r\n2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such\r\nmeeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by\r\nlaw appoint a different day.\r\n\r\nSECT. V. 1. Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and\r\nqualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall\r\nconstitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn\r\nfrom day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of\r\nabsent members, in such manner, and under such penalties, as each house\r\nmay provide.\r\n\r\n2. Each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its\r\nmembers for disorderly behavior, and with the concurrence of two thirds,\r\nexpel a member.\r\n\r\n3. Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to\r\ntime publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment\r\nrequire secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either house on\r\nany question shall, at the desire of one fifth of those present, be\r\nentered on the journal.\r\n\r\n4. Neither house, during the session of Congress, shall, without the\r\nconsent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other\r\nplace than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.\r\n\r\nSECT. VI. 1. The Senators and Representatives shall receive a\r\ncompensation for their services, to be ascertained by law and paid out\r\nof the treasury of the United States. They shall in all cases except\r\ntreason, felony and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest\r\nduring their attendance at the session of their respective houses, and\r\nin going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in\r\neither house, they shall not be questioned in any other place.\r\n\r\n2. No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he was\r\nelected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the\r\nUnited States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof\r\nshall have been increased, during such time; and no person holding any\r\noffice under the United States shall be a member of either house during\r\nhis continuance in office.\r\n\r\nSECT. VII. 1. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House\r\nof Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments\r\nas on other bills.\r\n\r\n2. Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and\r\nthe Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President\r\nof the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he\r\nshall return it with his objections to that house in which it shall have\r\noriginated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal,\r\nand proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two thirds\r\nof that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together\r\nwith the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be\r\nreconsidered, and, if approved by two thirds of that house, it shall\r\nbecome a law. But in all such cases the votes of both houses shall be\r\ndetermined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and\r\nagainst the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house\r\nrespectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President within\r\nten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him,\r\nthe same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless\r\nthe Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it\r\nshall not be a law.\r\n\r\n3. Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a\r\nquestion of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the\r\nUnited States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved\r\nby him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and\r\nlimitations prescribed in the case of a bill.\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII. The Congress shall have power:\r\n\r\n1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the\r\ndebts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the\r\nUnited States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform\r\nthroughout the United States;\r\n\r\n2. To borrow money on the credit of the United States;\r\n\r\n3. To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several\r\nStates, and with the Indian tribes;\r\n\r\n4.

which authority shall always\r\nbe exercised in the manner following: Whenever the legislative or\r\nexecutive authority, or lawful agent of any State in controversy with\r\nanother, shall present a petition to Congress, stating the matter in\r\nquestion, and praying for a hearing, notice thereof shall be given by\r\norder of Congress to the legislative or executive authority of the other\r\nState in controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of the\r\nparties by their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint,\r\nby joint consent, commissioners or judges to constitute a court for\r\nhearing and determining the matter in question; but if they cannot\r\nagree, Congress shall name three persons out of each of the United\r\nStates, and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately\r\nstrike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be\r\nreduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven nor more\r\nthan nine names, as Congress shall direct, shall, in the presence of\r\nCongress, be drawn out by lot; and the persons whose names shall be so\r\ndrawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges, to hear\r\nand finally determine the controversy, so always as a major part of the\r\njudges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the determination; and if\r\neither party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed, without\r\nshowing reasons which Congress shall judge sufficient, or being present,\r\nshall refuse to strike, the Congress shall proceed to nominate three\r\npersons out of each State, and the secretary of Congress shall strike in\r\nbehalf of such party absent or refusing; and the judgment and sentence\r\nof the court, to be appointed in the manner before prescribed, shall be\r\nfinal and conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit\r\nto the authority of such court, or to appear or defend their claim or\r\ncause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence or\r\njudgment, which shall in like manner be final and decisive; the judgment\r\nor sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to\r\nCongress, and lodged among the acts of Congress for the security of the\r\nparties concerned; provided, that every commissioner, before he sits in\r\njudgment, shall take an oath, to be administered by one of the judges of\r\nthe supreme or superior court of the State where the cause shall be\r\ntried, \"well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question,\r\naccording to the best of his judgment, without favor, affection, or hope\r\nof reward.\" Provided, also, that no State shall be deprived of territory\r\nfor the benefit of the United States.\r\n\r\nAll controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed under\r\ndifferent grants of two or more States, whose jurisdictions, as they may\r\nrespect such lands, and the States which passed such grants are\r\nadjusted, the said grants or either of them being at the same time\r\nclaimed to have originated antecedent to such settlement of\r\njurisdiction, shall, on the petition of either party to the Congress of\r\nthe United States, be finally determined, as near as may be, in the same\r\nmanner as is before prescribed for deciding disputes respecting\r\nterritorial jurisdiction between different States.\r\n\r\nThe United States, in Congress assembled, shall also have the sole and\r\nexclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin\r\nstruck by their own authority, or by that of the respective States;\r\nfixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the United\r\nStates; regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians,\r\nnot members of any of the States; provided that the legislative right of\r\nany State, within its own limits, be not infringed or violated;\r\nestablishing and regulating post offices from one State to another,\r\nthroughout all the United States, and exacting such postage on the\r\npapers passing through the same as may be requisite to defray the\r\nexpenses of the said office; appointing all officers of the land forces\r\nin the service of the United States, excepting regimental officers;\r\nappointing all the officers of the naval forces, and commissioning all\r\nofficers whatever in the service of the United States;

to appoint one of their number to preside; provided\r\nthat no person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than\r\none year in any term of three years; to ascertain the necessary sums of\r\nmoney to be raised for the service of the United States, and to\r\nappropriate and apply the same for defraying the public expenses;

to\r\nagree upon the number of land forces, and to make requisitions from each\r\nState for its quota, in proportion to the number of white inhabitants in\r\nsuch State, which requisition shall be binding;

and the officers and men so clothed,\r\narmed, and equipped shall march to the place appointed, and within the\r\ntime agreed on by the United States, in Congress assembled; but if the\r\nUnited States, in Congress assembled, shall, on consideration of\r\ncircumstances, judge proper that any State should not raise men, or\r\nshould raise a smaller number than its quota, and that any other State\r\nshould raise a greater number of men than the quota thereof, such extra\r\nnumber shall be raised, officered, clothed, armed, and equipped in the\r\nsame manner as the quota of such State, unless the Legislature of such\r\nState shall judge that such extra number cannot be safely spared out of\r\nthe same, in which case they shall raise, officer, clothe, arm, and\r\nequip as many of such extra number as they judge can be safely spared,\r\nand the officers and men so clothed, armed, and equipped shall march to\r\nthe place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States,\r\nin Congress assembled.\r\n\r\nThe United States, in Congress assembled, shall never engage in a war,\r\nnor grant letters of marque and reprisal in time of peace, nor enter\r\ninto any treaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor regulate the value\r\nthereof, nor ascertain the sums and expenses necessary for the defense\r\nand welfare of the United States, or any of them, nor emit bills, nor\r\nborrow money on the credit of the United States, nor appropriate money,\r\nnor agree upon the number of vessels of war to be built or purchased, or\r\nthe number of land or sea forces to be raised, nor appoint a commander\r\nin chief of the army or navy, unless nine States assent to the same, nor\r\nshall a question on any other point, except for adjourning from day to\r\nday, be determined, unless by the votes of a majority of the United\r\nStates, in Congress assembled.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States shall have power to adjourn to any\r\ntime within the year, and to any place within the United States, so that\r\nno period of adjournment be for a longer duration than the space of six\r\nmonths, and shall publish the journal of their proceedings monthly,\r\nexcept such parts thereof relating to treaties, alliances, or military\r\noperations as in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays\r\nof the delegates of each State, on any question, shall be entered on the\r\njournal when it is desired by any delegate; and the delegates of a\r\nState, or any of them, at his or their request, shall be furnished with\r\na transcript of the said journal except such parts as are above\r\nexcepted, to lay before the Legislatures of the several States.\r\n\r\nART. X.--The Committee of the States, or any nine of them, shall be\r\nauthorized to execute, in the recess of Congress, such of the powers of\r\nCongress as the United States, in Congress assembled, by the consent of\r\nnine States, shall, from time to time, think expedient to vest them\r\nwith; provided that no power be delegated to the said Committee, for the\r\nexercise of which, by the Articles of Confederation, the voice of nine\r\nStates in the Congress of the United States assembled is requisite.\r\n\r\nART. XI.--Canada, acceding to this Confederation, and joining in the\r\nmeasures of the United States shall be admitted into, and entitled to\r\nall the advantages of this Union; but no other colony shall be admitted\r\ninto the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.\r\n\r\nART. XII.--All bills of credit emitted, moneys borrowed, and debts\r\ncontracted by or under the authority of Congress, before the assembling\r\nof the United States, in pursuance of the present Confederation, shall\r\nbe deemed and considered as a charge against the United States, for\r\npayment and satisfaction whereof the said United States and the public\r\nfaith are hereby solemnly pledged.\r\n\r\nART. XIII.--Every State shall abide by the determinations of the United\r\nStates, in Congress assembled, on all questions which by this\r\nConfederation are submitted to them. And the Articles of this\r\nConfederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union\r\nshall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be\r\nmade in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress\r\nof the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of\r\nevery State.\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS it hath pleased the great Governor of the world to incline\r\nthe hearts of the Legislatures we respectively represent in Congress to\r\napprove of, and to authorize us to ratify, the said Articles of\r\nConfederation and perpetual Union, know ye, that we, the undersigned\r\ndelegates, by virtue of the power and authority to us given for that\r\npurpose, do, by these presents, in the name and in behalf of our\r\nrespective constituents, fully and entirely ratify and confirm each and\r\nevery of the said Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union, and all\r\nand singular the matters and things therein contained.

Worlton\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Schools, Sugar City\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1907, By\r\n\r\nCharles Scribner's Sons\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL\r\nFORM OF GOVERNMENT\r\nDEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT\r\nSCHOOLS\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF IDAHO.\r\nHISTORICAL.\r\n\r\nThe country out of which Idaho was created, known as a part of the\r\nOregon Country, was acquired by treaty with England in 1846. Long before\r\nthis date, however, trappers, hunters, explorers, and sturdy pioneers\r\nhad found their way across the Rocky Mountains into the fertile valleys\r\ndrained by the tributaries of the Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe earliest white men in this region were undoubtedly the half-breed\r\nFrench-Canadian voyageurs and the trappers of the Hudson Bay Company,\r\nwho opened the trails through all the great wilderness of the Pacific\r\nNorthwest; but the honor of revealing to the world the first impressions\r\nof the natural beauty and boundless resources of this new country west\r\nof the Rockies rests with Lewis and Clark, who crossed the State on\r\ntheir voyage of exploration and discovery in August, 1805. They found\r\nthe Indians in possession of articles of European manufacture which had\r\nbeen obtained from the trappers of the Hudson Bay Company.\r\n\r\nThe first white settlement in Idaho of which we have record was\r\nestablished in 1834 at Fort Hall, Bannock County. This fort was\r\nimportant in early Idaho history, being at the crossing of the\r\nMissouri-Oregon and the Utah-Canadian trails.\r\n\r\nFort Boise, established in 1836 near the junction of the Snake and\r\nBoise rivers, was a rendezvous for thousands of Indians, who gathered\r\nfrom all the country between the Pacific coast and the head waters of\r\nthe Missouri River to trade and barter in horses, furs, and articles of\r\nadornment.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in 1860 at a point on the Clear Water River in\r\nnorthern Idaho was followed by a vast immigration to that section; this\r\nled to the discovery of gold in other parts of the territory, and soon\r\nthe placer mines in the vicinity of Boise and other places were\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe territory of Idaho, comprising what is now Montana, Wyoming, and\r\nIdaho, was organized by the Federal Government, March 3, 1863, and\r\nLewiston was made the temporary capital of the territory.\r\n\r\nThe placer mines of the Boise Basin proved richer than those of the\r\nnorth, and the bulk of the population rapidly drifted southward. This\r\nshifting of population caused the removal of the State capital to its\r\npresent location at Boise in 1864.\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress creating the territories of Montana and Wyoming,\r\nIdaho was reduced to its present boundaries in 1868.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, 1890, Idaho passed from a territorial form of government to\r\nthat of a state, being the forty-third State to join the great Federal\r\nUnion. Since that time her growth and development have been continuous\r\nand rapid.\r\n\r\nMining, lumbering, manufacturing, and agricultural pursuits are the\r\nprincipal resources of the State.\r\n\r\nFORM OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the State of Idaho, like those of the other states\r\nin the Union, is modeled after the Constitution of the United States. It\r\ncontains:\r\n\r\nA Preamble, setting forth the purposes of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nA Declaration, called the Bill of Rights, containing twenty-one\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nProvision for dividing the powers of government into three departments.\r\n\r\nArticles relating to taxation, suffrage, public schools, corporations,\r\nmilitia, immigration, labor, amendments, and other public affairs.\r\n\r\nPreamble.--\"We, the people of the State of Idaho, grateful to\r\nAlmighty God for our freedom, to secure its blessings and promote our\r\ncommon welfare, do establish this constitution.\"\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Rights.--The Bill of Rights is a declaration of\r\nprivileges retained by the people, which the departments of government\r\nare expressly prohibited from invading. The most important provisions in\r\nthe Bill of Rights may be classed under the following headings:\r\ndemocratic principles; personal security; private property; freedom of\r\nreligion, speech, and of the press; and security against military\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nDemocratic Principles.--All men are equal before the law, and are\r\nprotected in the enjoyment of life, property, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nAll power is inherent in the people.\r\n\r\nPersonal Security.--The people have the right to bear arms for\r\ntheir safety and defense, but this privilege is regulated by appropriate\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and other\r\npossessions against unreasonable searches and seizures.\r\n\r\nThere shall be no imprisonment for debt except in cases of fraud.\r\n\r\nPrivate Property.--Private property shall not be taken for public use\r\nexcept a necessity therefore exists, and then only after just\r\ncompensation has been paid.\r\n\r\nReligion.--The free exercise and enjoyment of religious faith and\r\nworship shall forever be guaranteed.\r\n\r\nNo religious test shall be required for holding public office.\r\n\r\nFreedom of Speech and of the Press.--Every person may freely speak,\r\nwrite, and publish on any subject, but he is held responsible for the\r\nabuse of that liberty,\r\n\r\nFreedom of Meeting.--The people shall have the right to assemble\r\nand consult for their common good, and may petition the Legislature for\r\nredress of grievances.\r\n\r\nSecurity Against Military Tyranny.--Soldiers shall not be quartered\r\nin private houses in times of peace without the consent of the owner,\r\nnor in times of war except as the law may provide.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that the State government as well as the\r\nNational is planned on the accepted fact that all power originates with\r\nthe people. In America the people have the divine right to rule. The\r\npeople possess all rights which they have not expressly given to the\r\ngovernment. The Bill of Rights which we have discussed is therefore a\r\ndouble safeguard which the people have thrown about their sacred\r\ninalienable rights.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nGovernment consists essentially in making, judging, and enforcing the\r\nlaws. In absolute monarchical forms of government, of which Russia and\r\nTurkey are examples, these three departments are vested in the same\r\nhead; but in republics and limited monarchies the law-making,\r\nlaw-judging, and law-enforcing powers are separated. History has proved\r\nthat the separation of these three powers of government is most\r\nsatisfactory for an enlightened people.\r\n\r\nLegislative Department.--The legislative or law-making power of the\r\nState is vested in a Legislature which is composed of a Senate and a\r\nHouse of Representatives. The sessions of the two houses are open to the\r\npublic and each house keeps a journal of its proceedings in which is\r\nrecorded the yea and nay votes on any question at the request of any\r\nthree members.\r\n\r\nQualifications of Members.--The qualifications of a senator or\r\nrepresentative in the State of Idaho are the same. He must be a citizen\r\nof the United States, an elector of the State, and he must have been an\r\nelector for at least one year next preceding his election in the county\r\nfrom which he is chosen.\r\n\r\nSessions.--The Legislature meets biennially at the State Capital,\r\ncommencing on the first Monday after the first day of January in the odd\r\nyears. Special sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor\r\nwhen he deems it necessary. No special session shall continue for more\r\nthan twenty days.\r\n\r\nThe compensation of our legislators is five dollars per day, with an\r\nallowance of ten cents per mile going to and returning from the place of\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nPrivileges.--Members of the State Legislature are not liable to any\r\ncivil process during the session of the Legislature nor during the ten\r\ndays next preceding the same. They are privileged from arrest during the\r\nsame time in all cases except treason, felony, or breach of the peace.\r\nThey cannot be legally called to account for anything said in debate\r\nduring the session of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nSenate.--According to the State Constitution the membership of the\r\nSenate is limited to twenty-four members. Each county is a senatorial\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe term of office is two years and begins on the first day of December\r\nfollowing the election. The Senate adopts its own rules of government\r\nand elects its own officers, with the exception of its president, who\r\nis the Lieutenant-Governor ex-officio. In case the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nassumes the duties of Governor, the Senate elects its presiding officer.\r\nAll State officers appointed by the Governor are subject to the approval\r\nof the Senate. If the Senate is not in session when the appointment is\r\nmade, such person shall discharge the duties of the office until the\r\nnext session of the Senate. In the case of impeachment of State officers\r\nthe Senate is the court. A majority of the senators is a quorum for the\r\ntrial of impeachment, and a two-thirds vote is necessary for conviction.\r\nIn case of conviction the penalty does not extend further than removal\r\nfrom office, but such person may be tried in the civil courts as other\r\nlawbreakers.\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives.--The House of Representatives is a more\r\nnumerous body than the Senate. The members are elected for the same time\r\nand for the same term as the senators. The House of Representatives has\r\npower to choose all its officers. The special powers exercised by the\r\nHouse of Representatives are: originating bills for raising revenue and\r\nmaking appropriations, and in impeaching State officers.\r\n\r\nExecutive Department.--After the laws are made it becomes necessary\r\nto designate some one to see that they are enforced. The legislators\r\nmake the laws, and it remains for the officers in the Executive\r\nDepartment to see that the laws are enforced.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Department consists of a Governor, Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nSecretary of State, State Auditor, State Treasurer, Attorney General,\r\nand Superintendent of Public Instruction, all of whom hold their offices\r\nfor two years, beginning on the first Monday in January next after their\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nQualifications.--No person is eligible to the office of Governor,\r\nLieutenant-Governor, or Attorney General unless he has attained the age\r\nof thirty years, nor to the other executive offices unless he is\r\ntwenty-five years of age. The Constitution provides that all the\r\nexecutive officers shall be citizens of the United States and shall have\r\nresided in the State two years next preceding their election, and that\r\nthe Attorney General must have been admitted to practice in the Supreme\r\nCourt of the State.\r\n\r\nGovernor.--The Governor is commander-in-chief of the military\r\nforces of the State and may call out the entire State militia to aid in\r\nthe enforcement of the law. He may require in writing from the officers\r\nof the Executive Department information upon any subject relating to\r\ntheir respective departments.\r\n\r\nAll acts passed by the State Legislature are presented to the Governor\r\nfor his approval and signature. If he signs a bill it becomes law; if he\r\ndisapproves it, he returns it to the house in which it originated, with\r\nhis objections, which are entered on the journal of that house. The bill\r\nis then reconsidered, and if approved by a two-thirds majority is sent\r\nwith the Governor's objections to the other house, which also\r\nreconsiders it, and if approved by a two-thirds vote in that house it\r\nbecomes a law over the Governor's objections.\r\n\r\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the Legislature within five\r\ndays (Sunday or adjournment excepted) it becomes a law without his\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nIf the Governor disapproves a bill and the adjournment of the\r\nLegislature prevents its return, he must file it with his objections in\r\nthe office of the Secretary of State within ten days after such\r\nadjournment; otherwise it becomes a law.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, by and with the consent of the Senate, appoints members to\r\nfill vacancies which may occur by death, resignation, or otherwise in\r\nthe State offices. He also has the power to make appointments to all\r\noffices whose appointment or election is not otherwise provided for.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Governor.--The Lieutenant-Governor is the only executive\r\nofficer whose residence at the State Capital is not required by law. In\r\ncase of a vacancy in the office of Governor by death, resignation, or\r\notherwise, the Lieutenant-Governor becomes Governor and takes up his\r\nresidence at the State Capital. The only duty of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, when not called upon to act as Governor, is that of\r\npresiding officer of the Senate.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State.--The Secretary of State is the custodian of The\r\nGreat Seal of the State of Idaho, and all State papers. He records the\r\nproceedings and acts of the Legislature and also of the executive\r\ndepartments of the State government. He is a member of the Board of\r\nPardons, of the Board of State Prison Commissioners, and of the State\r\nLand Board.\r\n\r\nAuditor.--The Auditor is the financial guardian of the State. He\r\nis a member of the auditing committee which passes on all claims against\r\nthe State. The Auditor receives all moneys paid the State, and deposits\r\nthe same with the State Treasurer, taking receipt therefore. Money is\r\npaid out of the treasury only by warrant issued by the Auditor.\r\n\r\nThe Auditor makes a regular report of the financial condition of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nTreasurer.--The Treasurer, who is under heavy bonds for the\r\nperformance of his duties, is the custodian of the funds of the State.\r\nHe receives the State's revenues from the Auditor and pays out money\r\nonly by warrant issued by the Auditor.\r\n\r\nAttorney General.--The Attorney General is the legal adviser of the\r\nState officers and acts as attorney for the State in all cases in which\r\nthe State is a party. He represents the State in all its legal business.\r\nHis office is one of dignity and responsibility.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction.--The Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction has charge of the public-school system of the State. He\r\nprepares all examination questions used by the County Superintendents of\r\nthe State and prescribes rules and regulations for conducting such\r\nexaminations. It is his duty to meet with the County Superintendents\r\nfrom time to time to discuss questions for the general welfare of the\r\npublic schools of the State. He is an ex-officio member of the Board of\r\nTrustees of the Lewiston and Albion Normal Schools, the Academy of\r\nIdaho, the State Industrial School, and the State Land Board.\r\n\r\nJudicial Department.--It is the special function of the Judicial\r\nDepartment to interpret and explain the laws. The judicial power is\r\nvested in a court for trial of impeachments, a supreme court, district\r\ncourts, probate courts, courts of justices of the peace, and municipal\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nThe court for the trial of impeachments is the State Senate, whose\r\nfunctions as a court of justice are outlined under the head of\r\nLegislative Department.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court.--The Supreme Court is composed of three judges\r\nelected from the State at large for a term of six years. It is so\r\narranged that one judge goes out of office each two years, thus leaving\r\na majority of members at all times with over two years' experience in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has jurisdiction both original and appellate. Its\r\noriginal jurisdiction consists in issuing writs of mandamus, certiorari,\r\nprohibition, and habeas corpus. Its appellate jurisdiction extends to\r\npractically all cases tried in the lower courts.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution requires the Supreme Court to hold annually at least\r\nfour terms of court: two at Boise, the capital, and two at Lewiston.\r\n\r\nThe compensation allowed justices of the Supreme Court is four thousand\r\ndollars per year, but they are not permitted to hold any other public\r\noffice during the term for which they are elected.\r\n\r\nThe District Court.--It is in the District Court that the great\r\nbody of criminal cases are disposed of. This court has original\r\njurisdiction in all cases arising in the district, and its appellate\r\njurisdiction includes all cases which may be appealed to it from the\r\nprobate or justice courts.\r\n\r\nThe State of Idaho is divided into six judicial districts. The District\r\nCourt is presided over by a judge whose legal qualifications do not\r\ndiffer materially from those of the justices of the Supreme Court. Two\r\nterms of court must be held in each county of the district annually, and\r\nspecial sessions may be held at the option of the judge. The judge must\r\nlive in the district for which he is elected, but may try cases in any\r\ncounty of the State at the request of the judge of the District Court\r\nthereof who may be disqualified because of his personal or pecuniary\r\ninterest in the case. The salary paid the judge of the District Court is\r\nthree thousand dollars per year.\r\n\r\nProbate Courts.--The Probate Court is essentially a court of record\r\nand has original jurisdiction in all matters of probate. It is in this\r\ncourt that settlement is made of the estate of deceased persons and that\r\nguardians are appointed. The Probate Court may try all civil cases\r\nwherein the debt or damage claimed does not exceed five hundred dollars;\r\nits jurisdiction in criminal cases is concurrent with that of justices\r\nof the peace.\r\n\r\nCourt of Justice of the Peace.--Every county is divided into\r\nprecincts, in each one of which there is a Justice of the Peace. He has\r\njurisdiction in all civil cases arising in his district wherein the\r\namount in consideration is not more than three hundred dollars and in\r\ncases classed as misdemeanors.\r\n\r\nThere are also police courts in cities for the trial of the violators of\r\nthe city ordinances. The presiding officers of such courts are called\r\npolice judges.\r\n\r\nAmendments.--Amendments to the Constitution may be submitted in two\r\nways: first, by being proposed by two-thirds of both houses of the\r\nLegislature; second, by being proposed by a convention called for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe amendment thus submitted must be approved by the people at a popular\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State of Idaho supports the following educational institutions:\r\nState University, State Normal Schools at Lewiston and Albion, Academy\r\nof Idaho at Pocatello, and the Industrial School at St. Anthony. Each of\r\nthese institutions is governed by a board of trustees appointed by the\r\nGovernor for a term of years. The boards have the general management of\r\nthe schools. They build and furnish school buildings, employ and dismiss\r\nteachers and employees, prescribe the course of study and the conditions\r\nunder which students are admitted to the respective institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Governor is kept well informed on the conditions of the various\r\ninstitutions by regular reports which he requires of the several boards\r\nof trustees. The reports set forth a detailed account of all\r\nexpenditures for the two years just closing and make an estimate of the\r\namount of funds needed for the maintenance of the institution for two\r\nyears hence.\r\n\r\nEach school is supported by biennial appropriations made by the State\r\nLegislature and by funds received as interest on money derived from the\r\nsale of public lands set aside by the State or National Government for\r\ntheir use.\r\n\r\nThe amount of land set aside for the use of the State educational\r\ninstitutions is as follows: State University, including School of\r\nScience and Agricultural College, 286,000 acres; Lewiston Normal, 50,000\r\nacres; Albion Normal, 50,000 acres; Academy of Idaho, 40,000 acres;\r\nIndustrial Reform School, 40,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe State University at Moscow stands at the head of the educational\r\ninstitutions of the State. There are three principal departments in the\r\nuniversity. In the Department of Letters and Sciences the courses lead\r\nto degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of\r\nMusic. In the Department of Agriculture the course leads to a degree of\r\nBachelor of Science in Agriculture. In connection with the Agricultural\r\nCourse is kept a model farm of one hundred acres and an experiment\r\nstation in which laboratories are provided for soil physics, chemistry,\r\nentomology, and botany. In the Department of Applied Science courses are\r\ngiven in civil engineering, mining engineering, and in electrical and\r\nmechanical engineering.\r\n\r\nThe University was established at Moscow by special act of the\r\nTerritorial Legislature in 1889, and since that date it has had a\r\nsplendid growth. It is well equipped in apparatus necessary for the\r\npursuit of the courses given.\r\n\r\nThe State Normal Schools.--As an evidence of the fact that the framers\r\nof our State government had in mind a liberal education for the youth of\r\nour State 100,000 acres of public land was set apart for the maintenance\r\nof normal schools, with the provision that none of this land must be\r\nsold for less than ten dollars per acre.\r\n\r\nThe second State Legislature established in 1893 two State Normal\r\nSchools, one at Lewiston and one at Albion. The purpose of these\r\nschools, as set forth in the acts which created them, is to educate and\r\ntrain teachers in the art of teaching and governing in the public\r\nschools of the State.\r\n\r\nIdaho, although one of the youngest states in the Union, ranks high in\r\nher educational facilities, and the Normal Training Schools have been\r\nvery influential in bringing about these results.\r\n\r\nThe Lewiston State Normal is empowered to grant certificates to its\r\nstudents to teach in Idaho. These certificates are:\r\n\r\nA. Elementary Certificates, good for one year.\r\n\r\nB. Secondary Certificates, good for five years.\r\n\r\nC. Diplomas, good for life.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the Albion State Normal School has issued only three-year\r\ncertificates on graduation, and life diplomas only after twelve months'\r\nsuccessful teaching. On April 24, 1907, the Board of Trustees of the\r\nAlbion State Normal passed a resolution, providing that the regular\r\ncourse be lengthened to five years, and that life diplomas may be\r\ngranted to graduates who have taught successfully for five months.\r\n\r\nAcademy of Idaho.--The Academy of Idaho is located at Pocatello. The\r\npurpose of this school, as set forth in Section 980 of the School Laws\r\nof Idaho, is to teach those subjects usually taught in academic and\r\nbusiness courses and to give instructions pertaining to a good common\r\nschool education.\r\n\r\nEach department is well equipped with the latest devices for furthering\r\nthe work of the pupils. The students have free access to the large\r\nlibrary and reading room of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for admission to the Academy of Idaho are much the same\r\nas those of the normal schools; the applicant must show either by\r\ncertificate or examination that he is able to follow successfully the\r\ncourse which he elects. No tuition is charged residents of Idaho, and\r\npupils from other states are admitted to all the privileges of the\r\nAcademy by payment of a reasonable tuition.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Reform School--The Industrial Reform School was\r\nestablished in 1903 at St. Anthony, Fremont County. The purpose of this\r\nschool, as set forth in the act which created it, is \"for the care,\r\nprotection, training, and education of delinquent, dependent, and\r\nneglected children, and, [to] provide for the care, control, and\r\ndischarge of juvenile offenders.\" In addition to the income received\r\nfrom the 40,000 acres of land set aside for its maintenance, the\r\ninstitution is supported by regular appropriations by the State\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nA farm of two hundred acres, maintained in connection with the school,\r\nis equipped with necessary agricultural implements, vehicles, horses,\r\ncattle, hogs, poultry, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Industrial Training School is not a place of punishment, but a\r\nschool in which the physical, mental, and moral education of the child\r\nis systematically looked after. It is the plan to have the children\r\nleave the institution with a good common school education, with good\r\nhabits, and in fact with every requisite for good citizenship.\r\n\r\nIdaho Insane Asylum.--The Idaho Insane Asylum is located at the\r\ncity of Blackfoot on a tract of land comprising twenty-one hundred\r\nacres. A large part of this farm is under cultivation and forms an\r\nimportant source of supplies for the institution. In connection with the\r\nfarm is maintained a large dairy herd, horses, sheep, hogs, and poultry.\r\nA well-kept garden of thirty acres furnishes all the vegetables needed\r\nby the inmates and employees of the institution. Most of the work done\r\nin connection with the farm, garden, dairy, etc., is done by the\r\ninmates. The climate, the water supply, and the general surroundings are\r\nespecially healthful, as is shown by the medical superintendent, who\r\nsays, in his report of 1906: \"There is not a single case of that bane of\r\nasylum existence--tuberculosis--among them. This is undoubtedly due to\r\nthe climatic conditions here rather than anything else.\"\r\n\r\nA branch asylum was located at Orifino in 1905.\r\n\r\nIdaho State Penitentiary.--The Idaho State Penitentiary is located\r\nat Boise and is the only penal institution in the State. There are\r\ntwenty-five buildings in all that are used by and belong to the\r\ninstitution, nearly all of which have been erected since Idaho became a\r\nstate. These buildings are located on a tract of five hundred and twenty\r\nacres of land just east of the city. About eighty acres of land under\r\ncultivation are under the management of the institution and all the\r\nlabor is done by the convicts. The penitentiary maintains a most\r\nexcellent library which is free to all the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners are governed largely on the theory that \"Nothing so begets\r\nvice as idleness.\" During the last few years the convict labor has been\r\nengaged on the farm, in quarrying rock for the buildings of the\r\ninstitution, in erecting a new cell house and a woman's ward, and in\r\ndigging and walling up a large well which has given an abundant supply\r\nof pure water. Thus the institution is put as far as possible on a\r\nself-sustaining basis.\r\n\r\nSoldiers' Home.--The Soldiers' Home was established by the State\r\nLegislature in 1893 and located on a tract of forty acres of land about\r\nthree miles west of Boise in Ada County. The purpose of the institution,\r\nas suggested by its name, is to provide a comfortable home for the\r\nhonorably discharged soldiers, sailors, and marines who served in the\r\nMexican, the Civil, or the Spanish-American wars; or for any member of\r\nthe State National Guard disabled while on duty.\r\n\r\nThe home here provided for the old veterans is surrounded by all\r\nconveniences necessary to make their declining years pleasant and\r\ncomfortable. The rooms are heated by steam and lighted with electricity,\r\nand they have a bountiful supply of wholesome food. A hospital is\r\nmaintained in connection with the institution, and the inmates have the\r\nconstant care of a skilled physician if necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is the aim of the institution to be as nearly self-supporting as\r\npossible; regular appropriations for its maintenance are received from\r\nthe State and National Governments in about equal proportions.",
