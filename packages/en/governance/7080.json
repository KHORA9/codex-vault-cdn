THOROLD ROGERS\r\n\r\nIN TWO VOLUMES\r\n\r\nVOL. I.\r\n\r\n'BE JUST AND FEAR NOT'\r\n\r\nSECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe speeches which have been selected for publication in these volumes\r\npossess a value, as examples of the art of public speaking, which no\r\nperson will be likely to underrate. Those who may differ from Mr.\r\nBright's theory of the public good will have no difficulty in\r\nacknowledging the clearness of his diction, the skill with which he\r\narranges his arguments, the vigour of his style, the persuasiveness of\r\nhis reasoning, and above all, the perfect candour and sincerity with\r\nwhich he expresses his political convictions.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the course of events in this country will lead\r\nthose, who may desire to possess influence in the conduct of public\r\naffairs, to study the art of public speaking. If so, nothing which can\r\nbe found in English literature will aid the aspirant after this great\r\nfaculty more than the careful and reiterated perusal of the speeches\r\ncontained in these volumes. Tried indeed by the effect produced upon any\r\naudience by their easy flow and perfect clearness, or analysed by any of\r\nthose systems of criticism which under the name of 'rhetoric' have been\r\nsaved to us from the learning of the ancient world, these speeches would\r\nbe admitted to satisfy either process.\r\n\r\nThis is not the occasion on which to point out the causes which confer\r\nso great an artistic value on these compositions; which give them now,\r\nand will give them hereafter, so high a place in English literature. At\r\nthe present time nearly a hundred millions of the earth's inhabitants\r\nspeak the English tongue. A century hence, and it will probably be the\r\nspeech of nearly half the inhabitants of the globe. I think that no\r\nmaster of that language will occupy a loftier position than Mr. Bright;\r\nthat no speaker will teach with greater exactness the noblest and rarest\r\nof the social arts, the art of clear and persuasive exposition. But\r\nbefore this art can be attained (so said the greatest critic that the\r\nworld has known), it is necessary that the speaker should secure the\r\nsympathies of his audience, should convince them of his statesmanship,\r\nshould show that he is free from any taint of self-interest or\r\ndissimulation. These conditions of public trust still form, as\r\nheretofore, in every country of free thought and free speech, the\r\nfoundation of a good reputation and of personal influence. It is with\r\nthe fact that such are the characteristics of my friend's eloquence,\r\nthat I have been strongly impressed in collecting and editing the\r\nmaterials of these volumes.\r\n\r\nSince the days of those men of renown who lived through the first half\r\nof the seventeenth century, when the liveliest religious feeling was\r\njoined to the loftiest patriotism, and men laboured for their conscience\r\nand their country, England has witnessed no political career like that\r\nof Cobden and Bright. Cobden's death was a great loss to his country,\r\nfor it occurred at a time when England could ill spare a conscientious\r\nstatesman. Nations, however, cannot be saved by the virtues, nor need\r\nthey be lost by the vices, of their public men. But Cobden's death was\r\nan irreparable loss to his friends--most of all to the friend who had\r\nbeen, in an incessant struggle for public duty and truth, of one heart\r\nand of one purpose with him.\r\n\r\nThose who have been familiar with Cobden's mind know how wide was his\r\nknowledge, how true was his judgment of political events. The vast\r\nmajority of those who followed his public career had but a scanty\r\nacquaintance with the resources of his sagacity and foresight. He spoke\r\nto the people on a few subjects only. The wisdom of Free Trade; the\r\nnecessity of Parliamentary Reform; the dangerous tendency of those laws\r\nwhich favour the accumulation of land in few hands; the urgent need for\r\na system of national education; the mischief of the mere military\r\nspirit; the prudence of uniting communities by the multiplication of\r\ninternational interests; the abandonment of the policy of diplomatic and\r\nmilitary intermeddling; the advocacy, in short, of the common good in\r\nplace of a spurious patriotism, of selfish, local, or class aims, formed\r\nthe subject of Cobden's public utterances. But his intimate friends, and\r\nin particular his regular correspondents, were aware that his political\r\ncriticism was as general as it was accurate. The loss then of his wise\r\nand lucid counsel was the greatest to the survivor of a personal and a\r\npolitical friendship which was continued uninterruptedly through so long\r\nand so active a career.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of Mr. Bright's public life, the shortsighted\r\nselfishness of a landlords' parliament was afflicting the United Kingdom\r\nwith a continuous dearth. Labour was starved, and capital was made\r\nunproductive by the Corn-laws. The country was tied to a system by which\r\nGreat Britain and her Colonies deliberately chose the dearest market for\r\ntheir purchases. In the same spirit, the price of freights was wilfully\r\nheightened by the Navigation-laws. Important branches of home industry\r\nwere crippled by prying, vexatious, and wasteful excises. And this\r\nsystem was conceived to be the highest wisdom; or at any rate, to be so\r\ninvincible a necessity that it could not be avoided or altered without\r\ndanger. The country, if it were to make its way, could make it only\r\nbecause other nations were servile imitators of our commercial policy,\r\nand, in the vain hope of retaliation, were hindering their own progress.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of Great Britain was suspicious and irritating, for\r\nit was secret, busy, and meddling, insolent to the weak, conciliatory,\r\neven truckling, to the strong. The very name of diplomacy is and has\r\nbeen odious to English Liberals, for by means of it a reactionary\r\nGovernment could check domestic reforms, and hinder the community of\r\nnations indefinitely. The policy of the Foreign Office was constantly\r\ndirected towards embittering, if not embroiling, the relations between\r\nthis and other countries. It is difficult to account for these\r\nintrigues, except on the ground that successive Governments were anxious\r\nto maintain political and social anomalies at home, while they were\r\naffecting to support 'the balance of power' abroad. The abandonment of\r\nintervention in foreign politics was the beginning of agitation for\r\ndomestic reforms.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no part of the public administration was worse than that of\r\nIndia. The great Company had lost its monopoly of trade in the Eastern\r\nseas, but retained its administrative powers over the subject races and\r\ndependent princes of India. Its system of finance was wasteful and\r\noppressive. Its policy was that of aggression and annexation. In\r\npractice, the Government was irresponsible. Nobody listened to Indian\r\naffairs in Parliament, except on rare occasions, or for party purposes.\r\nThe Governor-General did as he pleased. The President of the Board of\r\nControl did as he pleased. If the reader wishes to see how the former\r\nacted, Mr. Cobden's pamphlet, 'How Wars are got up in India' will\r\nenlighten him. If it be necessary to inquire what the policy of the\r\nlatter might be, the disastrous and disgraceful Affghan War is an\r\nillustration. Never perhaps was a war commenced more recklessly. It is\r\ncertain that when loss and dishonour fell on the English arms, the\r\nstatesmen who recommended and insisted on the war tried to screen\r\nthemselves from just blame by the basest arts.\r\n\r\nThe internal resources of India were utterly neglected. The Company\r\ncollected part of its revenue from a land-tax, levied in the worst\r\nshape. In order to secure an income through a monopoly, it constrained\r\nthe cultivation of certain drugs for which there was a foreign demand;\r\nand neglected to encourage the cultivation of cotton, for which the home\r\ndemand was wellnigh boundless, and to which the Indian supply might be\r\nmade to correspond. The Company constructed neither road nor canal. It\r\ndid nothing towards maintaining the means of communication which even\r\nthe native governments had adopted. It suffered the ancient roads and\r\ntanks to fall into decay. It neglected to educate the native gentry,\r\nmuch more the people. In brief, the policy of the Company in dealing\r\nwith India was the policy of Old Spain with her Transatlantic\r\npossessions, only that it was more jealous and illiberal.\r\n\r\nAgainst these social and political evils, and many others which might be\r\nenumerated, a very small body of true and resolute statesmen arrayed\r\nthemselves. Among these statesmen the most eminent were the two chiefs\r\nof the Anti-Corn-law agitation. Never did men lead a hope which seemed\r\nmore forlorn. They had as opponents nearly the whole Upper House of\r\nParliament, a powerful and compact party in the Lower. The Established\r\nChurch was, of course, against them. The London newspapers, at that time\r\nalmost the only political power in the press, were against them. The\r\n'educated' classes were against them. Many of the working people were\r\nunfriendly to them, for the Chartists believed that the repeal of the\r\nCorn-laws would lower the price of labour. After a long struggle they\r\ngained the day; for an accident, the Irish famine, rendered a change in\r\nthe Corn-laws inevitable. But had it not been for the organization of\r\nthe League, the accident would have had no effect; for it is a rule in\r\nthe philosophy of politics that an accident is valuable only when the\r\nmachinery for making use of the accident is at hand. Calamities never\r\nteach wisdom to fools, they render it possible that the wise should\r\navail themselves of the emergency.\r\n\r\nA similar calamity, long foreseen by prudent men, caused the political\r\nextinction of the East India Company. The joint action of the Board of\r\nControl and the Directors led to the Indian mutiny. The suppression of\r\nthe Indian mutiny led to the suppression of the Leadenhall Street Divan.\r\nAnother calamity, also foreseen by statesmen, the outbreak of the\r\nAmerican Civil War, gave India commercial hope, and retrieved the\r\nfinances which the Company's rule had thrown into hopeless disorder.\r\n\r\nI have selected the speeches contained in these two volumes, with a view\r\nto supplying the public with the evidence on which Mr. Bright's friends\r\nassert his right to a place in the front rank of English statesmen. I\r\nsuppose that there is no better evidence of statesmanship than\r\nprescience; that no fuller confirmation of this evidence can be found\r\nthan in the popular acceptance of those principles which were once\r\nunpopular and discredited. A short time since, Lord Derby said that Mr.\r\nBright was the real leader of the Opposition. It is true that he has\r\ngiven great aid to that opposition which Lord Derby and his friends have\r\noften encountered, and by which, to their great discredit, but to their\r\ngreat advantage, they have been constantly defeated. If Lord Derby is in\r\nthe right, Mr. Bright is the leader of the People, while his Lordship\r\nrepresents a party which is reckless because it is desperate. The policy\r\nwhich Mr. Bright has advocated in these pages, and throughout a quarter\r\nof a century, a policy from which he has never swerved, has at last been\r\naccepted by the nation, despite the constant resistance of Lord Derby\r\nand his friends. It embodies the national will, because it has attacked,\r\nand in many cases vanquished, institutions and laws which have become\r\nunpopular, because they have been manifestly mischievous and\r\ndestructive. No one knows better how conservative and tolerant is public\r\nopinion in England towards traditional institutions, than Mr. Bright\r\ndoes; or how indifferent the nation is to attacks on an untenable\r\npractice and a bad law, until it awakens to the fact that the law or the\r\npractice is ruinous.\r\n\r\nMr. Bright's political opinions have not been adopted because they were\r\npopular. He was skilfully, and for a time successfully, maligned by Lord\r\nPalmerston, on account of his persevering resistance to the policy of\r\nthe Russian War. But it is probable that the views he entertained at\r\nthat time will find more enduring acceptance than those which Lord\r\nPalmerston and Lord Palmerston's colleagues promulgated, and that he has\r\ndone more to deface that Moloch, 'the balance of power,' than any other\r\nman living. Shortly after the beginning of the Planters' War, almost all\r\nthe upper, and many of the middle classes, sympathized with the Slave-\r\nowners' conspiracy. Everybody knows which side Mr. Bright took, and how\r\njudicious and far-sighted he was in taking it. But everybody should\r\nremember also how, when Mr. Bright pointed out the consequences likely\r\nto ensue from the cruise of the _Alabama_, he was insulted by Mr.\r\nLaird in the House of Commons; the Mr. Laird who launched the\r\n_Alabama_, who has been the means of creating bitter enmity between\r\nthe people of this country and of the United States, and has contrived\r\nto invest the unlawful speculation of a shipbuilder with the dignity of\r\nan international difficulty, to make it the material for an unsettled\r\ndiplomatic question.\r\n\r\nThere are many social and political reforms, destined, it may be hoped,\r\nto become matter of debate and action in a Reformed Parliament, towards\r\nthe accomplishment of which Mr. Bright has powerfully contributed. There\r\nis that without which Reform is a fraud, the redistribution of seats;\r\nthat without which it is a sham, the ballot; that without which it is\r\npossibly a danger, a system of national education, which should be, if\r\nnot compulsory, so cogently expedient that it cannot be rejected. There\r\nis the great question of the distribution of land, its occupancy, and\r\nits relief from that pestilent system of game preserving which robs the\r\nfarmer of his profit and the people of their home supplies. There is the\r\npacification of Ireland. The only consolation which can be gathered from\r\nthe condition of that unhappy country is, that reforms, which are highly\r\nexpedient in Great Britain, are vital in Ireland, and that they\r\ntherefore become familiar to the public mind. There is the development\r\nof international amity and good-will, first between ourselves and the\r\npeople of our own race, next between all nations. There is the\r\nrecognition of public duty to inferior or subject races, a duty which\r\nwas grievously transgressed before and after the Indian mutiny, and has\r\nbeen still more atrociously outraged in the Jamaica massacre. Upon these\r\nand similar matters, no man who wishes to deserve the reputation of a\r\njust and wise statesman,--in other words, to fulfil the highest and\r\ngreatest functions which man can render to man,--can find a worthier\r\nstudy than the public career of an Englishman whose guiding principle\r\nthroughout his whole life has been his favourite motto, 'Be just and\r\nfear not.'\r\n\r\nI have divided the speeches contained in these volumes into groups. The\r\nmaterials for selection are so abundant, that I have been constrained to\r\nomit many a speech which is worthy of careful perusal. I have naturally\r\ngiven prominence to those subjects with which Mr. Bright has been\r\nespecially identified, as, for example, India, America, Ireland, and\r\nParliamentary Reform. But nearly every topic of great public interest on\r\nwhich Mr. Bright has spoken is represented in these volumes.\r\n\r\nA statement of the views entertained by an eminent politician, who\r\nwields a vast influence in the country, is always valuable. It is more\r\nvaluable when the utterances are profound, consistent, candid. It is\r\nmost valuable at a crisis when the people of these islands are invited\r\nto take part in a contest where the broad principles of truth, honour,\r\nand justice are arrayed on one side, and their victory is threatened by\r\nthose false cries, those reckless calumnies, those impudent evasions\r\nwhich form the party weapons of desperate and unscrupulous men.\r\n\r\nAll the speeches in these volumes have been revised by Mr. Bright. The\r\nEditor is responsible for their selection, for this Preface, and for the\r\nIndex at the close of the second volume.\r\n\r\nJAMES E.

The particulars of the Bill were as\r\nfollows: The Government proposed that for the future the relations\r\nbetween the Directors and the Board of Control should be unchanged, but\r\nthat the constitution of the former should be altered and its patronage\r\ncurtailed. It reduced the number of the Members of the Court from\r\ntwenty-four to eighteen, of whom twelve were to be elected as before,\r\nand six nominated by the Crown from Indian servants who had been ten\r\nyears in the service of the Crown or the Company. One-third of this\r\nnumber was to go out every second year, but to be re-eligible.\r\nNominations by favour were to be abolished. The governorship of Bengal\r\nwas to be separated from the office of Governor-General. The legislative\r\ncouncil was to be improved and enlarged, the number to be twelve. The\r\nBill passed the House of Lords on June 13.]\r\n\r\nI feel a considerable disadvantage in rising to address the House after\r\nhaving listened for upwards of five hours to the speech of the right\r\nhon. Gentleman. But the question is one, as the right hon. Gentleman has\r\nsaid, of first-rate importance; and as I happen from a variety of\r\ncircumstances to have paid some attention to it, and to have formed some\r\nstrong opinions in regard to it, I am unwilling even that the Bill\r\nshould be brought in, or that this opportunity should pass, without\r\nsaying something, which will be partly in reply to the speech of the\r\nright hon. Gentleman, and partly by way of comment on the plan which he\r\nhas submitted to the House. There is, as it appears to me, great\r\ninconsistency between the speech of the right hon. Gentleman, and that\r\nwhich he proposes should be done; because, really, if we take his speech\r\nas a true and faithful statement of the condition of India, and of the\r\npast proceedings of the Government in that country, our conviction must\r\nbe that the right hon. Gentleman will be greatly to be blamed in making\r\nany alteration in that Government. At the same time, if it be not a\r\nfaithful portraiture of the Government, and of its transactions in\r\nIndia, then what the right hon. Gentleman proposes to do in regard to\r\nthe home administration of that country is altogether insufficient for\r\nthe occasion. I cannot on the present occasion go into many of the\r\ndetails on which the right hon. Gentleman has touched; but the\r\nobservations which I have to make will refer to matters of government,\r\nand those will be confined chiefly to the organisation of the home\r\nadministration. I am not much surprised that the Government should have\r\ntaken what I will call a very unsatisfactory course with regard to the\r\nmeasure they have propounded, because they evidently did not seem\r\nexactly to know what they ought to do from the very first moment that\r\nthis question was brought before them. I do not allude to the whole of\r\nthe Treasury bench, but I refer particularly to the noble Lord (Lord J.\r\nRussell), because he was at the head of the Government when this\r\nquestion was first brought before them. Lord Broughton, then Sir John\r\nHobhouse, was at that time the President of the Board of Control, and he\r\nwas not in favour of a Committee to inquire into the past government and\r\npresent condition of India. Shortly afterwards, however, it was\r\nconsidered by the noble Lord (Lord J. Russell) that it would be\r\ndesirable to have such a Committee appointed. A Committee was appointed,\r\nand it sat.\r\n\r\nBut at the commencement of the present Session the noble Lord intimated\r\nvery distinctly, in answer to a question which I put to him, and which\r\nseemed to make the noble Lord unnecessarily angry, that it was the\r\nintention of the Government to legislate, and in such a way as to leave\r\nthe Indian Government almost entirely the same as it had hitherto been.\r\n['No, no!'] Well, I thought that the noble Lord said so, and in\r\ncorroboration of that I may mention that the noble Lord quoted--and I\r\nbelieve that it was the noble Lord's only authority--the opinion of the\r\nright hon. Gentleman the Member for Stamford (Mr. Herries), who\r\nconsidered that no material change was required in the constitution of\r\nthe home Indian Government. Well, when the noble Lord made that\r\nannouncement, considerable dissatisfaction was manifested on both sides\r\nof the House, some hon. Members speaking in favour of a delay of one,\r\ntwo, or three years, or declaring themselves strongly against the\r\npresent constitution of the Indian Government. However, from that time\r\nto this, various rumours were afloat, and everybody was confident one\r\nweek that there would be no legislation, or only a postponement; in\r\nanother week it was thought that there was to be a very sweeping measure\r\n(which last report, I must say, I never believed); and the week after\r\nthat people were again led to the conclusion that there would be a\r\nmeasure introduced such as the one this night submitted to the House.\r\nAgain, it was understood so lately as last Saturday that there would be\r\nno legislation on the subject, excepting a mere temporary measure for a\r\npostponement. I confess that I was myself taken in by that announcement.\r\nOn Monday the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Danby Seymour) gave notice of a\r\nquestion on the same subject, and he was requested not to ask it till\r\nTuesday. On Tuesday there was a Cabinet Council, and whether there was a\r\nchange of opinion then I know not, but I presume that there was. The\r\nopinion that was confidently expressed on Saturday gave way to a new\r\nopinion, and the noble Lord announced that legislation would be\r\nproceeded with immediately. All this indicates that there was a good\r\ndeal of vacillation on the part of the Government. At last, however, has\r\ncome the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board\r\nof Control. There were some good things in it, no doubt. I do not\r\nsuppose that any man could stand up, and go on speaking for five hours,\r\nwithout saying something that was useful. But as to the main question on\r\nwhich this matter rests, I do not believe that the plan which the\r\nGovernment proposes to substitute will be one particle better than that\r\nwhich exists at the present moment.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of patronage, I admit, so far as that goes,\r\nthat the plan proposed by the right hon. Gentleman will be an\r\nimprovement on the present system. But I do not understand that the\r\nparticular arrangement of the covenanted service is to be broken up at\r\nall. That is a very important matter, because, although he might throw\r\nopen the nominations to the Indian service to the free competition of\r\nall persons in this country, yet if, when these persons get out to\r\nIndia, they are to become a covenanted service, as that service now is\r\nconstituted, and are to go on from beginning to end in a system of\r\npromotion by seniority--and they are to be under pretty much the same\r\narrangement as at present--a great deal of the evil now existing will\r\nremain; and the continuance of such a body as that will form a great bar\r\nto what I am very anxious to see, namely, a very much wider employment\r\nof the most intelligent and able men amongst the native population.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman has, in fact, made a long speech wholly in\r\ndefence of the Indian Government; and I cannot avoid making some remarks\r\nupon what he has stated because I wholly dissent from a large portion of\r\nthe observations which he has made. But the right hon. Gentleman, above\r\nall things, dreads that this matter should be delayed. Now I will just\r\ntouch upon that point. The right hon. Gentleman has said that he has not\r\nmet any one who does not consider it highly desirable that the House\r\nshould legislate upon the subject of the Government of India this year;\r\nand that it will be a great evil if such legislation is postponed. In\r\nsupport of this view he produces a private letter from Lord Dalhousie\r\nupon the subject. Now I do not consider such evidence as by any means\r\nconclusive, because the House knows that Lord Dalhousie has been\r\nconnected with the system that now exists. That noble Earl is also\r\nsurrounded by persons who are themselves interested in maintaining the\r\npresent system. From his elevated position also in India--I do not mean\r\nhis location at Simlah--but from his being by his station removed from\r\nthe mass of the European population, and still more removed from the\r\nnative population, I do not think it at all likely that Lord Dalhousie\r\nwill be able to form a sounder opinion upon this question than persons\r\nwho have never been in India. In my opinion, no evil can possibly arise\r\nfrom creating in the minds of the population of India a feeling that the\r\nquestion of Indian Government is considered by the House of Commons to\r\nbe a grave and solemn question; and I solemnly believe that if the\r\ndecision on the question be delayed for two years, so as to enable\r\nParliament to make due inquiries as to the means of establishing a\r\nbetter form of government in India, it will create in the minds of all\r\nthe intelligent natives of India a feeling of confidence and hope, and\r\nthat whatever may be done by them in the way of agitation will be rather\r\nfor the purpose of offering information in the most friendly and\r\ngenerous spirit, than of creating opposition to any Government\r\nlegislation. However, the question of delay is one which the House in\r\nall probability will be called upon to decide on another occasion.\r\n\r\nBut passing from that subject, I now come to the principle upon which\r\nthe right hon. Gentleman founded his Motion. The speech of I he right\r\nhon. Gentleman was throughout that of an advocate of the Indian\r\nGovernment, as at present constituted; and, if Mr. Melville had said\r\neverything that could possibly be dragged into the case, he could not\r\nhave made it more clearly appear than the right hon. Gentleman has done\r\nthat the Government of India has been uniformly worthy of the confidence\r\nof the country. My view of this matter, after a good deal of\r\nobservation, is, that the Indian Government, composed of two branches,\r\nwhich the right hon. Gentleman does not propose to amalgamate into one,\r\nis a Government of secrecy and irresponsibility to a degree that should\r\nnot be tolerated in a country like this, where we have a constitutional\r\nand Parliamentary Government, I have not the least idea in any\r\nobservations which I may make either in this House or elsewhere of\r\nbringing a charge against the East India Company--that is to say,\r\nagainst any individual member of the Board of Directors, as if they were\r\nanxious to misgovern India. I never had any such suspicion. I believe\r\nthat the twenty-four gentlemen who constitute the Board of Directors\r\nwould act just about as well as any other twenty-four persons elected by\r\nthe same process, acting under the same influences, and surrounded by\r\nthe same difficulties--having to act with another and independent body--\r\nthe Board of Control. Neither am I hostile to the Board of Control,\r\nbecause I think that the duty imposed upon it is greater than any such\r\nbody can properly perform. The right hon. Gentleman, the enormous\r\nlabours of whose office could not be accomplished by any one man, coming\r\ninto office in December, and having to propose a new Government for\r\nIndia in the month of May or June, must have found it extremely\r\ndifficult to make himself master of the question. But beyond this the\r\nHouse should bear in mind, that during the last thirty years there has\r\nbeen a new President of the Board of Control every two years. Nay, in\r\nthe course of last year there were no less than three Presidents of the\r\nBoard of Control. Thus that Board seems framed in such a manner as to\r\nmake it altogether impossible that any one man should be able to conduct\r\nit in the way which it ought to be conducted. Beyond this, the President\r\nof that Board has to act in conjunction with the Court of Directors.\r\nWithout saying anything which would impute blame to any party, it must\r\nbe obvious that two such bodies combined can never carry on the\r\ngovernment of India wisely, and in accordance with those principles\r\nwhich have been found necessary in the government of this country. The\r\nright hon. Gentleman has been obliged to admit that the theory of the\r\nold Government of India was one which could not be defended, and that\r\neverybody considers it ridiculous and childish. I am not at all certain\r\nthat the one that is going to be established is in any degree better. It\r\nwas in 1784 that this form of government was established, amid the fight\r\nof factions. In 1813 it was continued for twenty-years longer, during a\r\ntime when the country was involved in desperate hostilities with France.\r\nIn 1833 another Bill, continuing that form of government, passed through\r\nParliament immediately after the hurricane which carried the Reform\r\nBill. All these circumstances rendered it difficult for the Government,\r\nhowever honestly disposed, to pass the best measure for the government\r\nof India. But all the difficulties which then existed appear to me\r\nwholly to have vanished. Never has any question come before Parliament\r\nmore entirely free from a complication of that nature, or one which the\r\nHouse has the opportunity of more quietly and calmly considering, than\r\nthe question now before them.\r\n\r\nI should have been pleased if the right hon. Gentleman had given the\r\nHouse the testimony of some two or three persons on his own side of the\r\nquestion. But, as he has not done so, I will trouble the House by\r\nreferring to some authorities in support of my own views. I will first\r\nrefer to the work of Mr. Campbell, which has already been quoted by the\r\nright hon. Gentleman. It is a very interesting book, and gives a great\r\ndeal of information. That writer says--\r\n\r\n  'The division of authority between the Board of Control and the\r\n  Court of Directors, the large number of directors, and the\r\n  peculiar system by which measures are originated in the Court,\r\n  sent for approval to the Board, then back again to the Court, and\r\n  so on, render all deliverances very slow and difficult; and when\r\n  a measure is discussed in India, the announcement that it has\r\n  been referred to the Court of Directors is often regarded as an\r\n  indefinite postponement. In fact, it is evident that (able and\r\n  experienced as are many of the individual directors) twenty-four\r\n  directors in one place, and a Board of Control in another, are\r\n  not likely very speedily to unite in one opinion upon any\r\n  doubtful point.'\r\n\r\nThat, I think, is likely to be the opinion of any man on the Government\r\nof India. There is another authority to which I will refer, Mr. Kaye,\r\nwho has also written a very good book. It was actually distributed by\r\nthe Court of Directors; I have therefore a right to consider it a fair\r\nrepresentation of their views of what was done, especially as the\r\nChairman of the Court has given me a copy of the book. Mr. Kaye, in\r\nreferring to the double Government which existed in Bengal in 1772,\r\nmakes use of these expressions. When I first read them, I thought they\r\nwere a quotation from my own speeches:--\r\n\r\n  'But enlightened as were the instructions thus issued to the\r\n  supervisors, the supervision was wholly inadequate to the\r\n  requirements of the case. The double Government, as I have shown,\r\n  did not work well. It was altogether a sham and an imposture. It\r\n  was soon to be demolished at a blow.... The double Government\r\n  had, by this time, fulfilled its mission. It had introduced an\r\n  incredible amount of disorder and corruption into the State, and\r\n  of poverty and wretchedness among the people; it had embarrassed\r\n  our finances, and soiled our character, and was now to be openly\r\n  recognised as a failure.'\r\n\r\nThis is only as to Bengal. The following are the words he uses in\r\nrespect to the double Government at home:--\r\n\r\n  'In respect of all transactions with foreign Powers--all matters\r\n  bearing upon questions of peace and war--the President of the\r\n  Board of Control has authority to originate such measures as he\r\n  and his colleagues in the Ministry may consider expedient. In\r\n  such cases he acts presumedly in concert with the Secret\r\n  Committee of the Court of Directors--a body composed of the\r\n  chairman, deputy-chairman, and senior member of the Court. The\r\n  Secret Committee sign the despatches which emanate from the\r\n  Board, but they have no power to withhold or to alter them. They\r\n  have not even the power to record their dissent. In fact, the\r\n  functions of the Committee are only those which, to use the words\r\n  of a distinguished member of the Court (the late Mr. Tucker), who\r\n  deplored the mystery and the mockery of a system which obscures\r\n  responsibility and deludes public opinion, could as well be\r\n  performed \"by a secretary and a seal.\"'\r\n\r\nFurther on he says--\r\n\r\n  'In judging of responsibility, we should remember that the whole\r\n  foreign policy of the East India Company is regulated by the\r\n  Board of Control; that in the solution of the most vital\r\n  questions--questions of peace and war--affecting the finances of\r\n  the country, and, therefore, the means of internal improvement,\r\n  the Court of Directors have no more power than the mayor and\r\n  aldermen of any corporate town. India depends less on the will of\r\n  the twenty-four than on one man's caprice--here to-day and gone\r\n  to-morrow--knocked over by a gust of Parliamentary uncertainty--\r\n  the mistaken tactics of a leader, or negligence of a whipper-in.\r\n  The past history of India is a history of revenue wasted and\r\n  domestic improvement obstructed by war.'\r\n\r\nThis is very much what I complain of. I admit the right of the East\r\nIndia Company to complain of many things done by the Board of Control;\r\nand I am of opinion, that if the House left the two bodies to combat one\r\nanother, they would at last come to an accurate perception of what they\r\nboth are. The East India Company accused the Board of Control of making\r\nwars and squandering the revenue which the Company collected. But Mr.\r\nKaye said that Mr. Tucker deplored the mystery and the mockery of a\r\nsystem which obscured responsibility and deluded public opinion. It is\r\nbecause of this concealment, of this delusion practised upon public\r\nopinion, of this evasion of public responsibility and Parliamentary\r\ncontrol, that you have a state of things in India which the hon. Member\r\nfor Guildford (Mr. Mangles) has described, when he says that the Company\r\nmanages the revenues, collects the taxes, and gets from\r\n20,000,000_l_. to 30,000,000_l_. a-year, and nobody knows how\r\nmuch more. But, whatever it is, such is the system of foreign policy\r\npursued by the Board of Control--that is to say, by the gentlemen who\r\ndrop down there for six or eight or twelve months, never beyond two\r\nyears--that, whatever revenues are collected, they are squandered on\r\nunnecessary and ruinous wars, till the country is brought to a state of\r\nembarrassment and threatened bankruptcy. That is the real point which\r\nthe House will have to consider.\r\n\r\nWith regard to some of the details of the Government plan, we should no\r\ndoubt all agree: but this question of divided responsibility, of\r\nconcealed responsibility, and of no responsibility whatever, that is the\r\nreal pith of the matter. The House should take care not to be diverted\r\nfrom that question. [Mr. Mangles: 'Produce your own plan.'] An hon.\r\nGentleman has asked me to produce my plan. I will not comply with that\r\nrequest, but will follow the example of a right hon. Gentleman, a great\r\nauthority in this House, who once said, when similarly challenged, that\r\nhe should produce his plan when he was called in. I believe that the\r\nplan before the House to-night was concocted by the Board of Control and\r\nthe hon. Member for Guildford and his Colleagues I shall, therefore,\r\nconfine myself at present to the discussion of that plan. Some persons\r\nare disposed very much (at least I am afraid so) to undervalue the\r\nparticular point which I am endeavouring to bring before the House; and\r\nthey seem to fancy that it does not much matter what shall be the form\r\nof government in India, since the population of that country will always\r\nbe in a condition of great impoverishment and much suffering; and that\r\nwhatever is done must be done there, and that after all--after having\r\nconquered 100,000,000 of people--it is not in our power to interfere for\r\nthe improvement of their condition. Mr. Kaye, in his book, commences the\r\nfirst chapters with a very depreciating account of the character of the\r\nMogul Princes, with a view to show that the condition of the people of\r\nIndia was at least as unfavourable under them as under British rule. I\r\nwill cite one or two cases from witnesses for whose testimony the right\r\nhon. Gentleman (Sir C. Wood) must have respect. Mr. Marshman is a\r\ngentleman who is well known as possessing a considerable amount of\r\ninformation on Indian affairs, and has, I presume, come over on purpose\r\nto give his evidence on the subject. He was editor of a newspaper which\r\nwas generally considered throughout India to be the organ of the\r\nGovernment; in that newspaper, the _Friend of India_, bearing the\r\ndate 1st April, 1852, the following statement appears:--\r\n\r\n  'No one has ever attempted to contradict the fact that the\r\n  condition of the Bengal peasantry is almost as wretched and\r\n  degraded as it is possible to conceive--living in the most\r\n  miserable hovels, scarcely fit for a dog-kennel, covered with\r\n  tattered rags, and unable, in too many instances, to procure more\r\n  than a single meal a-day for himself and family. The Bengal ryot\r\n  knows nothing of the most ordinary comforts of life. We speak\r\n  without exaggeration when we affirm, that if the real condition\r\n  of those who raise the harvest, which yields between\r\n  3,000,000_l_. and 4,000,000_l_. a-year, was fully\r\n  known, it would make the ears of one who heard thereof tingle.'\r\n\r\nIt has been said that in the Bengal Presidency the natives are in a\r\nbetter condition than in the other Presidencies; and I recollect that\r\nwhen I served on the Cotton Committee the evidence taken before it being\r\nconfined to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies, it was then said that if\r\nevidence had been taken about the Bengal Presidency it would have\r\nappeared that the condition of the natives was better. But I believe\r\nthat it is very much the same in all the Presidencies. I must say that\r\nit is my belief that if a country be found possessing a most fertile\r\nsoil, and capable of bearing every variety of production, and that,\r\nnotwithstanding, the people are in a state of extreme destitution and\r\nsuffering, the chances are that there is some fundamental error in the\r\ngovernment of that country. The people of India have been subjected by\r\nus, and how to govern them in an efficient and beneficial manner is one\r\nof the most important points for the consideration of the House. From\r\nthe Report of the Indian Cotton Committee it appears that nearly every\r\nwitness--and the witnesses were nearly all servants of the Company--gave\r\nevidence as to the state of destitution in which the cultivators of the\r\nsoil lived. They were in such an abject condition that they were obliged\r\nto give 40 or 50 per cent, to borrow money to enable them to put seed\r\ninto the ground. I can, if it were necessary, bring any amount of\r\nevidence to prove the miserable condition of the cultivators, and that\r\nin many places they have been compelled to part with their personal\r\nornaments. Gentlemen who have written upon their condition have drawn a\r\nfrightful picture, and have represented the persons employed to collect\r\nthe revenue as coming upon the unhappy cultivators like locusts, and\r\ndevouring everything. With regard to the consumption of salt, looking at\r\nthe _Friend of India_, of April 14, 1853, it appears that it is on\r\nthe decline. In the year 1849-50, the consumption was 205,517 tons; in\r\n1850-51, 186,410 tons; and in 1851-2, 146,069 tons. Thus, in the short\r\nperiod of three years, there has been a decrease in the consumption\r\namounting to 59,448 tons, which will involve a loss to the revenue of\r\n416,136_l_. [Footnote: The _Friend of India_ was incorrect in\r\nthis statement the real decline in the consumption of salt was about\r\n12,000 tons.] Salt is one of those articles that people in India will\r\nuse as much of as they can afford, and the diminution in the consumption\r\nappears to me to be a decided proof of the declining condition of the\r\npopulation, and that must affect adversely the revenue of the Indian\r\nGovernment. Now there is another point to which the right hon. Gentleman\r\nhas slightly alluded; it is connected with the administration of\r\njustice, and I will read from the _Friend of India_ a case\r\nillustrative of the efficiency of the police. The statement is so\r\nextraordinary that it would be incredible but for the circumstance of\r\nits having appeared in such a respectable journal:--\r\n\r\n  'The affair itself is sufficiently uninteresting. A native\r\n  Zemindar had, or fancied he had, some paper rights over\r\n  certain lands occupied by a European planter, and, as a\r\n  necessary consequence, sent a body of armed retainers to\r\n  attack his factory. The European resisted in the same\r\n  fashion by calling out his retainers. There was a pitched\r\n  battle, and several persons were wounded, if not slain;\r\n  while the Darogah, the appointed guardian of the peace, sat\r\n  on the roof of a neighbouring hut and looked on with an\r\n  interest, the keenness of which was probably not diminished\r\n  by the fact of his own immunity from the pains and perils of\r\n  the conflict. There has been a judicial investigation, and\r\n  somebody will probably be punished, if not by actual\r\n  sentence, by the necessary disbursement of fees and\r\n  douceurs, but the evil will not be thereby suppressed or\r\n  even abated. The incident, trifling as it may appear--and\r\n  the fact that it is trifling is no slight evidence of a\r\n  disorganised state of society--is an epitome in small type\r\n  of our Bengal police history. On all sides, and in every\r\n  instance, we have the same picture--great offences, the\r\n  police indifferent or inefficient, judicial investigations\r\n  protracted till the sufferers regret that they did not\r\n  patiently endure the injury, and somebody punished, but no\r\n  visible abatement of the crime. The fact is, and it is\r\n  beginning at last to be acknowledged everywhere, except\r\n  perhaps at home, that Bengal does not need so much a\r\n  \"reform\" or reorganisation of the police, as a police, a\r\n  body of some kind, specially organised for the preservation\r\n  of order. Why the change is so long postponed, no one, not\r\n  familiar with the _arcana_ of Leadenhall-street and\r\n  Cannon-row, can readily explain.'\r\n\r\nMr. Marshman uses the expression, 'the incident, trifling as it may\r\nappear;' but I will ask the House if they can conceive a state of\r\nsociety in a country under the Government of England where a scene of\r\nviolence such as has been described could be considered trifling?\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman has, while admitting that the want of roads in\r\nsome districts of India is a great evil, endeavoured to show that a\r\ngreat deal has been done to remedy the deficiency, and that on some\r\nroads the mails travel as fast as ten miles an hour. Now, I believe that\r\nif the speed were taken at five miles an hour, it would be nearer the\r\ntruth; and I will beg the House to excuse me if I read another extract\r\nfrom the _Friend of India_ of April 14, 1853:--\r\n\r\n  'The Grand Trunk, however, is the only road upon which a\r\n  good speed has been attained, remarks being attached to all\r\n  of the remainder strongly indicative of the want of improved\r\n  means of communication. From Shergotty to Gyah, and Gyah to\r\n  Patna, for instance, the pace is four miles and a half an\r\n  hour; but then \"the road is cutcha, and the slightest shower\r\n  of rain renders it puddly and impracticable for speedy\r\n  transit.\" From Patna to Benares the official account is the\r\n  same, but the rate increases at one stage to five miles and\r\n  a half. The southern roads are, however, in the worst\r\n  condition, the mails travelling to Jelazore at three miles\r\n  an hour, or less than a groom can walk; and even between\r\n  Calcutta and Baraset the rate rises to only four miles and a\r\n  half an hour, while everywhere we have such notices as \"road\r\n  intersected by numerous unbridged rivers and nullahs,\" \"road\r\n  has not been repaired for these many years,\" \"road not\r\n  repaired for years,\" the \"road in so bad a state, and so\r\n  much intersected by rivers and nullahs, that no great\r\n  improvement in the speed of the mails can be effected.\" And\r\n  yet the surplus Ferry Funds might, one would think, if\r\n  economically administered, be sufficient to pay at least for\r\n  the maintenance of the roads already in existence. New\r\n  roads, we fear, are hopeless until Parliament fixes a\r\n  _minimum_, which must be expended on them; and even\r\n  then it may be allowed to accumulate, as the Parliamentary\r\n  grant for education has done at Madras.'\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman has referred to the subject of irrigation; and\r\nI hold in my hand an extract from the Report of the Commission which\r\ninquired into the subject. The Report states that--\r\n\r\n  'The loss of revenue by the famine of 1832-33 is estimated at\r\n  least at 1,000,000_l_. sterling; the loss of property at a\r\n  far greater amount; of life, at 200,000 or 300,000; and of\r\n  cattle, at 200,000 at the lowest, in Guntore alone, besides the\r\n  ruin of 70,000 houses. The famine of the Northern Circars in\r\n  1833, and that of the north-western provinces of India at a later\r\n  period, prove with irresistible force that irrigation in this\r\n  country is properly a question, not of profit, but of existence.'\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman has also quoted from a Report by Colonel Cotton\r\non the subject of the embankment of the Kistna. Now, the embankment of\r\nthe Kistna has been recommended as far back as the year 1792, and from\r\nthat time has been repeatedly brought forward. The whole estimate for it\r\nis but 155,000_l_., and it was not until September, 1852, that the\r\npreliminary operations were commenced. I find this officer stating with\r\nrespect to the district of Rajamundry, that if a particular improvement\r\nthat had been recommended above twenty years ago had been carried out,\r\nit would have saved the lives of upwards of 100,000 persons who perished\r\nin the famine of 1837. I say that such facts as these are a\r\njustification of stronger language than any in which I have indulged in\r\nreference to the neglect of the Indian Government whether in this House\r\nor out of it. The right hon. gentleman candidly informs us that this\r\nvery embankment has been recently stopped by order of the Madras\r\nGovernment, because the money was wanted for other purposes--the Burmese\r\nwar, no doubt. In the year 1849 it was reported that Colonel Cotton\r\nwrote a despatch to the Madras Government, in which, after mentioning\r\nfacts connected with the famines, he insisted, in strong and indignant\r\nlanguage, that the improvements should go on. I believe that there was\r\nan allusion in the letter to the awkward look these things would have,\r\npending the discussions on the Government of India, and I understand\r\nthat it was agreed that the original letter, which countermanded the\r\nimprovements, should be withdrawn, and that then the remonstrance from\r\nColonel Cotton should also be withdrawn. A gentleman who has been in the\r\nCompany's service, and who has for some time been engaged in\r\nimprovements, chiefly in irrigation, writes in a private letter as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  'From my late investigations on this subject, I feel convinced\r\n  that the state of our communications is the most important\r\n  subject which calls for consideration. I reckon that India now\r\n  pays, for want of cheap transit, a sum equal to the whole of the\r\n  taxes; so that by reducing its cost to a tenth, which might\r\n  easily be done, we should as good as abolish all taxes. I trust\r\n  the Committees in England are going on well, in spite of the\r\n  unbecoming efforts which have been made to circumscribe and quash\r\n  their proceedings. Woe be to India, indeed, if this opportunity\r\n  is lost! Much will depend upon you--\r\n\r\n(the letter was not addressed to myself)--\r\n\r\n  and others now in England, who know India, and have a single eye\r\n  to its welfare. It behoves you to do your utmost to improve this\r\n  most critical time, and may God in his mercy overrule all the\r\n  efforts of man for its good! What abominations, villanies, and\r\n  idiotcies there still are in our system! Is there no hope, no\r\n  possibility, of infusing a little fresh blood from some purer\r\n  source into these bodies?\r\n\r\n(the ruling authorities).\r\n\r\n  It is quite clear that no radical improvement can take place till\r\n  some influences can be applied to stimulate our rulers to more\r\n  healthy, wholesome action; health can never be looked for in a\r\n  body constituted as the Court of Directors now is; nothing but\r\n  torpid disease can be expected as matters now stand.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the administration of justice, I shall not go at any\r\nlength into that subject, because I hope it will be taken up by some\r\nother Gentleman much more competent than myself, and I trust that a\r\nsufficient answer will be given to what has been stated by the right\r\nhon. Gentleman. However, as far as I am able to understand, there\r\nappears to be throughout the whole of India, on the part of the European\r\npopulation, an absolute terror of coming under the Company's Courts for\r\nany object whatever. Within the last fortnight I have had a conversation\r\nwith a gentleman who has seen a long period of service in India, and he\r\ndeclared it was hopeless to expect that Englishmen would ever invest\r\ntheir property in India under any circumstances which placed their\r\ninterests at the disposal of those courts of justice. That is one reason\r\nwhy there appears no increase in the number of Europeans or Englishmen\r\nwho settle in the interior of India for the purpose of investing their\r\ncapital there. The right hon. Gentleman endeavoured to make an excuse on\r\nthe ground that the Law Commission had done nothing. I was not in the\r\nHouse when the right hon. Member for Edinburgh (Mr. Macaulay) brought\r\nforward the Bill of 1833, but I understand it was stated that the Law\r\nCommission was to do wonders; yet now we have the evidence of the right\r\nhon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Control, that the Report of\r\nthe Law Commission has ever since been going backwards and forwards,\r\nlike an unsettled spirit, between this country and India. Mr. Cameron,\r\nin his evidence, said (I suppose it is slumbering somewhere on the\r\nshelves in the East India House) that the Court of Directors actually\r\nsneered at the propositions of their officers for enactments of any\r\nkind, and that it was evidently their object to gradually extinguish the\r\nCommission altogether. Yet the evidence of Mr. Cameron went to show the\r\nextraordinary complication and confusion of the law and law\r\nadministration over all the British dominions in India. The right hon.\r\nGentleman the President of the Board of Control also referred to the\r\nstatistics laid before the public; but I want to know why Colonel Sykes'\r\nstatistical tables are not before the House. They are at the India\r\nHouse; but a journey to Leadenhall-street seems to be as long as one to\r\nIndia, and one can as soon get a communication by the overland mail as\r\nany information from the India House. What did Colonel Sykes say, with\r\nrespect to a subject referred to by the right hon. Gentleman, who had\r\ngiven the House to suppose that a great deal had been done in respect to\r\nimprovements in India? Colonel Sykes stated that in fifteen years, from\r\n1838 to 1852, the average expenditure throughout the whole of India on\r\npublic works, including roads, bridges, tanks, and canals, was\r\n299,732_l_. The north-west appeared to be the pet district; and in\r\n1851 the total expenditure was 334,000_l_., of which the north-west\r\ndistrict had 240,000_l_. In 1852 the estimate was 693,000_l_.,\r\nof which the north-west district was to have 492,000_l_., leaving\r\nonly 94,000_l_. in 1851, and 201,000_l_. in 1852, for public\r\nworks of all kinds in the three Presidencies of Bengal, Madras, and\r\nBombay, with a population of 70,000,000 souls. The right hon. Gentleman\r\nthen referred to the exports from this country, and the increase of\r\ntrade with India; and a kindred subject to that was the mode in which\r\nEnglishmen settle in India. What I want to show is, that the reason why\r\nso little is done with India by Englishmen is, that there does not exist\r\nin that country the same security for their investments as in almost\r\nevery other country in the world. I recollect receiving from Mr. Mackay,\r\nwho was sent out by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, a letter\r\nexpressing his amazement on finding that in the interior of India an\r\nEnglishman was hardly known, unless he now and then made his appearance\r\nas a tax collector. The following Return shows in what small numbers\r\nEuropeans resort to India:--\r\n\r\n  'British-born subjects in India not in the service of the Queen\r\n  or the Company:--\r\n\r\n    Bengal             6,749\r\n    Madras             1,661\r\n    Bombay             1,596\r\n                      ------\r\n                      10,006\r\n\r\n  'In the interior of the country, engaged in agriculture or\r\n  manufactures--\r\n\r\n    Bengal               273\r\n    Madras                37\r\n    Bombay                 7\r\n                      ------\r\n                         317'\r\n\r\nI cannot believe, if the United States had been the possessors of India,\r\nbut that where there are tens of Europeans now in that country there\r\nwould have been, not hundreds, but thousands of the people of America.\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman spoke of the exports to India, and wanted to\r\nshow how large they were. Certainly they have increased very much,\r\nbecause they started from nothing at all. Before the opening of the\r\ntrade, the Court of Proprietors, by resolution, declared that it was\r\nquite a delusion to suppose it possible to increase the trade with\r\nIndia. In 1850 the total exports to India from Great Britain and Ireland\r\nwere 8,024,000_l_., of which cotton goods alone amounted to\r\n5,220,000_l_., leaving 2,804,000_l_. for the total exports\r\nfrom Great Britain and Ireland upon all other branches of industry other\r\nthan cotton. Now, let the House make a comparison with another country,\r\none with which a moderately fair comparison might be made. Brazil has a\r\npopulation of 7,500,000 souls, half of whom are reckoned to be slaves,\r\nyet the consumption of British goods is greater in Brazil, in proportion\r\nto the population, than in India--the former country, with a population\r\nof 7,500,000, taking British goods to the amount of 2,500,000_l_.\r\nIf India took but half the quantity of our exports that Brazil did in\r\nproportion to her population, she would take more than five times what\r\nshe now takes. Yet Brazil is a country upon which we have imposed the\r\npayment of exorbitant duties, which we have almost debarred from trading\r\nwith us by an absurd monopoly in sugar, while India is a country\r\nentirely under our own government, and which, we are told, is enjoying\r\nthe greatest possible blessings under the present administration,\r\ncompared with what it enjoyed under its former rulers. Our exports to\r\nIndia in 1814 were 826,000_l_.; in 1832 they were\r\n3,600,000_l_.; in 1843 they were 6,500,000_l_.; and in 1850\r\nthey were 8,000,000_l_. India consumes our exports at the rate of\r\n1_s_. 3 _d_. per head; whilst in South America, including the\r\nwhole of the slave population, the consumption per head is 8 _s_.\r\n8_d_. These are facts which the right hon. Baronet is bound to pay\r\nserious attention to. For myself, representing, as I do, one of our\r\ngreat seats of manufacturing industry, I feel myself doubly called upon\r\nto lose no opportunity of bringing such facts before the House,\r\nsatisfied as I am that there is no Member of this House so obtuse as not\r\nto comprehend how materially the great manufacturing interests of this\r\ncountry are concerned in the question--what shall be the future\r\nGovernment of India?\r\n\r\nAnother subject requiring close attention on the part of Parliament is\r\nthe employment of the natives of India in the service of the Government.\r\nThe right hon. Member for Edinburgh (Mr. Macaulay), in proposing the\r\nIndian Bill of 1833, had dwelt on one of its clauses, which provided\r\nthat neither colour, nor caste, nor religion, nor place of birth, should\r\nbe a bar to the employment of persons by the Government; whereas, as\r\nmatter of fact, from that time to this, no person in India has been so\r\nemployed, who might not have been equally employed before that clause\r\nwas enacted; and, from the statement of the right hon. Gentleman the\r\nPresident of the Board of Control, that it is proposed to keep up the\r\ncovenanted service system, it is clear that this most objectionable and\r\nmost offensive state of things is to continue. Mr. Cameron, a gentleman\r\nthoroughly versed in the subject, as fourth member of Council in India,\r\nPresident of the Indian Law Commission, and of the Council of Education\r\nfor Bengal--what does he say on this point? He says--\r\n\r\n  'The statute of 1833 made the natives of India eligible to all\r\n  offices under the Company. But during the twenty years that have\r\n  since elapsed, not one of the natives has been appointed to any\r\n  office except such as they were eligible to before the statute.\r\n  It is not, however, of this omission that I should feel justified\r\n  in complaining, if the Company had shown any disposition to make\r\n  the natives fit, by the highest European education, for admission\r\n  to their covenanted service. Their disposition, as far as it can\r\n  be devised, is of the opposite kind.\r\n\r\n  'When four students (added Mr. Cameron) were sent to London from\r\n  the Medical College of Calcutta, under the sanction of Lord\r\n  Hardinge, in Council, to complete their professional education,\r\n  the Court of Directors expressed their dissatisfaction; and when\r\n  a plan for establishing a University at Calcutta, which had been\r\n  prepared by the Council of Education, was recommended to their\r\n  adoption by Lord Hardinge, in Council, they answered that the\r\n  project was premature. As to the Law Commission, I am afraid that\r\n  the Court of Directors have been accustomed to think of it only\r\n  with the intention of procuring its abolition.'\r\n\r\nUnder the Act of 1833 the natives of India were declared to be eligible\r\nto any office under the Company. No native has, in the twenty years\r\nwhich have since elapsed, been appointed to any office in pursuance of\r\nthat clause which he might not have held before the Bill passed, or had\r\nit never passed at all. There might not, perhaps, have been so much\r\nreason to complain of this circumstance, had the Government of India\r\nmeanwhile shown a disposition to qualify the natives for the covenanted\r\nservice; but the fact is that the Government has, on the contrary,\r\nmanifested a disposition of a totally opposite character. The House must\r\nbe very cautious not to adopt the glossed and burnished statement of the\r\nright hon. Gentleman as exhibiting the real state of things in India;\r\nfor it is essential, in the highest degree, that in the present critical\r\njuncture of things the whole truth should be known. The right hon.\r\nBaronet, towards the close of his speech, has gone into the subject of\r\neducation, and not so much into that of ecclesiastical establishments in\r\nIndia, but somewhat into that of religion. Now, with reference to\r\neducation, so far as can be gathered from the Returns before the House--\r\nI have sought to obtain Returns of a more specific character, but to no\r\npurpose, having received the usual answer in these matters, that there\r\nwas no time for preparing them--but from the Returns we have before us I\r\nfind that while the Government has overthrown almost entirely that\r\nnative education which had subsisted throughout the country so\r\nuniversally that a schoolmaster was as regular a feature in every\r\nvillage as the 'potail' or head man, it has done next to nothing to\r\nsupply the deficiency which has been created, or to substitute a better\r\nsystem. Out of a population of 100,000,000 natives we instruct but\r\n25,000 children; out of a gross revenue of 29,000,000_l_. sterling,\r\nextracted from that population, we spend but 66,000_l_. in their\r\neducation. In India, let it be borne in mind, the people are not in the\r\nposition with regard to providing for their own education which the\r\npeople of this country enjoy, and the education which they have provided\r\nthemselves with, the Government has taken from them, supplying no\r\nadequate system in its place. The people of India are in a state of\r\npoverty, and of decay, unexampled in the annals of the country under\r\ntheir native rulers. From their poverty the Government wrings a gross\r\nrevenue of more than 29,000,000_l_. sterling, and out of that\r\n29,000,000_l_., return to them 66,000_l_. per annum for the\r\npurposes of education!\r\n\r\nWhat is our ecclesiastical establishment in India? Three bishops and a\r\nproportionate number of clergy, costing no less than 101,000_l_. a-\r\nyear for the sole use of between 50,000 and 60,000 Europeans, nearly\r\none-half of whom, moreover--taking the army--are Roman Catholics. I\r\nmight add, that in India, the Government showed the same discrimination\r\nof which the noble Member for the City of London (Lord J. Russell)\r\nseemed to approve so much the other night, for, although they give to\r\none Protestant bishop 4,000_l_. a-year, with 1,2OO_l_. a-year\r\nmore for expenses and a ship at his disposal, and to two other\r\nProtestant bishops between 2,000_l_. and 3,000_l_. a-year,\r\nthey give to the Roman Catholic bishop a paltry sum of about\r\n250_l_. a-year. The East India Company are not, perhaps, herein so\r\nmuch to blame, seeing that they do but follow the example of what is\r\ngoing on in this country.\r\n\r\nThere is another question--perhaps the most important of all--the\r\nquestion of Indian finance, which, somehow or other, the right hon.\r\nBaronet has got over in so very lame a manner, in so particularly\r\nconfused a style, that had I not known something of the matter\r\npreviously, I should have learnt very little from the right hon.\r\nBaronet's statement. A former Director of the East India Company has, on\r\nthis subject, issued a book--of course, in defence of the Company. Here\r\nare two or three facts extracted from this book:--From 1835 to 1851--\r\nsixteen years--the entire net taxation of India has produced\r\n340,756,000_l_.; the expenditure on the Government in the same\r\nperiod having been 341,676,000_l_.--an amount somewhat in excess of\r\nthe revenue. During these sixteen years there has been also expended on\r\npublic works of all kinds 5,000,000_l_., and there has been paid,\r\nin dividends, to the proprietors of East India stock,\r\n10,080,000_l_.; making a total expenditure of 356,756,000_l_.\r\nIn the same period the Company has contracted loans to the extent of\r\n16,000,000_l_.; every farthing of which has gone to improvements,\r\nthe stated extent of which I believe to have been greatly magnified, and\r\nto pay the amiable ladies and gentlemen whose votes return to\r\nLeadenhall-street those immaculate Directors whom the Government seems\r\nso desirous of cherishing. All expenditure for improvements of every\r\nkind, and all dividends to stockholders, have been paid from loans\r\ncontracted during the last sixteen years; so that the whole revenue has\r\nbeen expended, leaving nothing for improvements and nothing for the\r\nCompany's dividends. This seems to me a formidable, an alarming state of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman spoke of the Indian debt coming upon the people\r\nof this country, expressing the opinion that if the Government of India\r\nwere transferred to the Crown--which assuredly it ought to be--the debt\r\nought so to be transferred. The debt is not in the present Budget,\r\nindeed, but it will certainly come before the House. I have already\r\nreferred to a memorable speech of the late Sir Robert Peel on this\r\nsubject, in 1842, just after he had come into office, and when, finding\r\nthe country left by the Whigs with an Exchequer peculiarly discouraging\r\nto a Chancellor of the Exchequer, he was about to propose that temporary\r\nincome-tax which has since become permanent. He said, after referring to\r\nthe affairs of Canada and China--\r\n\r\n  'For the purpose of bringing before the House a full and complete\r\n  view of our financial position, as I promised to do, I feel it to\r\n  be my duty to refer to a subject which has of late occupied\r\n  little attention in the House, but which I think might, with\r\n  advantage to the public, have attracted more of their regard--I\r\n  refer to the state of Indian finance, a subject which formerly\r\n  used to be thought not unworthy of the consideration of this\r\n  House. I am quite aware that there may appear to be no direct and\r\n  immediate connexion between the finances of India and those of\r\n  this country; but that would be a superficial view of our\r\n  relations with India which should omit the consideration of this\r\n  subject. Depend upon it, if the credit of India should become\r\n  disordered, if some great exertion should become necessary, then\r\n  the credit of England must be brought forward to its support, and\r\n  the collateral and indirect effect of disorders in Indian\r\n  finances would be felt extensively in this country. Sir, I am\r\n  sorry to say that Indian finance offers no consolation for the\r\n  state of finance in this country. I hold in my hand an account of\r\n  the finances of India, which I have every reason to believe is a\r\n  correct one. It is made up one month later than our own accounts--\r\n  to the 5th of May. It states the gross revenue of India, with the\r\n  charges on it; the interest of the debt; the surplus revenue, and\r\n  the charges paid on it in England; and there are two columns\r\n  which contain the net surplus and the net deficit. In the year\r\n  ending May, 1836, there was a surplus of 1,520,000_l_. from\r\n  the Indian revenue. In the year ending the 5th of May, 1837,\r\n  there was a surplus of 1,100,000_l_., which was reduced\r\n  rapidly in the year ending May, 1838, to one of 620,000_l_.\r\n  In the year ending the 5th of May, 1839, the surplus fell to\r\n  29,000_l_.; in the year ending the 5th of May, 1840, the\r\n  balance of the account changed, and so far from there being any\r\n  surplus, the deficit on the Indian revenue was 2,414,000_l_.\r\n  I am afraid I cannot calculate the deficit for the year ending\r\n  May, 1841, though it depends at present partly on estimate, at\r\n  much less than 2,334,000_l_. The House, then, will bear in\r\n  mind, that in fulfilment of the duty I have undertaken, I present\r\n  to them the deficit in this country for the current year to the\r\n  amount of 2,350,000_l_., with a certain prospect of a\r\n  deficit for the next year to the amount of at least\r\n  2,470,000_l_., independently of the increase to be expected\r\n  on account of China and Affghanistan, and that in India, that\r\n  great portion of our Empire, I show a deficit on the two last\r\n  years which will probably not be less than 4,700,000_l_.'--\r\n  [3 _Hansard_, lxi. 428-9.]\r\n\r\nNow, this deficit has in the period since 1842 been growing every year,\r\nwith the exception of two years, when, from accidental and precarious\r\ncircumstances, a surplus of between 300,000_l_. and\r\n400,000_l_. was made out. The course of deficit has now, however,\r\nbeen resumed, and there is probably no one in this House or in the\r\ncountry but the right hon. President of the Board of Control, who does\r\nnot perceive that the Burmese war will materially aggravate the amount\r\nof that deficit. Where is this to end? When the Board of Control was\r\nfirst established, the debt was 8,000,000_l_.; in 1825 it was\r\n25,000,000_l_.; in 1829 it was 34,000,000_l_.; in 1836,\r\n37,000,000_l_.; in 1843, 36,000,000_l_.; in 1849,\r\n44,000,000_l_.; in 1853, 47,000,000_l_.; and now, including\r\nthe bond debt at home and the debt in India, it is about\r\n51,000,000_l_. The military expenditure of India has increased\r\nsince the last Charter Act from 8,000,000_l_. a-year to more than\r\n12,000,000_l_. a-year, and now forms no less than 56 per cent. of\r\nthe whole expenditure. I believe that if the Indian Government would\r\nendeavour to improve the condition of the people by attending to\r\neconomic principles, by establishing better means of communication, by\r\npromoting irrigation, and by affording facilities for education, the\r\nIndian population would at once be convinced that there was a feeling of\r\nsympathy entertained towards them on the part of their rulers and\r\nconquerors, and the idea--which I believe prevails very extensively--\r\nthat we held India more with the object of extorting taxation than of\r\nbenefiting the people, would speedily be removed.\r\n\r\nWhen I come to consider the amount of the revenue, and its pressure upon\r\nthe population, I think I can show a state of things existing in India\r\nwhich cannot be paralleled in any other country in the world. The\r\nevidence of Mr. Davies and Mr. Stewart, collectors in Guzerat, shows\r\nthat in that district the actual taxation varies from 60 to 90 per cent.\r\nupon the gross produce of the soil. Mr. Campbell calculates the gross\r\nrevenue of India at about 27,000,000_l_.; and Mr. Kaye, a recent\r\nauthority, who, I presume, wrote his book at the India House, states\r\nthat the gross revenue was 29,000,000_l_. The land revenue is\r\n12,000,000_l_. or 13,000,000_l_.; and although the Government\r\ntook, or intended to take, all the rent, it is not half enough for them,\r\nand they are obliged to take as much more from other sources in order to\r\nenable them to maintain their establishments. I mention this fact to\r\nshow the enormous expense of the Indian Government, and the\r\nimpossibility of avoiding a great and dangerous financial crisis unless\r\nsome alteration is made in the present system. Mr. Campbell, speaking of\r\nthe Indian revenues under the Mogul Princes, says--\r\n\r\n  'The value of food, labour, &c., seems to have been much the same\r\n  as now--that is, infinitely cheaper than in Europe; and,\r\n  certainly, in comparison to the price of labour and all articles\r\n  of consumption, the revenue of the Moguls must have been more\r\n  effective than that of any modern State--I mean that it enabled\r\n  them to command more men and luxuries, and to have a greater\r\n  surplus.'\r\n\r\nI would ask the House to imagine that all steam engines, and all\r\napplications of mechanical power, were banished from this country; that\r\nwe were utterly dependent upon mere manual labour. What would you think\r\nif the Chancellor of the Exchequer, under such circumstances,\r\nendeavoured to levy the same taxation which is now borne by the country?\r\nFrom one end of India to the other, with very trifling exceptions, there\r\nis no such thing as a steam engine; but this poor population, without a\r\nsteam engine, without anything like first-rate tools, are called upon to\r\nbear, I will venture to say, the very heaviest taxation under which any\r\npeople ever suffered with the same means of paying it. Yet the whole of\r\nthis money, raised from so poor a population, which would in India buy\r\nfour times as much labour, and four times as much of the productions of\r\nthe country, as it would obtain in England, is not enough to keep up the\r\nestablishments of the Government; for during the last sixteen years the\r\nIndian Government has borrowed 16,000,000_l_. to pay the dividends\r\nto the proprietors in England.\r\n\r\nThe opium question has been alluded to by the right hon. Gentleman (Sir\r\nC. Wood). I must say I do not know any one connected with China, or at\r\nall acquainted with the subject, who is not of opinion that the opium\r\nrevenue is very near its termination. Even the favourite authority of\r\nthe President of the Board of Control, Mr. Marshman, declared his\r\nopinion that India was on the verge of a great financial crisis. Whether\r\nthe present Chinese Government retains its power, or the insurgents be\r\nsuccessful and a new dynasty be established, the scruple against the\r\nimportation of opium into China from India having once been removed, the\r\ntransition to the growth of the drug in China is very easy, and there\r\ncan scarcely be a doubt that opium will soon be as extensively\r\ncultivated in that country as ever it was in India. This might very soon\r\nproduce a loss of 3,000,000_l_. of revenue to the East India Company.\r\nThere has already been an annual deficit in the revenues of the East\r\nIndia Company for the last fifteen years; they have to bear the cost of\r\na Burmese war; and the annexation of new territory will only bring upon\r\nthem an increased charge, for Pegu will probably never repay its\r\nexpenses, and yet they have the prospect of losing 3,000,000_l_. of\r\ntheir revenue within a very few years. Now, what would the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer say if the President of the Board of Control came to that\r\nHouse and proposed to raise a loan upon the credit of this country for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining our territory in India? Would it not be\r\nbetter at once to ascertain whether the principles and policy on which\r\nwe have hitherto proceeded have not been faulty? Should we not rather\r\nendeavour to reduce our expenditure, to employ cheaper labour, to\r\nincrease the means of communication in India, which would enable us to\r\ndispense with a portion of our troops, and to make it a rule that the\r\nGovernor-General should have more honour when he came home, for not\r\nhaving extended by an acre the territory of our Indian possessions, than\r\nif he had added a province or a kingdom to them?\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed by the President of the Board of Control appears to me\r\nvery closely to resemble that which exists at present. The result, so\r\nfar as regards the real question, about which the public are most\r\ninterested, is this, that the twenty-four gentlemen who are directors of\r\nthe East India Company are, by a process of self-immolation, to be\r\nreduced to fifteen. I think this reduction will be one of the most\r\naffecting scenes in the history of the Government of India. As the East\r\nIndia Company keep a writer to record their history, I hope they also\r\nkeep an artist to give us an historical painting of this great event.\r\nThere we shall see the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Mangles), the hon.\r\nMember for Honiton (Sir J. W. Hogg), one of the hon. Members for the\r\nCity of London, and the other directors, meeting together, and looking\r\nmuch like shipwrecked men in a boat casting lots who should be thrown\r\noverboard. To the fifteen directors who are to remain, three others are\r\nto be added, and the result will be that, instead of having twenty-four\r\ngentlemen sitting in Leadenhall-street, to manage the affairs in India,\r\nthere will be eighteen. The present constituency is so bad that nothing\r\nthe President of the Board of Control can do can make it worse; but as\r\nthat right hon. Gentleman finds it impossible to make it better, he lets\r\nthe constituency remain as it was. The right hon. Baronet proposes that\r\nthe Crown should appoint six members of the Board who have been at least\r\nten years in India, so that there may at all events be that number of\r\ngentlemen at the Board lit for the responsible office in which they are\r\nplaced. But this is an admission that the remaining twelve members of\r\nthe Board are not fit for their office. They have two ingredients--the\r\none wholesome, the other poisonous; but there are two drops of poison to\r\none of wholesome nutriment. The right hon. Gentleman mixes them\r\ntogether, and then wants Parliament and the country to believe that he\r\nhas proposed a great measure.\r\n\r\nAs regards the right hon. Gentleman's speech, I must say that I have\r\nnever heard so great a one--I mean as to length--where the result, so\r\nfar as the real thing about which people wish to know, was so little.\r\nThe twelve gentlemen appointed by the present constituency are degraded\r\nalready by the right hon. Gentleman's declaration, that they are not\r\nelected in a satisfactory manner, and that they are not fit persons for\r\nthe government of India. They are, in fact, bankers and brewers, and men\r\nof all sorts, in the City of London, who find it their interest to get\r\ninto the Court of Directors--no matter by what channel--because it adds\r\nto the business of their bank, or whatever else may be the undertaking\r\nin which they are engaged; but who have no special qualification for the\r\ngovernment of India. If the Government thinks it right to have six good\r\ndirectors, let them abolish the twelve bad ones. Then it appears that\r\nthe Secret Department is to be retained. Speaking of this, Mr. Kaye,\r\nquoting the authority of Mr. Tucker, a distinguished director, said it\r\nwas no more than a secretary and a seal. Next comes a most extraordinary\r\nproposition. Hitherto the directors have undergone all the hardship of\r\ngoverning India for 300_l_. a-year; but the right hon. Gentleman\r\nnow proposes to raise their wages by 4_l_. per week each. I must\r\nsay, that if this body is to be salaried at all, and is not to have the\r\nprofit of the patronage enjoyed by the present Government, nothing can\r\nbe worse economy than this, with a view to obtaining a body which shall\r\ncommand the respect, and have the amount of influence, requisite for\r\nconducting the Government of India. Sixteen of the directors, receiving\r\n500_l_. a-year each--why, they would have to pay their clerks much\r\nmore!--and the chairman and the deputy-chairman 1,000_l_. a-year\r\neach. The whole of the right hon. Gentleman's scheme seems to bear the\r\nmarks of--I am almost afraid to say what; but he seems to have tried to\r\nplease every one in framing his great proposition, and at last has\r\nlanded the House in a sort of half measure, which neither the East India\r\nCompany nor India wants. If I had made a speech such as the right hon.\r\nGentleman has delivered, and believed what he said, I would leave the\r\nIndian Government as it is; but if I thought it necessary to alter the\r\nGovernment, I would do so on principle essentially. The right hon.\r\nGentleman is afraid of bringing the Government of India under the\r\nauthority of the Crown. What, I should like to know, would have been\r\ndone if India had been conquered by the troops of the Crown? We should\r\nthen never have sent some thirty men into a bye-street of London to\r\ndistribute patronage and govern a great country. The Government of India\r\nwould then have been made a department of the Government, with a Council\r\nand a Minister of State. But it appears that the old system of hocus-\r\npocus is still to be carried on.\r\n\r\nThis is no question of Manchester against Essex--of town against\r\ncountry--of Church against Nonconformity. It is a question in which we\r\nall have an interest, and in which our children may be more deeply\r\ninterested than we are ourselves. Should anything go wrong with the\r\nfinances, we must bear the burden; or should the people of India by our\r\ntreatment be goaded into insurrection, we must reconquer the country, or\r\nbe ignominiously driven out of it. I will not be a party to a state of\r\nthings which might lead to the writing of a narrative like this on the\r\nhistory of our relations with that empire. Let the House utterly\r\ndisregard the predictions of mischief likely to result from such a\r\nchange in the Government of India as that which I advocate. When the\r\ntrade was thrown open, and the Company was deprived of the monopoly of\r\ncarrying, they said the Chinese would poison the tea. There is nothing\r\ntoo outrageous or ridiculous for the Company to say in order to prevent\r\nthe Legislature from placing affairs on a more honest footing. I object\r\nto the Bill, because--as the right hon. Gentleman admitted--it\r\nmaintains a double Government. In the unstatesmanlike course which the\r\nright hon. Gentleman is pursuing, he will, no doubt, be especially\r\nbacked by the noble Lord the Member for London. I only wish that some of\r\nthe younger blood in the Cabinet might have had their way upon this\r\nquestion. Nothing can induce me to believe, after the evidence which is\r\nbefore the public, that this measure has the approbation of an united\r\nCabinet. It is not possible that thirteen sensible gentlemen, who have\r\nany pretensions to form a Cabinet, could agree to a measure of this\r\nnature. I am more anxious than I can express that Parliament should\r\nlegislate rightly in this matter. Let us act so at this juncture that it\r\nmay be said of us hereafter--that whatever crimes England originally\r\ncommitted in conquering India, she at least made the best of her\r\nposition by governing the country as wisely as possible, and left the\r\nrecords and traces of a humane and liberal sway.\r\n\r\nI recollect having heard the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton\r\n(Viscount Palmerston) deliver in this House one of the best speeches I\r\never listened to. On that occasion the noble Lord gloried in the proud\r\nname of England, and, pointing to the security with which an Englishman\r\nmight travel abroad, he triumphed in the idea that his countrymen might\r\nexclaim, in the spirit of the ancient Roman, _Civis Romanus sum_.\r\nLet us not resemble the Romans merely in our national privileges and\r\npersonal security. The Romans were great conquerors, but where they\r\nconquered, they governed wisely. The nations they conquered were\r\nimpressed so indelibly with the intellectual character of their masters,\r\nthat, after fourteen centuries of decadence, the traces of civilisation\r\nare still distinguishable. Why should not we act a similar part in\r\nIndia? There never was a more docile people, never a more tractable\r\nnation. The opportunity is present, and the power is not wanting. Let us\r\nabandon the policy of aggression, and confine ourselves to a territory\r\nten times the size of France, with a population four times as numerous\r\nas that of the United Kingdom. Surely that is enough to satisfy the most\r\ngluttonous appetite for glory and supremacy. Educate the people of\r\nIndia, govern them wisely, and gradually the distinctions of caste will\r\ndisappear, and they will look upon us rather as benefactors than as\r\nconquerors. And if we desire to see Christianity, in some form,\r\nprofessed in that country, we shall sooner attain our object by setting\r\nthe example of a high-toned Christian morality, than by any other means\r\nwe can employ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINDIA\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, JUNE 24, 1858.\r\n\r\n_From Hansard_.\r\n[After the suppression of the Indian mutiny, Lord Palmerston's\r\nGovernment determined to introduce a Bill the object of which was to\r\nplace the possessions of the East India Company under the direct\r\nauthority of the Crown. This Bill was introduced by Lord Palmerston on\r\nFebruary 12. But the Government fell a few days afterwards, on the\r\nConspiracy Bill, and Lord Palmerston's Bill was withdrawn. On March 26\r\nthe new Government introduced their own Bill, which was known as the\r\nIndia Bill No. 2. The chief peculiarity of this Bill was that five\r\nmembers in the proposed council of eighteen should be chosen by the\r\nconstituencies of the following cities:--London, Manchester, Liverpool,\r\nGlasgow, and Belfast. The scheme was unpopular, and Lord Russell\r\nproposed that it should be withdrawn, and that resolutions should be\r\npassed in a Committee of the whole House, the acceptance of which might\r\nprove a guide to the proceedings of the Government. The suggestion was\r\naccepted by Mr. Disraeli, and in consequence India Bill No. 3 was\r\nbrought in, and read a second time on June 24.]\r\n\r\nI do not rise for the purpose of opposing the second reading of this\r\nBill--on the contrary, if any hon. Member thinks proper to divide the\r\nHouse upon it, I shall vote with the noble Lord. I must say, however,\r\nthat there are many clauses in the Bill to which I entertain serious\r\nobjections. Some of them will, I hope, be amended as the Bill passes\r\nthrough Committee; but if that is not the case, I can only hope that, as\r\nthe Bill of 1853 is abandoned in 1858, within the next five years the\r\nHouse of Commons will take some further steps with regard to this\r\nquestion, with the view of simplifying the Government of India as\r\ncarried on in England. I wish to take this opportunity of making some\r\nobservations upon the general question of Indian government, which it\r\nmight have been out of place to have made during the discussion of the\r\nvarious Resolutions which have been agreed to by the House.\r\n\r\nI think it must have struck every hon. Member that, while two\r\nGovernments have proposed great changes with regard to the government of\r\nIndia, no good case has really been made out for such changes in the\r\nspeeches of the noble Lord and the right hon. Gentleman by whom the two\r\nIndia Bills have been introduced. That opinion, I know, will meet with a\r\nresponse from two or three hon. Gentlemen on this (the Opposition) side\r\nof the House. It occurred to me when the noble Lord at the head of the\r\nlate Government (Viscount Palmerston) introduced his Bill--and I made\r\nthe observation when the present Chancellor of the Exchequer brought\r\nforward his measure--that if the House knew no more of the question than\r\nthey learned from the speeches of the Ministers, they could not form any\r\nclear notion why it was proposed to overthrow the East India Company.\r\nThe hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Mangles) has expressed a similar\r\nopinion several times during the progress of these discussions. The\r\nright hon. Member for Carlisle (Sir James Graham) has also said that the\r\nEast India Company was being dealt with in a manner in which animals\r\nintended for sacrifice were treated in Eastern countries and in ancient\r\ntimes,--they were decked with garlands when they were led out for\r\nimmolation. That is true; but it does not therefore follow that the\r\nHouse is not quite right in the course it is taking. It must be clear\r\nthat the moment the House of Commons met this Session there was only one\r\ncourse which the then Government could adopt with reference to this\r\nquestion. A feeling existed throughout the country--I believe I may say\r\nit was universal--that for a long time past the government of India had\r\nnot been a good government; that grave errors--if not grievous crimes--\r\nhad been committed in that country. I think the conscience of the nation\r\nhad been touched on this question, and they came by a leap, as it were--\r\nby an irrepressible instinct--to the conclusion that the East India\r\nCompany must be abolished, and that another and, as the nation hoped, a\r\nbetter government should be established for that country. There was a\r\ngeneral impression, arising from past discussion in Parliament, that the\r\nindustry of the people of India had been grievously neglected; that\r\nthere was great reason for complaint with respect to the administration\r\nof justice; and that with regard to the wars entered into by the Indian\r\nGovernment, there was much of which the people of England had reason to\r\nbe ashamed.\r\n\r\nIt has been said by some that these faults are to be attributed to the\r\nBoard of Control; but I have never defended the Board of Control. I\r\nbelieve everything the East India Company has said of the Board of\r\nControl--to its discredit; and I believe that everything the Board of\r\nControl has said to the discredit of the East India Company to be\r\nperfectly true. There was also a general impression that the expenditure\r\nof the East India Government was excessive; and that it had been proved\r\nbefore more than one Committee that the taxes imposed upon the people of\r\nIndia were onerous to the last degree. These subjects were discussed in\r\n1853, at which time, in my opinion, the change now proposed ought to\r\nhave been effected. Subsequently the calamitous events of 1857 and 1858\r\noccurred; and the nation came at once to the conclusion--a conclusion\r\nwhich I think no disinterested person could resist--that it was\r\nimpossible that India and its vast population could any longer be\r\nretained under the form of government which has existed up to this\r\nperiod. If, then, a change was inevitable, the question was how it\r\nshould be accomplished and what should be done. I think it is quite\r\nclear that the course the noble Lord has pursued is right--namely, that\r\nof insisting that during this present Session, and without delay, the\r\nfoundation of all reform in the government of India should be commenced\r\nat home, because we cannot take a single step in the direction of any\r\nreal and permanent improvement in the Indian Government until we have\r\nreformed what I may call the basis of that Government by changes to be\r\neffected in this country.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the change which is proposed, and which ought to be made?\r\nFor my own part, in considering these questions, I cannot altogether\r\napprove the Bill now before the House. What we want with regard to the\r\ngovernment of India is that which in common conversation is called 'a\r\nlittle more daylight.' We want more simplicity and more responsibility.\r\nI objected to the scheme originally proposed by the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer because it did not provide these requisites; that scheme so\r\nclosely resembled the system we were about to overthrow that I could not\r\nbring myself to regard it favourably. In considering the subject before\r\nParliament met, I asked myself this question:--'Suppose there had never\r\nbeen an East India Company or any such corporation,--suppose India had\r\nbeen conquered by the forces of the Crown, commanded by generals acting\r\nunder the authority of the Crown,--how should we then have proposed to\r\ngovern distant dominions of vast extent, and with a population that\r\ncould scarcely be counted?' I believe such a system of government as has\r\nhitherto existed would never have been established; and if such a system\r\nhad not existed I am convinced that no Minister would have proposed the\r\nplan now submitted to the House.\r\n\r\nI think the government would have been placed in the hands of a\r\nSecretary of State, with his secretaries, clerks, and staffs of\r\nofficers, or of a small Board, so small as to prevent responsibility\r\nfrom being diffused and divided, if not actually destroyed. I suspect\r\nthat the only reason why the Country or Parliament can be disposed to\r\napprove the large Council now proposed is, that they have seen something\r\nlike a Council heretofore, formerly of twenty-four, and subsequently of\r\neighteen members, and I believe there is something like timidity on the\r\npart of the House, and probably on the part of the Government, which\r\nhinders them from making so great a change as I have suggested to the\r\nsimple plan which would probably have existed had no such body as the\r\nEast India Company ever been established. I am willing to admit candidly\r\nthat if the government of India at home should be so greatly simplified\r\nit will be necessary that very important changes should be made in the\r\ngovernment in India. I agree with the noble Lord (Lord Stanley) that the\r\nrepresentatives of the Crown in India must have power as well as\r\nresponsibility; that they should be enabled to deal with emergencies,\r\nand to settle the hundred or the thousand questions that must arise\r\namong 100,000,000 of people, without sending 10,000 miles to this\r\ncountry to ask questions which ought to be settled at once by some\r\ncompetent authority on the spot.\r\n\r\nThere are two modes of governing India, and the hon. Member for\r\nLeominster (Mr. Willoughby), who has been a very distinguished servant\r\nof the East India Company, has publicly expressed his views upon this\r\nquestion. I have been very much struck with a note attached to the\r\npublished report of his speech, referring to the multifarious duties\r\ndischarged by the Directors of the East India Company. That note states\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  'A despatch may be received, containing 60, or 100, or 200 cases;\r\n  and the despatch, in itself voluminous, is rendered more so by\r\n  collections attached to it, containing copies of all former\r\n  correspondence on the subject or subjects, and of all letters\r\n  written thereon by various local officers, and all papers\r\n  relating thereto. There has not long since been in the Revenue\r\n  Department a despatch with 16,263 pages of collections. In 1845\r\n  there was one in the same Department with 46,000 pages, and it\r\n  was stated that Mr. Canning, some years since in the House of\r\n  Commons, mentioned a military despatch to which were attached\r\n  13,511 pages of collections.'\r\n\r\nThe hon. Gentleman did not say in his speech that anybody at the India\r\nHouse ever read all these things. It was quite dear that if the\r\nDirectors were to pretend to go through a waggon-load of documents\r\ncoming to Leadenhall-street every year it must be only a pretence, and\r\nif they want to persuade the House that they give attention to only one-\r\ntenth part of these papers they must think the House more credulous than\r\nit is in matters of this kind. That is one mode of governing India. It\r\nis the mode which has been adopted and the mode which has failed. If we\r\nare to have the details settled here, I am perfectly certain we can have\r\nno good government in India. I have alluded on a former occasion to a\r\nmatter which occurred in a Committee upstairs. A gentleman who was\r\nexamined stated that he had undertaken to brew a wholesome beer, and\r\nquite as good as that exported for the supply of the troops, somewhere\r\nin the Presidency of Madras, for one-sixth of the price paid by\r\nGovernment for that exported to India from England; that the experiment\r\nwas completely successful; that the memorandum or record with regard to\r\nit was sent home, no doubt forming part of the thousands of pages to\r\nwhich reference has been made; and that it was buried in the heap in\r\nwhich it came, because for years nothing was heard of a proposition\r\nwhich would have saved the Government a very large amount annually and\r\nopened a new industry to the population and capital of India. I believe\r\nthis system of government is one of delay and disappointment--one,\r\nactually, of impossibility--one which can by no means form a complete\r\ntheory of government as held by any persons in the House; and that the\r\nother, the simpler system, which I wish the House to undertake, would be\r\none of action, progress, and results, with regard to India, such as we\r\nhave never yet seen and never can see until there is a complete\r\nsimplification of the Indian Government in this country.\r\n\r\nI come now to the question--and it is for this question that I have\r\nwished principally to address the House--if at any time we obtain the\r\nsimplicity which I contend for with regard to the government at home,\r\nwhat changes will it be desirable to make in the government in India?\r\nAnd I would make one observation at this point, that in all the\r\nstatements and arguments which I hope to use, I beg the House to believe\r\nthat I use them with the greatest possible deference, with the feeling\r\nthat this is a question upon which no man is at all entitled to\r\ndogmatize, that it is a vast question which we all look at as one we are\r\nscarcely capable of handling and determining. I submit my views to the\r\nHouse because I have considered the subject more or less for many years,\r\nand I believe I am actuated by the simple and honest desire of\r\ncontributing something to the information and knowledge of Parliament\r\nwith regard to its duty upon this great question.\r\n\r\nWhat is it we have to complain of in India? What is it that the people\r\nof India, if they spoke by my mouth, have to complain of? They would\r\ntell the House that, as a rule, throughout almost all the Presidencies,\r\nand throughout those Presidencies most which have been longest under\r\nBritish rule, the cultivators of the soil, the great body of the\r\npopulation of India, are in a condition of great impoverishment, of\r\ngreat dejection, and of great suffering. I have, on former occasions,\r\nquoted to the House the report of a Committee which I obtained ten years\r\nago, upon which sat several members of the Court of Directors; and they\r\nall agreed to report as much as I have now stated to the House--the\r\nReport being confined chiefly to the Presidencies of Bombay and Madras.\r\nIf I were now submitting the case of the population of India I would say\r\nthat the taxes of India are more onerous and oppressive than the taxes\r\nof any other country in the world. I think I could demonstrate that\r\nproposition to the House. I would show that industry is neglected by the\r\nGovernment to a greater extent probably than is the case in any other\r\ncountry in the world which has been for any length of time under what is\r\ntermed a civilized and Christian government. I should be able to show\r\nfrom the notes and memoranda of eminent men in India, of the Governor of\r\nBengal, Mr. Halliday, for example, that there is not and never has been\r\nin any country pretending to be civilized, a condition of things to be\r\ncompared with that which exists under the police administration of the\r\nprovince of Bengal. With regard to the courts of justice I may say the\r\nsame thing. I could quote passages from books written in favour of the\r\nCompany with all the bias which the strongest friends of the Company can\r\nhave, in which the writers declare that, precisely in proportion as\r\nEnglish courts of justice have extended, have perjury and all the evils\r\nwhich perjury introduces into the administration of justice prevailed\r\nthroughout the Presidencies of India. With regard to public works, if I\r\nwere speaking for the Natives of India, I would state this fact, that in\r\na single English county there are more roads--more travelable roads--\r\nthan are to be found in the whole of India; and I would say also that\r\nthe single city of Manchester, in the supply of its inhabitants with the\r\nsingle article of water, has spent a larger sum of money than the East\r\nIndia Company has spent in the fourteen years from 1834 to 1848 in\r\npublic works of every kind throughout the whole of its vast dominions. I\r\nwould say that the real activity of the Indian Government has been an\r\nactivity of conquest and annexation--of conquest and annexation which\r\nafter a time has led to a fearful catastrophe which has enforced on the\r\nHouse an attention to the question of India, which but for that\r\ncatastrophe I fear the House would not have given it.\r\n\r\nIf there were another charge to be made against the past Government of\r\nIndia, it would be with regard to the state of its finances. Where was\r\nthere a bad Government whose finances were in good order? Where was\r\nthere a really good Government whose finances were in bad order? Is\r\nthere a better test in the long run of the condition of a people and the\r\nmerits of a Government than the state of the finances? And yet not in\r\nour own time, but going back through all the pages of Mill or of any\r\nother History of India we find the normal condition of the finances of\r\nIndia has been that of deficit and bankruptcy. I maintain that if that\r\nbe so, the Government is a bad Government. It has cost more to govern\r\nIndia than the Government has been able to extract from the population\r\nof India. The Government has not been scrupulous as to the amount of\r\ntaxes or the mode in which they have been levied; but still, to carry on\r\nthe government of India according to the system which has heretofore\r\nprevailed, more has been required than the Government has been able to\r\nextract by any system of taxation known to them from the population over\r\nwhich they have ruled. It has cost more than 30,000,000_l_. a-year\r\nto govern India, and the gross revenue being somewhere about\r\n30,000,000_l_., and there being a deficit, the deficit has had to\r\nbe made up by loans. The Government has obtained all they could from the\r\npopulation; it is not enough, and they have had to borrow from the\r\npopulation and from Europeans at a high rate of interest to make up the\r\nsum which has been found to be necessary. They have a debt of\r\n60,000,000_l_.; and it is continually increasing; they always have\r\na loan open; and while their debt is increasing their credit has been\r\nfalling, because they have not treated their creditors very honourably\r\non one or two occasions, and chiefly, of course, on account of the\r\ncalamities which have recently happened in India. There is one point\r\nwith regard to taxation which I wish to explain to the House, and I hope\r\nthat, in the reforms to which the noble Lord is looking forward, it will\r\nnot be overlooked. I have said that the gross revenue is\r\n30,000,000_l_. Exclusive of the opium revenue, which is not,\r\nstrictly speaking, and hardly at all, a tax upon the people, I set down\r\nthe taxation of the country at something like 25,000,000_l_. Hon.\r\nGentlemen must not compare 25,000,000_l_. of taxation in India with\r\n60,000,000_l_. of taxation in England. They must bear in mind that\r\nin India they could have twelve days' labour of a man for the same sum\r\nin silver or gold which they have to pay for one day's labour of a man\r\nin England; that if, for example, this _l_.25,000,000 were expended\r\nin purchasing labour, that sum would purchase twelve times as much in\r\nIndia as in England--that is to say, that the 25,000,000_l_. would\r\npurchase as many days' labour in India as 300,000,000_l_. would\r\npurchase in England. [An Hon. Member: 'How much is the labour worth?']\r\nThat is precisely what I am coming to. If the labour of a man is only\r\nworth 2_d_. a-day, they could not expect as much revenue from him\r\nas if it were 2_s_. a-day. That is just the point to which I wish\r\nthe hon. Gentleman would turn his attention. We have in England a\r\npopulation which, for the sake of argument, I will call 30,000,000. We\r\nhave in India a population of 150,000,000. Therefore, the population of\r\nIndia is five times as great as the population of England. We raise in\r\nIndia, reckoning by the value of labour, taxation equivalent to\r\n300,000,000_l_., which is five times the English revenue. Some one\r\nmay probably say, therefore, that the taxation in India and in England\r\nappears to be about the same, and no great injury is done. But it must\r\nbe borne in mind that in England we have an incalculable power of steam,\r\nof machinery, of modes of transit, roads, canals, railways, and\r\neverything which capital and human invention can bring to help the\r\nindustry of the people; while in India there is nothing of the kind. In\r\nIndia there is scarcely a decent road, the rivers are not bridged, there\r\nare comparatively no steam engines, and none of those aids to industry\r\nthat meet us at every step in Great Britain and Ireland. Suppose steam-\r\nengines, machinery, and modes of transit abolished in England, how much\r\nrevenue would the Chancellor of the Exchequer obtain from the people of\r\nEngland? Instead of 60,000,000_l_. a-year, would he get\r\n10,000,000_l_.? I doubt it very much. If the House will follow out\r\nthe argument, they will come to the conclusion that the taxes of the\r\npeople of India are oppressive to the last degree, and that the\r\nGovernment which has thus taxed them can be tolerated no longer, and\r\nmust be put an end to at once and for ever. I wish to say something\r\nabout the manner in which these great expenses are incurred. The\r\nextravagance of the East India Government is notorious to all. I believe\r\nthere never was any other service under the sun paid at so high a rate\r\nas the exclusive Civil Service of the East India Company. Clergymen and\r\nmissionaries can be got to go out to India for a moderate sum--private\r\nsoldiers and officers of the army go out for a moderate remuneration--\r\nmerchants are content to live in the cities of India for a percentage or\r\nprofit not greatly exceeding the ordinary profits of commerce. But the\r\nCivil Service, because it is bound up with those who were raised by it\r\nand who dispense the patronage of India, receive a rate of payment which\r\nwould be incredible if we did not know it to be true, and which, knowing\r\nit to be true, we must admit to be monstrous. The East India Government\r\nscatters salaries about at Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Agra, Lahore, and\r\nhalf a dozen other cities, which are up to the mark of those of the\r\nPrime Minister and Secretaries of State in this country. These salaries\r\nare framed upon the theory that India is a mine of inexhaustible wealth,\r\nalthough no one has found it to be so but the members of the Civil\r\nService of the East India Company. The policy of the Government is at\r\nthe bottom of the constant deficit. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has\r\ntwice recently declared that expenditure depends upon policy. That is as\r\ntrue in India as in England, and it is the policy that has been pursued\r\nthere which renders the revenue liable to this constantly recurring\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\nI have come to the conclusion, which many hon. Members probably share\r\nwith me, that the edifice we have reared in India is too vast. There are\r\nfew men now, and least of all those connected with the East India\r\nCompany, who, looking back to the policy that has been pursued, will not\r\nbe willing to admit that it has not been judicious but hazardous--that\r\nterritories have been annexed that had better have been left\r\nindependent, and that wars have been undertaken which were as needless\r\nas they were altogether unjustifiable. The immense empire that has been\r\nconquered is too vast for management, its base is in decay, and during\r\nthe last twelve months it has appeared to be tottering to its fall. Who\r\nor what is the instrument--the Cabinet, the Government, or the person--\r\nby whom this evil policy is carried on?\r\n\r\nThe greatest officer in India is the Governor-General. He is the ruler\r\nof about one-fifth--certainly more than one-sixth--of the human race.\r\nThe Emperors of France and Russia are but the governors of provinces\r\ncompared with the power, the dignity, and the high estate of the\r\nGovernor-General of India. Now, over this officer, almost no real\r\ncontrol is exercised. If I were to appeal to the two hon. Gentlemen who\r\nhave frequently addressed the House during these debates (Colonel Sykes\r\nand Mr. Willoughby), they would probably admit that the Governor-General\r\nof India is an officer of such high position that scarcely any control\r\ncan be exercised over him either in India or in England. Take the case\r\nof the Marquess of Dalhousie for example. I am not about to make an\r\nattack upon him, for the occasion is too solemn for personal\r\ncontroversies. But the annexation of Sattara, of the Punjab, of Nagpore,\r\nand of Oude occurred under his rule. I will not go into the case of\r\nSattara; but one of its Princes, and one of the most magnanimous Princes\r\nthat India ever produced, suffered and died most unjustly in exile,\r\neither through the mistakes or the crimes of the Government of India.\r\nThis, however, was not done under the Government of Lord Dalhousie. As\r\nto the annexation of Nagpore, the House has never heard anything about\r\nit to this hour. There has been no message from the Crown or statement\r\nof the Government relative to that annexation. Hon. Members have indeed\r\nheard from India that the dresses and wardrobes of the ladies of its\r\nCourt have been exposed to sale, like a bankrupt's stock, in the\r\nhaberdashers' shops of Calcutta--a thing likely to incense and horrify\r\nthe people of India who witnessed it.\r\n\r\nTake, again, the case of the Burmese war. The Governor-General entered\r\ninto it, and annexed the province of Pegu, and to this day there has\r\nbeen no treaty with the King of Burmah. If that case had been brought\r\nbefore the House, it is impossible that the war with Burmah could have\r\nbeen entered upon. I do not believe that there is one man in England\r\nwho, knowing the facts, would say that this war was just or necessary in\r\nany sense. The Governor-General has an army of 300,000 men under his\r\ncommand; he is a long way from home; he is highly connected with the\r\ngoverning classes at home; there are certain reasons that make war\r\npalatable to large classes in India; and he is so powerful that he\r\nenters into these great military operations almost uncontrolled by the\r\nopinion of the Parliament and people of England. He may commit any\r\namount of blunders or crimes against the moral law, and he will still\r\ncome home loaded with dignities and in the enjoyment of pensions. Does\r\nit not become the power and character of this House to examine narrowly\r\nthe origin of the misfortunes and disgraces of the grave catastrophe\r\nwhich has just occurred? The place of the Governor-General is too high--\r\nhis power is too great--and I believe that this particular office and\r\nofficer are very much responsible--of course under the Government at\r\nhome--for the disasters that have taken place.\r\n\r\nOnly think of a Governor-General of India writing to an Indian Prince,\r\nthe ruler over many millions of men in the heart of India, 'Remember you\r\nare but as the dust under my feet' Passages like these are left out of\r\ndespatches, when laid on the table of the House of Commons:--it would\r\nnot do for the Parliament or the Crown, or the people of England to know\r\nthat their officer addressed language like this to a Native Prince. The\r\nfact is that a Governor-General of India, unless he be such a man as is\r\nnot found more than once in a century, is very liable to have his head\r\nturned, and to form ambitious views, which are mainly to be gratified by\r\nsuccessful wars and the annexation of province after province during the\r\nperiod of his rule. The 'Services' are always ready to help him in these\r\nplans. I am not sure that the President of the Board of Control could\r\nnot give evidence on this subject, for I have heard something of what\r\nhappened when the noble Lord was in India. When the Burmese war broke\r\nout, the noble Lord could no doubt tell the House that, without\r\ninquiring into the quarrel or its causes, the press of India, which was\r\ndevoted to the 'Services', and the 'Services' themselves, united in\r\nuniversal approbation of the course taken by the Governor-General.\r\nJustice to Pegu and Burmah and the taxes to be raised for the support of\r\nthe war were forgotten, and nothing but visions of more territory and\r\nmore patronage floated before the eyes of the official English in India.\r\nI contend that the power of the Governor-General is too great and the\r\noffice too high to be held by the subject of any power whatsoever, and\r\nespecially by any subject of the Queen of England.\r\n\r\nI should propose, if I were in a position to offer a scheme in the shape\r\nof a Bill to the House, as an indispensable preliminary to the wise\r\ngovernment of India in future, such as would be creditable to Parliament\r\nand advantageous to the people of India, that the office of Governor-\r\nGeneral should be abolished. Perhaps some hon. Gentlemen may think this\r\na very unreasonable proposition. Many people thought it unreasonable in\r\n1853 when it was proposed to abolish the East India Company; but now\r\nParliament and the country believe it to be highly reasonable and\r\nproper; and I am not sure that I could not bring before the House\r\nreasons to convince them that the abolition of the office of Governor-\r\nGeneral is one of the most sensible and one of the most Conservative\r\nproposals ever brought forward in connection with the Government of\r\nIndia. I believe the duties of the Governor-General are far greater than\r\nany human being can adequately fulfil. He has a power omnipotent to\r\ncrush anything that is good. If he so wishes, he can overbear and\r\noverrule whatever is proposed for the welfare of India, while, as to\r\ndoing anything that is good, I could show that with regard to the vast\r\ncountries over which he rules, he is really almost powerless to effect\r\nanything that those countries require. The hon. Gentleman behind me\r\n(Colonel Sykes) has told us there are twenty nations in India, and that\r\nthere are twenty languages. Has it ever happened before that any one man\r\ngoverned twenty nations, speaking twenty different languages, and bound\r\nthem together in one great and compact empire? [An hon. Member here made\r\nan observation.] My hon. Friend mentions a great Parthian monarch. No\r\ndoubt there have been men strong in arm and in head, and of stern\r\nresolution, who have kept great empires together during their lives; but\r\nas soon as they went the way of all flesh, and descended, like the\r\nmeanest of their subjects, to the tomb, the provinces they had ruled\r\nwere divided into several States, and their great empires vanished. I\r\nmight ask the noble Lord below me (Lord John Russell) and the noble Lord\r\nthe Member for Tiverton (the noble Lord the Member for King's Lynn has\r\nnot as yet experience on this point), whether, when they came to appoint\r\na Governor-General of India, they did not find it one of the most\r\nserious and difficult duties they could be called on to perform? I do\r\nnot know at this moment, and I never have known, a man competent to\r\ngovern India; and if any man says he is competent, he sets himself up at\r\na much higher value than those who are acquainted with him are likely to\r\nset him. Let the House look at the making of the laws for twenty nations\r\nspeaking twenty languages. Look at the regulations of the police for\r\ntwenty nations speaking twenty languages. Look at the question of public\r\nworks as it affects twenty nations speaking twenty languages; where\r\nthere is no municipal power and no combinations of any kind, such as\r\nfacilitate the construction of public works in this country. Inevitably\r\nall those duties that devolve on every good government must be neglected\r\nby the Governor-General of India, however wise, capable, and honest he\r\nmay be in the performance of his duties, because the duties laid upon\r\nhim are such as no man now living or who ever lived can or could\r\nproperly sustain.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked what I would substitute for the Governor-Generalship of\r\nIndia. Now, I do not propose to abolish the office of Governor-General\r\nof India this Session. I am not proposing any clause in the Bill, and if\r\nI were to propose one to carry out the idea I have expressed, I might be\r\nanswered by the argument, that a great part of the population of India\r\nis in a state of anarchy, and that it would be most inconvenient, if not\r\ndangerous, to abolish the office of Governor-General at such a time. I\r\ndo not mean to propose such a thing now; but I take this opportunity of\r\nstating my views, in the hope that when we come to 1863, we may perhaps\r\nbe able to consider the question more in the light in which I am\r\nendeavouring to present it to the House. I would propose that, instead\r\nof having a Governor-General and an Indian empire, we should have\r\nneither the one nor the other. I would propose that we should have\r\nPresidencies, and not an Empire. If I were a Minister--which the House\r\nwill admit is a bold figure of speech--and if the House were to agree\r\nwith me--which is also an essential point--I would propose to have at\r\nleast five Presidencies in India, and I would have the governments of\r\nthose Presidencies perfectly equal in rank and in salary. The capitals\r\nof those Presidencies would probably be Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Agra,\r\nand Lahore. I will take the Presidency of Madras as an illustration.\r\nMadras has a population of some 20,000,000. We all know its position on\r\nthe map, and that it has the advantage of being more compact,\r\ngeographically speaking, than the other Presidencies. It has a Governor\r\nand a Council. I would give to it a Governor and a Council still, but\r\nwould confine all their duties to the Presidency of Madras, and I would\r\ntreat it just as if Madras was the only portion of India connected with\r\nthis country. I would have its finance, its taxation, its justice, and\r\nits police departments, as well as its public works and military\r\ndepartments, precisely the same as if it were a State having no\r\nconnection with any other part of India, and recognized only as a\r\ndependency of this country. I would propose that the Government of every\r\nPresidency should correspond with the Secretary for India in England,\r\nand that there should be telegraphic communications between all the\r\nPresidencies in India, as I hope before long to see a telegraphic\r\ncommunication between the office of the noble Lord (Lord Stanley) and\r\nevery Presidency over which he presides. I shall no doubt be told that\r\nthere are insuperable difficulties in the way of such an arrangement,\r\nand I shall be sure to hear of the military difficulty. Now, I do not\r\nprofess to be an authority on military affairs, but I know that military\r\nmen often make great mistakes. I would have the army divided, each\r\nPresidency having its own army, just as now, care being taken to have\r\nthem kept distinct; and I see no danger of any confusion or\r\nmisunderstanding, when an emergency arose, in having them all brought\r\ntogether to carry out the views of the Government. There is one question\r\nwhich it is important to bear in mind, and that is with regard to the\r\nCouncils in India. I think every Governor of a Presidency should have an\r\nassistant Council, but differently constituted from what they now are. I\r\nwould have an open Council. The noble Lord the Member for London used\r\nsome expressions the other night which I interpreted to mean that it was\r\nnecessary to maintain in all its exclusiveness the system of the Civil\r\nService in India. In that I entirely differ from the noble Lord. [Lord\r\nJ. Russell here indicated dissent.] The noble Lord corrects me in that\r\nstatement, and therefore I must have been mistaken. What we want is to\r\nmake the Governments of the Presidencies governments for the people of\r\nthe Presidencies; not governments for the civil servants of the Crown,\r\nbut for the non-official mercantile classes from England who settle\r\nthere, and for the 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 of Natives in each\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nI should propose to do that which has been done with great advantage in\r\nCeylon. I have received a letter from an officer who has been in the\r\nservice of the East India Company, and who told me a fact which has\r\ngratified me very much. He says--\r\n\r\n  'At a public dinner at Colombo, in 1835, to the Governor, Sir\r\n  Wilmot Horton, at which I was present, the best speech of the\r\n  evening was made by a native nobleman of Candy, and a member of\r\n  Council. It was remarkable for its appropriate expression, its\r\n  sound sense, and the deliberation and ease that marked the\r\n  utterance of his feelings. There was no repetition or useless\r\n  phraseology or flattery, and it was admitted by all who heard him\r\n  to be the soundest and neatest speech of the night.'\r\n\r\nThis was in Ceylon. It is not, of course, always the best man who can\r\nmake the best speech; but if what I have read could be said of a native\r\nof Ceylon, it could be said of thousands in India. We need not go beyond\r\nthe walls of this House to find a head bronzed by an Indian sun equal to\r\nthe ablest heads of those who adorn its benches. And in every part of\r\nIndia we all know that it would be an insult to the people of India to\r\nsay that it is not the same. There are thousands of persons in India who\r\nare competent to take any position to which the Government may choose to\r\nadvance them. If the Governor of each Presidency were to have in his\r\nCouncil some of the officials of his Government, some of the non-\r\nofficial Europeans resident in the Presidency, and two or three at least\r\nof the intelligent Natives of the Presidency in whom the people would\r\nhave some confidence, you would have begun that which will be of\r\ninestimable value hereafter--you would have begun to unite the\r\ngovernment with the governed; and unless you do that, no government will\r\nbe safe, and any hurricane may overturn it or throw it into confusion.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose the Governor-General gone, the Presidencies established,\r\nthe Governors equal in rank and dignity, and their Councils constituted\r\nin the manner I have indicated, is it not reasonable to suppose that the\r\ndelay which has hitherto been one of the greatest curses of your Indian\r\nGovernment would be almost altogether avoided? Instead of a Governor-\r\nGeneral living in Calcutta, or at Simla, never travelling over the whole\r\nof the country, and knowing very little about it, and that little only\r\nthrough other official eyes, is it not reasonable to suppose that the\r\naction of the Government would be more direct in all its duties and in\r\nevery department of its service than has been the case under the system\r\nwhich has existed until now? Your administration of the law, marked by\r\nso much disgrace, could never have lasted so long as it has done if the\r\nGovernors of your Presidencies had been independent Governors. So with\r\nregard to matters of police, education, public works, and everything\r\nthat can stimulate industry, and so with regard to your system of\r\ntaxation. You would have in every Presidency a constant rivalry for\r\ngood. The Governor of Madras, when his term of office expired, would be\r\ndelighted to show that the people of that Presidency were contented,\r\nthat the whole Presidency was advancing in civilization, that roads and\r\nall manner of useful public works were extending, that industry was\r\nbecoming more and more a habit of the people, and that the exports and\r\nimports were constantly increasing. The Governors of Bombay and the rest\r\nof the Presidencies would be animated by the same spirit, and so you\r\nwould have all over India, as I have said, a rivalry for good; you would\r\nhave placed a check on that malignant spirit of ambition which has\r\nworked so much evil--you would have no Governor so great that you could\r\nnot control him, none who might make war when he pleased; war and\r\nannexation would be greatly checked, if not entirely prevented; and I do\r\nin my conscience believe you would have laid the foundation for a better\r\nand more permanent form of government for India than has ever obtained\r\nsince it came under the rule of England.\r\n\r\nBut how long does England propose to govern India? Nobody answers that\r\nquestion, and nobody can answer it. Be it 50, or 100, or 500 years, does\r\nany man with the smallest glimmering of common sense believe that so\r\ngreat a country, with its twenty different nations and its twenty\r\nlanguages, can ever be bound up and consolidated into one compact and\r\nenduring empire? I believe such a thing to be utterly impossible. We\r\nmust fail in the attempt if ever we make it, and we are bound to look\r\ninto the future with reference to that point. The Presidency of Madras,\r\nfor instance, having its own Government, would in fifty years become one\r\ncompact State, and every part of the Presidency would look to the city\r\nof Madras as its capital, and to the Government of Madras as its ruling\r\npower. If that were to go on for a century or more, there would be five\r\nor six Presidencies of India built up into so many compact States; and\r\nif at any future period the sovereignty of England should be withdrawn,\r\nwe should leave so many Presidencies built up and firmly compacted\r\ntogether, each able to support its own independence and its own\r\nGovernment; and we should be able to say we had not left the country a\r\nprey to that anarchy and discord which I believe to be inevitable if we\r\ninsist on holding those vast territories with the idea of building them\r\nup into one great empire. But I am obliged to admit that mere machinery\r\nis not sufficient in this case, either with respect to my own scheme or\r\nto that of the noble lord (Lord Stanley). We want something else than\r\nmere clerks, stationery, despatches, and so forth. We want what I shall\r\ndesignate as a new feeling in England, and an entirely new policy in\r\nIndia. We must in future have India governed, not for a handful of\r\nEnglishmen, not for that Civil Service whose praises are so constantly\r\nsounded in this House. You may govern India, if you like, for the good\r\nof England, but the good of England must come through the channels of\r\nthe good of India. There are but two modes of gaining anything by our\r\nconnection with India. The one is by plundering the people of India, and\r\nthe other by trading with them. I prefer to do it by trading with them.\r\nBut in order that England may become rich by trading with India, India\r\nitself must become rich, and India can only become rich through the\r\nhonest administration of justice and through entire security of life and\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nNow, as to this new policy, I will tell the House what I think the Prime\r\nMinister should do. He ought, I think, always to choose for his\r\nPresident of the Board of Control or his Secretary of State for India, a\r\nman who cannot be excelled by any other man in his Cabinet, or in his\r\nparty, for capacity, for honesty, for attention to his duties, and for\r\nknowledge adapted to the particular office to which he is appointed. If\r\nany Prime Minister appoint an inefficient man to such an office, he will\r\nbe a traitor to the Throne of England. That officer, appointed for the\r\nqualities I have just indicated, should, with equal scrupulousness and\r\nconscientiousness, make the appointments, whether of the Governor-\r\nGeneral, or (should that office be abolished) of the Governors of the\r\nPresidencies of India. Those appointments should not be rewards for old\r\nmen simply because such men have done good service when in their prime,\r\nnor should they be rewards for mere party service, but they should be\r\nappointments given under a feeling that interests of the very highest\r\nmoment, connected with this country, depend on those great offices in\r\nIndia being properly filled. The same principles should run throughout\r\nthe whole system of government; for, unless there be a very high degree\r\nof virtue in all these appointments, and unless our great object be to\r\ngovern India well and to exalt the name of England in the eyes of the\r\nwhole Native population, all that we have recourse to in the way of\r\nmachinery will be of very little use indeed.\r\n\r\nI admit that this is a great work; I admit, also, that the further I go\r\ninto the consideration of this question, the more I feel that it is too\r\nlarge for me to grapple with, and that every step we take in it should\r\nbe taken as if we were men walking in the dark. We have, however,\r\ncertain great principles to guide us, and by their light we may make\r\nsteps in advance, if not fast, at any rate sure. But we start from an\r\nunfortunate position. We start from a platform of conquest by force of\r\narms extending over a hundred years. There is nothing in the world worse\r\nthan the sort of foundation from which we start. The greatest genius who\r\nhas shed lustre on the literature of this country has said, 'There is no\r\nsure foundation set on blood;' and it may be our unhappy fate, in regard\r\nto India, to demonstrate the truth of that saying. We are always\r\nsubjugators, and we must be viewed with hatred and suspicion. I say we\r\nmust look at the thing as it is, if we are to see our exact position,\r\nwhat our duty is, and what chance there is of our retaining India and of\r\ngoverning it for the advantage of its people. Our difficulties have been\r\nenormously increased by the revolt. The people of India have only seen\r\nEngland in its worst form in that country. They have seen it in its\r\nmilitary power, its exclusive Civil Service, and in the supremacy of a\r\nhandful of foreigners. When Natives of India come to this country, they\r\nare delighted with England and with Englishmen. They find themselves\r\ntreated with a kindness, a consideration, a respect, to which they were\r\nwholly strangers in their own country; and they cannot understand how it\r\nis that men who are so just, so attentive to them here, sometimes,\r\nindeed too often, appear to them in a different character in India. I\r\nremember that the Hon. Frederic Shaw, who wrote some thirty years since,\r\nstated, in his able and instructive book, that even in his time the\r\nconduct of the English in India towards the Natives was less agreeable,\r\nless kindly, less just than it had been in former years; and in 1853,\r\nbefore the Committee presided over by the hon. Member for Huntingdon\r\n(Mr. T. Baring), evidence was given that the feeling between the rulers\r\nand the ruled in India was becoming every year less like what could be\r\ndesired. It was only the other day there appeared in a letter of _The\r\nTimes_' correspondent an anecdote which illustrates what I am saying,\r\nand which I feel it necessary to read to the House. Mr. Russell, of\r\n_The Times_, says:--\r\n\r\n  'I went off to breakfast in a small mosque, which has been turned\r\n  into a _salle à manger_ by some officers stationed here, and\r\n  I confess I should have eaten with more satisfaction had I not\r\n  seen, as I entered the enclosure of the mosque, a native badly\r\n  wounded on a charpoy, by which was sitting a woman in deep\r\n  affliction. The explanation given of this scene was, that \"----\r\n  [the name of the Englishman was left blank] had been licking two\r\n  of his bearers (or servants), and had nearly murdered them.\" This\r\n  was one of the servants, and, without knowing or caring to know\r\n  the causes of such chastisement, I cannot but express my disgust\r\n  at the severity--to call it by no harsher name--of some of our\r\n  fellow-countrymen towards their domestics.'\r\n\r\nThe reading of that paragraph gave me extreme pain. People may fancy\r\nthat this does not matter much; but I say it matters very much. Under\r\nany system of government you will have Englishmen scattered all over\r\nIndia, and conduct like that I have just described, in any district,\r\nmust create ill feeling towards England, to your rule, to your\r\nsupremacy; and when that feeling has become sufficiently extensive, any\r\nlittle accident may give fire to the train, and you may have calamities\r\nmore or less serious, such as we have had during the last twelve months.\r\nYou must change all this if you mean to keep India. I do not now make\r\nany comment upon the mode in which this country has been put into\r\npossession of India. I accept that possession as a fact. There we are;\r\nwe do not know how to leave it, and therefore let us see if we know how\r\nto govern it. It is a problem such as, perhaps, no other nation has had\r\nto solve. Let us see whether there is enough of intelligence and virtue\r\nin England to solve the difficulty. In the first place, then, I say, let\r\nus abandon all that system of calumny against the Natives of India which\r\nhas lately prevailed. Had that people not been docile, the most\r\ngovernable race in the world, how could you have maintained your power\r\nfor 100 years? Are they not industrious, are they not intelligent, are\r\nthey not--upon the evidence of the most distinguished men the Indian\r\nService ever produced--endowed with many qualities which make them\r\nrespected by all Englishmen who mix with them? I have heard that from\r\nmany men of the widest experience, and have read the same in the works\r\nof some of the best writers upon India. Then let us not have these\r\nconstant calumnies against such a people. Even now there are men who go\r\nabout the country speaking as if such things had never been\r\ncontradicted, and talking of mutilations and atrocities committed in\r\nIndia. The less we say about atrocities the better. Great political\r\ntumults are, I fear, never brought about or carried on without grievous\r\nacts on both sides deeply to be regretted. At least, we are in the\r\nposition of invaders and conquerors--they are in the position of the\r\ninvaded and the conquered. Whether I were a native of India, or of\r\nEngland, or of any other country, I would not the less assert the great\r\ndistinction between their position and ours in that country, and I would\r\nnot permit any man in my presence, without rebuke, to indulge in the\r\ncalumnies and expressions of contempt which I have recently heard poured\r\nforth without measure upon the whole population of India.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point to which I wish to address myself before I sit\r\ndown, and in touching upon it I address myself especially to the noble\r\nLord (Lord Stanley) and his colleagues in the Government. If I had the\r\nresponsibility of administering the affairs of India, there are certain\r\nthings I would do. I would, immediately after this Bill passes, issue a\r\nProclamation in India which should reach every subject of the British\r\nCrown in that country, and be heard of in the territories of every\r\nIndian Prince or Rajah. I would offer a general amnesty. It is all very\r\nwell to talk of issuing an amnesty to all who have done nothing; but who\r\nis there that has done nothing in such a state of affairs as has\r\nprevailed during the past twelve months? If you pursue your vengeance\r\nuntil you have rooted out and destroyed every one of those soldiers who\r\nhave revolted, when will your labour cease? If you are to punish every\r\nnon-military Native of India who has given a piece of bread or a cup of\r\nwater to a revolted trooper, how many Natives will escape your\r\npunishment and your vengeance? I would have a general amnesty, which\r\nshould be put forth as the first great act done directly by the Queen of\r\nEngland in the exercise of Sovereign power over the territories of\r\nIndia. In this Proclamation 1 would promise to the Natives of India a\r\nsecurity for their property as complete as we have here at home; and I\r\nwould put an end to all those mischievous and irritating inquiries which\r\nhave been going on for years in many parts of India as to the title to\r\nlanded estates, by which you tell the people of that country that unless\r\neach man can show an unimpeachable title to his property for ninety\r\nyears you will dispossess him. What would be the state of things here if\r\nsuch a regulation were adopted?\r\n\r\nI would also proclaim to the people of India that we would hold sacred\r\nthat right of adoption which has prevailed for centuries in that\r\ncountry. It was only the other day that I had laid before me the case of\r\na Native Prince who has been most faithful to England during these\r\nlatter trials. When he came to the throne at ten years of age he was\r\nmade to sign a document, by which he agreed that if he had no children\r\nhis territories should be at the disposal of the British Government, or\r\nwhat was called the paramount power. He has been married; he has had one\r\nson and two or three daughters; but within the last few weeks his only\r\nson has died. There is grief in the palace, and there is consternation\r\namong the people, for the fact of this agreement entered into by the boy\r\nof ten years old is well known to all the inhabitants of the country.\r\nRepresentations have already been made to this country in the hope that\r\nthe Government will cancel that agreement, and allow the people of that\r\nState to know that the right of adoption would not be taken from their\r\nPrince in case he should have no other son. Let the Government do that,\r\nand there is not a corner of India into which that intelligence would\r\nnot penetrate with the rapidity of lightning. And would not that calm\r\nthe anxieties of many of those independent Princes and Rajahs who are\r\nonly afraid that when these troubles are over, the English Government\r\nwill recommence that system of annexation out of which I believe all\r\nthese troubles have arisen?\r\n\r\nI would tell them also in that Proclamation, that while the people of\r\nEngland hold that their own, the Christian religion, is true and the\r\nbest for mankind, yet that it is consistent with that religion that they\r\nwho profess it should hold inviolable the rights of conscience and the\r\nrights of religion in others. I would show, that whatever violent, over-\r\nzealous, and fanatical men may have said in this country, the Parliament\r\nof England, the Ministers of the Queen, and the Queen herself are\r\nresolved that upon this point no kind of wrong should be done to the\r\nmillions who profess the religions held to be true in India. I would do\r\nanother thing. I would establish a Court of Appeal, the Judges of which\r\nshould be Judges of the highest character in India, for the settlement\r\nof those many disputes which have arisen between the Government of India\r\nand its subjects, some Native and some European. I would not suffer\r\nthese questions to come upon the floor of this House. I would not forbid\r\nthem by statute, but I would establish a Court which should render it\r\nunnecessary for any man in India to cross the ocean to seek for that\r\njustice which he would then be able to get in his own country without\r\ncorruption or secret bargain. Then I would carry out the proposition\r\nwhich the noble Lord has made to-night, and which the right hon.\r\nGentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer made when he introduced his\r\nBill, that a Commission should be issued to inquire into the question of\r\nfinance. I would have other commissions, one for each Presidency, and I\r\nwould tell the people of India that there should be a searching inquiry\r\ninto their grievances, and that it was the interest and the will of the\r\nQueen of England that those grievances should be redressed.\r\n\r\nNow, perhaps I may be told that I am proposing strange things, quite out\r\nof the ordinary routine of government. I admit it. We are in a position\r\nthat necessitates something out of the ordinary routine. There are\r\npositions and times in the history of every country, as in the lives of\r\nindividuals, when courage and action are absolute salvation; and now the\r\nCrown of England, acting by the advice of the responsible Ministers,\r\nmust, in my opinion, have recourse to a great and unusual measure in\r\norder to allay the anxieties which prevail throughout the whole of\r\nIndia. The people of India do not like us, but they scarcely know where\r\nto turn if we left them. They are sheep literally without a shepherd.\r\nThey are people whom you have subdued, and who have the highest and\r\nstrongest claims upon you--claims which you cannot forget--claims which,\r\nif you do not act upon, you may rely upon it that, if there be a\r\njudgment for nations--as I believe there is--as for individuals, our\r\nchildren in no distant generation must pay the penalty which we have\r\npurchased by neglecting our duty to the populations of India.\r\n\r\nI have now stated my views and opinions on this question, not at all in\r\na manner, I feel, equal to the question itself. I have felt the\r\ndifficulty in thinking of it; I feel the difficulty in speaking of it--\r\nfor there is far more in it and about it than any man, however much he\r\nmay be accustomed to think upon political questions, and to discuss\r\nthem, can comprise at all within the compass of a speech of ordinary\r\nlength. I have described the measures which I would at once adopt for\r\nthe purpose of soothing the agitation which now disturbs and menaces\r\nevery part of India, and of inviting the submission of those who are now\r\nin arms against you. Now I believe--I speak in the most perfect honesty--\r\nI believe that the announcement of these measures would avail more in\r\nrestoring tranquillity than the presence of an additional army, and I\r\nbelieve that their full and honest adoption would enable you to retain\r\nyour power in India. I have sketched the form of government which I\r\nwould establish in India and at home, with the view of securing perfect\r\nresponsibility and an enlightened administration. I admit that these\r\nthings can only be obtained in degree, but I am convinced that a\r\nGovernment such as that which I have sketched would be free from most of\r\nthe errors and the vices that have marked and marred your past career in\r\nIndia. I have given much study to this great and solemn question. I\r\nentreat the House to study it not only now, during the passing of this\r\nBill, but after the Session is over, and till we meet again next year,\r\nwhen in all probability there must be further legislation upon this\r\ngreat subject; for I believe that upon this question depends very much,\r\nfor good or for evil, the future of this country of which we are\r\ncitizens, and which we all regard and love so much. You have had enough\r\nof military reputation on Eastern fields; you have gathered large\r\nharvests of that commodity, be it valuable or be it worthless. I invite\r\nyou to something better, and higher, and holier than that; I invite you\r\nto a glory not 'fanned by conquest's crimson wing,' but based upon the\r\nsolid and lasting benefits which I believe the Parliament of England\r\ncan, if it will, confer upon the countless populations of India.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, MAY 20, 1858.\r\n\r\n_From Hansard_.\r\n\r\n[A despatch of Lord Ellenborough, the President of the Board of Control,\r\nto Lord Canning, the Governor-General of India, had been laid before the\r\ntwo Houses. This document severely censured the Governor-General's\r\npolicy in dealing with the talookdars of Oude. Immediate advantage was\r\ntaken of this document by the Opposition, and on the 10th of May Mr.\r\nCardwell gave notice in the Commons of a motion condemnatory of Lord\r\nEllenborough's despatch. Lord Ellenborough retired from the Government.\r\nOn May 14, however, Mr. Cardwell brought forward his motion in the House\r\nof Commons, but, after a lengthened debate, consented to withdraw it, at\r\nthe earnest entreaty of many from his own side of the House.]\r\n\r\nI am afraid I shall hardly be able to take part in this discussion in a\r\nmanner becoming the magnitude of the question before us, and in any\r\ndegree in accordance with the long anxiety which I have felt in regard\r\nto Indian affairs, but I happen to have been unfortunately and\r\naccidentally a good deal mixed up with these matters, and my name has\r\nfrequently been mentioned in the course of debate, not only in this but\r\nin the other House of Parliament, and I am unwilling, therefore, to vote\r\nwithout expressing my opinion upon the matter under discussion. First, I\r\nmay be allowed to explain that I think almost everything that has been\r\nsaid and imagined with regard to the part that I have had in bringing on\r\nthis discussion has been altogether erroneous, and has no foundation\r\nwhatever. There was no arrangement between the hon. Gentleman the\r\nSecretary of the Board of Control and myself with regard to the question\r\nthat I thought it my duty to put to him on the subject of Lord Canning's\r\nProclamation. I had spoken two or three weeks before the date of that\r\nquestion to the hon. Gentleman, because I had been informed by a\r\nrespected friend of mine, Mr. Dickinson, the hon. secretary of the India\r\nReform Society, who has very great information on Indian affairs, that\r\nhe had received communications to the effect that some Proclamation of\r\nthis character was in preparation and was about to be issued. I spoke to\r\nthe hon. Member with regard to that report; and he told me that he had\r\nreceived no communication which enabled him to give me any information\r\non the subject. I then intimated to him that in case there was anything\r\nof the kind I should certainly put a question to the Government\r\nrespecting it. This was three weeks before the date of my question.\r\nWell, I read the Proclamation in _The Times_ newspaper, the same\r\nday that every one else read it; and I came down to the House, not\r\nhaving seen the hon. Gentleman in the meantime. I met my hon. friend the\r\nMember for Stockport (Mr. J. B. Smith) in Westminster Hall, and he told\r\nme that having read the despatch, and knowing my intention with regard\r\nto it, he, having met the hon. Gentleman (Mr. Baillie) that evening,\r\nsaid to him he had no doubt that when I came down to the House I should\r\nput a question respecting it. When I came down I put a question and\r\nreceived an answer; both question and answer are before the House and\r\nthe country. But I confess I did not anticipate that we should lose a\r\nweek from the discussion of the Indian Resolutions on account of the\r\nquestion which I then asked the hon. Gentleman the Secretary to the\r\nBoard of Control.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, with respect to the question before the House, I should have\r\nbeen content to let it end when the hon. and learned Gentleman the\r\nSolicitor-General sat down. I think, Sir, the House might have come to a\r\nvote when the Solicitor-General finished his speech. I could not but\r\ncompare that speech with the speech of the right hon. Gentleman who\r\nmoved the Resolution now before the House. I thought the right hon.\r\nGentleman raked together a great many small things to make up a great\r\ncase. It appeared to me that he spoke as if his manner indicated that he\r\nwas not perfectly satisfied with the course he was pursuing. I think he\r\nfailed to stimulate himself with the idea that he was performing a great\r\npublic duty; for if he had been impressed with that idea I think his\r\nsubject would have enabled him to deliver a more lively and impressive\r\nspeech than that which he has made. But, Sir, I believe that every one\r\nwill admit that the speech of the Solicitor-General was characterised by\r\nthe closest logic and the most complete and exhaustive argument. There\r\nis scarcely a Gentleman with whom I have spoken with regard to that\r\nspeech who does not admit that the hon. and learned Gentleman has seemed\r\nto have taken up the whole question, and to have given a complete answer\r\nto all serious charges brought against the Government.\r\n\r\nThis Motion is an important one in two aspects. First of all as respects\r\nthe interests of parties at home--which some people, probably, think the\r\nmore important of the interests concerned; and, secondly, as respects\r\nthe effect which will be produced in India when this discussion, with\r\nthe vote at which we arrive, reaches that country and is read there. The\r\nprinces, the rajahs, and intelligent landholders, whether under the\r\nEnglish Government or independent, will know very little about what we\r\nunderstand by party; and any cabal or political conspiracy here will\r\nhave no influence on them. They know little of the persons who conduct\r\nand take a part in the debate in this House; and the 'loud cheers' which\r\nthey will read of in our discussions Will be almost nothing to them. The\r\nquestion to them will be, What is the opinion of the Parliament of\r\nEngland as to the policy announced to India in the Proclamation?\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I complain of the right hon. Gentleman, and I think the House\r\nhas reason to complain, that in his Resolution he endeavours to evade\r\nthe real point of discussion. The noble Lord who has just sat down\r\n(Viscount Goderich) says he will not meet this matter in any such\r\nindirect manner as that proposed by the Amendment of the hon. Member for\r\nSwansea (Mr. Dillwyn); but what can be less direct than the issue\r\noffered by the Resolution of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for\r\nOxford? This is proved by the fact that, throughout the course of this\r\ndiscussion, every serious argument and every serious expression has had\r\nreference to the character of the Proclamation, and not to those little\r\nmatters which are mixed up in this Resolution. Nobody, I believe,\r\ndefends the Proclamation in the light in which it is viewed by the\r\nGovernment, and censured by the Government. All that has been done is an\r\nendeavour to show that it is not rightly understood by those who censure\r\nit as announcing a policy of confiscation. In fact, in endeavouring to\r\ndefend it, hon. Members insist that it does not mean something which it\r\nsays it does mean, and which if any of us understand the English\r\nlanguage it assuredly does mean. The right hon. Gentleman asks us to do\r\nthat which I think is an absolute impossibility. He wants us to condemn\r\nthe censure, and wishes at the same time--and I give him credit for\r\nthis--that we should pronounce no approval of the thing censured. I do\r\nnot think the right hon. Gentleman, though unfortunately he has been led\r\ninto this movement, wishes the House to pronounce an opinion in favour\r\nof confiscation. I do not believe that any Member of this House asks us\r\nto come to a conclusion in such a way as that our decision shall be an\r\napproval of that which the Government has condemned in the despatch. But\r\nif we affirm the Resolution of the right hon. Gentleman, how is it\r\npossible for the people of India to understand our decision in any other\r\nsense than as an approval of the policy of Lord Canning's Proclamation?\r\nWith regard to the publication of the Government despatch, it is not a\r\nlittle remarkable how men turn round and object to what they formerly\r\nwere so loud in demanding. On this side of the House it has been the\r\ncommonest thing to hear hon. Gentlemen say that all this secrecy on the\r\npart of the Foreign Office and the Board of Control is a cause of the\r\ngreatest mischief. Assume for a moment that the publication of this\r\ndespatch was injudicious--after all, it was no high crime and\r\nmisdemeanour. We on this side of the House, and hon. Gentlemen below the\r\ngangway, ought to look with kindness on this failing, which, if a\r\nfailing, leans to virtue's side. Then, Sir, with regard to the language\r\nof the despatch, I do not know of any Government or Minister who would\r\nnot be open to censure if we chose to take up every word in a despatch.\r\nA man of firmer texture, of stronger impulse, and more indignant\r\nfeelings will, on certain occasions, write in stronger terms than other\r\nmen--and I confess I like those men best who write and speak so that you\r\ncan really understand them. Now I say that the proposition before the\r\nHouse is a disingenuous one. It attempts to lead the House into a very\r\nunfortunate dilemma. I think that no judicial mind--seeing that the\r\nresult of a decision in favour of this Resolution will be the\r\nestablishment of the policy of the Proclamation--will fail to be\r\nconvinced that we ought not to arrive at such a decision without great\r\nhesitation, and that we cannot do so without producing a very injurious\r\neffect on the minds of the people of India.\r\n\r\nWe now come to what all parties admit to be the real question--the\r\nProclamation and the policy of confiscation announced in it. There are\r\ncertain matters which I understand all sides of the House to be agreed\r\non. They agree with the Government and the East India Company that the\r\npeople of Oude are enemies but that they are not rebels [Cries of 'Yes,\r\nyes!'--'No, no!'] I thought the supporters of the Resolution of the\r\nright lion. Gentleman the Member for Oxford told us that if the\r\nGovernment had written a judicious despatch like that of the East India\r\nCompany, they would have applauded and not censured it. Well, the East\r\nIndia Directors--and they are likely to know, for they were connected\r\nwith the commission of the Act that brought this disturbance in Oude\r\nupon us--say that the people of Oude are not rebels; that they are not\r\nto be treated as rebels; but as enemies. If so, the Government have a\r\nright to treat them according to those rules which are observed by\r\nnations which are at war with each other. Will the House accept that\r\nproposition? ['No, no!'--'Yes, yes!'] Well, if hon. Gentlemen on this\r\nside will not accept it, I hope the noble Lord the Member for the West\r\nRiding (Viscount Goderich) will not include them amongst those who are\r\nin favour of clemency. I am quite sure the people of England will accept\r\nthat definition--that civilised Europe will accept it; and that history--\r\nhistory which will record our proceedings this night, and our vote on\r\nthis Resolution--will accept it. Sir, I do not see how any one claiming\r\nto be an Englishman or a Christian can by any possibility escape from\r\ncondemning the policy of this Proclamation.\r\n\r\nI now come--and on that point I will be as brief as possible--to the\r\nquestion. What is the meaning of confiscating the proprietary rights in\r\nthe soil? We have heard from a noble Lord in 'another place' and it has\r\nbeen stated in the course of the debate here, that this sentence of\r\nconfiscation refers only to certain unpleasant persons who are called\r\ntalookdars, who are barons and robber chiefs and oppressors of the\r\npeople. This is by no means the first time that, after a great wrong has\r\nbeen committed, the wrongdoer has attempted to injure by calumny those\r\nupon whom the wrong has been inflicted. Lord Shaftesbury, who is a sort\r\nof leader in this great war, has told the world that this Proclamation\r\nrefers only to 600 persons in the kingdom of Oude.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Onde has about five millions of people, or one-sixth of\r\nthe population of the United Kingdom. Applied to the United Kingdom in\r\nthe same rate of the population it would apply to 3,600 persons. Now, in\r\nboth Houses of Parliament there are probably 700 landed proprietors. It\r\nwould, therefore, be an edict of confiscation to the landed proprietors\r\nof the United Kingdom equal to five times all the landed proprietors in\r\nboth Houses of Parliament. An hon. Gentleman says I am all wrong in my\r\nfigures. I shall be glad to hear his figures afterwards. But that is not\r\nthe fact; but if it were the fact, it would amount not to a political,\r\nbut to an entire social revolution in this country. And surely, when you\r\nlive in a country where you have, as in Scotland, a great province under\r\none Member of the House of Lords, and seventy or eighty miles of\r\nterritory under another, and where you have Dukes of Bedford and Dukes\r\nof Devonshire, as in England--surely, I say, we ought to be a little\r\ncareful, at any rate, that we do not overturn, without just cause, the\r\nproprietary rights of the great talookdars and landowners in India. It\r\nis a known fact, which anybody may ascertain by referring to books which\r\nhave been written, and to witnesses who cannot be mistaken, that this\r\nedict would apply to more than 40,000 landowners in the kingdom of Oude.\r\nAnd what is it that is meant by these proprietary rights? We must see\r\nwhat is the general course of the policy of our government in India. If\r\nyou sweep away all proprietary rights in the kingdom of Oude you will\r\nhave this result--that there will be nobody connected with the land but\r\nthe Government of India and the humble cultivator who tills the soil.\r\nAnd you will have this further result, that the whole produce of the\r\nland of Oude and of the industry of its people will be divided into two\r\nmost unequal portions; the larger share will go to the Government in the\r\nshape of tax, and the smaller share, which will be a handful of rice per\r\nday, will go to the cultivator of the soil. Now, this is the Indian\r\nsystem. It is the grand theory of the civilians, under whose advice, I\r\nvery much fear, Lord Canning has unfortunately acted; and you will find\r\nin many parts of India, especially in the Presidency of Madras, that the\r\npopulation consists entirely of the class of cultivators, and that the\r\nGovernment stands over them with a screw which is perpetually turned,\r\nleaving the handful of rice per day to the ryot or the cultivator, and\r\npouring all the rest of the produce of the soil into the Exchequer of\r\nthe East India Company. Now, I believe that this Proclamation sanctions\r\nthis policy; and I believe further that the Resolution which the right\r\nhon. Gentleman asks the House to adopt, sanctions this Proclamation;\r\nthat it will be so read in India, and that whatever may be the\r\ninfluence, unfortunate as I believe it will be, of the Proclamation\r\nitself, when it is known throughout India that this--the highest court\r\nof appeal--has pronounced in favour of Lord Canning's policy, it will be\r\none of the most unfortunate declarations that ever went forth from the\r\nParliament of this country to the people of that empire.\r\n\r\nLet me then for one minute--and it shall be but for one minute--ask the\r\nattention of the House to our pecuniary dealings with Oude. A friend of\r\nmine has extracted from a book on this subject two or three facts which\r\nI should like to state to the House, as we are now considering the\r\npolicy of England towards that afflicted country. It is stated that,\r\nunder the government of Warren Hastings, to the arrival of Lord\r\nCornwallis in 1786, the East India Company obtained from the kingdom of\r\nOude, and therefore from the Exchequer of the people of Oude, the sum of\r\n9,252,000_l_.; under Lord Cornwallis, 4,290,000_l_.; under\r\nLord Teignmouth, 1,280,000_l_.; under Lord Wellesley,\r\n10,358,000_l_. This includes, I ought to observe, the Doab, taken\r\nin 1801 in lieu of subsidy, the annual revenue of that district being\r\n1,352,000_l_. Coming down to the year 1814, there was a loan of a\r\nmillion; in 1815 a loan of a million; in 1825 a loan of a million; in\r\n1826 a loan of a million; in 1829 a loan of 625,000_l_.; and in\r\n1838 a loan of 1,700,000_l_. Some of these sums, the House will\r\nobserve, are loans, and in one case the loan was repaid by a portion of\r\nterritory which the Company, in a very few years, under an excuse which\r\nI should not like to justify, re-annexed to themselves, and therefore\r\nthe debt was virtually never repaid. The whole of these sums comes to\r\n31,500,000_l_.; in addition to which Oude has paid vast sums in\r\nsalaries, pensions, and emoluments of every kind to servants of the\r\nCompany engaged in the service of the Government of Oude.\r\n\r\nI am not going further into detail with regard to that matter; but I say\r\nthat the history of our connection with the country, whose interests we\r\nare now discussing, is of a nature that ought to make us pause before we\r\nconsent to any measure that shall fill up the cup of injury which we\r\nhave offered to the lips of that people. After this, two years ago, we\r\ndeposed the Sovereign of Oude. Everything that he had was seized--much\r\nof it was sold. Indignities were offered to his family. Their ruin was\r\naccomplished, though they were the governors of that kingdom. Some hon.\r\nGentleman, speaking on this side of the House, has tried to persuade the\r\nHouse that this confiscation policy only intends that we should receive\r\nthe taxes of Oude. But that is altogether a delusion. That is a\r\nstatement so absurd that I am astonished that any one, even of those who\r\nsupport the Resolution, should offer it to the House. In 1856, when you\r\ndethroned the King of Oude, you stepped into his place, and became the\r\nrecipients of all the legitimate national taxes of the kingdom of Oude;\r\nand now, having seized the 500,000_l_. a year, the revenue of that\r\ncountry, after a solemn treaty which contained a clause that if there\r\nwere a surplus of revenue it should be paid to the credit of the kingdom\r\nof Oude; after having applied that surplus, contrary to that clause of\r\nthe treaty, to the general purposes of India; you now step in and you\r\ndescend below the King, to every talookdar, to every landowner, large or\r\nsmall, to every man who has proprietary rights in the soil, to every\r\nman, the smallest and humblest capitalist who cultivates the soil--to\r\nevery one of these you say in language that cannot be mistaken--'Come\r\ndown from the independence and dignity you have held. As we have done in\r\nother provinces of India we shall do here. Two-thirds of you have not\r\nbeen mixed up in this war; but in this general confiscation the innocent\r\nmust suffer with the guilty, for such is the misfortune of war, and such\r\nis the penalty which we shall inflict upon you.' Sir, if this\r\nProclamation be not a Proclamation of unheard-of severity, how comes it\r\nthat so many persons have protested against it? Does any man believe\r\nthat the noble Lord the Member for the West Riding (Viscount Goderich)\r\nunderstands this Proclamation better than the high military authorities\r\nwho have so long known India? Does he suppose that the House of Commons\r\nwill take his authority upon a matter of this kind in preference to the\r\nauthority of the whole united press of India? ['Oh! oh!'] Well, I dare\r\nsay that hon. Members who cry 'Oh!' have not read the newspapers of\r\nIndia upon the subject. Some of them uphold it because they say that at\r\none fell swoop it has done that which it took us twenty years to do in\r\nother districts of India, and destroys every man who could influence the\r\npeople against the British Government. Others say that it is a\r\nProclamation of such a character that it must cause 'war to the knife'\r\nagainst the English, and that the Governor-General who issued such a\r\nProclamation should have been prepared with a new army at his back that\r\nhe might have power to enforce it.\r\n\r\nThe learned Gentleman the Attorney-General for Ireland referred in his\r\nspeech the other night to what had been said by the hon. and learned\r\nMember for Devonport (Sir E. Perry) on the occasion of a question that I\r\nhad put some two or three weeks ago. Now I call the House to witness\r\nwhether when I put the question which brought out this despatch, and\r\nwhen the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer rose in\r\nhis place and gave the answer that with respect to the policy of\r\nconfiscation--for that is the only thing there is any dispute about in\r\nthe Proclamation--the Government disavowed it in every sense--I call the\r\nHouse to witness whether every Gentleman present in this part of the\r\nHouse did not cheer that sentiment. Of course, every man cheered it.\r\nThey would not have been men; they would not have been Englishmen; they\r\nwould not have been legislators; they would have been men who had never\r\nheard of what was just and right, if every instinct within them, at the\r\ninstant they heard the declaration of the Government, did not compel\r\nthem to an enthusiastic assent. And it was only when the fatal influence\r\nof party, and the arts which party knows how to employ, were put in\r\nmotion, that hon. Gentlemen began to discover that there was something\r\nserious and something dangerous in this memorable despatch. Now, I would\r\nask the House this question--are we prepared to sanction the policy of\r\nthat despatch?\r\n\r\nI am very sorry that I have not done what only occurred to me after this\r\ndebate commenced, and after the Amendment was proposed, or I should have\r\nproposed another Amendment to the House that went expressly upon that\r\npoint, because--and I speak it without the smallest reference to the\r\ninfluence which it may have on any party in this House--I think it of\r\nthe very highest consequence that, whatever decision we come to, it\r\nshould be liable to no misinterpretation when it arrives in India. Then,\r\nSir, we have been treated to a good deal of eloquence upon the manner of\r\nthe despatch; and with regard to that I must say a word or two. The\r\nnoble Lord the Member for London, who sits below me, has, I think,\r\nfallen into the error of most of the speakers in favour of the\r\nResolution; that is, of treating some of the outside circumstances of\r\nthe case as if they were the case itself. I do not think, however, that\r\nhe stated there was a word in the despatch which was not true, although\r\nhe did express what I thought was rather an immoral sentiment for so\r\neminent a statesman. The noble Lord told us that after a crime had been\r\ncommitted, men in office were never to let it be known or suspected that\r\nthey thought it was a crime. [Lord John Russell: 'The hon. Gentleman is\r\nmistaken; I never said anything of the kind.'] I did not hear it myself,\r\nbut I read it, and many of my friends came to the same conclusion. ['Oh!\r\noh!'] Well, I understand, then, that he did not say it; but what he did\r\nsay was, that there was a great deal of sarcasm and invective in the\r\ndespatch, and he read a passage to show that such was the case. But the\r\nfact is that a great deal depends upon the reading. I could take a\r\ndespatch of the noble Lord himself and read it in a manner that would\r\nperfectly astonish him. He said, if I am not mistaken, that if the House\r\nwere to approve of that despatch as a proper despatch, then Lord Canning\r\nwas not fit to occupy the meanest political or official situation.\r\nIndian despatches have, to my mind, never been very gentle. I recollect\r\nhaving read in _Mill's History of British India_, and in other\r\nhistories also, despatches that have been sent from the President of the\r\nBoard of Control, the Secret Committee, and the Court of Directors, over\r\nand over again; and I have thought that they were written in a tone\r\nrather more authoritative and rather more dictatorial than I should have\r\nbeen disposed to write, or than I should have been pleased to receive.\r\nIt arose from this--that in old times the magnates sitting in\r\nLeadenhall-street were writing, not to Lord Canning and men of that\r\naltitude, but to merchants and agents whom they had sent out, who were\r\nentirely dependent upon them, and to whom they could say just what they\r\nliked; and for 100 years past, as far as I have seen, their despatches\r\nhave had a character for severity, and that which men call\r\n'dictatorial,' which I think might be very well dispensed with. But that\r\nis a matter which should certainly be taken into consideration, when a\r\nlarge portion of this House are disposed not only to censure Lord\r\nEllenborough, but to overturn the Government, because a despatch is not\r\nwritten precisely in those gentle terms which some hon. Gentlemen think\r\nto be right when inditing a letter to a Governor-General of India.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which I must notice, and that is the supposed\r\neffect of this despatch upon the feelings of Lord Canning. I am not so\r\nintimate with Lord Canning as many Members of this House, but I have had\r\nthe pleasure of his acquaintance, and have always believed that he was\r\none of the last men who would knowingly do anything that was inhuman or\r\nunjust, and that is my opinion now. I think he is to be commiserated, as\r\nany other man would have been who happened to be in India at such a time\r\nas this; and I think we are bound also to take a lenient view even of\r\nsuch errors as we may think he has committed. If I had gone to India, or\r\ninto any service under the State, I should expect that there would be a\r\ngeneral disposition to give me fair play in the exercise of my office,\r\nand that no strained construction to my injury would be put upon\r\nanything which I did. Well, that is the view which I entertain with\r\nregard to Lord Canning. I have never uttered a syllable against him in\r\npublic, although I think that some of his acts have been open to great\r\nobjection; and I am not about to say anything against him now. I would\r\nnot support a Resolution which was intended to damage Lord Canning; and\r\nI think the hon. Member for Swansea (Mr. Dillwyn) has not done wrong in\r\noffering to the House the Amendment he has placed before us. But it is\r\njust possible that Lord Canning is in the midst of circumstances which\r\nhave rendered it very difficult, perhaps impossible, for him to exercise\r\nhis own calm judgment on the great question which forms the subject of\r\nthis Proclamation, I see in that Proclamation not so much an emanation\r\nfrom the humane and just mind of Lord Canning, as the offspring of that\r\nmixture of red tape and ancient tradition which is the foundation of the\r\npolicy of the old civilian Council of Calcutta. But, Sir, if it were a\r\nquestion of hurting Lord Canning's feelings and denouncing this\r\nProclamation, I could have no hesitation as to the choice which I should\r\nmake. A man's private and personal feelings are not a matter of\r\nimportance for the House when compared with the vast and permanent\r\ninterests involved in the dangerous policy which we are now discussing.\r\nAnd I do not think the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Cardwell), the noble\r\nLord the Member for the West Riding (Viscount Goderich), and the noble\r\nLord the Member for London, have any right to throw themselves into\r\nsomething like a contortion of agony with regard to the manner of this\r\ndespatch; because, as was stated to the House the other night by the\r\nlearned Attorney-General for Ireland, they did not tell us much about\r\nthe feelings of another public servant, acting on behalf of the Crown at\r\na still greater distance from England, when last year they gave a vote\r\non the China question which pronounced a most emphatic condemnation on\r\nthe conduct of Sir John Bowring. Now, I like fair play. I would treat\r\nLord Canning as I would treat Sir John Bowring; and I would treat Sir\r\nJohn Bowring as I would treat Lord Canning. Do not let us have in the\r\nservice of the State low-caste men who may be trampled upon at pleasure,\r\nand high-caste men whom nobody dare criticise.\r\n\r\nI said, when I began, that this Resolution is important in reference to\r\nsomething else besides India; that it is important with reference to the\r\nposition of parties in this House. I would ask the attention of the\r\nHouse for a few moments to that branch of the subject. I am afraid--and\r\nI hope I am not slandering anybody in saying it--that there is quite as\r\nmuch zeal for what is called 'place' as there is for the good of India\r\nin the proposition brought before us. If that despatch had been\r\npublished three months ago, when we were all sitting on that side of the\r\nHouse, it is very probable that many Gentlemen who now speak against it\r\nwould have thought it a noble despatch, containing noble sentiments,\r\nexpressed in noble language. But now, Sir, there has been for the last\r\ntwo months a growing irritation observable, particularly in this part of\r\nthe House. There has been a feeling which no ingenuity has been able to\r\ndisguise--a fear that if the present Government should, by some means or\r\nother, remain in office over the Session, no small difficulty would be\r\nfound in displacing it--lest, like the tree, which, when first planted,\r\nmay be easily pulled up, it should by and bye strike its roots downwards\r\nand its branches outwards, and after a year or two no man would be able\r\nto get it out of the ground. Hon. Gentlemen opposite know that I differ\r\nvery widely from them on many public questions, and probably at some not\r\ndistant day they may find it out in some act of severe hostility; but I\r\nput it to the House, whether, out of doors, the reputation of the\r\npresent Government is not, in many respects, better than the last? Take,\r\nfor instance, the Gentlemen who come up from the country on various\r\ndeputations to the Ministers--the judgment of these deputations, without\r\nan exception, is in favour of the manner in which they have been\r\nreceived by the present Ministers, and of the way in which their\r\nsuggestions and requests have been treated. Now, this may be no great\r\nmatter, and I do not say that it is; but I make the observation for the\r\nbenefit of the Gentlemen who sit on these benches, because it is just\r\npossible that they may some time have to receive deputations again. Then\r\ntake their conduct in this House. 'Oh, yes.' hon. Gentlemen may say,\r\n'but they are a weak Government; they have not a majority, and they are\r\nobliged to be very civil.' But what I maintain is, that every Ministry\r\nought to be very civil, and what I am prepared to assert is--and I ask\r\nevery man on this side of the House if he does not agree with me, for I\r\nhave heard dozens of them say it out of the House--that when the late\r\nGovernment were in office civility was a thing unknown.\r\n\r\nTake another point--for it is worthy of consideration by Gentlemen on\r\nthis side of the House, and I ask hon. Gentlemen who sit below the\r\ngangway especially to consider it--look at the heritage of trouble with\r\nregard to our foreign policy which the existing Government found on\r\ntheir accession to office. Three months of what was going on upon the\r\nConspiracy Bill would have landed you on the very verge of a war, if not\r\nin a war, with France, and that danger has been avoided certainly by no\r\nconcession which is injurious to the honour of England. Take the\r\nquestion which has agitated the public mind with regard to Naples. I am\r\nnot going into any details; but so far as a Government could act, this\r\nGovernment appears to have acted with judgment. I think the noble Lord\r\nbelow me (Lord J. Russell) admitted that himself. I did not say that the\r\nnoble Lord said anything against them. On the contrary, I rejoice to\r\nhave him with me as a witness to what I am stating. With regard, then,\r\nto these questions, seeing the dilemma into which the foreign affairs of\r\nthe country were brought under the last Administration, I think it is\r\nbut fair, just, and generous that Members on this side of the House, at\r\nleast, should take no course which wears the colour of faction, for the\r\npurpose of throwing the present Government out of office. Whenever I\r\njoin in a vote to put Gentlemen opposite out of office, it shall be for\r\nsomething that the country will clearly understand--something that shall\r\noffer a chance of good to some portion of the British empire--something\r\nthat shall offer a chance of advancing distinctly the great principles\r\nfor which we--if we are a party at all on this side of the House--\r\nprofess to care.\r\n\r\nBut there is another reason. Not only is it feared that hon. Gentlemen\r\nopposite will get firm in their seats, but it is also feared that some\r\nhon. Gentlemen near me will get less firm in their alliance with the\r\nright hon. Gentlemen on this side. I have heard of mutinous meetings and\r\ndiscussions, and of language of the most unpardonable character uttered,\r\nas Gentlemen now say, in the heat of debate. But there was something\r\nmore going on, which was traced to a meeting of independent Members\r\nrecently held in Committee-room No. 11; and if a stop were not put to\r\nit, the powerful ranks on these benches might be broken up, which, if\r\nunited, it was believed, would storm the Treasury benches and replace\r\nthe late Government in office. I believe it was intended that a\r\ndesperate effort should be made to change the state of things here\r\nbefore Whitsuntide. That was a resolution which had been come to long\r\nbefore any one knew anything about Lord Ellenborough's despatch. And the\r\npresent seems to be a convenient opportunity, inasmuch as it has this in\r\nits favour, that it appears to be defending an absent servant of the\r\nCrown; that it appears to be teaching a lesson to the Government who\r\nhave acted injudiciously in publishing a despatch; altogether it has\r\nthat about it which makes it an excellent pretext on which hon.\r\nGentlemen may ride into office. Now, I do not speak to Whigs in office\r\nor to those Gentlemen who have been in office and expect to be in office\r\nagain; but I should like to say what I believe to be true to those\r\nGentlemen who call themselves independent Members, who come here with no\r\npersonal object to serve, not seeking place, patronage, or favour, but\r\nwith an honest desire, as far as they are able, to serve their country\r\nas Members of the House of Commons. If this Resolution be carried, it is\r\nsupposed that the old Government, or something very like it, will come\r\nback again. Now, there was great discontent with that old Government\r\nbefore it went out; yet no pledge whatever has been given that its\r\nconduct will be better or different; no new measures have been promised,\r\nno new policy has been avowed, no new men, that I have seen, have been\r\nheld forth to the public very distinctly as likely to take high office\r\nin the State. There have been some things which I should think Members\r\nof this House must have felt pain at witnessing. There are newspapers in\r\nthe interest of this ex-Treasury bench which have, in the most\r\nunblushing manner, published articles emanating from the pen of somebody\r\nwho knew exactly what was wanted to be done. In the case of a gentleman,\r\nfor example, who was engaged in Committee-room No. 11--a gentleman whom I\r\nneed not mention because the House knows all the circumstances of this\r\ncase, but a gentleman who took a most prominent part in the proceedings\r\nin that Committee-room--and no one is probably more indignant at what\r\nhas been done than himself--those newspapers have positively fixed upon\r\nand designated him for a certain office, if the present Government go\r\nout and another comes in; another gentleman who seconded a Resolution on\r\nthat occasion is also held up for an office; but they do not state\r\nexactly what his precise position is to be; and the glittering bauble of\r\nsome place in the incoming Government is hung up before many hon.\r\nGentlemen who sit around me. It is not said, 'It is for you' and 'It is\r\nfor you;' but it is hung up dangling before them all, and every man is\r\nexpected to covet that glittering bauble.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. These are not the only arts which are employed.\r\nMembers of this House sitting below the gangway, who have been here for\r\nyears--Gentlemen of the most independent character--receive flattering\r\nand beautifully engraved cards to great parties at splendid mansions;\r\nand not later than Friday last, of all times, those invitations were\r\nscattered, if not with a more liberal, no doubt with a much more\r\ndiscriminating hand than they ever were before. [An hon. Member:\r\n'Absurd!'] Of course it is very absurd; there is no doubt about that, and\r\nthat is precisely why I am explaining it to the House. Why, Sir, if\r\nthose cards of invitation contained a note with them, giving the exact\r\nhistory of what was really meant, it would say to hon. Gentlemen, 'Sir,\r\nwe have measured your head, and we have gauged your soul, and we know or\r\nbelieve'--for I believe they do not know--'we believe that your\r\nprinciples which you came into Parliament to support--your character in\r\nthe House--your self-respect will go for nothing if you have a miserable\r\ntemptation like this held up before you.' Sir, if we could see them\r\ntaking a course which is said to be taken by the celebrated horse-tamer,\r\nwho appeals, as I am told, to the nobler and more intelligent instincts\r\nof the animal which he tames, then I should not complain. But they\r\nappeal to instincts which every honourable mind repudiates, and to\r\naspirations which no hon. Gentleman on this side of the House can for a\r\nmoment admit.\r\n\r\nWell, then, if they succeed, what sort of a Government shall we have? I\r\nam as anxious for a Liberal Government as any man in this House, but I\r\ncannot believe that, in the present position of things on this side of\r\nthe House, a Liberal and solid Government can be formed. We are told,\r\nand the whole country has been in a state of expectation and wonder upon\r\nit, that two eminent statesmen have actually dined together; and I am\r\nvery glad to hear that men engaged in the strife of politics can dine\r\ntogether without personal hostility. I say nothing of the viands that\r\nwere eaten. I say nothing of the beverage that was in the 'loving cup'\r\nthat went round. One of our oldest and greatest poets has told us that--\r\n\r\n  'Nepenthe is a drink of soverayne grace.'\r\n\r\nHe says that it was devised by the gods to subdue contention, and\r\nsubject the passions; but that it was given only to the aged and the\r\nwise, who were prepared by it to take their places with ancient heroes\r\nin a higher sphere. But that could not have been the contents of the\r\n'loving cup' in this instance, for these aged statesmen are still\r\ndetermined to cling to this world, and to mix, as heretofore, with all\r\nthe vigour and the fire of youth in the turmoil and contention of public\r\nlife. But does the fact of this dinner point to reconciliation, and to a\r\nfirm and liberal administration? I believe that any such Government\r\nwould be the worst of all coalitions. I believe that it would be built\r\nupon insincerity, and I suspect it would be of no advantage to the\r\ncountry. Therefore I am not anxious to see such a Government attempted.\r\n\r\nI ask the House, then, are they prepared to overthrow the existing\r\nGovernment on the question which the right hon. Gentleman has brought\r\nbefore us--a question which he has put in such ambiguous terms? Are they\r\nwilling in overthrowing that Government to avow the policy of this\r\nProclamation for India? Are they willing to throw the country into all\r\nthe turmoil of a general election--a general election at a moment when\r\nthe people are but just slowly recovering from the effects of the most\r\ntremendous commercial panic that this country ever passed through? Are\r\nthey willing to delay all legislation for India till next year, and all\r\nlegislation on the subject of Parliamentary reform till the year after\r\nthat? Are they willing, above all, to take the responsibility which will\r\nattach to them if they avow the policy contained in this Proclamation?\r\n\r\nI confess, Sir, I am terrified for the future of India when I look at\r\nthe indiscriminate slaughter which is now going on there. I have seen a\r\nletter, written, I believe, by a missionary, lately inserted in a most\r\nrespectable weekly newspaper published in London, in which the writer\r\nestimates that 10,000 men have been put to death by hanging alone. I ask\r\nyou, whether you approve of having in India such expressions as these,\r\nwhich I have taken this day from a Calcutta newspaper, and which\r\nundoubtedly you will be held to approve if you do anything which can be\r\ncharged with a confirmation of the tenor of this Proclamation. Here is\r\nan extract from _The Englishman_, which, speaking of the men of the\r\ndisarmed regiments, who amount to some 20,000 or 30,000, or even 40,000\r\nmen, says:--\r\n\r\n  'There is no necessity to bring every Sepoy to a court-martial,\r\n  and convict him of mutinous intentions before putting him down as\r\n  guilty. We do not advocate extreme or harsh measures, nor are we\r\n  of those who would drench the land with blood; but we have no\r\n  hesitation in saying, that, were the Government to order the\r\n  execution of all these Sepoys, they would be legally and morally\r\n  justified in doing so. There would be no injustice done.'\r\n\r\nNo injustice would be done! I ask the House to consider that these men\r\nhave committed no offence; their military functions were suspended\r\nbecause it was thought they were likely to be tempted to commit an\r\noffence, and therefore their arms were taken from them; and now an\r\nEnglishman--one of your own countrymen--writing in a newspaper published\r\nin Calcutta, utters sentiments so atrocious as those which I have just\r\nread to the House. I believe the whole of India is now trembling under\r\nthe action of volcanic fires; and we shall be guilty of the greatest\r\nrecklessness, and I will say of great crime against the Monarchy of\r\nEngland, if we do anything by which we shall own this Proclamation. I am\r\nasked on this question to overturn Her Majesty's Government. The policy\r\nadopted by the Government on this subject is the policy that was cheered\r\nby hon. Members on this side when it was first announced. It is a policy\r\nof mercy and conciliation. False--may I not say?--or blundering leaders\r\nof this party would induce us, contrary to all our associations and all\r\nour principles, to support an opposite policy. I am willing to avow that\r\nI am in favour of justice and conciliation--of the law of justice and of\r\nkindness. Justice and mercy are the supreme attributes of the perfection\r\nwhich we call Deity, but all men everywhere comprehend them; there is no\r\nspeech nor language in which their voice is not heard, and they cannot\r\nbe vainly exercised with regard to the docile and intelligent millions\r\nof India. Yon have had the choice. You have tried the sword. It has\r\nbroken; it now rests broken in your grasp; and you stand humbled and\r\nrebuked. You stand humbled and rebuked before the eyes of civilized\r\nEurope. You may have another chance. You may, by possibility, have\r\nanother opportunity of governing India. If you have, I beseech you to\r\nmake the best use of it. Do not let us pursue such a policy as many men\r\nin India, and some in England, have advocated, but which hereafter you\r\nwill have to regret, which can end only, as I believe, in something\r\napproaching to the ruin of this country, and which must, if it be\r\npersisted in, involve our name and nation in everlasting disgrace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, AUGUST 1, 1859.\r\n_From Hansard._\r\n[On August 1 Sir Charles Wood made his financial statement on India to\r\nthe House of Commons. One of his proposals was that the Government\r\nshould be empowered to raise 5,000,000_l_. in the United Kingdom in\r\norder to meet the demands of the present year. The Loan Bill passed\r\nthrough both Houses.]\r\n\r\nI have so often addressed the House upon the question of India that I\r\nfeel some hesitation in asking a portion of the time of the Committee\r\nthis evening. But notwithstanding an observation of the right hon.\r\nGentleman the Secretary for India that he does not see anything gloomy\r\nin the future of India, I confess that to my view the question assumes\r\nyearly a greater magnitude, and I may say a greater peril. I think,\r\ntherefore, that having given some attention to this subject in years\r\npast, I may be permitted to bring my share, be its value more or less,\r\nto the attempt which we are now making to confront this great evil. When\r\nwe recollect how insufficient are the statements which he has from\r\nIndia, the right hon. Gentleman has given us as clear an account of the\r\nfinances of India as it was possible for him to do, and looking at them\r\nin the most favourable point of view we come to this conclusion:--We\r\nhave what we have had for twenty years, only more rapidly accumulating,\r\ndeficit on deficit and debt on debt.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman told the Committee that when he left the\r\nGovernment of India, I think in 1855, everything was in a most\r\nsatisfactory condition. Well, it did happen in that year, perhaps by\r\nsome of that kind of management which I have observed occasionally in\r\nIndian finance, that the deficit was brought down to a sum not exceeding\r\n150,000_l_. [Sir C. Wood: 'There was a surplus of 400,000_l_.'] The\r\ndeficit, I believe, before the mutiny was 143,000_l_. But, if the right\r\nhon. Gentleman will allow me to take the three years preceding the\r\nmutiny, I think that will give a much fairer idea of the real state of\r\nthe case, and it is not the least use shutting our eyes to the real\r\nstate of the case, because some day or other it will find us out, or we\r\nshall find it out. The real state of the case in the three years\r\npreceding the mutiny, 1855, 1856 and 1857, ending the 30th of April, is\r\na deficit of 2,823,000_l_., being an average not very far short of\r\n1,000,000_l_. a-year. That is the state of things immediately after the\r\nright hon. Gentleman left office. I do not in the least find fault with\r\nhim. He did not make the deficit, but I merely state this to show that\r\nthings are not at the moment in that favourable state which the right\r\nhon. Gentleman would induce the Committee to believe. Keeping our\r\nattention to that period, there is another point of view, which is also\r\nvery important. It appears to me that any Government must be an\r\nexcessively bad Government which cannot defray its expenses out of the\r\ntaxes which it levies on its people. We know, and every one has for\r\nyears known, that in India there is a source of revenue, not from taxes\r\nlevied on the people, but from opium, and which is very like the revenue\r\nderived by the Peruvian Government from guano. If we turn to those three\r\nyears and see what relation the expenditure of the Government had to\r\ntaxes levied on the people of India, we shall find, though we may hear\r\nthat the taxes are not so much as we imagine, or that the people are\r\nextremely poor, or that the Government is very extravagant--we shall\r\nfind that the sum levied for the sale of opium and transit was no less\r\nthan 10,500,000_l_., and if we add that to the 2,800,000_l_., we get a\r\nsum of 13,300,000_l_., which is the exact sum which the Government of\r\nIndia cost in those three years over and above what was raised from the\r\npeople by actual taxation. I say that this is a state of things which\r\nought to cause alarm, because we know, and we find it stated in the last\r\ndespatches, that the income derived from opium is of a precarious\r\ncharacter, and from the variation of climate in India, or from a\r\nvariation of policy in the Chinese Government, that revenue may\r\nsuddenly either be very much impaired or be cut off altogether.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman brings us to the condition in which we are now,\r\nand it may be stated in the fewest possible words to be this,--that the\r\ndebt of India has been constantly rising, and that it amounts now to\r\n100,000,000_l_. sterling. ['No, no!'] The right hon. Gentleman said\r\n95,000,000_l_., but he said there would be 5,000,000_l_. next\r\nyear, and I will undertake to say that it is fair to argue on the basis\r\nthat the debt of India at this moment is about 100,000,000_l_.,\r\nthat there is a deficit of 12,000,000_l_. this year, and that there\r\nmay be expected to be a deficit of 10,000,000_l_. next year. It is\r\nnot to be wondered at that it should be difficult to borrow money on\r\nIndian account.\r\n\r\nI am not surprised at the hon. Member for Kendal (Mr. Glyn) being so\r\nlively in the House to-night, and other hon. Gentlemen connected with\r\nthe City, who, I understand, have been impressing on the Secretary of\r\nState the fact that money cannot be had in the City for the purpose for\r\nwhich he wants it. I do not wonder that it is difficult to raise money\r\non Indian account. I should think it extraordinary if it could be\r\nborrowed without a high rate of interest. That it can be borrowed at all\r\ncan only arise from the fact that England, whatever disasters she gets\r\ninto, generally contrives, by the blood of her soldiers or by the\r\ntaxation of her people, to scramble through her difficulties, and to\r\nmaintain before the world, though by enormous sacrifices, a character\r\nfor good faith which is scarcely held by any other country in the world.\r\nWith regard to the question of an Imperial guarantee, I take an opposite\r\nview from the noble Lord (Lord Stanley) on that particular point, though\r\nI agree with what he said as to certain expenses thrown on the Indian\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nLast year I referred to the enormous expense of the Affghan war--about\r\n15,000,000_l_.--the whole of which ought to have been thrown on the\r\ntaxation of the people of England, because it was a war commanded by the\r\nEnglish Cabinet, for objects supposed to be English, but which, in my\r\nopinion, were of no advantage either to England or India. It was most\r\nunjust that this enormous burden should have been thrown upon the\r\nfinances of the Indian Government. But I do not oppose an Imperial\r\nguarantee because I particularly sympathize with the English taxpayers\r\nin this matter. I think the English taxpayers have generally neglected\r\nall the affairs of India, and might be left to pay for it. But there was\r\nno justice in imposing on the unfortunate millions of India the burden\r\nof a policy with which they had nothing to do, and which could not bring\r\nany one of them a single handful of rice more--it did bring them rather\r\nless than more--than they would have eaten without it. But I object to\r\nan Imperial guarantee on this ground,--if we let the Services of India,\r\nafter exhausting the resources of India, put their hands into the\r\npockets of the English people, the people of England having no control\r\nover the Indian expenditure, it is impossible to say to what lengths of\r\nunimagined extravagance they would go; and in endeavouring to save India\r\nmay we not go far towards ruining England?\r\n\r\nBut look at this question of Indian finance from another point of view.\r\nThe noble Lord (Lord Stanley) and the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary\r\nfor India have both referred to the enormous amount of the whole\r\ntaxation of India taken by the Military Service. I believe it has been\r\nshown that at this moment almost, if not altogether, the whole of the\r\nnet revenue of India is being absorbed by the Military Service of that\r\nempire; that not a farthing is left out of the whole net revenue of\r\nIndia to pay the expenses of the civil government or the public\r\ncreditor. If we leave out the opium duty, perhaps we shall see how far\r\nthe Military Service bears on the taxation of India; we shall see that\r\nmore than its net amount is absorbed by the Military Service. That is a\r\nstate of things that has never existed in any other country or among any\r\nother people, for any considerable period, without bringing that country\r\nto anarchy and ruin. We have been told by the Governor-General that the\r\ngreat bulk of the revenue of India is not elastic; that with regard to\r\nthe land-tax there has been for a long period no increase in it; that,\r\non the contrary, that large source of income has decreased. He tells us,\r\nfurther, that the army cannot, at present, be largely reduced with\r\nsafety. If so, what is the end to which we must come? Either the\r\nGovernment of India must come to an end, or England itself must become\r\ntributary to India. Seeing that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has\r\nwithin the last fortnight asked 70,000,000_l_. of the English\r\ntaxpayer for the expenses of the English Government, to ask nine or ten\r\nmillions more for the government of India would certainly cause great\r\ndissatisfaction in this country. The picture is, to my mind, an alarming\r\none, notwithstanding the cheerful view taken of it by the Secretary for\r\nIndia; and it has filled many besides myself with dismay.\r\n\r\nNow, looking round for modes of escape from this position, I believe\r\nthey exist, if we had the courage to adopt them. An hon. Friend has\r\nasked me, 'Is there nobody to tell the House of Commons the truth on\r\nthis matter?' I might ask why he has not done it himself. I suppose he\r\nis afraid of being thought rash; but his advice is, that the Government\r\nshould re-establish the independence of the Punjab, recall the Ameers of\r\nScinde, restore the Government of the King of Oude, giving to it the\r\ndependency of Nagpore. I confess, whether it be rash or not, that I\r\nthink it would be wise to restore the Government of the Punjab and to\r\ngive independence to that province which is called Scinde, because as no\r\nrevenue is received from that part of the country in excess of the\r\nexpense which its retention causes to this country, we should endeavour\r\nto bring our dominions in India within a reasonable and manageable\r\ncompass. No policy can be more lunatic than the policy of annexation we\r\nhave pursued of late years in India, and the calamity we are now meeting\r\nis the natural and inevitable consequence of the folly we have\r\ncommitted. It is not easy for great generals and statesmen who have been\r\nmade earls and marquesses and had bronze statues put up in their honour\r\nin our public squares--it is not easy for the statesmen who have done\r\nall this to turn round and reverse it all; they have not the moral\r\ncourage to do it; it might be an act of peril; it might appear a descent\r\nfrom the summit of empire and be wrongly construed throughout the world.\r\nBut as a question of finance and good government we should, a few years\r\nhence, admit that it was a sound policy. But I will not pursue this\r\nsubject, for I may fairly take it for granted that the House of Commons\r\nand the Government of England are not likely to take such a course till\r\nwe are reduced to some extremity even greater than that which now meets\r\nus.\r\n\r\nBut there is another course that may fairly be recommended. It is to\r\ntake India as it is, the empire with all your annexations as it stands,\r\nand to see if it is not possible to do something better with it than you\r\nhave done before, and to give it a chance in future years of redeeming\r\nnot only the character of the Government but its financial and\r\nlegislative position. The noble Lord (Lord Stanley) says there cannot be\r\nany great diminution in the expenditure for the Civil Service of India;\r\nbut I do not in the least agree with the Secretary for India when he\r\nsays that the gentlemen of the Civil Service in that country are not\r\noverpaid. Every one knows that they are overpaid; except some very high-\r\nsalaried bishops of whom we have heard, no men are so grossly overpaid\r\nas the officials of the Civil Service in India. The proof of this may be\r\nfound everywhere. Look at the Island of Ceylon; there the duties are as\r\narduous and the climate as unfavourable as in India; yet the Government\r\ndoes not pay its officials there more than one-half or two-thirds of the\r\nsalaries they are paid in India. There are in India itself many hundreds\r\nof Europeans, the officers of the Indian army, all the Indian clergy,\r\nand missionaries; there are also English merchants, carrying on their\r\nbusiness at rates of profit not much exceeding the profits made in this\r\ncountry. But the Civil Service of the Indian Government, like everything\r\nprivileged and exclusive, is a pampered body; and, notwithstanding it\r\nhas produced some few able men who have worthily done their duty, I do\r\nnot think the Civil Service of India deserves the loud praise we have so\r\nfrequently heard awarded to it by speakers in this House. Now if you\r\ncould reduce the expense of the Civil Service by any considerable\r\namount, the best thing you could do with the money would be to increase\r\nthe establishment by sending a greater number of competent persons as\r\nmagistrates, collectors, and officials into the distant provinces, and\r\nthereby double the facilities for good government in those districts. If\r\nyou could reduce the income of the Civil Service one half, you could for\r\nthe same money have a more efficient Service throughout India than at\r\npresent. You might not save money, but you would get a more complete\r\nService for it.\r\n\r\nBut the military question the House of Commons will certainly have to\r\ntake in hand; though Secretaries for India are afraid to grapple with\r\nit, I am not astonished that they feel some hesitation in doing so, for\r\nfrom every one connected with the Military Service they would hear the\r\nstrongest objections to reducing the number of the troops. But let me\r\nask the Committee to consider what it has just heard. Before the Revolt\r\nthe European troops in India numbered 45,000 and the Native troops\r\n250,000; now the 45,000 European troops are 110,000, and the 250,000\r\nNative soldiers are raised to 300,000. What was it that we heard during\r\nthe Indian mutiny; what was the cause of all the letters that appeared\r\nin the newspapers? Every man said that the great evil was having a\r\nNative army far larger than was required. That has been the source of\r\nperil, and that was the real cause of the mutiny. Now we have even a\r\nlarger portion of this most perilous element than we had before. The\r\nauthorities of India do not appear to have learnt anything from the\r\nmutiny, or they have learnt that all that was said in this House and in\r\nthis country was untrue, because they have 50,000 more Native troops\r\nthan they had before the mutiny. Therefore, the mode of argument appears\r\nto be this:--A Native army was the cause of the mutiny, the cause of all\r\nour perils, and now it is necessary to have more of it; and, as that is\r\nthe perilous element, of course 45,000 troops are not sufficient to keep\r\nthem in check; therefore, you have at present 110,000; and certain\r\nofficers who were examined, and the Commissioners who reported,\r\nrecommended that you should always have at least 80,000 Europeans there.\r\nIf we are only to have one body of troops to watch another, it seems to\r\nme there can be no hope of any diminution of our military force, nor any\r\nreal reduction in our expenditure. Why is it that you require all this\r\narmy? Let me ask the Committee to look at the matter as sensible men of\r\nbusiness. The Revolt, which has been such a terrible affair, has been\r\nsuppressed. It was suppressed mainly by the 45,000 men in India, and not\r\nby the 110,000 you have succeeded in placing there at a later period.\r\nMore than that, there is not at the present moment any alarming amount\r\nof dissatisfaction in India, or at least the dissatisfied are\r\ndispirited, and have lost all hope of resisting the power of England,\r\nand must for a long period, I think, remain wholly dispirited. At the\r\nsame time, you have disarmed the people over a vast province. There are\r\nmillions of people in India, a great number of whom were previously in\r\npossession of arms, who do not now possess a single weapon. I have seen\r\nin the last accounts, only a day or two since, a statement that not less\r\nthan 1,400 forts in the kingdom of Oude alone have been destroyed, and\r\nwe know that many more have been destroyed in other parts. There is at\r\nthis moment no power for combined organized armed resistance against\r\nyou, except that which is in the Native army, which the Indian\r\nGovernment has been building up of late to a greater extent than ever.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord (Lord Stanley) spoke of one point--the great importance\r\nof which I admit--the want of confidence and sympathy that must have\r\narisen between the two races in consequence of the transactions of the\r\nlast two years. The shock of revolt must have created great suspicion\r\nand hatred and fear, and there is nothing out of which panic grows so\r\neasily as out of those conditions. I believe that is the case in India,\r\nand perhaps there are indications of something of the kind at home.\r\nThere is a panic, therefore, and neither the Governor-General nor the\r\nCivil Service nor military officers can make up their minds that they\r\nare safe, recollecting the transactions of the past two years, in having\r\na less military force than we now have in India. But if you ask those\r\ngentlemen they will never say they have enough. There are admirals here,\r\nas we know, who are perfectly wild about ships, with whom arithmetic on\r\nsuch a question goes for nothing. They would show you in the clearest\r\npossible manner that you have not ships enough. So also, although I am\r\nglad to find not to the same extent, as to troops. Some one said the\r\nother night, in answer to an hon. Gentleman, about an increased force of\r\na particular kind, 'There is nothing like leather' and it is so. I say\r\nnaval officers and military officers are not the men to whom the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer should depute the great and solemn duty of\r\ndetermining what amount shall be expended for military purposes. There\r\nis not a country in the world that would not have been bankrupt long\r\nsince, and plunged into irretrievable ruin, if the military authorities\r\nhad been allowed to determine the amount of military force to be kept\r\nup, and the amount of revenue to be devoted to that purpose.\r\n\r\nI have another objection to this great army, and I now come to the\r\nquestion of policy, which, I am sorry to say for India, has not been\r\ntouched upon. I do not think this is a question to be merely settled by\r\na very clever manner of giving the figures of the case. Those figures\r\ndepend upon the course you intend to pursue, upon the policy which the\r\nGovernment intends to adopt, in that country. With this great army two\r\nthings are certain--we can have no reform of any kind in the Government\r\nof India, nor an improved conduct on the part of the English in India\r\ntowards the Natives of India. With a power like this--110,000 English\r\ntroops, with an English regiment within an hour's reach of each civil\r\nservant, you will find that the supremacy of the conquering race will be\r\ndisplayed in the most offensive manner.\r\n\r\nEverybody connected with India--the hon. Member for Devonport (Sir\r\nErskine Perry), the hon. Member for Aberdeen (Colonel Sykes)--all who\r\nare connected with India, know well that when the English were feeble in\r\nIndia, when they had not a great army in the field or a great revenue to\r\nsupport it, every Englishman treated the Natives by whom he was\r\nsurrounded rather with the feeling that he was an intruder in the\r\ncountry, and that it was not only proper but absolutely necessary to\r\ndeal in a conciliatory and just manner with the great body of the\r\nNatives of India; but precisely as our power increased the conduct of\r\nour countrymen changed, and I find in the excellent book of Mr. Shore\r\nthat thirty years ago he describes this as the very source of the\r\ngrowing ill feeling between the races in India. It has grown from that\r\ntime to this, until we have an irritation and animosity which in our\r\ntime, it may be, we shall see very little removed, and which may perhaps\r\nnever be wholly allayed. A Government, then, with this vast army, must\r\nalways be in a difficulty. Lord Canning--lord anybody else--cannot turn\r\nhis attention to anything but this wearing, exasperating question of how\r\nmoney is to be got for the next quarter to pay this army. He cannot turn\r\nhis attention in any way to reforms, and I am convinced that this House\r\nmust insist upon the Government reducing its army, whatever be the risk.\r\nA large army will render it impossible for you to hold the country, for\r\nyou will have a constantly increasing debt, and anarchy must inevitably\r\noverwhelm you in the end. A small army, a moderate, conciliatory, and\r\njust Government, with the finances in a prosperous condition;--and I\r\nknow not but that this country may possess for generations and centuries\r\na share, and a large share, in the government of those vast territories\r\nwhich it has conquered.\r\n\r\nAs to measures of reduction, I admit that it is of little use attempting\r\nthem unless they are accompanied by other changes. Here I have a charge\r\nto bring against the Indian Government. I did hope when the noble Lord\r\nspoke to-night that he would have told us something which I am sure he\r\nmust have known; that there is no such thing as a real Government in\r\nIndia at all; that there is no responsibility either to a public opinion\r\nthere, or to a public opinion at home; and that therefore we cannot\r\nexpect a better policy or happier results. Let hon. Gentlemen imagine a\r\nGovernment like that in India, over which the payers of the taxes have\r\nnot the slightest control; for the great body of the people in India\r\nhave, as we all know, no control in any way over the Government. Neither\r\nis there any independent English opinion that has any control over the\r\nGovernment, the only opinions being those of the Government itself, or\r\nthose of the Military and Civil Services, and chiefly of the latter.\r\nThey are not the payers of taxes; they are the spenders and the enjoyers\r\nof the taxes, and therefore the Government in India is in the most\r\nunfortunate position possible for the fulfilment of the great duties\r\nthat must devolve upon every wise and just Government. The Civil\r\nService, being privileged, is arrogant, and I had almost said tyrannous,\r\nas any one may see who reads the Indian papers, which mainly represent\r\nthe opinion of that Service and the Military Service, which, as\r\neverywhere else where it is not checked by the resolution of the\r\ntaxpayers and civilians, is clamorous and insatiable for greater\r\nexpenditure. The Governor-General himself,--and I do not make any attack\r\nupon Lord Canning, although I could conceive a Governor-General more\r\nsuited to his great and difficult position,--he is a creature of these\r\nvery Services.\r\n\r\nI now ask the noble Lord to remember a case which happened during the\r\ntime he held office, and if the Committee will allow me, for the sake of\r\nillustration, to refer to it, I do not think it will be any waste of\r\ntime. Hon. Gentlemen will recollect that during the last year, my hon.\r\nFriend the Member for Stockport (Mr. J. B. Smith), who has paid great\r\nattention to Indian subjects, put a question to the noble Lord relating\r\nto the annexation of a small territory called Dhar. What has been the\r\ncourse of events in relation to that case? The news of the annexation\r\nreached this country on the 20th of March last year. Upon the 23rd the\r\nquestion was put in this House, when the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr.\r\nBaillie), then Under-Secretary, replied, that the Government had just\r\nbeen informed of it by the Governor-General, and that he was solely\r\nresponsible for the act, the Government here having had no previous\r\ncommunication upon it. Upon the 11th of June the noble Lord (Lord\r\nStanley) announced to the House, in answer to a question, that he had\r\ndisallowed the annexation of Dhar. The despatch disallowing it has since\r\nbeen laid upon the table. It is dated June 22, and it asks for\r\ninformation from the Governor-General. In India they assumed this\r\nunfortunate Rajah to be guilty of misdemeanour, because his troops had\r\nrevolted, and the noble Lord in his despatch said, as I think very\r\nsensibly, 'If we cannot keep our own troops, what argument is it for\r\noverturning the independence of the territory of Dhar, seeing that the\r\nRajah himself has been faithful towards us, but his troops have\r\nrebelled?' The noble Lord asked for further information. In the\r\npreceding April the Ranee, the mother or step-mother of the Rajah, a\r\nmere boy of thirteen, sent two memorials to the Governor-General, one by\r\npost, and the other through the local British officer, remonstrating\r\nagainst the annexation, and proving, as far as she could, that the Rajah\r\nhad not been guilty of any wrong against us. This memorial was not\r\nacknowledged until August, when the Secretary for the Government of\r\nIndia desired the Ranee to forward the memorial through the Governor-\r\nGeneral's agent in Central India. In April these papers were laid upon\r\nthe table of the House with one exception. The Ranee's memorial was not\r\nincluded in those papers.\r\n\r\nNow, when those papers were laid before the House, why was not that\r\nmemorial, relating to the annexed territory, sent home and printed with\r\nthe other papers, so that hon. Members of this House might have read it?\r\nThe letter of the noble Lord (Lord Stanley) was dated the 22nd of June,\r\n1858, and to this hour it has never been answered. The noble Lord's\r\ndespatch disallowed the annexation; it condemned it, and asked for\r\ninformation. From the date of that despatch to this present 1st of\r\nAugust, 1859, there has not come any official information from the\r\nGovernor-General as to what he has done, or any answer to the noble\r\nLord's despatch, although sixteen months have elapsed. I say it is not\r\nfitting that the Secretary of State for India should be treated with\r\nutter disregard, if not with something like contempt, by any great\r\nsatrap who happens to be sent out to govern any of the provinces of this\r\ncountry. This very case shows, that in the midst of the terrible\r\nhurricane of the mutiny, the thirst for annexation was unslaked. At the\r\nvery moment, or just before, that the Queen issued her gracious\r\nProclamation here, the Government in India annexed the territory of this\r\nRajah, a boy of thirteen years of age, manifesting at the same time an\r\nutter disregard of the Government at home and the just sentiments, if\r\nthey could have been ascertained, of the whole body of the people of\r\nthis country. And this must be so as long as you have a Government like\r\nthat of Calcutta. Procrastination is its very nature.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord opposite (Lord Stanley) did an excellent thing. He did\r\nhonour to himself by appointing a man of a new sort as Governor of\r\nMadras. I have not much acquaintance with Sir C. Trevelyan, but I\r\nbelieve him to be a very intelligent man and very earnest for the good\r\nof India. But he finds that at Madras he is like a man who is manacled,\r\nas all the Governors are. He is able to do almost nothing. But he has a\r\nspirit above being the passive instrument for doing nothing in the hands\r\nof the Governor-General, and he has been disposed to make several\r\nchanges which have looked exceedingly heterodox to those who are\r\nconnected with the old Government of India, and which have shocked the\r\nnerves of the fifteen old gentlemen who meet in Leadenhall-street, and\r\ntheir brethren in India. I find that among the changes endeavoured to be\r\neffected by Sir C. Trevelyan, the following are enumerated:--He has\r\nendeavoured to conciliate the Natives by abolishing certain ceremonial\r\ndistinctions which were supposed to degrade them when visiting the\r\nGovernment House; he has shown that personal courtesy to them which\r\nappears to be too much neglected in India; he has conspicuously rewarded\r\nthose who have rendered services to the State; he has made one of the\r\nNatives his aide-de-camp; he has endeavoured to improve the land tenure,\r\nto effect a settlement of the Enam, and to abolish the impress of cattle\r\nand carts. He has also abolished three-fourths, or perhaps more, of the\r\npaper work of the public servants. He also began the great task of\r\njudicial reform, than which none is more urgently pressing. But what is\r\nsaid of Sir C. Trevelyan for instituting these reforms? He has raised a\r\nhornets' nest about him. Those who surround the Governor-General at\r\nCalcutta say, 'We might as well have the Governors of the Presidencies\r\nindependent, if they are to do as they like without consulting the\r\nGovernor-General as has been done in past times' The _Friend of\r\nIndia_ is a journal not particularly scrupulous in supporting the\r\nCalcutta Government, but it has a horror of any Government of India\r\nexcept that of the Governor-General and the few individuals who surround\r\nhim. A writer in the _Friend of India_ says:--\r\n\r\n  'Sir C. Trevelyan relies doubtless on Lord Stanley, and we do not\r\n  dream of denying that the Secretary of State has provocation\r\n  enough to excuse the unusual course he seems obliged to pursue.\r\n  To send a reform to Calcutta is, at present, simply to lay it\r\n  aside. It will probably not even be answered for two years,\r\n  certainly not carried in five. Even when sanctioned, it will have\r\n  to pass through a crucible through which no plan can escape\r\n  entire. That weary waiting for Calcutta, of which all men, from\r\n  Lord Stanley to the people of Singapore, now bitterly complain,\r\n  may well tempt the Secretary to carry on his plans by the first\r\n  mode offered to his hand.'\r\n\r\nHere are only a dozen lines from a long article, and there are other\r\narticles in the same paper to the same purport. I think, then, that I am\r\njustified in condemning any Secretary for India who contents himself\r\nwith giving us the figures necessary to show the state of the finances,\r\nwhich any clerk in the office could have done, and abstains from going\r\ninto the questions of the government of India and that policy upon which\r\nalone you can base any solid hope of an improvement in the condition of\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\nThere is another point I would mention. The Governor-General of India\r\ngoes out knowing little or nothing of India. I know exactly what he does\r\nwhen he is appointed. He shuts himself up to study the first volumes of\r\nMr. Mill's _History of India_, and he reads through this laborious\r\nwork without nearly so much effect in making him a good Governor-General\r\nas a man might ignorantly suppose. He goes to India, a country of twenty\r\nnations, speaking twenty languages. He knows none of those nations, and\r\nhe has not a glimmer of the grammar and pronunciation or meaning of\r\nthose languages. He is surrounded by half-a-dozen or a dozen gentlemen\r\nwho have been from fifteen to forty years in that country, and who have\r\nscrambled from the moderate but sure allowance with which they began in\r\nthe Service to the positions they now occupy. He knows nothing of the\r\ncountry or the people, and they are really unknown to the Government of\r\nIndia. To this hour the present Governor-General has not travelled\r\nthrough any considerable portion of the territory of India. If he did,\r\nhe would have to pay an increased insurance upon his life for travelling\r\nthrough a country in which there are very few roads and no bridges at\r\nall. Observe the position, then, in which the Governor-General is\r\nplaced. He is surrounded by an official circle, he breathes an official\r\nair, and everything is dim or dark beyond it. You lay duties upon him\r\nwhich are utterly beyond the mental or bodily strength of any man who\r\never existed, and which he cannot therefore adequately perform.\r\n\r\nTurning from the Governor-General to the Civil Service, see how short\r\nthe period is in which your servants in that country remain in any\r\nparticular office. You are constantly criticising the bad customs of the\r\nUnited States, where every postmaster and many other officers lose their\r\nsituations, and where others are appointed whenever a new President is\r\nelected. You never make blunders like the United States, and you will\r\ntherefore be surprised at a statement given in evidence by Mr.\r\nUnderbill, the Secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society. He says that\r\nin certain districts in Bengal there are three or four Englishmen to\r\n1,000,000 inhabitants, and that the magistrates are perpetually moving\r\nabout. I have here the names of several gentlemen cited. Mr. Henry\r\nLushington went to India in 1821, and remained till 1842. During these\r\ntwenty-one years he filled twenty-one different offices; he went to\r\nEurope twice, being absent from India not less than four and a quarter\r\nyears. Upon an average, therefore, he held his twenty-one offices not\r\nmore than nine months each. Mr. J. P. Grant was Governor of Bengal. That\r\nwas so good a place that he remained stationary in it. But he went to\r\nIndia in 1828 and remained there until 1841. In those thirteen years he\r\nheld twenty-four different situations, being an average of less than six\r\nmonths for each. Mr. Charles Grant--and I may say that Grant is a name\r\nwhich for three or four generations has been found everywhere in India,--\r\nhe was in India from 1829 to 1842, and in those thirteen years he\r\nfilled seventeen offices, being an average of only eight months for each\r\noffice. Mr. Halliday, Governor of Bengal, went to India in 1825, and\r\nremained until 1843. In those eighteen years he held twenty-one offices,\r\nand he did not become stationary until he was accredited to the\r\nlucrative and great office of Governor of Bengal.\r\n\r\nI think these facts show that there is something in the arrangements of\r\nthe Indian Government which makes it no Government at all, except for\r\nthe purpose of raising money and spending taxes. It is no Government for\r\nwatching over the people and conferring upon them those blessings which\r\nwe try to silence our consciences by believing the British Government is\r\nestablished in India to promote. What can a Governor-General do with\r\nsuch a Council, and with servants who are ever changing in all the\r\ndepartments? I am not stating my own opinion, but what is proved by the\r\nblue-books. Mr. Halliday stated that the police of Bengal were more\r\nfeared than the thieves and dacoits. But how is this Government, so\r\noccupied and so embarrassed, to be expected to put the police on a\r\nsatisfactory footing? With regard to justice, I might appeal to any\r\ngentleman who has been in India whether, for the most part, the Judges\r\nin the Company's Courts are not without training, and if they are\r\nwithout training, whether they will not probably be without law. The\r\ndelay is something of which we can have no conception, even with our\r\nexperience of the Court of Chancery in this country. Perjury and wrong\r\nare universal wherever the Courts of the Company's Service have been\r\nestablished in India. Of their taxation we hear enough to-night. It is\r\nclumsy and unscientific. In their finance there is such confusion that\r\nthe Government proposes to send out somebody, not to raise revenue, not\r\nto spend it, but somebody who will be able to tell you how it is raised\r\nand spent, for that is what you want to know. They have no system of\r\nbook-keeping whatever. The Secretary of State gives us a statement of\r\nrevenue and expenditure up to the 30th of April, 1858, sixteen months\r\nback, and even for the year preceding he can only furnish what he calls\r\nan 'estimate.' Would any other Legislative Assembly in the whole world,\r\nexcept this, tolerate such a state of things? I did try myself several\r\nyears ago to get a statement of the accounts up to a later period; but I\r\nfound it was of no use. They ought to be brought up to a later period;\r\nthe thing is quite within the range of possibility; it is simply not\r\ndone because there is no proper system of book-keeping, and no one\r\nresponsible for not doing it.\r\n\r\nYou have no Government in India; you have no financial statement; you\r\nhave no system of book-keeping; no responsibility; and everything goes\r\nto confusion and ruin because there is such a Government, or no\r\nGovernment, and the English House of Commons has not taken the pains to\r\nreform these things. The Secretary of State to-night points to the\r\nincrease in the English trade. In that trade I am myself interested, and\r\nI am delighted to see that increase; but it should be borne in mind that\r\njust now it is not a natural increase, and therefore not certain to be\r\npermanent. If you are spending so many millions in railroads and in\r\ncarrying on war--that is, 22,000,000_l_. for your armaments in\r\nIndia instead of 12,000,000_l_.--is not that likely to make a great\r\ndifference in your power to import more largely from this country? Do\r\nnot we know that when the Government of the day was pouring English\r\ntreasure into the Crimea the trade with the Levant was most materially\r\nincreased? And, therefore, I say it will be a delusion for the right\r\nhon. Gentleman to expect that the extraordinary increase which has taken\r\nplace within the last three years will go on in future in the same\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nNow, the point which I wish to bring before the Committee and the\r\nGovernment is this, because it is on this that I rely mainly--I think I\r\nmay say almost entirely--for any improvement in the future of India. It\r\nwould be impertinent to take up the time of the Committee by merely\r\ncavilling at what other people have said, and pointing out their errors\r\nand blunders, if I had no hope of being able to suggest any improvement\r\nin the existing state of things. I believe a great improvement may be\r\nmade, and by a gradual progress that will dislocate nothing. I dare say\r\nit may disappoint some individuals, but where it will disappoint one man\r\nin India it will please a thousand. What you want is to de-centralize\r\nyour Government. I hold it to be manifestly impossible to govern\r\n150,000,000 of persons, composing twenty different nations, speaking as\r\nmany different languages, by a man who knows nothing of India, assisted\r\nby half-a-dozen councillors belonging to a privileged order, many of\r\nwhom have had very little experience in India, except within narrow\r\nlimits, and whose experience never involved the consideration and\r\nsettlement of great questions of statesman ship. If you could have an\r\nindependent Government in India for every 30,000,000 of its people, I do\r\nnot hesitate to say, though we are so many thousand miles away, that\r\nthere are Englishmen who, settling down among those 20,000,000 of\r\npeople, would be able to conduct the Government of that particular\r\nprovince on conditions wholly different and immeasurably better than\r\nanything in the way of administration which we have ever seen in India.\r\n\r\nIf I were Secretary of State for India,--but as I am not, I will\r\nrecommend the right hon. Gentleman to do that which I would do myself,\r\nor I would not hold his office for one month; because, to hold office\r\nand come before the House Session after Session with a gloomy statement,\r\nand with no kind of case to show that you are doing anything for India,\r\nor that you are justified in holding possession of it at all, is nothing\r\nbut to receive a salary and to hold a dignity without any adequate\r\nnotion of the high responsibility attaching to them. I am not blaming\r\nthe right hon. Gentleman in particular; he is only doing what all his\r\npredecessors before him have done. There has been no real improvement\r\nsince I have sat in Parliament in the government of India, and I believe\r\nthe Bill of last year is not one whit better for purposes of\r\nadministration than any that has gone before. But I would suggest to the\r\nright hon. Gentleman, whether it would not be a good thing to bring in a\r\nBill to extend and define the powers of the Governors of the various\r\nPresidencies in India? I do not ask the right hon. Gentleman to turn out\r\nthe fifteen gentlemen who assist him in Leadenhall-street to vegetate on\r\ntheir pensions, but I ask him to go to India and to take the Presidency\r\nof Madras for an instance. Let arrangements be made by which that\r\nPresidency shall be in a position to correspond directly with him in\r\nthis country, and let every one connected with that Government of Madras\r\nfeel that, with regard to the interests and the people of that\r\nPresidency, they will be responsible for their protection. At present\r\nthere is no sort of tie between the governors and the governed. Why is\r\nit that we should not do for Madras what has been done for the Island of\r\nCeylon? I am not about to set up the Council of Ceylon as a model\r\ninstitution--it is far from that; but I will tell you what it is, and\r\nyou will see that it would not be a difficult thing to make the change I\r\npropose. The other day I asked a gentleman holding an office in the\r\nGovernment, and who had lived some years in Ceylon, what was the state\r\nof the Council? He said it was composed of sixteen members, of whom six\r\nwere non-official and independent, and the Governor had always a\r\nmajority. He added that at the present moment in that Council there was\r\none gentleman, a pure Cingalese by birth and blood, another a Brahmin,\r\nanother a half-caste, whose father was a Dutchman and whose mother was a\r\nNative, and three others who were either English merchants or planters.\r\nThe Council has not much _prestige_, and therefore it is not easy\r\nto induce merchants in the interior to be members and to undertake its\r\nmoderate duties; but the result is that this Cingalese, this Brahmin,\r\nthis half-caste, and these three Englishmen, although they cannot out-\r\nvote Sir H. Ward, the Governor, are able to discuss questions of public\r\ninterest in the eye and the ear of the public, and to tell what the\r\nindependent population want, and so to form a representation of public\r\nopinion in the Council, which I will undertake to say, although so\r\ninefficient, is yet of high importance in the satisfactory government of\r\nthat island. Why is it that we can have nothing like this in the\r\nCouncils of Madras or Bombay? It would be an easy thing to do, and I\r\nbelieve that an Act of Parliament which would do it would lay the\r\nfoundation of the greatest reform that has yet taken place in India. At\r\npresent all the Governors are in fetters; and I see that blame has been\r\nimputed to Sir Charles Trevelyan for endeavouring to break through those\r\nfetters. No doubt an attempt will be made to have him recalled, but I\r\nhope that the right hon. Gentleman, while he moderates the ardour of the\r\nGovernor so far as to prevent a rebellion among the civilians, will\r\nsupport him honestly and faithfully in all those changes which the right\r\nhon. Gentleman knows as well as I do are essential to the improvement of\r\nthe government of that country.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another question, and that is, what is to be done with\r\nregard to the people of India on the subject of education, and\r\nespecially with reference to the matter of religious instruction? I beg\r\nthe right hon. Gentleman to be cautious how he takes the advice of any\r\ngentleman in this country, who may ask him to make changes in the\r\nestablished order of things there by appearing in the slightest degree\r\nto attempt to overthrow the caste and religion of the Natives of India.\r\nI have here an extract from a letter written by a gentleman who was\r\npresent at one of the ceremonies of reading the Queen's Proclamation in\r\nNovember last. He says:--\r\n\r\n  'Not less than 7,000 Natives of all ranks and conditions and\r\n  religions flocked to the esplanade at Tellicherry, where there\r\n  was no show but the parading of a company of Sepoys, who fired a\r\n  _feu de joie_ very badly, to hear the Queen's Proclamation\r\n  read. All who heard, all who heard not, manifested the deepest\r\n  interest in it. The pledged inviolability of their religion and\r\n  their lands spread like wildfire through the crowd, and was soon\r\n  in every man's mouth. Their satisfaction was unbounded.... I\r\n  mentioned that I went to Tellicherry to hear the Queen's\r\n  Proclamation read. We have since had it read here (Anjarakandy).\r\n  You will see an account of what took place on the occasion in the\r\n  accompanying copy of an official report I addressed to the\r\n  assistant-magistrate. What I have described understates the\r\n  feeling manifested by the people. They were all eyes and ears,\r\n  listening breathlessly to what was being read. You will observe\r\n  that convening them for any public purpose whatever, except here,\r\n  was a thing unknown, and would have been a thing scouted under\r\n  the Company's Government. Here I always assemble them,\r\n  communicate everything they ought to know and hear, and talk it\r\n  over with them. But a Queen's Proclamation is not an every-day\r\n  affair, so they came in crowds, and I will venture to say that\r\n  there is not another place in the Queen's India where it was so\r\n  clearly explained to them or so thoroughly understood. But the\r\n  impartial toleration of their religion and caste was the be-all\r\n  and end-all of their comments, praise, and individual\r\n  satisfaction. One Mafitta said, \"They had had scores of\r\n  proclamations upon every conceivable subject, but never one so\r\n  wise and sensible as this.\"\r\n\r\nThe East India Company was a wonderful Company for writing despatches.\r\nThere was nothing so Christian as their doctrine, nothing so unchristian\r\nas their conduct. That Proclamation has in it the basis of all you\r\nshould aim at in future in India--a regard to the sacredness of their\r\nproperty, and the sacredness of their religion, and an extension to them\r\nof as regular and full justice as is shown to your own countrymen.\r\nDepend upon it these Natives of India can comprehend this as well as we\r\ncomprehend it; and, if you treat them as we are treated, and as they\r\nought to be treated, you will not require 400,000 men to help you to\r\ngovern a people who are notoriously among the most industrious and most\r\npeaceable to be found on the face of the earth. There has lately been an\r\nact done by the noble Lord (Lord Stanley) to which I must allude. Why he\r\ndid it I do not know. I am sure the noble Lord did not mean to do an act\r\nof injustice--though very great injustice has been done. A question was\r\nput the other night about a Native of India who had come to this country\r\nto qualify himself for entering into competition for employment in the\r\nCivil Service of his country. I have seen that young gentleman, and\r\nconversed with him; and when I state his case, it will be seen whether\r\nhe has been treated well or wisely, though the regulation under which he\r\nhas suffered may have been made without any reference to him\r\nindividually. He arrived in this country in June, 1856, and remained\r\npreparing himself for competition for two years and a-half till\r\nDecember, 1858, when a new regulation came out, which made twenty-two\r\ninstead of twenty-three years of age the period for entering the Civil\r\nService. He might have been ready for competition in July, 1860, but he\r\ncould not be ready in July, 1859. Under these circumstances he would be\r\npast the age of twenty-two before he could be able to present himself\r\nfor examination. The consequence is, that he has been obliged to turn\r\nhimself to another channel for employment. His father is an assistant-\r\nbuilder in the Government dockyard of Bombay, and has been in England.\r\nThere was great interest excited among the Natives when the young man\r\nleft India to come to England, and there is great disappointment among\r\nhis friends at the result. He has been laughed at for trusting the\r\nGovernment, and it is said that while Government go on changing their\r\nregulations in this way no faith can be put in them. Now this is the\r\nfirst case of this kind that has happened. This young gentleman (or his\r\nfather) has expended 1,500_l_. in coming here and in endeavouring\r\nto get the best education, solely with a view to be suited for the Civil\r\nService. If he had entered into that Civil Service a great thing would\r\nhave been accomplished. The result would have been that the House and\r\nthe Secretary for India would have seen that it was very unjust, while\r\nthe son of any one here could pursue his studies at home and enter into\r\ncompetition for the Civil Service, that the sons of the Natives of India\r\nwho wish to enter into the service of their own country must come\r\nthousands of miles at great expense, and live apart from their families\r\nfor years, before they are able to accomplish their object, and the\r\nresult must have been that you would have established in some city in\r\nIndia the same mode of examination that you have established here. You\r\nmust have been led to do that which would have enabled young men in\r\nIndia to offer themselves for the Civil Service of their country on as\r\nfavourable terms as could be done in England. I am sure the noble Lord\r\nnever had the slightest idea of the regulation having reference to this\r\nyoung man, or of injuring him; yet it has been done, and what has\r\noccurred leads to the conclusion that either somebody very deep in these\r\nmatters has been at the bottom of this change, or that some combination\r\nof unfortunate circumstances has been at work, by which that which we\r\nhave all so much at heart has been retarded. If the noble Lord had\r\nstruck out this regulation, or made a new one, by which this young man\r\ncould have had a chance of going home as a servant of the Civil Service,\r\nthe fact would have been worth many regiments of soldiers in India.\r\n\r\nIn speaking on this subject I have nothing new to offer to the attention\r\nof the House. I have propounded the very same theories and remedies\r\nyears ago. They are not my remedies and theories. I am not the inventor\r\nof local government for India; but the more I have considered the\r\nsubject--the more I have discussed it with the Members of this House and\r\nwith gentlemen connected with India--the more I am convinced that you\r\nwill not make a single step towards the improvement of India unless you\r\nchange your whole system of government--unless you give to each\r\nPresidency a government with more independent powers than are now\r\npossessed by it. What would be thought if the whole of Europe was under\r\none governor, who knew only the language of the Feejee Islands, and that\r\nhis subordinates were like himself, only more intelligent than the\r\ninhabitants of the Feejee Islands are supposed to be? You set a governor\r\nover 150,000,000 of human beings, in a climate where the European cannot\r\ndo the work he has to do so well as here, where neither the moral nor\r\nphysical strength of the individual is equal to what it is at home,--and\r\nyou do not even always furnish the most powerful men for the office;--\r\nyou seem to think that the atmosphere will be always calm and the sea\r\nalways smooth. And so the government of India goes on; there are\r\npromises without number of beneficial changes, but we never heard that\r\nIndia is much better or worse than before. Now, that is not the way to\r\ndo justice to a great empire like India. If there had been a better\r\ngovernment in India, the late disturbances among your own troops would\r\nnot have happened; and I own I tremble when I reflect that every post\r\nmay bring us, in the present temper of the European troops in India,\r\nsome dire intelligence of acts which they may have committed, because\r\nthey may think that this is a convenient opportunity for pressing some\r\ngreat claim of their own.\r\n\r\nI beg the Committee to consider this matter, notwithstanding that the\r\nright hon. Gentleman is not disposed to take a gloomy view of the state\r\nof India. Look at your responsibilities. India is ruled by Englishmen,\r\nbut remember that in that unfortunate country you have destroyed every\r\nform of government but your own; that you have cast the thrones of the\r\nNatives to the ground. Princely families, once the rulers of India, are\r\nnow either houseless wanderers in the land they once called their own,\r\nor are pensioners on the bounty of those strangers by whom their\r\nfortunes have been overthrown. They who were noble and gentle for ages\r\nare now merged in the common mass of the people. All over those vast\r\nregions there are countless millions, helpless and defenceless, deprived\r\nof their natural leaders and their ancient chiefs, looking with only\r\nsome small ray of hope to that omnipresent and irresistible Power by\r\nwhich they have been subjected. I appeal to you on behalf of that\r\npeople. I have besought your mercy and your justice for many a year\r\npast; and if I speak to you earnestly now, it is because the object for\r\nwhich I plead is dear to my heart. Is it not possible to touch a chord\r\nin the hearts of Englishmen, to raise them to a sense of the miseries\r\ninflicted on that unhappy country by the crimes and the blunders of our\r\nrulers here? If you have steeled your hearts against the Natives, if\r\nnothing can stir you to sympathy with their miseries, at least have pity\r\nupon your own countrymen. Rely upon it the state of things which now\r\nexists in India must, before long, become most serious. I hope that you\r\nwill not show to the world that, although your fathers conquered the\r\ncountry, you have not the ability to govern it.\r\n\r\nYou had better disencumber yourselves of the fatal gift of empire than\r\nthat the present generation should be punished for the sins of the past.\r\nI speak in condemnatory language, because I believe it to be deserved. I\r\nhope that no future historian will have to say that the arms of England\r\nin India were irresistible, and that an ancient empire fell before their\r\nvictorious progress,--yet that finally India was avenged, because the\r\npower of her conqueror was broken by the intolerable burdens and evils\r\nwhich she cast upon her victim, and that this wrong was accomplished by\r\na waste of human life and a waste of wealth which England, with all her\r\npower, was unable to bear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, MARCH 19, 1861.\r\n\r\n_From Hansard_.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Dunlop brought forward a motion to inquire into the discrepancies\r\nbetween certain sets of documents, relating to the Afghan war of 1837-8.\r\nIt appeared that some passages in the despatches of Sir Alexander Burnes\r\nhad been mutilated, in order to make it appear that he advised a policy\r\nwhich he really condemned. Mr. Dunlop moved for a Committee to inquire\r\ninto this alleged mutilation of despatches presented to the House. The\r\nmotion was negatived.]\r\n\r\nWhen the noble Lord rose, I observed, from his countenance and from his\r\nlanguage, that he seemed to be suffering from the passion of anger.\r\n[Viscount Palmerston: 'Not much.'] 'Not much,' the noble Lord says. I\r\nadmit that in the course of his speech he calmed down; but he was so far\r\nled from what I think was a fair course as to charge the hon. and\r\nlearned Gentleman who introduced this Motion with making a violent and\r\nvituperative speech, and he spoke of 'that vocabulary of abuse of which\r\nthe hon. Gentleman appeared to be master.' Now, I will undertake to say\r\nthat I am only speaking the opinion of every Gentleman in the House who\r\nheard the speech which introduced this question, when I say that there\r\nhas rarely been delivered here on any subject a speech more strictly\r\nlogical, more judicially calm, and more admirable than that which we\r\nhave heard to-night from the hon. and learned Member for Greenock. But\r\nthe fact is the noble Lord felt himself hit.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord is on his trial in this case; and on that account I\r\nexpect that at the conclusion of the debate he will not feel himself at\r\nliberty to object to the appointment of this Committee. After a few\r\nsentences the noble Lord touched upon the case of Sir Alexander Burnes,\r\nand he made a very faint denial of the misrepresentations which are\r\ncharged against the Government of that day in the case of that\r\ngentleman. But he went on to say that, after all, these things were of\r\nno importance; that what was in, or what was left out, was unimportant.\r\nBut I should like to ask the noble Lord what was the object of the\r\nminute and ingenious, and I will say unmatched care which was taken in\r\nmutilating the despatches of a gentleman whose opinions were of no\r\nimportance and whose writings could not make the slightest difference\r\neither to the question or to the opinions of any person concerned? The\r\nnoble Lord, too, has stooped to conduct which, if I were not in this\r\nHouse, I might describe in language which I could not possibly use here\r\nwithout being told that I was transgressing the line usually observed in\r\ndiscussions in this assembly. The noble Lord has stooped so low as to\r\nheap insult, throughout the whole of his speech, upon the memory of a\r\nman who died in the execution of what he believed to be his public duty--\r\na duty which was thrust upon him by the mad and obstinate policy of the\r\nnoble Lord; and whilst his blood cries to Heaven against that policy,\r\nthe noble Lord, during a three-quarters of an hour's speech in this\r\nHouse, has scarcely ceased to heap insult on his memory.\r\n\r\nWhat the noble Lord told us throughout his speech was that Sir Alexander\r\nBurnes was a man of the greatest simplicity of character. I could not,\r\nhowever complimentary I were disposed to be, retort that upon the noble\r\nLord. He says that Sir Alexander Burnes--of whom he spoke throughout in\r\nthe most contemptuous manner--an eminent political agent at the Court of\r\nDost Mahommed, was beguiled by the treachery of that Asiatic ruler; that\r\nhe took everything for truth which he heard, and that, in point of fact,\r\nhe was utterly unfit for the position which he held at Cabul. But\r\nalthough the noble Lord had these despatches before him, and knew all\r\nthe feelings of Sir Alexander Burnes, he still continued Sir Alexander\r\nBurnes there. He was there two years after these despatches were\r\nwritten, in that most perilous year when not only himself but the whole\r\narmy--subjects of the Queen--fell victims to the policy of the noble\r\nLord. Now, I must tell the noble Lord what my hon. and learned Friend,\r\nthe Member for Greenock, did not discuss, and what the Committee is not\r\nto do--because every Member who heard the speech of the hon. and learned\r\nMember for Greenock, and those who listened to the speech of the noble\r\nLord, must have seen that from the first the noble Lord evaded the whole\r\nquestion. He endeavoured to lead the House to believe that my hon. and\r\nlearned Friend was going into some antiquarian researches about the\r\npolicy of the English or the Indian Government twenty years ago, and\r\nthat it was proposed to have a Committee to dig up all the particulars\r\nof our supposed peril from the designs of Russia at that time. But the\r\nfact is that my hon. and learned Friend had no such intention; and there\r\nwas no man in the House more cognizant of that fact than the noble Lord\r\nwhen he ingeniously endeavoured to convey a contrary impression to the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to go into the policy of the war. And there is\r\nanother question that it is not proposed to go into. It is not proposed\r\nto inquire whether Sir Alexander Burnes or Lord Auckland was Governor-\r\nGeneral. We know that Lord Auckland was Governor-General; but we know\r\nthat a Governor-General who may be many hundreds, or in India, perhaps,\r\n2,000 miles away from the place where particular events are transpiring,\r\nmust rely to a considerable extent on the information he receives from\r\nthe political agent who is on the spot. If this be so, clearly what Sir\r\nAlexander Burnes thought, and what he said, and what he wrote, is of\r\nsome importance. At least, if the House of Commons has any evidence\r\nplaced before it, the noble Lord will agree that in a great question\r\nlike this--I am not speaking of the present time, but of the time when\r\nthese events happened--it is of first-rate importance that the House\r\nshould have evidence not on one side only, but on both sides. There is\r\nanother thing we do not propose to inquire into, and that is the policy\r\nof Russia at that time. I cannot very well understand the course which\r\nthe noble Lord has taken on this point; for I find that about twelve\r\nmonths after the writing of these very despatches, the mutilation of\r\nwhich is now complained of, the noble Lord made a reply to the Russian\r\nMinister who had declared that there was nothing whatever hostile to\r\nEngland in the instructions which were furnished to Vicovich. He says--\r\n\r\n  'There has not existed the smallest design hostile to the English\r\n  Government, nor the smallest idea of endangering the tranquillity\r\n  of the British possessions in India.'\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord, in reply to that, on the 20th December, 1838, just a\r\nyear after the writing of these despatches by Sir Alexander Burnes,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n  'Her Majesty's Government accept as entirely satisfactory the\r\n  declaration of the Russian Government that it does not harbour\r\n  any designs hostile to the interests of Great Britain in India.'\r\n\r\nI may leave that question there, because I can assure the noble Lord\r\nthat my hon. and learned Friend has not the smallest intention--I judge\r\nso, at least, from his speech--of bringing anybody before the Committee\r\nto attack or defend the policy of the Government in the war which then\r\nunhappily took place. Nor do I suppose it is intended to arraign anybody\r\nfor a policy that sacrificed at least 20,000 human lives--20,000 lives\r\nof the subjects of the Queen of England. Nor is it intended to inquire\r\nhow far the loss of more than 15,000,000_l_. sterling by that\r\npolicy has affected for all future time the finances and the\r\ncircumstances of the Government of India. These are crimes--the whole of\r\nthat policy is a crime--of a nature never to be answered for. No man can\r\naccurately measure it. No Committee of this House could adequately\r\npunish those who were the perpetrators of it. No, Sir, my hon. and\r\nlearned Friend has not the slightest idea of going back twenty years for\r\nthe purpose of bringing the noble Lord, or any one else who may be\r\nguilty of that great crime, to the bar of public opinion by this\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nBut it is worth while that the House should know whether the Government\r\nin whom it placed confidence at that time, and in whom the Queen placed\r\nconfidence--whether that Government was worthy of their confidence, and\r\nwhether any members of the Government of that day are members of the\r\nGovernment at this day. It is worth while knowing whether there was and\r\nis a man in high position in the Government here or in India who had so\r\nlow a sense of honour and of right that he could offer to this House\r\nmutilated, false, forged despatches and opinions of a public servant,\r\nwho lost his life in the public service. Conceive any man at this moment\r\nin India engaged, as many have been during the last three years, in\r\nperilous services--conceive that any man should know that to-morrow, or\r\nnext week, or any time this year, he may lay his bones in that distant\r\nland, and that six months afterwards there may be laid on the table of\r\nthis House by the noble Lord at the head of the Government, or by the\r\nSecretary of State for India, letters or despatches of his from which\r\npassages have been cut out, and into which passages have been inserted,\r\nin which words have been so twisted as wholly to divert and distort his\r\nmeaning, and to give to him a meaning, it may be, utterly the contrary\r\nto that which his original despatch intended to convey. I cannot\r\nconceive any anticipation more painful or more bitter, more likely to\r\neat into the heart of any man engaged in the service of his country in a\r\ndistant land.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted, and the noble Lord has not flatly denied it--he cannot\r\ndeny it--he knows it as well as the hon. and learned Member for\r\nGreenock--he knows it as well as the very man whose hand did the evil--\r\nhe knows there have been garbling, mutilation, practically and\r\nessentially falsehood and forgery, in these despatches which have been\r\nlaid before the House. Why was it refused to give the original\r\ndespatches when they were asked for in 1842 by the hon. Member for\r\nInverness-shire (Mr. H. Baillie), and when they were asked for at a\r\nlater period by the hon. Member for Sheffield (Mr. Hadfield)? Why was it\r\nthat the originals were so consistently withheld? That they have been\r\ngiven now I suppose is because those who were guilty of the outrage on\r\nthe faith of Parliament thought, as twenty years had elapsed, that\r\nnobody would give himself the trouble to go into the question, and that\r\nno man would be so earnest as my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock in\r\nbringing the question before the notice of Parliament.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield (Mr. Hadfield) informs me that\r\nit was the noble Lord the Member for King's Lynn (Lord Stanley) who\r\nconsented to the production of the original despatches when he was in\r\noffice. I was not aware of that fact; but I am free here to tender him\r\nmy thanks for the course which he took. I am sure he is the last man\r\nwhom any one would suspect of being mixed up in any transaction of this\r\nkind, except with a view to give the House and the country full\r\ninformation with regard to it. I say, then, avoiding all the long speech\r\nof the noble Lord, that the object of the Committee is to find out who\r\ndid this evil thing--who placed upon the table of the House information\r\nwhich was knowingly false, and despatches that were actually forged--\r\nbecause if you add to or detract from, or so change a coin, or note, or\r\ndeed, as to make any of them bear a meaning contrary to its original and\r\nintended meaning, of course you are guilty of such an act as I have\r\ndescribed, and that is precisely what somebody has done in the\r\ndespatches which we are now discussing. I say an odious offence has been\r\ncommitted against the House, and against the truth; and what we want to\r\nknow is, who did it?\r\n\r\nNow, will the noble Lord be candid enough--he does not think there is\r\nanything wrong--he says there is not much--it is very trifling--that Sir\r\nAlexander Burnes's opinions are not worth much--supposing it to be so--\r\nfor the sake of argument, let me grant it; but if it is a matter of no\r\nimportance, will the noble Lord be so candid as to tell us who did it?\r\nWhen Lord Broughton was examined before the Official Salaries Committee\r\nsome years ago, he, as the noble Lord is aware, said that he took upon\r\nhimself as President of the Board of Control at the time the entire\r\nresponsibility of the Affghan war. The noble Lord now at the head of the\r\nGovernment was then a member of the India Board, and so I believe was\r\nthe noble Lord the Member for the City of London. But the noble Lord at\r\nthe head of the Government was also Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Now,\r\nI do not think I am wrong in supposing that this question lies between\r\nthe noble Lord the Prime Minister and Lord Broughton, once a Member of\r\nthis House. This thing was not done by some subordinate who cannot be\r\nfound out.\r\n\r\nMy hon. and learned Friend says it has been done with marvellous care,\r\nand even with so much ability that it must have been done by a man of\r\ngenius. Of course there are men of genius in very objectionable walks of\r\nlife; but we know that the noble Lord at the head of the Government is a\r\nman of genius; if he had not been, he would not have sat on that bench\r\nfor the last fifty years. And we know that Lord Broughton is a man of\r\nmany and varied accomplishments. And once more I ask the noble Lord to\r\ntell us who did it? He knows who did it. Was it his own right-hand, or\r\nwas it Lord Broughton's right-hand, or was it some clever secretary in\r\nthe Foreign Office or in the India Office who did this work? I say the\r\nHouse has a right to know. We want to know that. We want to drag the\r\ndelinquent before the public. This we want to know, because we wish to\r\ndeter other Ministers from committing the like offence; and we want to\r\nknow it for that which most of all is necessary--to vindicate the\r\ncharacter and honour of Parliament. Nothing can sink Parliament to a\r\nlower state of degradation and baseness than that it should permit\r\nMinisters of the Crown to lay upon the table, upon questions involving\r\nthe sacrifice of 20,000,000_l_. of money and 20,000 lives,\r\ndocuments which are not true--which slander our public servants, and\r\nwhich slander them most basely when they are dead and are not here to\r\nanswer. I do not believe that the Gentlemen of England in this House--\r\nupon that side of the House or upon this--will ever consent to sit down\r\nwith a case proved so clearly as this is without directing the\r\nomnipotent power and eye of Parliament into the matter. I say, seeing\r\nthe charge, seeing that the noble Lord was at the head of the Foreign\r\nOffice at the time, that the policy of the Affghan war was always\r\nconsidered to be his, that the responsibility of this act must rest\r\nbetween him and Lord Broughton,--I should not like to hold the opinion,\r\nand I do not hold the opinion, that the noble Lord will object to a\r\nCommittee to inquire into a matter in which he is himself so directly\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, MARCH 13, 1865.\r\n\r\n_From Hansard_.\r\n[Delivered during the debate on Colonel Jervois' Report on the Defences\r\nof Canada.]\r\n\r\nI am not sure that I should have addressed the House on this occasion\r\nbut for the observations which have been made by the noble Lord. I think\r\nhe has been perhaps a little more frank in his declarations on this\r\noccasion, and in pointing out the real thing which I suspect is passing\r\nin his mind, and in the minds of very many Members of the House who have\r\nmade no statement of their own opinions during this debate. I hope the\r\ndebate will be useful, although I am obliged to say, while I admit the\r\nimportance of the question that has been brought before us, that I think\r\nit is one of some delicacy. That it is important is clear, because it\r\nrefers to the possibility of war between this country and the United\r\nStates, and its delicacy arises from this--that it is very difficult to\r\ndiscuss this question without saying things which tend rather in the\r\ndirection of war than in the direction of peace.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which is now before us is this--that there is an\r\nextensive colony or dependency of this country lying adjacent to the\r\nUnited States, and if there be a war party in the United States--a party\r\nhostile to this country--that circumstance affords to it a very strong\r\ntemptation to enter without much hesitation into a war with England,\r\nbecause it may feel that through Canada it can inflict a great\r\nhumiliation upon this country. And at the same time it is perfectly well\r\nknown to all intelligent men, especially to the statesmen and public men\r\nof the United States--it is as well known to them as it is to us--that\r\nthere is no power whatever in this United Kingdom to defend successfully\r\nthe territory of Canada against the power of the United States. Now we\r\nought to know that, in order to put ourselves right upon this question,\r\nand that we may not talk folly and be called upon hereafter to act\r\nfolly. The noble Lord at the head of the Government--or the Government,\r\nat any rate is responsible for having compelled this discussion; because\r\nif a Vote is to be asked for during this Session--and it is only the\r\nbeginning of other Votes--it is clearly the duty of the House to bring\r\nthe subject under discussion. I think the Vote now is particularly\r\ninopportune for many reasons, but especially as we have heard from the\r\nGovernor-General of Canada that they are about, in the North-American\r\nProvinces, to call into existence a new nationality; and I, for one,\r\nshall certainly object to the taxes of this country being heedlessly\r\nexpended in behalf of any nationality but our own.\r\n\r\nNow, what I should like to ask the House is this--first of all, will\r\nCanada attack the States? Clearly not. Next, will the States attack\r\nCanada--I am keeping out of view England altogether? Clearly not. There\r\nis not a man in the United States, probably, whose voice or whose\r\nopinion would have the smallest influence in that country, who would\r\nrecommend or desire that an attack should be made by the United States\r\nupon Canada with a view to its forcible annexation to the Union. There\r\nhave been lately, as we know, dangers on the frontier. The Canadian\r\npeople have been no wiser than some Members of this House--or than a\r\ngreat many men amongst the richer classes in this country. And when the\r\nrefugees from the South--I am not speaking now of respectable and\r\nhonourable men from the South, many of whom have left that country\r\nduring these troubles, and for whom I feel the greatest commiseration,\r\nbut I mean the ruffians from the South--who in large numbers have\r\nentered Canada and have employed themselves there in a course of policy\r\nlikely to embroil us with the United States--I say that the people of\r\nCanada have treated these men with far too much consideration. They\r\nexpressed very openly opinions hostile to the United States, whose power\r\nlay close to them.\r\n\r\nI will not go into a detail of that which we are all sufficiently well\r\nacquainted with--the seizing of American ships on the Lakes, the raid\r\ninto the State of Vermont, the robbing of a bank, the killing of a man\r\nin his own shop, the stealing of horses in open day, and another\r\ntransaction of which we have very strong proof, that men of this class\r\nactually conspired to set fire to the largest cities of the Union. All\r\nthese things have taken place and the Canadian Government made scarcely\r\nany sign. I believe that an application was made to the noble Lord at\r\nthe head of the Foreign Office nearly a year ago, that he should\r\nstimulate the Canadian Government to some steps to avoid the dangers\r\nthat have since arisen; but with that sort of negligence which has been\r\nso much seen here, nothing was done until the American Government and\r\npeople, aroused by the nature of these transactions, showed that they\r\nwere no longer about to put up with them. Then the Canadian Government\r\nand people took a little notice. Now, Lord Monck, the Governor-General\r\nof Canada--about whose appointment I have heard some people complain,\r\nsaying that he was a mere follower of the noble Lord at the head of the\r\nGovernment, who lost his election and was therefore sent out to govern a\r\nprovince--Lord Monck, I am bound to say, from all I have heard from\r\nCanada, has conducted himself in a manner very serviceable to the\r\ncolony, and with the greatest possible propriety as representing the\r\nSovereign there. Lord Monck has been all along favourable to the United\r\nStates, and I believe his Cabinet has also. I know that at least the\r\nmost important newspaper there has always been favourable to the North.\r\nStill nothing was done; but the moment these troubles arose then\r\neverything was done. Volunteers have been sent to the frontier; the\r\ntrial of the raiders has been proceeded with, and possibly they will be\r\nsurrendered; and the Canadian Chancellor of the Exchequer has proposed a\r\nvote in their House of Parliament to restore to the persons at St.\r\nAlbans, who were robbed by the raiders, the 50,000 dollars that were\r\ntaken from them.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the state of things now? There is the greatest possible calm\r\non the frontier. The United States have not a word to say against\r\nCanada. The Canadian people have found that they were in the wrong and\r\nhave now returned to their right mind. There is not a man in Canada at\r\nthis moment, I believe, who has any idea that the United States\r\nGovernment has the smallest notion of attacking them, now or at any\r\nfuture time, on account of anything that has transpired between the\r\nUnited States and Canada during these trials. But if there comes a war\r\nin which Canada shall suffer and be made a victim, it will be a war got\r\nup between the Government of Washington and the Government of London.\r\nAnd it becomes us to inquire whether that is at all probable. Is there\r\nanybody in this House in favour of such a war? I notice with general\r\ndelight--and I was not a false prophet when I said some time ago that\r\nsome day it would be so--I say I notice with delight the changed tone\r\nmanifested here with regard to these American questions. Even the noble\r\nLord the Member for Stamford (Lord Robert Cecil) can speak without\r\nanger, and without any of that ill feeling which I am sorry to say on\r\npast occasions he has manifested in discussing these questions.\r\n\r\nNow, I believe there are no men out of Bedlam--or at least who ought to\r\nbe out of it--and I suspect there are very few men in Bedlam, who are in\r\nfavour of our going to war with the United States. And in taking this\r\nview I am not arguing that it is because we see the vast naval and\r\nmilitary power and apparently inexhaustible resources of that country. I\r\nwill not assume that you or my countrymen have come to the conclusion\r\nthat it is better for us not to make war with America, because you and\r\nthey find her with a strength that you did not even suspect: I will say\r\nthat it is upon higher grounds that we are all against a war with the\r\nUnited States. Our history for the last 200 years, and further back, is\r\na record of calamitous, and for the most part, unnecessary wars. We have\r\nhad enough of whatever a nation can gain by military successes and\r\nmilitary glory. I will not turn to the disasters that might follow to\r\nour commerce nor to the wide-spread ruin that might be occasioned. I\r\nwill say that we are a wiser and a better people than we were in these\r\nrespects, and that we should regard a war with the United States as even\r\na greater crime, if needlessly entered into, than war with almost any\r\nother country in the world.\r\n\r\nLooking at our Government, we have preserved, with a good many blunders--\r\none or two of which I shall comment upon by-and-by--neutrality during\r\nthis great struggle. We have had it stated in this House, and we have\r\nhad a Motion in this House, that the blockade was ineffective and ought\r\nto be broken. Men of various classes, some of them agents of the\r\nRichmond conspiracy--persons, it is said, of influence from France--all\r\nthese are reported to have brought their influence to bear on the noble\r\nLord at the head of the Government and his colleagues, with a view of\r\ninducing them to take part in this quarrel, and all this has failed to\r\nbreak our neutrality. Therefore, I should say, we may clearly come to\r\nthe conclusion that England is not in favour of war; and if there should\r\nbe any act of war, or any aggression whatever, out of which Canada will\r\nsuffer, I believe honestly that it will not come from this country. That\r\nis a matter which gives me great satisfaction, and I believe the House\r\nwill agree with me that I am not misstating the case.\r\n\r\nNow let us ask, Is the United States for war? I know the noble Lord the\r\nMember for Stamford (Lord Robert Cecil) has a lurking idea that there is\r\nsome danger from that quarter; I am not at all certain that it does not\r\nprevail in other minds, and in many minds not so acute as that with\r\nwhich the noble Lord is gifted. If we had at the Bar of the House, Lord\r\nRussell as representing the English Government, and Mr. Adams as the\r\nrepresentative of the Government of President Lincoln, and if we were to\r\nask their opinion, they would tell us that which the Secretary for the\r\nColonies has this night told us--that the relations between the two\r\ncountries, so far as it is possible to discover them, are perfectly\r\namicable; and I know from the communications between the Minister of the\r\nUnited States and our Minister for Foreign Affairs that they have been\r\ngrowing more and more amicable for many months past. Now, I take the\r\nliberty of expressing this opinion--that there has never been an\r\nadministration in the United States since the time of the Revolutionary\r\nWar, up to this hour, more entirely favourable to peace with all foreign\r\ncountries, and more especially favourable to peace with England, than\r\nthe Government of which President Lincoln is the head. I will undertake\r\nto say that the most exact investigator of what has taken place will not\r\nbe able to point to a single word he--President Lincoln--has said, or a\r\nsingle line he has written, or a single act he has done, since his first\r\naccession to power, that betrays anger against this country, or any of\r\nthat vindictive feeling which some persons here may imagine to inflame\r\nthe breasts of the President and his Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThen if Canada is not for war, if England is not for war, and if the\r\nUnited States are not for war, whence is the war to come? That is what I\r\nshould like to ask. I wish the noble Lord the Member for Stamford had\r\nbeen a little more frank. I should like to ask whence comes the anxiety,\r\nwhich undoubtedly to some extent prevails? It may be assumed even that\r\nthe Government is not wholly free from it; for they have shown it in an\r\nalmost ludicrous manner by proposing a vote of 50,000_l_. It is\r\nsaid the newspapers have got into a sort of panic. They can do that any\r\nnight between the hours of six and twelve o'clock, when they write their\r\narticles. They are either very courageous or very panic-stricken.\r\n\r\nIt is said that 'the City' joins in this feeling. We know what 'the\r\nCity' means--the right hon. Gentleman alluded to it to-night. It means\r\nthat the people who deal in shares--though that does not describe the\r\nwhole of them--'the moneyed interest' of the City, are alarmed. Well, I\r\nnever knew the City to be right. Men who are deep in great monetary\r\ntransactions, and who are steeped to the lips sometimes in perilous\r\nspeculations, are not able to take broad and dispassionate views of\r\npolitical questions of this nature.\r\n\r\nAs to the newspapers, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for\r\nBradford (Mr. W. E. Forster) when, referring to one of them in\r\nparticular, he intimated that he thought its course was indicated by a\r\nwish to cover its own confusion. Surely, after four years' uninterrupted\r\npublication of lies with regard to America, I should think it has done\r\npretty much to destroy its influence on foreign questions for ever.\r\n\r\nBut there is a much higher authority--that is the authority of the\r\nPeers. I do not know why we should be so much restricted with regard to\r\nthe House of Lords in this House. I think I have observed that in their\r\nplace they are not so squeamish as to what they say about us. It\r\nappeared to me that in this debate the right hon. Gentleman (Mr.\r\nDisraeli) felt it necessary to get up and endeavour to defend his chief.\r\nNow, if I were to give advice to the hon. Gentlemen opposite, it would\r\nbe this--for while stating that during the last four years many noble\r\nLords in the other House have said foolish things, I think I should be\r\nuncandid if I did not say that you also have said foolish things--learn\r\nfrom the example set you by the right hon. Gentleman. He, with a\r\nthoughtfulness and statesmanship which you do not all acknowledge, he\r\ndid not say a word from that bench likely to create difficulty with the\r\nUnited States. I think his chief and his followers might learn something\r\nfrom his example.\r\n\r\nBut I have discovered one reason why in that other place mistakes of\r\nthis nature are so often made. Not long ago there was a great panic\r\nraised, very much by what was said in another place about France. Now an\r\nattempt is made there to create a panic upon this question. In the hall\r\nof the Reform Club there is affixed to the wall a paper which gives a\r\ntelegraphic account of what is being done in this House every night, and\r\nwhat is also being done in the other House, and I find almost every\r\nnight from the beginning of the Session that the only words that have\r\nappeared on the side which is devoted to a record of the proceedings of\r\nthe House of Lords are these, 'Lords adjourned.' The noble Lord at the\r\nhead of the Government is responsible for much of this. He has brought\r\nthis House into nearly the same condition. We do very little, and they\r\ndo absolutely nothing. All of us in our younger days, I am quite sure,\r\nwere taught by those who had the care of us a verse which was intended\r\nto inculcate the virtue of industry. One couplet was to this effect--\r\n\r\n  'Satan still some mischief finds\r\n    For idle hands to do.'\r\n\r\nAnd I do not believe that men, however high in station, are exempt from\r\nthat unfortunate effect which arises to all of us from a course of\r\ncontinued idleness. But I should like to ask this House in a most\r\nserious mood, what is the reason that any man in this country has now\r\nmore anxiety with regard to the preservation of peace with the United\r\nStates than he had a few years ago? Is there not a consciousness in our\r\nheart of hearts that we have not during the last five years behaved\r\ngenerously to our neighbours? Do not we feel in some sort a pricking of\r\nconscience, and are we not sensible that conscience tends to make us\r\ncowards at this particular juncture?\r\n\r\nI shall not review the past transactions with anger, but with feelings\r\nof sorrow; for I maintain, and I think history will bear out what I say,\r\nthat there is no generous and high-minded Englishman who can look back\r\nupon the transactions of the last four years without a feeling of sorrow\r\nat the course we have pursued on some important occasions. As I am\r\nwishful to speak with a view to a better state of feeling, both in this\r\ncountry and in the United States, I shall take the liberty, if the House\r\nwill permit me for a few minutes, to refer to two or three of these\r\ntransactions, where, I think, though perhaps we were not in the main\r\ngreatly wrong, yet in some circumstances we were so far unfortunate as\r\nto have created an irritation which at this moment we wish did not\r\nexist. The hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Seymour Fitzgerald) referred to\r\nthe course taken by the Government with regard to the acknowledgment of\r\nthe belligerent rights of the South. Now I have never been one to\r\ncondemn the Government for acknowledging those belligerent rights,\r\nexcept upon this ground--I think it might be logically contended that it\r\nmight possibly have become necessary to take that step--but I do think\r\nthe time and manner in which it was done were most unfortunate, and\r\ncould not but produce very evil effects.\r\n\r\nGoing back nearly four years, we recollect what occurred when the news\r\narrived of the first shot having been fired at Fort Sumter. That, I\r\nthink, was about the 12th of April. Immediately after that time it was\r\nannounced that a new Minister was coming to this country. Mr. Dallas had\r\nintimated to the Government that as he did not represent the new\r\nPresident he would rather not undertake anything of importance; but that\r\nhis successor was on his way and would arrive on such a day. When a man\r\nleaves New York on a given day you can calculate to about twelve hours\r\nwhen he will be in London. Mr. Adams, I think, arrived in London about\r\nthe 13th of May, and when he opened his newspaper next morning he found\r\nthe Proclamation of neutrality, acknowledging the belligerent rights of\r\nthe South. I say that the proper course to have taken would have been to\r\nhave waited till Mr. Adams arrived here, and to have discussed the\r\nmatter with him in a friendly manner, explaining the ground upon which\r\nthe English Government had felt themselves bound to issue that\r\nProclamation, and representing that it was not done in any manner as an\r\nunfriendly act towards the United States Government. But no precaution\r\nwhatever was taken; it was done with unfriendly haste; and it had this\r\neffect, that it gave comfort and courage to the conspiracy at Montgomery\r\nand at Richmond, and caused great grief and irritation amongst that\r\nportion of the people of America who were most strongly desirous of\r\nmaintaining friendly relations between their country and England.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this point allow me to suppose a great revolt had taken\r\nplace in Ireland, and that we had sent over within a fortnight of the\r\noccurrence of such an unfortunate event a new Minister to Washington,\r\nand that on the morning after arriving there he had found, that without\r\nconsulting him, the Government had taken a hasty step by which the\r\nbelligerent rights of the insurgents had been acknowledged, and by which\r\ncomfort and support had been given them. I ask any man whether, under\r\nsuch circumstances, the feeling throughout the whole of Great Britain,\r\nand in the mind of every man anxious to preserve the unity of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, would not necessarily be one of irritation and\r\nexasperation against the United States?\r\n\r\nI will not argue this matter further--to do so would be simply to\r\ndepreciate the intellect of the hon. Gentlemen listening to me. Seven or\r\neight months afterwards there happened another transaction of a very\r\ndifferent but unfortunate nature--that is the transaction arising out of\r\nthe seizure of two Southern envoys on board an English ship--the\r\n_Trent_. I recollect making a speech down at Rochdale about the\r\ntime of that occurrence. It was a speech entirely in favour of the\r\nUnited States Government and people--but I did not then undertake, as I\r\ndo not undertake now, in the slightest degree to defend the seizure of\r\nthose two envoys. I said that although precedents for such an action\r\nmight possibly be found to have occurred in what I will call some of the\r\nevil days in our history, at any rate it was opposed to the maxims and\r\nprinciples of the United States Government, and was, as I thought, a bad\r\nact--an act which should not have been done. Well, I do not complain of\r\nthe demand that those men should be given up; but I do complain of the\r\nmanner in which that demand was made, and the menaces by which it was\r\naccompanied. I think it was wrong and unstatesman-like that at the\r\nmoment we heard of the seizure, when there was not the least foundation\r\nfor supposing that the United States Government were aware of the act,\r\nor had in the slightest degree sanctioned it, as we since well know they\r\ndid not, that we should immediately get ships ready, and send off\r\ntroops, and incite the organs of the press--who are always too ready to\r\ninflame the passions of the people to frenzy--to prepare their minds for\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut that was not all; because before the United States had heard a word\r\nof the matter from this country their Secretary of State had written to\r\nMr. Adams a despatch, which was communicated to our Government, and in\r\nwhich it was stated that the transaction had not been done by any orders\r\nof theirs, and that therefore, as far as they and we were concerned, it\r\nwas a pure accident, which they should consider with the most friendly\r\ndisposition towards this country. How came it that this despatch was\r\nnever published for the information of the people of this country? How\r\nhappened it that, during one whole month the flame of war was fanned by\r\nthe newspapers, particularly by those supposed to be devoted to the\r\nGovernment, and that one of those newspapers, supposed to be peculiarly\r\ndevoted to the Prime Minister, had the audacity--I do not know whence it\r\nobtained its instructions--to deny that any such despatch had been\r\nreceived? Now, Sir, I am of opinion that it is not possible to maintain\r\namicable relations with any great country--I think it is not possible to\r\ndo so with any little one--unless Governments will manage these\r\ntransactions in what I will call a more courteous and more honourable\r\nmanner. I happen to know--for I received a letter from the United\r\nStates, from one of the most eminent men in that country, dated only two\r\ndays before those men were given up, in which the writer said--that the\r\nreal difficulty in the course of the President was that the menaces of\r\nthe English Government had made it almost impossible for them to\r\nconcede; and that the question they asked themselves was whether the\r\nEnglish Government was intending to seek a cause of quarrel or not. And\r\nI am sure the noble Lord at the head of the Government, if such a demand\r\nhad been made upon him with courtesy and fairness, as should be between\r\nfriendly nations, would have been more disposed to concede, and would\r\nhave found it much more easy to concede, than if the demand had been\r\naccompanied by menaces such as his Government offered to the Government\r\nof the United States. Now the House will observe that I am not\r\ncondemning the Government of this country on the main point of what they\r\ndid. I am only condemning them because they did not do what they had to\r\ndo in that manner which would be most likely to remove difficulties and\r\npreserve a friendly feeling between the two nations.\r\n\r\nThen I come to the last thing I shall mention--to the question of the\r\nships which have been preying upon the commerce of the United States. I\r\nshall confine myself to that one vessel, the _Alabama_. She was\r\nbuilt in this country; all her munitions of war were from this country;\r\nalmost every man on board her was a subject of Her Majesty. She sailed\r\nfrom one of our chief ports. She is known to have been built by a firm\r\nin which a Member of this House was, and I presume is, interested. Now,\r\nSir, I do not complain--I know that once, when I referred to this\r\nquestion two years ago, when my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford\r\nbrought it forward in this House, the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr.\r\nLaird) was excessively angry--I do not complain that the Member for\r\nBirkenhead has struck up a friendship with Captain Semmes, who may\r\nprobably be described, as another sailor once was of similar pursuits,\r\nas being 'the mildest mannered man that ever scuttled ship.' Therefore,\r\nI do not complain of a man who has an acquaintance with that notorious\r\nperson, and I do not complain, and did not then, that the Member for\r\nBirkenhead looks admiringly upon the greatest example which men have\r\never seen of the greatest crime which men have ever committed. I do not\r\ncomplain even that he should applaud that which is founded upon a\r\ngigantic traffic in living flesh and blood--a traffic into which no\r\nsubject of this realm can enter without being deemed a felon in the eyes\r\nof our law and punished as such. But what I do complain of is this, that\r\nthe hon. Gentleman the Member for Birkenhead, a magistrate of a county,\r\na deputy-lieutenant--whatever that may be--a representative of a\r\nconstituency, and having a seat in this ancient and honourable Assembly--\r\nthat he should, as I believe he did, if concerned in the building of\r\nthis ship, break the law of his country, by driving us into an\r\ninfraction of International Law, and treating with undeserved disrespect\r\nthe Proclamation of neutrality of the Queen.\r\n\r\nI have another complaint to make, and in allusion to that hon. Member.\r\nIt is within your recollection that when on a former occasion he made\r\nthat speech and defended his course, he declared that he would rather be\r\nthe builder of a dozen _Alabamas_ than do something which nobody\r\nhas done. That language was received with repeated cheering from the\r\nOpposition side of the House. Well, Sir, I undertake to say that that\r\nwas at least a most unfortunate circumstance, and I beg to tell the hon.\r\nGentleman that at the end of last Session, when the great debate took\r\nplace on the question of Denmark, there were many men on this side of\r\nthe House who had no objection whatever to see the present Government\r\nturned out of office, for they had many grounds of complaint against\r\nthem, but they felt it impossible that they should take the\r\nresponsibility of bringing into office the right hon. Member for\r\nBuckinghamshire or the party who could utter such cheers on such a\r\nsubject as that.\r\n\r\nTurning from the Member for Birkenhead to the noble Lord at the head of\r\nthe Foreign Office, he, who in the case of the acknowledgment of\r\nbelligerent rights had proceeded with such remarkable celerity, such\r\nundue and unfriendly haste, amply compensated for it when he came to the\r\nquestion of the _Alabama_, by his slowness of procedure. And this\r\nis a strange circumstance, which even the noble Lord's Colleagues have\r\nnever been able to explain, that although he sent orders to Cork to stop\r\nthe _Alabama_ if she arrived there, he allowed her afterwards, when\r\nshe had gone out of the jurisdiction of the Crown in these islands, to\r\ngo into a dozen or a score of ports belonging to this country in\r\ndifferent parts of the world. It seems to me that this is rather a\r\nspecial instance of that feebleness of purpose and of action on the part\r\nof the noble Lord which I regret to say has on many occasions done much\r\nto mar what would otherwise be a great political career. I will not\r\ndetain the House on the question of the rams. The hon. Member for\r\nBirkenhead, or the firm or the family, or whoever the people are at\r\nBirkenhead who do these things, this firm at Birkenhead, after they had\r\nseen the peril into which the country was drifting on account of the\r\n_Alabama_, proceeded most audaciously to build those two rams; and\r\nit was only at the very last moment, when on the eve of a war with the\r\nUnited States on account of those rams, that the Government happily had\r\nthe courage to seize them, and thus the last danger was averted.\r\n\r\nI suppose there are some shipowners here. I know there are many in\r\nLondon--there are many in Liverpool--what would be the feeling in this\r\ncountry if they suffered in this way from ships built in the United\r\nStates? There is a shipowner in New York, Mr. Lowe, a member of the\r\nChamber of Commerce of New York. He had three large ships destroyed by\r\nthe _Alabama_; and the _George Griswold_, which came to this\r\ncountry freighted with a heavy cargo of provisions of various kinds for\r\nthe suffering people of Lancashire, was destroyed on her return passage,\r\nand the ship that destroyed it may have been, and I believe was, built\r\nby these patriotic shipbuilders of Birkenhead. These are things that\r\nmust rankle in the breast of a country which is subjected to such losses\r\nand indignities. Even to-day I see in the newspapers that a vessel that\r\nwent out from this country has destroyed ten or eleven ships between the\r\nCape of Good Hope and Australia. I have thought it unnecessary to bring\r\ncontinually American questions before the House, as some Gentlemen have\r\ndone during the last two or three Sessions. They should have asked a few\r\nquestions in regard to these ships; but no, they asked no question upon\r\nthese points. They asked questions upon every point on which they\r\nthought they might embarrass the Government and make the great\r\ndifficulties of the Government greater in all their transactions with\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nBut the Members of the Government have not been wise. I hope it will not\r\nbe thought that I am unnecessarily critical if I say that Governments\r\nare not generally very wise. Two years ago the noble Lord at the head of\r\nthe Government and the Attorney-General addressed the House. I asked the\r\nnoble Lord--I do not often ask him for anything--to speak, if only for\r\nfive minutes, words of generosity and sympathy to the Government and\r\npeople of the United States. He did not do it. Perhaps I was foolish to\r\nexpect it. The Attorney-General made a most able speech. It was the only\r\ntime that I have listened to him, ever since I have known him in this\r\nHouse, with pain, for I thought his speech was full of bad morals and\r\nbad law. I am quite certain that he even gave an account of the facts of\r\nthe case which was not as ingenuous and fair as the House had a right to\r\nexpect from him. Next Session the noble Lord and the Attorney-General\r\nturned quite round. They had a different story about the same\r\ntransaction, and gradually, as the aspect of things was changed on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic, there has been a gradual return to good\r\nsense and fairness, not only on the part of Members upon the Treasury\r\nBench, but on that of other Members of the House.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I would not willingly say a word that would wound either the\r\nnoble Lord at the head of the Foreign Office or the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, because I do not know amongst the official statesmen of this\r\ncountry two men for whom I have greater sympathy or more respect; but I\r\nhave to complain of them. I do not know why it is that they both go down\r\nto Newcastle--a town in which I feel a great interest--and there give\r\nforth words of offence and unwisdom. I know that what the noble Lord\r\nsaid was all very smart, but really it was not true, and I have not much\r\nrespect for a thing that is merely smart and is not true. The Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer made a statement too. The papers made it appear that he\r\ndid it with exultation; but that is a mistake. But he made a statement,\r\nand though I do not know what will be in his Budget, I know his wishes\r\nin regard to that statement--namely, that he had never made it.\r\n\r\nThose Gentlemen, bear in mind, sit, as it were, on a hill; they are not\r\nobscure men, making speeches in a public-house or even at a respectable\r\nmechanics' institution; they are men whose voice is heard wherever the\r\nEnglish language is known. And knowing that, and knowing what effect\r\ntheir speeches will have, especially in Lancashire, where men are in\r\ntrade, and where profits and losses are affected by the words of\r\nstatesmen, they use the language of which I complain; and beyond this,\r\nfor I can conceive some idea of the irritation those statements must\r\nhave caused in the United States. I might refer to the indiscriminating\r\nabuse of the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Sheffield; and I\r\nmay add to that the unsleeping ill-will of the noble Lord the Member for\r\nStamford. I am not sure that these two Members of the House are in the\r\nleast degree converted yet. I think I heard the hon. Member for\r\nSheffield utter to-night some ejaculation that looked as if he retained\r\nall his old sentiments. [Mr. Roebuck: 'Exactly.'] I am sorry it is so. I\r\ndid expect that these things would be regretted and repented of; and I\r\nmust express my hope that if any one of you who have been thus\r\nungenerous shall ever fall into trouble of any kind that you will find\r\nyour friends more kind and more just than you have been to your fellow-\r\ncountrymen--for I will still call them so--at the other side of the\r\nAtlantic. And as to the press, Sir, I think it is unnecessary to say\r\nmuch about that, because every night those unfortunate writers are now\r\nendeavouring to back out of everything they have been saying; and I can\r\nonly hope that their power for evil in future will be greatly lessened\r\nby the stupendous exhibition of ignorance and folly which they have made\r\nto the world.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, having made this statement, I suppose the noble Lord the\r\nMember for Stamford, if he were to get up after me, would say: 'Well, if\r\nall this be true--if we have done all these injurious things, if we have\r\ncreated all this irritation in the United States--will it not be likely\r\nthat this irritation will provoke a desire for vengeance, and that the\r\nchances of war are greatly increased by it?' I do not know whether the\r\nchances of war are increased, but I will say that not only is war not\r\ncertain, but it is to the last degree improbable.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, there is another side to this question. All England is not\r\nincluded in the rather general condemnation which I have thought it my\r\nduty to express. There is another side. Looking to our own population,\r\nwhat have the millions been saying and doing--the millions you are so\r\nmuch afraid of?--especially the noble Lord the Member for Stamford, who\r\nobjects to the transference of power to those millions from those who\r\nnow hold it, and, from his position, naturally objects. I beg leave to\r\ntell the House that, taking the counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire--\r\nyour great counties of population--the millions of men there, whose\r\nindustry has not only created but sustains the fabric of your national\r\npower, have had no kind of sympathy with the views which I have been\r\ncondemning. They have been more generous and more wise; they have shown\r\nthat magnanimity and love of freedom are not extinct. And, speaking of\r\nthe county from which I come--the county of many sorrows, whose griefs\r\nhave hung like a dark cloud over almost every heart during the last\r\nthree years--all the attempts which the agents of the Confederacy have\r\nmade there by money, by printing, by platform speeches, by agitation,\r\nhave utterly failed to get from that population one expression of\r\nsympathy with the American insurrection. And, Sir, if the bond of union\r\nand friendship between England and America shall remain unbroken, we\r\nshall not have to thank the wealthy and the cultivated, but those\r\nlaborious millions whom statesmen and histories too frequently take\r\nlittle account of. They know a little of the United States, which\r\nGentlemen opposite and some on this side the House do not appear to\r\nknow. They know that every man of them would be better off on the\r\nAmerican continent, if he chose to go there, and would be welcome to\r\nevery right and privilege that the people there are in possession of.\r\nThey know further that every man may have from the United States\r\nGovernment a free gift of 160 acres of the most fertile land in the\r\nworld. [A laugh.] I do not understand that laugh, but the gift, under\r\nthe Homestead Act of America, of 160 acres of land is a great deal for a\r\nman who has no land. I can tell you that the Homestead Act and the\r\nliberality of the American Government have had a great effect upon the\r\npopulation of the North of England, and I can tell you further--that the\r\nlabouring population of this country--the artisans and the mechanics--\r\nwill never join heartily in any policy which is intended to estrange the\r\npeople of the United States from the people of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, we have other securities for peace which are not less than\r\nthese, and I find them in the character of the Government and people of\r\nthe American Union. I think the right hon. Gentleman the Member for\r\nBuckinghamshire (Mr. Disraeli) referred to what must reasonably be\r\nsupposed to happen in case this rebellion should be put down--that when\r\na nation is exhausted it will not rush rashly into a new struggle. The\r\nloss of life has been great, the loss of treasure enormous. Happily for\r\nthem, this life and this treasure have not been sacrificed to keep a\r\nBourbon on the throne of France, or to keep the Turks in Europe; the\r\nsacrifice was for an object which every man could comprehend, which\r\nevery man could examine by the light of his own intelligence and his own\r\nconscience; for if these men have given their lives and their\r\npossessions, it was for the attainment of a great end, the maintenance\r\nof the unity and integrity of a great country. History in future time\r\nmust be written in a different spirit from all history in the past, if\r\nit should express any condemnation of that people. Mr. Lincoln, who is\r\nnow for the second time President of the United States, was elected\r\nexclusively by what was termed the Republican party. He is now elected\r\nby what may be called the Great Union party of the nation. But Mr.\r\nLincoln's party has always been for peace. That party in the North has\r\nnever carried on any war of aggression, and has never desired one. I\r\nspeak of the North only, the Free States. And let the House remember\r\nthat in that country landed property, property of all kind, is more\r\nuniversally distributed than in any other nation, that instruction and\r\nschool education are also more widely diffused there than amongst any\r\nother people. I say, they have never carried on hitherto a war for\r\naggrandizement or for vengeance, and I believe they will not begin one\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nCanada, I think the noble Lord will admit, is a very tempting bait, not\r\nindeed for the purpose of annexation, but for the purpose of humiliating\r\nthis country. I agree with hon. Gentlemen who have said that it would be\r\ndiscreditable to England, in the light of her past history, that she\r\nshould leave any portion of her Empire which she could defend,\r\nundefended. But still it is admitted--and I think the speech of the\r\nright hon. Gentleman the Member for Calne (Mr. Lowe) produced a great\r\neffect upon those who heard it--the House admitted that in case of war\r\nwith the United States, Canada could not be defended by any power on\r\nland or at sea which this country could raise or spare for that purpose.\r\nI am very sorry, not that we cannot defend Canada, but that any portion\r\nof the dominions of the British Crown is in such circumstances as to\r\ntempt evil-disposed people to attack it with the view of humiliating us,\r\nbecause I believe that transactions which humiliate a Government and a\r\nnation are not only disagreeable, but a great national harm.\r\n\r\nBut, now, is there a war party in the United States? I believe there is\r\nsuch a party. It is that party which was a war party eighty years ago.\r\nIt is the party represented by hon. Gentlemen who sit on that bench--the\r\nIrish party. They who are hostile to this country in the United States\r\nare those who were recently malcontent subjects of the right hon.\r\nGentleman the Member for Tamworth. It is these, and such as these, to\r\nwhom the noble Lord at the head of the Government offers only such\r\nconsolation as that of telling them that 'the rights of the tenants are\r\nthe wrongs of the landlords,' who constitute the only war party in the\r\nUnited States; and it was the war party there in the days of Lord North.\r\nBut the real power of the United States does not rest on that class.\r\nAmerican mobs--and, excepting some portion of the population of New\r\nYork, I would not apply the language even to them--for the sake of\r\nforcing their Congress and their Executive to a particular course, are\r\naltogether unknown. The real mob in your sense, is that party of\r\nchivalrous gentlemen in the South, who have received, I am sorry to say,\r\nso much sympathy from some persons in this country and in this House.\r\nBut the real power depends upon another class--the landowners throughout\r\nthe country, and there are millions of them. In this last election for\r\nPresident of the United States, I was told by a citizen of New York, who\r\nwas most active in the election, that in the State of New York alone\r\n100,000 Irish votes were given, as he expressed it, solidly--that is, in\r\none mass--for General M'Clellan, and that not more than 2,000 were given\r\nfor President Lincoln. You see the preponderance of that party in the\r\ncity of New York, and that is the feeling amongst them throughout the\r\nState of New York; but, throughout the whole of the United States, it is\r\nmerely a small per-centage, which has no sensible effect upon the\r\nconstitution of Congress, or upon legislation or government.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Bradford (Mr. W. E. Forster) referred to a\r\npoint which I suppose has really been the cause of this debate, and that\r\nis the temper of the United States in making certain demands upon our\r\nGovernment. I asked a question the other night after the noble Lord had\r\nasked a question upon the subject--I asked whether we had not claims\r\nagainst them. I understand that claims were made upon us by the United\r\nStates amounting to 300,000_l_. or 400,000_l_. I am afraid\r\nthat we have claims against them, amounting probably to as much as that.\r\nIf any man thinks he has a right to go to law with another, and that\r\nother has an answer to his claim, the case must be heard. And so between\r\ntwo great nations and two free Governments. If one has claims against\r\nthe other, and the other has counter claims, clearly nothing can be more\r\nfair than that those claims should be courteously and honestly\r\nconsidered. It is quite absurd to suppose that the English Government\r\nand the Government at Washington can have a question about half a\r\nmillion of money which they cannot amicably settle. The noble Lord, I\r\nbelieve, thinks it is not a question for arbitration, but that it is a\r\nquestion of principle. Well, all questions of property almost are\r\nquestions of law, and you go to a lawyer and settle them if you can. In\r\nthis case it would be surely as easy to have the matter settled by some\r\nimpartial person as it was to ask the Senate or other authority at\r\nHamburg to settle a question between this country and the Empire of\r\nBrazil. Our most perfect security is, that as the war in America draws\r\nto a close--if it should happily soon draw to a close--we shall become\r\nmore generous to them, and their Government and people will probably\r\nbecome less irritated towards us. And when the passions have cooled\r\ndown, I am quite sure that Mr. Seward on that side and Earl Russell on\r\nthis, Mr. Adams here and Sir Frederick Bruce there, will be able,\r\nwithout much difficulty, to settle this, which is, after all, an\r\nunimportant matter, as a question of accounts between the two nations.\r\n\r\nI have only one more observation to make, and it is this--I suspect the\r\nroot of all the unfortunate circumstances that have occurred is the\r\nfeeling of jealousy which we have cherished with regard to the American\r\nnation. It was very much shown at the beginning of this war, when a\r\nMember whom I will not name, for I am sure his wish is that his name\r\nshould not be mentioned in connection with it now, spoke of the bursting\r\nof the bubble republic. I recollect that Lord John Russell, as he then\r\nwas speaking from that bench, turned round and rebuked him in language\r\nwhich was worthy of his name, and character, and position. I beg to tell\r\nthat Gentleman, and anybody else who talks about a bubble republic, that\r\nI have a strong suspicion he will see that a great many bubbles will\r\nburst before that. Why should we fear a great nation on the American\r\ncontinent? Some people fear that, should America become a great nation,\r\nshe will be arrogant and aggressive. It does not follow that it should\r\nbe so. The character of a nation does not depend altogether upon its\r\nsize, but upon the instruction, the civilization, and the morals of its\r\npeople. You fancy the supremacy of the sea will pass away from you; and\r\nthe noble Lord, who has had much experience, and is supposed to be wiser\r\non the subject than any other man in the House, will say that 'Rule\r\nBritannia' may become obsolete. Well, inasmuch as the supremacy of the\r\nseas means arrogance and the assumption of a dictatorial power on the\r\npart of this country, the sooner that becomes obsolete the better. I do\r\nnot believe that it is for the advantage of this country, or of any\r\ncountry in the world, that any one nation should pride itself upon what\r\nis termed the supremacy of the sea; and I hope the time is coming--I\r\nbelieve the hour is hastening--when we shall find that law and justice\r\nwill guide the councils and will direct the policy of the Christian\r\nnations of the world. Nature will not be baffled because we are jealous\r\nof the United States--the decrees of Providence will not be overthrown\r\nby aught we can do.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States is now not less than 35,000,000.\r\nWhen the next Parliament of England has lived to the age which this has\r\nlived to, that population will be 40,000,000, and you may calculate the\r\nincrease at the rate of rather more than 1,000,000 of persons per year.\r\nWho is to gainsay it? Will constant snarling at a great republic alter\r\nthis state of things, or swell us up in these islands to 40,000,000 or\r\n50,000,000, or bring them down to our 30,000,000? Hon. Members and the\r\ncountry at large should consider these facts, and learn from them that\r\nit is the interest of the nations to be at one--and for us to be in\r\nperfect courtesy and amity with the great English nation on the other\r\nside of the Atlantic. I am sure that the longer that nation exists the\r\nless will our people be disposed to sustain you in any needless\r\nhostility against them or jealousy of them. And I am the more convinced\r\nof this from what I have seen of the conduct of the people in the north\r\nof England during the last four years. I believe, on the other hand,\r\nthat the American people, when this excitement is over, will be willing,\r\nso far as aggressive acts against us are concerned, to bury in oblivion\r\ntransactions which have given them much pain, and that they will make\r\nthe allowance which they may fairly make, that the people of this\r\ncountry--even those high in rank and distinguished in culture--have had\r\na very inadequate knowledge of the real state of the events which have\r\ntaken place in that country since the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\nIt is on record that when the author of _The Decline and Fall of the\r\nRoman Empire_ was about to begin his great work, David Hurne wrote a\r\nletter to him urging him not to employ the French but the English\r\ntongue, 'because' he said, 'our establishments in America promise\r\nsuperior stability and duration to the English language.' How far that\r\npromise has been in part fulfilled we who are living now can see; but\r\nhow far it will be more largely and more completely fulfilled in after\r\ntimes we must leave after times to tell. I believe that in the centuries\r\nwhich are to come it will be the greatest pride and the highest renown\r\nof England that from her loins have sprung a hundred millions--it may be\r\ntwo hundred millions--of men who dwell and prosper on that continent\r\nwhich the grand old Genoese gave to Europe. Sir, if the sentiments which\r\nI have uttered shall become the sentiments of the Parliament and people\r\nof the United Kingdom--if the moderation which I have described shall\r\nmark the course of the Government and of the people of the United\r\nStates--then, notwithstanding some present irritation and some present\r\ndistrust--and I have faith both in us and in them--I believe that these\r\ntwo great commonwealths will march abreast, the parents and the\r\nguardians of freedom and justice, wheresoever their language shall be\r\nspoken and their power shall extend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE CANADIAN FORTIFICATIONS.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, MARCH 23, 1865.\r\nI shall ask the attention of the House for only a few moments. If the\r\nhon. Member (Mr. Bentinck) divides, I shall go into the same lobby with\r\nhim. I am afraid that, in making that announcement, I shall excite some\r\nlittle alarm in the mind of the hon. Gentleman. I wish therefore to say,\r\nthat I shall not in going into the lobby agree with him in many of the\r\nstatements he has made. The right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Disraeli) said,\r\nthat he approached the military question with great diffidence, and I\r\nwas very glad to see any signs of diffidence in that quarter. After that\r\nexplanation, he asked the House with a triumphant air whether there is\r\nany difficulty in defending a frontier of one thousand or fifteen\r\nhundred miles, and whether the practicability of doing so is a new\r\ndoctrine in warfare. But one thousand or fifteen hundred miles of\r\nfrontier to defend at the centre of your power, is one thing; but at\r\nthree thousand or four thousand miles from the centre, it is an entirely\r\ndifferent thing. I venture to say, that there is not a man in this\r\nHouse, or a sensible man out of it, who, apart from the consideration of\r\nthis vote, or some special circumstances attending it, believes that the\r\npeople of this country could attempt a successful defence of the\r\nfrontier of Canada against the whole power of the United States. I said\r\nthe other night, that I hoped we should not now talk folly, and\r\nhereafter, in the endeavour to be consistent, act folly. We all know\r\nperfectly well that we are talking folly when we say that the Government\r\nof this country would send either ships or men to make an effectual\r\ndefence of Canada against the power of the United States, supposing war\r\nto break out. Understand, I am not in the least a believer in the\r\nprobability of war, but I will discuss the question for one moment as if\r\nwar were possible. I suppose some men in this House think it probable.\r\nBut if it be possible or probable, and if you have to look this\r\ndifficulty in the face, there is no extrication from it but in the\r\nneutrality or independence of Canada.\r\n\r\nI agree with those Members who say that it is the duty of a great empire\r\nto defend every portion of it. I admit that as a general proposition,\r\nthough hon. Gentlemen opposite, and some on this side, do not apply that\r\nrule to the United States. But, admitting that rule, and supposing that\r\nwe are at all points unprepared for such a catastrophe, may we not, as\r\nreasonable men, look ahead, and try if it be not possible to escape from\r\nit? [An hon. Member: 'Run away?'] No, not by running away, though there\r\nare many circumstances in which brave men run away; and you may get into\r\ndifficulty on this Canadian question, which may make you look back and\r\nwish that you had run away a good time ago. I object to this vote on a\r\nground which, I believe, has not been raised by any Member in the\r\npresent discussion. I am not going to say that the expenditure of fifty\r\nthousand pounds is a matter of great consequence to this country, that\r\nthe expenditure of this money in the proposed way will be taken as a\r\nmenace by the United States. I do not think that this can be fairly\r\nsaid; for whether building fortifications at Quebec be useless or not,\r\nsuch a proceeding is not likely to enable the Canadians to overrun the\r\nState of New York. The United States, I think, will have no right to\r\ncomplain of this expenditure. The utmost it can do will be to show them\r\nthat some persons, and perhaps the Government of this country, have some\r\nlittle distrust of them, and so far it may do injury. I complain of the\r\nexpenditure and the policy announced by the Colonial Secretary, on a\r\nground which I thought ought to have been urged by the noble Lord the\r\nMember for Wick, who is a sort of half-Canadian. He made a speech which\r\nI listened to with great pleasure, and told the House what some of us,\r\nperhaps, did not know before; but if I had been connected, as he is,\r\nwith Canada, I would have addressed the House from a Canadian point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that the Member for Oxford says? He states, in reference to\r\nthe expenditure for the proposed fortifications, that, though a portion\r\nof the expenditure is to be borne by us, the main portion is to be borne\r\nby Canada; but I venture to tell him, that, if there shall be any\r\noccasion to defend Canada at all, it will not arise from anything Canada\r\ndoes, but from what England does; and therefore I protest against the\r\ndoctrine that the Cabinet in London may get into difficulties, and\r\nultimately into war, with the Cabinet at Washington; that because Canada\r\nlies adjacent to the United States, and may consequently become a great\r\nbattle-field, this United Kingdom has a right to call on Canada for the\r\nmain portion of that expenditure. Who has asked you to spend fifty\r\nthousand pounds, and the hundreds of thousands which may be supposed to\r\nfollow, but which perhaps Parliament may be indisposed hereafter to\r\ngrant? What is the proportion which Canada is to bear? If we are to\r\nspend two hundred thousand pounds at Quebec, is Canada to spend four\r\nhundred thousand pounds at Montreal? If Canada is to spend double\r\nwhatever we may spend, is it not obvious that every Canadian will ask\r\nhimself--what is the advantage of the connection between Canada and\r\nEngland?\r\n\r\nEvery Canadian knows perfectly well, and nobody better than the noble\r\nLord the Member for Wick, that there is no more prospect of a war\r\nbetween Canada and the United States alone, than between the Empire of\r\nFrance and the Isle of Man. If that is so, why should the Canadians be\r\ntaxed beyond all reason, as the Colonial Secretary proposes to tax them,\r\nfor a policy not Canadian, and for a calamity which, if ever it occurs,\r\nmust occur from some transactions between England and the United States?\r\nThere are Gentlemen here who know a good deal of Canada, and I see\r\nbehind me one who knows perfectly well what is the condition of the\r\nCanadian finances. We complain that Canada levies higher duties on\r\nBritish manufactures than the United States did before the present war,\r\nand much higher than France does. But when we complain to Canada of\r\nthis, and say it is very unpleasant usage from a part of our empire, the\r\nCanadians reply that their expenditure is so much, and their debt, with\r\nthe interest on it, so much, that they are obliged to levy these heavy\r\nduties. If the Canadian finances are in the unfortunate position\r\ndescribed; if the credit of Canada is not very good in the market of\r\nthis country; if you see what are the difficulties of the Canadians\r\nduring a period of peace; consider what will be their difficulties if\r\nthe doctrine of the Colonial Secretary be carried out, which is that\r\nwhatever expenditure is necessary for the defence of Canada, though we\r\nbear a portion, the main part must be borne by Canada.\r\n\r\nWe must then come to this inevitable conclusion. Every Canadian will\r\nsay, 'We are close alongside of a great nation; our parent state is\r\nthree thousand miles away; there are litigious, and there may be even\r\nwarlike, people in both nations, and they may occasion the calamity of a\r\ngreat war; we are peaceable people, having no foreign politics, happily;\r\nwe may be involved in war, and while the cities of Great Britain are not\r\ntouched by a single shell, nor one of its fields ravaged, there is not a\r\ncity or a village in this Canada in which we live which will not be\r\nliable to the ravages of war on the part of our powerful neighbour.'\r\nTherefore the Canadians will say, unless they are unlike all other\r\nEnglishmen (who appear to have more sense the farther they go from their\r\nown country), that it would be better for Canada to be disentangled from\r\nthe politics of England, and to assume the position of an independent\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nI suspect from what has been stated by official Gentlemen in the present\r\nGovernment and in previous Governments, that there is no objection to\r\nthe independence of Canada whenever Canada may wish it. I have been glad\r\nto hear those statements, because I think they mark an extraordinary\r\nprogress in sound opinions in this country. I recollect the noble Lord\r\nat the head of the Foreign Office on one occasion being very angry with\r\nme, he said I wished to make a great empire less; but a great empire,\r\nterritorially, may be lessened without its power and authority in the\r\nworld being diminished. I believe if Canada now, by a friendly\r\nseparation from this country, became an independent state, choosing its\r\nown form of government--monarchical, if it liked a monarchy, or\r\nrepublican, if it preferred a republic--it would not be less friendly to\r\nEngland, and its tariff would not be more adverse to our manufactures\r\nthan it is now. In the case of a war with America, Canada would then be\r\na neutral country; and the population would be in a state of greater\r\nsecurity. Not that I think there is any fear of war, but the Government\r\nadmit that it may occur by their attempt to obtain money for these\r\nfortifications. I object, therefore, to this vote, not on that account,\r\nnor even because it causes some distrust, or may cause it, in the United\r\nStates; but I object to it mainly because I think we are commencing a\r\npolicy which we shall either have to abandon, because Canada will not\r\nsubmit to it, or else which will bring upon Canada a burden in the shape\r\nof fortification expenditure that will make her more and more\r\ndissatisfied with this country, and that will lead rapidly to her\r\nseparation from us. I do not object to that separation in the least; I\r\nbelieve it would be better for us and better for her. But I think that,\r\nof all the misfortunes which could happen between us and Canada, this\r\nwould be the greatest, that her separation should take place after a\r\nperiod of irritation and estrangement, and that we should have on that\r\ncontinent to meet another element in some degree hostile to this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI am sorry, Sir, that the noble Lord at the head of the Government, and\r\nhis colleagues, have taken this course; but it appears to me to be\r\nwonderfully like almost everything which the Government does. It is a\r\nGovernment apparently of two parts, the one part pulling one way and the\r\nother part pulling another, and the result generally is something which\r\ndoes not please anybody, or produce any good effect in any direction.\r\nThey now propose a scheme which has just enough in it to create distrust\r\nand irritation, enough to make it in some degree injurious, and they do\r\nnot do enough to accomplish any of the objects for which, according to\r\ntheir statements, the proposition is made. Somebody asked the other\r\nnight whether the Administration was to rule, or the House of Commons.\r\nWell, I suspect from the course of the debates, that on this occasion\r\nthe Administration will be allowed to rule. We are accustomed to say\r\nthat the Government suggests a thing on its own responsibility, and\r\ntherefore we will allow them to do it. But the fact is, that the\r\nGovernment knows no more of this matter than any other dozen gentlemen\r\nin this House. They are not a bit more competent to form an opinion upon\r\nit. They throw it down on the table, and ask us to discuss and vote it.\r\n\r\nI should be happy to find the House, disregarding all the intimations\r\nthat war is likely, anxious not to urge Canada into incurring an\r\nexpenditure which she will not bear, and which, if she will not bear,\r\nmust end in one of two things--either in throwing the whole burden upon\r\nus, or in breaking up, perhaps suddenly and in anger, the connection\r\nbetween us and that colony, and in making our future relations with her\r\nmost unsatisfactory. I do not place much reliance on the speech of the\r\nright honourable Member for Buckinghamshire, not because he cannot judge\r\nof the question just as well as I or any one of us can do, but because I\r\nnotice that in matters of this kind Gentlemen on that (the Opposition)\r\nbench, whatever may have been their animosities towards the Gentlemen on\r\nthis (the Treasury) bench on other questions, shake hands. They may tell\r\nyou that they have no connection with the House over the way, but the\r\nfact is, their connection is most intimate. And if the right honourable\r\nMember for Buckinghamshire were now sitting on the Treasury bench, and\r\nthe noble Viscount were sitting opposite to him, the noble Viscount, I\r\nhave no doubt, would give him the very same support that he now receives\r\nfrom the right hon. Gentleman.\r\n\r\nThis seems to me a question so plain, so much on the surface, appealing\r\nso much to our common sense, having in it such great issues for the\r\nfuture, that I am persuaded it is the duty of the House of Commons on\r\nthis occasion to take the matter out of the hands of the executive\r\nGovernment, and to determine that, with regard to the future policy of\r\nCanada, we will not ourselves expend the money of the English tax-\r\npayers, and not force upon the tax-payers of Canada a burden which, I am\r\nsatisfied, they will not long continue to bear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CANADIAN CONFEDERATION SCHEME.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, FEBRUARY 28, 1867.\r\nAlthough this measure has not excited much interest in the House or in\r\nthe country, yet it appears to me to be of such very great importance\r\nthat it should be treated rather differently, or that the House should\r\nbe treated rather differently in respect to it. I have never before\r\nknown of any great measure affecting any large portion of the empire or\r\nits population which has been brought in and attempted to be hurried\r\nthrough Parliament in the manner in which this bill is being dealt with.\r\nEat the importance of it is much greater to the inhabitants of those\r\nprovinces than it is to us. It is on that account alone that it might be\r\nexpected we should examine it closely, and see that we commit no error\r\nin passing it.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman has not offered us, on one point, an\r\nexplanation which I think he will be bound to make. This bill does not\r\ninclude the whole of the British North American Provinces. I presume the\r\ntwo left out have been left out because it is quite clear they did not\r\nwish to come in. [Mr. Adderley: 'I am glad I can inform the hon.\r\nGentleman that they are, one of them at least, on the point of coming\r\nin.'] Yes; the reason of their being left out is because they were not\r\nwilling to come in. They may hereafter become willing, and if so the\r\nbill will admit them by a provision which appears reasonable. But the\r\nprovince of Nova Scotia is also unwilling to come in, and it is assumed\r\nthat because some time ago the Legislature of that province voted a\r\nresolution partly in favour of some such course, therefore the\r\npopulation is in favour of it.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I do not believe in the propriety or wisdom of the\r\nLegislature voting on a great question of this nature with reference to\r\nthe Legislature of Nova Scotia, if the people of Nova Scotia have never\r\nhad the question directly put to them. I have heard there is at present\r\nin London a petition complaining of the hasty proceeding of Parliament,\r\nand asking for delay, signed by 31,000 adult males of the province of\r\nNova Scotia, and that that petition is in reality signed by at least\r\nhalf of all the male inhabitants of that province. So far as I know, the\r\npetition does not protest absolutely against union, but against the\r\nmanner in which it is being carried out by this scheme and bill, and the\r\nhasty measures of the Colonial Office. Now, whether the scheme be a good\r\nor bad one, scarcely anything can be more foolish, looking to the\r\nfuture, than that any of the provinces should be dragged into it, either\r\nperforce, by the pressure of the Colonial Office, or by any hasty action\r\non the part of Parliament, in the hope of producing a result which\r\nprobably the populations of those provinces may not wish to see brought\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nI understand that the general election for the Legislature of Nova\r\nScotia, according to the constitution of that colony, will take place in\r\nthe month of May or June next; that this question has never been fairly\r\nplaced before the people of that province at an election, and that it\r\nhas never been discussed and decided by the people; and seeing that only\r\nthree months or not so much will elapse before there will be an\r\nopportunity of ascertaining the opinions of the population of Nova\r\nScotia, I think it is at least a hazardous proceeding to pass this bill\r\nthrough Parliament, binding Nova Scotia, until the clear opinion of that\r\nprovince has been ascertained. If, at a time like this, when you are\r\nproposing a union which we all hope is to last for ever, you create a\r\nlittle sore, it will in all probability become a great sore in a short\r\ntime, and it may be that the intentions of Parliament will be almost\r\nentirely frustrated by the haste with which this measure is being pushed\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I think, in\r\nthe early part of the evening, in answer to a question from this side,\r\nspoke of this matter as one of extreme urgency. Well, I cannot discover\r\nany urgency in the matter at all. What is urgent is this, that when done\r\nit ought to be done wisely, and with the full and free consent of all\r\nthose populations who are to be bound by this Act and interested in its\r\nresults. Unless the good-will of those populations is secured, in all\r\nprobability the Act itself will be a misfortune rather than a blessing\r\nto the provinces to which it refers.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman amused me in one part of his speech. He spoke\r\nof the filial piety--rather a curious term--of these provinces, and\r\ntheir great anxiety to make everything suit the ideas of this country;\r\nand this was said particularly with reference to the proposition for a\r\nSenate selected, not elected, for life, by the Governor-General of\r\nCanada. He said they were extremely anxious to follow as far as possible\r\nthe institutions of the mother country. I have not the smallest\r\nobjection to any people on the face of the earth following our\r\ninstitutions if they like them. Institutions which suit one country, as\r\nwe all know, are not very likely to suit every other country. With\r\nregard to this particular case, the right hon. Gentleman said it is to\r\nbe observed that Canada has had a nominated council, and has changed it\r\nfor an elected one, and that surely they had a right if they pleased to\r\ngo back from an elected council to a nominated council. Well, nobody\r\ndenies that, but nobody pretends that the people of Canada prefer a\r\nnominated council to an elected council. And all the wisdom of the wise\r\nmen to whom the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxford has referred\r\nin such glowing terms, unless the experience of present and past times\r\ngoes for nothing, is but folly if they have come to the conclusion that\r\na nominated council on that continent must be better than an elected\r\ncouncil. Still, if they wish it, I should not interfere and try to\r\nprevent it. But I venture to say that the clause enabling the Governor-\r\nGeneral and his Cabinet to put seventy men in that council for life\r\ninserts into the whole scheme the germ of a malady which will spread,\r\nand which before very long will require an alteration of this Act and of\r\nthe constitution of this new Confederation.\r\n\r\nBut the right hon. Gentleman went on to say that with regard to the\r\nrepresentative assembly--which, I suppose, is to be called according to\r\nhis phrase the House of Commons--they have adopted a very different\r\nplan. There they have not followed the course of this country. They have\r\nestablished their House of Representatives directly upon the basis of\r\npopulation. They have adopted the system which prevails in the United\r\nStates, which upon every ten years' summing up of the census in that\r\ncountry the number of members may be changed, and is by law changed in\r\nthe different States and districts as the rate of population may have\r\nchanged. Therefore, in that respect his friends in Canada have not\r\nadopted the principle which prevails in this country, but that which\r\nprevails in the United States. I believe they have done that which is\r\nright, and which they have a right to do, and which is inevitable there.\r\nI regret very much that they have not adopted another system with regard\r\nto their council or senate, because I am satisfied--I have not a\r\nparticle of doubt with regard to it that we run a great danger of making\r\nthis Act work ill almost from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThey have the example of thirty-six States in the United States, in\r\nwhich the Senate is elected, and no man, however sanguine, can hope that\r\nseventy-two stereotyped provincial peers in Canada will work\r\nharmoniously with a body elected upon a system so wide and so general as\r\nthat which prevails in the States of the American Union. There is one\r\npoint about which the right hon. Gentleman said nothing, and which I\r\nthink is so very important that the Member for Oxford, his predecessor\r\nin office, might have told us something about it. We know that Canada is\r\na great country, and we know that the population is, or very soon will\r\nbe, something like 4,000,000, and we may hope that, united under one\r\ngovernment, the province may be more capable of defence. But what is\r\nintended with regard to the question of defence? Is everything to be\r\ndone for the province? Is it intended to garrison its fortresses by\r\nEnglish troops? At the present moment there are, I believe, in the\r\nprovince 12,000 or 15,000 men.\r\n\r\nThere are persons in this country, and there are some also in the North\r\nAmerican provinces, who are ill-natured enough to say that not a little\r\nof the loyalty that is said to prevail in Canada has its price. I think\r\nit is natural and reasonable to hope that there is in that country a\r\nvery strong attachment to this country. But if they are to be constantly\r\napplying to us for guarantees for railways, and for grants for\r\nfortresses, and for works of defence, then I think it would be far\r\nbetter for them and for us--cheaper for us and less demoralising for\r\nthem--that they should become an independent State, and maintain their\r\nown fortresses, fight their own cause, and build up their own future\r\nwithout relying upon us. And when we know, as everybody knows, that the\r\npopulation of Canada is in a much better position as regards the\r\ncomforts of home, than is the great bulk of the population of this\r\ncountry, I say the time has come when it ought to be clearly understood\r\nthat the taxes of England are no longer to go across the ocean to defray\r\nexpenses of any kind within the Confederation which is about to be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman has never been an advocate for great\r\nexpenditure in the colonies by the mother country. On the contrary, he\r\nhas been one of the members of this House who have distinguished\r\nthemselves by what I will call an honest system for the mother country,\r\nand what I believe is a wise system for the colonies. But I think that\r\nwhen a measure of this kind is being passed, having such stupendous\r\nresults upon the condition and the future population of these great\r\ncolonies, we have a right to ask that there should be some consideration\r\nfor the revenue and for the taxpayers of this country. In discussing\r\nthis Bill with the delegates from the provinces, I think it was the duty\r\nof the Colonial Secretary to have gone fairly into this question, and,\r\nif possible, to have arranged it to the advantage of the colony and the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\nI believe there is no delusion greater than this--that there is any\r\nparty in the United States that wishes to commit any aggression upon\r\nCanada, or to annex Canada by force to the United States. There is not a\r\npart of the world, in my opinion, that runs less risk of aggression than\r\nCanada, except with regard to that foolish and impotent attempt of\r\ncertain discontented not-long-ago subjects of the Queen, who have left\r\nthis country. America has no idea of anything of the kind. No American\r\nstatesman, no American political party, dreams for a moment of an\r\naggression upon Canada, or of annexing Canada by force. And therefore,\r\nevery farthing that you spend on your fortresses, and all that you do\r\nwith the idea of shutting out American aggression, is money squandered\r\nthrough an hallucination which we ought to get rid of. I have not risen\r\nfor the purpose of objecting to the second reading of this Bill. Under\r\nthe circumstances, I presume it is well that we should do no other than\r\nread it a second time. But I think the Government ought to have given a\r\nlittle more time. I think they have not treated the province of Nova\r\nScotia with that tenderness, that generosity, and that consideration\r\nwhich is desirable when you are about to make so great a change in its\r\naffairs and in its future. For my share, I want the population of these\r\nprovinces to do that which they believe to be best for their own\r\ninterests--to remain with this country if they like it, in the most\r\nfriendly manner, or to become independent States if they wish it. If\r\nthey should prefer to unite themselves with the United States, I should\r\nnot complain even of that. But whatever be their course, there is no man\r\nin this House or in those provinces who has a more sincere wish for\r\ntheir greatness and their welfare than I have who have taken the liberty\r\nthus to criticise this Bill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTHE 'TRENT' AFFAIR.\r\n\r\nROCHDALE, DECEMBER 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n[During the excitement caused by the seizure of Messrs. Mason and\r\nSlidell, the envoys of the Slaveholders' Confederation, on board the\r\n_Trent_ steamer, Mr. Bright's townsmen invited him to a Public\r\nBanquet, that they might have the opportunity of hearing his opinions on\r\nthe American Civil War, and on the duty of England in regard to it. This\r\nspeech was delivered on the occasion of that Banquet.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Gentlemen who invited me to this dinner called upon me, I felt\r\ntheir kindness very sensibly, and now I am deeply grateful to my friends\r\naround me, and to you all, for the abundant manifestations of kindness\r\nwith which I have been received to-night. I am, as you all know,\r\nsurrounded at this moment by my neighbours and friends, and I may say\r\nwith the utmost truth, that I value the good opinions of those who now\r\nhear my voice far beyond the opinions of any equal number of the\r\ninhabitants of this country selected from any other portion of it. You\r\nhave, by this act of kindness that you have shown me, given proof that,\r\nin the main, you do not disapprove of my course and labours, that at\r\nleast you are willing to express an opinion that the motives by which I\r\nhave been actuated have been honest and honourable to myself, and that\r\nthat course has not been entirely without service to my country. Coming\r\nto this meeting, or to any similar meeting, I always find that the\r\nsubjects for discussion appear too many, and far more than it is\r\npossible to treat at length. In these times in which we live, by the\r\ninfluence of the telegraph, and the steamboat, and the railroad, and the\r\nmultiplication of newspapers, we seem continually to stand as on the top\r\nof an exceeding high mountain, from which we behold all the kingdoms of\r\nthe earth and all the glory of them,--unhappily, also, not only their\r\nglory, but their follies, and their crimes, and their calamities.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, our eyes were turned with anxious expectation to a\r\nremote corner of Europe, where five nations were contending in bloody\r\nstrife for an object which possibly hardly one of them comprehended,\r\nand, if they did comprehend it, which all sensible men amongst them must\r\nhave known to be absolutely impracticable. Four years ago, we were\r\nlooking still further to the East, where there was a gigantic revolt in\r\na great dependency of the British Crown, arising mainly from gross\r\nneglect, and from the incapacity of England, up to that moment, to\r\ngovern the country which it had known how to conquer. Two years ago, we\r\nlooked South, to the plains of Lombardy, and saw a great strife there,\r\nin which every man in England took a strong interest; and we have\r\nwelcomed, as the result of that strife, the addition of a great kingdom\r\nto the list of European States. Now, our eyes are turned in a contrary\r\ndirection, and we look to the West. There we see a struggle in progress\r\nof the very highest interest to England and to humanity at large. We see\r\nthere a nation which I shall call the Transatlantic English nation--the\r\ninheritor and partaker of all the historic glories of this country. We\r\nsee it torn with intestine broils, and suffering from calamities from\r\nwhich for more than a century past--in fact, for more than two centuries\r\npast--this country has been exempt. That struggle is of especial\r\ninterest to us. We remember the description which one of our great poets\r\ngives of Rome,--\r\n\r\n  'Lone mother of dead empires.'\r\n\r\nBut England is the living mother of great nations on the American and on\r\nthe Australian continents, which promise to endow the world with all her\r\nknowledge and all her civilization, and with even something more than\r\nthe freedom she herself enjoys.\r\n\r\nEighty-five years ago, at the time when some of our oldest townsmen were\r\nvery little children, there were, on the North American continent,\r\nColonies, mainly of Englishmen, containing about three millions of\r\nsouls. These Colonies we have seen a year ago constituting the United\r\nStates of North America, and comprising a population of no less than\r\nthirty millions of souls. We know that in agriculture and manufactures,\r\nwith the exception of this kingdom, there is no country in the world\r\nwhich in these arts may be placed in advance of the United States. With\r\nregard to inventions, I believe, within the last thirty years, we have\r\nreceived more useful inventions from the United States than from all the\r\nother countries of the earth. In that country there are probably ten\r\ntimes as many miles of telegraph as there are in this country, and there\r\nare at least five or six times as many miles of railway. The tonnage of\r\nits shipping is at least equal to ours, if it does not exceed ours. The\r\nprisons of that country--for, even in countries the most favoured,\r\nprisons are needful--have been models for other nations of the earth;\r\nand many European Governments have sent missions at different times to\r\ninquire into the admirable system of education so universally adopted in\r\ntheir free schools throughout the Northern States.\r\n\r\nIf I were to speak of that country in a religious aspect, I should say\r\nthat, considering the short space of time to which their history goes\r\nback, there is nothing on the face of the earth besides, and never has\r\nbeen, to equal the magnificent arrangement of churches and ministers,\r\nand of all the appliances which are thought necessary for a nation to\r\nteach Christianity and morality to its people. Besides all this, when I\r\nstate that for many years past the annual public expenditure of the\r\nGovernment of that country has been somewhere between 10,000,000_l_. and\r\n15,000,000_l_., I need not perhaps say further, that there has always\r\nexisted amongst all the population an amount of comfort and prosperity\r\nand abounding plenty such as I believe no other country in the world, in\r\nany age, has enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThis is a very fine, but a very true picture; yet it has another side to\r\nwhich I must advert. There has been one great feature in that country,\r\none great contrast, which has been pointed to by all who have commented\r\nupon the United States as a feature of danger, as a contrast calculated\r\nto give pain. There has been in that country the utmost liberty to the\r\nwhite man, and bondage and degradation to the black man. Now rely upon\r\nit, that wherever Christianity lives and flourishes, there must grow up\r\nfrom it, necessarily, a conscience hostile to any oppression and to any\r\nwrong; and therefore, from the hour when the United States Constitution\r\nwas formed, so long as it left there this great evil--then comparatively\r\nsmall, but now so great--it left there seeds of that which an American\r\nstatesman has so happily described, of that 'irrepressible conflict' of\r\nwhich now the whole world is the witness. It has been a common thing for\r\nmen disposed to carp at the United States to point to this blot upon\r\ntheir fair fame, and to compare it with the boasted declaration of\r\nfreedom in their Deed and Declaration of Independence. But we must\r\nrecollect who sowed this seed of trouble, and how and by whom it has\r\nbeen cherished.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling upon this stain any longer, I should like to read to\r\nyou a paragraph from the instructions understood to have been given to\r\nthe Virginian delegates to Congress, in the month of August, 1774., by\r\nMr. Jefferson, who was perhaps the ablest man the United States had\r\nproduced up to that time, and who was then actively engaged in its\r\naffairs, and who afterwards for two periods filled the office of\r\nPresident. He represented one of these very Slave States--the State of\r\nVirginia--and he says:--\r\n\r\n  'For the most trifling reasons, and sometimes for no conceivable\r\n  reason at all, his Majesty has rejected laws of the most salutary\r\n  tendency. The abolition of domestic slavery is the great object\r\n  of desire in those Colonies where it was unhappily introduced in\r\n  their infant state. But previous to the enfranchisement of the\r\n  slaves we have, it is necessary to exclude all further\r\n  importations from Africa. Yet our repeated attempts to effect\r\n  this by prohibition, and by imposing duties which might amount to\r\n  prohibition, have hitherto been defeated by his Majesty's\r\n  negative,--thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few\r\n  British corsairs to the lasting interests of the American States,\r\n  and to the rights of human nature, deeply wounded by this\r\n  infamous practice.'\r\n\r\nI read this merely to show that, two years before the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was signed, Mr. Jefferson, acting on behalf of those he\r\nrepresented in Virginia, wrote that protest against the course of the\r\nEnglish Government which prevented the Colonists from abolishing the\r\nslave trade, preparatory to the abolition of slavery itself.\r\n\r\nWell, the United States Constitution left the slave question for every\r\nState to manage for itself. It was a question too difficult to settle\r\nthen, and apparently every man had the hope and belief that in a few\r\nyears slavery itself would become extinct. Then there happened a great\r\nevent in the annals of manufactures and commerce. It was discovered that\r\nin those States that article which we in this country now so much depend\r\non, could be produced of the best quality necessary for manufacture, and\r\nat a moderate price. From that day to this the growth of cotton has\r\nincreased there, and its consumption has increased here, and a value\r\nwhich no man dreamed of when Jefferson wrote that paper has been given\r\nto the slave and to slave industry. Thus it has grown up to that\r\ngigantic institution which now threatens either its own overthrow or the\r\noverthrow of that which is a million times more valuable--the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nThe crisis at which we have arrived--I say 'we,' for, after all, we are\r\nnearly as much interested as if I was making this speech in the city of\r\nBoston or the city of New York--the crisis, I say, which has now\r\narrived, was inevitable. I say that the conscience of the North, never\r\nsatisfied with the institution of slavery, was constantly urging some\r\nmen forward to take a more extreme view of the question; and there grew\r\nup naturally a section--it may not have been a very numerous one--in\r\nfavour of the abolition of slavery. A great and powerful party resolved\r\nat least upon a restraint and a control of slavery, so that it should\r\nnot extend beyond the States and the area which it now occupies. But, if\r\nwe look at the Government of the United States almost ever since the\r\nformation of the Union, we shall find the Southern power has been mostly\r\ndominant there. If we take thirty-six years after the formation of the\r\npresent Constitution--I think about 1787--we shall find that for thirty-\r\ntwo of those years every President was a Southern man; and if we take\r\nthe period from 1828 until 1860, we shall find that, on every election\r\nfor President, the South voted in the majority.\r\n\r\nWe know what an election is in the United States for President of the\r\nRepublic. There is a most extensive suffrage, and there is the ballot-\r\nbox. The members of the House of Representatives are elected by the same\r\nsuffrage, and generally they are elected at the same time. It is thus\r\ntherefore almost inevitable that the House of Representatives is in\r\naccord in public policy with the President for the time being. Every\r\nfour years there springs from the vote created by the whole people a\r\nPresident over that great nation. I think the world offers no finer\r\nspectacle than this; it offers no higher dignity; and there is no\r\ngreater object of ambition on the political stage on which men are\r\npermitted to move. You may point, if you will, to hereditary rulers, to\r\ncrowns coming down through successive generations of the same family, to\r\nthrones based on prescription or on conquest, to sceptres wielded over\r\nveteran legions and subject realms,--but to my mind there is nothing so\r\nworthy of reverence and obedience, and nothing more sacred, than the\r\nauthority of the freely chosen by the majority of a great and free\r\npeople; and if there be on earth and amongst men any right divine to\r\ngovern, surely it rests with a ruler so chosen and so appointed.\r\n\r\nLast year the ceremony of this great election was gone through, and the\r\nSouth, which had been so long successful, found itself defeated. That\r\ndefeat was followed instantly by secession, and insurrection, and war.\r\nIn the multitude of articles which have been before us in the newspapers\r\nwithin the last few months, I have no doubt you have seen it stated, as\r\nI have seen it, that this question was very much like that upon which\r\nthe Colonies originally revolted against the Crown of England. It is\r\namazing how little some newspaper writers know, or how little they think\r\nyou know. When the War of Independence was begun in America, ninety\r\nyears ago, there were no representatives there at all. The question then\r\nwas, whether a Ministry in Downing-street, and a corrupt and borough-\r\nmongering Parliament, should continue to impose taxes upon three\r\nmillions of English subjects, who had left their native shores and\r\nestablished themselves in North America. But now the question is not the\r\nwant of representation, because, as is perfectly notorious, the South is\r\nnot only represented, but is represented in excess; for, in distributing\r\nthe number of representatives, which is done every ten years, three out\r\nof every five slaves are counted as freemen, and the number of\r\nrepresentatives from the Slave States is consequently so much greater\r\nthan if the freemen, the white men only, were counted. From this cause\r\nthe Southern States have twenty members more in the House of\r\nRepresentatives than they would have if the members were apportioned on\r\nthe same principle as in the Northern Free States. Therefore you will\r\nsee at once that there is no comparison between the state of things when\r\nthe Colonies revolted, and the state of things now, when this wicked\r\ninsurrection has broken out.\r\n\r\nThere is another cause which is sometimes in England assigned for this\r\ngreat misfortune, which is, the protective theories in operation in the\r\nUnion, and the maintenance of a high tariff. It happens with regard to\r\nthat, unfortunately, that no American, certainly no one I ever met with,\r\nattributed the disasters of the Union to that cause. It is an argument\r\nmade use of by ignorant Englishmen, but never by informed Americans. I\r\nhave already shown you that the South, during almost the whole existence\r\nof the Union, has been dominant at Washington; and during that period\r\nthe tariff has existed, and there has been no general dissatisfaction\r\nwith it. Occasionally, there can be no doubt, their tariff was higher\r\nthan was thought just, or reasonable, or necessary by some of the States\r\nof the South. But the first Act of the United States which levied duties\r\nupon imports, passed immediately after the Union was formed, recited\r\nthat 'It is necessary for the encouragement and protection of\r\nmanufactures to levy the duties which follow;' and during the war with\r\nEngland from 1812 to 1815, the people of the United States had to pay\r\nfor all the articles they brought from Europe many times over the\r\nnatural cost of those articles, on account of the interruption to the\r\ntraffic by the English nation.\r\n\r\nWhen the war was over, it was felt by everybody desirable that they\r\nshould encourage manufactures in their own country; and seeing that\r\nEngland at that precise moment was passing a law to prevent any wheat\r\ncoming from America until wheat in England had risen to the price of\r\n84_s_. per quarter, we may be quite satisfied that the doctrine of\r\nprotection originally entertained did not find less favour at the close\r\nof the war in 1815.\r\n\r\nThere is one remarkable point with regard to this matter which should\r\nnot be forgotten. Twelve months ago, at the meeting of the Congress of\r\nthe United States, on the first Monday in December--when the Congress\r\nmet, you recollect that there were various propositions of compromise,\r\ncommittee meetings of various kinds to try and devise some mode of\r\nsettling the question between the North and the South, so that disunion\r\nmight not go on--though I read carefully everything published in the\r\nEnglish papers from the United States on the subject, I do not recollect\r\nthat in a single instance the question of the tariff was referred to, or\r\nany change proposed or suggested in the matter as likely to have any\r\neffect whatever upon the question of Secession.\r\n\r\nThere is another point,--whatever might be the influence of the tariff\r\nupon the United States, it is as pernicious to the West as it is to the\r\nSouth; and further, that Louisiana, which is a Southern State and a\r\nseceded State, has always voted along with Pennsylvania until last year\r\nin favour of protection--protection for its sugar, whilst Pennsylvania\r\nwished protection for its coal and iron. But if the tariff was onerous\r\nand grievous, was that any reason for this great insurrection? Was there\r\never a country that had a tariff, especially in the article of food,\r\nmore onerous and more cruel than that which we had in this country\r\ntwenty years ago? We did not secede. We did not rebel. What we did was\r\nto raise money for the purpose of distributing among all the people\r\nperfect information upon the question; and many men, as you know,\r\ndevoted all their labours, for several years, to teach the great and\r\nwise doctrine of free trade to the people of England. The price of a\r\nsingle gunboat, the equipment of a single regiment, the garrisoning of a\r\nsingle fort, the cessation of their trade for a single day, cost more\r\nthan it would have cost to have spread among all the intelligent people\r\nof the United States the most complete statement of the whole case; and\r\nthe West and South could easily have revised, or, if need had been, have\r\nrepealed the tariff altogether.\r\n\r\nThe question is a very different and a far more grave question. It is a\r\nquestion of slavery, and for thirty years it has constantly been coming\r\nto the surface, disturbing social life, and overthrowing almost all\r\npolitical harmony in the working of the United States. In the North\r\nthere is no secession; there is no collision. These disturbances and\r\nthis insurrection are found wholly in the South and in the Slave States;\r\nand therefore I think that the man who says otherwise, who contends that\r\nit is the tariff, or anything whatsoever else than slavery, is either\r\nhimself deceived or endeavours to deceive others. The object of the\r\nSouth is this, to escape from the majority who wish to limit the area of\r\nslavery. They wish to found a Slave State freed from the influence and\r\nopinions of freedom. The Free States in the North now stand before the\r\nworld as the advocates and defenders of freedom and civilization. The\r\nSlave States offer themselves for the recognition of a Christian nation,\r\nbased upon the foundation, the unchangeable foundation in their eyes, of\r\nslavery and barbarism.\r\n\r\nI will not discuss the guilt of the men who, ministers of a great nation\r\nonly last year, conspired to overthrow it. I will not point out or\r\nrecapitulate the statements of the fraudulent manner in which they\r\ndisposed of the funds in the national exchequer. I will not point out by\r\nname any of the men, in this conspiracy, whom history will designate by\r\ntitles they would not like to hear; but I say that slavery has sought to\r\nbreak up the most free government in the world, and to found a new\r\nState, in the nineteenth century, whose corner-stone is the perpetual\r\nbondage of millions of men.\r\n\r\nHaving thus described what appears to me briefly the literal truth of\r\nthis matter, what is the course that England would be expected to\r\npursue? We should be neutral as far as regards mingling in the strife.\r\nWe were neutral in the strife in Italy; but we were not neutral in\r\nopinion or sympathy; and we know perfectly well that throughout the\r\nwhole of Italy at this moment there is a feeling that, though no shot\r\nwas fired from an English ship, and though no English soldier trod their\r\nsoil, yet still the opinion of England was potent in Europe, and did\r\nmuch for the creation of the Italian kingdom.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the United States, you know how much we hate slavery,--\r\nthat is, some years ago we thought we knew; that we have given twenty\r\nmillions sterling,--a million a year, or nearly so, of taxes for ever,--\r\nto free eight hundred thousand slaves in the English colonies. We knew,\r\nor thought we knew, how much we were in love with free government\r\neverywhere, although it might not take precisely the same form as our\r\nown government. We were for free government in Italy; we were for free\r\ngovernment in Switzerland; and we were for free government, even under a\r\nrepublican form, in the United States of America; and with all this,\r\nevery man would have said that England would wish the American Union to\r\nbe prosperous and eternal.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose we turn our eyes to the East, to the empire of Russia, for\r\na moment. In Russia, as you all know, there has been one of the most\r\nimportant and magnificent changes of policy ever seen in any country.\r\nWithin the last year or two, the present Emperor of Russia, following\r\nthe wishes of his father, has insisted upon the abolition of serfdom in\r\nthat empire; and twenty-three millions of human beings, lately serfs,\r\nlittle better than real slaves, have been raised to the ranks of\r\nfreedom. Now, suppose that the millions of the serfs of Russia had been\r\nchiefly in the South of Russia. We hear of the nobles of Russia, to whom\r\nthose serfs belonged in a great measure, that they have been hostile to\r\nthis change; and there has been some danger that the peace of that\r\nempire might be disturbed during the change. Suppose these nobles, for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining in perpetuity the serfdom of Russia, and\r\nbarring out twenty-three millions of your fellow-creatures from the\r\nrights of freedom, had established a great and secret conspiracy, and\r\nthat they had risen in great and dangerous insurrection against the\r\nRussian Government,--I say that you, the people of England, although\r\nseven years ago you were in mortal combat with the Russians in the South\r\nof Europe,--I believe at this moment you would have prayed Heaven in all\r\nsincerity and fervour to give strength to the arm and success to the\r\ngreat wishes of the Emperor, and that the vile and atrocious\r\ninsurrection might be suppressed.\r\n\r\nWell, but let us look a little at what has been said and clone in this\r\ncountry since the period when Parliament rose at the beginning of\r\nAugust. There have been two speeches to which I wish to refer, and in\r\nterms of approbation. The Duke of Argyll, a member of the present\r\nGovernment,--and, though I have not the smallest personal acquaintance\r\nwith him, I am free to say that I believe him to be one of the most\r\nintelligent and liberal of his order,--the Duke of Argyll made a speech\r\nwhich was fair and friendly to the Government of the United States. Lord\r\nStanley, only a fortnight ago, I think, made a speech which it is\r\nimpossible to read without remarking the thought, the liberality, and\r\nthe wisdom by which it is distinguished. He doubted, it is true, whether\r\nthe Union could be restored. A man need not be hostile, and must not\r\nnecessarily be unfriendly, to doubt that or the contrary; but he spoke\r\nwith fairness and friendliness of the Government of the United States;\r\nand he said that they were right and justifiable in the course they\r\ntook; and he gave us some advice,--which is now more important than at\r\nthe moment when it was given,--that amid the various incidents and\r\naccidents of a struggle of this nature, it became a people like this to\r\nbe very moderate, very calm, and to avoid, as much as possible, any\r\nfeeling of irritation, which sometimes arises, and sometimes leads to\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nI mention these two speeches as from Englishmen of great distinction in\r\nthis country--speeches which I believe will have a beneficial effect on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic. Lord John Russell, in the House of\r\nCommons, during the last session, made a speech also, in which he\r\nrebuked the impertinence of a young Member of the House who had spoken\r\nabout the bursting of the 'bubble republic.' It was a speech worthy of\r\nthe best days of Lord John Russell. But at a later period he spoke at\r\nNewcastle on an occasion something like this, when the inhabitants, or\r\nsome portion of the inhabitants, of the town invited him to a public\r\ndinner. He described the contest in words something like these--I speak\r\nfrom memory only: 'The North is contending for empire, the South for\r\nindependence.' Did he mean contending for empire, as England contends\r\nfor it when making some fresh conquest in India? If he meant that, what\r\nhe said was not true. But I recollect Lord John Russell, some years ago,\r\nin the House of Commons, on an occasion when I made some observation as\r\nto the unreasonable expenditure of our colonies, and said that the\r\npeople of England should not be taxed to defray expenses which the\r\ncolonies themselves were well able to bear, turned to me with a\r\nsharpness which was not necessary, and said, 'The honourable Member has\r\nno objection to make a great empire into a little one; but I have.'\r\nPerhaps if he had lived in the United States, if he was a member of the\r\nSenate or the House of Representatives there, he would doubt whether it\r\nwas his duty to consent at once to the destruction of a great country by\r\nseparation, it may be into two hostile camps, or whether he would not\r\ntry all the means which were open to him, and would be open to the\r\nGovernment, to avert so unlooked-for and so dire a calamity.\r\n\r\nThere are other speeches that have been made. I will not refer to them\r\nby any quotation,--I will not, out of pity to some of the men who\r\nuttered them. I will not bring their names even before you, to give\r\nthem an endurance which I hope they will not otherwise obtain. I leave\r\nthem in the obscurity which they so richly merit. But you know as well\r\nas I do, that, of all the speeches made since the end of the last\r\nsession of Parliament by public men, by politicians, the majority of\r\nthem have either displayed a strange ignorance of American affairs, or a\r\nstranger absence of that cordiality and friendship which, I maintain,\r\nour American kinsmen have a right to look for at our hands.\r\n\r\nAnd if we part from the speakers and turn to the writers, what do we\r\nfind there? We find that which is reputed abroad, and has hitherto been\r\nbelieved in at home, as the most powerful representative of English\r\nopinion--at least of the richer classes--we find in that particular\r\nnewspaper there has not been since Mr. Lincoln took office, in March\r\nlast, as President of the United States, one fair and honourable and\r\nfriendly article on American affairs. Some of you, I dare say, read it;\r\nbut, fortunately, every district is now so admirably supplied with local\r\nnewspapers, that I trust in all time to come the people of England will\r\ndrink of purer streams nearer home, and not of those streams which are\r\nmuddled by party feeling and political intrigue, and by many motives\r\nthat tend to anything rather than the enlightenment and advantage of the\r\npeople. It is said,--that very paper has said over and over again,--'Why\r\nthis war? Why not separate peaceably? Why this fratricidal strife ?' I\r\nhope it is equally averse to fratricidal strife in other districts; for\r\nif it be true that God made of one blood all the families of man to\r\ndwell on the face of all the earth, it must be fratricidal strife\r\nwhether we are slaughtering Russians in the Crimea or bombarding towns\r\non the sea-coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nNow no one will expect that I should stand forward as the advocate of\r\nwar, or as the defender of that great sum of all crimes which is\r\ninvolved in war. But when we are discussing a question of this nature,\r\nit is only fair that we should discuss it upon principles which are\r\nacknowledged not only in the country where the strife is being carried\r\non, but are universally acknowledged in this country. When I discussed\r\nthe Russian war, seven or eight years ago, I always condemned it, on\r\nprinciples which were accepted by the Government and people of England,\r\nand I took my facts from the blue-books presented to Parliament. I take\r\nthe liberty, then, of doing that in this case; and I say that, looking\r\nat the principles avowed in England, and at its policy, there is no man,\r\nwho is not absolutely a non-resistant in every sense, who can fairly\r\nchallenge the conduct of the American Government in this war. It would\r\nbe a curious thing to find that the party in this country which on every\r\npublic question affecting England is in favour of war at any cost, when\r\nthey come to speak of the duty of the Government of the United States,\r\nis in favour 'of peace at any price.'\r\n\r\nI want to know whether it has ever been admitted by politicians, or\r\nstatesmen, or people, that a great nation can be broken up at any time\r\nby any particular section of any part of that nation. It has been tried\r\noccasionally in Ireland, and if it had succeeded history would have said\r\nthat it was with very good cause. But if anybody tried now to get up a\r\nsecession or insurrection in Ireland,--and it would be infinitely less\r\ndisturbing to everything than the secession in the United States,\r\nbecause there is a boundary which nobody can dispute--I am quite sure\r\nthe _Times_ would have its 'Special Correspondent,' and would\r\ndescribe with all the glee and exultation in the world the manner in\r\nwhich the Irish insurrectionists were cut down and made an end of.\r\n\r\nLet any man try in this country to restore the heptarchy, do you think\r\nthat any portion of the people would think that the project could be\r\ntolerated for a moment? But if you look at a map of the United States,\r\nyou will see that there is no country in the world, probably, at this\r\nmoment, where any plan of separation between the North and the South, as\r\nfar as the question of boundary is concerned, is so surrounded with\r\ninsurmountable difficulties. For example, Maryland is a Slave State; but\r\nMaryland, by a large majority, voted for the Union. Kentucky is a Slave\r\nState, one of the finest in the Union, and containing a fine people;\r\nKentucky has voted for the Union, but has been invaded from the South.\r\nMissouri is a Slave State; but Missouri has not seceded, and has been\r\ninvaded by the South, and there is a secession party in that State.\r\nThere are parts of Virginia which have formed themselves into a new\r\nState, resolved to adhere to the North; and there is no doubt a\r\nconsiderable Northern and Union feeling in the State of Tennessee. I\r\nhave no doubt there is in every other State. In fact, I am not sure that\r\nthere is not now within the sound of my voice a citizen of the State of\r\nAlabama, who could tell you that in his State the question of secession\r\nhas never been put to the vote; and that there are great numbers of men,\r\nreasonable and thoughtful and just men, in that State, who entirely\r\ndeplore the condition of things there existing.\r\n\r\nThen, what would you do with all those States, and with what we may call\r\nthe loyal portion of the people of those States? Would you allow them to\r\nbe dragooned into this insurrection, and into the formation or the\r\nbecoming parts of a new State, to which they themselves are hostile? And\r\nwhat would you do with the City of Washington? Washington is in a Slave\r\nState. Would anybody have advised that President Lincoln and his\r\nCabinet, with all the members of Congress, of the House of\r\nRepresentatives and the Senate, from the North, with their wives and\r\nchildren, and everybody else who was not positively in favour of the\r\nSouth, should have set off on their melancholy pilgrimage northwards,\r\nleaving that capital, hallowed to them by such associations,--having its\r\nname even from the father of their country,--leaving Washington to the\r\nSouth, because Washington is situated in a Slave State?\r\n\r\nAgain, what do you say to the Mississippi River, as you see it upon the\r\nmap, the 'father of waters,' rolling its gigantic stream to the ocean?\r\nDo you think that the fifty millions which one day will occupy the banks\r\nof that river northward, will ever consent that its great stream shall\r\nroll through a foreign, and it may be a hostile State? And more, there\r\nare four millions of negroes in subjection. For them the American Union\r\nis directly responsible. They are not secessionists; they are now, as\r\nthey always were, not citizens nor subjects, but legally under the care\r\nand power of the Government of the United States. Would you consent that\r\nthese should be delivered up to the tender mercies of their taskmasters,\r\nthe defenders of slavery as an everlasting institution?\r\n\r\nBut if all had been surrendered without a struggle, what then? What\r\nwould the writers in this newspaper and other newspapers have said? If a\r\nbare rock in your empire, that would not keep a goat--a single goat--\r\nalive, be touched by any foreign power, the whole empire is roused to\r\nresistance; and if there be, from accident or passion, the smallest\r\ninsult to your flag, what do your newspaper writers say upon the\r\nsubject, and what is said in all your towns and upon all your Exchanges?\r\nI will tell you what they would have said if the Government of the\r\nNorthern States had taken their insidious and dishonest advice. They\r\nwould have said the great Republic was a failure, that democracy had\r\nmurdered patriotism, that history afforded no example of such meanness\r\nand of such cowardice; and they would have heaped unmeasured obloquy and\r\ncontempt upon the people and Government who had taken that course.\r\n\r\nThey tell you, these candid friends of the United States,--they tell you\r\nthat all freedom is gone; that the Habeas Corpus Act, if they ever had\r\none, is known no longer; and that any man may be arrested at the dictum\r\nof the President or of the Secretary of State. Well, but in 1848 you\r\nrecollect, many of you, that there was a small insurrection in Ireland.\r\nIt was an absurd thing altogether; but what was done then? I saw, in one\r\nnight, in the House of Commons, a bill for the suspension of the Habeas\r\nCorpus Act passed through all its stages. What more did I see? I saw a\r\nbill brought in by the Whig Government of that day, Lord John Hussell\r\nbeing the Premier, which made speaking against the Government and\r\nagainst the Crown--which up to that time had been sedition--which\r\nproposed to make it felony; and it was only by the greatest exertions of\r\na few of the Members that the Act, in that particular, was limited to a\r\nperiod of two years. In the same session a bill was brought in called an\r\nAlien Bill, which enabled the Home Secretary to take any foreigner\r\nwhatsoever, not being a naturalized Englishman, and in twenty-four hours\r\nto send him out of the country. Although a man might have committed no\r\ncrime, this might be done to him, apparently only on suspicion.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that an insurgent army had been so near to London that you\r\ncould see its outposts from every suburb of your Capital, what then do\r\nyou think would have been the regard of the Government of Great Britain\r\nfor personal liberty, if it interfered with the necessities, and, as\r\nthey might think, the salvation of the State? I recollect, in 1848, when\r\nthe Habeas Corpus Act was suspended in Ireland, that a number of persons\r\nin Liverpool, men there of position and of wealth, presented a petition\r\nto the House of Commons, praying--what? That the Habeas Corpus Act\r\nshould not be suspended? No. They were not content with its suspension\r\nin Ireland; and they prayed the House of Commons to extend that\r\nsuspension to Liverpool. I recollect that at that time--and I am sure my\r\nfriend Mr. Wilson will bear me out in what I say--the Mayor of Liverpool\r\ntelegraphed to the Mayor of Manchester, and that messages were sent on\r\nto London nearly every hour. The Mayor of Manchester heard from the\r\nMayor of Liverpool that certain Irishmen in Liverpool, conspirators, or\r\nfellow-conspirators with those in Ireland, were going to burn the cotton\r\nwarehouses in Liverpool and the cotton mills of Lancashire. I read that\r\npetition from Liverpool. I took it from the table of the House of\r\nCommons, and read it, and I handed it over to a statesman of great\r\neminence, who has been but just removed from us--I refer to Sir James\r\nGraham, a man not second to any in the House of Commons for his\r\nknowledge of affairs and for his great capacity--I handed to him that\r\npetition. He read it; and after he had read it, he rose from his seat,\r\nand laid it upon the table with a gesture of abhorrence and disgust. Now\r\nthat was a petition from the town of Liverpool, in which some persons\r\nhave been making themselves very ridiculous of late by reason of their\r\nconduct on this American question.\r\n\r\nThere is one more point. It has been said, 'How much better it would\r\nbe'--not for the United States, but--'for us, that these States should\r\nbe divided.' I recollect meeting a gentleman in Bond-street one day\r\nbefore the session was over. He was a rich man, and one whose voice is\r\nmuch heard in the House of Commons; but his voice is not heard when he\r\nis on his legs, but when he is cheering other speakers; and he said to\r\nme: 'After all, this is a sad business about the United States; but\r\nstill I think it very much better that they should be split up. In\r\ntwenty years,' or in fifty years, I forget which it was, 'they will be\r\nso powerful that they will bully all Europe.' And a distinguished Member\r\nof the House of Commons--distinguished there by his eloquence,\r\ndistinguished more by his many writings--I mean Sir Edward Bulwer\r\nLytton--he did not exactly express a hope, but he ventured on something\r\nlike a prediction, that the time would come when there would be, I do\r\nnot know how many, but about as many independent States on the American\r\nContinent as you can count upon your fingers.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a meaner motive than this I am speaking of, in forming a\r\njudgment on this question,--that it is 'better for us'--for whom? the\r\npeople of England, or the Government of England?--that the United States\r\nshould be severed, and that the North American continent should be as\r\nthe continent of Europe is, in many States, and subject to all the\r\ncontentions and disasters which have accompanied the history of the\r\nStates of Europe. I should say that, if a man had a great heart within\r\nhim, he would rather look forward to the day when, from that point of\r\nland which is habitable nearest to the Pole, to the shores of the Great\r\nGulf, the whole of that vast continent might become one great\r\nconfederation of States,--without a great army, and without a great\r\nnavy,--not mixing itself up with the entanglements of European\r\npolitics,--without a custom-house inside, through the whole length and\r\nbreadth of its territory,--and with freedom everywhere, equality\r\neverywhere, law everywhere, peace everywhere,--such a confederation\r\nwould afford at least some hope that man is not forsaken of Heaven, and\r\nthat the future of our race may be better than the past.\r\n\r\nIt is a common observation, that our friends in America are very\r\nirritable. And I think it is very likely, of a considerable number of\r\nthem, to be quite true. Our friends in America are involved in a great\r\nstruggle. There is nothing like it before in their or in any history. No\r\ncountry in the world was ever more entitled, in my opinion, to the\r\nsympathy and the forbearance of all friendly nations, than are the\r\nUnited States at this moment. They have there some newspapers that are\r\nno wiser than ours. They have there some papers, which, up to the\r\nelection of Mr. Lincoln, were his bitterest and most unrelenting foes,\r\nwho, when the war broke out, and it was not safe to take the line of\r\nSouthern support, were obliged to turn round and to appear to support\r\nthe prevalent opinion of the country. But they undertook to serve the\r\nSouth in another way, and that was by exaggerating every difficulty and\r\nmisstating every fact, if so doing could serve their object of creating\r\ndistrust between the people of the Northern States and the people of\r\nthis United Kingdom. If the _Times_ in this country has done all\r\nthat it could do to poison the minds of the people of England, and to\r\nirritate the minds of the people of America, the _New York Herald_,\r\nI am sorry to say, has done, I think, all that it could, or all that it\r\ndared to do, to provoke mischief between the Government in Washington\r\nand the Government in London.\r\n\r\nNow there is one thing which I must state that I think they have a solid\r\nreason to complain of; and I am very sorry to have to mention it,\r\nbecause it blames our present Foreign Minister, against whom I am not\r\nanxious to say a word, and, recollecting his speech in the House of\r\nCommons, I should be slow to conclude that he had any feeling hostile to\r\nthe United States Government. You recollect that during the session--it\r\nwas on the 14th of May--a Proclamation came out which acknowledged the\r\nSouth as a belligerent power, and proclaimed the neutrality of England.\r\nA little time before that, I forget how many days, Mr. Dallas, the late\r\nMinister from the United States, had left London for Liverpool and\r\nAmerica. He did not wish to undertake any affairs for his Government, by\r\nwhich he was not appointed,--I mean that of President Lincoln,--and he\r\nleft what had to be done to his successor, who was on his way, and whose\r\narrival was daily expected. Mr. Adams, the present Minister from the\r\nUnited States, is a man whom, if he lived in England, you would speak of\r\nas belonging to one of the noblest families of the country. His father\r\nand his grandfather were Presidents of the United States. His\r\ngrandfather was one of the great men who achieved the independence of\r\nthe United States. There is no family in that country having more claims\r\nupon what I should call the veneration and the affection of the people\r\nthan the family of Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams came to this country. He arrived in London on the night of the\r\n13th of May. On the 14th, that Proclamation was issued. It was known\r\nthat he was coming; but he was not consulted; the Proclamation was not\r\ndelayed for a day, although there was nothing pressing, no reason why\r\nthe Proclamation should not have been notified to him. If communications\r\nof a friendly nature had taken place with him and with the American\r\nGovernment, they could have found no fault with this step, because it\r\nwas perhaps inevitable, before the struggle had proceeded far, that this\r\nProclamation would be issued. But I have the best reasons for knowing\r\nthat there is no single thing that has happened during the course of\r\nthese events which has created more surprise, more irritation, and more\r\ndistrust in the United States, with respect to this country, than the\r\nfact that that Proclamation was not delayed one single day, until the\r\nMinister from America could come here, and until it could be done, if\r\nnot with his consent, or his concurrence, yet in that friendly manner\r\nthat would probably have avoided all the unpleasantness which has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nNow I am obliged to say--and I say it with the utmost pain--that if we\r\nhave not done things that are plainly hostile to the North, and if we\r\nhave not expressed affection for slavery, and, outwardly and openly,\r\nhatred for the Union,--I say that there has not been that friendly and\r\ncordial neutrality which, if I had been a citizen of the United States,\r\nI should have expected; and I say further, that, if there has existed\r\nconsiderable irritation at that, it must be taken as a measure of the\r\nhigh appreciation which the people of those States place upon the\r\nopinion of the people of England. If I had been addressing this audience\r\nten days ago, so far as I know, I should have said just what I have said\r\nnow; and although, by an untoward event, circumstances are somewhat,\r\neven considerably, altered, yet I have thought it desirable to make this\r\nstatement, with a view, so far as I am able to do it, to improve the\r\nopinion of England, and to assuage feelings of irritation in America, if\r\nthere be any, so that no further difficulties may arise in the progress\r\nof this unhappy strife.\r\n\r\nBut there has occurred an event which was announced to us only a week\r\nago, which is one of great importance, and it may be one of some peril.\r\nIt is asserted that what is called 'international law' has been broken\r\nby the seizure of the Southern Commissioners on board an English trading\r\nsteamer by a steamer of war of the United States. Now, what is\r\ninternational law? You have heard that the opinions of the law officers\r\nof the Crown are in favour of this view of the case--that the law has\r\nbeen broken. I am not at all going to say that it has not. It would be\r\nimprudent in me to set my opinion on a legal question which I have only\r\npartially examined, against their opinion on the same question, which I\r\npresume they have carefully examined. But this I say, that international\r\nlaw is not to be found in an Act of Parliament--it is not in so many\r\nclauses. You know that it is difficult to find the law. I can ask the\r\nMayor, or any magistrate around me, whether it is not very difficult to\r\nfind the law, even when you have found the Act of Parliament, and found\r\nthe clause. But when you have no Act of Parliament, and no clause, you\r\nmay imagine that the case is still more difficult.\r\n\r\nNow, maritime law, or international law, consists of opinions and\r\nprecedents for the most part, and it is very unsettled. The opinions are\r\nthe opinions of men of different countries, given at different times;\r\nand the precedents are not always like each other. The law is very\r\nunsettled, and, for the most part, I believe it to be exceedingly bad.\r\nIn past times, as you know from the histories you read, this country has\r\nbeen a fighting country; we have been belligerents, and, as\r\nbelligerents, we have carried maritime law, by our own powerful hand, to\r\na pitch that has been very oppressive to foreign, and especially so to\r\nneutral nations. Well, now, for the first time, unhappily,--almost for\r\nthe first time in our history for the last two hundred years,--we are\r\nnot belligerents, but neutrals; and we are disposed to take, perhaps,\r\nrather a different view of maritime and international law.\r\n\r\nNow, the act which has been committed by the American steamer, in my\r\nopinion, whether it was legal or not, was both impolitic and bad. That\r\nis my opinion. I think it may turn out, almost certainly, that, so far\r\nas the taking of those men from that ship was concerned, it was an act\r\nwholly unknown to, and unauthorized by, the American Government. And if\r\nthe American Government believe, on the opinion of their law officers,\r\nthat the act is illegal, I have no doubt they will make fitting\r\nreparation; for there is no Government in the world that has so\r\nstrenuously insisted upon modifications of international law, and been\r\nso anxious to be guided always by the most moderate and merciful\r\ninterpretation of that law.\r\n\r\nNow, our great advisers of the _Times_ newspaper have been\r\npersuading people that this is merely one of a series of acts which\r\ndenote the determination of the Washington Government to pick a quarrel\r\nwith the people of England. Did you ever know anybody who was not very\r\nnearly dead drunk, who, having as much upon his hands as he could\r\nmanage, would offer to fight everybody about him? Do you believe that\r\nthe United States Government, presided over by President Lincoln, so\r\nconstitutional in all his acts, so moderate as he has been--representing\r\nat this moment that great party in the United States, happily now in the\r\nascendancy, which has always been especially in favour of peace, and\r\nespecially friendly to England--do you believe that such a Government,\r\nhaving now upon its hands an insurrection of the most formidable\r\ncharacter in the South, would invite the armies and the fleets of\r\nEngland to combine with that insurrection, and, it might be, to render\r\nit impossible that the Union should ever again be restored? I say, that\r\nsingle statement, whether it came from a public writer or a public\r\nspeaker, is enough to stamp him for ever with the character of being an\r\ninsidious enemy of both countries.\r\n\r\nWell, now, what have we seen during the last week? People have not been,\r\nI am told--I have not seen much of it--quite as calm as sensible men\r\nshould be. Here is a question of law. I will undertake to say, that when\r\nyou have from the United States Government--if they think the act legal--\r\na statement of their view of the case, they will show you that, fifty\r\nor sixty years ago, during the wars of that time, there were scores of\r\ncases that were at least as bad as this, and some infinitely worse. And\r\nif it were not so late to-night--and I am not anxious now to go into the\r\nquestion further--I could easily place before you cases of extreme\r\noutrage committed by us when we were at war, and for many of which, I am\r\nafraid, little or no reparation was offered. But let us bear this in\r\nmind, that during this struggle incidents and accidents will happen.\r\nBear in mind the advice of Lord Stanley, so opportune and so judicious.\r\nDo not let your newspapers, or your public speakers, or any man, take\r\nyou off your guard, and bring you into that frame of mind under which\r\nyour Government, if it desires war, may be driven to engage in it; for\r\none may be almost as fatal and as evil as the other.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more monstrous than that we, as we call ourselves, to some\r\nextent, an educated, a moral, and a Christian nation--at a moment when\r\nan accident of this kind occurs, before we have made a representation to\r\nthe American Government, before we have heard a word from it in reply--\r\nshould be all up in arms, every sword leaping from its scabbard, and\r\nevery man looking about for his pistols and his blunderbusses? I think\r\nthe conduct pursued--and I have no doubt just the same is pursued by a\r\ncertain class in America--is much more the conduct of savages than of\r\nChristian and civilized men. No, let us be calm. You recollect how we\r\nwere dragged into the Russian war--how we 'drifted' into it. You know\r\nthat I, at least, have not upon my head any of the guilt of that fearful\r\nwar. You know that it cost one hundred millions of money to this\r\ncountry; that it cost at least the lives of forty thousand Englishmen;\r\nthat it disturbed your trade; that it nearly doubled the armies of\r\nEurope; that it placed the relations of Europe on a much less peaceful\r\nfooting than before; and that it did not effect one single thing of all\r\nthose that it was promised to effect.\r\n\r\nI recollect speaking on this subject, within the last two years, to a\r\nman whose name I have already mentioned, Sir James Graham, in the House\r\nof Commons. He was a Minister at the time of that war. He was reminding\r\nme of a severe onslaught which I had made upon him and Lord Palmerston\r\nfor attending a dinner at the Reform Club when Sir Charles Napier was\r\nappointed to the command of the Baltic fleet; and he remarked, 'What a\r\nsevere thrashing' I had given them in the House of Commons! I said, 'Sir\r\nJames, tell me candidly, did you not deserve it?' He said, 'Well, you\r\nwere entirely right about that war; we were entirely wrong, and we never\r\nshould have gone into it.' And this is exactly what everybody will say,\r\nif you go into a war about this business, when it is over. When your\r\nsailors and soldiers, so many of them as may be slaughtered, are gone to\r\ntheir last account; when your taxes are increased, your business\r\npermanently--it may be--injured; and when embittered feelings for\r\ngenerations have been created between America and England--then your\r\nstatesmen will tell you that f we ought not to have gone into the war.'\r\n\r\nBut they will very likely say, as many of them tell me, 'What could we\r\ndo in the frenzy of the public mind?' Let them not add to the frenzy,\r\nand let us be careful that nobody drives us into that frenzy.\r\nRemembering the past, remembering at this moment the perils of a\r\nfriendly people, and seeing the difficulties by which they are\r\nsurrounded, let us, I entreat of you, see if there be any real\r\nmoderation in the people of England, and if magnanimity, so often to be\r\nfound amongst individuals, is absolutely wanting in a great nation.\r\n\r\nNow, Government may discuss this matter--they may arrange it--they may\r\narbitrate it. I have received here, since I came into the room, a\r\ndespatch from a friend of mine in London, referring to this matter. I\r\nbelieve some portion of it is in the papers this evening, but I have not\r\nseen them. He states that General Scott, whom you know by name, who has\r\ncome over from America to France, being in a bad state of health--the\r\nGeneral lately of the American army, and a man whose reputation in that\r\ncountry is hardly second to that which the Duke of Wellington held\r\nduring his lifetime in this country--General Scott has written a letter\r\non the American difficulty. He denies that the Cabinet of Washington had\r\nordered the seizure of the Southern Commissioners, if found under a\r\nneutral flag. The question of legal right involved in the seizure, the\r\nGeneral thinks a very narrow ground on which to force a quarrel with the\r\nUnited States. As to Messrs. Slidell and Mason being or not being\r\ncontraband, the General answers for it, that, if Mr. Seward cannot\r\nconvince Earl Russell that they bore that character, Earl Russell will\r\nbe able to convince Mr. Seward that they did not. He pledges himself\r\nthat, if this Government cordially agreed with that of the United States\r\nin establishing the immunity of neutrals from the oppressive right of\r\nsearch and seizure on suspicion, the Cabinet of Washington will not\r\nhesitate to purchase so great a boon to peaceful trading-vessels.\r\n\r\nNow, then, before I sit down, let me ask you what is this people, about\r\nwhich so many men in England at this moment are writing, and speaking,\r\nand thinking, with harshness, I think with injustice, if not with great\r\nbitterness? Two centuries ago, multitudes of the people of this country\r\nfound a refuge on the North American continent, escaping from the\r\ntyranny of the Stuarts and from the bigotry of Laud. Many noble spirits\r\nfrom our country made great experiments in favour of human freedom on\r\nthat continent. Bancroft, the great historian of his own country, has\r\nsaid, in his own graphic and emphatic language, 'The history of the\r\ncolonization of America is the history of the crimes of Europe.' From\r\nthat time down to our own period, America has admitted the wanderers\r\nfrom every clime. Since 1815, a time which many here remember, and which\r\nis within my lifetime, more than three millions of persons have\r\nemigrated from the United Kingdom to the United States. During the\r\nfifteen years from 1845 or 1846 to 1859 or 1860--a period so recent that\r\nwe all remember the most trivial circumstances that have happened in\r\nthat time--during those fifteen years more than two million three\r\nhundred and twenty thousand persons left the shores of the United\r\nKingdom as emigrants for the States of North America.\r\n\r\nAt this very moment, then, there are millions in the United States who\r\npersonally, or whose immediate parents, have at one time been citizens\r\nof this country. They found a home in the Far West; they subdued the\r\nwilderness; they met with plenty there, which was not afforded them in\r\ntheir native country; and they have become a great people. There may be\r\npersons in England who are jealous of those States. There may be men who\r\ndislike democracy, and who hate a republic; there may be even those\r\nwhose sympathies warm towards the slave oligarchy of the South. But of\r\nthis I am certain, that only misrepresentation the most gross or calumny\r\nthe most wicked can sever the tie which unites the great mass of the\r\npeople of this country with their friends and brethren beyond the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nNow, whether the Union will be restored or not, or the South achieve an\r\nunhonoured independence or not, I know not, and I predict not. But this\r\nI think I know--that in a few years, a very few years, the twenty\r\nmillions of freemen in the North will be thirty millions, or even fifty\r\nmillions--a population equal to or exceeding that of this kingdom. When\r\nthat time comes, I pray that it may not be said amongst them, that, in\r\nthe darkest hour of their country's trials, England, the land of their\r\nfathers, looked on with icy coldness and saw unmoved the perils and\r\ncalamities of their children. As for me, I have but this to say: I am\r\nbut one in this audience, and but one in the citizenship of this\r\ncountry; but if all other tongues are silent mine shall speak for that\r\npolicy which gives hope to the bondsmen of the South, and which tends to\r\ngenerous thoughts, and generous words, and generous deeds, between the\r\ntwo great nations who speak the English language, and from their origin\r\nare alike entitled to the English name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AND THE SUPPLY OF COTTON.\r\nBIRMINGHAM, DECEMBER 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nI am afraid there was a little excitement during a part of my honourable\r\nColleague's speech, which was hardly favourable to that impartial\r\nconsideration to which he appealed. He began by referring to a question--\r\nor, I might say, to two questions, for it was one great question in two\r\nparts,--which at this moment occupies the mind, and, I think, must\r\nafflict the heart of every thoughtful man in this country--the calamity\r\nwhich has fallen upon the county from which I come, and the strife which\r\nis astonishing the world on the other side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into details with regard to that calamity, because you\r\nhave had already, I believe, meetings in this town, many details have\r\nbeen published, contributions of a generous character have been made,\r\nand you are doing--and especially, if I am rightly informed, are your\r\nartisans doing--their duty with regard to the unfortunate condition of\r\nthe population amongst which I live. But this I may state in a sentence,\r\nthat the greatest, probably the most prosperous, manufacturing industry\r\nthat this country or the world has ever seen, has been suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly stricken down, but by a blow which had not been unforeseen\r\nor unforetold. Nearly five hundred thousand persons--men, women, and\r\nchildren--at this moment are saved from the utmost extremes of famine,\r\nnot a few of them from death, by the contributions which they are\r\nreceiving from all parts of the country. I will not attempt here an\r\nelaborate eulogy of the generosity of the givers, nor will I endeavour\r\nto paint the patience and the gratitude of those who suffer and receive;\r\nbut I believe the conduct of the country, with regard to this great\r\nmisfortune, is an honour to all classes and to every section of this\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSome have remarked that there is perfect order where there has been so\r\nmuch anxiety and suffering. I believe there is scarcely a thoughtful man\r\nin Lancashire who will not admit that one great cause of the patience\r\nand good conduct of the people, besides the fact that they know so much\r\nis being done for them, is to be found in the extensive information they\r\npossess, and which of late years, and now more than ever, has been\r\ncommunicated to them through the instrumentality of an untaxed press.\r\nNoble Lords who have recently spoken, official men, and public men, have\r\ntaken upon them to tell the people of Lancashire that nobody has done\r\nwrong, and that, in point of fact, if it had not been for a family\r\nquarrel in that dreadful Republic, everything would have gone on\r\nsmoothly, and that nobody can be blamed for our present sufferings.\r\n\r\nNow, if you will allow me, I should like to examine for a few minutes\r\nwhether this be true. If you read the papers with regard to this\r\nquestion, you will find that, barring whatever chance there may be of\r\nour again soon receiving a supply of cotton from America, the hopes of\r\nthe whole country are directed to India. Our Government of India is not\r\none of to-day. It is a Government that has lasted as long as the\r\nGovernment of the United States, and it has had far more insurrections\r\nand secessions, not one of which, I suppose some in this meeting must\r\nregret, has been tolerated by our Government or recognised by France.\r\nOur Government in India has existed for a hundred years in some portion\r\nof the country where cotton is a staple produce of the land. But we have\r\nhad under the name of a Government what I have always described as a\r\npiratical joint-stock company, beginning with Lord Clive, and ending, as\r\nI now hope it has ended, with Lord Dalhousie. And under that Government\r\nI will undertake to say that it was not in nature that you could have\r\nsuch improvement as should ever give you a fair supply of cotton.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1814, the whole trade of India was a monopoly of the East\r\nIndia Company. They took everything there that went there; they brought\r\neverything back that came here; they did whatsoever they pleased in the\r\nterritories under their rule. I have here an extract from a report of a\r\nMember of Council in India, Mr. Richards, published in the year 1813. He\r\nreports to the Court of Directors, that the whole cotton produce of the\r\ndistrict was taken, without leaving any portion of the avowed share of\r\nthe Ryots, that is, the cultivators, at their own free disposal; and he\r\nsays that they are not suffered to know what they shall get for it until\r\nafter it has been far removed from their reach and from the country by\r\nexportation coastwise to Bombay; and he says further, that the Company's\r\nservants fixed the prices from ten to thirty per cent, under the general\r\nmarket rate in the districts that were not under the Company's rule.\r\nDuring the three years before the Company's monopoly was abolished, in\r\n1814, the whole cotton that we received from India (I quote from the\r\nbrokers' returns from Liverpool), was only 17,000 bales; in the three\r\nyears afterwards, owing, no doubt, partly to the great increase in\r\nprice, we received 551,000 bales, during which same three years the\r\nUnited States only sent us 611,000. Thus you see that in 1817, 1818, and\r\n1819, more than forty years ago, the quantity we received from India was\r\nclose upon, and in the year 1818 it actually exceeded, that which we\r\nreceived from the United States.\r\n\r\nWell, now I come down to the year 1832, and I have then the report of\r\nanother Member of Council, and beg every working man here, every man who\r\nis told that there is nobody to blame, to listen to one or two extracts\r\nfrom the report. Mr. Warden, Member of the Council, gave evidence in\r\n1832 that the money-tax levied on Surat cotton was 56 rupees per candy,\r\nleaving the grower only 24 rupees, or rather less than 3/4_d_. per\r\npound. In 1846 there was so great a decay of the cotton-trade of Western\r\nIndia, that a committee was appointed in Bombay, partly of Members of\r\nthe Chamber of Commerce and partly of servants of the Government, and\r\nthey made a report in which they stated that from every candy of cotton--\r\na candy is 7 cwt. or 784 lbs.--costing 80 rupees, which is 160\r\nshillings in Bombay, the Government had taken 48 rupees as land-tax and\r\nsea-duty, leaving only 32 rupees, or less than 3/4_d_. per pound,\r\nto be divided among all parties, from the Bombay seller to the Surat\r\ngrower.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 I was in the House of Commons, and I brought forward a\r\nproposition for a select committee to inquire into this whole question;\r\nfor in that year Lancashire was on the verge of the calamity that has\r\nnow overtaken it; cotton was very scarce, for hundreds of the mills were\r\nworking short time, and many were closed altogether. That committee\r\nreported that, in all the districts of Bombay and Madras where cotton\r\nwas cultivated, and generally over those agricultural regions, the\r\npeople were in a condition of the most abject and degraded pauperism;\r\nand I will ask you whether it is possible for a people in that condition\r\nto produce anything great, or anything good, or anything constant, which\r\nthe world requires?\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the quality of the cotton should be\r\nbad--so bad that it is illustrated by an anecdote which a very excellent\r\nman of the Methodist body told me the other day. He said that at a\r\nprayer-meeting, not more than a dozen miles from where I live, one of\r\nthe ministers was earnest in supplication to the Supreme; he detailed,\r\nno doubt, a great many things which he thought they were in want of, and\r\namongst the rest, a supply of cotton for the famishing people in that\r\ndistrict. When he prayed for cotton, some man with a keen sense of what\r\nhe had suffered, in response exclaimed, 'O Lord! but not Surat.'\r\n\r\nNow, my argument is this, and my assertion is this, that the growth of\r\ncotton in India,--the growth of an article which was native and common\r\nin India before America was discovered by Europeans,--that the growth of\r\nthat article has been systematically injured, strangled, and destroyed\r\nby the stupid and wicked policy of the Indian Government.\r\n\r\nI saw, the other day, a letter from a gentleman as well acquainted with\r\nIndian affairs, perhaps, as any man in India,--a letter written to a\r\nmember of the Madras Government,--in which he stated his firm opinion\r\nthat, if it had not been for the Bombay Committee in 1846, and for my\r\nCommittee in 1848, there would not have been any cotton sent from India\r\nat this moment to be worked up in Lancashire. Now, in 1846, the quantity\r\nof cotton coming from India had fallen to 94,000 bales. How has it\r\nincreased since then? In 1859 it had reached 509,000 bales; in 1860,\r\n562,000 bales; and last year, owing to the extraordinarily high price,\r\nit had reached 986,000 bales, and I suppose this year will be about the\r\nsame as last year.\r\n\r\nI think, in justification of myself and of some of those with whom I\r\nhave acted, I am entitled to ask your time for a few moments, to show\r\nyou what has been not so much done as attempted to be done to improve\r\nthis state of things; and what has been the systematic opposition that\r\nwe have had to contend with. In the year 1847, I moved for that\r\nCommittee, in a speech from which I shall read one short extract. I said\r\nthat, 'We ought not to forget that the whole of the cotton grown in\r\nAmerica is produced by slave labour, and this, I think, all will admit,--\r\nthat, no matter as to the period in which slavery may have existed,\r\nabolished it will ultimately be, either by peaceable means or by violent\r\nmeans. Whether it comes to an end by peaceable means or otherwise, there\r\nwill in all probability be an interruption to the production of cotton,\r\nand the calamity which must in consequence fall upon a part of the\r\nAmerican Union will be felt throughout the manufacturing districts of\r\nthis country.'\r\n\r\nThe committee was not refused;--Governments do not always refuse\r\ncommittees; they do not much fear them on matters of this kind; they put\r\nas many men on as the mover of the committee does, and sometimes more,\r\nand they often consider a committee, as my honourable Colleague will\r\ntell you, rather a convenient way of burying an unpleasant question, at\r\nleast for another session. The committee sat during the session of 1848,\r\nand it made a report, from which I shall quote, not an extract, but the\r\nsense of an extract. The evidence was very extensive, very complete, and\r\nentirely condemnatory of the whole system of the Indian Government with\r\nregard to the land and agricultural produce, and one might have hoped\r\nthat something would have arisen from it, and probably something has\r\narisen from it, but so slowly that you have no fruit,--nothing on which\r\nyou can calculate, even up to this hour.\r\n\r\nWell, in 1850, as nothing more was done, I thought it time to take\r\nanother step, and I gave notice of a motion for the appointment of a\r\nRoyal Commission to go to India for the express purpose of ascertaining\r\nthe truth of this matter, I moved, 'That a Royal Commission proceed to\r\nIndia to inquire into the obstacles which prevent the increased growth\r\nof cotton in India, and to report upon any circumstance which may\r\ninjuriously affect the economical and industrial condition of the native\r\npopulation, being cultivators of the soil, within the Presidencies of\r\nMadras and Bombay.'\r\n\r\nNow I shall read you one extract from my speech on that occasion, which\r\nrefers to this question of peril in America. I said, 'But there is\r\nanother point, that, whilst the production of cotton in the United\r\nStates results from slave labour, whether we approve of any particular\r\nmode of abolishing slavery in any country or not, we are all convinced\r\nthat it will be impossible in any country, and most of all in America,\r\nto keep between two and three millions of the population permanently in\r\na state of bondage. By whatever means that system is to be abolished,\r\nwhether by insurrection,--which I should deplore,--or by some great\r\nmeasure of justice from the Government,--one thing is certain, that the\r\nproduction of cotton must be interfered with for a considerable time\r\nafter such an event has taken place; and it may happen that the greatest\r\nmeasure of freedom that has ever been conceded may be a measure the\r\nconsequence of which will inflict mischief upon the greatest industrial\r\npursuit that engages the labour of the operative population of this\r\ncountry.'\r\n\r\nNow, it was not likely the Government could pay much attention to this,\r\nfor at that precise moment the Foreign Office--then presided over by\r\nLord Palmerston--was engaged with an English fleet in the waters of\r\nGreece, in collecting a bad debt for one Don Pacifico, a Jew, who made a\r\nfraudulent demand on the Greek Government for injuries said to have been\r\ncommitted upon him in Greece. Notwithstanding this, I called upon Lord\r\nJohn Russell, who was then the Prime Minister, and asked him whether he\r\nwould grant the Commission I was going to move for. I will say this for\r\nhim, he appeared to agree with me that it was a reasonable thing. I\r\nbelieve he saw the peril, and that my proposition was a proper one, but\r\nhe said he wished he could communicate with Lord Dalhousie. But it was\r\nin the month of June, and he could not do that, and hear from him again\r\nbefore the close of the session. He told me that Sir John Hobhouse, then\r\nPresident of the India Board, was very much against it; and I answered,\r\n'Doubtless he is, because he speaks as the mouthpiece of the East India\r\nCompany, against whom I am bringing this inquiry.'\r\n\r\nWell, my proposition came before the House, and, as some of you may\r\nrecollect, it was opposed by the President of the India Board, and the\r\nCommission was consequently not granted. I had seen Sir Robert Peel,--\r\nthis was only ten days before his death,--I had seen Sir Robert Peel,\r\nacquainted as he was with Lancashire interests, and had endeavoured to\r\nenlist him in my support. He cordially and entirely approved of my\r\nmotion, and he remained in the House during the whole of the time I was\r\nspeaking; but when Sir John Hobhouse rose to resist the motion, and he\r\nfound the Government would not consent to it, he then left his seat, and\r\nleft the House. The night after, or two nights after, he met me in the\r\nlobby; and he said he thought it was but right he should explain why he\r\nleft the House after the conversation he had held with me on this\r\nquestion before. He said he had hoped the Government would agree to the\r\nmotion, but when he found they would not, his position was so delicate\r\nwith regard to them and his own old party, that he was most anxious that\r\nnothing should induce him, unless under the pressure of some great\r\nextremity, to appear even to oppose them on any matter before the House.\r\nTherefore, from a very delicate sense of honour, he did not say what I\r\nam sure he would have been glad to have said, and the proposition did\r\nnot receive from him that help which, if it had received it, would have\r\nsurmounted all obstacles.\r\n\r\nTo show the sort of men who are made ministers--Sir John Hobhouse had on\r\nthese occasions always a speech of the same sort. He said this: 'With\r\nrespect to the peculiar urgency of the time, he could not say the\r\nhonourable Gentleman had made out his case; for he found that the\r\nimportation of cotton from all countries showed an immense increase\r\nduring the last three years.' We know that the importation of cotton has\r\nshown an 'immense increase' almost every three years for the last fifty\r\nyears. But it was because that increase was entirely, or nearly so, from\r\none source, and that source one of extreme peril, that I asked for the\r\ninquiry for which I moved. He said he had a letter in his hand--and he\r\nshook it at me--from the Secretary of the Commercial Association of\r\nManchester, in which the directors of that body declared by special\r\nresolution that my proposition was not necessary, that an inquiry might\r\ndo harm, and that they were abundantly satisfied with everything that\r\nthese lords of Leadenhall-street were doing. He said, 'Such was the\r\nletter of the Secretary of the Association, and it was a complete answer\r\nto the hon. Gentleman who had brought forward this motion.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment one of these gentlemen to whom I have referred, then\r\nPresident of the Board of Control, Governor of India, author, as he told\r\na committee on which I sat, of the Affghan war, is now decorated with a\r\nNorman title--for our masters even after a lapse of eight hundred years\r\nape the Norman style--sits in the House of Peers, and legislates for\r\nyou, having neglected in regard to India every great duty which\r\nappertained to his high office; and to show that it is not only cabinets\r\nand monarchs who thus distribute honours and rewards, the President of\r\nthat Commercial Association through whose instigation that letter was\r\nwritten is now one of the representatives of Manchester, the great\r\ncentre of that manufacture whose very foundation is now crumbling into\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nBut I was not, although discouraged, baffled. I went down to the Chamber\r\nof Commerce in Manchester, and along with Mr. Bazley, then the President\r\nof the Chamber, I believe, and Mr. Henry Ashworth, who is now the\r\nPresident of that Chamber, and many others, we determined to have a\r\nCommission of Inquiry of our own. We raised a subscription of more than\r\n2,000_l_.; we selected a gentleman--Mr. Alexander Mackay, the\r\nauthor of one of the very best books ever written by an Englishman upon\r\nAmerica, _The Western World_--and we invited him to become our\r\nCommissioner, and, unfortunately for him, he accepted the office. He\r\nwent to India, he made many inquiries, he wrote many interesting\r\nreports; but, like many others who go to India, his health declined; he\r\nreturned from Bombay, but he did not live to reach home.\r\n\r\nWe were greatly disappointed at this on public grounds, besides our\r\nregret for the loss of one of so much private worth. Some of us, Mr.\r\nBazley particularly, undertook the charge of publishing these reports,\r\nand a friend of Mr. Mackay's, now no longer living, undertook the\r\neditorship of them, and they were published in a volume called\r\n_Western India_; and that volume received such circulation as a\r\nwork of that nature is likely to have.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1853 there came the proposition for the renewal of the East\r\nIndia Company's charter. I opposed that to the utmost of my power in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and some of you will recollect I came down here with\r\nMr. Danby Seymour, the Member for Poole, a gentleman well acquainted\r\nwith Indian affairs, and attended a meeting in this very hall, to\r\ndenounce the policy of conferring the government of that great country\r\nfor another twenty years upon a Company which had so entirely neglected\r\nevery duty belonging to it except one--the duty of collecting taxes. In\r\n1854, Colonel Cotton--now Sir Arthur Cotton, one of the most\r\ndistinguished engineers in India--came down to Manchester. We had a\r\nmeeting at the Town Hall, and he gave an address on the subject of\r\nopening the Godavery River, in order that it might form a mode of\r\ntransit, cheap and expeditious, from the cotton districts to the north\r\nof that river; and it was proposed to form a joint-stock company to do\r\nit, but unfortunately the Russian war came on and disturbed all\r\ncommercial projects, and made it impossible to raise money for any--as\r\nsome might call it--speculative purpose, like that of opening an Indian\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nWell, in 1857 there came the mutiny. What did our rulers do then? Sir\r\nCharles Wood, in 1538, had made a speech five hours long, most of it in\r\npraise of the government of the East India Company. In 1858--at the\r\nopening of the session in 1858, I think--the Government brought in a\r\nBill to abolish that Company, and to establish a new form of government\r\nfor India. That was exactly what we asked them to do in 1853; but, as in\r\neverything else, nothing is done until there comes an overwhelming\r\ncalamity, when the most obtuse and perverse is driven from his position.\r\nIn 1858 that Bill passed, under the auspices of Lord Stanley. It was not\r\na Bill such as I think Lord Stanley approved when he was not a Minister;\r\nit was not a Bill such as I believe he would have brought in if he had\r\nbeen permitted by the House and the Cabinet to have brought in a better\r\nBill. It abolished the East India Company, established a new Council,\r\nand left things to a great extent much in the same state as they were.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion of that Bill, I made a speech on Indian affairs,\r\nwhich I believe goes to the root of the matter. I protested then as now\r\nagainst the notion of governing one hundred and fifty millions of\r\npeople--twenty different nations, with twenty different languages--from\r\na little coterie of rulers in the city of Calcutta. I proposed that the\r\ncountry should be divided into five or six separate, and, as regards\r\neach other, independent Presidencies of equal rank, with a governor and\r\ncouncil in each, and each government corresponding with, and dependent\r\nupon, and responsible to, a Secretary of State in this country. I am of\r\nopinion that if such a Government were established, one in each\r\nPresidency, and if there was a first-class engineer, with an efficient\r\nstaff, whose business should be to determine what public works should be\r\ncarried on, some by the Government and some by private companies--I\r\nbelieve that ten years of such judicious labours would work an entire\r\nrevolution in the condition of India; and if it had been done when I\r\nfirst began to move in this question, I have not the smallest doubt we\r\nmight have had at this moment any quantity of cotton whatever that the\r\nmills of Lancashire require.\r\n\r\nWell, after this, I am afraid some of my friends may feel, and my\r\nopponents will say, that it is very egotistical in me to have entered\r\ninto these details. But I think, after this recapitulation, I am at\r\nliberty to say I am guiltless of that calamity which has fallen upon us.\r\nAnd I may mention that some friends of mine--Mr. John Dickinson, now\r\nChairman of the Indian Reform Association, Mr. Bazley, one of the\r\nmembers for Manchester, Mr. Ashworth, the President of the Chamber of\r\nCommerce of Manchester, and Mr. John Benjamin Smith, the Member for\r\nStockport--present themselves at this moment to my eyes as those who\r\nhave been largely instrumental in calling the attention of Parliament\r\nand of the country to this great question of the reform of our\r\nGovernment in India.\r\n\r\nBut I have been asked twenty, fifty times during the last twelve months,\r\n'Why do you not come out and say something? Why can you not tell us\r\nsomething in this time of our great need?' Well, I reply, 'I told you\r\nsomething when speaking was of use; all I can say now is this, or nearly\r\nall, that a hundred years of crime against the negro in America, and a\r\nhundred years of crime against the docile natives of our Indian empire,\r\nare not to be washed away by the penitence and the suffering of an\r\nhour.'\r\n\r\nBut what is our position? for you who are subscribing your money here\r\nhave a right to know. I believe the quantity of cotton in the United\r\nStates is at this moment much less than many people here believe, and\r\nthat it is in no condition to be forwarded and exported. And I suspect\r\nthat it is far more probable than otherwise, notwithstanding some of the\r\nstrange theories of my honourable Colleague, that there never will again\r\nbe in America a crop of cotton grown by slave labour. You will\r\nunderstand--I hope so, at least--that I am not undertaking the office of\r\nprophet, I am not predicting; I know that everything which is not\r\nabsolutely impossible may happen, and therefore things may happen wholly\r\ndifferent to the course which appears to me to be likely. But I say,\r\ntaking the facts as they are before us--with that most limited vision\r\nwhich is given to mortals--the high probability is that there will never\r\nbe another considerable crop, or one available for our manufactories,\r\nfrom slave labour in the United States.\r\n\r\nWe read the American papers, or the quotations from them in our own\r\npapers, but I believe we can form no adequate conception of the\r\ndisorganization and chaos that now prevail throughout a great portion of\r\nthe Southern States. It is natural to a state of war under the\r\ncircumstances of society in that region. But then we may be asked, What\r\nare our sources of supply, putting aside India? There is the colony of\r\nQueensland, where enthusiastic persons tell you cotton can be grown\r\nworth 3_s_. a pound. True enough; but when labour is probably worth\r\n10_s_. a-day, I am not sure you are likely to get any large supply\r\nof that material we so much want, at a rate so cheap that we shall be\r\nlikely to use it. Africa is pointed to by a very zealous friend of mine;\r\nbut Africa is a land of savages, and with its climate so much against\r\nEuropean constitutions, I should not entertain the hope that any great\r\nrelief at any early period can be had from that continent. Egypt will\r\nsend us 30,000 or 40,000 bales more than last year; in all probability\r\nSyria and Brazil, with these high prices, will increase their production\r\nto some considerable extent; but I believe there is no country at\r\npresent from which you can derive any very large supply, except you can\r\nget it from your own dependencies in India. Now if there be no more\r\ncotton to be grown for two, or three, or four years in America, for our\r\nsupply, we shall require, considering the smallness of the bales and the\r\nloss in working up the cotton--we shall require nearly 6,000,000 of\r\nadditional bales to be supplied from some source.\r\n\r\nI want to put to you one question. It has taken the United States twenty\r\nyears, from 1840 up to 1860, to increase their growth of cotton from\r\n2,000,000 bales to 4,000,000. How long will it take any other country,\r\nwith comparatively little capital, with a thousand disadvantages which\r\nAmerica did not suffer from--how long will it take any other country, or\r\nall other countries, to give us 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 additional bales\r\nof cotton? There is one stimulus--the only one that I know of; and\r\nalthough I have not recommended it to the Government, and I know not\r\nprecisely what sacrifice it would entail, yet I shall mention it, and I\r\ndo it on the authority of a gentleman to whom I have before referred,\r\nwho is thoroughly acquainted with Indian agriculture, and whose family\r\nhave been landowners and cultivators in India for sixty years. He says\r\nthere is only one mode by which you can rapidly stimulate the growth of\r\ncotton in India, except that stimulus coming from the high prices for\r\nthe time being,--he says that, if the Government would make a public\r\ndeclaration that for five years they would exempt from land-tax all land\r\nwhich during that time shall grow cotton, there would be the most\r\nextraordinary increase in the growth of that article which has ever been\r\nseen in regard to any branch of agriculture in the world.\r\n\r\nI do not know how far that would act, but I believe the stimulus would\r\nbe enormous,--the loss to the Government in revenue would be something,\r\nbut the deliverance to the industry of Lancashire, if it succeeded, as\r\nmy friend thinks, would of course be speedy, and perhaps complete. Short\r\nof this, I look upon the restoration of the prosperity of Lancashire as\r\ndistant. I believe this misfortune may entail ruin upon the whole\r\nworking population, and that it may gradually engulf the smaller traders\r\nand those possessing the least capital. I do not say it will, because,\r\nas I have said, what is not impossible may happen,--but it may for years\r\nmake the whole factory property of Lancashire almost entirely worthless.\r\nWell, this is a very dismal look-out for a great many persons in this\r\ncountry; but it comes, as I have said,--it comes from that utter neglect\r\nof their opportunities and their duties which has distinguished the\r\nGovernment of India.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, before I sit down I shall ask you to listen to me for a few\r\nmoments on the other branch of this great question, which refers to that\r\nsad tragedy which is passing before our eyes in the United States of\r\nAmerica. I shall not, in consequence of anything you have heard from my\r\nhon. Friend, conceal from you any of the opinions which I hold, and\r\nwhich I proposed to lay before you if he had not spoken. Having given to\r\nhim, notwithstanding some diversity of opinion, a fair and candid\r\nhearing, I presume that I shall receive the same favour from those who\r\nmay differ from me. If I had known that my hon. Friend was going to make\r\nan elaborate speech on this occasion, one of two things I should have\r\ndone: I should either have prepared myself entirely to answer him, or I\r\nshould have decided not to attend a meeting where there could by any\r\npossibility of chance have been anything like discord between so many--\r\nhis friends and my friends--in this room.\r\n\r\nSince I have been Member for Birmingham, Mr. Scholefield has treated me\r\nwith the kindness of a brother. Nothing could possibly be more generous\r\nand more disinterested in every way than his conduct towards me during\r\nthese several years, and therefore I would much rather--far rather--that\r\nI lost any opportunity like this of speaking on this question, than I\r\nwould have come here and appeared to be at variance with him. But I am\r\nhappy to say that this great question does not depend upon the opinion\r\nof any man in Birmingham, or in England, or anywhere else. And therefore\r\nI could--anxious always, unless imperative duty requires, to avoid even\r\na semblance of difference--I could with a clear conscience have\r\nabstained from coming to and speaking at this meeting.\r\n\r\nBut I observe that my hon. Friend endeavoured to avoid committing\r\nhimself to what is called sympathy with the South. He takes a political\r\nview of this great question,--is disposed to deal with the matter as he\r\nwould have dealt with the case of a colony of Spain or Portugal\r\nrevolting in South America, or of Greece revolting from Turkey. I should\r\nlike to state here what I once said to an eminent American. He asked me\r\nif I could give him an idea of the course of public opinion in this\r\ncountry from the moment we heard of the secession of the Cotton States;\r\nand I endeavoured to trace it in this way,--and I ask you to say whether\r\nit is a fair and full description.\r\n\r\nI said--and my hon. Friend has admitted this--that when the revolt or\r\nsecession was first announced, people here were generally against the\r\nSouth. Nobody thought then that the South had any cause for breaking up\r\nthe integrity of that great nation. Their opinion was, and what people\r\nsaid, according to their different politics in this country was, 'They\r\nhave a Government which is mild, and not in any degree oppressive; they\r\nhave not what some people love very much, and what some people dislike,--\r\nthey have not a costly monarchy, and an aristocracy, creating and\r\nliving on patronage. They have not an expensive foreign policy; a great\r\narmy; a great navy; and they have no suffering millions discontented and\r\nendeavouring to overthrow their Government;--all which things have been\r\nsaid against Governments in this country and in Europe a hundred times\r\nwithin our own hearing,'--and therefore, they said, 'Why should these\r\nmen revolt?'\r\n\r\nBut for a moment the Washington Government appeared paralyzed. It had no\r\narmy and no navy; everybody was traitor to it. It was paralyzed and\r\napparently helpless; and in the hour when the government was transferred\r\nfrom President Buchanan to President Lincoln, many people--such was the\r\nunprepared state of the North, such was the apparent paralysis of\r\neverything there--thought there would be no war; and men shook hands\r\nwith each other pleasantly, and congratulated themselves that the\r\ndisaster of a great strife, and the mischief to our own trade, might be\r\navoided. That was the opinion at that moment, so far as I can recollect,\r\nand could gather at the time, with my opportunities of gathering such\r\nopinion. They thought the North would acquiesce in the rending of the\r\nRepublic, and that there would be no war.\r\n\r\nWell, but there was another reason. They were told by certain public\r\nwriters in this country that the contest was entirely hopeless, as they\r\nhave been told lately by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am very\r\nhappy that, though the Chancellor of the Exchequer is able to decide to\r\na penny what shall be the amount of taxes to meet public expenditure in\r\nEngland, he cannot decide what shall be the fate of a whole continent.\r\nIt was said that the contest was hopeless, and why should the North\r\ncontinue a contest at so much loss of blood and treasure, and at so\r\ngreat a loss to the commerce of the whole world? If a man thought--if a\r\nman believed in his heart that the contest was absolutely hopeless--no\r\nman in this country had probably any right to form a positive opinion\r\none way or the other--but if he had formed that opinion, he might think,\r\n'Well, the North can never be successful; it would be much better that\r\nthey should not carry on the war at all; and therefore I am rather glad\r\nthat the South should have success, for by that the war will be the\r\nsooner put an end to.' I think this was a feeling that was abroad.\r\n\r\nNow I am of opinion that, if we judge a foreign nation in the\r\ncircumstances in which we find America, we ought to apply to it our own\r\nprinciples. My hon. Friend has referred to the question of the Trent. I\r\nwas not here last year, but I heard of a meeting--I read in the papers\r\nof a meeting held in reference to that affair in this very hall, and\r\nthat there was a great diversity of opinion. But the majority were\r\nsupposed to indorse the policy of the Government in making a great\r\ndemonstration of force. And I think I read that at least one minister of\r\nreligion took that view from this platform. I am not complaining of it.\r\nBut I say that if you thought when the American captain, even if he had\r\nacted under the commands of his Government, which he had not, had taken\r\ntwo men most injurious and hostile to his country from the deck of an\r\nEnglish ship--if you thought that on that ground you were justified in\r\ngoing to war with the Republic of North America, then I say you ought\r\nnot to be very nice in judging what America should do in circumstances\r\nmuch more onerous than those in which you were placed.\r\n\r\nNow, take as an illustration the Rock of Gibraltar. Many of you have\r\nbeen there, I dare say. I have; and among the things that interested me\r\nwere the monkeys on the top of it, and a good many people at the bottom,\r\nwho were living on English taxes. Well, the Rock of Gibraltar was taken\r\nand retained by this country when we were not at war with Spain, and it\r\nwas retained contrary to every law of morality and honour. [A Voice:\r\n'No! No!'] No doubt the Gentleman below is much better acquainted with\r\nthe history of it than I am, but I may suggest to him that very likely\r\nwe have read two different histories. But I will let this pass, and I\r\nwill assume that it came into the possession of England in the most\r\nhonourable way, which is, I suppose, by regular and acknowledged\r\nnational warfare.\r\n\r\nSuppose, at this moment, you heard, or the English Government heard,\r\nthat Spain was equipping expeditions, by land and sea, for the purpose\r\nof retaking that fortress and rock. Now, although it is not of the\r\nslightest advantage to any Englishman living, excepting to those who\r\nhave pensions and occupations upon it; although every Government knows\r\nit, and although more than one Government has been anxious to give it\r\nup, and I hope this Government will send my friend, Mr. Cobden, to\r\nMadrid, with an offer that Gibraltar shall be ceded to Spain, as being\r\nof no use to this country, and only embittering, as statesmen have\r\nadmitted, the relations between Spain and England,--and if he were to go\r\nto Madrid with an offer of the Rock of Gibraltar, I believe he might\r\nobtain a commercial treaty with Spain, that would admit every English\r\nmanufacture and every article of English produce into that country at a\r\nduty of not more than ten per cent.;--I say, do you not think that, if\r\nyou heard that Spain was about to retake that useless rock, mustering\r\nher legions and her fleets, the English Government would combine all the\r\npower of this country to resist it?\r\n\r\nIf that be so, then I think--seeing that there was a fair election two\r\nyears ago, and that President Lincoln was fairly and honestly elected--\r\nthat when the Southern leaders met at Montgomery in Alabama, on the 6th\r\nof March, and authorized the raising of a hundred thousand men, and\r\nwhen, on the 15th of April, they attacked Fort Sumter--not a fort of\r\nSouth Carolina, but a fort of the Union--then, upon all the principles\r\nthat Englishmen and English Governments have ever acted upon, President\r\nLincoln was justified in calling out seventy-five thousand men--which\r\nwas his first call--for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of that\r\nnation, which was the main purpose of the oath which he had taken at his\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nNow I shall not go into a long argument upon this question, for the\r\nreason that a year ago I said what I thought it necessary to say upon\r\nit, and because I believe the question is in the hand, not of my hon.\r\nFriend, nor in that of Lord Palmerston, nor in that even of President\r\nLincoln, but it is in the hand of the Supreme Ruler, who is bringing\r\nabout one of those great transactions in history which men often will\r\nnot regard when they are passing before them, but which they look back\r\nupon with awe and astonishment some years after they are past. So I\r\nshall content myself with asking one or two questions. I shall not\r\ndiscuss the question whether the North is making war for the\r\nConstitution, or making war for the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\nIf you come to a matter of sympathy with the South, or recognition of\r\nthe South, or mediation or intervention for the benefit of the South,\r\nyou should consider what are the ends of the South. Surely the United\r\nStates Government is a Government at amity with this country. Its\r\nMinister is in London--a man honourable by family, as you know, in\r\nAmerica, his father and his grandfather having held the office of\r\nPresident of the Republic. You have your own Minister just returned to\r\nWashington. Is this hypocrisy? Are you, because you can cavil at certain\r\nthings which the North, the United States Government, has done or has\r\nnot done, are you eagerly to throw the influence of your opinion into a\r\nmovement which is to dismember the great Republic?\r\n\r\nIs there a man here that doubts for a moment that the object of the war\r\non the part of the South--they began the war--that the object of the war\r\non the part of the South is to maintain in bondage four millions of\r\nhuman beings? That is only a small part of it. The further object is to\r\nperpetuate for ever the bondage of all the posterity of those four\r\nmillions of slaves. [A few cries of 'No! No!'] You will hear that I am\r\nnot in a condition to contest vigorously anything that may be opposed,\r\nfor I am suffering, as nearly everybody is, from the state of the\r\nweather, and a hoarseness that almost hinders me from speaking. I could\r\nquote their own documents till midnight in proof of what I say; and if I\r\nfound a man who denied it, upon the evidence that had been offered, I\r\nwould not offend him, or trouble myself by trying further to convince\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe object is, that a handful of white men on that continent shall lord\r\nit over many millions of blacks, made black by the very Hand that made\r\nus white. The object is, that they should have the power to breed\r\nnegroes, to work negroes, to lash negroes, to chain negroes, to buy and\r\nsell negroes, to deny them the commonest ties of family, or to break\r\ntheir hearts by rending them at their pleasure, to close their mental\r\neye to but a glimpse even of that knowledge which separates us from the\r\nbrute--for in their laws it is criminal and penal to teach the negro to\r\nread--to seal from their hearts the Book of our religion, and to make\r\nchattels and things of men and women and children.\r\n\r\nNow I want to ask whether this is to be the foundation, as it is\r\nproposed, of a new slave empire, and whether it is intended that on this\r\naudacious and infernal basis England's new ally is to be built up. It\r\nhas been said that Greece was recognized, and that other countries had\r\nbeen recognized. But Greece was not recognized till after she had fought\r\nTurkey for six years, and the Republics of South America, some of them,\r\nnot till they had fought the mother country for a score of years. France\r\ndid not recognize the United States of America till some, I think, six\r\nyears, five certainly, after the beginning of the War of Independence,\r\nand even then it was received as a declaration of war by the English\r\nGovernment. I want to know who they are who speak eagerly in favour of\r\nEngland becoming the ally and friend of this great conspiracy against\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\nNow I should have no kind of objection to recognize a country because it\r\nwas a country that held slaves--to recognize the United States, or to be\r\nin amity with it. The question of slavery there, and in Cuba and in\r\nBrazil, is, as far as respects the present generation, an accident, and\r\nit would be unreasonable that we should object to trade with and have\r\npolitical relations with a country, merely because it happened to have\r\nwithin its borders the institution of slavery, hateful as that\r\ninstitution is. But in this case it is a new State intending to set\r\nitself up on the sole basis of slavery. Slavery is blasphemously\r\ndeclared to be its chief corner-stone.\r\n\r\nI have heard that there are, in this country, ministers of state who are\r\nin favour of the South; that there are members of the aristocracy who\r\nare terrified at the shadow of the Great Republic; that there are rich\r\nmen on our commercial exchanges, depraved, it may be, by their riches,\r\nand thriving unwholesomely within the atmosphere of a privileged class;\r\nthat there are conductors of the public press who would barter the\r\nrights of millions of their fellow-creatures that they might bask in the\r\nsmiles of the great.\r\n\r\nBut I know that there are ministers of state who do not wish that this\r\ninsurrection should break up the American nation; that there are members\r\nof our aristocracy who are not afraid of the shadow of the Republic;\r\nthat there are rich men, many, who are not depraved by their riches; and\r\nthat there are public writers of eminence and honour who will not barter\r\nhuman rights for the patronage of the great. But most of all, and before\r\nall, I believe,--I am sure it is true in Lancashire, where the working\r\nmen have seen themselves coming down from prosperity to ruin, from\r\nindependence to a subsistence on charity,--I say that I believe that the\r\nunenfranchised but not hopeless millions of this country will never\r\nsympathize with a revolt which is intended to destroy the liberty of a\r\ncontinent, and to build on its ruins a mighty fabric of human bondage.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak to gentlemen in private upon this matter, and hear their\r\nown candid opinion,--I mean those who differ from me on this question,--\r\nthey generally end by saying that the Republic is too great and too\r\npowerful, and that it is better for us--not by 'us' meaning you, but the\r\ngoverning classes and the governing policy of England--that it should be\r\nbroken up. But we will suppose that we are in New York or in Boston,\r\ndiscussing the policy and power of England. If any one there were to\r\npoint to England,--not to the thirty-one millions of population in these\r\nislands, but to her one hundred and fifty millions in India, and nobody\r\nknows how many millions more in every other part of the globe,--might he\r\nnot, whilst boasting that America has not covered the ocean with fleets\r\nof force, or left the bones of her citizens to blanch on a hundred\r\nEuropean battle-fields,--might he not fairly say, that England is great\r\nand powerful, and that it is perilous for the world that she is so\r\ngreat?\r\n\r\nBut bear in mind that every declaration of this kind, whether from an\r\nEnglishman who professes to be strictly English, or from an American\r\nstrictly American, or from a Frenchman strictly French,--whether it\r\nasserts in arrogant strains that Britannia rules the waves, or speaks of\r\n'manifest destiny' and the supremacy of the 'Stars and Stripes' or\r\nboasts that the Eagles of one nation, having once overrun Europe, may\r\npossibly repeat the experiment,--I say all this is to be condemned. It\r\nis not truly patriotic; it is not rational; it is not moral. Then, I\r\nsay, if any man wishes the Great Republic to be severed on that ground:\r\nin my opinion, he is doing that which tends to keep alive jealousies\r\nwhich, as far as he can prevent it, will never die; though if they do\r\nnot die, wars must be eternal.\r\n\r\nBut then I shall be told that the people of the North do not like us at\r\nall. In fact, we have heard it to-night. It is not reasonable that they\r\nshould like us. If an American be in this room to-night, will he feel\r\nthat he likes my honourable Friend? But if the North does not like\r\nEngland, does anybody believe the South does? It does not appear to me\r\nto be a question of liking or disliking. Everybody knows that when the\r\nSouth was in power,--and it has been in power for the last fifty years,--\r\neverybody knows that hostility to this country, wherever it existed in\r\nAmerica, was cherished and stimulated to the utmost degree by some of\r\nthose very men who are now leaders of this very insurrection.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend read a passage about the _Alabama_. I undertake to\r\nsay that he is not acquainted with the facts about the _Alabama_,\r\nThat he will acknowledge, I think. The Government of this country have\r\nadmitted that the building of the _Alabama_, and her sailing from\r\nthe Mersey, was a violation of international law. In America they say,\r\nand they say here, that the _Alabama_ is a ship of war; that she\r\nwas built in the Mersey; that she was built, and I have reason to\r\nbelieve it, by a member of the British Parliament; that she is furnished\r\nwith guns of English manufacture; that she is manned almost entirely by\r\nEnglishmen; and that these facts were represented, as I know they were\r\nrepresented, to the collector of customs in Liverpool, who pooh-poohed\r\nthem, and said there was nothing in them. He was requested to send the\r\nfacts up to London to the Customs' authorities, and their solicitor, not\r\na very wise man, but probably in favour of breaking up the Republic, did\r\nnot think them of much consequence; but afterwards the opinion of an\r\neminent counsel, Mr. Collier, the Member for Plymouth, was taken, and he\r\nstated distinctly that what was being done in Liverpool was a direct\r\ninfringement of the Foreign Enlistment Act, and that the Customs'\r\nauthorities of Liverpool would be responsible for anything that happened\r\nin consequence.\r\n\r\nWhen this opinion was taken to the Foreign Office the Foreign Office was\r\na little astonished and a little troubled; and after they had consulted\r\ntheir own law officers, whose opinions agreed with that of Mr. Collier,\r\nthey did what Government officers generally do, and as promptly,--a\r\ntelegraphic message went down to Liverpool to order that this vessel\r\nshould be seized, and she happened to sail an hour or two before the\r\nmessage arrived. She has never been into a Confederate port--they have\r\nnot got any ports; she hoists the English flag when she wants to come\r\nalongside a ship; she sets a ship on fire in the night, and when, seeing\r\nfire, another ship bears down to lend help, she seizes it, and pillages\r\nand burns it. I think that, if we were citizens of New York, it would\r\nrequire a little more calmness than is shown in this country to look at\r\nall this as if it was a matter with which we had no concern. And\r\ntherefore I do not so much blame the language that has been used in\r\nAmerica in reference to the question of the _Alabama_.\r\n\r\nBut they do not know in America so much as we know--the whole truth\r\nabout public opinion here. There are ministers in our Cabinet as\r\nresolved to be no traitors to freedom, on this question, as I am; and\r\nthere are members of the English aristocracy, and in the very highest\r\nrank, as I know for a certainty, who hold the same opinion. They do not\r\nknow in America--at least, there has been no indication of it until the\r\nadvices that have come to hand within the last two days--what is the\r\nopinion of the great body of the working classes in England. There has\r\nbeen every effort that money and malice could make to stimulate in\r\nLancashire, amongst the suffering population, an expression of opinion\r\nin favour of the Slave States. They have not been able to get it. And I\r\nhonour that population for their fidelity to principles and to freedom,\r\nand I say that the course they have taken ought to atone in the minds of\r\nthe people of the United States for miles of leading articles, written\r\nby the London press,--by men who would barter every human right,--that\r\nthey might serve the party with which they are associated.\r\n\r\nBut now I shall ask you one other question before I sit down,--How comes\r\nit that on the Continent there is not a liberal newspaper, nor a liberal\r\npolitician, that has said, or has thought of saying, a word in favour of\r\nthis portentous and monstrous shape which now asks to be received into\r\nthe family of nations? Take the great Italian Minister, Count Cavour.\r\nYou read some time ago in the papers part of a despatch which he wrote\r\non the question of America--he had no difficulty in deciding. Ask\r\nGaribaldi. Is there in Europe a more disinterested and generous friend\r\nof freedom than Garibaldi? Ask that illustrious Hungarian, to whose\r\nmarvellous eloquence you once listened in this hall. Will he tell you\r\nthat slavery has nothing to do with it, and that the slaveholders of the\r\nSouth will liberate the negroes sooner than the North through the\r\ninstrumentality of the war? Ask Victor Hugo, the poet of freedom,--the\r\nexponent, may I not call him, of the yearnings of all mankind for a\r\nbetter time? Ask any man in Europe who opens his lips for freedom,--who\r\ndips his pen in ink that he may indite a sentence for freedom,--whoever\r\nhas a sympathy for freedom warm in his own heart,--ask him,--he will\r\nhave no difficulty in telling you on which side your sympathies should\r\nlie.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days ago a German merchant in Manchester was speaking to a\r\nfriend of mine, and said he had recently travelled all through Germany.\r\nHe said, 'I am so surprised,--I don't find one man in favour of the\r\nSouth' That is not true of Germany only, it is true of all the world\r\nexcept this island, famed for freedom, in which we dwell. I will tell\r\nyou what is the reason. Our London press is mainly in the hands of\r\ncertain ruling West End classes; it acts and writes in favour of those\r\nclasses. I will tell you what they mean. One of the most eminent\r\nstatesmen in this country,--one who has rendered the greatest services\r\nto the country, though, I must say, not in an official capacity, in\r\nwhich men very seldom confer such great advantages upon the country,--he\r\ntold me twice, at an interval of several months, 'I had no idea how much\r\ninfluence the example of that Republic was having upon opinion here,\r\nuntil I discovered the universal congratulation that the Republic was\r\nlikely to be broken up.'\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the Free States are the home of the working man. Now, I speak\r\nto working men particularly at this moment. Do you know that in fifteen\r\nyears two million five hundred thousand persons, men, women, and\r\nchildren, have left the United Kingdom to find a home in the Free States\r\nof America? That is a population equal to eight great cities of the size\r\nof Birmingham. What would you think of eight Birminghams being\r\ntransplanted from this country and set down in the United States?\r\nSpeaking generally, every man of these two and a half millions is in a\r\nposition of much higher comfort and prosperity than he would have been\r\nif he had remained in this country. I say it is the home of the working\r\nman; as one of her poets has recently said,--\r\n\r\n  'For her free latch-string never was drawn in\r\n  Against the poorest child of Adam's kin.'\r\n\r\nAnd in that land there are no six millions of grown men--I speak of the\r\nFree States--excluded from the constitution of their country and its\r\nelectoral franchise; there, you will find a free Church, a free school,\r\nfree land, a free vote, and a free career for the child of the humblest\r\nborn in the land. My countrymen who work for your living, remember this:\r\nthere will be one wild shriek of freedom to startle all mankind if that\r\nAmerican Republic should be overthrown.\r\n\r\nNow for one moment let us lift ourselves, if we can, above the narrow\r\ncircle in which we are all too apt to live and think; let us put\r\nourselves on an historical eminence, and judge this matter fairly.\r\nSlavery has been, as we all know, the huge, foul blot upon the fame of\r\nthe American Republic; it is a hideous outrage against human right and\r\nagainst Divine law; but the pride, the passion of man, will not permit\r\nits peaceable extinction. The slave-owners of our colonies, if they had\r\nbeen strong enough, would have revolted too. I believe there was no mode\r\nshort of a miracle more stupendous than any recorded in Holy Writ that\r\ncould in our time, or in a century, or in any time, have brought about\r\nthe abolition of slavery in America, but the suicide which the South has\r\ncommitted and the war which it has begun.\r\n\r\nSir, it is a measureless calamity,--this war. I said the Russian war was\r\na measureless calamity, and yet many of your leaders and friends told\r\nyou that it was a just war to maintain the integrity of Turkey, some\r\nthousands of miles off. Surely the integrity of your own country at your\r\nown doors must be worth as much as the integrity of Turkey. Is not this\r\nwar the penalty which inexorable justice exacts from America, North and\r\nSouth, for the enormous guilt of cherishing that frightful iniquity of\r\nslavery for the last eighty years? I do not blame any man here who\r\nthinks the cause of the North hopeless and the restoration of the Union\r\nimpossible. It may be hopeless; the restoration may be impossible. You\r\nhave the authority of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on that point. The\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, as a speaker, is not surpassed by any man\r\nin England, and he is a great statesman; he believes the cause of the\r\nNorth to be hopeless; that their enterprise cannot succeed.\r\n\r\nWell, he is quite welcome to that opinion, and so is anybody else. I do\r\nnot hold the opinion; but the facts are before us all, and, as far as we\r\ncan discard passion and sympathy, we are all equally at liberty to form\r\nour own opinion. But what I do blame is this. I blame men who are eager\r\nto admit into the family of nations a State which offers itself to us,\r\nbased upon a principle, I will undertake to say, more odious and more\r\nblasphemous than was ever heretofore dreamed of in Christian or Pagan,\r\nin civilized or in savage times. The leaders of this revolt propose this\r\nmonstrous thing--that over a territory forty times as large as England,\r\nthe blight and curse of slavery shall be for ever perpetuated.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe, for my part, that such a fate will befall that fair\r\nland, stricken though it now is with the ravages of war. I cannot\r\nbelieve that civilization, in its journey with the sun, will sink into\r\nendless night in order to gratify the ambition of the leaders of this\r\nrevolt, who seek to\r\n\r\n  'Wade through slaughter to a throne,\r\n  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind.'\r\n\r\nI have another and a far brighter vision before my gaze. It may be but a\r\nvision, but I will cherish it. I see one vast confederation stretching\r\nfrom the frozen North in unbroken line to the glowing South, and from\r\nthe wild billows of the Atlantic westward to the calmer waters of the\r\nPacific main,--and I see one people, and one language, and one law, and\r\none faith, and, over all that wide continent, the home of freedom, and a\r\nrefuge for the oppressed of every race and of every clime.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nSLAVERY AND SECESSION.\r\nROCHDALE, FEBRUARY 3, 1863.\r\n\r\n[This speech was delivered at a public meeting held in the Public Hall,\r\nRochdale, for the purpose of passing a resolution of thanks to the\r\nmerchants of New York, for their generous contributions to the relief of\r\nthe suffering population of the cotton districts.]\r\n\r\nI feel as if we were in our places to-night, for we are met for the\r\npurpose of considering, and, I doubt not, of agreeing to a resolution\r\nexpressive of our sense of the generosity of the merchants of New York,\r\nand other citizens of the United States, who have, in the midst of so\r\nmany troubles and such great sacrifices, contributed to the relief of\r\nthat appalling distress which has prevailed, and does still prevail, in\r\nthis county.\r\n\r\nI regard this transmission of assistance from the United States as a\r\nproof that the world moves onward in the direction of a better time. It\r\nis an evidence that, whatever may be the faults of ambitious men, and\r\nsometimes, may I not say, the crimes of Governments, the peoples are\r\ndrawing together, and beginning to learn that it never was intended that\r\nthey should be hostile to each other, but that every nation should take\r\na brotherly interest in every other nation in the world. There has been,\r\nas we all know, not a little jealousy between some portions of the\r\npeople of this country and some portions of the people of the United\r\nStates. Perhaps the jealousy has existed more on this side. I think it\r\nhas found more expression here, probably through the means of the public\r\npress, than has been the case with them. I am not alluding now to the\r\nlast two years, but as long as most of us have been readers of\r\nnewspapers and observers of what has passed around us.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of independence, eighty years ago; the war of 1812; it\r\nmay be, occasionally, the presumptuousness and the arrogance of a\r\ngrowing and prosperous nation on the other side of the Atlantic--these\r\nthings have stimulated ill feeling and jealousy here, which have often\r\nfound expression in language which has not been of the very kindest\r\ncharacter. But why should there be this jealousy between these two\r\nnations? Mr. Ashworth has said, and said very truly, 'Are they not our\r\nown people?' I should think, as an Englishman, that to see that people\r\nso numerous, so powerful, so great in so many ways, should be to us a\r\ncause, not of envy or of fear, but rather of glory and rejoicing.\r\n\r\nI have never visited the United States, but I can understand the\r\npleasure with which an Englishman lands in a country three thousand\r\nmiles off, and finds that every man he meets speaks his own language. I\r\nrecollect some years ago reading a most amusing speech delivered by a\r\nSuffolk country gentleman, at a Suffolk agricultural dinner, I think it\r\nwas, though I do not believe the speeches of Suffolk country gentlemen\r\nat Suffolk agricultural meetings are generally very amusing. But this\r\nwas a very amusing speech. This gentleman had travelled; he had been in\r\nthe United States, and being intelligent enough to admire much that he\r\nsaw there, he gave to his audience a description of some things that he\r\nhad seen; but that which seemed to delight him most was this, that when\r\nhe stepped from the steamer on to the quay at New York, he found that\r\n'everybody spoke Suffolk.' Now, if anybody from this neighbourhood\r\nshould visit New York, I am afraid that he will not find everybody\r\nspeaking Lancashire. Our dialect, as you know, is vanishing into the\r\npast. It will be preserved to future times, partly in the works of Tim\r\nBobbin, but in a very much better and more instructive form in the\r\nadmirable writings of one of my oldest and most valued friends, who is\r\nnow upon this platform. But if we should not find the people of New York\r\nspeaking Lancashire, we should find them speaking English. And if we\r\nfollowed a little further, and asked them what they read, we should find\r\nthat they read all the books that we read that are worth reading, and a\r\ngood many of their own, some of which have not yet reached us; that\r\nthere are probably more readers in the United States of Milton, and\r\nShakespeare, and Dryden, and Pope, and Byron, and Wordsworth, and\r\nTennyson, than are to be found in this country; because, I think, it\r\nwill probably be admitted by everybody who understands the facts of both\r\ncountries, that out of the twenty millions of population in the Free\r\nStates of America, there are more persons who can read well than there\r\nare in the thirty millions of population of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nAnd if we leave their literature and turn to their laws, we shall find\r\nthat their laws have the same basis as ours, and that many of the great\r\nand memorable judgments of our greatest judges and lawyers are of high\r\nauthority with them. If we come to that priceless possession which we\r\nhave perhaps more clearly established than any other people in Europe,\r\nthat of personal freedom, we shall find that in the Free States of\r\nAmerica personal freedom is as much known, as well established, as fully\r\nappreciated, and as completely enjoyed as it is now in this country. And\r\nif we come to the form of their government, we shall find that it is in\r\nits principle, in its essence, not very dissimilar from that which our\r\nConstitution professes in this kingdom. The difference is this, that our\r\nConstitution has never yet been fully enjoyed by the people; the House\r\nin which forty-eight hours hence I may be sitting, is not as full and\r\nfair and free a representation of the people as is the House of\r\nRepresentatives that assembles at Washington. But, if there be\r\ndifferences, are there not great points of agreement, and are there any\r\nof these differences that justify us or them in regarding either nation\r\nas foreign or hostile?\r\n\r\nNow, the people of Europe owe much more than they are often aware of to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States of America, and to the existence\r\nof that great Republic. The United States have been in point of fact an\r\nark of refuge to the people of Europe, when fleeing from the storms and\r\nthe revolutions of the old continent. They have been, as far as the\r\nartisans and labouring population of this country are concerned, a life-\r\nboat to them; and they have saved hundreds of thousands of men and of\r\nfamilies from disastrous shipwreck. The existence of that free country\r\nand that free government has had a prodigious influence upon freedom in\r\nEurope and in England. If you could have before you a chart of the\r\ncondition of Europe when the United States became a nation, and another\r\nchart of the condition of Europe now, you would see the difference, the\r\nenormous stride which has been made in Europe; and you may rely upon it\r\nthat not a little of it has been occasioned by the influence of the\r\ngreat example of that country, free in its political institutions beyond\r\nall other countries, and yet maintaining its course in peace, preserving\r\norder, and conferring upon all its people a degree of prosperity which\r\nin these old countries is as yet unknown.\r\n\r\nI should like now to speak specially to the working men who are here,\r\nwho have no capital but their skill and their industry and their bodily\r\nstrength. In fifteen years from 1845 to 1860--and this is a fact which I\r\nstated in this room more than a year ago, when speaking on the question\r\nof America, but it is a fact which every working man ought to have in\r\nhis mind always when he is considering what America is--in fifteen years\r\nthere have emigrated to the United States from Great Britain and Ireland\r\nnot less than two million four hundred thousand persons. Millions are\r\neasily spoken, not easily counted, with great difficulty comprehended;\r\nbut the twenty-four hundred thousand persons that I have described means\r\na population equal to not less than sixty towns, every one of them of\r\nthe size and population of Rochdale. And every one of these men who have\r\nemigrated, as he crossed the Atlantic--if he went by steam, in a\r\nfortnight, and if he went by sails, in a month or five weeks--found\r\nhimself in a country where to his senses a vast revolution had taken\r\nplace, comprehending all that men anticipate from any kind of revolution\r\nthat shall advance political and social equality in their own land--a\r\nrevolution which commenced in the War of Independence, which has been\r\ngoing on, and which has been confirmed by all that has transpired in\r\nsubsequent years.\r\n\r\nHe does not find that he belongs to what are called the 'lower classes;'\r\nhe is not shut out from any of the rights of citizenship; he is admitted\r\nto the full enjoyment of all political privileges, as far as they are\r\nextended to any portion of the population; and he has there advantages\r\nwhich the people of this country have not yet gained, because we are but\r\ngradually making our way out of the darkness and the errors and the\r\ntyrannies of past ages. But in America he finds the land not cursed with\r\nfeudalism; it is free to every man to buy and sell, and possess and\r\ntransmit. He finds in the town in which he lives that the noblest\r\nbuildings are the school-houses to which his children are freely\r\nadmitted. And among those twenty millions--for I am now confining my\r\nobservations to the Free States--the son of every man has easy admission\r\nto school, has fair opportunity for improvement; and, if God has gifted\r\nhim with power of head and of heart; there is nothing of usefulness,\r\nnothing of greatness, nothing of success in that country to which he may\r\nnot fairly aspire.\r\n\r\nAnd, Sir, this makes a difference between that country and this, on\r\nwhich I must say another word. One of the most painful things to my mind\r\nto be seen in England is this, that amongst the great body of those\r\nclasses which earn their living by their daily labour--it is\r\nparticularly observable in the agricultural districts, and it is too\r\nmuch to be observed even in our own districts--there is an absence of\r\nthat hope which every man ought to have in his soul that there is for\r\nhim, if he be industrious and frugal, a comfortable independence as he\r\nadvances in life. In the United States that hope prevails everywhere,\r\nbecause everywhere there is an open career; there is no privileged\r\nclass; there is complete education extended to all, and every man feels\r\nthat he was not born to be in penury and in suffering, but that there is\r\nno point in the social ladder to which he may not fairly hope to raise\r\nhimself by his honest efforts.\r\n\r\nWell, looking at all this--and I have but touched on some very prominent\r\nfacts--I should say that it offers to us every motive, not for fear, not\r\nfor jealousy, not for hatred, but rather for admiration, gratitude, and\r\nfriendship. I am persuaded of this as much as I am of anything that I\r\nknow or believe, that the more perfect the friendship that is\r\nestablished between the people of England and the free people of\r\nAmerica, the more you will find your path of progress here made easy for\r\nyou, and the more will social and political liberty advance amongst us.\r\n\r\nBut this country which I have been in part describing is now the scene\r\nof one of the greatest calamities that can afflict mankind. After\r\nseventy years of almost uninterrupted peace, it has become the scene of\r\na civil war, more gigantic, perhaps, than any that we have any record of\r\nwith regard to any other nation or any other people; for the scene of\r\nthis warfare is so extended as to embrace a region almost equal in size\r\nto the whole of Europe. At this very moment military operations are\r\nbeing undertaken at points as distant from each other as Madrid is\r\ndistant from Moscow. But this great strife cannot have arisen amongst an\r\neducated and intelligent people without some great and overruling cause.\r\nLet us for a moment examine that cause, and let us ask ourselves whether\r\nit is possible at such a time to stand neutral in regard to the\r\ncontending parties, and to refuse our sympathy to one or the other of\r\nthem. I find men sometimes who profess a strict neutrality; they wish\r\nneither the one thing nor the other. This arises either from the fact\r\nthat they are profoundly ignorant with regard to this matter, or else\r\nthat they sympathise with the South, but are rather ashamed to admit it.\r\n\r\nThere are two questions concerned in this struggle. Hitherto, generally,\r\none only has been discussed. There is the question whether negro slavery\r\nshall continue to be upheld amongst Christian nations, or whether it\r\nshall be entirely abolished. Because, bear in mind that if the result of\r\nthe struggle that is now proceeding in America should abolish slavery\r\nwithin the territories of the United States, then soon after slavery in\r\nBrazil, and slavery in Cuba, will also fall. I was speaking the other\r\nday to a gentleman well acquainted with Cuban affairs; he is often in\r\nthe habit of seeing persons who come from Cuba to this country on\r\nbusiness; and I asked him what his Cuban friends said of what was going\r\non in America. He said, 'They speak of it with the greatest\r\napprehension; all the property of Cuba,' he said, 'is based on slavery;\r\nand they say that if slavery comes to an end in America, as they believe\r\nit will, through this war, slavery will have a very short life in Cuba.'\r\nTherefore, the question which is being now tried is, not merely whether\r\nfour millions of slaves in America shall be free, but whether the vast\r\nnumber of slaves (I know not the number) in Cuba and Brazil shall also\r\nbe liberated.\r\n\r\nBut there is another question besides that of the negro, and which to\r\nyou whom I am now addressing is scarcely less important. I say that the\r\nquestion of freedom to men of all races is deeply involved in this great\r\nstrife in the United States. I said I wanted the working men of this\r\naudience to listen to my statement, because it is to them that I\r\nparticularly wish to address myself. I say, that not only is the\r\nquestion of negro slavery concerned in this struggle, but, if we are to\r\ntake the opinion of leading writers and men in the Southern States of\r\nAmerica, the freedom of white men is not safe in their hands. Now, I\r\nwill not trouble you with pages of extracts which would confirm all that\r\nI am about to say, but I shall read you two or three short ones which\r\nwill explain exactly what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe city of Richmond, as you know, is the capital of what is called the\r\nSouthern Confederacy. In that city a newspaper is published, called the\r\n_Richmond Examiner_, which is one of the most able, and perhaps\r\nabout the most influential, paper published in the Slave States. Listen\r\nto what the _Richmond Examiner_ says:--\r\n\r\n  The experiment of universal liberty has failed. The evils of free\r\n  society are insufferable. Free society in the long run is\r\n  impracticable; it is everywhere starving, demoralizing, and\r\n  insurrectionary. Policy and humanity alike forbid the extension\r\n  of its evils to new peoples and to coming generations; and\r\n  therefore free society must fall and give way to a slave society--\r\n  a social system old as the world, universal as man.'\r\n\r\nWell, on another occasion, the same paper treats the subject in this\r\nway. The writer says:--\r\n\r\n  'Hitherto the defence of slavery has encountered great\r\n  difficulties, because its apologists stopped half way. They\r\n  confined the defence of slavery to negro slavery alone,\r\n  abandoning the principle of slavery, and admitting that every\r\n  other form of slavery was wrong. Now the line of defence is\r\n  changed. The South maintains that slavery is just, natural, and\r\n  necessary, and that it does not depend on the difference of\r\n  complexions.'\r\n\r\nBut following up this is an extract from a speech by a Mr. Cobb, who is\r\nan eminent man in Southern politics and in Southern opinion. He says:--\r\n\r\n  'There is, perhaps, no solution of the great problem of\r\n  reconciling the interests of labour and capital, so as to protect\r\n  each from the encroachments and oppressions of the other, so\r\n  simple and effective as negro slavery. By making the labourer\r\n  himself capital, the conflict ceases, and the interests become\r\n  identical.'\r\n\r\nNow, I do not know whether there is any working man here who does not\r\nfully or partly realize the meaning of those extracts. They mean this,\r\nthat if a man in this neighbourhood (for they pity us very much in our\r\nbenighted condition as regards capital and labour, and they have an\r\nadmirable way, from their view, of putting an end to strikes)--they say\r\nthat, if a man in this neighbourhood had ten thousand pounds sterling in\r\na cotton or woollen factory, and he employed a hundred men, women, and\r\nchildren, that instead of paying them whatever wages had been agreed\r\nupon, allowing them to go to the other side of the town, and work where\r\nthey liked, or to move to another county, or to emigrate to America, or\r\nto have any kind of will or wish whatever with regard to their own\r\ndisposal, that they should be to him capital, just the same as the\r\nhorses are in his stable; that he should sell the husband South,--\r\n'South' in America means something very dreadful to the negro,--that\r\nthey should sell the wife if they liked, that they should sell the\r\nchildren, that, in point of fact, they should do whatsoever they liked\r\nwith them, and that, if any one of them resisted any punishment which\r\nthe master chose to inflict, the master should be held justified if he\r\nbeat his slave to death; and that not one of those men should have the\r\npower to give evidence in any court of justice, in any case, against a\r\nwhite man, however much he might have suffered from that white man.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that this most important paper in the South writes for\r\nthat principle, and this eminent Southern politician indorses it, and\r\nthinks it a cure for all the evils which exist in the Old World and in\r\nthe Northern and Free States; and there is not a paper in the South, nor\r\nis there a man as eminent or more eminent than Mr. Cobb, who has dared\r\nto write or speak in condemnation of the atrocity of that language. I\r\nbelieve this great strife to have had its origin in an infamous\r\nconspiracy against the rights of human nature. Those principles, which\r\nthey distinctly avow and proclaim, are not to be found, as far as I\r\nknow, in the pages of any heathen writer of old times, nor are they to\r\nbe discovered in the teachings or the practice of savage nations in our\r\ntimes. It is the doctrine of devils, and not of men; and all mankind\r\nshould shudder at the enormity of the guilt which the leaders of this\r\nconspiracy have brought upon that country.\r\n\r\nNow, let us look at two or three facts, which seem to me very\r\nremarkable, on the surface of the case, but which there are men in this\r\ncountry, and I am told they may be found even in this town, who\r\naltogether ignore and deny. The war was not commenced by those to whom\r\nyour resolution refers; it was commenced by the South; they rebelled\r\nagainst the majority. It was not a rebellion against a monarchy, or an\r\naristocracy, or some other form of government which has its hold upon\r\npeople, sometimes by services, but often from tradition; but it was\r\nagainst a Government of their own, and a compact of their own, that they\r\nviolently rebelled, and for the expressed and avowed purpose of\r\nmaintaining the institution of slavery, and for the purpose, not\r\ndisavowed, of re-opening the slave trade, and, as these extracts show,\r\nif their principles should be fully carried out, of making bondage\r\nuniversal among all classes of labourers and artisans. When I say that\r\ntheir object was to re-open the slave trade, do not for a moment imagine\r\nthat I am overstating the case against them. They argue, with a perfect\r\nlogic, that, if slavery was right, the slave trade could not be wrong;\r\nif the slave trade be wrong, slavery cannot be right; and that if it be\r\nlawful and moral to go to the State of Virginia and buy a slave for two\r\nthousand dollars, and take him to Louisiana, it cannot be wrong to go to\r\nAfrica, and buy a slave for fifty dollars, and take him to Louisiana.\r\nThat was their argument; it is an argument to this day, and is an\r\nargument that in my opinion no man can controvert; and the lawful\r\nexistence of slavery is as a matter of course to be followed, and would\r\nbe followed, wherever there was the power, by the re-opening of the\r\ntraffic in negroes from Africa.\r\n\r\nThat is not all these people have done. Reference has been made, in the\r\nresolution and in the speeches, to the distress which prevails in this\r\ndistrict, and you are told, and have been told over and over again, that\r\nall this distress has arisen from the blockade of the ports of the\r\nSouthern States. There is at least one great port from which in past\r\ntimes two millions of bales of cotton a-year have found their way to\r\nEurope--the port of New Orleans--which is blockaded; and the United\r\nStates Government has proclaimed that any cotton that is sent from the\r\ninterior to New Orleans for shipment, although it belongs to persons in\r\narms against the Government, shall yet be permitted to go to Europe, and\r\nthey shall receive unmolested the proceeds of the sale of that cotton.\r\nBut still the cotton does not come. The reason why it does not come is,\r\nnot because it would do harm to the United States Government for it to\r\ncome, or that it would in any way assist the United States Government in\r\ncarrying on the war. The reason that it does not come is, because its\r\nbeing kept back is supposed to be a way of influencing public opinion in\r\nEngland and the course of the English Government in reference to the\r\nAmerican war. They burn the cotton that they may injure us, and they\r\ninjure us because they think that we cannot live even for a year without\r\ntheir cotton; and that to get it we should send ships of war, break the\r\nblockade, make war upon the North, and assist the slave-owners to\r\nmaintain, or to obtain, their independence.\r\n\r\nNow, with regard to the question of American cotton, one or two extracts\r\nwill be sufficient; but I could give you a whole pamphlet of them, if it\r\nwere necessary. Mr. Mann, an eminent person in the State of Georgia,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  'With the failure of the cotton, England fails. Stop her supply\r\n  of Southern slave-grown cotton, and her factories stop, her\r\n  commerce stops, the healthful normal circulation of her life-\r\n  blood stops.'\r\n\r\nAgain he says:--\r\n\r\n  'In one year from the stoppage of England's supply of Southern\r\n  slave-grown cotton, the Chartists would be in all her streets and\r\n  fields, revolution would be rampant throughout the island, and\r\n  nothing that is would exist.'\r\n\r\nHe also says, addressing an audience:--\r\n\r\n  'Why, Sirs, British lords hold their lands, British bishops hold\r\n  their revenues, Victoria holds her sceptre, by the grace of\r\n  cotton, as surely as by the grace of God.'\r\n\r\nSenator Wigfall says:--\r\n\r\n  'If we stop the supply of cotton for one week, England would be\r\n  starving. Queen Victoria's crown would not stand on her head one\r\n  week, if the supply of cotton was stopped; nor would her head\r\n  stand on her shoulders.'\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens, who is the Vice-President of the Southern Confederacy,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  'There will be revolution in Europe, there will be starvation\r\n  there; our cotton is the element that will do it.'\r\n\r\nNow, I am not stating the mere result of any discovery of my own, but it\r\nwould be impossible to read the papers of the South, or the speeches\r\nmade in the South, before, and at the time of, and after the secession,\r\nwithout seeing that the universal opinion there was, that the stoppage\r\nof the supply of cotton would be our instantaneous ruin, and that if\r\nthey could only lay hold of it, keep it back in the country, or burn it,\r\nso that it never could be used, that then the people of Lancashire,\r\nmerchants, manufacturers, and operatives in mills--everybody dependent\r\nupon this vast industry--would immediately arise and protest against the\r\nEnglish Government abstaining for one moment from the recognition of the\r\nSouth, from war with the North, and from a resolution to do the utmost\r\nthat we could to create a slave-holding independent republic in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nAnd these very men who have been wishing to drag us into a war that\r\nwould have covered us with everlasting infamy, have sent their envoys to\r\nthis country, Mr. Yancey, Mr. Mann (I do not know whether or not the\r\nsame Mr. Mann to whom I have been referring), and Mr. Mason, the author\r\nof the Fugitive Slave Law. These men have been in this country,--one of\r\nthem I believe is here now,--envoys sent to offer friendship to the\r\nQueen of England, to be received at her Court, and to make friends with\r\nthe great men in London. They come,--I have seen them under the gallery\r\nof the House of Commons; I have seen Members of the House shaking hands\r\nwith them and congratulating them, if there has been some military\r\nsuccess on their side, and receiving them as if they were here from the\r\nmost honourable Government, and with the most honourable mission. Why,\r\nthe thing which they have broken off from the United States to maintain,\r\nis felony by your law. They are not only slave owners, slave buyers and\r\nsellers, but that which out of Pandemonium itself was never before\r\nconceived,--they are slave breeders for the slave market; and these men\r\nhave come to your country, and are to be met with at elegant tables in\r\nLondon, and are in fast friendship with some of your public men, and are\r\nconstantly found in some of your newspaper offices; and they are here to\r\nask Englishmen--Englishmen with a history of freedom--to join hands with\r\ntheir atrocious conspiracy.\r\n\r\nI regret more than I have words to express this painful fact, that of\r\nall the countries in Europe this country is the only one which has men\r\nin it who are willing to take active steps in favour of this intended\r\nslave government. We supply the ships; we supply the arms, the munitions\r\nof war; we give aid and comfort to this foulest of all crimes.\r\nEnglishmen only do it. I believe you have not seen a single statement in\r\nthe newspapers that any French, or Belgian, or Dutch, or Russian ship\r\nhas been engaged in, or seized whilst attempting to violate the blockade\r\nand to carry arms to the South. They are English Liberal newspapers only\r\nwhich support this stupendous iniquity. They are English statesmen only,\r\nwho profess to be liberal, who have said a word to favour the authors of\r\nthis now--enacting revolution in America.\r\n\r\nThe other day, not a week since, a member of the present Government,--he\r\nis not a statesman--he is the son of a great statesman, and occupies the\r\nposition of Secretary for Ireland,--he dared to say to an English\r\naudience that he wished the Republic to be divided, and that the South\r\nshould become an independent State. If that island which--I suppose in\r\npunishment for some of its offences--has been committed to his care,--if\r\nthat island were to attempt to secede, not to set up a slave kingdom,\r\nbut a kingdom more free than it has ever yet been, the Government of\r\nwhich he is a member would sack its cities and drench its soil with\r\nblood before they would allow such a kingdom to be established.\r\n\r\nBut the working men of England, and I will say it too for the great body\r\nof the middle classes of England, have not been wrong upon this great\r\nquestion. As for you,--men labouring from morn till night that you may\r\nhonourably and honestly maintain your families, and the independence of\r\nyour households,--you are too slowly emerging from a condition of things\r\nfar from independent--far from free--for you to have sympathy with this\r\nfearful crime which I have been describing. You come, as it were, from\r\nbonds yourselves, and you can sympathize with them who are still in\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nSee that meeting that was held in Manchester a month ago, in the Free\r\nTrade Hall, of five or six thousand men. See the address which they\r\nthere carried unanimously to the President of the United States. See\r\nthat meeting held the other night in Exeter Hall, in London; that vast\r\nroom, the greatest room, I suppose, in the Metropolis, filled so much\r\nthat its overflowings filled another large room in the same building,\r\nand when that was full, the further overflowings filled the street; and\r\nin both rooms, and in the street, speeches were made on this great\r\nquestion. But what is said by the writers in this infamous Southern\r\npress in this country with regard to that meeting? Who was there? 'A\r\ngentleman who had written a novel, and two or three Dissenting\r\nministers,' I shall not attempt any defence of those gentlemen. What\r\nthey do, they do openly, in the face of day; and if they utter\r\nsentiments on this question, it is from a public platform, with\r\nthousands of their countrymen gazing into their faces. These men who\r\nslander them write behind a mask,--and, what is more, they dare not tell\r\nin the open day that which they write in the columns of their journal.\r\nBut if it be true that there is nothing in the writer of a successful\r\nnovel, or in two or three pious and noble-minded Dissenting ministers,\r\nto collect a great audience, what does it prove if there was a great\r\naudience? It only proves that they were not collected by the reputation\r\nof any orator who was expected to address them, but by their cordial and\r\nardent sympathy for the great cause which was pleaded before them.\r\n\r\nEverybody now that I meet says to me, 'Public opinion seems to have\r\nundergone a considerable change.' The fact is, people do not know very\r\nmuch about America. They are learning more every day. They have been\r\ngreatly misled by what are called 'the best public instructors.'\r\nJefferson, who was one of the greatest men that the United States have\r\nproduced, said that newspapers should be divided into four compartments:\r\nin one of them they should print the true; in the next, the probable; in\r\nthe third, the possible; and in the fourth, the lies. With regard to\r\nsome of these newspapers, I incline to think, as far as their leading\r\ncolumns go, that an equal division of space would be found very\r\ninconvenient, and that the last-named compartment, when dealing with\r\nAmerican questions, would have to be at least four times as large as the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nComing back to the question of this war; I admit, of course--everybody\r\nmust admit--that we are not responsible for it, for its commencement, or\r\nfor the manner in which it is conducted; nor can we be responsible for\r\nits result. But there is one thing which we are responsible for, and\r\nthat is for our sympathies, for the manner in which we regard it, and\r\nfor the tone in which we discuss it. What shall we say, then, with\r\nregard to it? On which side shall we stand? I do not believe it is\r\npossible to be strictly, coldly neutral. The question at issue is too\r\ngreat, the contest is too grand in the eye of the world. It is\r\nimpossible for any man, who can have an opinion worth anything on any\r\nquestion, not to have some kind of an opinion on the question of this\r\nwar. I am not ashamed of my opinion, or of the sympathy which I feel,\r\nand have over and over again expressed, on the side of the free North. I\r\ncannot understand how any man witnessing what is enacting on the\r\nAmerican continent can indulge in small cavils against the free people\r\nof the North, and close his eye entirely to the enormity of the purposes\r\nof the South. I cannot understand how any Englishman, who in past years\r\nhas been accustomed to say that 'there was one foul blot upon the fair\r\nfame of the American Republic,' can now express any sympathy for those\r\nwho would perpetuate and extend that blot. And, more, if we profess to\r\nbe, though it be with imperfect and faltering steps, the followers of\r\nHim who declared it to be His Divine mission 'to heal the broken-\r\nhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight\r\nto the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,' must we not\r\nreject with indignation and scorn the proffered alliance and friendship\r\nwith a power based on human bondage, and which contemplates the\r\noverthrow and the extinction of the dearest rights of the most helpless\r\nof mankind?\r\n\r\nIf we are the friends of freedom, personal and political,--and we all\r\nprofess to be so, and most of us, more or less, are striving after it\r\nmore completely for our own country,--how can we withhold our sympathy\r\nfrom a Government and a people amongst whom white men have always been\r\nfree, and who are now offering an equal freedom to the black? I advise\r\nyou not to believe in the 'destruction' of the American nation. If facts\r\nshould happen by any chance to force you to believe it, do not commit\r\nthe crime of wishing it. I do not blame men who draw different\r\nconclusions from mine from the facts, and who believe that the\r\nrestoration of the Union is impossible. As the facts lie before our\r\nsenses, so must we form a judgment on them. But I blame those men that\r\nwish for such a catastrophe. For myself, I have never despaired, and I\r\nwill not despair. In the language of one of our old poets, who wrote, I\r\nthink, more than three hundred years ago, I will not despair,--\r\n\r\n  'For I have seen a ship in haven fall,\r\n  After the storm had broke both mast and shroud.'\r\n\r\nFrom the very outburst of this great convulsion, I have had but one hope\r\nand one faith, and it is this--that the result of this stupendous strife\r\nmay be to make freedom the heritage for ever of a whole continent, and\r\nthat the grandeur and the prosperity of the American Union may never be\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE IN AMERICA.\r\nST. JAMES'S HALL, MARCH 26, 1863.\r\n\r\n[The meeting at which this speech was delivered was convened by the\r\nTrades' Unions of London to enable the working men to express their\r\nsentiments on the war in the United States. Mr. Bright was Chairman of\r\nthe meeting.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Committee did me the honour to ask me to attend this meeting\r\nto-night and to take the Chair, I felt that I was not at liberty to\r\nrefuse, for I considered that there was something remarkable in the\r\ncharacter of this meeting; and I need not tell you that the cause which\r\nwe are assembled to discuss is one which excites my warmest sympathies.\r\nThis meeting is remarkable, inasmuch as it is not what is commonly\r\ncalled a public meeting, but it is a meeting, as you have seen from the\r\nannouncements and advertisements by which it has been called--it is a\r\nmeeting of members of Trades' Unions and Trades' Societies in London.\r\nThe members of these Societies have not usually stepped out from their\r\nordinary business to take part in meetings of this kind on public\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe subject which we have met to discuss is one of surpassing interest--\r\nwhich excites at this moment, and has excited for two years past, the\r\nattention and the astonishment of the civilized world. We see a country\r\nwhich for many years--during the lifetime of the oldest amongst us--has\r\nbeen the most peaceful, and prosperous, and the most free amongst the\r\ngreat nations of the earth--we see it plunged at once into the midst of\r\na sanguinary revolution, whose proportions are so gigantic as to dwarf\r\nall other revolutionary records and events of which we have any\r\nknowledge. But I do not wonder at this revolution. No man can read the\r\nhistory of the United States from the time when they ceased to be\r\ndependent colonies of England, without discovering that at the birth of\r\nthat great Republic there was sown the seed, if not of its dissolution,\r\nat least of its extreme peril; and the infant giant in its cradle may be\r\nsaid to have been rocked under the shadow of the cypress, which is the\r\nsymbol of mortality and of the tomb.\r\n\r\nColonial weakness, when face to face with British strength, made it\r\nimpossible to put an end to slavery, or to establish a republic free\r\nfrom slavery. To meet England, it was necessary to be united, and to be\r\nunited it was necessary to tolerate slavery; and from that hour to this--\r\nat least, to a period within the last two or three years--the love of\r\nthe Union and the patriotism of the American people have induced them\r\nconstantly to make concessions to slavery, because they knew that when\r\nthey ceased to make concessions they ran the peril of that disruption\r\nwhich has now arrived; and they dreaded the destruction of their country\r\neven more than they hated the evil of slavery. But these concessions\r\nfailed, as I believe concessions to evil always do fail. These\r\nconcessions failed to secure safety in that Union. There were principles\r\nat war which were wholly irreconcilable. The South, as you know, has\r\nbeen engaged for fifty years in building fresh ramparts by which it may\r\ndefend its institutions. The North has been growing yearly greater in\r\nfreedom; and though the conflict might be postponed, it was obviously\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nIn our day, then, that which the statesmen of America have hoped\r\npermanently to postpone has arrived. The great trial is now going on in\r\nthe sight of the world, and the verdict upon this great question must at\r\nlast be rendered. But how much is at stake? Some men of this country,\r\nsome writers, treat it as if, after all, it was no great matter that had\r\ncaused this contest in the United States. I say that a whole continent\r\nis at stake. It is not a question of boundary; it is not a question of\r\ntariff; it is not a question of supremacy of party, or even of the\r\ncondition of four millions of negroes. It is more than that. It is a\r\nquestion of a whole continent, with its teeming millions, and what shall\r\nbe their present and their future fate. It is for these millions freedom\r\nor slavery, education or ignorance, light or darkness, Christian\r\nmorality ever widening and all-blessing in its influence, or an\r\novershadowing and all-blasting guilt.\r\n\r\nThere are men, good men, who say that we in England, who are opposed to\r\nwar, should take no public part in this great question. Only yesterday I\r\nreceived from a friend of mine, whose fidelity I honour, a letter, in\r\nwhich he asked me whether I thought, with the views which he supposed I\r\nentertain on the question of war, it was fitting that I should appear at\r\nsuch a meeting as this. It is not our war; we did not make it. We deeply\r\nlament it. It is not in our power to bring it to a close; but I know not\r\nthat we are called upon to shut our eyes and to close our hearts to the\r\ngreat issues which are depending upon it. Now we are met here, let us\r\nask each other some questions. Has England any opinion with regard to\r\nthis American question? Has England any sympathy, on one side or the\r\nother, with either party in this great struggle? But, to come nearer, I\r\nwould ask whether this meeting has any opinion upon it, and whether our\r\nsympathies have been stirred in relation to it? It is true, to this\r\nmeeting not many rich, not many noble, have been called. It is a meeting\r\ncomposed of artisans and working men of the city of London,--men whose\r\nlabour, in combination with capital and directing skill, has built this\r\ngreat city, and has made England great. I address myself to these men. I\r\nask them--I ask you--have you any special interest in this contest?\r\n\r\nPrivilege thinks it has a great interest in it, and every morning, with\r\nblatant voice, it comes into your streets and curses the American\r\nRepublic. Privilege has beheld an afflicting spectacle for many years\r\npast. It has beheld thirty millions of men, happy and prosperous,\r\nwithout emperor, without king, without the surroundings of a court,\r\nwithout nobles, except such as are made by eminence in intellect and\r\nvirtue, without State bishops and State priests,--\r\n\r\n  'Sole venders of the lore which works salvation,'--\r\n\r\nwithout great armies and great navies, without great debt and without\r\ngreat taxes. Privilege has shuddered at what might happen to old Europe\r\nif this grand experiment should succeed. But you, the workers,--you,\r\nstriving after a better time,--you, struggling upwards towards the\r\nlight, with slow and painful steps,--you have no cause to look with\r\njealousy upon a country which, amongst all the great nations of the\r\nglobe, is that one where labour has met with the highest honour, and\r\nwhere it has reaped its greatest reward. Are you aware of the fact, that\r\nin fifteen years, which is but as yesterday when it is past, two and a\r\nhalf millions of your countrymen have found a home in the United\r\nStates,--that a population equal nearly, if not quite, to the population\r\nof this great city--itself equal to no mean kingdom--has emigrated from\r\nthese shores? In the United States there has been, as you know, an open\r\ndoor for every man,--and millions have entered into it, and have found\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nNow, take the two sections of the country which are engaged in this\r\nfearful struggle. In the one, labour is honoured more than elsewhere in\r\nthe world; there, more than in any other country, men rise to competence\r\nand independence; a career is open; the pursuit of happiness is not\r\nhopelessly thwarted by the law. In the other section of that country,\r\nlabour is not only not honoured, but it is degraded. The labourer is\r\nmade a chattel. He is no more his own than the horse that drags a\r\ncarriage through the next street; nor is his wife, nor is his child, nor\r\nis anything that is his, his own. And if you have not heard the\r\nastounding statement, it may be as well for a moment to refer to it,--\r\nthat it is not black men only who should be slaves. Only to-day I read\r\nfrom one of the Southern papers a statement that--\r\n\r\n  'Slavery in the Jewish times was not the slavery of negroes; and\r\n  therefore, if you confine slavery to negroes, you lose your sheet\r\n  anchor, which is the Bible-argument in favour of slavery.'\r\n\r\nI think nothing can be more fitting for the discussion of the members of\r\nthe Trade Societies of London. You in your Trade Societies help each\r\nother when you are sick, or if you meet with accidents. You do many kind\r\nacts amongst each other. You have other business also; you have to\r\nmaintain what you believe to be the just rights of industry and of your\r\nseparate trades; and sometimes, as you know, you do things which many\r\npeople do not approve, and which, probably, when you come to think more\r\ncoolly of them, you may even doubt the wisdom of yourselves. That is\r\nonly saying that you are not immaculate, and that your wisdom, like the\r\nwisdom of other classes, is not absolutely perfect. But they have in the\r\nSouthern States a specific for all the differences between capital and\r\nlabour. They say,--\r\n\r\n  'Make the labourer capital; the free system in Europe is a rotten\r\n  system; let us get rid of that, and make all the labourers as\r\n  much capital and as much the property of the capitalist and\r\n  employer as the capitalist's cattle and horses are property, and\r\n  then the whole system will move with that perfect ease and\r\n  harmony which the world admires so much in the Southern States of\r\n  America.'\r\n\r\nI believe there never was a question submitted to the public opinion of\r\nthe world which it was more becoming the working men and members of\r\nTrades' Unions and Trade Societies of every kind in this country fully\r\nto consider, than this great question.\r\n\r\nBut there may be some in this room, and there are some who say to me,\r\n'But what is to become of our trade, what is to become of the capitalist\r\nand the labourer of Lancashire?' I am not sure that much of the capital\r\nof Lancashire will not be ruined. I am not sure that very large numbers\r\nof its population will not have to remove to seek other employment,\r\neither in this or some other country. I am not one of those who\r\nunderrate this great calamity. On the contrary, I have scarcely met with\r\nany man,--not more than half a dozen,--since this distress in our county\r\nbegan, who has been willing to measure the magnitude of this calamity\r\naccording to the scale with which I have viewed it.\r\n\r\nBut let us examine this question. The distress of Lancashire comes from\r\na failure of the supply of cotton. The failure of the supply of cotton\r\ncomes from the war in the United States. The war in the United States\r\nhas originated in the effort of the slaveholders of that country to\r\nbreak up what they themselves admit to be the freest and best government\r\nthat ever existed, for the sole purpose of making perpetual the\r\ninstitution of slavery. But if the South began the war, and created all\r\nthe mischief, does it look reasonable that we should pat them on the\r\nback, and be their friends? If they have destroyed cotton, or withheld\r\nit, shall we therefore take them to our bosoms?\r\n\r\nI have a letter written by an agent in the city of Nashville, who had\r\nbeen accustomed to buy cotton there before the war, and who returned\r\nthere immediately after that city came into the possession of the\r\nNorthern forces. He began his trade, and cotton came in. Not Union\r\nplanters only, but Secession planters, began to bring in the produce of\r\ntheir plantations, and he had a fair chance of re-establishing his\r\nbusiness; but the moment this was discovered by the commanders of the\r\nSouthern forces at some distance from the city, they issued the most\r\nperemptory orders that every boat-load of cotton on the rivers, every\r\nwaggon-load upon the roads, and every car-load upon the railroads, that\r\nwas leaving any plantations for the purposes of sale, should be\r\nimmediately destroyed. The result was, that the cotton trade was at once\r\nagain put an end to, and I believe only to a very small extent has it\r\nbeen reopened, even to this hour.\r\n\r\nThen take the State of New Orleans, which, as you know, has been now for\r\nmany months in the possession of the Northern forces. The Northern\r\ncommanders there had issued announcements that any cotton sent down to\r\nNew Orleans for exportation, even though it came from the most resolved\r\nfriends of secession in the district, should still be safe. It might be\r\npurchased to ship to Europe, and the proceeds of that cotton might be\r\nreturned, and the trade be re-opened. But you have not found cotton come\r\ndown to New Orleans, although its coming there under those terms would\r\nbe of no particular advantage to the North. It has been withheld with\r\nthis single object, to create in the manufacturing districts of France\r\nand England a state of suffering that might at last become unbearable,\r\nand thus might compel the Governments of those countries, in spite of\r\nall that international law may teach, in spite of all that morality may\r\nenjoin upon them, to take sides with the South, and go to war with the\r\nNorth for the sake of liberating whatever cotton there is now in the\r\nplantations of the Secession States.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, such of you as read the City articles of the daily\r\npapers will see that a loan has been contracted for in the City, to the\r\namount of three millions sterling, on behalf of the Southern\r\nConfederacy. It is not brought into the market by any firm with an\r\nEnglish name; but I am sorry to be obliged to believe that many\r\nEnglishmen have taken portions of that loan. Now the one great object of\r\nthat loan is this, to pay in this country for vessels which are being\r\nbuilt--_Alabamas_--from which it is hoped that so much irritation\r\nwill arise in the minds of the people of the Northern States, that\r\nEngland may be dragged into war to take sides with the South and with\r\nslavery. The South was naturally hostile to England, because England was\r\nhostile to slavery. Now the great hope of the insurrection has been from\r\nthe beginning, that Englishmen would not have fortitude to bear the\r\ncalamities which it has brought upon us; but by some trick or by some\r\naccident we might be brought into a war with the North, and thereby give\r\nstrength to the South.\r\n\r\nI should hope that this question is now so plain that most Englishmen\r\nmust understand it; and least of all do I expect that the six millions\r\nof men in the United Kingdom who are not enfranchised can have any doubt\r\nupon it. Their instincts are always right in the main, and if they get\r\nthe facts and information, I can rely on their influence being thrown\r\ninto the right scale. I wish I could state what would be as satisfactory\r\nto myself with regard to some others. There may be men outside, there\r\nare men sitting amongst your legislators, who will build and equip\r\ncorsair ships to prey upon the commerce of a friendly power,--who will\r\ndisregard the laws and the honour of their country,--who will trample on\r\nthe Proclamation of their sovereign,--and who, for the sake of the\r\nglittering profit which sometimes waits on crime, are content to cover\r\nthemselves with everlasting infamy. There may be men, too--rich men--in\r\nthis city of London, who will buy in the slaveowners' loan, and who, for\r\nthe chance of more gain than honest dealing will afford them, will help\r\na conspiracy whose fundamental institution, whose corner-stone, is\r\ndeclared to be felony, and infamous by the statutes of their country.\r\n\r\nI speak not to these men--I leave them to their conscience in that hour\r\nwhich comes to all of us, when conscience speaks and the soul is no\r\nlonger deaf to her voice. I speak rather to you, the working men of\r\nLondon, the representatives, as you are here to-night, of the feelings\r\nand the interests of the millions who cannot hear my voice. I wish you\r\nto be true to yourselves. Dynasties may fall, aristocracies may perish,\r\nprivilege will vanish into the dim past; but you, your children, and\r\nyour children's children, will remain, and from you the English people\r\nwill be continued to succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nYou wish the freedom of your country. You wish it for yourselves. You\r\nstrive for it in many ways. Do not then give the hand of fellowship to\r\nthe worst foes of freedom that the world has ever seen, and do not, I\r\nbeseech you, bring down a curse upon your cause which no after-penitence\r\ncan ever lift from it. You will not do this. I have faith in you.\r\nImpartial history will tell that, when your statesmen were hostile or\r\ncoldly neutral, when many of your rich men were corrupt, when your\r\npress--which ought to have instructed and defended--was mainly written\r\nto betray, the fate of a continent and of its vast population being in\r\nperil, you clung to freedom with an unfaltering trust that God in His\r\ninfinite mercy will yet make it the heritage of all His children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nLONDON, JUNE 16, 1863.\r\n[On June 16, 1863, a public meeting was held at the London Tavern, at\r\nthe instance of the Union and Emancipation Society, in order to hear an\r\naddress from Mr. M. D. Conway, of Eastern Virginia. Mr. Bright was in\r\nthe Chair.]\r\n\r\nIf we look back a little over two years--two years and a half--when the\r\nquestion of secession was first raised in a practical shape, I think we\r\nshall be able to remember that, when the news first arrived in England,\r\nthere was but one opinion with regard to it--that every man condemned\r\nthe folly and the wickedness of the South, and protested against their\r\nplea that they had any grievance which justified them in revolt--and\r\nevery man hoped that some mode might be discovered by which the terrible\r\ncalamity of war might be avoided.\r\n\r\nFor a time, many thought that there would be no war. Whilst the reins\r\nwere slipping from the hands--the too feeble hands--of Mr. Buchanan into\r\nthe grasp of President Lincoln, there was a moment when men thought that\r\nwe were about to see the wonderful example of a great question, which in\r\nall other countries would have involved a war, settled perhaps by\r\nmoderation--some moderation on one side, and some concession on the\r\nother; and so long as men believed that there would be no war, so long\r\neverybody condemned the South. We were afraid of a war in America,\r\nbecause we knew that one of the great industries of our country depended\r\nupon the continuous reception of its raw material from the Southern\r\nStates. But it was a folly--it was a gross absurdity--for any man to\r\nbelieve, with the history of the world before him, that the people, of\r\nthe Northern States, twenty millions, with their free Government, would\r\nfor one moment sit down satisfied with the dismemberment of their\r\ncountry, and make no answer to the war which had been commenced by the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nI speak not in justification of war. I am only treating this question\r\nupon principles which are almost universally acknowledged throughout the\r\nworld, and by an overwhelming majority even of those men who accept the\r\nChristian religion; and it is only upon those principles, so almost\r\nuniversally acknowledged, and acknowledged as much in this country as\r\nanywhere else--it is only just that we should judge the United States\r\nupon those principles upon which we in this country would be likely to\r\nact.\r\n\r\nBut the North did not yield to the dismemberment of their country, and\r\nthey did not allow a conspiracy of Southern politicians and slaveholders\r\nto seize their forts and arsenals without preparing for resistance.\r\nThen, when the people of England found that the North were about to\r\nresist, and that war was inevitable, they turned their eyes from the\r\nSouth, which was the beginner of the war, and looked to the North,\r\nsaying that, if the North would not resist, there could be no war, and\r\nthat we should get our cotton, and trade would go on as before; and\r\ntherefore, from that hour to this, not a few persons in this country,\r\nwho at first condemned the South, have been incessant in their\r\ncondemnation of the North.\r\n\r\nNow, I believe this is a fair statement of the feeling which prevailed\r\nwhen the first news of secession arrived, and of the change of opinion\r\nwhich took place in a few weeks, when it was found that, by the\r\nresolution of the North to maintain the integrity of their country, war,\r\nand civil war, was unavoidable. The trade interests of the country\r\naffected our opinion; and I fear did then prevent, and have since\r\nprevented, our doing justice to the people of the North.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to transport you, in mind, to Lancashire, and the\r\ninterests of Lancashire, which, after all, are the interests of the\r\nwhole United Kingdom, and clearly of not a few in this metropolis. What\r\nwas the condition of our greatest manufacturing industry before the war,\r\nand before secession had been practically attempted? It was this: that\r\nalmost ninety per cent. of all our cotton came from the Southern States\r\nof the American Union, and was, at least nine-tenths of it, the produce\r\nof the uncompensated labour of the negro.\r\n\r\nEverybody knew that we were carrying on a prodigious industry upon a\r\nmost insecure foundation; and it was the commonest thing in the world\r\nfor men who were discussing the present and the future of the cotton\r\ntrade, whether in Parliament or out of it, to point to the existence of\r\nslavery in the United States of America as the one dangerous thing in\r\nconnection with that great trade; and it was one of the reasons which\r\nstimulated me on several occasions to urge upon the Government of this\r\ncountry to improve the Government of India, and to give us a chance of\r\nreceiving a considerable portion of our supply from India, so that we\r\nmight not be left in absolute want when the calamity occurred, which all\r\nthoughtful men knew must some day come, in the United States.\r\n\r\nNow, I maintain that with a supply of cotton mainly derived from the\r\nSouthern States, and raised by slave labour, two things are\r\nindisputable: first, that the supply must always be insufficient; and\r\nsecond, that it must always be insecure. Perhaps many of you are not\r\naware that in the United States--I am speaking of the Slave States, and\r\nthe cotton-growing States--the quantity of land which is cultivated for\r\ncotton is a mere garden, a mere plot, in comparison with the whole of\r\nthe cotton region. I speak from the authority of a report lately\r\npresented to the Boston Chamber of Commerce, containing much important\r\ninformation on this question; and I believe that the whole acreage, or\r\nthe whole breadth of the land on which cotton is grown in America, does\r\nnot exceed ten thousand square miles--that is, a space one hundred miles\r\nlong and one hundred miles broad, or the size of two of our largest\r\ncounties in England; but the land of the ten chief cotton-producing\r\nStates is sixty times as much as that, being, I believe, about twelve\r\ntimes the size of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be, therefore, because there has not been land enough that we\r\nhave not in former years had cotton enough; it cannot be that there has\r\nnot been a demand for the produce of the land, for the demand has\r\nconstantly outstripped the supply; it has not been because the price has\r\nnot been sufficient, for, as is well known, the price has been much\r\nhigher of late years, and the profit to the planter much greater; and\r\nyet, notwithstanding the land and the demand, and the price and the\r\nprofit, the supply of cotton has not been sufficient for the wants of\r\nthe spinners and the manufacturers of the world, and for the wants of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe particular facts with regard to this I need not, perhaps, enter\r\ninto; but I find, if I compare the prices of cotton in Liverpool from\r\n1856 to 1860 with the prices from 1841 to 1845, that every pound of\r\ncotton brought from America and sold in Liverpool fetched in the last\r\nfive years more than twenty per cent in excess of what it did in the\r\nformer five years, notwithstanding that we were every year in greater\r\ndifficulties through finding our supply of cotton insufficient.\r\n\r\nBut what was the reason that we did not get enough? It was because there\r\nwas not labour enough in the Southern States. You see every day in the\r\nnewspapers that there are four millions of slaves, but of those four\r\nmillions of slaves some are growing tobacco, some rice, and some sugar;\r\na very large number are employed in domestic servitude, and a large\r\nnumber in factories, mechanical operations, and business in towns; and\r\nthere remain only about one million negroes, or only one-quarter of the\r\nwhole number, who are regularly engaged in the cultivation of cotton.\r\n\r\nNow, you will see that the production of cotton and its continued\r\nincrease must depend upon the constantly increasing productiveness of\r\nthe labour of those one million negroes, and on the natural increase of\r\npopulation from them. Well, the increase of the population of the slaves\r\nin the United States is rather less than two and a-half per cent, per\r\nannum, and the increase on the million will be about twenty-five\r\nthousand a-year; and the increased production of cotton from that\r\nincreased amount of labour consisting of twenty-five thousand more\r\nnegroes every year will probably never exceed--I believe it has not\r\nreached--one hundred and fifty thousand bales per annum. The exact facts\r\nwith regard to this are these: that in the ten years from 1841 to 1850\r\nthe average crop was 2,173,000 bales, and in the ten years from 1851 to\r\n1860 it was 3,252,000, being an increase of 1,079,000 bales in the ten\r\nyears, or only about 100,000 bales of increase per annum.\r\n\r\nI have shown that the increase of production must depend upon the\r\nincrease of labour, because every other element is in abundance--soil,\r\nclimate, and so forth. (A Voice: 'How about sugar?') A Gentleman asks\r\nabout sugar. If in any particular year there was an extravagant profit\r\nupon cotton, there might be, and there probably would be, some\r\nabstraction of labour from the cultivation of tobacco, and rice, and\r\nsugar, in order to apply it to cotton, and a larger temporary increase,\r\nof growth might take place; but I have given you the facts with regard\r\nto the last twenty years, and I think you will see that my statement is\r\ncorrect. Now, can this be remedied under slavery? I will show you how it\r\ncannot. And first of all, everybody who is acquainted with American\r\naffairs knows that there is not very much migration of the population of\r\nthe Northern States into the Southern States to engage in the ordinary\r\noccupations of agricultural labour. Labour is not honourable and is not\r\nhonoured in the South; and therefore free labourers from the North are\r\nnot likely to go South. Again, of all the emigration from this country--\r\namounting as it did, in the fifteen years from 1846 to 1860, to two\r\nmillions five hundred thousand persons, being equal to the whole of the\r\npopulation of this great city--a mere trifle went South and settled\r\nthere to pursue the occupation of agriculture; they remained in the\r\nNorth, where labour is honourable and honoured.\r\n\r\nWhence, then, could the planters of the South receive their increasing\r\nlabour? Only from the slave-ship and the coast of Africa. But,\r\nfortunately for the world, the United States Government has never yet\r\nbecome so prostrate under the heel of the slave-owner as to consent to\r\nthe reopening of the slave-trade. Therefore the Southern planter was in\r\nthis unfortunate position: he could not tempt, perhaps he did not want,\r\nfree labourers from the North; he could not tempt, perhaps he did not\r\nwant, free labourers from Europe; and if he did want, he was not\r\npermitted to fetch slave labour from Africa. Well, that being so, we\r\narrive at this conclusion--that whilst the cultivation of cotton was\r\nperformed by slave labour, you were shut up for your hope of increased\r\ngrowth to the small increase that was possible with the increase of two\r\nand a half per cent per annum in the population of the slaves, about one\r\nmillion in number, that have been regularly employed in the cultivation\r\nof cotton.\r\n\r\nThen, if the growth was thus insufficient--and I as one connected with\r\nthe trade can speak very clearly upon that point--I ask you whether the\r\nproduction and the supply were not necessarily insecure by reason of the\r\ninstitution of slavery? It was perilous within the Union. In this\r\ncountry we made one mistake in our forecast of this question: we did not\r\nbelieve that the South would commit suicide; we thought it possible that\r\nthe slaves might revolt. They might revolt, but their subjugation was\r\ninevitable, because the whole power of the Union was pledged to the\r\nmaintenance of order in every part of its dominions.\r\n\r\nBut if there be men who think that the cotton trade would be safer if\r\nthe South were an independent State, with slavery established there in\r\npermanence, they greatly mistake; because, whatever was the danger of\r\nrevolt in the Southern States whilst the Union was complete, the\r\npossibility of revolt and the possibility of success would surely be\r\ngreatly increased if the North were separate from the South, and the\r\nnegro had only his Southern master, and not the Northern power, to\r\ncontend against.\r\n\r\nBut I believe there is little danger of revolt, and no possibility of\r\nsuccess. When the revolt took place in the island of St. Domingo, the\r\nblacks were far superior in numbers to the whites. In the Southern\r\nStates it is not so. Ignorant, degraded, without organization, without\r\narms, and scarcely with any faint hope of freedom for ever, except the\r\nenthusiastic hope which they have when they believe that God will some\r\nday stretch out His arm for their deliverance--I say that under these\r\ncircumstances, to my mind, there was no reasonable expectation of\r\nrevolt, and that they had no expectation whatever of success in any\r\nattempt to gain their liberty by force of arms.\r\n\r\nBut now we are in a different position. Slavery itself has chosen its\r\nown issue, and has chosen its own field. Slavery--and when I say\r\nslavery, I mean the slave power--has not trusted to the future; but it\r\nhas rushed into the battle-field to settle this great question; and\r\nhaving chosen war, it is from day to day sinking to inevitable ruin\r\nunder it. Now, if we are agreed--and I am keeping you still to\r\nLancashire and to its interests for a moment longer--that this vast\r\nindustry with all its interests of capital and labour has been standing\r\non a menacing volcano, is it not possible that hereafter it may be\r\nplaced upon a rock which nothing--can disturb?\r\n\r\nImagine--what of course some people will say I have no right to imagine--\r\nimagine the war over, the Union restored and slavery abolished--does\r\nany man suppose that there would afterwards be in the South one single\r\nnegro fewer than there are at present? On the contrary, I believe there\r\nwould be more. I believe there is many a negro in the Northern States,\r\nand even in Canada, who, if the lash, and the chain, and the branding-\r\niron, and the despotism against which even he dared not complain, were\r\nabolished for ever, would turn his face to the sunny lands of the South,\r\nand would find himself happier and more useful there than he can be in a\r\nmore Northern clime.\r\n\r\nMore than this, there would be a migration from the North to the South.\r\nYou do not suppose that those beautiful States, those regions than which\r\nearth offers nothing to man more fertile and more lovely, are shunned by\r\nthe enterprising population of the North because they like the rigours\r\nof a Northern winter and the greater changeableness, of the Northern\r\nseasons? Once abolish slavery in the South, and the whole of the\r\ncountry will be open to the enterprise and to the industry of all. And\r\nmore than that, when you find that, only the other day, not fewer than\r\nfour thousand emigrants, most of them from the United Kingdom, landed in\r\none day in the city of New York, do you suppose that all those men would\r\ngo north and west at once? Would not some of them turn their faces\r\nsouthwards, and seek the clime of the sun, which is so grateful to all\r\nmen; where they would find a soil more fertile, rivers more abundant,\r\nand everything that Nature offers more profusely given, but from which\r\nthey are now shut out by the accursed power which slavery exerts? With\r\nfreedom you would have a gradual filling up of the wildernesses of the\r\nSouthern States; you would have there, not population only, but capital,\r\nand industry, and roads, and schools, and everything which tends to\r\nproduce growth, and wealth, and prosperity.\r\n\r\nI maintain--and I believe my opinion will be supported by all those men\r\nwho are most conversant with American affairs--that, with slavery\r\nabolished, with freedom firmly established in the South, you would find\r\nin ten years to come a rapid increase in the growth of cotton; and not\r\nonly would its growth be rapid, but its permanent increase would be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nI said that I was interested in this great question of cotton. I come\r\nfrom the midst of the great cotton industry of Lancashire; much the\r\nlargest portion of anything I have in the world depends upon it; not a\r\nlittle of it is now utterly valueless, during the continuance of this\r\nwar. My neighbours, by thousands and scores of thousands, are suffering,\r\nmore or less, as I am suffering; and many of them, as you know--more\r\nthan a quarter of a million of them--have been driven from a subsistence\r\ngained by their honourable labour to the extremest poverty, and to a\r\ndependence upon the charity of their fellow-countrymen. My interest is\r\nthe interest of all the population.\r\n\r\nMy interest is against a mere enthusiasm, a mere sentiment, a mere\r\nvisionary fancy of freedom as against slavery. I am speaking now as a\r\nmatter of business. I am glad when matters of business go straight with\r\nmatters of high sentiment and morality, and from this platform I declare\r\nmy solemn conviction that there is no greater enemy to Lancashire, to\r\nits capital and to its labour, than the man who wishes the cotton\r\nagriculture of the Southern States to be continued under the conditions\r\nof slave labour.\r\n\r\nOne word more upon another branch of the question, and I have done. I\r\nwould turn for a moment from commerce to politics. I believe that our\r\ntrue commercial interests in this country are very much in harmony with\r\nwhat I think ought to be our true political sympathies. There is no\r\npeople in the world, I think, that more fully and entirely accepts the\r\ntheory that one nation acts very much upon the character and upon the\r\ncareer of another, than England; for our newspapers and our statesmen,\r\nour writers and our speakers of every class, are constantly telling us\r\nof the wonderful influence which English constitutional government and\r\nEnglish freedom have on the position and career of every nation in\r\nEurope. I am not about to deny that some such influence, and\r\noccasionally, I believe, a beneficent influence, is thus exerted; but if\r\nwe exert any influence upon Europe--and we pride ourselves upon it--\r\nperhaps it will not be a humiliation to admit that we feel some\r\ninfluence exerted upon us by the great American Republic. American\r\nfreedom acts upon England, and there is nothing that is better known, at\r\nthe west end of this great city--from which I have just come--than the\r\ninfluence that has been, and nothing more feared than the influence that\r\nmay be, exerted by the United States upon this country.\r\n\r\nWe all of us know that there has been a great effect produced in England\r\nby the career of the United States. An emigration of three or four\r\nmillions of persons from the United Kingdom, during the last forty\r\nyears, has bound us to them by thousands of family ties, and therefore\r\nit follows that whatever there is that is good, and whatever there is\r\nthat is free in America, which we have not, we know something about, and\r\ngradually may begin to wish for, and some day may insist upon having.\r\n\r\nAnd when I speak of 'us,' I mean the people of this country. When I am\r\nasserting the fact that the people of England have a great interest in\r\nthe well-being of the American Republic, I mean the people of England. I\r\ndo not speak of the wearers of crowns or of coronets, but of the twenty\r\nmillions of people in this country who live on their labour, and who,\r\nhaving no votes, are not counted in our political census, but without\r\nwhom there could be no British nation at all. I say that these have an\r\ninterest, almost as great and direct as though they were living in\r\nMassachusetts or New York, in the tremendous struggle for freedom which\r\nis now shaking the whole North American Continent.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two years there has been much said, and much written,\r\nand some things done in this country, which are calculated to gain us\r\nthe hate of both sections of the American Union. I believe that a course\r\nof policy might have been taken by the English press, and by the English\r\nGovernment, and by what are called the influential classes in England,\r\nthat would have bound them to our hearts and us to their hearts. I speak\r\nof the twenty millions of the Free North. I believe we might have been\r\nso thoroughly united with that people, that all remembrance of the war\r\nof the Revolution and of the war of 1812 would have been obliterated,\r\nand we should have been in heart and spirit for all time forth but one\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that, as time passes, and our people become better\r\ninformed, they will be more just, and that ill feeling of every kind\r\nwill pass away; that in future all who love freedom here will hold\r\nconverse with all who love freedom there, and that the two nations,\r\nseparated as they are by the ocean, come as they are, notwithstanding,\r\nof one stock, may be in future time united in soul, and may work\r\ntogether for the advancement of the liberties and the happiness of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nMR. ROEBUCK'S MOTION FOR RECOGNITION OF THE\r\nSOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, JUNE 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to follow the noble Lord in the laboured attack which\r\nhe has made upon the Treasury Bench, for these two reasons:--that he did\r\nnot appear to me very much to understand what it was he was condemning\r\nthem for; and, again, I am not in the habit of defending Gentlemen who\r\nsit on that bench. I will address myself to the question before the\r\nHouse, which I think the House generally feels to be very important,\r\nalthough I am quite satisfied that they do not feel it to be a practical\r\none. Neither do I think that the House will be disposed to take any\r\ncourse in support of the hon. Gentleman who introduced the resolution\r\nnow before us.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes are engaged in discussions, and have great difficulty to\r\nknow what we are about; but the hon. Gentleman left us in no kind of\r\ndoubt when he sat down. He proposed a resolution, in words which, under\r\ncertain circumstances and addressed to certain parties, might end in\r\noffensive or injurious consequences. Taken in connection with his\r\ncharacter, and with the speech he has made tonight, and with the speech\r\nhe has recently made elsewhere on this subject, I may say that he would\r\nhave come to about the same conclusion if he had proposed to address the\r\nCrown inviting the Queen to declare war against the United States of\r\nAmerica. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is known not to be very\r\nzealous in the particular line of opinion that I have adopted, addressed\r\nthe hon. Gentleman in the smoothest language possible, but still he was\r\nobliged to charge him with the tone of bitter hostility which marked his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nOn a recent occasion the hon. Member addressed some members of his\r\nconstituency--I do not mean in his last speech, I mean in the speech in\r\nAugust last year--in which he entered upon a course of prophecy which,\r\nlike most prophecies in our day, does not happen to come true. But he\r\nsaid then what he said to-night, that the American people and Government\r\nwere overbearing. He did not tell his constituents that the Government\r\nof the United States had, almost during the whole of his lifetime, been\r\nconducted by his friends of the South. He said that, if they were\r\ndivided, they would not be able to bully the whole world; and he made\r\nuse of these expressions: 'The North will never be our friends; of the\r\nSouth you can make friends,--they are Englishmen,--they are not the scum\r\nand refuse of the world.'\r\n\r\nMr. Roebuck: 'Allow me to correct that statement. What I said I now\r\nstate to the House, that the men of the South were Englishmen, but that\r\nthe army of the North was composed of the scum of Europe.'\r\n\r\nMr. Bright: I take, of course, that explanation of the hon. and learned\r\nGentleman, with this explanation from me, that there is not, so far as I\r\ncan find, any mention near that paragraph, and I think there is not in\r\nthe speech a single word, about the army.\r\n\r\nMr. Roebuck: 'I assure you I said that.'\r\n\r\nMr. Bright: Then I take it for granted that the hon. and learned\r\nGentleman said that, or that if he said what I have read he greatly\r\nregrets it.\r\n\r\nMr. Roebuck: 'No, I did not say it.'\r\n\r\nMr. Bright: The hon. and learned Gentleman in his resolution speaks of\r\nother powers. But he has unceremoniously got rid of all the powers but\r\nFrance, and he comes here to-night with a story of an interview with a\r\nman whom he describes as the great ruler of France--tells us of a\r\nconversation with him--asks us to accept the lead of the Emperor of the\r\nFrench on, I will undertake to say, one of the greatest questions that\r\never was submitted to the British Parliament. But it is not long since\r\nthe hon. and learned Gentleman held very different language. I recollect\r\nin this House, only about two years ago, that the hon. and learned\r\nGentleman said: 'I hope I may be permitted to express in respectful\r\nterms my opinion, even though it should affect so great a potentate as\r\nthe Emperor of the French. I have no faith in the Emperor of the\r\nFrench.' On another occasion the hon. and learned Gentleman said,--not,\r\nI believe, in this House,--'I am still of opinion that we have nothing\r\nbut animosity and bad faith to look for from the French Emperor.' And he\r\nwent on to say that still, though he had been laughed at, he adopted the\r\npatriotic character of 'Tear-'em,' and was still at his post.\r\n\r\nAnd when the hon. and learned Gentleman came back, I think from his\r\nexpedition to Cherbourg, does the House recollect the language he used\r\non that occasion--language which, if it expressed the sentiments which\r\nhe felt, at least I think he might have been content to have withheld?\r\nIf I am not mistaken, referring to the salutation between the Emperor of\r\nthe French and the Queen of these kingdoms, he said, 'When I saw his\r\nperjured lips touch that hallowed cheek.' And now, Sir, the hon. and\r\nlearned Gentleman has been to Paris, introduced there by the hon. Member\r\nfor Sunderland, and he has sought to become as it were in the palace of\r\nthe French Emperor a co-conspirator with him to drag this country into a\r\npolicy which I maintain is as hostile to its interests as it would be\r\ndegrading to its honour.\r\n\r\nBut then the high contracting parties, I suspect, are not agreed,\r\nbecause I will say this in justice to the French Emperor, that there has\r\nnever come from him in public, nor from any one of his Ministers, nor is\r\nthere anything to be found in what they have written, that is tinctured\r\nin the smallest degree with that bitter hostility which the hon. and\r\nlearned Gentleman has constantly exhibited to the United States of\r\nAmerica and their people. France, if not wise in this matter, is at\r\nleast not unfriendly. The hon. and learned Member, in my opinion--indeed\r\nI am sure--is not friendly, and I believe he is not wise.\r\n\r\nBut now, on this subject, without speaking disrespectfully of the great\r\npotentate who has taken the hon. and learned Gentleman into his\r\nconfidence, I must say that the Emperor runs the risk of being far too\r\nmuch represented in this House. We have now two--I will not call them\r\nenvoys extraordinary, but most extraordinary. And, if report speaks\r\ntrue, even they are not all. The hon. Member for King's County (Mr.\r\nHennessy)--I do not see him in his place--came back the other day from\r\nParis, and there were whispers that he had seen the great ruler of\r\nFrance, and that he could tell everybody in the most confidential manner\r\nthat the Emperor was ready to make a spring at Russia for the sake of\r\ndelivering Poland, and that he only waited for a word from the Prime\r\nMinister of England.\r\n\r\nI do not understand the policy of the Emperor if these new Ministers of\r\nhis tell the truth. For, Sir, if one Gentleman says that he is about to\r\nmake war with Russia, and another that he is about to make war with\r\nAmerica, I am disposed to look at what he is already doing. I find that\r\nhe is holding Rome against the opinion of all Italy. He is conquering\r\nMexico by painful steps, every footstep marked by devastation and blood.\r\nHe is warring, in some desultory manner, in China, and for aught I know\r\nhe may be about to do it in Japan. I say that, if he is to engage, at\r\nthe same time, in dismembering the greatest Eastern Empire and the great\r\nWestern Republic, he has a greater ambition than Louis XIV, a greater\r\ndaring than the first of his name; and that, if he endeavours to grasp\r\nthese great transactions, his dynasty may fall and be buried in the\r\nruins of his own ambition.\r\n\r\nI can say only one sentence upon the question to which the noble Lord\r\nhas directed so much attention. I understand that we have not heard all\r\nthe story from Paris, and further, that it is not at all remarkable,\r\nseeing that the secret has been confided to two persons, that we have\r\nnot heard it correctly. I saw my hon. Friend, the Member for Sunderland,\r\nnear me, and his face underwent remarkable contortions during the speech\r\nof the hon. and learned Gentleman, and I felt perfectly satisfied that\r\nhe did not agree with what his colleague was saying. I am told there is\r\nin existence a little memorandum which contains an account of what was\r\nsaid and done at that interview in Paris; and before the discussion\r\ncloses we shall no doubt have that memorandum produced, and from it know\r\nhow far these two gentlemen are agreed.\r\n\r\nI now come to the proposition which the hon. and learned Gentleman has\r\nsubmitted to the House, and which he has already submitted to a meeting\r\nof his constituents at Sheffield. At that meeting, on the 27th of May,\r\nthe hon. and learned Gentleman used these words: 'What I have to\r\nconsider is, what are the interests of England: what is for her\r\ninterests I believe to be for the interests of the world.' Now, leaving\r\nout of consideration the latter part of that statement, if the hon. and\r\nlearned Gentleman will keep to the first part of it, then what we have\r\nnow to consider in this question is, what is for the interest of\r\nEngland. But the hon. and learned Gentleman has put it to-night in\r\nalmost as offensive a way as he did before at Sheffield, and has said\r\nthat the United States would not bully the world if they were divided\r\nand subdivided; for he went so far as to contemplate division into more\r\nthan two independent sections. I say that the whole of his ease rests\r\nupon a miserable jealousy of the United States, or on what I may term a\r\nbase fear. It is a fear which appears to me just as groundless as any of\r\nthose panics by which the hon. and learned Gentleman has attempted to\r\nfrighten the country.\r\n\r\nThere never was a State in the world which was less capable of\r\naggression with regard to Europe than the United States of America. I\r\nspeak of its government, of its confederation, of the peculiarities of\r\nits organization; for the House will agree with me, that nothing is more\r\npeculiar than the fact of the great power which the separate States,\r\nboth of the North and South, exercise upon the policy and course of the\r\ncountry. I will undertake to say, that, unless in a question of\r\noverwhelming magnitude, which would be able to unite any people, it\r\nwould be utterly hopeless to expect that all the States of the American\r\nUnion would join together to support the central Government in any plan\r\nof aggression on England or any other country of Europe.\r\n\r\nBesides, nothing can be more certain than this, that the Government\r\nwhich is now in power, and the party which have elected Mr. Lincoln to\r\noffice, is a moral and peaceable party, which has been above all things\r\nanxious to cultivate the best possible state of feeling with regard to\r\nEngland. The hon. and learned Gentleman, of all men, ought not to\r\nentertain this fear of United States aggression, for he is always\r\nboasting of his readiness to come into the field himself. I grant that\r\nit would be a great necessity indeed which would justify a conscription\r\nin calling out the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I say he ought to\r\nconsider well before he spreads these alarms among the people. For the\r\nsake of this miserable jealousy, and that he may help to break up a\r\nfriendly nation, he would depart from the usages of nations, and create\r\nan everlasting breach between the people of England and the people of\r\nthe United States of America. He would do more; and, notwithstanding\r\nwhat he has said tonight, I may put this as my strongest argument\r\nagainst his case--he would throw the weight of England into the scale in\r\nfavour of the cause of slavery.\r\n\r\nI want to show the hon. and learned Gentleman that England is not\r\ninterested in the course he proposes we should take; and when I speak of\r\ninterests, I mean the commercial interests, the political interests, and\r\nthe moral interests of the country. And first, with regard to the supply\r\nof cotton, in which the noble Lord the Member for Stamford takes such a\r\nprodigious interest. I must explain to the noble Lord that I know a\r\nlittle about cotton. I happen to have been engaged in that business,--\r\nnot all my life, for the noble Lord has seen me here for twenty years,--\r\nbut my interests have been in it; and at this moment the firm of which I\r\nam a member have no less than six mills, which have been at a stand for\r\nnearly a year, owing to the impossibility of working under the present\r\nconditions of the supply of cotton. I live among a people who live by\r\nthis trade; and there is no man in England who has a more direct\r\ninterest in it than I have. Before the war, the supply of cotton was\r\nlittle and costly, and every year it was becoming more costly, for the\r\nsupply did not keep pace with the demand.\r\n\r\nThe point that I am about to argue is this: I believe that the war which\r\nis now raging in America is more likely to abolish slavery than not, and\r\nmore likely to abolish it than any other thing that can be proposed in\r\nthe world. I regret very much that the pride and passion of men are such\r\nas to justify me in making this statement. The supply of cotton under\r\nslavery must always be insecure. The House felt so in past years; for at\r\nmy recommendation they appointed a committee, and but for the folly of a\r\nfoolish Minister they would have appointed a special commission to India\r\nat my request. Is there any gentleman in this House who will not agree\r\nwith me in this,--that it would be far better for our great Lancashire\r\nindustry that our supply of cotton should be grown by free labour than\r\nby slave labour?\r\n\r\nBefore the war, the whole number of negroes engaged in the production of\r\ncotton was about one million,--that is, about a fourth of the whole of\r\nthe negroes in the Slave States. The annual increase in the number of\r\nnegroes growing cotton was about twenty-five thousand,--only two and a-\r\nhalf per cent. It was impossible for the Southern States to keep up\r\ntheir growth of sugar, rice, tobacco, and their ordinary slave\r\nproductions, and at the same time to increase the growth of cotton more\r\nthan at a rate corresponding with the annual increase of negroes.\r\nTherefore you will find that the quantity of cotton grown, taking ten\r\nyears together, increased only at the rate of about one hundred thousand\r\nbales a-year. But that was nothing like the quantity which we required.\r\nThat supply could not be increased, because the South did not cultivate\r\nmore than probably one and a-half per cent of the land which was capable\r\nof cultivation for cotton.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the land in the Southern States is uncultivated. Ten\r\nthousand square miles are appropriated to the cultivation of cotton; but\r\nthere are six hundred thousand square miles, or sixty times as much\r\nland, which is capable of being cultivated for cotton. It was, however,\r\nimpossible that the land should be so cultivated, because, although you\r\nhad climate and sun, you had no labour. The institution of slavery\r\nforbade free-labour men in the North to come to the South; and every\r\nemigrant that landed in New York from Europe knew that the Slave States\r\nwere no States for him, and therefore he went North or West. The laws of\r\nthe United States, the sentiments of Europe and of the world, being\r\nagainst any opening of the slave-trade, the planters of the South were\r\nshut up, and the annual increase in the supply of cotton could increase\r\nonly in the same proportion as the annual increase in the number of\r\ntheir negroes.\r\n\r\nThere is only one other point with regard to that matter which is worth\r\nmentioning. The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Sheffield will\r\nunderstand it, although on some points he seems to be peculiarly dark.\r\nIf a planter in the Southern States wanted to grow one thousand bales of\r\ncotton a-year, he would require about two hundred negroes. Taking them\r\nat five hundred dollars, or one hundred pounds each, which is not more\r\nthan half the price of a first-class hand, the cost of the two hundred\r\nwould be twenty thousand pounds. To grow one thousand bales of cotton a-\r\nyear you require not only to possess an estate, machinery, tools, and\r\nother things necessary to carry on the cotton-growing business, but you\r\nmust find a capital of twenty thousand pounds to buy the actual\r\nlabourers by whom the plantation is to be worked; and therefore, as\r\nevery gentleman will see at once, this great trade, to a large extent,\r\nwas shut up in the hands of men who were required to be richer than\r\nwould be necessary if slavery did not exist.\r\n\r\nThus the plantation business to a large extent became a monopoly, and\r\ntherefore even on that account the production of cotton was constantly\r\nlimited and controlled. I was speaking to a gentleman the other day from\r\nMississippi. I believe no man in America or in England is more\r\nacquainted with the facts of this case. He has been for many years a\r\nSenator from the State of Mississippi. He told me that every one of\r\nthese facts were true, and said, 'I have no doubt whatever that in ten\r\nyears after freedom in the South, or after freedom in conjunction with\r\nthe North, the production of cotton will be doubled, and cotton will be\r\nforwarded to the consumers of the world at a much less price than we\r\nhave had it for many years past.'\r\n\r\nI shall turn for a moment to the political interest, to which the hon.\r\nand learned Gentleman paid much more attention than to the commercial.\r\nThe more I consider the course of this war, the more I come to the\r\nconclusion that it is improbable in future that the United States will\r\nbe broken into separate republics. I do not come to the conclusion that\r\nthe North will conquer the South. But I think the conclusion to which I\r\nam more disposed to come now than at any time since the breaking out of\r\nthe war is this,--that, if a separation should occur for a time, still\r\nthe interest, the sympathies, the sentiments, the necessities of the\r\nwhole continent, and its ambition also, which, as hon. Gentlemen have\r\nmentioned, seems to some people to be a necessity, render it highly\r\nprobable that the continent would still be united under one central\r\nGovernment. I may be quite mistaken. I do not express that opinion with\r\nany more confidence than hon. Gentlemen have expressed theirs in favour\r\nof a permanent dissolution; but now is not this possible,--that the\r\nUnion may be again formed on the basis of the South? There are persons\r\nwho think that possible. I hope it is not, but we cannot say that it is\r\nabsolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible that the Northern Government may be baffled in their\r\nmilitary operations? Is it not possible that, by their own incapacity,\r\nthey may be humiliated before their own people? And is it not even\r\npossible that the party which you please to call the Peace party in the\r\nNorth, but which is in no sense a peace party, should unite with the\r\nSouth, and that the Union should be reconstituted on the basis of\r\nSouthern opinions and of the Southern social system? Is it not possible,\r\nfor example, that the Southern people, and those in their favour, should\r\nappeal to the Irish population of America against the negroes, between\r\nwhom there has been little sympathy and little respect; and is it not\r\npossible they should appeal to the commercial classes of the North--and\r\nthe rich commercial classes in all countries, who, from the uncertainty\r\nof their possessions and the fluctuation of their interests, are\r\nrendered always timid and very often corrupt--is it not possible, I say,\r\nthat they might prefer the union of their whole country upon the basis\r\nof the South, rather than that union which many Members of this House\r\nlook upon with so much apprehension?\r\n\r\nIf that should ever take place--but I believe, with my hon. Friend below\r\nme (Mr. Forster), in the moral government of the world, and therefore I\r\ncannot believe that it will take place; but if it were to take place,\r\nwith their great armies, and with their great navy, and their almost\r\nunlimited power, they might seek to drive England out of Canada, France\r\nout of Mexico, and whatever nations are interested in them out of the\r\nislands of the West Indies; and you might then have a great State built\r\nupon slavery and war, instead of that free State to which I look, built\r\nup upon an educated people, upon general freedom, and upon morality in\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nNow there is one more point to which the hon. and learned Gentleman will\r\nforgive me if I allude--he does not appear to me to think it of great\r\nimportance--and that is, the morality of this question. The right hon.\r\nGentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the hon. Gentleman who\r\nspoke from the bench behind--and I think the noble Lord, if I am not\r\nmistaken--referred to the carnage which is occasioned by this lamentable\r\nstrife. Well, carnage, I presume, is the accompaniment of all war. Two\r\nyears ago the press of London ridiculed very much the battles of the\r\nUnited States, in which nobody was killed and few were hurt. There was a\r\ntime when I stood up in this House, and pointed out the dreadful horrors\r\nof war. There was a war waged by this country in the Crimea; and the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, with an uneasy conscience, is constantly\r\nstriving to defend that struggle. That war--for it lasted about the same\r\ntime that the American war has lasted--at least destroyed as many lives\r\nas are estimated to have been destroyed in the United States.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Montrose, who, I think, is not in the\r\nHouse, made a speech in Scotland some time last year, in which he gave\r\nthe numbers which were lost by Russia in that war. An hon. Friend near\r\nme observes, that some people do not reckon the Russians for anything. I\r\nsay, if you will add the Russians to the English, and the two to the\r\nFrench, and the three to the Sardinians, and the four to the Turks, that\r\nmore lives were lost in the invasion of the Crimea, in the two years\r\nthat it lasted, than have been lost hitherto in the American war. That\r\nis no defence of the carnage of the American war; but let hon. Gentlemen\r\nbear in mind that, when I protested against the carnage in the Crimea--\r\nfor an object which few could comprehend and nobody can fairly explain--\r\nI was told that I was actuated by a morbid sentimentality. Well, if I am\r\nconverted, if I view the mortality in war with less horror than I did\r\nthen, it must be attributed to the arguments of hon. Gentlemen opposite\r\nand on the Treasury bench; but the fact is, I view this carnage just as\r\nI viewed that, with only this difference, that while our soldiers\r\nperished three thousand miles from home in a worthless and indefensible\r\ncause, these men were on their own soil, and every man of them knew for\r\nwhat he enlisted and for what purpose he was to fight.\r\n\r\nNow, I will ask the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, and those who are of opinion with him on this question of\r\nslaughter in the American war--a slaughter which I hope there is no hon.\r\nMember here, and no person out of this House, that does not in his calm\r\nmoments look upon with grief and horror--to consider what was the state\r\nof things before the war. It was this: that every year in the Slave\r\nStates of America there were one hundred and fifty thousand children\r\nborn into the world--born with the badge and the doom of slavery--born\r\nto the liability by law, and by custom, and by the devilish cupidity of\r\nman--to the lash and to the chain and to the branding-iron, and to be\r\ntaken from their families and carried they know not where.\r\n\r\nI want to know whether you feel as I feel upon this question. When I can\r\nget down to my home from this House, I find half a dozen little children\r\nplaying upon my hearth. How many Members are there who can say with me,\r\nthat the most innocent, the most pure, the most holy joy which in their\r\npast years they have felt, or in their future years they have hoped for,\r\nhas not arisen from contact and association with our precious children?\r\nWell, then, if that be so--if, when the hand of Death takes one of those\r\nflowers from our dwelling, our heart is overwhelmed with sorrow and our\r\nhousehold is covered with gloom; what would it be if our children were\r\nbrought up to this infernal system--one hundred and fifty thousand of\r\nthem every year brought into the world in these Slave States, amongst\r\nthese 'gentlemen,' amongst this 'chivalry,' amongst these men that we\r\ncan make our friends?\r\n\r\nDo you forget the thousand-fold griefs and the countless agonies which\r\nbelonged to the silent conflict of slavery before the war began? It is\r\nall very well for the hon. and learned Gentleman to tell me, to tell\r\nthis House--he will not tell the country with any satisfaction to it--\r\nthat slavery, after all, is not so bad a thing. The brother of my hon.\r\nFriend the Member for South Durham told me that in North Carolina he\r\nhimself saw a woman whose every child, ten in number, had been sold when\r\nthey grew up to the age at which they would fetch a price to their\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nI have not heard a word to-night of another matter--the Proclamation of\r\nthe President of the United States. The hon. and learned Gentleman spoke\r\nsomewhere in the country, and he had not the magnanimity to abstain from\r\na statement which I was going to say he must have known had no real\r\nfoundation. I can make all allowance for the passion--and I was going to\r\nsay the malice--but I will say the ill-will of the hon. and learned\r\nGentleman; but I make no allowance for his ignorance. I make no\r\nallowance for that, because if he is ignorant it is his own fault, for\r\nGod has given him an intellect which ought to keep him from ignorance on\r\na question of this magnitude. I now take that Proclamation. What do you\r\npropose to do? You propose by your resolution to help the South, if\r\npossible, to gain and sustain its independence. Nobody doubts that. The\r\nhon. and learned Gentleman will not deny it. But what becomes of the\r\nProclamation? I should like to ask any lawyer in what light we stand as\r\nregards that Proclamation? To us there is only one country in what was\r\ncalled the United States; there is only one President, there is only one\r\ngeneral Legislature, there is only one law; and if that Proclamation be\r\nlawful anywhere, we are not in a condition to deny its legality, because\r\nat present we know no President Davis, nor do we know the men who are\r\nabout him. We have our Consuls in the South, but recognizing only one\r\nLegislature, one President, one law. So far as we are concerned, that\r\nProclamation is a legal and effective document.\r\n\r\nI want to know, to ask you, the House of Commons, whether you have\r\nturned back to your own proceedings in 1834, and traced the praises\r\nwhich have been lavished upon you for thirty years by the great and good\r\nmen of other countries,--and whether, after what you did at that time,\r\nyou believe that you will meet the views of the thoughtful, moral, and\r\nreligious people of England, when you propose to remit to slavery three\r\nmillions of negroes in the Southern States, who in our views, and\r\nregarding the Proclamation of the only President of the United States as\r\na legal document, are certainly and to all intents and purposes free?\r\n['Oh!'] The hon. and learned Gentleman may say 'Oh!' and shake his head\r\nlightly, and be scornful at this. He has managed to get rid of all those\r\nfeelings under which all men, black and white, like to be free. He has\r\ntalked of the cant and hypocrisy of these men. Was Wilberforce, was\r\nClarkson, was Buxton,--I might run over the whole list,--were these men\r\nhypocrites, and had they nothing about them but cant?\r\n\r\nI could state something about the family of my hon. Friend below me (Mr.\r\nForster), which I almost fear to state in his presence; but his revered\r\nfather--a man unsurpassed in character, not equalled by many in\r\nintellect, and approached by few in service--laid down his life in a\r\nSlave State in America, while carrying to the governors and legislatures\r\nof every Slave State the protest of himself and his sect against the\r\nenormity of that odious system.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Sir, I have only this to say,--that I wish to take a\r\ngenerous view of this question,--a view, I say, generous with regard to\r\nthe people with whom we are in amity, whose Minister we receive here,\r\nand who receive our Minister in Washington. We see that the Government\r\nof the United States has for two years past been contending for its\r\nlife, and we know that it is contending necessarily for human freedom.\r\nThat Government affords the remarkable example--offered for the first\r\ntime in the history of the world--of a great Government coming forward\r\nas the organized defender of law, freedom, and equality.\r\n\r\nSurely hon. Gentlemen opposite cannot be so ill-informed as to say that\r\nthe revolt of the Southern States is in favour of freedom and equality.\r\nIn Europe often, and in some parts of America, when there has been\r\ninsurrection, it has generally been of the suffering against the\r\noppressor, and rarely has it been found, and not more commonly in our\r\nhistory than in the history of any other country, that the Government\r\nhas stepped forward as the organized defender of freedom--of the wide\r\nand general freedom of those under its rule. With such a Government, in\r\nsuch a contest, with such a foe, the hon. and learned Gentleman the\r\nMember for Sheffield, who professes to be more an Englishman than most\r\nEnglishmen, asks us to throw into the scale against it the weight of the\r\nhostility of England.\r\n\r\nI have not said a word with regard to what may happen to England if we\r\ngo into war with the United States. It will be a war upon the ocean,--\r\nevery ship that belongs to the two nations will, as far as possible, be\r\nswept from the seas. But when the troubles in America are over,--be they\r\nended by the restoration of the Union, or by separation,--that great and\r\nfree people, the most instructed in the world,--there is not an American\r\nto be found in the New England States who cannot read and write, and\r\nthere are not three men in one hundred in the whole Northern States who\r\ncannot read and write,--and those who cannot read and write are those\r\nwho have recently come from Europe,--I say the most instructed people in\r\nthe world, and the most wealthy,--if you take the distribution of wealth\r\namong the whole people,--will have a wound in their hearts by your act\r\nwhich a century may not heal; and the posterity of some of those who now\r\nhear my voice may look back with amazement, and I will say with\r\nlamentation, at the course which was taken by the hon. and learned\r\nGentleman, and by such hon. Members as may choose to follow his leading.\r\n['No! No!'] I suppose the hon. Gentlemen who cry 'No!' will admit that\r\nwe sometimes suffer from the errors of our ancestors. There are few\r\npersons who will not admit that, if their fathers had been wiser, their\r\nchildren would have been happier.\r\n\r\nWe know the cause of this revolt, its purposes, and its aims. Those who\r\nmade it have not left us in darkness respecting their intentions, but\r\nwhat they are to accomplish is still hidden from our sight; and I will\r\nabstain now, as I have always abstained with regard to it, from\r\npredicting what is to come. I know what I hope for,--and what I shall\r\nrejoice in,--but I know nothing of future facts that will enable me to\r\nexpress a confident opinion. Whether it will give freedom to the race\r\nwhich white men have trampled in the dust, and whether the issue will\r\npurify a nation steeped in crimes committed against that race, is known\r\nonly to the Supreme. In His hands are alike the breath of man and the\r\nlife of States. I am willing to commit to Him the issue of this dreaded\r\ncontest; but I implore of Him, and I beseech this House, that my country\r\nmay lift nor hand nor voice in aid of the most stupendous act of guilt\r\nthat history has recorded in the annals of mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nLONDON, JUNE 29, 1867.\r\n\r\n[The following speech was made at a public breakfast given to William\r\nLloyd Garrison, in St. James's Hall, at which Mr. Bright occupied the\r\nChair.]\r\n\r\nThe position in which I am placed this morning is one very unusual for\r\nme, and one that I find somewhat difficult; but I consider it a signal\r\ndistinction to be permitted to take a prominent part in the proceedings\r\nof this day, which are intended to commemorate one of the greatest of\r\nthe great triumphs of freedom, and to do honour to a most eminent\r\ninstrument in the achievement of that freedom. There may be, perhaps,\r\nthose who ask what is this triumph of which I speak. To put it briefly,\r\nand, indeed, only to put one part of it, I may say that it is a triumph\r\nwhich has had the effect of raising 4,000,000 of human beings from the\r\nvery lowest depth of social and political degradation to that lofty\r\nheight which men have attained when they possess equality of rights in\r\nthe first country on the globe. More than this, it is a triumph which\r\nhas pronounced the irreversible doom of slavery in all countries and for\r\nall time. Another question suggests itself--how has this great triumph\r\nbeen accomplished? The answer suggests itself in another question--How\r\nis it that any great thing is accomplished? By love of justice, by\r\nconstant devotion to a great cause, and by an unfaltering faith that\r\nwhat is right will in the end succeed.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at this hall, filled with such an assembly--when I partake\r\nof the sympathy which runs from heart to heart at this moment in welcome\r\nto our guest of to-day--I cannot but contrast his present position with\r\nthat which, not so far back but that many of us can remember, he\r\noccupied in his own country. It is not forty years ago, I believe about\r\nthe year 1829, when the guest whom we honour this morning was spending\r\nhis solitary days in a prison in the slave-owning city of Baltimore. I\r\nwill not say that he was languishing in prison, for that I do not\r\nbelieve; he was sustained by a hope that did not yield to the\r\npersecution of those who thus maltreated him; and to show that the\r\neffect of that imprisonment was of no avail to suppress or extinguish\r\nhis ardour, within two years after that he had the courage, the\r\naudacity--I dare say many of his countrymen used even a stronger phrase\r\nthan that--he had the courage to commence the publication, in the city\r\nof Boston, of a newspaper devoted mainly to the question of the\r\nabolition of slavery. The first number of that paper, issued on the 1st\r\nof January, 1831, contained an address to the public, one passage of\r\nwhich I have often read with the greatest interest, and it is a key to\r\nthe future life of Mr. Garrison. He had been complained of for having\r\nused hard language--which is a very common complaint indeed--and he said\r\nin his first number:--\r\n\r\n  'I am aware that many object to the severity of my language, but\r\n  is there not cause for such severity? I will be as harsh as\r\n  truth, and as uncompromising as justice. I am in earnest, I will\r\n  not equivocate, I will not excuse, I will not retract a single\r\n  inch, and I will be heard.'\r\n\r\nAnd that, after all, expresses to a great extent the future course of\r\nhis life. But what was at that time the temper of the people amongst\r\nwhom he lived--of the people who are glorying now, as they well may\r\nglory, in the abolition of slavery throughout their country? At that\r\ntime it was very little better in the North than it was in the South. I\r\nthink it was in the year 1835 that riots of the most serious character\r\ntook place in some of the Northern cities: during that time Mr.\r\nGarrison's life was in imminent peril; and he has never ascertained to\r\nthis day how it was that he was left alive on the earth to carry out his\r\ngreat work. Turning to the South, a State that has lately suffered from\r\nthe ravages of armies, the State of Georgia, by its legislature of\r\nHouse, Senate, and Governor, if my memory does not deceive me, passed a\r\nbill, offering 10,000 dollars reward--[Mr. Garrison here said '5,000']--\r\nwell, they seemed to think there were people who would do it cheap--\r\noffering 5,000 dollars, and zeal, doubtless, would make up the\r\ndifference, for the capture of Mr. Garrison, or for adequate proof of\r\nhis death. Now, these were menaces and perils such as we have not in our\r\ntime been accustomed to in this country in any of our political\r\nmovements, and we shall take a very poor measure indeed of the conduct\r\nof the leaders of the Emancipation party in the United States if we\r\nestimate them by that of any of those who have been concerned in\r\npolitical movements amongst us. But, notwithstanding all drawbacks, the\r\ncause was gathering strength, and Mr. Garrison found himself by-and-by\r\nsurrounded by a small but increasing band of men and women who were\r\ndevoted to this cause, as he himself was. We have in this country a very\r\nnoble woman, who taught the English people much upon this question about\r\nthirty years ago: I allude to Harriet Martineau. I recollect well the\r\nimpression with which I read a most powerful and touching paper which\r\nshe had written, and which was published in the number of the\r\n_Westminster Review_ for December, 1838. It was entitled 'The\r\nMartyr Age of the United States.' The paper introduced to the English\r\npublic the great names which were appearing on the scene in connection\r\nwith this cause in America. There was, of course I need hardly say, our\r\neminent guest of to-day; there was Arthur Tappan, and Lewis Tappan, and\r\nJames G. Birney of Alabama, a planter and slave-owner, who liberated his\r\nslaves and came North, and became, I believe, the first Presidential\r\ncandidate upon Abolition principles in the United States. There were\r\nbesides them, Dr. Channing, John Quincy Adams, a statesman and President\r\nof the United States, and father of the eminent man who is now Minister\r\nfrom that people amongst us. Then there was Wendell Phillips, admitted\r\nto be by all who know him perhaps the most powerful orator who speaks\r\nthe English language. I might refer to others, to Charles Sumner, the\r\nscholar and statesman, and Horace Greeley, the first of journalists in\r\nthe United States, if not the first of journalists in the world. But,\r\nbesides these, there were of noble women not a few. There was Lydia\r\nMaria Child; there were the two sisters, Sarah and Angelina Grimke,\r\nladies who came from South Carolina, who liberated their slaves, and\r\ndevoted all they had to the service of this just cause; and Maria Weston\r\nChapman, of whom Miss Martineau speaks in terms which, though I do not\r\nexactly recollect them, yet I know describe her as noble-minded,\r\nbeautiful, and good. It may be that there are some of her family who are\r\nnow within the sound of my voice. If it be so, all I have to say is,\r\nthat I hope they will feel, in addition to all they have felt heretofore\r\nas to the character of their mother, that we who are here can appreciate\r\nher services, and the services of all who were united with her as co-\r\noperators in this great and worthy cause. But there was another whose\r\nname must not be forgotten, a man whose name must live for ever in\r\nhistory, Elijah P. Lovejoy, who in the free State of Illinois laid down\r\nhis life for the cause. When I read that article by Harriet Martineau,\r\nand the description of those men and women there given, I was led, I\r\nknow not how, to think of a very striking passage which I am sure must\r\nbe familiar to most here, because it is to be found in the Epistle to\r\nthe Hebrews. After the writer of that Epistle has described the great\r\nmen and fathers of the nation, he says:--'Time would fail me to tell of\r\nGideon, of Barak, of Samson, of Jephtha, of David, of Samuel, and the\r\nProphets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,\r\nobtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of\r\nfire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong,\r\nwaxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.' I\r\nask if this grand passage of the inspired writer may not be applied to\r\nthat heroic band who have made America the perpetual home of freedom?\r\n\r\nThus, in spite of all that persecutions could do, opinion grew in the\r\nNorth in favour of freedom; but in the South, alas! in favour of that\r\nmost devilish delusion that slavery was a Divine institution. The moment\r\nthat idea took possession of the South, war was inevitable. Neither\r\nfact, nor argument, nor counsel, nor philosophy, nor religion, could by\r\nany possibility affect the discussion of the question when once the\r\nChurch leaders of the South had taught their people that slavery was a\r\nDivine institution; for then they took their stand on other and\r\ndifferent, and what they in their blindness thought higher grounds, and\r\nthey said, 'Evil! be thou my good;' and so they exchanged light for\r\ndarkness, and freedom for bondage, and good for evil, and, if you like,\r\nheaven for hell. Of course, unless there was some stupendous miracle,\r\ngreater than any that is on record even in the inspired writings, it was\r\nimpossible that war should not spring out of that state of things; and\r\nthe political slaveholders, that 'dreadful brotherhood, in whom all\r\nturbulent passions were let loose,' the moment they found that the\r\npresidential election of 1860 was adverse to the cause of slavery, took\r\nup arms to sustain their cherished and endangered system. Then came the\r\noutbreak which had been so often foretold, so often menaced; and the\r\nground reeled under the nation during four years of agony, until at\r\nlast, after the smoke of the battle-field had cleared away, the horrid\r\nshape which had cast its shadow over a whole continent had vanished, and\r\nwas gone for ever. An ancient and renowned poet has said--\r\n\r\n  'Unholy is the voice\r\n  Of loud thanksgiving over slaughtered men.'\r\n\r\nIt becomes us not to rejoice, but to be humbled, that a chastisement so\r\nterrible should have fallen upon any of our race; but we may be thankful\r\nfor this--that this chastisement was at least not sent in vain. The\r\ngreat triumph in the field was not all; there came after it another\r\ngreat triumph--a triumph over passion, and there came up before the\r\nworld the spectacle, not of armies and military commanders, but of the\r\nmagnanimity and mercy of a powerful and victorious nation. The\r\nvanquished were treated as the vanquished, in the history of the world,\r\nhave never before been treated. There was a universal feeling in the\r\nNorth that every care should be taken of those who had so recently and\r\nmarvellously been enfranchised. Immediately we found that the privileges\r\nof independent labour were open to them, schools were established in\r\nwhich their sons might obtain an education that would raise them to an\r\nintellectual position never reached by their fathers; and at length full\r\npolitical rights were conferred upon those who a few short years, or\r\nrather months before, had been called chattels, and things, to be bought\r\nand sold in any market. And we may feel assured, that those persons in\r\nthe Northern States who befriended the negro in his bondage will not now\r\nfail to assist his struggles for a higher position. May we not say,\r\nreviewing what has taken place--and I have only glanced in the briefest\r\npossible way at the chief aspects of this great question--that probably\r\nhistory has no sadder, and yet, if we take a different view, I may say\r\nalso probably no brighter page? To Mr. Garrison more than to any other\r\nman this is due; his is the creation of that opinion which has made\r\nslavery hateful, and which has made freedom possible in America. His\r\nname is venerated in his own country--venerated where not long ago it\r\nwas a name of obloquy and reproach. His name is venerated in this\r\ncountry and in Europe wheresoever Christianity softens the hearts and\r\nlessens the sorrows of men; and I venture to say that in time to come,\r\nnear or remote I know not, his name will become the herald and the\r\nsynonym of good to millions of men who will dwell on the now almost\r\nunknown continent of Africa.\r\n\r\nBut we must not allow our own land to be forgotten or depreciated, even\r\nwhilst we are saying what our feelings bid us say of our friend beside\r\nme and of our other friends across the water. We, too, can share in the\r\ntriumph I have described, and in the honours which the world is willing\r\nto shower upon our guest, and upon those who, like him, are unwearied in\r\ndoing good. We have had slaves in the colonial territories that owned\r\nthe sway of this country. Our position was different from that in which\r\nthe Americans stood towards theirs; the negroes were far from being so\r\nnumerous, and they were not in our midst, but 4,000 miles away. We had\r\nno prejudices of colour to overcome, we had a Parliament that was\r\nomnipotent in those colonies, and public opinion acting upon that\r\nParliament was too powerful for the Englishmen who were interested in\r\nthe continuance of slavery. We liberated our slaves; for the English\r\nsoil did not reject the bondsman, but the moment he touched it made him\r\nfree. We have now in our memory Clarkson, and Wilberforce, and Buxton,\r\nand Sturge; and even now we have within this hall the most eloquent\r\nliving English champion of the freedom of the slave in my friend, and\r\nour friend, George Thompson. Well, then, I may presume to say that we\r\nare sharers in that good work which has raised our guest to eminence;\r\nand we may divide it with the country from which he comes. Our country\r\nis still his; for did not his fathers bear allegiance to our ancient\r\nmonarchy, and were they not at one time citizens of this commonwealth?\r\nand may we not add that the freedom which now overspreads his noble\r\nnation first sprang into life amongst our own ancestors? To Mr.\r\nGarrison, as is stated in one of the letters which has just been read,\r\nto William Lloyd Garrison it has been given, in a manner not often\r\npermitted to those who do great things of this kind, to see the ripe\r\nfruit of his vast labours. Over a territory large enough to make many\r\nrealms, he has seen hopeless toil supplanted by compensated industry;\r\nand where the bondman dragged his chain, there freedom is established\r\nfor ever. We now welcome him amongst us as a friend whom some of us have\r\nknown long; for I have watched his career with no common interest, even\r\nwhen I was too young to take much part in public affairs; and I have\r\nkept within my heart his name, and the names of those who have been\r\nassociated with him in every step which he has taken; and in public\r\ndebates in the halls of peace, and even on the blood-soiled fields of\r\nwar, my heart has always been with those who were the friends of\r\nfreedom. We welcome him, then, with a cordiality which knows no stint\r\nand no limit for him and for his noble associates, both men and women;\r\nand we venture to speak a verdict which, I believe, will be sanctioned\r\nby all mankind, not only by those who live now, but by those who shall\r\ncome after, to whom their perseverance and their success shall be a\r\nlesson and a help in the future struggles which remain for men to make.\r\nOne of our oldest and greatest poets has furnished me with a line that\r\nwell expresses that verdict. Are not William Lloyd Garrison and his\r\nfellow-labourers in that world's work--are they not\r\n\r\n  'On Fame's eternal bead-roll worthy to be filed?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nMAYNOOTH GRANT.\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, APRIL 16, 1845.\r\n[On April 3rd Sir Robert Peel proposed a Resolution for the improvement\r\nof Maynooth College, the grant to consist of 26,000_l_. per annum.\r\nIt was suggested by some speakers, that the act would justify the\r\nendowment of the Roman Catholic priesthood, and Lord John Russell\r\nasserted that such a plan would be a larger, more liberal, and more\r\nstatesmanlike measure. Others objected to the grant on theological\r\ngrounds, others for the reason that it was a step towards endowing\r\nanother Church Establishment in Ireland. The Resolution was carried by\r\n216 to 114. The debate on the Bill was resumed on April 10th, and was\r\ncontinued on April 14th and 16th. The second reading was carried on the\r\nlast day by 323 votes to 176; on May 2nd the Bill passed through\r\nCommittee. It was opposed again on bringing up the Report, on May 5th,\r\nand was finally passed on May 21st, by 317 to 184. The Bill, after\r\nopposition, passed in the Lords on June 10th.]\r\n\r\nI am anxious to make a few observations on the principle on which I\r\nshall give my vote; because I shall be obliged to pass into the lobby\r\nalong with a number of Members of the House from whose principles I\r\nentirely dissent; and after the speech of the noble Lord the Member for\r\nBandon, I think that any one who votes with him has need to explain why\r\nhe votes on his side, for anything more unlike the principles of the\r\npresent day, more intolerant, or more insane with respect to the policy\r\nto be pursued towards Ireland, I have never heard; and I could not have\r\nbelieved that any man coming from that country could have used such\r\nlanguage in addressing this House. I do not think that this question is\r\nto be looked at in a favourable or unfavourable light because of the\r\nparty from which it comes. Some hon. Members have charged the right hon.\r\nBaronet with inconsistency, and have in some degree thrown the blame of\r\nhis conduct on the measure which he has introduced. The right hon.\r\nBaronet has, from unfortunate circumstances, been connected in\r\nOpposition with a party of such a nature, that he could never promote\r\nany good measure whilst in power without being charged, and justly, with\r\ninconsistent conduct. But I will look at the measure as a measure by\r\nitself, and if it be a good measure I will vote for it as willingly,\r\ncoming from the present Government, as if it came from the Government\r\nwhich preceded it. But I object to this measure on the ground that it is\r\nproposed to vote some of the public taxes for the purpose of maintaining\r\nan institution purely ecclesiastical, and for the rearing and educating\r\nof the priests of a particular sect. I am the more strongly against the\r\nBill, because, from all that has been said on both sides of the House,\r\nand from all that I can learn from the public papers, and even from the\r\norgans of the Government, I am convinced that there is no argument which\r\nhas been used in defence of this measure, which would not be just as\r\nvalid for the defence of further measures, not for the payment of\r\nCatholic priests of the College of Maynooth only, but for the payment of\r\nall the priests in Ireland or in England. I admit that the principles\r\nand the arguments which have justified the original vote are good to\r\nsome extent to justify this vote. The right hon. Baronet in his opening\r\nspeech has stated that the principle was conceded, that it is but a\r\nmatter of a few thousand pounds. But if the principle were conceded now,\r\nten or twenty years hence some Prime Minister might stand up and state\r\nthat in 1795 the principle was conceded, and in 1845 that concession--or\r\nrather, that principle--was again sanctioned; and then, arguing from the\r\ntwo cases, it would be easy to demonstrate that it was no violation of\r\nprinciple whatever to establish a new Church in Ireland, and add thereby\r\nto the monstrous evils which exist there now from the establishment of\r\none in connection with the State. The right hon. Baronet has paid no\r\ngreat compliment to the Irish Catholics in the possession of means and\r\nproperty, when he has said that the 9,000_l_. now voted is just\r\nsufficient to damp the generosity of the people of that country. If\r\n9,000_l_. were enough in some degree to check their generosity, I\r\nshould think that a sum of 26,000_l_. is sufficient to destroy it\r\naltogether. When I consider that the Catholic gentry of Ireland pay no\r\nIncome Tax and no Property Tax, and no Assessed Taxes, I do not think it\r\nwould be a thing altogether impossible, or to be unlocked for, that they\r\nshould have supported an establishment for the rearing of priests to\r\nteach that religion to which they profess to be so much devoted.\r\n\r\nBut the object of this measure was just as objectionable to me when I\r\nlearned that it was intended by this vote to soothe the discontent which\r\nexists in Ireland. I will look at the causes whence this discontent\r\narises. Does it arise because the priests of Maynooth are now\r\ninsufficiently clad or fed? I have always thought that it arose from the\r\nfact that one-third of the people are paupers--that almost all of them\r\nare not in regular employment at the very lowest rate of wages--and that\r\nthe state of things amongst the bulk of the population is most\r\ndisastrous, and to be deplored; but I cannot for the life of me conceive\r\nhow the grant of additional money to Maynooth is to give additional\r\nemployment, or food, or clothing to the people of Ireland, or make them\r\nmore satisfied with their condition. I can easily see how, by the\r\ngranting of this sum, the Legislature may hear far less in future times\r\nof the sufferings and wrongs of the people of Ireland than they have\r\nheard heretofore; for they may discover that one large means of\r\ninfluence, possessed by those who had agitated for the redress of Irish\r\nwrongs, is to be found in the support which the Irish Catholic clergy\r\nhas given to the various associations for carrying on political\r\nagitation; and the object of this Bill is to tame down those agitators--\r\nit is a sop given to the priests. It is hush-money given, that they may\r\nnot proclaim to the whole country, to Europe, and to the world, the\r\nsufferings of the population to whom they administer the rites and the\r\nconsolations of religion. I assert that the Protestant Church of Ireland\r\nis at the root of the evils of that country. The Irish Catholics would\r\nthank you infinitely more if you were to wipe out that foul blot, than\r\nthey would even if Parliament were to establish the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch alongside of it. They have had everything Protestant--a\r\nProtestant clique which has been dominant in the country; a Protestant\r\nViceroy to distribute places and emoluments amongst that Protestant\r\nclique; Protestant judges who have polluted the seats of justice;\r\nProtestant magistrates, before whom the Catholic peasant could not hope\r\nfor justice. They have not only Protestant, but exterminating landlords,\r\nand more than that, a Protestant soldiery, who, at the beck and command\r\nof a Protestant priest, have butchered and killed a Catholic peasant,\r\neven in the presence of his widowed mother. All these things are\r\nnotorious; I merely state them. I do not bring the proof of them: they\r\nare patent to all the world, and that man must have been unobservant\r\nindeed who is not perfectly convinced of their truth. The consequence of\r\nall this is, the extreme discontent of the Irish people; and because\r\nthis House is not prepared yet to take those measures which would be\r\nreally doing justice to Ireland, and to wipe away that Protestant\r\nEstablishment which is the most disgraceful institution in Christendom;\r\nthe next thing is, that they should drive off the watch-dogs, if it be\r\npossible, and take from Mr. O'Connell and the Repeal Association that\r\nformidable organization which has been established throughout the whole\r\ncountry, through the sympathies of the Catholic priests being bound up\r\nwith the interests of the people. Their object is to take away the\r\nsympathy of the Catholic priests from the people, and to give them more\r\nLatin and Greek. The object is to make the priests in Ireland as tame as\r\nthose of Suffolk and Dorsetshire. The object is, that when the horizon\r\nis brightened every night with incendiary fires, no priest of the paid\r\nEstablishment shall ever tell of the wrongs of the people amongst whom\r\nhe is living; and when the population is starving, and pauperised by\r\nthousands, as in the southern parts of England, the priests shall not\r\nunite themselves with any association for the purpose of wresting from\r\nan oppressive Government those rights to which the people have a claim.\r\n\r\nI am altogether against this system for any purpose, under any\r\ncircumstances, at any time whatever. Nothing can be more disastrous to\r\nthe best interests of the community, nor more dangerous to religion\r\nitself. If the Government wants to make the priests of Ireland as\r\nuseless for all practical purposes as the paid priests of their own\r\nEstablishment, they should not give them 26,000_l_. merely, but as\r\nmuch as they can persuade the House to agree to. Ireland is suffering,\r\nnot from the want of another Church, but rather because she already has\r\none Church too many; for with the present Church, having a small\r\ncommunity, overpaid ministers, a costly Establishment, and little work,\r\nit is quite impossible to have peace and content in that country. If you\r\ngive the Catholic priests a portion of the public funds, as the\r\nGovernment has given the _Regium Donum_ to the Presbyterians of the\r\nNorth, they will unite with the Church as the Presbyterians did against\r\nany attempt to overturn the old system of Church and State alliance in\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\nThe experience of State Churches is not of a character to warrant the\r\nHouse in going further in that direction. In this country there is a\r\nState Church, and I do not deny that there are many excellent ministers\r\nin it; but from time immemorial it has been characterized by a most\r\ndeplorable and disastrous spirit of persecution, which even at this hour\r\nstill exists; for that Church is now persecuting a poor shoemaker at\r\nCambridge for non-payment of Church rates, and pursuing him from court\r\nto court. That Church has been upheld as a bulwark against Catholicism,\r\nand yet all the errors of Catholicism find a home and a hearty welcome\r\nthere. In Lancashire and Yorkshire, and in other counties, that Church\r\nis found to be too unwieldy a machine, and altogether unfitted to a\r\npopulation growing in numbers and intelligence like that of those parts\r\nof the kingdom. Even in Scotland, where there is a model of the most\r\nperfect Establishment which perhaps could be raised, there are the\r\nSecession Church, the Belief Church, and the Free Church; that which the\r\nState upholds being called by the complimentary name of the Residuary\r\nChurch. After the experience of such State Churches, which have done so\r\nlittle good and so much evil, is this a time for establishing another\r\nChurch? If I approved of Church endowments by the State I would vote for\r\nthis Bill with all my heart, because it is calculated to create a kinder\r\nfeeling towards this country amongst the people of Ireland.\r\n\r\nTwo parties opposed to the Bill are represented by hon. Gentlemen on the\r\nother side of the House. They state that the Roman Catholic religion\r\nshould not be established or helped by the State. But when their Church\r\nis absorbing millions of the public money, while millions of their\r\ncountrymen refuse to enter its doors, how can they for a moment object\r\nto the passing of a measure which will give some sort of show of\r\nassistance to that Church to which millions of the Irish people belong?\r\nThe Nonconformist or Dissenting party in this country are opposed to the\r\nmeasure; but by some of them a spirit is mixed up with their agitation\r\nof this question which shows that they do not understand, or do not\r\nvalue, the great principles of Nonconformity, for which their\r\nforefathers struggled and suffered. I allude more especially to a\r\nportion of the Wesleyan body, which, I believe, does not altogether\r\nrepudiate the principle of endowment.\r\n\r\nBut, with regard to the rest, I am persuaded that their agitation\r\nagainst this measure is honest. If the Dissenters look back to all that\r\ntheir forefathers have suffered, aye, even within a late period, they\r\nwill be recreant to their own principles, and merit the contempt of the\r\nHouse and of the world, if they do not come forward manfully to uphold\r\ntheir own principles, and dissent from and oppose the measure under the\r\nconsideration of the House. For myself, I shall oppose the Bill in every\r\nstage, simply on one ground, that I believe the principle of endowment\r\nto be most unjust and injurious to the country, and whatever may be the\r\neffect on any Government, whether that of the right hon. Baronet or any\r\nthat has preceded or will succeed him, no strength of attachment to\r\nparty or Government will induce me to tamper with what I hold to be the\r\ngreatest and dearest principle which any man or any body of men can\r\nassert. When I look back to the history of this country, and consider\r\nits present condition, I must say, that all that the people possess of\r\nliberty has come, not through the portals of the cathedrals and the\r\nparish churches, but from the conventicles, which are despised by hon.\r\nGentlemen opposite. When I know that if a good measure is to be carried\r\nin this House, it must be by men who are sent hither by the\r\nNonconformists of Great Britain; when I read and see that the past and\r\npresent State alliance with religion is hostile to religious liberty,\r\npreventing all growth and nearly destroying all vitality in religion\r\nitself, then I shall hold myself to have read, thought, and lived in\r\nvain, if I vote for a measure which in the smallest degree shall give\r\nany further power or life to the principle of State endowment; and, in\r\nconclusion, I will only exhort the Dissenters of England to act in the\r\nsame way, and to stand upon their own great, pure, and unassailable\r\nprinciple; for, if they stand by it manfully, and work for it\r\nvigorously, the time may come, nay, it will come, when that principle\r\nwill be adopted by the Legislature of the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nCRIME AND OUTRAGE BILL.\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, DECEMBER 13, 1847.\r\n\r\n[Towards the conclusion of this year (1847) numerous crimes and outrages\r\nof a serious character were committed in Ireland. They were chiefly\r\nagrarian. In order to increase the powers of the Irish Executive,\r\nParliament was invited in the Queen's Speech (Nov. 23) to take further\r\nprecautions against the perpetration of crime in certain counties in\r\nIreland. The Bill was moved by Sir George Grey on Nov. 29, and leave was\r\ngiven, by 224 votes to 18, was read a second time (296 to 19) on Dec. 9,\r\nand passed (174 to 14) on Dec. 13. It was passed in the House of Lords\r\non Dec. 19. On July 31, 1848, the Irish Government proclaimed certain\r\ndistricts in which rebellion had broken out. Smith O'Brien and the other\r\nleaders of the insurgents were speedily arrested, tried, and convicted.]\r\n\r\nI feel very much in the position of the hon. Member who has just\r\naddressed the House, for I am in some degree compelled to speak before\r\nthis Bill is read a third time. I have presented a petition against the\r\nBill, signed by more than 20,000 persons, inhabitants of the borough of\r\nManchester, and I am unwilling to vote without briefly giving the\r\nreasons which make it impossible for me to oppose this Bill. When I\r\nrecollect the circumstances attending the rejection of the Bill of 1846,\r\nfor the protection of life in Ireland, I am convinced that the\r\nGovernment would not have brought forward the present measure if it had\r\nnot appeared to them absolutely necessary, and that, but for this\r\nsupposed necessity, it would never have been heard of.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Government, so far as the necessity for this Bill is\r\nconcerned, seems to me to be as clear and as perfect as it can be. From\r\nthe speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of the Home\r\nDepartment, from the unanimous statements of all the newspapers, and\r\nfrom the evidence of all parties connected with Ireland, it is placed\r\nbeyond a doubt that in the disturbed districts of Ireland the ordinary\r\nlaw is utterly powerless. The reason why the law is carried into effect\r\nin England is, because the feeling of the people is in favour of it, and\r\nevery man is willing to become and is in reality a peace officer, in\r\norder to further the ends of justice.\r\n\r\nBut in Ireland this state of things does not exist. The public sentiment\r\nin certain districts is depraved and thoroughly vitiated. [Mr. J.\r\nO'Connell, 'No! No!'] The hon. Member cries 'No, No;' but I maintain\r\nthat in the disturbed districts the public or popular feeling is as I\r\nhave described it. I do not mean to assert that all which the newspapers\r\ncontain is true, or that they contain all the truth; but I ask the hon.\r\nGentleman if he has not read accounts which are not contradicted, from\r\nwhich we learn that on the occurrence of some recent cases of\r\nassassination, whole districts have been in a state of rejoicing and\r\nexultation? These assassinations are not looked upon as murders, but\r\nrather as executions. Take the case of Mr. Lloyd, a clergyman, who was\r\nrecently assassinated. There was no show of vindictive feeling on the\r\npart of his murderers; there was little of the character of ordinary\r\nmurders in it. The servant was allowed to depart unharmed; a boy who was\r\nin the carriage was removed that he might not be injured; and the\r\nunhappy gentleman was shot with all the deliberation and the calmness\r\nwith which a man would be made to suffer the extreme penalty of the law.\r\nIt is clear, then, that the ordinary law fails, and that the Government\r\nhave a case for the demand they make for an extension of the present\r\npowers of the law.\r\n\r\nI do not say the present Bill will certainly be effective, but it is the\r\nless to be opposed because it does not greatly exceed or infringe the\r\nordinary law; and it is the duty of the Legislature, when called upon to\r\nstrengthen the Executive, to do so by the smallest possible infringement\r\nof the law and the constitution. But, to leave the particular measure\r\nnow before us, I am bound to say that the case of the Government with\r\nrespect to their Irish policy in general is not as good as could be\r\nwished. The Government has not shown the courage which is necessary to\r\ndeal effectually with the difficulties of Ireland. They should remember\r\nwhat passed when the Poor-law was proposed for that country. They were\r\ntold it would be a failure--that it could not be worked; but\r\ndisregarding these statements, they passed the Bill; and I believe,\r\nsince the Act of 1829, no measure has passed this House of equal benefit\r\nto Ireland. The noble Lord at the head of the Government has said that\r\nall parties are to be blamed for the misgovernment of Ireland; but he\r\nshould remember the responsibility which is upon him, for he is now in\r\nthe position of dictator on Irish questions, and whatever he proposes\r\nfor that country, I verily believe, will find no successful opposition\r\nin this House.\r\n\r\nThere is another fact to which I would call attention. The Irish Members\r\ncomplain, and very justly, of the past legislation of this House; but\r\nwhen we call to mind that there are 105 of them here, of whom 60 or 70\r\nare of Liberal politics or opinions, and that about 30 of them are\r\nRepealers, and hold very strong views with regard to the mismanagement\r\nof Irish affairs in the Imperial Parliament, I think we have a right to\r\ncomplain that they have not laid on the table of the House any one\r\nmeasure which they believe to be necessary to the prosperity of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI have been in this House more than four years, and I have never yet\r\nseen the Irish Members bringing forward any proposition of a practical\r\ncharacter--nor am I aware that they have supported any measure they\r\ndeemed necessary for Ireland, with unanimity and earnestness, or with\r\nanything like perseverance and resolution. I am sure that 105, or even\r\n30 English Members, sitting in a Parliament in Dublin, and believing\r\ntheir country had suffered from the effects of bad legislation, would,\r\nby their knowledge of the case, their business habits, activity, union,\r\nand perseverance, have showed a powerful front, and by uniting together,\r\nand working manfully in favour of any proposition they might think\r\nnecessary to remedy the evils of which they complained, they would have\r\nforced it on the attention of the House. But the Irish Members have not\r\ndone this. So far then, they are and have been as much to blame as any\r\nother Member of this House for the absence of good government in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nI will not, like them, complain of bad legislation, and propose no\r\nremedy. What is the condition of Ireland? Last year we voted millions to\r\nkeep its population from starvation; and this year we have been asked\r\nfor a further sum, but have not granted it. We maintain a large army in\r\nIreland, and an armed police, which is an army in everything but in\r\nname, and yet we have in that country a condition of things which is not\r\nto be matched in any other civilised country on the face of the earth,\r\nand which is alike disgraceful to Ireland and to us. The great cause of\r\nIreland's calamities is, that Ireland is idle. I believe it would be\r\nfound, on inquiry, that the population of Ireland, as compared with that\r\nof England, do not work more than two days per week. Wherever a people\r\nare not industrious and are not employed, there is the greatest danger\r\nof crime and outrage. Ireland is idle, and therefore she starves;\r\nIreland starves, and therefore she rebels. We must choose between\r\nindustry and anarchy: we must have one or the other in Ireland. This\r\nproposition I believe to be incontrovertible, and I defy the House to\r\ngive peace and prosperity to that country until they set in motion her\r\nindustry, create and diffuse capital, and thus establish those\r\ngradations of rank and condition by which the whole social fabric can\r\nalone be held together.\r\n\r\nBut the idleness of the people of Ireland is not wholly their fault. It\r\nis for the most part a forced idleness, for it is notorious that when\r\nthe Irish come to England, or remove to the United States or the\r\nColonies, they are about the hardest working people in the world. We\r\nemploy them down in Lancashire, and with the prospect of good pay they\r\nwork about as well, and are as trustworthy, and quiet, and well-disposed\r\nto the law as the people of this country. The great secret of their\r\nidleness at home is, that there is little or no trade in Ireland; there\r\nare few flourishing towns to which the increasing population can resort\r\nfor employment, so that there is a vast mass of people living on the\r\nland; and the land itself is not half so useful for their employment and\r\nsustentation as it might be. A great proportion of her skill, her\r\nstrength, her sinews, and her labour, is useless to Ireland for the\r\nsupport of her population. Every year they have a large emigration,\r\nbecause there are a great number of persons with just enough means to\r\ntransport themselves to other countries, who, finding it impossible to\r\nlive at home in comfort, carry themselves and their capital out of\r\nIreland; so that, year after year, she loses a large portion of those\r\nbetween the very poorest and the more wealthy classes of society, and\r\nwith them many of the opportunities for the employment of labour.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the Bill for regulating the relations of landlord\r\nand tenant, as recommended by the hon. Member for the County of\r\nLimerick, will restore prosperity to Ireland. Such a measure may be\r\npassed with great advantage; but if it be intended by a Bill with this\r\ntitle to vest the ownership of the land in the present occupiers, I\r\nbelieve this House will never pass it, and if it did, that it would\r\nprove most fatal to the best interests of the country. I think we have a\r\nright to blame the Government that as yet we have not seen the Bill for\r\nthe sale of encumbered estates in Ireland. I wish to ask why such a Bill\r\nis not ready before this? [Lord John Russell: 'The Bill has been ready a\r\nlong time'] The noble Lord says the Bill has been ready long ago; but\r\nthat statement only makes the Government open to greater blame, for if\r\nthe Bill is ready, why has it not been brought forward before this? Last\r\nSession the Bill was withdrawn, and the reason given was that landlords\r\nand mortgagees did not like it. If the Government wait till the\r\nlandlords and mortgagees like it, it will never be brought forward at\r\nall. Had they waited till the Irish landlords asked for the Poor-law,\r\nthere would have been no Poor-law in Ireland now.\r\n\r\nThe Government should disregard the opposition of these parties, and\r\nshould take their stand above all class interests. They must refuse to\r\nlisten to the interested suggestions of one class or the other, and they\r\nmust remember that they are the Executive Government of the country, and\r\nbound to act for the public good. There is an unanimous admission now\r\nthat the misfortunes of Ireland are connected with the question of the\r\nmanagement of the land. I have a theory that, in England as well as in\r\nIreland, the proprietors of the soil are chiefly responsible for\r\nwhatever bad legislation has been inflicted upon us. The ownership of\r\nland confers more political power than the possession of any other\r\ndescription of property. The Irish landowners have been willing parties\r\nto the past legislation for Ireland, and they have also had the\r\nadministration and execution of the laws in that country. The encumbered\r\ncondition of landed property in Ireland is at this moment the most\r\npressing question. I am informed by a gentleman in Dublin, of the best\r\nmeans of information and of undoubted veracity, that in the province of\r\nConnaught there is not five per cent, of the land free from settlements\r\nof one kind or other, and that probably not one per cent, is free from\r\nmortgages. I have asked Irish Members of all parties if this be true,\r\nand not one of them is disposed to deny it; and if it be true, I say it\r\nis idle to seek elsewhere for the source of the evils of Ireland; and\r\nevery day, nay, every hour we allow to go by without taking instant\r\nmeasures to remedy this crying mischief, only adds to the criminality\r\nwhich rests on us for our past legislation.\r\n\r\nPatchwork legislation will not now succeed; speeches from the Lord\r\nLieutenant--articles in the newspapers--lending to the landowners at 3\r\n1/2 per cent. money raised by taxation from the traders of England, who\r\nhave recently been paying 8 per cent.--all will fail to revive the\r\nindustry of Ireland. I will now state what, in my opinion, is the\r\nremedy, and I beg to ask the attention of the Government to it, because,\r\nthough they may now think it an extreme one, I am convinced that the\r\ntime will come when they will be compelled to adopt it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is their duty to bring in a Sale of Estates Bill,\r\nand make it easy for landowners who wish to dispose of their estates to\r\ndo so. They should bring in a Bill to simplify the titles to land in\r\nIreland. I understand that it is almost impossible to transfer an estate\r\nnow, the difficulties in the way of a clear title being almost\r\ninsurmountable. In the next place, they should diminish temporarily, if\r\nnot permanently, all stamp duties which hinder the transfer of landed\r\nproperty, and they should pass a law by which the system of entailing\r\nestates should for the future be prevented. [Laughter.] I can assure\r\nhon. Gentlemen who laugh at this, that at some not distant day this must\r\nbe done, and not in Ireland only, but in England also. It is an absurd\r\nand monstrous system, for it binds, as it were, the living under the\r\npower of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the law should proceed is this, that the owner of\r\nproperty should be permitted to leave it to whomsoever he will, provided\r\nthe individual is living when the will is made; but he should not be\r\nsuffered, after he is dead, and buried, and forgotten, to speak and\r\nstill to direct the channel through which the estate should pass. I\r\nshall be told that the law of entail in Ireland is the same as in\r\nEngland, and that in Scotland it is even more strict. I admit it; but\r\nthe evil is great in England, and in Scotland it has become intolerable,\r\nand must soon be relaxed if not abolished. Perhaps I shall be told that\r\nthe laws of entail and primogeniture are necessary for the maintenance\r\nof our aristocratic institutions; but if the evils of Ireland spring\r\nfrom this source, I say, perish your aristocratic institutions rather\r\nthan that a whole nation should be in this terrible condition. If your\r\naristocratic families would rear up their children in habits of\r\nbusiness, and with some notions of duty and prudence, these mischievous\r\narrangements would not be required, and they would retain in their\r\npossession estates at least as large as is compatible with the interests\r\nof the rest of the community. If the laws of entail and primogeniture\r\nare sound and just, why not apply them to personal property as well as\r\nto freehold? Imagine them in force in the middle classes of the\r\ncommunity, and it will be seen at once that the unnatural system, if\r\nuniversal, would produce confusion; and confusion would necessitate its\r\ntotal abolition.\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly convinced that everything the Government or Parliament\r\ncan do for Ireland will be unavailing, unless the foundation of the work\r\nbe laid well and deep, by clearing away the fetters under which land is\r\nnow held, so that it may become the possession of real owners, and be\r\nmade instrumental to the employment and sustentation of the people. Hon.\r\nGentlemen opposite may fancy themselves interested in maintaining the\r\npresent system; but there is surely no interest they can have in it\r\nwhich they will weigh against the safety and prosperity of Ireland? I\r\nspeak as a representative from a county which suffers extremely from the\r\ncondition of Ireland. Lancashire is periodically overrun by the\r\npauperism of Ireland; for a year past it has suffered most seriously\r\nfrom the pestilence imported from Ireland; and many of the evils which\r\nin times past have been attributed to the extension of manufactures in\r\nthat county have arisen from the enormous immigration of a suffering and\r\npauperized people driven for sustenance from their own country.\r\n\r\nAs a Lancashire representative, I protest most solemnly against a system\r\nwhich drives the Irish population to seek work and wages in this country\r\nand in other countries, when both might be afforded them at home.\r\nParliament is bound to remedy this state of things. The present\r\nParliament contains a larger number of men of business and of members\r\nrepresenting the middle classes than any former Parliament. The present\r\nGovernment is essentially of the middle class--[a laugh]--and its\r\nMembers have on many occasions shown their sympathy with it. Let the\r\nhon. Gentleman laugh; but he will not deny that no Government can long\r\nhave a majority in this House which does not sympathise with the great\r\nmiddle class of this country. If the Government will manfully and\r\ncourageously grapple with the question of the condition of land in\r\nIreland, they will, I am convinced, be supported by a majority of the\r\nMembers of this House, they will enable the strength and skill of\r\nIrishmen to be expended on their own soil, and lay the foundation of her\r\ncertain prosperity by giving that stimulus and reward to industry which\r\nit cannot have in the present circumstances of that country. Sir, I feel\r\nit impossible to refuse my vote in favour of the Bill now before us; but\r\nI am compelled to say, that unless the Government will zealously promote\r\nmeasures in the direction I have indicated, they cannot hope long to\r\nretain the confidence of this House or of the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT OF THE POOR.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, AUGUST 25, 1848.\r\nFrom the speeches that have been delivered in this debate, and from what\r\nwe know of Ireland, it is clear that Ireland is so entirely\r\ndisorganised, that it is extremely difficult to suggest any means by\r\nwhich relief can be extensively given without causing two evils: first,\r\nthe waste of a great portion of the money which is granted; and next,\r\nthe demoralization of a large number of those to whom the relief is\r\ngiven. It is on account of these difficulties that I am disposed to make\r\ngreat allowance for the measures which the Government have undertaken,\r\nas well as for any propositions which may be made by the hon. Member for\r\nStroud, even when they appear somewhat inconsistent with correct\r\neconomical principles.\r\n\r\nAs this is probably the last opportunity during this Session when the\r\nquestion of the condition of Ireland can be discussed, I am anxious to\r\navail myself of it to offer a few observations to the House, and to\r\nexplain briefly what I conceive to be the course which ought to be taken\r\nwith regard to that country, to enable its population to place\r\nthemselves in a position of comfort and independence. The past of\r\nIreland is known to us all; it is a tale of idleness, and poverty, and\r\nperiodical insurrection; the present of Ireland is like the past, except\r\nthat at this moment all its ordinary evils are exhibited in an\r\naggravated form. But there are one or two points with regard to this\r\nsubject to which I wish especially to ask the attention of the House.\r\nHave you ever fully considered the effect which this state of things in\r\nIreland has upon the condition of certain districts in England? We have\r\nhad some threatenings of disturbances in England, and of disaffection--I\r\nhope it is not wide-spread--here and there in various parts of the\r\ncountry. Take the county of Lancaster as an example, and you will see\r\nsomething of the consequences of a large influx of the Irish population\r\ninto that district. In Liverpool and Manchester, and in all the belt of\r\ntowns which surround Manchester, there is a large Irish population--in\r\nfact, there is an Irish quarter in each of these towns. It is true that\r\na great number of these persons are steady, respectable, and\r\nindustrious, but it is notorious that a portion of them are, in some\r\ndegree, the opposite of all this. They bring to this country all the\r\nvices which have prevailed so long in Ireland; their influence on the\r\npeople of Lancashire is often of an unfavourable character, and the\r\neffect of their example on the native population must necessarily be\r\ninjurious. We find that crimes attended with violence prevail too\r\ngenerally in Lancashire and Yorkshire. These crimes to a large extent\r\nare committed by persons who are not natives of those counties, but who\r\ncome from Ireland, because it is impossible for them to find subsistence\r\nin that country.\r\n\r\nThere is another point which seems to me important. Driven forth by\r\npoverty, Irishmen emigrate in great numbers, and in whatever quarter of\r\nthe world an Irishman sets his foot, there stands a bitter, an\r\nimplacable enemy of England. That is one of the results of the wide-\r\nspread disaffection that exists in Ireland. There are hundreds of\r\nthousands--I suppose there are millions--of the population of the United\r\nStates of America who are Irish by birth, or by immediate descent; and\r\nbe it remembered, Irishmen settled in the United States have a large\r\ninfluence in public affairs. They sometimes sway the election of Members\r\nof the Legislature, and may even affect the election of the President of\r\nthe Republic. There may come a time when questions of a critical nature\r\nwill be agitated between the Governments of Great Britain and the United\r\nStates; and it is certain that at such a time the Irish in that country\r\nwill throw their whole weight into the scale against this country, and\r\nagainst peace with this country. These are points which it is necessary\r\nto consider, and which arise out of the lamentable condition in which\r\nIreland is placed.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect for a moment upon the destitution which millions of our\r\ncountrymen suffer in that unfortunate island, the conclusion is\r\ninevitable that either the Government or the people of Ireland are in\r\nfault. I think both are in fault. I think the Government has been\r\nnegligent of Ireland. I do not mean the present Government in\r\nparticular; for they are fully as anxious for the welfare of Ireland as\r\nany former Administration has been--but I think the Government generally\r\nhas been negligent of Ireland. It is a common thing to hear it said, and\r\nespecially by Gentlemen sitting on the Treasury bench, that the remedy\r\nfor Irish evils is difficult, and that the difficulty seems\r\ninsurmountable; but the House may rest assured that no difficulty can be\r\nso great as that which must be met if no remedy is applied. To do\r\nanything that can be effectual, must be infinitely less dangerous than\r\nto do nothing.\r\n\r\nNow I believe the real difficulties which beset this question do not\r\narise from anything in Ireland, so much as from the constitution of the\r\nGovernment. This House, and the other House of Parliament, are almost\r\nexclusively aristocratic in their character. The Administration is\r\ntherefore necessarily the same, and on the Treasury benches aristocracy\r\nreigns supreme. No fewer than seven Members of the Cabinet are Members\r\nof the House of Lords; and every other Member of it is either a Lord by\r\ntitle, or on the very threshold of the peerage by birth or marriage. I\r\nam not blaming them for this; it may even be that from neither House of\r\nParliament can fourteen better men be chosen to fill their places. But I\r\nmaintain that in the present position of Ireland, and looking at human\r\nnature as it is, it is not possible that fourteen Gentlemen,\r\ncircumstanced as they are, can meet round the Council table, and with\r\nunbiassed minds fairly discuss the question of Ireland, as it now\r\npresents itself to this House, to the country, and to the world.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Ireland requires two kinds of remedies--one political,\r\nthe other social; and it is hard to tell where the one ends and the\r\nother begins. I will speak first of the political remedies. At present,\r\nthere prevails throughout three-fourths of the Irish people a total\r\nunbelief in the honesty and integrity of the Government of this country.\r\nThere may or may not be good grounds for all this ill feeling; but that\r\nit exists, no man acquainted with Ireland will deny. The first step to\r\nbe taken is to remove this feeling; and, to do this, some great measure\r\nor measures should be offered to the people of Ireland, which will act\r\nas a complete demonstration to them that bygones are to be bygones, with\r\nregard to the administration of Irish affairs, and that henceforth new,\r\ngenerous, and equal principles of government are to be adopted.\r\n\r\nI have on a former occasion stated my opinions on one or two subjects,\r\nand I will venture again briefly to explain them to the House. Ireland\r\nhas long been a country of jars and turmoil, and its jars have arisen\r\nchiefly from religious dissensions. In respect of matters of religion\r\nshe has been governed in a manner totally unknown in England and\r\nScotland. If Ireland has been rightly governed--if it has been wise and\r\njust to maintain the Protestant Church established there, you ought, in\r\norder to carry out your system, to establish Prelacy in Scotland, and\r\nCatholicism in England; though, if you were to attempt to do either the\r\none or the other, it would not be a sham but a real insurrection that\r\nyou would provoke. There must be equality between the great religious\r\nsects in Ireland--between Catholic and Protestant. It is impossible that\r\nthis equality can be much longer denied.\r\n\r\nIt is suspected that it is the intention of the Government to bring\r\nforward at no distant day, if they can catch the people of England\r\nnapping, a proposition for paying the Roman Catholic priests of Ireland.\r\nOn more than one ground I should object to any such scheme. In the first\r\nplace, I believe the Government cannot, from any funds they possess, or\r\nfrom any they can obtain, place the Catholic priests on an equality with\r\nthe ministers of the Protestant Church; and if they cannot do that in\r\nevery respect, the thing is not worth attempting. They will, I think,\r\nfind it infinitely more easy, and it will certainly be much more in\r\naccordance with political justice, and with the true interests of\r\nreligion, to withdraw from Ireland the Church Establishment which now\r\nexists there, and to bring about the perfect equality which may be\r\nsecured by taking away so much of the funds as are proved to be totally\r\nunnecessary for the wants of the population. I do not mean that you\r\nshould withdraw from the Protestant Church every sixpence now in its\r\npossession; what I mean is, that you should separate it from the State,\r\nand appropriate all the funds of which it might justly be deprived to\r\nsome grand national object, such as the support and extension of the\r\nsystem of education now established in Ireland; an appropriation of\r\nmoney which would, I am sure, produce in the minds of the people of\r\nIreland an entire change of feeling with regard to the legislation of\r\nParliament in relation to their country.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Parliamentary representation of Ireland, having\r\nrecently spent seventy-three days in an examination of the subject,\r\nwhilst serving as a Member of the Dublin Election Committee, I assert\r\nmost distinctly that the representation which exists at this moment is a\r\nfraud; and I believe it would be far better if there were no\r\nrepresentation at all, because the people would not then be deluded by\r\nthe idea that they had a representative Government to protect their\r\ninterests. The number of taxes which the people have to pay, in order to\r\nsecure either the municipal or Parliamentary franchise, is so great that\r\nit is utterly impossible for the constituencies to be maintained, and\r\nfor public opinion--the honest, real opinion of intelligent classes in\r\nIreland--to obtain any common or decent degree of representation in the\r\nImperial Legislature. I feel quite confident that in the next Session of\r\nParliament, the questions of religious equality in Ireland and of Irish\r\nrepresentation must receive a much more serious attention than they have\r\nobtained in any past Session.\r\n\r\nI come now to those social questions which must also receive the\r\nattention of Parliament; for if they do not, the political remedies\r\nwill, after all, be of very little permanent use. I advocate these\r\npolitical changes on the ground, not that they will feed the hungry or\r\nemploy the idle, but that they will be as oil thrown upon the waters,\r\nand will induce the people no longer to feel themselves treated as a\r\nconquered race. It is agreed on all sides that the social remedies which\r\nare immediately possible to us, are those having reference to the mode\r\nin which the land of Ireland is owned, or held and cultivated--perhaps\r\n'not cultivated' would be a more correct expression. The noble Lord at\r\nthe head of the Government has alluded to parts of Ireland in which it\r\nis impossible that the land as at present held, or the rates which can\r\nbe collected, can find relief or sustentation for the people. It is a\r\nnotorious fact, that there are vast tracts of land in Ireland, which, if\r\nleft in the hands of nominal and bankrupt owners, will never to the end\r\nof time support the population which ought to live upon them. And it is\r\non this ground that I must question the policy of measures for expending\r\npublic money with a view to the cultivation and reclamation of these\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe true solution of this matter is to get the lands out of the hands of\r\nmen who are the nominal, and not the real, possessors. But Parliament\r\nmaintains laws which act most injuriously in this particular. The law\r\nand practice of entails tends to keep the soil in large properties, and\r\nin the hands of those who cannot perform their duty to it. It will be\r\nsaid that entails exist in Scotland and in England. Yes; but this\r\nSession a law has passed, or is passing, to modify the system as it has\r\nheretofore existed in Scotland; and in England many of its evils have\r\nbeen partially overcome by the extraordinary, and, to some degree, the\r\naccidental extension of manufacturing industry among the people. In\r\nIreland there are no such mitigations; a code of laws exists, under\r\nwhich it is impossible for the land and the people to be brought, as it\r\nwere, together, and for industry to live in independence and comfort,\r\ninstead of crawling to this House, as it does almost annually, to ask\r\nalms of the hardworking people of England.\r\n\r\nThe law and practice of primogeniture is another evil of the same\r\ncharacter. It is a law unnatural and unjust at all times; but in the\r\npresent condition of Ireland it cannot much longer be endured. Were I\r\ncalled upon--and it is a bold figure of speech to mention such a thing--\r\nbut were I called upon to treat this Irish question, I would establish,\r\nfor a limited period at least, a special court in Ireland to adjudicate\r\non all questions connected with the titles and transfers of landed\r\nproperty. This court should finally decide questions of title; it should\r\nprepare and enforce a simple and short form of conveyance, as short\r\nalmost as that by which railway stock is transferred; and, without\r\nregard to the public revenue, I would abolish every farthing of expense\r\nwhich is now incurred in the duties on stamps, for the purpose of\r\nfacilitating the distribution of land in Ireland, and of allowing the\r\ncapital and industry of the people to work out its salvation. All this\r\nis possible; and, more than this, it is all necessary. Well, now, what\r\nis the real obstacle in our path? You have toiled at this Irish\r\ndifficulty Session after Session, and some of you have grown almost from\r\nboyhood to grey-headed old men since it first met you in your\r\nlegislative career, and yet there is not in ancient or modern history a\r\npicture so humiliating as that which Ireland presents to the world at\r\nthis moment; and there is not an English gentleman who, if he crossed\r\nthe Channel in the present autumn, and travelled in any foreign country,\r\nwould not wish to escape from any conversation among foreigners in which\r\nthe question of the condition of Ireland was mooted for a single moment.\r\n\r\nLet the House, if it can, regard Ireland as an English country. Let us\r\nthink of the eight millions of people, and of the millions of them\r\ndoomed to this intolerable suffering. Let us think of the half-million\r\nwho, within two years past, have perished miserably in the workhouses,\r\nand on the highways, and in their hovels--more, far more than ever fell\r\nby the sword in any war this country ever waged; let us think of the\r\ncrop of nameless horrors which is even now growing up in Ireland, and\r\nwhose disastrous fruit may be gathered in years and generations to come.\r\nLet us examine what are the laws and the principles under which alone\r\nGod and nature have permitted that nations should become industrious and\r\nprovident.\r\n\r\nI hope the House will pardon me if I have said a word that can offend\r\nany one. But I feel conscious of a personal humiliation when I consider\r\nthe state of Ireland. I do not wish to puff nostrums of my own, though\r\nit may be thought I am opposed to much that exists in the present order\r\nof things; but whether it tended to advance democracy, or to uphold\r\naristocracy, or any other system, I would wish to fling to the winds any\r\nprejudice I have entertained, and any principle that may be questioned,\r\nif I can thereby do one single thing to hasten by a single day the time\r\nwhen Ireland shall be equal to England in that comfort and that\r\nindependence which an industrious people may enjoy, if the Government\r\nunder which they live is equal and just.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nRATE IN AID.\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, APRIL 2, 1849.\r\n[On February 7, 1849, a proposal was made by the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer that a sum of 50,000_l_. should be granted to certain\r\nIrish Unions, in which distress was more than usually prevalent. The\r\nresolution was passed on March 3. On March 27 the second reading of the\r\nBill founded on this resolution was moved, and the debate continued till\r\nApril 3, when the second reading was affirmed by 193 votes to 138. The\r\nthird reading was carried by 129 to 55, on April 30. The Bill passed the\r\nHouse of Lords on May 18.]\r\n\r\nI ventured to move the adjournment of the debate on Friday night,\r\nbecause I was anxious to have the opportunity of expressing the opinions\r\nwhich I entertain on this most important subject. I am one of the\r\nCommittee appointed by this House to inquire into the working of the\r\nIrish poor-law, and on that Committee I was one of the majority--the\r\nlarge majority--by which the resolution for a rate in aid was affirmed.\r\nIn the division which took place on the same proposition in the House, I\r\nalso voted in the majority. But I am not by any means disposed to say\r\nthat there are no reasons against the course which I take, or against\r\nthe proposition which has been submitted to the House by the Government.\r\nOn the whole, however, I am prepared to-night to justify that\r\nproposition, and the vote which I have given for it.\r\n\r\nAs to the project of raising money for the purpose of these distressed\r\nUnions, I think there can be no doubt in the mind of any Member of the\r\nHouse, that money must come from some quarter. It appears to be a\r\nquestion of life or money. All the witnesses who were examined before\r\nthe Committee; the concurrent testimony of all parties in Ireland, of\r\nall the public papers, of all the speeches which have been delivered in\r\nthe course of this debate, go to prove, that unless additional funds be\r\nprovided, tens of thousands of our unfortunate fellow-countrymen in\r\nIreland must perish of famine in the course of the present year. If this\r\nbe true, it is evident that a great necessity is upon us; a grave\r\nemergency, which we must meet. I am not prepared to justify the\r\nproposition of a rate in aid merely on the ground of this necessity,\r\nbecause it will be said, and justly, that the same amount of funds might\r\nbe raised by some other mode; but I am prepared to justify the\r\nproposition which restricts this rate in aid to Ireland, on the ground\r\nthat the rest of the United Kingdom has, during the past three years,\r\npaid its own rate in aid for Ireland; and this to a far larger amount\r\nthan any call which the Government now proposes to make on the rateable\r\nproperty in Ireland.\r\n\r\nWe have taken from the general taxation of this country, in the last two\r\nor three years, for the purposes of Ireland, several millions, I may say\r\nnot fewer than from eight to ten millions sterling. We have paid also\r\nvery large subscriptions from private resources, to the same purpose;\r\nthe sums expended by the British Association were not less, in the\r\naggregate, than 600,000_l_., in addition to other large amounts\r\ncontributed. The Irish, certainly, gave something to these funds; but by\r\nfar the larger amount was paid by the tax-paying classes of Great\r\nBritain. In addition to this special outlay for this purpose, very heavy\r\nlocal taxation has been incurred by several of the great communities of\r\nthis island, for the purpose of supporting the pauperism which has\r\nescaped from Ireland to Great Britain. In this metropolis, in Glasgow,\r\nin Liverpool, and in the great manufacturing town which I have the\r\nhonour to represent, the overflow of Irish pauperism has, within the\r\nlast two or three years more especially, occasioned a vast additional\r\nburden of taxation. I believe the hon. Member for South Lancashire made\r\nsome statement in this House on a former occasion with respect to the\r\nburden which was inflicted upon Liverpool by the Irish paupers, who\r\nconstantly flow into that town. As to Glasgow, the poor-rate levied last\r\nyear in the city parish alone, amounted to 70,000_l_.; and this\r\nyear, owing to the visitation of cholera and the poverty thereby\r\nengendered, there will be an additional assessment of 20,000_l_.\r\nThe city parish contains only about 120,000 or 130,000 of the 280,000\r\nresidents in the mass of buildings known by the general name of Glasgow.\r\nOf the sum levied as poor-rate in the city parish, it is estimated that,\r\non an average, two-thirds are spent upon Irish paupers. The ranks of\r\nthese Irish paupers are recruited to a comparatively small extent from\r\nthe Irish workmen, who have been, with their families, attracted by, and\r\nwho have found employment in, the numerous manufactories of Glasgow. The\r\nIrish paupers, upon whom two-thirds of the Glasgow poor-rates are spent,\r\nare principally squalid and destitute creatures who are brought over as\r\ndeck passengers, clustering like bees to the bulwarks and rigging, by\r\nalmost every steamer that sails from a northern Irish port. With respect\r\nto the town of Manchester, I am able to give some more definite\r\nparticulars as to the burthen imposed upon the inhabitants for the\r\nsupport of the Irish casual poor. In the year 1848, the sum expended in\r\nthe relief of the settled poor, which term includes the resident Irish\r\nwho are not distinguished by name from the English, amounted to\r\n37,847_l_. The sum expended for the relief of the non-settled\r\nEnglish paupers in the town of Manchester, in the year 1848, was\r\n18,699_l_. The amount expended for the relief of casual Irish poor\r\nalone was 28,007_l_. The total assessment of Manchester is\r\n647,568_l_., which, if divided by the amount required to relieve\r\nthe casual Irish poor, would amount to a rate of 10 1/2 _d_. in the\r\npound upon every pound of rateable property in the town of Manchester;\r\nbut if estimated according to the property really rated (as there are\r\ngreat numbers of persons who, from poverty, do not pay the poor-rates on\r\nthe property they occupy), the amount of assessment for the relief of\r\nthe casual Irish poor alone will be from 15_d_. to 18_d_. in\r\nthe pound, and the charge upon the ratepayers of Manchester for the\r\nrelief of the Irish casual poor during the last year is not less than\r\n2_s_. 1_d_. per head upon the whole population of that town.\r\n\r\nNow, during the last year, Manchester had to struggle with very severe\r\ndifficulties, and the manufacturers there suffered most acutely from\r\nvarious causes. The failure of the cotton crop of 1846, the panic in the\r\nfinancial and commercial world in 1847, the convulsions in the European\r\nStates in 1848--all these contributed to bring upon Manchester enormous\r\nevil; and in addition to this we had to bear an additional burden of\r\n28,000_l_. for the maintenance of the casual Irish poor. I have\r\nhere an analysis of the poor-rates collected in Manchester during the\r\nlast four years, and I will briefly state the results to the House. In\r\nthe year 1845 the amount of rates collected expressly for the relief of\r\nthe casual Irish poor was 3,500_l_. In 1846 the cost of the casual\r\nIrish poor imposed a burden upon Manchester of 3,300_l_.; in 1847\r\nof 6,558_l_.; and in 1848 this item of expenditure reached the\r\nextraordinary sum of 28,007_l_. The people of Manchester have\r\nuttered no loud or clamorous complaints respecting the excessive burden\r\nborne by them for the support of the Irish. They have sent no urgent\r\ndeputations to the Government on the subject of this heavy expense. But,\r\nseeing that they have paid this money for the relief of Irish paupers,\r\nand seeing also that the smaller manufacturing and other towns in\r\nEngland have also paid no small sums for Irish paupers, they do think,\r\nand I here express my conviction, that it will be seen and admitted that\r\nwe have paid our rate in aid for the relief of Ireland, and that it does\r\nbecome the landowners and persons of property in that country to make an\r\neffort during a temporary period to supply that small sum which is by\r\nthis Bill demanded of them.\r\n\r\nI will now pay a few words regarding the province of Ulster. An hon.\r\nGentleman opposite, the Member for Londonderry, who made a not very\r\ncivil speech, so far as it regarded persons who entertain the same\r\nopinions generally which I profess, seemed to allege that there was no\r\nparty so tyrannical as those who wished to carry this rate in aid, and\r\nthat no body of men on earth were so oppressed as the unfortunate\r\nproprietors of Ulster. [Mr. Bateson: 'The farmers of Ulster'] I have\r\nmade a calculation, the result of which is, that, with the population of\r\nUlster, a 6_d_. rate would be 82,000_l_. a-year, or 164,000_l_. for the\r\ntwo years during which they will be required to pay towards the support\r\nof their fellow-countrymen in the south and west. If I were an Ulster\r\nproprietor, I would not have raised my voice against such a proposition,\r\nbecause it is not a state of things of an ordinary character, nor are\r\nthese proprietors called on to do that which nobody else has done before\r\nthem. Neither were they called upon before other sources had been\r\napplied to. Had I been an Ulster proprietor, I would rather have left\r\nthis House than have taken the course they have pursued in denouncing\r\nthis measure. As to the farmers of Ulster, they would not have raised\r\nthis opposition had they not been instigated to do so by hon. Members in\r\nthis House, and by the proprietors in that province, whom they\r\nrepresented. It appears by the reports of the inspectors under the poor-\r\nlaw, that where there has been a difficulty in collecting rates, and the\r\npeople have refused to pay, they have followed the example of the higher\r\nand landlord class; and the conduct of that class in many cases has been\r\nsuch as to render the collection extremely difficult. [Mr. Bateson: 'Not\r\nin Ulster'] I do not speak of Ulster particularly in this instance, but\r\nthe case has occurred in other places; but happily for Ulster the burden\r\nhas not proved so serious in that province.\r\n\r\nI have heard a good deal said respecting the resignation of Mr.\r\nTwisleton, who preferred giving up his situation to supporting the rate\r\nin aid. But the reasons assigned by Mr. Twisleton destroy the importance\r\nof his own act. He did not insist upon the question whether Ulster was\r\nable to bear the rate in aid; but his objection was that Ulster was\r\nUlster, and more Ulster than it was Ireland. He said Ulster preferred\r\nbeing united with England, rather than with Leinster, Connaught, and\r\nMunster; in short, that Ulster was unwilling to be made a part of\r\nIreland. Now, if this Bill can succeed in making Ulster a part of\r\nIreland in interests and sympathies, I think it will be attended with a\r\nvery happy result, and one that will compensate for some portion of the\r\npresent misfortunes of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut the hon. Member also, in another part of his speech, charged the\r\nGovernment with having caused the calamities of Ireland. Now, if I were\r\nthe hon. Member, I would not have opened up that question. My opinion\r\nis, that the course which Parliament has taken with respect to Ireland\r\nfor upwards of a century, and especially since the Union, has been in\r\naccordance with the wishes of the proprietors of the land of that\r\ncountry. If, therefore, there has been misgovernment in Ireland during\r\nthat period, it is the land which has influenced Parliament, and the\r\nlandowners are responsible. I do not mean to say that the House of\r\nCommons is not responsible for taking the evil advice which the\r\nlandowners of Ireland have proffered; but what I mean to assert is, that\r\nthis advice has been almost invariably acted upon by the Government.\r\nThis it is which has proved fatal to the interests of Ireland; the\r\nUlster men have stood in the way of improvements in the Franchise, in\r\nthe Church, and in the Land question; they have purchased Protestant\r\nascendancy, and the price paid for it is the ruin and degradation of\r\ntheir country. So much for the vote which I am about to give in support\r\nof the rate in aid.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, I must observe that if an income tax were to be\r\nsubstituted for a rate in aid, I think I could show substantial reasons\r\nwhy it would not be satisfactory. In the first place, I take an\r\nobjection to the imposition of an income tax for the express purpose of\r\nsupporting paupers. This, I apprehend, is a fatal objection at the\r\noutset. I understand that there has been a document issued by a\r\nCommittee in another place, which has reported favourably for the\r\nsubstitution of an income tax in lieu of the rate in aid. I always find\r\nthat if a proposition is brought forward by the Government to impose a\r\nnew tax, it is always for a tax which is disliked, and I conclude, that\r\nif an income tax for Ireland had been proposed instead of the rate in\r\naid, that would have been repudiated with quite as much vigour as the\r\nproposition now before the House.\r\n\r\nAnd now I will address a few words to the general question of Ireland,\r\nwhich I think may be fairly entered upon in this debate after the speech\r\nof the right hon. Baronet the Member for Tamworth. What have we been\r\ndoing all the Session? With the exception of the Jewish Oaths Bill, and\r\nthe Navigation Laws, our attention has been solely taken up with Irish\r\nmatters. From the incessant recurrence of the Irish debate, it would\r\nseem, either that the wrongs and evils endured by the Irish people are\r\nincurable, or else that we lack statesmen. I always find that, whoever\r\nhappens to sit on the other side of the table, he always has some scheme\r\nto propose for the regeneration of Ireland. The noble Lord on the\r\nTreasury bench had his schemes for that purpose when he was seated\r\nopposite. The right hon. Baronet the Member for Tamworth now has his\r\nscheme to propose, and if he can succeed in it, he will not only have\r\nthe universal wish of the nation in his favour, but the noble Lord also\r\nwho is at the head of the Government will not, I am sure, object to give\r\nway to any man who will settle the Irish question. But the treatment of\r\nthis Irish malady remains ever the same. We have nothing for it still\r\nbut force and alms. You have an armed force there of 50,000 men to keep\r\nthe people quiet, large votes are annually required to keep the people\r\nquiet, and large votes are annually required to keep the people alive. I\r\npresume the government by troops is easy, and that the\r\n\r\n  'Civil power may snore at ease,\r\n  While soldiers fire--to keep the peace.'\r\n\r\nBut the noble Lord at the head of the Government has no policy to\r\npropose for Ireland. If he had, he would have told us what it is before\r\nnow. The poor-law as a means of regenerating Ireland is a delusion. So\r\nis the rate in aid. I do not believe in the regenerating power either of\r\nthe poor-law or of the rate in aid. There may occur cases where farmers\r\nwill continue to employ labourers for the mere purpose of preventing\r\nthem from coming on the poor-rates, but these are exceptions. If the\r\ndesire of gain will not cause the employment of capital, assuredly poor-\r\nrates wall not. A poor-law adds to pauperism, by inviting to idleness.\r\nIt drags down the man who pays, and demoralises him who receives. It may\r\nexpose, it may temporarily relieve, it will increase, but it can never\r\nput an end to pauperism. The poor-law and the rate in aid are,\r\ntherefore, utterly unavailing for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is the absence of all demand for labour that constitutes the real\r\nevil of Ireland. In the distressed Unions a man's labour is absolutely\r\nworth nothing. It is not that the Irish people will not work. I spoke to\r\nan Irish navigator the other day respecting his work, and I asked him\r\nwhy his countrymen did not work in their own country. 'Give them\r\n2_s_. 8_d_. a-day,' said he, 'and you will find plenty who\r\nwill work.' There exists in Ireland a lamentable want of employment. The\r\nland there enjoys a perpetual sabbath. If the people of Ireland were set\r\nto work, they would gain their subsistence; but if this course is not\r\nadopted, they must either continue to be supported out of the taxes, or\r\nelse be left to starve. In order to show how great is the general\r\npoverty in Ireland, I will read a statement of the comparative amount of\r\nlegacy duty paid in the two countries. In England, in the year 1844, the\r\namount of capital on which legacy duty was paid was 44,393,887_l_.;\r\nin Ireland, in 1845, the amount of capital on which legacy duty was paid\r\nwas 2,140,021_l_.--the population of the latter being nearly one-\r\nhalf of the former, whilst the proportion between the capital paying\r\nlegacy duty is only one-twentieth. In 1844, the legacy duty paid in\r\nEngland was 1,124,435_l_., with a population of 16,000,000; in\r\nScotland it was 74,116_l_., with a population of 3,000,000; whilst\r\nIreland paid only 53,618_l_., with a population of 8,000,000. These\r\nfacts offer the strongest possible proof of the poverty of Ireland.\r\n\r\nOn looking over the reports of the Poor-law Inspectors, I find them\r\nteeming with statements of the wretchedness which prevails in the\r\ndistressed districts of Ireland. The general character of the reports\r\nis, that starvation is, literally speaking, gradually driving the\r\npopulation into their graves. The people cannot quit their hovels for\r\nwant of clothing, whilst others cannot be discharged from the workhouses\r\nowing to the same cause. Men are seen wearing women's apparel, not being\r\nable to procure proper clothing; whilst, in other instances, men, women,\r\nand children are all huddled together under bundles of rags, unable to\r\nrise for lack of covering; workhouses and prisons are crowded beyond\r\ntheir capacity to contain, the mortality being very great in them.\r\nPersons of honest character commit thefts in order to be sent to prison,\r\nand some ask, as a favour, to be transported.\r\n\r\nI know of nothing like this in the history of modern times. The only\r\nparallel I can find to it is in the work of the great German author\r\n(Mosheim), who, in his Institutes of the Christian Religion, speaking of\r\nthe inroads of the barbarians into the Roman empire in the fifth\r\ncentury, says that in Gaul, the calamities of the times drove many to\r\nsuch madness, that they wholly excluded God from the government of the\r\nworld, and denied His providence over human affairs. It would almost\r\nappear that this state of things is now to be seen in Ireland. The\r\nprisons are crowded, the chapels deserted, society is disorganised and\r\nruined; labour is useless, for capital is not to be had for its\r\nemployment. The reports of the Inspectors say that this catastrophe has\r\nonly been hastened, and not originated, by the failure of the potato\r\ncrop during the last four years, and that all men possessed of any\r\nintelligence must have foreseen what would ultimately happen.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, in what manner are the Irish people to subsist in\r\nfuture? There is the land, and there is labour enough to bring it into\r\ncultivation. But such is the state in which the land is placed, that\r\ncapital cannot be employed upon it. You have tied up the raw material in\r\nsuch a manner--you have created such a monopoly of land by your laws and\r\nyour mode of dealing with it, as to render it alike a curse to the\r\npeople and to the owners of it. Why, let me ask, should land be tied up\r\nany more than any other raw material? If the supply of cotton wool were\r\nlimited to the hands of the Browns and the Barings, what would be the\r\ncondition of the Lancashire manufactories? What the manufactories would\r\nbe under such a monopoly, the land in the county of Mayo actually is\r\nunder the system which prevails with respect to it in Ireland. But land\r\ncarries with it territorial influence, which the Legislature will not\r\ninterfere with lest it should be disturbed. Land is sacred, and must not\r\nbe touched.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade will\r\nunderstand what I mean when I allude to the Land Improvement Company\r\nwhich the Legislature is ready to charter for Ireland, but which it\r\nfears to suffer to exist in England, lest the territorial influence\r\nwhich ever accompanies the possession of landed estates should be lost\r\nor diminished. But one of the difficulties to which a remedy must be\r\napplied is the defective titles, which cannot easily be got rid of under\r\nthe present system of entails. This is one of the questions to which the\r\nHouse of Commons must very soon give its serious attention. Then there\r\ncomes the question of settlements. Now, I do not say there ought not to\r\nbe any settlements; but what I mean to say is, that they are so bound up\r\nand entangled with the system of entails as to present insuperable\r\ndifficulties in the way of dealing with land as a marketable commodity.\r\nI have here an Opinion which I will read to the House, which I find\r\nrecorded as having been given by an eminent counsel: it is quoted in\r\nHayes' work on Conveyancing, and the Opinion was given on the occasion\r\nof a settlement on the marriage of a gentleman having a fee-simple\r\nestate:--\r\n\r\n  'The proposals extend to a strict settlement by the gentleman\r\n  upon the first and other sons of the marriage. It will appear\r\n  from the preceding observations, that where the relative\r\n  circumstances are such as in the present case, a strict\r\n  settlement of the gentleman's estate does not ordinarily enter\r\n  into the arrangement, which begins and ends with his taking the\r\n  lady's fortune, and imposing an equivalent pecuniary charge upon\r\n  his estate (for her personal benefit). The proposals seldom go\r\n  further, unless there is hereditary rank or title to be\r\n  supported, or it is in contemplation to found a family. The\r\n  former of those two circumstances do not exist in this case, and\r\n  the latter would require the settlement of the bulk of the\r\n  estates. The policy of such settlements is extremely\r\n  questionable. It is difficult to refer them, in the absence of\r\n  both the motives already indicated, to any rational principle.\r\n  The present possessor has absolute dominion; his character is\r\n  known, his right unquestionable. He is asked to reduce himself to\r\n  a mere tenant for life in favour of an unborn son, of whose\r\n  character nothing can be predicted, and who, if he can be said to\r\n  have any right, cannot possibly have a preferable right. At no\r\n  very distant period the absolute dominion must be confided to\r\n  somebody--and why should confidence be reposed in the unborn\r\n  child rather than the living parent? Such, a settlement has no\r\n  tendency to protect or benefit the father, whose advantage and\r\n  comfort ought first to be consulted. It does not shield him from\r\n  the consequences of his own imprudence. On the contrary, if his\r\n  expenditure should in any instance exceed his income, he--as a\r\n  mere tenant for life--is in danger of being obliged to borrow on\r\n  annuity, a process which, once begun, proceeds generally and\r\n  almost necessarily to the exhaustion of the life income. The son\r\n  may be an idiot or a spendthrift. He may be tempted to raise\r\n  money by _post obit_. If to these not improbable results we\r\n  add all the family feuds generated between the tenant for life\r\n  and remainderman, in regard to the management and enjoyment by\r\n  the former of that estate which was once his own, particularly\r\n  with reference to cutting timber, the disadvantages of thus\r\n  fettering the dominion will appear greatly to preponderate. At\r\n  best, a settlement is a speculation; at worst, it is the occasion\r\n  of distress, profligacy, and domestic discord, ending not\r\n  unfrequently, as the Chancery Reports bear witness, in obstinate\r\n  litigation, ruinous alike to the peace and to the property of the\r\n  family. Sometimes the father effects an arrangement with his\r\n  eldest son on his coming of age; the son stipulating for an\r\n  immediate provision in the shape of an annuity, the father for a\r\n  gross sum to satisfy his creditors, or to portion his younger\r\n  children, and for a resettlement of the estate. This arrangement,\r\n  perhaps, is brought about by means, or imposes terms, which, in\r\n  the eye of equity, render it a fraud upon the son; and here we\r\n  have another source of litigation.'\r\n\r\nNow, what I have here read is exactly that which everybody's experience\r\ntells us is the fact, and we have recently had a notable case which\r\nexactly answers to that referred to in the last paragraph of this\r\nOpinion. The practice of making settlements of this description is\r\nmischievous--leads to endless litigation--and sooner or later the landed\r\nclasses must sink under it.\r\n\r\nThe Irish proprietors have also another difficulty to contend with, and\r\nthat is their extravagance. It is said--for I cannot vouch for the fact\r\nmyself--that they keep too many horses and dogs. I do not mean to say\r\nthat an Irish gentleman may not spend his rents as he pleases; but I can\r\nsay that he cannot both spend his money and have it too. I think if they\r\nwould cast their pride on one side, and go honestly to work--if, instead\r\nof their young men spending their time 'waiting for a commission' they\r\nwere to go into business, they would be far better and more usefully\r\nemployed, and they would find that the less humiliating condition of the\r\ntwo. Another bane of Ireland is the prevalence of life interests in\r\nlanded property there. Under such a system the land can neither be\r\nimproved nor sold. Now what has the noble Lord at the head of the\r\nGovernment done towards grappling with all these questions? Nothing--\r\nabsolutely nothing. I think him very unwise in not propounding to\r\nhimself the momentous question, 'What shall be done for Ireland?' The\r\nright hon. Baronet the Member for Tamworth has a plan. He entered upon\r\nits outline on Friday last. But I doubt whether it has yet taken that\r\ndistinct form which it must assume in order that the House may take\r\ncognisance of it. I admire some of the measures which the right hon.\r\nBaronet intimates he would carry into effect, but there are other parts\r\nof his proposals which are vague and impracticable. I think, if it is\r\nbelieved in Ireland that a Commission is to be appointed to take charge\r\nof the distressed Unions of the south and west--that the whole thing is\r\nto be managed through a new department of the Government, and all\r\nwithout the slightest trouble to the landlords--that there will be more\r\nthan ever a clinging to this wretched property in bankrupt estates, and\r\nmore than ever an indisposition to adopt those measures which are still\r\nopen to them, in the direction in which the right hon. Baronet wishes to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. Baronet stated in his first speech on this topic, that he\r\ndid not wish the transfer of property to be by individual barter; and on\r\nFriday he stated that he was very much averse to allowing matters to go\r\non in their natural course, for by that means land would be unnaturally\r\ncheapened. Well, but upon what conditions would the right hon. Baronet\r\nbuy land in Ireland? would it be under the same circumstances, and at\r\nthe same price, that he would buy an estate in Yorkshire or\r\nStaffordshire? If any sane man goes to the west or south of Ireland to\r\npurchase an estate, he must go on account of the cheapness of the\r\nbargain--a cheapness which he hopes will compensate him for all the\r\ndisadvantages to which he must necessarily be subjected in such a\r\npurchase. There can be no redemption for that part of Ireland--if it is\r\nto be through the transfer of land--except the land take its natural\r\ncourse, and come so cheap into the market that Englishmen and Scotchmen,\r\nand Irishmen too having capital, will be willing to purchase it,\r\nnotwithstanding all its disadvantages. [Colonel Dunne: 'Hear, hear!']\r\nThe hon. Member for Portarlington cheers that, as if it were an\r\nextraordinary statement. If the hon. Member prefers purchasing what is\r\ndear to what is cheap, he is not a very sensible man to legislate for\r\nIreland. If he thinks that a man will go into Galway and pay as much per\r\nacre for an estate as he would in England, he is greatly mistaken; but\r\nthe fact is, I believe, that not only English and Scotch capital, but\r\nthat much Irish capital also, would be expended in the purchase of\r\nestates in the south and west, if the ends which the right hon. Baronet\r\nhas in view were facilitated by this House.\r\n\r\nBut we have a case in point which affords us some guidance upon this\r\nquestion, and it is a case with which the right hon. Baronet the Member\r\nfor Tamworth, and the right hon. Baronet the Member for Ripon, are very\r\nfamiliar. I allude to the case of Stockport in 1842. Owing to a variety\r\nof circumstances--I will not go into the question of the Corn-law, as\r\nthat is settled--but owing to a variety of circumstances, from 1838 to\r\n1842 there was a continued sinking in the condition of Stockport--its\r\nproperty depreciated to a lamentable extent. One man left property, as\r\nhe thought, worth 80,000_l_. or 90,000_l_. Within two years it\r\nsold for little more than 30,000_l_. Since that time the son of one\r\nman, then supposed to be a person of large property, has had relief from\r\nthe parochial funds. In 1842 the amount of the poor-rate averaged from\r\n7_s_. to 8_s_. in the pound. From November 4, 1841, to May 30,\r\n1842, the rates levied were 6_s_. in the pound, realising the\r\namount of 19,144_l_. From January 28, 1843, to August 2 of the same\r\nyear, the rates levied were 7_s_. in the pound, and the amount\r\nraised was 21,948_l_. And bear in mind that at that time Stockport\r\nwas in process of depopulation--many thousands quitted the place--whole\r\nstreets were left with scarcely a tenant in them--some public-houses,\r\npreviously doing a large business, were let for little more than their\r\nrates; in fact, Stockport was as fair a representative of distress\r\namongst a manufacturing community as Mayo, Galway, or any western county\r\nof Ireland can be at this moment of distress amongst an agricultural\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nNow what was done in Stockport? There was a Commission of Inquiry, which\r\nthe then Home Secretary appointed. They made an admirable report, the\r\nlast paragraph of which ought to be read by every one who wishes to know\r\nthe character of the people of Stockport. Mr. Twisleton, speaking of\r\nthem, said that they were a noble people; and truly the exertions which\r\nthey made to avoid becoming chargeable upon the rates were heroic. Well\r\nnow, all this suffering was going on--the workhouses were crowded, the\r\npeople were emigrating, there was a general desolation, and if it had\r\nnot been for the harvest of 1842, which was a good one, and the gradual\r\nrecovery of trade which followed, nothing in Ireland can be worse than\r\nthe condition of Stockport would have been. What was the result?\r\nProperty was greatly depreciated, and much of it changed hands.\r\nSomething like half the manufacturers failed, and, of course, gave up\r\nbusiness altogether. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport purchased\r\nproperty in the borough at that period, and since then he has laid out\r\nnot far short of a hundred thousand pounds, in a very large\r\nmanufacturing establishment in that town. In fact, the persons who are\r\nnow carrying on the manufacturing business in Stockport are of a more\r\nsubstantial character than those who were swept away by the calamities\r\nof 1842. This is a very sorrowful process. I can feel as much for those\r\npersons as any man; but we must all submit to circumstances such as\r\nthese when they come.\r\n\r\nThere are vicissitudes in all classes of society, and in all occupations\r\nin which we may engage; and when we have, as now in Ireland, a state of\r\nthings--a grievous calamity not equalled under the sun,--it is the duty\r\nof this House not to interfere with the ordinary and natural course of\r\nremedy, and not to flinch from what is necessary for the safety of the\r\npeople by reason of any mistaken sympathy with the owners of cotton\r\nmills or with the proprietors of landed estates. Now, I want Parliament\r\nto remove every obstacle in the way of the free sale of land. I believe\r\nthat in this policy lies the only security you have for the restoration\r\nof the distressed districts of Ireland. The question of a Parliamentary\r\ntitle is most important; but I understand that the difficulty of this\r\narises from the system of entails beyond persons now living, and because\r\nyou must go back through a long search of sixty years before you can\r\nmake it quite clear that the title is absolutely secure. The right hon.\r\nBaronet the Member for Tamworth suggested that the Lord Chancellor\r\nshould be ousted. I proposed last year that there should be a new court\r\nestablished in Ireland, for the adjudication of cases connected with\r\nland, and for no other purpose, and that it should thus relieve the\r\npresent courts from much of the business with which they are now\r\nencumbered. But I do not say that even such a court would effect much\r\ngood, unless it were very much more speedy in its operations than the\r\nexisting courts. I believe that the present Lord Chancellor is admitted\r\nto be as good a Judge as ever sat in the Court of Chancery; but he is\r\nrather timid as a Minister, and inert as a statesman; and, if I am not\r\nmistaken, he was in a great measure responsible for the failure of the\r\nBill for facilitating the sale of encumbered estates last Session. The\r\nGovernment must have known, as well as I do, that such a measure could\r\nnot succeed, and that the clause which was introduced--on the third\r\nreading, I believe--made it impossible to work it.\r\n\r\nThere is another point, with regard to intestate estates. I feel how\r\ntenderly one must speak, in this House, upon a question like this. Even\r\nthe right hon. Member for Tamworth, with all his authority, appeared,\r\nwhen touching on this delicate question of the land, as if he were\r\nwalking upon eggs which he was very much afraid of breaking. I certainly\r\nnever heard the right hon. Gentleman steer through so many sinuosities\r\nin a case; and hardly, at last, dared he come to the question, because\r\nhe was talking about land--this sacred land! I believe land to have\r\nnothing peculiar in its nature which does not belong to other property;\r\nand everything that we have done with the view of treating land\r\ndifferently from other property has been a blunder--a false course which\r\nwe must retrace--an error which lies at the foundation of very much of\r\nthe pauperism and want of employment which so generally prevail. Now,\r\nwith regard to intestate estates, I am told that the House of Lords will\r\nnever repeal the law of primogeniture; but I do not want them to repeal\r\nthe law of primogeniture in the sense entertained by some people. I do\r\nnot want them to enact the system of France, by which a division of\r\nproperty is compelled. I think that to force the division of property by\r\nlaw is just as contrary to sound principles and natural rights as to\r\nprevent its division, as is done by our law. If a man choose to act the\r\nunnatural and absurd part of leaving the whole of his property to one\r\nchild, I should not, certainly, look with respect upon his memory; but I\r\nwould not interfere to prevent the free exercise of his will. I think,\r\nhowever, if a man die by chance without a will, that it is the duty of\r\nthe Government to set a high moral example, and to divide the property\r\nequally among the children of the former owner, or among those who may\r\nbe said to be his heirs--among those, in fact, who would fairly\r\nparticipate in his personal estate. If that system of leaving all to the\r\neldest were followed out in the case of personalty, it would lead to\r\nimmediate confusion, and, by destroying the whole social system, to a\r\nperfect anarchy of property. Why, then, should that course be followed\r\nwith regard to land? The repeal of the law would not of necessity\r\ndestroy the custom; but this House would no longer give its sanction to\r\na practice which is bad; and I believe that gradually there would be a\r\nmore just appreciation of their duties in this respect by the great body\r\nof testators.\r\n\r\nThen, with regard to life interests; I would make an alteration there. I\r\nthink that life-owners should be allowed to grant leases--of course,\r\nonly on such terms as should ensure the successor from fraud--and that\r\nestates should be permitted to be charged with the sums which were\r\nexpended in their improvement. Next, with regard to the registry of\r\nland. In many European countries this is done; and high legal\r\nauthorities affirm that it would not be difficult to accomplish it in\r\nthis country. You have your Ordnance Survey. To make the Survey\r\nnecessary for a perfect registry of deeds throughout the kingdom, would\r\nnot cost more than 9_d_. an acre; and if you had your plans\r\nengraved, it would be no great addition to the expense. There can be no\r\nreason why the landowners should not have that advantage conferred upon\r\nthem, because, in addition to the public benefit, it would increase the\r\nvalue of their lands by several years' purchase. Mr. Senior has stated,\r\nthat if there were the same ready means for the transfer of land as at\r\npresent exist for the transfer of personalty, the value of land would be\r\nincreased, if I mistake not, by nine years' purchase. This is a subject\r\nwhich I would recommend to the hon. Member for Buckinghamshire, now\r\ndistinguished as the advocate of the landed interest.\r\n\r\nThen with regard to stamps, I think that they might be reduced, at any\r\nrate for a number of years, to a nominal amount. In fact, I would make\r\nany sacrifice for the purpose of changing land from the hands of\r\ninsolvent and embarrassed owners into those of solvent persons, who\r\nwould employ it in a manner usefully and advantageously to the country\r\nand themselves. There is another proposition with, regard to the waste\r\nlands of Ireland. The Government made a proposal last year for obtaining\r\nthose waste lands, and bringing them into cultivation. That I thought\r\ninjudicious. But they might take those lands at a valuation, and,\r\ndividing them into farms and estates of moderate size, might tempt\r\npurchasers from different parts of the United Kingdom. By such means I\r\nbelieve that a large proportion of the best of the waste lands might be\r\nbrought into cultivation. I believe that these are the only means by\r\nwhich capital can be attracted to that country.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord at the head of the Government proposes to attract capital\r\nto Ireland by a maximum rate and a charge upon the Unions. If that\r\nmaximum rate be all you have to propose, there will be no more\r\nprobability of capital flowing into those parts of Ireland where it is\r\nso much required, than there was at the time when the poor-rate was\r\nunknown. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Tamworth spoke about\r\nemigration; and I think that he was rather unjust, or at least unwise,\r\nin his observations with regard to voluntary emigration. Things that are\r\ndone voluntarily are not always done well; neither are things that are\r\ndone by the Government; and I know many cases where Government\r\nundertakings have failed as eminently as any that have been attempted by\r\nprivate enterprise. But it does not appear to me that there is much\r\nwisdom in the project of emigration, although I know that some hon.\r\nGentlemen from Ireland place great faith in it as a remedy. I have\r\nendeavoured to ascertain what is the relation of the population to the\r\nland in Ireland, and this is what I find. In speaking of the Clifden\r\nUnion, the Inspectors state--\r\n\r\n  'In conclusion, we beg to offer our matured opinion that the\r\n  resources of the Union would, if made available, be amply\r\n  sufficient for the independent support of its population.'\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, who was examined before the Committee of which I am a\r\nmember, said, speaking of the Unions of Donegal and Glenties--\r\n\r\n  'There is no over-population, if those Unions, according to their\r\n  capabilities, were cultivated as the average of English counties,\r\n  with the same skill and capital.'\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Twisleton said--\r\n\r\n  'I did not speak of a redundant population in reference to land,\r\n  only to capital. The land of Ireland could maintain double its\r\n  present population.'\r\n\r\nThen, if that be the case, I am not quite certain that we should be wise\r\nin raising sums of money to enable the people to emigrate. The cost of\r\ntransporting a family to Australia, or even to Canada, is considerable;\r\nand the question is, whether, with the means which it would require to\r\nconvey them to a distant shore, they might not be more profitably\r\nemployed at home.\r\n\r\nI probably shall be told that I propose schemes which are a great\r\ninterference with the rights of property. My opinion is that nothing can\r\nbe a greater interference and infringement of the rights of property\r\nthan the laws which regulate property now. I think that the landowners\r\nare under an impression that they have been maintaining great influence,\r\npolitical power, an hereditary aristocracy, and all those other\r\narrangements which some think should never be named without reverence\r\nand awe; that they have been accustomed to look at these things, and to\r\nfancy that they are worth the price they pay for them. I am of opinion\r\nthat the disadvantages under which those rights labour throughout the\r\nUnited Kingdom are extreme; but in Ireland the disadvantages are\r\nfollowed by results not known in this country.\r\n\r\nYou speak of interference with property; but I ask what becomes of the\r\nproperty of the poor man, which consists of his labour? Take those\r\n4,000,000 persons who live in the distressed districts, as described by\r\nthe right hon. Baronet the Member for Tamworth. Their property in labour\r\nis almost totally destroyed. There they are--men whom God made and\r\npermitted to come into this world, endowed with faculties like\r\nourselves, but who are unable to maintain themselves, and must either\r\nstarve or live upon others. The interference with their property has\r\nbeen enormous--so great as absolutely to destroy it. Now, I ask the\r\nlandlords of Ireland, whether living in the state in which they have\r\nlived for years is not infinitely worse than that which I have proposed\r\nfor them? Threatening letters by the post at breakfast-time--now and\r\nthen the aim of the assassin--poor-rates which are a grievous\r\ninterference with the rights of property, and this rate in aid, which\r\nthe gentlemen of Ulster declare to be directly opposed to all the rights\r\nof property--what can be worse?\r\n\r\nI shall be told that I am injuring aristocratical and territorial\r\ninfluence. What is that in Ireland worth to you now? What is Ireland\r\nworth to you at all? Is she not the very symbol and token of your\r\ndisgrace and humiliation to the whole world? Is she not an incessant\r\ntrouble to your Legislature, and the source of increased expense to your\r\npeople, already over-taxed? Is not your legislation all at fault in what\r\nit has hitherto done for that country? The people of Ulster say that we\r\nshall weaken the Union. It has been one of the misfortunes of the\r\nlegislation of this House that there has been no honest attempt to make\r\na union with the whole people of Ireland up to this time. We have had a\r\nunion with Ulster, but there has been no union with the whole people of\r\nIreland, and there never can be a union between the Government and the\r\npeople whilst such a state of things exists as has for many years past\r\nprevailed in the south and west of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Ireland at this moment is this--the rich are menaced\r\nwith ruin, and ruin from which, in their present course, they cannot\r\nescape; whilst the poor are menaced with starvation and death. There are\r\nhon. Gentlemen in this House, and there are other landed proprietors in\r\nIreland, who are as admirable in the performance of all their social\r\nduties as any men to be found in any part of the world. We have had\r\nbrilliant examples mentioned in this House; but those men themselves are\r\nsuffering their characters to be damaged by the present condition of\r\nIreland, and are undergoing a process which must end in their own ruin;\r\nbecause this demoralisation and pauperisation will go on in an extending\r\ncircle, and will engulf the whole property of Ireland in one common\r\nruin, unless something more be done than passing poor-laws and proposing\r\nrates in aid.\r\n\r\nSir, if ever there were an opportunity for a statesman, it is this. This\r\nis the hour undoubtedly, and we want the man. The noble Lord at the head\r\nof the Government has done many things for his country, for which I\r\nthank him as heartily as any man--he has shown on some occasions as much\r\nmoral courage as it is necessary, in the state of public opinion, upon\r\nany question, for a statesman to show; but I have been much disappointed\r\nthat, upon this Irish question, he has seemed to shrink from a full\r\nconsideration of the difficulty, and from a resolution to meet it\r\nfairly. The character of the present, the character of any Government\r\nunder such circumstances, must be at stake. The noble Lord cannot, in\r\nhis position, remain inactive. Let him be as innocent as he may, he can\r\nnever justify himself to the country, or to the world, or to posterity,\r\nif he remains at the head of this Imperial Legislature and is still\r\nunable, or unwilling, to bring forward measures for the restoration of\r\nIreland. I would address the same language also to the noble Lord at the\r\nhead of the Irish Government, who has won, I must say, the admiration of\r\nthe population of this country for the temper and manner in which he has\r\nadministered the government of Ireland. But he must bear in mind that it\r\nis not the highest effort of statesmanship to preserve the peace in a\r\ncountry where there are very few men anxious to go to war, and to\r\npreserve the peace, too, with 50,000 armed men at his command, and the\r\nwhole power of this empire to back him. All that may be necessary, and\r\npeace at all hazards must be secured; but if that distinguished Nobleman\r\nintends to be known hereafter as a statesman with regard to his rule in\r\nIreland, he must be prepared to suggest measures to the Government of a\r\nmore practical and directly operative character than any he has yet\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nSir, I am ashamed, I must say, of the course which we have taken upon\r\nthis question. Look at that great subscription that was raised three\r\nyears ago for Ireland. There was scarcely a part of the globe from which\r\nsubscriptions did not come. The Pope, as was very natural, subscribed--\r\nthe head of the great Mahometan empire, the Grand Seignior, sent his\r\nthousand pounds--the uttermost parts of the earth sent in their\r\ndonations. A tribe of Red Indians on the American continent sent their\r\nsubscription; and I have it on good authority that even the slaves on a\r\nplantation in one of the Carolinas subscribed their sorrowful mite that\r\nthe miseries of Ireland might be relieved. The whole world looked upon\r\nthe condition of Ireland, and helped to mitigate her miseries. What can\r\nwe say to all those contributors, who, now that they have paid, must he\r\nanxious to know if anything is done to prevent a recurrence of these\r\ncalamities? We must tell them with blushes that nothing has been done,\r\nbut that we are still going on with the poor-rates, and that, having\r\nexhausted the patience of the people of England in Parliamentary grants,\r\nwe are coming now with rates in aid, restricted altogether to the\r\nproperty of Ireland. That is what we have to tell them; whilst we have\r\nto acknowledge that our Constitution, boasted of as it has been for\r\ngenerations past, utterly fails to grapple with this great question.\r\n\r\nHon. Gentlemen turn with triumph to neighbouring countries, and speak in\r\nglowing terms of our glorious Constitution. It is true, that abroad\r\nthrones and dynasties have been overturned, whilst in England peace has\r\nreigned undisturbed. But take all the lives that have been lost in the\r\nlast twelve months in Europe amidst the convulsions that have occurred--\r\ntake all the cessation of trade, the destruction of industry, all the\r\ncrushing of hopes and hearts, and they will not compare for an instant\r\nwith the agonies which have been endured by the population of Ireland\r\nunder your glorious Constitution. And there are those who now say that\r\nthis is the ordering of Providence. I met an Irish gentleman the other\r\nnight, and, speaking upon the subject, he said that he saw no remedy,\r\nbut that it seemed as if the present state of things were the mode by\r\nwhich Providence intended to solve the question of Irish difficulties.\r\nBut let us not lay these calamities at the door of Providence; it were\r\nsinful in us, of all men, to do so. God has blessed Ireland--and does\r\nstill bless her--in position, in soil, in climate; He has not withdrawn\r\nHis promises, nor are they unfulfilled; there is still the sunshine and\r\nthe shower; still the seed-time and the harvest; and the affluent bosom\r\nof the earth yet offers sustenance for man. But man must do his part--we\r\nmust do our part--we must retrace our steps--we must shun the blunders,\r\nand, I would even say, the crimes of our past legislation. We must free\r\nthe land, and then we shall discover, and not till then, that industry,\r\nhopeful and remunerated--industry, free and inviolate, is the only sure\r\nfoundation on which can be reared the enduring edifice of union and of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nHABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, FEBRUARY 17, 1866.\r\n[The Fenian Conspiracy and threatened Insurrection in Ireland compelled\r\nthe Government to introduce a Bill to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act. It\r\nwas brought in suddenly, the House meeting on Saturday to consider it.]\r\n\r\nI OWE an apology to the Irish Members for stepping in to make an\r\nobservation to the House on this question. My strong interest in the\r\naffairs of their country, ever since I came into Parliament, will be my\r\nsufficient excuse. The Secretary of State, on the part of the Government\r\nof which he is a Member, has called us together on an unusual day and at\r\nan unusual hour, to consider a proposition of the greatest magnitude,\r\nand which we are informed is one of extreme urgency. If it be so, I hope\r\nit will not be understood that we are here merely to carry out the\r\nbehests of the Administration; and that we are to be permitted, if we\r\nchoose, to discuss this measure, and if possible to say something which\r\nmay mitigate the apparent harshness of the course which the Government\r\nfeels itself compelled to pursue.\r\n\r\nIt is now more than twenty-two years since I was first permitted to take\r\nmy seat in this House. During that time I have on many occasions, with\r\ngreat favour, been allowed to address it, but I declare that during the\r\nwhole of that period I have never risen to speak here under so strong a\r\nfeeling, as a Member of the House, of shame and of humiliation, as that\r\nby which I find myself oppressed at this moment. The Secretary of State\r\nproposes--as the right hon. Gentleman himself has said--to deprive no\r\ninconsiderable portion of the subjects of the Queen--our countrymen,\r\nwithin the United Kingdom--of the commonest, of the most precious, and\r\nof the most sacred right of the English Constitution, the right to their\r\npersonal freedom. From the statement of the Secretary of State it is\r\nclear that this is not asked to be done, or required to be done, with\r\nreference only to a small section of the Irish people. He has named\r\ngreat counties, wide districts, whole provinces, over which this alleged\r\nand undoubted disaffection has spread, and has proposed that five or six\r\nmillions of the inhabitants of the United Kingdom shall suffer the loss\r\nof that right of personal freedom that is guaranteed to all Her\r\nMajesty's subjects by the Constitution of these realms.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not believe that the Secretary of State has overstated his\r\ncase for the purpose of inducing the House to consent to his\r\nproposition. I believe that if the majority of the people of Ireland,\r\ncounted fairly out, had their will, and if they had the power, they\r\nwould unmoor the island from its fastenings in the deep, and move it at\r\nleast 2,000 miles to the West. And I believe, further, that if by\r\nconspiracy, or insurrection, or by that open agitation to which alone I\r\never would give any favour or consent, they could shake off the\r\nauthority, I will not say of the English Crown, but of the Imperial\r\nParliament, they would gladly do so.\r\n\r\nAn hon. Member from Ireland a few nights ago referred to the character\r\nof the Irish people. He said, and I believe it is true, that there is no\r\nChristian nation with which we are acquainted amongst the people of\r\nwhich crime of the ordinary character, as we reckon it in this country,\r\nis so rare as it is amongst his countrymen. He might have said, also,\r\nthat there is no people--whatever they may be at home--more industrious\r\nthan his countrymen in every other country but their own. He might have\r\nsaid more; that they are a people of a cheerful and joyous temperament.\r\nHe might have said more than this--that they are singularly grateful for\r\nkindnesses shown to them, and that of all the people of our race they\r\nare filled with the strongest sentiment of veneration.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, with such materials and with such a people, after centuries of\r\ngovernment--after sixty-five years of government by this House--you have\r\nthem embittered against your rule, and anxious only to throw off the\r\nauthority of the Crown and Queen of these realms. Now, this is not a\r\nsingle occasion we are discussing. This is merely an access of the\r\ncomplaint Ireland has been suffering under during the lifetime of the\r\noldest man in this House, that of chronic insurrection. No man can deny\r\nthis. I dare say a large number of the Members of this House, at the\r\ntime to which the right hon. Member for Buckinghamshire referred, heard\r\nthe same speech on the same subject, from the same Minister to whom we\r\nhave listened to-day. [Sir G. Grey: 'No!'] I certainly thought I heard\r\nthe right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for the Home Department\r\nmake a speech before on the same question, but he was a Minister of the\r\nGovernment on whose behalf a similar speech was made on the occasion\r\nreferred to, and no doubt concurred in every word that was uttered by\r\nhis Colleague.\r\n\r\nSixty-five years ago this country and this Parliament undertook to\r\ngovern Ireland. I will say nothing of the manner in which that duty was\r\nbrought upon us--except this--that it was by proceedings disgraceful and\r\ncorrupt to the last degree. I will say nothing of the pretences under\r\nwhich it was brought about but this--that the English Parliament and\r\npeople, and the Irish people too, were told, that if they once got rid\r\nof the Irish Parliament they would dethrone for ever Irish factions, and\r\nthat with a united Parliament we should become a united, and stronger,\r\nand happier people. During these sixty-five years--and on this point I\r\nask for the attention of the right hon. Gentleman (Mr. Disraeli) who has\r\njust spoken--there are only three considerable measures which Parliament\r\nhas passed in the interests of Ireland. One of them was the measure of\r\n1829, for the emancipation of the Catholics and to permit them to have\r\nseats in this House. But that measure, so just, so essential, and which,\r\nof course, is not ever to be recalled, was a measure which the chief\r\nMinister of the day, a great soldier, and a great judge of military\r\nmatters, admitted was passed under the menace of, and only because of,\r\nthe danger of civil war. The other two measures to which I have referred\r\nare that for the relief of the poor, and that for the sale of the\r\nincumbered estates; and those measures were introduced to the House and\r\npassed through the House in the emergency of a famine more severe than\r\nany that has desolated any Christian country of the world within the\r\nlast four hundred years.\r\n\r\nExcept on these two emergencies I appeal to every Irish Member, and to\r\nevery English Member who has paid any attention to the matter, whether\r\nthe statement is not true that this Parliament has done nothing for the\r\npeople of Ireland. And, more than that, their complaints have been met--\r\ncomplaints of their sufferings have been met--often by denial, often by\r\ninsult, often by contempt. And within the last few years we have heard\r\nfrom this very Treasury bench observations with regard to Ireland which\r\nno friend of Ireland or of England, and no Minister of the Crown, ought\r\nto have uttered with regard to that country. Twice in my Parliamentary\r\nlife this thing has been done--at least by the close of this day will\r\nhave been done--and measures of repression--measures for the suspension\r\nof the civil rights of the Irish people--have been brought into\r\nParliament and passed with extreme and unusual rapidity.\r\n\r\nI have not risen to blame the Secretary of State or to blame his\r\nColleagues for the act of to-day. There may be circumstances to justify\r\na proposition of this kind, and I am not here to deny that these\r\ncircumstances now exist; but what I complain of is this: there is no\r\nstatesmanship merely in acts of force and acts of repression. And more\r\nthan that, I have not observed since I have been in Parliament anything\r\non this Irish question that approaches to the dignity of statesmanship.\r\nThere has been, I admit, an improved administration in Ireland. There\r\nhave been Lord-Lieutenants anxious to be just, and there is one there\r\nnow who is probably as anxious to do justice as any man. We have\r\nobserved generally in the recent Trials a better tone and temper than\r\nwere ever witnessed under similar circumstances in Ireland before. But\r\nif I go back to the Ministers who have sat on the Treasury Bench since I\r\nfirst came into this House--Sir Robert Peel first, then Lord John\r\nRussell, then Lord Aberdeen, then Lord Derby, then Lord Palmerston, then\r\nLord Derby again, then Lord Palmerston again, and now Earl Russell--I\r\nsay that with regard to all these men, there has not been any approach\r\nto anything that history will describe as statesmanship on the part of\r\nthe English Government towards Ireland. There were Coercion Bills in\r\nabundance--Arms Bills Session after Session--lamentations like that of\r\nthe right hon. Gentleman the Member for Buckinghamshire (Mr. Disraeli)\r\nthat the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act was not made perpetual by a\r\nclause which he laments was repealed.\r\n\r\nThere have been Acts for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, like\r\nthat which we are now discussing; but there has been no statesmanship.\r\nMen, the most clumsy and brutal, can do these things; but we want men of\r\nhigher temper--men of higher genius--men of higher patriotism to deal\r\nwith the affairs of Ireland. I should like to know whether those\r\nstatesmen who hold great offices have themselves comprehended the nature\r\nof this question. If they have not, they have been manifestly ignorant;\r\nand if they have comprehended it and have not dealt with it, they have\r\nconcealed that which they knew from the people, and evaded the duty they\r\nowed to their Sovereign. I do not want to speak disrespectfully of men\r\nin office. It is not my custom in this House. I know something of the\r\nworrying labours to which they are subjected, and I know not how from\r\nday to day they bear the burden of the labour imposed upon them; but\r\nstill I lament that those who wear the garb--enjoy the emoluments--and I\r\nhad almost said usurp the dignity of statesmanship, sink themselves\r\nmerely into respectable and honourable administrators, when there is a\r\nwhole nation under the sovereignty of the Queen calling for all their\r\nanxious thoughts--calling for the highest exercise of the highest\r\nqualities of the statesman.\r\n\r\nI put the question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He is the only\r\nman of this Government whom I have heard of late years who has spoken as\r\nif he comprehended this question, and he made a speech in the last\r\nSession of Parliament which was not without its influence both in\r\nEngland and in Ireland. I should like to ask him whether this Irish\r\nquestion is above the stature of himself and of his Colleagues? If it\r\nbe, I ask them to come down from the high places which they occupy, and\r\ntry to learn the art of legislation and government before they practise\r\nit. I myself believe, if we could divest ourselves of the feelings\r\nengendered by party strife, we might come to some better result. Take\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer. Is there in any legislative assembly in\r\nthe world a man, as the world judges, of more transcendent capacity? I\r\nwill say even, is there a man with a more honest wish to do good to the\r\ncountry in which he occupies so conspicuous a place?\r\n\r\nTake the right hon. Gentleman opposite, the leader of the Opposition--is\r\nthere in any legislative assembly in the world, at this moment, a man\r\nleading an Opposition of more genius for his position, who has given in\r\nevery way but one in which proof can be given that he is competent to\r\nthe highest duties of the highest offices of the State? Well, but these\r\nmen--great men whom we on this side and you on that side, to a large\r\nextent, admire and follow fight for office, and the result is they sit\r\nalternately, one on this side and one on that. But suppose it were\r\npossible for these men, with their intellects, with their far-reaching\r\nvision, to examine this question thoroughly, and to say for once,\r\nwhether this leads to office and to the miserable notoriety that men\r\ncall fame which springs from office, or not, 'If it be possible, we will\r\nact with loyalty to the Sovereign and justice to the people; and if it\r\nbe possible, we will make Ireland a strength and not a weakness to the\r\nBritish Empire.' It is from this fighting with party, and for party, and\r\nfor the gains which party gives, that there is so little result from the\r\ngreat intellect of such men as these. Like the captive Samson of old,--\r\n\r\n  They grind in brazen fetters, under task,\r\n  With their Heaven-gifted strength--'\r\n\r\nand the country and the world gain little by those faculties which God\r\nhas given them for the blessing of the country and the world.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State and the right hon. Gentleman opposite have\r\nreferred, even in stronger language, to the unhappy fact that much of\r\nwhat now exists in Ireland has been brought there from the United States\r\nof America. That is not a fact for us to console ourselves with; it only\r\nadds to the gravity and the difficulty of this question. You may depend\r\nupon it that if the Irish in America, having left this country, settle\r\nthere with so strong a hostility to us, they have had their reasons--and\r\nif being there with that feeling of affection for their native country\r\nwhich in all other cases in which we are not concerned we admire and\r\nreverence, they interfere in Ireland and stir up there the sedition that\r\nnow exists, depend upon it there is in the condition of Ireland a state\r\nof things which greatly favours their attempts. There can be no\r\ncontinued fire without fuel, and all the Irish in America, and all the\r\ncitizens of America, united together, with all their organization and\r\nall their vast resources, would not raise the very slightest flame of\r\nsedition or of insurrectionary movement in England or in Scotland. I\r\nwant to know why they can do it in Ireland? Are you to say, as some\r\npeople say in America and in Jamaica when speaking of the black man,\r\nthat 'Nothing can be made of the Irishman'?\r\n\r\nEverything can be made of him in every country but his own. When he has\r\npassed through the American school--I speak of him as a child, or in the\r\nsecond generation of the Irish emigrant in that country--he is as\r\nindustrious, as frugal, as independent, as loyal, as good a citizen of\r\nthe American Republic, as any man born within the dominions of that\r\nPower. Why is it not so in Ireland? I have asked the question before,\r\nand I will ask it again--it is a pertinent question, and it demands an\r\nanswer. Why is it that no Scotchman who leaves Scotland--and the Scotch\r\nhave been taunted and ridiculed for being so ready to leave their\r\ncountry for a better climate and a better soil--how comes it, I ask,\r\nthat no Scotchman who emigrates to the United States, and no Englishman\r\nwho plants himself there, cherishes the smallest hostility to the\r\npeople, to the institutions, or to the Government of his native country?\r\nWhy does every Irishman who leaves his country and goes to the United\r\nStates immediately settle himself down there, resolved to better his\r\ncondition in life, but with a feeling of ineradicable hatred to the laws\r\nand institutions of the land of his birth? Is not this a fit question\r\nfor statesmanship?\r\n\r\nIf the Secretary of State, since his last measure was brought in, now\r\neighteen years ago, had had time, in the multiplicity of his duties, to\r\nconsider this question; instead of now moving for the suspension of the\r\nHabeas Corpus Act, he might possibly have been rejoicing at the\r\nuniversal loyalty which prevailed, not throughout Great Britain only,\r\nbut throughout the whole population of Ireland. I spent two autumns in\r\nIreland in the years 1849 and 1852, and I recollect making a speech in\r\nthis House not long afterwards, which some persons thought was not very\r\nwide of the mark. I recommended the Ministers of that time to take an\r\nopportunity to hold an Irish Session of the Imperial Parliament--to have\r\nno great questions discussed connected with the ordinary matters which\r\nare brought before us, but to keep Parliament to the consideration of\r\nthis Irish question solely, and to deal with those great matters which\r\nare constant sources of complaint; and I said that a Session that was so\r\ndevoted to such a blessed and holy work, would be a Session, if it were\r\nsuccessful, that would stand forth in all our future history as one of\r\nthe noblest which had ever passed in the annals of the Imperial\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, a few days ago everybody in this House, with two or three\r\nexceptions, was taking an oath at that table. It is called the Oath of\r\nAllegiance. It is meant at once to express loyalty and to keep men\r\nloyal. I do not think it generally does bind men to loyalty, if they\r\nhave not loyalty without it. I hold loyalty to consist, in a country\r\nlike this, as much in doing justice to the people as in guarding the\r\nCrown; for I believe there is no guardianship of the Crown in a country\r\nlike this, where the Crown is not supposed to rest absolutely upon\r\nforce, so safe as that of which we know more in our day probably than\r\nhas been known in former periods of our history, when the occupant of\r\nthe Throne is respected, admired, and loved by the general people. Now,\r\nhow comes it that these great statesmen whom I have named, with all\r\ntheir Colleagues, some of them as eminent almost as their leaders, have\r\nnever tried what they could do--have never shown their loyalty to the\r\nCrown by endeavouring to make the Queen as safe in the hearts of the\r\npeople of Ireland as she is in the hearts of the people of England and\r\nof Scotland?\r\n\r\nBear in mind that the Queen of England can do almost nothing in these\r\nmatters. By our Constitution the Crown can take no direct part in them.\r\nThe Crown cannot direct the policy of the Government; nay, the Crown\r\ncannot, without the consent of this House, even select its Ministers;\r\ntherefore the Crown is helpless in this matter. And we have in this\r\ncountry a Queen, who, in all the civilized nations of the world, is\r\nlooked upon as a model of a Sovereign, and yet her name and fame are\r\ndiscredited and dishonoured by circumstances such as those which have\r\ntwice during her reign called us together to agree to a proposition like\r\nthat which is brought before us to-day.\r\n\r\nThere is an instructive anecdote to be found in the annals of the\r\nChinese Empire. In a remote province there was an insurrection. The\r\nEmperor put down the insurrection, but he abased and humbled himself\r\nbefore the people, and said that if he had been guilty of neglect he\r\nacknowledged his guilt, and he humbled himself before those on whom he\r\nhad brought the evil of an insurrection in one of his provinces. The\r\nQueen of these realms is not so responsible. She cannot thus humble\r\nherself; but I say that your statesmen for the last forty--for the last\r\nsixty--years are thus guilty, and that they ought to humble themselves\r\nbefore the people of this country for their neglect. But I have heard\r\nfrom Members in this House--I have seen much writing in newspapers--and\r\nI have heard of speeches elsewhere, in which some of us, who advocate\r\nwhat we believe to be a great and high morality in public affairs, are\r\ncharged with dislike to the institutions, and even disloyalty to the\r\ndynasty which rules in England. There can be nothing more offensive,\r\nnothing more unjust, nothing more utterly false. We who ask Parliament,\r\nin dealing with Ireland, to deal with it upon the unchangeable\r\nprinciples of justice, are the friends of the people, and the really\r\nloyal advisers and supporters of the Throne.\r\n\r\nAll history teaches us that it is not in human nature that men should be\r\ncontent under any system of legislation, and of institutions such as\r\nexist in Ireland. You may pass this Bill, you may put the Home\r\nSecretary's five hundred men into gaol--you may do more than this, you\r\nmay suppress the conspiracy and put down the insurrection, but the\r\nmoment it is suppressed there will still remain the germs of this\r\nmalady, and from those germs will grow up as heretofore another crop of\r\ninsurrection and another harvest of misfortune. And it may be that those\r\nwho sit here eighteen years after this moment will find another Ministry\r\nand another Secretary of State ready to propose to you another\r\nadministration of the same ever-failing and ever-poisonous medicine. I\r\nsay there is a mode of making Ireland loyal. I say that the Parliament\r\nof England having abolished the Parliament of Ireland is doubly bound to\r\nexamine what that mode is, and, if it can discover it, to adopt it. I\r\nsay that the Minister who occupies office in this country, merely that\r\nhe may carry on the daily routine of administration, who dares not\r\ngrapple with this question, who dares not go into Opposition, and who\r\nwill sit anywhere except where he can tell his mind freely to the House\r\nand to the country, may have a high position in the country, but he is\r\nnot a statesman, nor is he worthy of the name.\r\n\r\nSir, I shall not oppose the proposition of the right hon. Gentleman. The\r\ncircumstances, I presume, are such that the course which is about to be\r\npursued is perhaps the only merciful course for Ireland. But I suppose\r\nit is not the intention of the Government, in the case of persons who\r\nare arrested, and against whom any just complaint can be made, to do\r\nanything more than that which the ordinary law permits, and that when\r\nmen are brought to trial they will be brought to trial with all the\r\nfairness and all the advantages which the ordinary law gives. I should\r\nsay what was most unjust to the Gentlemen sitting on that (the Treasury)\r\nbench, if I said aught else than that I believe they are as honestly\r\ndisposed to do right in this matter as I am and as I have ever been. I\r\nimplore them, if they can, to shake off the trammels of doubt and fear\r\nwith regard to this question, and to say something that may be soothing--\r\nsomething that may give hope to Ireland.\r\n\r\nI voted the other night with the hon. Member for Tralee (The\r\nO'Donoghue). We were in a very small minority. ['Hear, hear,'] Yes, I\r\nhave often been in small minorities. The hon. Gentleman would have been\r\ncontent with a word of kindness and of sympathy, not for conspiracy, but\r\nfor the people of Ireland. That word was not inserted in the Queen's\r\nspeech, and to-night the Home Secretary has made a speech urging the\r\nHouse to the course which, I presume, is about to be pursued; but he did\r\nnot in that speech utter a single sentence with regard to a question\r\nwhich lies behind, and is greater and deeper than that which is\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nI hope, Sir, that if Ministers feel themselves bound to take this course\r\nof suspending the common rights of personal freedom to a whole nation,\r\nat least they will not allow this debate to close without giving to us\r\nand to that nation some hope that before long measures will be\r\nconsidered and will be introduced which will tend to create the same\r\nloyalty in Ireland that exists in Great Britain. If every man outside\r\nthe walls of this House who has the interest of the whole Empire at\r\nheart were to speak here, what would he say to this House? Let not one\r\nday elapse, let not another Session pass, until you have done something\r\nto wipe off this blot--for blot it is upon the reign of the Queen, and\r\nscandal it is to the civilization and to the justice of the people of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, OCTOBER 30, 1866.\r\n[Mr. Bright was invited to a Public Banquet in Dublin. The invitation\r\nwas signed by more than twenty Members of Parliament, and by a large\r\nnumber of influential Members of the Liberal Party in Ireland. This\r\nspeech was spoken at the Banquet. The O'Donoghue was in the Chair.]\r\n\r\nI feel myself more embarrassed than I can well describe at the difficult\r\nbut honourable position in which I find myself to-night. I am profoundly\r\nmoved by the exceeding and generous kindness with which you have\r\nreceived me, and all I can do is to thank you for it, and to say how\r\ngrateful to my heart it is that such a number as I see before me--I will\r\nsay of my countrymen--have approved generally of the political course\r\nwhich I have pursued. But I may assure you that the difficulty of this\r\nposition is not at all of my seeking. I heard during the last Session of\r\nParliament that if I was likely to come to Ireland during the autumn, it\r\nwas not improbable that I should be asked to some banquet of this kind\r\nin this city. I had an intention of coming, but being moved by this\r\nkindness or menace, I changed my mind, and spent some weeks in Scotland\r\ninstead of Ireland. When I found from the newspapers that an invitation\r\nwas being signed, asking me to come here, I wrote to my honourable\r\nfriend, Sir John Gray, to ask him if he would be kind enough to put an\r\nextinguisher upon the project, inasmuch as I was not intending to cross\r\nthe Channel. He said that the matter had proceeded so far that it was\r\nimpossible to interfere with it--that it must take its natural course;\r\nand the result was that I received an invitation signed, I think, by\r\nabout one hundred and forty names, amongst whom there were not less, I\r\nbelieve, than twenty-two Members of the House of Commons. Well, as you\r\nwill probably imagine, I felt that this invitation was of such a nature\r\nthat, although it was most difficult to accede to it, it was impossible\r\nto refuse it. This accounts for my being here to-night, and is a simple\r\nexplanation of what has taken place.\r\n\r\nI said amongst the signatures were the names of not less than twenty-two\r\nMembers of the House of Commons. I speak with grief when I say that one\r\nof our friends who signed that invitation is no longer with us. I had\r\nnot the pleasure of a long acquaintance with Mr. Dillon, but I shall\r\ntake this opportunity of saying that during the last Session of\r\nParliament I formed a very high opinion of his character. There was that\r\nin his eye and in the tone of his voice--in his manner altogether, which\r\nmarked him for an honourable and a just man. I venture to say that his\r\nsad and sudden removal is a great loss to Ireland. I believe amongst all\r\nher worthy sons, Ireland has had no worthier and no nobler son than John\r\nBlake Dillon.\r\n\r\nI shall not be wrong if I assume that the ground of my visit to Dublin\r\nis to be found first in the sympathy which I have always felt and\r\nexpressed for the condition, and for the wrongs, and for the rights of\r\nthe people of Ireland, and probably also because I am supposed, in some\r\ndegree, to represent some amount of the opinion in England, which is\r\nalso favourable to the true interests of this island.\r\n\r\nThe Irish question is a question that has often been discussed, and yet\r\nit remains at this day as much a question as it has been for centuries\r\npast. The Parliament of Kilkenny,--a Parliament that sat a very long\r\ntime ago, if indeed it was a Parliament at all,--it was a Parliament\r\nthat sat about five hundred years ago, which proposed, I believe, to\r\ninflict a very heavy penalty if any Irishman's horse was found grazing\r\non any Englishman's land,--this Parliament left on record a question,\r\nwhich it may be worth our while to consider to-night. It put this\r\nquestion to the King, 'How comes it to pass that the King was never the\r\nricher for Ireland?' We, five hundred years afterwards, venture to ask\r\nthis question, 'Why is it that the Queen, or the Crown, or the United\r\nKingdom, or the Empire, is never the richer for Ireland?'--and if you\r\nwill permit me I will try to give you as clearly as I can something like\r\nan answer to that very old question. What it may be followed by is this,\r\nHow is it that we, the Imperial Parliament, cannot act so as to bring\r\nabout in Ireland contentment and tranquillity, and a solid union between\r\nIreland and Great Britain? And that means, further, How can we improve\r\nthe condition and change the minds of the people of Ireland? Some say (I\r\nhave heard many who say it in England, and I am afraid there are\r\nIrishmen also who would say it), that there is some radical defect in\r\nthe Irish character which prevents the condition of Ireland being so\r\nsatisfactory as is the condition of England and of Scotland. Now, I am\r\ninclined to believe that whatever there is that is defective in any\r\nportion of the Irish people comes not from their race, but from their\r\nhistory, and from the conditions to which they have been subjected.\r\n\r\nI am told by those in authority that in Ireland there is a remarkable\r\nabsence of crime. I have heard since I came to Dublin, from those well\r\nacquainted with the facts, that there is probably no great city in the\r\nworld--in the civilized and Christian world--of equal population with\r\nthe city in which we are now assembled, where there is so little crime\r\ncommitted. And I find that the portion of the Irish people which has\r\nfound a home in the United States has in the period of sixteen years--\r\nbetween 1848 and 1864--remitted about 13,000,000_l_. sterling to\r\ntheir friends and relatives in Ireland. I am bound to place these facts\r\nin opposition to any statements that I hear as to any radical defects of\r\nthe Irish character. I say that it would be much more probable that the\r\ndefect lies in the Government and in the law. But there are some others\r\nwho say that the great misfortune of Ireland is in the existence of the\r\nnoxious race of political agitators. Well, as to that I may state, that\r\nthe most distinguished political agitators that have appeared during the\r\nlast hundred years in Ireland are Grattan and O'Connell, and I should\r\nsay that he must be either a very stupid or a very base Irishman who\r\nwould wish to erase the achievements of Grattan and O'Connell from the\r\nannals of his country.\r\n\r\nBut some say (and this is not an uncommon thing)--some say that the\r\npriests of the popular Church in Ireland have been the cause of much\r\ndiscontent. I believe there is no class of men in Ireland who have a\r\ndeeper interest in a prosperous and numerous community than the priests\r\nof the Catholic Church; and further, I believe that no men have suffered\r\nmore--have suffered more, I mean, in mind and in feeling--from\r\nwitnessing the miseries and the desolation which during the last century\r\n(to go no further back) have stricken and afflicted the Irish people.\r\n\r\nBut some others say that there is no ground of complaint, because the\r\nlaws and institutions of Ireland are, in the main, the same as the laws\r\nand institutions of England and Scotland. They say, for example, that if\r\nthere be an Established Church in Ireland there is one in England and\r\none in Scotland, and that Nonconformists are very numerous both in\r\nEngland and in Scotland; but they seem to forget this fact, that the\r\nChurch in England or the Church in Scotland is not in any sense a\r\nforeign Church--that it has not been imposed in past times, and is not\r\nmaintained by force--that it is not in any degree the symbol of\r\nconquest--that it is not the Church of a small minority, absorbing the\r\necclesiastical revenues and endowments of a whole kingdom; and they omit\r\nto remember or to acknowledge that if any Government attempted to plant\r\nby force the Episcopal Church in Scotland or the Catholic Church in\r\nEngland, the disorders and discontent which have prevailed in Ireland\r\nwould be witnessed with tenfold intensity and violence in Great Britain.\r\nAnd these persons whom I am describing also say that the land laws in\r\nIreland are the same as the land laws in England. It would be easy to\r\nshow that the land laws in England are bad enough, and that but for the\r\noutlet of the population, afforded by our extraordinary manufacturing\r\nindustry, the condition of England would in all probability become quite\r\nas bad as the condition of Ireland has been; but if the countries differ\r\nwith regard to land and the management of it in their customs, may it\r\nnot be reasonable that they should also differ in their laws?\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the landowner is the creature of conquest, not of conquest of\r\neight hundred years ago, but of conquest completed only two hundred\r\nyears ago; and it may be well for us to remember, and for all Englishmen\r\nto remember, that succeeding that transfer of the land to the new-comers\r\nfrom Great Britain, there followed a system of law, known by the name of\r\nthe Penal Code, of the most ingenious cruelty, and such as, I believe,\r\nhas never in modern times been inflicted on any Christian people.\r\nUnhappily, on this account, the wound which was opened by the conquest\r\nhas never been permitted to be closed, and thus we have had landowners\r\nin Ireland of a different race, of a different religion, and of\r\ndifferent ideas from the great bulk of the people, and there has been a\r\nconstant and bitter war between the owners and occupiers of the soil.\r\nNow, up to this point I suppose that oven the gentlemen who were dining\r\ntogether the other evening in Belfast would probably agree with me,\r\nbecause what I have stated is mere matter of notorious history, and to\r\nbe found in every book which has treated of the course of Irish affairs\r\nduring the last two hundred years. But I think they would agree with me\r\neven further than this. They would say that Ireland is a land which has\r\nbeen torn by religious factions, and torn by these factions at least in\r\nthe North as much as in the South; and I think they would be doing less\r\nthan justice to the inhabitants of the North if they said that they had\r\nin any degree come short of the people of the South in the intensity of\r\ntheir passionate feelings with regard to their Church.\r\n\r\nBut Ireland has been more than this--it has been a land of evictions--a\r\nword which, I suspect, is scarcely known in any other civilized country.\r\nIt is a country from which thousands of families have been driven by the\r\nwill of the landowners and the power of the law. It is a country where\r\nhave existed, to a great extent, those dread tribunals known by the\r\ncommon name of secret societies, by which, in pursuit of what some men\r\nhave thought to be justice, there have been committed crimes of\r\nappalling guilt in the eye of the whole world. It is a country, too, in\r\nwhich--and it is the only Christian country of which it may be said for\r\nsome centuries past--it is a country in which a famine of the most\r\ndesolating character has prevailed even during our own time. I think I\r\nwas told in 1849, as I stood in the burial-ground at Skibbereen, that at\r\nleast 400 people who had died of famine were buried within the quarter\r\nof an acre of ground on which I was then looking. It is a country, too,\r\nfrom which there has been a greater emigration by sea within a given\r\ntime than has been known at any time from any other country in the\r\nworld. It is a country where there has been, for generations past, a\r\ngeneral sense of wrong, out of which has grown a state of chronic\r\ninsurrection; and at this very moment when I speak, the general\r\nsafeguard of constitutional liberty is withdrawn, and we meet in this\r\nhall, and I speak here tonight, rather by the forbearance and permission\r\nof the Irish executive than under the protection of the common\r\nsafeguards of the rights and liberties of the people of the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nI venture to say that this is a miserable and a humiliating picture to\r\ndraw of this country. Bear in mind that I am not speaking of Poland\r\nsuffering under the conquest of Russia. There is a gentleman, now a\r\ncandidate for an Irish county, who is very great upon the wrongs of\r\nPoland; but I have found him always in the House of Commons taking sides\r\nwith that great party which has systematically supported the wrongs of\r\nIreland. I am not speaking about Hungary, or of Venice as she was under\r\nthe rule of Austria, or of the Greeks under the dominion of the Turk,\r\nbut I am speaking of Ireland--part of the United Kingdom--part of that\r\nwhich boasts itself to be the most civilized and the most Christian\r\nnation in the world. I took the liberty recently, at a meeting in\r\nGlasgow, to say that I believed it was impossible for a class to govern\r\na great nation wisely and justly. Now, in Ireland there has been a field\r\nin which all the principles of the Tory party have had their complete\r\nexperiment and development. You have had the country gentleman in all\r\nhis power. You have had any number of Acts of Parliament which the\r\nancient Parliament of Ireland or the Parliament of the United Kingdom\r\ncould give him. You have had the Established Church supported by the\r\nlaw, even to the extent, not many years ago, of collecting its revenues\r\nby the aid of military force. In point of fact, I believe it would be\r\nimpossible to imagine a state of things in which the principles of the\r\nTory party have had a more entire and complete opportunity for their\r\ntrial than they have had within the limits of this island. And yet what\r\nhas happened? This, surely. That the kingdom has been continually\r\nweakened--that the harmony of the empire has been disturbed, and that\r\nthe mischief has not been confined to the United Kingdom, but has spread\r\nto the Colonies. And at this moment, as we know by every arrival from\r\nthe United States, the colony of Canada is exposed to danger of\r\ninvasion--that it is forced to keep on foot soldiers which it otherwise\r\nwould not want, and to involve itself in expenses which threaten to be\r\nruinous to its financial condition, and all that it may defend itself\r\nfrom Irishmen hostile to England who are settled in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Government of Lord Derby at this moment is doing exactly\r\nthat which the Government of Lord North did nearly a hundred years ago--\r\nit is sending out troops across the Atlantic to fight Irishmen who are\r\nthe bitter enemies of England on the American continent. Now, I believe\r\nevery gentleman in this room will admit that all that I have said is\r\nliterally true. And if it be true, what conclusion are we to come to? Is\r\nit that the law which rules in Ireland is bad, but the people good; or\r\nthat the law is good, but the people bad? Now, let us, if we can, get\r\nrid for a moment of Episcopalianism, Presbyterianism, Protestantism, and\r\nOrangeism on the one hand, and of Catholicism, Romanism, and Ultra-\r\nmontanism on the other,--let us for a moment get beyond all these\r\n'isms,' and try if we can discover what it is that is the great evil in\r\nyour country. I shall ask you only to turn your eye upon two points--the\r\nfirst is the Established Church, and the second is the tenure of land.\r\nThe Church may be said to affect the soul and sentiment of the country,\r\nand the land question may be said to affect the means of life and the\r\ncomforts of the people.\r\n\r\nI shall not blame the bishops and clergy of the Established Church.\r\nThere may be, and I doubt not there are amongst them, many pious and\r\ndevoted men, who labour to the utmost of their power to do good in the\r\ndistrict which is committed to their care; but I venture to say this,\r\nthat if they were all good and all pious, it would not in a national\r\npoint of view compensate for this one fatal error--the error of their\r\nexistence as the ministers of an Established Protestant Church in\r\nIreland. Every man of them is necessarily in his district a symbol of\r\nthe supremacy of the few and of the subjection of the many; and although\r\nthe amount of the revenue of the Established Church as the sum payable\r\nby the whole nation may not be considerable, yet bear in mind that it is\r\noften the galling of the chain which is more tormenting than the weight\r\nof it. I believe that the removal of the Established Church would create\r\na new political and social atmosphere in Ireland--that it would make the\r\npeople feel that old things had passed away--that all things had become\r\nnew--that an Irishman and his faith were no longer to be condemned in\r\nhis own country--and that for the first time the English people and the\r\nEnglish Parliament intended to do full justice to Ireland.\r\n\r\nNow, leaving the Established Church, I come to the question of the land.\r\nI have said that the ownership of the land in Ireland came originally\r\nfrom conquest and from confiscation, and, as a matter of course, there\r\nwas created a great gulf between the owner and the occupier, and from\r\nthat time to this doubtless there has been wanting that sympathy which\r\nexists to a large extent in Great Britain, and that ought to exist in\r\nevery country. I am told--you can answer it if I am wrong--that it is\r\nnot common in Ireland now to give leases to tenants, especially to\r\nCatholic tenants. If that be so, then the security for the property of\r\nthe tenant rests only upon the good feeling and favour of the owner of\r\nthe land, for the laws, as we know, have been made by the landowners,\r\nand many propositions for the advantage of the tenants have\r\nunfortunately been too little considered by Parliament. The result is\r\nthat you have bad farming, bad dwelling-houses, bad temper, and\r\neverything bad connected with the occupation and cultivation of land in\r\nIreland. One of the results--a result the most appalling--is this, that\r\nyour population are fleeing from your country and seeking a refuge in a\r\ndistant land. On this point I wish to refer to a letter which I received\r\na few days ago from a most esteemed citizen of Dublin. He told me that\r\nhe believed that a very large portion of what he called the poor,\r\namongst Irishmen, sympathized with any scheme or any proposition that\r\nwas adverse to the Imperial Government. He said further, that the people\r\nhere are rather in the country than of it, and that they are looking\r\nmore to America than they are looking to England. I think there is a\r\ngood deal in that. When we consider how many Irishmen have found a\r\nrefuge in America, I do not know how we can wonder at that statement.\r\n\r\nYou will recollect that when the ancient Hebrew prophet prayed in his\r\ncaptivity he prayed with his window opened towards Jerusalem. You know\r\nthat the followers of Mahommed, when they pray, turn their faces towards\r\nMecca. When the Irish peasant asks for food, and freedom, and blessing,\r\nhis eye follows the setting sun; the aspirations of his heart reach\r\nbeyond the wide Atlantic, and in spirit he grasps hands with the great\r\nRepublic of the West. If this be so, I say, then, that the disease is\r\nnot only serious, but it is even desperate; but desperate as it is, I\r\nbelieve there is a certain remedy for it, if the people and the\r\nParliament of the United Kingdom are willing to apply it. Now, if it\r\nwere possible, would it not be worth while to change the sentiments and\r\nimprove the condition of the Irish cultivators of the soil? If we were\r\nto remove the State Church, there would still be a Church, but it would\r\nnot be a supremacy Church. The Catholics of Ireland have no idea of\r\nsaying that Protestantism in its various forms shall not exist in their\r\nisland. There would still be a Church, but it would be a free Church of\r\na section of a free people. I will not go into details about the change.\r\nDoubtless every man would say that the present occupants of the livings\r\nshould not, during their lifetime, be disturbed; but if the principle of\r\nthe abolition of the State Church were once fixed and accepted, it would\r\nnot be difficult to arrange the details that would be satisfactory to\r\nthe people of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWho objects to this? The men who are in favour of supremacy, and the men\r\nwho have a fanatical hatred of what they call Popery. To honest and good\r\nmen of the Protestant Church and of the Protestant faith there is no\r\nreason whatever to fear this change. What has the voluntary system done\r\nin Scotland? What has it done amongst the Nonconformists of England?\r\nWhat has it done amongst the population of Wales? and what has it done\r\namongst the Catholic population of your own Ireland? In my opinion, the\r\nabolition of the Established Church would give Protestantism itself\r\nanother chance. I believe there has been in Ireland no other enemy of\r\nProtestantism so injurious as the Protestant State Establishment. It has\r\nbeen loaded for two hundred years with the sins of bad government and\r\nbad laws, and whatever may have been the beauty and the holiness of its\r\ndoctrine or of its professors, it has not been able to hold its ground,\r\nloaded as it has been by the sins of a bad government. One effect of the\r\nEstablished Church has been this, the making Catholicism in Ireland not\r\nonly a faith but a patriotism, for it was not likely that any member of\r\nthe Catholic Church would incline in the slightest degree to\r\nProtestantism so long as it presented itself to his eyes as a wrong-doer\r\nand full of injustice in connection with the government of his country.\r\n\r\nBut if honest Protestantism has nothing to fear from the changes that I\r\nwould recommend, what has the honest landowner to fear? The history of\r\nEurope and America for the last one hundred years affords scarcely any\r\npicture more painful than that which is afforded by the landowners of\r\nthis kingdom. The Irish landowner has been different from every other\r\nlandowner, for the bulk of his land has only been about half cultivated,\r\nand he has had to collect his rents by a process approaching the evils\r\nof civil war. His property has been very insecure--the sale of it\r\nsometimes has been rendered impossible. The landowner himself has often\r\nbeen hated by those who ought to have loved him. He has been banished\r\nfrom his ancestral home by terror, and not a few have lost their lives\r\nwithout the sympathy of those who ought to have been their protectors\r\nand their friends. I would like to ask, what can be much worse than\r\nthis? If in this country fifty years ago, as in Prussia, there had\r\narisen statesmen who would have taken one-third or one-half the land\r\nfrom the landowners of Ireland, and made it over to their tenants, I\r\nbelieve that the Irish landowner, great as would have been the injustice\r\nof which he might have complained, would in all probability have been\r\nricher and happier than he has been.\r\n\r\nWhat is the first remedy which you would propose? Clearly this--that\r\nwhich is the most easily applicable and which would most speedily touch\r\nthe condition of the country. It is this--that the property which the\r\ntenant shall invest or create in his farm shall be secured to the tenant\r\nby law. I believe that if Parliament were fairly to enact this it would\r\nmake a change in the whole temper of the country. I recollect in the\r\nyear 1849 being down in the county of Wexford. I called at the house of\r\nan old farmer of the name of Stafford, who lived in a very good house,\r\nthe best farm-house, I think, that I had seen since leaving Dublin. He\r\nlived on his own farm, which he had bought fifteen years before. The\r\nhouse was a house which he had himself built. He was a venerable old\r\nman, and we had some very interesting conversation with him. I asked how\r\nit was he had so good a house? He said the farm was his own, and the\r\nhouse was his own, and, as no man could disturb him, he had made it a\r\nmuch better house than was common for the farmers of Ireland. I said to\r\nhim, 'If all the farmers of Ireland had the same security for the\r\ncapital they laid out on their farms, what would be the result?' The old\r\nman almost sprang out of his chair, and said, 'Sir, if you will give us\r\nthat encouragement, we will _bate_ the hunger out of Ireland.' It\r\nis said that all this must be left to contract between the landlord and\r\nthe tenant; but the public, which may be neither landlord nor tenant,\r\nhas a great interest in this question; and I maintain that the interests\r\nof the public require that Parliament should secure to the tenant the\r\nproperty which he has invested in his farm. But I would not stop here.\r\n\r\nThere is another, and what I should call a more permanent and far-\r\nreaching remedy for the evils of Ireland, and those persons who stickle\r\nso much for political economy I hope will follow me in this. The great\r\nevil of Ireland is this--that the Irish people--the Irish nation--are\r\ndispossessed of the soil, and what we ought to do is to provide for, and\r\naid in, their restoration to it by all measures of justice. Why should\r\nwe tolerate in Ireland the law of primogeniture? Why should we tolerate\r\nthe system of entails? Why should the object of the law be to accumulate\r\nland in great masses in few hands, and to make it almost impossible for\r\npersons of small means, and tenant-farmers, to become possessors of\r\nland? If you go to other countries--for example, to Norway, to Denmark,\r\nto Holland, to Belgium, to France, to Germany, to Italy, or to the\r\nUnited States, you will find that in all these countries those laws of\r\nwhich I complain have been abolished, and the land is just as free to\r\nbuy and sell, and hold and cultivate, as any other description of\r\nproperty in the kingdom. No doubt your Landed Estates Court and your\r\nRecord of Titles Act were good measures, but they were good because they\r\nwere in the direction that I want to travel farther in.\r\n\r\nBut I would go farther than that; I would deal with the question of\r\nabsenteeism. I am not going to propose to tax absentees; but if my\r\nadvice were taken, we should have a Parliamentary Commission empowered\r\nto buy up the large estates in Ireland belonging to the English\r\nnobility, for the purpose of selling them on easy terms to the occupiers\r\nof the farms and to the tenantry of Ireland. Now, let me be fairly\r\nunderstood. I am not proposing to tax absentees; I am not proposing to\r\ntake any of their property from them; but I propose this, that a\r\nParliamentary Commission should be empowered to treat for the purchase\r\nof those large estates with a view of selling them to the tenantry of\r\nIreland. Now, here are some of them--the present Prime Minister Lord\r\nDerby, Lord Lansdowne, Lord Fitzwilliam, the Marquis of Hertford, the\r\nMarquis of Bath, the Duke of Bedford, the Duke of Devonshire, and many\r\nothers. They have estates in Ireland; many of them, I dare say, are just\r\nas well managed as any other estates in the country; but what you want\r\nis to restore to Ireland a middle-class proprietary of the soil; and I\r\nventure to say that if these estates could be purchased and could be\r\nsold out farm by farm to the tenant occupiers in Ireland, that it would\r\nbe infinitely better in a conservative sense, than that they should\r\nbelong to great proprietors living out of the country.\r\n\r\nI have said that the disease is desperate, and that the remedy must be\r\nsearching. I assert that the present system of government with regard to\r\nthe Church and with regard to the land has failed disastrously in\r\nIreland. Under it Ireland has become an object of commiseration to the\r\nwhole world, and a discredit to the United Kingdom, of which it forms a\r\npart. It is a land of many sorrows. Men fight for supremacy, and call it\r\nProtestantism; they fight for evil and bad laws, and they call it acting\r\nfor the defence of property. Now, are there no good men in Ireland of\r\nthose who are generally opposed to us in politics--are there none who\r\ncan rise above the level of party? If there be such, I wish my voice\r\nmight reach them. I have often asked myself whether patriotism is dead\r\nin Ireland. Cannot all the people of Ireland see that the calamities of\r\ntheir country are the creatures of the law, and if that be so, that just\r\nlaws only can remove these calamities?\r\n\r\nIf Irishmen were united--if your 105 Members were for the most part\r\nagreed, you might do almost anything that you liked--you might do it\r\neven in the present Parliament; but if you are disunited, then I know\r\nnot how you can gain anything from a Parliament created as the Imperial\r\nParliament is now. The classes who rule in Britain will hear your cry as\r\nthey have heard it before, and will pay no attention to it. They will\r\nsee your people leaving your shores, and they will think it no calamity\r\nto the country. They know that they have force to suppress insurrection,\r\nand, therefore, you can gain nothing from their fears. What, then, is\r\nyour hope? It is in a better Parliament, representing fairly the United\r\nKingdom--the movement which is now in force in England and Scotland, and\r\nwhich is your movement as much as ours. If there were 100 more Members,\r\nthe representatives of large and free constituencies, then your cry\r\nwould be heard, and the people would give you that justice which a class\r\nhas so long denied you. The great party that is now in power--the Tory\r\nparty--denies that you have any just cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered the other day in Belfast, much was said of the\r\nenforcement of the law; but there was nothing said about any change or\r\namendment in the law. With this party terror is their only specific,--\r\nthey have no confidence in allegiance except where there is no power to\r\nrebel. Now, I differ from these men entirely. I believe that at the root\r\nof a general discontent there is in all countries a general grievance\r\nand general suffering. The surface of society is not incessantly\r\ndisturbed without a cause. I recollect in the poem of the greatest of\r\nItalian poets, he tells us that as he saw in vision the Stygian lake,\r\nand stood upon its banks, he observed the constant commotion upon the\r\nsurface of the pool, and his good instructor and guide explained to him\r\nthe cause of it--\r\n\r\n  'This, too, for certain know, that underneath\r\n  The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs\r\n  Into these bubbles make the surface heave,\r\n  As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn.'\r\n\r\nAnd I say in Ireland for generations back, that the misery and the\r\nwrongs of the people have made their sign, and have found a voice in\r\nconstant insurrection and disorder. I have said that Ireland is a\r\ncountry of many wrongs and of many sorrows. Her past lies almost all in\r\nshadow. Her present is full of anxiety and peril. Her future depends on\r\nthe power of her people to substitute equality and justice for\r\nsupremacy, and a generous patriotism for the spirit of faction. In the\r\neffort now making in Great Britain to create a free representation of\r\nthe people you have the deepest interest. The people never wish to\r\nsuffer, and they never wish to inflict injustice. They have no sympathy\r\nwith the wrong-doer, whether in Great Britain or in Ireland; and when\r\nthey are fairly represented in the Imperial Parliament, as I hope they\r\nwill one day be, they will speedily give an effective and final answer\r\nto that old question of the Parliament of Kilkenny--'How comes it to\r\npass that the King has never been the richer for Ireland?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, NOVEMBER 2, 1866.\r\n\r\n[This speech was spoken at a public meeting held in Dublin, at which an\r\nAddress from the Trades was presented to Mr. Bright. James Haughton,\r\nEsq., was in the Chair.]\r\n\r\nWhen I came to your city I was asked if I would attend a public meeting\r\non the question of Parliamentary Reform. I answered that I was not in\r\ngood order for much speaking, for I have suffered, as I am afraid you\r\nwill find before I come to the end of my speech, from much cold and\r\nhoarseness; but it was urged upon me that there were at least some, and\r\nnot an inconsiderable number, of the working men of this city who would\r\nbe glad if I would meet them; and it was proposed to offer me some\r\naddress of friendship and confidence such as that which has been read. I\r\nhave no complaint to make of it but this, that whilst I do not say it\r\nindicates too much kindness, yet that it colours too highly the small\r\nservices which I have been able to render to any portion of my\r\ncountrymen. Your countrymen are reckoned generally to be a people of\r\ngreat gratitude and of much enthusiasm, and, therefore, I accept the\r\nAddress with all the kindness and feelings of friendship with which it\r\nhas been offered, and I hope it will be, at least in some degree, a\r\nstimulant to me, in whatever position of life I am placed, to remember,\r\nas I have ever in past times remembered, the claims of the people of\r\nthis island to complete and equal justice with the people of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nNow, there may be persons in this room, I should be surprised if there\r\nwere not, who doubt whether it is worth their while even to hope for\r\nsubstantial justice, as this address says, from a Parliament sitting in\r\nLondon. If there be such a man in this room let him understand that I am\r\nnot the man to condemn him or to express surprise at the opinion at\r\nwhich he has arrived. But I would ask him in return for that, that he\r\nwould give me at least for a few minutes a patient hearing, and he will\r\nfind that, whether justice may come from the north or the south, or the\r\neast or the west, I, at any rate, stand as a friend of the most complete\r\njustice to the people of this island. When discussing the question of\r\nParliamentary Reform, I have often heard it asserted that the people of\r\nIreland, and I am not speaking of those who are hopeless of good from a\r\nParliament in London, but that the people of Ireland generally imagine\r\nthat the question of Parliamentary Reform has very little importance for\r\nthem. Now I undertake to say, and I think I can make it clear to this\r\nmeeting, that whatever be the importance of that question to any man in\r\nEngland or Scotland, if the two islands are to continue under Imperial\r\nParliamentary Government, it is of more importance to every Irishman.\r\nYou know that the Parliament of which I am a Member contains 658\r\nMembers, of whom 105 cross the Channel from Ireland, and when they go to\r\nLondon they meet--supposing all the Members of the House of Commons are\r\ngathered together--553 Members who are returned for Great Britain. Now,\r\nsuppose that all your 105 Members were absolutely good and honourable\r\nrepresentatives of the people of Ireland--I will not say Tories, or\r\nWhigs, or Radicals, or Repealers, but anything you like,--let every man\r\nimagine that all these Members were exactly the sort of men he would\r\nwish to go from Ireland,--when the 105 arrive in London they meet with\r\nthe 553 who are returned from Great Britain. Now, suppose that the\r\nsystem of Parliamentary representation in Great Britain is very bad,\r\nthat it represents very few persons in that great island, and that those\r\nwho appear to be represented are distributed in the small boroughs over\r\ndifferent parts of the country, and in the counties under the thumb and\r\nfinger of the landlords, it is clear that the whole Parliament, although\r\nyour 105 Members may be very good men, must still be a very bad\r\nParliament. Therefore, if any man imagines--and I should think no man\r\ncan imagine--that the representation of the people in Ireland is in a\r\nvery good state--still, if he fancies it is in a good state--unless the\r\nrepresentation of Great Britain were at least equally good, you might\r\nhave a hundred excellent Irish Members in Parliament at Westminster; but\r\nthe whole 658 Members might be a very bad Parliament for the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Member for a borough or a county in Ireland, when he goes to London,\r\nvotes for measures for the whole kingdom; and a Member for Lancashire or\r\nfor Warwickshire, or for any other county or borough in Great Britain,\r\nvotes for measures not only for Great Britain but also for Ireland, and\r\ntherefore, all parts of the United Kingdom--every county, every borough,\r\nevery parish, every family, every man--has a clear and distinct and\r\nundoubted interest in a Parliament that shall fairly and justly\r\nrepresent the whole nation. Now, look for a moment at two or three facts\r\nwith regard to Ireland alone. I have stated some facts with regard to\r\nEngland and Scotland at recent meetings held across the Channel.\r\n\r\nNow for two or three facts with regard to Ireland. In Ireland you have\r\nfive boroughs returning each one Member, the average number of electors\r\nin each of these boroughs being only 172. You have 13 boroughs, the\r\naverage number being 316. You have 9 other boroughs with an average\r\nnumber of electors of 497. You have, therefore, 27 boroughs whose whole\r\nnumber of electors, if they were all put together, is only 9,453, or an\r\naverage of 350 electors for each Member. I must tell you further that\r\nyou have a single county with nearly twice as many voters as the whole\r\nof those 27 boroughs. Your 27 boroughs have only 9,453 electors, and the\r\ncounty of Cork has 16,107 electors, and returns but two Members. But\r\nthat is not the worst of the case. It happens both in Great Britain and\r\nIreland, wherever the borough constituencies are so small, that it is\r\nalmost impossible that they should be independent; a very acute lawyer,\r\nfor example, in one of those boroughs--a very influential clergyman,\r\nwhether of your Church or ours--when I say ours, I do not mean mine, but\r\nthe Church of England--half-a-dozen men combining together, or a little\r\ncorruption from candidates going with a well-filled purse,--these are\r\nthe influences brought to bear upon those small boroughs both in England\r\nand Ireland. A great many of them return their Members by means of\r\ncorruption, more or less, and a free and real representation of the\r\npeople is hardly ever possible in a borough of that small size.\r\n\r\nBut if I were to compare your boroughs with your counties, see how it\r\nstands. You have thirty-nine borough Members, with 30,000 electors, and\r\nyou have sixty-four county Members, with 172,000 electors. Therefore you\r\nsee that the Members are so distributed that the great populations have\r\nnot one quarter of the influence in Parliament which those small\r\npopulations in the small boroughs have. We come next to another question\r\nwhich is of great consequence. Not only are those small boroughs\r\naltogether too email for independence, but if we come to your large\r\ncounty constituencies, we find that from the peculiar circumstances and\r\nthe relations which exist between the voter and the owner of the land,\r\nthere is scarcely any freedom of election. Even in your counties I\r\nshould suppose that if there was no compulsion from the landowners or\r\ntheir agents, that in at least three-fourths of this island the vote of\r\nthe county electors would be by a vast majority in favour of the Liberal\r\ncandidates. I am not speaking merely of men who profess a sort of\r\nliberality which just enables them to go with their party, but I speak\r\nof men who would be thoroughly in earnest in sustaining, as far as they\r\nwere able, in Parliament, the opinions which they were sent to represent\r\nby the large constituencies who elected them.\r\n\r\nThe question of the ballot is, in my opinion, of the greatest importance\r\nin Great Britain and Ireland, but is of more importance in the counties\r\nthan it is in the large boroughs. For example: in Great Britain, in such\r\nboroughs as Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Manchester and Birmingham, and\r\nthe metropolitan boroughs, where the number of electors runs from 10,000\r\nto 25,000, bribery is of no avail, because you could not bribe thousands\r\nof men. To bribe 100 or 200 would not alter the return at an election\r\nwith so large a constituency. But what you want with the ballot is, that\r\nin the counties where the tenant-farmers vote, and where they live upon\r\ntheir land without the security of a lease, or without the security of\r\nany law to give them compensation for any improvements they may have\r\nmade upon the land, the tenant-farmer feels himself always liable to\r\ninjury, and sometimes to ruin, if he gets into a dispute with the agent\r\nor the landowner with regard to the manner in which he has exercised his\r\nfranchise. And what will be very important also, if you have the ballot,\r\nyour elections will be tranquil, without disorder and without riot. Last\r\nweek, or the week before, there was an election in one of your great\r\ncounties. Well, making every allowance that can be made for the\r\nexaggerations circulated by the writers of the two parties, it is quite\r\nclear to everybody that the circumstances of that election, though not\r\nabsolutely uncommon in Ireland, were still such as to be utterly\r\ndiscreditable to a real representative system. And you must bear in mind\r\nthat there is no other people in the world that considers that it has a\r\nfair representative system unless it has the ballot. The ballot is\r\nuniversal almost in the United States. It is almost universal in the\r\ncolonies, at any rate in the Australian colonies; it is almost universal\r\non the continent of Europe, and in the new Parliament of North Germany,\r\nwhich is about soon to be assembled, every man of twenty-five years of\r\nage is to be allowed to vote, and to vote by ballot.\r\n\r\nNow, I hold, without any fear of contradiction, that the intelligence\r\nand the virtues of the people of Ireland are not represented in the\r\nParliament. You have your wrongs to complain of--wrongs centuries old,\r\nand wrongs that long ago the people of Ireland, and, I venture to say,\r\nthe people of Great Britain united with Ireland----My friend up there\r\nwill not listen to the end of my sentence. I say that the people of\r\nGreat Britain, acting with the people of Ireland, in a fair\r\nrepresentation of the whole, would long ago have remedied every just\r\ngrievance of which you could complain.\r\n\r\nI will take two questions which I treated upon the other evening. I will\r\nask about one question--that is, the question of the supremacy of the\r\nChurch in Ireland. Half the people in England are Nonconformists. They\r\nare not in favour of an Established Church anywhere, and it is utterly\r\nimpossible that they could be in favour of an Established Church in an\r\nisland like this--an Established Church formed of a mere handful of the\r\npopulation, in opposition to the wishes of the nation. Now take the\r\nPrincipality of Wales. I suppose that four out of five of the population\r\nthere are Dissenters, and they are not in favour of maintaining a\r\nreligious Protestant Establishment in Ireland. The people of Scotland\r\nhave also seceded in such large numbers from their Established Church,\r\nalthough of a democratic character, that I suppose those who have\r\nseceded are a considerable majority of the whole people--they are not in\r\nfavour of maintaining an ecclesiastical Establishment in Ireland in\r\nopposition to the views of the great majority of your people. Take the\r\nother question--that of land. There is nobody in Great Britain of the\r\ngreat town population, or of the middle class, or of the still more\r\nnumerous working class, who has any sympathy with that condition of the\r\nlaw and of the administration of the law which has worked such mischiefs\r\nin your country. But these Nonconformists, whether in England, Wales, or\r\nScotland, these great middle classes, and still greater working classes,\r\nare in the position that you are. Only sixteen of every hundred have a\r\nvote, and those sixteen are so arranged that when their representatives\r\nget to Parliament they turn out for the most part to be no real\r\nrepresentatives of the people.\r\n\r\nI will tell you fairly that you, as the less populous and less powerful\r\npart of this great nation--you of all the men in the United Kingdom,\r\nhave by far the strongest interest in a thorough reform of the Imperial\r\nParliament, and I believe that you yourselves could not do yourselves\r\nsuch complete justice by yourselves as you can do, by fairly acting with\r\nthe generous millions of my countrymen in whose name I stand here. You\r\nhave on this platform two members of the Reform League from London. I\r\nreceived yesterday, or the day before, a telegram from the Scottish\r\nReform League, from Glasgow. I am not sure whether there is a copy of it\r\nin any of the newspapers, but it was sent to me, and I presume it was\r\nsent to me that I might read it, if I had the opportunity of meeting any\r\nof the unenfranchised men of this city. It says:--'The Scottish Reform\r\nLeague request you to convey to the Reformers in Ireland their deep\r\nsympathy. They sincerely hope that soon in Ireland, as in Scotland and\r\nEngland, Reform Leagues may be formed in every town to secure to the\r\npeople their political rights. Urge upon our friends in Ireland their\r\nduty to promote this great movement, and to secure at home those\r\nbenefits which thousands of their fellow-countrymen are forced to seek\r\nin other lands--where land and State Church grievances are unknown. We\r\nalso seek cooperation, knowing that our freedom, though secure tomorrow,\r\nwould not be safe so long as one portion of the United Kingdom were less\r\nfree than the other portions.' There is the outspoken voice of the\r\nrepresentatives of that great multitude that only a fortnight since I\r\nsaw passing through the streets of Glasgow. For three hours the\r\nprocession passed, with all the emblems and symbols of their various\r\ntrades, and the streets for two or three miles were enlivened by\r\nbanners, and the air was filled with the sounds of music from their\r\nbands. Those men but spoke the same language that was heard in the West\r\nRiding, in Manchester, in Birmingham, and in London; and you men of\r\nDublin, and of Ireland, you never made a mistake more grievous in your\r\nlives than when you come to the conclusion that there are not millions\r\nof men in Great Britain willing to do you full justice.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry that my voice is not what it was, and when I think of\r\nthe work that is to be done sometimes I feel it is a pity we grow old so\r\nfast. But years ago, when I have thought of the condition of Ireland, of\r\nits sorrows and wrongs, of the discredit that its condition has brought\r\nupon the English, the Irish, and the British name, I have thought, if I\r\ncould be in all other things the same, but by birth an Irishman, there\r\nis not a town in this island I would not visit for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing the great Irish question, and of rousing my countrymen to\r\nsome great and united action.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in the necessity of wide-spread and perpetual misery. I\r\ndo not believe that we are placed on this island, and on this earth,\r\nthat one man may be great and wealthy, and revel in every profuse\r\nindulgence, and five, six, nine, or ten men shall suffer the abject\r\nmisery which we see so commonly in the world. With your soil, your\r\nclimate, and your active and spirited race, I know not what you might\r\nnot do. There have been reasons to my mind why soil and climate, and the\r\nlabour of your population, have not produced general comfort and\r\ncompetence for all.\r\n\r\nThe Address speaks of the friendly feeling and the sympathy which I have\r\nhad for Ireland during my political career. When I first went into the\r\nHouse of Commons the most prominent figure in it was Daniel O'Connell. I\r\nhave sat by his side for hours in that House, and listened to\r\nobservations both amusing and instructive on what was passing under\r\ndiscussion. I have seen him, too, more than once upon the platforms of\r\nthe Anti-Corn-law League. I recollect that on one occasion he sent to\r\nIreland expressly for a newspaper for me, which contained a report of a\r\nspeech which he made against the Corn-law when the Corn-law was passing\r\nthrough Parliament in 1815, and we owe much to his exertions in\r\nconnection with that question, for almost the whole Liberal--I suppose\r\nthe whole Liberal--party of the Irish representatives in Parliament\r\nsupported the measure of free trade of which we were the prominent\r\nadvocates; and I know of nothing that was favourable to freedom, whether\r\nin connection with Ireland or England, that O'Connell did not support\r\nwith all his great powers. Why is it, now, that there should be any kind\r\nof schism between the Liberal people of Ireland and the Liberal people\r\nof Great Britain? I do not ask you to join hands with supremacy and\r\noppression, whether in your island or ours. What I ask you is, to open\r\nyour heart of hearts, and join hands for a real and thorough working\r\nunion for freedom with the people of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBefore I sit down, I must be allowed to advert to a point which has been\r\nmuch commented upon--a sentence in my speech made the other night with\r\nregard to the land. There are newspapers in Dublin which I need not\r\nname, because I am quite sure you can find them out--which do not feel\r\nany strong desire to judge fairly anything I may propose for the\r\npacification and redemption of the people of Ireland. It was this I\r\nsaid: 'It is of the first importance that the people of Ireland, by some\r\nprocess or other, should have the opportunity of being made the\r\npossessors of their own soil.' You will know perfectly well that I am\r\nnot about to propose a copy of the villainous crimes of two hundred\r\nyears ago, to confiscate the lands of the proprietors, here or\r\nelsewhere. I propose to introduce a system which would gradually, no\r\ndoubt rapidly and easily, without injuring anybody, make many thousands\r\nwho are now tenant-farmers, without lease and security, the owners of\r\ntheir farms in this island. This is my plan, and I want to restate it\r\nwith a little further explanation, in order that these gentlemen to whom\r\nI have referred may not repeat the very untrue, and I may say\r\ndishonourable comments which they have made upon me.\r\n\r\nThere are many large estates in Ireland which belong to rich families in\r\nEngland,--families not only of the highest rank, but of the highest\r\ncharacter,--because I will venture to say there are not to be found\r\namongst the English nobility families of more perfect honourableness and\r\nworth than some of those to whom my plan would be offered; and,\r\ntherefore, I am not speaking against the aristocracy, against those\r\nfamilies, or against property, or against anybody, or against anything\r\nthat is good. I say, that if Parliament were to appoint a Commission,\r\nand give it, say, at first up to the amount of five millions sterling,\r\nthe power to negotiate or treat with those great families in England who\r\nhave estates in Ireland, it is probable that some of those great estates\r\nmight be bought at a not very unreasonable price. I am of opinion that\r\nthis would be the cheapest money that the Imperial Parliament ever\r\nexpended, even though it became possessed of those estates at a price\r\nconsiderably above the market price. But I propose it should be worked\r\nin this way. I will take a case. I will assume that this Commission is\r\nin possession of a considerable estate bought from some present owner of\r\nit. I will take one farm, which I will assume to be worth\r\n1,000_l_., for which the present tenant is paying a rent of\r\n50_l_. a-year. He has no lease. He has no security. He makes almost\r\nno improvement of any kind; and he is not quite sure whether, when he\r\nhas saved a little more money, he will not take his family off to the\r\nUnited States. Now we will assume ourselves, if you like, to be that\r\nCommission, and that we have before us the farmer who is the tenant on\r\nthat particular farm, for which he pays 50_l_. a year, without\r\nlease or security, and which I assume to be worth 1,000_l_. The\r\nGovernment, I believe, lends money to Irish landowners for drainage\r\npurposes at about 3-1/2 per cent. per annum. Suppose the Government were\r\nto say to this farmer, 'You would not have any objection to become\r\npossessed of this farm?' 'No, not the slightest,' he might answer, 'but\r\nhow is that to be done?' In this way;--You may pay 50_l_. a-year,\r\nthat is, 5 per cent. on one thousand pounds; the Government can afford\r\nto do these transactions for 3-1/2 per cent.; if you will pay\r\n60_l_. a-year for a given number of years, which any of the\r\nactuaries of the insurance offices or any good arithmetician may soon\r\ncalculate,--if you will pay 60_l_. for your rent, instead of\r\n50_l_., it may be for perhaps twenty years,--at the end of that\r\ntime the farm will be yours, without any further payment.\r\n\r\nI want you to understand how this is. If the farmer paid ten pounds a-\r\nyear more than he now pays, towards buying his farm, and if the\r\n1,000_l_. the Government would pay for the farm would not cost the\r\nGovernment more than 35_l_., the difference between 35_l_. and\r\n60_l_. being 25_l_., would be the sum which that farmer, in\r\nhis rent, would be paying to the Commission, that is, to the Government,\r\nfor the redemption of his farm. Thus, at the end of a very few years,\r\nthe farmer would possess his own farm, having a perfect security in the\r\nmeantime. Nobody could turn him out if he paid his rent, and nobody\r\ncould rob him for any improvement he made on his land. The next morning\r\nafter he made that agreement, he would explain it to his wife and to his\r\nbig boy, who had perhaps been idling about for a long time, and there\r\nwould not be a stone on the land that would not be removed, not a weed\r\nthat he would not pull up, not a particle of manure that he would not\r\nsave; everything would be done with a zeal and an enthusiasm which he\r\nhad never known before; and by the time the few years had run on when\r\nthe farm should become his without any further purchase, he would have\r\nturned a dilapidated, miserable little farm into a garden for himself\r\nand family. Now, this statement may be commented on by some of the\r\nnewspapers. You will understand that I do not propose a forced purchase,\r\nor any confiscation. I would undertake even to give--if I were the\r\nGovernment--to every one of these landlords twenty per cent more for his\r\nestate than it will fetch in the market in London or in Dublin, and I\r\nsay that to do this would produce a marvellous change in the sentiments\r\nof the people, and in the condition of agriculture in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut I saw in one of the papers a question to which I may give a reply.\r\nIt was said, How would you like to have a Commission come down into\r\nLancashire and insist on buying your factories? I can only say that if\r\nthey will give me 20 per cent, or 10 per cent, more than they are worth,\r\nthey shall have them to-morrow. But I do not propose that the Commission\r\nshould come here and insist on buying these estates. They say, further,\r\nWhy should a man in Ireland keep his estate, and not a man in England\r\nwho has an estate in Ireland? There is this difference. A man in\r\nIreland, if he has an estate of 10,000 acres, has in it probably his\r\nancestral home. He has ties to this which it would be monstrous to think\r\nof severing in such a manner. But a man living in England, who is not an\r\nIrishman, and who never comes over here except to receive his rents\r\n(which, in fact, he generally receives through his bankers in London),\r\nwho has no particular tie to this country, and who comes over here\r\noccasionally merely because he feels that, as a great proprietor in\r\nIreland, it would be scandalous never to show his face on his property\r\nand amongst his tenants--to such a man there would be no hardship if he\r\nshould part with his land at a fair price.\r\n\r\nI have been charged with saying severe things of the English\r\naristocracy. Now, this is not true in the sense in which it is imputed\r\nto me. I have always said that there are many men in the English\r\naristocracy who would be noblemen in the sight of their fellow-men\r\nalthough they had no titles and no coronets. There are men amongst them\r\nof as undoubted patriotism as any man in this building, or in this\r\nisland, and there are men amongst them, who when they saw that a great\r\npublic object was to be gained for the benefit of their fellow-men,\r\nwould make as great sacrifices as any one of us would be willing to do.\r\nI am of opinion therefore--I may be wrong, but I will not believe it\r\nuntil it is proved--I am of opinion that if this question were discussed\r\nin Parliament when next the Irish land question is discussed, and if\r\nthere was a general sentiment in the House of Commons that some measure\r\nlike this would be advantageous for Ireland,--and if it were so\r\nexpressed, it may be assumed that it would be accepted to a large extent\r\nby the people of the United Kingdom,--then I think that a Commission so\r\nappointed would find no difficulty whatever in discovering noblemen and\r\nrich men in England, who are the possessors of great estates in Ireland,\r\nwho would be willing to negotiate for their transfer, and that\r\nCommission, by the process I have indicated, might transfer them\r\ngradually but speedily to the tenant-farmers of this country.\r\n\r\nI am told that I have not been much in Ireland, and do not know much of\r\nit. I recollect a man in England during the American war asking me a\r\nquestion about America. When I gave him an answer which did not agree\r\nwith his opinion, he said, 'I think you have never been in America, have\r\nyou?' I said I had not; and he replied, 'Well, I have been there three\r\ntimes, and I know something of them.' He was asking me whether I thought\r\nthe Yankees would pay when they borrowed money to carry on the war; and\r\nI thought they would. But, as he had been there, he thought his opinion\r\nwas worth more than mine. I told him I knew several people who had lived\r\nin England all their lives and yet knew very little about England. I am\r\ntold that if I were to live in Ireland, amongst the people I should have\r\na different opinion; that I should think the State Church of a small\r\nminority was honest, in the face of the great Church of the majority;\r\nthat I should think it was not the fault of the landowners or of the law\r\nin any degree, but the fault of the tenants, that everything went wrong\r\nwith regard to the land; and that I should find that it was the\r\nGovernment that was mostly right, and the legislation right, and that it\r\nwas the people that were mostly wrong. There are certain questions with\r\nregard to any country that you may settle in your own house, never\r\nhaving seen that country even upon a map. This you may settle, that what\r\nis just is just everywhere, and that men, from those of the highest\r\nculture even to those of the most moderate capacity, whatever may be\r\ntheir race, whatever their colour, have implanted in their hearts by\r\ntheir Creator, wiser much than my critics, the knowledge and the love of\r\njustice. I will tell you that, since the day when I sat beside\r\nO'Connell--and at an earlier day--I have considered this question of\r\nIreland. In 1849, for several weeks in the autumn, and for several weeks\r\nin the autumn of 1852, I came to Ireland expressly to examine this\r\nquestion by consulting with all classes of the people in every part of\r\nthe island. I will undertake to say that I believe there is no man in\r\nEngland who has more fully studied the evidence given before the\r\ncelebrated Devon Commission in regard to Ireland than I have. Therefore\r\nI dare stand up before any Irishman or Englishman to discuss the Irish\r\nquestion. I say that the plans, the theories, the policy, the\r\nlegislation of my opponents in this matter all have failed signally,\r\ndeplorably, disastrously, ignominiously, and, therefore, I say that I\r\nhave a right to come in and offer the people of Ireland, as I would\r\noffer to the people of Great Britain and the Imperial Parliament, a wise\r\nand just policy upon this question.\r\n\r\nYou know that I have attended great meetings in England within the last\r\ntwo months, and in Scotland also. I think I am at liberty to tender to\r\nyou from those hundreds of thousands of men the hand of fellowship and\r\ngoodwill. I wish I might be permitted when I go back, as in fact I think\r\nby this Address that I am permitted to say to them, that amidst the\r\nfactions by which Ireland has been torn, amidst the many errors that\r\nhave been committed, amidst the passions that have been excited, amidst\r\nthe hopes that have been blasted, and amidst the misery that has been\r\nendured, there is still in this island, and amongst its people, a heart\r\nthat can sympathise with those who turn to them with a fixed resolution\r\nto judge them fairly, and to do them justice.\r\n\r\nI have made my speech. I have said my say. I have fulfilled my small\r\nmission to you. I thank you from my heart for the kindness with which\r\nyou have received me, which I shall never forget. And if I have in past\r\ntimes felt an unquenchable sympathy with the sufferings of your people,\r\nyou may rely upon it that if there be an Irish Member to speak for\r\nIreland, he will find me heartily by his side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, MARCH 14, 1868.\r\n\r\n_From Hansard_.\r\n\r\n[This speech was spoken on the occasion of a proposition by Mr.\r\nMaguire, M.P. for Cork, for 'a Committee of the whole House to consider\r\nthe state of Ireland.']\r\n\r\nWhen this debate began it was not my intention to take any part in it;\r\nfor I had very lately, in another place and to a larger audience, added\r\nmy contribution to the great national deliberation upon Irish affairs\r\nwhich is now in progress. But the speech of the noble Lord the Chief\r\nSecretary for Ireland, and some misunderstanding that has arisen of what\r\nI said elsewhere, have changed my intention, and therefore I have to ask\r\nfor the indulgence of the House, in the hope that I may make on this\r\nquestion a more practical speech than that to which we have just\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\nIt is said by eminent censors of the press that this debate will yield\r\nabout thirty hours of talk, and will end in no result. I have observed\r\nthat all great questions in this country require thirty hours of talk\r\nmany times repeated before they are settled. There is much shower and\r\nmuch sunshine between the sowing of the seed and the reaping of the\r\nharvest, but the harvest is generally reaped after all.\r\n\r\nI was very much struck with what happened on the first night of the\r\ndebate. My hon. Friend the Member for Cork, in the opening portion of\r\nhis address, described the state of Ireland from his point of view, and\r\nthe facts he stated are not and cannot be disputed. He said that the\r\nHabeas Corpus Act had been suspended for three years in his country--\r\nthat within the island there was a large military force, amounting, as\r\nwe have heard to-night--besides 12,000 or more of armed police--to an\r\narmy of 20,000 men--that in the harbours of Ireland there were ships of\r\nwar, and in her rivers there were gunboats; and that throughout that\r\ncountry--as throughout this--there has been and is yet considerable\r\nalarm with regard to the discontent prevalent in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAll that is quite true; but when the noble Lord the Chief Secretary\r\nopened his speech, the first portion of it was of a very different\r\ncomplexion. I am willing to admit that to a large extent it was equally\r\ntrue. He told us that the condition of the people of Ireland was\r\nconsiderably better now than it was at the time of the Devon Commission.\r\nAt the time of the Devon Commission the condition of that country had no\r\nparallel in any civilised and Christian nation. By the force of famine,\r\npestilence, and emigration, the population was greatly diminished, and\r\nit would be a very extraordinary thing indeed if with such a diminution\r\nof the population there was no improvement in the condition of those who\r\nremained behind. He showed that wages are higher, and he pointed to the\r\nfact that in the trade in and out of the Irish ports they had a\r\nconsiderable increase, and though I will not say that some of those\r\ncomparisons were quite accurate or fair, I am on the whole ready to\r\nadmit the truth of the statement the noble Lord made. But now it seems\r\nto me that, admitting the truth of what my hon. Friend the Member for\r\nCork said, and admitting equally the truth of what the noble Lord said,\r\nthere remains before us a question even more grave than any we have had\r\nto discuss in past years with regard to the condition of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIf--and this has been already referred to by more than one speaker--if\r\nit be true that with a considerable improvement in the physical\r\ncondition of the people--if it be true that with a universality of\r\neducation much beyond that which exists in this island--if it be true\r\nthat after the measures that have been passed, and have been useful,\r\nthere still remains in Ireland, first of all, what is called Fenianism,\r\nwhich is a reckless and daring exhibition of feeling--beyond that a very\r\nwide discontent and disloyalty--and beyond that, amongst the whole of\r\nthe Roman Catholic population, universal dissatisfaction--and if that be\r\nso, surely my hon. Friend the Member for Cork--one of the most useful\r\nand eminent of the representatives of Ireland--is right in bringing this\r\nquestion before the House. And there is no question at this moment that\r\nwe could possibly discuss connected with the interest or honour of the\r\npeople that approaches in gravity and magnitude to that now before us.\r\nAnd if this state of things be true--and remember I have said nothing\r\nbut what the hon. Member for Cork has said, and I have given my approval\r\nto nothing he has said that was not confirmed by the speech of the noble\r\nLord--if this be true, surely all this great effect must have some\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nWe are unworthy of our position as Members of this House, and\r\nrepresentatives of our countrymen, if we do not endeavour at least to\r\ndiscover the cause, and if we can discover it, speedily to apply a\r\nremedy. The cause is perfectly well known to both sides of the House.\r\nThe noble Lord, it is clear, knows it even from the tenor of his own\r\nspeech--he spoke of the question of the land, and of the Church. The\r\nnoble Lord the Member for King's Lynn--whose observations in this\r\ndebate, if he had offered them, we should have been glad to listen to--\r\nunderstands it, for he referred to the two questions in his speech at\r\nthe Bristol banquet. The right hon. Gentleman at the head of the\r\nGovernment understands it not only as well as I do, but he understands\r\nit precisely in the same sense--and more than twenty years ago, when I\r\nstated in this House the things, or nearly the things, I stated recently\r\nand shall state to-night, he, from your own benches, was making speeches\r\nexactly of the same import. And though there is many a thing he seems at\r\ntimes not to recollect, yet I am bound to say he recollects these words,\r\nand the impressions, of which these words were the expressions to the\r\nHouse. He referred to an absentee aristocracy and an alien Church. I\r\nwould not say a syllable about the aristocracy in this matter; if I had\r\nto choose a phrase, I would rather say an absentee proprietary and an\r\nalien Church.\r\n\r\nWhat is the obvious remedy which for this state of things has been found\r\nto be sufficient in every other country? If I could do so by any means\r\nthat did not violate the rights of property, I should be happy to give\r\nto a considerable portion of the farmers of Ireland some proprietary\r\nrights, and to remove from that country the sense of injustice, and the\r\nsense--the strongest of all--of the injustice caused by the existence of\r\nan alien Church. Just for a moment look at the proposition the noble\r\nLord is about to submit to the House. It is very like the Bill of last\r\nyear. I will not enter into the details, except to say that he proposes,\r\nas he proposed then, that the Government should lend the tenant-farmers\r\nof Ireland sums of money, by which they would make improvements, which\r\nsums of money were to be repaid by some gradual process to the\r\nGovernment authorities. He proposes that the repayment should be spread\r\nover a considerable number of years--I do not know the exact number, and\r\nit is not of importance for my argument. These tenant-farmers are very\r\nnumerous--perhaps too numerous, it may be, for the good of the country--\r\nbut there they are, and we must deal with them as we find them. The\r\nnumber of them holding under 15 acres is 250,000; holding between 15\r\nacres and 30 acres, 136,000; holding over 30 acres, 158,000--altogether\r\nthere are more than 540,000 holders of land. It is to these 540,000\r\nland-holders or occupiers that the noble Lord proposes to lend money, on\r\nthe condition that they make certain improvements, and repay after a\r\ncertain number of years the sums advanced to them. I think I am right in\r\nsaying that there is no limitation in the Bill as to the smallness of\r\nthe holding to which the advance of money will be refused; and therefore\r\nthe whole 540,000 tenants will be in a position to come to the\r\nGovernment, or to some Commission, or to the Board of Works, or to some\r\nauthority in Ireland, and ask for money to enable them to improve their\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nThe House will see that if this plan is to produce any considerable\r\nresult, it will be the source of a number of transactions such as the\r\nGovernment have not had to deal with in any other matter; and I expect\r\nthat the difficulties will be very great, and that the working out of\r\nthe plan with any beneficial results will be altogether impossible. What\r\nI ask the House is this--if it be right of the noble Lord, to enable him\r\nto carry out his plan, to ask the House to pass a measure like this--to\r\nlend all these tenants the money for improvements to be repaid after a\r\nseries of years, would it not be possible for us by a somewhat similar\r\nprocess, and by some step farther in the same direction, to establish to\r\nsome extent--I am not speaking of extending it all through Ireland--a\r\nfarmer proprietary throughout the country? If it be right and proper to\r\nlend money to improve, it surely may be proper, if it be on other\r\ngrounds judicious, to lend money to buy. I do not know if the right hon.\r\nMember for Calne is here; but very likely he would spare me from the\r\nsevere criticisms he expended upon my hon. Friend the Member for\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nNow, I am as careful as any man can be, I believe, of doing anything by\r\nlaw that shall infringe what you think and what I think are the rights\r\nof property. I do not pretend to believe, if you examine the terms\r\nstrictly, in what is called the absolute property in land. You may toss\r\na sixpence into the sea if you like, but there are things with respect\r\nto land which you cannot, and ought not, and dare not do. But I do not\r\nwant to argue the question of legislation upon that ground I am myself\r\nof opinion that there is no class in the community more interested in a\r\nstrict adherence to the principles of political economy, worked out in a\r\nbenevolent and just manner, than the humblest and poorest class in the\r\ncountry. I think they have as much interest in it as the rich, and the\r\nHouse has never known me, and so long as I stand here will never know\r\nme, I believe, to propose or advocate anything which shall interfere\r\nwith what I believe to be, and what if a landowner I would maintain to\r\nbe, the just right of property in the land.\r\n\r\nBut, then, I do not think, as some persons seem to think, that the land\r\nis really only intended to be in the hands of the rich. I think that is\r\na great mistake. I am not speaking of the poor--for the poor man, in the\r\nordinary meaning of the term, cannot be the possessor of land; but what\r\nI wish is, that farmers and men of moderate means should become\r\npossessors of land and of their farms. About two centuries ago, two very\r\ncelebrated men endeavoured to form a constitution for Carolina, which\r\nwas then one of the colonies of this country in America. Lord\r\nShaftesbury, the statesman, and Mr. Locke, the philosopher, framed a\r\nconstitution with the notion of having great proprietors all over the\r\ncountry, and men under them to cultivate it. I recollect that Mr.\r\nBancroft, the historian of the United States, describing the issue of\r\nthat attempt and its utter failure, says: 'The instinct of aristocracy\r\ndreads the moral power of a proprietary yeomanry, and therefore the\r\nperpetual degradation of the cultivators of the soil was enacted.' There\r\nis no country in the world, in which there are only great landowners and\r\ntenants, with no large manufacturing interest to absorb the population,\r\nin which the degradation of the cultivating tenant is not completely\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nI hope that hon. Members opposite, and hon. Gentlemen on this side who\r\nmay be disposed in some degree to sympathise with them, will not for a\r\nmoment imagine that I am discussing this question in any spirit of\r\nhostility to the landowners of Ireland. I have always argued that the\r\nlandowners of Ireland, in their treatment of this question, have\r\ngrievously mistaken not only the interests of the population, but their\r\nown. I was told the other day by a Member of this House, who comes from\r\nIreland, and is eminently capable of giving a sound opinion upon the\r\npoint, that he believed the whole of Ireland might be bought at about\r\ntwenty years' purchase; but you know that the land of England is worth\r\nthirty years' purchase, and I believe a great deal of it much more,--and\r\nit is owing to circumstances which legislation may in a great degree\r\nremove that the land of Ireland is worth at this moment so much less\r\nthan the land of England. Coming back to the question of buying farms, I\r\nput it to the House whether, if it be right to lend to landlords for\r\nimprovements, and to tenants for improving the farms of their landlords,\r\nto those who propose to carry on public works, and to repair the ravages\r\nof the cattle plague, I ask whether it is not also right for them to\r\nlend money in cases where it may be advantageous to landlords, and where\r\nthey may be very willing to consent to it, to establish a portion of the\r\ntenant-farmers of Ireland as proprietors of their farms.\r\n\r\nNow, bear in mind that I have never spoken about peasant proprietors. I\r\ndo not care what name you give them; I am in favour of more proprietors,\r\nand some, of course, will be small and some will be large; but it would\r\nbe quite possible for Parliament, if it thought fit to attempt anything\r\nof this kind, to fix a limit below which it would not allow the owner to\r\nsell or the purchaser to buy. I believe that you can establish a class\r\nof moderate proprietors, who will form a body intermediate between the\r\ngreat owners of land and those who are absolutely landless, which will\r\nbe of immense service in giving steadiness, loyalty, and peace to the\r\nwhole population of the island. The noble Lord, the Chief Secretary,\r\nknows perfectly well at what price he could lend that money, and I will\r\njust state to the House one fact which will show how the plan would\r\nwork. If you were to lend money at 3-1/2 per cent., in thirty-five years\r\nthe tenant, paying 5 per cent., would have paid the whole money back and\r\nall the interest due on it, and would become the owner of his farm; and\r\nif you were to take the rate at which you have lent to the Harbour\r\nCommissioners, and to repair the ravages of the cattle plague, which is\r\n3-1/2 per cent., of course the whole sum would be paid back in a shorter\r\nperiod. Therefore, in a term which in former times was not unusual in\r\nthe length of leases in Ireland, namely, thirty-one years, the tenant\r\npurchasing his farm, without his present rent being raised, would repay\r\nto the Government the principal and interest of the sum borrowed for\r\nthat purpose, would become the owner of his farm, and during the whole\r\nof that time would have absolute fixity of tenure, because every year he\r\nwould be saving more and more, adding field to field, and at the end of\r\nthe time he would be the proprietor of the soil.\r\n\r\nLet not the House imagine that I am proposing to buy up the whole of the\r\nland. I am proposing only to buy it in cases where men are willing to\r\nsell, and to transfer it only in cases where men are able and willing to\r\nbuy, and you must know as well as I that there will be many thousands of\r\nsuch cases in a few years. Every Irish proprietor opposite--the noble\r\nLord the Member for Tyrone (Lord C. Hamilton) himself, who made so\r\nanimated a speech, and appeared so angry with me a short time ago--must\r\nknow perfectly well that amongst the tenantry of Ireland there is a\r\nconsiderable sum of saved money not invested in farms. Well, that saved\r\nmoney would all come out to carry into effect transactions of this\r\nnature; and you would find the most extraordinary efforts made by\r\nthousands of tenants to become possessors of their farms by investing\r\ntheir savings in them, by obtaining it may be the assistance of their\r\nfriends, and by such an industrious and energetic cultivation of the\r\nsoil as has scarcely ever been seen in Ireland. I said there were\r\nlandlords willing to sell, and there are cases in which, probably,\r\nParliament might insist upon a sale--for instance, the lands of the\r\nLondon Companies. I never heard of much good that was done by all the\r\nmoney of the London Companies. I was once invited to a dinner by one of\r\nthese Companies, and certainly it was of a very sumptuous and\r\nsubstantial character, but I believe that, if the tenants of these\r\nCompanies were proprietors of the lands they cultivate, it would be a\r\ngreat advantage to the counties in which they are situated. I come then\r\nto this: I would negotiate with landowners who were willing to sell and\r\ntenants who were willing to buy, and I would make the land the great\r\nsavings-bank for the future tenantry of Ireland. If you like, I would\r\nlimit the point to which we might go down in the transference of farms,\r\nbut I would do nothing in the whole transaction which was not perfectly\r\nacquiesced in by both landlord and tenant, and I would pay the landlord\r\nevery shilling he could fairly demand in the market for the estate he\r\nproposed to sell.\r\n\r\nWell, I hope every Gentleman present will acquit me of intending\r\nconfiscation, and that we shall have no further misunderstanding upon\r\nthat point. I venture to say to the noble Lord that this is a plan which\r\nwould be within compass and management, as compared with that laid down\r\nin his Bill, if it worked at all, and I believe that it would do a\r\nhundred times as much good, in putting the farmer upon the footing of a\r\nholder of land in Ireland. What do hon. Gentlemen think would become of\r\nan American Fenian if he came over to Ireland and happened to spend an\r\nevening with a number of men who had got possession of their farms? I\r\nremember my old friend Mr. Stafford, in the county of Wexford, whom I\r\ncalled upon in 1849, who had bought his farm and had built upon it the\r\nbest farm-house which I saw in the whole South of Ireland, and who told\r\nme that if all the tenantry of Ireland had security for their holdings--\r\nhe was an old man, and could not easily rise from his chair, though he\r\nmade an effort to do so--'If they had the security that I have,' said\r\nhe, 'we'd _bate_ the hunger out of Ireland.' If the Fenian spent\r\nhis evening with such men as these, and proposed his reckless schemes to\r\nthem, not a single farmer would listen to him for a moment. Their first\r\nimpression would be that he was mad; their second, perhaps, that the\r\nwhisky had been too strong for him; and it would end, no doubt, if he\r\npersisted in his efforts to seduce them from their allegiance to the\r\nImperial Government, by their turning him off the premises, though\r\nperhaps, knowing that he could do no harm, they might not hand him over\r\nto the police.\r\n\r\nThe other day I passed through the county of Somerset, and through\r\nvillages that must be well known to many Gentlemen here--Rodney-Stoke\r\nand Drayford, I think they were called--and I noticed a great appearance\r\nof life and activity about the neighbourhood. I asked the driver of the\r\ncarriage which had brought me from Wells what was the cause of it.\r\n'Why,' he said, 'don't you know that is the place where the great sale\r\ntook place?' 'What sale?' I asked. 'Oh! the sale of the Duke's\r\nproperty.' 'What Duke?' 'The Duke of Buckingham. Did you never hear of\r\nit? About fifteen years ago his property was sold in lots, and the\r\npeople bought all the farms. You never saw such a stir in the world.' He\r\npointed out the houses on the hill-side which had been built to replace\r\nold tumble-down tenements, the red soil appearing under the plough, and\r\ncultivation going on with such general activity as had not been\r\nwitnessed till within these last few years. The appearance of these\r\nvillages was such as must strike every traveller from another part of\r\nthe country, and it was produced by simple means. The great estate of an\r\nembarrassed Duke had been divided and sold off; he had not been robbed;\r\nthe old miserable hovels of the former tenants had been pulled down, and\r\nnew life and activity had been given to the whole district. If you could\r\nhave such a change as this in Ireland, you would see such a progress and\r\nprosperity that gentlemen would hardly know the district from which they\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nI think it only fair to my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster to\r\nsay, that I do not believe the time is come in Ireland, and I do not\r\nbelieve it ever will come, when it will be necessary to have recourse to\r\nso vast and extraordinary a scheme as that which he has proposed to the\r\nHouse. It appears to me that it is not necessary for Ireland. There is\r\nthe land--there is the owner--there is the tenant. If the landowners had\r\nbeen a little wiser we might not have had before us to-night the\r\ndifficulty that now perplexes us. Suppose, for example, they had not\r\nbeen tempted to coerce or to make use of the votes of their tenants;\r\nsuppose they had not been tempted to withhold leases--undoubtedly the\r\ncondition of Ireland would have been far superior to what it now is. My\r\nhon. Friend the Member for Westminster has some scruples, I believe, on\r\nthe question of the ballot, but I believe even he would not object to\r\nsee that admirable machinery of election tried in that country. Do hon.\r\nGentlemen think it not necessary? I was talking, only two days ago, to a\r\nMember of this House who sat on one of the Irish election committees--\r\nthe Waterford committee, I think--and he said: 'We could not unseat the\r\nMembers, though the evidence went to show a frightful state of things;\r\nit was one of the most orderly elections they have in that country--only\r\nthree men killed and twenty-eight seriously wounded.' After all, we may\r\nsmile, and some of you may laugh at this, but it is not a thing to be\r\nlaughed at. It is a very serious matter, but it exists in no country in\r\nthe world where the ballot is in operation.\r\n\r\nIf you were to try that mode of election in Ireland it would have two\r\nresults: it would make your elections perfectly tranquil, and at the\r\nsame time it would withdraw from the landowner--and a most blessed thing\r\nfor the landowner himself this would be--it would withdraw from him the\r\ngreat temptation to make use of his tenant's vote for the support of his\r\nown political party; and if that temptation were withdrawn, you would\r\nhave much more inducement to grant leases to many of your tenants, and\r\nyou would take a step highly favourable, not to the prosperity of your\r\ntenants only, but to your own prosperity and your own honour. Now, Sir,\r\nI shall say no more upon that question except this, that I feel myself\r\nat a disadvantage in making a proposition of this nature to a House\r\nwhere landowners are so numerous and so powerful, but I have disarmed\r\nthem in so far that they will see that I mean them no harm, and that\r\nwhat I propose is not contrary to the principles of political economy;\r\nand that if Government is at liberty to lend money for all the purposes\r\nto which I have referred, Government must be equally at liberty to lend\r\nmoney for this greater purpose; and, farther, I venture to express my\r\nopinion, without the smallest hesitation or doubt, that if this were\r\ndone to the extent of creating some few scores of thousands of farmer\r\nproprietors in Ireland, you would find that their influence would be\r\naltogether loyal; that it would extend around throughout the whole\r\ncountry that whilst you were adding to the security of Government you\r\nwould awaken industry in Ireland from its slumber, and you would have\r\nthe wealth which you have not had before, and, with wealth, contentment\r\nand tranquillity in its train.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, it may appear egotistical in me to make one remark more, but I\r\nthink if the House will not condemn me I shall make it. Last year you\r\ndid, under the leadership of the right hon. Gentleman, accept a\r\nproposition which I had taken several years of trouble and labour to\r\nconvince you was wise. On Wednesday last, only two days ago, by an\r\nalmost unanimous vote you accepted a proposition with regard to another\r\nmatter, exactly in the form in which six or seven years ago I had urged\r\nyou to accept it. You in this House recollect when Mr. Speaker had to\r\ngive the casting vote, amidst vast excitement in the House, on the\r\nmiserable question of Church Rates; but now, on Wednesday last, you\r\naccepted that Bill almost without opposition; and I presume that, except\r\nfor the formality of a third reading, we have done with the question for\r\never. Now if you would kindly, I ask it as a favour--if you would kindly\r\nfor a moment forget things that you read of me which are not favourable,\r\nand generally which are not true, and if you would imagine that though I\r\nhave not an acre of land in Ireland, I can be as honestly a friend of\r\nIreland as the man who owns half a county, it may be worth your while to\r\nconsider for your own interest, the interests of your tenants, the\r\nsecurity of the country from which you come, for the honour of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, whether there is not something in the proposition that I\r\nhave made to you.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, perhaps the House will allow me to turn to that other question\r\nwhich, on the authority of the noble Lord the Chief Secretary for\r\nIreland, and the noble Lord the Member for King's Lynn, and indeed on\r\nthe authority of the Prime Minister himself, is considered the next\r\ngreatest--perhaps I ought to have said the greatest--question we have to\r\nconsider in connection with Irish affairs; I mean the Irish Church\r\nquestion. What is it that is offered upon this matter by the Government?\r\nThe noble Lord himself said very little about it, but he is not easy\r\nupon it; he knows perfectly well, and cannot conceal it, that the Irish\r\nChurch question is at the root of every other question in Ireland. The\r\nnoble Lord the Member for King's Lynn said also that it was, along with\r\nthe land, the great and solemn question which we had to discuss, and he\r\nturned round--I could discover it from the report in the paper, because\r\nI was not, as you may suppose, at the Bristol banquet--he turned round\r\nalmost with a look of despair, and implored somebody to come and tell us\r\nwhat ought to be done on this Irish question. And the Prime Minister\r\nhimself, in speaking of it, called it an 'Alien Church.' Bear that\r\nphrase in mind. It is a strong phrase, a phrase we can all understand,\r\nand we know that the right hon. Gentleman is a great master of phrases--\r\nhe says a word upon some subject; it sticks; we all remember it, and\r\nthis is sometimes a great advantage. 'Alien Church' is the name he gives\r\nit; and now, what does the noble Lord, acting, no doubt, under the\r\ndirection of his Colleagues and the Prime Minister, offer upon this\r\nquestion? He rather offered a defence of it; he did not go into any\r\nargument, but still, at the same time, he rather defied anybody to make\r\nan assault upon it; he believed that it would not succeed, and that it\r\nwas very wrong; but what does he really propose? Only this: to add\r\nanother buttress in the shape of another bribe. He says that he will\r\nmake an offer to the Roman Catholic hierarchy and people of Ireland--\r\nsome say that the people do not want it, and that the hierarchy do want\r\nit, but I say nothing about that, because I hope the Catholic people of\r\nIreland are at least able to defend themselves from the hierarchy, if\r\nthe hierarchy wish to cripple them too much--he says he will endow a\r\nRoman Catholic University in Ireland. As the noble Lord went on with his\r\nspeech he touched upon the question of the Presbyterian _Regium\r\nDonum_, and spoke of it, I think, as a miserable provision for the\r\nPresbyterians of the North of Ireland; and evidently, if he had had the\r\ncourage, the desperate courage to do it, he would have proposed, whilst\r\nhe was offering to endow a new Roman Catholic University, to increase or\r\ndouble the _Regium Donum_. The noble Lord does not express any\r\ndissent from this, and I rather think he wishes that it were safely\r\ndone. The object of this, and what he would like to have said to the\r\nhon. Gentlemen about him who came from Ireland to represent the Roman\r\nCatholic population, and to the Presbyterians of the North of Ireland,\r\nwas this: 'If you will continue to support the Protestant Church in\r\nIreland and the Protestant supremacy, we will endow you (the Roman\r\nCatholics) a University, really, if not professedly, under clerical\r\nrule; and as to you (the Presbyterians), we will double your stipends by\r\ndoubling the amount of the _Regium Donum_.'\r\n\r\nNow, why do you offer anything? Why is it we are discussing this\r\nquestion? Why did the noble Lord think it necessary to speak for three\r\nhours and twenty minutes on the subject? Because the state of Ireland is\r\nnow very different from the state which we have sometimes seen, and very\r\ndifferent, I hope, from that which many of us may live to see hereafter;\r\nbecause Ireland has a certain portion of its population rebellious, has\r\na larger portion disloyal and discontented, but has a still larger\r\nportion dissatisfied with the Imperial rule. Now I must say--I hope the\r\nnoble Lord will not think I am saying anything uncivil--but I must say\r\nthat his proposition appears to be at once grotesque and imbecile, and I\r\nthink at the same time--though I do not like to use unpleasant words--\r\nthat to a certain extent it must be held to be--in fact, I think the\r\nhon. Gentleman the Member for North Warwickshire hinted as much--not\r\nonly very wrong, but very dishonest. At this moment it seems to find no\r\nfavour on either side of the House, although I can understand the\r\nCatholic Members of the House feeling themselves bound to say nothing\r\nagainst it, and perhaps, if it came to a division, to vote for it; but I\r\nbelieve there is not a Catholic Member on this side of the House who\r\ncould in his conscience say that it was right in him to accept this\r\nproposition as a bribe that he should hereafter support Protestant\r\nsupremacy. In fact, it appears to me exactly in the position now that\r\nthe dual vote was in this time twelve months, and there are people who\r\nsay that it has been brought forward with the same object, and that by-\r\nand-by, as nobody is for it, the right hon. Gentleman will say that as\r\nnobody is in favour of it they will not urge it upon Parliament. Now,\r\ndoes anybody believe that a Catholic University in Ireland could have\r\nthe smallest effect upon Fenianism, or upon the disloyalty, discontent,\r\nand dissatisfaction of which Fenianism is the latest and the most\r\nterrible expression? It is quite clear that for the evil which we have\r\nto combat, the remedy which the right hon. Gentleman offers through the\r\nChief Secretary for Ireland is no remedy at all.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of an anecdote which is related by Addison. He says that\r\nin his time there was a man who made a living by cheating the country\r\npeople. He was not a Cabinet Minister,--he was only a mountebank,--and\r\nhe set up a stall, and sold pills that were very good against the\r\nearthquake. Well, that is about the state of things that we are in now.\r\nThere is an earthquake in Ireland. Does anybody doubt it? I will not go\r\ninto the evidence of it, but I will say that there has been a most\r\nextraordinary alarm--some of it extravagant, I will admit--throughout\r\nthe whole of the three kingdoms; and although Fenianism may be but a\r\nlow, a reckless, and an ignorant conspiracy, the noble Lord has admitted\r\nthat there is discontent and disaffection in the country; and when the\r\nMember for one of the great cities of Ireland comes forward and asks the\r\nImperial Parliament to discuss this great question--this social and\r\npolitical earthquake under which Ireland is heaving--the noble Lord\r\ncomes forward and offers that there shall be a clerical-governed endowed\r\nUniversity for the sons, I suppose, of the Catholic gentlemen of\r\nIreland. I have never heard a more unstatesmanlike or more\r\nunsatisfactory proposition; and I believe the entire disfavour with\r\nwhich it has been received in this House is only a proper representation\r\nof the condemnation which it will receive from the great majority of the\r\npeople of the three kingdoms.\r\n\r\nDo not let any one suppose that I join in the terms which I regretted to\r\nhear from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Stroud, and still less\r\nthat I join in the, in my opinion, more offensive terms which fell from\r\nthe right hon. Gentleman the Member for Calne. There can be no good in\r\nour attacking either the Catholic population or the Catholic hierarchy\r\nof Ireland. We have our duty straight before us, which is to do both the\r\nhierarchy and the people justice. We are not called upon to support the\r\nplan of the Government, and I believe the people of Great Britain, and a\r\nvery large portion of the people of Ireland, will rejoice when the House\r\nof Commons shall reject a proposition which is adverse to the course we\r\nhave taken for many years past, and a proposition which would have no\r\nbetter effect in tranquillising Ireland in the future than the increase\r\nof the grant to Maynooth did more than twenty years ago. Sir Robert Peel\r\nat that time, with the most honourable and kindly feeling to Ireland,\r\nproposed to increase the grant to Maynooth, and it was passed, I think,\r\nby a large majority of the House, I being one of a very few persons on\r\nthis side of the House who opposed the grant. I was as kindly disposed\r\nto the Catholics of Ireland as Sir Robert Peel, but I was satisfied that\r\nwas not the path of tranquillisation, and that if he trod that path it\r\nwould before any long time have to be retraced; and I think, if you now\r\nproceed upon the course recommended by the right hon. Gentleman, you\r\nwill fail in the pacification of Ireland, and the time will come when\r\nyou will have to retrace the steps he invites you to tread in now.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I think we have arrived at this point of the question--that we\r\nhave absolutely arrived at it, and there is no escape from it--that it\r\ndoes not matter in the least whether the right hon. Gentleman sits on\r\nthe Treasury Bench, or whether the right hon. Member for South\r\nLancashire takes his place, or whether the two should unite--which is a\r\nvery bold figure of speech--but I say that if the two should unite, it\r\ncould not alter this fact, that the Protestant supremacy, as represented\r\nby a State Church in Ireland, is doomed, and is, in fact, at an end.\r\nWhatever are the details, and I admit that they will be very difficult\r\ndetails in some particulars, which may be introduced into the measure\r\nwhich shall enact the great change that the circumstances of Ireland and\r\nthe opinion of the United Kingdom have declared to be necessary, this,\r\nat least, we have come to, that perfect religious equality henceforth,\r\nand not only religious equality, but equality on the voluntary\r\nprinciple, must be granted.\r\n\r\nSome hon. Gentlemen opposite have spoken about a pamphlet which has\r\nrecently been written by Lord Russell. I would speak of Lord Russell, as\r\nthe House knows, as I would always of a man older than myself, and whose\r\nservices to the country have been so long and so great; I speak of him\r\nwith great respect, and I say that the pamphlet is written with\r\nwonderful fire, that it contains in it very much that is interesting,\r\nand very much that is true, but its one fault is that it should have\r\nbeen published about forty years ago. Lord Russell's proposition is\r\npolitically just in the division which he proposes of the property of\r\nthe Church in Ireland, and, if public opinion had not condemned the\r\ncreation of new Established Churches, it might have been possible to\r\nhave adopted his scheme as it is. But I say the time has gone by for the\r\nestablishment of new State Churches. They will never again be planted as\r\nan institution in this country, and I suspect there is no other country\r\nin the world which has not an Established Church that would wish to\r\npossess one. But, if the House will allow me, I should like to advert to\r\na little scheme on this matter which I was bold enough to explain to my\r\ncountrymen on the occasion to which I have referred. It is not a new\r\nscheme in my mind, for the whole principle of it, with an elaborate\r\nargument in its favour, were published very widely in the year 1852, in\r\na letter which I wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Kilkenny (Sir\r\nJohn Gray), who was one of certain persons, Members of Parliament and\r\nothers, who met in conference in Dublin on the question of religious\r\nequality in Ireland. I only state this to show that it is no new idea,\r\nand that I have had plenty of time to consider it. There have been great\r\nobjections to the plan, and amongst those who have objected to it, as\r\nmight possibly have been expected, were gentlemen of the Liberation\r\nSociety. Now, I know many of the leading members of that Society, and\r\nthey are very good men. Even those who may think they are mistaken\r\nwould, if they knew them, join with me in that opinion. One of them, at\r\nleast, who was once a Member of this House, and, in all probability,\r\nwill be here again--Mr. Miall--is not only a good man, but he is a great\r\nman. I judge him by the nobleness of his principles, and by the grand\r\ndevotion which he has manifested to the teaching of what he believes to\r\nbe a great truth. I take criticisms from them kindly, as we ought to\r\ntake them from our friends when they are honestly given.\r\n\r\nWhat is the condition of Ireland at this moment with which you have to\r\ndeal? There is not only the Church which it is proposed to disestablish,\r\nbut you have the _Regium Donum_, which, if the Church be\r\ndisestablished, must necessarily be withdrawn; and you have, if these\r\ntwo things happen, a grant to Maynooth, the Act conferring which must\r\nnecessarily be repealed. Now, in doing these things the House will\r\nobserve that we shall disturb all the three principal sects or Churches\r\nin Ireland, and we can only do it, or attempt to do it, on the ground\r\nthat we are about to accomplish some great public good. Well, my\r\nproposal, which some hon. Gentlemen, I dare say, will have some vague\r\nidea of, was made with the view of easing Parliament in the great\r\ntransaction, from which I believe it cannot escape. It is a great thing\r\nin statesmanship, when you are about to make a change which is\r\ninevitable, and which shocks some, disturbs more, and makes hesitating\r\npeople hesitate still more--it is a great thing, I say, if you can make\r\nthe past slide into the future without any great jar, and without any\r\ngreat shock to the feelings of the people. And in doing these things the\r\nGovernment can always afford to be generous and gracious to those whom\r\nthey are obliged to disturb.\r\n\r\nWe have found that this has been the case when needful changes have been\r\nproposed; for instance, hon. Gentlemen will recollect, when tithe\r\ncommutation for Ireland was passed, that there was a certain concession\r\nmade to the landowners of Ireland, to induce them to acquiesce in the\r\nproposition of Parliament. We know that when slavery was abolished a\r\nconsiderable sum of money was voted. Lord Derby proposed in this House\r\nthat compensation should be given to the slaveowners. If it had not been\r\nfor that, slavery would before long have been abolished by violence. But\r\nParliament thought it was much better to take the step it did take, and\r\nI am not, at this period of time, about for a moment to dispute its\r\nwisdom. In all these things we endeavour, if we are forced to make a\r\ngreat change, to make it in such a manner as that we shall obtain the\r\nacquiescence and the support, if possible, of those who are most likely\r\nto be nearly affected by it. Suppose we were going to disestablish the\r\nChurch of Scotland--and I understand that there are a great number\r\nbelonging to the Established Church of Scotland who are coming round to\r\nthe opinion that it would be much to their benefit, and I think for the\r\nbenefit of their Church, if it were disestablished--if we were going to\r\ndisestablish the Church of Scotland or the Church of England, no person\r\nfor a moment would suppose that, after having taken all the tithes and\r\nall the income from these Churches, you would also take all the churches\r\nand all the parsonage-houses from the Presbyterian people of Scotland,\r\nor from the Episcopal Church people in England. You would not do\r\nanything of that kind. You would do to them as we should wish, if we\r\nwere in their position, that the Government and Parliament should do to\r\nus. Do what you have to do thoroughly for the good of the country, but\r\ndo it in such a manner as shall do least harm, and as shall gain the\r\nlargest amount of acquiescence from those whom you are about to affect.\r\nI venture to say that such is the course we should take about Ireland.\r\n\r\nI am very free in speaking on these matters. I am not a Catholic in the\r\nsense of Rome. I am not a Protestant in the sense in which that word is\r\nused in Ireland. I am not connected with a powerful sect in England. I\r\nthink, from my training, and education, and association, and thought on\r\nthese questions, I stand in a position which enables me to take as fair\r\nand unimpassioned a view of the matter as perhaps any man in the House.\r\nNow, if I were asked to give my advice, and if I am not asked I shall\r\ngive it--I should propose that where there are congregations in Ireland--\r\nI am speaking now, of course, of the present Established Church--who\r\nwould undertake to keep in repair the church in which they have been\r\naccustomed to worship, and the parsonage-house in which their ministers\r\nlive, Parliament should leave them in the possession of their churches\r\nand of their parsonage-houses. And I believe I speak the sentiment of\r\nevery Catholic Member on this side of the House, and probably of every\r\nintelligent Catholic in Ireland, not only of the laity but of the\r\nhierarchy and the priesthood, when I say that they would regard such a\r\ncourse as that on the part of Parliament as just, under the\r\ncircumstances in which we are placed. Well, then, of course there would\r\nbe no more bishops appointed by the Crown, and that institution in\r\nIreland would come to an end, except it were continued upon the\r\nprinciple upon which bishops are appointed in Scotland. All State\r\nconnection would be entirely abolished. You would then have all alike.\r\nThe Protestants would have their churches and parsonage-houses as they\r\nhave now. But the repairs of them, and the support of their ministers,\r\nwould be provided by their congregations, or by such an organisation as\r\nthey chose to form. The Catholics would provide, as they have hitherto\r\ndone so meritoriously and with a remarkable liberality, for themselves.\r\n\r\nNo greater instance of generosity and fidelity to their Church can be\r\nseen in the world than that which has been manifested by the Catholic\r\npeople of Ireland. They have their churches and their priests' houses in\r\nmany places. There is no pretence for meddling with them. In the north\r\nof Ireland, where the Presbyterians are most numerous, they would also\r\nhave their places of worship, and their ministers' houses as they have\r\nnow. All the Churches, therefore, in that respect would be on an\r\nequality. Well, now, the real point of this question, and which will\r\ncreate in all probability much feeling in Parliament and in the country,\r\nis, what should be done on the question of the Maynooth Grant, and on\r\nthe question of the _Regium Donum?_ They must be treated alike, I\r\npresume. If you preserve the life interests of the ministers and bishops\r\nof the Established Church, it may be right to preserve the life\r\ninterests of the ministers of the Presbyterian Church, and it may be\r\nright also in some way or other to make some provision that shall not in\r\nthe least degree bring them under the control of the State. And some\r\nprovision might have to be made to the Catholic Church in lieu of the\r\nMaynooth Grant, which, of course, you would be obliged to withdraw.\r\nThese are points which I will not discuss in detail. I merely indicate\r\nthem for the sake of showing to the House, and to a great number of\r\npeople who are regarding it with even more feeling than we do, what are\r\nsome of the difficulties of this question--difficulties which must be\r\nmet--difficulties which it will require all the moderation, all the\r\nChristian feeling, and all the patriotism which this House can muster on\r\nboth sides of it, with the view of settling this question permanently,\r\nand to the general satisfaction of the three kingdoms. Now, I will go no\r\nfurther, but to say that whatever is done--if a single sixpence is given\r\nby Parliament, in lieu of the Maynooth Grant, or in lieu of the\r\n_Regium Donum_, it must be given on these terms only--and on that\r\nmatter I think Lord Russell has committed a great error--that it becomes\r\nthe absolute property of the Catholics or of the Presbyterians--it must\r\nbe as completely their property as the property of the great Wesleyan\r\nbody in this country, or of the Independents, or of the Baptists,\r\nbelongs to these bodies. It must be property which Parliament can never\r\npretend to control, or regulate, or withdraw.\r\n\r\nAnd having consented to that condition, the three Churches of Ireland\r\nwould be started as voluntary Churches, and instead of fighting, as I am\r\nsorry to say they have been fighting far longer than within the memory\r\nof man, I hope soon there would be a competition among them which should\r\ndo most for the education, the morals, and the Christianity of the\r\npopulation who are within their instruction and guidance. Now,\r\nProtestants in this country--I think almost all Protestants--object very\r\nstrongly to Rome. The Nonconformists object to endowments. They\r\nsometimes, I think, confound establishments with endowments. I think it\r\nabsolutely essential that establishments should cease, and that there\r\nshould be nothing in the way of endowment unless it be some small\r\nprovision such as that which I have indicated; which it might be\r\nnecessary to make when you are withdrawing certain things which the\r\nChurches in Ireland had supposed were theirs in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nNow, one word which I would say to the Nonconformist people of England\r\nand Scotland, if the House will allow me to speak, is this--they should\r\nbear in mind that the whole of this property which is now in the\r\npossession of the Established Church of Ireland is Irish property. It\r\ndoes not belong to Scotland or to England, and it would be a measure\r\nintolerable and not to be thought of, that it should be touched or dealt\r\nwith in any manner that is not in accordance with the feelings and the\r\ninterests of the people of Ireland. Let any man who to-morrow criticises\r\nthis part of my speech ask himself what an Irish Parliament freely\r\nelected would do with the ecclesiastical funds of Ireland. I think the\r\nPresbyterians of Scotland, the Churchmen and Nonconformists of England,\r\nhave no right to suppose themselves to be judges with regard to\r\nreligious matters in Ireland. They have a perfect right to say to\r\nParliament through their representatives, 'We will discontinue the State\r\nChurch in Ireland, and we will create no other State Churches.' But that\r\nseems to be about the extent of the interference which they are entitled\r\nto in this matter.\r\n\r\nI hope I have explained with tolerable clearness the views which I have\r\nfelt it my duty to lay before the House on the occasion of this great\r\nquestion. The House will see, and I think hon. Gentlemen opposite will\r\nadmit, that I am at least disposed to treat it as a great question\r\nwhich, if it be dealt with, should be dealt with in the most generous,\r\ngracious, and, if you like, tender manner by Parliament, as respects the\r\nfeelings and interests of all who are most directly concerned. The right\r\nhon. Gentleman the Home Secretary, in his speech last night, said that\r\nthis proposal to disestablish the Established Church of Ireland was, in\r\npoint of fact, in some sort a revolution. This, at any rate, I am\r\nsatisfied, would be not only an entirely bloodless revolution, but a\r\nrevolution full of blessing to the Irish people.\r\n\r\nI have not said a word--I never said a word in this House, and, I\r\nbelieve, never out of it, to depreciate the character of the clergymen\r\nof the Established Church in Ireland. I think no religious ministers are\r\nplaced in a more unfortunate position, and I am satisfied that many of\r\nthem feel it to be so. I have not the least doubt, when this transaction\r\nis once accomplished, that they will breathe more freely. I believe they\r\nwill be more potent in their ministrations, and that their influence,\r\nwhich must, or ought to be, considerable, will be far more extensive\r\nthan it has been, and far more beneficial in the districts in which they\r\nlive. But being so great a question, as the Home Secretary described it,\r\nit can only be settled by mutual and reasonable concession. The main\r\nprinciple being secured, that State Church supremacy is abolished in\r\nIreland, and that the Irish Churches are henceforth to be free Churches\r\nupon the voluntary principle, then I should be willing, and I would\r\nrecommend every person in the country whom my voice may reach, to make\r\nany reasonable concession that can be suggested in the case. So anxious\r\nam I that it should be done, that I should be delighted to co-operate\r\nwith the right hon. Gentleman, and with hon. Members on the opposite\r\nside of the House, in support of any just measure for settling this\r\ngreat question. But I say, if it ever does come to be dealt with by a\r\ngreat and powerful Minister, let it be dealt with in a great and\r\ngenerous spirit. I would counsel to all men moderation and justice. It\r\nis as necessary to Protestants as to Catholics and to Nonconformists\r\nthat they should endeavour to get rid of passion in discussing this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWe are, after all, of one religion. I imagine that there will come a\r\ntime in the history of the world when men will be astonished that\r\nCatholics and Protestants have had so much animosity against and\r\nsuspicion of each other. I accept the belief in a grand passage, which I\r\nonce met with in the writings of the illustrious founder of the colony\r\nof Pennsylvania. He says that 'The humble, meek, merciful, just, pious,\r\nand devout souls are everywhere of one religion, and when death has\r\ntaken off the mask they will know one another, though the diverse\r\nliveries they wear here make them strangers.' Now, may I ask the House\r\nto act in this spirit, and then our work will be easy. The noble Lord,\r\ntowards the conclusion of his speech, spoke of the cloud which rests at\r\npresent over Ireland. It is a dark and heavy cloud, and its darkness\r\nextends over the feelings of men in all parts of the British Empire. But\r\nthere is a consolation which we may all take to ourselves. An inspired\r\nking and bard and prophet has left us words which are not only the\r\nexpression of a fact, but which we may take as the utterance of a\r\nprophecy. He says, 'To the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.'\r\nLet us try in this matter to be upright. Let us try to be just. That\r\ncloud will be dispelled. The dangers which surround us will vanish, and\r\nwe may yet have the happiness of leaving to our children the heritage of\r\nan honourable citizenship in a united and prosperous Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, APRIL 1, 1868.\r\n\r\n[This speech was made in the debate on Mr. Gladstone's resolutions for\r\ndisestablishing the Irish Church.]\r\n\r\nThe House will not expect me to follow the legal argument of the hon.\r\nand learned Member who has just sat down. I entertain a firm belief that\r\nthose legal cobwebs which are spread, and which are supposed to, and do\r\nin the minds of many Gentlemen, interpose between the completion of a\r\ngreat act of justice, will be swept away before long by the almost\r\nunanimous opinion of the people of the three kingdoms.\r\n\r\nDuring this debate, which has yet lasted only two nights, there has\r\nbeen, if not a remarkable change of opinion, a remarkable change of\r\nexpression. Last night we had an interesting speech from the noble Lord\r\nwho generally sits opposite me, the noble Lord the Member for Stamford.\r\nI refer only to the beginning of his speech, in which he spoke of his\r\naffection for the principle of a Church Establishment. There was a\r\nhesitation in his manner; he had a strong love for his principle, but it\r\nappeared to me that he thought the time was come when even that\r\ncherished principle would have to be surrendered. From the Treasury\r\nbench we had a speech from the noble Lord the Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs, and when he sat down it is difficult to say what was the\r\nprecise impression made upon the House; but I think, on the whole, the\r\nimpression made on the other side of the House--his own side--was by no\r\nmeans a comfortable one. Now to me it is, and I think to the House it\r\nis, a misfortune that we have a Government that speaks with a different\r\nvoice from night to night. We had it last year, and I presume, from the\r\nexample of the debate which lately took place on the motion of the hon.\r\nMember for Cork, and from the debate on this motion, we are about to see\r\na repetition of it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that the position of the Government is one of great\r\ndifficulty and perplexity; to speak plainly, it is one which I should\r\ncall, in our Constitutional system, altogether unnatural. They are the\r\nMinisters, the leaders of a minority of the House, and whilst they sat\r\nas leaders of the minority in opposition they defended the principles of\r\ntheir party, and they apparently regarded all their past career with\r\nsatisfaction; but the moment they are transferred to the Treasury bench\r\nthey find themselves in this difficulty, that although their party may\r\nstill wish to cling to their past opinions, there is something in the\r\nvery air, there is something throughout the mind of the whole kingdom,\r\nwhich teaches them that their past opinions are impossible in their new\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord the Member for King's Lynn made a speech not long ago at\r\nBristol, and in that speech he expressed what I am quite sure were his\r\nhonest opinions with regard to the condition of Ireland. He stated that\r\nthe condition of Ireland was one painful and dangerous, and to us, in\r\nappearance at least, discreditable. He said we had a strange and\r\nperplexing problem to solve; that in Ireland there was a miserable state\r\nof things. Then he said, 'If we look for a remedy, who can give us an\r\nintelligible answer? Ireland is the question of the hour.' And that is\r\nnot altogether at variance--in fact, I should say not at all at\r\nvariance--with the speech of the Chief Secretary for Ireland, who told\r\nus, as far as he knew, the facts about his country. But immediately\r\nafterwards we had the description of the right hon. Gentleman at the\r\nhead of the Government, to the effect that there was no crisis at all--\r\nthat, in point of fact, the condition of Ireland was a normal condition,\r\nand that there was no necessity for anything remarkable or unusual in\r\nthe legislation that was required. Now, to-night we have had a speech\r\nfrom the Home Secretary. I may say that every speaker on that side of\r\nthe House has admitted that his speech is entirely in opposition, in its\r\ntone, its purpose, and its principle, to the speech of the noble Lord\r\nthe Member for King's Lynn. It seems to me that the Home Secretary to-\r\nnight answered the Foreign Secretary of last night--and I suppose if the\r\ndebate goes on until Thursday, probably the right hon. Gentleman at the\r\nhead of the Government, or perhaps the Secretary of State for India,\r\nwill answer the speech of the Secretary of State for the Home\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nBut all this shows us that the House is in a wrong position. We have a\r\nminority in office which cannot assert its own views with safety, nor\r\ncan it with any more safety directly adopt our views; and thus, when, on\r\nthat side of the House, a Minister gets up and makes what is called a\r\nliberal speech on this question to us who are in opposition, that\r\ncreates discontent; and then another Minister rises and makes a speech\r\nof an exactly opposite character, to reconcile that discontent. There\r\nis, in fact, confusion and chaos in the House. We have a Government\r\nwhich is not a Government--and we have an Opposition which is not an\r\nOpposition, because really we do not oppose anything that you propose.\r\nYour propositions are not based upon your own principles, which you held\r\nwhen you sat on this side of the House, but on our principles, and\r\ntherefore we are not in opposition at all, but we help you as much as\r\npossible to enforce, not your own principles, but ours. Whatever\r\ncompensation it may be to right hon. Gentlemen who sit on that bench and\r\nenjoy the dignities and emoluments of office, I think there are many\r\nhonourable men on whom I am looking at this moment who do not observe\r\nthe course of these proceedings with entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut now, notwithstanding these difficulties, there remains this great\r\nquestion which we must discuss, and which, if possible, we must settle.\r\nI say, notwithstanding some observations to the contrary, that the\r\npeople of the three kingdoms are looking with anxious suspense at the\r\ncourse which Parliament may take on this question. The right hon.\r\nGentleman the Home Secretary on one occasion spoke of this question, of\r\nthis proposition, as being something in the nature of a revolution. But,\r\nif it be a revolution, after all it is not so great a one as we might\r\nsuppose from the force and energy of the speech which he has delivered\r\nto-night--a speech which, although I differ from his views, was, I must\r\nsay, a very good speech--in which he brought into the House a good deal\r\nof the energy of the people of that great county (Yorkshire) from which\r\nhe comes. But we are now about to deal with a question which only\r\naffects, according to the census, something under 700,000 people. I\r\nobserve hon. Gentlemen talk of the Protestants of Ireland as being one-\r\nfourth of the whole population--of being a million and a half. All that\r\nis fanciful exaggeration. According to the census the Episcopalians are\r\nnot more than 700,000, and let hon. Gentlemen bear this in mind--when\r\nthe census enumerators go round, if a man is not a Catholic or a\r\nPresbyterian, he is put down, unless he can state he is of some other\r\nsect, as an Episcopalian. And judging from what we know, there must be\r\nout of the 700,000 a considerable number who never go to church, and,\r\npolitically or religiously, have no interest in it. Therefore, I\r\nbelieve, speaking correctly, it would not be possible to show that there\r\nare Episcopalians in Ireland in intimate connection with the Established\r\nChurch to the amount of more than from half a million to 600,000.\r\n\r\nNow, this will not come to more than 100,000 families, that is, will not\r\nbe very much more than the population of Liverpool, or Manchester, or\r\nGlasgow; so that, in point of fact, this question, which is held to be a\r\nrevolution,--this great question affects only a population equal to that\r\nof the city of Glasgow, or of Liverpool, or of Manchester. And it is for\r\na population so small as this, I am told--for I am not versed in\r\ncomputations of this kind--you have no less than twelve bishops and\r\narchbishops, and that you have devoted for their services--for their\r\nreligious services--not less than the annual income arising from a\r\ncapital sum estimated to be, at least, ten or twelve millions sterling.\r\nNow, if their system of teaching is really very good, I must say there\r\nought to be in Ireland a more perfectly moral and religious population\r\namong the Church Protestants than there is in any other country in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are we about to do? What is the House about to do if we\r\nadopt the resolutions of the right hon. Member for South Lancashire? If\r\nthe House accept the advice of the majority sitting on this side, what\r\nwill be done? We are not going to commit any vital wrong upon that one\r\ncity population of 500,000 or 600,000. When we have done everything that\r\nI have suggested should be done, we shall leave them in as comfortable a\r\nposition as the majority of the people of Scotland are in at this\r\nmoment. We shall leave them as well off as eight or nine-tenths of the\r\npopulation of Wales are; we shall leave them as well off as half, and\r\nnot the least religious half, of the people of England are; we shall\r\nleave them as well off as the English, Scotch, Welsh, and Irish people\r\nwho form the population in our colonies, whether in North America or\r\nAustralia. And what can be more monstrous than for Gentlemen to come\r\nhere from Ireland--and there may he some from England--and tell us we\r\nare bringing about a revolution, that we are committing an enormous\r\noppression, that we are hazarding the loyalty of the people of the North\r\nof Ireland, when, after all, the most and worst which any of us proposes\r\nto do is that the Church population of Ireland will be left at least as\r\nwell off as any of the various populations of the Empire I have just\r\ndescribed? I hope hon. Gentlemen opposite will be convinced that it is\r\nnot a bottomless abyss we are going to plunge their friends into.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a very small question for the Church in Ireland and for\r\nthe Church people, I hold it is an infinitely larger question for the\r\nCatholic population. The hon. and learned Gentleman who spoke last\r\nrelies much upon law. I suppose it will be admitted that there are only\r\ntwo pretences on which this State Church--the Protestant Church--can\r\nexist in Ireland. The one is religious--the other is political. Now, has\r\nanybody been able to show that, as a religious institution, it has not\r\nbeen a deplorable failure? because clearly, the original intention, the\r\noriginal hope was, that the people of Ireland would be drawn from the\r\nChurch of Rome and brought into harmony with the Church of England. I\r\nundertake to say, from the time of its first establishment until now,\r\nreckoning up all the Catholics on the one side and the Protestants on\r\nthe other, that it could not be shown, and is not to be believed, that\r\nit has ever added really one person in every hundred persons to the\r\nactual number of Protestants in the kingdom of Ireland. It has been an\r\nentire failure--a failure deplorable, and almost ludicrous, as an engine\r\nfor converting the Catholic population. But it has not only not made\r\nCatholics into Protestants, but it has made Catholics in Ireland more\r\nintensely Roman than the members of that Church are found to be in any\r\nother country in Europe or in America. And what is more than that, I\r\nthink it can be demonstrated that the existence of the Protestant Church\r\nin Ireland, whether missionary or not in pretence, has not only not\r\nconverted the Catholics themselves, but has made it absolutely\r\nimpossible that anybody else, or any other Church, should convert them.\r\nBecause, if you look how the Church has been connected with the State,\r\nand with the politics of the country, with the supremacy of the landed\r\nproprietors, with the supremacy of the Protestant party, with all the\r\ndark records of the past, you will see the effect has been to make\r\nCatholicism in Ireland not only a faith, but absolutely a patriotism.\r\n\r\nI think I might appeal to every Member of the House who now hears me\r\nwhether, if he had been placed in Ireland with his father before him\r\namong the Catholic population--I might ask him whether he would not have\r\nfelt that if he threw off his allegiance to his Church, and if he\r\nentered the portals of this garrison Church, that it would have been to\r\nhim not only a change of faith, but a denial as it were of his birth and\r\nof his country. I have felt always in considering this question--and I\r\nhave considered it much for twenty-five years past--that all the\r\ncircumstances of that Church in Ireland have been such as to stimulate\r\nthe heart of every Catholic to a stronger adherence to his own faith,\r\nand to a determined and unchangeable rejection of the faith and of the\r\nChurch which were offered to him by the hands of conquest. There is one\r\npoint on this, too, which is important, that the more you have produced\r\ndissatisfaction with Imperial rule in Ireland, the more you have thrown\r\nthe population into the hands of Rome. Now, I hope I shall offend no\r\nCatholic Member in this House when I say that I consider it one of the\r\ngreatest calamities of the world that there are in many countries\r\nmillions of Catholic population who are liable to be directed in much of\r\ntheir conduct, and often in their political conduct, through their\r\nbishops and clergy from the centre of the city of Rome. I think that is\r\na misfortune--I think it is a misfortune to the freedom of the world.\r\nAnd I think, moreover, that it is a misfortune to every Catholic Church\r\nin every country, for it tends to prevent it from being wholly national,\r\nand it prevents also such changes and such reformations as, I believe,\r\nare necessary in the progress of every Church. We see some result of\r\nthis in other countries of Europe. Notably, at this moment, in Austria,\r\neven in that country which we lately thought was the very last in the\r\nrace of freedom, there is a contest going on with Rome. But there\r\nprobably is no country in Europe at this moment in which the Catholic\r\nChurch and population are more entirely subject than in Ireland to the\r\ndirect influence of a certain number of persons, of whom most of us know\r\nnothing, who pull the strings of the Catholic world in the city of Rome.\r\nI attribute much of this, which I think a great evil, to the existence\r\nof the Protestant Church in Ireland. You know perfectly well that the\r\ngreat discontent of Ireland is chiefly entertained by the Catholic\r\npopulation, and you know that this population is even at this moment,\r\nmore than it was some years ago, subject directly to political\r\ninfluences from Rome. But I am satisfied that it is for the interest of\r\nthe Catholic population, and that it is for the interest of this great\r\nnation and of this Imperial Government, that whatsoever be the tie\r\nbetween the Catholic population of Ireland and the Government in\r\nIreland, we ought at least to take away every obstacle that can lessen\r\nin the smallest degree the loyalty of that people to the Imperial Crown.\r\n\r\nAnd if this Church has failed as a religious institution, how stands it\r\nas a political institution? It was intended not only to convert the\r\nCatholics, but to secure the Union. An hon. Gentleman, with a courage\r\nthat I should not like to imitate, said that if the 5th Article of the\r\nAct of Union should be altered, then in point of fact the Union is as\r\ngood as abolished. I see the hon. Gentleman up there, and I think he is\r\nnot the only one who has said it in the course of this discussion. It is\r\na very old and not a very strange device to expect the people to be made\r\nloyal through the instrumentality of the clergy. I know that many\r\ncenturies ago a monk of some celebrity at the Court of Louis of Bavaria\r\ntold that monarch, 'You defend me with the sword, and I will defend you\r\nwith the pen.' We have been during all this time defending this Church\r\nwith the sword. The sword has scarcely ever been out of the hand of the\r\ngoverning power in Ireland. And if a fair, simple, and unadorned\r\nnarrative were given of the transactions of this Parliament with\r\nIreland, with regard to its different enactments, coercive restrictions,\r\nsuspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act, and so forth, it would form a\r\nnarrative which would astonish the world and would discredit us. Sir, I\r\nam afraid it is not too much to say that, in support of this supremacy,\r\nmany victims have perished on the scaffold in Ireland, and that the\r\nfields of Ireland have been more than once drenched with the blood of\r\nher people. But, after all this is done, we are not a bit more secure.\r\n\r\nIt is no matter what Government sits on the bench opposite. The right\r\nhon. Gentleman the Member for South Lancashire was there two years ago,\r\nand on that occasion, by the consent of his Colleagues, the then Home\r\nSecretary had to introduce the Bill for the suspension of the Habeas\r\nCorpus Act. Now you are on that side of the House, and you have to do\r\nthe same. Nobody says it is not necessary. I am not prepared to say it\r\nhas not been necessary at other times. But surely if this be necessary--\r\nand if there is this painful duty to perform at various times--it shows\r\nthat the Union is not very secure in Ireland. In fact, Sir, it is the\r\nmost painful thing that we have witnessed lately, that the suspension of\r\nthe Habeas Corpus Act has become so common that it causes almost no\r\nremark. The measure is introduced into the House. An Irish Member makes\r\na feeble protest against it, and it is passed, and we suspend the\r\nliberties of one of the three kingdoms from year to year. And the Prime\r\nMinister has the courage--I might almost use another word--he has the\r\ncourage to say there is no crisis, and that things are going on very\r\nmuch as usual, and that the House of Commons is not required to do much\r\nor care much for that country.\r\n\r\nWhat you have in Ireland is this. There is anarchy, which is subdued by\r\nforce, and after centuries of rule--not our rule, but that of our\r\nforefathers--we have got no farther. We have not reconciled Ireland to\r\nus, we have done none of those things which the world says we ought to\r\nhave done; and at this moment--in the year 1868--we are discussing the\r\nquestion whether it is possible to make any change with reference to the\r\nEstablished Church in Ireland which will bring about a better state of\r\nfeeling between the people and the Imperial Government. Sir, I am afraid\r\nthere has been very little statesmanship and very much neglect, and I\r\nthink we ought to take shame to ourselves, and try to get rid of some of\r\nour antiquated prejudices on this matter, and look at it as men would\r\nlook at it from a distance, as men whose vision is not impaired by the\r\npassionate feelings which have so often prevailed in this country with\r\nregard to this question. What, then, is the remedy that is now offered?\r\nWhat do people say of it? Now, I challenge any hon. Gentleman on the\r\nother side to deny this, that out of half a million Episcopalians in\r\nIreland there are many--there are some in the Irish nobility, some\r\nlanded proprietors, some magistrates, even some of the clergy, a great\r\nmany Irishmen--who believe at this moment that it is of the very first\r\nimportance that the proposition of the right hon. Gentleman the Member\r\nfor South Lancashire should be carried.\r\n\r\nI am not going to overstate my case. I do not say that all of them are\r\nof that opinion. Of that half-million, say that one-fourth--I will state\r\nno number--but of this I am quite certain, that there is an influential,\r\na considerable, and, as I believe, a wise minority, who are in favour of\r\ndistinct and decided action on the part of Parliament with regard to\r\nthis question. But if you ask the whole Roman Catholic population of\r\nIreland, be they nobles, or landed proprietors, or merchants, or\r\nfarmers, or labourers,--the whole number of the Catholic population in\r\nIreland being, I suppose, eight or nine times the number of\r\nEpiscopalians--these are probably, without exception, of opinion that it\r\nwould be greatly advantageous and just to their country if the\r\nproposition submitted on this side of the House should receive the\r\nsanction of Parliament. Now, if some Protestants and all Catholics are\r\nagreed that we should remove this Church, what would happen if Ireland\r\nwas 1,000 miles away, and we were discussing it as we might discuss the\r\nsame state of affairs in Canada? If we were to have in Canada and in\r\nAustralia all this disloyalty among the Roman Catholic population, owing\r\nto the existence of a State Church there, the House would be unanimous\r\nthat the State Church in those colonies should be abolished, and that\r\nperfect freedom in religion should be given.\r\n\r\nBut there is a fear in the mind of the right hon. Gentleman the Home\r\nSecretary that the malady which would exist in Ireland might cross the\r\nChannel and appear in England; that in fact the disorder of\r\nVoluntaryism, as he deems it, in Ireland, like any other contagious\r\ndisorder, might cross the Channel, by force of the west wind, lodging\r\nfirst in Scotland, and then crossing the Tweed and coming south to\r\nEngland. I think the right hon. Gentleman went so far as to say that he\r\nwas so much in favour of religious equality, that if you went so far as\r\nto disestablish the Church in Ireland, he would recommend the same\r\npolicy for England. Now, with regard to that, I will give you an\r\nanecdote which has reference to Scotland. Some years ago I had the\r\npleasure of spending some days in Scotland at the house of the late Lord\r\nAberdeen, after he had ceased to be Prime Minister. He was talking of\r\nthe disruption of the Church of Scotland, and he said that nothing in\r\nthe course of his public life had given him so much pain as the\r\ndisruption, and the establishment of the Free Church in that country;\r\nbut he said he had lived long enough to discover that it was one of the\r\ngreatest blessings that had ever come to Scotland. He said that they had\r\na vast increase in the number of churches, a corresponding increase in\r\nthe number of manses or ministers' houses, and that schools had\r\nincreased, also, to an extraordinary extent; that there had been\r\nimparted to the Established Church a vitality and energy which it had\r\nnot known for a long period; and that education, morality, and religion\r\nhad received a great advancement in Scotland in consequence of that\r\nchange. Therefore, after all, it is not the most dreadful thing in the\r\nworld--not so bad as a great earthquake--or as many other things that\r\nhave happened. I am not quite sure that the Scottish people themselves\r\nmay not some day ask you--if you do not yourselves introduce and pass it\r\nwithout their asking--to allow their State Church to be disestablished.\r\n\r\nI met only the other day a most intelligent gentleman from the north of\r\nScotland, and he told me that the minister of the church he frequented\r\nhad 250_l_. a-year from the Establishment Funds, which he thought\r\nvery much too little, and he felt certain that, if the Establishment\r\nwere abolished, and the Church made into a Free Church, the salary of\r\nthe minister would be immediately advanced to at least 500_l_. a-\r\nyear. That is a very good argument for the ministers, and we shall see\r\nby-and-by, if the conversion of Scotland proceeds much further, that you\r\nmay be asked to disestablish their Church. The hon. Member for Honiton\r\nlast night quoted something which, I daresay, he did not recollect\r\naccurately--something which I had said respecting the Church of England;\r\nbut the fact is that the Church of England is not suffering from the\r\nassaults of the Liberation Society; it is suffering from a very\r\ndifferent complaint. It is an internal complaint. You have had it before\r\none of the courts of law within the last few days, and a very curious\r\ndecision has been given,--that candles are lawful, but incense is\r\nsomething terrible, and cannot be allowed; and then the newspapers tell\r\nyou that on the very next Sunday there is more incense in that\r\nparticular church which has been complained of than there ever had been\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI will tell hon. Gentlemen opposite what it is that endangers the State\r\nChurch now--I mean a State Church like this in England, against which\r\nthere is no violent political assault. It is the prevalence of zeal.\r\nWhenever zeal creeps into a State Church, it takes naturally different\r\nforms--one strongly Evangelical, another strongly High Church or\r\nRitualist--and these two species of zeal work on and on in opposition,\r\nuntil finally there comes a catastrophe, and it is found that it is not\r\nMr. Miall and the Liberation Society, although they have prepared men's\r\nminds not to dread it, but it is something wholly different, within the\r\nChurch itself, that causes the disruption of the Church. The Scottish\r\ndisruption did not take place from any assaults from without--it took\r\nplace from zeal and difficulties within; and if you could keep the whole\r\nof the Church of England perfectly harmonious within its own borders, it\r\nwould take a very daring prophet who would undertake to point out the\r\ntime when it would be disestablished.\r\n\r\nWe will confine ourselves, therefore, to Ireland, and I will ask hon.\r\nGentlemen this: I believe Gentlemen opposite do not usually reject the\r\nview which we entertain, that the abolition of the State Church in\r\nIreland would tend to lessen the difficulties of governing that country.\r\nI think there is scarcely an hon. Gentleman on the other side, who has\r\nnot some doubt of his previous opinions, some slight misgiving on this\r\npoint, and some disposition to accept our view of the case. Well, why\r\nshould you be afraid? Even children, we know, can be induced, by\r\nrepeated practice, to go into a dark room without fear. You have always,\r\nsomebody said the other night, lions in the path; but I will not dignify\r\nthem with the name of lions--they are but hobgoblins. Now, when you have\r\nseen and handled them, as you have a great many times since I have been\r\nin the habit of speaking face to face with you, these things are found,\r\nafter all, to be only hobgoblins; you have learned, after all, that they\r\nare perfectly harmless; and when you thought we were doing you harm, and\r\nupsetting the Constitution, you have found that, after all, we were\r\ndoing you good, and that the Constitution was rather stronger than it\r\nwas before. Let me point out for a moment some of these changes that\r\nwere found at the time to be of great difficulty, but have been found to\r\nbe very wise and good afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhen I came into this House, nearly twenty-five years ago, our colonial\r\nsystem was wholly different from what it is now. It has been changed:\r\nSir William Molesworth and Joseph Hume were mainly the authors in\r\nParliament of that change. Well, all our colonies, as we all admit, are\r\nmuch more easily governed and much more loyal than they were in those\r\ndays. Turning then to our financial system--and I really do not want to\r\noffend any one by mentioning this--you know that our financial system,\r\nsince Sir Robert Peel came into office in 1841, has been completely\r\nchanged, and yet the revenue of the country is larger, which I regard as\r\na misfortune--and not only larger, but more secure by far, if Parliament\r\nrequires it, than it was at any previous period of our history. Take the\r\nold protective system, which the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr.\r\nNewdegate) and some others have not forgotten. Free-trade was a\r\nfrightful monster. But the protective system is gone; and now every\r\ncandid man amongst you will admit that industry, being more free\r\nthroughout the country, is better rewarded, and that the land, which you\r\nsaid would go out of cultivation, and become of no value, sells for a\r\nhigher price in the market than it ever brought before.\r\n\r\nThere are two other points on which I wish to add a word. One was\r\nmentioned last night after many Members had gone home. The balance of\r\npower was once considered the beginning and end of our foreign policy,\r\nand I am not sure that there are not some old statesmen in the other\r\nHouse who believe in it even yet. What was done last night? The noble\r\nLord the Member for Haddingtonshire, who comes up from Scotland brimfull\r\nof enthusiasm for impossible projects, proposed to put in words which\r\nhad been rejected from the preamble of the Mutiny Bill relating to the\r\npreservation of the balance of power. What did one of your most\r\ndistinguished Ministers, the right hon. Baronet the Secretary for War,\r\nsay in reference to the proposition? He said he thought it singular that\r\nthe hon. Member for Chatham should have proposed to omit the words,\r\nbecause they really meant nothing, but he was still more surprised that\r\nthe noble Lord should have asked to have them replaced. Well, thus you\r\nsee that this balance of power is gone, and yet England, I will\r\nundertake to say, under the rational and fair administration of foreign\r\naffairs by the noble Lord the Member for King's Lynn, is just as much\r\nrespected by all foreign Powers as she was when we were ready to meddle\r\nin every stupid quarrel that occurred upon the Continent of Europe.\r\n\r\nNow, there is only one other thing to which I will advert--the question\r\nof the representation. You know, in 1830, there was almost no\r\nrepresentation. There were a few towns in which there was almost\r\nuniversal suffrage, and many scores of rotten boroughs; in fact, the\r\nwhole system was in such a state of congestion that it could not be\r\ntolerated any longer, and we had a small, but which might have been a\r\nvery large revolution, in amending that state of things. Last year you,\r\nwho had seen this hobgoblin for years, who had thought, I have no doubt,\r\nmany of you, that I was very unwise and very rash in the mode in which I\r\nhad proposed to extend the suffrage; last year you found out that it was\r\nnot so monstrous a thing after all, and you became almost enthusiastic\r\nin support of the right hon. Gentleman's Reform Bill. Well, you believe\r\nnow, and the First Minister, if this was an occasion on which he had to\r\nspeak about it, would tell you not to be afraid of what was done,--he\r\nwould tell you that, based on the suffrage of a larger portion of your\r\ncountrymen, Parliament will henceforth be more strong and more venerated\r\nby the people than ever it has been before.\r\n\r\nIf that is true of Parliament, what shall we say of the Throne itself\r\nafter all these changes? I will venture to ask, whatever of convenience\r\nthere may be in hereditary monarchy, whatever of historic grandeur in\r\nthe kingly office, whatever of nobleness in the possessor of the Crown,\r\nin all these things is it not true that everything is at least as fully\r\nrecognised by the nation as it ever was at any previous period? I do not\r\nmention these things to reproach anybody here. We all have to learn.\r\nThere are many in this House who have been in process of learning for a\r\ngood while. I am not sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for South\r\nLancashire would not admit to us that on this very question of the Irish\r\nChurch his opinions have been greatly expanded, and have been ripening\r\nfor a series of years. That is greatly to the credit, not only of his\r\nhead, but of his heart. We have seen even amongst you a progress in many\r\nthings--a progress which is most gratifying to me--that is a very small\r\nmatter; but it is a very wholesome indication that the minds of men are\r\nbecoming more open to the consideration of great principles in\r\nconnection with great public questions. And this gives us promise that\r\nin future we shall have--as, no doubt, we shall have--a Government more\r\nin accordance with public opinion and public interests than we have had\r\nin past times.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the changes that have been made in our time are the glory\r\nof our time, and I believe that our posterity will regard them as the\r\nnatural and blessed fruits of the growth of intelligence in our day. I\r\nmention these things to urge you not to close your ears to the arguments\r\nnor to close your hearts to the impressions of justice which must assail\r\nyou with regard to this question which is now being debated so much in\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland. I might appeal to a right hon. Gentleman who\r\nperhaps is in the House--the Member for the County of Limerick--who was\r\nat a very remarkable meeting held the other day in Limerick on this very\r\nquestion. I have heard from sources which cannot, I think, be\r\nquestioned, that it was one of the most remarkable meetings held in\r\nIreland within the last twenty years, or, perhaps, I might say for a\r\nlonger period. There was a far more healthy tone of mind, of conduct, of\r\nfeeling, of expression, of everything we wish for, but have not known\r\nthere for a very long period; and I believe and know--because I am told\r\nby witnesses who cannot be contradicted--that the change arose from the\r\ngrowing belief that there was a sufficient majority in this House, that\r\nthe general opinion of Parliament was sufficiently strong, to enable\r\nthis measure of justice and reconciliation to be passed. Now, I ask you,\r\nif, after what has taken place, you are able, unhappily able, to prevent\r\nthe progress of the movement which is now on foot for the\r\ndisestablishment of the State Church in Ireland, are you not of opinion\r\nthat it will create great dissatisfaction; that it will add to the\r\nexisting discontent; that it will make those that are hopeful despair;\r\nand that men--rash men, if you like--strong and earnest men, will speak\r\nto those that hitherto have not been rash, and have not been earnest,\r\nand will say, 'You see at last; is this not a proof convincing and\r\nunanswerable, that the Imperial Parliament sitting in London is not\r\ncapable of hearing our complaints, and of doing that justice which we as\r\na people require at its hands?'\r\n\r\nDo not imagine that I am speaking with personal hostility to the right\r\nhon. Gentleman who is your Chief Minister here. Do not imagine for a\r\nmoment that I am one of those, if there be any, who are hoping to drive\r\nhon. Gentlemen from that bench in order that I may take one of the\r\nplaces occupied by them. I would treat this subject as a thing far\r\nbeyond and far above party differences. The question comes before the\r\nHouse, of course, as all these great questions must, as a great party\r\nquestion, and I am one of the Members of this party; but it does not\r\nfollow that all the Members of a party should be actuated by a party\r\nspirit, or by a miserable, low ambition to take the place of a Minister\r\nof the Crown. I say there is something far higher and better than that;\r\nand if ever there was a question presented to Parliament which invited\r\nthe exercise of the highest and noblest feelings of Members of the\r\nHouse, I say this is that question.\r\n\r\nI say, then, do not be alarmed at what is proposed. Let us take this\r\nIrish State Church; let us take it, not with a rude--I am against\r\nrudeness and harshness in legislative action--but if not with a rude,\r\nstill with a resolute grasp. If you adopt the policy we recommend, you\r\nwill pluck up a weed which pollutes the air. ['Oh! Oh!'] I will give\r\nhon. Gentlemen consolation in the conclusion of the sentence--I say you\r\nwill pluck up a weed which pollutes the air; but you will leave a free\r\nProtestant Church, which will be hereafter an ornament and a grace to\r\nall those who may be brought within the range of its influence. Sir, I\r\nsaid in the beginning of my observations that there are the people of\r\nthree kingdoms who are waiting with anxious suspense for the solution of\r\nthis question. Ireland waits and longs. I appeal to the right hon.\r\nGentleman the Member for Limerick; I appeal to that Meeting, the\r\ncharacter of which he can describe, and perhaps may describe, to the\r\nHouse; and I say that Ireland waits and longs for a great act of\r\nreconciliation. I say, further, that England and Scotland are eager to\r\nmake atonement for past crimes and past errors; and I say, yet further,\r\nthat it depends upon us, this House of Commons, this Imperial\r\nParliament, whether that reconciliation shall take place, and whether\r\nthat atonement shall at length be made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWAR\r\nWITH\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWAR WITH RUSSIA--THE QUEEN'S MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, MARCH 31, 1854.\r\n\r\n_From Hansard._\r\n\r\n[Mr. Bright was opposed to the war with Russia. This speech was spoken\r\non the day when the message from the Crown announcing the declaration of\r\nwar was brought down to the House.]\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons which may induce a Member of this House to address\r\nit--he may hope to convince some of those to whom he speaks, or he may\r\nwish to clear himself from any participation in a course which he\r\nbelieves to be evil. I presume I am one of that small section of the\r\nHouse to whom the hon. Gentleman who has just spoken (Mr. Layard) has\r\nreferred, when he alluded to the small party who objected to the policy\r\nby which this country has arrived at the 'triumphant position which it\r\nnow occupies.' In coming forward to speak on this occasion, I may be\r\ntold that I am like a physician proposing to prescribe to-day for a man\r\nwho died yesterday, and that it is of no use to insist upon views which\r\nthe Government and the House have already determined to reject. I feel,\r\nhowever, that we are entering upon a policy which may affect the\r\nfortunes of this country for a long time to come, and I am unwilling to\r\nlose this opportunity of explaining wherein I differ from the course\r\nwhich the Government has pursued, and of clearing myself from any\r\nportion of the responsibility which attaches to those who support the\r\npolicy which the Government has adopted.\r\n\r\nWe are asked to give our confidence to the Administration in voting the\r\nAddress to the Crown, which has been moved by the noble Lord the Member\r\nfor London, and to pledge our support to them in the war in which the\r\ncountry is now to engage. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for\r\nBuckinghamshire (Mr. Disraeli), on a recent occasion, made use of a term\r\nwhich differed considerably from what he said in a former debate; he\r\nspoke of this war as a 'just and unnecessary war.' I shall not discuss\r\nthe justice of the war. It may be difficult to decide a point like this,\r\nseeing that every war undertaken since the days of Nimrod has been\r\ndeclared to be just by those in favour of it; but I may at least\r\nquestion whether any war that is unnecessary can be deemed to be just. I\r\nshall not discuss this question on the abstract principle of peace at\r\nany price, as it is termed, which is held by a small minority of persons\r\nin this country, founded on religious opinions which are not generally\r\nreceived, but I shall discuss it entirely on principles which are\r\naccepted by all the Members of this House. I shall maintain that when we\r\nare deliberating on the question of war, and endeavouring to prove its\r\njustice or necessity, it becomes us to show that the interests of the\r\ncountry are clearly involved; that the objects for which the war is\r\nundertaken are probable, or, at least, possible of attainment; and,\r\nfurther, that the end proposed to be accomplished is worth the cost and\r\nthe sacrifices which we are about to incur. I think these are fair\r\nprinciples on which to discuss the question, and I hope that when the\r\nnoble Lord the Member for Tiverton (Lord Palmerston) rises during this\r\ndebate, he will not assume that I have dealt with it on any other\r\nprinciples than these.\r\n\r\nThe House should bear in mind that at this moment we are in intimate\r\nalliance with a neighbouring Government, which was, at a recent period,\r\nthe originator of the troubles which have arisen at Constantinople. I do\r\nnot wish to blame the French Government, because nothing could have been\r\nmore proper than the manner in which it has retired from the difficulty\r\nit had created; but it is nevertheless quite true that France, having\r\nmade certain demands upon Turkey with regard to concessions to the Latin\r\nChurch, backed by a threat of the appearance of a French fleet in the\r\nDardanelles, which demands Turkey had wholly or partially complied with;\r\nRussia, the powerful neighbour of Turkey, being on the watch, made\r\ncertain other demands, having reference to the Greek Church; and Russia\r\nat the same time required (and this I understand to be the real ground\r\nof the quarrel) that Turkey should define by treaty, or convention, or\r\nby a simple note, or memorandum, what was conceded, and what were the\r\nrights of Russia, in order that the Government of Russia might not\r\nsuffer in future from the varying policy and the vacillation of the\r\nOttoman Government.\r\n\r\nNow, it seems to me quite impossible to discuss this question without\r\nconsidering the actual condition of Turkey. The hon. Member for\r\nAylesbury (Mr. Layard) assumes that they who do not agree in the policy\r\nhe advocates are necessarily hostile to the Turks, and have no sympathy\r\nfor Turkey. I repudiate such an assumption altogether. I can feel for a\r\ncountry like that, if it be insulted or oppressed by a powerful\r\nneighbour; but all that sympathy may exist without my being able to\r\nconvince myself that it is the duty of this country to enter into the\r\nserious obligation of a war in defence of the rights of that country.\r\nThe noble Lord the Member for Tiverton is one of the very few men in\r\nthis House, or out of it, who are bold enough to insist upon it that\r\nthere is a growing strength in the Turkish Empire. There was a Gentleman\r\nin this House, sixty years ago, who, in the debates in 1791, expressed\r\nthe singular opinion which the noble Lord now holds. There was a Mr.\r\nStanley in the House at that period, who insisted on the growing power\r\nof Turkey, and asserted that the Turks of that day 'were more and more\r\nimitating our manners, and emerging from their inactivity and indolence;\r\nthat improvements of every kind were being introduced among them, and\r\nthat even printing-presses had been lately established in their\r\ncapital.' That was the opinion of a Gentleman anxious to defend Turkey,\r\nand speaking in this House more than sixty years ago; we are now living\r\nsixty years later, and no one now, but the noble Lord, seems to insist\r\nupon the fact of the great and growing power of the Turkish Empire.\r\n\r\nIf any one thing is more apparent than another, on the face of all the\r\ndocuments furnished to the House by the Government of which the noble\r\nLord is a Member, it is this, that the Turkish Empire is falling, or has\r\nfallen, into a state of decay, and into anarchy so permanent as to have\r\nassumed a chronic character. The noble Lord surely has not forgotten\r\nthat Turkey has lost the Crimea and Bessarabia, and its control over the\r\nDanubian Principalities; that the Kingdom of Greece has been carved out\r\nof it; that it has lost its authority over Algiers, and has run great\r\nrisk of being conquered by its own vassal the Pasha of Egypt; and from\r\nthis he might have drawn the conclusion that the empire was gradually\r\nfalling into decay, and that to pledge ourselves to effect its recovery\r\nand sustentation, is to undertake what no human power will be able to\r\naccomplish. I only ask the House to turn to the statements which will be\r\nfound nearly at the end of the first of the Blue Books recently placed\r\non the table of the House, and they will find that there is scarcely any\r\ncalamity which can be described as afflicting any country, which is not\r\nthere proved to be present, and actively at work, in almost every\r\nprovince of the Turkish Empire. And the House should bear in mind, when\r\nreading these despatches from the English Consuls in Turkey to the\r\nEnglish Ambassador at Constantinople, that they give a very faint\r\npicture of what really exists, because what are submitted to us are but\r\nextracts of more extended and important communications. It may fairly be\r\nassumed that the parts which are not published are those which described\r\nthe state of things to be so bad, that the Government has been unwilling\r\nto lay before the House, and the country, and the world, that which\r\nwould be so offensive and so injurious to its ally the Sultan of Turkey.\r\n\r\nBut, if other evidence be wanting, is it not a fact that Constantinople\r\nis the seat of intrigues and factions to a degree not known in any other\r\ncountry or capital in the world? France demands one thing, Russia\r\nanother, England a third, and Austria something else. For many years\r\npast our Ambassador at Constantinople has been partly carrying on the\r\ngovernment of that country, and influencing its policy, and it is the\r\ncity in which are fought the diplomatic contests of the Great Powers of\r\nEurope. And if I have accurately described the state of Turkey, what is\r\nthe position of Russia? It is a powerful country, under a strong\r\nExecutive Government; it is adjacent to a weak and falling nation; it\r\nhas in its history the evidences of a succession of triumphs over\r\nTurkey; it has religious affinities with a majority of the population of\r\nEuropean Turkey which make it absolutely impossible that its Government\r\nshould not, more or less, interfere, or have a strong interest, in the\r\ninternal policy of the Ottoman Empire. Now, if we were Russian--and I\r\nput the case to the Members of this House--is it not likely, according\r\nto all the theories I have heard explained when we have been concerned\r\nin similar cases, that a large majority of the House and the country\r\nwould be strongly in favour of such intervention as Russia has\r\nattempted? and if I opposed it, as I certainly should oppose it, I\r\nshould be in a minority on that question more insignificant than that in\r\nwhich I have now the misfortune to find myself with regard to the policy\r\nof the Government on the grave question now before us.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord the Member for London has made a statement of the case of\r\nthe Government, and in favour of this Address to the Crown; but I\r\nthought it was a statement remarkably feeble in fact and in argument, if\r\nintended as a justification of the course he and his Colleagues have\r\ntaken. For the purposes of the noble Lord's defence, the Russian demand\r\nupon Turkey is assumed to be something of far greater importance than I\r\nhave been able to discover it to be from a careful examination of the\r\nterms in which it was couched. The noble Lord himself, in one of his\r\ndespatches, admits that Russia had reason to complain, and that she has\r\ncertain rights and duties by treaty, and by tradition, with regard to\r\nthe protection of the Christians in Turkey. Russia asserted these\r\nrights, and wished to have them defined in a particular form; and it was\r\non the question of the form of the demand, and the manner in which it\r\nshould be conceded, that the whole of this unfortunate difference has\r\narisen. Now, if Russia made certain demands on Turkey, this country\r\ninsisted that Turkey should not consent to them; for although the noble\r\nLord has attempted to show that Turkey herself, acting for herself, had\r\nresolved to resist, I defy any one to read the despatches of Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe without coming to the conclusion that, from the\r\nbeginning to the end of the negotiations, the English Ambassador had\r\ninsisted, in the strongest manner, that Turkey should refuse to make the\r\nslightest concession on the real point at issue in the demands of the\r\nRussian Government. As a proof of that statement, I may refer to the\r\naccount given by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, in his despatch of the 5th\r\nof May, 1853, of the private interview he had with the Sultan, the\r\nMinister of the Sultan having left him at the door, that the interview\r\nmight be strictly private. In describing that interview, Lord Stratford\r\nsays, 'I then endeavoured to give him a just idea of the degree of\r\ndanger to which his Empire was exposed.' The Sultan was not sufficiently\r\naware of his danger, and the English Ambassador 'endeavoured to give him\r\na just idea of it;' and it was by means such as this that he urged upon\r\nthe Turkish Government the necessity of resistance to any of the demands\r\nof Russia, promising the armed assistance of England, whatever\r\nconsequences might ensue. From the moment that promise was made, or from\r\nthe moment it was sanctioned by the Cabinet at home, war was all but\r\ninevitable; they had entered into a partnership with the Turkish\r\nGovernment (which, indeed, could scarcely be called a Government at\r\nall), to assist it by military force; and Turkey, having old quarrels to\r\nsettle with Russia, and old wrongs to avenge, was not slow to plunge\r\ninto the war, having secured the co-operation of two powerful nations,\r\nEngland and France, in her quarrel.\r\n\r\nNow, I have no special sympathy with Russia, and I refuse to discuss or\r\nto decide this question on grounds of sympathy with Russia or with\r\nTurkey; I consider it simply as it affects the duties and the interests\r\nof my own country. I find that after the first proposition for a treaty\r\nhad been made by Prince Menchikoff, that envoy made some concession, and\r\nasked only for a _Sened_, or Convention; and when that was\r\ndisapproved of, he offered to accept a note, or memorandum merely, that\r\nshould specify what should be agreed upon. But the Turk was advised to\r\nresist, first the treaty, then the convention, and then the note or\r\nmemorandum; and an armed force was promised on behalf of this country.\r\nAt the same time he knew that he would incur the high displeasure of\r\nEngland and France, and especially of England, if he made the slightest\r\nconcession to Russia. It was about the middle of May that Prince\r\nMenchikoff left Constantinople, not having succeeded in obtaining any\r\nconcession from the Porte; and it was on the 3rd of July that the\r\nRussian forces crossed the Pruth; thinking, I believe, by making a dash\r\nat the Principalities, to coerce Turkey, and deter her allies from\r\nrendering her the promised support. It has been assumed by some, that if\r\nEngland had declared war last year, Russia would have been deterred from\r\nany further step, and that the whole matter would have been settled at\r\nonce. I, however, have no belief that Russia on the one hand, or England\r\nand France on the other, would have been bullied into any change of\r\npolicy by means of that kind.\r\n\r\nI come now to the celebrated 'Vienna note.' I am bound here to say, that\r\nnobody has yet been able clearly to explain the difference between the\r\nvarious notes Turkey has been advised to reject, and this and other\r\nnotes she has been urged to accept. With respect to this particular\r\nnote, nobody seems to have understood it. There were four Ambassadors at\r\nVienna, representing England, France, Austria, and Prussia; and these\r\nfour gentlemen drew up the Vienna note, and recommended it to the Porte\r\nas one which she might accept without injury to her independence or her\r\nhonour. Louis Napoleon is a man knowing the use of language, and able to\r\ncomprehend the meaning of a document of this nature, and his Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs is a man of eminent ability; and Louis Napoleon and his\r\nMinister agree with the Ambassadors at Vienna as to the character of the\r\nVienna note. We have a Cabinet composed of men of great individual\r\ncapacity; a Cabinet, too, including no less than five Gentlemen who have\r\nfilled the office of Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and who may,\r\ntherefore, be presumed to understand even the sometimes concealed\r\nmeaning of diplomatic phraseology. These five Foreign Secretaries,\r\nbacked by the whole Cabinet, concurred with the Ambassadors at Vienna,\r\nand with the Emperor of the French and his Foreign Secretary, in\r\nrecommending the Vienna note to the Sultan as a document which he might\r\naccept consistently with his honour, and with that integrity and that\r\nindependence which our Government is so anxious to secure for him. What\r\nwas done with this note? Passing by the marvellous stupidity, or\r\nsomething worse, which caused that note not to be submitted to Turkey\r\nbefore it was sent to St. Petersburg, he would merely state that it was\r\nsent to St. Petersburg, and was accepted in its integrity by the Emperor\r\nof Russia in the most frank and unreserved manner. We were then told--I\r\nwas told by Members of the Government--that the moment the note was\r\naccepted by Russia we might consider the affair to be settled, and that\r\nthe dispute would never be heard of again. When, however, the note was\r\nsent to Constantinople, after its acceptance by Russia, Turkey\r\ndiscovered, or thought, or said she discovered, that it was as bad as\r\nthe original or modified proposition of Prince Menchikoff, and she\r\nrefused the note as it was, and proposed certain modifications. And what\r\nare we to think of these arbitrators or mediators--the four Ambassadors\r\nat Vienna, and the Governments of France and England--who, after\r\ndiscussing the matter in three different cities, and at three distinct\r\nand different periods, and after agreeing that the proposition was one\r\nwhich Turkey could assent to without detriment to her honour and\r\nindependence, immediately afterwards turned round, and declared that the\r\nnote was one which Turkey could not be asked to accede to, and\r\nrepudiated in the most formal and express manner that which they\r\nthemselves had drawn up, and which, only a few days before, they had\r\napproved of as a combination of wisdom and diplomatic dexterity which\r\nhad never been excelled?\r\n\r\nBut it was said that the interpretation which Count Nesselrode placed\r\nupon this note made it impossible for Turkey to accede to it. I very\r\nmuch doubt whether Count Nesselrode placed any meaning upon it which it\r\ndid not fairly warrant, and it is impossible to say whether he really\r\ndiffered at all from the actual intentions of the four Ambassadors at\r\nVienna. But I can easily understand the course taken by the Russian\r\nMinister. It was this:--seeing the note was rejected by the Turk, and\r\nconsidering that its previous acceptance by Russia was some concession\r\nfrom the original demand, he issued a circular, giving such an\r\nexplanation or interpretation of the Vienna note as might enable him to\r\nget back to his original position, and might save Russia from being\r\ncommitted and damaged by the concession, which, for the sake of peace,\r\nshe had made. This circular, however, could make no real difference in\r\nthe note itself; and notwithstanding this circular, whatever the note\r\nreally meant, it would have been just as binding upon Russia as any\r\nother note will be that may be drawn up and agreed to at the end of the\r\nwar. Although, however, this note was considered inadmissible,\r\nnegotiations were continued; and at the Conference at Olmutz, at which\r\nthe Earl of Westmoreland was present, the Emperor of Russia himself\r\nexpressed his willingness to accept the Vienna note--not in the sense\r\nthat Count Nesselrode had placed upon it, but in that which the\r\nAmbassadors at Vienna declared to be its real meaning, and with such a\r\nclause as they should attach to it, defining its real meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible from this fairly to doubt the sincerity of the desire\r\nfor peace manifested by the Emperor of Russia. He would accept the note\r\nprepared by the Conference at Vienna, sanctioned by the Cabinets in\r\nLondon and Paris, and according to the interpretation put upon it by\r\nthose by whom it had been prepared--such interpretation to be defined in\r\na clause, to be by them attached to the original note. But in the\r\nprecise week in which these negotiations were proceeding apparently to a\r\nfavourable conclusion, the Turkish Council, consisting of a large number\r\nof dignitaries of the Turkish Empire--not one of whom, however,\r\nrepresented the Christian majority of the population of Turkey, but\r\ninspired by the fanaticism and desperation of the old Mahomedan party--\r\nassembled; and, fearful that peace would be established, and that they\r\nwould lose the great opportunity of dragging England and France into a\r\nwar with their ancient enemy the Emperor of Russia, they came to a\r\nsudden resolution in favour of war; and in the very week in which Russia\r\nagreed to the Vienna note in the sense of the Vienna Conference, the\r\nTurks declared war against Russia,--the Turkish forces crossed the\r\nDanube, and began the war, involving England in an inglorious and costly\r\nstruggle, from which this Government and a succeeding Government may\r\nfail to extricate us.\r\n\r\nI differ very much from those Gentlemen who condemn the Government for\r\nthe tardy nature of their proceedings. I never said or thought that the\r\nGovernment was not honestly anxious for peace; but I believe, and indeed\r\nI know, that at an early period they committed themselves and the\r\ncountry to a policy which left the issue of peace or war in other hands\r\nthan their own--namely, in the hands of the Turks, the very last hands\r\nin which I am willing to trust the interests and the future of this\r\ncountry. In my opinion, the original blunder was committed when the\r\nTurks were advised to resist and not to concede; and the second blunder\r\nwas made when the Turks were supported in their rejection of the Vienna\r\nnote; for the moment the four Powers admitted that their recommendation\r\nwas not necessarily to be accepted by the Porte, they put themselves\r\nentirely into the hands of the Turk, and might be dragged into any depth\r\nof confusion and war in which that respectable individual might wish to\r\ninvolve them.\r\n\r\nThe course taken by Turkey in beginning the war was against the strong\r\nadvice of her allies; but, notwithstanding this, the moment the step was\r\ntaken, they turned round again, as in the case of the Vienna note, and\r\njustified and defended her in the course she had adopted, in defiance of\r\nthe remonstrances they had urged against it. In his speech to-night, the\r\nnoble Lord (Lord J. Russell) has occupied some time in showing that\r\nTurkey was fully justified in declaring war. I should say nothing\r\nagainst that view, if Turkey were fighting on her own resources; but I\r\nmaintain that, if she is in alliance with England and France, the\r\nopinions of those Powers should at least have been heard, and that, in\r\ncase of her refusal to listen to their counsel, they would have been\r\njustified in saying to her, 'If you persist in taking your own course,\r\nwe cannot be involved in the difficulties to which it may give rise, but\r\nmust leave you to take the consequences of your own acts.' But this was\r\nnot said, and the result is, that we are dragged into a war by the\r\nmadness of the Turk, which, but for the fatal blunders we have\r\ncommitted, we might have avoided.\r\n\r\nThere have been three plans for dealing with this Turkish question,\r\nadvocated by as many parties in this country. The first finds favour\r\nwith two or three Gentlemen who usually sit on the bench below me--with\r\na considerable number out of doors--and with a portion of the public\r\npress. These persons were anxious to have gone to war during last\r\nsummer. They seem actuated by a frantic and bitter hostility to Russia,\r\nand, without considering the calamities in which they might involve this\r\ncountry, they have sought to urge it into a great war, as they imagined,\r\non behalf of European freedom, and in order to cripple the resources of\r\nRussia. I need hardly say that I have not a particle of sympathy with\r\nthat party, or with that policy. I think nothing can be more unwise than\r\nthat party, and nothing more atrocious than their policy. But there was\r\nanother course recommended, and which the Government has followed. War\r\ndelayed, but still certain--arrangements made which placed the issue of\r\nwar in other hands than in those of the Government of this country--that\r\nis the policy which the Government has pursued, and in my opinion it is\r\nfatal to Turkey, and disastrous to England. There is a third course, and\r\nwhich I should have, and indeed have all along recommended--that war\r\nshould have been avoided by the acceptance on the part of Turkey either\r\nof the last note of Prince Menchikoff, or of the Vienna note; or, if\r\nTurkey would not consent to either, that then she should have been\r\nallowed to enter into the war alone, and England and France--supposing\r\nthey had taken, and continued to take, the same view of the interests of\r\nWestern Europe which they have hitherto taken--might have stood aloof\r\nuntil the time when there appeared some evident danger of the war being\r\nsettled on terms destructive of the balance of power; and then they\r\nmight have come in, and have insisted on a different settlement. I would\r\neither have allowed or compelled Turkey to yield, or would have insisted\r\non her carrying on the war alone.\r\n\r\nThe question is, whether the advantages both to Turkey and England of\r\navoiding war altogether, would have been less than those which are\r\nlikely to arise from the policy which the Government has pursued? Now,\r\nif the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton is right in saying that Turkey\r\nis a growing Power, and that she has elements of strength which\r\nunlearned persons like myself know nothing about; surely no immediate,\r\nor sensible, or permanent mischief could have arisen to her from the\r\nacceptance of the Vienna note, which all the distinguished persons who\r\nagreed to it have declared to be perfectly consistent with her honour\r\nand independence. If she has been growing stronger and stronger of late\r\nyears, surely she would have grown still stronger in the future, and\r\nthere might have been a reasonable expectation that, whatever\r\ndisadvantages she might have suffered for a time from that note, her\r\ngrowing strength would have enabled her to overcome them, while the\r\npeace of Europe might have been preserved. But suppose that Turkey is\r\nnot a growing Power, but that the Ottoman rule in Europe is tottering to\r\nits fall, I come to the conclusion that, whatever advantages were\r\nafforded to the Christian population of Turkey would have enabled them\r\nto grow more rapidly in numbers, in industry, in wealth, in\r\nintelligence, and in political power; and that, as they thus increased\r\nin influence, they would have become more able, in case any accident,\r\nwhich might not be far distant, occurred, to supplant the Mahomedan\r\nrule, and to establish themselves in Constantinople as a Christian\r\nState, which, I think, every man who hears me will admit is infinitely\r\nmore to be desired than that the Mahomedan power should be permanently\r\nsustained by the bayonets of France and the fleets of England. Europe\r\nwould thus have been at peace; for I do not think even the most bitter\r\nenemies of Russia believe that the Emperor of Russia intended last year,\r\nif the Vienna note or Prince Menchikoff's last and most moderate\r\nproposition had been accepted, to have marched on Constantinople.\r\nIndeed, he had pledged himself in the most distinct manner to withdraw\r\nhis troops at once from the Principalities, if the Vienna note were\r\naccepted; and therefore in that case Turkey would have been delivered\r\nfrom the presence of the foe; peace would for a time have been secured\r\nto Europe; and the whole matter would have drifted on to its natural\r\nsolution--which is, that the Mahomedan power in Europe should eventually\r\nsuccumb to the growing power of the Christian population of the Turkish\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord the Member for London, and his colleague the noble Lord\r\nthe Member for Tiverton, when they speak of the aggrandisement of Russia\r\nrelatively to the rest of Europe, always speak of the 'balance of power'\r\na term which it is not easy to define. It is a hackneyed term--a phrase\r\nto which it is difficult to attach any definite meaning. I wish the\r\nnoble Lord would explain what is meant by the balance of power. In 1791,\r\nthe whole Whig party repudiated the proposition that Turkey had anything\r\nto do with the balance of power. Mr. Burke, in 1791, when speaking on\r\nthat subject, used the following language:--\r\n\r\n  'He had never heard it said before, that the Turkish Empire was\r\n  ever considered as any part of the balance of power in Europe.\r\n  They had nothing to do with European policy; they considered\r\n  themselves as wholly Asiatic. What had these worse than savages\r\n  to do with the Powers of Europe, but to spread war, destruction,\r\n  and pestilence among them? The Ministry and the policy which\r\n  would give these people any weight in Europe, would deserve all\r\n  the bans and curses of posterity. All that was holy in religion,\r\n  all that was moral and humane, demanded an abhorrence of\r\n  everything which tended to extend the power of that cruel and\r\n  wasteful Empire. Any Christian Power was to be preferred to these\r\n  destructive savages.'\r\n\r\nMr. Whitbread, on the same occasion, said:--\r\n\r\n  'Suppose the Empress at Constantinople, and the Turks expelled\r\n  from the European provinces, would any unprejudiced man contend\r\n  that by such an event mankind would not be largely benefited?\r\n  Would any man contend that the expulsion of a race of beings\r\n  whose abominable tyranny proscribed the arts, and literature, and\r\n  everything that was good, and great, and amiable, would not\r\n  conduce to the prosperity and happiness of the world? He was\r\n  convinced it would. This was an event with which the paltry\r\n  consideration of the nice adjustment of the balance in Europe was\r\n  not to be put in competition, although he was a friend to that\r\n  balance on broad and liberal principles. He abhorred the wretched\r\n  policy which could entertain a wish that the most luxuriant part\r\n  of the earth should remain desolate and miserable that a\r\n  particular system might be maintained.'\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Fox, when speaking of Mr. Pitt's system, said--and be it\r\nremembered that nobody is so great an authority with the noble Lord the\r\nMember for London as Mr. Fox, whose words I am now about to quote:--\r\n\r\n  'His (Mr. Pitt's) defensive system was wicked and absurd--that\r\n  every country which appeared, from whatever cause, to be growing\r\n  great, should be attacked; that all the Powers of Europe should\r\n  be confined to the same precise situation in which this defensive\r\n  system found them.... Her (Russia's) extent of territory, scanty\r\n  revenue, and thin population made her power by no means\r\n  formidable to us--a Power whom we could neither attack nor be\r\n  attacked by; and this was the Power against which we were going\r\n  to war. Overturning the Ottoman Empire he conceived to be an\r\n  argument of no weight. The event was not probable; and if it\r\n  should happen, it was more likely to be of advantage than\r\n  injurious to us.'\r\n\r\nIt will probably be said, that these were opinions held by Gentlemen who\r\nsat on that side of the House, and who were ready to advocate any course\r\nthat might serve to damage the Ministers of the day. I should be sorry\r\nto think so, especially of a man whose public character is so much to be\r\nadmired as that of Mr. Fox; but I will come to a much later period, and\r\nproduce authority of a very similar kind. Many hon. Members now in the\r\nHouse recollect the late Lord Holland, and they all know his sagacity\r\nand what his authority was with the party with which he was connected.\r\nWhat did he say? Why, so late as the year 1828, when this question was\r\nmooted in the House of Lords, he said:--\r\n\r\n  'No, my Lords, I hope I shall never see--God forbid I ever should\r\n  see--for the proposition would be scouted from one end of England\r\n  to another any preparations or any attempt to defend this our\r\n  \"ancient ally\" from the attacks of its enemies. There was no\r\n  arrangement made in that treaty for preserving the crumbling and\r\n  hateful, or, as Mr. Burke called it, that wasteful and disgusting\r\n  Empire of the Turks, from dismemberment and destruction; and none\r\n  of the Powers who were parties to that treaty will ever, I hope,\r\n  save the falling Empire of Turkey from ruin.'\r\n\r\nI hope it will not be supposed that I am animated by any hostility to\r\nTurkey, in quoting sentiments and language such as this, for I have as\r\nmuch sympathy with what is just towards that country as any other man\r\ncan have; but the question is, not what is just to Turkey, but what is\r\njust to this country, and what this House, as the depositary of the\r\npower of this country, has a right to do with regard to this most\r\ndangerous question. I am, therefore, at liberty to quote from the\r\nstatesmen of 1791 and 1828, the political fathers and authorities of the\r\nnoble Lord the Member for London, and to say, that if I hold opinions\r\ndifferent from those held by the Government, I am, at least, not\r\nsingular in those opinions, for I can quote great names and high\r\nauthorities in support of the course I am taking.\r\n\r\nThis 'balance of power' is in reality the hinge on which the whole\r\nquestion turns. But if that is so important as to be worth a sanguinary\r\nwar, why did you not go to war with France when she seized upon Algiers?\r\nThat was a portion of Turkey not quite so distinct, it is true, as are\r\nthe Danubian Principalities; but still Turkey had sovereign rights over\r\nAlgiers. When, therefore, France seized on a large portion of the\r\nnorthern coast of Africa, might it not have been said that such an act\r\ntended to convert the Mediterranean into a French lake,--that Algiers\r\nlay next to Tunis, and that, having conquered Tunis, there would remain\r\nonly Tripoli between France and Alexandria, and that the 'balance of\r\npower' was being destroyed by the aggrandisement of France? All this\r\nmight have been said, and the Government might easily have plunged the\r\ncountry into war on that question. But happily the Government of that\r\nday had the good sense not to resist, and the result had not been\r\ndisadvantageous to Europe; this country had not suffered from the\r\nseizure of Algiers, and England and France had continued at peace.\r\n\r\nTake another case--the case of the United States. The United States\r\nwaged war with Mexico--a war with a weaker State--in my opinion, an\r\nunjust and unnecessary war. If I had been a citizen of the American\r\nRepublic, I should have condemned that war; but might it not have been\r\nas justly argued that, if we allowed the aggressive attacks of the\r\nUnited States upon Mexico, her insatiable appetite would soon be turned\r\ntowards the north--towards the dependencies of this Empire--and that the\r\nmagnificent colonies of the Canadas would soon fall a prey to the\r\nassaults of their rapacious neighbour? But such arguments were not used,\r\nand it was not thought necessary to involve this country in a war for\r\nthe support of Mexico, although the Power that was attacking that\r\ncountry lay adjacent to our own dominions.\r\n\r\nIf this phrase of the 'balance of power' is to be always an argument for\r\nwar, the pretence for war will never be wanting, and peace can never be\r\nsecure. Let any one compare the power of this country with that of\r\nAustria now, and forty years ago. Will any one say that England,\r\ncompared with Austria, is now three times as powerful as she was thirty\r\nor forty years ago? Austria has a divided people, bankrupt finances, and\r\nher credit is so low that she cannot borrow a shilling out of her own\r\nterritories; England has a united people, national wealth rapidly\r\nincreasing, and a mechanical and productive power to which that of\r\nAustria is as nothing. Might not Austria complain that we have disturbed\r\nthe 'balance of power' because we are growing so much stronger from\r\nbetter government, from the greater union of our people, from the wealth\r\nthat is created by the hard labour and skill of our population, and from\r\nthe wonderful development of the mechanical resources of the kingdom,\r\nwhich is seen on every side? If this phrase of the 'balance of power'\r\nthe meaning of which nobody can exactly make out, is to be brought in on\r\nevery occasion to stimulate this country to war, there is an end to all\r\nhope of permanent peace.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, a question of a 'balance of power' which this country\r\nmight regard, if our statesmen had a little less of those narrow views\r\nwhich they sometimes arrogantly impute to me and to those who think with\r\nme. If they could get beyond those old notions which belong to the\r\ntraditions of Europe, and cast their eyes as far westward as they are\r\nnow looking eastward, they might there see a power growing up in its\r\ngigantic proportions, which will teach us before very long where the\r\ntrue 'balance of power' is to be found. This struggle may indeed begin\r\nwith Russia, but it may end with half the States of Europe; for Austria\r\nand Prussia are just as likely to join with Russia as with England and\r\nFrance, and probably much more so; and we know not how long alliances\r\nwhich now appear very secure, may remain so; for the circumstances in\r\nwhich the Government has involved us are of the most critical character,\r\nand we stand upon a mine which may explode any day. Give us seven years\r\nof this infatuated struggle upon which we are now entering, and let the\r\nUnited States remain at peace during that period, and who shall say what\r\nwill then be the relative positions of the two nations? Have you read\r\nthe Reports of your own Commissioners to the New York Exhibition? Do you\r\ncomprehend what is the progress of that country, as exhibited in its\r\ntonnage, and exports, and imports, and manufactures, and in the\r\ndevelopment of all its resources, and the means of transit? There has\r\nbeen nothing like it hitherto under the sun. The United States may\r\nprofit to a large extent by the calamities which will befall us; whilst\r\nwe, under the miserable and lunatic idea that we are about to set the\r\nworn-out Turkish Empire on its legs, and permanently to sustain it\r\nagainst the aggressions of Russia, are entangled in a war. Our trade\r\nwill decay and diminish--our people, suffering and discontented, as in\r\nall former periods of war, will emigrate in increasing numbers to a\r\ncountry whose wise policy is to keep itself free from the entanglement\r\nof European politics--to a country with which rests the great question,\r\nwhether England shall, for any long time, retain that which she\r\nprofesses to value so highly--her great superiority in industry and at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThis whole notion of the 'balance of power' is a mischievous delusion\r\nwhich has come down to us from past times; we ought to drive it from our\r\nminds, and to consider the solemn question of peace or war on more\r\nclear, more definite, and on far higher principles than any that are\r\ninvolved in the phrase the 'balance of power.' What is it the Government\r\npropose to do? Let us examine their policy as described in the message\r\nfrom the Crown, and in the Address which has been moved to-night. As I\r\nunderstand it, we are asked to go to war to maintain the 'integrity and\r\nindependence of the Ottoman Empire'--to curb the aggressive power of\r\nRussia--and to defend the interests of this country.\r\n\r\nThese are the three great objects to which the efforts and resources of\r\nthis country are to be directed. The noble Lord the Member for London\r\nis, I think, the author of the phrase 'the integrity and independence'\r\nof Turkey. If I am not mistaken, he pledged himself to this more than a\r\nyear ago, when he was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a\r\nletter to somebody at Newcastle-on-Tyne, in answer to an Address from\r\ncertain enthusiasts in that town, who exhorted the Government to step in\r\nfor the support of the Ottoman Empire. But what is the condition of that\r\nEmpire at this moment? I have already described to the House what it\r\nwould have been if my policy had been adopted--if the thrice-modified\r\nnote of Prince Menchikoff had been accepted, or if the Vienna note had\r\nbeen assented to by the Porte. But what is it now under the protection\r\nof the noble Lord and his Colleagues? At the present moment there are no\r\nless than three foreign armies on Turkish soil: there are 100,000\r\nRussian troops in Bulgaria; there are armies from England and France\r\napproaching the Dardanelles, to entrench themselves on Turkish\r\nterritory, and to return nobody knows when. All this can hardly\r\ncontribute to the 'independence' of any country. But more than this:\r\nthere are insurrections springing up in almost every Turkish province,\r\nand insurrections which must, from the nature of the Turkish Government,\r\nwidely extend; and it is impossible to describe the anarchy which must\r\nprevail, inasmuch as the control heretofore exercised by the Government\r\nto keep the peace is now gone, by the withdrawal of its troops to the\r\nbanks of the Danube; and the licence and demoralization engendered by\r\nages of bad government will be altogether unchecked. In addition to\r\nthese complicated horrors, there are 200,000 men under arms; the state\r\nof their finances is already past recovery; and the allies of Turkey are\r\nmaking demands upon her far beyond anything that was required by Russia\r\nherself. Can anything be more destructive of the 'integrity and\r\nindependence' of Turkey than the policy of the noble Lord?\r\n\r\nI have seen only this day a letter in the Times from its Correspondent\r\nat Constantinople, which states that Lord Stratford de Redcliffe and one\r\nof the Pashas of the Porte had spent a whole night in the attempt to\r\narrange concessions which her allies had required on behalf of the\r\nChristian population of Turkey. The Christians are to be allowed to hold\r\nlanded property; the capitation tax is to be abolished--for they are\r\nactually contending for the abolition of that which the hon. Member for\r\nAylesbury (Mr. Layard) says is a positive benefit to those upon whom it\r\nis imposed; and the evidence of Christians is to be admitted into courts\r\nof justice. But the _Times_' Correspondent asks, what is the use of\r\na decree at Constantinople, which will have no effect in the provinces?--\r\nfor the judges are Turks of the old school, and they will have little\r\nsympathy with a change under which a Christian in a court of justice is\r\nmade equal with his master the Turk. This Correspondent describes what\r\nTurkey really wants--not three foreign armies on her soil, nor any other\r\nthing which our Government is about to give her, but 'a pure executive,\r\na better financial administration, and sensible laws;' and it must be\r\nadmitted that the true wants of the country are not likely soon to be\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nNow, so far as regards Turkey herself, and the 'integrity and\r\nindependence' of that Empire, I put it seriously to the House--do you\r\nbelieve, that if the Government and Lord Stratford de Redcliffe had\r\nadvised Turkey to accept the last note of Prince Menchikoff, a note so\r\nlittle different from the others, offered before and since, that it was\r\nimpossible to discover in what the distinction consisted; or if the\r\nGovernment had insisted on Turkey accepting, as the condition of their\r\nco-operation, the Vienna note, either as at first proposed by the\r\nConference, or with the explanatory definitions with which the Emperor\r\nof Russia at Olmutz offered to accept it, that they would have injured\r\nthe 'integrity and independence' of Turkey? Nay, I will not insult you\r\nby asking whether, under such circumstances, that 'integrity and\r\nindependence' would not have been a thousand times more secure than it\r\nis at this hour? If that be true, then the 'balance of power' theory has\r\nbeen entirely overthrown by the policy of the Government, for no one\r\nwill argue that Turkey will come out of her present difficulties more\r\nable to cope with the power of Russia than she was before. With her\r\nfinances hopelessly exhausted, will she ever again be able to raise an\r\narmy of 200,000 men? But there are men, and I suspect there are\r\nstatesmen, in this country, and men in office, too, who believe that\r\nTurkey will not be Turkey at the end of this war--that she cannot come\r\nout of it an Ottoman Power--that such a convulsion has been created,\r\nthat while we are ready to contend with half the world to support the\r\n'integrity and independence' of the Ottoman Empire, there will shortly\r\nbe no Ottoman Empire to take the benefit of the enormous sacrifices we\r\nare about to make.\r\n\r\nBut we are undertaking to repress and to curb Russian aggression. These\r\nare catching words; they have been amplified in newspapers, and have\r\npassed from mouth to mouth, and have served to blind the eyes of\r\nmultitudes wholly ignorant of the details of this question. If Turkey\r\nhas been in danger from the side of Russia heretofore, will she not be\r\nin far greater danger when the war is over? Russia is always there. You\r\ndo not propose to dismember Russia, or to blot out her name from the\r\nmap, and her history from the records of Europe. Russia will be always\r\nthere--always powerful, always watchful, and actuated by the same\r\nmotives of ambition, either of influence or of territory, which are\r\nsupposed to have moved her in past times. What, then, do you propose to\r\ndo? and how is Turkey to be secured? Will you make a treaty with Russia,\r\nand force conditions upon her? But if so, what security have you that\r\none treaty will be more binding than another? It is easy to find or make\r\na reason for breaking a treaty, when it is the interest of a country to\r\nbreak it.\r\n\r\nI recollect reading a statement made by the illustrious Washington, when\r\nit was proposed to land a French army in North America, to assist the\r\ncolonies in overthrowing the yoke of this country. Washington was afraid\r\nof them--he did not know whether these allies once landed might not be\r\nas difficult to get rid of as the English troops he was endeavouring to\r\nexpel; for, said he, 'whatever may be the convention entered into, my\r\nexperience teaches me that nations and Governments rarely abide by\r\nconventions or treaties longer than it is their interest to do so.' So\r\nyou may make a treaty with Russia; but if Russia is still powerful and\r\nambitious--as she certainly will be--and if Turkey is exhausted and\r\nenfeebled by the war--as she certainly will be--then I want to know what\r\nguarantee you have, the moment the resources of Russia have recovered\r\nfrom the utmost degree of humiliation and exhaustion to which you may\r\nsucceed in reducing her, that she will not again insist on terms with\r\nTurkey infinitely more perilous than those you have ruined Turkey by\r\nurging her to refuse? It is a delusion to suppose you can dismember\r\nRussia--that you can blot her from the map of Europe--that you can take\r\nguarantees from her, as some seem to imagine, as easily as you take bail\r\nfrom an offender, who would otherwise go to prison for three months.\r\nEngland and France cannot do this with a stroke of the pen, and the\r\nsword will equally fail if the attempt be made.\r\n\r\nBut I come now to another point. How are the interests of England\r\ninvolved in this question? This is, after all, the great matter which\r\nwe, the representatives of the people of England, have to consider. It\r\nis not a question of sympathy with any other State. I have sympathy with\r\nTurkey; I have sympathy with the serfs of Russia; I have sympathy with\r\nthe people of Hungary, whose envoy the noble Lord the Member for\r\nTiverton refused to see, and the overthrow of whose struggle for freedom\r\nby the armies of Russia he needlessly justified in this House; I have\r\nsympathy with the Italians, subjects of Austria, Naples, and the Pope; I\r\nhave sympathy with the three millions of slaves in the United States;\r\nbut it is not on a question of sympathy that I dare involve this\r\ncountry, or any country, in a war which must cost an incalculable amount\r\nof treasure and of blood. It is not my duty to make this country the\r\nknight-errant of the human race, and to take upon herself the protection\r\nof the thousand millions of human beings who have been permitted by the\r\nCreator of all things to people this planet.\r\n\r\nI hope no one will assume that I would invite--that is the phrase which\r\nhas been used--the aggressions of Russia. If I were a Russian, speaking\r\nin a Russian Parliament, I should denounce any aggression upon Turkey,\r\nas I now blame the policy of our own Government; and I greatly fear I\r\nshould find myself in a minority, as I now find myself in a minority on\r\nthis question. But it has never yet been explained how the interests of\r\nthis country are involved in the present dispute. We are not going to\r\nfight for tariffs, or for markets for our exports. In 1791, Mr. Grey\r\nargued that, as our imports from Russia exceeded 1,000,000_l_.\r\nsterling, it was not desirable that we should go to war with a country\r\ntrading with us to that amount. In 1853, Russia exported to this country\r\nat least 14,000,000_l_. sterling, and that fact affords no proof of\r\nthe increasing barbarism of Russia, or of any disregard of her own\r\ninterests as respects the development of her resources. What has passed\r\nin this House since the opening of the present session? We had a large\r\nsurplus revenue, and our Chancellor of the Exchequer is an ambitious\r\nChancellor. I have no hope in any statesman who has no ambition; he can\r\nhave no great object before him, and his career will be unmarked by any\r\ndistinguished services to his country.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chancellor of the Exchequer entered office, doubtless he hoped,\r\nby great services to his country, to build up a reputation such as a man\r\nmay labour for and live for. Every man in this House, even those most\r\nopposed to him, acknowledged the remarkable capacity which he displayed\r\nduring the last session, and the country has set its seal to this--that\r\nhis financial measures, in the remission and readjustment of taxation,\r\nwere worthy of the approbation of the great body of the people. The\r\nright hon. Gentleman has been blamed for his speech at Manchester, not\r\nfor making the speech, but because it differed from the tone of the\r\nspeech made by the noble Lord, his colleague in office, at Greenock. I\r\nobserved that difference. There can be no doubt that there has been, and\r\nthat there is now, a great difference of opinion in the Cabinet on this\r\nEastern question. It could not be otherwise; and Government has gone on\r\nfrom one step to another; they have drifted--to use the happy expression\r\nof Lord Clarendon to describe what is so truly unhappy--they have\r\ndrifted from a state of peace to a state of war; and to no Member of the\r\nGovernment could this state of things be more distressing than to the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, for it dashed from him the hopes he\r\nentertained that session after session, as trade extended and the public\r\nrevenue increased, he would find himself the beneficent dispenser of\r\nblessings to the poor, and indeed to all classes of the people of this\r\nkingdom. Where is the surplus now? No man dare even ask for it, or for\r\nany portion of it.\r\n\r\nHere is my right hon. Friend and Colleague, who is resolved on the\r\nabolition of the newspaper stamp. I can hardly imagine a more important\r\nquestion than that, if it be desirable for the people to be instructed\r\nin their social and political obligations; and yet my right hon. Friend\r\nhas scarcely the courage to ask for the abolition of that odious tax. I\r\nbelieve, indeed, that my right hon. Friend has a plan to submit to the\r\nChancellor by which the abolition of the stamp may be accomplished\r\nwithout sacrifice to the Exchequer, but that I will not go into at\r\npresent. But this year's surplus is gone, and next year's surplus is\r\ngone with it; and you have already passed a Bill to double the income-\r\ntax. And it is a mistake to suppose that you will obtain double the sum\r\nby simply doubling the tax. Many persons make an average of their\r\nincomes, and make a return accordingly. The average will not be\r\nsustained at the bidding of Parliament; and profits that were\r\nconsiderable last year, will henceforth show a great diminution, or will\r\nhave vanished altogether. I mention this for the benefit of the country\r\ngentlemen, because it is plain that real property, lands and houses,\r\nmust bear the burden of this war; for I will undertake to say, that the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer will prefer to leave that bench, and will\r\ntake his seat in some other quarter of the House, rather than retrace\r\nthe steps which Sir Robert Peel took in 1842. He is not the promoter of\r\nthis war; his speeches have shown that he is anxious for peace, and that\r\nhe hoped to be a Minister who might dispense blessings by the remission\r\nof taxes to the people; and I do not believe the right hon. Gentleman\r\nwill consent to be made the instrument to reimpose upon the country the\r\nExcise duties which have been repealed, or the Import duties which in\r\npast times inflicted such enormous injury upon trade. The property-tax\r\nis the lever, or the weapon, with which the proprietors of lands and\r\nhouses in this kingdom will have to support the 'integrity and\r\nindependence' of the Ottoman Empire. Gentlemen, I congratulate you, that\r\nevery man of you has a Turk upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Layard) spoke of our 'triumphant\r\nposition'--the position in which the Government has placed us by\r\npledging this country to support the Turks. I see nothing like a triumph\r\nin the fact, that in addition to our many duties to our own country, we\r\nhave accepted the defence of twenty millions or more of the people of\r\nTurkey, on whose behalf, but, I believe, not for their benefit, we are\r\nabout to sacrifice the blood and treasure of England. But there are\r\nother penalties and other considerations. I will say little about the\r\nReform Bill, because, as the noble Lord (Lord John Russell) is aware, I\r\ndo not regard it as an unmixed blessing. But I think even hon. Gentlemen\r\nopposite will admit that it would be well if the representation of the\r\npeople in this House were in a more satisfactory state, and that it is\r\nunfortunate that we are not permitted, calmly and with mutual good\r\nfeeling, to consider the question, undisturbed by the thunder of\r\nartillery and undismayed by the disasters which are inseparable from a\r\nstate of war.\r\n\r\nWith regard to trade, I can speak with some authority as to the state of\r\nthings in Lancashire. The Russian trade is not only at an end, but it is\r\nmade an offence against the law to deal with any of our customers in\r\nRussia. The German trade is most injuriously affected by the uncertainty\r\nwhich prevails on the continent of Europe. The Levant trade, a very\r\nimportant branch, is almost extinguished in the present state of affairs\r\nin Greece, Turkey in Europe, and Syria. All property in trade is\r\ndiminishing in value, whilst its burdens are increasing. The funds have\r\nfallen in value to the amount of about 120,000,000_l_. sterling,\r\nand railway property is quoted at about 80,000,000_l_. less than\r\nwas the case a year ago. I do not pretend to ask the hon. Member for\r\nAylesbury (Mr. Layard) to put these losses, these great destructions of\r\nproperty, against the satisfaction he feels at the 'triumphant position'\r\nat which we have arrived. He may content himself with the dream that we\r\nare supporting the 'integrity and independence' of Turkey, though I\r\ndoubt whether bringing three foreign armies on her soil, raising\r\ninsurrections in her provinces, and hopelessly exhausting her finances,\r\nis a rational mode of maintaining her as an independent Power.\r\n\r\nBut we are sending out 30,000 troops to Turkey, and in that number are\r\nnot included the men serving on board the fleets. Here are 30,000 lives!\r\nThere is a thrill of horror sometimes when a single life is lost, and we\r\nsigh at the loss of a friend, or of a casual acquaintance! But here we\r\nare in danger of losing--and I give the opinions of military men and not\r\nmy own merely--10,000, or it may be 20,000 lives, that may be sacrificed\r\nin this struggle. I have never pretended to any sympathy for the\r\nmilitary profession--but I have sympathy for my fellow-men and fellow-\r\ncountrymen, where-ever they may be. I have heard very melancholy\r\naccounts of the scenes which have been witnessed in the separations from\r\nfamilies occasioned by this expedition to the East. But it will be said,\r\nand probably the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton will say, that it is\r\na just war, a glorious war, and that I am full of morbid sentimentality,\r\nand have introduced topics not worthy to be mentioned in Parliament. But\r\nthese are matters affecting the happiness of the homes of England, and\r\nwe, who are the representatives and guardians of those homes, when the\r\ngrand question of war is before us, should know at least that we have a\r\ncase--that success is probable--and that an object is attainable, which\r\nmay be commensurate with the cost of war.\r\n\r\nThere is another point which gives me some anxiety. You are boasting of\r\nan alliance with France. Alliances are dangerous things. It is an\r\nalliance with Turkey that has drawn us into this war. I would not advise\r\nalliances with any nation, but I would cultivate friendship with all\r\nnations. I would have no alliance that might drag us into measures which\r\nit is neither our duty nor our interest to undertake. By our present\r\nalliance with Turkey, Turkey cannot make peace without the consent of\r\nEngland and France; and by this boasted alliance with France we may find\r\nourselves involved in great difficulties at some future period of these\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to look at the whole of this question, and I declare,\r\nafter studying the correspondence which has been laid on the table--\r\nknowing what I know of Russia and of Turkey--seeing what I see of\r\nAustria and of Prussia--feeling the enormous perils to which this\r\ncountry is now exposed, I am amazed at the course which the Government\r\nhave pursued, and I am horrified at the results to which their policy\r\nmust inevitably tend. I do not say this in any spirit of hostility to\r\nthe Government. I have never been hostile to them. I have once or twice\r\nfelt it my duty to speak, with some degree of sharpness, of particular\r\nMembers of the Administration, but I suspect that in private they would\r\nadmit that my censure was merited. But I have never entertained a party\r\nhostility to the Government. I know something of the difficulties they\r\nhave had to encounter, and I have no doubt that, in taking office, they\r\nacted in as patriotic a spirit as is generally expected from Members of\r\nthis House. So long as their course was one which I could support, or\r\neven excuse, they have had my support. But this is not an ordinary\r\nquestion; it is not a question of reforming the University of Oxford, or\r\nof abolishing 'ministers' money' in Ireland; the matter now before us\r\naffects the character, the policy, and the vital interests of the\r\nEmpire; and when I think the Government have committed a grievous--it\r\nmay be a fatal error--I am bound to tell them so.\r\n\r\nI am told indeed that the war is popular, and that it is foolish and\r\neccentric to oppose it. I doubt if the war is very popular in this\r\nHouse. But as to what is, or has been popular, I may ask, what was more\r\npopular than the American war? There were persons lately living in\r\nManchester who had seen the recruiting party going through the principal\r\nstreets of that city, accompanied by the parochial clergy in full\r\ncanonicals, exhorting the people to enlist to put down the rebels in the\r\nAmerican colonies. Where is now the popularity of that disastrous and\r\ndisgraceful war, and who is the man to defend it? But if hon. Members\r\nwill turn to the correspondence between George III and Lord North, on\r\nthe subject of that war, they will find that the King's chief argument\r\nfor continuing the war was, that it would be dishonourable in him to\r\nmake peace so long as the war was popular with the people. Again, what\r\nwar could be more popular than the French war? Has not the noble Lord\r\n(Lord John Russell) said, not long ago, in this House, that peace was\r\nrendered difficult if not impossible by the conduct of the English press\r\nin 1803? For myself, I do not trouble myself whether my conduct in\r\nParliament is popular or not. I care only that it shall be wise and just\r\nas regards the permanent interests of my country, and I despise from the\r\nbottom of my heart the man who speaks a word in favour of this war, or\r\nof any war which he believes might have been avoided, merely because the\r\npress and a portion of the people urge the Government to enter into it.\r\n\r\nI recollect a passage of a distinguished French writer and statesman\r\nwhich bears strongly upon our present position: he says,--\r\n\r\n  'The country which can comprehend and act upon the lessons which\r\n  God has given it in the past events of its history, is secure in\r\n  the most imminent crises of its fate.'\r\n\r\nThe past events of our history have taught me that the intervention of\r\nthis country in European wars is not only unnecessary, but calamitous;\r\nthat we have rarely come out of such intervention having succeeded in\r\nthe objects we fought for; that a debt of 800,000,000_l_. sterling\r\nhas been incurred by the policy which the noble Lord approves,\r\napparently for no other reason than that it dates from the time of\r\nWilliam III; and that, not debt alone has been incurred, but that we\r\nhave left Europe at least as much in chains as before a single effort\r\nwas made by us to rescue her from tyranny. I believe, if this country,\r\nseventy years ago, had adopted the principle of nonintervention in every\r\ncase where her interests were not directly and obviously assailed, that\r\nshe would have been saved from much of the pauperism and brutal crimes\r\nby which our Government and people have alike been disgraced. This\r\ncountry might have been a garden, every dwelling might have been of\r\nmarble, and every person who treads its soil might have been\r\nsufficiently educated. We should indeed have had less of military glory.\r\nWe might have had neither Trafalgar nor Waterloo; but we should have set\r\nthe high example of a Christian nation, free in its institutions,\r\ncourteous and just in its conduct towards all foreign States, and\r\nresting its policy on the unchangeable foundation of Christian morality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nENLISTMENT OF FOREIGNERS BILL.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, DECEMBER 22, 1854.\r\n_From Hansard._\r\nAt this hour of the night I shall not make a speech; but I wish to say a\r\nfew things in answer to the noble Lord the Member for the City of\r\nLondon, who has very strangely misapprehended--I am not allowed to say\r\n'misrepresented'--what fell from my hon. Friend the Member for the West\r\nRiding. The noble Lord began by saying that my hon. Friend had charged\r\nthe Government with making war in something of a propagandist spirit in\r\nfavour of nationalities throughout the Continent; but that was the exact\r\ncontrary of what my hon. Friend did say. What he said was, that that\r\nportion of the people of this country who had clamoured for war, and\r\nwhose opinion formed the basis whereupon the Government grounded their\r\nplea for the popularity of the war, were in favour of the setting up of\r\nnationalities; but my hon. Friend showed that the Government had no such\r\nobject, and the war no such tendency. The next misrepresentation was,\r\nthat my hon. Friend had spoken in favour of the _status quo_; but\r\nthere is not the shadow of a shade of truth in that statement. What my\r\nhon. Friend said was precisely the contrary; but the noble Lord, arguing\r\nfrom his own misapprehension of my hon. Friend's meaning, went on then\r\nto show that it would not do to establish a peace on the _status\r\nquo_ terms, thus knocking down a position which nobody had set up.\r\nThe noble Lord was also guilty of another mistake with reference to an\r\nobservation of my hon. Friend as to the character and position of the\r\nTurks. We have referred over and over again to a monstrous statement\r\nmade by the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton as to the improvement of\r\nthe Turks--a statement which is contradicted by all facts. Tonight, with\r\na disingenuousness which I should be ashamed to use in argument--[Cries\r\nof 'Oh!']--it is very well for hon. Gentlemen who come down to cheer a\r\nMinister to cry 'Oh!' but is it a fact, or is it not? Is there a man who\r\nhears me who does not know perfectly well, when the noble Lord said that\r\nthe Turks had improved within the last twenty years more than any other\r\nnation in Europe, that the statement referred not to the Christians,\r\nwhose rights and interests we were defending, but to the character of\r\nthe Mahometan population? But to-night, with a disingenuousness which I\r\ncould not condescend to be guilty of, the noble Lord has assumed that\r\nthe statement referred to the condition of the Christian population.\r\n\r\nThe real question was, as every hon. Gentleman knows, What was the\r\ncondition of the Mahometan? and there is not a Gentleman in this House\r\nwho is not aware that the Mahometan portion of the population of the\r\nTurkish Empire is in a decaying and dying condition, and that the two\r\ngreat Empires which have undertaken to set it on its legs again will\r\nfind it about the most difficult task in which they ever were engaged.\r\nWhat do your own officers say? Here is an extract from a letter which\r\nappeared in the papers the other day:--\r\n\r\n  They ought to set these rascally Turks to mend them [the roads],\r\n  which might easily be done, as under the clay there is plenty of\r\n  capital stone. They are, I am sorry to say, bringing more of\r\n  these brutes into the Crimea, which makes more mouths to feed,\r\n  without being of any use.\r\n\r\nI have seen a private letter, too, from an able and distinguished\r\nofficer in the Crimea, who says--\r\n\r\n  'Half of us do not know what we are fighting for, and the other\r\n  half only pray that we may not be fighting for the Turks.'\r\n\r\nThe only sign of improvement which has been manifested that I know of\r\nis, that on a great emergency, when their Empire, under the advice of\r\nHer Majesty's Government, and that of their Ambassador, was placed in a\r\nsituation of great peril, the Turks managed to make an expiring effort,\r\nand to get up an army which the Government, so far as I can hear, has\r\nsince permitted to be almost destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of improvement is, perhaps, that they have begun to wear\r\ntrowsers; but as to their commerce, their industry, or their revenue,\r\nnothing can be in a worse condition. You have now two Empires attempting\r\nto set the Turkish Empire up again; and it is said that a third great\r\nEmpire is also about to engage in the task. The Turk wants to borrow\r\nmoney, but he cannot borrow it to-day in the London market at less than\r\nfrom eight to nine per cent. Russia, on the other hand, is an Empire\r\nagainst which three great Empires, if Turkey can be counted one still,\r\nare now combined, and it is said that a fourth great Empire will soon\r\njoin the ranks of its enemies. But Russian funds at this moment are very\r\nlittle lower than the stock of the London and North-Western Railway. You\r\nhave engaged to set this Turkish Empire up again--a task in which\r\neverybody knows you must fail--and you have persuaded the Turk to enter\r\ninto a contest, one of the very first proceedings in which has forced\r\nhim to mortgage to the English capitalist a very large portion--and the\r\nsecurest portion, too, of his revenues--namely, that which he derives\r\nfrom Egypt, amounting in fact, in a fiscal and financial point of view,\r\nto an actual dismemberment of the Turkish Empire, by a separation of\r\nEgypt from it. Why is it that the noble Lord has tonight come forward as\r\nthe defender of the Greeks? Is it that\r\n\r\nhe has discovered, when this war is over, that Turkey, which he has\r\nundertaken to protect, the Empire which he is to defend and sustain\r\nagainst the Emperor of Russia, will have been smothered under his\r\naffectionate embrace? or, to quote the powerful language of the\r\n_Times_, when the Vienna note was refused, that whatever else may\r\nbe the result of the war in which Turkey has plunged Europe, this one\r\nthing is certain, that at its conclusion there may be no Turkish Empire\r\nto talk about?\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord quoted a letter which I wrote some time ago, and which,\r\nlike others who have discussed it, he found it not easy to answer. In\r\nthat letter I referred to Don Pacifico's case; and I am sure that the\r\nnoble Lord the Member for Tiverton will remember a despatch which he\r\nreceived through Baron Brunnow, from Count Nesselrode, on that subject,--\r\na despatch which I think the House will forgive my reading to it on the\r\npresent occasion, as it gives the Russian Government's estimation of\r\nthat act of 'material guarantee' on the part of England:--\r\n\r\n  'It remains to be seen whether Great Britain, abusing the\r\n  advantages which are afforded her by her immense maritime\r\n  superiority, intends henceforth to pursue an isolated policy,\r\n  without caring for those engagements which bind her to the other\r\n  Cabinets; whether she intends to disengage herself from every\r\n  obligation, as well as from all community of action, and to\r\n  authorize all great Powers, on every fitting opportunity, to\r\n  recognize to the weak no other rule but their own will, no other\r\n  right but their own physical strength. Your Excellency will\r\n  please to read this despatch to Lord Palmerston, and to give him\r\n  a copy of it.'\r\n\r\nIf there had been no more temper--no more sense--no more unity in the\r\nnegotiations which took place with regard to this matter, in all\r\nprobability we might have had a war about it. It was a case in which\r\nRussia might have gone to war with this country, if she had been so\r\nminded. But Russia did not do that. Fortunately, the negotiations that\r\nensued settled that question without bringing that disaster upon Europe.\r\nBut the noble Lord again misinterpreted my hon. Friend (Mr. Cobden). I\r\nappeal to every Gentleman who heard my hon. Friend's speech whether the\r\ndrift of it was not this--that in this quarrel, Prussia, and certainly\r\nAustria, had a nearer and stronger interest than England, and that he\r\ncould not understand why the terms which Austria might consider fair and\r\nsafe for herself and for Turkey, might not be accepted with honour by\r\nthis country and by France? Now, I am prepared to show that, from the\r\nbeginning of this dispute, there is not a single thing which Austria\r\nwished to do in the course of the negotiations, or even which France\r\nwished to do, that the Government of the noble Lord did not\r\nsystematically refuse its assent to, and that the noble Lord's\r\nGovernment is alone responsible for the failure in every particular\r\npoint which took place in these negotiations. I will not trouble the\r\nHouse by going into the history of these negotiations now, further than\r\njust to state two facts, which will not take more than a few sentences.\r\nThe noble Lord referred to the note which Russia wanted Turkey to sign,\r\nknown as the Menchikoff note; but the noble Lord knows as well as I do,\r\nthat when the French Ambassador, M. De la Cour, went to Constantinople,\r\nor whilst he was at Constantinople, he received express instructions\r\nfrom the Emperor of the French not to take upon himself the\r\nresponsibility of inciting the Sultan to reject that note, ['No.'] I\r\nknow this is the fact, because it is stated in Lord Cowley's despatch to\r\nthe noble Lord.\r\n\r\nI am expressing no opinion on the propriety of what was here done; I\r\nsimply state the fact: and it was through the interference of Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe--acting, I presume, in accordance with\r\ninstructions from our Cabinet, and promising the intervention of the\r\nfleets--that the rejection of that note was secured. The next fact I\r\nhave to mention is this. When in September, last year, the last\r\npropositions were drawn up by Counts Buol and Nesselrode, and offered at\r\nOlmütz by the Emperor, as a final settlement of the question, although\r\nAustria and Prussia were in favour of those propositions; though Lord\r\nWestmoreland himself said (I do not quote his exact words, but their\r\nsubstance) that they were of such a nature as might be received; thus\r\nindicating his favourable opinion of them; and though, likewise, the\r\nEmperor of the French himself declared that they guarded all the points\r\nin which England and France were concerned (for this was stated by Count\r\nWalewski when he said that the Emperor was prepared to order his\r\nAmbassador at Constantinople to sign them along with the other\r\nAmbassadors, and to offer them to the Porte in exchange for the Vienna\r\nnote), nevertheless, the Earl of Clarendon wrote, not in a very\r\nstatesmanlike manner in such an emergency, but in almost a contemptuous\r\ntone, that our Government would not, upon any consideration, have\r\nanything further to do with the Vienna note. The rejection, first of the\r\namended Menchikoff note, and then of the Olmütz note, was a policy\r\nadopted solely by the Government of this country, and only concurred in,\r\nbut not recommended, by the French Government and the other Governments\r\nof Europe. Whether this policy was right or wrong, there can be no doubt\r\nof the fact; and I am prepared to stake my reputation for accuracy and\r\nfor a knowledge of the English language on this interpretation of the\r\ndocuments which have been laid before us. That being so, on what\r\npretence could we expect that Austria should go to war in company with\r\nus for objects far beyond what she thought satisfactory at the\r\nbeginning? or why should we ask the Emperor of the French to go to war\r\nfor objects which he did not contemplate, and to insist on conditions\r\nwhich, in the month of September of last year, he thought wholly\r\nunnecessary?\r\n\r\nBut one fact more I hope the House will allow me to state. There is a\r\ndespatch in existence which was never produced to the people of this\r\ncountry, but which made its first appearance in a St. Petersburg\r\nnewspaper, and was afterwards published in the Paris journals--a\r\ndespatch in which the Emperor of the French, or his Minister, urged the\r\nRussian Government to accept the Vienna note on the express ground--I\r\ngive the exact words--that 'its general sense differed in nothing from\r\nthe sense of the original propositions of Prince Menchikoff.' Why, Sir,\r\ncan there be dissimulation more extraordinary--can there be guilt more\r\nconclusive than that this Government should act as it did, after it had\r\nrecommended the Emperor of Russia to accept the Vienna note? For the\r\nnoble Lord has told us, over and over again, that the Government of\r\nEngland concurred in all the steps taken by the French Government. The\r\nHouse will allow me to read the very words of the despatch, for, after\r\nall, this is no very small matter. I have an English translation, but\r\nthe French original is underneath, and any hon. Gentleman who chooses\r\nmay see it. The despatch is from M. Drouyn de Lhuys, the French Foreign\r\nMinister, who states:--\r\n\r\n  'That which the Cabinet of St. Petersburg ought to desire is an\r\n  act of the Porte, which testifies that it has taken into serious\r\n  consideration the mission of Prince Menchikoff, and that it\r\n  renders homage to the sympathies which an identity of religion\r\n  inspires in the Emperor Nicholas for all Christians of the\r\n  Eastern rite.'\r\n\r\nAnd farther on:--\r\n\r\n  'They [the French Government] submit it to the Cabinet of St.\r\n  Petersburg with the hope that it will find that its general sense\r\n  differs in nothing from the sense of the proposition presented by\r\n  Prince Menchikoff.'\r\n\r\nThe French words are:--\r\n\r\n  'Que son sens général ne diffère en rien du sens du projet\r\n  présenté par M. le Prince Menchikoff.'\r\n\r\nIt then goes on:--\r\n\r\n  'And that it gives it satisfaction on all the essential points of\r\n  its demands. The slight variation in the form of it will not be\r\n  observed by the masses of the people, either in Russia or in\r\n  Turkey. To their eyes, the step taken by the Porte [that is, in\r\n  accepting it] will preserve all the signification which the\r\n  Cabinet of St. Petersburg wishes to give it; and His Majesty the\r\n  Emperor Nicholas will appear to them always as the powerful and\r\n  respected protector of their religious faith.'\r\n\r\nThis despatch was written, recommending _la note Française_; which\r\nis the basis of, and is in reality and substance the same thing with,\r\nthe Vienna note; but, up to this moment, neither the Government of\r\nFrance nor the Government of which the noble Lord is a Member has for an\r\ninstant denied the justice--I do not say the extent or degree--but the\r\njustice of the claim made on the part of the Russian Government against\r\nthe Turks; and now they turn round upon their own note and tell you that\r\nthere was a different construction put upon it. Was there any\r\nconstruction put upon it, which was different from the recommendation\r\nhere made and the argument used by the French Government? No; and the\r\nwhole of that statement is a statement that is delusive, and if I were\r\nnot in this House I would characterize it by a harsher epithet. I say\r\nnow what I stated in March last, and what I have since said and written\r\nto the country, that you are making war against the Government which\r\naccepted your own terms of peace; and I state this now only for the\r\npurpose of urging upon the House and upon the Government that you are\r\nbound at least, after making war for many months, to exact no further\r\nterms from the State with which you are at war, than such as will give\r\nthat security which at first you believed to be necessary; and that if\r\nyou carry on a war for vengeance--if you carry on a war for conquest--if\r\nyou carry on a war for purposes of Government at home, as many wars have\r\nbeen carried on in past times, I say you will be guilty of a heinous\r\ncrime, alike in the eyes of God and of man.\r\n\r\nOne other remark perhaps the House will permit me to make. The noble\r\nLord spoke very confidently to-night; and a very considerable portion of\r\nhis speech--hoping, as I do, for the restoration of peace at some time\r\nor another--was to me not very satisfactory. I think that he would only\r\nbe acting a more statesmanlike part if, in his speeches, he were at\r\nleast to abstain from those trifling but still irritating charges which\r\nhe is constantly making against the Russian Government. I can conceive\r\none nation going to war with another nation; but why should the noble\r\nLord say, 'The Sovereign of that State does not allow Bibles to be\r\ncirculated--he suppressed this thing here, and he put down something\r\nelse there'? What did one of the noble Lord's present colleagues say of\r\nthe Government of our ally? Did he not thank God that his despotism\r\ncould not suppress or gag our newspaper press, and declare that the\r\npeople of France were subject to the worst tyranny in Europe? These\r\nstatements from a Minister--from one who has been Prime Minister, and\r\nwho, for aught I know, may be again Prime Minister--show a littleness\r\nthat I did not expect from a statesman of this country, whose fate and\r\nwhose interests hang on every word the noble Lord utters, and when the\r\nfate of thousands, aye, and of tens of thousands, may depend on whether\r\nthe noble Lord should make one false step in the position in which he is\r\nnow placed.\r\n\r\nAnd when terrible calamities were coming upon your army, where was this\r\nGovernment? One Minister was in Scotland, another at the sea-side, and\r\nfor six weeks no meeting of the Cabinet took place. I do not note when\r\nCabinets are held--I sometimes observe that they sit for four or five\r\nhours at a time, and then I think something is wrong--but for six\r\nweeks, or two months, it is said no meeting of the Ministers was held.\r\nThe noble Lord President was making a small speech on a great subject\r\nsomewhere in Cumberland. At Bedford he descanted on the fate of empires,\r\nforgetting that there was nothing so likely to destroy an empire as\r\nunnecessary wars. At Bristol he was advocating a new History of England,\r\nwhich, if impartially written, I know not how the noble Lord's policy\r\nfor the last few months will show to posterity. The noble Lord the\r\nMember for Tiverton undertook a more difficult task--a labour left\r\nunaccomplished by Voltaire--and, when he addressed the Hampshire\r\npeasantry, in one short sentence he overturned the New Testament and\r\ndestroyed the foundations of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I have only to speak on one more point. My hon. Friend the\r\nMember for the West Riding, in what he said about the condition of the\r\nEnglish army in the Crimea, I believe expressed only that which all in\r\nthis House feel, and which, I trust, every person in this country\r\ncapable of thinking feels. When I look at Gentlemen on that bench, and\r\nconsider all their policy has brought about within the last twelve\r\nmonths, I scarcely dare trust myself to speak of them, either in or out\r\nof their presence. We all know what we have lost in this House. Here,\r\nsitting near me, very often sat the Member for Frome (Colonel Boyle). I\r\nmet him a short time before he went out, at Mr. Westerton's, the\r\nbookseller, near Hyde Park Corner. I asked him whether he was going out?\r\nHe answered, he was afraid he was; not afraid in the sense of personal\r\nfear--he knew not that; but he said, with a look and a tone I shall\r\nnever forget, 'It is no light matter for a man who has a wife and five\r\nlittle children.' The stormy Euxine is his grave; his wife is a widow,\r\nhis children fatherless. On the other side of the House sat a Member,\r\nwith whom I was not acquainted, who has lost his life, and another of\r\nwhom I knew something (Colonel Blair). Who is there that does not\r\nrecollect his frank, amiable, and manly countenance? I doubt whether\r\nthere were any men on either side of the House who were more capable of\r\nfixing the goodwill and affection of those with whom they were\r\nassociated. Well, but the place that knew them shall know them no more\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nI have specified only two; but there are a hundred officers who have\r\nbeen killed in battle, or who have died of their wounds; forty have died\r\nof disease; and more than two hundred others have been wounded more or\r\nless severely. This has been a terribly destructive war to officers.\r\nThey have been, as one would have expected them to be, the first in\r\nvalour as the first in place; they have suffered more in proportion to\r\ntheir numbers than the commonest soldiers in the ranks. This has spread\r\nsorrow over the whole country. I was in the House of Lords when the vote\r\nof thanks was moved. In the gallery were many ladies, three-fourths of\r\nwhom were dressed in the deepest mourning. Is this nothing? And in every\r\nvillage, cottages are to be found into which sorrow has entered, and, as\r\nI believe, through the policy of the Ministry, which might have been\r\navoided. No one supposes that the Government wished to spread the pall\r\nof sorrow over the land; but this we had a right to expect, that they\r\nwould at least show becoming gravity in discussing a subject the\r\nappalling consequences of which may come home to individuals and to the\r\nnation. I recollect when Sir Robert Peel addressed the House on a\r\ndispute which threatened hostilities with the United States,--I\r\nrecollect the gravity of his countenance, the solemnity of his tone, his\r\nwhole demeanour showing that he felt in his soul the responsibility that\r\nrested on him.\r\n\r\nI have seen this, and I have seen the present Ministry. There was the\r\nbuffoonery at the Reform Club. Was that becoming a matter of this grave\r\nnature? Has there been a solemnity of manner in the speeches heard in\r\nconnection with this war--and have Ministers shown themselves statesmen\r\nand Christian men when speaking on a subject of this nature? It is very\r\neasy for the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton to rise and say that I\r\nam against war under all circumstances; and that if an enemy were to\r\nland on our shores, I should make a calculation as to whether it would\r\nbe cheaper to take him in or keep him out, and that my opinion on this\r\nquestion is not to be considered either by Parliament or the country. I\r\nam not afraid of discussing the war with the noble Lord on his own\r\nprinciples. I understand the Blue Books as well as he; and, leaving out\r\nall fantastic and visionary notions about what will become of us if\r\nsomething is not done to destroy or to cripple Russia, I say--and I say\r\nit with as much confidence as I ever said anything in my life--that the\r\nwar cannot be justified out of these documents; and that impartial\r\nhistory will teach this to posterity if we do not comprehend it now.\r\n\r\nI am not; nor did I ever pretend to be, a statesman; and that character\r\nis so tainted and so equivocal in our day, that I am not sure that a\r\npure and honourable ambition would aspire to it. I have not enjoyed for\r\nthirty years, like these noble Lords, the honours and emoluments of\r\noffice. I have not set my sails to every passing breeze. I am a plain\r\nand simple citizen, sent here by one of the foremost constituencies of\r\nthe Empire, representing feebly, perhaps, but honestly, I dare aver, the\r\nopinions of very many, and the true interests of all those who have sent\r\nme here. Let it not be said that I am alone in my condemnation of this\r\nwar, and of this incapable and guilty Administration. And, even if I\r\nwere alone, if mine were a solitary voice, raised amid the din of arms\r\nand the clamours of a venal press, I should have the consolation I have\r\nto-night--and which I trust will be mine to the last moment of my\r\nexistence--the priceless consolation that no word of mine has tended to\r\npromote the squandering of my country's treasure or the spilling of one\r\nsingle drop of my country's blood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nNEGOTIATIONS AT VIENNA.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, FEBRUARY 23, 1855.\r\n\r\n_From Hansard._\r\n\r\n[On February 22 Lord Palmerston announced in the House of Commons that\r\nMr. Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Sidney Herbert, the\r\nColonial Secretary, Mr. Cardwell, the President of the Board of Trade,\r\nand Sir James Graham, the First Lord of the Admiralty, had resigned the\r\noffices which they had accepted a fortnight before. The ground of this\r\nsecession was the impression entertained by the above-named personages\r\nthat the Committee of Inquiry moved for by Mr. Roebuck was equivalent to\r\na vote of censure on them, as they had formed part of the Government of\r\nLord Aberdeen, whose conduct of the Russian war was impugned by the\r\nappointment of the Committee. The places vacated by these secessions\r\nwere filled up on February 28.]\r\n\r\nI am one of those forming the majority of the House, I suspect, who are\r\ndisposed to look upon our present position as one of more than ordinary\r\ngravity. I am one, also, of those, not probably constituting so great a\r\nmajority of the House, who regret extremely the circumstances which have\r\nobliged the right hon. Gentlemen who are now upon this bench to secede\r\nfrom the Government of the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton. I do not\r\ntake upon me for a moment to condemn them; because I think, if there be\r\nanything in which a man must judge for himself, it is whether he should\r\ntake office if it be offered to him, whether he should secede from\r\noffice, whether he should serve under a particular leader, or engage in\r\nthe service of the Crown, or retain office in a particular emergency. In\r\nsuch cases I think that the decision must be left to his own conscience\r\nand his own judgment; and I should be the last person to condemn any one\r\nfor the decision to which he might come. I think, however, that the\r\nspeech of the right hon. Gentleman is one which the House cannot have\r\nlistened to without being convinced that he and his retiring Colleagues\r\nhave been moved to the course which they have taken by a deliberate\r\njudgment upon this question, which, whether it be right or wrong, is\r\nfully explained, and is honest to the House and to the country.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I said that I regretted their secession, because I am one of\r\nthose who do not wish to see the Government of the noble Lord the Member\r\nfor Tiverton overthrown. The House knows well, and nobody knows better\r\nthan the noble Lord, that I have never been one of his ardent and\r\nenthusiastic supporters. I have often disapproved of his policy both at\r\nhome and abroad; but I hope that I do not bear to him, as I can honestly\r\nsay that I do not bear to any man in this House--for from all I have\r\nreceived unnumbered courtesies--any feeling that takes even the tinge of\r\na personal animosity; and even if I did, at a moment so grave as this,\r\nno feeling of a personal character whatever should prevent me from doing\r\nthat which I think now, of all times, we are called upon to do--that\r\nwhich we honestly and conscientiously believe to be for the permanent\r\ninterests of the country. We are in this position, that for a month\r\npast, at least, there has been a chaos in the regions of the\r\nAdministration. Nothing can be more embarrassing--I had almost said\r\nnothing can be more humiliating--than the position which we offer to the\r\ncountry; and I am afraid that the knowledge of our position is not\r\nconfined to the limits of these islands.\r\n\r\nIt will be admitted that we want a Government; that if the country is to\r\nbe saved from the breakers which now surround it, there must be a\r\nGovernment; and it devolves upon the House of Commons to rise to the\r\ngravity of the occasion, and to support any man who is conscious of his\r\nresponsibility, and who is honestly offering and endeavouring to deliver\r\nthe country from the embarrassment in which we now find it. We are at\r\nwar, and I shall not say one single sentence with regard to the policy\r\nof the war or its origin, and I know not that I shall say a single\r\nsentence with regard to the conduct of it; but the fact is that we are\r\nat war with the greatest military Power, probably, of the world, and\r\nthat we are carrying on our operations at a distance of 3,000 miles from\r\nhome, and in the neighbourhood of the strongest fortifications of that\r\ngreat military Empire. I will not stop to criticise--though it really\r\ninvites me--the fact that some who have told us that we were in danger\r\nfrom the aggressions of that Empire, at the same time told us that that\r\nEmpire was powerless for aggression, and also that it was impregnable to\r\nattack. By some means, however, the public have been alarmed as if that\r\naggressive power were unbounded, and they have been induced to undertake\r\nan expedition, as if the invasion of an impregnable country were a\r\nmatter of holiday-making rather than of war.\r\n\r\nBut we are now in a peculiar position with regard to that war; for, if I\r\nam not mistaken--and I think I gathered as much from the language of the\r\nright hon. Gentleman--at this very moment terms have been agreed upon--\r\nagreed upon by the Cabinet of Lord Aberdeen; consented to by the noble\r\nLord the Member for Tiverton when he was in that Cabinet; and ratified\r\nand confirmed by him upon the formation of his own Government--and that\r\nthose terms are now specifically known and understood; and that they\r\nhave been offered to the Government with which this country is at war,\r\nand in conjunction with France and Austria--one, certainly, and the\r\nother supposed to be, an ally of this country. Now, those terms consist\r\nof four propositions, which I shall neither describe nor discuss,\r\nbecause they are known to the House; but three of them are not matters\r\nof dispute; and with regard to the other, I think that the noble Lord\r\nthe Member for the City of London stated, upon a recent occasion, that\r\nit was involved in this proposition--that the preponderant power of\r\nRussia in the Black Sea should cease, and that Russia had accepted it\r\nwith that interpretation. Therefore, whatever difference arises is\r\nmerely as to the mode in which that 'preponderant power' shall be\r\nunderstood or made to cease. Now, there are some Gentlemen not far from\r\nme--there are men who write in the public press--there are thousands of\r\npersons in the United Kingdom at this moment--and I learn with\r\nastonishment and dismay that there are persons even in that grave\r\nassembly which we are not allowed to specify by a name in this House--\r\nwho have entertained dreams--impracticable theories--expectations of\r\nvast European and Asiatic changes, of revived nationalities, and of a\r\nnew map of Europe, if not of the world, as a result or an object of this\r\nwar. And it is from those Gentlemen that we hear continually, addressed\r\nto the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton, language which I cannot well\r\nunderstand. They call upon him to act, to carry on the war with vigour,\r\nand to prosecute enterprises which neither his Government nor any other\r\nGovernment has ever seriously entertained; but I would appeal to those\r\nGentlemen whether it does not become us--regarding the true interests\r\nand the true honour of the country--if our Government have offered terms\r\nof peace to Russia, not to draw back from those terms, not to cause any\r\nunnecessary delay, not to adopt any subterfuge to prevent those terms\r\nbeing accepted, not to attempt shuffles of any kind, not to endeavour to\r\ninsist upon harder terms, and thus make the approach of peace even still\r\nmore distant than it is at present?\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said about the honour of the country in any other\r\nrelation involved in this affair, this, at least, I expect every man who\r\nhears me to admit--that if terms of peace have been offered they have\r\nbeen offered in good faith, and shall be in honour and good faith\r\nadhered to; so that if, unfortunately for Europe and humanity, there\r\nshould be any failure at Vienna, no man should point to the English\r\nGovernment and to the authorities and rulers of this Christian country,\r\nand say that we have prolonged the war and the infinite calamities of\r\nwhich it is the cause.\r\n\r\nI have said that I was anxious that the Government of the noble Lord\r\nshould not be overthrown. Will the House allow me to say why I am so?\r\nThe noble Lord at the head of the Government has long been a great\r\nauthority with many persons in this country upon foreign policy. His\r\nlate colleague, and present envoy to Vienna, has long been a great\r\nauthority with a large portion of the people of this country upon almost\r\nall political questions. With the exception of that unhappy selection of\r\nan ambassador at Constantinople, I hold that there are no men in this\r\ncountry more truly responsible for our present position in this war than\r\nthe noble Lord who now fills the highest office in the State and the\r\nnoble Lord who is now, I trust, rapidly approaching the scene of his\r\nlabours in Vienna. I do not say this now to throw blame upon those noble\r\nLords, because their policy, which I hold to be wrong, they, without\r\ndoubt, as firmly believe to be right; but I am only stating facts. It\r\nhas been their policy that they have entered into war for certain\r\nobjects, and I am sure that neither the noble Lord at the head of the\r\nGovernment nor his late colleague the noble Lord the Member for London\r\nwill shrink from the responsibility which attaches to them. Well, Sir,\r\nnow we have those noble Lords in a position which is, in my humble\r\nopinion, favourable to the termination of the troubles which exist. I\r\nthink that the noble Lord at the head of the Government himself would\r\nhave more influence in stilling whatever may exist of clamour in this\r\ncountry than any other Member of this House. I think, also, that the\r\nnoble Lord the Member for London would not have undertaken the mission\r\nto Vienna if he had not entertained some strong belief that, by so\r\ndoing, he might bring the war to an end. Nobody gains reputation by a\r\nfailure in negotiation, and as that noble Lord is well acquainted with\r\nthe whole question from beginning to end, I entertain a hope--I will not\r\nsay a sanguine hope--that the result of that mission to Vienna will be\r\nto bring about a peace, to extricate this country from some of those\r\ndifficulties inseparable from a state of war.\r\n\r\nThere is one subject upon which I should like to put a question to the\r\nnoble Lord at the head of the Government. I shall not say one word here\r\nabout the state of the army in the Crimea, or one word about its numbers\r\nor its condition. Every Member of this House, every inhabitant of this\r\ncountry, has been sufficiently harrowed with details regarding it. To my\r\nsolemn belief, thousands--nay, scores of thousands of persons--have\r\nretired to rest, night after night, whose slumbers have been disturbed\r\nor whose dreams have been based upon the sufferings and agonies of our\r\nsoldiers in the Crimea. I should like to ask the noble Lord at the head\r\nof the Government--although I am not sure if he will feel that he can or\r\nought to answer the question--whether the noble Lord the Member for\r\nLondon has power, after discussions have commenced, and as soon as there\r\nshall be established good grounds for believing that the negotiations\r\nfor peace will prove successful, to enter into any armistice? ['No!\r\nno!']\r\n\r\nI know not, Sir, who it is that says 'No, no,' but I should like to see\r\nany man get up and say that the destruction of 200,000 human lives lost\r\non all sides during the course of this unhappy conflict is not a\r\nsufficient sacrifice. You are not pretending to conquer territory--you\r\nare not pretending to hold fortified or unfortified towns; you have\r\noffered terms of peace which, as I understand them, I do not say are not\r\nmoderate; and breathes there a man in this House or in this country\r\nwhose appetite for blood is so insatiable that, even when terms of peace\r\nhave been offered and accepted, he pines for that assault in which of\r\nRussian, Turk, French and English, as sure as one man dies, 20,000\r\ncorpses will strew the streets of Sebastopol? I say I should like to ask\r\nthe noble Lord--and I am sure that he will feel, and that this House\r\nwill feel, that I am speaking in no unfriendly manner towards the\r\nGovernment of which he is at the head--I should like to know, and I\r\nventure to hope that it is so, if the noble Lord the Member for London\r\nhas power, at the earliest stage of these proceedings at Vienna, at\r\nwhich it can properly be done--and I should think that it might\r\nproperly be done at a very early stage--to adopt a course by which all\r\nfurther waste of human life may be put an end to, and further animosity\r\nbetween three great nations be, as far as possible, prevented?\r\n\r\nI appeal to the noble Lord at the head of the Government and to this\r\nHouse; I am not now complaining of the war--I am not now complaining of\r\nthe terms of peace, nor, indeed, of anything that has been done--but I\r\nwish to suggest to this House what, I believe, thousands and tens of\r\nthousands of the most educated and of the most Christian portion of the\r\npeople of this country are feeling upon this subject, although, indeed,\r\nin the midst of a certain clamour in the country, they do not give\r\npublic expression to their feelings. Your country is not in an\r\nadvantageous state at this moment; from one end of the kingdom to the\r\nother there is a general collapse of industry. Those Members of this\r\nHouse not intimately acquainted with the trade and commerce of the\r\ncountry do not fully comprehend our position as to the diminution of\r\nemployment and the lessening of wages. An increase in the cost of living\r\nis finding its way to the homes and hearts of a vast number of the\r\nlabouring population.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there is growing up--and, notwithstanding what some\r\nhon. Members of this House may think of me, no man regrets it more than\r\nI do--a bitter and angry feeling against that class which has for a long\r\nperiod conducted the public affairs of this country. I like political\r\nchanges when such changes are made as the result, not of passion, but of\r\ndeliberation and reason. Changes so made are safe, but changes made\r\nunder the influence of violent exaggeration, or of the violent passions\r\nof public meetings, are not changes usually approved by this House or\r\nadvantageous to the country. I cannot but notice, in speaking to\r\nGentlemen who sit on either side of this House, or in speaking to any\r\none I meet between this House and any of those localities we frequent\r\nwhen this House is up--I cannot, I say, but notice that an uneasy\r\nfeeling exists as to the news which may arrive by the very next mail\r\nfrom the East. I do not suppose that your troops are to be beaten in\r\nactual conflict with the foe, or that they will be driven into the sea;\r\nbut I am certain that many homes in England in which there now exists a\r\nfond hope that the distant one may return--many such homes may be\r\nrendered desolate when the next mail shall arrive. The Angel of Death\r\nhas been abroad throughout the land; you may almost hear the beating of\r\nhis wings. There is no one, as when the first-born were slain of old, to\r\nsprinkle with blood the lintel and the two sideposts of our doors, that\r\nhe may spare and pass on; he takes his victims from the castle of the\r\nnoble, the mansion of the wealthy, and the cottage of the poor and the\r\nlowly, and it is on behalf of all these classes that I make this solemn\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nI tell the noble Lord, that if he be ready honestly and frankly to\r\nendeavour, by the negotiations about to be opened at Vienna, to put an\r\nend to this war, no word of mine, no vote of mine, will be given to\r\nshake his power for one single moment, or to change his position in this\r\nHouse. I am sure that the noble Lord is not inaccessible to appeals made\r\nto him from honest motives and with no unfriendly feeling. The noble\r\nLord has been for more than forty years a Member of this House. Before I\r\nwas born, he sat upon the Treasury bench, and he has spent his life in\r\nthe service of his country. He is no longer young, and his life has\r\nextended almost to the term allotted to man. I would ask, I would\r\nentreat the noble Lord to take a course which, when he looks back upon\r\nhis whole political career--whatever he may therein find to be pleased\r\nwith, whatever to regret--cannot but be a source of gratification to\r\nhim. By adopting that course he would have the satisfaction of\r\nreflecting that, having obtained the object of his laudable ambition--\r\nhaving become the foremost subject of the Crown, the director of, it may\r\nbe, the destinies of his country, and the presiding genius in her\r\ncouncils--he had achieved a still higher and nobler ambition: that he\r\nhad returned the sword to the scabbard--that at his word torrents of\r\nblood had ceased to flow--that he had restored tranquillity to Europe,\r\nand saved this country from the indescribable calamities of war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nON THE PROSECUTION OF THE RUSSIAN WAR.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, JUNE 7, 1855.\r\n\r\n_From Hansard_.\r\n\r\n[On May 22 Mr. Disraeli moved, 'That this House cannot adjourn for the\r\nRecess without expressing its dissatisfaction with the ambiguous\r\nlanguage and uncertain conduct of Her Majesty's Government in reference\r\nto the great question of peace or war, and that, under these\r\ncircumstances, the House feels it a duty to declare that it will\r\ncontinue to give every support to Her Majesty in the prosecution of the\r\nwar, until Her Majesty shall, in conjunction with her allies, obtain for\r\nthe country a safe and honourable peace.' This was met by an amendment\r\nfrom Sir Francis Baring, 'That this House, having seen with regret that\r\nthe Conferences at Vienna have not led to a termination of hostilities,\r\nfeels it to be a duty to declare that it will continue to give every\r\nsupport to Her Majesty in the prosecution of the war until Her Majesty\r\nshall, in conjunction with her allies, obtain for this country a safe\r\nand honourable peace.' Mr. Disraeli's resolution was rejected by 319\r\nvotes to 219. Sir F. Baring's motion having become substantive, was met\r\nby an amendment of Mr. Lowe, to the effect, 'That this House having seen\r\nwith regret, owing to the refusal of Russia to restrict the strength of\r\nher navy in the Black Sea, that the Conferences at Vienna have not led\r\nto a termination of hostilities, feels it to be a duty to declare that\r\nthe means of coming to an agreement on the third basis of negotiation\r\nbeing by that refusal exhausted, it will continue,' &c. Mr. Lowe's\r\namendment was negatived and Sir F. Baring's motion carried without a\r\ndivision on June 8.]\r\n\r\nLast year, when the declaration of war was brought down to the House, I\r\ntook the opportunity of addressing the House in opposition to the policy\r\nof the Government of that day. I was told I was too late; and it has\r\nbeen also said repeatedly in this debate that those who take the views\r\nwhich I take are too late on this occasion. It seems to be one of the\r\nconsequences of the, I would say, irresponsible system of diplomacy in\r\nthis country with regard to foreign affairs, that we are never allowed\r\nto discuss a mischief when it is growing, but only when it is completed,\r\nand when no remedy can be applied. And now we are at liberty to discuss\r\nthe conduct of the Government in the Conferences at Vienna; and, though\r\nwe were repeatedly told from the Treasury bench that it might be\r\ninjurious to the public service to discuss what was going on till the\r\naffair was concluded, I suspect the House has come to the conclusion\r\nthat we have been pursuing our true duty to the country in the debate\r\nthat has taken place.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for\r\nBuckinghamshire (Mr. Disraeli) for having placed his notice on the table\r\nof the House, and not less to my right hon. Friend and Colleague that\r\nhe, before the recess, moved the adjournment of the debate. I am\r\nsatisfied myself that the people of this country have no intention to go\r\nwrong either in home or foreign affairs, and it requires only that\r\nquestions of this nature should be frequently discussed by the\r\nintelligent men of which this House is composed to set before them the\r\ntrue state of affairs, and to bring them to a wise opinion with regard\r\nto the policy which is being pursued. Now, we are not discussing the\r\npolicy of the war--that is, of the origin of the war. If we were, I\r\nshould lay claim to some degree of foresight in the opinion which I\r\nexpressed a year ago, for there seems to be a general feeling that the\r\nsacrifices that have already been made are somewhat greater than the\r\nresults that have been obtained. I am anxious, in the observations I may\r\nhave to address to the House, to impress my opinions on them, if it be\r\npossible to do so, and to lay before my countrymen out of the House that\r\nwhich I believe involves their true interests with regard to this\r\nquestion. It is necessary, therefore, to have a basis for our\r\ndiscussion--to fix what were the objects of the war--to ascertain, if\r\nthat be possible, whether those objects have been secured and\r\naccomplished--and whether there can be anything in prospect which we are\r\nlikely to gain that will justify the Government and the House in\r\nproceeding further with the war.\r\n\r\nNow, in my observations I am not about to carry on this discussion with\r\nthe Gentlemen below me, who are interested in a question which is not\r\nthe question before the House. They are interested in some vast, and, as\r\nit seems to me, imaginary scheme that would involve Europe in protracted\r\nand widely-extended hostilities; and I think that, so far as the House\r\nis concerned in discussing the question with the Government, these\r\nGentlemen are almost, if not altogether, out of court. It appears to me,\r\nif they were logical in their course, finding that the objects of the\r\nGovernment and the objects of the Government of France were entirely\r\ndifferent from those which they have at heart, and believing, as they\r\ndo, that the objects of the allied Governments are not worth a war, that\r\nthey ought rather to join us on this bench, and, instead of there being\r\none Peace bench in the House, there would be two Peace benches, and the\r\nPeace party would clearly gain a considerable accession of strength. The\r\nnoble Lord the Secretary of State for the Colonies has stated over and\r\nover again--and, amid the confusion of statements which he and his\r\nColleagues have made, I think he will not find fault if I assume that\r\nthe object of the war is simply the security of the Turkish territory\r\nfrom the grasp of Russia, and probably from the grasp of any other\r\nPower--the noble Lord has stated that he apprehends that if Russia were\r\nto extend her empire by the possession of Turkey, it would give her a\r\npower that would be unsafe with regard to the other nations of Europe.\r\nWhen the noble Lord speaks in that vague, and, if I were not speaking of\r\na man so eminent, I should say, absurd language of the liberties of\r\nEurope and the civilization of the world, I should say he means by that\r\nmerely those great objects, so far as they can be conserved by the\r\nconservation of the Turkish territory.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord tells us--we are now getting out of some of the\r\nmystifications--that he has no kind of sympathy that would lead him into\r\nwar for the oppressed nationalities of Europe. The noble Lord the Member\r\nfor Tiverton (Viscount Palmerston) a few nights ago turned the cold\r\nshoulder to the people of Hungary. He said he thought there could be no\r\ngreater calamity to Europe than that Hungary should be separated from\r\nthe Austrian Empire. Well, then, we have got rid of Hungary; and, next,\r\nthe noble Lord the Member for the City of London (Lord John Russell)\r\ntells us it is quite a mistake to suppose that he ever intended to go to\r\nwar for Poland. In fact, he stated--what will be very disheartening to\r\nhon. Gentlemen below me--that he never supposed we were going to war for\r\nsuch a Quixotic object; that the case of Poland is one that is hopeless,\r\nand therefore it would be madness in England and France--not\r\nindiscretion--not a doubtful undertaking--but positive madness in\r\nEngland and France to take any part in promoting resistance in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHaving now got rid of Hungary and Poland, we only require that some\r\nMember of the Cabinet should get up later in the evening--and that I\r\nhave no doubt will be the case--to state that it is utterly impossible\r\nfor this country to involve itself in hostilities with a view to the\r\nregeneration of any part of Italy. The noble Lord the Member for London\r\ntells us we are not going to war for the sake of conquest; and that, I\r\nthink, is a matter which ought to be kept in mind by hon. Gentlemen who\r\nare urging the Government on to a prolonged war. He stated on Tuesday\r\nnight, 'Be it always remembered that we are seeking no object of our\r\nown;'--it would be a very odd thing if we were to go to war for the\r\nobjects of somebody else--'that we are seeking no object of our own;\r\nthat when peace is concluded we shall not have acquired one ell of new\r\nterritory, or secured any advantage whatever for ourselves. It is for\r\nTurkey and the general system of Europe that we are struggling.' In\r\nfact, the whole matter always resolves itself into some general\r\nmystification, and at this moment we are, every man of us, almost\r\nentirely in the dark as to what are the ultimate objects of the war.\r\n\r\nOne other point that I ought to mention is the question of crippling and\r\nhumbling Russia. I am, of course, willing to admit that when people go\r\nto war they are not expected to be very nice in their treatment of each\r\nother, and, if the taking of Sebastopol be an object of those who are in\r\nfavour of the war, to take Sebastopol they will inflict any injury they\r\ncan upon Russia. But the noble Lord told us last year that he still\r\nintended to leave Russia a great empire. I thought that exceedingly\r\nconsiderate of the noble Lord, and I understand--I think it has been\r\nstated in the public papers--that it is considered at St. Petersburg a\r\ngreat condescension on the part of so eminent a statesman. Well, then,\r\nif we are not going to war for nationalities, nor for conquest, nor for\r\nany such crippling of Russia as would be effected by her dismemberment,\r\nwe come to this simple question--in the condition in which Turkey has\r\nlong existed, what are the means by which the security of Turkey can be\r\nbest guaranteed? No man asserts that the security of Turkey can be\r\nabsolute, but that it must be partial and conditional. As it is well to\r\nhave high authority for these statements, I have here an extract from a\r\nspeech made by Lord Clarendon a few nights ago on the Resolution moved\r\nby Lord Grey. The noble Lord then stated:--\r\n\r\n  'My noble Friend says, and says truly, that the attainment of all\r\n  this would offer no security to Turkey. The value of a treaty\r\n  must always depend upon the spirit in which it is agreed to, and\r\n  the good faith with which it is entered into. No treaty can make\r\n  a weak Power like Turkey perfectly safe against a powerful\r\n  neighbour immediately in contact with her, if that neighbour is\r\n  determined to act the aggressive towards her.'--[3\r\n  _Hansard_, cxxxviii. 1152.]\r\n\r\nThus Lord Clarendon admits, what is perfectly obvious to the common\r\nsense of all who have heard anything of Russia or Turkey, except from\r\nthe lips of the Prime Minister, that what we are seeking to obtain is\r\nnot an absolute security for Turkey, but a conditional security, such as\r\nher circumstances, her population, her government, and geographical\r\nposition render attainable by her friends and allies. We have now been\r\nfourteen months at war, and two Cabinets--the Cabinets of Lord Aberdeen\r\nand of the present First Minister--I might say four Cabinets, for the\r\nCabinets of France and Austria must have agreed to the same thing--have\r\nagreed to certain terms, and have offered them to Russia. They have been\r\naccepted as the basis of negotiations, conferences have been opened, and\r\ncertain proceedings towards a settlement have taken place; and now I\r\nshould like to know whether the terms which were offered were offered in\r\nearnest. Judging of the Cabinet of Lord Aberdeen by the conduct of some\r\nof its Members, and especially of Lord Aberdeen himself, I am certain\r\nthat they were sincere in the terms they offered. But the _Times_\r\nnewspaper, which now in its many changes has become the organ and great\r\nstimulant of the present Cabinet, expresses its astonishment that any\r\nperson should think that peace was intended by the Conferences at\r\nVienna. The _Times_ states that the object of the Conferences was\r\nnot to bring about a peace, but to shame Austria into becoming a\r\nfaithful and warlike ally.\r\n\r\nNow, when the noble Lord the Member for London was sent to Vienna to\r\nnegotiate, I confess I was one of those who formed the opinion that the\r\nnoble Lord, amid the many eccentricities of his career, would not have\r\nundertaken that mission unless he himself had been honest with regard to\r\nthe terms to be offered, and anxious, if possible, to consolidate a\r\npeace. There were, however, certain persons--malicious people, of\r\ncourse--who found out that it would be convenient to the First Minister\r\nto have the noble Lord at a distance, at least for a time. But I never\r\nadopted that idea. I did not believe that the noble Lord's journey to\r\nVienna, with a retinue that required him to occupy no less than thirty-\r\ntwo rooms in one hotel, would have been undertaken unless the noble Lord\r\nconsidered that the object was a reality, on which the interests of the\r\ncountry and of Europe depended. I think he would have been the last man\r\nin the country to lend himself to such a miserable hoax as going to\r\nVienna, not to make peace, but to shame Austria into becoming a faithful\r\nand warlike ally. I assume, therefore, that terms were sincerely\r\noffered, and that those terms gave guarantees which were sufficient, and\r\na security which was as ample as the circumstances admitted for the\r\nintegrity and independence of the Ottoman Empire. It is from that\r\nstarting-point that I would discuss this question.\r\n\r\nThere are hon. Members in this House who think that even if those terms\r\nwere obtained they would still be in no degree a compensation for the\r\nenormous sacrifices which the country has made. I happen to hold the\r\nsame opinion, and it was with that conviction that I protested against\r\ngoing into the war. Indeed, I think that the argument I used a year ago,\r\nthat nothing to be obtained in the war could at all approach a\r\ncompensation for the enormous sacrifices the country would be called\r\nupon to make, has been greatly strengthened. Well, Sir, the terms\r\noffered are called 'bases:' from which one understands, not that they\r\nare everything, but that they are something capable of what diplomatists\r\ncall 'development.' I recollect a question asked of a child at school,\r\nin one of those lessons called 'object lessons,' 'What is the basis of a\r\nbatter pudding?' It was obvious that flour was the basis, but the eggs\r\nand the butter and the rest were developments and additions. But if the\r\nbases are capable of development, so I take it for granted that the\r\nmeaning of negotiation is not the offering of an _ultimatum_, but\r\nthe word involves to every man's sense the probability of concession--\r\nbutter, it may be--but concession of one sort or another.\r\n\r\nI will not go through all the Four Points, because the attention of the\r\nHouse ought really to be centred upon the third article and the matters\r\nconnected with it. The House must remember that this article involves\r\ntwo most important subjects--first, the territorial guarantee, which if\r\nit were sufficiently secured would be everything the House and the\r\ncountry required from the war--namely, that the territories of Turkey\r\nshall never be molested, so long as the treaty shall continue, by any of\r\nthe great Powers who are parties to such treaty; and, secondly, that the\r\npreponderance of Russia in the Black Sea shall cease. Now, the\r\nterritorial guarantee was granted without difficulty. [An hon. Member:\r\n'No.'] Well, no difficulty was made about the territorial guarantee but\r\nthis:--Prince Gortchakoff said, very wisely, that he would not enter\r\ninto an absolute pledge to go to war in case of any infraction of the\r\ntreaty, and the noble Lord who said 'No' will find, when he has examined\r\nthe question a little more closely, that it does not make the slightest\r\ndifference as to the actual results of a treaty whether a Power\r\nguarantees in the mode proposed by Russia, or in the manner proposed by\r\nthe noble Lord the Member for the City of London, because, when an\r\ninfraction of a treaty occurs, the power of judging whether any of the\r\nGovernments who are parties to such treaty should go to war or not, is\r\nleft with each individual Government. If, for example, France stretched\r\nher dominions westward towards Morocco, or eastward towards Tunis or\r\nTripoli, it would, of course, have been the duty, and would have been in\r\nthe power of Russia, even had she accepted the exact terms proposed by\r\nthe allies, to judge for herself whether a case had arisen which\r\nrequired her to go to war, or which justified her in doing so.\r\n\r\nSuch a case arose very lately with reference to Schleswig-Holstein. We\r\nwere bound, under an ancient treaty, to go to war in the event of the\r\ninfraction of certain treaties affecting Schleswig-Holstein; but when\r\nthis case occurred the subject was considered by the Government, the\r\nnoble Lord (Lord Palmerston) being at the time, I believe, Foreign\r\nSecretary--who most wisely and properly, not only for this country, but\r\nfor the interests of Schleswig-Holstein and of Europe, declined to act\r\nupon what was represented to be the strict letter of the treaty, and\r\nEngland did not engage in war in consequence of the disputes which then\r\ntook place. I must say that what seems to me as the most statesmanlike\r\nand elevated declaration in the protocols is the statement of Prince\r\nGortchakoff, that the blood of Russia is the property of Russia, and\r\nthat he will not pledge himself that years hence--it may be even a\r\ncentury hence--the blood of Russia shall be shed in a cause which, when\r\nthe time arrives, may be one which would be altogether unworthy of such\r\na sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the question of the Christian protectorate, the House\r\nwill probably recollect that it was represented over and over again by\r\nMinisters in this House--it was stated in the speeches of Lord Clarendon\r\nin another place--that the proposition of Russia, as conveyed in the\r\nMenchikoff note, was intended to transfer the virtual sovereignty of\r\n10,000,000 or 12,000,000 of Ottoman subjects to the Czar. If that were\r\nso, the Menchikoff note and all the old protectorate treaties being\r\nabolished, surely the House will consider whether the combination of the\r\nthree propositions--the territorial guarantees, the Christian\r\nprotectorate, and the Black Sea project--do not give such securities to\r\nTurkey as the condition of Turkey will permit. Now the preponderance of\r\nRussia in the Black Sea, as I think my hon. Friend the Member for the\r\nWest Riding (Mr. Cobden) showed very clearly the other evening, is in a\r\ncertain sense a fact which all the negotiations in the world cannot\r\nwrite off. I see that one of the public journals this morning,\r\ncommenting upon my hon. Friend's speech, says, 'Yes, truly, the\r\ncommercial preponderance of Russia in the Black Sea is a fact which\r\ncannot be denied;' and then proceeds to argue that it does not follow\r\nthat Russia should have a political and naval preponderance. But I do\r\nnot know any case in which there is a commercial supremacy in a sea like\r\nthe Black Sea that is not followed by a preponderance of every other\r\nkind. The question now is, however, how is that preponderance to cease?\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord the Member for the City of London referred the other\r\nnight to a proposition made by the French Government, but which, I\r\nthink, does not appear at all distinctly in the protocols, with regard\r\nto making the Black Sea a neutral sea. I conceive that was so monstrous\r\na proposition, in the present condition of Europe, that I am surprised\r\nit should have been entertained for a moment by any sensible man. I\r\nsupposed it was found so utterly indefensible that it does not appear as\r\na distinct proposition in the protocols. This proposal of making the\r\nBlack Sea a neutral sea gave place to another project, and it appears to\r\nme very like asking Russia, voluntarily or by compulsion, to perform the\r\noperation of amputation upon herself. I maintain that the third article\r\nas offered to Russia in December last could not mean what the noble Lord\r\noffered to Russia at Vienna, because the cessation of preponderance does\r\nnot mean the transfer of preponderance, but rather the establishment of\r\nan equilibrium--not the destruction of an equilibrium and the\r\nestablishment of preponderance on the other side.\r\n\r\nSome hon. Gentlemen talk as if Russia were a Power which you could take\r\nto Bow Street, and bind over before some stipendiary magistrate to keep\r\nthe peace for six months. Russia is a great Power, as England is, and in\r\ntreating with her you must consider that the Russian Government has to\r\nconsult its own dignity, its own interests, and public opinion, just as\r\nmuch at least as the Government of this country. Now, what was the\r\nproposition of this third article? The proposal was, that Russia should\r\nhave eight ships; but what was the proposition with regard to her\r\npresent antagonists? That Turkey should also have eight ships, that\r\nFrance should have four, and that England should have four; and I\r\nbelieve that in a preceding protocol, which has not been alluded to in\r\nthis debate, it is proposed that the contracting Powers should have two\r\nships each at the mouth of the Danube, so that if these terms had been\r\nagreed upon, Russia would have had eight ships in the Black Sea, while\r\nTurkey, France, and England would have had twenty. Now, that is not a\r\nmere cessation of a preponderance; it is not the establishment of an\r\nequilibrium; it is a transfer of the supremacy of the Black Sea from\r\nthat country which, if any country should be supreme there, has the best\r\nclaim--namely, Russia. Besides this, however, Turkey would have had\r\nwhatever ships she liked in the Bosphorus, and the allies would also\r\nhave had as many ships as they chose in the Mediterranean and the\r\nLevant.\r\n\r\nNow, let us for a moment consider the offer with which Russia met this\r\nproposal. The first proposition was that of the open Straits, which is\r\ndisapproved by the hon. Baronet opposite. I am not about to say that\r\nthis proposition should have been accepted in preference to the other,\r\nbut I think it is the true interest of Europe, and also of Turkey\r\nitself, that the Straits should be thrown open. At any rate, it must be\r\nadmitted that the preponderance of Russia, in the sense in which we now\r\nunderstand it, would be absolutely destroyed if the Straits were thrown\r\nopen. Russia made a proposition which appears to me to be highly\r\nsatisfactory--that such regulations should be made by the Sultan and his\r\nGovernment with regard to the position and duration of the anchorages of\r\nships between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea as would preclude the\r\npossibility, so far as there were means of doing so, of any\r\ninconvenience or danger to Constantinople from the opening of the\r\nStraits. If that had been agreed to, all nations would have been\r\nentitled to the passage of the Straits, and I believe that all nations\r\nwould equally have respected the privilege thus granted to them. Now,\r\nsuppose these Straits, instead of being one mile wide, had been ten\r\nmiles wide, what difference would it make to Turkey? If the Straits were\r\nten miles wide they would be open. Turkey would have no right to close\r\nthem, and European nations would not permit her to pretend to, or to\r\nexercise, any such power; but Constantinople would be no more secure\r\nthen than it would be now with the Straits open, whether they were ten\r\nmiles wide or one mile wide. If the Straits were open, the consequences\r\nto Constantinople and to Turkey appear to me to be precisely the same.\r\nTurkey would be equally safe; Turkey would be equally menaced. Our\r\nfleets would visit the Black Sea in the course of the season, and the\r\nRussian Black Sea fleet, if it chose, would visit the Mediterranean.\r\nThere would be no sort of pretence for wrangling about the Straits; and\r\nthe balance of power--if I may use the term--between the fleets of\r\nRussia, France, and England, would be probably the best guarantee that\r\ncould be offered for the security of Constantinople and Turkey, so far\r\nas they are in danger of aggression either from the Black Sea or the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nBut it is said, the Sultan's sovereignty would be menaced--that he has\r\nan undoubted right to close the Straits. I doubt whether that right will\r\nbe very long maintained; but if it be maintained, and if you are to\r\nreject any proposition which interferes with the Sultan's sovereignty, I\r\nask you whether the sovereignty of the Czar is not as dear to him? and\r\nwhether, if, in negotiations of this kind, you can find any mode of\r\nattaining your object without inflicting injury upon either the\r\nsovereignty of the Sultan or the Czar, it would not be much more\r\nstatesmanlike to adopt it, and so to frame your treaties that neither\r\nshould feel that it was subjected to an indignity, and therefore seek to\r\nviolate such treaties at the first opportunity? Well, but the second\r\nproposition, which I think the hon. Baronet approved, and which I think\r\nthe noble Lord proposed, was, that the Sultan should open the Straits at\r\nwill. I ask the House whether that proposition, if accepted, would not\r\nimply that the Sultan could have no other enemy than Russia?--which I\r\nthink is doubtful. If the Black Sea were open to the West, and the\r\nMediterranean closed to the East, surely that is assuming that the\r\nSultan could have no enemy but Russia. The Sultan could close the\r\nStraits to Russia, but the Western Powers could always proceed to the\r\nBlack Sea. The French plan, in my opinion, exposed Turkey far more to\r\nthe West than the Russian plan exposed her to the East. Nothing can be\r\nmore short-sighted than the notion which the noble Lord the Member for\r\nLondon started at the conferences, that Turkey could have no enemy but\r\nRussia. In fact, everybody there seemed to be on exceedingly good terms\r\nwith himself. The Austrian Minister said nobody would suspect Austria--\r\nno one could be suspected but Russia. But our experience for many years\r\nwill tell us that there has been just as much menace from the West as\r\nfrom the East--the rapacity of the West is not less perceptible than\r\nthat of the East. ['Hear.'] Some one expresses a sentiment in opposition\r\n--it is a gentleman who has never read the Blue Books--he does not know\r\nthat almost the whole of this business began in a threat of the most\r\naudacious and insulting character from the Ambassador of France--a\r\nthreat to order up the French fleet to the Dardanelles, and further to\r\nland an expedition in Syria to take possession of Jerusalem and the\r\nwhole of the Holy Places. Do you mean to tell me, you and the noble Lord\r\nhimself, who tried to frighten the country with the notion of the French\r\nfleet coming to invade England, that the fleet which three years ago\r\nthreatened England, and more recently threatened the Dardanelles, has\r\nfor ever abandoned rapacious desires, and that therefore there will\r\nnever again be a menace against Turkey from France?\r\n\r\nI understand, however, there is a very different opinion prevalent upon\r\nthe southern shores of the Mediterranean. The Emperor of Morocco, a\r\npotentate somewhat allied to this country, as I am told his empress is\r\nan Irish lady--the Emperor of Morocco, who is not very well versed in\r\nwhat is going on in this House, has been making inquiries of the most\r\nanxious character as to whether the particular guarantee which the noble\r\nLord was going to enter into included the territory of Morocco; and I\r\nunderstand he has not been able to find it out from the most assiduous\r\nstudy of the Gibraltar newspapers. It so happens that the Governor of\r\nGibraltar--the noble Lord at the head of the Government corrected me the\r\nother night when I called him an irrational man--has issued an ordinance\r\nby which he has entirely suppressed the newspaper press in that town and\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the question, which of the propositions would be most\r\nsecure? I was very much struck by an observation which fell from my hon.\r\nColleague (Mr. M. Gibson) in the course of his speech the other night--a\r\npoint I think very worthy of the attention of the House and of the\r\nGovernment; he said the limitation plan was one which must depend for\r\nits efficacy on the will and fidelity of Russia. I am not one of those\r\nwho believe Russia to be the treacherous and felonious Power which she\r\nis described to be by the press of this country, as she is described by\r\nthe noble Lord to be. I believe the right hon. Baronet the Member for\r\nSouthwark gave her the same character. Although Russia may not be more\r\ntreacherous than other Powers, when you are making a bargain with her,\r\nit is better you should make the efficacy of the terms depend more on\r\nyour own vigilance than on her good faith. The noble Lord the Member for\r\nLondon has admitted that the limitation plan is, after all, an\r\ninefficient one. He said that Russia might get another ship--perhaps\r\nthree or four--and when she had doubled the navy permitted to her,\r\nperhaps the noble Lord would be writing despatches about it, although I\r\nam not sure he would do that. I think it would be holding out a\r\ntemptation to buy Mr. Scott Russell's great ship as one of the eight\r\nships she is to be allowed to keep by the treaty.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for the West Riding remarked that Russia might\r\npurchase vessels of large size from the United States, and still keep\r\nwithin the prescribed limit; but if this great ship, now building in the\r\nThames, should succeed, as I hope she will, Russia might buy her and\r\nsend her into the Black Sea. Somebody says she could not go there\r\nwithout passing the Straits, but, as she is built for mercantile\r\npurposes, that monster vessel might freely be taken up, and then form\r\none of the eight ships allowed to Russia. Another proposition has been\r\nalluded to by the hon. Member for the Tower Hamlets (Sir W. Clay)--that\r\npointed out by the Russian Plenipotentiary--that Russia and Turkey\r\nshould enter into a friendly treaty between themselves and arrange that\r\npoint; but the other diplomatists would not allow it, unless it were\r\ndone under the eyes of the conference and bearing the same features of\r\nforce and compulsion as their proposal of the limitation possessed. I\r\nwas astonished to hear the hon. Baronet, as I understood him, say that,\r\neven although it could be shown that the Russian propositions were\r\nbetter than our own, he thought the proposition which bore on its face\r\ncoercion of Russia was most desirable. A more unstatesman-like and\r\nimmoral view upon a great question between nations I have rarely heard\r\nof. [Sir William Clay rose, and was understood to deny the sentiments\r\nimputed to him by the hon. Member.] I understood my hon. Friend so.\r\nPerhaps he did not mean what I thought he did mean, but that was the\r\nconclusion I came to from his argument, and I do not think he will say I\r\nentirely misrepresented him. It has, however, been said by the press\r\nthat, whether we were sincere or not at the conference, Russia was not.\r\nHon. Gentlemen have read in the _Times_ and other papers blowing\r\nthe flames of war, that from first to last Russia was treacherous and\r\ninsincere. I would put it to the noble Lord the Member for London\r\nwhether he can say that was the case, for I observe he said, in his\r\nspeech in this House on the 23rd of January last, in answer to a\r\nquestion from the hon. Member for Aylesbury, or some other Member--\r\n\r\n  'My hon. Friend will see that by that act the Russian\r\n  Plenipotentiary accepted this interpretation as the basis of\r\n  negotiation, of course reserving to himself the power, when this\r\n  basis shall have been laid down in a definite article, of making\r\n  any observations on the part of his Government which he should\r\n  think proper.'--[3 _Hansard_ cxxxvi. 911]\r\n\r\nOf course the Russian Plenipotentiary, when he accepted it, did so upon\r\nthe understanding that it was the basis of negotiation and discussion,\r\nas no one will deny it was a question capable of being solved in more\r\nways than one, and it was no indication of insincerity for him to refuse\r\nthe precise mode proposed by the Plenipotentiary for England. With\r\nregard to the terms proposed, I should like to read to the House a\r\nstatement I have on very good authority as to the language which Prince\r\nGortchakoff held at Vienna. The statement I have is not to be found in\r\nthe protocols, but I believe it may be relied upon as the precise words\r\nhe used. The noble Lord insisted, as I understand, that it was no\r\nindignity to ask Russia to limit the number of her ships in the Black\r\nSea; but I would submit it is precisely the same in principle as if she\r\nwere asked to limit the amount of her force in the Crimea to four or six\r\nregiments. Prince Gortchakoff said--\r\n\r\n  'To ask from an independent Power that it should limit its force,\r\n  is to assail its rights of sovereignty on its own territory. It\r\n  is with a bad grace that they would sustain the rights of the\r\n  Sultan and wish to attack those of the Emperor of Russia. The\r\n  proposition to render the Black Sea inaccessible to vessels of\r\n  war of all nations is so strange (_si bizarre_) that one is\r\n  astonished to see the fate of nations confided to men such as\r\n  those who have conceived it. How could it be believed that Russia\r\n  would consent to give herself up disarmed at the good pleasure of\r\n  the Napoleons and the Palmerstons, who will be able themselves to\r\n  have armed forces in the Mediterranean?'\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to that. If any diplomatist from this country, under\r\nthe same circumstances as Russia was placed in, had consented to terms\r\nsuch as the noble Lord had endeavoured to force upon Russia--I say, that\r\nif he entered the door of this House, he would be met by one universal\r\nshout of execration, and, as a public man, would be ruined for ever.\r\n\r\nI wish to ask the House this question--whether it has deliberately made\r\nup its mind that this was a proposition which ought to have been imposed\r\nupon Russia? If they have ascertained which is the best--and I rather\r\nthink the general opinion is that the proposition of the Government is\r\nthe worst; but, assuming that it is not so, and that there may be some\r\nlittle difference--I want to know what that difference is, and if there\r\nis any difference which can be measured even by the finest diplomatic\r\nand statesmanlike instrument ever invented, I ask, is that difference\r\nworth to this country the incalculable calamities which a prolonged war\r\nmust bring upon us? I am of opinion that, with the territorial guarantee\r\nand the abolition of the Christian protectorate, either the terms\r\nproposed by the noble Lord or by Prince Gortchakoff would have been as\r\nsecure for Turkey as it is possible under existing circumstances for\r\nTurkey to be by any treaty between the great Powers of Europe. And,\r\nrecollect that we have been thrown a little off the original\r\nproposition, for when that proposition was first agreed to in the\r\nCabinet of Lord Aberdeen I am satisfied in my own mind that it meant\r\nsomething very like that which the Russians themselves have proposed.\r\n\r\nIf we take this first protocol of the conference, and look to the speech\r\nmade by Count Buol and to the proposition he made, you will find the\r\nthird article runs in this language: 'The treaty of July 13, 1841, shall\r\nbe revised with the double object,' and so on. But what is the meaning\r\nof revising the treaty of 1841? The treaty has only one object, which is\r\nto guarantee to the Turk the right he has claimed since his possession\r\nof Constantinople--namely, that the Straits should be closed under the\r\nguarantee of the Powers, except in case of war. Therefore, when the\r\nAberdeen Government, of which the noble Lords were Members, originally\r\nagreed upon these terms, their object was that the Black Sea should be\r\nthrown open, or, at least, that the closing of the Straits should be\r\nrelaxed; and I presume that it was not until after it was known that,\r\nwhile Russia had no objection to the opening of the Straits, Turkey was\r\nvery much opposed to it, that it was found necessary to change the terms\r\nand bring them forward in another form. But, surely, if this be so, the\r\nHouse and the Government should be chary indeed of carrying on a\r\nprolonged war with Russia, Russia having been willing to accept a\r\nproposition made originally by us, and which I believe to be the best\r\nfor Turkey and for the interests of Europe. If, I say, this be so, was\r\nthe Government justified in breaking off these negotiations, because\r\nthat really is the issue which this House is called upon to try? Can\r\nthey obtain better terms? If the terms are sufficient for Turkey they\r\nought not to ask for better ones. I do not say they may not get better\r\nterms. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for the West Riding (Mr.\r\nCobden), that England and France, if they choose to sacrifice 500,000\r\nmen, and to throw away 200,000,000_l_. or 300,000,000_l_. of\r\ntreasure, may dismember the Russian Empire. But I doubt whether this\r\nwould give better terms for Turkey--I am sure it would not give better\r\nterms for England and France. Now, what has it cost to obtain all this?\r\n\r\nAnd here I must be permitted to say one word with regard to the course\r\ntaken by those right hon. Gentlemen who have recently taken their seats\r\non this bench, and whose conduct on this question has been the cause of\r\ngreat debate, and of language which I think the state of the case has\r\nnot wholly justified. I presume it will be admitted that these right\r\nhon. Gentlemen at least know the object of the war as well as any other\r\nmen in this House. I presume, too, that, entertaining as they do a very\r\nserious idea of the results of a prolonged war, they are at liberty to\r\ncome to the conclusion that certain terms, to which they themselves were\r\nparties, are sufficient; and if this be the conviction at which they\r\nhave arrived, surely no Member of this House will say that, because they\r\nwere Members of a Cabinet some time ago which went into this war,\r\ntherefore they should be forbidden to endeavour to avert the\r\nincalculable calamities which threaten their country, but should be\r\nexpected to maintain a show of consistency, for which they must\r\nsacrifice everything that an honest man would hold dear. Have these men\r\ngained anything in popularity with the country, or even with the Members\r\nof this House, by the course they have taken?\r\n\r\nI am almost ashamed to say anything in the defence of those who are so\r\ncapable of explaining and defending their own conduct in this matter;\r\nbut I may be pardoned if I rejoice that men ranking high as statesmen,\r\npowerful by their oratory, distinguished by their long services, have\r\nseparated themselves from that rash, that inexcusable recklessness\r\nwhich, I say, marks the present Government, and are anxious to deliver\r\ntheir country from the dangers which surround it. My hon. Friends below\r\nme--and I am quite sure not one of them will suppose that I speak from\r\nthe mere wish to oppose them in any way; they are personal friends of\r\nmine, and it pains me now to differ from them; but hon. Members seem to\r\nthink, when they are looking a long way off for the objects to be gained\r\nby war, that a man who looks at home is not a friend to his country. Is\r\nwar the only thing a nation enters upon in which the cost is never to be\r\nreckoned? Is it nothing that in twelve months you have sacrificed 20,000\r\nor 30,000 men, who a year ago were your own fellow-citizens, living in\r\nyour midst, and interested, as you are, in all the social and political\r\noccurrences of the day? Is it nothing that, in addition to those lives,\r\na sum of--I am almost afraid to say how much, but 30,000,000_l_. or\r\n40,000,000_l_. will not be beyond the mark--has already been\r\nexpended? And let the House bear in mind this solemn fact--that the four\r\nnations engaged in this war have already lost so many men, that if you\r\nwere to go from Chelsea to Blackwall, and from Highgate and Hampstead to\r\nNorwood, and take every man of a fighting age and put him to death--if\r\nyou did this you would not sacrifice a larger number of lives than have\r\nalready been sacrificed in these twelve months of war.\r\n\r\nYour own troops, as you know, have suffered, during a Crimean winter,\r\ntortures and horrors which the great Florentine hardly imagined when he\r\nwrote his immortal epic. Hon. Members are ready, I know, to say, 'Whose\r\nfault is that?' But if our loss has been less than that of the French,\r\nless than that of the Turks, and less than that of the Russians, it is\r\nfair to assume that, whatever mistakes may have been committed by the\r\nGovernment, the loss in the aggregate would, even under other\r\ncircumstances, have fallen very little short of that which I have\r\nattempted to describe. Are these things to be accounted nothing? We have\r\nhad for twelve years past a gradual reduction of taxation, and there has\r\nbeen an immense improvement in the physical, intellectual, and moral\r\ncondition of the people of this country; while for the last two years we\r\nhave commenced a career of reimposing taxes, have had to apply for a\r\nloan, and no doubt, if this war goes on, extensive loans are still in\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nHon. Members may think this is nothing. They say it is a 'low' view of\r\nthe case. But, these things are the foundation of your national\r\ngreatness, and of your national duration; and you may be following\r\nvisionary phantoms in all parts of the world while your own country is\r\nbecoming rotten within, and calamities may be in store for the monarchy\r\nand the nation of which now, it appears, you take no heed. Every man\r\nconnected with trade knows how much trade has suffered, how much profits\r\nin every branch of trade--except in contracts arising out of the war--\r\nhave diminished, how industry is becoming more precarious and the reward\r\nfor industry less, how the price of food is raised, and how much there\r\nis of a growing pressure of all classes, especially upon the poorest of\r\nthe people--a pressure which by-and-by--not just now, when the popular\r\nfrenzy is lashed into fury morning after morning by the newspapers--\r\n[Murmurs]--but I say by-and-by this discontent will grow rapidly, and\r\nyou (pointing to the Ministerial bench) who now fancy you are fulfilling\r\nthe behests of the national will, will find yourselves pointed to as the\r\nmen who ought to have taught the nation better.\r\n\r\nI will not enter into the question of the harvest. That is in the hand\r\nof Providence, and may Providence grant that the harvest may be as\r\nbountiful as it was last year! But the House must recollect that in\r\n1853, only two years ago, there was the worst harvest that had been\r\nknown for forty years. Prices were very high in consequence. Last year\r\nthe harvest was the greatest ever known, yet prices have been scarcely\r\nlower, and there are not wanting men of great information and of sound\r\njudgment who look with much alarm to what may come--I trust it may not\r\ncome--if we should have, in addition to the calamities of war,\r\ncalamities arising from a scarcity of food, which may be scarcely less\r\ndestructive of the peace and comfort of the population of this country.\r\n\r\nI will ask the House in this state of things whether they are disposed\r\nto place implicit confidence in her Majesty's Ministers? On that (the\r\nOpposition) side of the House there is not, I believe, much confidence\r\nin the Government; and on this side I suspect there are many men who are\r\nwishful that at this critical moment the affairs of the country should\r\nbe under the guidance of men of greater solidity and of better judgment.\r\nI will now point out one or two causes which I think show that I am\r\njustified in placing no confidence whatever in her Majesty's Government.\r\nTake for example what they have been doing with Austria. The noble Lord\r\nat the head of the Government has stated to us that it was of European\r\nimportance that Hungary should be connected with Austria. The noble Lord\r\nthe Member for the City of London said the other night it was of\r\nessential importance that Austria should be preserved as she is--a great\r\nconservative Power in the midst of Europe. Well, but at the same time\r\nthis Government has been urging Austria, month after month, to enter\r\ninto the same ruinous course which they themselves are disposed to\r\npursue. They know perfectly well that if Austria were to join either\r\nwith Russia on the one hand, or with the Western Powers on the other, in\r\nall human probability this great Empire would no longer remain that\r\n'great conservative Power in the midst of Europe,' but would be stripped\r\non the one side of her Italian provinces, and of Hungary on the other;\r\nor, if not stripped of these two portions of the Empire, would be\r\nplunged into an interminable anarchy which would prove destructive of\r\nher power.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more inconsistent than for Ministers to tell us that they\r\nwish Austria to be preserved, and, at the same time, to urge her upon a\r\ncourse which they know perfectly well must end in her disruption, and in\r\nthe destruction of that which they think essential to the balance of\r\npower in Europe? We are told, with regard to our other alliance, that it\r\nis a very delicate topic. It is a very delicate and a very important\r\ntopic; but there is another topic still more delicate and important--\r\nnamely, the future of this country with regard to that alliance. I think\r\nwe have before now spent 1,000,000,000_l_. sterling, more or less,\r\nfor the sake of a French dynasty. At this moment there are French armies\r\nin Rome, in Athens, in Gallipoli, in Constantinople, and in the Crimea,\r\nand the end of all this, I fear, is not yet. It has been repeatedly\r\nstated in this House that the people of France are not themselves\r\nenthusiastic in favour of this war. I would fain hope, whatever else may\r\nhappen, that between the people of England and of France an improved and\r\nfriendly feeling has grown up. But, as far as the war is concerned, your\r\nalliance depends on one life. The present dynasty may be a permanent,\r\nbut it may be an ephemeral one, and I cannot but think that when men are\r\nlooking forward to prolonged warfare they should at least take into\r\nconsideration the ground on which they are standing.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon has told us, with regard to Russia, that Europe was\r\nstanding on a mine, and did not know it. I do not know that he is much\r\nmore acute than other people, but I can fancy that Lord Clarendon, by\r\nthe blunders of his negotiations and the alliances he has endeavoured to\r\nform, has placed this country on a mine far more dangerous and\r\ndestructive than that upon which he thinks Europe was placed by the\r\ncolossal power of Russia. There is another point I have to touch upon.\r\nTo me it was really frightful to hear the noble Lord the Member for\r\nLondon (Lord John Russell) tell the House that we are not lighting for\r\nourselves, but for Germany. I recollect one passage among many in the\r\nnoble Lord's speeches upon this point; and, in looking over what has\r\nbeen said by Ministers, one really wonders that they should have allowed\r\nanything of the kind to appear in _Hansard_. On the 17th of\r\nFebruary last year the noble Lord said,--\r\n\r\n  'They (England and France) feel that the cause is one, in the\r\n  first place, of the independence of Turkey.... It is to maintain\r\n  the independence, not only of Turkey, but of Germany and of all\r\n  European nations.'--[3 _Hansard_, cxxx. 906.]\r\n\r\n['Hear, hear!'] An hon. Member cheers. What a notion a man must have of\r\nthe duties of the 27,000,000 of people living in these islands if he\r\nthinks they ought to come forward as the defenders of the 60,000,000 of\r\npeople in Germany, that the blood of England is not the property of the\r\npeople of England, and that the sacred treasure of the bravery,\r\nresolution, and unfaltering courage of the people of England is to be\r\nsquandered in a contest in which the noble Lord says we have no\r\ninterest, for the preservation of the independence of Germany, and of\r\nthe integrity, civilization, and something else, of all Europe!\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord takes a much better view, as I presume many of us do, of\r\nthings past than of things present. The noble Lord knows that we once\r\ndid go to war for all Europe, but then we went to war with nearly all\r\nEurope, whereas now we are going to war in alliance with France only,\r\nexcept the little State of Sardinia, which we have cajoled or coerced\r\ninto a course which I believe every friend to the freedom of Italy and\r\nto Sardinia will live to regret. All the rest of Europe--Spain,\r\nPortugal, Italy, Austria, Prussia, Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, and\r\nSweden--take no part in the war, and yet our Ministers have--what I\r\nshould call, if I were not in this House, the effrontery and audacity to\r\nget up and tell us that they are fighting the battle of all Europe, and\r\nthat all Europe is leagued with us against the colossal power of Russia.\r\nEurope in the last war did, for the most part, unite with us. We went to\r\nSpain because we were called to go by the patriot Spaniards, but I think\r\nthe Duke of Wellington has stated, in his despatches, that if he had\r\nknown how little assistance would be received from them he would not\r\nhave recommended even that expedition.\r\n\r\nBut now, not only has all Europe not united with you, but other\r\ncountries will not even allow their men to fight with you. You pay the\r\nTurks to fight their own battles, you enlist men in Germany to fight the\r\nbattles of Germany, and the persons engaged in Switzerland and Hamburg\r\nin enlisting men for you are looked upon with suspicion by the\r\nauthorities, and I am not sure that some of them have not even been\r\ntaken into custody. Why, then, should you pretend that all Europe is\r\nleagued against Russia, and that you have authority to fight the battles\r\nof all Europe against Russia, when the greater part of Europe is\r\nstanding by apathetically wondering at the folly you are committing? I\r\nwould appeal to the noble Lord the Member for the Colonies--I beg his\r\npardon, the Member for London--but he has been in so many different\r\npositions lately that it is extremely difficult to identify him. I would\r\nappeal to the noble Lord, because, however much I differ from him, I\r\nhave never yet come to the conclusion that he has not at heart the\r\ninterest of his country, that he is not capable of appreciating a fair\r\nargument when it is laid before him, and that he has not some sense of\r\nthe responsibility as to the political course he takes, and I would ask\r\nhim if there be no other world of kingdoms and of nations but that old\r\nworld of Europe with which the noble Lord is so disposed to entangle\r\nthis country?\r\n\r\nI wish the noble Lord could blot out from his recollection, for a little\r\ntime, William III, and all the remembrance of what has been called by\r\nthe right hon. Member for Buckinghamshire (Mr. Disraeli) 'the Dutch\r\nconquest,' which is supposed to have enthroned the Whig aristocracy in\r\nthis country. I would ask the noble Lord to do this for to-night--for an\r\nhour--for five minutes. There is a country called the United States of\r\nAmerica. Only on Tuesday night the very remarkable circumstance\r\noccurred--and I think the House will be of opinion that it is one worth\r\nnotice--of two of those distinguished men being present and listening to\r\nthe debates in this House who have occupied the position of President of\r\nthe United States; a position, I venture to say, not lower in honour and\r\ndignity than that of any crowned monarch on the surface of the globe.\r\nThe United States is precisely the country which is running with us the\r\nrace of power and of greatness. Its population will, I believe, at the\r\nnext census exceed the population of the United Kingdom; in its\r\nmanufactures and general industry it is by far the most formidable rival\r\nthat the great manufacturers of this country now have to contend with;\r\nit has, I suppose, ten steamers for one steamer of this country; its\r\nmagnificent steamships have crossed the Atlantic in a shorter time than\r\nthe steamships of this country; the finest vessels which are at this\r\nmoment performing the voyage between England and the Australian colonies\r\nhave been built in the United States; therefore, in shipbuilding\r\nindustry the United States not only compete with, but in some respects\r\neven excel, this country. Look at our present position and that of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMay I entreat the attention of this House, for I am not declaiming, I am\r\nnot making a party attack, I am treating of that which, in my mind, is\r\nof vital importance to every family in the kingdom. This year the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer told you that he must have a sum of\r\n86,000,000_l_. in order to carry on the various departments of your\r\nGovernment, and to defray your vast military expenditure. The United\r\nStates has at this moment in her Treasury enough, I think, to pay off\r\nall her debt. Deduct the whole amount of the expenses of the Government\r\nof the United States, not only of the general Government, but also of\r\nthe thirty independent sovereign States, from the 86,000,000_l_. we\r\nare spending, and you will find that at least 70,000,000_l_. will\r\nbe left, which is, therefore, the sum of taxation that we are paying\r\nthis year more than the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nSome hon. Gentlemen know what it is to run a horse that has been\r\nweighted. I heard, the other day, of a horse that won every race in\r\nwhich it started, up to a certain period when it was for the first time\r\nweighted. It then lost the race, and it is reported in the annals of the\r\nturf that it never won a race afterwards. If that be the case with\r\nregard to a horse, it is much more true with regard to a nation. When a\r\nnation has gone a step backwards it is difficult to restore it to its\r\nposition; if another nation has passed it in the race, it is almost\r\nimpossible for it to regain the ground it has lost. I now speak\r\nparticularly to hon. Members opposite, for there are, perhaps, more\r\nGentlemen upon that than upon this side of the House in the happy\r\nposition of owners of vast, productive, beautiful, and, I hope,\r\nunencumbered estates in the various parts of the kingdom. We are now\r\nabout ten days' voyage from the United States, and within ten years we\r\nshall probably communicate with that country by telegraph as quickly as\r\nwe now do with the Crimea. I hope it will be for a much better object.\r\nThe people of the United States are our people, and there are few\r\nfamilies in England which have not friends and relatives connected with\r\nor settled in that country. The inducements for men to remain at home\r\nand their attachment to the place of their birth are necessarily to some\r\nextent weakened by the facility with which they can now travel almost\r\nround the world in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nDo you believe that when the capital of the greatest banking-house in\r\nLombard street can be transferred to the United States on a small piece\r\nof paper in one post, that the imposition of 70,000,000_l_. of\r\ntaxation over and above the taxation of an equal population in the\r\nUnited States will not have the effect of transferring capital from this\r\ncountry to the United States, and, if capital, then trade, population,\r\nand all that forms the bone and sinew of this great Empire? I ask hon.\r\nMembers to remember what fell on a previous evening from the right hon.\r\nGentleman the President of the Board of Works. The right hon. Gentleman\r\ntalked of the war lasting, perhaps, six years with our resources\r\nundiminished. Now, nothing is easier than for a Cornish Baronet,\r\npossessing I am afraid to say how many thousands a year, a Member of a\r\nCabinet, or for all those who are surrounded with every comfort, to look\r\nwith the utmost complacency upon the calamities which may befall others\r\nnot so fortunately situated as themselves. Six years of this war, and\r\nour resources undiminished! Why, Sir, six years of this war, at an\r\nannual expenditure of 70,000,000_l_., give 420,000,000_l_. to\r\nthe side of the United States as against the condition of the people of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nAm I, then, talking of trifles? Am I talking to sane men, that it is\r\nnecessary to bring forward facts like these? I am amazed, when the\r\nnewspaper press, when public speakers, when Gentlemen on both sides of\r\nthis House are so ready to listen and to speak upon questions relating\r\nto Turkey, to Servia, or to Schamyl, that I cannot get the House of\r\nCommons to consider a question so great as the expenditure of\r\n420,000,000_l_., and when we have to consider if we shall trust\r\nthat vast issue in the hands of the noble Lords and right hon. Gentlemen\r\non the Treasury bench.\r\n\r\nI have stated that I have no confidence in the Government, and I will\r\nnow tell the House another reason for that want of confidence. My hon.\r\nFriend the Member for the West Riding, on a previous occasion, treated\r\nthe right hon. President of the Board of Works very summarily; but I\r\nwish to call the attention of the House to what was said by the right\r\nhon. Gentleman in 1850, in the debate which then took place upon the\r\nforeign policy of the noble Lord now his chief. On that occasion the\r\nright hon. Gentleman told the House that the foreign policy of the noble\r\nLord now at the head of the Government had made us hated by every party\r\nin every nation in Europe; he said that the noble Lord had excited the\r\ndisaffected to revolt, and, having brought upon them the vengeance of\r\nthe Governments under which they lived, had then betrayed them. I do not\r\nsay that this is true, but I state it upon the authority of a Minister\r\nnow in the Cabinet of the noble Lord; but, whether true or not, I cannot\r\nhave confidence in the right hon. Gentleman when sitting in a Cabinet to\r\ncarry out the foreign policy of the noble Lord.\r\n\r\nI will take the case of another Minister, and I do not think that when\r\nhe speaks he will call my observations undeserved. A most distinguished\r\nMember of the Government--the Chancellor of the Exchequer--has been\r\ntwice elected within a very short period, once before and once since his\r\nacceptance of office,--I must say that I do not like to see these\r\nchanges, when a man one night sits on one bench and another night on\r\nanother,--on the 8th of February, 1855, the right hon. Gentleman,\r\naddressing his constituents at Radnor, said:--\r\n\r\n  'I am not prepared to give my vote in favour of any change in our\r\n  policy which would attempt to make England a first-rate military\r\n  Power. It seems to me that it would be little short of madness to\r\n  attempt any such gigantic undertaking. It is our true wisdom to\r\n  limit ourselves to that amount of military force which shall\r\n  enable us to defend our own shores, and to protect our great\r\n  dependencies abroad. If we can completely defend our own coasts,\r\n  it appears to me that the objects of our national policy have\r\n  been fulfilled.'\r\n\r\nAnd then, as if he had in view the language of the noble Lord at the\r\nhead of the Government and that of his colleague the Member for London,\r\nhe proceeded to say,--\r\n\r\n  'I wish to see a cessation of that inordinate and senseless\r\n  desire which has been sometimes expressed of late, almost\r\n  usurping the functions of Providence, that we should go to almost\r\n  all parts of the world to redress wrong and to see that right is\r\n  done.'\r\n\r\nI say that the right hon. Gentleman had the language of his colleagues\r\nin view, and when he speaks he will no doubt admit that such was the\r\ncase. For what did the noble Lord the Secretary for the Colonies say\r\nwhen he addressed the baillies and the enthusiastic citizens of\r\nGreenock? He said,--\r\n\r\n  'It is likewise to be considered, and I trust we shall none of us\r\n  forget it, that this country holds an important position among\r\n  the nations of the world--that not once, but many times, she has\r\n  stood forward to resist oppression, to maintain the independence\r\n  of weaker nations, to preserve to the general family of nations\r\n  that freedom, that power of governing themselves, of which others\r\n  have sought to deprive them. I trust that character will not be\r\n  forgotten, will not be abandoned by a people which is now\r\n  stronger in means, which is more populous and more wealthy than\r\n  it ever has been at any former period. This then, you will agree\r\n  with me, is not the period to abandon any of those duties towards\r\n  the world, towards the whole of mankind, which Great Britain has\r\n  hitherto performed.'\r\n\r\nNow let us see what the right hon. Gentleman said, after having accepted\r\nthe office of Chancellor of the Exchequer. The right hon. Gentleman made\r\na speech, and it was just after the death of the late Emperor of Russia,\r\nand, in referring to the new Emperor, he said,--\r\n\r\n  'If, however, it should please this mighty Potentate to continue\r\n  in the course of aggression upon which his father had entered,\r\n  and if our reasonable hopes of a more pacific policy should be\r\n  disappointed, then let him know that in England he will find a\r\n  country prepared to maintain its own rights and the rights of\r\n  other nations.'\r\n\r\nObserve, 'the rights of other nations;' and he goes on,--\r\n\r\n  'A country which, although its army has been placed in a perilous\r\n  position, and has had to undergo the rigours of a Russian winter,\r\n  has its resources unimpaired, has its revenue flourishing, has\r\n  its trade substantially undiminished, has its spirit unbroken,\r\n  and will be prepared, in case of necessity, to vindicate its own\r\n  honour, and to maintain the rights and liberties of Europe.'\r\n\r\nI wish the House to observe what a complete change there is in the\r\nlanguage of the right hon. Gentleman upon these two occasions. Either of\r\nthe two opinions which he expressed may be right, but both of them\r\ncannot be so, and I confess that when I find that a Gentleman says one\r\nthing one day, and a month later, when he comes into office, the exact\r\nopposite, I do not think that I can be expected to have that confidence\r\nin him as to be willing to entrust him with the vast issues depending on\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nI will now refer to a colleague of the right hon. Gentleman--one who has\r\nalso distinguished himself--I mean the First Lord of the Admiralty. That\r\nright hon. Gentleman (Sir C. Wood) has said nothing upon the subject of\r\nthe war, and I have felt that he must entertain great doubts as to its\r\npolicy; but, not very long ago, he also addressed his constituents, and\r\nindulged in very hostile and insulting language towards 'our great and\r\nmagnanimous ally;' but he, too, has changed his mind; and not long ago\r\nhe went down by express train to Folkestone or Dover--I forget which--to\r\nmeet in the most friendly, and probably in the most humble manner, the\r\nvery potentate whom he had formerly abused.\r\n\r\nIf I have disposed of these Gentlemen and shown why I can have no\r\nconfidence in them, are there any better reasons why I should have\r\nconfidence in those two noble Lords who were the active and restless\r\nspirits in the Cabinet which the noble Lord the Member for London\r\noverthrew? I regard those noble Lords as responsible for the policy of\r\nthis war. I am bound to suppose that they acted in accordance with their\r\nconscientious convictions; but, still, the fact of their having embarked\r\nin that policy is no reason why I should have confidence in them. But,\r\nare those two noble Lords men in whom the House and country ought to\r\nplace implicit confidence? What of late could be more remarkable than\r\nthe caprices of the noble Lord the Member for London? When that noble\r\nLord was in the Government of Lord Aberdeen he went to Greenock, I think\r\nto Bedford, and certainly to Bristol--and, in fact, he took every\r\nopportunity which offered itself of bringing himself before the public;\r\nand, with his power of speech, his long experience, and eminent\r\ncharacter, did his utmost to stimulate the feelings of the people to a\r\npolicy which I believe to be destructive, and which I think the majority\r\nof this House in calm moments does not believe to have been the wisest\r\nwhich could have been pursued. It certainly appears to me to be\r\nunjustifiable that, while Lord Aberdeen was honestly endeavouring to\r\nbring the negotiations to a peaceful conclusion, the noble Lord was\r\ntaking a course which rendered statesmanship valueless in conducting the\r\nforeign policy of the nation. The noble Lord, however, at last brought\r\nhis conduct to a climax. The hon. and learned Member for Sheffield (Mr.\r\nRoebuck) came forward as a little David with sling and stone--weapons\r\nwhich he did not even use, but at the sight of which the Whig Goliath\r\nwent howling and vanquished to the back benches.\r\n\r\nI am afraid, Sir, to trust myself to speak of the conduct of the noble\r\nLord on that occasion. I presume that we shall have to wait for the\r\nadvent of that Somersetshire historian, whose coming the noble Lord\r\nexpects, before we know whether his conduct on that occasion was, what\r\nsome persons still call it, treachery to his chief, or whether it arose\r\nfrom that description of moral cowardice which in every man is the death\r\nof all true statesmanship. But in the year 1853 the noble Lord the\r\nMember for London gave me a strong reason why I should feel no\r\nconfidence in his present chief. The House will remember that he then\r\nejected the present First Minister under whom he now serves from the\r\nCabinet of which he himself was then the head, and in the explanation\r\nwhich he made to the House, he told us that men like Lord Grey and Lord\r\nMelbourne, men of age, of authority, and experience, had been able in\r\nsome degree to control his noble Friend, but, that he being younger than\r\nthe noble Lord, and having been a shorter time on the political stage,\r\nhad found it difficult to control him. The description which the noble\r\nLord might give of his colleague is a little like that which we\r\noccasionally see given of a runaway horse--that he got the bit between\r\nhis teeth, and there was no holding him.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord the Member for London was the captain of the State\r\nvessel, and the noble Lord the Member for Tiverton was the mate. But how\r\nis it now? The noble Lord the Member for the City of London has accepted\r\nthe position of mate in the most perilous times, in the most tempestuous\r\nweather, and he goes to sea with no chart on a most dangerous and\r\ninterminable voyage, and with the very reckless captain whom he would\r\nnot trust as mate. Sir, the noble Lord the Member for London has made a\r\ndefence of his conduct at the Conferences at Vienna. I am willing to\r\ngive him credit that he did then honestly intend peace; but I do think\r\nthat when he goes again, and on such a journey, he will do well to leave\r\nsome of his historic knowledge behind him. They were indeed historic\r\nfancies. There is nothing to me so out of place as the comparison which\r\nthe noble Lord made between the limitation of the Russian fleet in the\r\nBlack Sea and the destruction of Dunkirk, or between the condition of\r\nthe Black Sea and that of the lakes of North America. The noble Lord can\r\nnever have heard of the Falls of Niagara. If there were Falls like them\r\nbetween the Black Sea and the Mediterranean the cases would be somewhat\r\nsimilar, for the Russian fleet in the Black Sea would not then be\r\nexposed to the assaults of the vast navies of England or France. When I\r\nallude to this subject, I am reminded of that Welshman whom Shakspeare\r\nimmortalised, who found some analogy between a river in Macedon and a\r\nriver in Monmouth. He knew the name of the river in Monmouth, and he did\r\nnot know the name of the river in Macedon, but he insisted upon the\r\nanalogy between them because there were salmon in both.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, I now come to the noble Lord at the head of the Government. I\r\ndo not complain that he is at the head of the Government. The noble Lord\r\nthe Member for the City of London had thrown everything into such\r\ninextricable and unlooked-for confusion that any one next door to him\r\nmust necessarily occupy the place. But I cannot have confidence in the\r\nnoble Viscount, because I cannot but recollect that in 1850 he received\r\nthe condemnation of his foreign policy in the other House of Parliament;\r\nand in a speech which I shall never forget, the last and one of the best\r\never delivered by the greatest statesman of the time, he received a\r\nsimilar condemnation, and the noble Viscount only escaped condemnation\r\nby a direct vote of this House by the energetic defence of the noble\r\nLord the Member for the City of London, and by the stress laid upon many\r\nMembers on this side of the House. But only six weeks after this the\r\nnoble Lord (Lord J. Russell) presented to the noble Viscount a letter\r\nfrom his Sovereign, which I cannot but think must have cost him much\r\npain, and to which I will not refer further, except to say that I do not\r\nknow how it is possible, if the contents of that letter were true, that\r\neither the noble Lord or the House can be called upon to place implicit\r\nconfidence in the noble Lord the leader of the Government.\r\n\r\nI have observed the noble Viscount's conduct ever since I have had the\r\nhonour of a seat in this House, and the noble Viscount will excuse me if\r\nI state the reason why I have often opposed him. The reason is, that the\r\nnoble Viscount treats all these questions, and the House itself, with\r\nsuch a want of seriousness that it has appeared to me that he has no\r\nserious, or sufficiently serious, conviction of the important business\r\nthat so constantly comes before this House. I regard the noble Viscount\r\nas a man who has experience, but who with experience has not gained\r\nwisdom--as a man who has age, but who, with age, has not the gravity of\r\nage, and who, now occupying the highest seat of power, has--and I say it\r\nwith pain--not appeared influenced by a due sense of the responsibility\r\nthat belongs to that elevated position.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the hands of these two noble Lords. They are the authors\r\nof the war. It lies between them that peace was not made at Vienna upon\r\nsome proper terms. And whatever disasters may be in store for this\r\ncountry or for Europe, they will lie at the doors of these noble Lords.\r\nTheir influence in the Cabinet must be supreme; their influence in this\r\nHouse is necessarily great; and their influence with the country is\r\ngreater than that of any other two statesmen now upon the stage of\r\npolitical life in England. They have carried on the war. They have,\r\nhowever, not yet crippled Russia, although it is generally admitted that\r\nthey have almost destroyed Turkey. They have not yet saved Europe in its\r\nindependence and civilization,--they have only succeeded in convulsing\r\nit. They have not added to the honour and renown of England, but they\r\nhave placed the honour and renown of this country in peril. The country\r\nhas been, I am afraid, the sport of their ancient rivalry, and I should\r\nbe very sorry if it should be the victim of the policy which they have\r\nso long advocated.\r\n\r\nThere is only one other point upon which I will trouble the House, if it\r\nwill give me its attention. These Ministers--the right hon. Member for\r\nSouthwark, the Commissioner of the Board of Works, especially, and\r\nevidently the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I am afraid many other\r\nMembers of this House--seem to think little of taxes. Some Members of\r\nthis House seem to have no patience with me if I speak of the cost of\r\nthe war; but I am obliged to ask its attention to this point. I\r\nrecollect reading in the life of Necker, that an aristocratic lady came\r\nto him when he was Finance Minister of Louis XVI, and asked him to give\r\nher 1,000 crowns from the public treasury--not an unusual demand in\r\nthose days. Necker refused to give the money. The lady started with\r\nastonishment--she had an eye to the vast funds of the State, and she\r\nasked, 'What can 1,000 crowns be to the King?' Necker's answer was,\r\n'Madam! 1,000 crowns are the taxes of a whole village!'\r\n\r\nI ask hon. Gentlemen what are the taxes of a whole village, and what\r\nthey mean? They mean bareness of furniture, of clothing, and of the\r\ntable in many a cottage in Lancashire, in Suffolk, and in Dorsetshire.\r\nThey mean an absence of medical attendance for a sick wife, an absence\r\nof the school pence of three or four little children--hopeless toil to\r\nthe father of a family, penury through his life, a cheerless old age,\r\nand, if I may quote the language of a poet of humble life, at last--'the\r\nlittle bell tolled hastily for the pauper's funeral.' That is what taxes\r\nmean. The hon. Member for Dorsetshire spoke the other night in a manner\r\nrather flippant and hardly respectful to some of us on this question.\r\nBut the labourers of Dorsetshire as well as the weavers and spinners of\r\nLancashire are toiling, and must toil harder, longer, and with smaller\r\nremuneration for every single 100_l_. that you extract in taxes\r\nfrom the people in excess of what is necessary for the just requirements\r\nof the Exchequer of the country. I hope I may be permitted to treat the\r\nquestion on this ground, and I ask the House to recollect that when you\r\nstrike down the children in the cottage you attack also the children in\r\nthe palace. If you darken the lives and destroy the hopes of the humble\r\ndwellers of the country, you also darken the prospects of those children\r\nthe offspring of your Queen, in whom are bound up so much of the\r\ninterests and so much of the hopes of the people of this country. If I\r\ndefend, therefore, the interests of the people on this point, I do not\r\nthe less defend the permanence of the dignity of the Crown.\r\n\r\nWe on this bench are not willing to place ourselves alongside of noble\r\nLords who are for carrying on this war with no definite object and for\r\nan indefinite period, but are ready to take our chance of the verdict of\r\nposterity whether they or we more deserve the character of statesmen in\r\nthe course we have taken on this question. The House must know that the\r\npeople are misled and bewildered, and that if every man in this House,\r\nwho doubts the policy that is being pursued, would boldly say so in this\r\nHouse and out of it, it would not be in the power of the press to\r\nmislead the people as it has done for the last twelve months. If they\r\nare thus misled and bewildered, is it not the duty of this House to\r\nspeak with the voice of authority in this hour of peril? We are the\r\ndepositaries of the power and the guardians of the interests of a great\r\nnation and of an ancient monarchy. Why should we not fully measure our\r\nresponsibility? Why should we not disregard the small-minded ambition\r\nthat struggles for place? and why should we not, by a faithful, just,\r\nand earnest policy, restore, as I believe we may, tranquillity to Europe\r\nand prosperity to the country so dear to us?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER OF JOHN BRIGHT\r\nTO ABSALOM WATKIN\r\nON THE RUSSIAN WAR\r\n\r\n[This letter was originally published with notes containing extracts\r\nfrom those authorities which confirmed the writer's views. The text of\r\nthese notes has been omitted, but the references have been retained. It\r\nhas been thought desirable to reprint this letter, as explaining the\r\npolicy which Mr. Bright thought it his duty to recommend--a policy which\r\nwas as wise and just as it was unfortunately unpopular.--J. E. T. R.]\r\n\r\n[Mr. Absalom Watkin, of Manchester, having invited Mr. Bright to a\r\nmeeting about to be held in that city on behalf of the Patriotic Fund,\r\nand having stated that in his opinion the present war was justified by\r\nthe authority of _Vattel_, Mr. Bright replied in the subjoined\r\nletter.]\r\n\r\nI think, on further consideration, you will perceive that the meeting on\r\nThursday next would be a most improper occasion for a discussion as to\r\nthe justice of the war. Just or unjust, the war is a fact, and the men\r\nwhose lives are miserably thrown away in it have clearly a claim upon\r\nthe country, and especially upon those who, by the expression of\r\nopinions favourable to the war, have made themselves responsible for it.\r\nI cannot, therefore, for a moment appear to discourage the liberality of\r\nthose who believe the war to be just, and whose utmost generosity, in my\r\nopinion, will make but a wretched return for the ruin they have brought\r\nupon hundreds of families.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the war itself, I am not surprised at the difference\r\nbetween your opinion and mine, if you decide a question of this nature\r\nby an appeal to _Vattel_. The 'law of nations' is not my law, and\r\nat best it is a code full of confusion and contradictions, having its\r\nfoundation on custom, and not on a higher morality; and on custom which\r\nhas always been determined by the will of the strongest. It may be a\r\nquestion of some interest whether the first crusade was in accordance\r\nwith the law and principles of _Vattel_; but whether the first\r\ncrusade was just, and whether the policy of the crusades was a wise\r\npolicy, is a totally different question. I have no doubt that the\r\nAmerican war was a just war according to the principles laid down by\r\nwriters on the 'law of nations,' and yet no man in his senses in this\r\ncountry will now say that the policy of George III. towards the American\r\ncolonies was a wise policy, or that war a righteous war. The French war,\r\ntoo, was doubtless just according to the same authorities; for there\r\nwere fears and anticipated dangers to be combatted, and law and order to\r\nbe sustained in Europe; and yet few intelligent men now believe the\r\nFrench war to have been either necessary or just. You must excuse me if\r\nI refuse altogether to pin my faith upon _Vattel_. There have been\r\nwriters on international law who have attempted to show that private\r\nassassination and the poisoning of wells were justifiable in war: and\r\nperhaps it would be difficult to demonstrate wherein these horrors\r\ndiffer from some of the practices which are now in vogue. I will not ask\r\nyou to mould your opinion on these points by such writers, nor shall I\r\nsubmit my judgment to that of _Vattel_.\r\n\r\nThe question of this present war is in two parts--first, was it\r\nnecessary for us to interfere by arms in a dispute between the Russians\r\nand the Turks; and secondly, having determined to interfere, under\r\ncertain circumstances, why was not the whole question terminated when\r\nRussia accepted the Vienna note? The seat of war is three thousand miles\r\naway from us. We had not been attacked--not even insulted in any way.\r\nTwo independent Governments had a dispute, and we thrust ourselves into\r\nthe quarrel. That there was some ground for the dispute is admitted by\r\nthe four Powers in the proposition of the Vienna note. [Footnote:\r\nColonel Rose to Lord John Russell, March 7, 1853--Blue Book, part i. p.\r\n87. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to the Earl of Clarendon., April 9 and\r\nMay 22, 1853--Ibid, part i. pp. 127 and 235. Lord John Russell to Sir G.\r\nH.

Lord\r\nCarlisle's Diary in Turkish and Greek Waters, p. 181.] But for the\r\nEnglish Minister at Constantinople and the Cabinet at home the dispute\r\nwould have settled itself, and the last note of Prince Menchikoff would\r\nhave been accepted, and no human being can point out any material\r\ndifference between that note and the Vienna note, afterwards agreed upon\r\nand recommended by the Governments of England, France, Austria and\r\nPrussia. But our Government would not allow the dispute to be settled.\r\nLord Stratford de Redcliffe held private interviews with the Sultan--did\r\nhis utmost to alarm him--insisted on his rejection of all terms of\r\naccommodation with Russia, and promised him the armed assistance of\r\nEngland if war should arise. [Footnote: Lord Stratford to the Earl of\r\nClarendon, May 19, 1853. See, however, a despatch of May 10--Blue Book,\r\npart i. p. 213.]\r\n\r\nThe Turks rejected the Russian note, and the Russians crossed the Pruth,\r\noccupying the Principalities as a 'material guarantee.' I do not defend\r\nthis act of Russia: it has always appeared to me impolitic and immoral;\r\nbut I think it likely it could be well defended out of _Vattel_,\r\nand it is at least as justifiable as the conduct of Lord John Russell\r\nand Lord Palmerston in 1850, when they sent ten or twelve ships of war\r\nto the Piraeus, menacing the town with a bombardment if the dishonest\r\npecuniary claims made by Don Pacifico were not at once satisfied.\r\n[Footnote: Count Nesselrode to Baron Brunnow, February, 1850.]\r\n\r\nBut the passage of the Pruth was declared by England and France and\r\nTurkey not to be a _casus belli_. Negotiations were commenced at\r\nVienna, and the celebrated Vienna note was drawn up. This note had its\r\norigin in Paris [Footnote: Earl of Westmorland to Lord Clarendon, July\r\n25, 1853--Blue Book, part ii. p. 19.], was agreed to by the Conference\r\nat Vienna, ratified and approved by the Cabinets of Paris and London\r\n[Footnote: Earl of Clarendon to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, August 2,\r\n1853--Blue Book, part ii. p. 27. Lord Cowley to Lord Clarendon, August\r\n4, 1853--Ibid, part ii. p. 37.], and pronounced by all these authorities\r\nto be such as would satisfy the honour of Russia, and at the same time\r\nbe compatible with the 'independence and integrity' of Turkey and the\r\nhonour of the Sultan. Russia accepted this note at once [Footnote: Sir\r\nG. H. Seymour to the Earl of Clarendon, August 5, 1853--Blue Book, part\r\nii. p. 43. Count Nesselrode, August 6, 1853--Ibid, part ii. p. 46.],--\r\naccepted it, I believe, by telegraph, even before the precise words of\r\nit had been received in St. Petersburgh [Footnote: Sir G. H. Seymour to\r\nLord Clarendon, August 12, 1853--Blue Book, part ii. p. 50. Count\r\nNesselrode to Baron Meyendorff, September 7, 1853--Ibid, part ii. p.\r\n101.]. Everybody thought the question now settled; a Cabinet Minister\r\nassured me we should never hear another word about it; 'the whole thing\r\nis at an end,' he said, and so it appeared for a moment. But the Turk\r\nrefused the note which had been drawn up by his own arbitrators, and\r\nwhich Russia had accepted [Footnote: Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to the\r\nEarl of Clarendon, August 13, 1853--Blue Book, part iv. p. 69. Lord\r\nStratford to the Earl of Clarendon, August 14, 1853--Ibid, part ii. p.\r\n71.]. And what did the Ministers say then, and what did their organ, the\r\n_Times_, say? They said it was merely a difference about words; it\r\nwas a pity the Turk made any difficulty, but it would soon be settled\r\n[Footnote: Lord Cowley to Lord Clarendon, from Paris, September 2, 1853--\r\nBlue Book, part iv. p. 87. Lord Clarendon to Lord Stratford de\r\nRedcliffe, September 10, 1853--Ibid, part iv. p. 95. The _Times_,\r\nSeptember 17, 1853.]. But it was not settled, and why not? It is said\r\nthat the Russian Government put an improper construction on the Vienna\r\nnote. But it is unfortunate for those who say this, that the Turk placed\r\nprecisely the same construction upon it; and further, it is upon record\r\nthat the French Government advised the Russian Government to accept it,\r\non the ground that 'its general sense differed in nothing from the sense\r\nof the proposition of Prince Menchikoff.' [Footnote: Earl of Clarendon\r\nto the Earl of Westmoreland, July 25, 1853--Blue Book, part ii. p. 1.\r\nCount Nesselrode's Memorandum of March 2, 1854, in the _Journal des\r\nDebats_.] It is, however, easy to see why the Russian Government\r\nshould, when the Turks refused the award of their own arbitrators, re-\r\nstate its original claim, that it might not be damaged by whatever\r\nconcession it had made in accepting the award; and this is evidently the\r\nexplanation of the document issued by Count Nesselrode, and about which\r\nso much has been said. But, after this, the Emperor of Russia spoke to\r\nLord Westmoreland on the subject at Olmutz, and expressed his readiness\r\nto accept the Vienna note, with any clause which the Conference might\r\nadd to it, explaining and restricting its meaning; [Footnote: Lord\r\nWestmoreland to Lord Clarendon, September 28, 1853--Blue Book, part ii.\r\np. 129. Lord Cowley to Lord Clarendon, October 4, 1853--Ibid, part ii.\r\np. 131. Lord Clarendon to Lord Cowley, October 7, 1853--Ibid, part ii.\r\np. 140. Lord Clarendon to Lord A. Loftus--Ibid, part ii. p. 132.] and he\r\nurged that this should be done at once, as he was anxious that his\r\ntroops should re-cross the Pruth before winter. [Footnote: Earl of\r\nWestmoreland, September 14, 1853--Blue Book, part ii. p. 106.] It was in\r\nthis very week that the Turks summoned a grand council, and, contrary to\r\nthe advice of England and France, determined on a declaration of war.\r\n[Footnote: Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, September 26, 1853--Blue Book,\r\npart ii. p. 130. M. Drouyn de Lhuys to Count Walewski, October 4, 1853--\r\nIbid, part ii. p. 136.]\r\n\r\nNow, observe the course taken by our Government. They agreed to the\r\nVienna note; not fewer than five Members of this Cabinet have filled the\r\noffice of Foreign Secretary, and therefore may be supposed capable of\r\ncomprehending its meaning: it was a note drawn up by the friends of\r\nTurkey, and by arbitrators self-constituted on behalf of Turkey; they\r\nurged its acceptance on the Russian Government, and the Russian\r\nGovernment accepted it; there was then a dispute about its precise\r\nmeaning, and Russia agreed, and even proposed that the arbitrators at\r\nVienna should amend it, by explaining it, and limiting its meaning, so\r\nthat no question of its intention should henceforth exist. But, the\r\nTurks having rejected it, our Government turned round, and declared the\r\nVienna note, their own note, entirely inadmissible, and defended the\r\nconduct of the Turks in having rejected it. The Turks declared war,\r\nagainst the advice of the English and French Governments [Footnote: Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe, September 20, 1853--Blue Book, part ii. pp. 149,\r\n151. Lord Clarendon, October 24, 1853--Ibid, part ii. p. 131. Lord\r\nStratford, November 17, 1853--Ibid, part ii. pp. 271, 281. Lord\r\nStratford--Ibid, part ii. p. 288. Lord Clarendon to Lord Stratford,\r\nNovember 8, 1853--Ibid, part ii. p. 219.]--so, at least, it appears from\r\nthe Blue Books; but the moment war was declared by Turkey, our\r\nGovernment openly applauded it. England, then, was committed to the war.\r\nShe had promised armed assistance to Turkey--a country without\r\ngovernment [Footnote: Lord Clarendon to Lord Stratford--Blue Book, part\r\ni. pp. 81, 82. Lord Stratford to M. E. Pisani, June 22, 1853--Ibid, part\r\ni. p. 383. The same to the same, July 4--Ibid, part i. pp. 383, 384.],\r\nand whose administration was at the mercy of contending factions; and\r\nincapable of fixing a policy for herself, she allowed herself to be\r\ndragged on by the current of events at Constantinople. She 'drifted,' as\r\nLord Clarendon said, exactly describing his own position, into the war,\r\napparently without rudder and without compass.\r\n\r\nThe whole policy of our Government in this matter is marked with an\r\nimbecility perhaps without example. I will not say they intended a war\r\nfrom the first, though there are not wanting many evidences that war was\r\nthe object of at least a section of the Cabinet. A distinguished Member\r\nof the House of Commons said to a friend of mine, immediately after the\r\naccession of the present Government to office, 'You have a war Ministry,\r\nand you will have a war.' But I leave this question to point out the\r\ndisgraceful feebleness of the Cabinet, if I am to absolve them from the\r\nguilt of having sought occasion for war. They promised the Turk armed\r\nassistance on conditions, or without conditions. They, in concert with\r\nFrance, Austria, and Prussia, took the original dispute out of the hands\r\nof Russia and Turkey, and formed themselves into a court of arbitration\r\nin the interests of Turkey; they made an award, which they declared to\r\nbe safe and honourable for both parties; this award was accepted by\r\nRussia and rejected by Turkey; and they then turned round upon their own\r\naward, declared it to be 'totally inadmissible,' and made war upon the\r\nvery country whose Government, at their suggestion and urgent\r\nrecommendation, had frankly accepted it. At this moment England is\r\nengaged in a murderous warfare with Russia, although the Russian\r\nGovernment accepted her own terms of peace, and has been willing to\r\naccept them in the sense of England's own interpretation of them ever\r\nsince they were offered; and at the same time England is allied with\r\nTurkey, whose Government rejected the award of England, and who entered\r\ninto the war in opposition to the advice of England. Surely, when the\r\nVienna note was accepted by Russia, the Turks should have been prevented\r\nfrom going to war, or should have been allowed to go to war at their own\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing here of the fact that all these troubles have sprung\r\nout of the demands made by France upon the Turkish Government, and urged\r\nin language more insulting than any which has been shown to have been\r\nused by Prince Menchikoff [Footnote: Col. Rose to the Earl of\r\nMalmesbury, November 20, 1852--Blue Book, part i. p. 49. Lord J. Russell\r\nto Lord Cowley, January 28, 1853--Ibid, part i. p. 67.]. I have said\r\nnothing of the diplomatic war which has been raging for many years past\r\nin Constantinople, and in which England has been behind no other Power\r\nin attempting to subject the Porte to foreign influences [Footnote: Blue\r\nBook--Correspondence respecting the Condition of Protestants in Turkey,\r\n1841-51, pp. 5-8.] I have said nothing of the abundant evidence there is\r\nthat we are not only at war with Russia, but with all the Christian\r\npopulation of the Turkish Empire, and that we are building up our\r\nEastern policy on a false foundation--namely, on the perpetual\r\nmaintenance of the most immoral and filthy of all despotisms over one of\r\nthe fairest portions of the earth which it has desolated, and over a\r\npopulation it has degraded but has not been able to destroy. I have said\r\nnothing of the wretched delusion that we are fighting for civilization\r\nin supporting the Turk against the Russian and against the subject\r\nChristian population of Turkey. I have said nothing about our pretended\r\nsacrifices for freedom in this war, in which our great and now dominant\r\nally is a monarch who, last in Europe, struck down a free constitution,\r\nand dispersed by military violence a national Representative Assembly.\r\n\r\nMy doctrine would have been non-intervention in this case. The danger of\r\nthe Russian power was a phantom [Footnote: 'There never has been a great\r\nState whose power for external aggression has been more overrated than\r\nRussia. She may be impregnable within her own boundaries, BUT SHE IS\r\nNEARLY POWERLESS FOR ANY PURPOSE OF OFFENCE.'--_Lord Palmerston, in\r\nthe House of Commons_, 1853.]; the necessity of permanently upholding\r\nthe Mahometan rule in Europe is an absurdity. Our love for civilization,\r\nwhen we subject the Greeks and Christians to the Turks, is a sham; and\r\nour sacrifices for freedom, when working out the behests of the Emperor\r\nof the French and coaxing Austria to help us, is a pitiful imposture.\r\nThe evils of non-intervention were remote and vague, and could neither\r\nbe weighed nor described in any accurate terms. The good we can judge\r\nsomething of already, by estimating the cost of a contrary policy. And\r\nwhat is that cost? War in the north and south of Europe, threatening to\r\ninvolve every country of Europe. Many, perhaps fifty millions sterling,\r\nin the course of expenditure by this country alone, to be raised from\r\nthe taxes of a people whose extrication from ignorance and poverty can\r\nonly be hoped for from the continuance of peace. The disturbance of\r\ntrade throughout the world, the derangement of monetary affairs, and\r\ndifficulties and ruin to thousands of families. Another year of high\r\nprices of food, notwithstanding a full harvest in England, chiefly\r\nbecause war interferes with imports, and we have declared our principal\r\nforeign food-growers to be our enemies. The loss of human life to an\r\nenormous extent. Many thousands of our own countrymen have already\r\nperished of pestilence and in the field; and hundreds, perhaps\r\nthousands, of English families will be plunged into sorrow, as a part of\r\nthe penalty to be paid for the folly of the nation and its rulers.\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes for the 'inquisition for blood,' who shall answer\r\nfor these things? You have read the tidings from the Crimea; you have,\r\nperhaps, shuddered at the slaughter; you remember the terrific picture,--\r\nI speak not of the battle, and the charge, and the tumultuous\r\nexcitement of the conflict, but of the field after the battle--Russians,\r\nin their frenzy or their terror, shooting Englishmen who would have\r\noffered them water to quench their agony of thirst; Englishmen, in\r\ncrowds, rifling the pockets of the men they had slain or wounded, taking\r\ntheir few shillings or roubles, and discovering among the plunder of the\r\nstiffening corpses images of the 'Virgin and the Child.' You have read\r\nthis, and your imagination has followed the fearful details. This is\r\nwar,--every crime which human nature can commit or imagine, every\r\nhorror it can perpetrate or suffer; and this it is which our Christian\r\nGovernment recklessly plunges into, and which so many of our countrymen\r\nat this moment think it patriotic to applaud! You must excuse me if I\r\ncannot go with you. I will have no part in this terrible crime. My hands\r\nshall be unstained with the blood which is being shed. The necessity of\r\nmaintaining themselves in office may influence an administration;\r\ndelusions may mislead a people; _Vattel_ may afford you a law and a\r\ndefence; but no respect for men who form a Government, no regard I have\r\nfor 'going with the stream,' and no fear of being deemed wanting in\r\npatriotism, shall influence me in favour of a policy which, in my\r\nconscience, I believe to be as criminal before God as it is destructive\r\nof the true interest of my country.\r\n\r\nI have only to ask you to forgive me for writing so long a letter. You\r\nhave forced it from me, and I would not have written it did I not so\r\nmuch appreciate your sincerity and your good intentions towards me.\r\n\r\nBelieve me to be, very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nJOHN BRIGHT.\r\n\r\nOctober 29.",
