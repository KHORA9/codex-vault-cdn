The grief of the nation is still fresh. It finds\r\nsome solace in the consideration that he lived to enjoy the highest\r\nproof of its confidence by entering on the renewed term of the Chief\r\nMagistracy to which he had been elected; that he brought the civil war\r\nsubstantially to a close; that his loss was deplored in all parts of\r\nthe Union, and that foreign nations have rendered justice to his\r\nmemory. His removal cast upon me a heavier weight of cares than ever\r\ndevolved upon any one of his predecessors. To fulfill my trust I need\r\nthe support and confidence of all who are associated with me in the\r\nvarious departments of Government and the support and confidence of the\r\npeople. There is but one way in which I can hope to gain their\r\nnecessary aid. It is to state with frankness the principles which guide\r\nmy conduct, and their application to the present state of affairs, well\r\naware that the efficiency of my labors will in a great measure depend\r\non your and their undivided approbation.\r\n\r\nThe Union of the United States of America was intended by its authors\r\nto last as long as the States themselves shall last. \"The Union shall\r\nbe perpetual\" are the words of the Confederation. \"To form a more\r\nperfect Union,\" by an ordinance of the people of the United States, is\r\nthe declared purpose of the Constitution. The hand of Divine Providence\r\nwas never more plainly visible in the affairs of men than in the\r\nframing and the adopting of that instrument. It is beyond comparison\r\nthe greatest event in American history, and, indeed, is it not of all\r\nevents in modern times the most pregnant with consequences for every\r\npeople of the earth? The members of the Convention which prepared it\r\nbrought to their work the experience of the Confederation, of their\r\nseveral States, and of other republican governments, old and new; but\r\nthey needed and they obtained a wisdom superior to experience. And when\r\nfor its validity it required the approval of a people that occupied a\r\nlarge part of a continent and acted separately in many distinct\r\nconventions, what is more wonderful than that, after earnest contention\r\nand long discussion, all feelings and all opinions were ultimately\r\ndrawn in one way to its support? The Constitution to which life was\r\nthus imparted contains within itself ample resources for its own\r\npreservation. It has power to enforce the laws, punish treason, and\r\ninsure domestic tranquillity. In case of the usurpation of the\r\ngovernment of a State by one man or an oligarchy, it becomes a duty of\r\nthe United States to make good the guaranty to that State of a\r\nrepublican form of government, and so to maintain the homogeneousness\r\nof all. Does the lapse of time reveal defects? A simple mode of\r\namendment is provided in the Constitution itself, so that its\r\nconditions can always be made to conform to the requirements of\r\nadvancing civilization. No room is allowed even for the thought of a\r\npossibility of its coming to an end. And these powers of\r\nself-preservation have always been asserted in their complete integrity\r\nby every patriotic Chief Magistrate by Jefferson and Jackson not less\r\nthan by Washington and Madison. The parting advice of the Father of his\r\nCountry, while yet President, to the people of the United States was\r\nthat the free Constitution, which was the work of their hands, might be\r\nsacredly maintained; and the inaugural words of President Jefferson\r\nheld up \"the preservation of the General Government in its whole\r\nconstitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and\r\nsafety abroad.\" The Constitution is the work of \"the people of the\r\nUnited States,\" and it should be as indestructible as the people.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that the framers of the Constitution, which had no\r\nmodel in the past, should not have fully comprehended the excellence of\r\ntheir own work. Fresh from a struggle against arbitrary power, many\r\npatriots suffered from harassing fears of an absorption of the State\r\ngovernments by the General Government, and many from a dread that the\r\nStates would break away from their orbits. But the very greatness of\r\nour country should allay the apprehension of encroachments by the\r\nGeneral Government. The subjects that come unquestionably within its\r\njurisdiction are so numerous that it must ever naturally refuse to be\r\nembarrassed by questions that lie beyond it. Were it otherwise the\r\nExecutive would sink beneath the burden, the channels of justice would\r\nbe choked, legislation would be obstructed by excess, so that there is\r\na greater temptation to exercise some of the functions of the General\r\nGovernment through the States than to trespass on their rightful\r\nsphere. The \"absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority\"\r\nwas at the beginning of the century enforced by Jefferson as \"the vital\r\nprinciple of republics;\" and the events of the last four years have\r\nestablished, we will hope forever, that there lies no appeal to force.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the Union brings with it \"the support of the State\r\ngovernments in all their rights,\" but it is not one of the rights of\r\nany State government to renounce its own place in the Union or to\r\nnullify the laws of the Union. The largest liberty is to be maintained\r\nin the discussion of the acts of the Federal Government, but there is\r\nno appeal from its laws except to the various branches of that\r\nGovernment itself, or to the people, who grant to the members of the\r\nlegislative and of the executive departments no tenure but a limited\r\none, and in that manner always retain the powers of redress.\r\n\r\n\"The sovereignty of the States\" is the language of the Confederacy, and\r\nnot the language of the Constitution. The latter contains the emphatic\r\nwords--This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall\r\nbe made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall be\r\nmade under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law\r\nof the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\r\nanything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding. Certainly the Government of the United States is a\r\nlimited government, and so is every State government a limited\r\ngovernment. With us this idea of limitation spreads through every form\r\nof administration--general, State, and municipal--and rests on the\r\ngreat distinguishing principle of the recognition of the rights of man.\r\nThe ancient republics absorbed the individual in the state--prescribed\r\nhis religion and controlled his activity. The American system rests on\r\nthe assertion of the equal right of every man to life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness, to freedom of conscience, to the culture and\r\nexercise of all his faculties. As a consequence the State government is\r\nlimited--as to the General Government in the interest of union, as to\r\nthe individual citizen in the interest of freedom.\r\n\r\nStates, with proper limitations of power, are essential to the\r\nexistence of the Constitution of the United States. At the very\r\ncommencement, when we assumed a place among the powers of the earth,\r\nthe Declaration of Independence was adopted by States; so also were the\r\nArticles of Confederation: and when \"the people of the United States\"\r\nordained and established the Constitution it was the assent of the\r\nStates, one by one, which gave it vitality. In the event, too, of any\r\namendment to the Constitution, the proposition of Congress needs the\r\nconfirmation of States. Without States one great branch of the\r\nlegislative government would be wanting. And if we look beyond the\r\nletter of the Constitution to the character of our country, its\r\ncapacity for comprehending within its jurisdiction a vast continental\r\nempire is due to the system of States. The best security for the\r\nperpetual existence of the States is the \"supreme authority\" of the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The perpetuity of the Constitution\r\nbrings with it the perpetuity of the States; their mutual relation\r\nmakes us what we are, and in our political system their connection is\r\nindissoluble. The whole can not exist without the parts, nor the parts\r\nwithout the whole. So long as the Constitution of the United States\r\nendures, the States will endure. The destruction of the one is the\r\ndestruction of the other; the preservation of the one is the\r\npreservation of the other.\r\n\r\nI have thus explained my views of the mutual relations of the\r\nConstitution and the States, because they unfold the principles on\r\nwhich I have sought to solve the momentous questions and overcome the\r\nappalling difficulties that met me at the very commencement of my\r\nAdministration. It has been my steadfast object to escape from the sway\r\nof momentary passions and to derive a healing policy from the\r\nfundamental and unchanging principles of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI found the States suffering from the effects of a civil war.\r\nResistance to the General Government appeared to have exhausted itself.\r\nThe United States had recovered possession of their forts and arsenals,\r\nand their armies were in the occupation of every State which had\r\nattempted to secede. Whether the territory within the limits of those\r\nStates should be held as conquered territory, under military authority\r\nemanating from the President as the head of the Army, was the first\r\nquestion that presented itself for decision.\r\n\r\nNow military governments, established for an indefinite period, would\r\nhave offered no security for the early suppression of discontent, would\r\nhave divided the people into the vanquishers and the vanquished, and\r\nwould have envenomed hatred rather than have restored affection. Once\r\nestablished, no precise limit to their continuance was conceivable.\r\nThey would have occasioned an incalculable and exhausting expense.\r\nPeaceful emigration to and from that portion of the country is one of\r\nthe best means that can be thought of for the restoration of harmony,\r\nand that emigration would have been prevented; for what emigrant from\r\nabroad, what industrious citizen at home, would place himself willingly\r\nunder military rule? The chief persons who would have followed in the\r\ntrain of the Army would have been dependents on the General Government\r\nor men who expected profit from the miseries of their erring\r\nfellow-citizens. The powers of patronage and rule which would have been\r\nexercised under the President, over a vast and populous and naturally\r\nwealthy region are greater than, unless under extreme necessity, I\r\nshould be willing to intrust to any one man. They are such as, for\r\nmyself, I could never, unless on occasions of great emergency, consent\r\nto exercise. The willful use of such powers, if continued through a\r\nperiod of years, would have endangered the purity of the general\r\nadministration and the liberties of the States which remained loyal.\r\n\r\nBesides, the policy of military rule over a conquered territory would\r\nhave implied that the States whose inhabitants may have taken part in\r\nthe rebellion had by the act of those inhabitants ceased to exist. But\r\nthe true theory is that all pretended acts of secession were from the\r\nbeginning null and void. The States can not commit treason nor screen\r\nthe individual citizens who may have committed treason any more than\r\nthey can make valid treaties or engage in lawful commerce with any\r\nforeign power. The States attempting to secede placed themselves in a\r\ncondition where their vitality was impaired, but not extinguished;\r\ntheir functions suspended, but not destroyed.\r\n\r\nBut if any State neglects or refuses to perform its offices there is\r\nthe more need that the General Government should maintain all its\r\nauthority and as soon as practicable resume the exercise of all its\r\nfunctions. On this principle I have acted, and have gradually and\r\nquietly, and by almost imperceptible steps, sought to restore the\r\nrightful energy of the General Government and of the States. To that\r\nend provisional governors have been appointed for the States,\r\nconventions called, governors elected, legislatures assembled, and\r\nSenators and Representatives chosen to the Congress of the United\r\nStates. At the same time the courts of the United States, as far as\r\ncould be done, have been reopened, so that the laws of the United\r\nStates may be enforced through their agency. The blockade has been\r\nremoved and the custom-houses reestablished in ports of entry, so that\r\nthe revenue of the United States may be collected. The Post-Office\r\nDepartment renews its ceaseless activity, and the General Government is\r\nthereby enabled to communicate promptly with its officers and agents.\r\nThe courts bring security to persons and property; the opening of the\r\nports invites the restoration of industry and commerce; the post-office\r\nrenews the facilities of social intercourse and of business. And is it\r\nnot happy for us all that the restoration of each one of these\r\nfunctions of the General Government brings with it a blessing to the\r\nStates over which they are extended? Is it not a sure promise of\r\nharmony and renewed attachment to the Union that after all that has\r\nhappened the return of the General Government is known only as a\r\nbeneficence?\r\n\r\nI know very well that this policy is attended with some risk; that for\r\nits success it requires at least the acquiescence of the States which\r\nit concerns; that it implies an invitation to those States, by renewing\r\ntheir allegiance to the United States, to resume their functions as\r\nStates of the Union. But it is a risk that must be taken. In the choice\r\nof difficulties it is the smallest risk; and to diminish and if\r\npossible to remove all danger, I have felt it incumbent on me to assert\r\none other power of the General Government--the power of pardon. As no\r\nState can throw a defense over the crime of treason, the power of\r\npardon is exclusively vested in the executive government of the United\r\nStates. In exercising that power I have taken every precaution to\r\nconnect it with the clearest recognition of the binding force of the\r\nlaws of the United States and an unqualified acknowledgment of the\r\ngreat social change of condition in regard to slavery which has grown\r\nout of the war.\r\n\r\nThe next step which I have taken to restore the constitutional\r\nrelations of the States has been an invitation to them to participate\r\nin the high office of amending the Constitution. Every patriot must\r\nwish for a general amnesty at the earliest epoch consistent with public\r\nsafety. For this great end there is need of a concurrence of all\r\nopinions and the spirit of mutual conciliation. All parties in the late\r\nterrible conflict must work together in harmony. It is not too much to\r\nask, in the name of the whole people, that on the one side the plan of\r\nrestoration shall proceed in conformity with a willingness to cast the\r\ndisorders of the past into oblivion, and that on the other the evidence\r\nof sincerity in the future maintenance of the Union shall be put beyond\r\nany doubt by the ratification of the proposed amendment to the\r\nConstitution, which provides for the abolition of slavery forever\r\nwithin the limits of our country. So long as the adoption of this\r\namendment is delayed, so long will doubt and jealousy and uncertainty\r\nprevail. This is the measure which will efface the sad memory of the\r\npast; this is the measure which will most certainly call population and\r\ncapital and security to those parts of the Union that need them most.\r\nIndeed, it is not too much to ask of the States which are now resuming\r\ntheir places in the family of the Union to give this pledge of\r\nperpetual loyalty and peace. Until it is done the past, however much we\r\nmay desire it, will not be forgotten, The adoption of the amendment\r\nreunites us beyond all power of disruption; it heals the wound that is\r\nstill imperfectly closed: it removes slavery, the element which has so\r\nlong perplexed and divided the country; it makes of us once more a\r\nunited people, renewed and strengthened, bound more than ever to mutual\r\naffection and support.\r\n\r\nThe amendment to the Constitution being adopted, it would remain for\r\nthe States whose powers have been so long in abeyance to resume their\r\nplaces in the two branches of the National Legislature, and thereby\r\ncomplete the work of restoration. Here it is for you, fellow-citizens\r\nof the Senate, and for you, fellow-citizens of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to judge, each of you for yourselves, of the\r\nelections, returns, and qualifications of your own members.\r\n\r\nThe full assertion of the powers of the General Government requires the\r\nholding of circuit courts of the United States within the districts\r\nwhere their authority has been interrupted. In the present posture of\r\nour public affairs strong objections have been urged to holding those\r\ncourts in any of the States where the rebellion has existed; and it was\r\nascertained by inquiry, that the circuit court of the United States\r\nwould not be held within the district of Virginia during the autumn or\r\nearly winter, nor until Congress should have \"an opportunity to\r\nconsider and act on the whole subject.\" To your deliberations the\r\nrestoration of this branch of the civil authority of the United States\r\nis therefore necessarily referred, with the hope that early provision\r\nwill be made for the resumption of all its functions. It is manifest\r\nthat treason, most flagrant in character, has been committed. Persons\r\nwho are charged with its commission should have fair and impartial\r\ntrials in the highest civil tribunals of the country, in order that the\r\nConstitution and the laws may be fully vindicated, the truth dearly\r\nestablished and affirmed that treason is a crime, that traitors should\r\nbe punished and the offense made infamous, and, at the same time, that\r\nthe question may be judicially settled, finally and forever, that no\r\nState of its own will has the right to renounce its place in the Union.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the General Government toward the 4,000,000\r\ninhabitants whom the war has called into freedom have engaged my most\r\nserious consideration. On the propriety of attempting to make the\r\nfreedmen electors by the proclamation of the Executive I took for my\r\ncounsel the Constitution itself, the interpretations of that instrument\r\nby its authors and their contemporaries, and recent legislation by\r\nCongress. When, at the first movement toward independence, the Congress\r\nof the United States instructed the several States to institute\r\ngovernments of their own, they left each State to decide for itself the\r\nconditions for the enjoyment of the elective franchise. During the\r\nperiod of the Confederacy there continued to exist a very great\r\ndiversity in the qualifications of electors in the several States, and\r\neven within a State a distinction of qualifications prevailed with\r\nregard to the officers who were to be chosen. The Constitution of the\r\nUnited States recognizes these diversities when it enjoins that in the\r\nchoice of members of the House of Representatives of the United States\r\n\"the electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for\r\nelectors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.\" After\r\nthe formation of the Constitution it remained, as before, the uniform\r\nusage for each State to enlarge the body of its electors according to\r\nits own judgment, and under this system one State after another has\r\nproceeded to increase the number of its electors, until now universal\r\nsuffrage, or something very near it, is the general rule. So fixed was\r\nthis reservation of power in the habits of the people and so\r\nunquestioned has been the interpretation of the Constitution that\r\nduring the civil war the late President never harbored the\r\npurpose--certainly never avowed the purpose--of disregarding it; and in\r\nthe acts of Congress during that period nothing can be found which,\r\nduring the continuance of hostilities much less after their close,\r\nwould have sanctioned any departure by the Executive from a policy\r\nwhich has so uniformly obtained. Moreover, a concession of the elective\r\nfranchise to the freedmen by act of the President of the United States\r\nmust have been extended to all colored men, wherever found, and so must\r\nhave established a change of suffrage in the Northern, Middle, and\r\nWestern States, not less than in the Southern and Southwestern. Such an\r\nact would have created a new class of voters, and would have been an\r\nassumption of power by the President which nothing in the Constitution\r\nor laws of the United States would have warranted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, every danger of conflict is avoided when the\r\nsettlement of the question is referred to the several States. They can,\r\neach for itself, decide on the measure, and whether it is to be adopted\r\nat once and absolutely or introduced gradually and with conditions. In\r\nmy judgment the freedmen, if they show patience and manly virtues, will\r\nsooner obtain a participation in the elective franchise through the\r\nStates than through the General Government, even if it had power to\r\nintervene. When the tumult of emotions that have been raised by the\r\nsuddenness of the social change shall have subsided, it may prove that\r\nthey will receive the kindest usage from some of those on whom they\r\nhave heretofore most closely depended.\r\n\r\nBut while I have no doubt that now, after the close of the war, it is\r\nnot competent for the General Government to extend the elective\r\nfranchise in the several States, it is equally clear that good faith\r\nrequires the security of the freedmen in their liberty and their\r\nproperty, their right to labor, and their right to claim the just\r\nreturn of their labor. I can not too strongly urge a dispassionate\r\ntreatment of this subject, which should be carefully kept aloof from\r\nall party strife. We must equally avoid hasty assumptions of any\r\nnatural impossibility for the two races to live side by side in a state\r\nof mutual benefit and good will. The experiment involves us in no\r\ninconsistency; let us, then, go on and make that experiment in good\r\nfaith, and not be too easily disheartened. The country is in need of\r\nlabor, and the freedmen are in need of employment, culture, and\r\nprotection. While their right of voluntary migration and expatriation\r\nis not to be questioned, I would not advise their forced removal and\r\ncolonization. Let us rather encourage them to honorable and useful\r\nindustry, where it may be beneficial to themselves and to the country;\r\nand, instead of hasty anticipations of the certainty of failure, let\r\nthere be nothing wanting to the fair trial of the experiment. The\r\nchange in their condition is the substitution of labor by contract for\r\nthe status of slavery. The freedman can not fairly be accused of\r\nunwillingness to work so long as a doubt remains about his freedom of\r\nchoice in his pursuits and the certainty of his recovering his\r\nstipulated wages. In this the interests of the employer and the\r\nemployed coincide. The employer desires in his workmen spirit and\r\nalacrity, and these can be permanently secured in no other way. And if\r\nthe one ought to be able to enforce the contract, so ought the other.\r\nThe public interest will be best promoted if the several States will\r\nprovide adequate protection and remedies for the freedmen. Until this\r\nis in some way accomplished there is no chance for the advantageous use\r\nof their labor, and the blame of ill success will not rest on them.\r\n\r\nI know that sincere philanthropy is earnest for the immediate\r\nrealization of its remotest aims; but time is always an element in\r\nreform. It is one of the greatest acts on record to have brought\r\n4,000,000 people into freedom. The career of free industry must be\r\nfairly opened to them, and then their future prosperity and condition\r\nmust, after all, rest mainly on themselves. If they fail, and so perish\r\naway, let us be careful that the failure shall not be attributable to\r\nany denial of justice. In all that relates to the destiny of the\r\nfreedmen we need not be too anxious to read the future; many incidents\r\nwhich, from a speculative point of view, might raise alarm will quietly\r\nsettle themselves. Now that slavery is at an end, or near its end, the\r\ngreatness of its evil in the point of view of public economy becomes\r\nmore and more apparent. Slavery was essentially a monopoly of labor,\r\nand as such locked the States where it prevailed against the incoming\r\nof free industry. Where labor was the property of the capitalist, the\r\nwhite man was excluded from employment, or had but the second best\r\nchance of finding it; and the foreign emigrant turned away from the\r\nregion where his condition would be so precarious. With the destruction\r\nof the monopoly free labor will hasten from all pans of the civilized\r\nworld to assist in developing various and immeasurable resources which\r\nhave hitherto lain dormant. The eight or nine States nearest the Gulf\r\nof Mexico have a soil of exuberant fertility, a climate friendly to\r\nlong life, and can sustain a denser population than is found as yet in\r\nany part of our country. And the future influx of population to them\r\nwill be mainly from the North or from the most cultivated nations in\r\nEurope. From the sufferings that have attended them during our late\r\nstruggle let us look away to the future, which is sure to be laden for\r\nthem with greater prosperity than has ever before been known. The\r\nremoval of the monopoly of slave labor is a pledge that those regions\r\nwill be peopled by a numerous and enterprising population, which will\r\nvie with any in the Union in compactness, inventive genius, wealth, and\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nOur Government springs from and was made for the people--not the people\r\nfor the Government. To them it owes allegiance; from them it must\r\nderive its courage, strength, and wisdom. But while the Government is\r\nthus bound to defer to the people, from whom it derives its existence,\r\nit should, from the very consideration of its origin, be strong in its\r\npower of resistance to the establishment of inequalities. Monopolies,\r\nperpetuities, and class legislation are contrary to the genius of free\r\ngovernment, and ought not to be allowed. Here there is no room for\r\nfavored classes or monopolies; the principle of our Government is that\r\nof equal laws and freedom of industry. Wherever monopoly attains a\r\nfoothold, it is sure to be a source of danger, discord, and trouble. We\r\nshall but fulfill our duties as legislators by according \"equal and\r\nexact justice to all men,\" special privileges to none. The Government\r\nis subordinate to the people; but, as the agent and representative of\r\nthe people, it must be held superior to monopolies, which in themselves\r\nought never to be granted, and which, where they exist, must be\r\nsubordinate and yield to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution confers on Congress the right to regulate commerce\r\namong the several States. It is of the first necessity, for the\r\nmaintenance of the Union, that that commerce should be free and\r\nunobstructed. No State can be justified in any device to tax the\r\ntransit of travel and commerce between States. The position of many\r\nStates is such that if they were allowed to take advantage of it for\r\npurposes of local revenue the commerce between States might be\r\ninjuriously burdened, or even virtually prohibited. It is best, while\r\nthe country is still young and while the tendency to dangerous\r\nmonopolies of this kind is still feeble, to use the power of Congress\r\nso as to prevent any selfish impediment to the free circulation of men\r\nand merchandise. A tax on travel and merchandise in their transit\r\nconstitutes one of the worst forms of monopoly, and the evil is\r\nincreased if coupled with a denial of the choice of route. When the\r\nvast extent of our country is considered, it is plain that every\r\nobstacle to the free circulation of commerce between the States ought\r\nto be sternly guarded against by appropriate legislation within the\r\nlimits of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior explains the condition of\r\nthe public lands, the transactions of the Patent Office and the Pension\r\nBureau, the management of our Indian affairs, the progress made in the\r\nconstruction of the Pacific Railroad, and furnishes information in\r\nreference to matters of local interest in the District of Columbia. It\r\nalso presents evidence of the successful operation of the homestead\r\nact, under the provisions of which 1,160,533 acres of the public lands\r\nwere entered during the last fiscal year--more than one-fourth of the\r\nwhole number of acres sold or otherwise disposed of during that period.\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts derived from this source are\r\nsufficient to cover the expenses incident to the survey and disposal of\r\nthe lands entered under this act, and that payments in cash to the\r\nextent of from 40 to 50 per cent will be made by settlers who may thus\r\nat any time acquire title before the expiration of the period at which\r\nit would otherwise vest. The homestead policy was established only\r\nafter long and earnest resistance; experience proves its wisdom. The\r\nlands in the hands of industrious settlers, whose labor creates wealth\r\nand contributes to the public resources, are worth more to the United\r\nStates than if they had been reserved as a solitude for future\r\npurchasers.\r\n\r\nThe lamentable events of the last four years and the sacrifices made by\r\nthe gallant men of our Army and Navy have swelled the records of the\r\nPension Bureau to an unprecedented extent. On the 30th day of June last\r\nthe total number of pensioners was 85,986, requiring for their annual\r\npay, exclusive of expenses, the sum of $8,023,445. The number of\r\napplications that have been allowed since that date will require a\r\nlarge increase of this amount for the next fiscal year. The means for\r\nthe payment of the stipends due under existing laws to our disabled\r\nsoldiers and sailors and to the families of such as have perished in\r\nthe service of the country will no doubt be cheerfully and promptly\r\ngranted. A grateful people will not hesitate to sanction any measures\r\nhaving for their object the relief of soldiers mutilated and families\r\nmade fatherless in the efforts to preserve our national existence.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents an encouraging exhibit of\r\nthe operations of the Post-Office Department during the year. The\r\nrevenues of the past year, from the loyal States alone, exceeded the\r\nmaximum annual receipts from all the States previous to the rebellion\r\nin the sum of $6,038,091; and the annual average increase of revenue\r\nduring the last four years, compared with the revenues of the four\r\nyears immediately preceding the rebellion, was $3,533,845. The revenues\r\nof the last fiscal year amounted to $14,556,158 and the expenditures to\r\n$13,694,728, leaving a surplus of receipts over expenditures of\r\n$861,430. Progress has been made in restoring the postal service in the\r\nSouthern States. The views presented by the Postmaster-General against\r\nthe policy of granting subsidies to the ocean mail steamship lines upon\r\nestablished routes and in favor of continuing the present system, which\r\nlimits the compensation for ocean service to the postage earnings, are\r\nrecommended to the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Secretary of the Navy that while at\r\nthe commencement of the present year there were in commission 530\r\nvessels of all classes and descriptions, armed with 3,000 guns and\r\nmanned by 51,000 men, the number of vessels at present in commission is\r\n117, with 830 guns and 12,128 men. By this prompt reduction of the\r\nnaval forces the expenses of the Government have been largely\r\ndiminished, and a number of vessels purchased for naval purposes from\r\nthe merchant marine have been returned to the peaceful pursuits of\r\ncommerce. Since the suppression of active hostilities our foreign\r\nsquadrons have been reestablished, and consist of vessels much more\r\nefficient than those employed on similar service previous to the\r\nrebellion. The suggestion for the enlargement of the navy-yards, and\r\nespecially for the establishment of one in fresh water for ironclad\r\nvessels, is deserving of consideration, as is also the recommendation\r\nfor a different location and more ample grounds for the Naval Academy.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Secretary of War a general summary is given of the\r\nmilitary campaigns of 1864 and 1865, ending in the suppression of armed\r\nresistance to the national authority in the insurgent States. The\r\noperations of the general administrative bureaus of the War Department\r\nduring the past year are detailed and an estimate made of the\r\nappropriations that will be required for military purposes in the\r\nfiscal year commencing the 1st day of July, 1866. The national military\r\nforce on the 1st of May, 1865, numbered 1,000,516 men. It is proposed\r\nto reduce the military establishment to a peace footing, comprehending\r\n50,000 troops of all arms, organized so as to admit of an enlargement\r\nby filling up the ranks to 82,600 if the circumstances of the country\r\nshould require an augmentation of the Army. The volunteer force has\r\nalready been reduced by the discharge from service of over 800,000\r\ntroops, and the Department is proceeding rapidly in the work of further\r\nreduction. The war estimates are reduced from $516,240,131 to\r\n$33,814,461, which amount, in the opinion of the Department, is\r\nadequate for a peace establishment. The measures of retrenchment in\r\neach bureau and branch of the service exhibit a diligent economy worthy\r\nof commendation. Reference is also made in the report to the necessity\r\nof providing for a uniform militia system and to the propriety of\r\nmaking suitable provision for wounded and disabled officers and\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe revenue system of the country is a subject of vital interest to its\r\nhonor and prosperity, and should command the earnest consideration of\r\nCongress. The Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you a full and\r\ndetailed report of the receipts and disbursements of the last fiscal\r\nyear, of the first quarter of the present fiscal year, of the probable\r\nreceipts and expenditures for the other three quarters, and the\r\nestimates for the year following the 30th of June, 1866. I might\r\ncontent myself with a reference to that report, in which you will find\r\nall the information required for your deliberations and decision, but\r\nthe paramount importance of the subject so presses itself on my own\r\nmind that I can not but lay before you my views of the measures which\r\nare required for the good character, and I might almost say for the\r\nexistence, of this people. The life of a republic lies certainly in the\r\nenergy, virtue, and intelligence of its citizens; but it is equally\r\ntrue that a good revenue system is the life of an organized government.\r\nI meet you at a time when the nation has voluntarily burdened itself\r\nwith a debt unprecedented in our annals. Vast as is its amount, it\r\nfades away into nothing when compared with the countless blessings that\r\nwill be conferred upon our country and upon man by the preservation of\r\nthe nation's life. Now, on the first occasion of the meeting of\r\nCongress since the return of peace, it is of the utmost importance to\r\ninaugurate a just policy, which shall at once be put in motion, and\r\nwhich shall commend itself to those who come after us for its\r\ncontinuance. We must aim at nothing less than the complete effacement\r\nof the financial evils that necessarily followed a state of civil war.\r\nWe must endeavor to apply the earliest remedy to the deranged state of\r\nthe currency, and not shrink from devising a policy which, with-out\r\nbeing oppressive to the people, shall immediately begin to effect a\r\nreduction of the debt, and, if persisted in, discharge it fully within\r\na definitely fixed number of years.\r\n\r\nIt is our first duty to prepare in earnest for our recovery from the\r\never-increasing evils of an irredeemable currency without a sudden\r\nrevulsion, and yet without untimely procrastination. For that end we\r\nmust each, in our respective positions, prepare the way. I hold it the\r\nduty of the Executive to insist upon frugality in the expenditures, and\r\na sparing economy is itself a great national resource. Of the banks to\r\nwhich authority has been given to issue notes secured by bonds of the\r\nUnited States we may require the greatest moderation and prudence, and\r\nthe law must be rigidly enforced when its limits are exceeded. We may\r\neach one of us counsel our active and enterprising countrymen to be\r\nconstantly on their guard, to liquidate debts contracted in a paper\r\ncurrency, and by conducting business as nearly as possible on a system\r\nof cash payments or short credits to hold themselves prepared to return\r\nto the standard of gold and silver. To aid our fellow-citizens in the\r\nprudent management of their monetary affairs, the duty devolves on us\r\nto diminish by law the amount of paper money now in circulation. Five\r\nyears ago the bank-note circulation of the country amounted to not much\r\nmore than two hundred millions; now the circulation, bank and national,\r\nexceeds seven hundred millions. The simple statement of the fact\r\nrecommends more strongly than any words of mine could do the necessity\r\nof our restraining this expansion. The gradual reduction of the\r\ncurrency is the only measure that can save the business of the country\r\nfrom disastrous calamities, and this can be almost imperceptibly\r\naccomplished by gradually funding the national circulation in\r\nsecurities that may be made redeemable at the pleasure of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOur debt is doubly secure--first in the actual wealth and still greater\r\nundeveloped resources of the country, and next in the character of our\r\ninstitutions. The most intelligent observers among political economists\r\nhave not failed to remark that the public debt of a country is safe in\r\nproportion as its people are free; that the debt of a republic is the\r\nsafest of all. Our history confirms and establishes the theory, and is,\r\nI firmly believe, destined to give it a still more signal illustration.\r\nThe secret of this superiority springs not merely from the fact that in\r\na republic the national obligations are distributed more widely through\r\ncountless numbers in all classes of society; it has its root in the\r\ncharacter of our laws. Here all men contribute to the public welfare\r\nand bear their fair share of the public burdens. During the war, under\r\nthe impulses of patriotism, the men of the great body of the people,\r\nwithout regard to their own comparative want of wealth, thronged to our\r\narmies and filled our fleets of war, and held themselves ready to offer\r\ntheir lives for the public good. Now, in their turn, the property and\r\nincome of the country should bear their just proportion of the burden\r\nof taxation, while in our impost system, through means of which\r\nincreased vitality is incidentally imparted to all the industrial\r\ninterests of the nation, the duties should be so adjusted as to fall\r\nmost heavily on articles of luxury leaving the necessaries of life as\r\nfree from taxation as the absolute wants of the Government economically\r\nadministered will justify. No favored class should demand freedom from\r\nassessment, and the taxes should be so distributed as not to fall\r\nunduly on the poor, but rather on the accumulated wealth of the\r\ncountry. We should look at the national debt just as it is--not as a\r\nnational blessing, but as a heavy burden on the industry of the\r\ncountry, to be discharged without unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury that the expenditures\r\nfor the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1866, will exceed the\r\nreceipts $112,194,947. It is gratifying, however, to state that it is\r\nalso estimated that the revenue for the year ending the 30th of June,\r\n1867, will exceed the expenditures in the sum of $111,682,818. This\r\namount, or so much as may be deemed sufficient for the purpose, may be\r\napplied to the reduction of the public debt, which on the 31st day of\r\nOctober, 1865, was $2,740,854,750. Every reduction will diminish the\r\ntotal amount of interest to be paid, and so enlarge the means of still\r\nfurther reductions, until the whole shall be liquidated; and this, as\r\nwill be seen from the estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury, may\r\nbe accomplished by annual payments even within a period not exceeding\r\nthirty years. I have faith that we shall do all this within a\r\nreasonable time; that as we have amazed the world by the suppression of\r\na civil war which was thought to be beyond the control of any\r\ngovernment, so we shall equally show the superiority of our\r\ninstitutions by the prompt and faithful discharge of our national\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture under its present direction is\r\naccomplishing much in developing and utilizing the vast agricultural\r\ncapabilities of the country, and for information respecting the details\r\nof its management reference is made to the annual report of the\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus fully on our domestic affairs because of their\r\ntranscendent importance. Under any circumstances our great extent of\r\nterritory and variety of climate, producing almost everything that is\r\nnecessary for the wants and even the comforts of man, make us\r\nsingularly independent of the varying policy of foreign powers and\r\nprotect us against every temptation to \"entangling alliances,\" while at\r\nthe present moment the reestablishment of harmony and the strength that\r\ncomes from harmony will be our best security against \"nations who feel\r\npower and forget right.\" For myself, it has been and it will be my\r\nconstant aim to promote peace and amity with all foreign nations and\r\npowers, and I have every reason to believe that they all, without\r\nexception, are animated by the same disposition. Our relations with the\r\nEmperor of China, so recent in their origin, are most friendly. Our\r\ncommerce with his dominions is receiving new developments, and it is\r\nvery pleasing to find that the Government of that great Empire\r\nmanifests satisfaction with our policy and reposes just confidence in\r\nthe fairness which marks our intercourse. The unbroken harmony between\r\nthe United States and the Emperor of Russia is receiving a new support\r\nfrom an enterprise designed to carry telegraphic lines across the\r\ncontinent of Asia, through his dominions, and so to connect us with all\r\nEurope by a new channel of intercourse. Our commerce with South America\r\nis about to receive encouragement by a direct line of mail steamships\r\nto the rising Empire of Brazil. The distinguished party of men of\r\nscience who have recently left our country to make a scientific\r\nexploration of the natural history and rivers and mountain ranges of\r\nthat region have received from the Emperor that generous welcome which\r\nwas to have been expected from his constant friendship for the United\r\nStates and his well-known zeal in promoting the advancement of\r\nknowledge. A hope is entertained that our commerce with the rich and\r\npopulous countries that border the Mediterranean Sea may be largely\r\nincreased. Nothing will be wanting on the part of this Government to\r\nextend the protection of our flag over the enterprise of our\r\nfellow-citizens. We receive from the powers in that region assurances\r\nof good will; and it is worthy of note that a special envoy has brought\r\nus messages of condolence on the death of our late Chief Magistrate\r\nfrom the Bey of Tunis, whose rule includes the old dominions of\r\nCarthage, on the African coast.\r\n\r\nOur domestic contest, now happily ended, has left some traces in our\r\nrelations with one at least of the great maritime powers. The formal\r\naccordance of belligerent rights to the insurgent States was\r\nunprecedented, and has not been justified by the issue. But in the\r\nsystems of neutrality pursued by the powers which made that concession\r\nthere was a marked difference. The materials of war for the insurgent\r\nStates were furnished, in a great measure, from the workshops of Great\r\nBritain, and British ships, manned by British subjects and prepared for\r\nreceiving British armaments, sallied from the ports of Great Britain to\r\nmake war on American commerce under the shelter of a commission from\r\nthe insurgent States. These ships, having once escaped from British\r\nports, ever afterwards entered them in every part of the world to\r\nrefit, and so to renew their depredations. The consequences of this\r\nconduct were most disastrous to the States then in rebellion,\r\nincreasing their desolation and misery by the prolongation of our civil\r\ncontest. It had, moreover, the effect, to a great extent, to drive the\r\nAmerican flag from the sea, and to transfer much of our shipping and\r\nour commerce to the very power whose subjects had created the necessity\r\nfor such a change. These events took place before I was called to the\r\nadministration of the Government. The sincere desire for peace by which\r\nI am animated led me to approve the proposal, already made, to submit\r\nthe question which had thus arisen between the countries to\r\narbitration. These questions are of such moment that they must have\r\ncommanded the attention of the great powers, and are so interwoven with\r\nthe peace and interests of every one of them as to have insured an\r\nimpartial decision. I regret to inform you that Great Britain declined\r\nthe arbitrament, but, on the other hand, invited us to the formation of\r\na joint commission to settle mutual claims between the two countries,\r\nfrom which those for the depredations before mentioned should be\r\nexcluded. The proposition, in that very unsatisfactory form, has been\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nThe United States did not present the subject as an impeachment of the\r\ngood faith of a power which was professing the most friendly\r\ndispositions, but as involving questions of public law of which the\r\nsettlement is essential to the peace of nations; and though pecuniary\r\nreparation to their injured citizens would have followed incidentally\r\non a decision against Great Britain, such compensation was not their\r\nprimary object. They had a higher motive, and it was in the interests\r\nof peace and justice to establish important principles of international\r\nlaw. The correspondence will be placed before you. The ground on which\r\nthe British minister rests his justification is, substantially, that\r\nthe municipal law of a nation and the domestic interpretations of that\r\nlaw are the measure of its duty as a neutral, and I feel bound to\r\ndeclare my opinion before you and before the world that that\r\njustification can not be sustained before the tribunal of nations. At\r\nthe same time; I do not advise to any present attempt at redress by\r\nacts of legislation. For the future, friendship between the two\r\ncountries must rest on the basis of mutual justice.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of the establishment of our free Constitution the\r\ncivilized world has been convulsed by revolutions in the interests of\r\ndemocracy or of monarchy, but through all those revolutions the United\r\nStates have wisely and firmly refused to become propagandists of\r\nrepublicanism. It is the only government suited to our condition; but\r\nwe have never sought to impose it on others, and we have consistently\r\nfollowed the advice of Washington to recommend it only by the careful\r\npreservation and prudent use of the blessing. During all the\r\nintervening period the policy of European powers and of the United\r\nStates has, on the whole, been harmonious. Twice, indeed, rumors of the\r\ninvasion of some parts of America in the interest of monarchy have\r\nprevailed; twice my predecessors have had occasion to announce the\r\nviews of this nation in respect to such interference. On both occasions\r\nthe remonstrance of the United States was respected from a deep\r\nconviction on the part of European Governments that the system of\r\nnoninterference and mutual abstinence from propagandism was the true\r\nrule for the two hemispheres. Since those times we have advanced in\r\nwealth and power, but we retain the same purpose to leave the nations\r\nof Europe to choose their own dynasties and form their own systems of\r\ngovernment. This consistent moderation may justly demand a\r\ncorresponding moderation. We should regard it as a great calamity to\r\nourselves, to the cause of good government, and to the peace of the\r\nworld should any European power challenge the American people, as it\r\nwere, to the defense of republicanism against foreign interference. We\r\ncan not foresee and are unwilling to consider what opportunities might\r\npresent themselves, what combinations might offer to protect ourselves\r\nagainst designs inimical to our form of government. The United States\r\ndesire to act in the future as they have ever acted heretofore; they\r\nnever will be driven from that course but by the aggression of European\r\npowers, and we rely on the wisdom and justice of those powers to\r\nrespect the system of noninterference which has so long been sanctioned\r\nby time, and which by its good results has approved itself to both\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the United States and France in reference to\r\nquestions which have become subjects of discussion between the two\r\nGovernments will at a proper time be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the organization of our Government under the Constitution, the\r\nPresident of the United States delivered his inaugural address to the\r\ntwo Houses of Congress, he said to them, and through them to the\r\ncountry and to mankind, that--The preservation of the sacred fire of\r\nliberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are\r\njustly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the\r\nexperiment intrusted to the hands of the American people. And the House\r\nof Representatives answered Washington by the voice of Madison: We\r\nadore the Invisible Hand which has led the American people, through so\r\nmany difficulties, to cherish a conscious responsibility for the\r\ndestiny of republican liberty. More than seventy-six years have glided\r\naway since these words were spoken; the United States have passed\r\nthrough severer trials than were foreseen; and now, at this new epoch\r\nin our existence as one nation, with our Union purified by sorrows and\r\nstrengthened by conflict and established by the virtue of the people,\r\nthe greatness of the occasion invites us once more to repeat with\r\nsolemnity the pledges of our fathers to hold ourselves answerable\r\nbefore our fellow-men for the success of the republican form of\r\ngovernment. Experience has proved its sufficiency in peace and in war;\r\nit has vindicated its authority through dangers and afflictions, and\r\nsudden and terrible emergencies, which would have crushed any system\r\nthat had been less firmly fixed in the hearts of the people. At the\r\ninauguration of Washington the foreign relations of the country were\r\nfew and its trade was repressed by hostile regulations; now all the\r\ncivilized nations of the globe welcome our commerce, and their\r\ngovernments profess toward us amity. Then our country felt its way\r\nhesitatingly along an untried path, with States so little bound\r\ntogether by rapid means of communication as to be hardly known to one\r\nanother, and with historic traditions extending over very few years;\r\nnow intercourse between the States is swift and intimate; the\r\nexperience of centuries has been crowded into a few generations, and\r\nhas created an intense, indestructible nationality. Then our\r\njurisdiction did not reach beyond the inconvenient boundaries of the\r\nterritory which had achieved independence; now, through cessions of\r\nlands, first colonized by Spain and France, the country has acquired a\r\nmore complex character, and has for its natural limits the chain of\r\nlakes, the Gulf of Mexico, and on the east and the west the two great\r\noceans. Other nations were wasted by civil wars for ages before they\r\ncould establish for themselves the necessary degree of unity; the\r\nlatent conviction that our form of government is the best ever known to\r\nthe world has enabled us to emerge from civil war within four years\r\nwith a complete vindication of the constitutional authority of the\r\nGeneral Government and with our local liberties and State institutions\r\nunimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe throngs of emigrants that crowd to our shores are witnesses of the\r\nconfidence of all peoples in our permanence. Here is the great land of\r\nfree labor, where industry is blessed with unexampled rewards and the\r\nbread of the workingman is sweetened by the consciousness that the\r\ncause of the country \"is his own cause, his own safety, his own\r\ndignity.\" Here everyone enjoys the free use of his faculties and the\r\nchoice of activity as a natural right. Here, under the combined\r\ninfluence of a fruitful soil, genial climes, and happy institutions,\r\npopulation has increased fifteen-fold within a century. Here, through\r\nthe easy development of boundless resources, wealth has increased with\r\ntwofold greater rapidity than numbers, so that we have become secure\r\nagainst the financial vicissitudes of other countries and, alike in\r\nbusiness and in opinion, are self-centered and truly independent. Here\r\nmore and more care is given to provide education for everyone born on\r\nour soil. Here religion, released from political connection with the\r\ncivil government, refuses to subserve the craft of statesmen, and\r\nbecomes in its independence the spiritual life of the people. Here\r\ntoleration is extended to every opinion, in the quiet certainty that\r\ntruth needs only a fair field to secure the victory. Here the human\r\nmind goes forth unshackled in the pursuit of science, to collect stores\r\nof knowledge and acquire an ever-increasing mastery over the forces of\r\nnature. Here the national domain is offered and held in millions of\r\nseparate freeholds, so that our fellow-citizens, beyond the occupants\r\nof any other part of the earth, constitute in reality a people. Here\r\nexists the democratic form of government; and that form of government,\r\nby the confession of European statesmen, \"gives a power of which no\r\nother form is capable, because it incorporates every man with the state\r\nand arouses everything that belongs to the soul.\"\r\n\r\nWhere in past history does a parallel exist to the public happiness\r\nwhich is within the reach of the people of the United States? Where in\r\nany part of the globe can institutions be found so suited to their\r\nhabits or so entitled to their love as their own free Constitution?\r\nEvery one of them, then, in whatever part of the land he has his home,\r\nmust wish its perpetuity. Who of them will not now acknowledge, in the\r\nwords of Washington, that \"every step by which the people of the United\r\nStates have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to\r\nhave been distinguished by some token of providential agency\"? Who will\r\nnot join with me in the prayer that the Invisible Hand which has led us\r\nthrough the clouds that gloomed around our path will so guide us onward\r\nto a perfect restoration of fraternal affection that we of this day may\r\nbe able to transmit our great inheritance of State governments in all\r\ntheir rights, of the General Government in its whole constitutional\r\nvigor, to our posterity, and they to theirs through countless\r\ngenerations?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Johnson\r\nDecember 3, 1866\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAfter a brief interval the Congress of the United States resumes its\r\nannual legislative labors. An all-wise and merciful Providence has\r\nabated the pestilence which visited our shores, leaving its calamitous\r\ntraces upon some portions of our country. Peace, order, tranquillity,\r\nand civil authority have been formally declared to exist throughout the\r\nwhole of the United States. In all of the States civil authority has\r\nsuperseded the coercion of arms, and the people, by their voluntary\r\naction, are maintaining their governments in full activity and complete\r\noperation. The enforcement of the laws is no longer \"obstructed in any\r\nState by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary\r\ncourse of judicial proceedings,\" and the animosities engendered by the\r\nwar are rapidly yielding to the beneficent influences of our free\r\ninstitutions and to the kindly effects of unrestricted social and\r\ncommercial intercourse. An entire restoration of fraternal feeling must\r\nbe the earnest wish of every patriotic heart; and we will have\r\naccomplished our grandest national achievement when, forgetting the sad\r\nevents of the past and remembering only their instructive lessons, we\r\nresume our onward career as a free, prosperous, and united people.\r\n\r\nIn my message of the 4th of December, 1865, Congress was informed of\r\nthe measures which had been instituted by the Executive with a view to\r\nthe gradual restoration of the States in which the insurrection\r\noccurred to their relations with the General Government. Provisional\r\ngovernors had been appointed, conventions called, governors elected,\r\nlegislatures assembled, and Senators and Representatives chosen to the\r\nCongress of the United States. Courts had been opened for the\r\nenforcement of laws long in abeyance. The blockade had been removed,\r\ncustom-houses reestablished, and the internal-revenue laws put in\r\nforce, in order that the people might contribute to the national\r\nincome. Postal operations had been renewed, and efforts were being made\r\nto restore them to their former condition of efficiency. The States\r\nthemselves had been asked to take Dart in the high function of amending\r\nthe Constitution, and of thus sanctioning the extinction of African\r\nslavery as one of the legitimate results of our internecine struggle.\r\n\r\nHaving progressed thus far, the executive department found that it had\r\naccomplished nearly all that was within the scope of its constitutional\r\nauthority. One thing, however, yet remained to be done before the work\r\nof restoration could be completed, and that was the admission to\r\nCongress of loyal Senators and Representatives from the States whose\r\npeople had rebelled against the lawful authority of the General\r\nGovernment. This question devolved upon the respective Houses, which by\r\nthe Constitution are made the judges of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of their own members, and its consideration at once\r\nengaged the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the executive department--no other plan having been\r\nproposed by Congress--continued its efforts to perfect, as far as was\r\npracticable, the restoration of the proper relations between the\r\ncitizens of the respective States, the States, and the Federal\r\nGovernment, extending from time to time, as the public interests seemed\r\nto require, the judicial, revenue, and postal systems of the country.\r\nWith the advice and consent of the Senate, the necessary officers were\r\nappointed and appropriations made by Congress for the payment of their\r\nsalaries. The proposition to amend the Federal Constitution, so as to\r\nprevent the existence of slavery within the United States or any place\r\nsubject to their jurisdiction, was ratified by the requisite number of\r\nStates, and on the 18th day of December, 1865, it was officially\r\ndeclared to have become valid as a part of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. All of the States in which the insurrection had existed\r\npromptly amended their constitutions so as to make them conform to the\r\ngreat change thus effected in the organic law of the land; declared\r\nnull and void all ordinances and laws of secession; repudiated all\r\npretended debts and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes\r\nof the insurrection, and proceeded in good faith to the enactment of\r\nmeasures for the protection and amelioration of the condition of the\r\ncolored race. Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these\r\nStates to representation, and it was not until toward the close of the\r\neighth month of the session that an exception was made in favor of\r\nTennessee by the admission of her Senators and Representatives.\r\n\r\nI deem it a subject of profound regret that Congress has thus far\r\nfailed to admit to seats loyal Senators and Representatives from the\r\nother States whose inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged in\r\nthe rebellion. Ten States--more than one-fourth of the whole\r\nnumber--remain without representation; the seats of fifty members in\r\nthe House of Representatives and of twenty members in the Senate are\r\nyet vacant, not by their own consent, not by a failure of election, but\r\nby the refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. Their\r\nadmission, it is believed, would have accomplished much toward the\r\nrenewal and strengthening of our relations as one people and removed\r\nserious cause for discontent on the part of the inhabitants of those\r\nStates. It would have accorded with the great principle enunciated in\r\nthe Declaration of American Independence that no people ought to bear\r\nthe burden of taxation and yet be denied the right of representation.\r\nIt would have been in consonance with the express provisions of the\r\nConstitution that \"each State shall have at least one Representative\"\r\nand \"that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal\r\nsuffrage in the Senate.\" These provisions were intended to secure to\r\nevery State and to the people of every State the right of\r\nrepresentation in each House of Congress; and so important was it\r\ndeemed by the framers of the Constitution that the equality of the\r\nStates in the Senate should be preserved that not even by an amendment\r\nof the Constitution can any State, without its consent, be denied a\r\nvoice in that branch of the National Legislature.\r\n\r\nIt is true it has been assumed that the existence of the States was\r\nterminated by the rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and that, the\r\ninsurrection having been suppressed, they were thenceforward to be\r\nconsidered merely as conquered territories. The legislative, executive,\r\nand judicial departments of the Government have, however, with Heat\r\ndistinctness and uniform consistency, refused to sanction an assumption\r\nso incompatible with the nature of our republican system and with the\r\nprofessed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legislation of\r\nCongress the undeniable fact makes itself apparent that these ten\r\npolitical communities are nothing less than States of this Union. At\r\nthe very commencement of the rebellion each House declared, with a\r\nunanimity as remarkable as it was significant, that the war was not\r\n\"waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose\r\nof conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering\r\nwith the rights or established institutions of those States, but to\r\ndefend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made\r\nin pursuance thereof, and to preserve the Union, with all the dignity,\r\nequality, and rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon\r\nas these objects\" were \"accomplished the war ought to cease.\" In some\r\ninstances Senators were permitted to continue their legislative\r\nfunctions, while in other instances Representatives were elected and\r\nadmitted to seats after their States had formally declared their right\r\nto withdraw from the Union and were endeavoring to maintain that right\r\nby force of arms. All of the States whose people were in insurrection,\r\nas States, were included in the apportionment of the direct tax of\r\n$20,000,000 annually laid upon the United States by the act approved\r\n5th August, 1861. Congress, by the act of March 4, 1862, and by the\r\napportionment of representation thereunder also recognized their\r\npresence as States in the Union; and they have, for judicial purposes,\r\nbeen divided into districts, as States alone can be divided. The same\r\nrecognition appears in the recent legislation in reference to\r\nTennessee, which evidently rests upon the fact that the functions of\r\nthe State were not destroyed by the rebellion, but merely suspended;\r\nand that principle is of course applicable to those States which, like\r\nTennessee, attempted to renounce their places in the Union.\r\n\r\nThe action of the executive department of the Government upon this\r\nsubject has been equally definite and uniform, and the purpose of the\r\nwar was specifically stated in the proclamation issued by my\r\npredecessor on the 22d day of September, 1862. It was then solemnly\r\nproclaimed and declared \"that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be\r\nprosecuted for the object of practically restoring the constitutional\r\nrelation between the United States and each of the States and the\r\npeople thereof in which States that relation is or may be suspended or\r\ndisturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the States by the judicial department of the\r\nGovernment has also been dear and conclusive in all proceedings\r\naffecting them as States had in the Supreme, circuit, and district\r\ncourts. In the admission of Senators and Representatives from any and\r\nall of the States there can be no just ground of apprehension that\r\npersons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of\r\nlegislation, for this could not happen when the Constitution and the\r\nlaws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress. Each House is\r\nmade the \"judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its\r\nown members,\" and may, \"with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a\r\nmember.\" When a Senator or Representative presents his certificate of\r\nelection, he may at once be admitted or rejected; or, should there be\r\nany question as to his eligibility, his credentials may be referred for\r\ninvestigation to the appropriate committee. If admitted to a seat, it\r\nmust be upon evidence satisfactory to the House of which he thus\r\nbecomes a member that he possesses the requisite constitutional and\r\nlegal qualifications. If refused admission as a member for want of due\r\nallegiance to the Government and returned to his constituents, they are\r\nadmonished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be\r\nallowed a voice in the legislative councils of the nation, and the\r\npolitical power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively\r\nexerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government and fidelity to\r\nthe Union. Upon this question, so vitally affecting the restoration of\r\nthe Union and the permanency of our present form of government, my\r\nconvictions, heretofore expressed, have undergone no change, but, on\r\nthe contrary, their correctness has been confirmed by reflection and\r\ntime. If the admission of loyal members to seats in the respective\r\nHouses of Congress was wise and expedient a year ago, it is no less\r\nwise and expedient now. If this anomalous condition is right now--if in\r\nthe exact condition of these States at the present time it is lawful to\r\nexclude them from representation--I do not see that the question will\r\nbe changed by the efflux of time. Ten years hence, if these States\r\nremain as they are, the right of representation will be no stronger,\r\nthe right of exclusion will be no weaker.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the\r\nPresident to recommend to the consideration of Congress \"such measures\r\nas he shall judge necessary and expedient.\" I know of no measure more\r\nimperatively demanded by every consideration of national interest,\r\nsound policy, and equal justice than the admission of loyal members\r\nfrom the now unrepresented States. This would consummate the work of\r\nrestoration and exert a most salutary influence in the reestablishment\r\nof peace, harmony, and fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to\r\nrenew the confidence of the American people in the vigor and stability\r\nof their institutions. It would bind us more closely together as a\r\nnation and enable us to show to the world the inherent and recuperative\r\npower of a government founded upon the will of the people and\r\nestablished upon the principles of liberty, justice, and intelligence.\r\nOur increased strength and enhanced prosperity would irrefragably\r\ndemonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institutions\r\ndrawn from our recent national disorders by the enemies of republican\r\ngovernment. The admission of loyal members from the States now excluded\r\nfrom Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension, would turn capital\r\nnow awaiting an opportunity for investment into the channels of trade\r\nand industry. It would alleviate the present troubled condition of\r\nthose States, and by inducing emigration aid in the settlement of\r\nfertile regions now uncultivated and lead to an increased production of\r\nthose staples which have added so greatly to the wealth of the nation\r\nand commerce of the world. New fields of enterprise would be opened to\r\nour progressive people and soon the devastations of war would be\r\nrepaired and all traces of our domestic differences effaced from the\r\nminds of our countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn our efforts to preserve \"the unity of government which constitutes\r\nas one people\" by restoring the States to the condition which they held\r\nprior to the rebellion, we should be cautious, lest, having rescued our\r\nnation from perils of threatened disintegration, we resort to\r\nconsolidation, and in the end absolute despotism, as a remedy for the\r\nrecurrence of similar troubles. The war having terminated, and with it\r\nall occasion for the exercise of powers of doubtful constitutionality,\r\nwe should hasten to bring legislation within the boundaries prescribed\r\nby the Constitution and to return to the ancient landmarks established\r\nby our fathers for the guidance of succeeding generations. The\r\nconstitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit and\r\nauthentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all. If\r\nin the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the\r\nconstitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected\r\nby an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates; but let\r\nthere be no change by usurpation, for it is the customary weapon by\r\nwhich free governments are destroyed.  Washington spoke these words to\r\nhis countrymen when, followed by their love and gratitude, he\r\nvoluntarily retired from the cares of public life. \"To keep in all\r\nthings within the pale of our constitutional powers and cherish the\r\nFederal Union as the only rock of safety\" were prescribed by Jefferson\r\nas rules of action to endear to his \"countrymen the true principles of\r\ntheir Constitution and promote a union of sentiment and action, equally\r\nauspicious to their happiness and safety.\" Jackson held that the action\r\nof the General Government should always be strictly confined to the\r\nsphere of its appropriate duties, and justly and forcibly urged that\r\nour Government is not to be maintained nor our Union preserved \"by\r\ninvasions of the rights and powers of the several States. In thus\r\nattempting to make our General Government strong we make it weak. Its\r\ntrue strength consists in leaving individuals and States as much as\r\npossible to themselves; in making itself felt, not in its power, but in\r\nits beneficence; not in its control, but in its protection; not in\r\nbinding the States more closely to the center, but leaving each to move\r\nunobstructed in its proper constitutional orbit.\" These are the\r\nteachings of men whose deeds and services have made them illustrious,\r\nand who, long since withdrawn from the scenes of life, have left to\r\ntheir country the rich legacy of their example, their wisdom, and their\r\npatriotism. Drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons, let us\r\nemulate them in love of country and respect for the Constitution and\r\nthe laws.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury affords much information\r\nrespecting the revenue and commerce of the country. His views upon the\r\ncurrency and with reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue\r\nsystem, internal as well as impost, are commended to the careful\r\nconsideration of Congress. In my last annual message I expressed my\r\ngeneral views upon these subjects. I need now only call attention to\r\nthe necessity of carrying into every department of the Government a\r\nsystem of rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment, and wise\r\neconomy. With no exceptional nor unusual expenditures, the oppressive\r\nburdens of taxation can be lessened by such a modification of our\r\nrevenue laws as will be consistent with the public faith and the\r\nlegitimate and necessary wants of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe report presents a much more satisfactory condition of our finances\r\nthan one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated. During the\r\nfiscal year ending the 30th June, 1865 (the last year of the war), the\r\npublic debt was increased $941,902,537, and on the 31st of October,\r\n1865, it amounted to $2,740,854,750. On the 31st day of October, 1866,\r\nit had been reduced to $2,552,310,006, the diminution during a period\r\nof fourteen months, commencing September 1, 1865, and ending October\r\n31, 1866, having been $206,379,565. In the last annual report on the\r\nstate of the finances it was estimated that during the three quarters\r\nof the fiscal year ending the 30th of June last the debt would be\r\nincreased $112,194,947. During that period, however, it was reduced\r\n$31,196,387, the receipts of the year having been $89,905,905 more and\r\nthe expenditures $200,529,235 less than the estimates. Nothing could\r\nmore clearly indicate than these statements the extent and availability\r\nof the national resources and the rapidity and safety with which under\r\nour form of government, great military and naval establishments can be\r\ndisbanded and expenses reduced from a war to a peace footing.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1866, the receipts were\r\n$558,032,620 and the expenditures $520,750,940, leaving an available\r\nsurplus of $37,281,680. It is estimated that the receipts for the\r\nfiscal year ending the 30th June, 1867, will be $475,061.386, and that\r\nthe expenditures will reach the sum of $316,428,078, leaving in the\r\nTreasury a surplus of $158,633,308. For the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1886, it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $436,000,000 and\r\nthat the expenditures will be $350,247,641, showing an excess of\r\n$85,752,359 in favor of the Government. These estimated receipts may be\r\ndiminished by a reduction of excise and import duties, but after all\r\nnecessary reductions shall have been made the revenue of the present\r\nand of following years will doubtless be sufficient to cover all\r\nlegitimate charges upon the Treasury and leave a large annual surplus\r\nto be applied to the payment of the principal of the debt. There seems\r\nnow to be no good reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country\r\nadvances in population and wealth, and yet the debt be extinguished\r\nwithin the next quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War furnishes valuable and important\r\ninformation in reference to the operations of his Department during the\r\npast year. Few volunteers now remain in the service, and they are being\r\ndischarged as rapidly as they can be replaced by regular troops. The\r\nArmy has been promptly paid, carefully provided with medical treatment,\r\nwell sheltered and subsisted, and is to be furnished with\r\nbreech-loading small arms. The military strength of the nation has been\r\nunimpaired by the discharge of volunteers, the disposition of\r\nunserviceable or perishable stores, and the retrenchment of\r\nexpenditure. Sufficient war material to meet any emergency has been\r\nretained, and from the disbanded volunteers standing ready to respond\r\nto the national call large armies can be rapidly organized, equipped,\r\nand concentrated. Fortifications on the coast and frontier have\r\nreceived or are being prepared for more powerful armaments; lake\r\nsurveys and harbor and river improvements are in course of energetic\r\nprosecution. Preparations have been made for the payment of the\r\nadditional bounties authorized during the recent session of Congress,\r\nunder such regulations as will protect the Government from fraud and\r\nsecure to the honorably discharged soldier the well-earned reward of\r\nhis faithfulness and gallantry. More than 6,000 maimed soldiers have\r\nreceived artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus, and 41 national\r\ncemeteries, containing the remains of 104,526 Union soldiers, have\r\nalready been established. The total estimate of military appropriations\r\nis $25,205,669.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the report of the Secretary of the Navy that the naval\r\nforce at this time consists of 278 vessels, armed with 2,351 guns. Of\r\nthese, 115 vessels, carrying 1,029 guns, are in commission, distributed\r\nchiefly among seven squadrons. The number of men in the service is\r\n13,600. Great activity and vigilance have been displayed by all the\r\nsquadrons, and their movements have been judiciously and efficiently\r\narranged in such manner as would best promote American commerce and\r\nprotect the rights and interests of our countrymen abroad. The vessels\r\nunemployed are undergoing repairs or are laid up until their services\r\nmay be required. Most of the ironclad fleet is at League Island, in the\r\nvicinity of Philadelphia, a place which, until decisive action should\r\nbe taken by Congress, was selected by the Secretary of the Navy as the\r\nmost eligible location for that class of vessels. It is important that\r\na suitable public station should be provided for the ironclad fleet. It\r\nis intended that these vessels shall be in proper condition for any\r\nemergency, and it is desirable that the bill accepting League Island\r\nfor naval purposes, which passed the House of Representatives at its\r\nlast session, should receive final action at an early period, in order\r\nthat there may be a suitable public station for this class of vessels,\r\nas well as a navy-yard of area sufficient for the wants of the service\r\non the Delaware River. The naval pension fund amounts to $11,750,000,\r\nhaving been increased $2,750,000 during the year. The expenditures of\r\nthe Department for the fiscal year ending 30th June last were\r\n$43,324,526, and the estimates for the coming year amount to\r\n$23,568,436. Attention is invited to the condition of our seamen and\r\nthe importance of legislative measures for their relief and\r\nimprovement. The suggestions in behalf of this deserving class of our\r\nfellow-citizens are earnestly recommended to the favorable attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents a most satisfactory\r\ncondition of the postal service and submits recommendations which\r\ndeserve the consideration of Congress. The revenues of the Department\r\nfor the year ending June 30, 1866, were $14,386,986 and the\r\nexpenditures $15,352,079, showing an excess of the latter of $965,093.\r\nIn anticipation of this deficiency, however, a special appropriation\r\nwas made by Congress in the act approved July 28, 1866. Including the\r\nstanding appropriation of $700,000 for free mail matter as a legitimate\r\nportion of the revenues, yet remaining unexpended, the actual\r\ndeficiency for the past year is only $265,093--a sum within $51,141 of\r\nthe amount estimated in the annual report of 1864. The decrease of\r\nrevenue compared with the previous year was 1 1/5 per cent, and the\r\nincrease of expenditures, owing principally to the enlargement of the\r\nmail service in the South, was 12 per cent. On the 30th of June last\r\nthere were in operation 6,930 mail routes, with an aggregate length of\r\n180,921 miles, an aggregate annual transportation of 71,837,914 miles,\r\nand an aggregate annual cost, including all expenditures, of\r\n$8,410,184. The length of railroad routes is 32,092 miles and the\r\nannual transportation 30,609,467 miles. The length of steamboat routes\r\nis 14,346 miles and the annual transportation 3,411,962 miles. The mail\r\nservice is rapidly increasing throughout the whole country, and its\r\nsteady extension in the Southern States indicates their constantly\r\nimproving condition. The growing importance of the foreign service also\r\nmerits attention. The post-office department of Great Britain and our\r\nown have agreed upon a preliminary basis for a new postal convention,\r\nwhich it is believed will prove eminently beneficial to the commercial\r\ninterests of the United States, inasmuch as it contemplates a reduction\r\nof the international letter postage to one-half the existing rates: a\r\nreduction of postage with all other countries to and from which\r\ncorrespondence is transmitted in the British mail, or in closed mails\r\nthrough the United Kingdom; the establishment of uniform and reasonable\r\ncharges for the sea and territorial transit of correspondence in closed\r\nmails; and an allowance to each post-office department of the right to\r\nuse all mail communications established under the authority of the\r\nother for the dispatch of correspondence, either in open or closed\r\nmails, on the same terms as those applicable to the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry providing the means of transmission.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits the condition of\r\nthose branches of the public service which are committed to his\r\nsupervision. During the last fiscal year 4,629,312 acres of public land\r\nwere disposed of, 1,892,516 acres of which were entered under the\r\nhomestead act. The policy originally adopted relative to the public\r\nlands has undergone essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and not\r\ntheir rapid settlement, was the cardinal feature of our land system.\r\nLong experience and earnest discussion have resulted in the conviction\r\nthat the early development of our agricultural resources and the\r\ndiffusion of an energetic population over our vast territory are\r\nobjects of far greater importance to the national growth and prosperity\r\nthan the proceeds of the sale of the land to the highest bidder in open\r\nmarket. The preemption laws confer upon the pioneer who complies with\r\nthe terms they impose the privilege of purchasing a limited portion of\r\n\"unoffered lands\" at the minimum price. The homestead enactments\r\nrelieve the settler from the payment of purchase money, and secure him\r\na permanent home upon the condition of residence for a term of years.\r\nThis liberal policy invites emigration from the Old and from the more\r\ncrowded portions of the New World. Its propitious results are\r\nundoubted, and will be more signally manifested when time shall have\r\ngiven to it a wider development.\r\n\r\nCongress has made liberal grants of public land to corporations in aid\r\nof the construction of railroads and other internal improvements.\r\nShould this policy hereafter prevail, more stringent provisions will be\r\nrequired to secure a faithful application of the fund. The title to the\r\nlands should not pass, by patent or otherwise, but remain in the\r\nGovernment and subject to its control until some portion of the road\r\nhas been actually built. Portions of them might then from time to time\r\nbe conveyed to the corporation, but never in a greater ratio to the\r\nwhole quantity embraced by the grant than the completed parts bear to\r\nthe entire length of the projected improvement. This restriction would\r\nnot operate to the prejudice of any undertaking conceived in good faith\r\nand executed with reasonable energy, as it is the settled practice to\r\nwithdraw from market the lands falling within the operation of such\r\ngrants, and thus to exclude the inception of a subsequent adverse\r\nright. A breach of the conditions which Congress may deem proper to\r\nimpose should work a forfeiture of claim to the lands so withdrawn but\r\nunconveyed, and of title to the lands conveyed which remain unsold.\r\n\r\nOperations on the several lines of the Pacific Railroad have been\r\nprosecuted with unexampled vigor and success. Should no unforeseen\r\ncauses of delay occur, it is confidently anticipated that this great\r\nthoroughfare will be completed before the expiration of the period\r\ndesignated by Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners, including\r\nthe expenses of disbursement, was $13,459,996, and 50,177 names were\r\nadded to the pension rolls. The entire number of pensioners June 30,\r\n1866, was 126,722. This fact furnishes melancholy and striking proof of\r\nthe sacrifices made to vindicate the constitutional authority of the\r\nFederal Government and to maintain inviolate the integrity of the Union\r\nThey impose upon us corresponding obligations. It is estimated that\r\n$33,000,000 will be required to meet the exigencies of this branch of\r\nthe service during the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nTreaties have been concluded with the Indians, who, enticed into armed\r\nopposition to our Government at the outbreak of the rebellion, have\r\nunconditionally submitted to our authority and manifested an earnest\r\ndesire for a renewal of friendly relations.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending September 30, 1866, 8,716 patents for useful\r\ninventions and designs were issued, and at that date the balance in the\r\nTreasury to the credit of the patent fund was $228,297.\r\n\r\nAs a subject upon which depends an immense amount of the production and\r\ncommerce of the country, I recommend to Congress such legislation as\r\nmay be necessary for the preservation of the levees of the Mississippi\r\nRiver. It is a matter of national importance that early steps should be\r\ntaken, not only to add to the efficiency of these barriers against\r\ndestructive inundations, but for the removal of all obstructions to the\r\nfree and safe navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia under existing laws is not entitled to that\r\nrepresentation in the national councils which from our earliest history\r\nhas been uniformly accorded to each Territory established from time to\r\ntime within our limits. It maintains peculiar relations to Congress, to\r\nwhom the Constitution has granted the power of exercising exclusive\r\nlegislation over the seat of Government. Our fellow-citizens residing\r\nin the District, whose interests are thus confided to the special\r\nguardianship of Congress, exceed in number the population of several of\r\nour Territories, and no just reason is perceived why a Delegate of\r\ntheir choice should not be admitted to a seat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. No mode seems so appropriate and effectual of enabling\r\nthem to make known their peculiar condition and wants and of securing\r\nthe local legislation adapted to them. I therefore recommend the\r\npassage of a law authorizing the electors of the District of Columbia\r\nto choose a Delegate, to be allowed the same rights and privileges as a\r\nDelegate representing a Territory. The increasing enterprise and rapid\r\nprogress of improvement in the District are highly gratifying, and I\r\ntrust that the efforts of the municipal authorities to promote the\r\nprosperity of the national metropolis will receive the efficient and\r\ngenerous cooperation of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture reviews the operations of\r\nhis Department during the past year, and asks the aid of Congress in\r\nits efforts to encourage those States which, scourged by war, are now\r\nearnestly engaged in the reorganization of domestic industry.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of congratulation that no foreign combinations against\r\nour domestic peace and safety or our legitimate influence among the\r\nnations have been formed or attempted. While sentiments of\r\nreconciliation, loyalty, and patriotism have increased at home, a more\r\njust consideration of our national character and rights has been\r\nmanifested by foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThe entire success of the Atlantic telegraph between the coast of\r\nIreland and the Province of Newfoundland is an achievement which has\r\nbeen justly celebrated in both hemispheres as the opening of an era in\r\nthe progress of civilization. There is reason to expect that equal\r\nsuccess will attend and even greater results follow the enterprise for\r\nconnecting the two continents through the Pacific Ocean by the\r\nprojected line of telegraph between Kamchatka and the Russian\r\npossessions in America.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of Congress protesting against pardons by foreign\r\ngovernments of persons convicted of infamous offenses on condition of\r\nemigration to our country has been communicated to the states with\r\nwhich we maintain intercourse, and the practice, so justly the subject\r\nof complaint on our part, has not been renewed.\r\n\r\nThe congratulations of Congress to the Emperor of Russia upon his\r\nescape from attempted assassination have been presented to that humane\r\nand enlightened ruler and received by him with expressions of grateful\r\nappreciation.\r\n\r\nThe Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish American adventurers to\r\ninduce the emigration of freedmen of the United States to a foreign\r\ncountry, protested against the project as one which, if consummated,\r\nwould reduce them to a bondage even more oppressive than that from\r\nwhich they have just been relieved. Assurance has been received from\r\nthe Government of the State in which the plan was matured that the\r\nproceeding will meet neither its encouragement nor approval. It is a\r\nquestion worthy of your consideration whether our laws upon this\r\nsubject are adequate to the prevention or punishment of the crime thus\r\nmeditated.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April last, as Congress is aware, a friendly\r\narrangement was made between the Emperor of France and the President of\r\nthe United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French\r\nexpeditionary military forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in\r\nthree detachments, the first of which, it was understood, would leave\r\nMexico in November, now past, the second in March next, and the third\r\nand last in November, 1867. Immediately upon the completion of the\r\nevacuation the French Government was to assume the same attitude of\r\nnonintervention in regard to Mexico as is held by the Government of the\r\nUnited States. Repeated assurances have been given by the Emperor since\r\nthat agreement that he would complete the promised evacuation within\r\nthe period mentioned, or sooner.\r\n\r\nIt was reasonably expected that the proceedings thus contemplated would\r\nproduce a crisis of great political interest in the Republic of Mexico.\r\nThe newly appointed minister of the United States, Mr. Campbell, was\r\ntherefore sent forward on the 9th day of November last to assume his\r\nproper functions as minister plenipotentiary of the United States to\r\nthat Republic. It was also thought expedient that he should be attended\r\nin the vicinity of Mexico by the Lieutenant-General of the Army of the\r\nUnited States, with the view of obtaining such information as might be\r\nimportant to determine the course to be pursued by the United States in\r\nreestablishing and maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with\r\nthe Republic of Mexico. Deeply interested in the cause of liberty and\r\nhumanity, it seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever\r\ninfluence we possessed for the restoration and permanent establishment\r\nin that country of a domestic and republican form of government.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of our affairs in regard to Mexico when, on the\r\n22d of November last, official information was received from Paris that\r\nthe Emperor of France had some time before decided not to withdraw a\r\ndetachment of his forces in the month of November past, according to\r\nengagement, but that this decision was made with the purpose of\r\nwithdrawing the whole of those forces in the ensuing spring. Of this\r\ndetermination, however, the United States had not received any notice\r\nor intimation, and so soon as the information was received by the\r\nGovernment care was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nI can not forego the hope that France will reconsider the subject and\r\nadopt some resolution in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will\r\nconform as nearly as practicable with the existing engagement, and thus\r\nmeet the just expectations of the United States. The papers relating to\r\nthe subject will be laid before you. It is believed that with the\r\nevacuation of Mexico by the expeditionary forces no subject for serious\r\ndifferences between France and the United States would remain. The\r\nexpressions of the Emperor and people of France warrant a hope that the\r\ntraditionary friendship between the two countries might in that case be\r\nrenewed and permanently restored.\r\n\r\nA claim of a citizen of the United States for indemnity for spoliations\r\ncommitted on the high seas by the French authorities in the exercise of\r\na belligerent power against Mexico has been met by the Government of\r\nFrance with a proposition to defer settlement until a mutual convention\r\nfor the adjustment of all claims of citizens and subjects of both\r\ncountries arising out of the recent wars on this continent shall be\r\nagreed upon by the two countries. The suggestion is not deemed\r\nunreasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in which\r\nclaims for indemnity by foreigners as well as by citizens of the United\r\nStates arising out of the late civil war shall be adjudicated and\r\ndetermined. I have no doubt that the subject of all such claims will\r\nengage your attention at a convenient and proper time.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made\r\ntoward an adjustment of the differences between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain arising out of the depredations upon our national\r\ncommerce and other trespasses committed during our civil war by British\r\nsubjects, in violation of international law and treaty obligations. The\r\ndelay, however, may be believed to have resulted in no small degree\r\nfrom the domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire change of\r\nministry occurred in that country during the last session of\r\nParliament. The attention of the new ministry was called to the subject\r\nat an early day, and there is some reason to expect that it will now be\r\nconsidered in a becoming and friendly spirit. The importance of an\r\nearly disposition of the question can not be exaggerated. Whatever\r\nmight be the wishes of the two Governments, it is manifest that good\r\nwill and friendship between the two countries can not be established\r\nuntil a reciprocity in the practice of good faith and neutrality shall\r\nbe restored between the respective nations.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June last, in violation of our neutrality laws, a\r\nmilitary expedition and enterprise against the British North American\r\ncolonies was projected and attempted to be carried on within the\r\nterritory and jurisdiction of the United States. In obedience to the\r\nobligation imposed upon the Executive by the Constitution to see that\r\nthe laws are faithfully executed, all citizens were warned by\r\nproclamation against taking part in or aiding such unlawful\r\nproceedings, and the proper civil, military, and naval officers were\r\ndirected to take all necessary measures for the enforcement of the\r\nlaws. The expedition failed, but it has not been without its painful\r\nconsequences. Some of our citizens who, it was alleged, were engaged in\r\nthe expedition were captured, and have been brought to trial as for a\r\ncapital offense in the Province of Canada. Judgment and sentence of\r\ndeath have been pronounced against some, while others have been\r\nacquitted. Fully believing in the maxim of government that severity of\r\ncivil punishment for misguided persons who have engaged in\r\nrevolutionary attempts which have disastrously failed is unsound and\r\nunwise, such representations have been made to the British Government\r\nin behalf of the convicted persons as, being sustained by an\r\nenlightened and humane judgment, will, it is hoped, induce in their\r\ncases an exercise of clemency and a judicious amnesty to all who were\r\nengaged in the movement. Counsel has been employed by the Government to\r\ndefend citizens of the United States on trial for capital offenses in\r\nCanada, and a discontinuance of the prosecutions which were instituted\r\nin the courts of the United States against those who took part in the\r\nexpedition has been directed.\r\n\r\nI have regarded the expedition as not only political in its nature, but\r\nas also in a great measure foreign from the United States in its\r\ncauses, character, and objects. The attempt was understood to be made\r\nin sympathy with an insurgent party in Ireland, and by striking at a\r\nBritish Province on this continent was designed to aid in obtaining\r\nredress for political grievances which, it was assumed, the people of\r\nIreland had suffered at the hands of the British Government during a\r\nperiod of several centuries. The persons engaged in it were chiefly\r\nnatives of that country, some of whom had, while others had not, become\r\ncitizens of the United States under our general laws of naturalization.\r\nComplaints of misgovernment in Ireland continually engage the attention\r\nof the British nation, and so great an agitation is now prevailing in\r\nIreland that the British Government have deemed it necessary to suspend\r\nthe writ of habeas corpus in that country. These circumstances must\r\nnecessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have\r\nentertained in regard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our\r\nneutrality laws. So long as those laws remain upon our statute books\r\nthey should be faithfully executed, and if they operate harshly,\r\nunjustly, or oppressively Congress alone can apply the remedy by their\r\nmodification or repeal.\r\n\r\nPolitical and commercial interests of the United States are not\r\nunlikely to be affected in some degree by events which are transpiring\r\nin the eastern regions of Europe, and the time seems to have come when\r\nour Government ought to have a proper diplomatic representation in\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nThis Government has claimed for all persons not convicted or accused or\r\nsuspected of crime an absolute political right of self-expatriation and\r\na choice of new national allegiance. Most of the European States have\r\ndissented from this principle, and have claimed a right to hold such of\r\ntheir subjects as have emigrated to and been naturalized in the United\r\nStates and afterwards returned on transient visits to their native\r\ncountries to the performance of military service in like manner as\r\nresident subjects. Complaints arising from the claim in this respect\r\nmade by foreign states have heretofore been matters of controversy\r\nbetween the United States and some of the European powers, and the\r\nirritation consequent upon the failure to settle this question\r\nincreased during the war in which Prussia, Italy, and Austria were\r\nrecently engaged. While Great Britain has never acknowledged the right\r\nof expatriation, she has not for some years past practically insisted\r\nupon the opposite doctrine. France has been equally forbearing, and\r\nPrussia has proposed a compromise, which, although evincing increased\r\nliberality, has not been accepted by the United States. Peace is now\r\nprevailing everywhere in Europe, and the present seems to be a\r\nfavorable time for an assertion by Congress of the principle so long\r\nmaintained by the executive department that naturalization by one state\r\nfully exempts the native-born subject of any other state from the\r\nperformance of military service under any foreign government, so long\r\nas he does not voluntarily renounce its rights and benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the Constitution I have\r\nthus submitted to the representatives of the States and of the people\r\nsuch information of our domestic and foreign affairs as the public\r\ninterests seem to require. Our Government is now undergoing its most\r\ntrying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is that the peril may be\r\nsuccessfully and finally passed without impairing its original strength\r\nand symmetry. The interests of the nation are best to be promoted by\r\nthe revival of fraternal relations, the complete obliteration of our\r\npast differences, and the reinauguration of all the pursuits of peace.\r\nDirecting our efforts to the early accomplishment of these great ends,\r\nlet us endeavor to preserve harmony between the coordinate departments\r\nof the Government, that each in its proper sphere may cordially\r\ncooperate with the other in securing the maintenance of the\r\nConstitution, the preservation of the Union, and the perpetuity of our\r\nfree institutions.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Johnson\r\nDecember 3, 1867\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe continued disorganization of the Union, to which the President has\r\nso often called the attention of Congress, is yet a subject of profound\r\nand patriotic concern. We may, however, find some relief from that\r\nanxiety in the reflection that the painful political situation,\r\nalthough before untried by ourselves, is not new in the experience of\r\nnations. Political science, perhaps as highly perfected in our own time\r\nand country as in any other, has not yet disclosed any means by which\r\ncivil wars can be absolutely prevented. An enlightened nation, however,\r\nwith a wise and beneficent constitution of free government, may\r\ndiminish their frequency and mitigate their severity by directing all\r\nits proceedings in accordance with its fundamental law.\r\n\r\nWhen a civil war has been brought to a close, it is manifestly the\r\nfirst interest and duty of the state to repair the injuries which the\r\nwar has inflicted, and to secure the benefit of the lessons it teaches\r\nas fully and as speedily as possible. This duty was, upon the\r\ntermination of the rebellion, promptly accepted not only by the\r\nexecutive department, but by the insurrectionary States themselves, and\r\nrestoration in the first moment of peace was believed to be as easy and\r\ncertain as it was indispensable. The expectations, however, then so\r\nreasonably and confidently entertained were disappointed by legislation\r\nfrom which I felt constrained by my obligations to the Constitution to\r\nwithhold my assent.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a source of profound regret that in complying with the\r\nobligation imposed upon the President by the Constitution to give to\r\nCongress from time to time information of the state of the Union I am\r\nunable to communicate any definitive adjustment satisfactory to the\r\nAmerican people, of the questions which since the close of the\r\nrebellion have agitated the public mind. On the contrary, candor\r\ncompels me to declare that at this time there is no Union as our\r\nfathers understood the term, and as they meant it to be understood by\r\nus. The Union which they established can exist only where all the\r\nStates are represented in both Houses of Congress; where one State is\r\nas free as another to regulate its internal concerns according to its\r\nown will, and where the laws of the central Government, strictly\r\nconfined to matters of national jurisdiction, apply with equal force to\r\nall the people of every section. That such is not the present \"state of\r\nthe Union\" is a melancholy fact, and we must all acknowledge that the\r\nrestoration of the States to their proper legal relations with the\r\nFederal Government and with one another, according to the terms of the\r\noriginal compact, would be the greatest temporal blessing which God, in\r\nHis kindest providence, could bestow upon this nation. It becomes our\r\nimperative duty to consider whether or not it is impossible to effect\r\nthis most desirable consummation.  The Union and the Constitution are\r\ninseparable. As long as one is obeyed by all parties, the other will be\r\npreserved; and if one is destroyed, both must perish together. The\r\ndestruction of the Constitution will be followed by other and still\r\ngreater calamities. It was ordained not only to form a more perfect\r\nunion between the States, but to \"establish justice, insure domestic\r\ntranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general\r\nwelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity.\" Nothing but implicit obedience to its requirements in all\r\nparts of the country will accomplish these great ends. Without that\r\nobedience we can look forward only to continual outrages upon\r\nindividual rights, incessant breaches of the public peace, national\r\nweakness, financial dishonor, the total loss of our prosperity, the\r\ngeneral corruption of morals, and the final extinction of popular\r\nfreedom. To save our country from evils so appalling as these, we\r\nshould renew our efforts again and again.\r\n\r\nTo me the process of restoration seems perfectly plain and simple. It\r\nconsists merely in a faithful application of the Constitution and laws.\r\nThe execution of the laws is not now obstructed or opposed by physical\r\nforce. There is no military or other necessity, real or pretended,\r\nwhich can prevent obedience to the Constitution, either North or South.\r\nAll the rights and all the obligations of States and individuals can be\r\nprotected and enforced by means perfectly consistent with the\r\nfundamental law. The courts may be everywhere open, and if open their\r\nprocess would be unimpeded. Crimes against the United States can be\r\nprevented or punished by the proper judicial authorities in a manner\r\nentirely practicable and legal. There is therefore no reason why the\r\nConstitution should not be obeyed, unless those who exercise its powers\r\nhave determined that it shall be disregarded and violated. The mere\r\nnaked will of this Government, or of some one or more of its branches,\r\nis the only obstacle that can exist to a perfect union of all the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOn this momentous question and some of the measures growing out of it I\r\nhave had the misfortune to differ from Congress, and have expressed my\r\nconvictions without reserve, though with becoming deference to the\r\nopinion of the legislative department. Those convictions are not only\r\nunchanged, but strengthened by subsequent events and further reflection\r\nThe transcendent importance of the subject will be a sufficient excuse\r\nfor calling your attention to some of the reasons which have so\r\nstrongly influenced my own judgment. The hope that we may all finally\r\nconcur in a mode of settlement consistent at once with our true\r\ninterests and with our sworn duties to the Constitution is too natural\r\nand too just to be easily relinquished.\r\n\r\nIt is clear to my apprehension that the States lately in rebellion are\r\nstill members of the National Union. When did they cease to be so? The\r\n\"ordinances of secession\" adopted by a portion (in most of them a very\r\nsmall portion) of their citizens were mere nullities. If we admit now\r\nthat they were valid and effectual for the purpose intended by their\r\nauthors, we sweep from under our feet the whole ground upon which we\r\njustified the war. Were those States afterwards expelled from the Union\r\nby the war? The direct contrary was averred by this Government to be\r\nits purpose, and was so understood by all those who gave their blood\r\nand treasure to aid in its prosecution. It can not be that a successful\r\nwar, waged for the preservation of the Union, had the legal effect of\r\ndissolving it. The victory of the nation's arms was not the disgrace of\r\nher policy; the defeat of secession on the battlefield was not the\r\ntriumph of its lawless principle. Nor could Congress, with or without\r\nthe consent of the Executive, do anything which would have the effect,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, of separating the States from each other. To\r\ndissolve the Union is to repeal the Constitution which holds it\r\ntogether, and that is a power which does not belong to any department\r\nof this Government, or to all of them united.\r\n\r\nThis is so plain that it has been acknowledged by all branches of the\r\nFederal Government. The Executive (my predecessor as well as myself)\r\nand the heads of all the Departments have uniformly acted upon the\r\nprinciple that the Union is not only undissolved, but indissoluble.\r\nCongress submitted an amendment of the Constitution to be ratified by\r\nthe Southern States, and accepted their acts of ratification as a\r\nnecessary and lawful exercise of their highest function. If they were\r\nnot States, or were States out of the Union, their consent to a change\r\nin the fundamental law of the Union would have been nugatory, and\r\nCongress in asking it committed a political absurdity. The judiciary\r\nhas also given the solemn sanction of its authority to the same view of\r\nthe case. The judges of the Supreme Court have included the Southern\r\nStates in their circuits, and they are constantly, in banc and\r\nelsewhere, exercising jurisdiction which does not belong to them unless\r\nthose States are States of the Union.\r\n\r\nIf the Southern States are component parts of the Union, the\r\nConstitution is the supreme law for them, as it is for all the other\r\nStates. They are bound to obey it, and so are we. The right of the\r\nFederal Government, which is clear and unquestionable, to enforce the\r\nConstitution upon them implies the correlative obligation on our part\r\nto observe its limitations and execute its guaranties. Without the\r\nConstitution we are nothing; by, through, and under the Constitution we\r\nare what it makes us. We may doubt the wisdom of the law, we may not\r\napprove of its provisions, but we can not violate it merely because it\r\nseems to confine our powers within limits narrower than we could wish.\r\nIt is not a question of individual or class or sectional interest, much\r\nless of party predominance, but of duty--of high and sacred duty--which\r\nwe are all sworn to perform. If we can not support the Constitution\r\nwith the cheerful alacrity of those who love and believe in it, we must\r\ngive to it at least the fidelity of public servants who act under\r\nsolemn obligations and commands which they dare not disregard.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional duty is not the only one which requires the States\r\nto be restored. There is another consideration which, though of minor\r\nimportance, is yet of great weight. On the 22d day of July, 1861,\r\nCongress declared by an almost unanimous vote of both Houses that the\r\nwar should be conducted solely for the purpose of preserving the Union\r\nand maintaining the supremacy of the Federal Constitution and laws,\r\nwithout impairing the dignity, equality, and rights of the States or of\r\nindividuals, and that when this was done the war should cease. I do not\r\nsay that this declaration is personally binding on those who joined in\r\nmaking it, any more than individual members of Congress are personally\r\nbound to pay a public debt created under a law for which they voted.\r\nBut it was a solemn public, official pledge of the national honor, and\r\nI can not imagine upon what grounds the repudiation of it is to be\r\njustified. If it be said that we are not bound to keep faith with\r\nrebels, let it be remembered that this promise was not made to rebels\r\nonly. Thousands of true men in the South were drawn to our standard by\r\nit, and hundreds of thousands in the North gave their lives in the\r\nbelief that it would be carried out. It was made on the day after the\r\nfirst great battle of the war had been fought and lost. All patriotic\r\nand intelligent men then saw the necessity of giving such an assurance,\r\nand believed that without it the war would end in disaster to our\r\ncause. Having given that assurance in the extremity of our peril, the\r\nviolation of it now, in the day of our power, would be a rude rending\r\nof that good faith which holds the moral world together; our country\r\nwould cease to have any claim upon the confidence of men; it would make\r\nthe war not only a failure, but a fraud.\r\n\r\nBeing sincerely convinced that these views are correct, I would be\r\nunfaithful to my duty if I did not recommend the repeal of the acts of\r\nCongress which place ten of the Southern States under the domination of\r\nmilitary masters. If calm reflection shall satisfy a majority of your\r\nhonorable bodies that the acts referred to are not only a violation of\r\nthe national faith, but in direct conflict with the Constitution, I\r\ndare not permit myself to doubt that you will immediately strike them\r\nfrom the statute book.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the unconstitutional character of those acts I need do\r\nno more than refer to their general provisions. It must be seen at once\r\nthat they are not authorized. To dictate what alterations shall be made\r\nin the constitutions of the several States; to control the elections of\r\nState legislators and State officers, members of Congress and electors\r\nof President and Vice-President, by arbitrarily declaring who shall\r\nvote and who shall be excluded from that privilege; to dissolve State\r\nlegislatures or prevent them from assembling; to dismiss judges and\r\nother civil functionaries of the State and appoint others without\r\nregard to State law; to organize and operate all the political\r\nmachinery of the States; to regulate the whole administration of their\r\ndomestic and local affairs according to the mere will of strange and\r\nirresponsible agents, sent among them for that purpose--these are\r\npowers not granted to the Federal Government or to any one of its\r\nbranches. Not being granted, we violate our trust by assuming them as\r\npalpably as we would by acting in the face of a positive interdict; for\r\nthe Constitution forbids us to do whatever it does not affirmatively\r\nauthorize, either by express words or by clear implication. If the\r\nauthority we desire to use does not come to us through the\r\nConstitution, we can exercise it only by usurpation, and usurpation is\r\nthe most dangerous of political crimes. By that crime the enemies of\r\nfree government in all ages have worked out their designs against\r\npublic liberty and private right. It leads directly and immediately to\r\nthe establishment of absolute rule, for undelegated power is always\r\nunlimited and unrestrained.\r\n\r\nThe acts of Congress in question are not only objectionable for their\r\nassumption of ungranted power, but many of their provisions are in\r\nconflict with the direct prohibitions of the Constitution. The\r\nConstitution commands that a republican form of government shall be\r\nguaranteed to all the States; that no person shall be deprived of life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law, arrested without a\r\njudicial warrant, or punished without a fair trial before an impartial\r\njury; that the privilege of habeas corpus shall not be denied in time\r\nof peace, and that no bill of attainder shall be passed even against a\r\nsingle individual. Yet the system of measures established by these acts\r\nof Congress does totally subvert and destroy the form as well as the\r\nsubstance of republican government in the ten States to which they\r\napply. It binds them hand and foot in absolute slavery, and subjects\r\nthem to a strange and hostile power, more unlimited and more likely to\r\nbe abused than any other now known among civilized men. It tramples\r\ndown all those rights in which the essence of liberty consists, and\r\nwhich a free government is always most careful to protect. It denies\r\nthe habeas corpus and the trial by jury. Personal freedom, property,\r\nand life, if assailed by the passion, the prejudice, or the rapacity of\r\nthe ruler, have no security whatever. It has the effect of a bill of\r\nattainder or bill of pains and penalties, not upon a few individuals,\r\nbut upon whole masses, including the millions who inhabit the subject\r\nStates, and even their unborn children. These wrongs, being expressly\r\nforbidden, can not be constitutionally inflicted upon any portion of\r\nour people, no matter how they may have come within our jurisdiction,\r\nand no matter whether they live in States, Territories, or districts.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to save from the proper and just consequences of their\r\ngreat crime those who engaged in rebellion against the Government, but\r\nas a mode of punishment the measures under consideration are the most\r\nunreasonable that could be invented. Many of those people are perfectly\r\ninnocent; many kept their fidelity to the Union untainted to the last;\r\nmany were incapable of any legal offense; a large proportion even of\r\nthe persons able to bear arms were forced into rebellion against their\r\nwill, and of those who are guilty with their own consent the degrees of\r\nguilt are as various as the shades of their character and temper. But\r\nthese acts of Congress confound them all together in one common doom.\r\nIndiscriminate vengeance upon classes, sects, and parties, or upon\r\nwhole communities, for offenses committed by a portion of them against\r\nthe governments to which they owed obedience was common in the\r\nbarbarous ages of the world; but Christianity and civilization have\r\nmade such progress that recourse to a punishment so cruel and unjust\r\nwould meet with the condemnation of all unprejudiced and right-minded\r\nmen. The punitive justice of this age, and especially of this country,\r\ndoes not consist in stripping whole States of their liberties and\r\nreducing all their people, without distinction, to the condition of\r\nslavery. It deals separately with each individual, confines itself to\r\nthe forms of law, and vindicates its own purity by an impartial\r\nexamination of every case before a competent judicial tribunal. If this\r\ndoes not satisfy all our desires with regard to Southern rebels, let us\r\nconsole ourselves by reflecting that a free Constitution, triumphant in\r\nwar and unbroken in peace, is worth far more to us and our children\r\nthan the gratification of any present feeling.\r\n\r\nI am aware it is assumed that this system of government for the\r\nSouthern States is not to be perpetual. It is true this military\r\ngovernment is to be only provisional, but it is through this temporary\r\nevil that a greater evil is to be made perpetual. If the guaranties of\r\nthe Constitution can be broken provisionally to serve a temporary\r\npurpose, and in a part only of the country, we can destroy them\r\neverywhere and for all time. Arbitrary measures often change, but they\r\ngenerally change for the worse. It is the curse of despotism that it\r\nhas no halting place. The intermitted exercise of its power brings no\r\nsense of security to its subjects, for they can never know what more\r\nthey will be called to endure when its red right hand is armed to\r\nplague them again. Nor is it possible to conjecture how or where power,\r\nunrestrained by law, may seek its next victims. The States that are\r\nstill free may be enslaved at any moment; for if the Constitution does\r\nnot protect all, it protects none.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly and avowedly the object of these laws to confer upon\r\nNegroes the privilege of voting and to disfranchise such a number of\r\nwhite citizens as will give the former a clear majority at all\r\nelections in the Southern States. This, to the minds of some persons,\r\nis so important that a violation of the Constitution is justified as a\r\nmeans of bringing it about. The morality is always false which excuses\r\na wrong because it proposes to accomplish a desirable end. We are not\r\npermitted to do evil that good may come. But in this case the end\r\nitself is evil, as well as the means. The subjugation of the States to\r\nNegro domination would be worse than the military despotism under which\r\nthey are now suffering. It was believed beforehand that the people\r\nwould endure any amount of military oppression for any length of time\r\nrather than degrade themselves by subjection to the Negro race.\r\nTherefore they have been left without a choice. Negro suffrage was\r\nestablished by act of Congress, and the military officers were\r\ncommanded to superintend the process of clothing the Negro race with\r\nthe political privileges torn from white men.\r\n\r\nThe blacks in the South are entitled to be well and humanely governed,\r\nand to have the protection of just laws for all their rights of person\r\nand property. If it were practicable at this time to give them a\r\nGovernment exclusively their own, under which they might manage their\r\nown affairs in their own way, it would become a grave question whether\r\nwe ought to do so, or whether common humanity would not require us to\r\nsave them from themselves. But under the circumstances this is only a\r\nspeculative point. It is not proposed merely that they shall govern\r\nthemselves, but that they shall rule the white race, make and\r\nadminister State laws, elect Presidents and members of Congress, and\r\nshape to a greater or less extent the future destiny of the whole\r\ncountry. Would such a trust and power be safe in such hands?\r\n\r\nThe peculiar qualities which should characterize any people who are fit\r\nto decide upon the management of public affairs for a great state have\r\nseldom been combined. It is the glory of white men to know that they\r\nhave had these qualities in sufficient measure to build upon this\r\ncontinent a great political fabric and to preserve its stability for\r\nmore than ninety years, while in every other part of the world all\r\nsimilar experiments have failed. But if anything can be proved by known\r\nfacts, if all reasoning upon evidence is not abandoned, it must be\r\nacknowledged that in the progress of nations Negroes have shown less\r\ncapacity for government than any other race of people. No independent\r\ngovernment of any form has ever been successful in their hands. On the\r\ncontrary, wherever they have been left to their own devices they have\r\nshown a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism. In the Southern\r\nStates, however, Congress has undertaken to confer upon them the\r\nprivilege of the ballot. Just released from slavery, it may be doubted\r\nwhether as a class they know more than their ancestors how to organize\r\nand regulate civil society. Indeed, it is admitted that the blacks of\r\nthe South are not only regardless of the rights of property, but so\r\nutterly ignorant of public affairs that their voting can consist in\r\nnothing more than carrying a ballot to the place where they are\r\ndirected to deposit it. I need not remind you that the exercise of the\r\nelective franchise is the highest attribute of an American citizen, and\r\nthat when guided by virtue, intelligence, patriotism, and a proper\r\nappreciation of our free institutions it constitutes the true basis of\r\na democratic form of government, in which the sovereign power is lodged\r\nin the body of the people. A trust artificially created, not for its\r\nown sake, but solely as a means of promoting the general welfare, its\r\ninfluence for good must necessarily depend upon the elevated character\r\nand true allegiance of the elector. It ought, therefore, to be reposed\r\nin none except those who are fitted morally and mentally to administer\r\nit well; for if conferred upon persons who do not justly estimate its\r\nvalue and who are indifferent as to its results, it will only serve as\r\na means of placing power in the hands of the unprincipled and\r\nambitious, and must eventuate in the complete destruction of that\r\nliberty of which it should be the most powerful conservator. I have\r\ntherefore heretofore urged upon your attention the great danger--to be\r\napprehended from an untimely extension of the elective franchise to any\r\nnew class in our country, especially when the large majority of that\r\nclass, in wielding the power thus placed in their hands, can not be\r\nexpected correctly to comprehend the duties and responsibilities which\r\npertain to suffrage. Yesterday, as it were, 4,000,000 persons were held\r\nin a condition of slavery that had existed for generations; to-day they\r\nare freemen and are assumed by law to be citizens. It can not be\r\npresumed, from their previous condition of servitude, that as a class\r\nthey are as well informed as to the nature of our Government as the\r\nintelligent foreigner who makes our land the home of his choice. In the\r\ncase of the latter neither a residence of five years and the knowledge\r\nof our institutions which it gives nor attachment to the principles of\r\nthe Constitution are the only conditions upon which he can be admitted\r\nto citizenship; he must prove in addition a good moral character, and\r\nthus give reasonable ground for the belief that he will be faithful to\r\nthe obligations which he assumes as a citizen of the Republic. Where a\r\npeople--the source of all political power--speak by their suffrages\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the ballot box, it must be carefully\r\nguarded against the control of those who are corrupt in principle and\r\nenemies of free institutions, for it can only become to our political\r\nand social system a safe conductor of healthy popular sentiment when\r\nkept free from demoralizing influences. Controlled through fraud and\r\nusurpation by the designing, anarchy and despotism must inevitably\r\nfollow. In the hands of the patriotic and worthy our Government will be\r\npreserved upon the principles of the Constitution inherited from our\r\nfathers. It follows, therefore, that in admitting to the ballot box a\r\nnew class of voters not qualified for the exercise of the elective\r\nfranchise we weaken our system of government instead of adding to its\r\nstrength and durability.\r\n\r\nI yield to no one in attachment to that rule of general suffrage which\r\ndistinguishes our policy as a nation. But there is a limit, wisely\r\nobserved hitherto, which makes the ballot a privilege and a trust, and\r\nwhich requires of some classes a time suitable for probation and\r\npreparation. To give it indiscriminately to a new class, wholly\r\nunprepared by previous habits and opportunities to perform the trust\r\nwhich it demands, is to degrade it, and finally to destroy its power,\r\nfor it may be safely assumed that no political truth is better\r\nestablished than that such indiscriminate and all-embracing extension\r\nof popular suffrage must end at last in its destruction. I repeat the\r\nexpression of my willingness to join in any plan within the scope of\r\nour constitutional authority which promises to better the condition of\r\nthe Negroes in the South, by encouraging them in industry, enlightening\r\ntheir minds, improving their morals, and giving protection to all their\r\njust rights as freedmen. But the transfer of our political inheritance\r\nto them would, in my opinion, be an abandonment of a duty which we owe\r\nalike to the memory of our fathers and the rights of our children.\r\n\r\nThe plan of putting the Southern States wholly and the General\r\nGovernment partially into the hands of Negroes is proposed at a time\r\npeculiarly unpropitious. The foundations of society have been broken up\r\nby civil war. Industry must be reorganized, justice reestablished,\r\npublic credit maintained, and order brought out of confusion. To\r\naccomplish these ends would require all the wisdom and virtue of the\r\ngreat men who formed our institutions originally. I confidently believe\r\nthat their descendants will be equal to the arduous task before them,\r\nbut it is worse than madness to expect that Negroes will perform it for\r\nus. Certainly we ought not to ask their assistance till we despair of\r\nour own competency.\r\n\r\nThe great difference between the two races in physical, mental, and\r\nmoral characteristics will prevent an amalgamation or fusion of them\r\ntogether in one homogeneous mass. If the inferior obtains the\r\nascendency over the other, it will govern with reference only to its\r\nown interests for it will recognize no common interest--and create such\r\na tyranny as this continent has never yet witnessed. Already the\r\nNegroes are influenced by promises of confiscation and plunder. They\r\nare taught to regard as an enemy every white man who has any respect\r\nfor the rights of his own race. If this continues it must become worse\r\nand worse, until all order will be subverted, all industry cease, and\r\nthe fertile fields of the South grow up into a wilderness. Of all the\r\ndangers which our nation has yet encountered, none are equal to those\r\nwhich must result from the success of the effort now making to\r\nAfricanize the half of our country.\r\n\r\nI would not put considerations of money in competition with justice and\r\nright; but the expenses incident to \"reconstruction\" under the system\r\nadopted by Congress aggravate what I regard as the intrinsic wrong of\r\nthe measure itself. It has cost uncounted millions already, and if\r\npersisted in will add largely to the weight of taxation, already too\r\noppressive to be borne without just complaint, and may finally reduce\r\nthe Treasury of the nation to a condition of bankruptcy. We must not\r\ndelude ourselves. It will require a strong standing army and probably\r\nmore than $200,000,000 per annum to maintain the supremacy of Negro\r\ngovernments after they are established. The sum thus thrown away would,\r\nif properly used, form a sinking fund large enough to pay the whole\r\nnational debt in less than fifteen years. It is vain to hope that\r\nNegroes will maintain their ascendency themselves. Without military\r\npower they are wholly incapable of holding in subjection the white\r\npeople of the South.\r\n\r\nI submit to the judgment of Congress whether the public credit may not\r\nbe injuriously affected by a system of measures like this. With our\r\ndebt and the vast private interests which are complicated with it, we\r\ncan not be too cautious of a policy which might by possibility impair\r\nthe confidence of the world in our Government. That confidence can only\r\nbe retained by carefully inculcating the principles of justice and\r\nhonor on the popular mind and by the most scrupulous fidelity to all\r\nour engagements of every sort. Any serious breach of the organic law,\r\npersisted in for a considerable time, can not but create fears for the\r\nstability of our institutions. Habitual violation of prescribed rules,\r\nwhich we bind ourselves to observe, must demoralize the people. Our\r\nonly standard of civil duty being set at naught, the sheet anchor of\r\nour political morality is lost, the public conscience swings from its\r\nmoorings and yields to every impulse of passion and interest. If we\r\nrepudiate the Constitution, we will not be expected to care much for\r\nmere pecuniary obligations. The violation of such a pledge as we made\r\non the 22d day of July, 1861, will assuredly diminish the market value\r\nof our other promises. Besides, if we acknowledge that the national\r\ndebt was created, not to hold the States in the Union, as the taxpayers\r\nwere led to suppose, but to expel them from it and hand them over to be\r\ngoverned by Negroes, the moral duty to pay it may seem much less clear.\r\nI say it may seem so, for I do not admit that this or any other\r\nargument in favor of repudiation can be entertained as sound; but its\r\ninfluence on some classes of minds may well be apprehended. The\r\nfinancial honor of a great commercial nation, largely indebted and with\r\na republican form of government administered by agents of the popular\r\nchoice, is a thing of such delicate texture and the destruction of it\r\nwould be followed by such unspeakable calamity that every true patriot\r\nmust desire to avoid whatever might expose it to the slightest danger.\r\n\r\nThe great interests of the country require immediate relief from these\r\nenactments. Business in the South is paralyzed by a sense of general\r\ninsecurity, by the terror of confiscation, and the dread of Negro\r\nsupremacy. The Southern trade, from which the North would have derived\r\nso great a profit under a government of law, still languishes, and can\r\nnever be revived until it ceases to be fettered by the arbitrary power\r\nwhich makes all its operations unsafe. That rich country--the richest\r\nin natural resources the world ever saw--is worse than lost if it be\r\nnot soon placed under the protection of a free constitution. Instead of\r\nbeing, as it ought to be, a source of wealth and power, it will become\r\nan intolerable burden upon the rest of the nation.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for retracing our steps will doubtless be seen by\r\nCongress in the late manifestations of public opinion upon this\r\nsubject. We live in a country where the popular will always enforces\r\nobedience to itself, sooner or later. It is vain to think of opposing\r\nit with anything short of legal authority backed by overwhelming force.\r\nIt can not have escaped your attention that from the day on which\r\nCongress fairly and formally presented the proposition to govern the\r\nSouthern States by military force, with a view to the ultimate\r\nestablishment of Negro supremacy, every expression of the general\r\nsentiment has been more or less adverse to it. The affections of this\r\ngeneration can not be detached from the institutions of their\r\nancestors. Their determination to preserve the inheritance of free\r\ngovernment in their own hands and transmit it undivided and unimpaired\r\nto their own posterity is too strong to be successfully opposed. Every\r\nweaker passion will disappear before that love of liberty and law for\r\nwhich the American people are distinguished above all others in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHow far the duty of the President \"to preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution\" requires him to go in opposing an unconstitutional act of\r\nCongress is a very serious and important question, on which I have\r\ndeliberated much and felt extremely anxious to reach a proper\r\nconclusion. Where an act has been passed according to the forms of the\r\nConstitution by the supreme legislative authority, and is regularly\r\nenrolled among the public statutes of the country, Executive resistance\r\nto it, especially in times of high party excitement, would be likely to\r\nproduce violent collision between the respective adherents of the two\r\nbranches of the Government. This would be simply civil war, and civil\r\nwar must be resorted to only as the last remedy for the worst of evils.\r\nWhatever might tend to provoke it should be most carefully avoided. A\r\nfaithful and conscientious magistrate will concede very much to honest\r\nerror, and something even to perverse malice, before he will endanger\r\nthe public peace; and he will not adopt forcible measures, or such as\r\nmight lead to force, as long as those which are peaceable remain open\r\nto him or to his constituents. It is true that cases may occur in which\r\nthe Executive would be compelled to stand on its rights, and maintain\r\nthem regardless of all consequences. If Congress should pass an act\r\nwhich is not only in palpable conflict with the Constitution, but will\r\ncertainly, if carried out, produce immediate and irreparable injury to\r\nthe organic structure of the Government, and if there be neither\r\njudicial remedy for the wrongs it inflicts nor power in the people to\r\nprotect themselves without the official aid of their elected\r\ndefender--if, for instance, the legislative department should pass an\r\nact even through all the forms of law to abolish a coordinate\r\ndepartment of the Government--in such a case the President must take\r\nthe high responsibilities of his office and save the life of the nation\r\nat all hazards. The so-called reconstruction acts, though as plainly\r\nunconstitutional as any that can be imagined, were not believed to be\r\nwithin the class last mentioned. The people were not wholly disarmed of\r\nthe power of self-defense. In all the Northern States they still held\r\nin their hands the sacred right of the ballot, and it was safe to\r\nbelieve that in due time they would come to the rescue of their own\r\ninstitutions. It gives me pleasure to add that the appeal to our common\r\nconstituents was not taken in vain, and that my confidence in their\r\nwisdom and virtue seems not to have been misplaced.\r\n\r\nIt is well and publicly known that enormous frauds have been\r\nperpetrated on the Treasury and that colossal fortunes have been made\r\nat the public expense. This species of corruption has increased, is\r\nincreasing, and if not diminished will soon bring us into total ruin\r\nand disgrace. The public creditors and the taxpayers are alike\r\ninterested in an honest administration of the finances, and neither\r\nclass will long endure the large-handed robberies of the recent past.\r\nFor this discreditable state of things there are several causes. Some\r\nof the taxes are so laid as to present an irresistible temptation to\r\nevade payment. The great sums which officers may win by connivance at\r\nfraud create a pressure which is more than the virtue of many can\r\nwithstand, and there can be no doubt that the open disregard of\r\nconstitutional obligations avowed by some of the highest and most\r\ninfluential men in the country has greatly weakened the moral sense of\r\nthose who serve in subordinate places. The expenses of the United\r\nStates, including interest on the public debt, are more than six times\r\nas much as they were seven years ago. To collect and disburse this vast\r\namount requires careful supervision as well as systematic vigilance.\r\nThe system, never perfected, was much disorganized by the\r\n\"tenure-of-office bill,\" which has almost destroyed official\r\naccountability. The President may be thoroughly convinced that an\r\nofficer is incapable, dishonest, or unfaithful to the Constitution, but\r\nunder the law which I have named the utmost he can do is to complain to\r\nthe Senate and ask the privilege of supplying his place with a better\r\nman. If the Senate be regarded as personally or politically hostile to\r\nthe President, it is natural, and not altogether unreasonable, for the\r\nofficer to expect that it will take his part as far as possible,\r\nrestore him to his place, and give him a triumph over his Executive\r\nsuperior. The officer has other chances of impunity arising from\r\naccidental defects of evidence, the mode of investigating it, and the\r\nsecrecy of the hearing. It is not wonderful that official malfeasance\r\nshould become bold in proportion as the delinquents learn to think\r\nthemselves safe. I am entirely persuaded that under such a rule the\r\nPresident can not perform the great duty assigned to him of seeing the\r\nlaws faithfully executed, and that it disables him most especially from\r\nenforcing that rigid accountability which is necessary to the due\r\nexecution of the revenue laws.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution invests the President with authority to decide whether\r\na removal should be made in any given case; the act of Congress\r\ndeclares in substance that he shall only accuse such as he supposes to\r\nbe unworthy of their trust. The Constitution makes him sole judge in\r\nthe premises, but the statute takes away his jurisdiction, transfers it\r\nto the Senate, and leaves him nothing but the odious and sometimes\r\nimpracticable duty of becoming a prosecutor. The prosecution is to be\r\nconducted before a tribunal whose members are not, like him,\r\nresponsible to the whole people, but to separate constituent bodies,\r\nand who may hear his accusation with great disfavor. The Senate is\r\nabsolutely without any known standard of decision applicable to such a\r\ncase. Its judgment can not be anticipated, for it is not governed by\r\nany rule. The law does not define what shall be deemed good cause for\r\nremoval. It is impossible even to conjecture what may or may not be so\r\nconsidered by the Senate. The nature of the subject forbids clear\r\nproof. If the charge be incapacity, what evidence will support it?\r\nFidelity to the Constitution may be understood or misunderstood in a\r\nthousand different ways, and by violent party men, in violent party\r\ntimes, unfaithfulness to the Constitution may even come to be\r\nconsidered meritorious. If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how\r\nshall it be made out? Will it be inferred from acts unconnected with\r\npublic duty, from private history, or from general reputation, or must\r\nthe President await the commission of an actual misdemeanor in office?\r\nShall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation\r\nin the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence? Must he\r\nforbear his complaint until the mischief is done and can not be\r\nprevented? If his zeal in the public service should impel him to\r\nanticipate the overt act, must he move at the peril of being tried\r\nhimself for the offense of slandering his subordinate? In the present\r\ncircumstances of the country someone must be held responsible for\r\nofficial delinquency of every kind. It is extremely difficult to say\r\nwhere that responsibility should be thrown if it be not left where it\r\nhas been placed by the Constitution. But all just men will admit that\r\nthe President ought to be entirely relieved from such responsibility if\r\nhe can not meet it by reason of restrictions placed by law upon his\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe unrestricted power of removal from office is a very great one to be\r\ntrusted even to a magistrate chosen by the general suffrage of the\r\nwhole people and accountable directly to them for his acts. It is\r\nundoubtedly liable to abuse, and at some periods of our history perhaps\r\nhas been abused. If it be thought desirable and constitutional that it\r\nshould be so limited as to make the President merely a common informer\r\nagainst other public agents, he should at least be permitted to act in\r\nthat capacity before some open tribunal, independent of party politics,\r\nready to investigate the merits of every case, furnished with the means\r\nof taking evidence, and bound to decide according to established rules.\r\nThis would guarantee the safety of the accuser when he acts in good\r\nfaith, and at the same time secure the rights of the other party. I\r\nspeak, of course, with all proper respect for the present Senate, but\r\nit does not seem to me that any legislative body can be so constituted\r\nas to insure its fitness for these functions.\r\n\r\nIt is not the theory of this Government that public offices are the\r\nproperty of those who hold them. They are given merely as a trust for\r\nthe public benefit, sometimes for a fixed period, sometimes during good\r\nbehavior, but generally they are liable to be terminated at the\r\npleasure of the appointing power, which represents the collective\r\nmajesty and speaks the will of the people. The forced retention in\r\noffice of a single dishonest person may work great injury to the public\r\ninterests. The danger to the public service comes not from the power to\r\nremove, but from the power to appoint. Therefore it was that the\r\nframers of the Constitution left the power of removal unrestricted,\r\nwhile they gave the Senate a fight to reject all appointments which in\r\nits opinion were not fit to be made. A little reflection on this\r\nsubject will probably satisfy all who have the good of the country at\r\nheart that our best course is to take the Constitution for our guide,\r\nwalk in the path marked out by the founders of the Republic, and obey\r\nthe rules made sacred by the observance of our great predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of our finances and circulating medium is one to\r\nwhich your early consideration is invited.\r\n\r\nThe proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the\r\nwhole value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a question\r\nupon which political economists have not agreed. Nor can it be\r\ncontrolled by legislation, but must be left to the irrevocable laws\r\nwhich everywhere regulate commerce and trade. The circulating medium\r\nwill ever irresistibly flow to those points where it is in greatest\r\ndemand. The law of demand and supply is as unerring as that which\r\nregulates the tides of the ocean; and, indeed, currency, like the\r\ntides, has its ebbs and flows throughout the commercial world.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the rebellion the bank-note circulation of the\r\ncountry amounted to not much more than $200,000,000; now the\r\ncirculation of national-bank notes and those known as \"legal-tenders\"\r\nis nearly seven hundred millions. While it is urged by some that this\r\namount should be increased, others contend that a decided reduction is\r\nabsolutely essential to the best interests of the country. In view of\r\nthese diverse opinions, it may be well to ascertain the real value of\r\nour paper issues when compared with a metallic or convertible currency.\r\nFor this purpose let us inquire how much gold and silver could be\r\npurchased by the seven hundred millions of paper money now in\r\ncirculation. Probably not more than half the amount of the latter,\r\nshowing that when our paper currency is compared with gold and silver\r\nits commercial value is compressed into three hundred and fifty\r\nmillions. This striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the\r\nGovernment, as early as may be consistent with the principles of sound\r\npolitical economy, to take such measures as will enable the holder of\r\nits notes and those of the national banks to convert them without loss\r\ninto specie or its equivalent. A reduction of our paper circulating\r\nmedium need not necessarily follow. This, however, would depend upon\r\nthe law of demand and supply, though it should be borne in mind that by\r\nmaking legal-tender and bank notes convertible into coin or its\r\nequivalent their present specie value in the hands of their holders\r\nwould be enhanced 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nLegislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded\r\nby the highest public considerations. The Constitution contemplates\r\nthat the circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality\r\nand value. At the time of the formation of that instrument the country\r\nhad just emerged from the War of the Revolution, and was suffering from\r\nthe effects of a redundant and worthless paper currency. The sages of\r\nthat period were anxious to protect their posterity from the evils that\r\nthey themselves had experienced. Hence in providing a circulating\r\nmedium they conferred upon Congress the power to coin money and\r\nregulate the value thereof, at the same time prohibiting the States\r\nfrom making anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with\r\nthat which was originally designed. Our circulation now embraces,\r\nfirst, notes of the national banks, which are made receivable for all\r\ndues to the Government, excluding imposts, and by all its creditors,\r\nexcepting in payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities\r\nthemselves; second, legal-tender notes, issued by the United States,\r\nand which the law requires shall be received as well in payment of all\r\ndebts between citizens as of all Government dues, excepting imposts;\r\nand, third, gold and silver coin. By the operation of our present\r\nsystem of finance, however, the metallic currency, when collected, is\r\nreserved only for one class of Government creditors, who, holding its\r\nbonds, semiannually receive their interest in coin from the National\r\nTreasury. They are thus made to occupy an invidious position, which may\r\nbe used to strengthen the arguments of those who would bring into\r\ndisrepute the obligations of the nation. In the payment of all its\r\ndebts the plighted faith of the Government should be inviolably\r\nmaintained. But while it acts with fidelity toward the bondholder who\r\nloaned his money that the integrity of the Union might be preserved, it\r\nshould at the same time observe good faith with the great masses of the\r\npeople, who, having rescued the Union from the perils of rebellion, now\r\nbear the burdens of taxation, that the Government may be able to\r\nfulfill its engagements. There is no reason which will be accepted as\r\nsatisfactory by the people why those who defend us on the land and\r\nprotect us on the sea; the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation,\r\nbearing the scars and wounds received while in its service; the public\r\nservants in the various Departments of the Government; the farmer who\r\nsupplies the soldiers of the Army and the sailors of the Navy; the\r\nartisan who toils in the nation's workshops, or the mechanics and\r\nlaborers who build its edifices and construct its forts and vessels of\r\nwar, should, in payment of their just and hard-earned dues, receive\r\ndepreciated paper, while another class of their countrymen, no more\r\ndeserving, are paid in coin of gold and silver. Equal and exact justice\r\nrequires that all the creditors of the Government should be paid in a\r\ncurrency possessing a uniform value. This can only be accomplished by\r\nthe restoration of the currency to the standard established by the\r\nConstitution; and by this means we would remove a discrimination which\r\nmay, if it has not already done so, create a prejudice that may become\r\ndeep rooted and widespread and imperil the national credit.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of making our currency correspond with the\r\nconstitutional standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived\r\nfrom our commercial statistics.\r\n\r\nThe production of precious metals in the United States from 1849 to\r\n1857, inclusive, amounted to $579,000,000; from 1858 to 1860,\r\ninclusive, to $137,500,000, and from 1861 to 1867, inclusive, to\r\n$457,500,000--making the grand aggregate of products since 1849\r\n$1,174,000,000. The amount of specie coined from 1849 to 1857\r\ninclusive, was $439,000,000; from 1858 to 1860, inclusive,\r\n$125,000,000, and from 1861 to 1867, inclusive, $310,000,000--making\r\nthe total coinage since 1849 $874,000,000. From 1849 to 1857,\r\ninclusive, the net exports of specie amounted to $271,000,000; from\r\n1858 to 1860, inclusive, to $148,000,000, and from 1861 to 1867,\r\ninclusive, $322,000,000--making the aggregate of net exports since 1849\r\n$741,000,000. These figures show an excess of product over net exports\r\nof $433,000,000. There are in the Treasury $111,000,000 in coin,\r\nsomething more than $40,000,000 in circulation on the Pacific Coast,\r\nand a few millions in the national and other banks--in all about\r\n$160,000,000. This, however, taking into account the specie in the\r\ncountry prior to 1849 leaves more than $300,000,000 which have not been\r\naccounted for by exportation, and therefore may yet remain in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThese are important facts and show how completely the inferior currency\r\nwill supersede the better, forcing it from circulation among the masses\r\nand causing it to be exported as a mere article of trade, to add to the\r\nmoney capital of foreign lands. They show the necessity of retiring our\r\npaper money, that the return of gold and silver to the avenues of trade\r\nmay be invited and a demand created which will cause the retention at\r\nhome of at least so much of the productions of our rich and\r\ninexhaustible gold-bearing fields as may be sufficient for purposes of\r\ncirculation. It is unreasonable to expect a return to a sound currency\r\nso long as the Government by continuing to issue irredeemable notes\r\nfills the channels of circulation with depreciated paper.\r\nNotwithstanding a coinage by our mints, since 1849, of $874,000,000,\r\nthe people are now strangers to the currency which was designed for\r\ntheir use and benefit, and specimens of the precious metals bearing the\r\nnational device are seldom seen, except when produced to gratify the\r\ninterest excited by their novelty. If depreciated paper is to be\r\ncontinued as the permanent currency of the country, and all our coin is\r\nto become a mere article of traffic and speculation, to the enhancement\r\nin price of all that is indispensable to the comfort of the people, it\r\nwould be wise economy to abolish our mints thus saving the nation the\r\ncare and expense incident to such establishments, and let all our\r\nprecious metals be exported in bullion. The time has come, however,\r\nwhen the Government and national banks should be required to take the\r\nmost efficient steps and make all necessary arrangements for a\r\nresumption of specie payments at the earliest practicable period.\r\nSpecie payments having been once resumed by the Government and banks,\r\nall notes or bills of paper issued by either of a less denomination\r\nthan $20 should by law be excluded from circulation, so that the people\r\nmay have the benefit and convenience of a gold and silver currency\r\nwhich in all their business transactions will be uniform in value at\r\nhome and abroad. Every man of property or industry, every man who\r\ndesires to preserve what he honestly possesses or to obtain what he can\r\nhonestly earn, has a direct interest in maintaining a safe circulating\r\nmedium--such a medium as shall be real and substantial, not liable to\r\nvibrate with opinions, not subject to be blown up or blown down by the\r\nbreath of speculation, but to be made stable and secure. A disordered\r\ncurrency is one of the greatest political evils. It undermines the\r\nvirtues necessary for the support of the social system and encourages\r\npropensities destructive of its happiness; it wars against industry,\r\nfrugality, and economy, and it fosters the evil spirits of extravagance\r\nand speculation. It has been asserted by one of our profound and most\r\ngifted statesmen that--Of all the contrivances for cheating the\r\nlaboring classes of mankind, none has been more effectual than that\r\nwhich deludes them with paper money. This is the most effectual of\r\ninventions to fertilize the rich man's fields by the sweat of the poor\r\nman's brow. Ordinary tyranny, oppression, excessive taxation--these\r\nbear lightly on the happiness of the mass of the community compared\r\nwith a fraudulent currency and the robberies committed by depreciated\r\npaper. Our own history has recorded for our instruction enough, and\r\nmore than enough, of the demoralizing tendency, the injustice, and the\r\nintolerable oppression on the virtuous and well disposed of a degraded\r\npaper currency authorized by law or in any way countenanced by\r\ngovernment. It is one of the most successful devices, in times of peace\r\nor war, expansions or revulsions, to accomplish the transfer of all the\r\nprecious metals from the great mass of the people into the hands of the\r\nfew, where they are hoarded in secret places or deposited in strong\r\nboxes under bolts and bars, while the people are left to endure all the\r\ninconvenience, sacrifice, and demoralization resulting from the use of\r\na depreciated and worthless paper money.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our finances and the operations of our revenue system\r\nare set forth and fully explained in the able and instructive report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury. On the 30th of June, 1866, the public\r\ndebt amounted to $2,783,425,879; on the 30th of June last it was\r\n$2,692,199,215, showing a reduction during the fiscal year of\r\n$91,226,664. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1867, the receipts\r\nwere $490,634,010 and the expenditures $346,729,129, leaving an\r\navailable surplus of $143,904,880. It is estimated that the receipts\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, will be $417,161,928 and that\r\nthe expenditures will reach the sum of $393,269,226, leaving in the\r\nTreasury a surplus of $23,892,702. For the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1869, it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $381,000,000 and\r\nthat the expenditures will be $372,000,000, showing an excess of\r\n$9,000,000 in favor of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is earnestly invited to the necessity of a\r\nthorough revision of our revenue system. Our internal-revenue laws and\r\nimpost system should be so adjusted as to bear most heavily on articles\r\nof luxury, leaving the necessaries of life as free from taxation as may\r\nbe consistent with the real wants of the Government, economically\r\nadministered. Taxation would not then fall unduly on the man of\r\nmoderate means; and while none would be entirely exempt from\r\nassessment, all, in proportion to their pecuniary abilities, would\r\ncontribute toward the support of the State. A modification of the\r\ninternal-revenue system, by a large reduction in the number of articles\r\nnow subject to tax, would be followed by results equally advantageous\r\nto the citizen and the Government. It would render the execution of the\r\nlaw less expensive and more certain, remove obstructions to industry,\r\nlessen the temptations to evade the law, diminish the violations and\r\nfrauds perpetrated upon its provisions, make its operations less\r\ninquisitorial, and greatly reduce in numbers the army of taxgatherers\r\ncreated by the system, who \"take from the mouth of honest labor the\r\nbread it has earned.\" Retrenchment, reform, and economy should be\r\ncarried into every branch of the public service, that the expenditures\r\nof the Government may be reduced and the people relieved from\r\noppressive taxation; a sound currency should be restored, and the\r\npublic faith in regard to the national debt sacredly observed. The\r\naccomplishment of these important results, together with the\r\nrestoration of the Union of the States upon the principles of the\r\nConstitution, would inspire confidence at home and abroad in the\r\nstability of our institutions and bring to the nation prosperity,\r\npeace, and good will.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War ad interim exhibits the operations\r\nof the Army and of the several bureaus of the War Department. The\r\naggregate strength of our military force on the 30th of September last\r\nwas 56,315. The total estimate for military appropriations is\r\n$77,124,707, including a deficiency in last year's appropriation of\r\n$13,600,000. The payments at the Treasury on account of the service of\r\nthe War Department from January 1 to October 29, 1867--a period of ten\r\nmonths--amounted to $109,807,000. The expenses of the military\r\nestablishment, as well as the numbers of the Army, are now three times\r\nas great as they have ever been in time of peace, while the\r\ndiscretionary, power is vested in the Executive to add millions to this\r\nexpenditure by an increase of the Army to the maximum strength allowed\r\nby the law.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive report of the Secretary of the Interior furnishes\r\ninteresting information in reference to the important branches of the\r\npublic service connected with his Department. The menacing attitude of\r\nsome of the warlike bands of Indians inhabiting the district of country\r\nbetween the Arkansas and Platte rivers and portions of Dakota Territory\r\nrequired the presence of a large military force in that region.\r\nInstigated by real or imaginary grievances, the Indians occasionally\r\ncommitted acts of barbarous violence upon emigrants and our frontier\r\nsettlements; but a general Indian war has been providentially averted.\r\nThe commissioners under the act of 20th July, 1867, were invested with\r\nfull power to adjust existing difficulties, negotiate treaties with the\r\ndisaffected bands, and select for them reservations remote from the\r\ntraveled routes between the Mississippi and the Pacific. They entered\r\nwithout delay upon the execution of their trust, but have not yet made\r\nany official report of their proceedings. It is of vital importance\r\nthat our distant Territories should be exempt from Indian outbreaks,\r\nand that the construction of the Pacific Railroad, an object of\r\nnational importance, should not be interrupted by hostile tribes. These\r\nobjects, as well as the material interests and the moral and\r\nintellectual improvement of the Indians, can be most effectually\r\nsecured by concentrating them upon portions of country set apart for\r\ntheir exclusive use and located at points remote from our highways and\r\nencroaching white settlements.\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the second session of the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress 510 miles of road have been constructed on the main line and\r\nbranches of the Pacific Railway. The line from Omaha is rapidly\r\napproaching the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, while the terminus\r\nof the last section of constructed road in California, accepted by the\r\nGovernment on the 24th day of October last, was but 11 miles distant\r\nfrom the summit of the Sierra Nevada. The remarkable energy evinced by\r\nthe companies offers the strongest assurance that the completion of the\r\nroad from Sacramento to Omaha will not be long deferred.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 7,041,114 acres of public land were\r\ndisposed of, and the cash receipts from sales and fees exceeded by\r\none-half million dollars the sum realized from those sources during the\r\npreceding year. The amount paid to pensioners, including expenses of\r\ndisbursements, was $18,619,956, and 36,482 names were added to the\r\nrolls. The entire number of pensioners on the 30th of June last was\r\n155,474. Eleven thousand six hundred and fifty-five patents and designs\r\nwere issued during the year ending September 30, 1867, and at that date\r\nthe balance in the Treasury to the credit of the patent fund was\r\n$286,607.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy states that we have seven\r\nsquadrons actively and judiciously employed, under efficient and able\r\ncommanders, in protecting the persons and property of American\r\ncitizens, maintaining the dignity and power of the Government, and\r\npromoting the commerce and business interests of our countrymen in\r\nevery part of the world. Of the 238 vessels composing the present Navy\r\nof the United States, 56, carrying 507 guns, are in squadron service.\r\nDuring the year the number of vessels in commission has been reduced\r\n12, and there are 13 less on squadron duty than there were at the date\r\nof the last report. A large number of vessels were commenced and in the\r\ncourse of construction when the war terminated, and although Congress\r\nhad made the necessary appropriations for their completion, the\r\nDepartment has either suspended work upon them or limited the slow\r\ncompletion of the steam vessels, so as to meet the contracts for\r\nmachinery made with private establishments. The total expenditures of\r\nthe Navy Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1867, were\r\n$31,034,011. No appropriations have been made or required since the\r\nclose of the war for the construction and repair of vessels, for steam\r\nmachinery, ordnance, provisions and clothing, fuel, hemp, etc., the\r\nbalances under these several heads having been more than sufficient for\r\ncurrent expenditures. It should also be stated to the credit of the\r\nDepartment that, besides asking no appropriations for the above objects\r\nfor the last two years, the Secretary of the Navy, on the 30th of\r\nSeptember last, in accordance with the act of May 1, 1820, requested\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to carry to the surplus fund the sum of\r\n$65,000.000, being the amount received from the sales of vessels and\r\nother war property and the remnants of former appropriations.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows the business of the\r\nPost-Office Department and the condition of the postal service in a\r\nvery favorable light, and the attention of Congress is called to its\r\npractical recommendations. The receipts of the Department for the year\r\nending June 30, 1867, including all special appropriations for sea and\r\nland service and for free mail matter, were $19,978,693. The\r\nexpenditures for all purposes were $19,235,483, leaving an unexpended\r\nbalance in favor of the Department of $743,210, which can be applied\r\ntoward the expenses of the Department for the current year. The\r\nincrease of postal revenue, independent of specific appropriations, for\r\nthe year 1867 over that of 1866 was $850,040. The increase of revenue\r\nfrom the sale of stamps and stamped envelopes was $783,404. The\r\nincrease of expenditures for 1867 over those of the previous year was\r\nowing chiefly to the extension of the land and ocean mail service.\r\nDuring the past year new postal conventions have been ratified and\r\nexchanged with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nBelgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the North German Union, Italy,\r\nand the colonial government at Hong Kong, reducing very largely the\r\nrates of ocean and land postages to and from and within those\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Acting Commissioner of Agriculture concisely presents\r\nthe condition, wants, and progress of an interest eminently worthy the\r\nfostering care of Congress, and exhibits a large measure of useful\r\nresults achieved during the year to which it refers.\r\n\r\nThe reestablishment of peace at home and the resumption of extended\r\ntrade, travel, and commerce abroad have served to increase the number\r\nand variety of questions in the Department for Foreign Affairs. None of\r\nthese questions, however, have seriously disturbed our relations with\r\nother states.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Mexico, having been relieved from foreign intervention,\r\nis earnestly engaged in efforts to reestablish her constitutional\r\nsystem of government. A good understanding continues to exist between\r\nour Government and the Republics of Hayti and San Domingo, and our\r\ncordial relations with the Central and South American States remain\r\nunchanged. The tender, made in conformity with a resolution of\r\nCongress, of the good offices of the Government with a view to an\r\namicable adjustment of peace between Brazil and her allies on one side\r\nand Paraguay on the other, and between Chile and her allies on the one\r\nside and Spain on the other, though kindly received, has in neither\r\ncase been fully accepted by the belligerents. The war in the valley of\r\nthe Parana is still vigorously maintained. On the other hand, actual\r\nhostilities between the Pacific States and Spain have been more than a\r\nyear suspended. I shall, on any proper occasion that may occur, renew\r\nthe conciliatory recommendations which have been already made. Brazil,\r\nwith enlightened sagacity and comprehensive statesmanship, has opened\r\nthe great channels of the Amazon and its tributaries to universal\r\ncommerce. One thing more seems needful to assure a rapid and cheering\r\nprogress in South America. I refer to those peaceful habits without\r\nwhich states and nations can not in this age well expect material\r\nprosperity or social advancement.\r\n\r\nThe Exposition of Universal Industry at Paris has passed, and seems to\r\nhave fully realized the high expectations of the French Government. If\r\ndue allowance be made for the recent political derangement of industry\r\nhere, the part which the United States has borne in this exhibition of\r\ninvention and art may be regarded with very high satisfaction. During\r\nthe exposition a conference was held of delegates from several nations,\r\nthe United States being one, in which the inconveniences of commerce\r\nand social intercourse resulting from the diverse standards of money\r\nvalue were very fully discussed, and plans were developed for\r\nestablishing by universal consent a common principle for the coinage of\r\ngold. These conferences are expected to be renewed, with the attendance\r\nof many foreign states not hitherto represented. A report of these\r\ninteresting proceedings will be submitted to Congress, which will, no\r\ndoubt, justly appreciate the great object and be ready to adopt any\r\nmeasure which may tend to facilitate its ultimate accomplishment.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of February, 1862, Congress declared by law that Treasury\r\nnotes, without interest, authorized by that act should be legal tender\r\nin payment of all debts, public and private, within the United States.\r\nAn annual remittance of $30,000, less stipulated expenses, accrues to\r\nclaimants under the convention made with Spain in 1834. These\r\nremittances, since the passage of that act, have been paid in such\r\nnotes. The claimants insist that the Government ought to require\r\npayment in coin. The subject may be deemed worthy of your attention.\r\n\r\nNo arrangement has yet been reached for the settlement of our claims\r\nfor British depredations upon the commerce of the United States. I have\r\nfelt it my duty to decline the proposition of arbitration made by Her\r\nMajesty's Government, because it has hitherto been accompanied by\r\nreservations and limitations incompatible with the rights, interest,\r\nand honor of our country. It is not to be apprehended that Great\r\nBritain will persist in her refusal to satisfy these just and\r\nreasonable claims, which involve the sacred principle of\r\nnonintervention--a principle henceforth not more important to the\r\nUnited States than to all other commercial nations.\r\n\r\nThe West India islands were settled and colonized by European States\r\nsimultaneously with the settlement and colonization of the American\r\ncontinent. Most of the colonies planted here became independent nations\r\nin the close of the last and the beginning of the present century. Our\r\nown country embraces communities which at one period were colonies of\r\nGreat Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Sweden, and Russia. The people\r\nin the West Indies, with the exception of those of the island of Hayti,\r\nhave neither attained nor aspired to independence, nor have they become\r\nprepared for self-defense. Although possessing considerable commercial\r\nvalue, they have been held by the several European States which\r\ncolonized or at some time conquered them, chiefly for purposes of\r\nmilitary and naval strategy in carrying out European policy and designs\r\nin regard to this continent. In our Revolutionary War ports and harbors\r\nin the West India islands were used by our enemy, to the great injury\r\nand embarrassment of the United States. We had the same experience in\r\nour second war with Great Britain. The same European policy for a long\r\ntime excluded us even from trade with the West Indies, while we were at\r\npeace with all nations. In our recent civil war the rebels and their\r\npiratical and blockade-breaking allies found facilities in the same\r\nports for the work, which they too successfully accomplished, of\r\ninjuring and devastating the commerce which we are now engaged in\r\nrebuilding. We labored especially under this disadvantage, that\r\nEuropean steam vessels employed by our enemies found friendly shelter,\r\nprotection, and supplies in West Indian ports, while our naval\r\noperations were necessarily carried on from our own distant shores.\r\nThere was then a universal feeling of the want of an advanced naval\r\noutpost between the Atlantic coast and Europe. The duty of obtaining\r\nsuch an outpost peacefully and lawfully, while neither doing nor\r\nmenacing injury to other states, earnestly engaged the attention of the\r\nexecutive department before the close of the war, and it has not been\r\nlost sight of since that time. A not entirely dissimilar naval want\r\nrevealed itself during the same period on the Pacific coast. The\r\nrequired foothold there was fortunately secured by our late treaty with\r\nthe Emperor of Russia, and it now seems imperative that the more\r\nobvious necessities of the Atlantic coast should not be less carefully\r\nprovided for. A good and convenient port and harbor, capable of easy\r\ndefense, will supply that want. With the possession of such a station\r\nby the United States, neither we nor any other American nation need\r\nlonger apprehend injury or offense from any transatlantic enemy. I\r\nagree with our early statesmen that the West Indies naturally gravitate\r\nto, and may be expected ultimately to be absorbed by, the continental\r\nStates, including our own. I agree with them also that it is wise to\r\nleave the question of such absorption to this process of natural\r\npolitical gravitation. The islands of St. Thomas and St. John, which\r\nconstitute a part of the group called the Virgin Islands, seemed to\r\noffer us advantages immediately desirable, while their acquisition\r\ncould be secured in harmony with the principles to which I have\r\nalluded. A treaty has therefore been concluded with the King of Denmark\r\nfor the cession of those islands, and will be submitted to the Senate\r\nfor consideration.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be necessary to call the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject of providing for the payment to Russia of the sum stipulated in\r\nthe treaty for the cession of Alaska. Possession having been formally\r\ndelivered to our commissioner, the territory remains for the present in\r\ncare of a military force, awaiting such civil organization as shall be\r\ndirected by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of many small German States to Prussia and the\r\nreorganization of that country under a new and liberal constitution\r\nhave induced me to renew the effort to obtain a just and prompt\r\nsettlement of the long-vexed question concerning the claims of foreign\r\nstates for military service from their subjects naturalized in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject the attention of Congress is\r\nrespectfully called to a singular and embarrassing conflict of laws.\r\nThe executive department of this Government has hitherto uniformly\r\nheld, as it now holds, that naturalization in conformity with the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States absolves the recipient from\r\nhis native allegiance. The courts of Great Britain hold that allegiance\r\nto the British Crown is indefensible, and is not absolved by our laws\r\nof naturalization. British judges cite courts and law authorities of\r\nthe United States in support of that theory against the position held\r\nby the executive authority of the United States. This conflict\r\nperplexes the public mind concerning the rights of naturalized citizens\r\nand impairs the national authority abroad. I called attention to this\r\nsubject in my last annual message, and now again respectfully appeal to\r\nCongress to declare the national will unmistakably upon this important\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe abuse of our laws by the clandestine prosecution of the African\r\nslave trade from American ports or by American citizens has altogether\r\nceased, and under existing circumstances no apprehensions of its\r\nrenewal in this part of the world are entertained. Under these\r\ncircumstances it becomes a question whether we shall not propose to Her\r\nMajesty's Government a suspension or discontinuance of the stipulations\r\nfor maintaining a naval force for the suppression of that trade.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nAndrew Johnson\r\nDecember 9, 1868\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nUpon the reassembling of Congress it again becomes my duty to call your\r\nattention to the state of the Union and to its continued disorganized\r\ncondition under the various laws which have been passed upon the\r\nsubject of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely assumed as an axiom in the government of states that\r\nthe greatest wrongs inflicted upon a people are caused by unjust and\r\narbitrary legislation, or by the unrelenting decrees of despotic\r\nrulers, and that the timely revocation of injurious and oppressive\r\nmeasures is the greatest good that can be conferred upon a nation. The\r\nlegislator or ruler who has the wisdom and magnanimity to retrace his\r\nsteps when convinced of error will sooner or later be rewarded with the\r\nrespect and gratitude of an intelligent and patriotic people.\r\n\r\nOur own history, although embracing a period less than a century,\r\naffords abundant proof that most, if not all, of our domestic troubles\r\nare directly traceable to violations of the organic law and excessive\r\nlegislation. The most striking illustrations of this fact are furnished\r\nby the enactments of the past three years upon the question of\r\nreconstruction. After a fair trial they have substantially failed and\r\nproved pernicious in their results, and there seems to be no good\r\nreason why they should longer remain upon the statute book. States to\r\nwhich the Constitution guarantees a republican form of government have\r\nbeen reduced to military dependencies in each of which the people have\r\nbeen made subject to the arbitrary will of the commanding general.\r\nAlthough the Constitution requires that each State shall be represented\r\nin Congress, Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas are yet excluded from the\r\ntwo Houses, and, contrary to the express provisions of that instrument\r\nwere denied participation in the recent election for a President and\r\nVice-President of the United States. The attempt to place the white\r\npopulation under the domination of persons of color in the South has\r\nimpaired, if not destroyed, the kindly relations that had previously\r\nexisted between them: and mutual distrust has engendered a feeling of\r\nanimosity which leading in some instances to collision and bloodshed,\r\nhas prevented that cooperation between the two races so essential to\r\nthe success of industrial enterprise in the Southern States. Nor have\r\nthe inhabitants of those States alone suffered from the disturbed\r\ncondition of affairs growing out of these Congressional enactments. The\r\nentire Union has been agitated by grave apprehensions of troubles which\r\nmight again involve the peace of the nation; its interests have been\r\ninjuriously affected by the derangement of business and labor, and the\r\nconsequent want of prosperity throughout that portion of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution--the magna charta of American rights, under\r\nwhose wise and salutary provisions we have successfully conducted all\r\nour domestic and foreign affairs, sustained ourselves in peace and in\r\nwar, and become a great nation among the powers of the earth--must\r\nassuredly be now adequate to the settlement of questions growing out of\r\nthe civil war, waged alone for its vindication. This great fact is made\r\nmost manifest by the condition of the country when Congress assembled\r\nin the month of December, 1865. Civil strife had ceased, the spirit of\r\nrebellion had spent its entire force, in the Southern States the people\r\nhad warmed into national life, and throughout the whole country a\r\nhealthy reaction in public sentiment had taken place. By the\r\napplication of the simple yet effective provisions of the Constitution\r\nthe executive department, with the voluntary aid of the States, had\r\nbrought the work of restoration as near completion as was within the\r\nscope of its authority, and the nation was encouraged by the prospect\r\nof an early and satisfactory adjustment of all its difficulties.\r\nCongress, however, intervened, and, refusing to perfect the work so\r\nnearly consummated, declined to admit members from the unrepresented\r\nStates, adopted a series of measures which arrested the progress of\r\nrestoration, frustrated all that had been so successfully accomplished,\r\nand, after three years of agitation and strife, has left the country\r\nfurther from the attainment of union and fraternal feeling than at the\r\ninception of the Congressional plan of reconstruction. It needs no\r\nargument to show that legislation which has produced such baneful\r\nconsequences should be abrogated, or else made to conform to the\r\ngenuine principles of republican government.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of party passion and sectional prejudice, other\r\nacts have been passed not warranted by the Constitution. Congress has\r\nalready been made familiar with my views respecting the\r\n\"tenure-of-office bill.\" Experience has proved that its repeal is\r\ndemanded by the best interests of the country, and that while it\r\nremains in force the President can not enjoin that rigid accountability\r\nof public officers so essential to an honest and efficient execution of\r\nthe laws. Its revocation would enable the executive department to\r\nexercise the power of appointment and removal in accordance with the\r\noriginal design of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe act of March 2, 1867, making appropriations for the support of the\r\nArmy for the year ending June 30, 1868, and for other purposes,\r\ncontains provisions which interfere with the President's constitutional\r\nfunctions as Commander in Chief of the Army and deny to States of the\r\nUnion the right to protect themselves by means of their own militia.\r\nThese provisions should be at once annulled; for while the first might,\r\nin times of great emergency, seriously embarrass the Executive in\r\nefforts to employ and direct the common strength of the nation for its\r\nprotection and preservation, the other is contrary to the express\r\ndeclaration of the Constitution that \"a well-regulated militia being\r\nnecessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to\r\nkeep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the repeal of all such laws would be accepted by\r\nthe American people as at least a partial return to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Government, and an indication that hereafter the\r\nConstitution is to be made the nation's safe and unerring guide. They\r\ncan be productive of no permanent benefit to the country, and should\r\nnot be permitted to stand as so many monuments of the deficient wisdom\r\nwhich has characterized our recent legislation.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our finances demands the early and earnest\r\nconsideration of Congress. Compared with the growth of our population,\r\nthe public expenditures have reached an amount unprecedented in our\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States in 1790 was nearly 4,000,000\r\npeople. Increasing each decade about 33 per cent, it reached in 1860\r\n31,000,000, an increase of 700 per cent on the population in 1790. In\r\n1869 it is estimated that it will reach 38,000,000, or an increase of\r\n868 per cent in seventy-nine years.\r\n\r\nThe annual expenditures of the Federal Government in 1791 were\r\n$4,200,000; in 1820, $18.200,000; in 1850, forty-one millions; in 1860,\r\nsixty-three millions; in 1865, nearly thirteen hundred millions; and in\r\n1869 it is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury, in his last\r\nannual report, that they will be three hundred and seventy-two\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the public disbursements of 1869, as estimated, with those\r\nof 1791, it will be seen that the increase of expenditure since the\r\nbeginning of the Government has been 8,618 per cent, while the increase\r\nof the population for the same period was only 868 per cent. Again, the\r\nexpenses of the Government in 1860, the year of peace immediately\r\npreceding the war, were only sixty--three millions, while in 1869, the\r\nyear of peace three years after the war it is estimated they will be\r\nthree hundred and seventy-two millions, an increase of 489 per cent,\r\nwhile the increase of population was only 21 per cent for the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThese statistics further show that in 1791 the annual national\r\nexpenses, compared with the population, were little more than $1 per\r\ncapita, and in 1860 but $2 per capita; while in 1869 they will reach\r\nthe extravagant sum of $9.78 per capita.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that all these statements refer to and exhibit the\r\ndisbursements of peace periods. It may, therefore, be of interest to\r\ncompare the expenditures of the three war periods--the war with Great\r\nBritain, the Mexican War, and the War of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 the annual expenses incident to the War of 1812 reached their\r\nhighest amount--about thirty-one millions--while our population\r\nslightly exceeded 8,000,000, showing an expenditure of only $3.80 per\r\ncapita. In 1847 the expenditures growing out of the war with Mexico\r\nreached fifty-five millions, and the population about 21,000,000,\r\ngiving only $2.60 per capita for the war expenses of that year. In 1865\r\nthe expenditures called for by the rebellion reached the vast amount of\r\ntwelve hundred and ninety millions, which, compared with a population\r\nof 34,000,000, gives $38.20 per capita.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4th day of March, 1789, to the 30th of June, 1861, the entire\r\nexpenditures of the Government were $1,700,000,000. During that period\r\nwe were engaged in wars with Great Britain and Mexico, and were\r\ninvolved in hostilities with powerful Indian tribes; Louisiana was\r\npurchased from France at a cost of $15,000,000; Florida was ceded to us\r\nby Spain for five millions; California was acquired from Mexico for\r\nfifteen millions, and the territory of New Mexico was obtained from\r\nTexas for the sum of ten millions. Early in 1861 the War of the\r\nRebellion commenced; and from the 1st of July of that year to the 30th\r\nof June, 1865, the public expenditures reached the enormous aggregate\r\nof thirty-three hundred millions. Three years of peace have intervened,\r\nand during that time the disbursements of the Government have\r\nsuccessively been five hundred and twenty millions, three hundred and\r\nforty-six millions, and three hundred and ninety-three millions. Adding\r\nto these amounts three hundred and seventy-two millions, estimated as\r\nnecessary for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1869, we obtain\r\na total expenditure of $1,600,000,000 during the four years immediately\r\nsucceeding the war, or nearly as much as was expended during the\r\nseventy-two years that preceded the rebellion and embraced the\r\nextraordinary expenditures already named.\r\n\r\nThese startling facts clearly illustrate the necessity of retrenchment\r\nin all branches of the public service. Abuses which were tolerated\r\nduring the war for the preservation of the nation will not be endured\r\nby the people, now that profound peace prevails. The receipts from\r\ninternal revenues and customs have during the past three years\r\ngradually diminished, and the continuance of useless and extravagant\r\nexpenditures will involve us in national bankruptcy, or else make\r\ninevitable an increase of taxes already too onerous and in many\r\nrespects obnoxious on account of their inquisitorial character. One\r\nhundred millions annually are expended for the military force, a large\r\nportion of which is employed in the execution of laws both unnecessary\r\nand unconstitutional; one hundred and fifty millions are required each\r\nyear to pay the interest on the public debt: an army of taxgatherers\r\nimpoverishes the nation, and public agents, placed by Congress beyond\r\nthe control of the Executive, divert from their legitimate purposes\r\nlarge sums of money which they collect from the people in the name of\r\nthe Government. Judicious legislation and prudent economy can alone\r\nremedy defects and avert evils which, if suffered to exist, can not\r\nfail to diminish confidence in the public councils and weaken the\r\nattachment and respect of the people toward their political\r\ninstitutions. Without proper care the small balance which it is\r\nestimated will remain in the Treasury at the close of the present\r\nfiscal year will not be realized, and additional millions be added to a\r\ndebt which is now enumerated by billions.\r\n\r\nIt is shown by the able and comprehensive report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury that the receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1868, were $405,638,083, and that the expenditures for the same period\r\nwere $377,340,284, leaving in the Treasury a surplus of $28,297,798. It\r\nis estimated that the receipts during the present fiscal year, ending\r\nJune 30, 1869, will be $341,392,868 and the expenditures $336,152,470,\r\nshowing a small balance of $5,240,398 in favor of the Government. For\r\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1870, it is estimated that the receipts\r\nwill amount to $327,000,000 and the expenditures to $303,000,000,\r\nleaving an estimated surplus of $24,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt becomes proper in this connection to make a brief reference to our\r\npublic indebtedness, which has accumulated with such alarming rapidity\r\nand assumed such colossal proportions.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, when the Government commenced operations under the Federal\r\nConstitution, it was burdened with an indebtedness of $75,000,000,\r\ncreated during the War of the Revolution. This amount had been reduced\r\nto $45,000,000 when, in 1812, war was declared against Great Britain.\r\nThe three years' struggle that followed largely increased the national\r\nobligations, and in 1816 they had attained the sum of $127,000,000.\r\nWise and economical legislation, however, enabled the Government to pay\r\nthe entire amount within a period of twenty years, and the\r\nextinguishment of the national debt filled the land with rejoicing and\r\nwas one of the great events of President Jackson's Administration.\r\nAfter its redemption a large fund remained in the Treasury, which was\r\ndeposited for safe-keeping with the several States. on condition that\r\nit should be returned when required by the public wants. In 1849--the\r\nyear after the termination of an expensive war with Mexico--we found\r\nourselves involved in a debt of $64,000,000; and this was the amount\r\nowed by the Government in 1860, just prior to the outbreak of the\r\nrebellion. In the spring of 1861 our civil war commenced. Each year of\r\nits continuance made an enormous addition to the debt: and when in the\r\nspring of 1865, the nation successfully emerged from the conflict, the\r\nobligations of the Government had reached the immense sum of\r\n$2.873,992,909. The Secretary of the Treasury shows that on the 1st day\r\nof November, 1867, this amount had been reduced to $2,491,504,450; but\r\nat the same time his report exhibits an increase during the past year\r\nof $35,625,102, for the debt on the 1st day of November last is stated\r\nto have been $2,527,129,552. It is estimated by the Secretary that the\r\nreturns for the past month will add to our liabilities the further sum\r\nof $11,000,000, making a total increase during thirteen months of\r\n$46,500,000.\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress December 4, 1865, it was suggested that a\r\npolicy should be devised which, without being oppressive to the people,\r\nwould at once begin to effect a reduction of the debt, and, if\r\npersisted in, discharge it fully within a definite number of years. The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury forcibly recommends legislation of this\r\ncharacter, and justly urges that the longer it is deferred the more\r\ndifficult must become its accomplishment. We should follow the wise\r\nprecedents established in 1789 and 1816, and without further delay make\r\nprovision for the payment of our obligations at as early a period as\r\nmay be practicable. The fruits of their labors should be enjoyed by our\r\ncitizens rather than used to build up and sustain moneyed monopolies in\r\nour own and other lands. Our foreign debt is already computed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury at $850,000,000; citizens of foreign\r\ncountries receive interest upon a large portion of our securities, and\r\nAmerican taxpayers are made to contribute large sums for their support.\r\nThe idea that such a debt is to become permanent should be at all times\r\ndiscarded as involving taxation too heavy to be borne, and payment once\r\nin every sixteen years, at the present rate of interest, of an amount\r\nequal to the original sum. This vast debt, if permitted to become\r\npermanent and increasing, must eventually be gathered into the hands of\r\na few, and enable them to exert a dangerous and controlling power in\r\nthe affairs of the Government. The borrowers would become servants to\r\nthe lenders, the lenders the masters of the people. We now pride\r\nourselves upon having given freedom to 4,000,000 of the colored race;\r\nit will then be our shame that 40,000,000 of people, by their own\r\ntoleration of usurpation and profligacy, have suffered themselves to\r\nbecome enslaved, and merely exchanged slave owners for new taskmasters\r\nin the shape of bondholders and taxgatherers. Besides, permanent debts\r\npertain to monarchical governments, and, tending to monopolies,\r\nperpetuities, and class legislation, are totally irreconcilable with\r\nfree institutions introduced into our republican system, they would\r\ngradually but surely sap its foundations, eventually subvert our\r\ngovernmental fabric, and erect upon its ruins a moneyed aristocracy. It\r\nis our sacred duty to transmit unimpaired to our posterity the\r\nblessings of liberty which were bequeathed to us by the founders of the\r\nRepublic. and by our example teach those who are to follow us carefully\r\nto avoid the dangers which threaten a free and independent people.\r\n\r\nVarious plans have been proposed for the payment of the public debt.\r\nHowever they may have varied as to the time and mode in which it should\r\nbe redeemed, there seems to be a general concurrence as to the\r\npropriety and justness of a reduction in the present rate of interest.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury in his report recommends 5 per cent;\r\nCongress, in a bill passed prior to adjournment on the 27th of July\r\nlast, agreed upon 4 and 4 1/2 per cent; while by many 3 per cent has\r\nbeen held to be an amply sufficient return for the investment. The\r\ngeneral impression as to the exorbitancy of the existing rate of\r\ninterest has led to an inquiry in the public mind respecting the\r\nconsideration which the Government has actually received for its bonds,\r\nand the conclusion is becoming prevalent that the amount which it\r\nobtained was in real money three or four hundred per cent less than the\r\nobligations which it issued in return. It can not be denied that we are\r\npaying an extravagant percentage for the use of the money borrowed,\r\nwhich was paper currency, greatly depreciated below the value of coin.\r\nThis fact is made apparent when we consider that bondholders receive\r\nfrom the Treasury upon each dollar they own in Government securities 6\r\nper cent in gold, which is nearly or quite equal to 9 per cent in\r\ncurrency; that the bonds are then converted into capital for the\r\nnational banks, upon which those institutions issue their circulation,\r\nbearing 6 per cent interest; and that they are exempt from taxation by\r\nthe Government and the States, and thereby enhanced 2 per cent in the\r\nhands of the holders. We thus have an aggregate of 17 per cent which\r\nmay be received upon each dollar by the owners of Government\r\nsecurities. A system that produces such results is justly regarded as\r\nfavoring a few at the expense of the many, and has led to the further\r\ninquiry whether our bondholders, in view of the large profits which\r\nthey have enjoyed, would themselves be averse to a settlement of our\r\nindebtedness upon a plan which would yield them a fair remuneration and\r\nat the same time be just to the taxpayers of the nation. Our national\r\ncredit should be sacredly observed, but in making provision for our\r\ncreditors we should not forget what is due to the masses of the people.\r\nIt may be assumed that the holders of our securities have already\r\nreceived upon their bonds a larger amount than their original\r\ninvestment, measured by a gold standard. Upon this statement of facts\r\nit would seem but just and equitable that the 6 per cent interest now\r\npaid by the Government should be applied to the reduction of the\r\nprincipal in semiannual installments, which in sixteen years and eight\r\nmonths would liquidate the entire national debt. Six per cent in gold\r\nwould at present rates be equal to 9 per cent in currency, and\r\nequivalent to the payment of the debt one and a half times in a\r\nfraction less than seventeen years. This, in connection with all the\r\nother advantages derived from their investment, would afford to the\r\npublic creditors a fair and liberal compensation for the use of their\r\ncapital, and with this they should be satisfied. The lessons of the\r\npast admonish the lender that it is not well to be over-anxious in\r\nexacting from the borrower rigid compliance with the letter of the\r\nbond.\r\n\r\nIf provision be made for the payment of the indebtedness of the\r\nGovernment in the manner suggested, our nation will rapidly recover its\r\nwonted prosperity. Its interests require that some measure should be\r\ntaken to release the large amount of capital invested in the securities\r\nof the Government. It is not now merely unproductive, but in taxation\r\nannually consumes $150,000,000, which would otherwise be used by our\r\nenterprising people in adding to the wealth of the nation. Our\r\ncommerce, which at one time successfully rivaled that of the great\r\nmaritime powers, has rapidly diminished, and our industrial interests\r\nare in a depressed and languishing condition. The development of our\r\ninexhaustible resources is checked, and the fertile fields of the South\r\nare becoming waste for want of means to till them. With the release of\r\ncapital, new life would be infused into the paralyzed energies of our\r\npeople and activity and vigor imparted to every branch of industry. Our\r\npeople need encouragement in their efforts to recover from the effects\r\nof the rebellion and of injudicious legislation, and it should be the\r\naim of the Government to stimulate them by the prospect of an early\r\nrelease from the burdens which impede their prosperity. If we can not\r\ntake the burdens from their shoulders, we should at least manifest a\r\nwillingness to help to bear them.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the condition of the circulating medium, I shall merely\r\nreiterate substantially that portion of my last annual message which\r\nrelates to that subject.\r\n\r\nThe proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the\r\nwhole value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a question\r\nupon which political economists have not agreed. Nor can it be\r\ncontrolled by legislation, but must be left to the irrevocable laws\r\nwhich everywhere regulate commerce and trade. The circulating medium\r\nwill ever irresistibly flow to those points where it is in greatest\r\ndemand. The law of demand and supply is as unerring as that which\r\nregulates the tides of the ocean; and, indeed, currency, like the\r\ntides, has its ebbs and flows throughout the commercial world.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the rebellion the bank-note circulation of the\r\ncountry amounted to not much more than $200,000,000; now the\r\ncirculation of national-bank notes and those known as \"legal-tenders\"\r\nis nearly seven hundred millions. While it is urged by some that this\r\namount should be increased, others contend that a decided reduction is\r\nabsolutely essential to the best interests of the country. In view of\r\nthese diverse opinions, it may be well to ascertain the real value of\r\nour paper issues when compared with a metallic or convertible currency.\r\nFor this purpose let us inquire how much gold and silver could be\r\npurchased by the seven hundred millions of paper money now in\r\ncirculation. Probably not more than half the amount of the latter;\r\nshowing that when our paper currency is compared with gold and silver\r\nits commercial value is compressed into three hundred and fifty\r\nmillions. This striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the\r\nGovernment, as early as may be consistent with the principles of sound\r\npolitical economy, to take such measures as will enable the holders of\r\nits notes and those of the national banks to convert them, without\r\nloss, into specie or its equivalent. A reduction of our paper\r\ncirculating medium need not necessarily follow. This, however, would\r\ndepend upon the law of demand and supply, though it should be borne in\r\nmind that by making legal-tender and bank notes convertible into coin\r\nor its equivalent their present specie value in the hands of their\r\nholders would be enhanced 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nLegislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded\r\nby the highest public considerations. The Constitution contemplates\r\nthat the circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality\r\nand value. At the time of the formation of that instrument the country\r\nhad just emerged from the War of the Revolution, and was suffering from\r\nthe effects of a redundant and worthless paper currency. The sages of\r\nthat period were anxious to protect their posterity from the evils\r\nwhich they themselves had experienced. Hence in providing a circulating\r\nmedium they conferred upon Congress the power to coin money and\r\nregulate the value thereof, at the same time prohibiting the States\r\nfrom making anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with\r\nthat which was originally designed. Our circulation now embraces,\r\nfirst, notes of the national banks, which are made receivable for all\r\ndues to the Government, excluding imposts, and by all its creditors,\r\nexcepting in payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities\r\nthemselves; second, legal tender, issued by the United States, and\r\nwhich the law requires shall be received as well in payment of all\r\ndebts between citizens as of all Government dues, excepting imposts;\r\nand, third, gold and silver coin. By the operation of our present\r\nsystem of finance however, the metallic currency, when collected, is\r\nreserved only for one class of Government creditors, who, holding its\r\nbonds, semiannually receive their interest in coin from the National\r\nTreasury. There is no reason which will be accepted as satisfactory by\r\nthe people why those who defend us on the land and protect us on the\r\nsea; the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation, bearing the scars\r\nand wounds received while in its service; the public servants in the\r\nvarious departments of the Government; the farmer who supplies the\r\nsoldiers of the Army and the sailors of the Navy; the artisan who toils\r\nin the nation's workshops, or the mechanics and laborers who build its\r\nedifices and construct its forts and vessels of war, should, in payment\r\nof their just and hard-earned dues, receive depreciated paper, while\r\nanother class of their countrymen, no more deserving are paid in coin\r\nof gold and silver. Equal and exact justice requires that all the\r\ncreditors of the Government should be paid in a currency possessing a\r\nuniform value. This can only be accomplished by the restoration of the\r\ncurrency to the standard established by the Constitution, and by this\r\nmeans we would remove a discrimination which may, if it has not already\r\ndone so, create a prejudice that may become deep-rooted and widespread\r\nand imperil the national credit.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of making our currency correspond with the\r\nconstitutional standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived\r\nfrom our commercial statistics.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate product of precious metals in the United States from 1849\r\nto 1867 amounted to $1,174,000,000, while for the same period the net\r\nexports of specie were $741,000,000. This shows an excess of product\r\nover net exports of $433,000,000. There are in the Treasury\r\n$103,407,985 in coin; in circulation in the States on the Pacific Coast\r\nabout $40,000,000, and a few millions in the national and other\r\nbanks--in all less than $160,000,000. Taking into consideration the\r\nspecie in the country prior to 1849 and that produced since 1867, and\r\nwe have more than $300,000,000 not accounted for by exportation or by\r\nreturns of the Treasury, and therefore most probably remaining in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThese are important facts, and show how completely the inferior\r\ncurrency will supersede the better, forcing it from circulation among\r\nthe masses and causing it to be exported as a mere article of trade, to\r\nadd to the money capital of foreign lands. They show the necessity of\r\nretiring our paper money, that the return of gold and silver to the\r\navenues of trade may be invited and a demand created which will cause\r\nthe retention at home of at least so much of the productions of our\r\nrich and inexhaustible gold-bearing fields as may be sufficient for\r\npurposes of circulation. It is unreasonable to expect a return to a\r\nsound currency so long as the Government and banks, by continuing to\r\nissue irredeemable notes, fill the channels of circulation with\r\ndepreciated paper. Notwithstanding a coinage by our mints since 1849 of\r\n$874,000,000, the people are now strangers to the currency which was\r\ndesigned for their use and benefit, and specimens of the precious\r\nmetals bearing the national device are seldom seen, except when\r\nproduced to gratify the interest excited by their novelty. If\r\ndepreciated paper is to be continued as the permanent currency of the\r\ncountry, and all our coin is to become a mere article of traffic and\r\nspeculation to the enhancement in price of all that is indispensable to\r\nthe comfort of the people, it would be wise economy to abolish our\r\nmints, thus saving the nation the care and expense incident to such\r\nestablishments, and let our precious metals be exported in bullion. The\r\ntime has come, however, when the Government and national banks should\r\nbe required to take the most efficient steps and make all necessary\r\narrangements for a resumption of specie payments. Let specie payments\r\nonce be earnestly inaugurated by the Government and banks, and the\r\nvalue of the paper circulation would directly approximate a specie\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nSpecie payments having been resumed by the Government and banks, all\r\nnotes or bills of paper issued by either of a less denomination than\r\n$20 should by law be excluded from circulation, so that the people may\r\nhave the benefit and convenience of a gold and silver currency which in\r\nall their business transactions will be uniform in value at home and\r\nabroad. Every man of property or industry, every man who desires to\r\npreserve what he honestly possesses or to obtain what he can honestly\r\nearn, has a direct interest in maintaining a safe circulating\r\nmedium--such a medium as shall be real and substantial, not liable to\r\nvibrate with opinions, not subject to be blown up or blown down by the\r\nbreath of speculation, but to be made stable and secure. A disordered\r\ncurrency is one of the greatest political evils. It undermines the\r\nvirtues necessary for the support of the social system and encourages\r\npropensities destructive of its happiness; it wars against industry,\r\nfrugality, and economy, and it fosters the evil spirits of extravagance\r\nand speculation. It has been asserted by one of our profound and most\r\ngifted statesmen that--Of all the contrivances for cheating the\r\nlaboring classes of mankind, none has been more effectual than that\r\nwhich deludes them with paper money. This is the most effectual of\r\ninventions to fertilize the rich man's fields by the sweat of the poor\r\nman's brow. Ordinary tyranny, oppression, excessive taxation--these\r\nbear lightly on the happiness of the mass of the community compared\r\nwith a fraudulent currency and the robberies committed by depreciated\r\npaper. Our own history has recorded for our instruction enough, and\r\nmore than enough, of the demoralizing tendency, the injustice, and the\r\nintolerable oppression on the virtuous and well-disposed of a degraded\r\npaper currency authorized by law or in any way countenanced by\r\ngovernment. It is one of the most successful devices, in times of peace\r\nor war, of expansions or revulsions, to accomplish the transfer of all\r\nthe precious metals from the great mass of the people into the hands of\r\nthe few, where they are hoarded in secret places or deposited under\r\nbolts and bars, while the people are left to endure all the\r\ninconvenience, sacrifice, and demoralization resulting from the use of\r\ndepreciated and worthless paper.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior in his report gives valuable information\r\nin reference to the interests confided to the supervision of his\r\nDepartment, and reviews the operations of the Land Office, Pension\r\nOffice, Patent Office, and Indian Bureau.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year ending June 30. 1868, 6,655,700 acres of public\r\nland were disposed of. The entire cash receipts of the General Land\r\nOffice for the same period were $1,632,745, being greater by $284,883\r\nthan the amount realized from the same sources during the previous\r\nyear. The entries under the homestead law cover 2,328,923 acres, nearly\r\none-fourth of which was taken under the act of June 21, 1866, which\r\napplies only to the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, and Florida.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1868, 169,643 names were borne on the pension\r\nrolls, and during the year ending on that day the total amount paid for\r\npensions, including the expenses of disbursement, was $24,010,982,\r\nbeing $5,391,025 greater than that expended for like purposes during\r\nthe preceding year.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending the 30th of September last the expenses of the\r\nPatent Office exceeded the receipts by $171, and, including reissues\r\nand designs, 14,153 patents were issued.\r\n\r\nTreaties with various Indian tribes have been concluded, and will be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate for its constitutional action. I cordially\r\nsanction the stipulations which provide for reserving lands for the\r\nvarious tribes, where they may be encouraged to abandon their nomadic\r\nhabits and engage in agricultural and industrial pursuits. This policy,\r\ninaugurated many years since, has met with signal success whenever it\r\nhas been pursued in good faith and with becoming liberality by the\r\nUnited States. The necessity for extending it as far as practicable in\r\nour relations with the aboriginal population is greater now than at any\r\npreceding period. Whilst we furnish subsistence and instruction to the\r\nIndians and guarantee the undisturbed enjoyment of their treaty rights,\r\nwe should habitually insist upon the faithful observance of their\r\nagreement to remain within their respective reservations. This is the\r\nonly mode by which collisions with other tribes and with the whites can\r\nbe avoided and the safety of our frontier settlements secured.\r\n\r\nThe companies constructing the railway from Omaha to Sacramento have\r\nbeen most energetically engaged in prosecuting the work, and it is\r\nbelieved that the line will be completed before the expiration of the\r\nnext fiscal year. The 6 per cent bonds issued to these companies\r\namounted on the 5th instant to $44,337,000, and additional work had\r\nbeen performed to the extent of $3,200,000.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior in August last invited my attention to\r\nthe report of a Government director of the Union Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany who had been specially instructed to examine the location,\r\nconstruction, and equipment of their road. I submitted for the opinion\r\nof the Attorney-General certain questions in regard to the authority of\r\nthe Executive which arose upon this report and those which had from\r\ntime to time been presented by the commissioners appointed to inspect\r\neach successive section of the work. After carefully considering the\r\nlaw of the case, he affirmed the right of the Executive to order, if\r\nnecessary, a thorough revision of the entire road. Commissioners were\r\nthereupon appointed to examine this and other lines, and have recently\r\nsubmitted a statement of their investigations, of which the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior furnishes specific information.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War contains information of interest and\r\nimportance respecting the several bureaus of the War Department and the\r\noperations of the Army. The strength of our military force on the 30th\r\nof September last was 48,000 men, and it is computed that by the 1st of\r\nJanuary next this number will be decreased to 43,000. It is the opinion\r\nof the Secretary of War that within the next year a considerable\r\ndiminution of the infantry force may be made without detriment to the\r\ninterests of the country; and in view of the great expense attending\r\nthe military peace establishment and the absolute necessity of\r\nretrenchment wherever it can be applied, it is hoped that Congress will\r\nsanction the reduction which his report recommends. While in 1860\r\nsixteen thousand three hundred men cost the nation $16,472,000, the sum\r\nof $65,682,000 is estimated as necessary for the support of the Army\r\nduring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1870. The estimates of the War\r\nDepartment for the last two fiscal years were, for 1867, $33,814,461,\r\nand for 1868 $25,205,669. The actual expenditures during the same\r\nperiods were, respectively, $95,224,415 and $123,246,648. The estimate\r\nsubmitted in December last for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869,\r\nwas $77,124,707; the expenditures for the first quarter, ending the\r\n30th of September last, were $27,219,117, and the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury gives $66,000,000 as the amount which will probably be\r\nrequired during the remaining three quarters, if there should be no\r\nreduction of the Army--making its aggregate cost for the year\r\nconsiderably in excess of ninety-three millions. The difference between\r\nthe estimates and expenditures for the three fiscal years which have\r\nbeen named is thus shown to be $175,545,343 for this single branch of\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the operations of that\r\nDepartment and of the Navy during the year. A considerable reduction of\r\nthe force has been effected. There are 42 vessels, carrying 411 guns,\r\nin the six squadrons which are established in different parts of the\r\nworld. Three of these vessels are returning to the United States and 4\r\nare used as storeships, leaving the actual cruising force 35 vessels,\r\ncarrying 356 guns. The total number of vessels in the Navy is 206,\r\nmounting 1,743 guns. Eighty-one vessels of every description are in\r\nuse, armed with 696 guns. The number of enlisted men in the service,\r\nincluding apprentices, has been reduced to 8,500. An increase of\r\nnavy-yard facilities is recommended as a measure which will in the\r\nevent of war be promotive of economy and security. A more thorough and\r\nsystematic survey of the North Pacific Ocean is advised in view of our\r\nrecent acquisitions, our expanding commerce, and the increasing\r\nintercourse between the Pacific States and Asia. The naval pension\r\nfund, which consists of a moiety of the avails of prizes captured\r\nduring the war, amounts to $14,000,000. Exception is taken to the act\r\nof 23d July last, which reduces the interest on the fund loaned to the\r\nGovernment by the Secretary, as trustee, to 3 per cent instead of 6 per\r\ncent, which was originally stipulated when the investment was made. An\r\namendment of the pension laws is suggested to remedy omissions and\r\ndefects in existing enactments. The expenditures of the Department\r\nduring the last fiscal year were $20,120,394, and the estimates for the\r\ncoming year amount to $20,993,414.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General's report furnishes a full and clear exhibit of\r\nthe operations and condition of the postal service. The ordinary postal\r\nrevenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868. was $16,292,600, and\r\nthe total expenditures, embracing all the service for which special\r\nappropriations have been made by Congress, amounted to $22,730,592,\r\nshowing an excess of expenditures of $6,437,991. Deducting from the\r\nexpenditures the sum of $1,896,525, the amount of appropriations for\r\nocean-steamship and other special service, the excess of expenditures\r\nwas $4,541,466. By using an unexpended balance in the Treasury of\r\n$3,800,000 the actual sum for which a special appropriation is required\r\nto meet the deficiency is $741,466. The causes which produced this\r\nlarge excess of expenditure over revenue were the restoration of\r\nservice in the late insurgent States and the putting into operation of\r\nnew service established by acts of Congress, which amounted within the\r\nlast two years and a half to about 48,700 miles--equal to more than\r\none-third of the whole amount of the service at the close of the war.\r\nNew postal conventions with Great Britain, North Germany, Belgium, the\r\nNetherlands, Switzerland, and Italy, respectively, have been carried\r\ninto effect. Under their provisions important improvements have\r\nresulted in reduced rates of international postage and enlarged mail\r\nfacilities with European countries. The cost of the United States\r\ntransatlantic ocean mail service since January 1, 1868, has been\r\nlargely lessened under the operation of these new conventions, a\r\nreduction of over one-half having been effected under the new\r\narrangements for ocean mail steamship service which went into effect on\r\nthat date. The attention of Congress is invited to the practical\r\nsuggestions and recommendations made in his report by the\r\nPostmaster-General.\r\n\r\nNo important question has occurred during the last year in our\r\naccustomed cordial and friendly intercourse with Costa Rica, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, San Salvador, France, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland,\r\nPortugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Rome, Greece,\r\nTurkey, Persia, Egypt, Liberia, Morocco, Tripoli, Tunis, Muscat, Siam,\r\nBorneo, and Madagascar.\r\n\r\nCordial relations have also been maintained with the Argentine and the\r\nOriental Republics. The expressed wish of Congress that our national\r\ngood offices might be tendered to those Republics, and also to Brazil\r\nand Paraguay, for bringing to an end the calamitous war which has so\r\nlong been raging in the valley of the La Plata, has been assiduously\r\ncomplied with and kindly acknowledged by all the belligerents. That\r\nimportant negotiation, however, has thus far been without result.\r\n\r\nCharles A. Washburn, late United States minister to Paraguay, having\r\nresigned, and being desirous to return to the United States, the\r\nrear-admiral commanding the South Atlantic Squadron was early directed\r\nto send a ship of war to Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, to receive\r\nMr. Washburn and his family and remove them from a situation which was\r\nrepresented to be endangered by faction and foreign war. The Brazilian\r\ncommander of the allied invading forces refused permission to the Wasp\r\nto pass through the blockading forces, and that vessel returned to its\r\naccustomed anchorage. Remonstrance having been made against this\r\nrefusal, it was promptly overruled, and the Wasp therefore resumed her\r\nerrand, received Mr. Washburn and his family, and conveyed them to a\r\nsafe and convenient seaport. In the meantime an excited controversy had\r\narisen between the President of Paraguay and the late United States\r\nminister, which, it is understood, grew out of his proceedings in\r\ngiving asylum in the United States legation to alleged enemies of that\r\nRepublic. The question of the right to give asylum is one always\r\ndifficult and often productive of great embarrassment. In states well\r\norganized and established, foreign powers refuse either to concede or\r\nexercise that right, except as to persons actually belonging to the\r\ndiplomatic service. On the other hand, all such powers insist upon\r\nexercising the right of asylum in states where the law of nations is\r\nnot fully acknowledged, respected, and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe President of Paraguay is understood to have opposed to Mr.\r\nWashburn's proceedings the injurious and very improbable charge of\r\npersonal complicity in insurrection and treason. The correspondence,\r\nhowever, has not yet reached the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Washburn, in connection with this controversy, represents that two\r\nUnited States citizens attached to the legation were arbitrarily seized\r\nat his side, when leaving the capital of Paraguay, committed to prison,\r\nand there subjected to torture for the purpose of procuring confessions\r\nof their own criminality and testimony to support the President's\r\nallegation against the United States minister. Mr. McMahon, the newly\r\nappointed minister to Paraguay, having reached the La Plata, has been\r\ninstructed to proceed without delay to Asuncion, there to investigate\r\nthe whole subject. The rear-admiral commanding the United States South\r\nAtlantic Squadron has been directed to attend the new minister with a\r\nproper naval force to sustain such just demands as the occasion may\r\nrequire, and to vindicate the rights of the United States citizens\r\nreferred to and of any others who may be exposed to danger in the\r\ntheater of war. With these exceptions, friendly relations have been\r\nmaintained between the United States and Brazil and Paraguay.\r\n\r\nOur relations during the past year with Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and\r\nChile have become especially friendly and cordial. Spain and the\r\nRepublics of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador have expressed their\r\nwillingness to accept the mediation of the United States for\r\nterminating the war upon the South Pacific coast. Chile has not finally\r\ndeclared upon the question. In the meantime the conflict has\r\npractically exhausted itself, since no belligerent or hostile movement\r\nhas been made by either party during the last two years, and there are\r\nno indications of a present purpose to resume hostilities on either\r\nside. Great Britain and France have cordially seconded our proposition\r\nof mediation, and I do not forego the hope that it may soon be accepted\r\nby all the belligerents and lead to a secure establishment of peace and\r\nfriendly relations between the Spanish American Republics of the\r\nPacific and Spain--a result which would be attended with common\r\nbenefits to the belligerents and much advantage to all commercial\r\nnations. I communicate, for the consideration of Congress, a\r\ncorrespondence which shows that the Bolivian Republic has established\r\nthe extremely liberal principle of receiving into its citizenship any\r\ncitizen of the United States, or of any other of the American\r\nRepublics, upon the simple condition of voluntary registry.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence herewith submitted will be found painfully replete\r\nwith accounts of the ruin and wretchedness produced by recent\r\nearthquakes, of unparalleled severity, in the Republics of Peru,\r\nEcuador, and Bolivia. The diplomatic agents and naval officers of the\r\nUnited States who were present in those countries at the time of those\r\ndisasters furnished all the relief in their power to the sufferers, and\r\nwere promptly rewarded with grateful and touching acknowledgments by\r\nthe Congress of Peru. An appeal to the charity of our fellow-citizens\r\nhas been answered by much liberality. In this connection I submit an\r\nappeal which has been made by the Swiss Republic, whose Government and\r\ninstitutions are kindred to our own, in behalf of its inhabitants, who\r\nare suffering extreme destitution, produced by recent devastating\r\ninundations.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico during the year have been marked by an\r\nincreasing growth of mutual confidence. The Mexican Government has not\r\nyet acted upon the three treaties celebrated here last summer for\r\nestablishing the rights of naturalized citizens upon a liberal and just\r\nbasis, for regulating consular powers, and for the adjustment of mutual\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nAll commercial nations, as well as all friends of republican\r\ninstitutions, have occasion to regret the frequent local disturbances\r\nwhich occur in some of the constituent States of Colombia. Nothing has\r\noccurred, however, to affect the harmony and cordial friendship which\r\nhave for several years existed between that youthful and vigorous\r\nRepublic and our own.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are pending with a view to the survey and construction of\r\na ship canal across the Isthmus of Darien, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited States. I hope to be able to submit the results of that\r\nnegotiation to the Senate during its present session.\r\n\r\nThe very liberal treaty which was entered into last year by the United\r\nStates and Nicaragua has been ratified by the latter Republic.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica, with the earnestness of a sincerely friendly neighbor,\r\nsolicits a reciprocity of trade, which I commend to the consideration\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe convention created by treaty between the United States and\r\nVenezuela in July, 1865, for the mutual adjustment of claims, has been\r\nheld, and its decisions have been received at the Department of State.\r\nThe heretofore-recognized Government of the United States of Venezuela\r\nhas been subverted. A provisional government having been instituted\r\nunder circumstances which promise durability, it has been formally\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nI have been reluctantly obliged to ask explanation and satisfaction for\r\nnational injuries committed by the President of Hayti. The political\r\nand social condition of the Republics of Hayti and St. Domingo is very\r\nunsatisfactory and painful. The abolition of slavery, which has been\r\ncarried into effect throughout the island of St. Domingo and the entire\r\nWest Indies, except the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico, has\r\nbeen followed by a profound popular conviction of the rightfulness of\r\nrepublican institutions and an intense desire to secure them. The\r\nattempt, however, to establish republics there encounters many\r\nobstacles, most of which may be supposed to result from long-indulged\r\nhabits of colonial supineness and dependence upon European monarchical\r\npowers. While the United States have on all occasions professed a\r\ndecided unwillingness that any part of this continent or of its\r\nadjacent islands shall be made a theater for a new establishment of\r\nmonarchical power, too little has been done by us, on the other hand,\r\nto attach the communities by which we are surrounded to our own\r\ncountry, or to lend even a moral support to the efforts they are so\r\nresolutely and so constantly making to secure republican institutions\r\nfor themselves. It is indeed a question of grave consideration whether\r\nour recent and present example is not calculated to check the growth\r\nand expansion of free principles, and make those communities distrust,\r\nif not dread, a government which at will consigns to military\r\ndomination States that are integral parts of our Federal Union, and,\r\nwhile ready to resist any attempts by other nations to extend to this\r\nhemisphere the monarchical institutions of Europe, assumes to establish\r\nover a large portion of its people a rule more absolute, harsh, and\r\ntyrannical than any known to civilized powers.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Alaska was made with the view of extending national\r\njurisdiction and republican principles in the American hemisphere.\r\nBelieving that a further step could be taken in the same direction, I\r\nlast year entered into a treaty with the King of Denmark for the\r\npurchase of the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, on the best terms\r\nthen attainable, and with the express consent of the people of those\r\nislands. This treaty still remains under consideration in the Senate. A\r\nnew convention has been entered into with Denmark, enlarging the time\r\nfixed for final ratification of the original treaty.\r\n\r\nComprehensive national policy would seem to sanction the acquisition\r\nand incorporation into our Federal Union of the several adjacent\r\ncontinental and insular communities as speedily as it can be done\r\npeacefully, lawfully, and without any violation of national justice,\r\nfaith, or honor. Foreign possession or control of those communities has\r\nhitherto hindered the growth and impaired the influence of the United\r\nStates. Chronic revolution and anarchy there would be equally\r\ninjurious. Each one of them, when firmly established as an independent\r\nrepublic, or when incorporated into the United States, would be a new\r\nsource of strength and power. Conforming my Administration to these\r\nprinciples, I have or no occasion lent support or toleration to\r\nunlawful expeditions set on foot upon the plea of republican\r\npropagandism or of national extension or aggrandizement. The necessity,\r\nhowever, of repressing such unlawful movements clearly indicates the\r\nduty which rests upon us of adapting our legislative action to the new\r\ncircumstances of a decline of European monarchical power and influence\r\nand the increase of American republican ideas, interests, and\r\nsympathies.\r\n\r\nIt can not be long before it will become necessary for this Government\r\nto lend some effective aid to the solution of the political and social\r\nproblems which are continually kept before the world by the two\r\nRepublics of the island of St. Domingo, and which are now disclosing\r\nthemselves more distinctly than heretofore in the island of Cuba. The\r\nsubject is commended to your consideration with all the more\r\nearnestness because I am satisfied that the time has arrived when even\r\nso direct a proceeding as a proposition for an annexation of the two\r\nRepublics of the island of St. Domingo would not only receive the\r\nconsent of the people interested, but would also give satisfaction to\r\nall other foreign nations.\r\n\r\nI am aware that upon the question of further extending our possessions\r\nit is apprehended by some that our political system can not\r\nsuccessfully be applied to an area more extended than our continent;\r\nbut the conviction is rapidly gaining ground in the American mind that\r\nwith the increased facilities for intercommunication between all\r\nportions of the earth the principles of free government, as embraced in\r\nour Constitution, if faithfully maintained and carried out, would prove\r\nof sufficient strength and breadth to comprehend within their sphere\r\nand influence the civilized nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Senate and of Congress is again respectfully\r\ninvited to the treaty for the establishment of commercial reciprocity\r\nwith the Hawaiian Kingdom entered into last year, and already ratified\r\nby that Government. The attitude of the United States toward these\r\nislands is not very different from that in which they stand toward the\r\nWest Indies. It is known and felt by the Hawaiian Government and people\r\nthat their Government and institutions are feeble and precarious; that\r\nthe United States, being so near a neighbor, would be unwilling to see\r\nthe islands pass under foreign control. Their prosperity is continually\r\ndisturbed by expectations and alarms of unfriendly political\r\nproceedings, as well from the United States as from other foreign\r\npowers. A reciprocity treaty, while it could not materially diminish\r\nthe revenues of the United States, would be a guaranty of the good will\r\nand forbearance of all nations until the people of the islands shall of\r\nthemselves, at no distant day, voluntarily apply for admission into the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia has acceded to the treaty negotiated here in\r\nJanuary last for the security of trade-marks in the interest of\r\nmanufacturers and commerce. I have invited his attention to the\r\nimportance of establishing, now while it seems easy and practicable, a\r\nfair and equal regulation of the vast fisheries belonging to the two\r\nnations in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe two treaties between the United States and Italy for the regulation\r\nof consular powers and the extradition of criminals, negotiated and\r\nratified here during the last session of Congress, have been accepted\r\nand confirmed by the Italian Government. A liberal consular convention\r\nwhich has been negotiated with Belgium will be submitted to the Senate.\r\nThe very important treaties which were negotiated between the United\r\nStates and North Germany and Bavaria for the regulation of the rights\r\nof naturalized citizens have been duly ratified and exchanged, and\r\nsimilar treaties have been entered into with the Kingdoms of Belgium\r\nand Wurtemberg and with the Grand Duchies of Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt.\r\nI hope soon to be able to submit equally satisfactory conventions of\r\nthe same character now in the course of negotiation with the respective\r\nGovernments of Spain, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nExamination of claims against the United States by the Hudsons Bay\r\nCompany and the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, on account of certain\r\npossessory rights in the State of Oregon and Territory of Washington,\r\nalleged by those companies in virtue of provisions of the treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain of June 15, 1846, has been\r\ndiligently prosecuted, under the direction of the joint international\r\ncommission to which they were submitted for adjudication by treaty\r\nbetween the two Governments of July 1, 1863, and will, it is expected,\r\nbe concluded at an early day.\r\n\r\nNo practical regulation concerning colonial trade and the fisheries can\r\nbe accomplished by treaty between the United States and Great Britain\r\nuntil Congress shall have expressed their judgment concerning the\r\nprinciples involved. Three other questions, however, between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain remain open for adjustment. These are the\r\nmutual rights of naturalized citizens, the boundary question involving\r\nthe title to the island of San Juan, on the Pacific coast, and mutual\r\nclaims arising since the year 1853 of the citizens and subjects of the\r\ntwo countries for injuries and depredations committed under the\r\nauthority of their respective Governments. Negotiations upon these\r\nsubjects are pending, and I am not without hope of being able to lay\r\nbefore the Senate, for its consideration during the present session,\r\nprotocols calculated to bring to an end these justly exciting and\r\nlong-existing controversies.\r\n\r\nWe are not advised of the action of the Chinese Government upon the\r\nliberal and auspicious treaty which was recently celebrated with its\r\nplenipotentiaries at this capital.\r\n\r\nJapan remains a theater of civil war, marked by religious incidents and\r\npolitical severities peculiar to that long-isolated Empire. The\r\nExecutive has hitherto maintained strict neutrality among the\r\nbelligerents, and acknowledges with pleasure that it has been frankly\r\nand fully sustained in that course by the enlightened concurrence and\r\ncooperation of the other treaty powers, namely Great Britain, France,\r\nthe Netherlands, North Germany, and Italy.\r\n\r\nSpain having recently undergone a revolution marked by extraordinary\r\nunanimity and preservation of order, the provisional government\r\nestablished at Madrid has been recognized, and the friendly intercourse\r\nwhich has so long happily existed between the two countries remains\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation contained in my communication to Congress\r\ndated the 18th July last--a copy of which accompanies this message that\r\nthe judgment of the people should be taken on the propriety of so\r\namending the Federal Constitution that it shall provide--\r\n\r\nFirst. For an election of President and Vice-President by a direct vote\r\nof the people, instead of through the agency of electors, and making\r\nthem ineligible for reelection to a second term.\r\n\r\nSecond. For a distinct designation of the person who shall discharge\r\nthe duties of President in the event of a vacancy in that office by the\r\ndeath, resignation, or removal of both the President and\r\nVice-President.\r\n\r\nThird. For the election of Senators of the United States directly by\r\nthe people of the several States, instead of by the legislatures; and\r\n\r\nFourth. For the limitation to a period of years of the terms of Federal\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nProfoundly impressed with the propriety of making these important\r\nmodifications in the Constitution, I respectfully submit them for the\r\nearly and mature consideration of Congress. We should, as far as\r\npossible, remove all pretext for violations of the organic law, by\r\nremedying such imperfections as time and experience may develop, ever\r\nremembering that \"the constitution which at any time exists until\r\nchanged by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is\r\nsacredly obligatory upon all.\"\r\n\r\nIn the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the Constitution, I\r\nhave thus communicated to Congress information of the state of the\r\nUnion and recommended for their consideration such measures as have\r\nseemed to me necessary and expedient. If carried into effect, they will\r\nhasten the accomplishment of the great and beneficent purposes for\r\nwhich the Constitution was ordained, and which it comprehensively\r\nstates were \"to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure\r\ndomestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the\r\ngeneral welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and\r\nour posterity.\" In Congress are vested all legislative powers, and upon\r\nthem devolves the responsibility as well for framing unwise and\r\nexcessive laws as for neglecting to devise and adopt measures\r\nabsolutely demanded by the wants of the country. Let us earnestly hope\r\nthat before the expiration of our respective terms of service, now\r\nrapidly drawing to a close, an all-wise Providence will so guide our\r\ncounsels as to strengthen and preserve the Federal Unions, inspire\r\nreverence for the Constitution, restore prosperity and happiness to our\r\nwhole people, and promote \"on earth peace, good will toward men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's State of the Union Addresses, by Andrew Johnson",
