In this book little or nothing is said of any of\r\nthese matters; they do not interest me; they are superficial, and I do\r\nnot care for surface things; they are what divide, and truth is what\r\nunites.\r\n\r\nIt is of the humanity which India shares with the rest of the world,\r\nthe hearts that beat always the same under whatever skin, the ideals\r\nthat can never be choked by no matter what customs or religions, that\r\nthis book is concerned with.\r\n\r\nIndia sees life through different windows than we do; but her eyes are\r\nas our eyes, and she has the same desires as we have.  She has been\r\nnearly dead or sleeping for long, but at last she moves.  She is awake\r\nor waking.  Should it not be our task, our pleasure and our pride, to\r\nhelp her early steps along the path of conscious strength that leads to\r\na national life such as that we have been proud of?  And to do so must\r\nwe not try to understand her?\r\n\r\nHave we ever tried?\r\n\r\nI do not think we have; but the time is coming when, unless we can go\r\nhand in hand with her along her path to nationhood, she will desert us.\r\nHer destiny is calling her; shall we keep her back?\r\n\r\nWe cannot keep her back.  \"No one can be more wise than Destiny.\"  And\r\nif we stand in her way, who will suffer like we shall?  For her sake\r\nand for ours should we not try to understand?\r\n\r\nThis book is an attempt at a beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n  PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I\r\n\r\n  THE OLD INDIA\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n  I.

There are no reports of seditious meetings,\r\nincendiary propaganda, or disloyal tendencies.  The attempt upon the\r\nViceroy is declared to be an isolated act, springing from no general\r\ncause; a sporadic outbreak of crime which has no importance.  No\r\nspecial measures have to be taken, nor special legislation passed,\r\nthough the old repressive legislation is not repealed.  In the English\r\ndaily papers there is little said of India, and no news is said to be\r\ngood news.  Therefore in public estimation India has fallen back from\r\nher temporary fever into the immemorial apathy of the East.  She is\r\ncontent, and no one need trouble himself about her.  The sedition was\r\nbut a froth upon the surface, it had no deep-lying causes; it was\r\ntemporary, local, unimportant.  We need trouble ourselves no more about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere could be no greater nor more fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nThere may have been outbursts of irritation like that over the Bengal\r\npartition which have passed because the cause was removed; we may be\r\nnow in the trough and not upon the crest of a wave, but that is all\r\nthat can be said.  The discontent has not passed, nor will it, nor can\r\nit pass.  It is deep-rooted in the very nature of things as they are\r\nnow.  It is not local, nor is it confined to one or two strata of\r\nsociety, nor is it directed against one or two acts of Government.  It\r\nis universal, in all provinces, in all classes, directed not against\r\nthis act or that act, but against the Government as a whole.  This is\r\nvery evident to those upon the spot, has been evident for many years.\r\nThe reason more has not been said about it is the absurd notion that\r\ntalking of the discontent will tend to increase it, as if real\r\ndiscontent ever arose from words, or as if it could be understood\r\nunless it were talked about.  It should also be evident to those not\r\nupon the spot who reflect on causes and effects.  For instance, could\r\nthe partition of Bengal have raised such a sudden flame had there been\r\npeace before?  People in neither the East nor the West are roused into\r\nsuch sudden and fierce anger by an administrative change even if the\r\nchange is not to their tastes.  For there was no real change of\r\ngovernment, nor substantive hardship.  The hardship was sentimental\r\nhardship at the worst, not the less a real hardship for that.\r\n\r\nNo.  There was discontent before, and the partition only fanned it into\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nAnd that discontent is not sudden.  It has grown slowly for many years.\r\nIt is not local; in one province it may be more apparent than in\r\nanother, but it is universal.  It is not temporary, but increases.  So\r\nmuch is admitted by those who know.  Yet no one thinks of diagnosing\r\nit.  They shut their eyes, they sit upon the safety-valve, they give\r\nmeasures which they hope will cause relief but which cannot do so; they\r\nmerely accentuate the difficulty and emphasise the ignorance that is\r\nbehind it on both sides.  How can you cure a fever unless you diagnose\r\nthe cause or causes?  To administer a drug at random is not likely to\r\nsucceed, yet what are the Councils but a random drug?  How can they\r\nact?  No one knows what the patient suffers from; she herself least of\r\nall, I think.  No one can truly diagnose his own illness nor prescribe\r\nhis remedy.  India feels uncomfortable, and clamours for anything she\r\ncan get.  The Indian Government gives her what it can, offering\r\nprofusest condolence, which is sincere; and for the rest sitting upon\r\nher chest.\r\n\r\nBut that will avail nothing--how can it?  The fever is deep-seated, it\r\nis remittent, it affects the whole system.  It is becoming dangerous\r\nboth to the patient and her physician.  For their lots are bound\r\ntogether.  India cannot yet do without us.  She has not got the\r\norganism to govern herself yet.  She has no structure, but is an\r\ninchoate mass of people.  Did we part, India could not protect herself\r\nagainst her neighbours by sea or land.  She would be a prey to any\r\nenterprising Power.  Internally she would dissolve into anarchy.  No\r\none, I think, doubts this.  Some claim to doubt it--do they?\r\n\r\nAnd as to England, what would we be were India reft from us?\r\n\r\nFurther, there is this: you cannot hold India by force alone.  Force\r\nhas its place, but it cannot stand alone.  We conquered and have\r\ngoverned India by the consent of the people.  In fact, she conquered\r\nherself and gave herself to us.  We never had to fight peoples, except\r\nin Upper Burma, but only Governments--effete, discredited and weak.\r\nThe peoples accepted us: if not with gladness, yet they did accept.\r\nWithout that acquiescence we could have done nothing.  This must be\r\nthoroughly realised, for it is an essential truth.  Anyone can see it\r\nfor himself.  Given any superiority you like to assume of Englishman\r\nover Indian, could a handful of English officials and seventy thousand\r\nor less British troops conquer and rule three hundred-and-fifty\r\nmillions of people, living in a climate suitable to them but deadly to\r\nus, against their will?  It is impossible, incredible, absurd.  There\r\nhas been always a tacit and generally an active consent.  Now that\r\nconsent is disappearing.  Why?  And what is to be done?  It must be\r\ndiscovered.  Therefore what I propose to do in this book is: First, to\r\nshow what our rule was at first and why it was so successful.\r\n\r\nTo explain how these factors of success gradually disappeared, while at\r\nthe same time the people progressed.\r\n\r\nTo show briefly the state of things to-day--how widely Government and\r\nthe people have drifted apart, and how unsuitable Government has become.\r\n\r\nTo examine the cures proposed and indicate how useless they must be.\r\n\r\nFinally, to show how alone Government and the people can be brought\r\ninto harmony and the legitimate desires of both be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nLet us go back on history, and recount the past so that we may explain\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nSome hundreds of years ago--it varies for different places--there were\r\nin India kingdoms that were stable and strong and free.  The peoples\r\nwere enterprising, active and intelligent, and a high degree of\r\ncivilisation was common throughout all classes.  I don't think it is\r\ngenerally realised that five or six hundred years ago India was ahead\r\nof Europe in most matters.\r\n\r\nGradually all this decayed.  How and why it decayed this is not the\r\nplace to explain; there were several causes, the principal being\r\nreligion; but these systems of government all crumbled into dust.  It\r\nwas not merely dynasties or ruling classes that passed, but that the\r\nwhole fabric of its civilisation became weakened and lifeless.  The\r\norganisms that held the people together dissolved, and instead of\r\nkingdoms India became simply a mass of village communities, with no\r\norganism above that.\r\n\r\nInto this more or less anarchical country came the Moguls from the\r\nnorth, and established an empire.  This Empire was accepted for the\r\nsame reason that ours subsequently was accepted--because the people\r\nwanted first of all peace; and as peace could only be found under a\r\nstrong government, and the Mogul was the only strong power, they\r\naccepted it.  They had, moreover, no organisations to enable them to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nBut this Mogul power had no root in the soil, not in any soil.  It had\r\ncut itself away from its base, and it could not become rooted in India.\r\nIt had, therefore, never any real vitality.  The Normans in England\r\ncoalesced with the people after a time, and drew strength from them and\r\ntheir institutions, but the Mogul Empire did not.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it did to a certain extent enlist the people on its side,\r\naccept them into its organism.  There was in the early Emperors no\r\nfanaticism.  \"As tolerant as Akbar\" almost became a proverb.  Hindus\r\nand Mussulmans worked together in harmony for the benefit of the\r\nEmpire.  That is why it succeeded at all, because the line of division\r\nwas almost ignored.  Then came the fanatic Aurungzebe, who by his zeal\r\nfor religion began the destruction of the Empire, which came very\r\nquickly.  And when the ruling power was weakened and began to pass,\r\nnothing remained.  It was simply a government from above.  It had built\r\nup no system; it was the head of no organism.  When its rulers weakened\r\nthere was nothing to support them.  A king in England might be weak or\r\nbe deposed, but the nation's life went on because the organism was not\r\ndependent entirely on the head.  Its strength came from below, not\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nVery rapidly the government was dissolved in all but name, became\r\neffete, corrupt, and useless.\r\n\r\nThen came the East India Company and overthrew it, establishing a new\r\ndomination.  This again was actively or passively accepted by the\r\npeople because they wanted peace and order, which are the first wants\r\nof all humanity.\r\n\r\nThis English government was still more foreign than the Mogul\r\ndomination, but it had one great advantage, it was rooted in the soil.\r\nNot in the soil of India, of course, but in that of England.  It was a\r\nbranch of the English tree of government which had its roots deep down\r\nin English life.  Therefore it had and has a strong vitality.  It\r\nestablished over India such peace and order as had never been known.\r\n\r\nTo do this it had to establish a complete system of government, for\r\nthere was none of the old machinery left.\r\n\r\nIt did this on the English fashion.  I do not mean that it borrowed the\r\nEnglish system.  At the beginning it did try this, as the Municipality\r\nof Madras and the Permanent Settlement of Bengal show.  But so\r\nobviously was this absurd that it discontinued transplanting, and\r\nframed a system of its own.  This was, of course, adapted to the\r\ncircumstances.  Like the Mogul system it was a government from above.\r\nIt hung, as it were, suspended from the Viceroy and Council.  It had no\r\nroots in the soil in India; it was not and is not indigenous in any\r\nway.  Its vitality is derived from England, transmitted through the\r\nSecretary of State and the Viceroy.  That is the way its life-blood\r\ncirculates.  Were that artery cut, the whole system would die at once.\r\nThe connection severed, in a few months there would not be a vestige\r\nleft of the whole great fabric of the Indian Government.\r\n\r\nIf you follow the current of responsibility you will see that this is\r\nso.  The lowest official in the Indian hierarchy is the Township\r\nofficer.  He is in charge of, say, two or three hundred square miles of\r\ncountry.  To whom is he responsible--the people under him?  Not in the\r\nleast.  He is responsible to the Subdivisional officer, he to the\r\nDistrict officer, and he--either directly or through the\r\nCommissioner--to the Local Government.  The Local Governments are\r\nresponsible to the Viceroy in Council, he to the Secretary of State in\r\nEngland, the Secretary to the Prime Minister, he to Parliament, and\r\nParliament to the constituencies.  Where do the Indian people come in?\r\nNowhere.\r\n\r\nAgain, take responsibility of another kind.  Suppose India is\r\nattacked--who is responsible for its safety--India?  Not so.  It is the\r\nEnglish people, who defend it with ships, with troops, with money.\r\nIndia, for instance, has no credit in herself.  The Indian Government\r\ngets credit as a branch of the English Government, with English credit\r\nbehind it.  If the Indian peoples pay it is because England makes them\r\npay, not because by the system of government there is any\r\nresponsibility to pay.\r\n\r\nThe government of India has no existence apart from England.  It is\r\nonly 'Indian' inasmuch as it governs India, not that it proceeds from\r\nIndia or is composed of Indians.  The truth by which it lives is that\r\nit is purely English.\r\n\r\nThis is most important; it must never be forgotten.  The whole system\r\nof the government of India down to the last detail is alien, is exotic.\r\nIt could not by any possibility be rooted in India.  Neither the whole\r\nnor any part could be taken over as a going concern by any\r\nself-government India might develop.  It was created by, and is adapted\r\nto, the genius of the English in India governing from above, and to\r\nthat need only.  The reader can see that for himself, and I beg that he\r\nwill try to see it, because it is an essential truth.\r\n\r\nSuch was the principle of the English Government, one from above; and\r\nsuch were the people, a heterogeneous mass of diverse races, tongues\r\nand religions, with no organisation above that of the village.\r\n\r\nThat the people at large accepted our government as not only the best\r\navailable government, but at the time the best conceivable government,\r\nthere is no possible doubt.  Nor, as I have said, was this acceptance\r\nmerely passive.  The ease with which Sepoy regiments were raised in all\r\nparts of India shows that the people had no antipathy to our\r\ngovernment, but were glad to help it to restore and maintain order.\r\nFor these troops were for internal purposes, and not for foreign\r\nservice, which has always been most distasteful to them.\r\n\r\nBut there was more than this.  The more you study governments and\r\npeoples the more clearly you see that to ensure smooth working there\r\nmust be some relationship between them.  Some emotion or some sentiment\r\nmust unite the two, and so render their relative position endurable.\r\nLaws and restrictions are irksome; are never true; are negatives, not\r\npositives.  There must be some tie between those who impose them and\r\nthose who bear them to humanise them.\r\n\r\nNow, there are two and only two systems of government that have ever\r\nbeen even partially successful anywhere in the world--one is\r\nself-government in such an organism as will allow the people not only\r\nto enforce their will but to form a right judgment as to what they\r\nshould desire; the other is government by personality.\r\n\r\nNo complete form of either system has ever existed; the nearest to the\r\nformer were the governments of Athens, Sparta, Rome in its early days,\r\nVenice, Florence, and some other self-governing cities.  Instances of\r\nthe latter are the temporary dictatorships of Rome, the rule of\r\nAlexander, Julius Caesar, Cromwell, Napoleon for the individual form;\r\nand the feudal system in England and the Continent for the aristocratic\r\nform.  People in difficulties will trust personalities whom they admire\r\nand who have shown sympathy to them more than they will trust\r\nthemselves, conscious that the former are more capable of seeing truly\r\nand of acting efficiently.\r\n\r\nThat which makes either of these systems of government a success is an\r\nemotion, a relationship.\r\n\r\nWith a really self-governing people this relationship is the sense of\r\noneness between government and governed.  However much the people may\r\nchafe under the laws and restrictions placed upon them they can console\r\nthemselves with the idea that it is their own doing.  Government is\r\ntheir own, part of themselves, and to that representative of self they\r\ncan condone many things.  Knowing it is their own, they realise that it\r\ndoes its best for them, however hard it may seem.  They pardon because\r\nthey can understand.\r\n\r\nWith an alien rule this sentiment cannot exist, and therefore another\r\nmust take its place.  That sentiment is personal feeling between the\r\ngoverned and the individual officers of government.  Now that in India\r\nwas very strong.  For the soldiers and civilians who made India were\r\npersonalities, and all people East and West admire strong\r\npersonalities; moreover, they were sympathetic personalities who\r\nattracted confidence as well as admiration.  District officers were the\r\nfathers of their district and stood up for their people against Law and\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe first secret of our success in India was the personality of our\r\nofficers.  Other things helped--the state of the country, the\r\ndiscipline of our English troops, the ability of the Home Government to\r\nhelp; but it was the personality of our officers that gave us India.\r\nRead all their records, right from Clive and Warren Hastings to\r\nHavelock, Lawrence and Nicholson.  It was their personality that won.\r\nFor personality alone can make bad laws bearable, can make mistakes\r\nforgiven and forgotten, can lead and draw men.  And remember that it\r\nwas not only the men at the top who were personalities, but all, right\r\naway down to the lowest ranks of both services.  What personality is I\r\ndo not know, but I know that it is the magic power of the world.  It is\r\nthe positive where all else in government is negative.  I know it gave\r\nus India.  I know that with the passing of personality there is coming\r\nthe passing of the Empire.  Read this story that has been given to me:\r\n\r\n\"An old General, who had served long in India, told me recently as\r\nfollows: He still hears from time to time from his native subordinates\r\nin India.  One of them wrote recently an account of his first meeting\r\nwith the young official lately appointed to his station.  As soon as\r\nwas proper after the arrival of the official, the old Subadar went to\r\npay his respects.  He buckled on the sword which had descended to him\r\nfrom his father, took his father's medals in a packet in his hand,\r\narrayed himself in his best uniform and called.\r\n\r\n\"After long delay he was introduced into the Presence, where he beheld\r\na very untidy youth without coat or waistcoat busily writing at a\r\ntable, surrounded by papers and stout books of reference.\r\n\r\n\"The great, tall, shy man modestly approached the table and laid his\r\nfather's sword and his father's medals on it as a token of obeisance.\r\n\r\n\"After a while the scribe glanced up with angry and distracted\r\nexpression, pushed all these tributes away disdainfully, and in a\r\nbitter voice complained of interruption.\r\n\r\n\"'Sir,' said the Subadar, 'these are the medals of my father who fought\r\nfor you.  This sword has been red with the blood of my own\r\nfellow-countrymen slain by my father in defence of your Raj, but as\r\nthey do not interest you I will take them away.'\"\r\n\r\nSo he went away.\r\n\r\nBut why blame the young civilian?  He is as his teachers made him.  I\r\ndoubt not that he too once had a personality before his teachers killed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is a common shibboleth amongst English writers on India that the\r\n\"Oriental understands only personal government,\" and it is exactly the\r\nframe of mind that can invent such sayings that is the great\r\nstumbling-block to our understanding India.  For neither in this nor in\r\nany other fundamental attitude does the East differ from the West.\r\nLook at England under Gladstone.  There was again government by\r\npersonality, and the country let him do things it would allow no one\r\nelse to do.  Nowadays in England the personality has gone on both\r\nsides, as well as self-government.\r\n\r\nWe gave India government by personality, that is to say, a government\r\nwherein alien laws, alien ideas, alien methods were rendered endurable\r\nby the medium through which they reached the people.\r\n\r\nTherefore in the beginning, say from a hundred and fifty years ago till\r\nfifty years ago, the government and people were well suited to each\r\nother.  In that time neither changed very greatly.  Change there was,\r\nof course, but it was slow and slight.  Then from the middle of the\r\nlast century the rate of change was accelerated.  Now life is change,\r\nand without change you can have only death; therefore there is nothing\r\nto regret in this.  Had the change been in drawing more nearly together\r\nit would have been entirely fortunate.  But it was not so.  They were\r\nmore nearly together in the beginning than ever since, and all progress\r\nhas been away from each other.  Instead of time bringing greater\r\ncommunity of thought, greater mutual respect, and better understanding,\r\nwith every year that passed, it widened and deepened the gulf between\r\nthem.  Instead of government becoming more suited to the people, it has\r\ngrated on them more and more; instead of its efficiency increasing with\r\nthe perfection of the machine, it has become less.  In development, in\r\nintricacy, the government of to-day is to the government of a hundred\r\nyears ago as a \"Mauretania\" to a \"Great Eastern\"; but whereas of old\r\nthe wheels went easily, now they stick and try to stop; were there not\r\na strong driving power behind them they would stop.\r\n\r\nLet us see how this has occurred.\r\n\r\nYet before beginning to read this attempt to diagnose the state of the\r\ngovernment of India and the paralysis that has come over it, I would\r\nask the reader to remember this:\r\n\r\nThis book is not a mere criticism of government and its methods, nor of\r\nthe people and their defects.  I have a remedy to propose for both.  It\r\nis a remedy that I have thought over and worked at for years, and I\r\nbelieve it is the only remedy possible.\r\n\r\nBut before disclosing it I wish the reader to understand the present\r\nstate of things.  If he retains the complacency which says that \"all is\r\nfor the best in the best of all possible governments, it is the\r\npeople's fault entirely, visit it on them,\" then he will not realise\r\nthat any remedy is wanting.  Even if he do admit that something is\r\nwrong he will not know what it is, and cannot judge if that proposed be\r\nof any use.\r\n\r\nTherefore I ask him to bear with the diagnosis of the earlier chapters.\r\nHe must get to know first what the constitution of the government of\r\nIndia is, what made its strength in the past, and why that strength has\r\ndeparted from it.  Only after a true diagnosis can a true cure be\r\nsuggested.  Therefore I ask him to carefully follow the line of thought\r\nin the chapters which show in what way government now fails.  He will\r\nthen see what government should be and must be--and is not.  Only then\r\ncan he judge if the proposed remedies are likely to be successful, and\r\nperhaps he will be able to amend them or to better them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nLet us first take the people as a whole.\r\n\r\nI am aware in the first place that there are some who will object that\r\nthe Indian peoples are not a whole.  \"There is no Indian people,\" they\r\nwill say.  \"There are innumerable races, tribes, castes, diffused over\r\na continent.  They have nothing in common, neither language nor\r\nreligion, nor habits nor ideals.  You cannot talk of the people as a\r\nwhole.\"\r\n\r\nYet they have one thing in common; they have a common humanity.\r\nReligions, castes and races are but clothes.  Beneath them lies\r\nhumanity.  And humanity is always the same in essence because it is one\r\nSoul striving towards one object, though in many different ways and in\r\nvarious stages of attainment.\r\n\r\nI will show this by one instance.  It is said, for example, that the\r\ninstinctive feeling of an Oriental towards women is different from that\r\nof Europe; the West respects women, and the East does not do so.  This\r\nis proved to you by their habits, by polygamy, by polyandry, by, for\r\ninstance, the habit of a man walking in front and the woman behind.\r\nThese customs, you are told, disclose the Oriental attitude as\r\ndifferent from ours and as differing in various parts of the East.\r\n\r\nThey do not do so.\r\n\r\nThe instinctive feeling of men to women is the same everywhere; it is\r\nan invariable emotion.  Customs hide it, disguise it, and sometimes\r\nalmost kill it; they never alter it.\r\n\r\nA Burman walks in front of his wife because in the very recent past,\r\neverywhere in Burma, and in most places even now, the advance was the\r\nplace of difficulty.  There were no roads, only paths through jungle or\r\nacross the fields.  There were thorny creepers to be cut back, streams\r\nand mud puddles to be forded, cattle and buffaloes to be driven away,\r\nsnakes to be killed, and the nasty, snapping pariah dogs to be kept at\r\na distance.  No woman could or would go in front.  The man goes in\r\nfront from courtesy and carries a chopper, the woman follows with the\r\nbundle.  It is their courtesy.  If this habit continues when the\r\nnecessity has passed, that is simply because a custom once established\r\nis, East or West, hard to break.  See what Yoshio Markino says about\r\nthis same custom in Japan.\r\n\r\nPolyandry was due to restriction of the means of subsistence, limiting\r\nthe population and so necessitating the exposure of girl children;\r\noccasional polygamy--for it is always only occasional, exceptional--is\r\nan imperfection of humanity, universal East or West.  In the East they\r\ntry to make the best of it by acknowledging it; the West hides it and\r\npretends it does not exist.  That is a difference of treatment, not of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know the true instinctive feeling of men to women in the\r\nEast you will find it not in laws, customs, or religions, but in the\r\nliterature.  Read their folk-tales, their love-stories, those which\r\nwarm the hearts of boys and girls, of men and women, aye even of the\r\nold, those that rising from the heart appeal unto the heart.  Their\r\nideals are our ideals--one woman and one man; and I think sometimes\r\nthey come nearer their realisation than we do.  We pretend more, but\r\npretence is not reality.\r\n\r\nIf this be true of love, the mother of all emotions, it is true of all\r\nthe others.  Their circumstances being different they must find\r\ndifferent ways of reaching towards their ideals, but the ideals are the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nTherefore all the Indian peoples have a common humanity; and more, they\r\nhave a great many circumstances in common.  They are all, for instance,\r\nmainly agricultural; they are all in a very similar stage of\r\nevolution--the village community stage; they are all poor, they are all\r\nnatural and simple; they are all under our rule.  These are more potent\r\ninfluences than religion or race if they are allowed to have their sway.\r\n\r\nThen as to races, I do not think, for instance, that races in India are\r\nmuch more mixed than in Italy.  Think of the races there are all\r\ngrouped under the name Italian: there are Roman, Etruscan, Greek,\r\nSaracen, Norman, Goth--who shall say how many more?  And in Great\r\nBritain I cannot count them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, because in this book I am speaking of the real humanity hid\r\nbeneath the clothes, the bonds, the chains of conventions and of\r\ncustoms, of religions and belief, I can speak of the Indian peoples as\r\none people.  Details differ enormously, but details do not ever affect\r\nprinciples, only the method of their application.  And creeds, faiths,\r\nlaws, and customs pass; humanity remains.\r\n\r\nThe Indian people, then, over whom we established our government\r\naccepted it, and helped us to establish it.  They wanted peace.  For\r\ntwo centuries or more they had been torn with wars, with insurrections,\r\nwith internal anarchy, and with their consequences.  They wanted rest,\r\nto plough, to sow, to reap, to trade in peace.  We gave them that.\r\nThey wanted Courts Criminal and Civil that were not corrupt.  We gave\r\nthem honest Judges.  They wanted facilities for trade--roads, posts,\r\nand such things--which we provided.  They could expand and use some of\r\ntheir energies.\r\n\r\nBut the field was a narrow one.  Men are not born to sow and reap and\r\ntrade alone.  They have other emotions which seek for outlet, other\r\nenergies which require a vent.  Man is gregarious, and he is so made\r\nthat he cannot fully develop himself except in larger and again larger\r\ncommunities.  To reach his full stature in any way he must develop in\r\nall ways.  He must feel himself part of ever greater organisms, the\r\nvillage first, the district and the nation--finally of humanity.\r\n\r\nBut in India all this is impossible.  Except the village there is no\r\ncommunity that exists even in name, and we have injured, almost\r\ndestroyed, even that.  Thus an Indian has no means of growth.  He\r\ncannot be a citizen of anything at all.  Half his sympathies and\r\nabilities lie entirely fallow, therefore he cannot fully develop the\r\nother half.  A man is a complete organism, and if you keep half in\r\ninaction you affect the other half too.  A man is not a worse but a\r\nbetter merchant, or lawyer, or landowner, or soldier, because he is\r\ninterested in his locality, his community, his nation.  It gives him\r\nwider views, makes him more tolerant, more humane, more wise.  Man as a\r\nunit is a poor thing, physically, morally, and intellectually.  Ability\r\nis the product of communities, of men formed into organisms, not of\r\nindividuals.  Each man in himself has no duty but to himself; to own a\r\nduty to a community he must be part of the community; to a government\r\nhe must have a place in the government; to a nation he must be part of\r\nthe nation.  But in India there is no nation, no community at all, save\r\nvery weakened village communities.  As far as the Indian is concerned\r\nno larger community exists.  And I have already pointed out that India\r\nhas no place in the organism of government.\r\n\r\nIt is the slowly growing consciousness of an energy that has no outlet,\r\nof a desire for advance in every direction, that causes the unrest.  In\r\nsome ways the educated classes feel it most.  Elsewhere they see men of\r\ntheir class cultivating their patriotism, increasing that sense of\r\nbeing and working for others, of being valuable to the world at large,\r\nshowing capacity for leading, ruling, thinking, advancing in a thousand\r\nways, while none of it is for them.  They want to express the genius of\r\ntheir races in wider forms than mere individuality, but they are not\r\nable to do so.  They want a national science and literature and law;\r\nthey cannot have it.  No individual as an individual can achieve\r\nanything.  Not till he feels he is a cell in a greater and more\r\nenduring life can he develop.  But this is not for India.\r\n\r\nIt is a piece of advice often addressed to India when she expresses her\r\ndesire for some share in her government that she should first reform\r\nherself socially and intellectually.  The status of women in zenanas\r\nand harems, infant marriage, the sad condition of widows, the\r\ndegradation of caste, polygamy, the fanaticism of religions, are, she\r\nis told, to be mended before she can show herself fit for\r\nself-government in any form.  Only to a free people can self-government\r\nbe safely entrusted, and she is so wrapped up in prejudice and\r\nignorance that she is unfit for any freedom.  \"Mend your divisions\r\nfirst; reform yourself, and we will see what we can do.\"\r\n\r\nSuch advice comes from ignorance alone.  It is but another instance of\r\nthat Phariseeism that has become so common with us.  It is impossible\r\nfor individuals to reform themselves, however much they may wish to do\r\nso.  For an individual to reform, his whole environment must be\r\nreformed as well.  For example, take widow remarriage.  How can widows\r\nremarry in comfort till the whole structure of Hindu convention is\r\nchanged?  Not one individual nor a million individuals can break a\r\nconvention.  There is a strong feeling, as we know, amongst Hindus\r\nagainst this and many other conventions that stifle them, but every\r\neffort to break these chains has failed.  Why?  Because to break\r\nfetters bound upon society by religion or convention takes the combined\r\neffort of society, and even then it is difficult.  The inertia of\r\npeoples is a deadly difficulty to overcome.\r\n\r\nBut we have not allowed the collective instinct any opportunity of\r\ndeveloping.  There are no nuclei; there is nothing to draw the people\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nTake again the differences created by races, religions, castes.  It is\r\nthe interest of the priests to maintain these differences and\r\nexaggerate them.  Religions never reform themselves.  What influence is\r\nthere to soften them?  None that I ever heard of.\r\n\r\nBut self-governing institutions do tend to remove them.  In the village\r\ncommunal life they are to a considerable extent ignored.  The organism\r\nof the village, when healthy and free, forces men to disregard\r\nartificial barriers of this sort and meet on common ground for common\r\nbusiness.  Solidarity comes from the sense of the necessity for\r\nsolidarity in order to get on.  Its possibility is soon manifest.\r\n\r\nBut where in India is there any influence tending towards this end?\r\nThe barriers of caste increase and grow, as naturally they must do.\r\nThere is no _rapprochement_ between Hindu and Mohammedan, but on the\r\ncontrary the gulf is widened.  It must be so.  And if Government makes\r\nthe fatal error of adopting the motto \"_Divide et impera_,\" if it in\r\never so slight a fashion identifies itself with one caste, race, or\r\nreligion above another, then it is near the end of all things.  But to\r\nthe development of self-government the effacement of these divisions\r\nwould be necessary, and in the pursuit of an eagerly coveted ideal they\r\ncould pass and disappear.  No other influence can do it.  Again history\r\nshows this clearly.  It was this influence in England that rendered\r\nCatholic emancipation possible and had brought creeds politically\r\ntogether.  Did we in England live still under an aristocracy as we did\r\na hundred years ago the divisions between Catholic and Protestant,\r\nChurchman and Dissenter, Christian and Agnostic, would still be as\r\nsharp as they were.  These artificial barriers of creed and race give\r\nway only under the pressure of a stream of national life.  That is\r\nbeginning already to flow in India; be ours the task to help it flow in\r\ntrue and widening channels so that it may become a great river,\r\nfertilising all things.  Now the main idea seems to be to dam it up,\r\nand so cause it to flood and to destroy.\r\n\r\nI hope that what I say will not be misunderstood.  I do not for a\r\nmoment mean that political organisms should or could be used for social\r\nreform.  That is quite impossible.  Any such attempt would wreck the\r\norganism, which, as an organism, must pursue only its legitimate ends.\r\n\r\nBut I say, and all history is at one with me, that suitable free\r\ninstitutions do cultivate and bring out the faculty for freedom, and\r\ndemonstrate that in all matters it is necessary.\r\n\r\nAgain, consider this: the laws concerning marriage, divorce, adoption,\r\nand inheritance, whether of Mohammedan, Hindu, or Buddhist, are\r\npetrified.  With changing circumstances, changes in these laws become\r\nof the first necessity; yet as things are now no change is possible.\r\nTake the ten million Buddhists in Burma.  Their laws of marriage are\r\ncontained in the Dhammathats, which are derived from the laws of Menu,\r\nand are I don't know how old.  Now there is this that is good about\r\nthem: they were codified when India was free, before the night of\r\nreligious bigotry descended upon it.  They are, therefore, based not\r\nupon religious ideas, but upon custom which was based on experience.\r\nThe spirit therefore is excellent, it is common-sense; it is not the\r\npretension of an ideal long before the ideal is universally possible,\r\nbut a common-sense recognition of human nature as it is, and the\r\nnecessity of doing your best with it.  They are the only marriage laws\r\nin the world framed by common sense and not religion.  Men and women\r\nare free and equal.  But although their base is excellent they were\r\nframed for a very different environment from what obtains now.  And\r\nagain, there are two or more codes, and they differ in details.  There\r\nis nothing the people want more than a rectification and consolidation\r\nof their laws, with registration of marriage, the power to make wills,\r\nand other matters.  They are always expressing this necessity because\r\nthe present laws of inheritance handicap them against other races.\r\nThey cannot make wills, and the law of inheritance is so vague that\r\nwhen a rich man dies litigation almost always ensues.  The estate is\r\ndissipated in law-costs and the heirs ruined.\r\n\r\nBut who is going to draft the new laws?  Not Government.  Once bit\r\ntwice shy, and the Government of Madras had a try at that in Malabar.\r\nThere was urgent necessity there for some system of marriage\r\nregistration, so Government appointed a Commission which recorded\r\nquantities of evidence, and framed a Report, on which an Act was\r\npassed.  It was supposed to be absolutely according to the wishes of\r\nthe people.  I have not been in Malabar since the Act was passed, but\r\none friend has told me that three marriages were registered under it.\r\nAnother friend told me that this is a wild exaggeration, and that only\r\none marriage was registered under it, just that the people might say\r\nthey had not rejected the Act without trying it.  However this may be,\r\nthe Act is a dead letter.  It was bound to fail.  The people find the\r\nlaws of Government already too stringent, interfering too much, and too\r\ninhuman, even where they deal with matters outside the home.  They will\r\nnever allow an alien Government a footing inside the house.  They know\r\nGovernment has destroyed the village; they fear it will destroy the\r\nfamily.  Therefore Government holds its hand.  It cannot do otherwise.\r\nFor even if it could frame an Act in accordance with the wishes of the\r\npeople, that Act could not be enforced.  And it cannot discover the\r\nwishes of the people, because the people themselves don't know.  The\r\nopinion of no matter how many individuals is no true guide.  Because,\r\nto justify a new Act of inheritance, not individual opinion but joint\r\nopinion must be known.  They are not the same.  Ten men as individuals\r\nwill tell you one thing; these ten men as a community would tell you a\r\ndifferent thing.  This is a fact in psychology I shall have to refer to\r\nagain later.  It is undoubted.\r\n\r\nNow the joint opinion of Burmese society as to the proposed change\r\ncannot be gauged, because it does not exist.  There are no Burmese\r\ncommunities to evolve any common idea.  Therefore the archaic laws must\r\nremain as they are.\r\n\r\nThus throughout India all progress of all sorts is barred; can you\r\nwonder that there is unrest from this one cause alone?\r\n\r\nAnd this feeling goes down to the very lowest ranks as an unnameable,\r\nunanalysable fever and unhappiness; you see it everywhere.\r\n\r\nThen there is more than this.  A system of government and law that was\r\nbearable when we were weak is unbearable when stronger.  What gives you\r\nhelp when young becomes a fetter as you grow.  It bites into the flesh\r\nlike cords too tightly drawn, and in India instead of being loosed they\r\nhave been drawn more tightly year by year.\r\n\r\nIt is not only that the people have grown bigger, but the bonds of\r\ngovernment have grown narrower.  It has grown more of a machine, less\r\nhuman than it was, less human year by year, until sometimes now it is\r\nalmost inhuman in its rigid formalism.  The bonds cut into her flesh;\r\nIndia wants to grow, to rise--but cannot.  How could it be but that she\r\nshould show unrest?\r\n\r\nIndia wants to get on; we bar the way, so India feels unrest.\r\n\r\nNow if you will consider this unrest you will admit that it is not a\r\nbad symptom but a good one; it is a sign of an increasing life.\r\nNeither is it uncomplimentary to us that it should have arisen.  It is\r\nthe greatest compliment our rule could have.  A hundred and fifty years\r\nago--even, perhaps, fifty years ago--India could not have felt this.\r\nShe was exhausted, weary, wanting peace.  We gave her peace, and so she\r\nhas grown strong and overcome her weariness.  That is our doing.  No\r\none else could have done that.  We gave her a complete rest cure.  We\r\nsaid, \"Keep still, and eat and drink; we will do all the thinking--the\r\nruling that has to be done.  Do not be afraid, for we can do it well.\r\nHave confidence.  Get back your nerves and strength.  We will look\r\nafter you.\"\r\n\r\nWe did.  How well we did it history tells.  We did not spare ourselves.\r\nI do not say we acted from any altruistic motives.  I do not say we\r\nhave not made mistakes.  But we did it.  The task was great; the\r\ngreatest, perhaps, the world has seen.\r\n\r\nIndia is rested, and she wakes, she moves.  Why are we angry?  Should\r\nwe not feel proud?\r\n\r\nCan we not give her a hand, and say, \"Rise up and try to walk.  I will\r\nhold your hand at first, till you are stronger.  Then when you are\r\ngrown you shall walk free, beside me, as my daughter whom I have\r\nbrought up\"?\r\n\r\nI see continual denunciations of the unrest in India.  Why?  I see\r\ncontinual regrets that the past is passed--but why?  Continual threats\r\nare breathed towards India.  Why?\r\n\r\nFor myself, I hail it as the happiest omen that could be.  It has\r\nunfortunate exhibitions sometimes; that is partly our fault, I fear,\r\nbecause we do not recognise that the past is gone for ever.  India has\r\ngrown, and we forget.  We give no outlet to these true energies that\r\nhave developed.  India was our patient; now she is recovering shall we\r\nmake of her a subject, or a daughter?  She must be one or other, or\r\nleave us altogether, for the past is passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CIVILIAN\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the Government and its ideas; that is to say, the\r\nmen and the laws by which they govern.\r\n\r\nFirst, take the _personnel_, for there is no complaint more insistent\r\non all sides than that the officers of to-day are not the same as those\r\nof fifty or more years ago.  They are out of touch with the people.\r\n\r\nIt was for some time supposed by Government that this was only\r\npartially true.  That government itself, that is, the Secretariats, was\r\nout of touch, was felt and avowed.  But it was supposed that this arose\r\nfrom the specialising of function.  The work of secretaries had become\r\nso difficult, so special, so different from district work, that instead\r\nof there being interchange of officers, the secretaries usually passed\r\nall their official lives away from actual contact with the realities of\r\nthe people.  There were orders passed that in future this was not to\r\noccur, men were to come and go, to do district work for a while, and\r\nthen secretariat work, bringing to the latter knowledge gained in the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nBut it was quickly seen that this had little or no result.  If the\r\nsecretaries were out of touch, the district officers were hardly less\r\nso.  Government, as a whole, had separated from the people.  English\r\nand Indian were divided; nothing was gained.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the difference between the men of the past and those of\r\nthe present?  Let us consider.\r\n\r\nThey went out younger in those days; sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen,\r\nwere the usual ages.  The usual age for Haileybury cadets was twenty.\r\nClive, Warren Hastings, Nicholson and John Lawrence went out at\r\neighteen, Henry Lawrence at seventeen, Meadows Taylor at fifteen.  Many\r\nof the administrators were soldiers first, and they too went out young.\r\nLord Roberts, for instance, landed in India when he was sixteen.\r\nAddiscombe cadets joined at sixteen or seventeen.  When Haileybury was\r\nabolished the average age was raised to twenty-three or more, and at\r\nthat age it now remains.\r\n\r\nThus, as the first year in India is also spent in training out there, a\r\nman is now not far from twenty-five before he is allowed to act\r\nindependently; he used to be twenty-one or less.  This is a great\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nIn England the age when a boy attains his majority and has full freedom\r\nbefore the law is twenty-one, and in order to elucidate this question I\r\nhave tried to discover why the law of England fixed twenty-one.  In\r\nRome a boy was legally of age as regards his person at fourteen though\r\nhe had a curator over his property till he was twenty-five.  Therefore\r\nthis age of twenty-one does not come from Roman law.  It seems to have\r\narisen from a general consensus of observation that at twenty-one the\r\naverage young man is fit to be free and should be free.  There seems to\r\nbe about that age a critical mental stage of adolescence corresponding\r\nto the physical stage at fourteen.  However this may be, there seems to\r\nbe no doubt that to keep a young man in tutelage till he is twenty-four\r\nor twenty-five is bad for him.  The powers of initiative and the sense\r\nof responsibility which mature at twenty-one atrophy thereafter if not\r\nfully used.  And no book learning can replace this.  Thus nowadays\r\ntutelage is too long continued.\r\n\r\nAgain, education began later in those days than now, and there was less\r\nof it.  Boys ran wild far more than now, when they are cramped up in\r\nschools and conventions at a very early age.\r\n\r\nThus the men of old had individualities; they had not been\r\nsteam-rollered flat by public school and university; their boyish\r\nenthusiasm and friendliness were still in them.  They had no\r\nprejudices, had never heard of the Oriental mind, were not convinced\r\nbeforehand that every Oriental was a liar and a thief, but were\r\nprepared to take men as they found them.  They were willing and eager\r\nto learn.  Their minds were open as yet to new impressions.  They had\r\nnot been \"fortified by fixed principles\" to \"safeguard them\" against\r\nacquiring any sympathy with Eastern peoples.  Therefore they did so\r\nunderstand and sympathise.\r\n\r\nIf you will read the records of the past you will see this in a most\r\nmarked degree.  Englishmen had Indian friends; how rarely do they have\r\nsuch now!  They knew the people's talk, their folk-lore and their\r\ntales.  They looked on them as fellow-humans.  And the feeling was\r\nreciprocated.  Look, for instance, at how they kept the same servants\r\nall their service.  Nowadays there is a general howl of the badness of\r\nIndian servants and their untrustworthiness.  It was not so then.  One\r\nof the most pleasing features of that old life was the affection often\r\nshown between masters and servants.  Dickens has noted it.  How much of\r\nthat do you find now?  Not much.  A little still there is--who should\r\nknow better than I?  And if now it is so rare, where is the fault?\r\nGood masters make good servants.  And it requires so little goodness in\r\nthe master--only a little consideration, a friendly word sometimes.\r\nThey give back far more than they receive.  If there are many bad\r\nservants, who makes them bad?  Their masters; those with whom they\r\nbegan their service, who did not know how to treat them, how to help\r\nthem, how to keep them.  At Arcot the Sepoys gave the rice to their\r\nofficers and took the conjee themselves; how many regiments would do\r\nthat now?\r\n\r\nI do not say that there was ever close personal intercourse between\r\nEnglish and Indian; there was not, and in the nature of things there\r\ncould not be.  But there were mutual consideration and mutual respect.\r\n\"We have different ways and different customs; we have different skins.\r\nBut underneath it all we are both men.\"  So they thought in the old\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThus in the old days the embryo official came out young, free from\r\nprejudices, full of enthusiasms, ready to learn, to read, to mark,\r\nlearn, and inwardly digest all phases of Oriental life about him.  Even\r\nthirty years ago when I first went to India there were many of this\r\ntype still left.  They thought it their duty, as it was their pleasure,\r\nto study the people in order to understand what lay beneath their\r\ncustoms.  It must be thirty years ago that an old civilian turned on me\r\nsharply when I made some ignorant remark about some Malabar custom and\r\nsaid: \"The custom has arisen out of the circumstances of life and no\r\npeculiarity of nature in the people.  All peoples are much alike in\r\nfundamentals, and great apparent differences are but superficial, and\r\narise from environment.\"\r\n\r\nThe absurd doctrine of the \"Oriental mind\" had not then arisen to be an\r\nexcuse for ignorance and want of understanding.  Nowadays it is\r\nsupposed to be the mark of culture to talk of it; to the old officials\r\nit would have been the mark of a fool; they thought it their duty to\r\nstudy the people.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so now.  Young civilians come out with their minds\r\nalready closed, and, as a rule, closed they remain.  The harm is done\r\nin England before they start.  Let me give instances.\r\n\r\nIt is a custom when a young civilian joins to send him to a district\r\nhead-quarters for six months first, to learn his way about before\r\nposting him to any specified work.  One such was sent to me ten years\r\nago, and if I give an account of him it will do for all.  For nowadays\r\nthey are all turned out of the same mill, have all the same habits of\r\nmind and thought, and their personalities are submerged.  If anything,\r\nhe of whom I speak was above the average in all ways.\r\n\r\nHe was a very nice young fellow, with charming manners, and I greatly\r\nliked him.\r\n\r\nHe became an officer of great promise, and would have risen high, but\r\nhe is dead now, and therefore what I say now cannot offend anyone.\r\nBesides, I have nothing to say that would offend.  He was, I think,\r\ntwenty-three years of age, of good people, educated at a public school\r\nand Oxford, and was as nice a boy as could be found.  He had passed\r\nhigh in the examinations.  He was said to be clever, and as regards\r\nassimilating paper knowledge, he was able, but his mind was an old\r\ncuriosity shop.  He had fixed ideas in nearly everything.  He was full\r\nof prejudices he called principles, of \"facts\" that were not true.  He\r\nhad learnt a great deal, he knew nothing; and worse--he did not know\r\nhow to obtain knowledge.  He wanted his opinions ready-made and\r\nabsolute first, and only sought for such facts as would support those\r\nprinciples.  He had no notion how to make knowledge by himself.  He\r\nwanted authority before he would think.  Give him \"authority,\" and he\r\nwould disregard or deny fact in order to cling to it.  I will take a\r\nconcrete instance.\r\n\r\nThere is amongst Englishmen in Burma a superstition that the Burmese do\r\nnot and cannot work.  They are \"lazy.\"  The men never work if they can\r\nhelp it, and all the work that is done is done by women.  How this idea\r\narose is an interesting study in the psychology of ignorance, but I\r\nneed not enter into that now.  The idea obtains universally, and is an\r\nacknowledged shibboleth.  My young assistant was not with me many days\r\nbefore he brought it up.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"the Burman is so lazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure of that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe stared at me.  \"Why, everyone says so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone said four hundred years ago that the sun went round the\r\nearth,\" I answered; \"were they right?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to tell me,\" he said, \"that the Burmese can work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to tell you anything,\" I answered.  \"Here are a quarter\r\nof a million Burmese in this district.  Find out the facts for\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessity of having to support his theories with facts seemed to\r\nhim unreasonable.  \"But,\" he objected, \"I can see they are lazy.\"  The\r\nBurman is lazy.  That is enough said.  What have facts to do with it?\r\nHe did not say this, but undoubtedly he was thinking it.  However, at\r\nlast he did find what he considered a fact.\r\n\r\n\"You remember, when we rode into that village the other day about noon,\r\nthe number of men we saw sleeping in the veranda?\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Does not that show it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" I said, \"you had got up at four o'clock in the morning and\r\nworked till ten, in the fields, would you not require a rest before\r\ngoing out at three o'clock again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they do that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You can find out for yourself if they do or not,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he objected, \"it is notorious.\"\r\n\r\n\"So is the fact that the standard of living in Burma is very high.  How\r\ndo you reconcile the two?  Laziness and comfort.  The comfort is\r\nevident and real, perhaps the laziness is only apparent.\"\r\n\r\n\"A rich country,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" I asked.  \"Look at the dry, bare land, of which nearly all\r\nthis district and most of Upper Burma are composed.  Is it rich?  You\r\nhave eyes to see.  You know it is not rich; why do you say it is?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head almost as if I had hurt him and searched about for a\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\"But Lower Burma is rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; and if you look at the export returns you will see the\r\nenormous amount of rice it grows and exports.  Is that rice the product\r\nof laziness?\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he said at last in despair, \"if this laziness of the Burman is\r\nuntrue, how did the idea become general?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" I answered, \"that is another matter.  Let us stick to one thing\r\nat a time.  We are concerned now with whether it is true or not.\r\nDecide that first.  See for yourself.  Find out an ordinary man's work\r\nand I think you will find it is sufficient.  You have the opportunity\r\nof judging, and unless you use that opportunity you have no right to an\r\nopinion at all.\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more at the time, but a few days later he returned to the\r\nsubject.  A High Official had been opening a public work in Mandalay\r\nand had made a speech.  Much of the labour for the work had been\r\nBurmese, where usually such labour is imported Indian, and he referred\r\nwith satisfaction to the fact.  \"I am glad to see,\" said the High\r\nOfficial, \"that the Burmese are taking to hard work.\"  My assistant\r\nbrought this up.  \"Here is authority,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I said; \"there is authority on one side; now let us look\r\nat fact on the other; whether is it better to be a peasant-proprietor\r\non your own land or a day-labourer?\"\r\n\r\n\"The proprietor, of course,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"This has been a bad year in some districts.  Crops have failed.  You\r\ncan read that from the weekly reports in my office.  Many cultivators\r\nhave had to abandon their holdings and turn to day labour.  Is that\r\ngood?  Are they to be congratulated on it?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy looked downcast.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" I asked, \"what will they think of a Government who says\r\nsuch things?\"\r\n\r\nHe reflected for some time.  \"But,\" he said at length, \"when one\r\nauthority (the High Official) says one thing and another authority\r\n(you) says the reverse, what am I to believe?\"\r\n\r\nThen came my opportunity.  \"You are to believe nothing,\" I said.  \"You\r\nhave eyes, you have ears, you have common sense.  They are given you to\r\nuse and see facts for yourself.  The facts are all round you.  You will\r\nnever do any good work if you refuse to face facts and understand them.\r\nIf you are to be worth your salt as an official you will have to work\r\nby sight, not by faith.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed.  At first he seemed puzzled; then he was pleased.  He had\r\nbeen educated to accept what he was told and never to question.  His\r\nmind had been stunted and the idea of exercising it again delighted\r\nhim.  To judge by himself was a new idea to him entirely and he\r\nwelcomed it.  He began to do so.  For the first time since childhood he\r\nwas encouraged to use that which is the only thing worth\r\ncultivating--his common sense.  But even yet he could not emancipate\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSome time later a new subject came up.  This time it was the\r\ndisappearance of the Burman.  He is supposed to be dying out.  The\r\nIndian is \"ousting\" him.  Before long there will be none left.  My\r\nassistant had read it in the paper and heard it almost universally,\r\ntherefore it must be true.  I said nothing at the time, but that day\r\nwhen I went to office I sent him the volumes of the last two Census\r\ntables with a short note.  \"Will you kindly,\" I wrote, \"make out for me:\r\n\r\n  the Burmese population in 1891\r\n  the same in 1901\r\n\r\ndistrict by district, and let me know where there have been decreases,\r\nalso increases, and the percentage of increase.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day he came to me with an amused expression on his face and a\r\npaper of figures in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I have made them all out,\" he said, \"as you wished.  Here they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" I said, \"let us take the districts with the decreases first.\r\nPlease show me them.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are none,\" he answered.  \"They all show increases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Large?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, large,\" he said; \"from a population of about nine million to ten\r\nmillion in ten years is a good increase.  The Burmese are prolific.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I remarked also, \"I thought the Burman was disappearing?  You\r\nsaid so on authority.  How is that?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed; he had taken his lesson.\r\n\r\nAnd again, another point.  I had received an order from Government\r\nwhich I thought was mistaken, and I said so.  He was a Government\r\nofficial too, and I could say to him what I could not say to others.\r\n\r\n\"Then you won't carry it out?\"  he asked, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"I am here to carry out orders,\" I answered, \"and of course I shall\r\ncarry it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why then do you criticise it, if it must be carried out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" I said, \"before very long you will be sent to a\r\nsubdivision of my district to govern it.  I shall send you many orders,\r\nand shall expect you to carry them out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right or wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right or--as you may think--wrong.  You must do as I say.  Without\r\nthis, government is impossible.  But I do not want you to think as I\r\ndo.  I want you to think for yourself.  If an order appears to you\r\nissued from a misconception on my part, you must not refuse to obey;\r\nbut I should expect you to tell me any facts that would lead me to\r\nbetter knowledge.  Your business is not merely to carry out orders, but\r\nto furnish me with correct information how to better those orders.  You\r\nare not merely to be part of the district hand, but of its brain too.\r\nI should want you to criticise every order in your mind, try to\r\nunderstand it, and if you disagree with it to examine your reasons for\r\ndisagreement and see if they are good.\"\r\n\r\n\"And let you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whenever you are certain that I am wrong, and the matter is important.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would not criticism be cheek?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if it is true and valuable.  You would be doing me a valuable\r\nservice.  It is what I want.  How do you suppose we are ever to get on\r\nif opinions are to be stereotyped?  Thought must be free.  But don't\r\ngive me opinions or 'authority.'  I don't care for either.  Give me\r\nfacts, and be sure of your facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You can be quite kind about it, you know,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Is that what you are to Government,\" he asked, \"when you disagree with\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"I try to be,\" I said.  \"I put myself as far as I can in their\r\nposition, and give them what I would like to receive myself.\"\r\n\r\nAgain it was quite a new idea to him that anyone should want criticism.\r\nHe had been educated to believe that any doubt of what authority said\r\nwas a sin, perhaps inevitable sometimes, but anyhow always to be\r\nconcealed; and he had been told that everyone, from the Creator down,\r\nresented criticisms and would annihilate the critic.  That anyone\r\nshould prefer knowing the truth even if it prove him wrong seemed to\r\nhim impossible.  He did not like ever to admit he had been wrong.  He\r\nthought truth was absolute and fixed, whereas it is relative and always\r\ngrowing.  He had, unconsciously, the mind of the Pharisee in the Temple.\r\n\r\nNow these three instances will point out what seems to me to be wrong\r\nin the previous training of young men sent to India, and in fact in all\r\ntraining.  Their minds instead of being cultivated are stifled.  They\r\nare taught to disregard fact and to accept authority in place of it.\r\nThey are not only to do what they are told, which is right; but to\r\nthink what they are told, which is wrong.  And they do.  They are\r\ntaught to repeat in parrot manner stock phrases and imagine they are\r\nthinking.  And this habit once acquired is difficult to get rid of.\r\nWith most it never is got rid of.  You will, for instance, find these\r\nshibboleths of the \"disappearing Burman\" and his \"laziness\" repeated by\r\nthe highest officials who have been longest in the country, all of whom\r\nhave facts in their office disproving them.  And these are not the only\r\nprejudices nor even the principal.  They are innumerable and serious.\r\nYou will in consequence find that administration and even legislation\r\nare affected by them.  The whole attitude of Government to the people\r\nit governs is vitiated in this way.  There is a want of knowledge and\r\nunderstanding.  In place of it are fixed opinions based usually on\r\nprejudice or on faulty observation, or on circumstances which have\r\nchanged, and they are never corrected.  Young secretaries read up back\r\ncirculars, and repeat their errors indefinitely.  That is \"following\r\nprecedent.\"  They will quote you complacently:\r\n\r\n  \"Freedom broadening slowly down\r\n  From precedent to precedent\"\r\n\r\nand never see the absurdity of the lines.  Freedom is the disregard of\r\nprecedent where the precedent is wrong or out of date.\r\n\r\nThere is throughout nearly all English officials (and non-officials) in\r\nIndia not only a disregard of facts about them, but a want of any real\r\nsympathy with the people among whom they live, which is astonishing.\r\nThey often like the \"natives,\" they often are kind to them, wish them\r\nwell, and do their best for them, but that is not sympathy.  Sympathy\r\nis understanding.  It is being able to put yourself in another's place.\r\n\r\nI could tell many stories illustrating this want of understanding.  One\r\nwill suffice.  An official I knew well, an excellent fellow,\r\nkind-hearted, humorous, and able, holding a good position then and a\r\nhigh one now, with a charming wife, living amongst the Burmese and\r\nruling them, with Burmese servants, clerks, and peons, and continual\r\nBurmese visitors of all classes, called his dog \"Alaung.\"  Now \"Alaung\"\r\nmeans something very similar to \"Messiah,\" and is a sacred word.  A\r\nparallel would be if, say, a Parsee in England called his dog \"Christ.\"\r\nI have seen this official's servants wince when he called out to his\r\ndog.  Yet I am sure it never struck him that there was anything out of\r\nthe way in this nomenclature.  I am sure he never dreamed he would hurt\r\nanyone's feelings by it, or he would not have done it.  He certainly\r\nintended no jeer at the religion of his subordinates.  It was simply\r\nthat he wanted understanding.\r\n\r\nNow sympathy is inherent in all children, and is the means whereby they\r\nacquire all the real knowledge they have.  A girl being a mother to her\r\ndoll, a boy being a soldier or hunter, is exercising and training the\r\nmost valuable of all gifts--imaginative sympathy.  It is the only\r\nemotion which brings real knowledge of the world about you.  Without it\r\nyou never understand anything.\r\n\r\nIt should be incessantly cultivated and fed with real facts to enable\r\nit to grow, and to turn what your sympathy leads you to suspect into\r\nwhat knowledge confirms.  In all young men nowadays it is destroyed by\r\ntheir education.  Their minds are fitted up with obsolete and mistaken\r\nprejudices, which are called principles, and then the door is locked.\r\nThey all talk the same, act the same, have the same ideas in their\r\nheads.  None of them ever think over what is all about them.  They do\r\ntheir work by paper knowledge and paper principles; the great book of\r\nhumanity has been sealed for them.  When they try to think they cannot\r\ndo so.  They have lost the power their childhood had.  They argue in\r\nthe most extraordinary way.  They will make a statement, and if it is\r\ndisproved say, \"Well, if it is not true it ought to be,\" and go on as\r\nif that made it true.  They will resort to prophecy, and say, \"If not\r\ntrue to-day it will be to-morrow,\" and so settle it.\r\n\r\nNow if brighter days are to be in store for India official or\r\nnon-official, English or native, all this must be altered.  The whole\r\nprinciples of education must be revised or abandoned.  The less\r\neducated a man is now the more real understanding he is likely to have.\r\nThe educated man is a mental automaton.  He has sold his soul and got\r\nin its place some maxims, with the aid of which he seeks to govern the\r\nworld.  He thinks knowledge is got from books.  It is not.  Books are\r\nmost valuable helps, showing you new views of life, giving you new\r\nfacts, showing you how to think; but they never give you knowledge of\r\nlife.  Only experience can do that.  But the young man now does not\r\nwant to know what is, but what other people say.  He is afraid of\r\nhimself and yearns for authority.\r\n\r\nThis has been evident to all who have looked into the matter.  Here is\r\nwhat a modern writer says:\r\n\r\n\"No English schoolboy is ever taught to speak the truth for the very\r\nsimple reason that he is never taught to desire the truth.  From the\r\nvery first he is taught to be totally careless as to whether a fact is\r\na fact; he is taught to care only whether the 'fact' can be used on his\r\nside when he is engaged in 'playing the game.'\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more true than this.  He is provided with fixed ideas,\r\nand he will welcome any fact that supports them, while deliberately\r\nrefusing all facts which are opposed to his ideas.  He thinks and\r\nargues to prove his preconceived point, never to elicit truth\r\nregardless of whether that truth agrees with his preconceptions or not.\r\nIn fact, he is taught not to think.  The Inward Light which is in all\r\nchildren has been put out.  He has become a spiritual coward; he dare\r\nnot look the whole truth in the face.  He thinks that patriotism\r\nconsists in supporting his country or his class through thick and thin.\r\nIt does not occur to him that the higher patriotism is to try to help\r\nhis country or his class not to go wrong, or if wrong to get right.  He\r\nwould rather bolster up a mistake, shut his eyes to the fact that it is\r\na mistake, and go on doing it, than admit his wrong.  It is better in\r\nhis eyes to be consistently wrong than by admitting mistakes and\r\ncorrecting them to be inconsistent.  He cannot learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHIS SUBSEQUENT TRAINING\r\n\r\nTherefore there is a wide difference between the men as they came out\r\nin the old days and as they come out now.  Then they were young, not\r\nvery well instructed but capable of seeing, understanding, and\r\nlearning; nowadays they are so drilled and instructed that they can\r\ndeal only with books, papers, and records; life has been closed to\r\nthem; they can enforce laws, but not temper them.\r\n\r\nAfter they come out the difference of life and work is still greater.\r\nIn the old days, for instance, they picked up the language quickly and\r\nwell.  The time to learn a language is when you are young--the younger\r\nthe better.  We learn our own language as children.  The older we grow\r\nthe harder it is, because it means not merely learning by heart a great\r\nmany words, not merely training the palate and tongue to produce\r\ndifferent sounds, but adopting a new attitude of mind.  Nothing\r\ndefinite has been discovered as to the localisation of faculties in the\r\nbrain, therefore nothing certain is known; but it has always seemed to\r\nme and to others whom I have consulted that when you learn a new\r\nlanguage you are exercising and developing a new piece of brain.  When\r\nyou know several languages and change from one to another you seem\r\ndefinitely to change the piece of brain which actuates your tongue.\r\nYou switch off one centre and switch on to another.  You will always\r\nnotice in yourself and others that there is a definite pause when the\r\nchange of language is made.  Now it becomes every year more difficult\r\nto awaken an unused part of the brain and bring it into active use, and\r\nto begin at twenty-three is late.  True, languages are taught them at\r\nOxford before they come out, but the result seems _nil_.  You must\r\nlearn a language where it is spoken.  Moreover, the way they have been\r\ntaught Latin and Greek is a hindrance, for living languages are not\r\nlearnt that way.  A child, for instance, learns to talk perfectly\r\nwithout ever learning grammar.  I never heard that any great English\r\nwriter had a grounding in English grammar.  There is no real grammar of\r\na living language, because it grows and changes.  You can only have a\r\nfixed grammar of a dead language.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that correct talking is the outcome of correct thinking,\r\nnot of any mechanical rules.  You must think in a language before you\r\ncan speak it well.\r\n\r\nBut at twenty-three it is far too late for the ordinary man to learn to\r\nthink in Hindustani or Burmese or Tamil.  Of course there are\r\noccasional exceptions, but the way these languages are usually spoken\r\nis dreadful.  I could tell tales about myself as well as others, for\r\nthough I worked very hard for years I never knew Burmese well, nor yet\r\nCanarese, nor yet Hindustani.  Yet who will doubt that it is very\r\nimportant, the most important acquisition, in fact, that you can make?\r\nWithout it you can never really get near the people.  So that in this\r\nway the old civilian had again a great advantage.\r\n\r\nHere is one story.  Once upon a time there was a District Officer and\r\nthere was his district, and for some reason they did not seem to agree.\r\nAt least the district did not like its Head.  It felt uneasy, and it\r\nbecame restive, and at last it complained.  It took up many grievances,\r\nand amongst them was this: \"There is a good deal of building wanted in\r\nvarious parts, and there is timber and there are sawyers, but no\r\nlicences can be obtained.  When the Head comes round on tour we ask\r\nhim, but he always refuses.  So all building work is stopped.\"\r\n\r\nAn Inspecting Officer went to inquire, and he began with this\r\ncomplaint: \"Why do you refuse them sawpit licences when on tour?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" the Head replied.\r\n\r\n\"They say you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they never even applied; so how could I refuse?\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Inspecting Officer, \"let's see the file of your\r\npetitions received.\"\r\n\r\nA clerk brought it out, and there--written in Burmese, of course--were\r\nmany sawpit applications, and below each, written by the Head, was his\r\nendorsement:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot allow more guns to be issued.\"\r\n\r\nThen the machine of government was far less perfected than it is now.\r\nThere were, of course, laws and rules and there was supervision, but to\r\nnothing like the present extent.  The district officer then had a\r\npersonality.  He was required to have one, for local conditions\r\ndiffered more than they do now and he had far more latitude.  Moreover,\r\nthe machine being less effective he depended a great deal upon his\r\npersonal influence to keep the place quiet and get things done.  He\r\ncould not ask for orders because there was no telegraph, and he could\r\nnot get help quickly because there were no railways.  Therefore he was\r\nobliged to acquire a personal knowledge of people and peoples, of\r\nindividuals and castes and races, which, he thinks, is not so necessary\r\nnow.  The result was that all laws and orders passed through his\r\npersonality before reaching the people, thus acquiring a humanity and\r\nreasonableness that is now impossible.  He studied his district and he\r\nused his powers, legal and otherwise, as he found best.  If he found a\r\nlaw harsh--and in the last resort all laws are so--he would ameliorate\r\nits action.  Nowadays he cannot do that.  In the old days he\r\nadministered, as best he could, justice; now he administers law--a very\r\nwide difference.  Thus he was forced by circumstances to acquire a\r\nknowledge and a sympathy which are unattainable to-day; for you only\r\nlearn things by doing them.\r\n\r\nThe old district officers were known personally by name and by\r\nreputation all through their districts.  The people looked to them for\r\nhelp and understanding, and protection as much against the rigidity and\r\ninjustice of the laws as against other ills.\r\n\r\nBut nowadays, except the Government officials and headmen, I don't\r\nbelieve anyone in a district knows who the head is.  At all events, it\r\nmakes practically no difference, because the application of the laws is\r\nsupervised and enforced, and the district officer must \"fall into\r\nline.\"  If any personality has survived his schooling it must now be\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nFew men, I think, learn anything except from two motives--a natural\r\ndriving desire or necessity.  But a natural desire to study the people\r\nround you is scarce, and the necessity of other days has passed away.\r\nA district officer can now do his work quite to the satisfaction of\r\nGovernment and know next to nothing of the people.  In fact, sometimes\r\nknowledge leads to remonstrance with Government, and it doesn't like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAgain, there has crept into secretariats a cult of \"energy\" and\r\n\"efficiency,\" and a definition of these words, which acts disastrously\r\nupon the district officer, both when he is under training and\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nNow, the proper meaning of an \"efficient officer\" is, I take it, one\r\nwho sees the right thing to do and does it quickly and effectively; and\r\nprobably Government really has this in its mind when it uses the word.\r\nThis is what it wants; but very often what it gets is almost the\r\nopposite, and it is as pleased with this as if it got what it expected.\r\nIn fact, it does not seem to know the difference.  An example will\r\nexplain what I mean.\r\n\r\nThere is, we will say, in a district a good deal of cattle theft going\r\non, and the thieves cannot be detected.  Cattle graze in Burma in the\r\nfields, and in the jungle on their outskirts; they roam about a good\r\ndeal, and it is easy enough to steal them; detection is difficult.\r\n\r\nBut there is in Burma, as in parts of India, a provision of the Village\r\nRegulation which is called the Track Law, and it is substantially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf cattle are missing their tracks can be followed.  When they pass out\r\nof the area under the jurisdiction of the village wherein the owner\r\nlives and enter another village lands, that village becomes\r\nresponsible.  The tracker calls the headman of that village and shows\r\nhim the tracks, which he must follow up and demonstrate that they have\r\nnot stopped in his jurisdiction but gone on.  In this way the tracks\r\ncan be followed till they are lost, when the village in whose land they\r\nare lost is considered as being the village of the thief, and is\r\ntherefore responsible for the lost cattle.  It can be fined, and the\r\nowner of the lost bullock indemnified.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Act is taken from a very old custom common once in most of India,\r\nand also, I believe, in places of Europe.  For several hundred years\r\nago, when villages were widely separated by jungle, it had some sense.\r\n\r\nThere was then a presumption either that the stolen bullock had been\r\ntaken to that village, or that some of the villagers had seen it pass.\r\nThe thief would probably have stopped there for food or rest, as it was\r\na long way on.  But nowadays, in most of the country, village fields\r\nare conterminous, with little or no jungle between; there are many\r\nroads, and except where the tracks actually go into the village gate\r\nthe presumption does not arise.  Cattle are common, and the villagers\r\nare not expert trackers.  Moreover, there is a very strong premium on\r\ndishonesty, or at least carelessness in keeping to the right tracks.\r\nSuppose the right track lost in a wet place, or a dry bare place, why\r\nnot pick up some other?  Most cattle tracks are very similar.  The\r\nowner wants his compensation.\r\n\r\nYet the \"energetic\" officer will be expected to work this Act _à pied\r\nde la lettre_.\r\n\r\nI saw a good deal of the actual working of this Act at one time, when I\r\nwas a subordinate officer.  Every time a beast was lost it had to be\r\ntracked, and the village where the tracks were lost had to pay.  It\r\nmade no difference if there was any reasonable presumption against the\r\nvillage, there the law was.  The tracks might be lost two miles from\r\nthe actual village, simply crossing its boundary; the law was there.\r\n\r\nI remember one village had a bad time because it was near a frequented\r\nroad, and when the tracks got on this road they were always lost, as\r\nthe surface was hard.  So the village had to pay.  Yet what evidence\r\nwas there against the village?  None.  I had the curiosity for some\r\ntime, whenever a case wherein a village was fined was subsequently\r\ndetected, to find out what village had been fined, and see if that\r\nvillage had been in any way cognisant of the theft.  It never had.  The\r\nfine was purely gratuitous, was worse than useless, for it was wrong.\r\n\r\nYet it is a Government rule--not, I think, actually laid down, but\r\nunderstood--that whenever an offence occurs, unless the culprit is\r\narrested a village must be held responsible.\r\n\r\nI always disliked the Track Law and its subsidiary sections, not\r\nbecause I have any objection to holding a village, in certain cases,\r\nresponsible for its members--I think it is a sound principle--but\r\nbecause it always hit innocent people, as far as I could see.  I used\r\nit as little as I could, yet there were difficulties.  I will mention a\r\ncase in point.\r\n\r\nThere was a broker who lived not in my district but near its boundary,\r\nand one day he rode to a village in my district to collect some debts.\r\nHe didn't collect them, and left the village in a rage, saying he would\r\ncomplain to the police-station six or seven miles away that he had been\r\ncheated.  It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when he left, and\r\nhe rode off across the plain in the direction of the police-station.\r\n\r\nHe was sighted at dusk near the river, going along a road which half a\r\nmile farther on passed through a village, and no more was seen of him.\r\nHe never arrived at the police-station, and next morning his pony was\r\nfound roaming the plain about the village near which he had last been\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of him or his body.\r\n\r\nHe was a well-known man, reputed to be wealthy, and a great fuss was\r\nmade.  His wife declared he must have been murdered.  The magistrate of\r\nthe broker's district was indignant that \"his\" broker should have been\r\nmurdered in my district and I do nothing.  My police could get no clue\r\nat all, nor could I.  A subordinate magistrate held a proceeding under\r\nthe Track Law against the village where the broker disappeared, and\r\nrecommended it be fined.  I, however, held my hand.\r\n\r\nThen a body was found floating in the river some miles lower down, and\r\nidentified as the broker's body, and his wife gave it a funeral.  Still\r\nI held my hand.\r\n\r\nMy neighbour was indignant; my Superintendent of Police was distressed\r\nat me; my Commissioner evidently thought me slack--\"no energy.\"  The\r\nfact is I was puzzled, and would do nothing till I saw clearly.  So six\r\nmonths went on.\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened eventually had nothing more come out I can't\r\nsay, but something more did come out--the broker came out.  He was\r\nrecognised in Mandalay and immediately arrested--for pretending to be\r\nalive when he was really dead, I suppose--and sent to me.  I asked him\r\nwhat had occurred, and he confessed that he was deeply in debt to\r\nmoney-lenders and had made up this scheme to defeat them.  He had left\r\nhis pony, gone down to the river, crossed in a canoe, and gone into\r\nhiding.  While he was \"dead\" his wife had compounded with his creditors.\r\n\r\nI sent him back to my neighbour with the emphatic warning that if his\r\nbroker ever came up my way again he would certainly be done for in good\r\nearnest.  The whole district had been turned upside down for him, and\r\nhe was not popular.\r\n\r\nNow the points that I wish all this to illustrate are these: Men at the\r\nhead-quarters of Government, out of touch with real life, read the\r\nTrack Law, think it most useful and just, and insist on its being\r\nenforced.  Officers on the spot, accustomed to accept all law as the\r\nepitome of justice, follow the Act without thinking.  The\r\nresponsibility is really on them, as Government tells them to judge\r\neach case on its merits, but they fear that if they reported that no\r\ncase under the Track Law ever had any merits they would be written down\r\nas \"wanting in energy.\"  As they have not been trained to think for\r\nthemselves, they do not do so.  They fulfil all the requirements of the\r\nAct, and are satisfied.  Moreover, subsequently, to justify their own\r\naction they must praise the Act.  Therefore a vicious circle is\r\ncreated.  Government says: \"District officers praise the Act, therefore\r\nhave it stringently enforced, for they know its actual value.\"  And\r\ndistrict officers say: \"Government declares this to be an admirable\r\nAct, therefore I must enforce it.\"  No one ever investigates the facts.\r\nIf a district officer have doubts, he discreetly smothers them as\r\nbabies, lest they grow.\r\n\r\nAnd this is but one instance.  I mention in a later chapter a still\r\nmore striking case of this sort of action; and even many examples would\r\nnot expose its whole evil.  It is the spirit that renders such things\r\npossible that is disastrous.  So are officers trained to believe that\r\nwhen anything untoward happens they must do something--they must punish\r\nsomebody.  The idea that if they act without full knowledge the\r\nsomething they do will be wrong and the persons they punish will be\r\ninnocent is not allowed to intrude.  They will, of course, always act\r\nby law, but then, \"_summum jus, summa injuria_.\"  In the old days this\r\ncould not have happened.  In the first place, Government trusted its\r\nofficers, and its trust was not misplaced; now it trusts its laws; yet\r\nthere is nothing so unintelligent, nothing so fatal as rigid\r\nlaws--except those who believe in them.  In the second place, officers\r\nwith the personality and knowledge of the men of former days would have\r\ninsisted on seeing for themselves and judging for themselves.  They\r\nwould have cared nothing that they might be supposed not to have\r\n\"energy.\"  They would know they had something better than that--they\r\nhad understanding.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of making our laws and our government generally\r\nendurable to the people depends on the personality of the district\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nNowadays he is sent out with his personality crushed, and it gets still\r\nmore crushed out there.  He becomes in time not a living soul but a\r\nmotor-engine to drive a machine.  Whatever knowledge he acquires is of\r\nthe people's faults and not their virtues.  When you hear an official\r\npraised as \"knowing the Indian\" or \"the Burman,\" you know that it means\r\nthat he knows his faults.  He knows the criminal trying to escape, the\r\nvillager trying to evade revenue.  It doesn't mean that he knows more\r\nthan this.  Some do, especially among the police and the forest\r\nofficers, but then they have no influence.\r\n\r\nAs showing the difference between the old officer and the new I make\r\nthe following extract from _A City of Sunshine_, by Alexander\r\nAllardyce.  Few books on the East have been written with a clearer\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Eversley, the collector, was an official of a type that has almost\r\npassed away.  He had been brought up in the strictest traditions of the\r\nHaileybury school and had adhered all his life to the conservative\r\nprinciples of the 'old civilianism.'  When the 'Competition Wallah'\r\ncame in, Eversley foresaw certain ruin to the English interests in\r\nIndia.  'Competition Wallahs!' he used to exclaim--'as well put the\r\ncountry under a commission of schoolmasters at once.  But we'll lose\r\nthe country with all this Latin and Greek; take my word for it we'll\r\nsoon lose the country.'  Mr. Eversley had never been able to make a\r\nhexameter in the whole course of his life, and there is grave reason to\r\ndoubt that he was ignorant of even the barest elements of the Greek\r\naccidence.  But he had acquired a marvellous colloquial familiarity\r\nwith the Eastern vernaculars, and he knew the habits and feelings of\r\nthe Bengalee better than any other officer in the Lower Provinces.\r\nThere was no chance of Eversley falling into such a blunder as that\r\nwhich was laid to the charge of Muffington Prigge, the magistrate of\r\nthe neighbouring district of Lallkor, who once, in taking the\r\ndeposition of a witness in a criminal case, had expressed his\r\ndispleasure that evidence of such importance should be given on the\r\nauthority of a third person, and ordered the police to bring 'Fidwi'\r\nbefore him.  The witness gave his evidence in the third person out of\r\nrespect.  Instead of saying 'I saw' he said 'Fidwi (your slave) saw.'\r\nMuffington Prigge's judgments had been more than once spoken of with\r\nencomiums by Mr. Justice Tremer in the Appeal side of the High Court,\r\nbut Mr. Eversley's law never came before the High Court except to be\r\nreprobated.  Lawyers complained that he did not know even the rudiments\r\nof the Codes; but there was no magistrate in the Lower Provinces whose\r\ndecisions were received with more general satisfaction or from whose\r\njudgments there were fewer appeals.  His rough-and-ready way of\r\nsettling cases was better relished than the elaborate findings of the\r\nLallkor archon which were generally unintelligible to the suitors till\r\nthey had fee'd their lawyer to tell them which side had won.\r\n\r\n\"The people knew that Eversley would do what he saw to be right,\r\nindependent of Act or Code, _and they had more confidence in his sense\r\nof justice than in the written law_.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the highest praise a Burman will give to an officer--that he is\r\nclever, painstaking, honest, energetic, kind?  No; but that he has\r\n\"auza.\"  And what is \"auza\"?  It is that influence and power that comes\r\nfrom personality.  Who has \"auza\" nowadays?  No one, not even\r\nGovernment.  It has become, as Eversley expected, a Commission of\r\nSchoolmasters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCRIMINAL LAW\r\n\r\nLet us turn now from the _personnel_ of government to its methods, from\r\nits men to its laws, from the motive power to the machine it works, or\r\nwhich more often now works government.\r\n\r\nThe first subject that comes naturally to our view is the prevention\r\nand suppression of crime, for in point of time that precedes all else.\r\nWhen you are conquering a country, after the soldiers have partly done\r\ntheir work and the civil power comes in, its first care is to create\r\nand maintain peace.  It organises a police and appoints magistrates.\r\nThus in point of time the Criminal Courts are the first to be organised\r\nand criminal law to be laid down, and they are the foundation-stone on\r\nwhich all else is built.  And they remain always the most important of\r\nthe functions of government.  If they work well, then there is a good\r\nbeginning made, but if ill, then the outlook is bad.  If what should be\r\nCourts of Justice cease in the opinion of the people to be so, then is\r\nthe very foundation-stone of your rule dissolving.  The whole edifice\r\nis undermined; it is not founded on a rock, but on something that\r\ndecays, which soon will give way and let down everything.\r\n\r\nLet us go back therefore to the beginning, and see how things worked\r\nthen.  The laws were few, were crude, were often bad.  It must be\r\nremembered that a hundred years ago the penal laws in England were the\r\nmost savage, the most useless, the most wicked the world has ever seen.\r\nThe law in India could not therefore be expected to be very good.  But\r\nprevious to our rule there was no law at all generally.  And these bad\r\nlaws of ours came to the people through the medium of personalities who\r\nwere for the most part intelligent and sympathetic.  Moreover, there\r\nwas nothing like the number of cases then as now.  The system now\r\nobliges all cognisable crime to be reported even if petty in its\r\nnature.  In those days very little crime was reported, it was dealt\r\nwith by the village communities and never known to the Courts.  There\r\nwere few pleaders; and a trial was really what it ought to be, an\r\ninquiry into facts by a magistrate desiring to know them.  The question\r\nof personality came in a great deal, and whatever may be alleged of the\r\nordinary district courts of those days, they were human, they really\r\ntried to be Courts of Justice, they tried to understand.  The people\r\nrespected them.  If they did not respect the law, at all events they\r\nrespected the magistrate who tried to do his best with it.  They had an\r\nadmiration for his personality which went a long way.\r\n\r\nNow that is all changed.\r\n\r\nThe law has been greatly improved.  It has been codified by trained\r\nlegists; Lord Macaulay and Sir James Stephen were two of them, and it\r\nis up to the standard of European codes.  But, on the other hand, it\r\nhas been made absolute.  There is a reign of law now, and there is no\r\nperson in the world who does not hate law when he sees it.  The\r\npersonality that softened it in the old days has been ruled out.  The\r\nHigh Courts supervise all work and reduce it to a dead level of\r\nuniformity.  There is even a fixed scale of punishment sometimes.  On\r\nrevision, cases are rejudged on the written evidence alone.  Of course,\r\nthe case cannot be altered on revision, but the magistrate can be\r\nadmonished--and he is.  All humanity is eliminated.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Courts are despised and hated by the people, who misuse\r\nthem in every way they can.\r\n\r\nLet us look into this matter.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let me explode a common fallacy.  It is frequently\r\nsaid that Oriental people do not dislike crime, that they condone it,\r\nthat they have low standards in matters of current morality.  Therefore\r\nthey are not anxious to have crime brought to justice as we are.  They\r\nare a bad lot, and the criminal being but a trifle worse than the\r\naverage they sympathise with him.\r\n\r\nAll that is wicked nonsense.  Standards in the East are the same as\r\nthey are elsewhere.  The people dislike crime as much as we do.  But\r\nthey think our laws and Courts are not calculated to reduce crime, and\r\nthey have good reason for so thinking.  Moreover, they distinguish\r\nbetween the sinner and his sin--we don't.  There lies the difference.\r\nLet us consider, therefore, the Courts and their relation to the people.\r\n\r\nI confine myself to the province of Burma which I know best, but there\r\nis little difference between it and other provinces in these matters.\r\nThe law is uniform, the procedure uniform, and what differences exist\r\nare due to interference of the High Courts acting within the law.  In\r\nthe Indian Penal Code are laid down definitions of the various\r\noffences; what it is that constitutes theft, or robbery, or murder.  It\r\nwas drawn out by skilled and able men from the experience of all\r\ncivilised nations.  It is not, of course, perfect; no code could be\r\nthat or near it, but it is good.  With most of it the people have no\r\nquarrel.  A theft is the same anywhere, and so is a murder.  With one\r\npoint, however, they profoundly disagree, and that is the\r\nclassification of offences.  Theft, no matter how trivial, is an\r\noffence against the State, is not compoundable, and is cognisable by\r\nthe police; whereas an assault, no matter how severe, unless it causes\r\ngrievous hurt, is the opposite.  It is a purely private matter, with\r\nwhich the police have no business.  If the sufferer wants to prosecute\r\nhe must do so himself; pay his own expenses and engage his own pleader,\r\nor go without.  This is a difference that offends his own instinct.\r\nJust take two cases.\r\n\r\nYour servant steals a little silver ornament, a few rupees you left\r\nabout; or some hungry loafer takes some fruit off your tree.  You may\r\nnot forgive him, you may not overlook it.  You are bound by law to tell\r\nthe police and get the offender arrested and convicted.  By the petty\r\ntheft public morality has been outraged, and you must assist morality\r\nto vindicate itself.  You have no option.  If you do not tell the\r\npolice, you are \"compounding a felony,\" and may be punished.  Having\r\ntold the police you will have no further trouble.  They will get up the\r\ncase, look up evidence, summon the witnesses, prosecute the case, and\r\nyou will be paid for giving evidence.  The thief will be sent to gaol.\r\nBut if your enemy meets you in the fields, knocks you down, rolls you\r\nin the dust, dishonours and abases you in your own esteem and before\r\nall who know of it, public morality is not offended.  It is of no use\r\ngoing to the police-station; they will not listen to you, they will not\r\nprosecute, nor take any notice.  If you desire justice you must go\r\nyourself to Court, pay to have a petition written, pay for a stamp, get\r\nan advocate and pay him, pay for summonses to witnesses, spend, say,\r\nthree or four pounds, and eventually your enemy may be fined five\r\nshillings, of which you, if lucky, may get two as compensation.  You\r\nmay, if you like, at any time withdraw your complaint, if, for\r\ninstance, your enemy apologises to you or compensates you.  Now these\r\nare not selected cases, exaggerated cases, nor unusual cases.  They are\r\ncommon, and in both cases the instincts of the people are outraged.\r\nThey are not sordid-minded.  A petty theft is not to them a very\r\nserious thing.  They put a higher value on their personal dignity and\r\nself-respect than on a trifling piece of property.  To them, therefore,\r\nall this is wrong.  Theft is never a very deadly offence, and if of\r\nsmall things is easily forgiven.  _But they may not forgive_.  If the\r\npolice hear of it, they must give evidence against the culprit--or must\r\nlie.  They lie.  Who blames them?  The concealment of thefts, the\r\nrefusal to report them to the police, the subsequent refusal to give\r\nevidence, are common.  Is theirs the fault?  On the other hand, as it\r\nis impossible in the Courts to get any satisfaction for an assault, the\r\nhot-tempered Burman seeks revenge in other ways.  The Court fails him,\r\nso he takes the law into his own hands.  He will waylay, will stab,\r\nwill sometimes murder.  Then Government grieves over the large number\r\nof serious-hurt cases and wonders what causes them.  The wily Madrassi\r\nor Bengali coolie gets square in a different way.  The injured\r\ncomplainant goes off straight to the police-station and there describes\r\nthe assault more or less correctly.  This, of course, he knows will not\r\nhelp him, so he adds as follows: \"During the assault a rupee dropped\r\nout of my pocket, and when A had finished battering me he picked up the\r\nrupee and went off with it.\"  This makes the offence \"theft,\" which is\r\ncognisable by the police, who go off and arrest B and lock him up.  Of\r\ncourse, at the trial the experienced magistrate detects the truth,\r\nfirmly disbelieves the rupee, and convicts A of an assault only.  But B\r\nis quite satisfied.  Has not A been locked up for a week?\r\n\r\nThe perspective therefore of the Indian Penal Code is wrong.  It is\r\ntaken from English law, which is also wrong, that is, opposed to common\r\nsense.  How it arose I know, but this is not the place to enter into\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nTherefore the very definition and classification of offences are\r\nrepugnant to the people, and are themselves causes of evasion: the\r\nIndian Penal Code itself is wrong.  But that is nothing to the\r\nwrong-headedness of the Criminal Procedure Code.\r\n\r\nFor whereas the Penal Code only partly offends the people, the Court\r\nprocedure is wrong from top to bottom.  Its very foundation principle\r\nis wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat is its principle of a trial?  Is it a means of finding out the\r\ntruth?  Is it an impartial inquiry into what has happened?  Not in the\r\nleast.  A trial is a duel.  It is the lineal descendant of the duels of\r\nthe Middle Ages.  The place is changed, it is a Court and not a field;\r\nweapons are witnesses and tongues, not swords nor spears; the parties\r\nfight by champions, not in person, and the umpire is called a judge,\r\nbut the principle is the same.  Take any criminal trial.  On one side\r\nis the Crown prosecutor, on the other the advocate of the accused.\r\nThey fight.  All through the case they fight.  The prosecutor calls his\r\nwitnesses, asks them only the questions the answers to which will help\r\nhis case.  The other champion cross-examines, bullies, confuses them,\r\ntries to make them contradict themselves, drags in irrelevant matter,\r\nand tries to destroy what the other side has built.  When the defence\r\nis on, the state of affairs is reversed.  Neither wants the truth, and\r\nonly the truth, and all the truth.  Each plays to win, and that alone.\r\nIf either knows evidence which would help the other side he suppresses\r\nit.  The judge is almost helpless.  He has to take what is given.  He\r\nsees _lacunae_ in the evidence, he cannot fill them.  He can't get down\r\nfrom off the bench and go out into the country finding evidence for\r\nhimself.  He knows that every witness brought before him has been\r\ntutored--not directly perhaps, but indirectly by suggestion, by\r\nquestion, by influence.  The case is cooked before it reaches him, and\r\ntherefore hopeless.  He knows he never finds out the exact truth about\r\nany single thing.  How should he?  He knows and sees that witnesses are\r\nlying.  He knows the reason, because it is a duel, and they are, on one\r\nside or another, fighting for vengeance, fighting for liberty.  He\r\nknows that though they are a singularly truthful people outside, yet\r\ninside, their consciences absolve them from the necessity of truth\r\nbecause the Court is so constituted as not to be a place for an inquiry\r\ninto truth, but the arena of a duel.\r\n\r\nHe sees cases bought and sold.  A clever barrister or advocate will\r\nsecure an acquittal where a cheaper man would fail.  That is notorious\r\neverywhere.  Otherwise how do great barristers come by their big fees?\r\nClients do not pay for nothing.  A barrister is worthy of his hire.\r\nThe poor man loses and the rich man wins.  The poor man goes to gaol,\r\nthe rich is acquitted or gets a light sentence.  So it happens\r\neverywhere.  The exact truth of a case is never known.  For twenty\r\nyears I was a magistrate and judge.  I tried hundreds of cases and I\r\ndid my best with each.  But I never once reached my own standard of\r\nunderstanding.  What is that standard?  Not that of Courts of Appeal\r\nwho generally upheld my cases.  My standard was this: Do I know enough\r\nof the case to write a story embodying it if I wanted to?  I never did.\r\nFor the standard of truth that goes to even the slightest story is very\r\nfar beyond what is required or possible in even the most carefully\r\nheard case.\r\n\r\nNow this is not an edifying state of things.  It is not edifying\r\nanywhere, and I have often heard remarks about it in England from men\r\nwho happened into a court of law to hear a case.  To judges, lawyers,\r\nand barristers this view of the proceedings does not occur, because\r\nthey have been brought up to it, and therefore their minds are locked\r\nas far as really appreciating it goes.  In India and Burma it is even\r\nless edifying.  I have often heard Burmans talk of it.  \"Here on one\r\nside are the police, trained men, with all the power and resource of a\r\ngreat Government behind them, trying to get a conviction.  They have\r\ngone about the country, searched out evidence, tested it, summoned it,\r\nand displayed it to its best effect in Court.  On the other side is a\r\npoor devil of a villager who has been locked up while the police were\r\nfree; who is poor, who is ignorant, who if he can afford a pleader at\r\nall can only afford a very indifferent one.  His case is not presented\r\nat all, or is very badly presented.  True, the case has to be clearly\r\nproved or he is acquitted, but the same facts may wear very different\r\ncolours, according to whether the whole truth is known or only a half.\r\nThe magistrate does his best, but he can only act on the evidence.  The\r\npolice want a conviction because otherwise their records are bad and\r\npromotion is stopped.  Do you wonder that sympathy is often with the\r\naccused?\"\r\n\r\nSo I have often been asked; and I don't wonder.  I often felt that way\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nWhen a man first falls into an offence his immediate instinct is to\r\nconfess to somebody.  That is true of all the world.  In Burma at the\r\nbeginning he used to confess to the Court.  He was sorry for his\r\noffence, he wanted to make the best of it, wanted help to reform.  He\r\nwanted understanding.  He thought the Court wanted to know the truth\r\nand he would do all he could to help.  But he very soon found the\r\nuselessness of this.  He got no understanding, no sympathy, only\r\nconviction and a vindictive punishment.  Naturally he reflected, and\r\npleaders and people who knew the Courts helped him to reflect.\r\n\r\n\"Fight it out.  At worst you can but lose and be no worse off than if\r\nyou confessed.  Why tell the truth?  _No one expects you to_.  If you\r\nhave confessed withdraw your confession.  Say you were tortured.  A\r\ntrial is a fight, with the judge as umpire.  Do your best.  Remember\r\nthat, even if your offence be a very small one, if it is a cognisable\r\noffence you will be ruined for life if convicted.\"  That is the advice\r\nhe gets.  Who will doubt but that, our Courts being what they are, it\r\nis sound as a rule?  So, because it is a fight he won't confess; he\r\nplays for the big stake--acquittal; and sometimes this acts\r\ndisastrously too.  I will tell a case in point--one I tried myself.\r\n\r\nA man was accused of maiming a bullock.  It had trespassed into his\r\nIndian-corn field, and had been found there afterwards hamstrung, and\r\nhad to be destroyed.  It was proved that accused was in the field when\r\nthe bullock wandered in.  It was also proved that accused's chopper was\r\nfound close to the maimed bullock, covered with blood.  Accused had run\r\naway and had only been arrested some days later.\r\n\r\nNow the malicious maiming of a valuable bullock is a serious offence.\r\nIts seriousness partly depends on the value of the animal.  The case\r\nwas quite clearly proved though no one actually saw the offence\r\ncommitted.  The defence of the accused was a futile _alibi_.  He had a\r\npleader who arranged this.  The evidence for the prosecution seemed\r\nquite clear, and I did not see how I could avoid convicting the man of\r\nthe grave offence.  Yet somehow I was not quite happy in my mind.  I\r\nbelieved the prosecution was substantially true, but that they had been\r\npiling it on a good deal.  So before adjourning the case till next day\r\nto give me time to write the judgment, I said to the accused:\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe your _alibi_.  You can see for yourself it has no\r\nsense.  But maybe if you told me your side of the story it might not\r\nlook so bad for you as it does now.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me, hesitated, looked at his pleader, then all of a sudden\r\nhe did bring the whole story out.\r\n\r\nAnd as he told it, though it did not in any way invalidate the evidence\r\nfor the prosecution, it did put the matter in quite a new light.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the cattle, of which the bullock was one, had been\r\nwilfully driven into his field to annoy him and cause him loss.  In the\r\nsecond place, he had not deliberately cut the bullock; when he saw the\r\ncattle coming through the six-foot-high corn towards him he had in a\r\npassion thrown his chopper at the dimly seen moving mass of cattle.\r\nThen he had dodged out of their way.  When he found afterwards what\r\ndamage he had done he ran away in a fright.\r\n\r\nI found there was evidence to support what he said--for instance, he\r\nhad gone straight home and told his father before he ran away--so he\r\ngot off with a small fine.  He might have got two years.  But unless he\r\nhad confessed I could never have guessed that there was quite another\r\nversion of the facts.\r\n\r\nNow I have often suspected this state of affairs.  The substance of the\r\nprosecution is clear, but there might be extenuating circumstances.\r\nThe accused however fights it to the last and will admit nothing.  On\r\nthe evidence I could but take a gloomy view; for, remember, all cases\r\nare subject to revision by the High Court, who simply read through the\r\nwritten evidence and are not able to appreciate the subtle effect of\r\ntone and manner in witnesses, which tell more sometimes than their\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nI have said that the people have no respect for the Courts because they\r\nhave lost all respect for the magistrate or judge.  In himself he may\r\nbe worthy of all confidence; but when on the bench he is not himself,\r\nhe is a mouthpiece of the law, or an umpire; he is not a living force.\r\nWhen you lie in Court you do not deceive a human being who is doing his\r\nbest for you and others; you only try to counterbalance the injustice\r\nof the law by a little judicious weighting of the scales.  A man who\r\nwill tell you the truth as individual to individual will commit perjury\r\nbefore you in Courts and think nothing of it.  In fact, he lies at the\r\nother side, and doesn't consider you at all.  He does it to try to get\r\njustice, or what he thinks is justice, in place of law, which otherwise\r\nis all he would get.  I have often been told this, and I notice the\r\nsame in England.  Truth is a relationship of persons; in a Court now\r\nthe only persons are the two opponents; the judge is only a sort of\r\nmachine to weigh evidence.  As man to man I have found Orientals as\r\ntruthful as Englishmen.  In twenty-six years' experience I do not\r\nremember ever having been told a deliberate lie as man to man.  But in\r\nthe Courts you are not a man, you are an official, and even as an\r\nofficial your hands are tied.  The parties have no direct relationship\r\nwith you.  Their relationship is with each other--just as in a duel or\r\na prize-fight the relationship is between party and party, and the\r\numpire is only the onlooker, who may or may not see most of the game.\r\nIn law he usually sees less because Justice is blind.  I am aware that\r\nthe bandage over the eyes of Justice is supposed to render her just,\r\nnot discriminating between rich and poor; it does the reverse, of\r\ncourse.  And until Justice opens her eyes again to discriminate what is\r\nput into her scales she will remain the mock she now is.\r\n\r\nIn a previous book I have discussed the question of veracity in this\r\nconnection, and lest anyone should object that what I say is true only\r\nof the Burmese I will add this story, which is of a well-known official\r\nin the North-West in his younger days.\r\n\r\nHe was inquiring into a Revenue case, and incidentally an Indian\r\ngentleman gave him certain information.  The official thought this so\r\nimportant that he summoned the Indian to Court, where, much to the\r\nEnglishman's surprise, the Indian as a witness gave a totally different\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThey met again, however, later, and the official asked the Indian\r\ngentleman what he meant by going back on his words like that.  The\r\nlatter smiled, hesitated, and then the wisdom of experience spoke to\r\nthe altruism of ignorance in these words: \"Sahib,\" he said, \"you are\r\nvery young.\"\r\n\r\nHow the Courts are generally regarded by the people can best be\r\nillustrated by giving an account of a dramatic entertainment I\r\nwitnessed once.  The Burmese are fond of the drama.  They have old\r\ndramas, and they have new dramas up to date--satires for the most part.\r\nThe play I saw was of the latter.  The company was a well-known one,\r\nwhich had toured almost all the province, and its most famous piece was\r\nthat I witnessed--I forget the name.\r\n\r\nThe scene was supposed to be the office of a lawyer, barrister, or\r\nadvocate, and there was a native clerk.  To him entered a would-be\r\nlitigant.  The clerk listens to him for a few minutes and then asks him\r\nif he has brought any money.  The client says \"No.\"  The clerk rises in\r\nindignation and the client is hustled out.\r\n\r\nHe returns with a bag of money.  The clerk then listens and the client\r\nexplains his case.  The clerk demands if there is any evidence.  The\r\nclient is puzzled and asks what evidence is required.  The clerk then\r\ntells him slowly and distinctly: you must have a man to swear to this,\r\nanother to swear to that, a third to swear to something else.\r\n\r\nThe client remonstrates, saying he doubts if he can get so much\r\nevidence.  The clerk then tells him that if he cannot get the evidence\r\ndemanded his master will not take up his case.  \"But,\" says the client\r\nindignantly, \"it is a true case.\"  \"What does that matter?\" asks the\r\nclerk cynically.  \"No Court cares--or can tell if it did care--whether\r\nyour case is true or not.  It can only tell if you have evidence or\r\nnot.  If you can't get the evidence your case may be the truest in the\r\nworld, but that won't help you.\"\r\n\r\nThe client then wants his money back, but the clerk clings to the bag\r\nand the client is again thrown out.  The play was a long one, and I can\r\nonly give a résumé of parts of it.  The client goes looking for\r\nwitnesses in the village.  He gets hold of one man and says: \"Come and\r\ngive evidence.\"  \"But I saw nothing,\" says the villager.  \"And,\" says\r\nthe client indignantly, \"would you let me, an old friend, lose what you\r\nknow is a right cause just because you didn't happen to see a trifle\r\nlike that?  What does it matter if you didn't actually see it?  It did\r\nhappen.  I am not asking you to tell a lie or invent anything.\"\r\n\r\nSo he gets his witnesses and takes them to the clerk.  The clerk takes\r\ndown their statements.  The last scene is in Court, and the client's\r\nadvocate appears to plead for him.  He does so with a tongue two feet\r\nin length.  But still he loses his case, for the advocate on the other\r\nside has a tongue three feet long.  That this play was the success it\r\nproved to be shows clearly that the audience saw nothing unnatural in\r\nit.  In fact, they relished it immensely.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate was a stuffed figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPENAL LAW\r\n\r\nThere is a further difference in their view of crime, between\r\nEnglishmen as they are made by education and Orientals who in some ways\r\nremain the natural man, which greatly affects the Courts, that is the\r\npunishment due for crime.\r\n\r\nIn England we have had the most cruel penal laws ever known.  It is not\r\na hundred years ago that there were two hundred and twenty-three\r\ndifferent offences for which the capital punishment was awarded.  I\r\nwonder if people nowadays ever realise their horrors.  I have an\r\naccount of how a poor little servant girl convicted of having stolen\r\nsome few clothes was dragged out half-dead with fear to a gibbet\r\nwithout the village and there slowly done to death before a crowd of\r\npeople.  It was no unusual thing, for theft of over five shillings was\r\npunishable with death.  The record of our Courts in England is the most\r\nbrutal and most bloody in history.  They have been reformed but very\r\npartially.  There is still amongst Englishmen a vindictiveness towards\r\nthe criminal that is unknown elsewhere.  Despite frequent denunciation\r\nof the uselessness and the wickedness of vindictive punishment, the\r\nidea continually recurs.  It is not merely excused--it is even counted\r\nas righteousness by those who maintain it.\r\n\r\nNow it would be impossible here to give a full analysis of the cause of\r\nthis vindictiveness.  It has many causes.  It is not natural, but\r\ncaused by education.  But a principal one lies in our theology.  A\r\ntheology that predicates a God who devotes poor mortals He made to\r\ntorture by fire for ever, simply for the fun of watching them suffer,\r\nhas elevated cruelty, uselessness, and vindictiveness into a divine\r\nattribute.  Therefore men may be excused and even praised for imitating\r\ntheir God as far as in them lies.\r\n\r\nThe East is free from any such theology.  I am not an admirer of any of\r\nthe theories at the base of its religions, but, at all events, none of\r\nthem have sunk to such a depth as this.  Therefore the Oriental thought\r\nis free in this matter to discern the truth.\r\n\r\nAnd further, even the ordinary villagers are deeper psychologists than\r\nwe are.  How this comes about I am not sure; by the free life of the\r\nchildren I think mainly.  But however it comes there is no doubt of the\r\nfact, for it has been widely noticed.  They are very quick at gauging\r\ncharacter, in weighing virtues and defects, at seeing in effects the\r\ncauses.  Thus, all throughout the East the fatality that runs through\r\nlife has been seen; it has even passed into a saying.  By fatality, of\r\ncourse, is not meant that God fore-ordains all events, but that every\r\nact has its antecedent, that it never stands alone but is the outcome\r\nof the past.  There has been endless discussion in Europe on this\r\nquestion, but to the East the matter presents itself in very simple\r\nguise.  No man has the choice of when he is born, into what sort of a\r\nphysique, of what parents or country.  Neither has he any control over\r\nhow he is brought up, whether educated or not.  Thus he himself is to a\r\nvery great extent a creature not of his own will but of what we may\r\ncall Fate.  He has, moreover, no control over his environment; he did\r\nnot make the laws, the customs, nor the religion, which surround him.\r\nMany of his acts are done under the authority of others--parents,\r\nteachers, masters, government; others are the inevitable result of the\r\nenvironment (which he did not make) acting on his personality (which he\r\ndid not make).  There is also chance--as we call it; sudden temptation\r\nfor instance.  Therefore his ability to exercise freewill in act is\r\nsmall, and to hold him personally responsible for all his acts is\r\nabsurd.  Especially is this the case with crime.  No one originally\r\nwants to commit crime; if he fall into it, his \"will\" is not usually to\r\nblame.  A famine will cause a great deal of crime; the criminals did\r\nnot make the famine.  An unusual strain was put on them, and they were\r\nnot able to stand the strain.  Everyone is a potential criminal--given\r\nthe circumstances.  It is more than probable that everyone has at one\r\ntime or another committed some offence.  This is well known in the\r\nEast, for they think there a great deal more than is supposed.  They\r\nhave not been educated not to think yet.  I have myself discussed this\r\npoint with many Orientals, and I have found that this clear view of the\r\ncausation of crime is not unusual.  Even if the matter has not been\r\nthought out there is an instinctive differentiation between a criminal\r\nand his crime.  They, as I have said before, hate crime, but that\r\nshrinking from the criminal so common with us is not so marked with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThus they have long ago seen the futility of attributing crime to a\r\ndefect of the individual will; they know it is due to much deeper,\r\nwider causes.  They have also seen the very narrow limits within which\r\npunishment avails.  Therefore our punishments shock them by their\r\ncruelty.  Ordinary cattle are worth from twenty to fifty shillings a\r\nhead, and they roam about the forest on the outskirts of the fields\r\nalmost unguarded.  Yet the theft of one is punishable always with two\r\nyears' rigorous imprisonment; that is to say, the man is vindictively\r\nand uselessly punished, is turned into a confirmed criminal and ruined\r\nfor life for failing at a momentary temptation.  I have known cases\r\nwhere a man was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude for stealing a\r\nfew rupees--a piece of savagery that the Court sought to justify by the\r\nfact that the man had committed several previous petty thefts.  Of\r\ncourse, the reason of his repeated crime was the man's inability to\r\nearn a livelihood and exercise self-control.  He should have been\r\ntaught and helped--not sent to penal servitude.  So are the instincts\r\nof the people outraged.\r\n\r\nI wonder how many people there are in this world who have not committed\r\nsome criminal offence; few I should think, and those not the most\r\nuseful of mankind.  I have just been reading of Mark Twain's boyhood,\r\nand how, besides \"borrowing\" many articles, he and his friend \"hooked\"\r\na boat, painted it red so that the owner should not recognise it, and\r\nkept it.\r\n\r\nFor that in England a hundred years ago he could and probably would\r\nhave been hanged if caught.  In Burma to-day he _might_, after\r\nconviction, be let off under the first offender sections, but he would\r\nmost probably be sent to a reformatory.  Yet who thinks the worse of\r\nMark Twain for it?\r\n\r\nWe think we have reformed our laws and made them common-sense, but we\r\nhave not.  They are still wicked beyond computation.\r\n\r\nIn _The Soul of a People_, and in I think every book since, I have\r\nanimadverted upon the uselessness and cruelty of our penal system.\r\nWhen a man has committed a crime, what do we do?  Find out the weakness\r\nwhich led to it and cure that weakness--turn him out a whole and\r\nhealthy man again?  No.  We make him worse.  We make a confirmed\r\ncriminal of him.  Is that sense, to say nothing of humanity?  A man who\r\nhas committed a theft is not past cure; a man who has been in gaol\r\ngenerally is.  The people see this clearly enough--that in helping to\r\nget a man convicted they are not improving matters for themselves.  The\r\noffender will come out of gaol a more dangerous character to his\r\nvillage than when he went in.  For they go back to their village; they\r\nare not thrown loose in a great city as in England.  If in England an\r\noffender on his release had to be accepted back into his community, the\r\nuselessness of our penal system would soon come home to the public.\r\nBut we have no communities now in England, only an amorphous herd of\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is clear enough to the East.  Therefore they often\r\nwon't report their losses.  They would sooner submit to the small\r\nmonetary loss than have it on their consciences that they have ruined a\r\nman for life.  And all for what?  Not even to rescue what they have\r\nlost, for the bullock is usually dead and eaten, and no compensation is\r\never given.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of reported crime in Burma is bad enough, but what would\r\nit be if all crimes were reported?  Double, I should think.  I have\r\nknown innumerable cases in my own experience where no report was made\r\neven of serious offences for this reason.  One was a case of attempted\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\nThus there is a great and dangerous gap between the people and the\r\nCourts, and there is no way of bridging it.  In England also there is\r\nthat gap, but it is not so wide, and there are juries who can partly\r\nbridge it.  In Burma, practically speaking, for Burmans trial by jury\r\ndoes not exist.  There is nothing between the accused and the rigid\r\ninjustice of the laws.  The judge and the magistrate are helpless; they\r\nmust follow the law or be pulled up by the High Court.  But a jury need\r\nnot give its reasons; its future does not depend on the Appellate\r\nCourt; it is independent, and therein lies its strength and its\r\nusefulness.  It is juries that put common sense into laws and Courts.\r\n\r\nHere is a case in point where Europeans were concerned.  There was a\r\ncertain big firm, and one day it discovered that it had lost certain\r\nsums of money--not very large.  It could not find out how the loss had\r\noccurred; the partners inquired in secret, but could find no evidence.\r\nHowever, they suspected their cashier.  They knew he was hard up; they\r\nheard he had been gambling.  But they had no proof.  What did they do?\r\nAmend their system of accounts and supervision to prevent loss in the\r\nfuture?  No.  They laid a trap.  They put a large sum within their\r\ncashier's reach in such a way that it would seem he could take it--at\r\nany rate for a short time--with safety.  He took it, and they\r\nprosecuted him.  The case, I think, was clear, but to the astonishment\r\nof the judge, the jury acquitted the cashier.  They gave no reasons, of\r\ncourse, in Court.  They simply said \"Not guilty,\" and there was an end;\r\nbut once out of Court they were not so silent.\r\n\r\n\"Why did we acquit?  Because the firm laid a trap.  They deliberately\r\ntempted him, knowing him to be hard up.  He was not charged with taking\r\nthe first small sums, and in our belief he never took them.  Probably\r\nhe took the last big sum.  But why?  Because they tempted him.  The\r\nfirm were accessory, they were abettors of the crime.  Of course we\r\nacquitted.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I think the general common sense of the community was with them.\r\nNo one has a right to tempt to crime and prosecute if the crime occurs.\r\nBut had accused been a Burman he would have got seven years without a\r\ndoubt.  The Englishman got justice, a Burman would have got only law.\r\nThe Burmans are not blind, do not suppose it; they see this difference\r\nwell enough.\r\n\r\nNothing could demonstrate more conclusively how utterly out of touch\r\nwith the people the Courts are, how useless in preventing crime, than\r\nthe fact that every year Government in despair prosecutes, and either\r\nholds to heavy security, or sends to gaol with hard labour for from six\r\nmonths to two years (mainly two years), over two thousand persons who\r\nare not only not convicted of any offence, but _are not accused of any\r\noffence_.  The exact number in 1910 was 2143.\r\n\r\nThis is done under the Preventive sections of the Criminal Procedure\r\nCode, and anything more unjust, more useless, more provocative of crime\r\nthan this misuse of the sections it is impossible to imagine.  The\r\nlegitimate use of these preventive sections is simple enough.  They are\r\nto meet the case of the police hearing that a crime, say a robbery, is\r\nbeing planned, and that to prevent its occurring, the would-be\r\ncriminals may be called on by a magistrate to find security to be of\r\ngood behaviour.\r\n\r\nBut such cases are rare and the sections are misused.  There are\r\ngeneral circulars in force obliging magistrates and police to use these\r\nsections to their utmost.  When officers are on tour they are enjoined\r\nto demand at each village they visit if there are any idle or doubtful\r\ncharacters about, and if so, to prosecute them.  Pressure is brought to\r\nbear on headmen to produce such characters, and they do\r\nproduce--everyone they have reason to dislike.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is all hearsay.  Here is a summary:\r\n\r\n_Question by Police_: Do you know Accused?\r\n\r\n_Answer by Headman_: Yes.\r\n\r\n_Q_.  What sort of character has he?\r\n\r\n_Ans_.  A bad character.\r\n\r\n_Q_.  What sort of bad character?\r\n\r\n_Ans_.  Well, when B.'s headcloth was missing last year, Accused was\r\nsupposed to have taken it.\r\n\r\n_Q_.  You therefore consider him a thief?\r\n\r\n_Ans_.  Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree such witnesses, and if Accused cannot find substantial security,\r\naway he goes to hard labour for two years.  This has gone on for the\r\nlast twenty years.  In 1910 one judge has actually opened his eyes wide\r\nenough to see that it is a way of manufacturing criminals, and the High\r\nCourt go so far as to have \"misgivings.\"  But there it ends.\r\n\r\nThere are in Burma now probably 60,000 or more men who have been\r\ndeliberately made into criminals by Government.  No wonder crime is bad.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be done?\r\n\r\nThe Indian people have clamoured for trial by jury of their peers--that\r\nis their fellow-countrymen--but it has always been refused.  Government\r\ndoes not say why--but the reason is well known--it is because it fears\r\nthat juries would invariably acquit.  And that fear is probably\r\njustified.  Judging from what assessors do I should say it was fully\r\njustified.  They would acquit.  But does not this very fact indicate\r\nthat the law and the people are at variance?  It most emphatically does\r\nnot mean that the Orientals condone crime; it means that they think\r\nthat crime is now wrongly dealt with.  There was a period in England\r\nwhen juries would not convict.  Why?  Because they condoned crime?  No,\r\nbut because the punishments were too brutal; and the law had to be\r\naltered till their consciences were satisfied.  That was the way the\r\nold penal laws came to be amended.  When juries won't convict it is\r\nbecause their consciences are being outraged in some way.  Has any\r\nattempt ever been made to discover in what way our Courts in India now\r\noutrage the people's consciences?  Never to my knowledge.  There has\r\nbeen the fixed idea that our system is perfect, therefore blame the\r\npeople.  \"They must have Oriental minds which no one can understand.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian Penal Code is the principal law relating to offences and\r\npunishments, but there are many minor laws and all are defective in the\r\nsame way--that they have been framed out of some inner consciousness,\r\nand not out of practical knowledge.\r\n\r\nTake the Gambling Acts in Burma.  The Burmese are a cheerful people,\r\nand, like other cheerful human beings, they like their game of chance\r\nsometimes.  When it becomes a public nuisance, of course it must be\r\nchecked, no one doubts that; but the Gambling Acts go much farther than\r\nthat.  The people have not a great variety of games, and their\r\nprincipal card game is a sort of bank.  It can, of course, become a big\r\ngamble, but it can also be as innocent as penny loo.  Nevertheless, it\r\nis always illegal because there is a banker.  That is the way the Act\r\nis framed.  So if five or six villagers gather in the evening for a\r\ngame at penny loo they can be raided, tried, and fined or imprisoned.\r\nI had a Burmese subordinate magistrate once who was not only a very\r\n\"energetic\" officer but a very religious officer, and he determined to\r\nstop all this \"pernicious gambling\" in his township.  He established a\r\n\"terror,\" so to speak.  He had censors everywhere, and if a schoolboy\r\ntossed another double or quits for a farthing, the law was after them.\r\n\r\nI could not stop him because he had the law behind him, but every month\r\nI sent for all his gambling cases on revision, and I quashed them all.\r\nThere wasn't any Appellate Court behind me in those matters and I had a\r\nfree hand.  Finally, as he wouldn't take a hint, I got my too energetic\r\nassistant transferred to other fields of usefulness.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look well for Englishmen to play bridge and other games of\r\ncards for money in their Clubs and bungalows while the Burmese are\r\ntotally debarred.  It smacks of self-righteousness.  A good deal of our\r\nrule does that now, and it does not tend to make it popular.  In human\r\naffairs there are a time and a place for things, but in law there is\r\nonly the absolute.  Now the absolute is wrong.  And if there is one\r\nquality above another that is detestable it is self-righteousness.  Our\r\nlaws tend to self-righteousness; our judges and officials are very\r\nliable to succumb to that tendency.  It is bad for a man to have to\r\ndeal continually with the seamy side of human nature; he can only keep\r\nhis mind sweet by continual touch with the other side.  But in India\r\nand Burma the ordinary official knows nothing of the other side.  He\r\nhas no dealing with the people except in an official capacity.  He\r\nknows nothing of their ordinary life, their work, or their amusements.\r\nHe does not take an interest in the staple industries of his villages,\r\nnor in the amusements of the people.  Therefore he cannot see how bad\r\nthe laws are because he judges them _a priori_ and not in relation to\r\ntheir effects on the people.  The Indian Penal Code he knows, the\r\naccused and the witnesses he does not know; the Village Act he knows,\r\nthe village organism he is hopelessly ignorant of.  Therefore when\r\nGovernment pass and enforce laws that do more harm than good he cannot\r\ntell them what is wrong.  Naturally, he must believe nothing is wrong.\r\n\r\nYet the whole Penal System of India is wrong.  It is very wrong indeed.\r\nI believe I could keep a district in greater quietness and peace if its\r\nCriminal Courts were abolished altogether and I were allowed to use the\r\nvillage organism in its proper form for preventing crime.  For the\r\nessential truth in dealing with crime, as with disease, is that it can\r\nbe prevented but can rarely be cured.  However, I do not mean to say\r\nthat Criminal Courts, if they administered good laws and were\r\nreasonably constituted, are bad things.  They will in time be to crime\r\nwhat hospitals are to diseases: places where the sufferer goes to have\r\nhis illness diagnosed and cured so that he come out a clean man whom\r\nthe community will be glad to welcome back.  That a man who has once\r\nbeen in gaol is for ever a social leper is the strongest condemnation a\r\nsystem of criminal justice could receive.\r\n\r\nAs things are now the people hate the Courts; they hate the law, all of\r\nit.  It must not be supposed that, because I have pointed out only\r\ncertain defects, all the rest is satisfactory.  That is very far from\r\nbeing the case.  But my object is not to criticise the laws or Courts\r\nexhaustively.  I only want to dissipate the complacency that regards\r\nthem as perfect and the people alone to be blameworthy.  There is no\r\none who more dislikes pointing out deficiencies than I do.  If I could\r\nI would never write anything but pleasant things.  But that is\r\nimpossible.  An imminent danger hangs over our Indian Empire, and so\r\nour own future and its can only be secured by facing the truth.  If\r\nIndian officials on the spot would open their eyes and see things as\r\nthey are there would be no cause to write--but they will not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL COURTS\r\n\r\nWe come now to the Civil Courts, wherein all suits relating to\r\nproperty, to inheritance, and to money are tried.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the archaic state in which, all over India,\r\nmatters of marriage and inheritance remain; no change has taken place\r\nduring our rule, nor could do so.  Except in Burma, all these matters\r\nare connected with religion, and although people when in a progressive\r\nstate will themselves not hesitate to break through fetters of religion\r\nand custom, they will never allow a foreign Government to do so.  Our\r\nGovernment interferes already in a great many matters it had better\r\nleave alone, and to lay a sacrilegious finger on domestic concerns\r\nwould cause instant antagonism.  It is not our business.  Is Government\r\nthus to intrude into the very home?  You can imagine the howl there\r\nwould be, and rightly.  We must not touch them, and the people,\r\ndisorganised as they are, cannot touch them; so there they remain.\r\n\r\nIn a previous book I have referred to the Burmese law that no one may\r\nmake a will, and to its effect in preventing Burmans building up a\r\nbusiness.  Moreover, the law of inheritance is so doubtful sometimes\r\nthat when a rich Burman dies his estate usually goes into Court and,\r\nnaturally, does not come out again.  This is very unsatisfactory, but\r\nuntil there is some real self-government I see no help for it.  On a\r\nmatter of this kind it is of no use collecting the opinions of any\r\nnumber of Burmans as to what should be done, and so passing an Act.  It\r\nis a fact to which I shall have to revert later that men as individuals\r\nwill give an opinion, which if combined into an assembly with authority\r\nto act they would greatly modify.  Moreover, if our Government were\r\nresponsible, individuals would urge action, which if they themselves\r\nwere responsible they would not take.  No advice that is not steadied\r\nby a sense of responsibility is of much value.  Our Government cannot\r\ndeal with such matters.  Only a body representing Burmese opinion and\r\nresponsible to that opinion could do it.  There is not now any prospect\r\nof any such body.  The present Councils are useless.  There may be such\r\na body in course of time, but until there is, matters must remain as\r\nthey are.  The result is discontent, naturally.\r\n\r\nTake another similar point.  In Upper Burma a good deal of the land is\r\nwhat is called ancestral land; that is to say, in private hands.  Now\r\nthere was amongst the people a great pride in holding land their\r\nancestors held, and such land is very rarely sold.  I am not quite sure\r\nthat it can be sold.  Neither is it mortgaged in the usual sense.  What\r\nthe owner does is to hand the land over to a mortgagee for a sum of\r\nmoney.  He pays no interest on the debt because the mortgagee enjoys\r\nthe land.  Such a transaction is called a usufructuary mortgage.  The\r\nowner can at any time redeem the land by repaying the original loan.\r\nIn Burmese time there was no period of limitation, but our Limitation\r\nAct has imposed a limit of sixty years.  Thus a man may hand over a\r\npiece of land to a mortgagee, go off to Lower Burma--as many have--and\r\nat any time within sixty years he or his heirs can redeem the land for\r\nthe same sum.\r\n\r\nConsider what this means.  I am the mortgagee of a piece of land.  If I\r\nimprove it so that its value is increased the owner can come back,\r\nborrow money to redeem it, and re-mortgage it for double the amount\r\nnext day to someone else.  Therefore I certainly won't improve it.  I\r\ncan't sell it.  I can work it of course.  I have also to defend my\r\ntitle every now and then from attack.  It may be that the original\r\nmortgagor did not own the land at all.  He may have simply been the\r\nmember of the family in whom the occupation was vested.  The other\r\nmembers can challenge my right.  They do.  And this sort of thing can\r\ngo on for sixty years.  That is not the sort of law to encourage\r\nprogress.  It encourages litigation, but that is all.  The whole\r\ncountry groans under it naturally.  But before any relief could be\r\ngiven there would have to be some consensus of opinion among the people\r\nas to the change.  Government could not do it themselves.  Even if\r\ntheir amendment were good it would raise a hornets' nest about their\r\nears.\r\n\r\nThus here again is an _impasse_, and a dangerous one, typical of many.\r\n\r\nBy our system of Civil Law and Civil Courts, of precedent and case law\r\nwe have petrified the bonds in which India lay when we arrived and made\r\nthem far more rigid than before.  While by our introduction of new\r\nideas and of greater material progress we have rendered the old laws\r\nmore and more obsolete, we have at the same time stopped all evolution\r\nof these laws, and killed any capacity they had for accommodating\r\nthemselves to change.  Some lawyers even, enthusiastic as they are\r\nabout their own profession, have seen this danger.  Here is what Sir\r\nHenry Sumner Maine, who was Legal Member to the Government of India,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"What that law and usage\"--Indian law and usage--\"was, the Sudder Court\r\nused to ascertain with what some would call most conscientious accuracy\r\nand others the most technical narrowness.  Under the hand of the Judges\r\nof the Sudder Courts the native rules hardened and contracted a\r\nrigidity which they never had in real native practice.  Among the older\r\nrecords of their proceedings may be found injunctions couched in the\r\ntechnical language of English Chancery proceedings which forbid the\r\npriests of a particular temple to injure a rival fane by painting the\r\nface of their idol red instead of yellow, and decrees allowing the\r\ncomplaint of other priests that they were injured in property and\r\nrepute because their neighbours rang a bell at a particular moment of\r\ntheir services.  There is in truth but little doubt that until\r\neducation began to cause the natives of India to absorb Western ideas\r\nfor themselves the influence of the English rather retarded than\r\nhastened the mental development of the race.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it does so more and more, because however much they may absorb\r\nWestern ideas theoretically, they cannot express them practically owing\r\nto our petrifaction of their law and custom.\r\n\r\nAgain.  \"The methods of interpretation which the Sudder Courts borrowed\r\nfrom the Supreme Courts imported from Westminster Hall put a stop to\r\nany natural growth and improvement of Hindu law.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say we introduced new ideas, but sat on the safety-valve\r\nlest they should produce any effect.  Sir Henry Sumner Maine's book is\r\nfull of similar expressions, but I need quote no more.  Those who wish\r\nto read how a lawyer himself has admitted this failure of law will no\r\ndoubt read the book for themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us go on to the other functions of the Civil Courts--money\r\ndecrees and so forth.\r\n\r\nI do not think that they are any more in touch with the public than the\r\nCriminal Courts.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, they suffer from the same defect that a trial before a\r\nCivil Court is not an inquiry into truth, but a duel between parties.\r\nIndeed this is even more manifest than in the Criminal Courts, for\r\nthere the magistrate does to the best of his small ability go outside\r\nthe record and try to ascertain facts for himself; in the Civil Courts\r\nthe judge never does so.  He is simply and purely an umpire.  Has the\r\nplaintiff proved his case?  If so, give him a decree; if not, then not.\r\nTherefore perjury, and even forgery, are more common here than in the\r\nCriminal Courts.\r\n\r\nNow let us go back to the way suits originate, and see what the cause\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, a few cases where the issue is clear from the\r\nfirst.  A dies.  B and C both claim his inheritance.  Here from the\r\nbeginning is a clear issue which can be brought into Court and fought\r\nout.  It must come into Court, because in no other way could it be\r\nsettled.  But there are few such suits.  In the great majority of cases\r\nthe original issue is quite a small one, but when it comes into Court\r\nit is, by one side or the other, or both, swollen out of all\r\nrecognition.  Take the following as an example.  It is from a case I\r\nheard once.\r\n\r\nA and B were both natives of India--Hindus--and had been partners.  I\r\ncannot remember their business beyond that they bought articles in\r\nUpper India and imported them into Upper Burma, where they sold them.\r\nIt was a small business.  One partner would go to India, buy stock, and\r\nreturn with it to Burma.  They would both trade in it, and when it was\r\nnearly done one of them would go away to India again.  This had gone on\r\nfor some years.  They agreed together excellently and made a decent\r\nprofit.  They kept all their accounts in their heads, aided by an\r\noccasional scrap of memoranda, and made a settlement from time to time.\r\n\r\nThen they would begin afresh.\r\n\r\nAt last came a disagreement.\r\n\r\nWhen A returned to Burma with a new stock, B objected to the price paid\r\nfor one item, alleging that A had been \"done,\" and had paid too much.\r\n\r\nA indignantly repelled this accusation.  B stood to his guns.  The item\r\nwas only about five hundred rupees, and the difference was not more\r\nthan twenty or thirty rupees, but neither would give way.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel grew.  B said he would not share in the item; A said he\r\nmust, as it was a partnership transaction.  B said he didn't care.  A\r\nsaid he would sue him in Court.  B said, \"Very well, sue me.\"  So each\r\nwent off to get a pleader.\r\n\r\nIn due time the case came into Court, but what a case!  Each side had\r\nconsidered that if he had got to fight he had better get all the\r\nweapons he could, so he raked up everything he could think of.  It was\r\na duel, you see, wherein each side fought not to settle the little\r\npoint at issue, but for victory--any kind of victory he could get.\r\nEach side stirred up every sleeping dog of war he could find,\r\nresuscitated and galvanised dead dogs, made up imitation dogs, and came\r\nto battle.\r\n\r\nThe issues finally framed covered several years' transactions, and the\r\nevidence included forged documents and quantities of perjury.  Both\r\nsides were ruined.\r\n\r\nThat is what comes of making a trial a duel.  Each side fights for\r\nvictory, to save his _amour propre_, and to wound the enemy wherever he\r\ncan.  The original cause of difference is quite lost.\r\n\r\nNow that case is typical of many.  It is illustrative of human nature\r\nall the world over.  If you awake the fighting instinct you cannot\r\nconfine the parties to the original seat of war; they will urge the\r\nattack wherever they are likely to win.  They cannot go to the judge in\r\nthe beginning as to a friend of both parties who will inquire into the\r\ncause of difference himself and find a reasonable settlement, because\r\njudges are not intended to do that.  Therefore parties do not go to\r\nCourt at all until they have determined to fight it out.  The case does\r\nnot come to Court till matters are hopeless.\r\n\r\nYou may say they should or could have gone to an arbitrator.  Do people\r\nanywhere in the world trust an unofficial arbitrator?  There is a\r\nprovision in Upper Burma allowing reference to arbitration, but it is a\r\ndead letter.\r\n\r\nThe original dispute in this case was about twenty or thirty rupees,\r\nthe alleged excess paid for the goods.  The suit filed was for several\r\nthousand rupees in transactions spread over years: there was an equally\r\nheavy counterclaim.\r\n\r\nThe total value of the suits filed in Burma in 1910 was about\r\n£1,380,000.  I wonder what the value was of the matters first in\r\ndispute before the cases came to Court.  A fifth, I dare say, would\r\ncover them.  I notice much the same thing in England.  Human nature\r\ndoes not differ East or West.\r\n\r\nNow consider the enormous expense of all this.  The value of the\r\nsubject-matter of suits filed in Burma in 1910 was, as I have said,\r\n£1,380,000.  The value of the matters really in dispute before they\r\ncame to Court was infinitely less, but Court fees and lawyers' fees had\r\nto be paid on the full amount.  Witnesses in thousands were called to\r\nprove matters that should never have come into Court at all.\r\n\r\nAnd with what result?\r\n\r\nThere were 70,203 suits filed and decrees given, but in 53,594 of these\r\nsatisfaction could not be obtained, and so the decree-holders had to\r\ncome to Court for warrants for execution.  That is to say that in over\r\nfive suits out of seven the losing party could not or would not pay.\r\n(It does not follow that in the other two out of the seven he did pay.\r\nThe decree-holder in a percentage of cases no doubt did not think it\r\nworth while to go any further.)\r\n\r\nBut in 53,594 cases he came to Court for execution.  What did he get?\r\nIn half these cases he got absolutely nothing; the execution was\r\n\"wholly infructuous.\"  In the other cases satisfaction was obtained in\r\nfull or in part.\r\n\r\nThus out of £1,380,000 claimed how much was obtained?  The Report does\r\nnot give figures, but the reader can judge for himself it wasn't much.\r\nAnd to get even this little, what was the cost to the litigants, that\r\nis the public?  No one knows.  But there are a great many lawyers of\r\nkinds in Burma, and a good deal of money goes into their hands.\r\n\r\nI do not think it would be an over-estimate to say that for every pound\r\noriginally in dispute two pounds were spent in costs and only ten\r\nshillings recovered, and to get this, think of the trouble, the worry,\r\nthe indignity, and the self-contempt involved.  Besides, think of the\r\nwaste of time--to say nothing of truth.\r\n\r\nIn the Report from which I take these figures the Judges of the High\r\nCourt point out that the Courts are yearly becoming less and less used\r\nby the public.  They can't think how this can be; but they suppose it\r\nis due to years of prosperity.  That it should be due to anything wrong\r\nabout the Courts never occurs to them.  Yet perhaps the reader will see\r\nreason to doubt if the system of Civil Justice is perfect.\r\n\r\nThere is an Indian proverb that it is wise to go to law once, foolish\r\nto go twice.  I asked an Indian about this.\r\n\r\n\"Why is it wise to go once?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" he answered, \"you learn a great deal, quite a great deal,\r\nwhich you never forget.  You learn, anyhow, not to go twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I objected, \"suppose on a subsequent occasion money were due to\r\nyou which you couldn't get, would you sit down under the loss?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me and laughed.  \"Well,\" he said, \"if it were a small debt\r\nI should let it go.  If I thought the man could not pay I would let it\r\ngo, big or little; but if I thought he could pay and wouldn't, I\r\nwouldn't sue him; no, but I wouldn't put up with him either.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he answered reflectively, \"I think I should rob him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that might bring you into a Criminal Court,\" I remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"So it might,\" he replied; \"but the Criminal Courts can't be worse than\r\nthe Civil; and, anyhow, it would be a change.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the Insolvent side of the Civil Courts, perhaps if I say that it\r\nis no nearer the people than any other side, enough will have been\r\nsaid, and later on I shall have a story to tell of some of my\r\nexperiences, but this is not the place.\r\n\r\nWhat is gained by imprisoning a man for debt?  Nothing that I ever\r\nheard of.  It is not required to deter him from being ruined again; he\r\nprobably won't get the chance, and if he did the fact of having been\r\nsold up once is quite sufficient deterrent from wanting to be sold up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWill it deter others?  People don't get ruined for the fun of the\r\nthing.  It is a dreadful thing to be sold up; in itself that is quite\r\nenough.  Then what good does imprisoning the poor devil do?  It does\r\nnone.  It does harm, and nothing but harm.  It hurts the debtor and\r\nprevents his recovering himself; it panders to the desire of society\r\nand of creditors for revenge.  There is an idea abroad that when\r\nanything untoward happens somebody should be punished, and then society\r\nwill have vindicated itself.  But the duty of society is to prevent\r\ncrime, not punish it, and it cannot whitewash itself in this way.  It\r\nmerely condemns itself more even than it condemns him it punishes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the ability of creditors to imprison debtors is misused in a\r\nway that is almost criminal.  The creditor will imprison the debtor\r\nwith the hope that the debtor's relatives and friends will subscribe to\r\nsave him and them from this disgrace.  That is to say, the law allows a\r\ncreditor to put improper pressure on totally innocent people in order\r\nto get his claims satisfied.  Think of the iniquity of a law like that!\r\n\r\nAnd what are these claims?  Are they just claims?  They are legal\r\nclaims, but are they just?\r\n\r\nFor the most part they are claims of money-lenders.  The Courts act as\r\ncollecting agencies to the most oppressive system of money-lending that\r\ncan be imagined.  Two and a half per-cent per month is not unusual.\r\n\r\nGovernment has shown its recognition of this danger by creating\r\nCo-operative Credit Banks, which are a great boon.  But it has not\r\nthought of revising its Civil Court procedure.  As in most other\r\nmatters, it recognises something wrong, but attributes it to the\r\npeople, not to the Courts and the law; therefore it does nothing.\r\n\r\nBut at all events imprisonment for debt should be abolished.  There\r\nwere eight hundred unfortunate debtors imprisoned in Burma in 1910.\r\n\r\nDo you wonder that the people dread and hate the Courts?\r\n\r\nCivil law embraces a great variety of suits besides suits for money,\r\nand includes a great number of special laws.  The harm that has been\r\ndone by fossilising Hindu, Mohammedan, and Buddhist law and custom has\r\nbeen already mentioned; to enter further into these matters is\r\nunnecessary.  Once it is clearly recognised that the law and the Courts\r\nrequire amendment, not in details but in fundamental principles, there\r\nwill be many better critics than I am.  For although I have been\r\nobliged to learn some law in order to do my work, I was never an apt\r\nstudent of it.  Humanity and justice are the only studies I really care\r\nfor.  Law is mainly a denial of both.  Therefore if the Government of\r\nIndia and the local officials will but give up thinking that where law\r\nand human nature disagree it is so much the worse for human nature,\r\nthey will soon find out where the present laws are wrong.  But before I\r\nclose this chapter there is one further point I wish to mention, and\r\nthat is the trial of Burmese divorce suits by our Courts.  Now that is\r\nwrong, absolutely wrong, and indefensible in every way.  The Courts are\r\nnot concerned with divorce.  It is by Burmese custom and common sense a\r\npurely village matter.  Divorces can be given by the elders, and they\r\nalone should be allowed to pronounce them.  For they are sensible men,\r\nand in such cases they act not as judges, but as neighbours.  They will\r\ngrant no divorce till they have exhausted all means of conciliation.\r\nThey know the parties as no judge can know them; they know who is to\r\nblame, how he or she is to blame, how the difference can be adjusted.\r\nIt is to their interest to smooth things down and prevent their getting\r\nworse.  Theoretically the breakers of marriages, they are in fact the\r\npreservers of marriage.  It is by their tact and common sense that\r\ncouples are kept together, and that only when matters become impossible\r\ndivorces are granted.\r\n\r\nBut a judge is different.  He knows nothing, cares nothing, can do\r\nnothing but listen to the complaint and grant the divorce.  It must\r\nlegally be granted at the request of either party, remember.  To allow\r\na judge to try divorce cases is a violation of Burmese law and custom,\r\nand is another and deep injury to the village community.  How and why\r\nit was ever allowed I don't know.  I suppose no one ever thought about\r\nit.  Divorces in England are granted by Courts according to English\r\nlaw, therefore in Burma divorces can be granted according to Burmese\r\nlaw.  I suppose that was the argument--if ever there was any argument\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nIn any case it is wrong.  Divorces are properly granted by the elders\r\nacting on behalf of the community, and by no one else.  Therefore the\r\ninterference of the Courts should be immediately stopped.\r\n\r\nBut apart from this, the questions of marriage and inheritance are very\r\ndifficult.  No alien Government can solve them.  They must await a real\r\nCouncil that can deal with such matters with knowledge and\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE\r\n\r\nBut of all the errors of Indian government, none is so serious as their\r\ndestruction of the Village organism throughout India; none has had such\r\nan effect in the past; none is likely to have such bad consequences in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIt is the Village policy of government that has created for it the most\r\ndifficulties, and which is at the bottom of the most serious unrest.\r\nFor it touches not merely a few as criminal law, but practically all\r\nthe population; it affects not only a part of the life of India, but it\r\nhas injured it in its most vital point.  In the whole history of\r\nadministration there is nothing I think so demonstrative of the\r\nignorance of government as the Village policy.\r\n\r\nThe foundation on which not only all government but all civilisation\r\nrests throughout the world is the village.  As this is contrary to the\r\nusual idea that civilisation rests on the family it will be convenient\r\nto shortly show how this is so.  The village is the microcosm of the\r\nState, because it includes within it divers trades and occupations and\r\nraces and religions and castes in one community.  A family does not do\r\nso.  A family is by its nature of one blood, it is almost always of one\r\noccupation.  There are families of cultivators, merchants, priests,\r\nlawyers, smiths, and so on.  It is of one religion, of one caste, of\r\none habit of thought.  A family is narrow and a village is broad.\r\nFamilies divide; villages combine.  Societies organised on the family,\r\nor clan, or tribe principle have always failed--by the very nature of\r\nthings they must so fail.  The Jews are a race, or tribe, and not a\r\nnation.  They have no civilisation of their own, but adopt that in\r\nwhich they live.  The Highland clans had to be broken before the\r\nHighlands could be civilised.  The caste system in India ruined its old\r\ncivilisation, and is the bar to any new civilisation.  The Turkish\r\nEmpire is dead because it was based on a religious caste divided from\r\nall others by a mutilation, and its people could never amalgamate with\r\nothers.  There is a continual flow of peoples to and fro upon the\r\nearth, and village communities absorb the new-comers and thereby\r\nacquire new blood, and, what is far more important, new ideas, to add\r\nto the old and leaven them.  Families, classes and tribes cannot do\r\nthis.  They become stereotyped, and dissolve or die.  Thus the basis of\r\nall civilisation has been the village, or in later times the town.  The\r\ndecay and death of all civilisations have been preceded by the death of\r\nthe local unit.  Thus imperial Rome was itself doomed to death when it\r\ndestroyed local life; and a new civilisation could not be built up till\r\nthe local communities had attained a fresh life.  Florence, Genoa,\r\nMilan, Pisa, Venice, and many others made the civilisation of the\r\nRenaissance.  So in England, a free Parliament was made up of\r\nrepresentatives from free cities and counties.  These have been\r\ndestroyed, and the present constituencies are merely so many voters.\r\nPolicies are no longer decided in Parliament, but in secret party\r\nconclave.  Members are the nominees of that conclave, not of free local\r\norganisms, and Parliament has become a machine to register its decrees.\r\nSo are free institutions passing away.\r\n\r\nThere is no lesson of history more true--more certain--than this, that\r\nthe village or town is the unit of all free life and civilisation.  It\r\ncontains all classes, different races, religions, castes and forms of\r\nthought, and is therefore a real unit.\r\n\r\nNow these units have existed all over the world, and when civilisations\r\nand governments have disappeared they have been built up anew from the\r\nvillages.  In India the village system was the one organism that\r\nsurvived the long years of anarchy and invasion, and it was in full\r\nvigour when we conquered India.  Those who care to read up the subject\r\ncan see it in Sir Henry Sumner Maine's _Indian Village Communities_.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Burma, on its annexation in 1885, the village community was\r\nstrong and healthy; it alone survived the fall of King Thibaw's\r\nGovernment.  Then we deliberately destroyed it, as we had destroyed it\r\nbefore all through India.\r\n\r\nNow this is an instructive and interesting fact, for it was destroyed\r\nin ignorance, not by _malice prepense_.\r\n\r\nThroughout India--and especially in Burma--you will find Government\r\nreiterating its conviction of the importance of preserving the village\r\norganism, repeating the conviction of its absolute necessity, and at\r\nthe same time killing it.  This is but an instance of much of the\r\naction of Government.  It means well; it does actually see the end to\r\nbe attained--it has no idea how to attain that end; but, instead, it\r\nrenders it impossible.\r\n\r\nIf I explain what happened in Burma, the history, _mutatis mutandis_,\r\nof what has occurred throughout India will be clear.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a \"village\" does not mean only one collection of\r\nhouses; it is a territorial unit of from one to a hundred square miles.\r\nOriginally, of course, there was in each unit one hamlet; but, as\r\npopulation grew, daughter hamlets were thrown off.  They still,\r\nhowever, remained under the jurisdiction of the mother hamlet, and they\r\nall together formed one village.  In each village there were a Headman\r\nand a Council of Elders.  The headman was appointed or rather approved\r\nby the Burmese Government for life or good behaviour; the council was\r\nnot recognised by law.  Notwithstanding this, the council was the real\r\npower.  It was not formally elected, it had no legal standing, but it\r\nwas the real power.  The headman was only its representative and not\r\nits master; he was but _primus inter pares_.\r\n\r\nThis headman and council ruled all village matters.  They settled the\r\nhouse sites, the rights of way, the marriage of boys and girls,\r\ndivorces, public manners; they put up such public works as were done,\r\nthey divided the tax amongst the inhabitants according to their means,\r\nand were collectively responsible for the whole.  There was hardly any\r\nappeal from their decision, but the power not being localised in an\r\nindividual but in a council of all the elders, things went well.  The\r\nvillage was a real living organism, within which people learned to act\r\ntogether, to bear and forbear; there were a local patriotism and a\r\nlocal pride.  Within it lay the germ of unlimited progress.\r\n\r\nThe English Government on taking over Upper Burma recognised the\r\nextreme value of this organisation.  In Lower Burma much of our\r\ndifficulty arose from the fact that the organisation was wanting and\r\nthat between Government and the individual there was no one.  So one of\r\nthe first efforts of Government in Upper Burma was to endeavour to\r\npreserve and strengthen this local self-government.  Unfortunately\r\nevery effort it made resulted in destroying it rather than\r\nconsolidating it.  A wrong view was taken from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe council was ignored.  How this happened I do not know, I can only\r\nsuppose that it arose from ignorance.  The only man recognised by the\r\nBurmese Government we replaced was the headman.  They dealt directly\r\nwith him and not with the council.  They did not appoint the council or\r\nregulate it in any way.  In law no council existed.  Therefore, when we\r\ntook over, the law was mistaken for the fact--a common mistake, due to\r\nseeking for knowledge in papers, and not in life--and the council was\r\nignored.  The following seems to have been the argument: Government\r\nappointed the headman, therefore he was an official.  Government did\r\nnot appoint or recognise any council, therefore there was no council.\r\nAnyhow, that was the decision arrived at and enforced.\r\n\r\nThere is on record a circular of the Local Government in which the\r\nheadman of a village is described as a Government official; to be to\r\nhis village what the District Officer is to his district.  That is\r\ndisastrous.  A headman is not an official of the Government.  His whole\r\nvalue and meaning is that he is a representative of the people before\r\nGovernment.  He expresses the collective views of the village and\r\nreceives the orders of Government for them as a whole.  He is _their_\r\nhead, not a finger of Government.  He corresponded almost exactly to\r\nthe mayor of an English town, who would be insulted if you called him a\r\nGovernment official.  Yet this mistaken view was taken of the village\r\nheadman, and this error has vitiated all dealings of Government with\r\nthe village organisation and its headman.  He is appointed by\r\nGovernment instead of being appointed by the people and approved by\r\nGovernment.  He is responsible to Government, not to his village--as he\r\nought to be--for the use or abuse of his powers.  He is punished by\r\nGovernment for laxity.  By the Village Regulation he can be fined by\r\nthe District Officer.\r\n\r\nThere has grown up among Europeans in the East a custom of imposing\r\nfines.  They fine their servants for breakages and innumerable other\r\nsmall matters, and then complain how scarce good servants are.  The\r\nclerks in Government offices used to be subject to continual fines\r\nuntil Lord Curzon stopped it.  Now headmen of villages can be fined by\r\nthe District Officer; and they are fined; the proviso is no dead\r\nletter.  It is a mark of the \"energetic\" officer to use it.  Can there\r\nbe anything more destructive?  Imagine the headman, the mayor of a\r\ncommunity of three or four thousand people, fined five shillings for\r\nthe delay of a return, or set, like a schoolboy, to learn a code--with\r\nthe clerks.  I have seen this done often.  What respect for Government,\r\nwhat from his own people, what self-respect, can he retain after such\r\ntreatment?\r\n\r\nAgain, by ignoring the council and making the headman an official,\r\nGovernment set up a number of petty tyrants in the villages, free from\r\nall control but its own; consequently it has been forced to allow great\r\nlatitude of appeal.  This still further destroys his authority.  He is\r\nunder old custom, legalised by the Village Regulation, empowered to\r\npunish his villagers who disobey him in certain matters.  The\r\npunishments are, of course, trivial.  When approved by the council, as\r\nin old days, they were final; but now they can be appealed against--and\r\nare.  A headman who endeavours to enforce his authority runs the risk\r\nof being complained against and forced to attend Headquarters, to waste\r\ndays of valuable time and considerable sums of money to defend himself\r\nfor having fined a villager a shilling for not mending his fence.  One\r\nor two experiences of this sort and the headman lets things slide in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThus interference with the village is constant and disastrous.  Headmen\r\nare bullied, fined, set to learn lessons like children, all in the name\r\nof efficiency.  And Government wonders why the village system decays.\r\nA continual complaint of Government is that headmen are no longer the\r\nmen they used to be, that they have lost authority.  The best men will\r\nnot take the appointment--and who can wonder?  Here is a story in\r\nillustration:\r\n\r\nThere was a small village in my district, on a main road, and the\r\nheadman died.  It was necessary to appoint a new one.  But no one would\r\ntake the appointment.  The elders were asked to nominate a man, but no\r\none would take the nomination.  I sent the Township Officer to try to\r\narrange; he failed.\r\n\r\nNow a village cannot get along without a headman.  Government is at an\r\nend; no taxes can be collected, for instance; therefore it was\r\nnecessary a headman be appointed at once.  I went to the village myself\r\nand called the elders and gave them an order that they must nominate\r\nsomeone.  So next morning, after stormy meetings in the village, a man\r\nwas brought to me and introduced as the headman-elect.  He was dirty,\r\nill-clad, and not at all the sort of man I should have cared to\r\nappoint, nor one whom it would be supposed the villagers would care to\r\naccept.  Yet he was the only nominee.\r\n\r\n\"What is your occupation?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe said he had none.\r\n\r\n\"What tax did you pay last year?\"  I asked him this in order to\r\ndiscover his standing, for men are rated according to their means.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he had paid five shillings--less than a third of the\r\naverage.\r\n\r\n\"You are willing to be headman?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said frankly.  \"But no one would take the place, and the\r\nelders told me I must.  They said they would prosecute me under the\r\n'bad livelihood' section if I didn't.  I could take my choice between\r\nbeing headman or a term in prison.\"\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, an extreme case, but it illustrates the position.\r\nThe headman is degraded and all administration suffers.\r\n\r\nIt is the same in municipalities.  The work is done by the District\r\nOfficer because it is easier for him to do it than to instruct and\r\nallow others to do it.\r\n\r\nThe people one and all hate this.  The headman hates it, because though\r\nhe is given much greater power nominally than he used to have he dare\r\nnot use this power.  He is isolated from his villagers, and so often\r\nbecomes an object of dislike to them.  Through him orders are enforced\r\nwhich are not liked by the people, and he has to bear all the brunt.\r\nHis dignity is gone.  Sometimes he is murdered.\r\n\r\nThe elders hate it.  They have been ignored.  They are placed under a\r\nheadman who may or may not attend to what they say.  They have lost all\r\ninterest--because all power--in their village affairs.  They have no\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe villagers hate it.  A council of their own elders they could\r\nrespect and submit to; a one-man rule they detest.  Their appeal to the\r\ncouncil on the spot (who know) has been lost; and in place of it they\r\nhave an appeal to a distant officer who, with the best will in the\r\nworld, cannot know.  An appeal costs money, and even to win may be to\r\nlose.  They all want to manage their affairs; they can do it far better\r\nthan we can, and there is nothing they so much appreciate as being\r\nallowed to do so.  Here is how I learnt this:\r\n\r\nSome eighteen years ago I was leaving a station where I had been for a\r\nyear as subordinate officer, and had to cross the river by launch to\r\nthe steamer station on the other shore.  I went down to the bank to get\r\nthe launch, but it was late.  I saw it three miles away, and so sat\r\ndown under a tree to wait.\r\n\r\nPresently two or three elderly Burmans came and sat down near me.  Then\r\ncame others, till maybe twenty elderly men were there.  I recognised\r\ntwo or three vaguely, but none clearly.  I wondered at their being\r\nthere, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are you crossing over too?\"\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\"What are you here for, then?\"\r\n\r\nThey looked embarrassed, and at last one spoke.  \"We came to say\r\n'Good-bye' to you.\"\r\n\r\nI stared.  \"But I do not know you, except that I suppose you are elders\r\nof the town.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are,\" they said, \"and you do not know us because you have not ever\r\nworried us in any way.  When we had business together you did it\r\nquickly and decisively; otherwise you left us alone.  You did not treat\r\nus as children.  Therefore we are sorry you are going.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed.  I could not help it.  To come and express regret at a man's\r\nleaving on the ground that they knew next to nothing of him and did not\r\nwant to know more seemed unusual.\r\n\r\nBut it was true.  And often, after, did I think over that \"send-off\"\r\nand take the lesson to heart.\r\n\r\nNow what is true in Burma is true over all India.  The local\r\ncircumstances of course vary.  A lumbadar in the North-West, for\r\ninstance, does not quite correspond to a headman in Burma.  The actual\r\nform in which the village was organised differs from place to place\r\naccording to local needs.  Even in Burma it differed a good deal.  But\r\nthe differences were only of form.  In all India there were\r\nself-contained village communities within which, to a certain extent,\r\ncaste, religion, and race were subordinated to local communal feeling.\r\n\r\nAnd everywhere Government has killed it by turning the village\r\nofficials into Government officials, responsible to Government and not\r\nto the village.\r\n\r\nThus there is now absolutely no organism a man can belong to.  There\r\nare three hundred and fifty million individuals in India, and that is\r\nall.  They are divided laterally into strata by caste and religion, and\r\nthere is no influence to draw them together.  All organised life is\r\ndead.  Government by means of its official--the headman--interferes\r\nwith almost every detail of life, regulating his conduct by rules drawn\r\nup in Secretariats by men who never knew what a village was, and the\r\nappeal is to another alien officer.\r\n\r\nFurther, all morality and all conduct are the outcome of corporate\r\nlife, that is to say, of the village or of a larger unit.  Morality is,\r\nin fact, where it is useful and true, the knowledge of how to get along\r\nwith your fellow men and women, what conduct offends them and leads to\r\nthe injury of society, what pleases them and tends to harmony and\r\nmutual happiness.  It is not fixed, but adapts itself to changing\r\ncircumstances of the society, and it is enforced by the opinion of that\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nBut injure the society and both manners and morals are shaken.  It is a\r\ncommon complaint of India to-day that the bonds of morality have\r\ngreatly slackened and that manners have almost disappeared.  This is\r\nattributed to the waning influence of religions.  But, generally\r\nspeaking, religions have not waned in India--on the contrary, their\r\ninfluences have increased.  The people have become more and more in the\r\npower of religious systems.  Therefore the cause given is absurd and\r\nuntrue.  It does not exist.  Further, neither morality nor manners are\r\nthe outcome of religion.  On the contrary.  Religions claim them to be\r\nso, but the claim is false.  Manners and morals may be said to be the\r\ngravity which binds individuals into a community.  They make the\r\ncommunity and are themselves the outcome of the community.  Destroy the\r\ncommunity and you have destroyed the source from which manners and\r\nmorals arise.\r\n\r\nThat has been done all through India.  In another book I have pointed\r\nout how disastrously this has acted in Burma and how much the people\r\nfeel it.  I do not want to repeat myself.  But if those officials who\r\ndeplore the frequent cases of young girls running away with boys, of\r\nseduction, of adultery and other offences, of immature marriages, and\r\nother mistakes, would but realise that all these arise from the injury\r\nwe have caused to society, there might be a change.  All the human\r\nvirtues, with no exception, either arise from or are increased by the\r\naggregation of men into communities, and it is very difficult to keep\r\nthem alive where no organic communities exist.  Consider the words\r\nhumanity, civilisation, patriotism, urbanity--their derivations and\r\ntheir meanings--and you will see this.\r\n\r\nI do not think I need say more.  I have tried to set out the facts as\r\nclearly and dispassionately as I can.  I have omitted much that I might\r\nhave said.  I have tried here, as throughout, to understate\r\ndifficulties rather than exaggerate them, because exaggeration defeats\r\nits own ends.  But I think if the reader will try to realise to himself\r\nthe state of affairs where no village has a say even in its simplest\r\naffairs, and where everything is under the eye of a Government\r\nofficial, where all initiative is forbidden and where the best men\r\nstand aloof from all interest in village affairs, he will have some\r\nidea that unrest is not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe village organism was the one vital institution left to India; it\r\nwas the one germ of corporate life that could have been encouraged into\r\na larger growth.  It has been killed.  It will have to be resuscitated\r\nbefore India can cease to be _India Irredenta_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nOPIUM AND EXCISE\r\n\r\nI will begin what I have to say about this by telling a little story\r\nabout what happened to me when I was a Subordinate Magistrate--some\r\nsixteen years ago now.\r\n\r\nA Burman was brought up before me charged with possessing opium.  A\r\nSergeant of Police had met him at a rest-house in the jungle the day\r\nbefore, and had entered into conversation.  The man was sickly and told\r\nthe Sergeant that he was on his way down from the Shan States, where he\r\nhad gone to trade.  But he had caught the prevalent fever, had then\r\nlain ill and lost his money.  So he was going home again to his village\r\nabout fifty miles away, where he hoped to recover his health.\r\nMeanwhile he took a little opium for the fever, for in the Shan States\r\nopium is not contraband.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you have opium?\" asked the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"I brought some down with me,\" the man said, producing it.  Then the\r\nSergeant, as in duty bound, arrested him and brought him into Court.\r\n\r\nThe case was quite clear.  The man admitted the opium, urged that he\r\nwas ill, also that he did not know--neither of which is a defence in\r\nlaw--and I passed the smallest sentence that I thought the High Court\r\nwould allow to pass without a reprimand.  I fined him ten rupees or in\r\ndefault ten days' imprisonment.  Then I went on to other cases and\r\nforgot about it.  At four o'clock I left the bench and went to my\r\nprivate room to sign papers before leaving Court.  There was a pile of\r\nthem.  I signed, the peon pulled away; I signed again, he pulled; and\r\nso on till I looked up.  There in the doorway stood the Sergeant.  He\r\nseemed embarrassed.  He smiled an awkward smile, saluted, and then\r\nstood doubtfully on one foot and the other.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I asked, surprised.  \"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then you needn't stay,\" I said suggestively, and went on signing.  He\r\ndidn't go.  He smiled again and swallowed.  I signed a dozen sheets or\r\nmore and then looked up, and there he was, still smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I asked, \"what is the matter?  Out with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all poor men,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Who are?\" I asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"All we police,\" he said.  \"I gave a whole rupee, but the others could\r\ngive but a penny or twopence each because they are only constables.  We\r\ncould not afford more.  We are poor men, your Honour.\"\r\n\r\nI stopped my signing.  \"Sergeant,\" I said, \"come here.  I don't know\r\nwhat you're talking about.  What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a little girl,\" he answered, coming up to the table.  \"That's\r\nthe difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nI held my head between my hands.  I had no idea of what he could be\r\ntalking about.  The syncopated method of beginning a conversation which\r\nBurmese often use made my head ache.  I stared, he stared.  At last I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Sergeant, I'm going home,\" and rose.  Then it all came out.\r\n\r\nIt was the opium smuggler.  He could not pay the fine, for he was\r\npenniless.  He had no friends this side of fifty miles away, and he had\r\nwith him a little daughter aged ten years or so.  This was, of course,\r\nthe first that I had heard of her, but it seems that she was just\r\noutside when her father was being tried, and when she heard he had to\r\ngo to gaol she was in despair.  They wept together.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Sergeant whose zeal had caused the trouble repented of\r\nhis work and took up a collection.  In the police-office and among my\r\nclerks he got five rupees.  That was but half, and they did not know\r\nwhere to get the rest.  Then someone had a brilliant idea.  \"Go,\" he\r\nsaid to the Sergeant, \"ask the magistrate.\"  \"Therefore,\" said the\r\nSergeant, \"I came in to your Honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The other five rupees.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed.  How could I help it?  The audacity of the demand, that I,\r\nthe magistrate, should pay half the fine that I had myself inflicted!\r\n\r\n\"Sergeant,\" I said severely, \"what have you and I to do with offenders\r\nwho break the law?  Are we to pay for them?  What is the good of _your_\r\narresting them and my fining them if we afterwards pay their fines for\r\nthem?  We make a mockery of the law and ruin ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"You see the point?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe did.\r\n\r\n\"Then I am going home.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant saluted.  \"I didn't suppose your Honour has the money in\r\nCourt.  Shall I come for it or will your Honour send it over?\" he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"Send what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The five rupees.\"\r\n\r\nI sent it over.\r\n\r\nThis story, besides illustrating the kindheartedness of the people and\r\ntheir quickness to see the injustice of a law and try to remedy it,\r\nshows the difficulty Government have in this matter of opium.\r\n\r\nNow I do not intend to go into this very controversial subject.  I have\r\nread the evidence and the Report of the Opium Commission some years\r\nago, and I have my own opinion about both.  That I will keep to myself.\r\nAll I have to say here is that opium in reasonable doses is a most\r\nvaluable drug--the most valuable we have.  It is in fever-haunted\r\ndistricts the best friend of the people.  Some of the best fighting men\r\nof the Empire take it and demand it.  In its time and place it is no\r\nmore harmful than liquor, and I have no belief in putting the world\r\ninto an iron case of everlasting \"Don'ts.\"  People should be made\r\ntemperate by training and judicious restriction of opportunity, and not\r\nmade the slaves of laws.  I don't believe in slavery of any kind.\r\n\r\nBut opium can be and is abused, and there is no doubt that amongst the\r\nBurmese generally there is a desire that its use be totally prohibited.\r\nA general opinion like that should be respected whether it is right or\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThere comes the difficulty.  Take Burma as a whole and consider it.\r\nThe vast majority of the inhabitants are Burmese, but in places in\r\nLower Burma there are large colonies of Hindus and Mohammedans.  There\r\nare, moreover, many Chinese traders and carpenters spread about all\r\nover.  They are accustomed to use opium, were so accustomed before they\r\ncame there, would not have come if they could not have got their\r\nstimulant.\r\n\r\nThen, again, Burma is bounded on the east by the independent Shan\r\nStates, where there is a great deal of fever, where opium grows, and\r\nthe people use it.  Beyond these States is China, where opium is grown\r\nlargely.  Moreover, there are in Lower Burma one or two districts where\r\nfever is very deadly and opium is used by the Burmans with the consent\r\nof public opinion.\r\n\r\nNow sum up all these factors, and see how complicated the problem is.\r\n\r\nThe Burmans generally want opium prohibited.  \"Very well,\" says\r\nGovernment; \"we will prohibit it for Burmans; but what about the rest\r\nof the population?  They want it; their public opinion does not forbid\r\nit.  They are immigrants, and would not have come if they had been\r\nunable to get it.  Therefore there must be opium shops for them.  But\r\nBurmans shall not be allowed to buy.\"\r\n\r\nSo far so good in appearance.  The Burman may not buy from the shop,\r\nand doesn't.  He buys from a friendly Chinaman, who for a little\r\ncommission buys the opium at the shop and hands it over outside.\r\n\r\nBut this trick was discovered, and Government did its best.  It\r\nallowanced all Chinamen.  They could buy so much and no more, just\r\nenough for their own use.  If they sold to Burmans they had to go\r\nwithout themselves.\r\n\r\nThat was excellent, only there were two ways round.  One was for\r\nChinamen who did not use opium--not all do--to act as honest broker;\r\nthe other was smuggling from the Shan States.  The quantity of opium\r\nsmuggled down from the Shan States cannot be estimated, nor can it be\r\nstopped.  How can you guard five hundred miles of frontier all mountain\r\nand forest, intersected by forest paths?  Opium is light, compact,\r\neasily concealed.  Government does its best, but it cannot do the\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Acts are widely evaded, which is always a bad thing; but\r\nthere is a worse effect than this--there is discrimination by\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nI do not think there can be anything worse than an Act that says such\r\nand such an act is right and proper for people of one nationality but\r\nwrong and penal for people of another.  A Chinaman may walk about and\r\ndo openly what if a Burman does he goes to gaol for.  What difference\r\nis there between the natures of the two people to make such a\r\ndifference?  There is none.  Therefore the effect of this law, although\r\nit be according to the general desire, is to make the Burman feel that\r\nhe is a child not to be trusted.  This is a bad feeling.  If opium were\r\ntotally prohibited in Upper Burma for everybody except Indian troops or\r\nofficials sent there by Government, and therefore not free to stay\r\naway, this feeling would not arise.  If local option is to have effect\r\nit should be by areas and not races.\r\n\r\nThe same thing applies to alcohol.  An Indian coolie can go and buy\r\nsome liquor and have a drink with his friends.  A Burman may not.  At\r\nleast not of licit liquor.  Therefore a great deal of illicit liquor is\r\ndistilled.\r\n\r\nTry to see how demoralising all this is.  Take a town like Sagaing, my\r\nlast head-quarters, which is really only a big village, and note the\r\nresults.  There is a liquor shop where European liquors, beer, and\r\nspirits are sold, and there are several shops where native spirits are\r\nsold.  A European, or half-caste, or Hindu, or Mohammedan of the better\r\nclasses could go and buy a bottle of Bass or of Dyer's ale at the\r\nEuropean shop and take it home for dinner.  The Burmese magistrates,\r\ninspectors of police, and so on could not--legally.  My Treasury\r\nofficer, being a Burman, was debarred; his subordinate, a native of\r\nIndia, was not debarred.  What happens?  Well, I don't know.  But I\r\nbought a pony once from a very respectable and able Burmese Inspector\r\nof Police, and the first morning I rode him he took me gently but\r\nfirmly to the back door of the liquor shop.  That gave me an idea, but\r\nI kept the idea to myself.  I have often had ideas of this nature.\r\n\r\nThen take the poorer classes.  Is it good for one race of people to see\r\nanother making merry with a glass while it is illegal for them to do\r\nso?  Does it not create bitterness, to say the least?  Does it not\r\nperpetuate differences that must disappear if self-government is to\r\nsucceed?\r\n\r\nHere, again, if laws are to succeed they must be in accordance with the\r\ndesires of the people.  Only the people at large can stop smuggling.\r\nRead the history of how English smuggling was stopped; it was because\r\nno one could smuggle without being informed on--that is to say, public\r\nopinion had turned against them.\r\n\r\nBut that is not so in Burma.  Were prohibition of opium or spirits by\r\nlocalities where all were treated alike, you could ask the people to\r\nhelp you to enforce their wish.  But for opium and liquor to be sold to\r\nsome and refused to others is not a local option.  No one likes it, and\r\nno one will help to stop smuggling.  That is human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment has been and is greatly abused for its opium and liquor\r\npolicy, but I think if facts are looked at squarely it will be seen\r\nthat the situation is very difficult.  The only way out that I can see\r\nis through local self-government.  If the scheme that I sketch out at\r\nthe end of this book took form there would be local option eventually,\r\nand people will submit to what they themselves enact, whereas they\r\nchafe against the same thing when imposed from above.  That is human\r\nnature, and it is a very valuable trait of human nature.  It is the\r\nrevolt against subjection, and the declaration that the objective of\r\nlife is to be free.  The only morality of any value comes from within;\r\nthat imposed from without may improve the body, but it enervates the\r\nsoul.  Now the body is temporary and the soul eternal.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I may end my criticism of the machinery of government.  Not that\r\nany of the other branches of the administration are better than those I\r\nhave written of.  The land laws are, I think, worse, because they are\r\nbased on imported fixed ideas and not on any careful investigation of\r\nfacts and the underlying causes of facts.  The police administration is\r\nbad; the village administration worse than bad.  But I do not want to\r\ncriticise; I want to establish my point, which is that the unrest in\r\nIndia is a legitimate unrest, that it is not factitious or political,\r\nbut based on very real grievances that must grow till they are relieved.\r\n\r\nI have picked out these four branches of the administration: the\r\nCriminal and Civil Courts, the Villages, and the Opium and Excise, for\r\nspecific reasons.  The reason I chose the first two is because no one\r\never seems to have suspected before how bad they were.  Everyone has\r\ngone on the fixed idea that because the magistrates and judges are\r\nhonest and the law up to date there can be nothing to complain of in\r\nthem.  The fault must be in the people.\r\n\r\nOnly as I write I get a letter to this effect from an officer of long\r\nexperience.  He had \"never seen anything wrong with the Courts.\"\r\nTherefore I have set out the facts to the best of my ability.  I want\r\nthe reader to see for himself.  I don't want him to accept my authority\r\nthat they are bad; I don't believe in authority.  I want him to think\r\nover the facts I have laid before him and frame his own judgment.  I\r\nthink that he will see that the Courts which have been declared\r\nimpregnable are very vulnerable indeed.\r\n\r\nThe reason I chose the Village is because it is the unit of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nThe reason I chose the Opium and Excise was different.  Whereas\r\nGovernment has never been criticised for its Courts and its law, which\r\nare bad, it has received unending criticism for its Opium and Excise\r\npolicy.  Yet, mistakes apart, I don't see how it is much to blame.  The\r\ndifficulties are inherent.  They are the same in nature as those that\r\nbeset liquor legislation in England.  The question has not been solved\r\nhere; far from it.  In fact, it is insoluble by Act; it is only soluble\r\nby education of the individual.  The right and temperate use of alcohol\r\nand drugs is a personal, not a State question.  Therefore where\r\nGovernment could have been criticised it was not, and where it did its\r\nbest in great difficulties it was abused.  This will give a key to\r\nanother difficulty in India: Government receives hardly any good and\r\nuseful criticism from any side.  It is abused and praised, but that\r\nunderstanding criticism which is of the greatest value to individuals\r\nand Governments is wanting.  The Indians are feeling serious unrest,\r\nand they cannot diagnose the cause--no one can diagnose himself--so\r\nthey strike out at random against Government measures and officials.\r\nThey are like a certain party in England who also are unhappy with\r\nthings as they are, and who express their dissatisfaction at, say, the\r\nmarriage laws--which were made not by man, but by Churches, whose great\r\nsupporters were and are women--by smashing the orchid house at Kew.  It\r\nreminds me of Andrew Lang's ghost.  What he wanted to say was that the\r\ndrains were out of order and a danger to all the inhabitants of the\r\ncastle.  But he suffered from aphasia, and the nearest he could get to\r\nan indication of his meaning was driving round and round the castle at\r\nmidnight in a hearse and four.\r\n\r\nMost changes arising in societies are incoherent in the same way, but\r\nit must not be supposed that because the expression is irrelevant there\r\nis no real and serious cause beneath it.  When an overboiling kettle\r\nspills and scalds the cat who never did the kettle any harm, it is hard\r\nluck on the cat, but it is not unnatural in the kettle.  And it would\r\nbe dangerous therefore to stop up the spout.  Later on the kettle might\r\nexplode and damage the cat's master.\r\n\r\nThe English papers in India want to support Government, which is right;\r\nbut the best support they could give would be to point out where\r\nGovernment goes wrong and help it to go right.  They never do that,\r\nbecause the editors live in towns and know nothing of the country.\r\nMoreover, they too suffer from fixed ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with the criticism the Indian Government gets from\r\nEngland.  There are here practically only two parties.  One says, \"Sit\r\ntight on the safety-valve and shoot anyone who comes near you\"; and the\r\nother says \"Give government to the people.\"  Now there is no organised\r\nIndian people as yet to give it to.\r\n\r\nNo Government has ever had so little help from intelligent criticism as\r\nthe Indian Government; none ever needed it more.  No Government in the\r\nworld is more sincerely desirous of the good of the people it governs;\r\nnone knows so little how to secure it.\r\n\r\nYou cannot have any work done efficiently unless there is honest and\r\nunderstanding criticism.  No sensible person objects to it if it is\r\ngiven sincerely and fairly.  But that is not so in India.  Considering\r\nhow unfair most criticism of the Indian Government is, it shows great\r\nself-restraint in the consideration it accords to it.  And you can't\r\nexpect Government officials to criticise themselves.  It isn't part of\r\ntheir functions and it isn't fair to ask it.  Their duty is to carry\r\nout the laws and orders they receive.  They have neither the time nor\r\nthe attitude of mind to be always criticising them.\r\n\r\nBut there ought to be somebody whose function is to investigate the\r\nworking of government, and to suggest and criticise.  In England it\r\nused to be done--badly--by Parliament and the papers.  Now no one does\r\nit: everyone now only seeks \"party\" advantage.  In China there used to\r\nbe censors whose duty it was, I am told, to watch the working of the\r\nmachine and criticise it.  That would be an admirable idea if it could\r\nbe carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Government of India should have censors.  They should be well paid,\r\nand I think their lives would have to be heavily insured.  Their\r\nreports should not be pigeon-holed, but published.\r\n\r\nAt present this ill-informed criticism of Government has succeeded in\r\nachieving one and is pressing another measure for the alleviation of\r\nthe unrest which can do nothing but harm.  The danger is that\r\nGovernment, not knowing the right thing to do and pressed to do\r\nsomething, will accept these measures rather than be accused of\r\nignoring the unrest.\r\n\r\nIndia is lost to us--lost in spirit, and only awaiting the opportunity\r\nto be lost in substance.  How shall she be regained?\r\n\r\nGovernment have two ideas.  Let us see what these are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nCOUNSELS OF DESPAIR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCILS\r\n\r\nThe first step that has been taken with the hope of allaying the\r\ndiscontent in India has been the increase in the Councils of the\r\nGovernment of India and of the Local Governments of Madras and Bombay,\r\nwith the creation of Councils in the other Provinces which did not have\r\nthem before.\r\n\r\nAnd as these Councils have been in certain quarters greatly praised as\r\nbeing not only good in themselves now but as containing the germs of\r\ngreat possibilities, it is necessary to consider them carefully.\r\n\r\nCouncils were first instituted in India in 1861, were enlarged in 1892,\r\nand again much enlarged in 1909; thus they are no new thing, and their\r\nvalue is already fairly obvious.  Moreover, since the enlargements of\r\nthe Act of 1909 some time has elapsed, so that I am not here\r\ncriticising institutions which have not yet had a chance of showing\r\nwhat they can do.\r\n\r\nThere are Executive Councils for the Government of India and for the\r\nProvincial Governments of Bombay and Madras, and there are Legislative\r\nCouncils for the Government of India and for each Province.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the law for the constitution of these Councils is\r\ncontained in the Indian Councils Acts of 1861, 1892, and 1909, and the\r\nRules for the nomination or election of the members are contained in\r\nBlue Book Number Cd 6714, published in 1913.  I give these references\r\nin order that anyone who cares to go into the subject in greater detail\r\nthan I can in this chapter will be able to find all his material\r\nreadily.  He will be able to see how other Councils than those I intend\r\nto deal with here are constituted; also in what way and by what\r\nconstituencies elected members are chosen.  There is a great deal that\r\nmight well be said on each of these Councils.\r\n\r\nBut the only Councils I propose to deal with here are those of the\r\nGovernment of India and of the Province of Burma.  I would have liked\r\nto include the Council of Madras but that I think the subject can be\r\nfairly understood without this.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Council of the Government of India consists of the\r\nGovernor-General and nine members.  These form the Cabinet of India,\r\nand, subject to the control of the Secretary of State, it has supreme\r\npower.  It includes the Commander-in-Chief and members for Finance,\r\nPublic Works, Home affairs and so on.\r\n\r\nThe only alteration made in this Council is by declaring that one of\r\nthe members must be an Indian.  So far that member has been the Law\r\nMember, and it is somewhat difficult to see how any other post could be\r\nfilled by an Indian.  You can find Indian lawyers, many, perhaps too\r\nmany of them, but where are you to find Indians with that necessary\r\nexperience that would fit them to be Finance or Home Members or\r\nCommander-in-Chief, for instance?\r\n\r\nThe appointment of this Indian gentleman to be Law Member has not been\r\nfollowed by any striking results.  Law in India is petrified, and until\r\nthe great reform takes place petrified it must remain.  It does not\r\nseem to matter very much who is head of it.  When reform comes it will\r\nnot be an Indian who could undertake it.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Council is formed of the Executive Council and\r\nAdditional Members.  Before 1909, Additional Members were few, they\r\nwere nominated and there was always a good Government majority.  Since\r\n1909 it has been constituted as follows:\r\n\r\n  Nominated Members\r\n  28 officials\r\n  5 non-officials.\r\n\r\nOf these five non-officials one is to represent the Indian Commercial\r\ncommunity, one the Mohammedans of the Punjab, and one the landowners in\r\nthe Punjab.  The other two nominated members may be anyone apparently.\r\n\r\nThen there are twenty-seven elected members; two each to represent the\r\nfour large Provincial Councils; one each for the five smaller\r\nProvinces, one each to represent the landowners of six Provinces; five\r\nrepresentatives of Mohammedans in these five Provinces; one member each\r\nto the Chambers of Commerce of Bengal and Bombay; and one extra\r\nMohammedan member.  Thus in this assembly there are represented in a\r\nway nine Provinces as wholes, the landowning class of some Provinces,\r\none religion and the trade of two cities.\r\n\r\nTo make it clearer to the reader who has not been to India, let me put\r\nit in this way.  India is as big as Europe without Russia, and has\r\nthree hundred million inhabitants, more than Europe.  Suppose Europe\r\nwere conquered and administered by Martians, and they were to establish\r\na Council.  If they did it on similar principles to this Legislative\r\nCouncil of the Government of India it would consist of:\r\n\r\nTwo members each for Germany, France, Great Britain, and Italy, one\r\nmember each for five smaller nations, one representative each for the\r\nlandowners in Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and\r\nSpain, five representatives of Protestants as Protestants, and one each\r\nfor the Chambers of Commerce of London and Paris.\r\n\r\nWhat would the reader think of this as a Council to make laws for all\r\nEurope?  What would he say?  I think he would say many things.  He\r\nwould also ask some questions.  He would ask:\r\n\r\nFirstly, how can two members represent great countries--like England\r\nfor instance?  Or one represent another great area and people like\r\nSpain?  Is it conceivably possible that one or at best two individuals\r\ncould have the necessary knowledge or impartiality to do this?\r\n\r\nHis second question would be: How can one man represent landowners\r\nspread over a great territory with different forms of tenure, different\r\ncrops, different climates, different nationalities?\r\n\r\nHis third would be: Two cities are represented; where are the others?\r\n\r\nHis fourth would be: At best, all these members can but represent, in\r\neven ever so faint a way, their own class who elects them.  Say at a\r\nliberal estimate that they represent more or less imperfectly half a\r\nmillion people; what about the two hundred and ninety-nine and a half\r\nmillion who are left out?  Who are to protect tenants from landlords,\r\nthe innumerable unrepresented religions from that one which is\r\nrepresented, the voiceless cities from the two which have voices?  In\r\nfact, who is to protect Europe from these few privileged classes?\r\n\r\nThat would be analogous to what is happening in India.  These questions\r\nare being asked.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the first question is quite simple.  The two members do\r\nnot represent Madras, nor does the one member represent Burma.  They\r\nrepresent the non-officials of the Local Council, and that is all; that\r\nis to say, ten or fifteen individuals of much their own class and\r\nstanding.  It is not likely that they have any knowledge of the country\r\nthey are to represent, except the chief town.  It is quite certain that\r\nthey have never even travelled over half their country, nor speak more\r\nthan one or two of the various tongues.\r\n\r\nThey have no knowledge of the administration anywhere, nor any\r\nadministrative ability.  If a question vital to their Province arose\r\nthey would not know what to do; and if they did know they would not\r\ndare to do it if it involved any responsibility, because they have no\r\nbacking in the country supposed to be theirs.  They are totally\r\nunknown, even by name, to nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every\r\nthousand inhabitants.  In fact, even this is an over-estimate.  They\r\nare not only without knowledge of the immense majority of \"their\"\r\npeople, but are antagonistic in race and religion to many of them, so\r\nthat it is only the English Government that keeps the peace.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the second question is much the same as to the first.\r\nFancy one member representing the Nair landholders of Malabar, the\r\nPoligars, the Tamils, the Telugu landholders, and many others.  It is\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nThere is no answer to the third question.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the fourth is that whatever help and representation and\r\ndefence the bulk of India can obtain must be obtained from the English\r\nofficial members.  They alone are quite impartial; they may be\r\ncomparatively ignorant, but their ignorance is light compared to that\r\nof the native members, for it includes a knowledge of administration\r\nobtained by experience, which none of the latter have.  It is we alone\r\nwho have raised the people economically, and have done it often enough\r\nagainst the influence of class.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Council of the Government of India is so constituted that\r\nwhereas perhaps half a million people are represented directly or\r\nindirectly by class and religion, the two hundred and ninety-nine and a\r\nhalf million have no representation at all and must depend on the\r\nEnglish officials.\r\n\r\nThis is no new discovery of mine.  Here is what Lord Curzon said in the\r\ndebate in the House of Lords on this new Act: \"I wonder how these\r\nchanges will in the last resort affect the great mass of the people of\r\nIndia--the people who have no vote and have scarcely a voice.  Remember\r\nthat to these people, who form the bulk of the population of India,\r\nrepresentative government and electoral institutions are nothing\r\nwhatever.  I have a misgiving that this class will not fare much better\r\nunder these changes than they do now.  At any rate, I see no place for\r\nthem in these enlarged Councils which are to be created, and I am under\r\nthe strong opinion that as government in India becomes more and more\r\nParliamentary--as will be the inevitable result--so it will become less\r\npaternal and less beneficial to the poorer classes of the population.\"\r\nIt was seen that these Councils were merely by way of handing over the\r\nIndia we have made to a tiny section of privileged classes whom we were\r\nto keep in power and support with our bayonets.  It was seen and\r\ndisregarded.  Why?\r\n\r\nSo much for its constitution.  Every principle that experience shows\r\nmust go to the making of a successful Assembly has been scorned.  The\r\nrepresentation, even such as it is, is by class, by race, and by\r\nreligion.  No assembly where such a method of representation has been\r\nadopted has ever been known.  Wherever, even in a small degree, such\r\ndifferences have existed it has paralysed all action.  Take, for\r\ninstance, the French National Assembly before the Revolution.  Imagine\r\na House of Commons with members for landowners, for the merchants of\r\nLondon and Glasgow, and special members for the Catholic Irish in\r\nEngland and Scotland.  Even that would be far less extraordinary than\r\nthe Council of India.\r\n\r\nThis Council has no executive powers, but it can ask questions: it can\r\ndiscuss the Budget though it cannot make alterations; it can make laws\r\naffecting all India.  But all it does is subject to veto by the\r\nGovernment of India--and naturally so.  How could you delegate real\r\npower to a Council which, the English officials apart, has no\r\nrepresentative value of any kind and no administrative experience?  The\r\npower behind the Government is the power of England--the Army, the\r\nNavy, and the wealth of England.  It is administered by British\r\nofficials, and even the native army is officered by English officers.\r\nIs this great English organism to be used for enforcing laws passed by\r\nsuch a Council as that I have described?  To be at its mercy, to be its\r\nservant?  Does it enter into the possibility of things?\r\n\r\nThe Council, the officials apart, is in reality at its very best\r\nadvisory only.  It cannot be more.  It has no power behind it and could\r\nbe given no responsibility.  Yet without the fear of responsibility\r\nwhat advice is ever well given?  Irresponsible advisers!  Of what value\r\nhave they ever been in the world's history?\r\n\r\n\"But\"--I have been told and have read often enough--\"the Council works\r\nwell, it is a success, it has gratified the educated Indian.  Why\r\ncriticise it, then?\"  To that I reply, \"In what has its success\r\nconsisted--what has it done?\"  And to that I never get any answer\r\nexcept that it is a success because it has done nothing.  The speakers\r\nwere afraid, apparently, it might try to do something--to express, for\r\ninstance, some of the desires and needs of the people, a few of which I\r\nhave tried to explain in this book; to suggest some new policy to\r\nGovernment, to show how the great and increasing unrest might be guided\r\ninto safe channels; and it has been a success because it has done none\r\nof these things and was capable of doing none of them.  It has been as\r\nan influence _nil_.  All it has done has been empty criticism.  A\r\nwriter trying to praise it says: \"The debates in the Imperial Council\r\nare already not unworthy of older and more famous assemblies.\"  If the\r\ncomparison is with the House of Commons it is not inapt.  For many\r\nyears now debates there have been merely a pretence.  The conclusions\r\nare already fixed and the speakers know it.  They speak to pass time,\r\nto satisfy the electors that they are really doing something to justify\r\ntheir existence, and they try to show off--or to score off someone\r\nelse.  Their speeches have no value.  They make no difference to the\r\nresult.  And the debates in the India Council are no different.  It\r\nperhaps gives the members the illusion of power and authority to be\r\nable to badger Government and make long speeches, but it can effect\r\nnothing.  The debates are make-believe.  How should they be anything\r\nelse?  The men are not to blame, but the institution.\r\n\r\n\"But\"--again say its advocates--\"this is but a beginning.  The Council\r\nis but in embryo.  Wait till it comes to greater maturity.\"\r\n\r\nTo what greater maturity can it come?  Is there in this Council any\r\ntrue idea that can expand and grow?  There is no idea at all.  Is it\r\never contemplated to make it really representative?  How many members\r\nwould it take to represent three hundred millions of people?  On the\r\nBritish basis, not a liberal one, it would require an assembly of over\r\nfour thousand five hundred members.  Is that possible?\r\n\r\nIs any election possible among the masses of the people?\r\n\r\nIs it ever possible that real executive or legislative power should be\r\ngiven to an assembly when it is the English Government and the English\r\npeople who in the last resort would have to carry out those orders and\r\nbear the brunt of their failure?\r\n\r\nThink over the facts carefully.  Could you make a central Parliament to\r\ngovern all Europe?  No.  For a hundred reasons the idea is impossible.\r\nIt is equally impossible in India.  It is even more impossible in India\r\nthan it would be in Europe.\r\n\r\nFinally it is said that this Council has satisfied the educated class\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nHas it?\r\n\r\nAnd if it had could there be a greater criterion of its worthlessness\r\nthan such satisfaction?\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the Burma Provincial Council.  There is no Executive\r\nCouncil, all executive power lies with the Lieut.-Governor.  The\r\nLegislative Council consists of seventeen members.\r\n\r\nOne member is elected by the Chamber of Commerce, and the other sixteen\r\nare nominated.  Of these sixteen, six may be officials; two experts may\r\nbe official or non-official; the rest must be non-official; of these,\r\nfour must be Burmese, one must be Chinese, and one must be Indian.\r\n\r\nThe Council has power to enact local legislation for Burma only.  That\r\nis to say it can pass special or local laws.  It cannot, of course,\r\ninterfere with or vary the Imperial legislation, such as the Indian\r\nPenal Codes.  Its powers are small and are limited.  It is, as will be\r\nseen, representative of nothing.  Except the officials, none of the\r\nmembers have any administrative knowledge; none are known to the people\r\nat large even by name.  That they approved or passed any Act modifying,\r\nsay, the Burmese law of inheritance, would be no justification for it\r\nbefore the people.  They represent neither people nor ideas.  They have\r\neffected nothing and can effect nothing because they have no force\r\nbehind them.  What have any of them ever done that the people should\r\nrepose confidence in them?\r\n\r\nFor the rest the same criticisms apply as to the Indian Council.  The\r\nLieut.-Governor has all the executive power and he has the power of\r\nveto over all legislation.  Naturally he must have this power.  If not,\r\nhe might be forced into using British power and authority and means for\r\nenforcing Acts that he disapproved of and were passed by men who\r\nrepresented at best not one thousandth part of the country.\r\n\r\nYet, as long as he has this power of veto, the Council, like the Indian\r\nCouncil, becomes simply an advisory Council with no responsibility.\r\nAnd, again, of what value is advice that is not steadied by the sense\r\nof responsibility?\r\n\r\nAnd with all this talk of self-government, of an Imperial Indian\r\nParliament and local parliaments, of election and representation, there\r\nis in no village in the Indian Empire any self-government at all, even\r\nin the smallest matters.  The villages are one and all under the rule\r\nof a Government official, and every vestige of self-government has been\r\ndestroyed.  India may have representatives in the India Council and a\r\nvoice, even if an impotent voice, in Imperial matters, but it may have\r\nno representation in its Village Council, and no voice in the smallest\r\nvillage concern.\r\n\r\nThe whole base on which any self-government could rest has been\r\ndestroyed.  And instead of building up from below a system of\r\nself-government that would proceed from the people and be so founded as\r\nto stand any shocks, it is sought to begin self-government from the\r\ntop, by suspending in the air Councils that rest on nothing, that mean\r\nnothing, that have as much solidity and reality as kites would have.\r\n\r\nThis, too, must have been foreseen, because it is obvious.  Why, then,\r\nwas it done?\r\n\r\nWas there ever in any history a _reductio ad absurdum_ like these\r\nCouncils of Despair?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN AS CIVILIAN\r\n\r\nThe next measure which has insistently been pressed on the Government\r\nis that far more Indians should be admitted to the Civil Service.  It\r\nis now composed almost exclusively of Englishmen, and the conditions\r\nare such that it is difficult for Indians to enter.  This, it is\r\nclaimed, should be altered, and the Civil Service should be to a great\r\nextent Indianised.\r\n\r\nWell, as I have said, the Government of India is not Indian, it is\r\nEnglish.  It is essentially English, the more so and the more\r\nnecessarily so because it is in India.  It consists of very few members\r\ncompared to the work it has to do, and it is of the highest importance\r\ntherefore that it be completely efficient.  England has made herself\r\nresponsible for India, and she cannot shirk or divide this\r\nresponsibility.  She cannot say: \"I will by admitting a few Indians\r\ninto the service shift some of the responsibility onto them and so onto\r\nIndia.\"  That is unthinkable.  The Government of India is English, and\r\nuntil by revolution or devolution it disappears it must remain English.\r\nIt is the Army and Navy of England which ensure India's safety.\r\nTherefore her first duty, not only to herself but to India, is to\r\nenlist in her superior service such men as will govern most efficiently.\r\n\r\nNow to govern efficiently we must govern in our own way.  There are not\r\nfor us nor any people two ways of doing a thing well; there is one way\r\nonly possible at the time--one way in which the genius of the governing\r\nrace can best express itself.  That is the one we must follow, and to\r\nensure its success we must have in the service men who are not merely\r\nby education, but by what is far more important, by instinct, best\r\nfitted to carry out the ideas of government.  You must have officers\r\nwho will know what to do not only when they are told, but when they are\r\nnot told, who, being one in race and feeling with the Government, will\r\ninstinctively do all in accordance with it.\r\n\r\nFor it must never be forgotten that the government of India is a very\r\ndifficult matter, and will always be so.  It is not plain-sailing, like\r\nthe Local Government of any self-governing people, or even of Russia.\r\nThe administration of India is alien.  The system is alien; and though\r\nit need not be so much out of touch with the people as it is now, alien\r\nit must remain.  As long as the government is alien the machinery must\r\nbe so.  Englishmen could not work machinery they did not understand.\r\n\r\nEven in self-governed countries there is always a feeling against\r\ngovernment.  Taxes are hard things to bear.  This is shown in socialism\r\nand many other ways.  But in an alien-governed country like India this\r\ndiscontent is much greater.  Government has not only to bear the blame\r\nfor its own faults, but has to vicariously suffer for the shortcomings\r\nof the monsoons and the inroad of plague.  It is responsible, in the\r\npeople's ideas, for everything.  The internal peace which is taken for\r\ngranted in most European countries cannot be so assumed in India.  We\r\nare very often within measurable distance of riot, and an unchecked\r\nriot may quickly develop into an insurrection.  The first essential,\r\ntherefore, of government is the maintenance of peace and the immediate\r\nsuppression of any symptom of unrest.\r\n\r\nNow the forces at the disposal of the authorities are not large.  For\r\nthe whole province of Burma, as large as France and England, and with a\r\nthousand miles of wild frontier and ten millions of people, there are\r\nonly four British and eight Indian regiments.  There are, or were,\r\nbesides (I have not the latest figures) some ten thousand military\r\npolice, who are men recruited in India and officered by English\r\nofficers from Indian regiments.  The Burmese police are only for civil\r\nduty and detection.  They are not for \"keeping the peace\" purposes.\r\nFor the whole of India there are but 70,000 British troops and 140,000\r\nnative for a population of 350,000,000, with a difficult and turbulent\r\nfrontier.  There is manifestly no margin to waste; the resources\r\navailable must be used with the utmost efficiency.  There must be\r\ndirect understanding and co-operation between the military officers who\r\ncommand the forces and the District Officers who supply the\r\ninformation, the intelligence and the direction.  Now if the District\r\nOfficer were an Indian this could not be.  It is no reflection on\r\neither the courage or the capacity of the Indian to say this, for the\r\nquality necessary is neither of these.  It is one which he does not and\r\ncannot have, but which is essential for the proper carrying out of his\r\nduties.  It is _camaraderie_ with the other officers.\r\n\r\nOfficial relations between civil and military are always difficult.  It\r\nis impossible to lay down hard and fast rules defining their respective\r\nresponsibilities.  There is a certain antagonism between the objects\r\neach wishes to attain and the way to attain them.  The civilian wishes\r\nas far as possible to avoid bloodshed; to soothe, not irritate, nor\r\nthreaten.  Fighting is the last thing he wants.  The soldier, on the\r\nother hand, wants to get at his enemy and have it over; to stir him up\r\nif he be not already stirred up enough.  He wishes action that is\r\nshort, sharp, and decisive.  The civilian is long-suffering.  Therefore\r\ndisagreements arise, and that these conflicts of official opinion\r\nshould be minimised, something more is necessary than that the men on\r\nboth sides be good officers.  They must be friends.  The rubs of\r\nofficial intercourse must be effaced over the mess-table, the\r\ncard-table, the camp fire; must be forgotten in talks of home, of\r\nmutual friends.  How often has it not happened that it has been the\r\nmutual appreciation of a poet, the remembrance of a charming woman, the\r\nadmiration of an opera, that has rendered possible that co-operation\r\nwhich is the soul of work.  There must be the continual consciousness\r\non both sides that theirs is not a temporary official relationship.\r\nThey will meet continually hereafter at other stations, at\r\nhead-quarters, at dinners, races, clubs--in the East and at home.  They\r\nmust be friends all through; there must be a mutual understanding.\r\n\r\nNow if the civilian were an Indian gentleman all this could not occur.\r\nThat Indians are often honourable and cultured gentlemen I know; that\r\nin essence all humanity is one I am never tired of affirming.  But\r\nthere are differences of race, real differences, important differences,\r\ndifferences that the Indian himself should be the last to try to\r\nignore.  Every nation is given by nature the qualities peculiar to it\r\nand which it is its duty to cultivate for the world's sake.  To attempt\r\nto sink your individuality in that of another is an injury not only to\r\nyourself but to the whole world.  An Indian gentleman cannot be an\r\nEnglishman.  It is no use his trying.  He only makes himself absurd.\r\nHe can be something quite as good if he will cultivate his own talent;\r\nbut he has not our talent.  He is not an Englishman, and only an\r\nEnglishman by birth has that _camaraderie_ with other Englishmen that\r\nis essential.  Even a Frenchman or a German would not have it.\r\nTherefore it would be impossible to place Indian civilians in places\r\nwhere co-operation with military or military police-officers would be\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is not the English officers alone who create the\r\ndifficulty.  It is the men--English and native.  Men of fighting races\r\nin India will not acknowledge the authority of Indians of other\r\nnationalities, even if supported by Government.\r\n\r\nI will tell a story in illustration.\r\n\r\nI was stationed nearly twenty years ago at a district head-quarters in\r\nBurma where there was a battalion of Military Police recruited in Upper\r\nIndia.  There was also a young Mohammedan civilian who had passed into\r\nthe Civil Service in London and been posted to Burma.  He was an\r\nexcellent fellow in his way.\r\n\r\nIt happened one morning that I rode down to the Battalion Commandant's\r\nhouse to see him on some matter.  We discussed our business, and after\r\nit was finished the Subadar of the battalion, a great soldierly Sikh,\r\ncame in.  He and the Commandant talked for a while, and when he was\r\nleaving E. said:\r\n\r\n\"By the by, Subadar Sahib, we are coming up this evening to the range\r\nto do a little firing.  Send up the marker and four rifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Four_ rifles?\" queried the Subadar.\r\n\r\nE. nodded.\r\n\r\n\"For whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the four Sahibs,\" said E.\r\n\r\nThe Subadar counted.  \"The Deputy Sahib, Huzoor (E.), Hall Sahib, and\r\nwho else?'\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said he, \"Mahommed V. Sahib,\" naming the Indian civilian.\r\n\r\nThe Subadar turned away with a gesture of scorn.\r\n\r\n\"A sahib? he?\" he growled.\r\n\r\nNow suppose this Indian civilian had grown up into charge of a district\r\nand had to direct or go with these men into action?  What would happen?\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that matters could be so arranged that civilians who\r\nwere Indians were not posted to troublesome or frontier districts, or\r\nthat they were given judicial and not executive appointments.  They\r\nmake, it is said, good judges.  Why keep them out of duties they do\r\nwell?\r\n\r\nBut have those who advocate this ever considered what it would mean?\r\nIt would be the creation of a class within a class.  The civilian who\r\nwas an Indian would be differentiated from the English civilians; he\r\nwould be ear-marked as \"not for executive duties.\"  Is that a\r\npossibility, and if it were, would not this differentiation be worse\r\nthan entirely excluding them?  The _corps d'élite_ would still remain\r\nEnglish and the grievance be where it is.\r\n\r\nLet us look facts in the face.  The Civil Service of India is a\r\npeculiarly English service; it is efficient exactly in so far as it is\r\nEnglish; when Indians enter it they must be inefficient more or less.\r\nNot only are they not good for the service, but the service is not good\r\nfor them.  They would be better and happier out of it, and they feel\r\nthat themselves.  They have gained their ambition and regret it all\r\ntheir lives.  I have known several Indians who were civilians and all\r\nwere unhappy.  One was very much so.  This is his story.  It all\r\nhappened a long time ago now, not in Burma, and I do not think any\r\nsusceptibilities can be hurt by recalling it.\r\n\r\nHe was a Madrassi of the race and caste of Chettis, not the\r\nmoney-lending Chettis, but another branch who always seek Government\r\nservice.  His people were well off and he was sent to England to\r\nschool; then to Wren's to study for the Civil Service, into which he\r\npassed high up, and after two years at Oxford he came to Madras and was\r\nposted to a district on the west coast.  He was a nice fellow, clever,\r\nagreeable, and most people liked him.  In England he had been given\r\naccess to good society, and no difference had been made between him and\r\nhis English fellow-students.  He expected it would be the same in\r\nIndia.  He was a member of the Indian Civil Service and would be\r\naccepted as such.\r\n\r\nHe was not.  The first thing that happened was that the Club refused to\r\nadmit him as a member.  Now to the home-staying Englishman this may\r\nseem a small matter.  It is no essential in England to a man's\r\nefficiency, or even to his happiness, that he be member of a social\r\nclub.  It can make no real difference to his career.\r\n\r\nIn India it is different.  The Club in a country station is the centre\r\nof everything.  Practically every European belongs to it.  He does not\r\ngo occasionally, but every day.  At five o'clock, when Courts and\r\noffices close, there is a general resort to the Club, for golf, tennis,\r\ncards, billiards.  Most clubs have a women's wing as well, so that the\r\nwhole of society is centred in the Club.  It is there that matters are\r\narranged and informally discussed.  Work is done at Court, but the\r\npreliminaries of work are often arranged at the Club; or, if not, the\r\nannoyances of work are there removed.  You forget over a drink and a\r\ncigar what happened between you at Court.  Women, too, use their\r\ninfluence at the Club, and women's influence is never negligible.  The\r\nClub is the real heart of the station's life, and if a man do not\r\nbelong to it he is outside the organism, so to speak.  I am quite sure\r\nthat no senior officer would do his work if he were outside the Club,\r\nand even a junior officer would find it difficult.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to elect Chetty to the Club.  The other officials\r\nstood by him loyally, but it was no use.  The unofficial Englishmen\r\nrefused to allow an Indian to be a member of the Club.  Now it is no\r\nuse characterising such exclusiveness as wrong, or mischievous, or\r\nnarrow, and saying it should not exist.  It does exist.  It always will\r\nexist.  It is very strong, and it is based on instincts that are good\r\nin themselves and cannot be ignored.  Club life is only possible to\r\npeople of one nationality.  You cannot mix in a Club.  In Rangoon do\r\nnot the Germans have their own club?\r\n\r\nThe unofficials threatened if Chetty were proposed to overwhelm him\r\nwith black-balls, and so his name had to be withdrawn.  I may say I do\r\nnot think his nominal admission as a member would have made much\r\ndifference.  Merely allowing a man to enter a club does not admit him\r\nto the intimacy of the Club, and that alone counts.  However, Chetty\r\nwas refused admittance at all.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, other troubles.  An Indian who has entered the\r\nCivil Service is really in an impossible position.  Socially he belongs\r\nto no world.  He has left his own and cannot enter the other.  And you\r\ncannot divorce social life from official life.  They are not two\r\nthings, but one.  In the end Chetty shot himself.  It was a sad end for\r\na man gifted and likeable.\r\n\r\nAnd although such an end was unusual, the causes which led to it are\r\nuniversal.  I have known several civilians who were Indians, and, as I\r\nsaid before, I think they were all unhappy.  They felt that fate had\r\nput them in an impossible position.  If they married their\r\nfellow-country-women they by this act divorced themselves still further\r\nfrom European society; if they married an Englishwoman they did no\r\nbetter; the other Englishwomen would not receive her, and inherent\r\ndifferences of civilisation rendered married life difficult.  I think\r\nthat if individuals realised what their ambition would lead to they\r\nwould choose any other walk in life than to enter an alien service.\r\nTheir ideals are wrong.  It is no true ideal for an Indian or Burmese\r\nto wish to be an Englishman.  Fate has allotted to him a different\r\nfield of usefulness quite as great in its way.  An Indian gentleman may\r\nbe quite as true a gentleman as an English gentleman and be not in the\r\nleast like him.  By blind imitation they attempt to attain virtues not\r\ninherent in them, and they ignore other virtues which are inherent and\r\nnecessary to the world.  They seek after impossibilities and so\r\nnegative the achievement of possibilities.  They deny their own natures.\r\n\r\nIt may be that this desire of Indians to enter the Civil Service has\r\narisen from the desire to begin local self-government--a proper\r\nambition.  But the end cannot be attained in this way.  Like all other\r\nedifices, local self-government is built up from below.  It is built on\r\nits own foundation.  You cannot begin replacing an edifice by removing\r\nthe top or middle stones and replacing them with others.\r\nSelf-government is not to be attained by gradually altering the roof.\r\n\r\nTherefore the claim that they would influence Government is untenable.\r\nGovernment must do its work in its own way, and that is the English\r\nway.  No Indian can tell what this is.\r\n\r\nThe further claim that it would satisfy the people is equally\r\nuntenable.  To put a native of one part of India over natives of\r\nanother part of India would not please them; it would exasperate them.\r\nAnd even to put an official over his own people would not please those\r\nunder him, though it might please his class.  This is a well-known\r\nfact; and if you look below the surface it is not difficult to see the\r\nreasons.  The Government is English; a native official is not English.\r\nThe people have no confidence in him for that reason.  They know that\r\nhe is not in intimate touch with Government.  In the innumerable acts\r\nof official life which are not bound by rigid rules he is very likely\r\nto be wrong.  When an English official says a thing they know he speaks\r\nwith authority because his mind is one with that of Government; not so\r\nwith a native official.  They know it and he knows it, and he knows\r\nthey know it.  That makes matters difficult to begin with.  Moreover,\r\nthey are jealous of him.  When all high officials are English, natives\r\nare all together; put a native in as an official, and to the general\r\nnative mind he is rather like a traitor.  They have lost him and gained\r\nnothing.  They are not proud of him but angry with him.  He is as they\r\nare--why then should he have this power over them?  It is not a power\r\ndelegated by themselves but by an alien Government.  This is quite a\r\nsimple fact in psychology and shows itself everywhere.  Does a\r\n\"ranker,\" unless under exceptional circumstances and an exceptional\r\npersonality, hold the same authority over his former equals as a class\r\nofficer does?  And there the difference is slight.  I am sure that no\r\ngreater cause for discontent among the people could be found than by\r\nhaving Indians as civilians.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not the least, there is the domiciled European population\r\nto be considered.  What effect would it have on them if a large number\r\nof Indians were admitted to the administration?  The answer is quite\r\nsimple and was effectually given during the agitation over the Ilbert\r\nBill in 1885--they would not stand it.\r\n\r\nThey are not too pleased with the present state of affairs, with the\r\ngreat power that lies in one man's hand, that of the head of the\r\ndistrict.  They chafe at it and are continually feeling and resenting\r\nits imperfections and limitations.  They only submit to it because they\r\nsee no way out of it and because he is English.  Were he to be often an\r\nIndian they would resent it and make their resentment felt.  They would\r\nlose the feeling of security they now have and they would not submit to\r\nthis; they would make government impossible.  To those who doubt their\r\npower to do this I would recommend a study of the agitation against the\r\nIlbert Bill, more especially in its latest stages.  It is no longer\r\nsecret history that a disaster unequalled in Indian history was only\r\nsaved at the last minute by the surrender of Government.\r\n\r\nAnd the feelings which caused this are as vital now as then.  It may be\r\ntaken as an axiom that whatever Government might decree, the great\r\nBritish mercantile and other interests in India would refuse to allow\r\nany appreciable transfer of authority to the hands of Indians, and in\r\nface of their opposition it could not be done.  That an Indian should\r\nrule Indians they would not mind perhaps, but that an Indian should\r\nrule Europeans, and that it should be to an Indian they looked for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and order and for the administration of justice,\r\ncriminal and civil, is unthinkable.  The stability of the\r\nadministration is due to its being English, and any threat to that\r\nstability would not be borne.\r\n\r\nBesides, to what would it lead?  Suppose, by a wild stretch of the\r\nimagination, all the Civil Service in India could be composed of\r\nIndians, what then?  That is not self-government.  The orders would\r\nstill come from Downing Street, the responsibility rest with Parliament\r\nand the English people.  The Government would not and could not so be\r\nIndianised; all that would have happened would be that a few hundred\r\nIndian gentlemen had been imperfectly Anglicised.  Is that an ideal?\r\nWhere would the three hundred and fifty million come in?  No more than\r\nthey do now.  But in any self-government worth the name these people\r\nmust come in; they must be the base on which the self-government is\r\nerected.\r\n\r\nGovernment does not see its way.  It must do something, and it has no\r\nidea what to do.  A wise statesmanship would hold its hand till it saw\r\nclearly.  But there is the danger that a hasty statesmanship may in\r\ndespair do something for the mere sake of saying it is not standing\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThere is a way out of the present trouble, but I think it can be seen\r\nclearly enough that admitting Indians to the Civil Service is not that\r\nway.  It might, in fact, be a very serious obstacle to following the\r\nright course.\r\n\r\nIndia is lost, and will be regained by no such measures as those\r\nproposed.  They will only deepen the gulf and accelerate the final\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nA NEW INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CIVILIAN\r\n\r\nIndia may be regained.  How could that be done?\r\n\r\nThe first point is the _personnel_ of the Indian Civil Service, which\r\nholds all important offices in India, forms the Government, and fills\r\nmost of the places on the Indian Council at home.\r\n\r\nIt depends, as I have said, for its success not upon the ability, but\r\non the personality of its members.  India was achieved by personality\r\nand successfully governed by personality.  It is personality alone that\r\nhumanises rule and makes it tolerable, that stands between the people\r\nand rigid law, and can create that sentiment which alone binds ruler\r\nand ruled together.\r\n\r\nHow can that necessary personality be restored to it?\r\n\r\nThat this lack of personality does not affect only the Indian Civil\r\nService is a matter of notoriety.  It is exactly what our generals\r\ndeplored after the Boer War--that the ordinary officer had no\r\npersonality.  It is a matter of common remark nowadays how exactly\r\nalike all the young men are, echoing sentiments that are not theirs.\r\nIt is what the Germans say of us and the Americans, who especially\r\nadmire and try to cultivate personality.  We once stood before the\r\nworld as a nation of personalities.  We do so no longer.\r\n\r\nTo what is this due?  Not to natural deficiency, because all children\r\nabound in personality.  It is due to what is called \"education.\"  That\r\ntoo is no new discovery of mine, but a matter of common knowledge and\r\npublicity.  Read, for instance, Harold Gorst's _The Curse of\r\nEducation_.  In Paine's _Life of Mark Twain_, systematic training is\r\ncalled \"a blight.\"  Neither is it a new thing.  The Duke of Wellington\r\nsaid Waterloo was won in the playing-fields of Eton--not in the\r\nschools, be it noted.  Yet in those days education was nothing like so\r\nrigid as it is now.  Then take the notable Englishmen of the last fifty\r\nyears; how few have been University men--many not public school men.\r\nCobden and Bright, Chamberlain, Beaconsfield, Dickens and Kipling,\r\nStanley, Captain Scott, and other pioneers of Empire, Huxley and\r\nKelvin, all the great captains of industry.  The two most prominent\r\nmembers of the Government to-day are not University men.  Even where\r\nnotable men were University men they did not attain their stature till\r\nthey had thrown off its bonds.  Gladstone was, for instance, the hope\r\nof the stern, unbending Tories till he had achieved his liberty, when\r\nhe could think for himself.  Yet even then he only achieved political,\r\nand never spiritual, freedom.  Cecil Rhodes said that University dons\r\nwere as children in some matters; meaning, however, ignorant and not\r\nready to learn, which is not a child's attitude.\r\n\r\nTherefore the fault lies with the \"education.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is Education?\r\n\r\nThere are two things that go to the proper upbringing of a child, and\r\nthough they overlap in places they are distinct and even sometimes\r\ncontradictory; one is Instruction, and the other is Education.\r\n\r\nReading and writing, arithmetic, and all information obtained from\r\nbooks or lectures or teachers is instruction; the bringing out of the\r\npowers of the child's own mind is education.  The object of instruction\r\nis to enable the child to better his education.  In itself it has no\r\nvalue.  The mere acquirements of reading and writing--the mere\r\naccumulation of book knowledge--are in themselves worthless.  \"The\r\nlearned fool is the biggest fool.\"  They are only good insomuch as they\r\nhelp education.\r\n\r\nWhat is education?  It is the drawing out of a child's mind so that it\r\ncan see life as it is, not a mere mass of phenomena, but a consequence\r\nof underlying causes; it is the exercising of his faculties of right\r\njudgment to meet events as they arise; it is an ability to gauge\r\nhimself and others.  Education is the cultivation of personality.  It\r\nis to the child what careful gardening is to the tree--a help to growth\r\nso that it can develop its potentiality.  The gardener helps each tree\r\nto put forth that essential quality of its own that differentiates it\r\nfrom all other trees and makes it a thing of use and beauty to the\r\nworld.  It is not a reduction to a common type or the standardisation\r\nof growth, because while the tree must harmonise with the rest of the\r\ngarden it must have an individuality of its own.\r\n\r\nThat is education, and that alone is education.  Instruction is simply\r\nproviding the necessary food for growth, or giving the necessary\r\nweapons or implements to obtain that food.  All instruction that does\r\nnot directly tend to nourish personality is worse than waste--it\r\noccupies nerve and energy that are wanted for better things.\r\n\r\nThis is simple enough, yet the world is full of fallacies on the\r\nsubject.  Here is one from a well-known writer: \"How can you draw out\r\nof a child a love for clean collars, Greek accents, the date of\r\nBannockburn, or how to eat asparagus.\"\r\n\r\nWell, you can only draw out a child's love for these things by helping\r\nhim to see that the acquisition of them is a step towards a result the\r\nchild desires to reach.  Now Greek accents are only useful to a child\r\nwho wishes to become a Greek tutor, and the date of Bannockburn is\r\nuseful to no one because it can always be looked up if necessary;\r\ntherefore no children have a taste for the latter, and not one in a\r\nthousand for the former.  They are not education at all, and even as\r\ninstruction they are worthless.  A love of clean collars and how to eat\r\nasparagus can be drawn out of children by simply making them realise\r\nthat unless they have their love for these things they will expose\r\nthemselves to ridicule or contempt for no good purpose.  For be it\r\nnoted that until you do awaken this self-respect you will not get a\r\nchild to put on clean collars enthusiastically, or be careful about\r\nasparagus.  Instruction in such matters is useless--you must have\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThe man or woman properly educated will desire the right things, and\r\nwill seek the right way of attaining these things.  His actions will\r\nspring from a real living force within him.  But if you teach him to do\r\nthings because he is told or because it is the custom, you injure his\r\npersonality; and as there is no driving force in a law or a custom,\r\nwhich are bonds, you confine him, whereas you should free him.  It is\r\nan admission that he must not or cannot think for himself, but must\r\nblindly follow custom.  It is true that he must, not only in boyhood\r\nbut all through his life, yield obedience in act to persons,\r\ngovernments, or rules; but he must not do so blindly.  It is a\r\nprincipal part of education to make the boy see for himself that such\r\nsubordination of act is necessary to the progress of the world, because\r\nas individuals we can accomplish no great thing; then he will do it\r\nwillingly, knowing its necessity.  But it is equally necessary that the\r\nboy never subordinate his judgment to others, because any rule made\r\nabsolute is death to progress, and there is no authority, nor rule, nor\r\nconvention that should not be broken sometimes; and as time goes on all\r\nmust be modified, changed, and relaxed; the ideal of education being\r\nthat all authority will become unnecessary, as people will desire what\r\nis right, and do it _proprio moto_.  The truth will have made them free.\r\n\r\nNow seeing this difference, how much education is there in school or\r\ncollege?  In the classrooms there is none.  All that is given in\r\nclasses is instruction, which may be useful or detrimental inasmuch as\r\nit helps personality or not.  Usually it is detrimental, because it\r\nsubstitutes \"authority\" for insight.  The child must accept something,\r\nnot because he is helped to see that it is true, but because \"somebody\r\nsays so.\"  Thus his personality is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe only education he gets is in the playing-fields.  There he learns\r\nto keep his temper, play the game, and co-operate, of his volition,\r\nwith others to a desired end.\r\n\r\nThat is a valuable training, but it does not go very far.  He is never\r\ntaught to see life as it is for himself.  On the contrary, he is\r\nforbidden to do so.\r\n\r\nAnd this continues now till the age of twenty-two or twenty-three, so\r\nthat by the time it is over the most receptive period of life is past.\r\nBacon went to the University at thirteen, and left it at sixteen as he\r\nfound it had no more to teach him.\r\n\r\nFurther, until some thirty or forty years ago a father considered that\r\nhe owed some duty to his son--to help him, to lead him, to initiate him\r\ninto life.\r\n\r\nNo one can do this but a father.  No one can understand his son like a\r\nfather and know what it is necessary for him to learn; to no one will\r\nthe son listen, or confide in, as his father.  But nowadays I notice\r\nthat fathers have abdicated.  They consider their duty fulfilled if\r\nthey pay for the boy's schooling, and everything is left to the\r\nschoolmaster.  Many fathers that I know are quite stranger to their\r\nsons.  Mothers, on the contrary, strive more and more to obtain\r\ninfluence over their sons and bring them up in the principles of women.\r\nBut a man must be a man or be nothing.\r\n\r\nThere is another and very considerable difference between schools now\r\nand the schools of sixty years ago and before.  In the earlier period\r\nthe schoolmasters were rarely clergymen; now they are practically\r\nalways so; and not only that, but boys nowadays are far more under\r\ncontrol and influence of their masters than they were.\r\n\r\nNow whatever good points may be claimed for Church teaching by those\r\nwho believe in it, there will, I think, be no difficulty about the\r\nadmission that the frame of mind, the outlook on the world, of\r\necclesiastics is not suitable for men who have to lead an active life.\r\nIt is, in fact, the very reverse of what a man requires whose first\r\nduty it is to understand the world and to lead the world.  For to the\r\necclesiastic the world is a bad place, it has to be borne as best it\r\ncan, to be condemned not understood, and all effort is directed not to\r\nthis world but to some other.  Moreover, the habit of thought of\r\necclesiastics is fixed.  They believe that not only is truth absolute,\r\nbut that they possess it or some of it; the very foundation-rock of\r\ntheir belief is authority, and freedom of thought is disliked by them\r\nas subversive of their tenets.  Their principal qualities are those of\r\nsubmission, patience and obedience, not merely in act but in thought.\r\n\r\nNow boys are apt to imitate their masters, and however secular a course\r\nof education may be, if it be given by ecclesiastics the boys are\r\ncertain to be a great deal influenced by their master's outlook on\r\nlife.  That accounts for much of the pessimism that is observable, for\r\nthe \"unnatural mildness\" of the modern young man.  If you keep a boy\r\nunder ecclesiastical habits of thought till he is twenty-three, how can\r\nhe ever escape into the fresh air of free inquiry?  How will he ever\r\nlove the world instead of despising it?  And no good work was ever done\r\nexcept by men who loved the world; and love comes from understanding,\r\nnot from aloofness.\r\n\r\nA boy's education should be directed from an early age towards the work\r\nhe is to perform in life.  What department of the public service is now\r\nheld to be the best served?  Is it not the Navy?  And naval officers\r\nare caught young and trained _ad hoc_; not a narrow professional\r\ntraining, but none the less a training with an object.  The present\r\ntraining of Indian civilians up till twenty-three is objectless, and\r\ntherefore inefficient.  That in the Army the special training is begun\r\nmuch later may account for the complaints of army officers wanting\r\npersonality compared with naval officers.\r\n\r\nWith engineers and all specialised work the training begins young.\r\n\r\nBut the Indian civilian is ecclesiastically trained till he is\r\ntwenty-three.  Then he has to learn his work.  Could there be a greater\r\nabsurdity?\r\n\r\nWhat then should be done?\r\n\r\nIn the first place he should be caught young.  The work of the Indian\r\ncivilian is as important to England as that of the sailor; it is even\r\nmore specialised and difficult.  He should be trained for it from\r\nfourteen or thereabouts, not from twenty-three.\r\n\r\nIt should be determined what special qualities are necessary for a good\r\nIndian civilian.  I think some of them are obvious enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good physique and a liking for sport.\r\n\r\nGood manners and a knowledge of etiquette.\r\n\r\nDiscipline in act.\r\n\r\nFreedom and courage in thought.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of life and humanity as they are round him.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us consider these.\r\n\r\nThat physical fitness is the first necessity all will allow.  The\r\nclimate is severe and takes a great deal out of him, especially in the\r\nhot weather; there must be exposure in the districts; the work is hard\r\nand difficult, and makes great demands upon the physique.  Therefore\r\nthe physique must be good.\r\n\r\nAnd a medical certificate of soundness is no guarantee of this.  A man\r\nmay be medically quite sound and yet so prostrated by the heat as to\r\nfind his temper and his work affected.  His physique lies at the base\r\nof all his work, and must be good.  Nothing is now done to secure this;\r\nno investigation has ever been made as to the type that endures heat\r\nthe best.  Yet undoubtedly there is such a type.  In that extraordinary\r\nbook, _A Modern Legionary_, it is pointed out that in Tonquin, amongst\r\nthe men of the Legion, a certain type stood the climate better than the\r\nothers.  Whenever any special service had to be performed it was men of\r\na certain sanguine type that were chosen.  Not that they were\r\nphysically stronger or braver than the others, but because even in the\r\ngreatest heat they retained a certain buoyancy of temperament which the\r\ndarker types lost.\r\n\r\nI have myself noticed something of the sort in Burma and India.  Of\r\ncourse mere personal observation of this sort proves nothing, but the\r\nsubject seems to deserve investigation.  That all people do not bear\r\nheat and cold alike is undoubted.  In the Russian campaign of 1812 it\r\nwas the Italians who stood the cold best of all Napoleon's troops.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the cadet should have not merely a sound physique but a buoyant\r\nphysique, and that cannot be ensured under the present system.\r\n\r\nThen he should be made a good sportsman; for the Indian civilian no\r\ntraining is more necessary than this.  I do not mean only a cricketer\r\nor football player; neither of these games is of much use out in the\r\nEast.  I mean a rider who is also fond of horses; a shot who is also\r\ninterested in birds and animals.\r\n\r\nThere is in all sportsmen of this kind a quality which no one else has.\r\nI cannot define it.  It comes, I think, from association with people\r\nout of his own rank in one pursuit, from having to go to them for\r\nknowledge he has not got himself and thereby recognising their value,\r\nfrom a subtle sympathy with nature as not apart from man, nor a setting\r\nfor man, but another manifestation of the same Life that is in man.\r\nNothing is more valuable in enabling a District Officer to keep his\r\nmind sweet.  Official work is all concerned with the faults and\r\nshortcomings of others, wherein you are judge and they are culprits.\r\nOfficial work divides; it insensibly leads you to believe that all men\r\nare liars and robbers, and are trying to deceive you.  Throw it aside,\r\nand go out to shoot, stopping in the villages talking of sport and\r\nvillage affairs, and the whole aspect of life changes.  You wash off\r\nyour priggishness; you cease to imagine yourself first cousin to the\r\nDeity; you return to your humanity, and with the first snipe you miss\r\nto your extreme fallibility.\r\n\r\nThen there is ability at languages.  Now although some men may develop\r\nan excess of ability to learn languages, all people have that ability\r\nto a certain extent when young or they could not learn their own\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nBut it is an ability that quickly departs unless kept alive.  The way\r\nGreek and Latin are taught is a sure way to destroy any ability for\r\nlearning a language a boy may retain.  Grammar should never be taught.\r\nNo child learns its own language by grammar, and, in fact, grammar only\r\napplies to dead languages, not to living.  That has to some extent\r\ndawned on modern educators, but I see that French grammar and regular\r\nand irregular verbs are taught to those learning French.  Did Loti and\r\nMaupassant learn French grammar?  I wonder.  If not, why should anyone\r\nelse?  But schoolmasters are a hard lot, and there is no one who so\r\nabsolutely refuses to learn as he who makes a profession of teaching.\r\nWhy should not Hindustani be made the school language for Indian cadets?\r\n\r\nThen come good manners.  I do not mean only good English manners--those\r\nmanners which enable you to pass in a meeting of cultivated English men\r\nand women--but much better manners than those.  They are concerned with\r\nyour conduct to your equals; but the only good manners that will be of\r\nmuch use to you in the East are those deeper manners which are equal to\r\nall occasions and can show an equal courtesy to a ploughman as to a\r\npeer, to an old Subadar hero of a hundred fights, to a headman and to a\r\ncoolie.  Some of it is, of course, convention and must be learned, like\r\nthe right thing to do when an old soldier offers you the hilt of his\r\nsword, or a Burman lady brings you some fruit; but most of it, I think,\r\nsimply comes from a frame of mind.  If you recognise that the common\r\nhumanity that binds you is eternal and that the difference of rank or\r\nrace or age is a temporary difference that will pass, I do not think\r\nyou will quite want for good manners.  Orientals are particular about\r\nmanners, and they do not respect a man who has none, or who has his own\r\nand not theirs.\r\n\r\nDiscipline in act is, I think, enough taught now, but freedom of\r\nthought is woefully to seek.  It is banned by theology, and\r\necclesiastics naturally do not teach it.\r\n\r\nAs to knowledge of life, that can only come in the living.  But it will\r\nnot come unless you find the world worth studying and your own life\r\nworth living.  If this world is bad, then it is not worth study, and if\r\nthe only object of your life here is to fit you or unfit you for life\r\nin some spirit world, then you will not care much to fit yourself for\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would appear too as if civilians should go out to India\r\nmuch younger than they do now.  Twenty-three is far too old to begin a\r\ntotally new life.  For it must be remembered that life in India is a\r\ntotally new life to which men have to get accustomed.  No matter how\r\nyou are trained in England, nothing will enable you to know India but\r\nbeing in India.  The real education cannot begin until the student\r\nlands in the country in which he is to do his life's work.  Everything\r\nhe may learn at home is preliminary only.  Language, people, work have\r\nall to be learned after arriving.  However good the material provided\r\nmay be, it is, when it lands, simply so much raw material.  It has to\r\nlearn everything.  I do not think the age of twenty is at all too young\r\nto begin such a training; in fact I think nineteen would be better.\r\n\r\nBut we are now come to what should be done after arrival in India, and\r\nthat will require a new chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTRAINING IN INDIA\r\n\r\nHaving got the young civilian out to his province he should be\r\nthoroughly trained before being put to work, not given six or nine\r\nmonths to look round and then put to do work he cannot understand.\r\n\r\nIf he came out to India at twenty, he could well afford eighteen months\r\nor two years of real training.\r\n\r\nDuring the cold weather he should be with some District Officer,\r\naccompanying him in camp, observing how he works, getting an insight\r\ninto the mechanism of Government; during the hot weather he should be\r\nin the hills.  By thus keeping him out of the great heat at the\r\nbeginning he would become slowly acclimatised.  Now he is plunged\r\nstraight out from England into the Indian plains.\r\n\r\nAs to the training he should receive, that is not very difficult to\r\nsuggest.  First and foremost comes the language, of which a good\r\ncolloquial knowledge should be required.  It can only be acquired by\r\ntalking to the people.  A teacher is useful to explain difficulties\r\nencountered by a pupil in trying to talk, but no teacher can teach a\r\nlanguage.  In fact, languages cannot be taught--they can be acquired.\r\nThe ability of the ear and vocal organs to recognise and reproduce\r\nstrange sounds comes only with constant practice; and it must be\r\npractice with the people, for educated men talk differently from\r\npeasants in India as elsewhere.  All Acts should be learned by first\r\nclearly understanding the principles that underlie them, the object\r\nsought to attain, and the method by which it is hoped to attain it.\r\nThat is the only way to really understand an Act or Code.  The detailed\r\nknowledge can be filled in later.  In order to enable this to be done\r\nGovernment would have to frame introductions to their Codes and Acts.\r\nAnd such introductions would be most valuable not only to learners but\r\nto Government itself.  Suppose, for instance, an introduction were\r\nwritten to the _Village Manual_ explaining exactly what the village\r\norganism is and that the Act and Rules were intended to preserve and\r\nstrengthen this organism; it would be immediately apparent that as they\r\nare now they really injure and destroy it.  This would lead to a\r\ncomplete recast of the _Manual_--a most necessary work.  And so with\r\nthe other Acts and Rules.  Now they are issued in a perfectly naked\r\nstate that would be almost immodest had they any real life in them.\r\nBut there is never any intention or life manifest, only dead formulæ.\r\nSuch introductions would also be most valuable in keeping an Act up to\r\ndate.  A law may fairly fulfil its intention when issued, but as\r\ncircumstances change it would become obvious that the Act was out of\r\ndate.  If however you don't know the intention of the Act, how are you\r\nto judge its relevancy?\r\n\r\nFurther, such introductions would prevent the abuse of certain\r\nsections.  Did, for instance, the Government of India intend sections\r\n109, 110, of the Criminal Procedure Code to be used as they are in\r\nBurma now?  I doubt it.  But Burma can always say: \"How was I to know\r\nthe intention?  There are the sections.  Why shouldn't I use them as I\r\nthink fit?\"\r\n\r\nHow would the imprisonment sections of the Civil Procedure Code be\r\njustified?  What object are they supposed to attain?  No one knows.  It\r\ncan't be to deter a man from being ruined--that is not necessary; it\r\ncan't be to make him pay--the distraint sections are for that; it can't\r\nbe to render him a better citizen--gaols don't do that.  What are they\r\nfor, then?  To pander to the creditors' desire for vengeance?  It can\r\nonly be that.  I would like to see Government avow it.\r\n\r\nThen the young civilian should get an insight into the customs of the\r\npeople and learn to understand what these customs mean.  Nothing is\r\nmore absurd than the way ceremonies are misinterpreted, not merely by\r\nthe casual observer, but by what is called \"science.\"  A whole theory\r\nof \"marriage by capture\" has been built on ceremonies that are\r\nsymbolical, not of an absurdity like that, but of certain facts of\r\nhuman nature common to all marriages in all periods all over the world.\r\nThe Nairs of Malabar have been credited with the most extraordinary\r\nforms of polyandry on the strength of ceremonies which were adopted as\r\na protection to deceive the Brahmins.  Human nature is, in its\r\nessentials, always the same.  If the learner is helped to look under\r\nceremonies he will see this.  A knowledge of ceremonies has its value,\r\nlike a knowledge of clothes has; but as clothes are used for good\r\nreasons--sometimes to hide the form, sometimes to accentuate parts of\r\nthe form--so are ceremonies.  And ceremonies may and do persist long\r\nafter the human need has left them.\r\n\r\nFurther, he should know something of the economic state of the people.\r\nI think that a District Officer should be acquainted with the principal\r\nindustries of his district, so as to be able to give help if need be.\r\nGenerally speaking, the help he can give is protection from rash\r\ninnovations.  The cultivator neither in India nor in Burma is blind to\r\nhis own interest, nor is he ignorant.  He has behind him an experience\r\nof thousands of years, which have taught him a great deal about the\r\ncapability of crops and soils.  But he is quite willing to learn more,\r\nonly he must make sure first.  He cannot afford to experiment.  His\r\nsystem will give him a living, and a change may mean starvation.  He\r\ncannot run the risk.  Prove to him that a new crop will grow and will\r\nfetch a decent price, and he is eager to cultivate it; but nothing less\r\nthan ocular proof will do.  That is, of course, right.  He has common\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not everyone has so much sense, and there are continual\r\nattempts being made to get him to make experiments he cannot afford.\r\nHe should be protected against these.  I can remember two such\r\nattempted booms in Upper Burma, both engineered by Government--one was\r\ncotton, and one was coffee or tea planting.\r\n\r\nThe cotton boom was very rigorously pressed upon us from England\r\nbecause I believe someone in authority had promised to \"take his coat\r\noff\" to make it succeed.  But Burma is not a good cotton country, and\r\nthe long staple will not grow.  Moreover, if it could be grown with\r\nirrigation it would not pay nearly so well as rice.  Therefore the\r\ncultivator will have none of it.\r\n\r\nTea and coffee planting is only suitable for capitalists, not for\r\npeasants; and as a matter of fact coffee won't grow north of about 12°\r\nnorth latitude.  So these booms fizzled out, but they created a good\r\ndeal of trouble first.\r\n\r\nIndeed, most of my experiences were putting dampers on enthusiasts,\r\nGovernment or other, who wanted something grown, and who were ready to\r\naffirm that if it would not grow it ought to grow and must be made to\r\ngrow, and sell afterwards as well.  I remember a correspondence I had\r\nwith a gentleman in Lower Burma on the subject of a fibre-producing\r\nplant which is grown in small patches near the villages of my district\r\nto serve as string.  This gentleman heard of the plant and wrote to me\r\na glowing account of the future before it, strongly urging me to advise\r\nmy people--nay, to force my people--to grow it in large quantities for\r\nexport.  I wrote back that if he was so interested in the matter he\r\nshould come up to my district and enter into contracts with the\r\nvillagers to grow it for him.  They would, I knew, do it at a certain\r\nprice which I gave, and I offered to help him in every way.  He,\r\nhowever, indignantly refused.  He was not a trader, and the villagers\r\nshould grow it on speculation.  As it happens, I have a considerable\r\nknowledge of fibre plants gained before I entered Government service,\r\nand as I knew there was no certain market for this fibre I let well\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, I think a young officer should learn that it is not\r\nonly for the people's pleasure but for his own pleasure and for the\r\ngood of Government that he should encourage the amusements of the\r\npeople.  Nothing will give him more influence than this, make him\r\nbetter known, or cause his official work to go so easily.\r\n\r\nIt is a continual complaint among the people now that life is so dull.\r\nOur administration has not only taken all the adventure and\r\npicturesqueness out of life, but it has been disastrous to sport.\r\nBoat-racing, for instance, which used to be a great sport all along the\r\nIrrawaddy, is now nearly dead, and amateur dancing troupes which used\r\nto be common in the villages are nearly all defunct.  I believe they\r\nare _all_ dead.  Now this is a disastrous state of things.  Man wants\r\nplay as well as work, and if he can't get amusement he will do things\r\nhe shouldn't.  The principal reason given for this decay is that unless\r\nsome high official will interest himself in sports and give them his\r\nencouragement, no one will get them up.  Therefore, when I was in\r\nSagaing I instituted a regatta in the October holidays.  It was no\r\ntrouble to me.  Directly I said I would like to have races there were\r\nplenty of well-known Burmans ready to do all the work with pleasure and\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe riverside villages caught up the idea.  They pulled out their old\r\nracing canoes and did them up anew.  Crews were put into training, and\r\nfor weeks all the talk was of times and spurts and the merits of this\r\ncrew and that.  Sagaing didn't know itself.\r\n\r\nThe races duly came off in the glorious full-moon week of October, when\r\nall Courts are closed for ten days and everyone has holidays.  Many\r\ncrews came, and their friends and relatives came, and their supporters\r\nand backers, and they brought their wives and sisters with them.  In\r\nthe evenings we had boat races, at night we had pagoda festivals and\r\ndances and illuminations.\r\n\r\nAll went well till the final great event, which was a race between our\r\nchampion boat and a boat sent over from Mandalay to challenge us.\r\n\r\nThere was immense excitement about this because the Mandalay boat was\r\nsaid to be a swagger boat; but then so was ours, a very swagger boat.\r\nMandalay bet on their boat.  Sagaing laid their rupees on the Sagaing\r\nboat; and the banks on both sides the mile-wide river were thronged\r\nwith spectators.  Then a catastrophe occurred.  Just before the race\r\nour steersman was discovered drunk and happy upon the beach.  How this\r\nhappened I don't know.  Why the crew ever allowed him to be separated\r\nfrom them I can't think; and his own explanation threw no clear light\r\non the subject.  He said in self-defence that the enemy in disguise had\r\nlured him into a toddy shop and \"must have hocussed the toddy, for I\r\nonly had a couple of cups, yet see me now,\" and there was great\r\nindignation.  Whether in consequence of his defection or not I don't\r\nknow, but we lost.  Mandalay just romped away from us, and not only\r\nsecured the prize, but was declared to have carried off a \"cart-load\"\r\nof rupees won in bets.\r\n\r\nHowever, notwithstanding that disaster the meeting was a great success,\r\nand now, after ten years, that is the principal event I remember of my\r\nthree years' administration.  It stands out in my memory, and I think\r\nthat probably if the people ever remember me at all it is as the\r\nconvener of the first regatta for many years.\r\n\r\nThere was an amusing sequel to this defeat by Mandalay.  For months\r\nafterwards whenever I had an insolvent case in my Court the debtor\r\nattributed his failure to this race.  The district was \"stony broke\" in\r\nconsequence, at least so the insolvents in my Court said.  The\r\nconversation would run as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Judge_ (myself).  Well, I have read your schedule, and you are\r\nfive hundred rupees out.  How is that?  Explain.\r\n\r\n_Debtor_.  I am a honest man, your Honour, and never in debt before.\r\n\r\n_Myself_.  No doubt.  How did it happen this time?\r\n\r\n_Debtor_.  Well, your Honour will remember that last October your\r\nHonour got up boat races here.\r\n\r\n_Myself_.  Certainly.\r\n\r\n_Debtor_.  And Mandalay sent us a challenge.\r\n\r\n_Myself_.  Well?\r\n\r\n_Debtor_.  Naturally I believed in _our_ boat.  (Note the \"our\"--his\r\nand mine).  I was sure it must win, and for our [his and my] credit I\r\nwagered all I could get on it.\r\n\r\n_Myself_.  Hum!\r\n\r\n_Debtor_.  We lost.\r\n\r\n_Myself_.  There was always a possibility of that.\r\n\r\n_Debtor_ (indignantly).  Not with a fair race.  But they drugged our\r\nsteersman.  I call it a swindle, but I had to pay, and consequently am\r\nnow insolvent and in your Honour's hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas there any truth in this?  There was no truth, of course.  These\r\ndebtors became insolvent through the action of two or three newly\r\narrived firms of money-lenders.  That was clear enough.  Possibly they\r\nhad a rupee or two on the boat race, but that would hardly affect\r\nmatters.  They made this appeal to try to get at me--the man--behind\r\nthe law in which I was encased.  They will do anything to achieve that.\r\nLike all human beings they are terrified at law and want to touch\r\nhumanity, no matter what it does.  They can bear from a man what they\r\ncannot from a law.  This is manifest all through one's official life.\r\nPeople, for instance, will not come to see you in Court, but come to\r\nyour private house.  That is to try to get at the humanity they know\r\nyou possess.  That is what they want--your personality; for it will\r\nunderstand; whereas a law--what can it know of anything?\r\n\r\nThen there are the dancing troupes for girls.  What other amusements\r\nhave girls but these troupes?  They love them.  Many girls have told me\r\nthat it was the practising for the dances which gave a meaning and an\r\ninterest to their girlhood.  It taught them what lessons could never\r\ndo--grace and elocution and style.  It collected the villagers\r\ntogether; it gave a village something to be proud of.  There should be\r\nsuch troupes in all big villages, and when the village system is\r\nrestored there will be no doubt a renaissance of these and other\r\namusements.\r\n\r\nAgain, why should not there be village teams of football?  The Burmans\r\nlike the game immensely, and play it well.  But of course for village\r\nplay the rules would have to be greatly simplified.  They are too\r\nscientific now.  It should be a game.\r\n\r\nThus it seems to me a District Officer should be educated to be the\r\nhead of his district in all ways, not merely its judge or its\r\nschoolmaster.  His other work must be lightened.  Much of the work he\r\ndoes should not be done at all.  All interference with the village\r\nshould cease.  If the suggestions I have to make in a later chapter as\r\nto self-government were adopted, the District Officer would soon feel\r\nthe relief.  He now seeks for work to do.  He should try to avoid work\r\nas much as he can.  \"Don't interfere, except where you must,\" should be\r\nhis rule.  Now it is the other way about.  And Government should regard\r\nhim quite differently from what it does now.  It should trust him, and\r\nnot law.  He must work within law, but not by law.  When he has\r\nsomething to decide he should consider what is the right and proper\r\nthing to do, and then see if he can legally do it.  If not, he must\r\nmodify his order till it is within law.  Now he looks to the law to\r\ntell him what to do.  That is bad.  Laws are bonds, not guides.  They\r\ncannot give you motive force.  They tell you what not to do, and that\r\nis all.\r\n\r\nHe should be trusted far more than he is.  He should not be made to\r\n\"fall into line.\"  He should be judged not by his acts, but by the\r\nresult of his acts, or his refusals to act, that is, by the state of\r\nhis district.  He should not be transferred when it can be helped, but\r\nbe encouraged to make long stays in a district.  He will do so if you\r\ngive him a free hand so that he can take a personal interest in his\r\nwork and people.  The secret of success is personality.\r\n\r\nI think if the young men sent out were trained on these or some such\r\nlines there would soon be a very different feeling between people and\r\nGovernment from what there is now.  There would be a mutual\r\nunderstanding and respect which are now lacking.\r\n\r\nThere is a further suggestion I have to make as regards District\r\nOfficers, not for their training, but for regulating their relations to\r\nthe Government above them.  They should be consulted prior to all\r\nlegislation that affects their districts.\r\n\r\nIt will, of course, be said that they are now so consulted.  Drafts of\r\nnew Acts or amendments of Acts are sent round for comment and\r\ncriticism, and so District Officers are consulted.\r\n\r\nI don't call that consultation; even if it come within the dictionary\r\nmeaning of the word it does not come within its spirit.\r\n\r\nTake a concrete case: Suppose a new Village Act to be drafted and sent\r\nround to District Officers for criticism, how can any one officer\r\ncriticise it effectively, or make useful suggestions, except by chance?\r\nHis experience is confined to one, or two, or three districts; the Act\r\nis for the Province.  He may make suggestions to suit his district; he\r\ncannot tell if they will suit others.  He has no idea why certain\r\nprovisions are included.  He has no certain basis for constructive\r\ncriticism.  Very often he won't criticise at all.  He says: \"What is\r\nthe use?  It's only sent to me as a matter of form.\"  Besides, as I\r\nhave pointed out, the opinions of a number of individuals taken one by\r\none differ greatly from the opinion of the same number sitting together\r\nand discussing various points of view before framing an opinion.\r\n\r\nBut what Government wants is the collective opinion of its District\r\nOfficers, and not many varying views.  It would have far more\r\nconfidence in such an opinion, and be more careful in disregarding it.\r\nWhy should not District Officers meet once a year to discuss pending\r\nquestions, to consider new Acts, to suggest changes in old Acts?  Their\r\nproceedings would, of course, be private, and not for publication.\r\nOfficers should be encouraged to speak out.  It would be a great help\r\nto all of them, and I think it would give Government a sense of\r\nsecurity it has not got now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nOTHER SERVICES\r\n\r\nThe Indian Civil Service is the principal service in India; it\r\nfurnishes men for the executive, the magistracy, and judicature, the\r\nrevenue administration; and its members constitute not only the Local\r\nGovernment, but, excepting for the Law member and one or two others,\r\nthe Council of the Government of India.  Therefore it is in every way\r\nthe most important service to have in harmony with the people.  It is\r\nnot, however, the only service manned by Englishmen, and it is very\r\nnecessary that the other services also should be efficient.  These are\r\nthe Forest Department, the Engineer Department, and the Police.  Of the\r\nfirst two I have nothing to say.  They are technical departments, and\r\nalthough of course I have had a good deal to do with them, only a\r\nmember of their own department would have the specialist knowledge to\r\ncriticise them.  I believe they are dissatisfied, but how far their\r\ngrievances can be rectified I don't know.\r\n\r\nWith the police it is different.  Though a separate department, they\r\nwork in close touch with the District Magistrate, who is, in fact,\r\ntheir legal head.  He must be intimately acquainted with their working,\r\nand with his Superintendent of Police personally in order that work in\r\nthe district may go easily.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite for a good police-officer is a knowledge of the\r\nlanguage.  It is even more necessary for him than for the civilian.  It\r\nis an absolute essential.  And in the men of my day it was an essential\r\nthat was fulfilled for the most part.  Whether it will be so with the\r\nmen enlisted under the new system of competitive examination in England\r\nis more doubtful.  The men of former days entered the service younger,\r\nand the receptivity of their minds for acquiring languages had not been\r\ndestroyed by \"education.\"  It is, I think, a pity that a competitive\r\nexamination has been made the entrance-gate to the police.  Such\r\nexaminations prove nothing good in those who pass them.  They may be\r\ngood men, but preparation for examination has not increased that\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in competitive examinations.  For instance, take the\r\nIndian Police; what qualities are required in a good Superintendent of\r\nPolice?  They are ability to command, facility in two languages at\r\nleast, tact, a knowledge of human nature.  What does an examination\r\nselect him for?  Ability in any of these?  No, but for a retentive\r\nmemory of written words such as Greek or Latin, for dry rules such as\r\ngrammar, for memory of dry and useless facts such as history as it is\r\ntaught, for mathematics.  Is there any obvious connection between these\r\ntwo sets of qualities?  There is none whatever.  Has experience shown\r\nthat ability in the first argues ability in the second?  Experience\r\nshows the reverse.\r\n\r\nNeither is the athletic ability for which marks are given to Rhodes\r\nscholars any test whatever of anything but itself.  Without wishing for\r\na moment to infer that athletic ability argues a deficiency in mental\r\nability, I would ask how many of the leaders the world has known were\r\ngreat athletes?  Nelson, or Lord Roberts, or Napoleon, for instance.\r\nWhenever ability of muscle and of brain have occurred together it has\r\nbeen incidental, not causal.  Muscular ability is a good thing, but\r\nthere are better things.\r\n\r\nSuccess in competitive examinations proves one thing only--that the\r\ncandidate has a good memory for words.  It very frequently follows that\r\nhe is unable to go beneath words, and that he puts his trust in words\r\nand papers and formulæ because the habit of mind set up by examinations\r\ntends to this.\r\n\r\nThere is no sense in these examinations for anyone, except perhaps for\r\nthose about to be tutors of the same things.  Men of action and\r\nscholars are different in grain and the test for one usually eliminates\r\nthe other.  That there are a few exceptions only demonstrates that\r\nhuman nature cannot be confined within hard and fast rules.  But there\r\ncan be successful generalisation.\r\n\r\nCompetitive examinations are a fetish which Government worships because\r\nit is afraid of taking the responsibility of appointing officers on its\r\nown initiative.  It is afraid of the charge of nepotism.  But it would\r\nnot be nepotism to give the sons of its officers, Civil and Military,\r\nfirst chance of appointments in the Police.  It would be a graceful\r\nrecognition of the fact that when a man has spent his life in India he\r\nhas lost touch with England and cannot get his sons placed at home,\r\ntherefore he deserves consideration for them from the Government he has\r\nserved.  I do not believe in heredity in such matters because there is\r\nno evidence in its favour; but I do believe in early associations and\r\ntraditions.  Now the traditions and associations of the sons of\r\nofficers who have served in India are with India.\r\n\r\nI believe that a much sounder way would be to appoint sons of officers\r\nwho have served in India.  They have Indian traditions, and, what is\r\nmore, having as children learned the language it soon returns to them.\r\n\r\nI know this as a fact.  Some twenty-five years ago in Upper Burma a\r\nyoung police-officer was sent to the same station with me in Burma.  He\r\ncame direct from India, but had been born and brought up in Burma till\r\nhe was seven, when he went to England to school.  From England, at\r\neighteen or nineteen, he went to India--the Punjab, I think--and was\r\nappointed to the Police there.  When Upper Burma was in need of\r\nofficers he was sent to Burma on promotion.  On arrival he did not\r\nremember a word of Burmese, but it came rapidly back to him.  When\r\nsitting with me when I was talking to the Burmese he would continually\r\nsay to me, \"Didn't you say so-and-so?\" and \"Didn't he answer\r\nso-and-so?\"  Without learning it, his memory recalled the language to\r\nhim, and in a month or two he was talking it well and with a good\r\naccent.\r\n\r\nThere remain the Subordinate Civil Service and the Lower Grades of the\r\nPolice, all or nearly all of whom are native to the Province.\r\n\r\nIn another book, writing on this subject, I said: \"I read and hear\r\ncontinually that many of our native magistrates and judges and police\r\nare corrupt.  I am told they take bribes, that they falsify cases, that\r\nthey make right into wrong.  I wish to say that I have no belief in\r\nsuch charges.  Exceptions there may be, but that the mass of our Burman\r\nfellow-officers are honest I have no doubt.\"  All my experience has\r\ntended to support that view.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the world requires looking after, requires check and\r\nsupervision, requires that protection between himself and harm that\r\nonly a watching eye can give, and in Burma, for the Burmese officials,\r\nthese safeguards hardly exist.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that official Burma has no Press to criticise it,\r\nno native society to give it tone, no organised community to help the\r\nindividual in the right path.  He has many temptations, and a fall is\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in the general charge that Burmese are corrupt.  That\r\noccasional cases of undue influence should occur is natural if you\r\nconsider the circumstances under which they serve.  They are not, like\r\nthe English officers, independent of their surroundings in social\r\nmatters.  They have, for company's sake, to associate with the\r\npleaders, the merchants, the headmen, and others within their charge.\r\nTheir families are with them, and they are interested in the happenings\r\nof the town or village, and are concerned in it.  They are inevitably\r\ninfluenced in many ways, which we do not appreciate.  They know things\r\nwhich we do not.  In cases that come before them they often know of\r\nevents behind the scenes which lead up to the final happening which\r\ncomes into Court.  It is useless to say that they should not be\r\ninfluenced by anything but the evidence on the record; they cannot help\r\nbeing influenced.  They have, for instance, known of A being a trouble\r\nto his parents long before the charge which they have to try, and that\r\nis in their minds; or they know B to be a good character, and that his\r\naccusers are doubtful people.  It has happened to me, not once but many\r\ntimes, that on appeal I have read a judgment of a Burmese Subordinate\r\nMagistrate which puzzled me, because, though not contrary to the\r\nevidence, there has evidently been in the writer's mind something more\r\nthan the evidence.  In such cases I have usually inquired personally\r\nfrom the magistrate what it was he knew before passing orders on\r\nappeal, and I have sometimes taken further evidence on that point so as\r\nto get the record straight.  It is easy to say that magistrates should\r\nnot be affected by anything but the recorded evidence, just as it is\r\neasy to say that a magistrate should be blind.  Magistrates are human\r\nbeings--fortunately.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, the standard might be higher.  This raising of the\r\nstandard can, however, only be attained by raising the standard of\r\nindependence in the people, and our rule tends to decrease this.  Under\r\nself-government it will rise.  It is self-government and its consequent\r\npublicity which have purified Courts in England.  Look at Judge\r\nJeffreys and his time.  We are not people to adopt too Pharisaic an\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nElsewhere I have commented on the failure of the \"educated\" native to\r\nmake a good official, and I need not repeat myself.  The education we\r\ngive is not good for them, but until a national system of education is\r\ninstituted I don't see what we can do.  The subordinate service, as\r\nlong as it is subordinate, cannot attract the best men, because the\r\nprospects are poor.\r\n\r\nAs to the rank and file of the police I have this to say--they are\r\nunsatisfactory, and the Police Commission did not get at the real\r\ncauses.  Do Commissions ever get at real causes?  Are they not merely\r\nexcuses to give \"face\" to Government?  What is the use of examining\r\ninnumerable witnesses none of whom have probed the subject?  Answers to\r\ndifficult questions are not got by asking, but by personal experience:\r\nby a man or men capable of understanding what they see and finding out\r\nthe causes.\r\n\r\nPay has something to do with the poorness of the material, but in Burma\r\nat least it is not the principal cause.  That cause is that the police\r\nare disliked, and they are disliked because they are part of a legal\r\nsystem which is disliked and disapproved of.  The police are considered\r\nalmost as enemies of the people.  To rehabilitate the police and get\r\nreally good men into it the whole criminal system requires amendment.\r\nWhen the people like and admire the Courts they will like and will\r\nenter the service of those Courts.  Now they will do neither.  A\r\npopular Government may be a good Government; an unpopular Government\r\ncannot possibly be so.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is said that the Burman takes badly to discipline and will\r\nnever, therefore, make a good policeman nor soldier.\r\n\r\nThat he takes badly to discipline is true, but what is the reason?\r\nThat he is essentially different from other people?  That is absurd.\r\nThe reason of it lies in his past history, his environment and\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nWhen we took Upper Burma it was hardly an organised nation at all.  It\r\nwas only a mass of villagers which acknowledged a king over all.  There\r\nwas no national army--because no need for one--and no large industries.\r\nThe Burman has been a free man and he has the religion--or want of\r\nreligion--of a free man.  He has never had priests to rule him, to\r\nforce on him reverence and obedience as virtues, to destroy his\r\nindividuality.  Therefore he has lived free.  And nowadays, although he\r\nis lectured enough on his want of discipline, the advice is given in\r\nthe wrong way and apropos of the wrong subject.\r\n\r\nHe ought in the opinion of his critics to be a good policeman or a good\r\nsoldier, or a good employé for the rice merchants in Rangoon, and he is\r\nnot.  Therefore he is lectured on his want of discipline.  \"That is to\r\nsay,\" thinks the Burman, \"I am lectured and abused in order that I may\r\nbe a more useful tool in the hands of a foreign Government, or a more\r\nprofitable servant to a foreign merchant--who will reap the benefit.\"\r\n\r\nThat is what he thinks and rightly thinks, for the advice is so\r\nprompted and so meant.\r\n\r\nHe has yet to learn that discipline in act is necessary to enable him\r\nto attain his own ideals, to create and maintain his own\r\nself-government, and to establish industries that will compete with the\r\nforeigner's.  He must himself establish organisms in order to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe Burman is afraid of discipline, partly because it is new to him,\r\nand partly because he is afraid that by surrendering independence of\r\nact he will surrender independence of spirit.\r\n\r\nThis can only be got over by a true education, by making the boy see\r\nfor himself that only in union is strength, and that he must learn to\r\nact with others, and therefore under leaders.  He will see this fast\r\nenough if it is carefully shown him when young.  He will accept it also\r\nif it is clearly demonstrated to him that obedience in act does not\r\ninfer surrender of his soul.  It is the latter he is afraid of, and\r\nwisely.  Tell him that not only may he think for himself, but that he\r\nis bound to do so, while at the same time subordinating private\r\nopinions to a common end, and you will get discipline as much as you\r\nlike.  It is a matter of common sense, and he has plenty of that.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical obedience to masters and spiritual or material pastors\r\nbecause they have been \"set in authority\" over us should never be\r\ntaught.  They have not been set in authority.  They may deserve\r\nobedience if they are leaders in the right way, and we should\r\nco-operate with them there by serving them towards an end good for\r\nboth.  Get the boy to understand that.  Then you get that willing and\r\nintelligent obedience which is worth all the mechanical obedience in\r\nthe world.  This is true in all walks of life.  If you wish to read of\r\na startling example, read of how the Revolutionary troops of France, as\r\nsoon as they had gained a little experience, met and overthrew the\r\nwooden and lifeless battalions of Prussia, which had been drilled to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThere must be life and intelligence, and a purpose in obedience as in\r\nall else for it to be a virtue.  In itself obedience is not an end, it\r\nis only justifiable as a means to an end.  It must arise from the\r\nexercise of will, not from its atrophy or from surrender to the will of\r\nothers.  You obey because you wish to obey, not because you are forced\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nThat is the true education in discipline.\r\n\r\nBut all this can only come with local self-government, local\r\npatriotism, and a national education.  They are what make a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLAW REFORM\r\n\r\nWhen the _personnel_ of the Government of India from the bottom to the\r\ntop has been reorganised on a basis of understanding of the people, it\r\nwill begin to revise its laws, and the first will be its Penal Law, its\r\nCriminal Courts and Procedure.\r\n\r\nTo do this with any success it will be necessary first to study the\r\ncausation of crime, because until you know how it is caused you cannot\r\npossibly frame any system of prevention that is likely to do less harm\r\nthan good.\r\n\r\nThis is a subject that many men have been studying for some years past,\r\nbut very little progress has yet been made.  The old shibboleths that\r\ncrime results from a desire for crime and that the only cure is savage\r\npunishment still hold good with all Governments, though quite\r\ndiscredited outside official circles.  It is a most fascinating\r\nsubject, and as it is one I have worked at for many years I may be\r\nexcused for devoting a somewhat large space to it here.\r\n\r\nIt is more than twenty-five years ago that my attention was first\r\nattracted to the causation of crime.  I was a young magistrate then,\r\ntrying my first cases; very nervous, very conscientious that I should\r\nfulfil all the legal requirements as laid down in the Codes.  It had\r\nnever occurred to me then that there was any gulf between justice and\r\nlaw--I supposed that they were one, that law was only codified and\r\nsystemised justice; therefore, in fulfilling the Law I thought that I\r\nwas surely administering Justice.\r\n\r\nI was trying a theft case.  I cannot remember now what it was that had\r\nbeen stolen, but I think it was a bullock.  The accused was undefended,\r\nand I, as the custom is, questioned him about the case, not with the\r\nview of getting him to commit himself, but in order to try to elicit\r\nhis defence, if any.  He had none.  He admitted the theft, described\r\nthe circumstances quite fully and frankly, and said he was guilty.  I\r\nasked him if he knew when he took the bullock from the grazing ground\r\nthat he was stealing it, and he answered \"Yes.\"  I asked him if he knew\r\nthat the punishment for cattle theft was two years' imprisonment, which\r\npractically meant ruin for life, and he replied that he knew it would\r\nbe heavy.\r\n\r\nThen I asked, \"Why did you do it?\"\r\n\r\nHe moved uneasily in the dock without answering, looked about him, and\r\nseemed puzzled.\r\n\r\nI repeated the question.\r\n\r\nEvidently he was trying to remember back why he had done it, and found\r\nit difficult.  He had not considered the point before, and\r\nintrospection was new to him.  \"Why did I do it?\" he was saying to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked me frankly in the face.  \"I don't know,\" he said.  \"I suppose\r\nI could not help it.  I did not think about it at all; something just\r\nmade me take it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was convicted, of course, and I forgot the case.\r\n\r\nBut I did not forget what he had said.  It remained in my mind and\r\nrecurred to me from time to time, I did not know why.  For I had always\r\nbeen taught that crime was due to an evil disposition which a person\r\ncould change, only he would not, and I had as yet seen no reason to\r\nquestion this view.  Therefore the accused's defence appealed to no\r\nidea that was consciously in my mind.  I did not reflect upon it.  I\r\ncan only suppose that, unconsciously to myself, these words reached\r\nsome instinct within me which told me that they were true.  And at last\r\nfrom the very importunity of their return I did begin to think about\r\nthem, and, consequently on them, of the causation of crime in general.\r\nA curiosity awoke which has never abated, has indeed but grown, as in\r\nsome small ways I was able to satisfy it.\r\n\r\nWhat causes crime?  Is it a purely individual matter?  If so, why does\r\nit follow certain lines of increase or decrease, or maintain an\r\naverage?  That looks more like general results following on general\r\ncauses than the result of individual qualities.  Why is it not curable?\r\nIt should have been cured centuries ago.  Why does punishment usually\r\nmake the offender worse instead of better?  If his crime were within\r\nthe individual's control, its punishment certainly would deter.  It\r\ndoes not.  Any deterrent effect it may have is rarely on him who is\r\npunished, but on the outside world, and that is but little.  So much I\r\nsaw very clearly in practice, and every book I read on the subject\r\nconfirmed this.  The infamous penal laws of England a hundred years ago\r\ndid not stop crime; flogging did not stop garotting, it ceased for\r\nother causes.  I began to think and to observe.\r\n\r\nSome three years later my attention was still more strongly drawn to\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nI was then for a short time the Governor of the biggest gaol in the\r\nworld, that in Rangoon.  It was crowded with prisoners under sentence\r\nfor many different forms of crime, from murder or \"dacoity\"--that is\r\ngang robbery--to petty theft.\r\n\r\nThe numbers were abnormal, and they were so not only here, but in all\r\nthe gaols of both the Upper and Lower Provinces.  The average of crime\r\nhad greatly risen.\r\n\r\nWhy was this?\r\n\r\nThe reason was obvious.  The annexation of the Upper Province six years\r\nbefore had caused a wave of unrest, not only there, but in the delta\r\ndistricts as well, that found its expression in many forms of crime.\r\nThere was no doubt about the cause.  But this cause was a general\r\ncause, not individual.  The individual criminals there in the gaol did\r\nnot declare the war.  That was the consequence of acts by the King of\r\nBurma and the Government of India controlled by the English Cabinet,\r\nand was consequent on acts of the French Government.  Therefore half of\r\nthese individuals had become criminals because of the disagreements of\r\nthree Governments, two of which were six thousand miles away from\r\nRangoon.\r\n\r\nThere is no getting out of that.  In normal times the average of\r\nconvicts would have been only half what it was.  The abnormality was\r\nnot due to the convicts themselves.\r\n\r\nThus if A and B and C were suffering punishment in the gaol the fault\r\nis primarily not theirs.  A special strain was set up from without\r\nwhich they could not stand and they fell.\r\n\r\nBut if this is true of half the prisoners, why not of the other half?\r\nThere was no dividing line between the two classes.  Political offences\r\napart, you could not walk into the gaol and, dividing the convicts into\r\ntwo parts, say: \"The crimes of this half being due to external causes,\r\nthey must be pardoned; the crimes of the other half being due to their\r\nown evil disposition, they must continue to suffer.\"  There was no\r\ndemarcation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, general causes are occasionally the cause of crime.  Here\r\nwas a long step in advance.\r\n\r\nAgain, four years later I was on famine duty in the Upper Province, and\r\nthe same phenomenon occurred.  There was an increase in certain forms\r\nof crime.  Thefts doubled.  Other crimes such as cheating and\r\nfraudulent dealings with money decreased.  Here was again a general\r\ncause.  Half of those thieves would have remained honest men all their\r\nlives, been respected by their fellow-men, and, according to religions,\r\nhave gone to heaven when they died, but for the famine.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the famine were want of rain acting on the economic\r\nweakness of the people reared by the inability of government.  Thus,\r\nhad rain fallen as usual, had the people been able to cultivate other\r\nresources, had government been more advanced and experienced, half\r\nthese thieves would not have been in gaol; and no one knew which half,\r\nfor thefts of food did not increase.  There was, in fact, no reason\r\nthey should, as Government provided on the famine camps a subsistence\r\nwage for everyone who came.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, certain individuals were saved from misappropriating\r\nmoney, or cheating in mercantile transactions, because there was little\r\nmoney left to misappropriate and not much business.  If they lived\r\nhonestly and went to heaven, the chief cause would be the failure of\r\nrain that year, not any superior virtue of their own.  But no one knew\r\nwho these individuals were who were so luckily saved.\r\n\r\nBut when you have acknowledged this, what is becoming of the doctrine\r\nof individual responsibility for crime?  If a man has complete\r\nfree-will to sin or not, if crime be due to innate wickedness, how does\r\nwant of rain bring this on?  And where is the common sense or common\r\njustice in punishing him for what is really due to a defective climate?\r\nHe cannot control the rain.  Manifestly then, as regards at least half\r\nof these thieves, there was no innate desire to steal, because that\r\ncould not be affected by the famine.  Had they desired to be thieves\r\nthey would have been so in any case.  The truth is that they did not\r\ndesire to be thieves, but when the famine increased the temptation,\r\nand, through physical weakness, decreased their power of resistance,\r\nthey fell.  They sinned--not through spiritual desire of evil, but\r\nthrough physical inability to resist temptation.\r\n\r\nBut if this is true of half, why not of the whole?  There is no line of\r\ndemarcation.  If true of some crime, why not of all?  The doctrine of a\r\nman's perfect free-will to sin or not to sin as he pleases is beginning\r\nto look shaky.  It will be as well to consider it.\r\n\r\nWhat is free-will?\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity to discuss the meaning of \"free\"; we all know it;\r\nthere is nothing ambiguous about it; but with \"will\" it is different.\r\nThere are few words so incessantly misused as this word \"will.\"\r\nPhilosophers are the worst offenders, and the general public but follow\r\ntheir blind lead; yet unless you know exactly what you mean by it how\r\ncan you use it as a counter of your thought?\r\n\r\nWhat does _will_ mean?  \"Where there's a will there's a way\"--what does\r\nthis mean?  Does it mean wish?  If, for instance, you are poor and\r\nstupid, can any quantity of wish make you rich?  If you are weak will\r\nit make you strong?  If you have no ear will it make you a musician?\r\nIf you are a convict can it liberate you?  That is absurd.\r\n\r\n\"Will,\" then means more than wish; to the desire must be added the\r\nability--actual or potential.  That is evident, is it not?  Without the\r\nability the wish avails nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Will,\" then, has two complements, both of which are necessary to it.\r\nIts meaning is not simple but compound; never forget this; never\r\nsuppose that merely wishing with all your power can produce \"will.\"  It\r\ncannot unless the ability be developed to aid it.\r\n\r\nAnd now we get back from words to human nature--Is the criminal so\r\nbecause he wants to be so?  No, and No, and No again.  No such wicked\r\nfallacy was ever foisted upon a credulous world as this.  Nobody at any\r\nperiod of the world ever wished to be criminal.  Everyone instinctively\r\nhates and fears crime; everyone is honest by nature; it is inherent in\r\nthe soul.  I have never met a criminal that did not hate his crime even\r\nmore than his condemners hate it.  The apparent exceptions are when a\r\nman does not consider his act a crime; he has killed because his victim\r\nexasperated him to it; he has robbed society because society made war\r\non him.  The offender hates his crime.\r\n\r\n\"But he is not ashamed of it.\"\r\n\r\nNow that is true.  He is not ashamed of it in the current sense.  He\r\nhates it; he fears it; but it does not fill him with a sense of sin.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" says the purist, \"he has a hardened conscience.  It is his\r\nconscience, as I said, that is at fault.\"\r\n\r\nBut the purist is wrong.  He does not understand the criminal.  He has\r\nnever tried to understand him as I have tried.  What the criminal feels\r\ntowards his crime is what the sick man feels towards the delirium that\r\nseizes him--what the \"possessed of devils\" feels towards the possession\r\nwhen it comes.  It terrifies him; he knows he must succumb; he fears\r\nnot the mere penalty, but the crime.  But he is not ashamed, because he\r\nknows he cannot help it.  And punishment exasperates him because he has\r\nnot deserved it, and it will do him harm, not good.  He wants to be\r\ncured--not made a fit dwelling for still worse devils.  And that is\r\nwhat punishment does.\r\n\r\nThe effect of punishment in deterring a criminal from repeating his\r\ncrime is small.  All study of criminal facts proves this.  It generally\r\nmakes him more prone to crime, not less; and all the great crimes are\r\ncommitted by men who have been still further ruined in gaols.  What\r\ngood effect punishment may have is mainly exercised on other than the\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nPunishment has some effect, but how much we do not yet know, because\r\nthe matter has never been investigated, and it is not on the patient.\r\nCrime is a disease, and will you stop a fever by punishing the\r\npatients?  Whatever good gaols do lies in the fact that they isolate\r\nthe unhealthy from the healthy and so stop for a time infection, as do\r\nhospitals with disease.  But the hospitals do not discharge the patient\r\ntill he is cured; the gaol aggravates the liability to the disease and\r\nturns out the sufferer worse than before.\r\n\r\nLet us go back.  A man is criminal not because he wishes to be so, but\r\nbecause he cannot resist the temptation.  He lacks will.  True, but it\r\nis the ability he lacks, not the wish.  Why does he lack ability?\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the second theory of crime--a new one--that criminals\r\nare born, not made.  The tendency to crime is said to be inherent, to\r\nbe a reversion, to be inherited.  That explains why it is generally\r\nincurable when once contracted.\r\n\r\nMany books have been written on this, but one fallacy vitiates them\r\nall.  The observers have not observed the criminal in the making but\r\nwhen made.  They have assumed the criminal to be of a race apart, and\r\nso founded their house upon the sand.  Lombroso went so far as to lay\r\ndown certain stigmata that inferred a criminal disposition.  The\r\nstigmata have been shown to be universal, and there is no such thing as\r\na \"criminal disposition.\"  If there be other qualities that do\r\ndifferentiate the criminal from the normal man, they are not innate.\r\n\r\nThat those born crippled in some way frequently become criminals is no\r\nexception; it denotes no criminal disposition.  But the cripple is\r\nhandicapped in the struggle for life.  He is cut off from the many\r\npleasures of work and play, of love and children, which his fellows\r\nhave.  He is sensitive and he is jeered at and despised.  Is it any\r\nwonder that under such circumstances he becomes sometimes embittered?\r\nA cripple is set apart from his fellow-men.  There are for him but two\r\nalternatives--to be a saint or a criminal.  Love and care and training\r\nwill make him a saint; neglect too often makes him a criminal.  But to\r\nwhom the blame for the latter?  Not to him.\r\n\r\nConnected with this theory is the supposition that criminality is\r\nhereditary.\r\n\r\nThere are few subjects on which so much \"scientific\" nonsense is talked\r\nand written as this of heredity.  Not very much is known of it as\r\nregards plants, less of animals, and almost nothing as regards\r\nhumanity.  Furthermore, the experience gained in plants and animals is\r\nuseless as regards humanity.  Evolution in humanity tends to greater\r\nbrain power, but all cultivation in animals and plants has tended to\r\ndestroy brain power and even adaptability.  To read books on heredity\r\nis to read a mass of suppositions and hazardous inductions where most\r\nof the facts are negative and the exceptions are positive.  There is\r\nnothing so easy and nothing so fatal as this tendency to attribute to\r\nheredity what is due to training, or want of training.  It excuses\r\nsupineness in Governments and professions.  Here is what John Stuart\r\nMill, a profound thinker, thought of this facile recourse to heredity\r\nas an excuse:\r\n\r\n\"Of all vulgar methods of escape from the effects of social and moral\r\ninfluences on the mind, the most vulgar is that of attributing the\r\ndiversions of conduct and character to inherent natural differences.\"\r\n\r\nThis, too, is what Buckle said: \"We often hear of hereditary talents,\r\nhereditary vices, and hereditary virtues; but whoever will critically\r\nexamine the evidence will find that there is no proof of their\r\nexistence.  The way in which they are usually proved is in the highest\r\ndegree illogical; the usual course being for writers to collect\r\ninstances of some mental peculiarity found in a parent and his child,\r\nand then to infer that the peculiarity was bequeathed.  By this mode of\r\nreasoning we might demonstrate any proposition.  But this is not the\r\nway in which the truth is discovered; and we ought to enquire not only\r\nhow many instances there are of hereditary talents, etc., but how many\r\ninstances there are of such qualities not being hereditary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have for myself, neither in life nor in books, found one single case\r\nin which it could be confidently said that a criminal weakness was\r\ninherited.  That A, a criminal, has a son B, who also became criminal,\r\nproves nothing.  You must first prove that a similar child of different\r\nstock would not become criminal if brought up as A's son was.  You must\r\nalso prove that if you took away A's son as a child and brought him up\r\ndifferently he would still show criminal weakness.  But all the facts\r\nnegative this.  The child even of a criminal tribe in India, if removed\r\nfrom its environment, grows up like other children.  Coming of criminal\r\nancestors has not handed down a criminal aptitude.  You must not\r\nmistake inheritance of other traits for inheritance of criminal\r\naptitudes.  A is very quick-tempered, which he has not from a child\r\nbeen trained to control.  Under sudden provocation he kills a man.  His\r\nson B inherits his father's quick temper, is similarly badly brought\r\nup, and the same thing occurs.  The hasty hereditary theorist says:\r\n\"Behold the inheritance of a propensity to murder.\"  But quick temper\r\nis not a criminal trait; it is often an accompaniment of the kindest\r\ndisposition.  It is an excess of sensitiveness.  The training, physical\r\nand mental, was in each case lacking, and a coincidence of provocation\r\ncaused a coincidence of crime.\r\n\r\nLet it be once clearly discerned that if a quality be hereditary it is\r\nalways hereditary, and cannot appear, except as the result of\r\nheredity--and the absurdity of modern theories will be manifest.\r\n\r\nThere is not--there has never been in anyone--a tendency to crime until\r\neither gaols or criminal education creates it.  No one ever wanted to\r\ncommit crime as crime.  A daring boy with no outlet for his energy may\r\nbreak out into violence, robbery, and later into burglary; he would not\r\nhave done so had his physical need for exercise and his spiritual need\r\nfor facing danger had another outlet.  The instincts that led him into\r\ncrime were good and noble instincts which, finding no legitimate\r\nchannel, found an illegitimate channel for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn that fine book of Mr. Holmes', entitled _London's Underworld_, is an\r\naccount of how hooligans are made.  The young men are full of\r\nenergy--they want exercise, struggle, the fight of the football field\r\nor the hockey match, and they cannot get it.  They have no playground\r\nbut the streets and no outlet for their energy save hooliganism.  The\r\npity of it!\r\n\r\nWhat, then, causes crime?\r\n\r\nIt is never the wish for crime.  It is one of two causes.  Either it is\r\nthe only outlet for some natural instinct which is denied legitimate\r\noutlet by the environment, or it is due to an inability to resist\r\ntemptation when it offers.\r\n\r\nHow can it be prevented?\r\n\r\nNow this inability is physical.  The wish is spiritual--the ability is\r\nphysical and depends greatly on health.  With ill-health or\r\nmalnutrition in the young the first thing to give is the power of\r\ncontrol.  The average of criminals are a stone underweight.  Therefore,\r\ncrime is dependent to a great extent on health.  Ill-health causes\r\ncrime; accidental mutilation causes crime; accident creates an aptitude\r\nto crime; neglected youth and education cause crime.\r\n\r\nReligion does not affect crime one way or another.  The greatest\r\ncriminals are often religious.  Mediæval Europe was very religious and\r\nvery criminal, and there are many other instances.  Honesty is inborn\r\nin all; it is part of the \"light that lighteth every man that is born\r\ninto this world\"; it requires no teaching.  What must be acquired is\r\nthe ability to give effect to it.  Crime is a physical, not a spiritual\r\ndisease.  And crime is no defect of the individual.  It is a disease of\r\nthe nation--nay, of humanity--exhibited in individuals.  You have gout\r\nin your toe, but it is your whole system that is wrong.  This disease\r\ncan be cured by Humanity alone.  Criminals are those whom we should\r\npity, should prevent, should isolate, and, if possible, cure.\r\n\r\nRemember what John Bradford said, looking on a man going to be hanged:\r\n\"But for the grace of God there goes John Bradford.\"  He, too, would\r\nhave been the same had he had bad training in his youth.\r\n\r\nWe have all of us within us instincts which rightly directed result in\r\ngood, which in default of outlet we can be trained to control, but\r\nwhich without outlet and without the receipt of training may result in\r\ncrime.  Crime is, therefore, a defect of training and environment, not\r\nof personality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCOURTS REFORM\r\n\r\nBut, pending any such great change as must come in all penal law when\r\nthe subject has been carefully studied, there are many smaller\r\namendments that might be made both in Civil and Revenue Courts and Law.\r\n\r\nThe pressing need in Criminal Procedure is, I think, a change in the\r\ntreatment of an accused person when he is arrested.\r\n\r\nThe first instinct of an offender is, as I have said, to confess, even\r\nif an understanding person is not available to confess to.  He has\r\noffended the Law; he wants to make all amends he can by confessing to\r\nthe representative of that offended Personality.  I have seen very many\r\nfirst offenders and talked to them before they got into the hands of\r\npleaders and others, and my experience tells me that a man who has\r\ncommitted his first offence is very like a man who has caught his first\r\nattack of serious illness.  He is afraid not so much of the results as\r\nof the thing itself.  Sin has caught him, and he is afraid of sin.  He\r\nwants protection and help and cure.  He does not want to hide anything;\r\nhis first need is confession to some understanding ear.  Many, many\r\nsuch confessions have I heard in the old days.  That is the result of\r\nthe first offence.\r\n\r\nBut this tendency to truth is choked when it is ascertained that as a\r\nresult the offender will be vindictively punished and made in the end\r\nfar worse than he was at the beginning.  Naturally the offender says to\r\nhimself: \"I am bad now.  What shall I be after two years' gaol?  Better\r\nfight it out.  If I win and get acquitted, at least I shall have a\r\nchance to reform.  If convicted that chance will be taken from me for\r\never.  And fighting will not lose me anything.  The penitent prisoner\r\nwho confesses gets no lighter punishment than if he had put the Court\r\nto the expense of a long trial.  Why therefore repent?  It will do me\r\nharm, not good.\"  That is the case now; under reasonable laws it would\r\nbe the other way.  But even yet in country places he often confesses to\r\nthe police by whom he is arrested.\r\n\r\nNow by Indian Law no confession to the police may be offered in\r\nevidence.  The reason of this is that the police, in their keenness to\r\nsecure a conviction, may extort a false confession by torture, and\r\nthere have been in fact enough of such cases to cause doubt and to\r\nprevent the police being allowed to receive a confession.  Therefore if\r\nthe offender wishes to confess he is taken now to a magistrate, there\r\nhis confession is recorded.  Then he is sent back to police custody.\r\nHe is visited by his relatives, a pleader is engaged for him.  His\r\nfolly in confessing is pointed out to him and he withdraws the\r\nconfession, alleging that he had been tortured to confess.  His\r\nconfession is not only negatived, but a slur is cast on the police\r\nwhich is hard to remove.  Their case and evidence appear tainted, and\r\nthe accused often secures an acquittal though the Magistrate knows that\r\nthe confession was true.\r\n\r\nAll this is very common both in Burma and India, and it is disastrous\r\nto allow and to encourage such things, as by our procedure we do\r\nencourage them.  There should be a complete change.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is arrested some such procedure should be adopted as this:\r\n\r\nHe should be told by the police that he is being taken direct to the\r\nmagistrate who will try the case, who will hear anything accused has to\r\nsay.  He should be warned to say nothing to the police.  Then he should\r\nbe taken direct to the magistrate, who should explain to him fully what\r\nhe is accused of and ask him what he has to say.\r\n\r\nWhatever his statement be, the magistrate should tell him that he will\r\nhimself at once investigate it and summon witnesses; meanwhile the\r\naccused should be remitted to custody, but _not_ to police custody.\r\nThat is where all the trouble comes in and all opportunities for making\r\ncharges against the police.  If there be no gaol there should be a\r\nlock-up in charge of Indian police who are under the magistrate and are\r\nnot concerned in the guilt or otherwise of the accused.  The\r\ninvestigating police should only have access to accused by permission\r\nof the magistrate.  He should, however, be allowed to see his friends\r\nand a pleader if he wish.  But I am sure of this, that the first\r\noffender would rather trust the magistrate, if he were a personality\r\nwho he knew would help him, than any pleader.\r\n\r\nFurther, if a man confess truly, his punishment should be greatly\r\nreduced.  I do not say this should be done because he gives less\r\ntrouble, but because the frame of mind induced by a free and full\r\nconfession is a sounder frame of mind on which to begin reformation\r\nthan are defiance and negation, which are now inculcated by our system.\r\n\r\nThe trial need not wait till the case is complete.  The magistrate\r\ncould summon the police witnesses at once, and he should examine them\r\nhimself, allowing only the police to suggest questions if they wish.\r\nSimilarly, with the defence witnesses, they could be examined as they\r\ncame in and should be examined by the magistrate himself.  No one but\r\nthe magistrate should be allowed to speak directly to any party to the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAll cross-examination should be absolutely prohibited.  If either side\r\nhave matters they wish brought out of a witness, they should tell the\r\nmagistrate and he would ask such questions as he thought fit.  There is\r\nno such curse now to justice as cross-examination by a clever pleader\r\nor barrister.  It is a sort of forensic show-off by the advocate at the\r\ncost of the witness, and frequently at the cost of justice.  For,\r\nnaturally, no one cares to be bullied by a licensed bully, and\r\nwitnesses consequently will not come to Court if they can help it.\r\nWhen in Court they are bamboozled and made to contradict themselves\r\nwhere they have originally spoken the truth.\r\n\r\nI have often been told that acute cross-examination by a clever\r\nbarrister is the greatest safeguard justice can have from false\r\nevidence.  I don't believe a word of it.  A magistrate can by far fewer\r\nand simpler questions expose false evidence better than an advocate\r\ndoes, because the magistrate is intent only on his business--to find\r\nthe truth; the advocate is advertising himself, and trying to destroy\r\ntruth as well as falsehood.\r\n\r\nBut if the magistrate did all the questioning I don't believe there\r\nwould be much false evidence.  Witnesses will lie to the opposite side,\r\nbut not to an understanding Court.\r\n\r\nPerjury would disappear.  What is its present cause?  Contempt of the\r\nCourt and sympathy with either complainant or accused, which sympathy\r\nsees no chance of justice for its object except by perjury.  Because a\r\ntrial is a fight.  There is not a human being East or West who would\r\nnot be ashamed to lie to a Court he knew was trying to do its best for\r\nall--parties and public.  It is because the Courts as at present\r\nconstituted do as much harm as good that perjury is rampant and\r\ncondoned.  It is so in all countries, it has been so in all periods.\r\n\r\nThen, as soon as possible, juries should be introduced.  This cannot be\r\ndone until the law, especially as regards punishment, is greatly\r\naltered in accordance with the common sense of the people, but it is\r\nthe objective to be aimed at as soon as possible.  Until the public\r\nco-operate with the Courts in all ways you will never have a good\r\nsystem of justice.  Crime hurts the people far more than it hurts\r\nGovernment.  Don't you think the people know that?  And don't you\r\nsuppose they want it prevented even more than Government does?  In any\r\ncase that is the fact.  They hate the Courts now because they don't\r\nprevent or cure crime; they only make matters worse.\r\n\r\nThe only objection I see to this proposed alteration is that it will\r\ntake more time and so cost more money.  At first it may do so, but even\r\nthen what the public loses by more taxes it will more than save in\r\nhaving to pay less to lawyers.  How much unnecessary money is now paid\r\nto lawyers?  Enough, I am sure, to double the magistracy and then leave\r\na big balance.  Courts should be made for the people, not for lawyers.\r\nAnd in time crime would so decrease that there would be saving all\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reform of the Civil Courts should follow somewhat the same lines.\r\nA man should not have to wait to see a civil judge till his case is all\r\nmade out.  He should be able to go to him at once and confide in him,\r\nand the judge should send for the other party and try to make an\r\narrangement between them so that no suit should be filed.  Not until\r\nthat has been done and not unless a judge give a certificate of its\r\nnecessity should a suit be allowed to be filed as it is now.  And then\r\nwhen it is filed the judge should conduct the case and not the\r\nadvocates on each side.  That is the only way to stop the perjury which\r\nincreases and will increase.  Magistrates and judges must cease to be\r\numpires of a combat, and become investigators of truth.\r\n\r\nAs regards the laws of marriage and inheritance, no great change can be\r\nmade until there is a real representative Assembly to make these\r\nchanges, but even there something could be done.  That fossilisation of\r\ncustom described by Sir Henry Sumner Maine should stop.  Because a High\r\nCourt proved a hundred years ago that a certain custom existed there is\r\nno evidence that it does or should exist now.  To establish precedents\r\nof this nature is to stop all progress of every kind; we have a vision\r\ndifferent from the poet's\r\n\r\n  Of bondage slowly narrowing down\r\n  From precedent to precedent.\r\n\r\nWhy should not fresh inquiries into custom be made from time to time,\r\nit being understood that any Court-ruling only applied to that time and\r\nplace, and did not bind the future?  Something must be done.  Things\r\ncannot go on as they are.  We reproach the Indians for want of\r\nprogress, but we ourselves are the main cause of that stagnation.  We\r\nbind them and they cannot move.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards land policy there is this to be said, that fixed ideas are a\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nIn Bengal there was at one time a fixed idea that all land did and must\r\nbelong to large land-owners, and so, partly out of sheer ignorance,\r\npartly out of prejudice, a race of Zemindars was created out of the\r\ntax-gatherers to the Mogul Empire.  The result has been sad.\r\n\r\nAgain in Burma the same idea prevailed for a while, and headmen were\r\nencouraged to annex communal waste as their private land.  This was\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\nThen came a reaction, and all large estates were denounced as bad.\r\nThere was to be a small tenantry holding direct from Government,\r\nforbidden to alienate their land, and all leasing of land to tenants\r\nwas forbidden.\r\n\r\nThis I understand to be the policy still.  It is a policy of fixed\r\nideas, and as applied to anything that has life, like land tenure, it\r\nis unfortunate, no matter what the fixed idea be.\r\n\r\nIf there be one truth above another that is clear in studying land\r\nsystems it is that no one permanent system is good.  The cultivation of\r\nland, like all matters, undergoes evolution and change.  What is good\r\nto-day may not be good to-morrow.  The English system of large estates\r\ncultivated by tenants did, at one time in English history, produce the\r\nbest farming in the world.  English farming was held up as an example\r\nto all countries and was so admitted by them.  The system of large\r\nestates allowed of the expenditure of capital, experiments in new\r\ncultivations and new breeds of cattle, and variety of crops.  It suited\r\nits day well.  And though its full day has passed, there will never be\r\na time when some large estates will not be able to justify themselves.\r\nEven if, as apparently is the case now in England, _petite culture_ is\r\nthat best adapted to the cultivation of the day and the needs of the\r\npeople, yet there is still room for large estates.  A dead uniformity\r\nof small holdings could not but be unfortunate for any country.\r\n\r\nFurther, although excessive alienation of land through money-lenders\r\nmay be very bad, yet stagnation in ownership may be worse.  India and\r\nBurma are progressive, and changes must take place.  Cultivators will\r\nbecome artisans and traders; city people will like to return to the\r\nland.  There is an ebb and flow which is good for all.  Too great\r\nrigidity of system will stop progress.  A good system of land tenure is\r\nthat which is in accordance with the evolution of the people it applies\r\nto and assists in that evolution.\r\n\r\nWhile recognising that for the bulk of the people small holdings are\r\nbest, it will not forbid larger estates; while admitting that the\r\nalienation of land through borrowing recklessly from money-lenders is\r\nbad, it will see that the progress of the people from purely\r\nagricultural towards a state of industrial activity is not checked.  It\r\ntakes all sorts to make a State.\r\n\r\nIt may be good for the cultivator to hold direct from Government, but\r\nif Government is to be the landlord it must act up to its name.  It\r\nmust give compensation for improvements when a tenant has to relinquish\r\nthe land.  Otherwise no tenant will improve, and the necessity for\r\nimprovement, for wells, irrigation, embankments, manuring, and so on,\r\nis the greatest necessity of agriculture.  In my own experience I have\r\nseen that the system of State land tenure in Upper Burma does stop\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThat is the light in which the land question has to be worked out, on\r\nbroad comprehensive lines--that, while acknowledging the present, sees\r\nalso the future, which, while seeing one form of good does not deny\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSo, with an understanding and a sympathetic _personnel_, the\r\nadministration would be brought nearer to the people, until at length\r\nwhen their capacity for self-government had developed they would be\r\nable to take over our administrative machine little by little and work\r\nit themselves.\r\n\r\nThey could never do that now.  If by any chance they did get possession\r\nof the machinery at present, they would set to work to smash it till\r\nnone remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nAnd thus the sheltering Government of India having been reformed both\r\nin its _personnel_ and in its laws, brought into touch and sympathy\r\nwith its people, a start would be made with self-government.\r\n\r\nThat, of course, must begin with the village, which is the germ from\r\nwhich all self-government that is of any value has always begun, and on\r\nthe health and vitality of which it must always depend.  The village\r\norganism must be restored to the state in which we found it, and from\r\nthat be helped and encouraged to grow to greater things.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the present conception of the village as an appanage of\r\nthe headman, and the conception of the headman as an official of\r\nGovernment, must be swept away and a new and true conception must be\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nThe village is a self-contained organism, and the headman is its\r\nrepresentative before Government and its executive head, the real power\r\nbeing in the Council.  Powers and responsibility reside in the village\r\nas a whole and in no individual.  The people must not be ruled, but\r\nrule themselves.\r\n\r\nNow as to the exact way in which this conception should be carried out\r\nit is impossible to say.  In each Province--in distinct parts of the\r\nsame Province--the village system assumed different forms to meet\r\ndifferent circumstances.  In Madras the village community was in many\r\ndetails different from that in Burma, and in the North-West still more\r\nso.  Therefore, the particular way in which the conception should be\r\nrealised would vary greatly.  And only by experience could a\r\nsatisfactory form for each Province be evolved.  Neither would it be\r\npossible even in Burma to go back to the old form exactly.  Events have\r\nmarched since then, and what was satisfactory thirty or more years ago\r\nwould not be so now.  The villages must not be reconstituted by copying\r\nthe past; they must be constituted anew, maintaining, however, the\r\nspirit of the past and giving scope for evolution in the future.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the scheme that I am about to unfold must be taken to be\r\nmerely tentative and apply only to Burma.  The principles are, I think,\r\nright; the details must, of course, be discovered by experience.\r\nPractice alone would show how far they realised the objective that is\r\nto be aimed at--the constitution of a village organism on natural lines\r\nthat would govern itself without any need for interference and would be\r\nable to grow and evolve.\r\n\r\nMy scheme is as follows:\r\n\r\nIn every village a Council should be constituted and the headman should\r\nbe its executive head.\r\n\r\nHow this Council should be constituted I do not know.  I think there\r\nshould be wards, each of which should have an elder, representative of\r\nthe people, but no rigid system of election should be laid down.  I\r\nhave found that villages and wards can very often appoint a\r\nrepresentative man by general consent, which is much better than by\r\nelection.  That should only occur in case of a dead-lock.  The Council\r\nshould itself define the wards, and it should be allowed to co-opt\r\nadditional members.  All representation by class or religion should be\r\nprohibited.  The unit is not so many people, but a section of a\r\nvillage--neighbours dwelling together and whose interests are thereby\r\nunited.  Appointment to the Council should be indefinite; that is to\r\nsay, an elder should remain an elder until he resigned or until the\r\nward turned him out.  I don't think they would like continual\r\nelections.  An election is a bad means to a desired end--that of\r\nobtaining the best representative.  And in small communities the sense\r\nis usually apparent without it.\r\n\r\nThe headman should be chosen by the Council from among its members and\r\nhis election confirmed by Government.  His appointment should be\r\naccording to the wish of the Council, that is to say, for life, unless\r\nhe resigned or the Council turned him out.  He should be responsible to\r\nthe Council.  The Council, as representing the village, should be\r\nresponsible to Government, and it would always be possible for the\r\nDeputy Commissioner to bring pressure on a recalcitrant Council by\r\nthreatening to suspend the constitution and place the village under an\r\nappointed headman for a time if they did not carry out their duties\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nTo this village community should be handed over certain duties, rights,\r\nand responsibilities, much what the headman has now, the collection of\r\nrevenue, etc.  All civil, criminal, and revenue cases under certain\r\nvalues and of certain denominations should be handed over to them to\r\ntry; that is to say, that cognisance should be refused by our police\r\nand our Courts, so that the parties could go to the Village Council if\r\nthey liked.  There should be no appeal from the decisions of the\r\nCouncil, no advocates should be allowed, and no record should be\r\nrequired.  All penalties imposed should be paid into the village fund.\r\n\r\nThis fund should exist for all villages, and its nucleus should be,\r\nsay, half an anna in the rupee of the revenue collections, to which\r\nshould be added fines, special rates which the Council should be\r\nempowered to impose for specific purposes, and other forms of revenue\r\nwhich would vary from place to place.  I think a percentage of the\r\ndistrict fund should be given to them.  A rate on inhabited houses--a\r\nrent on house sites--would be a good way of raising money.  The\r\npurposes for which the fund could be used would be water-supply,\r\nsanitation, roads, lighting, watchmen, and so on.  Simple account-books\r\nwould have to be kept, and these accounts would have to be audited once\r\na year.\r\n\r\nModel schemes for sanitation, village roads, etc., could be made out\r\nfor each village to live up to as fast as it could.\r\n\r\nFurther, villages should have the power to carry out irrigation works\r\non their own initiative and under their own control.  I consider this a\r\nmost important proviso, because I know many villages where this could\r\nbe done by the village, whereas it is not possible to individuals.  I\r\nalso know one recent case in my district where it was done with great\r\nsuccess by the headman and elders.  I got them a small grant, and I\r\noften went to see how the work was getting on, but I never interfered\r\nin any way, and the result was most satisfactory.  There was at first a\r\ndifficulty about collecting the rates, because there was no legal\r\nsystem under which a man who used the water could be made to pay.\r\nHowever, this also settled itself.\r\n\r\nIrrigation works, roads, and bridges are most necessary to many\r\nvillages, but now, unless Government carry out the work, there is no\r\none to do it.  And Government will not carry out small works.\r\n\r\nIt is by the execution of such works that the village would prosper and\r\nthe village fund grow.  Loans should be granted for these purposes by\r\nGovernment, to be repaid out of the profits.\r\n\r\nBefore our annexation all works were executed by the villages, and the\r\nconsiderable irrigation works in many places are evidence of their\r\nability.  All this initiative has now been killed.  Yet it is a most\r\nvaluable asset, not only materially, but morally.\r\n\r\nAs regards this fund, it will, I know, be objected by many people that\r\nit will be simply an excuse for peculation.  \"Orientals,\" they say,\r\n\"cannot be honest, and the funds would be misappropriated right and\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\nExactly this same charge was made when the Co-operative Credit Banks\r\nwere started.  Their history will sufficiently refute such an\r\nabsurdity.  Orientals are just as honest as any other people, and,\r\ngiven a good system, village funds will no more be stolen in India or\r\nBurma than municipal funds are in England.\r\n\r\nIn organising these villages there is another point to be borne in\r\nmind.  In that desperate struggle after rigid uniformity which\r\ndistinguishes the Indian Government, every separate hamlet in Burma was\r\nput under a separate headman, and thus made a separate organism.\r\n\r\nNow it may be that occasionally the village was too large, and a\r\ndivision was needed, but in many other cases the disintegration of\r\nlong-established units was severely felt.  Several hamlets may have one\r\ninterest in common.  They may be grouped round a small irrigation work,\r\nor along a stream, or have a fishery in common, or be in other matters\r\nof great use to each other.  If run as separate organisms there is\r\nbound to be strife, each trying for his own benefit.  If allowed to\r\nremain one organism they will be not only more peaceful, but stronger,\r\nand better able to manage their affairs.  Thus the rigid formulæ of\r\nGovernment in this matter as in others should give place to common\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nFurther: in future, villages should be allowed to coalesce if mutual\r\ninterests attract them.  Two or three villages if allowed to combine\r\nwould carry out works that one could not do.\r\n\r\nI see no great difficulty in Burma in thus restoring the organism of\r\nvillage life.  It would require mainly tact on the part of the District\r\nOfficer and ability to let alone.  His tendency now is always to\r\ninterfere if he can.  His rule should be never to interfere if he can\r\nhelp it.  When things go wrong persistently it will probably be found\r\nthat there is something amiss with the way the village is organised,\r\nand that it requires some slight modification.  If a horse can't draw a\r\ncart it is better to see what is wrong with the horse or the cart than\r\ntry to move them both along by turning the wheels round yourself.  You\r\nwon't get far that way.  The more you push the more the horse will jib.\r\nAnd Village Councils will be very willing horses if let alone and the\r\ncart be not too cumbersome or the hill they have to climb too steep.\r\nBut they must be left alone.  Read the history of municipal\r\ninstitutions in England and note the principles.  They are universal.\r\n\r\nOnce the village communities are strong and healthy, a further step\r\ncould be made by instituting a township or sub-divisional Council, and\r\nlater a District Council.\r\n\r\nFor these I am not prepared to offer any suggestions.  It would require\r\na very careful study of local conditions and of the people, a wide\r\nexperience gained from the working of the resuscitated villages, to\r\nknow how these should be constituted and what powers and\r\nresponsibilities should be entrusted to them.  I think a sound analogy\r\nmight be obtained from a study of English counties--not so much perhaps\r\nas they are now, but as they were--in spirit, not in law.\r\n\r\nAfter the village organism was established, perhaps in order to its\r\nproper establishment, a local Government Board would have to be\r\ncreated.  This would have to be in time entirely native to the\r\nProvince.  It is, I think, essential that it should be so.  What its\r\nrelations with the District Officer would be I do not know.  I foresee\r\ndifficulties.  It is essential for good order in the district that\r\nthere be no one between the head and the people.  Nevertheless, I don't\r\nthink he could establish and work the village organism himself.  I\r\nthink he would be too tempted to interfere; and, moreover, there would\r\nhave to be a certain co-ordination between the systems in various\r\ndistricts.  They need not be the same in detail, but the idea should be\r\nthe same.  That is because eventually they must coalesce into bigger\r\norganisms.  But a District Officer with a strong personality would, I\r\nthink, be liable to impress that personality on the village, and as it\r\nmust be self-governing that might create difficulties.  For as the\r\nvillages increased the District Officer would decrease.  Gradually his\r\npowers would devolve on the local organisms.  There would thus be a\r\ncertain rivalry between the District Officer and the local organisms,\r\nwhich, if the officer were the head of both, might result in injury to\r\nthe latter.  Perhaps some such relation as exists between the Land\r\nRecords Department and the District Officer would be possible.  The\r\nLand Records has its own organisation, which works independently of the\r\ndistrict but in harmony with it.  All this, however, is not a matter\r\nwhich can be thought out.  It will have to be worked out, and a correct\r\nsystem can only come little by little, experience showing how\r\nmodifications should be made.  I do not see any great difficulty\r\nprovided there are common sense and unity of aim on both sides.\r\n\r\nAnd from districts--when they had settled down into distinct organisms\r\nmore or less self-governing--representatives, not delegates, could be\r\nsent to a Provincial Council.  Then you would have a real Council, one\r\nrepresentative of the people because proceeding from the people, not\r\nless surely because not directly.  I am not sure that direct election\r\nsuch as is practised in England and America, for instance, does cause\r\nrepresentation of the people.  In England, at all events, it is not so\r\nnow.  The only power the people have now is to choose between the\r\ndelegates of two or more parties.  Beyond this they have no voice nor\r\nchoice.  They cannot find any expression for their own wishes.  Their\r\nmember may be, probably is, a man they never heard of before the\r\n\"Party\" sent him to contest the seat.  There is, in fact, in England\r\nto-day no real representation of the people at all.  By people, of\r\ncourse, I mean the people as a whole, including all classes.  But under\r\nsome such scheme as I have sketched out for Burma there would be real\r\nrepresentation of the people, of localities as a whole, units; local\r\nmen acquainted with the local conditions would be chosen and not\r\npleaders, and the locality would hold them responsible.  Thus the\r\nopinion of such a Council would represent the wishes of the people; it\r\ncould be depended on, and to it could considerable powers be delegated\r\npermanently.  It would, in fact, in time constitute a Provincial\r\nGovernment in federal relations with the other Provincial Governments.\r\nThat is the only possible way that a real government can be built up.\r\n\r\nAnd it must always be remembered that the basis is the Village.  On the\r\nhealth of the Village all other things depend; from the healthy working\r\nof the Village all things may proceed.  It is the first but not last\r\nword in local self-government.\r\n\r\nA very integral part of any self-government is Education, and to that I\r\ncome in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nTo the success of any form of self-government a good education is\r\nabsolutely essential; that a people should be able to exercise\r\nself-government it is necessary that they be educated to\r\nself-government; for this capacity no more comes by itself than ability\r\nto build a ship or steer it when built.  And as the government must be\r\nself-government, so the education must be a national education and not\r\nan imported one.\r\n\r\nI have already had something to say on this subject in former chapters\r\nwhen writing of the Indian civilian, and the principles which underlie\r\ngood education are the same everywhere.  A well-educated man is he in\r\nwhom his mental and physical powers have been so brought out that he\r\ncan face the ordinary vicissitudes of his life with confidence, that he\r\ncan understand them and combat them materially to the best of his\r\nability, and that when materially defeated he may still rise\r\nspiritually above all defeat and discouragement.  Education is\r\nnecessary to everyone--man or woman, peasant or prince, merchant or\r\nartisan--and that man is best educated who can make the best of his\r\nlife whatever its station may be.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that education is mainly relative.  A man who\r\nwould be well educated if in one station of life would be hopelessly\r\nignorant if in another.  I doubt if Whewell would have been considered\r\neducated had fate suddenly made him a soldier, a political officer on a\r\nfrontier, or a cultivator.  A keen eye gained by experience for market\r\nfluctuations is better for a merchant than all the learning of all the\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nBut this specialisation belongs properly to higher education.  There\r\nare certain foundation principles necessary to any success in life, to\r\nbeing able to live it in whatever station with dignity and with\r\nprosperity.  What are those principles?\r\n\r\nI think the Indian Education Department would say that these are\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic--that is to say, acquirements.  I\r\nshould say they are qualities of character.\r\n\r\nWhat are these qualities?\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost is belief in his own people, not his caste or his\r\ncreed, but in the people who inhabit his Province, who will eventually\r\nmake up his nationality.  If the man is to do good work for his people\r\nthe boy must desire to do good work--he must have a certainty in the\r\nunlimited possibilities of his people, that though they may be young\r\nnow they will grow to a world stature.  Therefore, that it is his duty\r\nto help them.  He must be sure that this world is good--to be made\r\nbetter by him and his fellows and his descendants.  He has inherited\r\nmuch; he must hand on more.  He has no right to live unless he does his\r\nduty to life and in life--that is to say, he must have a purpose in\r\nlife, for without a purpose life cannot be lived.\r\n\r\nSecondly, he must see that to the accomplishment of his purpose, which\r\nis but part of the World's Purpose, he must cultivate two qualities,\r\nobedience in act and freedom of thought.  He must learn to obey,\r\nbecause he must see for himself that only by men acting together under\r\nauthority can anything be achieved.  His obedience will then be a\r\nwilling and cheerful obedience, because necessary to his own purpose.\r\nHe must obey that later he may be obeyed.  He must keep his mind free,\r\nbecause to admit authority in thought is to kill thought.  He must see\r\nthings for himself and judge for himself, that when he is able to act\r\nfor himself he may do so on truth and not on hearsay.  He must learn to\r\nrespect the opinions of others which they have founded also on\r\nexperience, while not necessarily adopting them, because he may see\r\nthings differently.\r\n\r\nHe must learn self-knowledge to recognise what he can do and what he\r\ncan't.\r\n\r\nHe should cultivate self-command that must not mean self-extinction.\r\n\r\nOn a base like this all other things come naturally.\r\n\r\nIs there any such ideal in elementary education in India?  I can safely\r\nsay that there is no such ideal.  All that the Department seeks to do\r\nis to stuff a child with reading, writing, and arithmetic, and other\r\nlearning, regardless of his character or his objective in life.\r\n\r\nTherefore elementary education is not popular in Burma, because it\r\nseems to have no good purpose.\r\n\r\nThat was true of education before we took the country.  It was then\r\nmainly, for boys, in the hands of monks, and I do not think that\r\neducation when controlled by religion has been popular anywhere in the\r\nworld.  It has been accepted because there was no other means of\r\neducation available, but it was not admired.  Our Government has\r\naccepted the monastery schools, and it has also encouraged lay schools,\r\nbut neither seem to give much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNow this is not the place to discuss religion of any kind, and I have\r\nno intention of entering into such a vexed question.  There are good\r\nthings in all religions--borrowed from humanity; there are doubtful\r\nthings; there are bad things.  But the foundation of every religion is\r\na declaration that this world is evil and that we should despise it.\r\nNow the objective of all education is to fit a boy for his life, and he\r\ncannot be so fit if he despise life.  He must love it, admire it,\r\ndesire in all ways to help it, to increase it, beautify it.  His\r\nobjective must be in this life.  Further, the tendency of all faiths is\r\nto raise barriers between races and castes.  But it is an essential\r\npart of any true education that a boy understand that in striving for\r\nthe good of the community he must ignore all differences.  Humanity is\r\none, and the God of Humanity is One, whatever faiths may say.\r\n\r\nThus religions when mixed with education have a paralysing effect.  I\r\nhave often heard this said in Burma.  Here is a conversation I once had\r\nat a village I knew very well.  It occurred, as did most of the talks I\r\nhad with the people, just after sunset, when I had my chair set outside\r\nmy rest-house, and the people came dropping in to gossip.  There were a\r\nnumber of people, the headman, elders, their wives and children, and\r\ntwo monks from a neighbouring monastery.  They talked quite freely\r\nbecause they knew that after office hours I forgot I was an official,\r\nor even an Englishman, and just talked to them as one human being to\r\nanother.  I may add that I had been inspecting the village school where\r\nlittle boys and girls learned together.  I had also been to a monastery\r\nwhere the elder boys went.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"what is the news?\"\r\n\r\nThere was an expectant silence.  Evidently there was some news; the\r\nquestion was--who should tell it?\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Headman?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe Headman rubbed an ankle reflectively.  \"The fact is,\" he answered,\r\n\"there is no news that would interest your Honour; only just village\r\ndoings, foolish doings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum,\" I said; \"that sounds to me as if a young man had been doing\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men smiled--\"Possibly with the assistance of a\r\ngirl\"--and I glanced at some girls.  They giggled, and the Headman said\r\nbriefly:\r\n\r\n\"Maung Ka's son has run off with a girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" I said, turning to Maung Ka, whom I knew well enough--a tall,\r\nfine-looking man, who was looking very gloomy.  \"It's a way boys have.\r\nThere's no harm in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if he can support her afterwards,\" said Maung Ka gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"Can't he do that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nIt appeared he couldn't.  He had spent all his boyhood in a monastery\r\n\"learning\" till his father fetched him out.  Then he went to the other\r\nextreme and levanted with a girl.  \"He doesn't know one end of a\r\nbullock from the other,\" said the father; \"he can't plough or sow; he\r\ncan't work; he has no common sense.  That's what schooling does for a\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the other men agreed with him, and we had a discussion on\r\neducation, in which everyone took part.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion was that schooling should be to fit you for life.\r\nThe monks said for eternity, but the villagers--though out of respect\r\nfor the monks they said little--evidently didn't make any such\r\ndistinction.  What wasn't fit for time wasn't fit for eternity.\r\nReading, writing, and arithmetic were good, because a boy needed these.\r\nBeyond that they seemed to think schooling did harm.  A boy learned\r\nmore from his father and the other villagers than from school.  As to a\r\ngirl, \"What,\" asked an elder indignantly, \"is the use of a girl\r\nlearning to write?  What will she write?  Love-letters only.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I asked, \"and isn't that good--for the boy who gets them?\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the villagers are plain, common-sense men and women, and\r\nwhat they want for their children is that they be better fitted for the\r\nstruggle of life.  They do not observe that to be the case at present.\r\nThey judge by results, and the results are not good, they say.\r\n\r\nIn fact, except as to the actual acquisition of reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic, which may or may not be of much use, the teaching--and\r\nstill more than the teaching, the influence--is bad.  It unfits for\r\nlife, it gives wrong ideals, or it kills all ideals.\r\n\r\nThe higher education is, I think, worse.  It follows an imported\r\nsystem, and in the importation all the good is left out.  In England a\r\nboy's real education comes from association with the other boys and\r\nfrom his father.  From them he learns whatever he does learn of\r\nconduct, of ambition to true ends, of acting in concert, of ability to\r\njudge for himself and stick up for himself.\r\n\r\nIn India a wrong ideal has been conceived from the beginning.  It has\r\nbeen assumed, tacitly maybe, that an Englishman is the final and\r\ncompletely perfected work of God and man, and that all nations should\r\ncopy him and try to become, if not a sterling Englishman, at least an\r\nelectro-plate one.\r\n\r\nThat is disastrous.  It depresses the people by depreciating their own\r\nraces and holding up an objective which is impossible, and if possible\r\nwould be wrong.\r\n\r\nThere are in the pasts of nearly all Oriental people ideals which are\r\nquite as good as ours, and far better fitted for them.  Are these ever\r\ntaught to them?  India once led the civilisation of the world; is that\r\npast ever brought up and explained and realised for them?  Never, I\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nFurther, higher education to be of any use must be objective.  You must\r\nknow what you want the boy to be.  What does Government want the\r\nproducts of its higher education to be?  I have no idea.  Has the\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\nOf what use are these products of the higher education in India?  They\r\nare useful but for two things, to be lawyers or pleaders, or to be\r\nclerks.  They are dealers in words, and not in facts or in humanity.\r\n\r\nGovernment accepts a certain number into its service, because the first\r\nideal of Government is a man who can fill up forms and returns,\r\nspeedily, accurately, and punctually.  They can do that.  When they\r\nhave district work to do they fail, because they have no personality,\r\nno freedom of thought, and because the people despise them.  The old\r\nofficials whom we took over from the Burmese Government, whatever their\r\ndefects, had \"auza\"--personality.  It is a commonplace to say that the\r\nBurmese have deteriorated.  That is not true.  They have as much\r\npotentiality as before, but this potentiality is wiped out by\r\n\"education.\"  Far from being really educated, they are merely stuffed,\r\nand their natural abilities stifled.  Moreover, they cease to be\r\nBurmans, or Madrassis, or Bengalis, and become a sort of hybrid.  This\r\nis due to their English masters, who are obsessed with the idea that\r\nthe only way to \"educate\" anyone is to turn him into a plaster\r\nEnglishman.  I have had some experience of these unfortunate boys who\r\nhave taken degrees.\r\n\r\nPersonally, if I had to administer a difficult district, I should\r\nchoose my Burmese assistants from men who had never been to school, and\r\nto satisfy Government I would engage some B.A.'s and F.A.'s to be their\r\nclerks and fill up the forms.  I should be sorry for the B.A.'s,\r\nbecause I think they have as good stuff in them as the others, but\r\ntheir want of education has unfitted them for work requiring \"auza.\"\r\n\r\nThat is really what it amounts to; the school-trained boy is not\r\neducated, whereas the boy brought up in contact with the world is\r\nperforce educated.  The first is a hothouse plant; the second a useful\r\nfield plant.\r\n\r\nI am aware that current opinion puts down the failure of the educated\r\nyoung Indian to his want of religion.  He has been educated out of his\r\nown faith and not accepted into any other; hence his want of character.\r\nOf all the wild shibboleths about India and the Indians this is, I\r\nthink, the wildest.  That a man is injured by being brought to see the\r\nfoolishness of caste, of infant marriage, of harems and zenanas, of all\r\nthe forms and ceremonies with which all religions are covered, seems to\r\nme a triumph of illogic.  Only the \"Occidental mind\" at its best could\r\nconceive such an idea.  In so far as education destroys these ideas it\r\ndoes good.  Wherein it harms him is by taking him apart from his\r\npeople, rendering him not desirous to help them but to disown them.  He\r\nis taught that to be an Englishman should be his ideal--that he \"should\r\ncultivate English habits of thought\"--as if true thought had any\r\nhabits--so that, finally, he can't think at all.  He is directed to\r\nwrong ideals; he is rendered unhappy; he is _dépaysé_; he is useless\r\nfor any work, except being a clerk or lawyer; he has no more character\r\nthan a jelly-fish.  Instead of wishing to lead his people he wishes to\r\nidentify himself with the English Government, be a civilian, and rule\r\nhis people.  He should be filled with a boundless confidence in the\r\nfuture of his people, and that it is his duty to help that future to be\r\nrealised.  He is discouraged and rendered hopeless.  Instead of being a\r\nhelp he is the greatest danger his own people will have to meet when\r\nthey move forward.  He is a danger to all.\r\n\r\nThe Education Department of the Government of India is the new\r\nFrankenstein, and the Higher Education is its monster.  The students\r\nhave sunk under their \"education,\" and in consequence they are unhappy.\r\nWho wonders?  But, in fact, an alien Power cannot introduce or work any\r\nreal system of education.  It must be indigenous--something of the\r\nsoil, and not exotic.  It, like self-government, must begin with small\r\nthings in the village and gradually rise.\r\n\r\nLike all things, if it is to live and prosper and extend it must have a\r\nsoul.  And the soul of education, like the soul of life, is an emotion\r\ntending towards a _desired_ end.  The desired end of education is the\r\nrise and progress not merely of the individual but of the nation.  That\r\nhas been the soul of the progress of Japan; that must be the soul of\r\nthe progress of any people; and education will only be enthusiastically\r\ntaken up when it is seen to be a means to that end.\r\n\r\nSuch an education cannot be given by Englishmen.  Any Education\r\nDepartment must be Provincial and draw its vigour from below.  It must\r\nnot be a machine governed from Simla with text-books as thumbscrews and\r\nmanuals as beds of Procrustes.\r\n\r\nBefore there can be a real Education Department it must be entirely\r\nnative of the Province, responsible to the Province for its success.\r\nCan we create such a Department?  I think we could, slowly, by handing\r\nour village schools as much as possible to Village Councils, district\r\nschools to District Councils, and the University to the head Provincial\r\nAssembly when it comes into being.  They will each have to think out\r\nwhat result they want, and then how to attain that result.\r\n\r\nBut all must begin with the village; within it alone is the germ cell\r\nof all future progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThere are many other subjects connected with the renaissance of India\r\nthat I should like to enter into, but I cannot do so here.  This book\r\nis already too full of matter that is never easy, and is sometimes\r\ncontroversial.  Such subjects are the real ideals and ideas that\r\nunderlay the religions of India, Hindu, and Mohammedan, and which gave\r\nthem life until they were hidden under priest-made ritual and killed;\r\nthe early history of India as a history of ideas and civilisations, and\r\nnot a stupid agglomeration of battles and intrigues; the absolute\r\nnecessity, as shown in all history, of representation and legislation\r\nbeing by territory, and not by class, nor race, nor religion; and there\r\nare many others.  Perhaps some day I may return to these matters, or,\r\nmore happily, other writers will undertake them.  They will see the\r\ninterest and pleasure to be derived from the study of humanity and\r\nideas, and will leave on one side the dusty frippery of ceremonies and\r\ncreeds and customs, of the details of battles and palace intrigues and\r\ndynasties.  Life lies under all these things, and they but affect it as\r\nold clothes do a man.  Meanwhile, I have done what I can to show the\r\ncauses of the trouble in India and to indicate in what way it may be\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nOnly in some such way as that I have sketched, only by following\r\nprinciples of the nature here indicated, can the Government of India be\r\ndrawn into accordance with the people.  The Government must learn to\r\nunderstand those many millions over whom it has acquired so great a\r\npower, and in understanding them acquire sympathy with their desires\r\nand needs.  The people must learn to know, and recognise, and feel that\r\nGovernment does understand them; that it has sympathy with them, and\r\nwill help them onward to that goal whither their Destiny is calling\r\nthem.  So will both work together toward that end.\r\n\r\nTo conquer India was great; it is the one great deed whereby we shall\r\nlive in history; but to make of India a daughter, not a subject, to\r\nhelp her grow out of our care till she is strong enough to walk alone,\r\nthat will be greater still.\r\n\r\nNo nation in the world's history has ever done a deed like that.\r\n\r\nTo conquer India required great courage, it required ability of the\r\nhighest, it needed self-denial, self-sacrifice of the individual for\r\nthe nation.  What will the freedom of India need in us?  It will need\r\nqualities higher even than these are.  It will need courage, as great\r\nas or greater even than that which we have shown before--the courage to\r\nleave alone; it will require self-abnegation and self-sacrifice, not\r\nfor our own nation, but for India, for Humanity; it will require a\r\nsympathy and understanding such as no nation has ever yet felt for a\r\nforeign people.\r\n\r\nCan we do this?\r\n\r\nI do not know.  Can we with whom representation except of the\r\nwire-pullers of the party has ceased to exist, in whose schools of all\r\nkinds and in whose universities there is no education, whose legal\r\nsystem is bad beyond all expression, who have under free forms less\r\nreal freedom than most other countries, can we give to India what we\r\nhave not?  I think that we shall have to take the beam out of our own\r\neye first.  Are we prepared to do that?\r\n\r\nWhat will it need in India?  It will need courage too, it will need\r\nself-restraint not less than that which we shall have to show, the\r\ncourage to go slowly, to restrain the rising tide within the banks of\r\nsafety, to so direct it that the flood will fertilise, not destroy.\r\n\r\nIt will need more than this.  What ruined India twice, and what ruins\r\nher now?  Division.  Race, caste and creed are curses when they make\r\none man despise or hate another.  There is one God.  Brahma and Allah\r\nand Jehovah are but names for One if truly seen.  His kingdom is in\r\nneither Church nor creed nor Prophet, neither in temple nor in holy\r\nplace, but in the hearts of men--all men.  If you read truly you will\r\nsee that in the beginning all religions were ideas, great streams of\r\nhope and truth driving to one ideal.  All truth which is a living truth\r\nis One.  But formulæ and castes and creeds and ceremonies and forms,\r\nrites of all kinds, are priest-made things that kill and petrify.  All\r\nsouls come here from God; not Brahmin souls nor Pongyis' souls nor\r\nChristian souls alone, but every soul in every man that lives, they\r\ncome from God and so return.  They are part with us of the eternal \"I\"\r\nin which are lost all \"yous\" or \"theys.\"  Can the Brahmins forget their\r\nlegendary pride and prove their vaunted worth by leading India to an\r\nequal freedom and not keeping her back by the slavery they have thrown\r\nupon her?  Can the Moslem, casting off the mould of dead tradition,\r\nremember the Omniades, their tolerance, their wisdom, their\r\ncivilisation; what they did and, above all, what they did not do?\r\n\r\nCan the Buddhist believe that life is good--not evil; to be made the\r\nmost of, not feared nor shunned? to be loved and lived?\r\n\r\nI do not know.  These things are all upon the knees of God.\r\n\r\nBut for a real new India to arise all these things must come to pass.\r\nShe is now India Irredenta.  And to be redeemed all Indians must offer\r\nup as sacrifice, not their good things, but all those evil things they\r\ncling to blindly--their hates and their divisions, their pride in what\r\nthey should be thoroughly ashamed of, their quarrels and\r\nmisunderstandings.  There were a sacrifice that God would love.\r\n\r\nWill it come to pass?  Who knows?  We can only do our best--all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINTED BY\r\n  WILLIAM BRENDON AND SON, LTD.\r\n  PLYMOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD SOUL\r\n\r\nBy H.

Like\r\nthe fly on the wheel, if I did not help much in the revolution I had a\r\nchance of seeing how it went round.  I have been mixed up in many\r\nexciting events, I have met many remarkable men.  Gladstone and other\r\nleaders of the Liberal party were familiar to me during my time in\r\nParliament.  With Parnell I had at least one very remarkable interview.\r\nJustin McCarthy, William O'Brien, John Dillon, T. P. O'Connor and other\r\nIrish leaders I can count as personal friends.  I had an interview with\r\nLeo XIII. at the Vatican and with Roosevelt at the White House.  I\r\nthink I may fairly claim an unique experience of the stage.  All the\r\ngreat actors of the present generation I have seen on the boards and\r\ngossiped with behind the scenes.  Of the Irish Judges and leaders of\r\nthe Irish Bar I have many stories to tell from hearsay or from personal\r\nknowledge.  Some slight description of the manner of life on the Irish\r\nPress and at the Irish Bar may not be wholly without interest and\r\npossibly a few new characters worth knowing may be introduced to the\r\nreader.  For the rest it is gossip, rather than history I have written,\r\ngiving the go-by for the most part to serious events and retailing the\r\nhumorous stories or amusing incidents that have come my way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH SIBERIA\r\n\r\nAN EMPIRE IN THE MAKING\r\n\r\nBy R. L. WRIGHT and BASSETT DIGBY\r\n\r\n_In Demy 8vo, Cloth gilt, with 70 Illustrations; 10s. 6d. net._\r\n\r\nThe authors of this book crossed Siberia with only one passport between\r\nthem: they travelled by rail on the Trans-Siberian, by sledge across\r\nthe frozen steppes and through pine forests where the wolf packs are\r\nstill a menace, by boat down the ice-choked Shilka and Amur rivers to\r\nthe Manchurian border.  They lived and travelled with all sorts of\r\npeople and saw the country as it really is.  There is a chapter on the\r\ncolonization of Siberia by the Russian Government, which promises to be\r\none of the really great achievements in this world's history, while the\r\nplague-ridden districts of Manchuria are vividly portrayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN MEDITERRANEAN\r\n\r\nBy STEPHEN BONSALL\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"The Golden Horseshoe,\" etc.\r\n\r\n_With 16 Illustrations from Photographs and 2 Maps in colours._\r\n\r\n12s. 6d. _net_.\r\n\r\n\"An interesting account with much information about the West Indies,\r\nabout 'Venezuela To-day,' the state of Mexico, and the making of the\r\nPanama Canal.
