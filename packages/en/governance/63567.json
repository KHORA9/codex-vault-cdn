For the preventing of those\r\nmiserable effects which such malicious endeavors may produce, We have\r\nthought good to declare,\r\n\r\n1. _The root, and the growth of these mischievous designes._\r\n\r\n2. _The Maturity and ripenesse, to which they have attained before the\r\nbeginning of the Parliament._\r\n\r\n3. _The effectuall means which have been used for the exterpations of\r\nthose dangerous evils, and the Progresse which hath therein been made\r\nby His Majesties goodnesse, and the wisedome of the Parliament._\r\n\r\n4. _The wayes of obstruction and opposition, by which that Progresse\r\nhath been interrupted._\r\n\r\n5. _The courses to be taken for the removing those obstacles, and\r\nfor the accomplishing of our most dutifull and faithfull intentions,\r\nand endeavors, of restoring and establishing the ancient Honour,\r\nGreatnesse, and Security of this Crown and Nation. The root of all\r\nthis mischief We finde to be a malignant and pernitious designe of\r\nsubverting the Fundamentall Lawes, and principles of Government; upon\r\nwhich the Religion, and Justice of this Kingdom are firmly establisht.\r\nThe Actors and Promoters hereof have been,_\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The Jesuited Papists who hate the Laws, as the Obstacles of that\r\nchange and Subversion of Religion, which they so much long for._\r\n\r\n2. _The Bishops, and the corrupt part of the Clergie, who cherish\r\nformality and superstition, as the naturall effects, and more probable\r\nsupports of their own Ecclesiasticall Tyranny, and Usurpation._\r\n\r\n3. _Such Councellors and Courtiers, as for private ends have engaged\r\nthemselves to further the intrests of some forraign Princes or States,\r\nto the prejudice of His Majesty, and the state at home._\r\n\r\nThe common Principles by which they moulded and governed all their\r\nparticular Councells and actions were these.\r\n\r\n_First, To maintain continuall differences and discontents betwixt the\r\nKing and the People, upon questions and Prerogative, and liberty, that\r\nso they might have the advantage of sideing with him, and under the\r\nNotions of Men addicted to his service, gain to themselves and their\r\nparties, the places of greatest trust and power in the Kingdom._\r\n\r\n_A Second, To suppresse the purity and power of Religion, and such\r\npersons as were best affected to it; as being contrary to their own\r\nends, and the greatest impediment to that change, which they thought to\r\nintroduce._\r\n\r\n_A Third, To conjoyn those parties of the Kingdom, which were most\r\npropitious to their own ends, and to divide those who were most\r\nopposite, which consisted in many particular observations to cherish\r\nthe Arminian part in those points, wherein they agree with the Papists,\r\nto multiply and enlarge the differences betwixt the common Protestants,\r\nand those whom they call Puritans, to introduce and countenance such\r\nopinions and Ceremonies as are fittest for accommodation with Popery,\r\nto encrease and maintain ignorance, loosenesse, and prophanenesse\r\nin the people: That of those three parties, Papists, Arminians and\r\nLibertines, they might compose a body fit to act such Counsells and\r\nresolutions, as were most conducible to their own ends._\r\n\r\n_A Fourth, To disaffect the King to Parliaments by slanders and false\r\nimputations, and by putting him upon other wayes of supply, which in\r\nshew and appearance were fuller of advantage, then the ordinary course\r\nof Subsidies, though in truth they brought more losse then gain, both\r\nto the King and people, and have caused the great distractions, under\r\nwhich we both suffer._\r\n\r\n\r\nAS in all compounded bodies, the Operations are qualified according to\r\nthe predominant Element; So in this mixt party, the Jesuited Councells\r\nbeing most active, and prevailing, may easily be discovered to have\r\nhad the greatest sway in all their determinations, and if they be not\r\nprevented, are likely to devour the rest, or to turn them into their\r\nown nature.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of His Majesties raign, the partie begun to revive and\r\nflourish again, having been somewhat dampt by the breach with _Spain_\r\nin the last yeer of King _James_, and by His Majesties marriage\r\nwith _France_; the interests and Councells of that State, being not so\r\ncontrary to the good of Religion, and the prosperity of this Kingdom,\r\nas those of _Spain_, and the Papists of _England_ having been ever more\r\naddicted to _Spain_, then _France_; Yet they still retained a purpose,\r\nand resolution to weaken the Protestant parties in all parts, and even\r\nin _France_, whereby to make way for the change of Religion, which they\r\nintended at home.\r\n\r\nThe first effect and evidence of their recovery and strength was, the\r\ndissolution of the Parliament at _Oxford_, after there had been given\r\ntwo Subsidies to His Majestie; and before they received relief in\r\nany one Grievance, many other more miserable effects followed. The\r\nlosse of the _Rochel_ Fleet, by the help of our Shipping set forth\r\nand delivered over to the _French_, in opposition to the advice of\r\nParliament, which left that Town without defence by Sea, and made way\r\nnot only to the losse of that important place, but likewise to the\r\nlosse of all the strength and security of the Protestant Religion\r\nin _France_. The diverting of His Majesties course of warres from\r\nthe West-_Indies_, which was the most facile and hopefull way for\r\nthis Kingdom to prevail against the Spaniard, to an expensefull and\r\nsuccesselesse attempt upon _Cales_, which was so ordered, as if it had\r\nrather been intended to make us weary of Warre, then to prosper in\r\nit. The precipitate breach which _France_ by taking their Ships to a\r\ngreat value, without making recompence to the _English_, whose goods\r\nwere thereupon imbar’d, and confiscate in that Kingdom. The peace with\r\n_Spain_ without consent of Parliament, contrary to the promise of King\r\n_James_, to both Houses; whereby the _Palatine_ cause was diserted and\r\nleft to chargeable, and hopelesse Treaties, which for the most part\r\nwere managed by those who might justly be suspected to be no friends to\r\nthat cause.\r\n\r\nThe charging of the Kingdom with Billetted Souldiers in all parts of\r\nit, and that Concomitant designe of _Germane_ horse, that the Land\r\nmight either submit with fear, or be enforced with rigour to such\r\nArbitrary Contributions, as should be required of them. The dissolving\r\nof the Parliament in the second yeer of His Majesties raign, after a\r\nDeclaration of their intent, to grant five Subsidies.\r\n\r\nThe exacting of the like proportion of five Subsidies after the\r\nParliament dissolved, by Commission of Loan; and divers Gentlemen and\r\nothers imprisoned for not yeilding to pay that Loan, whereby many of\r\nthem contracted such sicknesses, as cost them their lives. Great summes\r\nof Money required and raised by Privy Seals. An unjust and pernicious\r\nattempt to extort great payments from the subject, by way of _Excise_;\r\nand a Commission issued under Seal to that purpose. The Petition of\r\nRight, which was granted in full Parliament, blasted with an illegall\r\nDeclaration, to make it destructive to it self, to the power of\r\nParliament, to the Liberty of the Subject, and to that purpose printed\r\nwith it; and the Petition made of no use, but to shew the bold and\r\npresumptuous injustice of such Ministers as durst break the Laws, and\r\nsuppresse the Liberties of the Kingdom, after they had been so solemnly\r\nand evidently declared.\r\n\r\nAnother Parliament dissolved, 4 _Car._ the priviledge of Parliament\r\nbroken, by imprisoning divers Members of the House, detaining them\r\nclose prisoners for many months together, without the liberty of using\r\nBooks, Pen, Inke, or Paper, denying them all the comforts of life, all\r\nmeans of preservation of health, not permitting their wives to come\r\nunto them, even in time of their sicknesse. And for the compleating of\r\nthat cruelty, after yeers spent in such miserable durance, depriving\r\nthem of the necessary means of Spirituall consolation, not suffering\r\nthem to go abroad to enjoy Gods Ordinances, in Gods House, or Gods\r\nMinisters to come to them, to administer comfort unto them in their\r\nprivate Chambers: and to keep them still in this oppressed condition,\r\nnot admitting them to be Bayled according to Law, yet vexing them\r\nwith Informations in inferiour Courts, sentencing and fining some of\r\nthem for matters done in Parliament, and extorting the payments of\r\nthose Fines from them, enforcing others to put in security of good\r\nbehaviour, before they could be released.\r\n\r\nThe imprisonment of the rest which refused to be bound, still\r\ncontinued; which might have been perpetuall, if necessity had not, the\r\nlast yeer, brought another Parliament to relieve them; of whom, one\r\ndied, by the cruelty and harshnesse of his imprisonment, which would\r\nadmit of no relaxation, notwithstanding the imminent danger of his\r\nlife, did sufficiently appear by the declaration of his Physitian:\r\nAnd his release, or at least, his refreshment, was sought by many\r\nhumble Petitions. And his blood still cries either for vengeance, or\r\nrepentance of those Ministers of State, who at once obstructed the\r\ncourse, both of his Majesties Justice and Mercy.\r\n\r\nUpon the dissolution of both these Parliaments, untrue and scandalous\r\ndeclarations published, to asperse their proceedings, and some of their\r\nMembers, unjustly to make them odious, and colour the violence which\r\nwas used against them. Proclamations set out to the same purpose; and\r\nto the great dejecting of the hearts of the people, forbidding them,\r\neven to speak of Parliaments.\r\n\r\nAfter the breach of the Parliament, in the fourth yeer of his Majesty,\r\nInjustice, Oppression, and Violence, broke in upon us, without any\r\nrestraint or moderation; & yet the first project, was the great sums\r\nexacted thorow the whole Kingdom, for default of Knight-hood, which\r\nseemed to have some colour and shadow of a Law; yet if it be rightly\r\nexamined by that obsolete Law which was pretended for it, it would be\r\nfound to be against all the rules of Justice, both in respect of the\r\npersons charged, the proportion of the Fines demanded, and the absurd\r\nand unreasonable manner of their proceedings.\r\n\r\nTonnage and Poundage hath been received without colour or pretence of\r\nLaw: Many other heavy impositions continued against Law; and some so\r\nunreasonable, that the summe of the charge, exceeds the value of the\r\nGoods. The Book of Rates lately inhansed to a high proportion; and\r\nsuch Merchants as would not submit to their illegall and unreasonable\r\npayments, were vexed and oppressed above measure; and the ordinary\r\ncourse of Justice, the common Birth-right of the subject of _England_,\r\nwholly obstructed unto them. And although all this was taken upon\r\npretence of guarding the Sea, yet a new and unheard of Tax of\r\nShip-money was devised, upon the same pretence. By both which, there\r\nwas charged upon the subject neer 700000 l. some yeers; and yet the\r\nMerchants have been left so naked to the violence of the Turkish\r\nPyrats, that many great Ships of value, and thousands of his Majesties\r\nsubjects have been taken by them, and do still remain in miserable\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of Forrests, contrary to _Charta de Foresta_, and the\r\ncomposition thereupon. The exactions of Coat and Conduct-money, and\r\ndivers other Military charges. The taking away the Arms of the Trayned\r\nBands of divers Counties. The desperate design of engrossing all the\r\nGun-powder into one hand, keeping it in the Tower of _London_, and\r\nsetting so high a Rate upon it, that the poorer sort were not able to\r\nbuy it, nor could any have it without License; thereby to leave the\r\nseverall parts of the Kingdom destitute of their necessary defense;\r\nand by selling so dear that which was sold, to make an unlawfull\r\nadvantage of it, to the great charge and detriment of the subject,\r\nthe generall destruction of the Kings Timber, especially that in the\r\nForrest of _Dean_, sold to Papists, which was the best Store-house of\r\nthis Kingdom, for the maintenance of our Shipping. The taking away of\r\nmens right, under colour of the Kings title to Land between high and\r\nlow water-Marks. The Monopolies of Sope, Salt, Wine, Leather, Sea-Cole,\r\nand, in a manner, of all things of most common and necessary use. The\r\nrestraint of the Liberties of the subjects in their habitation, Trades,\r\nand other Interests. Their vexation and oppression by Purveyors, Clerks\r\nof the Market, and Salt-Peeter-men. The sale of pretended Nuzances, as\r\nBuildings in and about _London_, conversion of Arrable into Pasture;\r\ncontinuance of Pasture, under the name of depopulation, Have drawn many\r\nMillions out of the subjects Purses, without any considerable profit\r\nto his Majesty. Large quantities of Common, and severall Grounds, have\r\nbeen taken from the subject, by colour of the Statute of Improvement,\r\nand by abuse of the Commission of Sewers, without their consent, and\r\nagainst it. And not onely private Interest, but also publike faith\r\nhave been broken, in seizing of the money and Bullion in the Mint;\r\nand the whole Kingdom like to be robb’d at once, in that abominable\r\nproject of Brasse Money. Great numbers of his Majesties subjects,\r\nfor refusing those unlawfull charges, have been vext with long and\r\nexpensive suits; some fined and censured, others committed to long and\r\nhard imprisonments and confinements, to the losse of health of many, of\r\nlife in some; and others have had their houses broken up, their goods\r\nseized; some have been restrained from their lawfull Callings: Ships\r\nhave been interrupted in their Voyages; surprized at Sea in an Hostile\r\nmanner, by Projectors, as by a common Enemy: Merchants prohibited to\r\nunlade their Goods in such Ports, as were for their own advantage, and\r\nforced to bring them to those places which were most for the advantages\r\nof the Monopolizers and Projectors.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Starchamber hath abounded in extravagant Censures, not\r\nonly for the maintenance and improvement of Monopolies, and other\r\nunlawfull taxes; but for divers other Causes, where there hath been\r\nno offence, or very small; whereby His Majesties Subjects have been\r\noppressed by grievous Fines, Imprisonments, Stigmatizings, Mutilations,\r\nWhippings, Pillories, Gags, Confinements, Banishments; after so rigid\r\na manner, as hath not only deprived Men of the Society of their\r\nFriends, exercise of their Professions, comfort of Books, use of Paper\r\nor Inke, but even violated that neer Union which God hath establisht\r\nbetwixt Men and their Wives, by forced and constrained seperation;\r\nwhereby they have been bereaved of the comfort and conversation one\r\nof another, for many yeers together, without hope of relief; if God\r\nhad not by his over-ruling Providence, given some interruption to\r\nthe prevailing power and Councell of those, who were the Authors and\r\nPromoters of such peremptory and headdy courses.\r\n\r\nJudges have been put out of their places, for refusing to do against\r\ntheir Oathes, and Consciences: Others have been so awed, that they\r\ndurst not do their duties, and the better to hold a rod over them, the\r\nClause _quam diu se bene gesserit_ was left out of their Patents, and a\r\nnew Clause _Durante bene placito_ inserted. Lawyers have been checkt,\r\nfor being faithfull to their Clients; Sollicitors, and Atturneyes\r\nhave been threatned, and some punished for following lawfull Suites:\r\nAnd by this means all the approaches to Justice were interrupted and\r\nforecluded. New Oaths have been forced upon the Subject against Law;\r\nnew Judicatories erected without Law: The Councell Table have, by their\r\nOrders, offered to binde the Subjects in their free-holds Estates,\r\nSuites, and Actions. The pretended Court of the Earl _Marshal_ was\r\nArbitrary, and Illegall in its being, and proceedings. The Chancery,\r\nExchequer-Chamber, Court of Wards, and other _English_ Courts have been\r\ngrievous in exceeding their Jurisdiction. The estate of many Families\r\nweakned, and some ruined by excessive Fines, exacted from them for\r\nCompositions of Wardships. All Leases of above a hundred yeers, made\r\nto draw on Wardship contrary to Law. Undue proceedings used in the\r\nfinding of Offices, to make the Jury finde for the King. The Common-Law\r\nCourts, seeing all Men more inclined to seek Justice there, where it\r\nmay be fitted to their own desire, are known frequently to forsake\r\nthe Rules of the Common-Law, and straining beyond their bounds, under\r\npretence of equity to do Injustice. Titles of Honour, Judiciall places,\r\nSerjeantships at Law, and other Offices have been sold for great\r\nsummes of Money; whereby the common Justice of the Kingdom hath been\r\nmuch endangered, not only by opening away of employment in places of\r\ngreat Trust, and advantage to Men of weak parts; but also by giving\r\noccasion to Bribery, Extortion, Partiality; It seldome hapning that\r\nplaces ill-gotten are well used. Commissions have been granted for\r\nexamining the excesse of Fees: and when great exactions have been\r\ndiscovered, Compositions have been made with Delinquents, not only for\r\nthe time past, but likewise for immunity and security in offending, for\r\nthe time to come; which under colour of remedy, hath but confirmed, and\r\nencreased the Grievance to the Subject.\r\n\r\nThe usuall course of pricking Sheriffs, not observed, but many times\r\nSheriffs made in an extraordinary way; sometimes as a punishment\r\nand charge unto them; sometimes such were pricked out, as would be\r\nInstruments to execute whatsoever they would have to be done.\r\n\r\nThe Bishops and the rest of the Clergy, did triumph in the\r\nSuspensions, Excommunications, Deprivations, and Degradations of\r\ndivers painfull, learned, and pious Ministers, in the vexation, and\r\ngrievous oppression of great numbers of His Majesties good Subjects.\r\nThe High-Commission grew to such excesse of sharpnesse and severity, as\r\nwas not much lesse then the Romish Inquisition; and yet in many cases\r\nby the Archbishops power, was made much more heavy, being assisted, and\r\nstrengthened by authority of the Councell-Table.\r\n\r\nThe Bishops, and their Courts, were as eager in the Countrey; and\r\nalthough their jurisdiction could not reach so high in rigour, and\r\nextremity of punishment, yet were they no lesse grievous, in respect\r\nof the generallity, and multiplicity of vexations, which lighting upon\r\nthe meaner sort of Tradesmen, and Artificers, did impoverish many\r\nthousands, and so afflict and trouble others, that great numbers,\r\nto avoid their miseries, departed out of the Kingdom, some into\r\n_New-England_, and other parts of _America_, others into _Holland_,\r\nwhere they have transported their Manufactures of Cloath which is not\r\nonly a losse by diminishing the present stock of the Kingdome, but a\r\ngreat mischiefe by impairing and endangering the losse of that peculiar\r\nTrade of Cloathing, which hath been a plentifull Fountain of Wealth and\r\nHonour to this Nation.\r\n\r\nThose were fittest for Ecclesiasticall preferment, and soonest obtained\r\nit, who were most officious in promoting superstition, most virulent in\r\nrailing against Godlinesse, and honesty.\r\n\r\nThe most publike and solemn Sermons before His Majestie were, either to\r\nadvance Prerogative above Law, and Decry the propertie of the Subject,\r\nor full of such kinde of invectives; whereby they might make those\r\nodious, who sought to maintain the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the\r\nKingdom; and such Men were sure to be weeded out of the Commission of\r\nthe peace, and out of all other imployments of power in the Government\r\nof the Countrey.\r\n\r\nMany noble Personages were Councellors in name; but the power and\r\nauthority remained in a few of such, as were most addicted to this\r\npartie; whose resolutions, and determinations were brought to the\r\nTable, for countenance, and execution, and not for debate, and\r\ndeliberation; and no Man could offer to appose them without disgrace,\r\nand hazard to himself: Nay, all those that did not wholly concurre\r\nand actively contribute to the furtherance of their designes, though\r\notherwise, persons of never so great Honour, and Abilities, were so\r\nfarre from being employed in any place of Trust, and power, that they\r\nwere neglected, discountenanced, and upon all occasions injured and\r\noppressed.\r\n\r\nThis Faction was grown to that height, and entirenesse of power, that\r\nnow they began to think of finishing their Work, which consisted of\r\nthese three parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n_The Government must be set free from all restraint of Laws concerning\r\nour Persons and States._\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n_There must be a Conjunction betwixt Papists and Protestants in\r\nDoctrine, Discipline, and Ceremonies; only it must not yet be called\r\nPopery._\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n_The Puritans under which name, they include all those that desire\r\nto preserve the Laws, and Liberties of the Kingdom, and to maintain\r\nReligion in the power of it; must be either rooted out of the Kingdom\r\nwith force, or driven out with fear. For the effecting of this, It was\r\nthought necessary to reduce =Scotland= to such Popish superstitions,\r\nand Innovations, as might make them apt to joyn with =England=, in\r\nthat great change which was intended. Whereupon new Canons, and a new\r\nLiturgy were prest upon them; and when they refused to admit of them,\r\nan Army was raised to force them to it, towards which the Clergie, and\r\nthe Papists were very forward in their contribution. The Scots likewise\r\nraised an Army for their defence; and when both Armies were come\r\ntogether, and ready for a bloudy encounter, His Majesties own Gracious\r\ndisposition, and the Councell of the English Nobility, and Dutifull\r\nsubmission of the Scots, did so farre prevail against the evil Councell\r\nof others, that a Pacification was made, and His Maiesty returned with\r\nPeace, and much Honour to =London=._\r\n\r\nThe unexpected reconciliation was most acceptable to all the Kingdome,\r\nexcept to the malignant partie, whereof the Archbishop and the Earle\r\nof Strafford being heads, they and their faction begun to enveigh\r\nagainst the Peace, and to aggravate the proceeding of the States, which\r\nso incensed His Majestie, that he forthwith prepared again for Warre.\r\nAnd such was their confidence, that having corrupted and distempered\r\nthe whole frame and Government of the Kingdome, they did now hope to\r\ncorrupt that which was the onely means to restore all to a right frame\r\nand Temper again: to which end they perswaded His Majestie to call\r\na Parliament, not to seek Counsell and advice of them, but to draw\r\nCountenance and Supply from them, and engage the whole Kingdome in\r\ntheir Quarrell: and in the mean time continued all their unjust Levies\r\nof Money, resolving either to make the Parliament pliant to their Will,\r\nand to establish mischief by a Law, or else to break it; and with more\r\ncolour to go on by violence, to take what they could not obtain by\r\nconsent. The ground alledged for the justification of this Warre was\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThat the undutifull Demands of the Parliaments of _Scotland_, was a\r\nsufficient reason for His Maiestie to take Armes against them without\r\nhearing the Reason of those Demands, And thereupon a new Armie was\r\nprepared against them, their Ships were seized in all Ports, both of\r\n_England_ and _Ireland_, and at Sea. Their Petitions reiected; their\r\nCommissioners refused Audience. This whole Kingdome most miserably\r\ndistempered with Levies of Men and Money, and Imprisonments of those\r\nwho denied to submit to those Levies. The Earle of _Strafford_ past\r\ninto _Ireland_, caused the _Parliament_ there to declare against the\r\n_Scots_, to give foure Subsidies towards that War; and to ingage\r\nthemselves, their lives and fortunes for the prosecution of it, and\r\ngave directions for an Armie of eight thousand foot, and one thousand\r\nhorse to be levied there, which were for the most part Papists. The\r\n_Parliament_ met upon the thirteenth of _April_, one thousand six\r\nhundred and fourtie. The Earle of _Strafford_ and Archbishop of\r\n_Canterbury_ with their Partie so prevailed with His Maiestie, that\r\nthe _House of Commons_ was prest to yeeld to a Supply for maintenance\r\nof the Warre with _Scotland_, before they had provided any reliefe for\r\nthe great and pressing Grievances of the people, which being against\r\nthe fundamentall Priviledge and proceeding of _Parliament_, was yet in\r\nhumble respect to his Maiestie, so far admitted, as that they agreed\r\nto take the matter of Supply into consideration, and two severall\r\ndayes it was debated. Twelve Subsidies were demanded for the release\r\nof Ship-money alone; A third day was appointed for Conclusion when the\r\nHeads of that Partie begun to fear the people might close with the King\r\nin satisfying his desire of Money: But that withall they were like to\r\nblast their malicious designes against _Scotland_, finding them verie\r\nmuch indisposed to give any countenance to that Warre.\r\n\r\nThereupon they wickedly advised the King to break off the _Parliament_,\r\nand to return to the wayes of Confusion, in which their own evill\r\nintentions were most like to prosper and succeed.\r\n\r\nAfter the _Parliament_ ended the fifth of _May_, one thousand six\r\nhundred and fourty, this Partie grew so bold, as to counsell the King\r\nto supply Himself out of his Subiects states by his own power, at\r\nhis own Will, without their consent. The very next day some _Members\r\nof both Houses_ had their Studies and Cabinets, yea their Pockets\r\nsearched: Another of them not long after was committed close prisoner\r\nfor not delivering some Petitions which he received by authoritie of\r\nthat _House_, and if harsher courses were intended (as was reported) it\r\nis very probable that the sicknesse of the Earl of _Strafford_ and the\r\nTumultuous rising in _Southwarke_, and about _Lambeth_, were the causes\r\nthat such violent intentions were not brought to execution. A false and\r\nscandalous Declaration against the _House of Commons_ was published, in\r\nhis Maiesties Name, which yet wrought little effect with the people,\r\nbut onely to manifest the impudence of those who were Authors of it.\r\n\r\nA forced Loan of Money was attempted in the Citie of _London_.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Major and Aldermen in their severall Wards enioyned to bring\r\nin a list of the Names of such persons as they iudged fit to lend, and\r\nof the summe they should lend. And such Aldermen as refused so to do\r\nwere committed to prison.\r\n\r\nThe _Archbishop_ and the other _Bishops_ and _Clergie_ continued the\r\n_Convocation_, and by a new Commission turned it to a _Provinciall\r\nSynod_, in which by an unheard of presumption, they made _Canons_\r\nthat contain in them many matters contrarie to the Kings Prerogative,\r\nto the fundamentall Laws and Statutes of the Realm, to the right of\r\n_Parliaments_, to the Propertie and Libertie of the Subiect, and\r\nmatters tending to sedition and of dangerous consequence, thereby\r\nestablishing their own Vsurpations, justifying their Altar-worship, and\r\nthose other superstitious Innovations which they formerly introduced,\r\nwithout warrant of Law.\r\n\r\nThey imposed a new Oath upon divers of his Maiesties Subiects, both\r\n_Ecclesiasticall_ and _Lay_, for maintenance of their own Tyrannie,\r\nand laid a great Tax upon the Clergy for supply of his Maiestie; and\r\ngenerally they shewed themselves very affectionate to the Warre with\r\n_Scotland_, which was by some of them stiled _Bellum Episcopale_, and a\r\nprayer composed, and enioyned to be read in all Churches, calling the\r\n_Scots_, _Rebels_, to put the two Nations into blood, and make them\r\nirreconciliable. All those pretended _Canons_ and _Constitutions_ were\r\narmed with the severall Censures of _Suspension_, _Excommunication_,\r\n_Deprivation_, by which they would have thrust out all the good\r\nMinisters, and most of the well affected people of the Kingdome, and\r\nleft an easie passage to their own Designe of Reconciliation with\r\n_Rome_. The _Popish_ party enioyned such Exemptions from the _Penall\r\nLaws_ as amounted to a Tolleration, besides many other encouragements,\r\nand Court favours: They had a Secretarie of State, S^{ir}. _Francis\r\nWindibank_, a powerfull Agent for the speeding of all their desires,\r\na _Popes Nuntio_ residing here to act and govern them according to\r\nsuch influences as he received from _Rome_, and to intercede for\r\nthem with the most powerfull concurrence of the forraigne Princes\r\nof that religion: By his authoritie the _Papists_ of all sorts,\r\nNobility, Gentry, and Clergie were convocated, after the manner of a\r\n_Parliament_, new Iurisdictions were erected of _Romish Archbishops_,\r\nTaxes levied, another State moulded within this State independant in\r\nGovernment, contrary in interest and affection, secretly corrupting\r\nthe Ignorant, or negligent professors of our Religion, and closely\r\nuniting and combining themselves against such as were sound, in this\r\nposture waiting for an opportunitie by force to destroy those whom\r\nthey could not hope to seduce. For the effecting whereof, they were\r\nstrengthened with Armes and Munition, encouraged by superstitious\r\nPrayers enioyned by the _Nuntio_ to be weekly made for the prosperitie\r\nof some great designe. And such power had they at Court, that secretly\r\na Commission was issued out, intended to be issued to some great\r\nMen of that profession for the levying of Souldiers, and to command\r\nand employ them according to private Instructions, which we doubt\r\nwere framed for the advantage of those who were the contrivers of\r\nthem: His Maiesties Treasure was consumed, his Revenew anticipated,\r\nHis Servants and Officers compelled to lend great summes of Money;\r\nMultitudes were called to the _Councell Table_, who were tired with\r\nlong attendances there, for refusing illegall payments. The _Prisons_\r\nwere filled with their Commitments; many of the Sheriffes summoned\r\ninto the _Starre Chamber_, and some imprisoned for not being quicke\r\nenough in levying the Ship-money, the people languished under grief,\r\nand fear, no visible hope being left, but in desperation. The Nobility\r\nbegan to be wearie of their silence, and patience, and sensible of\r\nthe dutie and Trust which belongs to them: and thereupon some of the\r\nmost eminent of them did petition His Maiesty at such a time when evil\r\nCouncels were so strong that they had reason to expect more hazard\r\nto themselves, then redresse of those publike evils for which they\r\ninterceded, whilest the Kingdome was in this Agitation and distemper,\r\nthe _Scots_ restrained in their Trades, impoverished by the losse of\r\nmany of their Ships, bereaved of all possibility of satisfying His\r\nMajestie by any naked Supplication, entred with a powerfull Army into\r\nthe Kingdome, and without any hostile Act or spoil in the Countrey as\r\nthey passed, more then forcing a passage over the _Tyne_ at _Newborne_,\r\nneer _Newcastle_, possessed themselves of _Newcastle_, and had a fair\r\nopportunitie to presse on further upon the Kings Armie: but dutie and\r\nReverence to his Majestie, and brotherly love to the _English_ Nation,\r\nmade them stay there, whereby the King had leasure to entertain better\r\nCouncels, wherein God so blessed and directed him, that he summoned the\r\ngreat Councell of Peers to meet at _Yorke_, upon the twentie fourth\r\nof September, and there declared a Parliament to begin the third of\r\nNovemb. then following. The Scots the first day of the great Councell,\r\npresented an humble Petition to His Majestie, whereupon the Treatie\r\nwas appointed at Rippon. A present Cessation of armes agreed upon:\r\nand the full Conclusion of all differences referred to the wisedome\r\nand care of the Parliament. At our first meeting all Oppositions\r\nseemed to vanish, the mischieves were so evident, which those evil\r\nCouncellors produced, that no Man durst stand up to defend them. Yet\r\nthe work it self afforded difficultie enough. The multiplied evils and\r\ncorruption of sixteen yeers strengthened by custome and authoritie,\r\nand the concurrent interest of many powerfull delinquents were now to\r\nbe brought to iudgement and Reformation. The Kings Houshold was to be\r\nprovided for, they had brought him to that want, that he could not\r\nsupply His Ordinarie, and necessarie expences, without the assistance\r\nof his people. Two Armies were to be paied, which amounted very neer to\r\n80. thousand pounds a moneth; the people were to be tenderly charged,\r\nhaving been formerly exhausted with many burthensome Proiects. The\r\ndifficulties seemed to be insuperable, which by the Divine Providence\r\nwe have overcome. The Contrarieties incompatible, which yet in a great\r\nmeasure we have reconciled. Six Subsidies have been granted, and a Bill\r\nof Poll-money, which if it be duely levied, may equall six Subsidies\r\nmore in all: Six hundred thousand pounds. Besides we have contracted\r\na Debt to the Scots of 220. thousand pounds; and yet God hath so\r\nblessed the endeavours of this Parliament, that the Kingdom is a great\r\ngainer by all these charges. The Ship-money is abolished, which cost\r\nthe Kingdome above 200. thousand pounds a yeer. The Coat and Conduct\r\nmoney, and other militarie charges, are taken away, which in many\r\nCountreys amounted to little lesse then the Ship-money. The Monopolies\r\nare all supprest, whereof some few did preiudice the Subiect, above a\r\nMillion yearly. The Soape an hundred thousand pounds; the Wine three\r\nhundred thousand pounds; the Leather must needs exceed both: and Salt\r\ncould be no lesse then that, besides the inferiour Monopolies, which\r\nif they could be exactly computed, would make up a great summe. That\r\nwhich is more beneficiall then all this is, that the root of these\r\nevils is taken away, which was the arbitrarie power pretended to be in\r\nhis Maiestie, of taxing the Subiect, or charging their estates without\r\nconsent in Parliament, which is now declared to be against Law by\r\nthe iudgement of both Houses, and likewise by an Act of Parliament.\r\nAnother step of great advantage is this: the living Grievances, the\r\nevil Councellors and actors of these mischiefs have been so quelled,\r\nby the justice done upon the Earl of Strafford, the flight of the Lord\r\n_Finch_, and Secretarie _Windibank_. The accusation and imprisonment of\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, of Iudge _Bartlet_, and the impeachment\r\nof divers other Bishops and Iudges, that it is like not onely to be\r\nan ease to the present times, but a preservation to the future. The\r\ndiscontinuance of Parliaments is prevented by the Bill for a Trienniall\r\nParliament, and the abrupt dissolution of this Parliament by another\r\nBill; by which it is provided it shall not be dissolved or adiourned\r\nwithout the consent of both Houses. Which two Laws well considered, may\r\nbe thought more advantagious then all the former, because they secure a\r\nfull operation of the present remedie, and afford a perpetuall Spring\r\nof remedies for the future: The Star-Chamber, the High Commission,\r\nthe Courts of the President, and Councell in the North, were so many\r\nforges of miserie, oppression, and violence, and are all taken\r\naway, whereby men are more secured in their persons, liberties, and\r\nestates, then they could be by any Law or Example for the regulation\r\nof those Courts, or Terror of the Iudges; The immoderate power of the\r\n_Councell Table_, and the excessive abuse of that power is so ordered\r\nand restrained, that we may well hope that no such things as were\r\nfrequently done by them, to the prejudice of the publique libertie,\r\nwill appear in future times but onely in Stories, to give us and our\r\nposteritie more occasion to praise God for His Maiesties goodnesse,\r\nand the faithfull endeavours of this _Parliament_. The _Canons_, and\r\nthe power of _Canon_ making, are blasted by the Vote of both _Houses_.\r\nThe exorbitant power of _Bishops_, and their Courts, are much abated,\r\nby some Provisions in the Bill against the _High Commission Court_.\r\nThe authors of the many innovations in Doctrine and Ceremonies; The\r\nMinisters that have been scandalous in their lives, have been so\r\nterrified in iust complaints and accusations, that we may well hope\r\nthey will be more modest for the time to come; either inwardly\r\nconvicted by the sight of their own folly, or outwardly restrained by\r\nthe fear of punishment. The _Forrests_ are by a good Law reduced to\r\ntheir right bounds; The encroachments and oppressions of the _Stannarie\r\nCourts_; The Extortions of the Clerk of the Market, and the Compulsion\r\nof the Subiect to receive the Order of Knighthood against his will,\r\npaying of Fines for not receiving it, and the vexatious proceedings\r\nthereupon for levying of those Fines, are by other beneficiall Laws\r\nreformed and prevented. Many excellent Laws and provisions are in\r\npreparation for removing the inordinate power, vexation, and usurpation\r\nof _Bishops_, for reforming the pride and Idlenesse of many of the\r\nClergie, for easing the people of unnecessarie Ceremonies in Religion,\r\nfor censuring and removing unworthy and unprofitable Ministers; and\r\nfor maintaining godly and diligent Preachers through the Kingdome:\r\nOther things of many importance for the good of this Kingdome, are\r\nin proposition, though little could hitherto be done, in regard of\r\nthe many other more pressing businesses, which yet before the end\r\nof this Session, we hope may receive some progresse and perfection.\r\nThe establishing and ordering the Kings Revenue, that so the abuse\r\nof Officers, and superfluity of expences may be cut off, and the\r\nnecessarie disbursments for his Majesties Honor, the defence and\r\ngovernment of the Kingdome, may be more certainly provided for. The\r\nregulating of Courts of Iustice, and abridging both the delayes and\r\ncharges of Law Suits; The setling of some good courses for preventing\r\nthe exportation of Gold and Silver, and the inequality of exchanges\r\nbetwixt us and other Nations, for the advancing of native Commodities,\r\nincrease of our Manufactures, and well ballancing of Trade, whereby\r\nthe Stock of the Kingdome may be increased, or at least kept from\r\nimpairing, as through neglect hereof it hath done for many yeers\r\nlast past; For improving the Herring fishing, upon our own Coasts,\r\nwhich will be of mightie use in the imployment of the poore, and a\r\nplentifull Nurserie of Mariners for inabling the Kingdome in any\r\ngreat Action. The oppositions, obstructions; and other Difficulties\r\nwherewith we have been encountred, and which still lye in our way with\r\nsome strength and much obstinacie are these: The malignant Partie\r\nwhom we have formerly described, to be the Actors and promoters of\r\nall our miserie, they have taken heart again; They have been able to\r\npreferre some of their own Factors and Agents to degrees of honour, to\r\nplaces of Trust and imployment even during the _Parliament_. They have\r\nendeavoured to work in His Maiestie ill impressions and opinions of Our\r\nproceedings, as if we had altogether done our own work, and not His,\r\nand had obtained from him many things very preiudiciall to the Crown,\r\nboth in respect of Prerogative and Profit. To wipe out this slander,\r\nWe think good onely to say thus much: That all that We have done, is\r\nfor His Maiestie, His greatnesse, Honor, and support, when We yeelded\r\nto give 25000. l. a moneth for the relief of the Northerne Countreys,\r\nthis was given to the King, for he was bound to protect his subiects,\r\nthey were his Maiesties evill Counsellors, and their ill instruments\r\nthat were actors in those grievances which brought in the Scots: and if\r\nhis Majesty please to force those who were the authors of this warre to\r\nmake satisfaction, as he might justly and easily doe, it seemes very\r\nreasonable that the people might well be excused from taking upon them\r\nthis burthen, being altogether innocent, and free from being any causes\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nWhen we undertooke the charge of the army, which cost above 50000.\r\npound a moneth, was not this given to the King? was it not his\r\nMajesties army? were not all the Commanders under contract with his\r\nMajesty at higher rates and greater wages then ordinary? and have not\r\nwe taken upon us to discharge all the brotherly assistance of three\r\nhundred thousand pounds which we gave the Scots? was it not toward\r\nrepaire of those dammages and losses which they received from the\r\nKings ships, and from his ministers? These three particulars amount\r\nto above 1100. thousand pound, besides his Majesty hath received by\r\nimpositions upon merchandise at least 400. thousand pounds; so that\r\nhis Majesty hath had out of the subjects purse since the Parliament\r\nbegan, one million and halfe, and yet these men can be so impudent,\r\nas to tell his Majesty, that we have done nothing for him. As to the\r\nsecond branch of this slander, we acknowledge with much thankfulnesse\r\nthat his Majesty hath passed more good Bils to the advantage of the\r\nsubjects then hath been in many ages; but withall we cannot forget,\r\nthat these venomous counsels did manifest themselves in some endeavours\r\nto hinder these good Acts: And for both Houses of Parliament wee may\r\nwith truth and modesty say thus much, That we have ever been carefull\r\nnot to desire any thing that should weaken the Crowne either in just\r\nprofit or usefull power. The trienniall Parliament, for the matter of\r\nit, doth not extend to so much as by Law we ought to have required,\r\nthere being two Statutes still in force for a Parliament to be once\r\na yeere, and for the manner of it, it is in the Kings power, that it\r\nshall never take effect, if he by a timely summons shall prevent any\r\nother way of assembling. In the Bill for continuance of this present\r\nParliament, there seemes to be some restraint of the royall power in\r\ndissolving of Parliaments, not to take it out of the Crowne, but to\r\nsuspend the execution of it for this time and occasion onely, which\r\nwas so necessary for the Kings owne security, and the publique peace,\r\nthat without it wee could not have undertaken any of these great\r\ncharges, but must have left both the armies to disorder and confusion,\r\nand the whole Kingdome to blood and rapin. The Starchamber was much\r\nmore fruitfull in oppression then in profit, the great fines being\r\nfor the most part given away, and the rest stalled at long times. The\r\nfines of the high Commission were in themselves unjust and seldome or\r\nnever came into the Kings purse. These foure Bils are particularly\r\nand more specially instanced, in the rest, there will not be found\r\nso much as a shadow of prejudice to the Crowne. They have sought\r\nto diminish our reputation with the people, and to bring them out\r\nof love with Parliaments: the aspersions which they have attempted\r\nthis way, have beene such as these, That we have spent much time and\r\ndone little, especially in those grievances which concerne Religion.\r\nThat the Parliament is a burden to the Kingdome by the abundance of\r\nProtections which hinder Justice and Trade, and by many Subsidies\r\ngranted much more heavy then any they formerly endured; to which\r\nthere is a ready answer: If the time spent in this Parliament be\r\nconsidered in relation backward to the long growth and deep roote of\r\nthose grievances, which wee have removed, to the powerfull supports\r\nof those delinquents which wee have pursued, to the great necessities\r\nand other charges of the Common wealth for which we have provided:\r\nor if it be considered in relation forward to many advantages, which\r\nnot onely the present but future ages are like to reape by the good\r\nlawes and other proceedings in this Parliament, we doubt not but it\r\nwill be thought by all indifferent judgments that our time hath beene\r\nmuch better imployed then in a farre greater proportion of time in\r\nmany former Parliaments put together; and the charges which have beene\r\nlaid upon the Subjects, and the other inconveniences which they have\r\nborne will seeme very light in respect of the benefit they have and\r\nmay receive. And for the matter of Protections, the Parliament is so\r\nsensible of it, that therein they intend to give them whatsoever ease\r\nmay stand with Honour and Justice; and are in a way of passing a Bill\r\nto give them satisfaction. They have sought by many subtile practices,\r\nto cause jealousies and divisions betwixt us and our brethren of\r\n_Scotland_, by slandering their proceedings and intentions towards\r\nus, and by secret endeavours to instigate and incense them and us one\r\nagainst another. They have had such a party of Bishops and popish\r\nLords in the House of Peeres, as hath caused much opposition and delay\r\nin the prosecution of delinquents, hindred the proceedings of divers\r\ngood Bils passed in the Commons House, concerning the reformation of\r\nsundry great abuses and corruptions both in Church and State. They\r\nhave laboured to seduce and corrupt some of the Commons House, to draw\r\nthem into Conspiracies and Combinations against the libertie of the\r\nParliament: And by their instruments and agents they have attempted\r\nto disaffect and discontent his Majesties Army, and to ingage it for\r\nthe maintenance of their wicked and trayterous designes, the keeping\r\nup of Bishops in their Votes and functions, and by force to compell\r\nthe Parliament to order, limit, and dispose their proceedings in such\r\nmanner as might best concurre with the intentions of this dangerous and\r\npotent faction: And when one mischievous designe, and attempt of theirs\r\nto bring on the Army against the Parliament, and the City of _London_\r\nhad been discovered and prevented, they presently undertooke another\r\nof the same damnable nature, with this addition to it, to endeavour\r\nto make the Scotish Army neutrall, whilst the English Army which they\r\nhad laboured to corrupt and invenome against us by their false and\r\nslanderous suggestions should execute their malice to the subversion\r\nof our Religion and the dissolution of our government. Thus they have\r\nbeene continually practizing to disturbe the peace, and plotting the\r\ndestruction even of all the Kings Dominions, and have employed their\r\nemissaries and agents in them all for the promoting of their divellish\r\ndesignes which the vigilancie of those who were well affected hath\r\nstill discovered and defeated before they were ripe for execution in\r\n_England_ and _Scotland_: only in _Ireland_ which was farther of, they\r\nhave had time and opportunity to mould and prepare their worke, and\r\nhad brought it to that perfection that they had possessed themselves\r\nof that whole Kingdome, totally subverted the government of it, rooted\r\nout Religion, and destroyed all the protestants whom the conscience of\r\ntheir duty to God, their King and Countrey would not have permitted\r\nto joyne with them, if by Gods wonderfull providence their maine\r\nenterprize upon the City and Castell of _Dublin_ had not beene detected\r\nand prevented upon the very eave before it should have beene executed.\r\nNotwithstanding they have in other parts of that Kingdome broken out\r\ninto open rebellion, surprised Townes and Castles, committed murders,\r\nrapes, and other villanies; and shaken off all bonds of obedience to\r\nhis Majesty, and the lawes of the Realme; and in generall have kindled\r\nsuch a fire, as nothing but Gods infinite blessing upon the wisdome and\r\nendeavours of this State will be able to quench it: and certainely had\r\nnot God in his great mercy unto this Land discovered and confounded\r\ntheir former designes, we had been the Prologue to this Tragedy in\r\n_Ireland_, and had by this time been made the lamentable spectacle of\r\nmisery and confusion. And now what hope have we but in God, when as the\r\nonely means of our subsistance, and power of reformation is under him,\r\nin the Parliament; but what can we the Commons without the conjunction\r\nof the House of Lords, and what conjunction can wee expect there,\r\nwhen the Bishops and Recusant Lords are so numerous and prevalent,\r\nthat they are able to crosse and interrupt our best endeavours for\r\nreformation, and by that meanes give advantage to this malignant party\r\nto traduce our proceedings. They infuse into the people, that we meane\r\nto abolish all Church government, and leave every man to his owne fancy\r\nfor the service and worship of God, absolving him of that obedience\r\nwhich he owes under God unto his Majesty whom wee know to be intrusted\r\nwith the ecclesiasticall law as well as with the temporall to regulate\r\nall the members of the Church of _England_ by such rules of order\r\nand discipline as are established by parliament which is his great\r\nCouncell, in all affaires both in Church and State. We confesse our\r\nintention is and our endeavours have been to reduce within bounds that\r\nexorbitant power which the prelates have assumed unto themselves so\r\ncontrary both to the Word of God, and to the Laws of the Land, to which\r\nend wee past the Bill for the removing them from their temporall power,\r\nand imployments, that so the better they might with meekenesse apply\r\nthemselves to the discharge of their functions, which Bill themselves\r\nopposed, and were the principall instruments of crossing it.\r\n\r\nAnd we do here declare, that it is farre from our purpose or desire\r\nto let loose the golden reynes of discipline, and government in the\r\nChurch, to leave private persons or particular Congregations to take up\r\nwhat forme of divine Service they please; for we hold it requisite that\r\ntheir should be throughout the whole Realme a conformity to that Order\r\nwhich the Lawes enjoyne, according to the Word of God: and we desire\r\nto unburthen the consciences of men of needlesse and superstitious\r\nceremonies, suppresse innovations, and take away the monuments of\r\nIdolatry. And the better to effect the intended reformation we desire\r\nthere may be a generall Synod of the most grave, pious, learned, and\r\njudicious Divines of this Island, assisted with some from forraine\r\nparts professing the same Religion with us, who may consider of all\r\nthings necessary for the peace & good government of the Church, and\r\nrepresent the results of their consultations unto the Parliament to\r\nbe there allowed of and confirmed, and receive the stamp of authority\r\nthereby to finde passage and obedience throughout the Kingdome. They\r\nhave malitiously charged us that wee intend to destroy and discourage\r\nlearning, whereas it is our chiefest care and desire to advance it\r\nand to provide a competent maintenance for conscionable and preaching\r\nMinisters throughout the Kingdome, which will be a great encouragement\r\nto Schollers, and a certaine means whereby the want, meanesse, and\r\nignorance to which a great part of the Clergy is now subject, will be\r\nprevented. And wee intend likewise to reforme, and purge the fountaines\r\nof learning the two Universities, that the streames flowing from thence\r\nmay be cleere and pure, and an honour and comfort to the whole Land.\r\nThey have strayned to blast our proceedings in Parliament by wresting\r\nthe interpretations of our Orders from their genuine intention. They\r\ntell the people that our medling with the power of Episcopacy, hath\r\ncaused sectaries and conventicles, when idolatry and popish ceremonies\r\nintroduced in the Church by the command of the Bishops have not onely\r\ndebarred the people from thence, but expelled them from the Kingdome.\r\nThus with _Eliah_ we are called by this malignant party the troublers\r\nof the State, and still while we endeavour to reforme their abuses,\r\nthey make us the authours of those mischiefes we study to prevent: for\r\nthe perfecting of the worke begun and removing all future impediments,\r\nwe conceave these courses will be very effectuall, seeing the religion\r\nof the Papists, hath such principals as doe certainely tend to the\r\ndestruction and extirpation of all Protestants when they shall have\r\nopportunity to effect it.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in the first place to keep them in such a condition,\r\nas that they may not be able to do us any hurt, and for avoyding of\r\nsuch connivence and favour as hath heretofore been shewed unto them,\r\nThat his Majesty be pleased to grant a standing Commission to some\r\nchoice men named in Parliament, who may take notice of their encrease,\r\ntheir counsels and proceedings, and use all due meanes by execution of\r\nthe Lawes to prevent all mischievous designes, against the peace and\r\nsafety of this Kingdome. That some good course be taken to discover the\r\ncounterfeit and false conformity of Papists to the Church by colour\r\nwhereof persons very much disaffected to the true religion have beene\r\nadmitted into place of greatest authority and trust in the Kingdome.\r\n\r\nFor the better preservation of the Lawes and liberties of the Kingdome,\r\nthat all illegall grievances and exactions be presented, and punished\r\nat the Sessions, and Assizes: and that Judges and Justices be very\r\ncarefull to give this in charge to the grand Jury, and both the\r\nSheriffe and Justices to be sworne to the due execution of the petition\r\nof right and other Lawes: That his Majesty be humbly petitioned by both\r\nhouses to employ such Counsellours, Ambassadors, and other Ministers in\r\nmannaging his businesse at home and abroad, as the Parliament may have\r\ncause to confide in, without which wee cannot give his Majesty such\r\nsupplies for support of his owne estate, nor such assistance to the\r\nprotestant party beyond the Sea, as is desired. It may often fall out\r\nthat the Commons may have just cause to take exceptions at some men for\r\nbeing Counsellors, and yet not charge those men with crimes, for there\r\nbe grounds of diffidence which lie not in proofe: there are others\r\nwhich though they may be proved yet are not legally criminall, to be a\r\nknowne favourer of papists, or to have beene very forward in defending\r\nor countenancing some great offenders questioned in Parliament, or to\r\nspeake contemptuously of either Houses of Parliament, or Parliamentary\r\nproceedings, or such as are factours or agents for any forraine Prince\r\nof another Religion, such are justly suspect to get Counsellors places\r\nor any other of trust concerning publique imployment for money: For all\r\nthese and divers others wee may have great reason to be earnest with\r\nhis Majesty not to put his great affaires into such hands, though we\r\nmay be unwilling to proceed against them in any legall way of charge\r\nor impeachment: that all Counsellors of State may be sworn to observe\r\nthose Lawes which concerne the Subject in his libertie, that they may\r\nlikewise take an oath not to receive or give reward or pension from any\r\nforraine Prince, but such as they shall within some reasonable time\r\ndiscover to the Lords of his Majesties Councell: and although they\r\nshould wickedly forsweare themselves, yet it may herein doe good to\r\nmake them knowne to be false and perjured to those who imploy them, and\r\nthereby bring them into as little credit with them as with us. That his\r\nMajesty may have cause to be in love with good Counsel and good men, by\r\nshewing him in an humble and dutifull manner, how full of advantage\r\nit would be to himselfe, to see his owne estate setled in a plentifull\r\ncondition to support his honour, to see his people united in waies of\r\nduty to him, and endeavours of the publique good; to see happinesse,\r\nwealth, peace and safety derived to his owne Kingdome, and procured\r\nto his Allies by the influence of his owne power and government. That\r\nall good courses may be taken to unite the two Kingdomes of _England_\r\nand _Scotland_ to be mutually ayding and assisting of one another for\r\nthe common good of the Island, and honour of both. To take away all\r\ndifferences amongst our selves for matters indifferent in their owne\r\nnature concerning Religion; and to unite our selves against the common\r\nenemies which are the better enabled by our divisions to destroy us\r\nall, as they hope and have often endeavoured. To labour by all offices\r\nof friendship to unite the forrain Churches with us in the same cause,\r\nand to seeke their liberty, safety, and prosperity, as bound thereunto\r\nboth by charity to them, and by wisdome for our owne good. For by\r\nthis meanes our owne strength shall be encreased, and by a mutuall\r\nconcurrence to the same common end, we shall be enabled to procure the\r\ngood of the whole body of the Protestant profession. If these things\r\nmay be observed, wee doubt not but God will crowne this Parliament with\r\nsuch successe as shall be the beginning, and foundation of more honour\r\nand happinesse to his Majesty, then ever yet was enjoyed by any of his\r\nRoyall Predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nArchaic and inconsistent spelling and punctuation has been reproduced\r\nas printed.\r\n\r\nIllegible or unclear letters have been imputed to form the word\r\nexpected in the context.\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been made to the text as printed:\r\n\r\nPage 33: \"whereupou\" has been changed to \"whereupon\".\r\n\r\nPage 37: \"wher-by\" hyphenated across a line break has been rendered as\r\n\"whereby\".\r\n\r\nPage 37: A full stop has been inserted after \"Vote of both Houses\".\r\n\r\nPage 39: \"ex-exchanges\" hyphenated across a line break has been\r\nrendered as \"exchanges\".",
